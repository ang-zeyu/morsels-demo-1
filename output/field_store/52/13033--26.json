With  respect to the perfect flowers setting seed see Dr. Ascherson in 'Bot.  Zeitung' 1864 page 350.), but this grass is now known occasionally to produce  perfect flowers, which set seed.    Although some plants, both indigenous and naturalised, rarely or never produce  flowers, or if they flower never produce seeds, yet no one doubts that  phanerogamic plants are adapted to produce flowers, and the flowers to produce  seed. When they fail, we believe that such plants under different conditions  would perform their proper function, or that they formerly did so, and will do  so again. On analogous grounds, I believe that the flowers in the above  specified anomalous cases which do not now intercross, either would do so  occasionally under different conditions, or that they formerly did so--the  means for affecting this being generally still retained--and will again  intercross at some future period, unless indeed they become extinct. On this  view alone, many points in the structure and action of the reproductive organs  in hermaphrodite plants and animals are intelligible,--for instance, the fact  of the male and female organs never being so completely enclosed as to render  access from without impossible. Hence we may conclude that the most important  of all the means for giving uniformity to the individuals of the same species,  namely, the capacity of occasionally intercrossing, is present, or has been  formerly present, with all organic beings, except, perhaps, some of the  lowest.    [ON CERTAIN CHARACTERS NOT BLENDING.    When two breeds are crossed their characters usually become intimately fused  together; but some characters refuse to blend, and are transmitted in an  unmodified state either from both parents or from one. When grey and white  mice are paired, the young are piebald, or pure white or grey, but not of an  intermediate tint; so it is when white and common collared turtle-doves are  paired. In breeding Game fowls, a great authority, Mr. J. Douglas, remarks, \"I  may here state a strange fact: if you cross a black with a white game, you get  birds of both breeds of the clearest colour.\" Sir R. Heron crossed during many  years white, black, brown, and fawn-coloured Angora rabbits, and never once  got these colours mingled in the same animal, but often all four colours in  the same litter. (15/18. Extract of a letter from Sir R. Heron 1838 given me  by Mr. Yarrell. With respect to mice see 'Annal. des Sc. Nat.' tome 1 page  180; and I have heard of other similar cases. For turtle-doves Boitard and  Corbie 'Les Pigeons' etc. page 238. For the Game fowl 'The Poultry Book' 1866  page 128. For crosses of tailless fowls see Bechstein 'Naturges. Deutsch.' b.  3 s. 403. Bronn 'Geschichte der Natur' b. 2 s. 170 gives analogous facts with  horses. On the hairless condition of crossed South American dogs see Rengger  'Saugethiere von Paraguay' s. 152; but I saw in the Zoological Gardens  mongrels, from a similar cross, which were hairless, quite hairy, or hairy in  patches, that is, piebald with hair. For crosses of Dorking and other fowls  see 'Poultry Chronicle' volume 2 page 355. About the crossed pigs, extract of  letter from Sir R. Heron to Mr. Yarrell. For other cases see P. Lucas  'L'Hered. Nat.' tome 1 page 212.) From cases like these, in which the colours  of the two parents are transmitted quite separately to the offspring, we have  all sorts of gradations, leading to complete fusion. I will give an instance:  a gentleman with a fair complexion, light hair but dark eyes, married a lady  with dark hair and complexion: their three children have very light hair, but  on careful search about a dozen black hairs were found scattered in the midst  of the light hair on the heads of all three.    When turnspit dogs and ancon sheep, both of which have dwarfed limbs, are  crossed with common breeds, the offspring are not intermediate in structure,  but take after either parent. When tailless or hornless animals are crossed  with perfect animals, it frequently, but by no means invariably, happens that  the offspring are either furnished with these organs in a perfect state, or  are quite destitute of them. According to Rengger, the hairless condition of  the Paraguay dog is either perfectly or not at all transmitted to its mongrel  offspring; but I have seen one partial exception in a dog of this parentage  which had part of its skin hairy, and part naked, the parts being distinctly  separated as in a piebald animal. When Dorking fowls with five toes are  crossed with other breeds, the chickens often have five toes on one foot and  four on the other. Some crossed pigs raised by Sir R. Heron between the solid-  hoofed and common pig had not all four feet in an intermediate condition, but  two feet were furnished with properly divided, and two with united hoofs.    Analogous facts have been observed with plants: Major Trevor Clarke crossed  the little, glabrous-leaved, annual stock (Matthiola), with pollen of a large,  red-flowered, rough-leaved, biennial stock, called cocardeau by the French,  and the result was that half the seedlings had glabrous and the other half  rough leaves, but none had leaves in an intermediate state. That the glabrous  seedlings were the product of the rough-leaved variety, and not accidentally  of the mother-plant's own pollen, was shown by their tall and strong habit of  growth. (15/19. 'Internat. Hort. and Bot. Congress of London' 1866.) in the  succeeding generations raised from the rough-leaved crossed seedlings, some  glabrous plants appeared, showing that the glabrous character, though  incapable of blending with and modifying the rough leaves, was all the time  latent in this family of plants. The numerous plants formerly referred to,  which I raised from reciprocal crosses between the peloric and common  Antirrhinum, offer a nearly parallel case; for in the first generation all the  plants resembled the common form, and in the next generation, out of one  hundred and thirty-seven plants, two alone were in an intermediate condition,  the others perfectly resembling either the peloric or common form. Major  Trevor Clarke also fertilised the above-mentioned red-flowered stock with  pollen from the purple Queen stock, and about half the seedlings scarcely  differed in habit, and not at all in the red colour of the flower, from the  mother-plant, the other half bearing blossoms of a rich purple, closely like  those of the paternal plant. Gartner crossed many white and yellow-flowered  species and varieties of Verbascum; and these colours were never blended, but  the offspring bore either pure white or pure yellow blossoms; the former in  the larger proportion. (15/20. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 307. Kolreuter 'Dritte  Fortsetszung' s. 34, 39 however, obtained intermediate tints from similar  crosses in the genus Verbascum. With respect to the turnips see Herbert  'Amaryllidaceae' 1837 page 370.) Dr. Herbert raised many seedlings, as he  informed me, from Swedish turnips crossed by two other varieties, and these  never produced flowers of an intermediate tint, but always like one of their  parents. I fertilised the purple sweet-pea (Lathyrus odoratus), which has a  dark reddish-purple standard-petal and violet-coloured wings and keel, with  pollen of the painted lady sweet-pea, which has a pale cherry-coloured  standard, and almost white wings and keel; and from the same pod I twice  raised plants perfectly resembling both sorts; the greater number resembling  the father. So perfect was the resemblance, that I should have thought there  had been some mistake, if the plants which were at first identical with the  paternal variety, namely, the painted-lady, had not later in the season  produced, as mentioned in a former chapter, flowers blotched and streaked with  dark purple. I raised grandchildren and great-grandchildren from these crossed  plants, and they continued to resemble the painted-lady, but during later  generations became rather more blotched with purple, yet none reverted  completely to the original mother-plant, the purple sweet-pea. The following  case is slightly different, but still shows the same principle: Naudin (15/21.  'Nouvelles Archives du Museum' tome 1 page 100.) raised numerous hybrids  between the yellow Linaria vulgaris and the purple L. purpurea, and during  three successive generations the colours kept distinct in different parts of  the same flower.    From cases such as the foregoing, in which the offspring of the first  generation perfectly resemble either parent, we come by a small step to those  cases in which differently coloured flowers borne on the same root resemble  both parents, and by another step to those in which the same flower or fruit  is striped or blotched with the two parental colours, or bears a single stripe  of the colour or other characteristic quality of one of the parent-forms. With  hybrids and mongrels it frequently or even generally happens that one part of  the body resembles more or less closely one parent and another part the other  parent; and here again some resistence to fusion, or, what comes to the same  thing, some mutual affinity between the organic atoms of the same nature,  apparently comes into play, for otherwise all parts of the body would be  equally intermediate in character. So again, when the offspring of hybrids or  mongrels, which are themselves nearly intermediate in character, revert either  wholly or by segments to their ancestors, the principle of the affinity of  similar, or the repulsion of dissimilar atoms, must come into action. To this  principle, which seems to be extremely general, we shall recur in the chapter  on pangenesis.    It is remarkable, as has been strongly insisted upon by Isidore Geoffroy St.  Hilaire in regard to animals, that the transmission of characters without  fusion occurs very rarely when species are crossed; I know of one exception  alone, namely,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28752"],[0,"Pleasures of the telescope (#19)"],[1," 3.24\", p. 122 deg., and 25\", p. 110 deg.. The  double mentioned above as being too close for our three-inch glass is  epsilon, which, however, can be divided with the four-inch, although the  five-inch will serve us better. The magnitudes are five and a half and  six, distance 1.26\", p. 202 deg.. The star 52 has two companions, one of  which is so close that our instruments can not separate it, while the  other is too faint to be visible in the light of its brilliant neighbor  without the aid of a very powerful telescope.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 23.]    We are now about to enter one of the most magnificent regions in the  sky, which is hardly less attractive to the naked eye than Orion, and  which men must have admired from the beginning of their history on the  earth, the constellation Taurus (map No. 23). Two groups of stars  especially distinguish Taurus, the Hyades and the Pleiades, and both are  exceedingly interesting when viewed with the lowest magnifying powers of  our telescopes.    We shall begin with a little star just west of the Pleiades, Sigma 412,  also called 7 Tauri. This is a triple, but we can see it only as a  double, the third star being exceedingly close to the primary. The  magnitudes are six and a half, seven, and ten, distances 0.3\", p. 216 deg.,  and 22\", p. 62 deg.. In the Pleiades we naturally turn to the brightest star  eta, or Alcyone, famous for having once been regarded as the central sun  around which our sun and a multitude of other luminaries were supposed  to revolve, and picturesque on account of the little triangle of small  stars near it which the least telescopic assistance enables us to see.  One may derive much pleasure from a study of the various groupings of  stars in the Pleiades. Photography has demonstrated, what had long been  suspected from occasional glimpses revealed by the telescope, that this  celebrated cluster of stars is intermingled with curious forms of  nebulae. The nebulous matter appears in festoons, apparently attached to  some of the larger stars, such as Alcyone, Merope, and Maia, and in  long, narrow, straight lines, the most remarkable of which, a faintly  luminous thread starting midway between Maia and Alcyone and running  eastward some 40', is beaded with seven or eight stars. The width of  this strange nebulous streak is, on an average, 3\" or 4\", and there is,  perhaps, no more wonderful phenomenon anywhere in celestial space.  Unfortunately, no telescope is able to show it, and all our knowledge  about it is based upon photographs. It might be supposed that it was a  nebulous disk seen edgewise, but for the fact that at the largest star  involved in its course it bends sharply about 10 deg. out of its former  direction, and for the additional fact that it seems to take its origin  from a curved offshoot of the intricate nebulous mass surrounding Maia.  Exactly at the point where this curve is transformed into a straight  line shines a small star! In view of all the facts the idea does not  seem to be very far-fetched that in the Pleiades we behold an assemblage  of suns, large and small, formed by the gradual condensation of a  nebula, and in which evolution has gone on far beyond the stage  represented by the Orion nebula, where also a group of stars may be in  process of formation out of nebulous matter. If we look a little farther  along this line of development, we may perceive in such a stellar  assemblage as the cluster in Hercules, a still later phase wherein all  the originally scattered material has, perhaps, been absorbed into the  starry nuclei.    [Illustration: THE CHIEF STARS IN THE PLEIADES.]    The yellow star Sigma 430 has two companions: magnitudes six, nine, and  nine and a half, distances 26\", p. 55 deg., and 39\", p. 302 deg.. The star 30 of  the fifth magnitude has a companion of the ninth magnitude, distance 9\",  p. 58 deg., colors emerald and purple, faint. An interesting variable, of  the type of Algol, is lambda, which at maximum is of magnitude three and  four tenths and at minimum of magnitude four and two tenths. Its period  from one maximum to the next is about three days and twenty-three hours,  but the actual changes occupy only about ten hours, and it loses light  more swiftly than it regains it. A combination of red and blue is  presented by Phi (mistakenly marked on map No. 23 as psi). The  magnitudes are six and eight, distance 56\", p. 242 deg.. A double of similar  magnitudes is chi, distance 19\", p. 25 deg.. Between the two stars which the  naked eye sees in kappa is a minute pair, each of less than the eleventh  magnitude, distance 5\", p. 324 deg.. Another naked-eye double is formed by  theta^1 and theta^2, in the Hyades. The magnitudes are five and five and  a half, distance about 5' 37\".    The leading star of Taurus, Aldebaran (alpha), is celebrated for its  reddish color. The precise hue is rather uncertain, but Aldebaran is not  orange as Betelgeuse in Orion is, and no correct eye can for an instant  confuse the colors of these two stars, although many persons seem to be  unable to detect the very plain difference between them in this respect.  Aldebaran has been called \"rose-red,\" and it would be an interesting  occupation for an amateur to determine, with the aid of some proper  color scale, the precise hue of this star, and of the many other stars  which exhibit chromatic idiosyncrasy. Aldebaran is further interesting  as being a standard first-magnitude star. With the four-inch glass we  see without difficulty the tenth-magnitude companion following Aldebaran  at a distance of 114\", p. 35 deg.. There is an almost inexplicable charm  about these faint attendants of bright stars, which is quite different  from the interest attaching to a close and nearly equal pair. The  impression of physical relationship is never lacking though it may be  deceptive, and this awakens a lively appreciation of the vast  differences of magnitude that exist among the different suns of space.    The actual size and might of this great red sun form an attractive  subject for contemplation. As it appears to our eyes Aldebaran gives one  twenty-five-thousand-millionth as much light as the sun, but if we were  placed midway between them the star would outshine the sun in the ratio  of not less than 160 to 1. And yet, gigantic as it is, Aldebaran is  possibly a pygmy in comparison with Arcturus, whose possible dimensions  were discussed in the chapter relating to Booetes. Although Aldebaran is  known to possess several of the metallic elements that exist in the sun,  its spectrum differs widely from the solar spectrum in some respects,  and more closely resembles that of Arcturus.    Other interesting objects in Taurus are sigma, divisible with the naked  eye, magnitudes five and five and a half, distance 7'; Sigma 674,  double, magnitudes six and nine, distance 10.5\", p. 147 deg.; Sigma 716,  double, magnitudes six and seven, distance 5\", p. 200 deg.--a pleasing  sight; tau, triple, magnitudes four, ten and a half, and eleven,  distances 36\", p. 249 deg., and 36\", p. 60 deg.--the ten-and-a-half-magnitude  star is itself double, as discovered by Burnham; star cluster No. 1030,  not quite as broad as the moon, and containing some stars as large as  the eleventh magnitude; and nebula No. 1157, the so-called \"Crab nebula\"  of Lord Rosse, which our glasses will show only as a misty patch of  faint light, although large telescopes reveal in it a very curious  structure.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 24.]    We now turn to the cluster of circumpolar constellations sometimes  called the Royal Family, in allusion to the well-known story of the  Ethiopian king Cepheus and his queen Cassiopeia, whose daughter  Andromeda was exposed on the seashore to be devoured by a monster, but  who was saved by the hero Perseus. All these mythologic personages are  represented in the constellations that we are about to study.[4] We  begin with Andromeda (map No. 24). The leading star alpha marks one  corner of the great square of Pegasus. The first star of telescopic  interest that we find in Andromeda is , a double difficult on account of  the faintness of the smaller component. The magnitudes are four and  eleven, distance 49\", p. 110 deg.. A few degrees north of the naked eye  detects a glimmering point where lies the Great Nebula in Andromeda.  This is indicated on the map by the number 116. With either of our three  telescopes it is an interesting object, but of course it is advisable to  use our largest glass in order to get as much light as possible. All  that we can see is a long, shuttle-shaped nebulous object, having a  brighter point near the center. Many stars are scattered over the field  in its neighborhood, but the nebula itself, although its spectrum is  peculiar in resembling that of a faint star, is evidently a gaseous or  at any rate a meteoritic mass, since photographs show it to be composed  of a series of imperfectly separated spirals surrounding a vast central  condensation. This peculiarity of the Andromeda nebula, which is  invisible with telescopes although conspicuous in the photographs, has,  since its discovery a few years ago, given a great impetus to  speculation concerning the transformation of nebulae into stars and star  clusters. No one can look at a good photograph of this wonderful  phenomenon without noticing its resemblance to the ideal state of things  which, according to the nebular hypothesis, must once have existed in  the solar system. It is to be remembered, however, that there is  probably sufficient material in the Andromeda nebula to make a system  many times, perhaps hundreds or thousands of times, as extensive as that  of which our sun is the center. If one contemplates this nebula only  long enough to get a clear perception of the fact that creation was not  ended when, according to the Mosaic history, God, having in six days  finished \"the heavens and the earth and all the host of them,\""]]]
