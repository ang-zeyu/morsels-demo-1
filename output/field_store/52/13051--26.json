They know their kind, their mates, their enemies, their food,  heat from cold, hard from soft, and a thousand other things that it is  important that they should know, and they know these things just as we  know them, through their perceptive powers.    We may ascribe intelligence to the animals in the same sense in which  we ascribe it to a child, as the perception of the differences or of  the likenesses and the relations of things--that is, perceptive  intelligence, but not reasoning intelligence. When the child begins to  \"notice things,\" to know its mother, to fear strangers, to be  attracted by certain objects, we say it begins to show intelligence.  Development in this direction goes on for a long time before it can  form any proper judgment about things or take the step of reason.    If we were to subtract from the sum of the intelligence of an animal  that which it owes to nature or inherited knowledge, the amount left,  representing its own power of thought, would be very small. Darwin  tells of a pike in an aquarium separated by plate-glass from fish  which were its proper food, and that the pike, in trying to capture  the fish, would often dash with such violence against the glass as to  be completely stunned. This the pike did for three months before it  learned caution. After the glass was removed, the pike would not  attack those particular fishes, but would devour others that were  introduced. It did not yet understand the situation, but merely  associated the punishment it had received with a particular kind of  fish.    During the mating season the males of some of our birds may often be  seen dashing themselves against a window, and pecking and fluttering  against the pane for hours at a time, day after day. They take their  own images reflected in the glass to be rival birds, and are bent upon  demolishing them. They never comprehend the mystery of the glass,  because glass is not found in nature, and neither they nor their  ancestors have had any experience with it.    Contrast these incidents with those which Darwin relates of the  American monkeys. When the monkeys had cut themselves once with any  sharp tool, they would not touch it again, or else would handle it  with the greatest caution. They evinced the simpler forms of reason,  of which monkeys are no doubt capable.    Animals are wise as Nature is wise; they partake, each in its own  measure, of that universal intelligence, or mind-stuff, that is  operative in all things--in the vegetable as well as in the animal  world. Does the body, or the life that fills it, reason when it tries  to get rid of, or to neutralize the effects of, a foreign substance,  like a bullet, by encysting it? or when it thickens the skin on the  hand or on any other part of the body, even forming special pads  called callosities, as a result of the increased wear or friction?  This may be called physiological intelligence.    But how blind this intelligence is at times, or how wanting in  judgment, may be seen when it tries to develop a callosity upon the  foot as a result of the friction of the shoe, and overdoes the matter  and produces the corn. The corn is a physiological blunder. Or see an  unexpected manifestation of this intelligence when we cut off the  central and leading shoot of a spruce or of a pine tree, and  straightway one of the lateral and horizontal branches rises up, takes  the place of the lost leader, and carries the tree upward; or in the  roots of a tree working their way through the ground much like molten  metal, parting and uniting, taking the form of whatever object they  touch, shaping themselves to the rock, flowing into its seams, the  better to get a grip upon the earth and thus maintain an upright  position.    In the animal world this foresight becomes psychic intelligence,  developing in man the highest form of all, reasoned intelligence. When  an animal solves a new problem or meets a new condition as effectually  as the tree or the body does in the cases I have just cited, we are  wont to ascribe to it powers of reason. Reason we may call it, but it  is reason not its own.    This universal or cosmic intelligence makes up by far the greater part  of what animals know. The domestic animals, such as the dog, that have  long been under the tutelage of man, of course show more independent  power of thought than the uneducated beasts of the fields and woods.    The plant is wise in all ways to reproduce and perpetuate itself; see  the many ingenious devices for scattering seed. In the animal world  this intelligence is most keen and active in the same direction. The  wit of the animal comes out most clearly in looking out for its food  and safety. We are often ready to ascribe reason to it in feats shown  in these directions.    In man alone does this universal intelligence or mind-stuff reach out  beyond these primary needs and become aware of itself. What the plant  or the animal does without thought or rule, man takes thought about.  He considers his ways, I noticed that the scallops in the shallow  water on the beach had the power to anchor themselves to stones or to  some other object, by putting out a little tough but elastic cable  from near the hinge, and that they did so when the water was rough;  but I could not look upon It as an act of conscious or individual  intelligence on the part of the bivalve. It was as much an act of the  general intelligence to which I refer as was its hinge or its form.  But when the sailor anchors his ship, that is another matter. He  thinks about it, he reasons from cause to effect, he sees the storm  coming, he has a fund of experience, and his act is a special  individual act.    The muskrat builds its house instinctively, and all muskrats build  alike. Man builds his house from reason and forethought. Savages build  as nearly alike as the animals, but civilized man shows an endless  variety. The higher the intelligence, the greater the diversity.    The sitting bird that is so solicitous to keep its eggs warm, or to  feed and defend its young, probably shows no more independent and  individual intelligence than the plant that strives so hard to mature  and scatter its seed. A plant will grow toward the light; a tree will  try to get from under another tree that overshadows it; a willow will  run its roots toward the water: but these acts are the results of  external stimuli alone.    When I go to pass the winter in a warmer climate, the act is the  result of calculation and of weighing pros and cons. I can go, of I  can refrain from going. Not so with the migrating birds. Nature plans  and thinks for them; it is not an individual act on the part of each;  it is a race instinct: they must go; the life of the race demands it.  Or when the old goose covers up her nest, or the rabbit covers her  young with a blanket of hair and grass of her own weaving, I do not  look upon these things as independent acts of intelligence: it is the  cunning of nature; it is a race instinct.    Animals, on the whole, know what is necessary for them to know--what  the conditions of life have taught their ancestors through countless  generations. It is very important, for instance, that amphibians shall  have some sense that shall guide them to the water; and they have such  a sense. It is said that young turtles and crocodiles put down  anywhere will turn instantly toward the nearest water. It is certain  that the beasts of the field have such a sense much more fully  developed than has man. It is of vital importance that birds should  know how to fly, how to build their nests, how to find their proper  food, and when and where to migrate, without instruction or example,  otherwise the race might become extinct.    Richard Jefferies says that most birds'-nests need a structure around  them like a cage to keep the young from falling out or from leaving  the nest prematurely. Now, if such a structure were needed, either the  race of birds would have failed, or the structure would have been  added. Since neither has happened, we are safe in concluding it is not  needed.    We are not warranted in attributing to any wild, untrained animal a  degree of intelligence that its forbears could not have possessed. The  animals for the most part act upon inherited knowledge, that is,  knowledge that does not depend upon instruction or experience. For  instance, the red squirrels near me seem to know that chestnut-burs  will open if cut from the tree and allowed to lie upon the ground. At  least, they act upon this theory. I do not suppose this fact or  knowledge lies in the squirrel's mind as it would in that of a man--as  a deduction from facts of experience or of observation. The squirrel  cuts off the chestnuts because he is hungry for them, and because his  ancestors for long generations have cut them off in the same way. That  the air or sun will cause the burs to open is a bit of knowledge that  I do not suppose he possesses in the sense in which we possess it: he  is in a hurry for the nuts, and does not by any means always wait for  the burs to open; he frequently chips them up and eats the pale nuts.    The same squirrel will bite into the limbs of a maple tree in spring  and suck the sap. What does he know about maple trees and the spring  flow of sap? Nothing as a mental concept, as a bit of concrete  knowledge. He often finds the sap flowing from a crack or other wound  in the limbs of a maple, and he sips it and likes it. Then he sinks  his teeth into the limb, as his forbears undoubtedly did.    When I was a boy and saw, as I often did on my way to school, where a  squirrel had stopped on his course through the woods and dug down  through two or three feet of snow, bringing up a beech-nut or an  acorn, I used to wonder how he knew the nut was there. I am now  convinced that he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3029"],[0,"Real Soldiers of Fortune (#19)"],[1,"also appreciated  that for the final attack the moment had come. As he charged, Walker,  apparently routed, fled, but concealed in the rocks behind him he had  stationed a rear-guard of a dozen men. As Melendrez rode into this  ambush the dozen riflemen emptied as many saddles, and the Mexicans and  Indians stampeded. A half hour later, footsore and famished, the little  band that had set forth to found an empire of slaves, staggered across  the line and surrendered to the forces of the United States.    Of this expedition James Jeffrey Roche says, in his \"Byways of War,\"  which is of all books published about Walker the most intensely and  fascinatingly interesting and complete: \"Years afterward the peon  herdsman or prowling Cocupa Indian in the mountain by-paths stumbled  over the bleaching skeleton of some nameless one whose resting-place was  marked by no cross or cairn, but the Colts revolver resting beside  his bones spoke his country and his occupation--the only relic of the  would-be conquistadores of the nineteenth century.\"    Under parole to report to General Wood, commanding the Department of the  Pacific, the filibusters were sent by sailing vessel to San Francisco,  where their leader was tried for violating the neutrality laws of the  United States, and acquitted.    Walker's first expedition had ended in failure, but for him it had been  an opportunity of tremendous experience, as active service is the best  of all military academies, and for the kind of warfare he was to wage,  the best preparation. Nor was it inglorious, for his fellow survivors,  contrary to the usual practice, instead of in bar-rooms placing the  blame for failure upon their leader, stood ready to fight one and all  who doubted his ability or his courage. Later, after five years, many of  these same men, though ten to twenty years his senior, followed him to  death, and never questioned his judgment nor his right to command.    At this time in Nicaragua there was the usual revolution. On the  south the sister republic of Costa Rica was taking sides, on the north  Honduras was landing arms and men. There was no law, no government. A  dozen political parties, a dozen commanding generals, and not one strong  man.    In the editorial rooms of the San Francisco _Herald_, Walker, searching  the map for new worlds to conquer, rested his finger upon Nicaragua.    In its confusion of authority he saw an opportunity to make himself  a power, and in its tropical wealth and beauty, in the laziness and  incompetence of its inhabitants, he beheld a greater, fairer, more kind  Sonora. On the Pacific side from San Francisco he could re-enforce his  army with men and arms; on the Caribbean side from New Orleans he could,  when the moment arrived, people his empire with slaves.    The two parties at war in Nicaragua were the Legitimists and the  Democrats. Why they were at war it is not necessary to know. Probably  Walker did not know; it is not likely that they themselves knew. But  from the leader of the Democrats Walker obtained a contract to bring  to Nicaragua three hundred Americans, who were each to receive several  hundred acres of land, and who were described as \"colonists liable to  military duty.\" This contract Walker submitted to the Attorney-General  of the State and to General Wood, who once before had acquitted him of  filibustering; and neither of these Federal officers saw anything  which seemed to give them the right to interfere. But the rest of San  Francisco was less credulous, and the \"colonists\" who joined Walker  had a very distinct idea that they were not going to Nicaragua to plant  coffee or to pick bananas.    In May, 1855, just a year after Walker and his thirty-three followers  had surrendered to the United States troops at San Diego, with fifty new  recruits and seven veterans of the former expedition he sailed from  San Francisco in the brig _Vesta_, and in five weeks, after a weary and  stormy voyage, landed at Realejo. There he was met by representatives of  the Provisional Director of the Democrats, who received the Californians  warmly.    Walker was commissioned a colonel, Achilles Kewen, who had been fighting  under Lopez in Cuba, a lieutenant-colonel, and Timothy Crocker, who had  served under Walker in the Sonora expedition, a major. The corps  was organized as an independent command and was named \"La Falange  Americana.\" At this time the enemy held the route to the Caribbean, and  Walker's first orders were to dislodge him.    Accordingly, a week after landing with his fifty-seven Americans and one  hundred and fifty native troops, Walker sailed in the _Vesta_ for Brito,  from which port he marched upon Rivas, a city of eleven thousand people  and garrisoned by some twelve hundred of the enemy.    The first fight ended in a complete and disastrous fiasco. The native  troops ran away, and the Americans surrounded by six hundred of the  Legitimists' soldiers, after defending themselves for three hours behind  some adobe huts, charged the enemy and escaped into the jungle. Their  loss was heavy, and among the killed were the two men upon whom Walker  chiefly depended: Kewen and Crocker. The Legitimists placed the bodies  of the dead and wounded who were still living on a pile of logs and  burned them. After a painful night march, Walker, the next day, reached  San Juan on the coast, and, finding a Costa Rican schooner in port,  seized it for his use. At this moment, although Walker's men were  defeated, bleeding, and in open flight, two \"gringos\" picked up on  the beach of San Juan, \"the Texan Harry McLeod and the Irishman Peter  Burns,\" asked to be permitted to join him.    \"It was encouraging,\" Walker writes, \"for the soldiers to find that  some besides themselves did not regard their fortunes as altogether  desperate, and small as was this addition to their number it gave  increased moral as well as material strength to the command.\"    Sometimes in reading history it would appear as though for success the  first requisite must be an utter lack of humor, and inability to look  upon what one is attempting except with absolute seriousness. With forty  men Walker was planning to conquer and rule Nicaragua, a country with a  population of two hundred and fifty thousand souls and as large as the  combined area of Massachusetts, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire,  and Connecticut. And yet, even seven years later, he records without  a smile that two beach-combers gave his army \"moral and material  strength.\" And it is most characteristic of the man that at the  moment he was rejoicing over this addition to his forces, to maintain  discipline two Americans who had set fire to the houses of the enemy  he ordered to be shot. A weaker man would have repudiated the two  Americans, who, in fact, were not members of the Phalanx, and trusted  that their crimes would not be charged against him. But the success of  Walker lay greatly in his stern discipline. He tried the men, and they  confessed to their guilt. One got away; and, as it might appear that  Walker had connived at his escape, to the second man was shown no  mercy. When one reads how severe was Walker in his punishments, and  how frequently the death penalty was invoked by him against his own  few followers, the wonder grows that these men, as independent and as  unaccustomed to restraint as were those who first joined him, submitted  to his leadership. One can explain it only by the personal quality of  Walker himself.    Among these reckless, fearless outlaws, who, despising their allies,  believed and proved that with his rifle one American could account for a  dozen Nicaraguans, Walker was the one man who did not boast or drink or  gamble, who did not even swear, who never looked at a woman, and who, in  money matters, was scrupulously honest and unself-seeking. In a fight,  his followers knew that for them he would risk being shot just as  unconcernedly as to maintain his authority he would shoot one of them.    Treachery, cowardice, looting, any indignity to women, he punished with  death; but to the wounded, either of his own or of the enemy's forces,  he was as gentle as a nursing sister and the brave and able he rewarded  with instant promotion and higher pay. In no one trait was he a  demagogue. One can find no effort on his part to ingratiate himself with  his men. Among the officers of his staff there were no favorites. He  messed alone, and at all times kept to himself. He spoke little, and  then with utter lack of self-consciousness. In the face of injustice,  perjury, or physical danger, he was always calm, firm, dispassionate.  But it is said that on those infrequent occasions when his anger  asserted itself, the steady steel-gray eyes flashed so menacingly that  those who faced them would as soon look down the barrel of his Colt.    The impression one gets of him gathered from his recorded acts, from his  own writings, from the writings of those who fought with him, is of a  silent, student-like young man believing religiously in his \"star of  destiny\"; but, in all matters that did not concern himself, possessed of  a grim sense of fun. The sayings of his men that in his history of the  war he records, show a distinct appreciation of the Bret Harte school of  humor. As, for instance, when he tells how he wished to make one of them  a drummer boy and the Californian drawled: \"No, thanks, colonel; I never  seen a picture of a battle yet that the first thing in it wasn't a dead  drummer boy with a busted drum.\"    In Walker the personal vanity which is so characteristic of the soldier  of fortune was utterly lacking. In a land where a captain bedecks  himself like a field-marshal, Walker wore his trousers stuffed in his  boots, a civilian's blue frock-coat, and the slouch hat of the period,  with, for his only ornament, the red ribbon of the Democrats. The  authority he wielded did not depend upon braid or buttons, and only when"]]]
