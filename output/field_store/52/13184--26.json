This I emptied, and loaded it again with a good  charge of fine powder mixed with the coarser sort; then I aimed it  exactly at the man in red, elevating prodigiously, because a piece of  that calibre could hardly be expected to carry true at such a distance.  I fired, and hit my man exactly in the middle. He had trussed his sword  in front, [2] for swagger, after a way those Spaniards have; and my  ball, when it struck him, broke upon the blade, and one could see the  fellow cut in two fair halves. The Pope, who was expecting nothing of  this kind, derived great pleasure and amazement from the sight, both  because it seemed to him impossible that one should aim and hit the mark  at such a distance, and also because the man was cut in two, and he  could not comprehend how this should happen. He sent for me, and asked  about it. I explained all the devices I had used in firing; but told him  that why the man was cut in halves, neither he nor I could know. Upon my  bended knees I then besought him to give me the pardon of his blessing  for that homicide; and for all the others I had committed in the castle  in the service of the Church. Thereat the Pope, raising his hand, and  making a large open sign of the cross upon my face, told me that he  blessed me, and that he gave me pardon for all murders I had ever  perpetrated, or should ever perpetrate, in the service of the Apostolic  Church. When I felt him, I went aloft, and never stayed from firing to  the utmost of my power; and few were the shots of mine that missed their  mark. My drawing, and my fine studies in my craft, and my charming art  of music, all were swallowed up in the din of that artillery; and if I  were to relate in detail all the splendid things I did in that infernal  work of cruelty, I should make the world stand by and wonder. But, not  to be too prolix, I will pass them over. Only I must tell a few of the  most remarkable, which are, as it were, forced in upon me.    To begin then: pondering day and night what I could render for my own  part in defence of Holy Church, and having noticed that the enemy  changed guard and marched past through the great gate of Santo Spirito,  which was within a reasonable range, I thereupon directed my attention  to that spot; but, having to shoot sideways, I could not do the damage  that I wished, although I killed a fair percentage every day. This  induced our adversaries, when they saw their passage covered by my guns,  to load the roof of a certain house one night with thirty gabions, which  obstructed the view I formerly enjoyed. Taking better thought than I had  done of the whole situation, I now turned all my five pieces of  artillery directly on the gabions, and waited till the evening hour,  when they changed guard. Our enemies, thinking they were safe, came on  at greater ease and in a closer body than usual; whereupon I set fire to  my blow-pipes, [3] Not merely did I dash to pieces the gabions which  stood in my way; but, what was better, by that one blast I slaughtered  more than thirty men. In consequence of this man&oelig;uvre, which I  repeated twice, the soldiers were thrown into such disorder, that being,  moreover, encumbered with the spoils of that great sack, and some of  them desirous of enjoying the fruits of their labour, they oftentimes  showed a mind to mutiny and take themselves away from Rome. However,  after coming to terms with their valiant captain, Gian di Urbino, [4]  they were ultimately compelled, at their excessive inconvenience, to  take another road when they changed guard. It cost them three miles of  march, whereas before they had but half a mile. Having achieved this  feat, I was entreated with prodigious favours by all the men of quality  who were invested in the castle. This incident was so important that I  thought it well to relate it, before finishing the history of things  outside my art, the which is the real object of my writing: forsooth, if  I wanted to ornament my biography with such matters, I should have far  too much to tell. There is only one more circumstance which, now that  the occasion offers, I propose to record.    Note 1. The Mastio or main body of Hadrians Mausoleum, which was  converted into a fortress during the Middle Ages.    Note 2. 'Saveva messo la spada dinanzi.' Perhaps 'was bearing his sword  in front of him.'    Note 3. 'Soffioni,' the cannon being like tubes to blow a fire up.    Note 4. This captain was a Spaniard, who played a very considerable  figure in the war, distinguishing himself at the capture of Genoa and  the battle of Lodi in 1522, and afterwards acting as Lieutenant-General  to the Prince of Orange. He held Naples against Orazio Baglioni in 1528,  and died before Spello in 1529.    XXXVIII    I SHALL skip over some intervening circumstances, and tell how Pope  Clement, wishing to save the tiaras and the whole collection of the  great jewels of the Apostolic Camera, had me called, and shut himself up  together with me and the Cavalierino in a room alone. [1] This  cavalierino had been a groom in the stable of Filippo Strozzi; he was  French, and a person of the lowest birth; but being a most faithful  servant, the Pope had made him very rich, and confided in him like  himself. So the Pope, the Cavaliere, and I, being shut up together, they  laid before me the tiaras and jewels of the regalia; and his Holiness  ordered me to take all the gems out of their gold settings. This I  accordingly did; afterwards I wrapt them separately up in bits of paper  and we sewed them into the linings of the Popes and the Cavalieres  clothes. Then they gave me all the gold, which weighed about two hundred  pounds, and bade me melt it down as secretly as I was able. I went up to  the Angel, where I had my lodging, and could lock the door so as to be  free from interruption. There I built a little draught-furnace of  bricks, with a largish pot, shaped like an open dish, at the bottom of  it; and throwing the gold upon the coals, it gradually sank through and  dropped into the pan. While the furnace was working I never left off  watching how to annoy our enemies; and as their trenches were less than  a stones-throw right below us, I was able to inflict considerable  damage on them with some useless missiles, [2] of which there were  several piles, forming the old munition of the castle. I chose a swivel  and a falconet, which were both a little damaged in the muzzle, and  filled them with the projectiles I have mentioned. When I fired my guns,  they hurtled down like mad, occasioning all sorts of unexpected mischief  in the trenches. Accordingly I kept these pieces always going at the  same time that the gold was being melted down; and a little before  vespers I noticed some one coming along the margin of the trench on  muleback. The mule was trotting very quickly, and the man was talking to  the soldiers in the trenches. I took the precaution of discharging my  artillery just before he came immediately opposite; and so, making a  good calculation, I hit my mark. One of the fragments struck him in the  face; the rest were scattered on the mule, which fell dead. A tremendous  uproar rose up from the trench; I opened fire with my other piece, doing  them great hurt. The man turned out to be the Prince of Orange, who was  carried through the trenches to a certain tavern in the neighbourhood,  whither in a short while all the chief folk of the army came together.    When Pope Clement heard what I had done, he sent at once to call for me,  and inquired into the circumstance. I related the whole, and added that  the man must have been of the greatest consequence, because the inn to  which they carried him had been immediately filled by all the chiefs of  the army, so far at least as I could judge. The Pope, with a shrewd  instinct, sent for Messer Antonio Santacroce, the nobleman who, as I  have said, was chief and commander of the gunners. He bade him order all  us bombardiers to point our pieces, which were very numerous, in one  mass upon the house, and to discharge them all together upon the signal  of an arquebuse being fired. He judged that if we killed the generals,  the army, which was already almost on the point of breaking up, would  take flight. God perhaps had heard the prayers they kept continually  making, and meant to rid them in this manner of those impious scoundrels.    We put our cannon in order at the command of Santacroce, and waited for  the signal. But when Cardinal Orsini [3] became aware of what was going  forward, he began to expostulate with the Pope, protesting that the  thing by no means ought to happen, seeing they were on the point of  concluding an accommodation, and that if the generals were killed, the  rabble of the troops without a leader would storm the castle and  complete their utter ruin. Consequently they could by no means allow the  Popes plan to be carried out. The poor Pope, in despair, seeing himself  assassinated both inside the castle and without, said that he left them  to arrange it. On this, our orders were countermanded; but I, who chafed  against the leash, [4] when I knew that they were coming round to bid me  stop from firing, let blaze one of my demi-cannons, and struck a pillar  in the courtyard of the house, around which I saw a crowd of people  clustering. This shot did such damage to the enemy that it was like to  have made them evacuate the house. Cardinal Orsini was absolutely for  having me hanged or put to death; but the Pope took up my cause with  spirit. The high words that passed between them, though I well know what  they were, I will not here relate, because I make no profession of  writing history. It is enough for me "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4035"],[0,"Greek Studies: a Series of Essays (#19)"],[1,"of Callimachus, but with very different  qualities, is the idyll of Theocritus on the Shepherds' Journey.  Although it is possible to define an epoch in mythological [126]  development in which literary and artificial influences began to  remodel the primitive, popular legend, yet still, among children, and  unchanging childlike people, we may suppose that that primitive stage  always survived, and the old, instinctive influences were still at  work.  As the subject of popular religious celebrations also, the  myth was still the property of the people, and surrendered to its  capricious action.  The shepherds in Theocritus, on their way to  celebrate one of the more homely feasts of Demeter, about the time of  harvest, are examples of these childlike people; the age of the poets  has long since come, but they are of the older and simpler order,  lingering on in the midst of a more self-conscious world.  In an  idyll, itself full of the delightful gifts of Demeter, Theocritus  sets them before us; through the blazing summer day's journey, the  smiling image of the goddess is always before them; and now they have  reached the end of their journey:--    \"So I, and Eucritus, and the fair Amyntichus, turned aside into the  house of Phrasidamus, and lay down with delight in beds of sweet  tamarisk and fresh cuttings from the vines, strewn on the ground.  Many poplars and elm-trees were waving over our heads, and not far  off the running of the sacred water from the cave of the nymphs  warbled to us; in the shimmering branches the sun-burnt grasshoppers  were busy with their talk, and from afar the little owl cried softly,  out of [127] the tangled thorns of the blackberry; the larks were  singing and the hedge-birds, and the turtle-dove moaned; the bees  flew round and round the fountains, murmuring softly; the scent of  late summer and of the fall of the year was everywhere; the pears  fell from the trees at our feet, and apples in number rolled down at  our sides, and the young plum-trees were bent to the earth with the  weight of their fruit.  The wax, four years old, was loosed from the  heads of the wine-jars.  O! nymphs of Castalia, who dwell on the  steeps of Parnassus, tell me, I pray you, was it a draught like this  that the aged Chiron placed before Hercules, in the stony cave of  Pholus?  Was it nectar like this that made the mighty shepherd on  Anapus' shore, Polyphemus, who flung the rocks upon Ulysses' ships,  dance among his sheepfolds?--A cup like this ye poured out now upon  the altar of Demeter, who presides over the threshing-floor.  May it  be mine, once more, to dig my big winnowing-fan through her heaps of  corn; and may I see her smile upon me, holding poppies and handfuls  of corn in her two hands!\"    Some of the modifications of the story of Demeter, as we find it in  later poetry, have been supposed to be due, not to the genuine action  of the Greek mind, but to the influence of that so-called Orphic  literature, which, in the generation succeeding Hesiod, brought, from  Thessaly and Phrygia, a tide of mystical ideas into the Greek [128]  religion, sometimes, doubtless, confusing the clearness and  naturalness of its original outlines, but also sometimes imparting to  them a new and peculiar grace.  Under the influence of this Orphic  poetry, Demeter was blended, or identified, with Rhea Cybele, the  mother of the gods, the wilder earth-goddess of Phrygia; and the  romantic figure of Dionysus Zagreus, Dionysus the Hunter, that most  interesting, though somewhat melancholy variation on the better known  Dionysus, was brought, as son or brother of Persephone, into her  circle, the mystical vine, who, as Persephone descends and ascends  from the earth, is rent to pieces by the Titans every year and  remains long in Hades, but every spring-time comes out of it again,  renewing his youth.  This identification of Demeter with Rhea Cybele  is the motive which has inspired a beautiful chorus in the Helena--  the new Helena--of Euripides, that great lover of all subtle  refinements and modernisms, who, in this play, has worked on a  strange version of the older story, which relates that Helen had  never really gone to Troy at all, but sent her soul only there, apart  from her sweet body, which abode all that time in Egypt, at the court  of King Proteus, where she is found at last by her husband Menelaus,  so that the Trojan war was about a phantom, after all.  The chorus  has even less than usual to do with the action of the play, being  linked to it only by a sort of parallel, which may be understood,  [129] between Menelaus seeking Helen, and Demeter seeking Persephone.  Euripides, then, takes the matter of the Homeric hymn into the region  of a higher and swifter poetry, and connects it with the more  stimulating imagery of the Idaean mother.  The Orphic mysticism or  enthusiasm has been admitted into the story, which is now full of  excitement, the motion of rivers, the sounds of the Bacchic cymbals  heard over the mountains, as Demeter wanders among the woody valleys  seeking her lost daughter, all directly expressed in the vivid Greek  words.  Demeter is no longer the subdued goddess of the quietly-  ordered fields, but the mother of the gods, who has her abode in the  heights of Mount Ida, who presides over the dews and waters of the  white springs, whose flocks feed, not on grain, but on the curling  tendrils of the vine, both of which she withholds in her anger, and  whose chariot is drawn by wild beasts, fruit and emblem of the earth  in its fiery strength.  Not Hecate, but Pallas and Artemis, in full  armour, swift-footed, vindicators of chastity, accompany her in her  search for Persephone, who is already expressly, korê arrêtos+--\"the  maiden whom none may name.\"  When she rests from her long wanderings,  it is into the stony thickets of Mount Ida, deep with snow, that she  throws herself, in her profound grief.  When Zeus desires to end her  pain, the Muses and the \"solemn\" Graces are sent to dance and sing  before her.  It is then [130] that Cypris, the goddess of beauty, and  the original cause, therefore, of her distress, takes into her hands  the brazen tambourines of the Dionysiac worship with their Chthonian  or deep-noted sound; and it is she, not the old Iambe, who with this  wild music, heard thus for the first time, makes Demeter smile at  last.  \"Great,\" so the chorus ends with a picture, \"great is the  power of the stoles of spotted fawn-skins, and the green leaves of  ivy twisted about the sacred wands, and the wheeling motion of the  tambourine whirled round in the air, and the long hair floating  unbound in honour of Bromius, and the nocturns of the goddess, when  the moon looks full upon them.\"    The poem of Claudian on the Rape of Proserpine, the longest extant  work connected with the story of Demeter, yet itself unfinished,  closes the world of classical poetry.  Writing in the fourth century  of the Christian era, Claudian has his subject before him in the  whole extent of its various development, and also profits by those  many pictorial representations of it, which, from the famous picture  of Polygnotus downwards, delighted the ancient world.  His poem,  then, besides having an intrinsic charm, is valuable for some  reflexion in it of those lost works, being itself pre-eminently a  work in colour, and excelling in a kind of painting in words, which  brings its subject very pleasantly almost to the eye of the reader.  The mind of this late votary [131] of the old gods, in a world  rapidly changing, is crowded with all the beautiful forms generated  by mythology, and now about to be forgotten.  In this after-glow of  Latin literature, lighted up long after their fortune had set, and  just before their long night began, they pass before us, in his  verses, with the utmost clearness, like the figures in an actual  procession.  The nursing of the infant Sun and Moon by Tethys;  Proserpine and her companions gathering flowers at early dawn, when  the violets are drinking in the dew, still lying white upon the  grass; the image of Pallas winding the peaceful blossoms about the  steel crest of her helmet; the realm of Proserpine, softened somewhat  by her coming, and filled with a quiet joy; the matrons of Elysium  crowding to her marriage toilet, with the bridal veil of yellow in  their hands; the Manes, crowned with ghostly flowers yet warmed a  little, at the marriage feast; the ominous dreams of the mother; the  desolation of the home, like an empty bird's-nest or an empty fold,  when she returns and finds Proserpine gone, and the spider at work  over her unfinished embroidery; the strangely-figured raiment, the  flowers in the grass, which were once blooming youths, having both  their natural colour and the colour of their poetry in them, and the  clear little fountain there, which was once the maiden Cyane;--all  this is shown in a series of descriptions, like the designs in some  unwinding tapestry, like Proserpine's own [132] embroidery, the  description of which is the most brilliant of these pictures, and, in  its quaint confusion of the images of philosophy with those of  mythology, anticipates something of the fancy of the Italian  Renaissance.    \"Proserpina, filling the house soothingly with her low song, was  working a gift against the return of her mother, with labour all to  be in vain.  In it, she marked out with her needle the houses of the  gods and the series of the elements, showing by what law, nature, the  parent of all, settled the strife of ancient times, and the seeds of  things disparted into their places; the lighter elements are borne  aloft, the heavier fall to the centre; the air grows bright with  heat, a blazing light whirls round the firmament; the sea flows; the  earth hangs suspended in its place.  And there were divers colours in  it; she illuminated the stars with gold, infused a purple shade into  the water, and heightened"]]]
