But he relaxed here in the  presence of his favored courtiers. He was evidently in a high good humor  this night, giving directions for the staging of the spectacle,  despatching messengers. I stood gazing at him. A very kingly fellow  this. There was about him, that strange mingled look of barbarism and  modernity.           *       *       *       *       *    Hope approached him and knelt. Derek and I could hear their voices,  although the babble of the crowd went on.    \"My little Hope, what is it? Stand up, child.\"    She said, \"Your Highness, a message from Blanca.\"    He laughed. \"Say no more! I know it already! She does not want this  festival. The workers,\"--what a world of sardonic contempt he put into  that one word!--\"the workers will be offended because we take pleasure  to-night. Bah!\" But he was still laughing. \"Say no more, little Hope.  Tell Blanca to dance and sing her best this night. I am making my  choice. Did you know that?\"    Hope was silent. He repeated, \"Did you know that?\"    \"Yes, Your Highness,\" she murmured.    \"I choose our queen to-night, child. Blanca or Sensua.\" He sighed. \"Both  are very beautiful. Do you know which one I am going to choose?\"    \"No,\" she said.    \"Nor do I, little Hope. Nor do I.\"    He dismissed her. \"Go now. Don't bother me.\"    She parted her lips as though to make another protest, but his eyes  suddenly flashed.    \"I would not have you annoy me again. Do you understand?\"    She turned away, back toward where Derek and I were lurking. The  chattering crowd in the room had paid no attention to Hope, but before  she could reach us a man detached himself from a nearby group and  accosted her. A commanding figure, he was, I think, quite the largest  man in the room. An inch or two taller than Derek, at the least. He wore  his red cloak with the hood thrown back upon his wide heavy shoulders. A  bullet-head with close-clipped black hair. A man of about the king's  age, he had a face of heavy features, and flashing dark eyes. A  scoundrel adventurer, this king's henchman.    Hope said, \"What is it, Rohbar?\"    \"You will join our party, little Hope?\" He laid a heavy hand on her  white arm. His face was turned toward me. I could not miss the gleaming  look in his eyes as he regarded her.    \"No,\" she said.           *       *       *       *       *    It seemed that he twitched at her, but she broke away from him.    Anger crossed his face, but the desirous look in his eyes remained.    \"You are very bold, Hope, to spurn me like this.\" He had lowered his  voice as though fearful that the king might hear him.    \"Let me alone!\" she said.    She darted away from him, but before she joined us she stood waiting  until he turned away.    \"No use,\" Hope whispered. \"There is nothing we can do here. You heard  what the king said--and the festival is already begun.\"    Derek stood a moment, lost in thought. He was gazing across the room to  where Rohbar was standing with a group of girls. He said at last:    \"Come on, Charlie. We'll watch this festival. This damn fool king will  choose the Red Sensua.\" He shrugged. \"There will be chaos....\"    We shoved our way from the room, went out of the main doorway and  hurried through the gardens of the palace. The red-cloaked figures were  leaving the building now for the festival grounds. We waited for a group  of them to pass so that we might walk alone. As we neared the gate,  passing through the shadows of high flowered shrubs, a vague feeling  that we were being followed shot through me. In a moment there was so  much to see that I forgot it, but I held my hand on my dirk and moved  closer to Hope.    We reached the entrance to the canopy. A group of girls, red-cloaked,  were just coming out. They rushed past us. They ran, discarding their  cloaks. Their white bodies gleamed under the colored lights as they  rushed to the pool and dove.    We were just in time. Hope whispered, \"The king will be here any  moment.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Beneath the canopy was a broad arena of seats. A platform, like a stage,  was at one end. It was brilliantly illuminated with colored torches held  aloft by girls in flowing robes, each standing like a statue with her  light held high. The place was crowded. In the gloom of the darkened  auditorium we found seats off to one side, near the open edge of the  canopy. We sat, with Hope between us.    Derek whispered, \"Shakespeare might have staged a play in a fashion like  this.\"    A primitive theatrical performance. There was no curtain for interlude  between what might have been the acts of a vaudeville. The torch girls,  like pages, ranged themselves in a line across the front of the stage.  They were standing there as we took our seats. The vivid glare of their  torches concealed the stage behind them.    There was a few moments wait, then, amid hushed silence, the king with  his retinue came in. He sat in a canopied box off to one side. When he  was seated, he raised his arm and the buzz of conversation in the  audience began again.    Presently the page girls moved aside from the stage. The buzz of the  audience was stilted. The performance, destined to end so soon in  tragedy, now began.          CHAPTER VII    _The Crimson Murderess_      Hope murmured. \"The three-part music comes first. There will first be  the spiritual.\"    An orchestra was seated on the stage in a semi-circle. It was composed  of men and women musicians, and there seemed to be over a hundred of  them. They sat in three groups; the center group was about to play. In a  solemn hush the leaderless choirs, with all its players garbed in  white, began its first faint note. I craned to get a clear view of the  stage. This white choir seemed almost all wood-wind. There were tiny  pipes in little series such as Pan might have used. Flutes, and  flageolets; and round-bellied little instruments of clay, like ocarinas.  And pitch-pipes, long and slender as a marsh reed.    In a moment I was lost in the music. It began softly, with single muted  notes from a single instrument, echoed by the others, running about the  choir like a will-o'-the-wisp. It was faint, as though very far away,  made more sweet by distance. And then it swelled, came nearer.    I had never heard such music as this. Primitive! It was not that. Nor  barbaric! Nothing like the music of our ancient world. Nor was it what I  might conceive to be the music of our future. A thing apart, unworldly,  ethereal. It swept me, carried me off; it was an exaltation of the  spirit lifting me. It was triumphant now. It surged, but there was in  its rhythm, the beat of its every instrument, nothing but the soul of  purity. And then it shimmered into distance again, faint and exquisite  music of a dream. Crooning, pleading, the speech of whispering angels.    It ceased. There was a storm of applause.    I breathed again. Why, this was what music might be in our world but was  not. I thought of our blaring jazz.    Hope said, \"Now they play the physical music. Then Sensua will dance  with Blanca. We will see then which one the king chooses.\"           *       *       *       *       *    On the stage all the torches were extinguished save those which were  red. The arena was darker than before. The stage was bathed with a deep  crimson. Music of the physical senses! It was, indeed, no more like the  other choir than is the body to the spirit.    There were stringed instruments playing now; deep-toned, singing  zithers, and instruments of rounded, swelling bodies, like great viols  with sensuous, throbbing voices. Music with a swift rhythm, marked by  the thump of hollow gourds. It rose with its voluptuous swell into a  paean of abandonment, and upon the tide of it, the crimson Sensua flung  herself upon the stage. She stood motionless for a moment that all might  regard her. The crimson torchlight bathed her, stained crimson the white  flush of her limbs, her heavy shoulders, her full, rounded throat.    A woman in her late twenties. Voluptuous of figure, with crimson veils  half-hiding, half-revealing it. A face of coarse, sensuous beauty. A  face wholly evil, and it seemed to me wholly debauched. Dark eyes with  beaded lashes. Heavy lips painted scarlet. A pagan woman of the streets.  One might have encountered such a woman swaggering in some ancient  street of some ancient city, flaunting the finery given her by a rich  and profligate eastern prince.    She stood a moment with smoldering, passion-filled eyes, gazing from  beneath her lowered lids. Her glance went to the king's canopy, and  flashed a look of confidence, of triumph. The king answered it with a  smile. He leaned forward over his railing, watching her intently.    With the surge of the music she moved into her dance. Slowly she began,  quite slowly. A posturing and swaying of hips like a nautch girl. She  made the rounds of the musicians, leering at them. She stood in the  whirl of the music, almost ignoring it, stood at the front of the stage  with a gaze of slumberous, insolent passion flung at the king. A knife  was in her hand now. She held it aloft. The red torchlight caught its  naked blade. With shuddering fancy I seemed to see it dripping crimson.  She frowned, and struck it at a phantom lover. She backed away. She  stooped and knelt. She knelt and seemed with her empty arms to be  caressing a murdered lover's head. She kissed him, rained upon his dead  lips her macabre kisses.    And then she was up on her bare feet, again circling the stage. Her  anklets clanked as she moved with the tread of a tigress. The musicians  shrank from her waving blade.           *       *       *       *       *    A girl in white veils was suddenly disclosed standing at the back of the  stage.    Derek whispered, \"Is that Blanca?\"    \"Yes,\" whispered Hope.    Blanca stood watching her rival. The crimson Sensua passed her, took her  suddenly by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41533"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 6 (of 6) (#19)"],[1,"637, d. 1701. _Pascoli._ ii. 251.
