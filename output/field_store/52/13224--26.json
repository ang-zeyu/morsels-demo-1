If we grant       this to be true, we may sum up the conclusion of the argument       as follows: either the laws and opinions of the communities by       which you are surrounded must become subordinate to your       customs and opinions, or, on the other hand, yours must yield       to theirs. The conflict is irrepressible.         \"But no matter whether this anomaly shall disappear or remain       amongst you, it is your duty at least to guard it against       flagrant abuses. That plurality of wives is tolerated and       believed to be right, may not appear so strange; but that a       mother and her daughters are allowed to fulfil the duties of       _wives_ to the same husband, or that a man could be found in       all Christendom who could be induced to take upon himself such       a relationship, is, perhaps, no less a marvel in morals than       in matters of taste.         \"The bare fact that such practices are tolerated amongst you       is sufficient evidence that the human passions, whether       excited by religious fanaticism or otherwise, must be       restrained and subjected to laws, to which all must yield       obedience. No community can long exist, without absolute       social anarchy, unless so important an institution as that of       marriage is regulated by law. It is the basis of our       civilization, and in it the whole question of the descent and       distribution of real and personal estate is involved.         \"Much to my astonishment, I have not been able to find any law       upon the statutes of this Territory regulating marriage. I       earnestly recommend to your early consideration the passage of       some law that will meet the exigencies of the people.           \"_Act of Congress against Polygamy._         \"I respectfully call your attention to an Act of Congress,       passed the 1st day of July, 1862, entitled 'An Act to punish       and prevent the practice of polygamy in the Territories of the       United States, and in other places, and disapproving and       annulling certain Acts of the legislative assembly of Utah,'       (chap. cxxvii. of the Statutes at Large of the last session of       Congress, page 501.) I am aware that there is a prevailing       opinion here that said Act is unconstitutional, and therefore       it is recommended by those in high authority that no regard       whatever should be paid to the same; and still more to be       regretted, if I am rightly informed, in some instances it has       been recommended that it be openly disregarded and defied,       merely to defy the same.         \"I take this occasion to warn the people of this Territory       against such dangerous and disloyal counsels. Whether such Act       is unconstitutional or not, is not necessary for me either to       affirm or deny. The individual citizen, under no       circumstances whatever, has the right to defy any law or       statute of the United States with impunity. In doing so he       takes upon himself the risk of the penalties of that statute,       be they what they may, in case his judgment should be in       error.         \"The Constitution has amply provided how and where all such       questions of doubt are submitted and settled, namely, in the       courts constituted for that purpose. To forcibly resist the       execution of that Act would be, to say the least, a high       misdemeanor; and if a whole community should become involved       in such resistance, would call down upon it the consequences       of insurrection and rebellion.         \"I hope and trust that no such rash counsel will prevail. If,       unhappily, I am mistaken in this, I choose to shut my eyes to       the consequences.           \"_Liberty of Conscience._         \"Amongst the most cherished and sacred rights secured to the       citizen of the United States, is the right to worship God       according to the dictates of conscience. . . .         \"Religion was left a matter between man and his Maker, and not       between man and the Government.         \"But here arises a most important question,--a question       perhaps that has never yet been asked or fully answered in       this country,--How far does the right of conscience extend? Is       there any limit to this right?--and if so, where shall the       line of demarcation be drawn, designating that which is not       forbidden from that which is? This is, indeed, a most       important question, and from the tendency of the times, must       sooner or later be answered. I cannot, and will not, on this       occasion, pretend to answer this question; but will venture       the suggestion, that when it is answered, the same rules will       be adopted as if the freedom of speech and of the press were       involved in the argument.         . . . \"There can be no limit beyond which the mind may not       dwell, and our thoughts soar in our aspirations after truth.       We may think what we will, believe what we will, and speak       what we will, on all subjects of speculative theology. . . .       But when religious opinions assume new manifestations, and       pass from the condition of mere sentiment into overt acts,--no       matter whether they be acts of faith or not,--they must not       outrage the opinions of the civilized world, but, on the       other hand, must conform to those usages established by law,       and which are believed to underlie our very civilization.\"    In the same Message, the Governor, after giving his views upon the  national topics of the day, fully sustaining the Administration and the  war, proceeded to discuss all the more prominent subjects of local  interest in the Territory. He referred to the attempts to procure the  admission of the State of Deseret into the Union,--giving it as his  opinion that those attempts were premature. He referred to provisions of  the Organic Act, and claimed the right to nominate to the Council all  general territorial officers. These had formerly been elected by the  Legislature.    He recommended a thorough revision and codification of the statutes; a  change in the mode of voting; referred to the financial condition of the  Territory; adverted to the Indian troubles; advised the organization of  a common-school system, and closed by assuring them of his willingness  and desire to work with them for the common good and welfare of the  people of the Territory.    The question of polygamy was boldly met and temperately discussed in  this Message, and the people warned against the consequences of  disobedience to the Act of Congress. Anything less than this on the part  of the Governor would have been simply a neglect of duty.    Yet the Mormons were very indignant, and professed to look upon that  portion of the Message as exceedingly hostile and offensive in its  character. Their religion had been attacked by the federal authorities!    It may be well here to remark, for the benefit of the tender-footed upon  this subject, that polygamy is no part of the Mormon religion, so far as  the same has any history, and can be distinguished from the personal  edicts of Brigham Young. It is not only not permitted but explicitly  condemned in the \"Book of Mormon\" and the \"Book of Doctrines and  Covenants,\" which are the Old and New Testaments of Mormonism. This  subject is more fully examined in the last chapter of this work.    From the delivery of this Message, the treatment which the Governor  received at the hands of the Mormons was entirely changed. From respect  it was immediately changed to disrespect and contumely. No contemptuous  treatment was too marked, no indignity was too great, to be heaped upon  him, for this simple performance of his duty as a sworn officer of the  United States Government.    The Message was never printed by the Legislature. The Journals did not  even show that the Governor ever appeared before that body for any  purpose whatever.    The fact that the Message was not published having been communicated to  Washington, a resolution was introduced into the Senate of the United  States on the 16th of January, 1863, instructing the Committee on  Territories to inquire and report whether the publication of the Message  of the Governor of the Territory of Utah to the Territorial Legislature  had been suppressed, and if so by what causes, and what was the Message.    In response to this resolution Mr. Wade, chairman of the Committee, on  the 13th of February, submitted a Report, accompanied by a resolution,  which was adopted, that one thousand copies of the Message be printed,  and sent to the Governor for distribution.    This Report of the Committee was less complimentary to the Mormons than  the Message itself.    The following extracts will indicate the character of the document:--         \"In pursuance of the instruction contained in this resolution,       your committee have the honor to report, that they have       collected all the facts, and taken all the testimony within       their reach,--the substance of which, together with a copy of       the Message, is herewith presented.         \"These sources of information"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/446"],[0,"A Book of Remarkable Criminals (#19)"],[1,"and sleepy. Someone standing at the bar said \"What a shocking  murder that was in Cumberland Street!\" Butler started up, looked  steadily from one to the other of the two men who happened to be in the  room, then sat down again and, taking up a book, appeared to be reading.  More than once he put down the book and kept shifting uneasily in his  chair. After having some supper he got up, paid his reckoning, and left  the hotel.    At half-past three the following morning, about fifteen miles from  Dunedin, on the road to Waikouaiti, two constables met a man whom they  recognised as Butler from a description that had been circulated by the  police. The constables arrested and searched him. They found on him a  pair of opera glasses, the property of Mr. Stamper, whose house had been  burgled and burned down on the morning of the 13th. Of this crime Butler  acknowledged himself to be the perpetrator. Besides the opera glasses  the constables took from Butler two tins of salmon, a purse containing  four shillings and sixpence, a pocket knife, a box of matches, a piece  of candle, and a revolver and cartridges. The prisoner was carrying a  top coat, and was dressed in a dark coat and grey trousers, underneath  which he was wearing a white shirt, an under flannel and a Rob Roy  Crimean shirt. One of the constables noticed that there were marks of  blood on his shirt. Another singular feature in Butler's attire was the  fact that the outer soles of his boots had been recently removed. When  last seen in Dunedin Butler had been wearing a moustache; he was now  clean shaven.    The same evening a remarkable interview took place in the lock-up at  Waikouaiti between Butler and Inspector Mallard. Mallard, who had some  reason for suspecting Butler, bearing in mind their recent conversation,  told the prisoner that he would be charged with the murder in Cumberland  Street. For a few seconds, according to Mallard, the prisoner seemed  terribly agitated and appeared to be choking. Recovering himself  somewhat, he said, \"If for that, you can get no evidence against me; and  if I am hanged for it, I shall be an innocent man, whatever other crimes  I may have committed.\" Mallard replied, \"There is evidence to convict  you--the fire was put out.\" Butler than{sic} said that he would ask  Mallard a question, but, after a pause, decided not to do so. Mallard,  after examining Butler's clothes, told him that those were not the  clothes in which he had left the Scotia Hotel. Butler admitted it, and  said he had thrown those away in the North East Valley. Mallard alluded  to the disappearance of the prisoner's moustache. Butler replied that he  had cut it off on the road. Mallard noticed then the backs of Butler's  hands were scratched, as if by contact with bushes. Butler seemed often  on the point of asking questions, but would then stop and say \"No, I  won't ask you anything.\" To the constables who had arrested him Butler  remarked, \"You ought to remember me, because I could have shot you if I  had wished.\" When Mallard later in the evening visited Butler again, the  prisoner who was then lying down said, \"I want to speak to you. I want  to ask the press not to publish my career. Give me fair play. I suppose  I shall be convicted and you will see I can die like a man.\"    A few days after Butler's arrest a ranger on the Town Belt, a hill  overlooking Dunedin, found a coat, a hat and silk striped cravat, and  a few days later a pair of trousers folded up and placed under a bush.  These articles of clothing were identified as those which Butler  had been seen wearing on the Saturday and Sunday morning. They were  examined. There were a number of bloodstains on them, not one of them  larger in size than a pea, some almost invisible. On the front of the  trousers about the level of the groin there were blood spots on both  sides. There was blood on the fold of the left breast of the coat and on  the lining of the cuff of the right arm. The shirt Butler was wearing  at the time of his arrest was examined also. There were small spots of  blood, about fourteen altogether, on the neck and shoulder bands, the  right armpit, the left sleeve, and on both wristbands. Besides the  clothes, a salmon tin was found on the Town Belt, and behind a seat in  the Botanical Gardens, from which a partial view of the Dewars' house  in Cumberland Street could be obtained, two more salmon tins were found,  all three similar to the five purchased by Butler on the Sunday morning,  two of which had been in his possession at the time of his arrest.    Such were the main facts of the case which Butler had to answer when,  a few weeks later, he was put on his trial before the Supreme Court at  Dunedin. The presiding judge was Mr. Justice Williams, afterwards Sir  Joshua Williams and a member of the Privy Council. The Crown Prosecutor,  Mr. Haggitt, conducted the case for the Crown, and Butler defended  himself.      II    THE TRIAL OF BUTLER      To a man of Butler's egregious vanity his trial was a glorious  opportunity for displaying his intellectual gifts, such as they were.  One who had known him in prison about this time describes him as a  strange compound of vanity and envy, blind to his own faults and envious  of the material advantages enjoyed by others. Self-willed and arrogant,  he could bully or whine with equal effect. Despising men, he believed  that if a man did not possess some requisite quality, he had only to ape  it, as few would distinguish between the real and the sham.    But with all these advantages in the struggle for life, it is certain  that Butler's defence would have been far less effective had be{sic}  been denied all professional aid. As a matter of fact, throughout his  trial Butler was being advised by three distinguished members of the New  Zealand bar, now judges of the Supreme Court, who though not appearing  for him in court, gave him the full benefit of their assistance  outside it. At the same time Butler carried off the thing well. Where  imagination was required, Butler broke down; he could not write sketches  of life in prison; that was too much for his pedestrian intellect. But  given the facts of a case, dealing with a transaction of which he alone  knew the real truth, and aided by the advice and guidance of trained  intellects, Butler was unquestionably clever and shrewd enough to make  the best use of such advantages in meeting the case against him.    Thus equipped for the coming struggle, this high-browed ruffian, with  his semi-intellectual cast of countenance, his jerky restless posturing,  his splay-footed waddle, \"like a lame Muscovy duck,\" in the graphic  words of his gaol companion, stood up to plead for his life before the  Supreme Court at Dunedin.    It may be said at the outset that Butler profited greatly by the  scrupulous fairness shown by the Crown Prosecutor. Mr. Haggitt extended  to the prisoner a degree of consideration and forbearance, justified  undoubtedly towards an undefended prisoner. But, as we have seen, Butler  was not in reality undefended. At every moment of the trial he was in  communication with his legal advisers, and being instructed by them how  to meet the evidence given against him. Under these circumstances the  unfailing consideration shown him by the Crown Prosecutor seems almost  excessive. From the first moment of the trial Butler was fully alive  to the necessities of his situation. He refrained from including in his  challenges of the jury the gentleman who was afterwards foreman; he knew  he was all right, he said, because he parted his hair in the middle, a  \"softy,\" in fact. He did not know in all probability that one gentleman  on the jury had a rooted conviction that the murder of the Dewars was  the work of a criminal lunatic. There was certainly nothing in Butler's  demeanour or behaviour to suggest homicidal mania.    The case against Butler rested on purely circumstantial evidence.    No new facts of importance were adduced at the trial. The stealing  of Dewar's wages, which had been paid to him on the Saturday, was the  motive for the murder suggested by the Crown. The chief facts pointing  to Butler's guilt were: his conversation with Mallard and Bain previous  to the crime; his demeanour after it; his departure from Dunedin; the  removal of his moustache and the soles of his boots; his change of  clothes and the bloodstains found upon them, added to which was  his apparent inability to account for his movements on the night in  question.    Such as the evidence was, Butler did little to shake it in  cross-examination. His questions were many of them skilful and pointed,  but on more than one occasion the judge intervened to save him from the  danger common to all amateur cross-examiners, of not knowing when to  stop. He was most successful in dealing with the medical witnesses.  Butler had explained the bloodstains on his clothes as smears that had  come from scratches on his hands, caused by contact with bushes. This  explanation the medical gentlemen with good reason rejected. But they  went further, and said that these stains might well have been caused by  the spurting and spraying of blood on to the murderer as he struck his  victims. Butler was able to show by the position of the bloodstains on  the clothes that such an explanation was open to considerable doubt.    Butler's speech in his defence lasted six hours, and was a creditable  performance. Its arrangement is somewhat confused and repetitious, some  points are over-elaborated, but on the whole he deals very successfully  with most of the evidence given against him and exposes the  unquestionable weakness of the Crown case. At the outset he declared  that he had taken his innocence for his defence. \"I was not willing,\"  he said, \"to leave my life in the hands of a stranger. I was willing to  incur all the disadvantages which the knowledge of the law might bring  upon me. I was willing, also,"]]]
