This charge the Whigs vehemently denied and in turn accused the  Democrats with having made it to influence the Mormon vote in favor of  themselves. Thus crimination and recrimination went on, and whichever  party the people of Nauvoo voted for, they were sure to incur the wrath  of the other.    The Prophet Joseph kept his pledge with Cyrus Walker and voted for him,  but the Democratic ticket was overwhelmingly successful in Nauvoo, and  in the county and district. As soon as the result was made known the  disappointed candidates and their friends were enraged. They began  plotting against the people of Nauvoo, and started an agitation that  had for its object the expulsion of the Saints from the state. Public  meetings were called and committees appointed to correspond with  surrounding counties to ascertain how much assistance they would render  in expelling the Mormons from the state.    No effort whatever was made to conceal their intentions. The banishment  of the citizens of Nauvoo from the state was openly discussed and  advocated in public meetings and through the press. Bitter fruit, this,  to be found growing on the tree of liberty, in the land of the free--in  the asylum for the oppressed of all nations!        CHAPTER XIII.    AN IMPORTANT YEAR--APOSTATES--AGITATION OF THE MORMON QUESTION--THE  NAUVOO \"EXPOSITOR\"--ITS SUPPRESSION--EFFECT OF SUPPRESSION--GOVERNOR  FORD'S ORDER--NAUVOO UNDER MARTIAL LAW.    We have now reached the eventful year of 1844, the year of the great  tragedy, the martyrdom of the Prophets Joseph and Hyrum Smith--a  martyrdom which Elder Taylor shared.    The situation of the Saints at that time was, to say the least,  remarkable. Besides the arch fiend Bennett, the Church had warmed  within her bosom a number of other snakes that turned and stung her.  Among these was William Law, Counselor to the Prophet Joseph, and yet  his most bitter maligner and enemy. A smooth, dissembling villain! The  kind that can look like the innocent flower and yet be the serpent  under it. Not only was he guilty of the grossest immorality, but  he conspired with assassins from Missouri, to take the life of the  Prophet; and even conducted them himself to the house of Joseph. They  were only prevented from accomplishing the foul murder that was in  their hearts, by the faithfulness of two guards, Josiah Arnold and  David Garn, who refused to admit them to the Prophet's presence.    Second to him in treachery and villainy was his natural brother,  Wilson Law, a general in the Nauvoo Legion. Dr. R. D. Foster, a man  not only inclined to profligacy, but one who had the means to indulge  his inclination to the top of his bent, as he was wealthy. Besides  these men there were the two Higbees, Francis and Chauncy, the latter a  young lawyer. They were both sons of Judge Elias Higbee, a man highly  respected by the Church for his upright life and sterling integrity.  All the above named apostates were excommunicated from the Church for  their wickedness, chiefly for seduction and adultery; and so abandoned  and shameful were their crimes that the High Council which tried them  had to sit with closed doors. Besides these leaders in wickedness  there were a large number of apostates in Nauvoo and vicinity that had  been expelled from the Church. They were recreant to every principle  of righteousness, and full of bitterness. Fitful anger rankled in  their breasts. They seemed to have lost the power to repent, and even  the desire for forgiveness. They were possessed wholly with a fierce  determination to destroy the structure--the Church--where in the days  of their righteousness they were wont to find spiritual repose.    In addition to these enemies, the sectarian religionists, maddened to  frenzy because unable to cope successfully with Mormonism, stood ready  to persecute to the death those whom they could not convert. Then  there were the two political parties, Whigs and Democrats, so equally  balanced that whichever party the Saints voted with gained the victory.  It often happened that candidates for office made an issue of the  Mormon question--promising to exterminate them, or lend their influence  to that end if elected. As often as this was done the Saints were  compelled in self-defense to vote against them, and their opponents  were generally defeated. But whichever party the Saints voted with the  other was sure to be offended, and would heap unstinted abuse on their  uncovered heads, filling their press with accounts of \"the enormities  of Nauvoo, and of the awful wickedness of a party which would consent  to receive the support of such miscreants.\"    There was also another class of people that did no end of mischief  to the character of the Saints at Nauvoo. They were counterfeiters,  horse-thieves, cut-throats and all-round scoundrels, which not only  infested Nauvoo and vicinity, but the whole western country. \"In some  districts\", says Elder Taylor, \"their influence was so great as to  control important state and county offices.\" Of these Governor Ford  bears witness, saying--    \"Then again, the northern part of the state was not destitute of  its organized bands of rogues, engaged in murders, robberies,  horse-stealing, and in making and passing counterfeit money. These  rogues were scattered all over the north, but most of them were located  in the counties of Ogle, Winnebago, Lee and DeKalb.\" [1]    They extended into other counties, however, and even judges, sheriffs,  constables, jailors and professional men were privy to their deeds and  sharers in the fruits of their robberies. \"Their object in persecuting  the Mormons,\" says Elder Taylor--and these characters did persecute  them--\"was in part to cover their own rascality, and in part to prevent  the people of Nauvoo from exposing and prosecuting them; but the  principal reason was plunder, believing if the Saints could be removed  or driven they would be made fat on Mormon spoils, besides having in  the deserted city a good asylum for the prosecution of their diabolical  pursuits.\"    All these elements found it convenient to combine against the Church  for its destruction, the overthrow of the Prophet and those who stood  near him. A regular system of agitation was began, having for its  avowed object the extermination of the Saints from the city founded  by their industry. Meetings were held in various parts of Hancock  and surrounding counties, at which speeches the most intemperate,  resolutions the most inflammatory, and accusations the most vile and  false were fulminated against Nauvoo and her inhabitants. The press  supported the actions of these meetings, publishing their proceedings,  and encouraging them by commendatory comments. Especially was this the  case with the _Warsaw Signal_, edited by one Thomas Sharp, whom Elder  Taylor alludes to as \"a violent, unprincipled man, who shrunk not at  any enormity.\"    Such were the elements that combined against the peace of Nauvoo and  the destruction of her leading citizens. Seeing mischief afoot and an  ever growing popular sentiment against the Mormons and in favor of the  reckless, not to say lawless, course of the anti-Mormon agitators, the  apostates in Nauvoo ventured to publish the most infamous sheet ever  issued from the press--the _Nauvoo Expositor_. Its mendacious slanders  were aimed at the most prominent and virtuous of Nauvoo's citizens. No  sooner did it appear than a storm of indignation passed through the  city; and the people threatened to annihilate it. Wishing to avoid any  unlawful procedure, the city council was convened to consider what  steps should be taken to suppress the unclean and untruthful thing.    The _Expositor_ was produced and read in the council. It was held by  some that the purpose for which it was published was to provoke the  people to some overt act which would make them amenable to the law, and  increase the bitterness of the outside prejudice against them. This was  doubtless the case. Such it seems was the understanding of the council.  In relation to this circumstance Elder Taylor remarks:    \"With a perfect knowledge, therefore, of the designs of these infernal  scoundrels who were in our midst, as well as those who surrounded us,  the city council entered upon an investigation of the matter. They felt  that they were in a critical position, and that any move made for the  abating of that press would be looked upon, or at least represented,  as a direct attack upon the liberty of speech, and that, so far from  displeasing our enemies, it would be looked upon by them as one of  the best circumstances that could transpire to assist them in their  nefarious and bloody designs.\"    After spending nearly a whole night in considering the best plan to  pursue, it was finally decided to declare the _Expositor_ a nuisance,  and order its abatement. Elder Taylor made the motion and it was  carried unanimously, with the exception of one vote, and that person  acknowledged the righteousness of the movement, but feared it would  afford the enemies of the city too great an advantage by giving some  ground for the cry that would be raised, that the freedom of the  press had been overthrown in Nauvoo. It is quite certain, however,  that if the city council had not taken this means of suppressing the  _Expositor_, the citizens would have risen _en masse_ and a mob would  have destroyed it: and that would have given the enemies of the Saints  as good ground for agitation against Nauvoo and her people as the  action of the city council did. So Elder Taylor's motion prevailed.    The _Expositor_ Press was destroyed by the city marshal, John P. Green,  and a small _posse_ of men he called to his assistance."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4532"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Photo Telephone or the Picture That Saved a Fortune (#19)"],[1,"mistaken he will go to a telephone near where he  was to-day. He knows that was safe, since we didn't capture him,  and he's very likely to come back.\"    \"But to make the thing as sure as possible, I'm going to attach my  apparatus to a number of public telephones in the vicinity of the  one near the sawmill. So if the fellow doesn't get caught in one,  he will in another. I admit it's taking a chance; but what else  can we do?\"    \"I suppose you're right, Tom. It's like setting a number of  traps.\"    \"Exactly. A trapper can't be sure where he is going to get his  catch, so he picks out the place, or run-way, where the game has  been in the habit of coming. He hides his traps about that place,  and trusts to luck that the animal will blunder into one of them.\"    \"Criminals, to my way of thinking, are a good bit like animals.  They seem to come back to their old haunts. Nearly any police  story proves this. And it's that on which I am counting to capture  this criminal. So I'm going to fit up as many telephones with my  photo and phonograph outfit, as I can in the time we have. You'll  have to help me. Luckily I've got plenty of selenium plates for  the sending end. I'll only need one at the receiving end. Now  we'll have to go and have a talk with the telephone manager, after  which we'll get busy.\"    \"You've overlooked one thing, Tom.\"    \"What's that, Ned?\"    \"Why, if you know about which telephone this fellow is going to  use, why can't you have police stationed near it to capture him as  soon as he begins to talk?\"    \"Well, I did think of that, Ned; but it won't work.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Because, in the first place this man, or some of his friends,  will be on the watch. When he goes into the place to telephone  there'll be a look-out, I'm sure, and he'd either put off talking  to Mrs. Damon, or he'd escape before we had any evidence against  him.\"    \"You see I've got to get evidence that will stand in the courts to  convict this fellow, and if he's scared off before we get that,  the game will be up.\"    \"That's what my photo telephone will do--it will get the evidence,  just as a dictaphone does. In fact, I'm thinking of working it out  on those lines, after I clear up this business.\"    \"Just suppose we had detectives stationed at all the telephones  near the sawmill, where this fellow would be likely to go. In the  first place no one has seen him, as far as we know, so there's no  telling what sort of a chap he is. And you can't go up to a  perfect stranger and arrest him because you think he is the man  who has spirited away Mr. Damon.\"    \"Another thing. Until this fellow has talked, and made his offer  to Mrs. Damon, to restore her husband, in exchange for certain  papers, we have no hold over him.\"    \"But he has done that, Tom. You heard him, and you have his voice  down on the wax cylinder.\"    \"Yes, but I haven't had a glimpse of his face. That's what I want,  and what I'm going to get. Suppose he does go into the telephone  booth, and tell Mrs. Damon an address where she is to send the  papers. Even if a detective was near at hand he might not catch  what was said. Or, if he did, on what ground could he arrest a man  who, very likely, would be a perfect stranger to him? The  detective couldn't say: 'I take you into custody for telephoning  an address to Mrs. Damon.' That, in itself, is no crime.\"    \"No, I suppose not,\" admitted Ned. \"You've got this all thought  out, Tom.\"    \"I hope I have. You see it takes quite a combination to get  evidence against a criminal--evidence that will convict him.  That's why I have to be so careful in setting my trap.\"    \"I see, Tom. Well, it's about time for us to get busy; isn't it?\"    \"It sure is. There's lots to do. First we'll go see the telephone  people.\"    Tom explained to the 'phone manager the necessity for what he was  about to do. The manager at once agreed to let the young inventor  have a free hand. He was much interested in the photo telephone,  and Tom promised to give his company a chance to use it on their  lines, later.    The telephone near the sawmill was easily located. It was in a  general store, and the instrument was in a booth. To this  instrument Tom attached his sending plate, and he also substituted  for the ordinary incandescent light, a powerful tungsten one, that  would give illumination enough to cause the likeness to be  transmitted over the wire.    The same thing was done to a number of the public telephones in  that vicinity, each one being fitted up so that the picture of  whoever talked would be transmitted over the wire when Tom turned  the switch. To help the plan further the telephone manager marked  a number of other 'phones, \"Out of Order,\" for the time being.    \"Now, I think we're done!\" exclaimed the young inventor, with a  sigh, late that night. He and Ned and the line manager had worked  hard.    \"Yes,\" answered the young banker, \"the traps are set. The question  is: Will our rat be caught?\"            CHAPTER XXI    THE PHOTO TELEPHONE      Tom Swift was taking, as he afterward confessed, \"a mighty big  chance.\" But it seemed the only way. He was working against  cunning men, and had to be as cunning as they.    True, the man he hoped to capture, through the combination of his  photo telephone and the phonograph, might go to some other  instrument than one of those Tom had adjusted. But this could not  be helped. In all he had put his new attachment on eight 'phones  in the vicinity of the sawmill. So he had eight chances in his  favor, and as many against him as there were other telephones in  use.    \"It's a mighty small margin in our favor,\" sighed Tom.    \"It sure is,\" agreed Ned. They were at Mrs. Damon's house,  waiting for the call to come in.    \"But we couldn't do anything else,\" went on Tom.    \"No,\" spoke Ned, \"and I have a great deal of hope in the  proverbial Swift luck, Tom.\"    \"Well, I only hope it holds good this time!\" laughed the young  inventor.    \"There are a good many things that can go wrong,\" observed Ned.  \"The least little slip-up may spoil your traps, Tom.\"    \"I know it, Ned. But I've got to take the chance. We've just got  to do something for Mrs. Damon. She's wearing herself out by  worrying,\" he added in a low voice, for indeed the wife of his  friend felt the absence of her husband greatly. She had lost  flesh, she ate scarcely anything, and her nights were wakeful ones  of terror.    \"What if this fails?\" asked Ned.    \"Then I'm going to work that button clue to the limit,\" replied  Tom. \"I'll go to Boylan and see what he and Peters have to say.\"    \"If you'd done as I suggested you'd have gone to them first,\"  spoke Ned. \"You'll find they're mixed up in this.\"    \"Maybe; but I doubt it. I tell you there isn't a clue leading to  Peters--as yet.\"    \"But there will be,\" insisted Ned. \"You'll see that that I'm right  this time.\"    \"I can't see it, Ned. As a matter of fact, I would have gone to  Boylan about that button I found in my airship only I've been so  busy on this photo telephone, and in arranging the trap, that I  haven't had time. But if this fails--and I'm hoping it won't--I'll  get after him,\" and there was a grim look on the young inventor's  face.    It was wearying and nervous work--this waiting. Tom and Ned felt  the strain as they sat there in Mrs. Damon's library, near the  telephone. It had been fitted up in readiness. Attached to the  receiving wires was a sensitive plate, on which Tom hoped would be  imprinted the image of the man at the other end of the wire--the  criminal who, in exchange for the valuable land papers, would give  Mr. Damon his liberty.    There was also the phonograph cylinder to record the man's voice.  Several times, while waiting for the call to come in, Tom got up  to test the apparatus. It was in perfect working order.    As before, there was an extension telephone, so that Mrs. Damon  could talk to the unknown, while Tom could hear as well. But he  planned to take no part in the conversation unless something  unforeseen occurred.    Mr. Damon was an enthusiastic photographer, and he had a dark room  adjoining his library. It was in this dark room that Tom planned  to develop the photo telephone plate.    On this occasion he was not going to use the metal plate in which,  ordinarily, the image of the person talking appeared. That record  was but a fleeting one, as in a mirror. This time Tom wanted a  permanent picture that could, if necessary, be used in a court of  justice.    Tom's plan was this: If the person who had demanded the papers  came to one of the photo telephones, and spoke to Mrs. Damon, Tom  would switch on the receiving apparatus. Thus, while the man was  talking, his picture would be taken, though he would not know of  the thing being done.    His voice would also be recorded on the wax cylinder, and he would  be equally unaware of this.    When Tom had imprinted the fellow's image on the prepared plate,  he would go quickly to the dark room and develop it. A wet print  could be made, and with this as evidence, and to use in  identification, a quick trip could be made to the place whence the  man had telephoned. Tom hoped thus to capture him.    To this end he had his airship in waiting, and as soon as he had  developed the picture he planned to rush off to the vicinity of  the sawmill, and make a prisoner of the man whose features would  be revealed to him over the wire.    It was a hazardous plan--a risky one--but it was the best that he  could evolve. Tom had instructed Mrs. Damon to keep the man in  conversation as long as possible, in order to give the young  inventor himself time to rush off in his airship. But of course  the man might get suspicious and leave. That was another chance  that had to be taken.    \"If I had thought of it in time,\" said Tom, musingly, as he paced  up and down in the library waiting for the 'phone to ring, \"if I  had thought of it in time I would have rigged up two"]]]
