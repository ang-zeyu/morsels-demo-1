In the face of it she did not know  how to answer him. Yet somehow she gathered courage in the knowledge.    Kells stood silent a long moment, looking out at the green slope. And  then, as if speaking to himself, he said: \"I stacked the deck and dealt  myself a hand--a losing hand--and now I've got to play it!\"    With that he turned to Joan. It was the piercing gaze he bent upon her  that hastened her decision to resume the part she had to play. And she  dropped the blanket. Kells's gloom and that iron hardness vanished.  He smiled as she had never seen him smile. In that and his speechless  delight she read his estimate of her appearance; and, notwithstanding  the unwomanliness of her costume, and the fact of his notorious  character, she knew she had never received so great a compliment.  Finally he found his voice.    \"Joan, if you're not the prettiest thing I ever saw in my life!\"    \"I can't get used to this outfit,\" said Joan. \"I can't--I won't go away  from this room in it.\"    \"Sure you will. See here, this'll make a difference, maybe. You're so  shy.\"    He held out a wide piece of black felt that evidently he had cut from a  sombrero. This he measured over her forehead and eyes, and then taking  his knife he cut it to a desired shape. Next he cut eyeholes in it and  fastened to it a loop made of a short strip of buckskin.    \"Try that.... Pull it down--even with your eyes. There!--take a look at  yourself.\"    Joan faced the mirror and saw merely a masked stranger. She was no  longer Joan Randle. Her identity had been absolutely lost.    \"No one--who ever knew me--could recognize me now,\" she murmured, and  the relieving thought centered round Jim Cleve.    \"I hadn't figured on that,\" replied Kells. \"But you're right.... Joan,  if I don't miss my guess, it won't be long till you'll be the talk of  mining-towns and camp-fires.\"    This remark of Kells's brought to Joan proof of his singular pride in  the name he bore, and proof of many strange stories about bandits and  wild women of the border. She had never believed any of these stories.  They had seemed merely a part of the life of this unsettled wild  country. A prospector would spend a night at a camp-fire and tell a  weird story and pass on, never to be seen there again. Could there have  been a stranger story than her life seemed destined to be? Her mind  whirled with vague, circling thought--Kells and his gang, the wild  trails, the camps, and towns, gold and stage-coaches, robbery, fights,  murder, mad rides in the dark, and back to Jim Cleve and his ruin.    Suddenly Kells stepped to her from behind and put his arms around her.  Joan grew stiff. She had been taken off her guard. She was in his arms  and could not face him.    \"Joan, kiss me,\" he whispered, with a softness, a richer, deeper note in  his voice.    \"No!\" cried Joan, violently.    There was a moment of silence in which she felt his grasp slowly  tighten--the heave of his breast.    \"Then I'll make you,\" he said. So different was the voice now that  another man might have spoken. Then he bent her backward, and, freeing  one hand, brought it under her chin and tried to lift her face.    But Joan broke into fierce, violent resistance. She believed she was  doomed, but that only made her the fiercer, the stronger. And with her  head down, her arms straining, her body hard and rigidly unyielding  she fought him all over the room, knocking over the table and seats,  wrestling from wall to wall, till at last they fell across the bed and  she broke his hold. Then she sprang up, panting, disheveled, and backed  away from him. It had been a sharp, desperate struggle on her part and  she was stronger than he. He was not a well man. He raised himself and  put one hand to his breast. His face was haggard, wet, working with  passion, gray with pain. In the struggle she had hurt him, perhaps  reopened his wound.    \"Did you--knife me--that it hurts so?\" he panted, raising a hand that  shook.    \"I had--nothing.... I just--fought,\" cried Joan, breathlessly.    \"You hurt me--again--damn you! I'm never free--from pain. But this's  worse.... And I'm a coward.... And I'm a dog, too! Not half a man!--You  slip of a girl--and I couldn't--hold you!\"    His pain and shame were dreadful for Joan to see, because she felt sorry  for him, and divined that behind them would rise the darker, grimmer  force of the man. And she was right, for suddenly he changed. That  which had seemed almost to make him abject gave way to a pale and bitter  dignity. He took up Dandy Dale's belt, which Joan had left on the bed,  and, drawing the gun from its sheath, he opened the cylinder to see if  it was loaded, and then threw the gun at Joan's feet.    \"There! Take it--and make a better job this time,\" he said.    The power in his voice seemed to force Joan to pick up the gun.    \"What do--you mean?\" she queried, haltingly.    \"Shoot me again! Put me out of my pain--my misery.... I'm sick of it  all. I'd be glad to have you kill me!\"    \"Kells!\" exclaimed Joan, weakly.    \"Take your chance--now--when I've no strength--to force you.... Throw  the gun on me.... Kill me!\"    He spoke with a terrible impelling earnestness, and the strength of his  will almost hypnotized Joan into execution of his demand.    \"You are mad,\" she said. \"I don't want to kill you. I couldn't.... I  just want you to--to be--decent to me.\"    \"I have been--for me. I was only in fun this time--when I grabbed you.  But the FEEL of you!... I can't be decent any more. I see things clear  now.... Joan Randle, it's my life or your soul!\"    He rose now, dark, shaken, stripped of all save the truth.    Joan dropped the gun from nerveless grasp.    \"Is that your choice?\" he asked hoarsely.    \"I can't murder you!\"    \"Are you afraid of the other men--of Gulden? Is that why you can't kill  me? You're afraid to be left--to try to get away?\"    \"I never thought of them.\"    \"Then--my life or your soul!\"    He stalked toward her, loomed over her, so that she put out trembling  hands. After the struggle a reaction was coming to her. She was  weakening. She had forgotten her plan.    \"If you're merciless--then it must be--my soul,\" she whispered. \"For I  CAN'T murder you.... Could you take that gun now--and press it here--and  murder ME?\"    \"No. For I love you.\"    \"You don't love me. It's a blacker crime to murder the soul than the  body.\"    Something in his strange eyes inspired Joan with a flashing, reviving  divination. Back upon her flooded all that tide of woman's subtle  incalculable power to allure, to charge, to hold. Swiftly she went  close to Kells. She stretched out her hands. One was bleeding from rough  contract with the log wall during the struggle. Her wrists were red,  swollen, bruised from his fierce grasp.    \"Look! See what you've done. You were a beast. You made me fight like a  beast. My hands were claws--my whole body one hard knot of muscle. You  couldn't hold me--you couldn't kiss me.... Suppose you ARE able to hold  me--later. I'll only be the husk of a woman. I'll just be a cold shell,  doubled-up, unrelaxed, a callous thing never to yield.... All that's  ME, the girl, the woman you say you love--will be inside, shrinking,  loathing, hating, sickened to death. You will only kiss--embrace--a  thing you've degraded. The warmth, the sweetness, the quiver, the  thrill, the response, the life--all that is the soul of a woman and  makes her lovable will be murdered.\"    Then she drew still closer to Kells, and with all the wondrous subtlety  of a woman in a supreme moment where a life and a soul hang in the  balance, she made of herself an absolute contrast to the fierce, wild,  unyielding creature who had fought him off.    \"Let me show--you the difference,\" she whispered, leaning to him,  glowing, soft, eager, terrible, with her woman's charm. \"Something tells  me--gives me strength.... What MIGHT be!... Only barely possible--if  in my awful plight--you turned out to be a man, good instead of bad!...  And--if it were possible--see the differences--in the woman.... I show  you--to save my soul!\"    She gave the fascinated Kells her hands, slipped into his arms, to  press against his breast, and leaned against him an instant, all one  quivering, surrendered body; and then lifting a white face, true in  its radiance to her honest and supreme purpose to give him one fleeting  glimpse of the beauty and tenderness and soul of love, she put warm and  tremulous lips to his.    Then she fell away from him, shrinking and terrified. But he stood there  as if something beyond belief had happened to him, and the evil of his  face, the hard lines, the brute softened and vanished in a light of  transformation.    \"My God!\" he breathed softly. Then he awakened as if from a trance,  and, leaping down the steps, he violently swept aside the curtain and  disappeared.    Joan threw herself upon the bed and spent the last of her strength in  the relief of blinding tears. She had won. She believed she need never  fear Kells again. In that one moment of abandon she had exalted him. But  at what cost!          10    Next day, when Kells called Joan out into the other cabin, she verified  her hope and belief, not so much in the almost indefinable aging and  sadness of the man, as in the strong intuitive sense that her attraction  had magnified for him and had uplifted him.    \"You mustn't stay shut up in there any longer,\" he said. \"You've lost  weight and you're pale. Go out in the air and sun. You might as well get  used to the gang. Bate Wood came to me this morning and said he thought  you were the ghost of Dandy Dale. That name will stick to you. I don't  care how you treat my men. But if you're friendly you'll fare better.  Don't go far from the cabin. And if any man says or does a thing you  don't like--flash your gun. Don't yell for me. You can bluff this gang "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45532"],[0,"History of Julius Cæsar, Vol. 2 of 2 (#19)"],[1,"his provisions  in sufficient quantity. He called together a council, in which it was  decided, in spite of the opinions of some chiefs, who proposed to  abandon the baggage and fight their way out, that they should defend the  camp; but the enemies hardly gave the Romans time to make the necessary  dispositions. Suddenly they rush from all sides towards the  retrenchments, and throw a shower of darts and javelins (_gaesa_). Having  to defend themselves against forces which are continually renewed, they  are obliged to fight all at once, and to move incessantly to the point  that are most threatened. The men who are fatigued, and even the  wounded, cannot quit the place. The combat had lasted six hours: the  Romans were exhausted with fatigue. Already they began to be short of  missiles; already the Gauls, with increasing audacity, were filling up  the fosse and tearing down the palisades; already the Romans were  reduced to the last extremity, when the primipilus, P. Sextius Baculus,  the same who had shown so much energy in the battle of the Sambre, and  C. Volusenus, tribune of the soldiers, advise Galba that the only hope  which remained was in a sally. The suggestion is adopted. At the command  of the centurions, the soldiers confine themselves to parrying the  missiles, and take breath; then, when the signal is given, rushing on  all sides to the gates, they fall upon the enemy, put him to rout, and  make an immense slaughter. Of 30,000 Gauls, about 10,000 were slain.[273]  In spite of this, Galba, not believing himself in safety in so difficult  a country, in the midst of hostile populations, brought back the 12th  legion into the country of the Allobroges, where it wintered.[273]          CHAPTER VI.    (Year of Rome 698.)    (BOOK III. OF THE \"COMMENTARIES.\")    WAR OF THE VENETI--VICTORY OVER THE UNELLI--SUBMISSION OF  AQUITAINE--MARCH AGAINST THE MORINI AND THE MENAPII.      [Sidenote: Insurrection of the Maritime Peoples.]    I. While Caesar was visiting Illyria and the different towns of the  Cisalpine, such as Ravenna and Lucca, war broke out anew in Gaul. The  cause was this. Young P. Crassus was in winter quarters with the 7th  legion among the Andes, near the ocean; as he fell short of wheat, he  sent several prefects and military tribunes to ask for provisions from  the neighbouring peoples. T. Terrasidius was deputed to the Unelli,[274]  M. Trebius Gallus to the Curiosolitae, and Quintus Velanius, with T.  Silius, to the Veneti. This last people was the most powerful on the  whole coast through its commerce and its navy. Its numerous ships served  to carry on a traffic with the isle of Britain. Possessed of consummate  skill in the art of navigation, it ruled over this part of the ocean.  The Veneti first seized Silius and Velanius, in the hope of obtaining in  exchange for them the return of the hostages given to Crassus. Their  example was soon followed. The Unelli and the Curiosolitae seized, with  the same design, Trebius and Terrasidius; they entered into an  engagement with the Veneti, through their chiefs, to run the same  fortune, excited the rest of the neighbouring maritime peoples to  recover their liberty, and all together intimated to Crassus that he  must send back the hostages if he wished his tribunes and prefects to be  restored.    Caesar, then very far distant from the scene of these events, learnt them  from Crassus. He immediately ordered galleys to be constructed on the  Loire, rowers to be fetched from the coast of the Mediterranean, and  sailors and pilots to be procured. These measures having been promptly  executed, he repaired to the army as soon as the season permitted. At  the news of his approach, the Veneti and their allies, conscious that  they had been guilty of throwing into fetters envoys invested with a  character which is inviolable, made preparations proportionate to the  danger with which they saw they were threatened. Above all, they set to  work making their ships ready for action. Their confidence was great:  they knew that the tides would intercept the roads on the sea-coast;  they reckoned on the difficulty of the navigation in those unknown  latitudes, where the ports are few, and on the want of provisions, which  would not permit the Romans to make a long stay in their country.    Their determination once taken, they fortified their _oppida_, and  transported to them the wheat from their fields. Persuaded that the  country of the Veneti would be the first attacked, they gathered  together all their ships, no doubt in the vast estuary formed by the  river Auray in the Bay of Quiberon. (_See Plate 12._) They allied  themselves with the maritime peoples of the coast, from the mouth of the  Loire to that of the Scheldt,[275] and demanded succour from the isle of  Britain.[276]    In spite of the difficulties of this war, Caesar undertook it without  hesitation. He was influenced by grave motives: the violation of the  right of nations, the rebellion after submission, the coalition of so  many peoples; above all, by the fear that their impunity would be an  encouragement to others. If we believe Strabo, Caesar, as well as the  Veneti, had other reasons to desire this war: on one side, the latter,  possessed of the commerce of Britain, already suspected the design of  the Roman general to pass into that island, and they sought to deprive  him of the means; and, on the other, Caesar could not attempt the  dangerous enterprise of a descent on England till after he had destroyed  the fleet of the Veneti, the sole masters of the ocean.[277]      [Sidenote: War against the Veneti.]    II. Be this as it may, in order to prevent new risings, Caesar divided  his army so as to occupy the country militarily. The lieutenant T.  Labienus, at the head of a part of the cavalry, was sent to the Treviri,  with the mission to visit the Remi and other peoples of Belgic Gaul, to  maintain them in their duty, and to oppose the passage of the Rhine by  the Germans, who were said to have been invited by the Belgae. P. Crassus  was ordered, with twelve legionary cohorts, and a numerous body of  cavalry, to repair into Aquitaine, to prevent the inhabitants of that  province from swelling the forces of the insurrection. The lieutenant Q.  Titurius Sabinus was detached with three legions to restrain the Unelli,  the Curiosolitae, and the Lexovii. The young D. Brutus,[278] who had  arrived from the Mediterranean with the galleys,[279] received the  command of the fleet, which was increased by the Gaulish ships borrowed  from the Pictones, the Santones, and other peoples who had submitted.  His instructions enjoined him to sail as soon as possible for the  country of the Veneti. As to Caesar, he proceeded thither with the rest  of the land army.    The eight legions of the Roman army were then distributed thus: to the  north of the Loire, three legions; in Aquitaine, with Crassus, a legion  and two cohorts; one legion, no doubt, on the fleet; and two legions and  eight cohorts with the general-in-chief, to undertake the war against  the Veneti.[280]    We may admit that Caesar started from the neighbourhood of Nantes, and  directed his march to the Roche-Bernard, where he crossed the Vilaine.  Having arrived in the country of the Veneti, he resolved to profit by  the time which must pass before the arrival of his fleet to obtain  possession of the principal _oppida_ where the inhabitants took refuge.  Most of these petty fortresses on the coast of the Veneti were situated  at the extremities of tongues of land or promontories; at high tide they  could not be reached by land, while at low tide the approach was  inaccessible to ships, which remained dry on the flats; a double  obstacle to a siege.    The Romans attacked them in the following manner: they constructed on  the land, at low tide, two parallel dykes, at the same time serving for  terraces (_aggere ac molibus_), and forming approaches towards the  place. During the course of construction, the space comprised between  these two dykes continued to be inundated with water at every high tide;  but as soon as they had succeeded in joining them up to the _oppidum_,  this space, where the sea could no longer penetrate, remained finally  dry, and then presented to the besiegers a sort of place of arms useful  in the attack.[281]    With the aid of these long and laborious works, in which the height of  the dykes finished by equalling that of the walls, the Romans succeeded  in taking several of these _oppida_. But all their labours were thrown  away; for, as soon as the Veneti thought themselves no longer safe, they  evacuated the _oppidum_, embarked with all their goods on board their  numerous vessels, and withdrew to the neighbouring _oppida_, the  situations of which offered the same advantages for a new resistance.    The greater part of the fine season had passed away in this manner.  Caesar, convinced at length that the assistance of his ships was  indispensable, came to the resolution of suspending these laborious and  fruitless operations until the arrival of his fleet; and, that he might  be near at hand to receive it, he encamped to the south of the Bay of  Quiberon, near the coast, on the heights of Saint-Gildas. (_See Plate  12._)    The vessels of the fleet, held back by contrary winds, had not yet been  able to assemble at the mouth of the Loire. As the Veneti had foreseen,  they navigated with difficulty on this vast sea, subject to high tides,  and almost entirely unfurnished with ports. The inexperience of the  sailors, and even the form of the ships, added to their difficulties.    The enemy's ships, on the contrary, were built and rigged in a manner to  enable them to wrestle with all obstacles; flatter than those of the  Romans, they had less to fear from the shallows and low tide. Built of  oak, they supported the most violent shocks; the front and back, very  lofty, were beyond the reach of the"]]]
