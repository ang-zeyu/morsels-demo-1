But Spain will not find it. Spain will find  nothing.    \"What can one do? I know Spain too well. Now, hear! I am acquainted  with a _caballero_. I have been his friend ten years and more. But he  has had the luck, not I. For, first, when we were at the university,  he had a fortune left to him. He became betrothed to a senorita whom  he loved better than his eyelashes. He travelled for his pleasure to  Monte Carlo, and played his fortune all away in one week. He came back  to Madrid, and went to one of the Ministers, to whom his father had in  former days done a great service. My friend said: 'I am to marry. The  lady expects to share the fortune which I have lost. My position is  not honorable. I must have an opening, a chance to redeem myself, or I  shall stand disgraced before her.' The Minister sent him to one of the  Cuban custom-houses, and in two years he returned with great wealth.  On his wedding journey he spent a night at Monte Carlo and gambled it  away to the last _peseta_. A stranger had to lend him money to get  home with his bride. Was he not ashamed and troubled? Ashamed? I do  not know. But troubled? Yes, for he wanted to play longer. Every one  is as God has made him, and very often worse. Again he went to the  Minister, whose heart was softer than a ripe fig and who found him a  post in the Philippines. This time he made a fortune much quicker than  before, knowing better how to do unjustly, but a few weeks before the  war he came home and lost it all again at Monte Carlo. And now he is  horribly vexed, for it is another Minister, and, besides, there are no  colonies to enrich him any more.    \"What use to care for Spain? No, no, no, no, no! Spain is a good  country to leave--that is all. And you do well to travel in Spain.  American ladies like change, and Spain is not America. Here you are  not only in a different land, but in a different century. You can say,  when you come out, that you have been journeying a hundred years ago.\"    On another occasion one of those pleasant individuals who would, as  the Spaniards say, \"talk of a rope in the house of one who had been  hanged,\" saw fit to entertain the dinner-table with anecdotes of  Spanish cruelty.    \"But Spaniards are not cruel,\" protested our young blackamoor in his  softest voice an hour later, stroking with one great hand the head of  a child who nestled against his knee. \"What did that English fellow  mean? Why should any one think that Spaniards are cruel?\"    I ran over in mind a few of the frightful stories of Las Casas, that  good Dominican friar who would not hold his peace when he saw the  braining of Indian babies and roasting of Indian chiefs. I remembered  how De Soto tossed his captives to the bloodhounds, and what  atrocities were wrought in the tranquil realm of the Incas; I recalled  the horrors of the Inquisition, but these things were of the past. So  I answered, \"Perhaps the bull-fights have done something to give  foreigners that impression.\"    Unlike many educated Spaniards who would rather attend the bull-fights  than defend them, he squared his shoulders for an oration.    \"The bull-fights? But why? Bull-fights are not cruel--not more cruel  than other sports in other countries. I have been told of prize-fights  in America. I beg your pardon. I see by your look that you do not like  them. And, in truth, I do not altogether like the bull-fights. The  horses! They are blindfolded, and it is short, but I have seen--ah,  yes! You would not wish to hear what I have seen. I have been often  sorry for the horses. Yet some pain is necessary in everything, is it  not? In nature, perhaps? In society, perhaps? Even, if you will pardon  the illustration, in the deliverance of the Filipinos from Spanish  tyranny?\"    I briefly suggested that there was no element of necessity in  bull-fights.    The waving hand apologized gently for dissent.    \"But, yes! The bulls are killed for food. That is what foreigners do  not seem to understand. It may be ugly, but it is universal. To supply  men with meat, to feed great cities with the flesh of beasts--it is  not pleasant to think of that too closely. But how to help it? Do you  not have slaughter-houses in America? These also we have in Spain. I  have visited one. It seemed to me much worse than the bull-ring.  Faugh! I did not like it. The cattle stood trembling, one behind  another, waiting for the blow. I should not like to die like that. I  would rather die in the wrath of battle like a _toro bravo_. Oh, it is  not cruel. Do not think it. For these bulls feel no fear. It is fear  that degrades. They may feel pain, but I doubt--I doubt. They feel the  wildness of anger, and they charge and charge again until the  _estocada_, the death stab. That is not so bad a way to die, is it?  Any man would choose it rather than to stand in terror, bound and  helpless, hearing the others fall under the axe and seeing his turn  draw near. Yes, yes! The bull-ring rather than the slaughter-house for  me!\"    This was a novel view of the case to the auditor, who ignominiously  shifted her ground.    \"But what country uses the slaughter-house as a spectacle and a sport?  It is one thing to take life for food, and another to make a holiday  of the death struggle.\"    Again that deprecatory waving of the hands.    \"I beg your pardon. I do not know how it is in America. Perhaps\"  [circumflex accent] \"all is merciful and noble there. But when I was  in England I saw something of the chase and of the autumn shooting. I  saw a poor little fox hunted to the death. It was not for food. The  dogs tore him. I saw wounded birds left in the cover to die. It was  too much trouble to gather them all up. And the deer? Does not the  stag suffer more in his flight than the bull in his struggle? I  believe it. To run and run and run, always growing weaker, while the  chase comes nearer--that is an agony. The rage of combat has no terror  in it. I would not die like the deer, hunted down by packs of dogs and  men--and ladies. I would die like the bull, hearing the cheers of the  multitude.\"    The big fellow bent over the baby that was dropping to sleep against  his knee, and slipped the drowsy little body, deftly and tenderly, to  a sofa. Such sweetness flooded the soft black eyes, as they were  lifted from the child, that it was hard to imagine them sparkling with  savage delight over the bloody scenes of the _corrida de toros_. I  asked impulsively how long it was since he had seen a bull-fight.  Brows and hands and shoulders were swift to express their appreciation  of the bearings of the question, and the voice became very music in  courteous acquiescence.    \"Ah, it is four years. Of course, I was much younger then. Yes, yes!  It might not please me now. _Quien sabe?_ And yet--I beg your  pardon--I think I shall go next Sunday in Madrid, on my way to Paris.  It is so weary in London on the Sundays. It was always colder Sunday,  and there was not even a cafe. There was nowhere to go. There was  nothing to do. Why is that good? At the bull-fight one feels the joy  of life. Is it more religious to sit dull and dismal by the fire? I  had no use for the churches. Walking is not amusing, unless the sun  shines and there is something gay to see. I do not like tea, and I do  not care for reading. Spaniards like to laugh and be merry, and when  there is nothing to laugh for, life is a heaviness. There is no  laughter in a London Sunday. I hope Paris will be better, though I  believe there are no bull-fights there as yet. You are not pleased  with me, but let me tell you why I love the _corrida_. It is not for  the horses, you remember. I have sometimes looked away. But why should  I pity the bulls, when they are mad with battle? They do not pity  themselves. They are glad in their fury, and I am glad in seeing it.  But I am more glad in the activity and daring of the men. When they  run risks, that is what makes me cheer. It is not that I would have  them hurt. I am proud to find men brave. And I am excited and eager to  see if they escape. Do you not understand? If you would go  yourself--just once--no? Is it always no? Then let me tell you what is  the best of all. It is to stand near the entrance and watch the people  pass in, all dressed in their holiday clothes, and all with holiday  faces. It is good and beautiful to see them--especially the ladies.\"    The most attractive qualities of our young Spaniard were his mirth and  courtesy. His merriment was so spontaneous and so buoyant that his  grace of manner, always tempered to time and place and person, became  the more apparent. His humor dwelt, nevertheless, in the borderlands  of irony, and it was conceivable that the rubs of later life might  enrich its pungency at the cost of its kindliness. He was excellent at  games (not sports), especially the game of courtliness (not  helpfulness). The letter was not posted, the message slipped his  memory, the errand was done amiss, but his apologies were poetry. He  made a pretty play of the slightest social intercourse. We would open  our Baedeker at the map which we had already, in crossing Spain,  unfolded some hundred times. He would spring as lightly to his feet as  if his mighty bulk were made of feathers, and stand, half bowing,  arching his eyebrows in appeal, spreading out his hands in offer of  assistance, but not venturing to approach them toward the book until  it was definitely tendered him. Then he would receive it with  elaborate delicacy of touch, unfold the creased sheet with a score of  varied little flourishes, and restore the volume with a whole fresh  series of gesticulatory airs and graces. The next instant he would  peep up from under his black lashes to detect the alloy of amusement  in our gratitude, and drop his face flat upon the table in a boyish  bubble of laughter, saying:--    \"A"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#19)"],[1," lost time by putting on all the speed they dared, before  turning into the next westward traffic-artery. They did not look  back, for there was a car directly in front of them, whose driver  seemed uncertain as to his wheel control, and the Master was  manoeuvering to pass it in safety.    Not until they had reached the lower end of Riverside Drive, nearly a  mile to the north, did either the Master or Mistress turn around for a  word with the dog they loved.    Meantime, Lad was standing, irresolute and panting, in the middle of  Columbus Circle. Cars of a million types, from flivver to trolley,  seemed to be whizzing directly at him from every direction at once.    A bound, a dodge, or a deft shrinking back would carry him out of one  such peril--barely out of it--when another, or fifty others, beset  him.    And, all the time, even while he was trying to duck out of danger, his  frightened eyes and his pulsing nostrils sought the Mistress and the  Master.    His eyes, in that mixture of flare and dusk, told him nothing except  that a host of motors were likely to kill him. But his nose told him  what it had not been able to tell him since morning--namely, that,  through the reek of gasoline and horseflesh and countless human  scents, there was a nearness of fields and woods and water. And,  toward that blessed mingling of familiar odors he dodged his  threatened way.    By a miracle of luck and skill he crossed Columbus Circle, and came to  a standstill on a sidewalk, beside a low gray stone wall. Behind  the wall, his nose taught him, lay miles of meadow and wood and  lake--Central Park. But the smell of the Park brought him no scent of  the Mistress nor of the Master. And it was they--infinitely more than  his beloved countryside--that he craved. He ran up the street, on the  sidewalk, for a few rods, hesitant, alert, watching in every  direction. Then, perhaps seeing a figure, in the other direction, that  looked familiar, he dashed at top speed, eastward, for half a  block. Then he made a peril-fraught sortie out into the middle of the  traffic-humming street, deceived by the look of a passing car.    The car was traveling at twenty miles an hour. But, in less than a  block, Lad caught up with it. And this, in spite of the many things  he had to dodge, and the greasy slipperiness of the unfamiliar  roadway. An upward glance, as he came alongside the car, told him his  chase was in vain. And he made his precarious way to the sidewalk once  more.    There he stood, bewildered, heartsick--lost!    Yes, he was lost. And he realized it--realized it as fully as would a  city-dweller snatched up by magic and set down amid the trackless  Himalayas. He was lost. And Horror bit deep into his soul.    The average dog might have continued to waste energy and risk life by  galloping aimlessly back and forth, running hopefully up to every  stranger he met; then slinking off in scared disappointment and  searching afresh.    Lad was too wise for that. He was lost. His adored Mistress had  somehow left him; as had the Master; in this bedlam place--all  alone. He stood there, hopeless, head and tail adroop, his great heart  dead within him.    Presently he became aware once more that he was still wearing his  abominable muzzle. In the stress of the past few minutes Lad had  actually forgotten the pain and vexation of the thing. Now, the memory  of it came back, to add to his despair.    And, as a sick animal will ever creep to the woods and the waste  places for solitude, so the soul-sick Lad now turned from the clangor  and evil odors of the street to seek the stretch of country-land he  had scented.    Over the gray wall he sprang, and came earthward with a crash among  the leafless shrubs that edged the south boundary of Central Park.    Here in the Park there were people and lights and motor-cars, too, but  they were few, and they were far off. Around the dog was a grateful  darkness and aloneness. He lay down on the dead grass and panted.    The time was late February. The weather of the past day or two had  been mild. The brown-gray earth and the black trees had a faint odor  of slow-coming spring, though no nostrils less acute than a dog's  could have noted it.    Through the misery at his heart and the carking pain from his muzzle,  Lad began to realize that he was tired, also that he was hollow from  lack of food. The long day's ordeal of the dog show had wearied him  and had worn down his nerves more than could a fifty-mile run. The  nasty thrills of the past half-hour had completed his fatigue. He had  eaten nothing all day. Like most high-strung dogs at a show, he had  drunk a great deal of water and had refused to touch a morsel of food.    He was not hungry even now for, in a dog, hunger goes only with peace  of mind, but he was cruelly thirsty. He got up from his slushy couch  on the dead turf and trotted wearily toward the nearest branch of the  Central Park lake. At the brink he stooped to drink.    Soggy ice still covered the lake, but the mild weather had left a  half-inch skim of water over it. Lad tried to lap up enough of this  water to allay his craving thirst. He could not.    The muzzle protruded nearly an inch beyond his nose. Either through  faulty adjustment or from his own futile efforts to scrape it off, the  awkward steel hinge had become jammed and would not open. Lad could  not get his teeth a half-inch apart.    After much effort he managed to protrude the end of his pink tongue  and to touch the water with it, but it was a painful and drearily slow  process absorbing water drop by drop in this way. More through fatigue  than because his thirst was slaked, he stopped at last and turned away  from the lake.    The next half-hour was spent in a diligent and torturing and wholly  useless attempt to rid himself of his muzzle.    After which the dog lay panting and athirst once more; his tender nose  sore and bruised and bleeding; the muzzle as firmly fixed in place as  ever. Another journey to the lake and another Tantalus-effort to  drink--and the pitifully harassed dog's uncanny brain began to work.    He no longer let himself heed the muzzle. Experience of the most  painful sort had told him he could not dislodge it nor, in that  clamorous and ill-smelling city beyond the park wall, could he hope to  find the Mistress and the Master. These things being certain, his mind  went on to the next step, and the next step was--Home!    Home! The Place where his happy, beautiful life had been spent, where  his two gods abode, where there were no clang and reek and peril as  here in New York. Home!--The House of Peace!    Lad stood up. He drew in great breaths of the muggy air, and he turned  slowly about two or three times, head up, nostrils aquiver. For a  full minute he stood thus. Then he lowered his head and trotted  westward. No longer he moved uncertainly, but with as much sureness as  if he were traversing the forest behind The Place--the forest that had  been his roaming-ground since puppyhood.    (Now, this is not a fairy story, nor any other type of fanciful yarn,  so I do not pretend to account for Lad's heading unswervingly toward  the northwest in the exact direction of The Place, thirty miles  distant, any more than I can account for the authenticated case of a  collie who, in 1917, made his way four hundred miles from the home of  a new owner in southern Georgia to the doorstep of his former and  better loved master in the mountains of North Carolina; any more than  I can account for the flight of a homing pigeon or for that of the  northbound duck in Spring. God gives to certain animals a whole set of  mystic traits which He withholds utterly from humans. No dog-student  can doubt that, and no dog-student or deep-delving psychologist can  explain it.)    Northwestward jogged Lad, and in half a mile he came to the low  western wall of Central Park. Without turning aside to seek a  gateway, he cleared the wall and found himself on Eighth Avenue in the  very middle of a block.    Keeping on the sidewalk and paying no heed to the few pedestrians, he  moved along to the next westward street and turned down it toward the  Hudson River. So calmly and certainly did he move that none would have  taken him for a lost dog.    Under the roaring elevated road at Columbus Avenue, he trotted; his  ears tormented by the racket of a train that reverberated above him;  his sense so blurred by the sound that he all but forgot to dodge a  southbound trolley car.    Down the cross street to Amsterdam Avenue he bore. A patrolman on his  way to the West Sixty-ninth Street police station to report for night  duty, was so taken up by his own lofty thoughts that he quite forgot  to glance at the big mud-spattered dog that padded past him.    For this lack of observation the patrolman was destined to lose a good  opportunity for fattening his monthly pay. Because, on reaching the  station, he learned that a distressed man and woman had just been  there in a car to offer a fifty-dollar reward for the finding of a big  mahogany-and-white collie, answering to the name of \"Lad.\"    As the dog reached Amsterdam Avenue a high little voice squealed  delightedly at him. A three-year-old baby--a mere fluff of gold and  white and pink--was crossing the avenue convoyed by a fat woman in  black. Lad was jogging by the mother and child when the latter  discovered the passing dog.    With a shriek of joyous friendliness the baby flung herself upon Lad  and wrapped both arms about his shaggy neck.    \"Why _doggie!_\" she shrilled, ecstatically. \"Why, dear, _dear_  doggie!\"    Now Lad was in dire haste to get home, and Lad was in dire misery of  mind and body, but his big heart went out in eagerly loving answer to  the impulsive caress. He worshipped children, and would cheerfully  endure from them any amount of mauling.    At the baby embrace and the baby voice, he stopped short in his  progress. His plumy tail wagged"]]]
