Pepwell reads: \"Also the steps of thy staff  Hope plainly will shew unto thee if thou do it duly, as I have told  thee before, or not.\"    [199]Summa Theologica, II.-ii. Q. 82, A. I: \"Devotio nihil aliud  esse videtur, quam voluntas quaedam prompte tradendi se ad ea, quae  pertinent ad Dei famulatum.\"    [200]The whole passage included in square brackets is omitted in  Pepwell, but is identical in the two MSS.

[207]Pure Love, or Charity, which \"attains to God Himself, that it  may abide in Him, not that any advantage may accrue to us from Him\"  (St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, II.-ii. Q. 23, A. 6). For the  whole doctrine of \"Pure Love or Disinterested Religion,\" cf. F. von  Hugel, The Mystical Element of Religion, ii. pp. 152-181.

[215]Pepwell adds: \"or sundry.\"    [216]So Pepwell and Harl. MS. 2373; Harl. MS, 674 reads: \"they ben  one spirit.\"    [217]Cant. ii. 16.    [218]Harl. MS. 674 reads: \"glose.\" Pepwell adds: \"or flatter.\"    [219]Heed.    [220]Pepwell adds: \"or betokeneth.\" Cf. Langland, Piers the Plowman,  A. i. 1: \"What this mountein bemeneth.\"    [221]Cf. above, p. 28 note.    [222]Pepwell adds: \"or counsel.\"    [223]Of thyself thou hast nought but sin.    [224]So the MSS.: Pepwell has: \"to God.\"    [225]Pepwell changes to \"divers.\"    [226]Cf. Dante, De Monarchia, iii. 16: \"Man alone of beings holds a  mid-place between corruptible and incorruptible; wherefore he is  rightly likened by the philosophers to the horizon which is between  two hemispheres. For man, if considered after either essential part,  to wit soul and body is corruptible if considered only after the  one, to wit the body, but if after the other, to wit the soul, he is  incorruptible. . . . If man then, is a kind of mean between  corruptible and incorruptible things, since every mean savours of  the nature of the extremes, it is necessary that man should savour  of either nature. And since every nature is ordained to a certain  end, it follows that there must be a twofold end of man, so that  like as he alone amongst all beings partakes of corruptibility and  incorruptibilty, so he alone amongst all beings should be ordained  for two final goals of which the one should be his goal as a  corruptible being, and the other as an incorruptible\" (P. H.  Wicksteed's translation).    [227]Pepwell modernises this throughout to \"dwelling alone.\"    [228]Pepwell substitutes \"doubt.\" Cf. Chaucer, Legend of Good Women,  2686: \"Thryes doun she fil in swiche a were.\"    [229]Pepwell adds: \"in keeping of silence.\"    [230]Harl. MS. 674 reads: \"more holiness than thou art worthy.\"    [231]Nature.    [232]Solitude.    [233]Pepwell has: \"company.\"    [234]Pepwell reads: \"better.\"    [235]Causes.    [236]1 Cor. ii. 11.

Walter  Hilton, The Ladder of Perfection, I. pt. iii. cap 9: \"Lift up thy  lanthorn, and thou shalt see in this image five windows, by which  sin cometh into thy soul, as the Prophet saith: Death cometh in by  our windows. These are the five senses by which thy soul goeth out  of herself, and fetcheth her delight and seeketh her feeding in  earthly things, contrary to the nobility of her own nature. As by  the eye to see curious and fair things and so of the other senses.  By the unskilful using of these senses willingly to vanities, thy  soul is much letted from the sweetness of the spiritual senses  within; and therefore it behoveth thee to stop these windows, and  shut them, but only when need requireth to open them\" (ed.

Gigli): \"Love  harmonises the three powers of our soul, and binds them together.  The will moves the understanding to see, when it wishes to love;  when the understanding perceives that the will would fain love, if  it is a rational will, it places before it as object the ineffable  love of the eternal Father, who has given us the Word, His own son,  and the obedience and humility of the son, who endured torments,  inuries, mockeries, and insults with meekness and with such great  love. And thus the will, with ineffable love, follows what the eye  of the understanding has beheld; and with its strong hand, it stores  up in the memory the treasure that it draws from this love.\"    [258]Losing.

[273]Harl. MS. 674 reads: \"stirring\"; the other MS, as Pepwell.    [274]Harl. MS. 674 reads: \"have.\"    [275]Pepwell reads: \"else.\"    [276]Manifestly, i.e. unless they clearly show that they do not know  how to act as they should. Pepwell has: \"in a part.\"    [277]i.e. take their advice, but do not simply imitate them. I  follow the MSS. in preference to Pepwell, who reads: \"Work after no  men's counsel, but sith that know well their own disposition; for  such men should,\" etc.    [278]1 John iv. 1-6.

[Sidenote: Kingdom of Pontus.]    X. The most northern of the four groups named above formed a great part  of the kingdom of Pontus. This province, the ancient Cappadocia Pontica,  formerly a Persian satrapy, reduced to subjection by Alexander and his  successor, recovered itself after the battle of Ipsus (453). Mithridates  III. enlarged his territory by adding to it Paphlagonia, and afterwards  Sinope and Galatia. Pontus soon extended from Colchis on the north-east  to Lesser Armenia on the south-east, and had Bithynia for its boundary  on the west. Thus, touching upon the Caucasus, and master of the Pontus  Euxinus, this kingdom, composed of divers peoples, presented, under  varied climates, a variety of different productions. It received wines  and oils from the AEgean Sea, and wheat from the Bosphorus; it exported  salt fish in great quantity,[343] dolphin oil,[344] and, as produce of  the interior, the wools of the Gadilonitis,[345] the fleeces of Ancyra,  the horses of Armenia, Media, and Paphlagonia,[346] the iron of the  Chalybes, a population of miners to the south of Trapezus, already  celebrated in the time of Homer, and mentioned by Xenophon.[347] There  also were found mines of silver, abandoned in the time of Strabo,[348]  but which have been re-opened in modern times. Important ports on the  Black Sea facilitated the exportation of these products. It was at  Sinope that Lucullus found a part of the treasures which he displayed at  his triumph, and which gives us a lofty idea of the kingdom of  Mithridates.[349] An object of admiration at Sinope was the statue of  Autolycus, one of the protecting heroes of the town, the work of the  statuary Sthenis.[350]    Trapezus (_Trebizonde_), which before the time of Mithridates the Great  preserved a sort of autonomy under the kings of Pontus, had an extensive  commerce; which was the case also with another Greek colony, Amisus  (_Samsoun_),[351] regarded in the time of Lucullus as one of the most  flourishing and richest towns in the country.[352] In the interior,  Amasia, which became afterwards one of the great fortresses of Asia  Minor, and the metropolis of Pontus, had already probably, at the time  of the Punic wars, a certain renown. Cabira, called afterwards  _Sebaste_, and then Neocaesarea, the central point of the resistance of  Mithridates the Great to Lucullus, owed its ancient celebrity to its  magnificent Temple of the Moon. From the country of Cabira, there was,  according to the statement of Lucullus,[353] only the distance of a few  days' march into Armenia, a country the riches of which may be estimated  by the treasures gathered by Tigranes.[354]    We can hence understand how Mithridates the Great was able, two  centuries later, to oppose the Romans with considerable armies and  fleets. He possessed in the Black Sea 400 ships,[355] and his army  amounted to 250,000 men and 40,000 horse.[356] He received, it is true,  succours from Armenia and Scythia, from the Palus Maeotis, and even from  Thrace.      [Sidenote: Bithynia.]    XI. Bithynia, a province of Asia Minor, comprised between the Propontis,  the Sangarius, and Paphlagonia, formed a kingdom, which, at the  beginning of the sixth century of Rome, was adjacent to Pontus, and  comprised several parts of the provinces contiguous to Mysia and  Phrygia. In it were found several towns, the commerce of which rivalled  that of the maritime towns of Pontus, and especially Nicaea and  Nicomedia. This last, founded in 475 by Nicomedes I., took a rapid  extension.[357] Heraclea Pontica, a Milesian colony situated between the  Sangarius and the Parthenius, preserved its extensive commerce, and an  independence which Mithridates the Great himself could not entirely  destroy; it possessed a vast port, safe and skilfully disposed, which  sheltered a numerous fleet.[358] The power of the Bithynians was not  insignificant, since they sent into the field, in the war of Nicomedes  against Mithridates, 56,000 men.[359] If the traffic was considerable on  the coasts of Bithynia, thanks to the Greek colonies, the interior was  not less prosperous by its agriculture, and Bithynia was still, in the  time of Strabo, renowned for its herds.[360]    One of the provinces of Bithynia fell into the hands of the Gauls  (A.U.C. 478). Three peoples of Celtic origin shared it, and exercised in  it a sort of feudal dominion. It was called Galatia from the name of the  conquerors. Its places of commerce were: Ancyra, the point of arrival  of the caravans coming from Asia, and Pessinus, one of the chief seats  of the old Phrygian worship, where pilgrims repaired in great number to  adore Cybele.[361] The population of Galatia was certainly rather  considerable, since in the famous campaign of Cneius Manlius Volso,[362]  in 565, the Galatians lost 40,000 men. The two tribes united of the  Tectosagi and Trocmi raised at that period, in spite of many defeats, an  army of 50,000 foot and 10,000 horse.[363]      [Sidenote: Cappadocia.]    XII. To the east of Galatia, Cappadocia comprised between the Halys and  Armenia, distant from the sea, and crossed by numerous chains of  mountains, formed a kingdom which escaped the conquests of Alexander,  and which, a few years after his death, opposed Perdiccas with an army  of 30,000 footmen and 15,000 horsemen.[364] In the time of Strabo, wheat  and cattle formed the riches of this country.[365] In 566, King  Ariarathes paid 600 talents for the alliance of the Romans.[366] Mazaca  (afterwards _Caesarea_), capital of Cappadocia, a town of an entirely  Asiatic origin, had been, from a very early period, renowned for its  pastures.[367]      [Sidenote: Kingdom of Pergamus.]    XIII. The western part of Asia Minor is better known. It had seen, after  the battle of Ipsus, the formation of the kingdom of Pergamus, which,  thanks to the interested liberality of the Romans towards Eumenes II.,  increased continually until the moment when it fell under their  sovereignty. To this kingdom belonged Mysia, the two Phrygias, Lycaonia,  and Lydia. This last province, crossed by the Pactolus, had for its  capital Ephesus, the metropolis of the Ionian confederation, at the same  time the mart of the commerce of Asia Minor and one of the localities  where the fine arts were cultivated with most distinction. This town had  two ports: one penetrated into the heart of the town, while the other  formed a basin in the very middle of the public market.[368] The theatre  of Ephesus, the largest ever built, was 660 feet in diameter, and was  capable of holding 60,000 spectators. The most celebrated artists,  Scopas, Praxiteles, etc., worked at Ephesus upon the great Temple of  Diana. This monument, the building of which lasted two hundred and  twenty years, was surrounded by 128 columns, each 60 feet high,  presented by so many kings. Pergamus, the capital of the kingdom, passed  for one of the finest cities in Asia, _longe clarissimum Asiae Pergamum_,  says Pliny;[369] the port of Elaea contained maritime arsenals, and could  arm numerous vessels.[370] The acropolis of Pergamus, an inaccessible  citadel, defended by two torrents, was the residence of the Attalides;  these princes, zealous protectors of the sciences and arts, had founded  in their capital a library of 200,000 volumes.[371] Pergamus carried on  a vast traffic; its cereals were exported in great quantities to most  places in Greece.[372] Cyzicus, situated on an island of the Propontis,  with two closed ports forming a station for about two hundred  ships,[373] rivalled the richest cities of Asia. Like Adramyttium, it  carried on a great commerce in perfumery,[374] it worked the  inexhaustible marble-quarries of the island of Proconnesus,[375] and its  commercial relations were so extensive that its gold coins were current  in all the Asiatic factories.[376] The town of Abydos possessed gold  mines.[377] The wheat of Assus was reputed the best in the world, and  was reserved for the table of the kings of Persia.[378]    We may estimate the population and resources of this part of Asia from  the armies and fleets which the kings had at their command at the time  of the conquest of Greece by the Romans. In 555, Attalus II., and, ten  years later, Eumenes II., sent them numerous galleys of five ranks of  oars.[379] The land forces of the kings of Pergamus were much less  considerable.[380] Their direct authority did not extend over a great  territory, yet they had many tributary towns; hence their great wealth  and small army. The Romans drew from this country, now nearly barren and  unpeopled, immense contributions both in gold and wheat.[381] The  magnificence of the triumph of Manlius and the reflections of Livy,  compared with the testimony of Herodotus, reveal all the splendour of  the kingdom of Pergamus. It was after the war against Antiochus and the  expedition of Manlius that extravagance began to display itself at  Rome.[382] Soldiers and generals enriched themselves prodigiously in  Asia.[383]    The ancient colonies of Ionia and AEolis, such as Clazomenae, Colophon,  and many others, which were dependent for the most part on the kingdom  of Pergamus, were fallen from their ancient grandeur. Smyrna, rebuilt by  Alexander, was still an object of admiration for the beauty of its  monuments. The exportation of wines, as celebrated on the coast of Ionia  as in the neighbouring islands, formed alone an important support of the  commerce of the ports of the AEgean Sea.    The treasures of the temple of Samothrace were so considerable, that we  are induced to mention here a circumstance relating to this little  island, though distant from Asia, and near the coast of Thrace: Sylla's  soldiers took in the sanctuary the Cabiri, an ornament of the value of  1,000 talents (5,820,000 francs [L232,800]).[384]      [Sidenote:"]]]
