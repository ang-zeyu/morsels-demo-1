They have but to cut  the lashings there and the whole will swing round. But now we see the  nature of the obstacle, and what is to be done, it were best to wait  until the tide turns. In the first place, fewer men will be needed on  board the ship, as she will advance by herself abreast of the men on  shore. In the second place, when the lashing is cut the boom will then  swing down the stream, will cause confusion among the boats behind it,  and will open a clear space for us to make our way down.\"    Edmund agreed, a light anchor was dropped, and the Dragon rode quietly  in the stream. Great animation was evident among the Danes, large  numbers crossed the river, and a strong force gathered at either end of  the boom and in boats close behind it, to prevent the Saxons from  attempting to cut the lashings. There was little uneasiness on board  the Dragon, the Saxons were confident now of the power of their close  formation to force its way through any number of the enemy, and they  would gain such assistance from the fire from the lofty forecastle that  they doubted not that they should be able to drive back the Danes and  destroy the boom. In an hour the tide no longer rose. They waited till  it ran down with full force, then the anchor was hauled up, and the  Dragon rowed to the bank.    Sixty of the fighting men headed by Egbert leapt on shore. Edmund with  the remainder took his place on the forecastle. The oars next to the  bank were drawn in, and some of those on the outward side manned by the  sailors. Then in its usual order the phalanx moved slowly forward while  the ship floated along beside them close to the bank. The Danes with  loud shouts advanced to meet them, and the arrows soon began to fly  thickly. Covered by the long shields of the front rank the Saxons moved  forward steadily, while, as the Danes approached, the archers on the  forecastle opened a destructive fire upon them.    The confidence of the Saxons was justified, for the combat was never in  doubt. Although the Northmen fought bravely they were unable to  withstand the steady advance of the wedge of spears, and very many fell  beneath the rain of arrows from above. Steadily the wedge made its way  until it reached the end of the boom. A few blows with their axes  sufficed to cut the cables which fastened it in its place. As soon as  this was done Edmund gave a shout, and the Saxons at once sprang on  board the ship, which before the Danes could follow them was steered  out into the stream.    As Egbert had foreseen, the boom as it swung round swept before it a  number of the Danish boats, and imprisoned them between it and the  shore. The oars were soon run out, and while the men on the forecastle  continued their fire at the Danish boats, the others seizing the oars  swept the Dragon along the stream. The Danes strove desperately to  arrest her progress. Some tried to run alongside and board, others  dashed in among the oars and impeded the work of the rowers, while from  the walls of the town showers of missiles were poured down upon her.  But the tide was gaining every moment in strength, and partly drifting,  partly rowing, the Dragon, like a bull attacked by a pack of dogs, made  her way down the river. Every effort of the Danes to board was  defeated, and many of their boats sunk, and at last she made her way  into the open sea. There her sails were hoisted, and she soon left her  pursuers behind. Once at sea her course was again turned north, and  picking up some prizes on the way she took up her station off the mouth  of the Humber.    Several ships were captured as they sailed out from the river. After  the spoil on board was taken out, these, instead of being burnt, as had  always been the case before, were allowed to proceed on their way,  since had they been destroyed the crews must either have been slain or  landed. The first course was repugnant to Edmund, the second could not  be adopted, because they would have carried the news to the Danes, that  the Dragon was off the river and no more ships would have put to sea;  and indeed, so large was the number of Danish vessels always up the  Humber that a fleet could easily have been equipped and sent out,  before which the Dragon must have taken flight.    One day a large sailing ship was seen coming out. The Dragon remained  with lowered sail until she had passed; then started in pursuit, and  speedily came up with the Danish vessel. Edmund summoned her to  surrender, and was answered by a Norseman of great stature and noble  appearance, who from the poop hurled a javelin, which would have  pierced Edmund had he not leapt quickly aside. A few other darts were  thrown and then the Dragon ran alongside the enemy and boarded her.    The opposition of the Northmen was speedily beaten down, but their  leader desperately defended the ladder leading to the poop. He was  struck by two arrows, and fell on one knee, and Edmund was about to  climb the ladder when the door of the cabin in the poop opened, and a  Norse maiden some sixteen years old sprang out. Seeing her father  wounded at the top of the ladder and the Saxons preparing to ascend it,  while others turned their bows against the wounded Northman, she sprang  forward and throwing herself upon her knees before Edmund besought him  to spare her father's life. Edmund raised his hand and the bows were  lowered.    \"I have no wish to slay your father, maiden,\" he said gently; \"we slay  only those who resist, and resistance on the part of a single man, and  he wounded, against a whole ship's crew is madness. We are no  sea-wolves who slay for the pleasure of slaying, but are Saxons, who  fight for our country against the oppressions and rapine of your  people. Little right have they to mercy seeing they show none; but our  religion enjoins us to have pity even upon our enemies. You had best  ascend to your father and see to his wounds, none will harm you or him.\"    The girl with an exclamation of thanks sprang up the ladder. Edmund  superintended the searching of the ship. She contained a great store of  valuables, which were speedily transferred to the Dragon. When this had  been done Edmund ascended to the poop. The jarl was sitting in a great  chair placed there. Edmund had already learnt from the crew that he was  Jarl Siegbert, a noted leader of the Northmen. His daughter had drawn  out the arrows and bandaged the wounds.    \"Jarl Siegbert,\" Edmund said as he approached him, \"you have been a  bitter enemy of the Saxons, and small mercy have you shown to those who  have fallen into your hands, but learn now that we Christian Saxons  take no vengeance on a defenceless foe. You are free to pursue your  voyage with your daughter and your ship to Norway. Your stores we have  made free with, seeing that they are all plunder taken from the Saxons,  and we do but reclaim our own.\"    \"And who are you, young sir?\" the jarl asked.    \"I am one of King Alfred's ealdormen of Wessex, Edmund by name.\"    \"I have heard of you,\" the Dane said, \"as one who has taught the Saxons  new tactics, fighting in a close body which has more than once pierced  our lines and caused our overthrow; but you are a mere lad.\"    \"I am young,\" Edmund replied, \"and had it not been for the invasions  and oppressions of your countrymen, might have still accounted myself  as scarce a man; but you have made warriors of every West Saxon capable  of bearing a sword. Remember, jarl, that your life has been in Saxon  hands, and that they have spared it, so come not hither to our shores  again.\"    \"I purpose not doing so,\" the Northman replied. \"I have seen enough of  stricken fields, and was returning to my own country to hang up my  sword, content with the fame I have gained, until Woden called me to  join his warriors and feast in his halls. Since we may not meet there,  young Saxon--for they say that you Christians look to a place where  arms will be laid aside and the sound of feasting be unheard--I will  say farewell. For myself, I thank you not for my life, for I would  rather have died as I have lived with my sword in my hand; but for my  daughter's sake I thank you, for she is but young to be left  unprotected in the world.\"    A few minutes later, the Danish vessel continued on her way, and the  Dragon again took her station on the look-out. She was now deep in the  water, and after picking up one or two more small prizes, Edmund and  Egbert determined to return home.    It was probable that the Danes would soon take the alarm and despatch a  fleet to attack them. Laden down as the Dragon was, her speed under  oars was materially affected, and it was advisable to stow away their  booty before proceeding with further adventures. Her head was turned  south, and she coasted down the eastern shores of England without  adventure. Several Danish vessels were seen arriving at or quitting the  coast, but the Dragon continued her course without heeding them, and  rounding the Forelands, sailed along the south coast and made her way  up the Parrot.    Upon inquiry they learnt that no event of any importance had taken  place during their absence. The Danes were complete masters of the  country. King Alfred was in hiding, none knew where. The greater  portion of the Danes were at their camp at Chippenham, but parties  roamed here and there through the land.    Dressed as countrymen, Edmund and Egbert made their way to Exeter, and  there arranged with some traders for the purchase of the less valuable  portion of the Dragons cargo. This consisted of rich clothing, silks  and other stuffs, wine, vestments, and altar hangings from churches,  arms and armour, hides and skins. The prices obtained were far below  the real value of the articles, for money was scarce, and none could  say when the Danes might again swoop down and clear out the contents of  the warehouses. Nevertheless the sum obtained was a large one for those  days,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36844"],[0,"In New England Fields and Woods (#19)"],[1,"the judicious axe then scorned. Beeches, whose flat branches are  shelves of old gold; poplars, turned to towers of brighter metal by the  same alchemy of autumn; and hemlocks, pyramids of unchanging green,  shadow the leaf-strewn forest floor and its inconspicuous dotting of  gray and russet stumps. How happy the boy is in the freedom of the  woods; proud to carry his first own gun, as he treads gingerly but  somewhat noisily over the fallen leaves and dry twigs, scanning with  quick glances the thickets, imagining himself the last Mohican on the  warpath, or Leather-Stocking scouting in the primeval wilderness.    Under his breath he tells the confiding chickadees and woodpeckers what  undreamed-of danger they would be in from such a brave, were he not in  pursuit of nobler game. Then he hears a sudden rustle of the dry leaves,  the _quit! quit!_ of a partridge, catches a glimpse of a rapidly running  brown object, which on the instant is launched into a flashing  thunderous flight. Impelled by the instinct of the born sportsman, he  throws the gun to his shoulder, and scarcely with aim, but in the  direction of the sound, pulls trigger and fires.    On the instant he is ashamed of his impulsive haste, which fooled him  into wasting a precious charge on the inanimate evergreen twigs and sere  leaves that come dropping and floating down to his shot, and is thankful  that he is the only witness of his own foolishness.    But what is that? Above the patter and rustle of falling twigs and  leaves comes a dull thud, followed by the rapid beat of wings upon the  leaf-strewn earth. With heart beating as fast he runs toward the sound,  afraid to believe his senses, when he sees a noble grouse fluttering out  feebly his last gasp. He cannot be sure that it is not all a dream that  may vanish in a breath, till he has the bird safe in his hand, and then  he is faint with joy. Was there ever such a shot? Would that all the  world were here to see, for who can believe it just for the telling?  There never will be another such a bird, nor such a shot, for him. He  fires a dozen ineffectual ones at fair marks that day, but the glory of  that one shot would atone for twice as many misses, and he need not tell  of them, only of this, whereof he bears actual proof, though he himself  can hardly accept it, till again and again he tests it by admiring look  and touch.    Years after the killing of grouse on the wing has become a  matter-of-course occurrence in his days of upland shooting, the memory  of this stands clearest and best. Sixty years later the old wood road  winds through the same scene, by some marvel of kindliness or  oversight, untouched by the devastating axe, unchanged but by the forest  growth of half a century and its seemly and decorous decay. A thicker  screen of undergrowth borders the more faintly traced way. The  golden-brown shelves of the beech branches sweep more broadly above it,  the spires of the evergreens are nearer the sky, and the yellow towers  of the poplars are builded higher, but they are the same trees and  beneath them may yet be seen the gray stumps and trunks mouldered to  russet lines, of their ancient brethren who fell when these were  saplings.    The gray-bearded man who comes along the old wood road wonders at the  little change so many years have made in the scene of the grand  achievements of his youth, and in his mind he runs over the long  calendar to assure himself that so many autumns have glowed and faded  since that happy day. How can he have grown old, his ear dull to the  voices of the woods, his sight dim with the slowly but surely falling  veil of coming blindness, so that even now the road winds into a misty  haze just before him, yet these trees be young and lusty?    As they and the unfaded page of memory record the years, it was but a  little while ago that his heart was almost bursting with pride of that  first triumph. Would that he might once more feel that delicious pang of  joy.    Hark! There is the _quit! quit!_ of a grouse, and there another and  another, and the patter and rustle of their retreating footsteps,  presently launching into sudden flight, vaguely seen in swift bolts of  gray, hurtling among gray tree trunks and variegated foliage. True to  the old instinct his gun leaps to his shoulder, and he fires again and  again at the swift target. But the quick eye no longer guides the aim,  the timely finger no longer pulls the trigger, and the useless pellets  waste themselves on the leaves and twigs.    The woods are full of grouse, as if all the birds of the region had  congregated here to mock his failing sight and skill. On every side they  burst away from him like rockets, and his quick but futile charges in  rapid succession are poured in their direction, yet not a bird falls,  nor even a feather wavers down through the still October air. His dim  eyes refuse to mark down the birds that alight nearest; he can only  vaguely follow their flight by the whirring rush of wings and the click  of intercepting branches.    He is not ashamed of his loss of skill, only grieved to know that his  shooting days are over, yet he is glad there is no one near to see his  failure. He makes renunciation of all title to the name of a crack shot,  too well knowing that this is no brief lapse of skill, but the final,  inevitable falling off of the quick eye and sure hand. Slowly and sadly  he makes his way to where the shaded path merges into the sunny  clearing. There, from the cover of the last bush, a laggard bird springs  as if thrown from a catapult, describing in his flight an arc of a great  circle, and clearly defined against the steel-blue sky.    Again the gun springs instinctively to the shoulder, the instantaneous  aim is taken well ahead on the line of flight, the trigger pressed in  the nick of time, the charge explodes, and out of a cloud of feathers  drifting and whirling in the eddies of his own wing-beats, the noble  bird sweeps downward in the continuation of the course that ends with a  dull thud on the pasture sward.    The old sportsman lifts his clean-killed bird without a thrill of  exultation--he is only devoutly thankful for the happy circumstance  which made successful the last shot he will ever fire, and that not as a  miss he may remember it. Henceforth untouched by him his gun shall hang  upon the wall, its last use linked with the pleasant memory of his last  shot.          XL    NOVEMBER DAYS      In a midsummer sleep one dreams of winter, its cold, its silence and  desolation all surrounding him; then awakes, glad to find himself in the  reality of the light and warmth of summer.    Were we dreaming yesterday of woods more gorgeous in their leafage than  a flower garden in the flush of profusest bloom, so bright with  innumerable tints that autumnal blossoms paled beside them as stars at  sunrise? Were we dreaming of air soft as in springtime, of the gentle  babble of brooks, the carol of bluebirds, the lazy chirp of crickets,  and have we suddenly awakened to be confronted by the desolation of  naked forests, the more forlorn for the few tattered remnants of gay  apparel that flutter in the bleak wind? To hear but the sullen roar of  the chill blast and the clash of stripped boughs, the fitful scurry of  wind-swept leaves and the raving of swollen streams, swelling and  falling as in changing stress of passion, and the heavy leaden patter of  rain on roof and sodden leaves and earth?    Verily, the swift transition is like a pleasant dream with an unhappy  awakening. Yet not all November days are dreary. Now the sun shines warm  from the steel-blue sky, its eager rays devour the rime close on the  heels of the retreating shadows, and the north wind sleeps. The voice of  the brimming stream falls to an even, softer cadence, like the murmur of  pine forests swept by the light touch of a steady breeze.    Then the wind breathes softly from the south, and there drifts with it  from warmer realms, or arises at its touch from the earth about us, or  falls from the atmosphere of heaven itself, not smoke, nor haze, but  something more ethereal than these: a visible air, balmy with odors of  ripeness as the breath of June with perfume of flowers. It pervades  earth and sky, which melt together in it, till the bounds of neither are  discernible, and blends all objects in the landscape beyond the near  foreground, till nothing is distinct but some golden gleam of sunlit  water, bright as the orb that shines upon it. Flocks of migrating geese  linger on the stubble fields, and some laggard crows flap lazily athwart  the sky or perch contentedly upon the naked treetops as if they cared to  seek no clime more genial. The brief heavenly beauteousness of Indian  summer has fallen upon the earth, a few tranquil days of ethereal  mildness dropped into the sullen or turbulent border of winter.    In November days, as in all others, the woods are beautiful to the lover  of nature and to the sportsman who in their love finds the finer flavor  of his pastime. Every marking of the gray trunks, each moss-patch and  scale of lichen on them, is shown more distinctly now in the intercepted  light, and the delicate tracery of the bare branches and their netted  shadows on the rumpled carpet of the forest floor, have a beauty as  distinctive as the fullness of green or frost-tinted leafage and its  silhouette of shade.    No blossom is left in woods or fields, save where in the one the  witch-hazel unfolds its unseasonable flowers yellow beneath cold skies,  or a pink blossom of herb-robert holds out with modest bravery in a  sheltered cranny of the rocks; and where in the other, the ghostly bloom  of everlasting rustles above the leafless stalks in the wind-swept  pastures. There are brighter flashes of color in the sombre woods where  the red winter-berries shine on their leafless stems and the orange and  scarlet clusters of the twining bitter-sweet light"]]]
