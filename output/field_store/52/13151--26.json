And we most of us know that these  distressing hues are to be seen in some flowers. I remember that I  once went into a florist's shop, and seeing a great mass of hard  purple-red cinerarias on a shelf I made some remark about them. \"Yes,  are they not beautiful?\" said the woman in the shop. \"No, I loathe the  sight of them,\" I returned. \"So do I!\" she said very quickly, and then  added that she called them beautiful because she had to sell them.  She, too, had no doubt seen that same purple-red colour in the evil  flower called \"grog-blossom,\" and in the faces of many middle-aged  lovers of the bottle, male and female, who would perish before their  time, to the great relief of their kindred, and whose actions after  they were gone would not smell sweet and blossom in the dust.    The reds we like best in flowers are the delicate roseate and pinky  shades; they are more to us than the purest and most luminous tints.  And here, as with bird notes which delight us on account of their  resemblance to fresh, young, highly musical human voices, flowers  please us best when they exhibit the loveliest human tints--the apple  blossom and the bindweed, musk mallow and almond and wild rose, for  example. After these we are most taken with the deeper but soft and  not too luminous reds--the red which we admire in the red  horse-chestnut blossom, and many other flowers, down to the minute  pimpernel. Next come the intense rosy reds seen in the herb-robert and  other wild geraniums, valerian, red campion and ragged robin; and this  shade of red, intensified but still soft, is seen in the willow-herb  and foxglove, and, still more intensified, in the bell- and  small-leafed heath. Some if not all of these pleasing reds have purple  in them, and there are very many distinctly purple flowers that appeal  to us in the same way that red flowers do, receiving their expression  from the same cause. There is some purple colour in most skins, and  even some blue.       The azured harebell, like thy veins,    is a familiar verse from Cymbeline; any one can see the resemblance to  the pale blue of that admired and loved blossom in the blue veins of  any person with a delicate skin. Purples and purplish reds in masses  are mostly seen in young persons of delicate skins and high colour in  frosty weather in winter, when the eyes sparkle and the face glows  with the happy sensations natural to the young and healthy during and  after outdoor exercise. The skin purples and purple-reds here  described are beautiful, and may be matched to a nicety in many  flowers; the human purple may be seen (to name a very common wild  flower) in purple loosestrife and the large marsh mallow, and in  dozens and scores of other familiar purple flowers; and the purple-red  hue in many richly coloured skins has its exact shade in common  hounds' tongue, and in other dark and purple-red flowers. But we  always find, I fancy, that the expression due to human association in  a purple flower is greatest when this colour (as in the human face) is  placed side by side or fades into some shade of red or pink. I think  we may see this even in a small flower like the fumitory, in which one  portion is deep purple and all the rest of the blossoms a delicate  pink. Even when the red is very intense, as in the common field poppy,  the pleasing expression of purple on red is very evident.    To return to pure reds. We may say that just as purples in flowers  look best, or have a greater degree of expression, when appearing in  or with reds, so do the most delicate rose and pink shades appeal most  to us when they appear as a tinge or blush on white flowers. Probably  the flower that gives the most pleasure on account of its beautiful  flesh-tints of different shades is the Gloire de Dijon rose, so common  with us and so universal a favourite. Roses, being mostly of the  garden, are out of my line, but they are certainly glorious to look  at--glorious because of their associations, their expression, whether  we know it or not. One can forgive Thomas Carew the conceit in his  lines--       Ask me no more where Jove bestows     When June is past, the fading rose,     For in your beauty's orient deep     These flowers as in their causes sleep.    But all reds have something human, even the most luminous scarlets and  crimsons--the scarlet verbena, the poppy, our garden geraniums,  etc.--although in intensity they so greatly surpass the brightest colour  of the lips and the most vivid blush on the cheek. Luminous reds are  not, however, confined to lips and cheeks: even the fingers when held up  before the eyes to the sun or to firelight show a very delicate and  beautiful red; and this same brilliant floral hue is seen at times in  the membrane of the ear. It is, in fact, the colour of blood, and that  bright fluid, which is the life, and is often spilt, comes very much  into the human associations of flowers. The Persian poet, whose name is  best left unwritten, since from hearing it too often most persons are  now sick and tired of it, has said,       I sometimes think that never blooms so red     The rose as where some buried Caesar bled.    There is many and many a \"plant of the blood of men.\" Our most common  Love-lies-bleeding with its \"dropping wells\" of crimson serves to  remind us that there are numberless vulgar names that express this  resemblance and association. The thought or fancy is found everywhere  in poetic literature, in the fables of antiquity, in the tales and  folk-lore of all nations, civilised and barbarous.    I think that we can more quickly recognise this human interest in a  flower, due to its colour, and best appreciate its aesthetic value from  this cause, when we turn from the blues, purples, and reds, to the  whites and the yellows. The feeling these last give us is distinctly  different in character from that produced by the others. They are not  like us, nor like any living sentient thing we are related to: there  is no kinship, no human quality.    When I say \"no kinship, no human quality,\" I refer to flowers that are  entirely pure white or pure yellow; in some dull or impure yellows,  and in white and yellow flowers that have some tinge or mixture of red  or purple, we do get the expression of the red and purple flower. The  crystalline and snow white of the whitest flowers do indeed resemble  the white of the eyeballs and the teeth in human faces; but we may see  that this human white colour by itself has no human association in a  flower.    The whiteness of the white flower where there is any red is never  unhuman, probably because a very brilliant red or rose colour on some  delicate skins causes the light flesh-tints to appear white by  contrast, and is the complexion known as \"milk and roses.\" The  apple-blossom is a beautiful example, and the beloved daisy--the \"wee,  modest, crimson-tipped flower,\" which would be so much less dear but  for that touch of human crimson. This is the herb-Margaret of so many  tender and pretty legends, that has white for purity and red for  repentance. Even those who have never read these legends and that  prettiest, most pathetic of all which tells of the daisy's origin,  find a secret charm in the flower. Among other common examples are the  rosy-white hawthorn, wood anemone, bindweed, dropwort, and many  others. In the dropwort the rosy buds are seen among the creamy white  open flowers; and the expression is always very marked and beautiful  when there is any red or purple tinge or blush on cream-whites and  ivory-whites. When we look from the dropwort to its nearest relative,  the common meadow-sweet, we see how great a charm the touch of  rose-red has given to the first: the meadow-sweet has no expression of  the kind we are considering--no human association.    In pure yellow flowers, as in pure white, human interest is wanting.  It is true that yellow is a human colour, since in the hair we find  yellows of different shades--it is a pity that we cannot find, or have  not found, a better word than \"shades\" for the specific differences of  a colour. There is the so-called tow, the tawny, the bronze, the  simple yellow, and the golden, which includes many varieties, and the  hair called carroty. But none of these has the flower yellow. Richard  Jefferies tells us that when he placed a sovereign by the side of a  dandelion he saw how unlike the two colours were--that, in fact, no  two colours could seem more unlike than the yellow of gold and the  yellow of the flower. It is not necessary to set a lock of hair and  any yellow flower side by side to know how utterly different the hues  are. The yellow of the hair is like that of metals, of clay, of stone,  and of various earthy substances, and like the fur of some mammals,  and like xanthophyll in leaf and stalk, and the yellow sometimes seen  in clouds. When Ossian, in his famous address to the sun, speaks of  his yellow hair floating on the eastern clouds, we instantly feel the  truth as well as beauty of the simile. We admire the yellow flower for  the purity and brilliance of its colour, just as we admire some bird  notes solely for the purity and brightness of the sound, however  unlike the human voice they may be. We also admire it in many  instances for the exquisite beauty of its form, and the beauty of the  contrast of pure yellow and deep green, as in the yellow flag,  mimulus, and numerous other plants. But however much we may admire, we  do not experience that intimate and tender feeling which the blues and  reds inspire in us; in other words, the yellow flower has not the  expression which distinguishes those of other colours. Thus, when  Tennyson speaks of the \"speedwell's darling blue,\" we know that he is  right--that he expresses a feeling about this flower common to all of  us; but no poet would make so great, so absurd a mistake as to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37814"],[0,"The Story of Magellan and The Discovery of the Philippines (#19)"],[1,"of Darien, and where the southern sea was separated  from the western, in which are the Spanish Islands, by a very narrow  piece of land. So the ship sailed again from Thedori, and, having gone  twelve degrees on the other side of the equinoctial line, they did not  find the Cape of Cattigara, which Ptolemy supposed to extend even beyond  the equinoctial line; and when they had traversed an immense space of  sea, they came to the Cape of Good Hope and afterward to the Islands of  the Hesperides.    \"And, as this ship let in water, being much knocked about by this long  voyage, the sailors, many of whom had died by hardships by land and by  sea, could not clear the ship of water. Wherefore they landed upon one  of the islands, which is named after Saint James, to buy slaves.    \"But as our men had no money, they offered, sailor fashion, cloves for  the slaves. This matter having come to the ears of the Portuguese who  were in command of the island, thirteen of our men were thrown into  prison. The rest were eighteen in number.    \"Frightened by the strangeness of this behavior, they started straight  for Spain, leaving their shipmates behind them. And so, in the sixteenth  month after leaving Thedori, they arrived safe and sound on the 6th of  September, at the port near Hispalis (Seville). Worthier, indeed, are  our sailors of eternal fame than the Argonauts who sailed with Jason to  Colchis. And much more worthy was their ship of being placed among the  stars than that old Argo; for that only sailed from Greece through  Pontus, but ours from Hispalis to the South; and after that, through the  whole West and the Southern hemisphere, penetrating into the East, and  again returned to the West.\"    His subscription is interesting:      \"I commend myself most humbly to your reverence. Given at Vallisoleti,  on the 23d of October, 1522.        \"Your most reverend and illustrious lordship's          \"Most humble and constant servant,                  \"MAXIMILIANUS TRANSYLVANUS.\"    When the spice ship began to fill with water, the officers sent for  native divers. But these, although very skillful, could not find the  place or the cause of the leak.    Let us change our view to a different scene, across the wide tropical  world.          CHAPTER XXII.    MESQUITA IN PRISON.      While the little ship Victoria, which had sought for Mesquita in vain,  was sailing around the world, and was returning laden with spice,  Mesquita himself remained shut out from the sun by the shadows of prison  walls. His lite became more and more silent and neglected.    We know not by what authority he was held in a dungeon for advising the  supposed crimes of his cousin Magellan. It could not have been that of  Juana, who was still watching over the tomb from which she expected her  husband to rise, nor by good Cardinal Ximenes, and possibly not by  Charles V himself, but perhaps by one of his ministers. It may have been  by the direction of Charles, for his imprisonment implies doubt;  otherwise with such an array of testimony against him, we might expect  he would have been executed.    Two years had passed over beautiful Seville, and the India House there  must have began to doubt the story of Gormez as not one of the other  ships returned. These ships might have been cast away in the wintry  seas that Gormez and his crew described, or the flag of Spain that the  daring Portuguese had set toward the Spice Islands of the East by the  way of the South might be seen again some day, rising over the  Guadalquivir.    Mesquita believed in his cousin Magellan; not only in him as a true man,  but as one who had a divine calling to fulfill; as one whom destiny had  allotted to lead the decisive events of mankind. He still felt that he  would prove another Columbus or Vasco da Gama.    The two priests whom Magellan had marooned had honestly thought Magellan  mad. But Mesquita had his own confessor, and we can easily fancy how the  prisoner must have opened his heart to him.    \"Padre, I am misunderstood,\" we can hear him say. \"Time tells the truth  about all men. Time vindicates all.    \"Padre, some messenger from Magellan will come back again. Time weighs  all events, and life is self revealing. The heralds will blow their  trumpets then, and the bells will ring.    \"Padre, they do well to prolong my life. Some day my prison doors will  open wide, and I shall ride through the streets of Seville, and those  who doubt me now will hail me as a heart that, was always true to a  Knight whose heart will be found true to the Emperor!\"    The lamp of his faith burned clear and odorous oil. He had a quiet  conscience. But how must the conspirators have felt during these  uncertain months? The ships did not return. That seemed to favor one  view of the madness of Magellan, and yet it did not leave them at ease.  There were some who reasoned: If Magellan were indeed mad on his own  ship, why might not one or more of the other ships have returned? If the  other ships had been loyal to the lantern of Magellan, and had kept  together, might the fleet not return again? Should it return what a  stigma would be cast on the characters of the cowardly mutineers! In  such a case Mesquita would become a hero, and the latter would have to  flee from their own names.    Charles V was in his promise of glory now. In 1519, as we have before  stated, he had been elected Emperor of Germany; and in 1520 he had been  crowned at Aix la Chapelle, amid great rejoicings, and the Pope had  bestowed upon him the title of Caesar or Emperor of the Roman world. He  was called \"Caesar\" in the chronicles of the times.    Poor Juana took no interest in any of these pomps of her son, as they  shook the world. Her ears were deaf to them, her heart was dead to them  all. The mother of \"Caesar\" was almost the only person in Spain who  hailed not the glory of Caesar.    Amid all the splendors of his court the dream of Magellan must still  have haunted the mind of the new Caesar. He had accepted the story  brought by the returned ship; but Magellan the madman might come back  again. Madmen had returned before.    The period was a wonderful one. Printing, the art of which had been but  recently developed after the discovery of Gutenberg, was revealing its  great possibilities. These were the times of Francis in France, and of  Henry VIII in England. The Reformation was overturning Germany. The  whole world seemed to be changing.    If the ships of Magellan were to find a new way to the East, and were to  sail around the world, what surprising events might follow!    So, night after night, Mesquita could but hope and ask:    \"Where is the lantern of Magellan now?\"    Seville was full of maritime prosperity. The tuneful bells in her many  churches had frequent occasions to ring out for national festivals. The  sailors loved these services, and especially those that celebrated the  triumphs of the Virgin whose dominion had become, as was supposed, the  sea, and who was hailed as the \"Star of the Deep.\"    The happy crowds on their way to the rejoicing churches must have passed  the prison walls where Mesquita was detained. Life indeed must have been  mysterious to him. The world in which he deserved so much honor and  happiness was shut out from him--even the sun and stars.          CHAPTER XXIII.    STRANGE STORIES.--THE WISE OLD WOMEN.--THE WALKING LEAVES.--THE HAUNTED  SANDALWOOD TREES.--THE EMPEROR OF CHINA.--THE LITTLE BOY AND THE GIANT  BIRD.      Pigafetta was no Munchausen, but he had a love of marvelous stories, and  there never was a voyage that offered to a European a greater number of  curious events and superstitions. Some of the incidents that excited our  Chevalier's wonder were natural events which have been since explained.  The superstitious legends of the people were, however, for the most part  but the growth of folklore through the imagination.    One of these accounts relates to the wise old women who prepared the  sacrifices of the wild boar as offerings to the sun. It shows how small  may be the real meaning of pompous and pretentious ceremonies. The rites  took place in the Philippines.    Says Pigafetta in his narrative prepared for the Grand Master of the  Knight of Rhodes:    \"Since I have spoken of the idols, it may please your illustrious  Highness to have an account of the ceremony with which, in this island,  they bless the pig. They begin by sounding some great drums (tamburi);  they then bring three large dishes; two are filled with cakes of rice  and cooked millet rolled up in leaves, with roast fish; in the third are  Cambay cloths and two strips of palm cloth. A cloth of Cambay is spread  out on the ground; then two old women come, each of whom has in her hand  a reed trumpet. They step upon the cloth and make an obeisance to the  sun; they then clothe themselves with the above-mentioned cloths. The  first of these puts on her head a handkerchief which she ties on her  forehead so as to make two horns, and taking another handkerchief in her  hand, dances and sounds her trumpet and invokes the sun.    \"The second old woman takes one of the strips of palm cloth and dances,  and also sounds her trumpet; thus they dance and sound their trumpets  for a short space of time, saying several things to the sun. The first  old woman then drops the handkerchief she has in her hand and takes the  other strip of cloth, and both together sounding their trumpets, dance  for a long time round the pig which is bound on the ground. The first  one always speaks in a low tone to the sun, and the second answers her.  So the sun and the two old women had a luminous partnership.    \"The second old woman then presents a cup of wine to the first, who,  while they both continue their address to the sun, brings the cup four  or five times near the mouth as though going to drink, and meanwhile  sprinkles the wine on the heart of the pig. She then gives up the cup,  and"]]]
