Behold my heart, O Lord, who wouldest I should remember all this, and  confess to Thee. Let my soul cleave unto Thee, now that Thou hast freed  it from that fast-holding birdlime of death. How wretched was it! and  Thou didst irritate the feeling of its wound, that forsaking all else,  it might be converted unto Thee, who art above all, and without whom all  things would be nothing; be converted, and be healed. How miserable was  I then, and how didst Thou deal with me, to make me feel my misery on  that day, when I was preparing to recite a panegyric of the Emperor,  wherein I was to utter many a lie, and lying, was to be applauded by  those who knew I lied, and my heart was panting with these anxieties,  and boiling with the feverishness of consuming thoughts. For, passing  through one of the streets of Milan, I observed a poor beggar, then, I  suppose, with a full belly, joking and joyous: and I sighed, and spoke  to the friends around me, of the many sorrows of our frenzies; for that  by all such efforts of ours, as those wherein I then toiled dragging  along, under the goading of desire, the burthen of my own wretchedness,  and, by dragging, augmenting it, we yet looked to arrive only at that  very joyousness whither that beggar-man had arrived before us, who  should never perchance attain it. For what he had obtained by means of a  few begged pence, the same was I plotting for by many a toilsome turning  and winding; the joy of a temporary felicity. For he verily had not the  true joy; but yet I with those my ambitious designs was seeking one much  less true. And certainly he was joyous, I anxious; he void of care, I  full of fears. But should any ask me, had I rather be merry or fearful?  I would answer merry. Again, if he asked had I rather be such as he was,  or what I then was? I should choose to be myself, though worn with cares  and fears; but out of wrong judgment; for, was it the truth? For I ought  not to prefer myself to him, because more learned than he, seeing I  had no joy therein, but sought to please men by it; and that not to  instruct, but simply to please. Wherefore also Thou didst break my bones  with the staff of Thy correction.    Away with those then from my soul who say to her, \"It makes a difference  whence a man's joy is. That beggar-man joyed in drunkenness; Thou  desiredst to joy in glory.\" What glory, Lord? That which is not in  Thee. For even as his was no true joy, so was that no true glory: and  it overthrew my soul more. He that very night should digest his  drunkenness; but I had slept and risen again with mine, and was to sleep  again, and again to rise with it, how many days, Thou, God, knowest. But  \"it doth make a difference whence a man's joy is.\" I know it, and the  joy of a faithful hope lieth incomparably beyond such vanity. Yea, and  so was he then beyond me: for he verily was the happier; not only for  that he was thoroughly drenched in mirth, I disembowelled with cares:  but he, by fair wishes, had gotten wine; I, by lying, was seeking for  empty, swelling praise. Much to this purpose said I then to my friends:  and I often marked in them how it fared with me; and I found it went ill  with me, and grieved, and doubled that very ill; and if any prosperity  smiled on me, I was loth to catch at it, for almost before I could grasp  it, it flew away.    These things we, who were living as friends together, bemoaned together,  but chiefly and most familiarly did I speak thereof with Alypius and  Nebridius, of whom Alypius was born in the same town with me, of persons  of chief rank there, but younger than I. For he had studied under me,  both when I first lectured in our town, and afterwards at Carthage, and  he loved me much, because I seemed to him kind, and learned; and I him,  for his great towardliness to virtue, which was eminent enough in one of  no greater years. Yet the whirlpool of Carthaginian habits (amongst whom  those idle spectacles are hotly followed) had drawn him into the  madness of the Circus. But while he was miserably tossed therein, and  I, professing rhetoric there, had a public school, as yet he used not my  teaching, by reason of some unkindness risen betwixt his father and me.  I had found then how deadly he doted upon the Circus, and was deeply  grieved that he seemed likely, nay, or had thrown away so great promise:  yet had I no means of advising or with a sort of constraint reclaiming  him, either by the kindness of a friend, or the authority of a master.  For I supposed that he thought of me as did his father; but he was not  such; laying aside then his father's mind in that matter, he began to  greet me, come sometimes into my lecture room, hear a little, and be  gone.    I however had forgotten to deal with him, that he should not, through  a blind and headlong desire of vain pastimes, undo so good a wit. But  Thou, O Lord, who guidest the course of all Thou hast created, hadst  not forgotten him, who was one day to be among Thy children, Priest  and Dispenser of Thy Sacrament; and that his amendment might plainly be  attributed to Thyself, Thou effectedst it through me, unknowingly. For  as one day I sat in my accustomed place, with my scholars before me,  he entered, greeted me, sat down, and applied his mind to what I  then handled. I had by chance a passage in hand, which while I was  explaining, a likeness from the Circensian races occurred to me, as  likely to make what I would convey pleasanter and plainer, seasoned  with biting mockery of those whom that madness had enthralled; God, Thou  knowest that I then thought not of curing Alypius of that infection. But  he took it wholly to himself, and thought that I said it simply for his  sake. And whence another would have taken occasion of offence with me,  that right-minded youth took as a ground of being offended at himself,  and loving me more fervently. For Thou hadst said it long ago, and put  it into Thy book, Rebuke a wise man and he will love Thee. But I had  not rebuked him, but Thou, who employest all, knowing or not knowing, in  that order which Thyself knowest (and that order is just), didst of my  heart and tongue make burning coals, by which to set on fire the  hopeful mind, thus languishing, and so cure it. Let him be silent in Thy  praises, who considers not Thy mercies, which confess unto Thee out of  my inmost soul. For he upon that speech burst out of that pit so deep,  wherein he was wilfully plunged, and was blinded with its wretched  pastimes; and he shook his mind with a strong self-command; whereupon  all the filths of the Circensian pastimes flew off from him, nor came he  again thither. Upon this, he prevailed with his unwilling father that he  might be my scholar. He gave way, and gave in. And Alypius beginning  to be my hearer again, was involved in the same superstition with me,  loving in the Manichees that show of continency which he supposed true  and unfeigned. Whereas it was a senseless and seducing continency,  ensnaring precious souls, unable as yet to reach the depth of virtue,  yet readily beguiled with the surface of what was but a shadowy and  counterfeit virtue.    He, not forsaking that secular course which his parents had charmed him  to pursue, had gone before me to Rome, to study law, and there he was  carried away incredibly with an incredible eagerness after the shows of  gladiators. For being utterly averse to and detesting spectacles, he was  one day by chance met by divers of his acquaintance and fellow-students  coming from dinner, and they with a familiar violence haled him,  vehemently refusing and resisting, into the Amphitheatre, during these  cruel and deadly shows, he thus protesting: \"Though you hale my body to  that place, and there set me, can you force me also to turn my mind or  my eyes to those shows? I shall then be absent while present, and  so shall overcome both you and them.\" They, hearing this, led him on  nevertheless, desirous perchance to try that very thing, whether he  could do as he said. When they were come thither, and had taken their  places as they could, the whole place kindled with that savage pastime.  But he, closing the passage of his eyes, forbade his mind to range  abroad after such evil; and would he had stopped his ears also! For in  the fight, when one fell, a mighty cry of the whole people striking him  strongly, overcome by curiosity, and as if prepared to despise and be  superior to it whatsoever it were, even when seen, he opened his eyes,  and was stricken with a deeper wound in his soul than the other, whom he  desired to behold, was in his body; and he fell more miserably than he  upon whose fall that mighty noise was raised, which entered through his  ears, and unlocked his eyes, to make way for the striking and beating  down of a soul, bold rather than resolute, and the weaker, in that it  had presumed on itself, which ought to have relied on Thee. For so soon  as he saw that blood, he therewith drunk down savageness; nor turned  away, but fixed his eye, drinking in frenzy, unawares, and was delighted  with that guilty fight, and intoxicated with the bloody pastime. Nor was  he now the man he came, but one of the throng he came unto, yea, a true  associate of theirs that brought him thither. Why say more? He beheld,  shouted, kindled, carried thence with him the madness which should goad  him to return not only with them who first drew him thither, but also  before them, yea and to draw in others. Yet thence didst Thou with a  most strong and most merciful hand pluck him, and taughtest him to have  confidence not in himself, but in Thee. But this was after.    But this was already being laid up in his memory to be a medicine  hereafter. So was that also, that when he was yet studying under me at  Carthage, and was thinking over at mid-day in the market-place what he  was to say "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32982"],[0,"Student's Hand-book of Mushrooms of America, Edible and Poisonous (#19)"],[1,"in milk and then fried in butter.    Of the genus Fistulina but one species, Fistulina hepatica, figured in  Plate X, is recorded as edible and indigenous to this country.         [Illustration: Plate X.

MAYO, del.]         PLATE X.         =Fistulina hepatica= Bull. \"_Beefsteak Mushroom_,\" \"_Liver Fungus_.\"         EDIBLE.    _Genus Fistulina_ Bull. Hymenophore fleshy, hymenium inferior, that is,  on the under surface of the cap, at first papillose; the papillae at  length elongated, and forming distinct tubes.    Besides Fistulina _hepatica_, five species of this genus are recorded in  Saccardo's Sylloge, viz., F. _radicata_ Schw., F. _spathulata_ B. & C.,  F. _pallida_ B. & R., F. _rosea_ Mont., and F. _antarctica_ Speg.; the  last indigenous to Patagonia.    F. _hepatica_ is the only species with which I am familiar. The plants  of this species are very irregular in form, rootless, epiphytal, often  stemless, and sometimes attached to the matrix by a very short stem.  This fungus is frequently found upon old oak, chestnut, and ash trees,  developing in the rotting bark. It appears first as a rosy pimple, or in  a series of red granules. In a very short time it becomes tongue-shaped,  sometimes kidney shaped, assuming the color of a beet root. As it  increases in size it changes form again, becoming broad in proportion to  its length, and changing in color to a deep blood red, and finally to a  dull liver tint. Its lower surface is often paler than its upper, it  being tinged with yellow and pinkish hues.    One author states that it requires about two weeks to attain its highest  development, after which it gradually decays.    It varies in size from a few inches to several feet in circumference.  Rev. M. J. Berkeley mentions one which weighed thirty pounds. It has  been styled, the \"_poor man's fungus_,\" and in flavor resembles meat  more than any other.    The substance is fleshy and juicy in the early stage. The pileus is  papillose, the papillae elongated, and forming distinct tubes as the  pileus expands. These tubes are separable from each other, and with age  become approximate and jagged at their orifices. The tubes are at first  yellowish, with a pink tinge, becoming dingy with age. The fleshy  substance, or hymenophore, is often veined in light and dark red  streaks. The juice is pellucid, red, and slightly acid. Spores at first  nearly round, becoming elliptical, salmon color.    This fungus is esteemed in Europe, where it is eaten prepared in a  variety of ways.    When young and tender it can be sliced and broiled or minced and stewed,  making a delicious dish. When too old the stock is rather tough for good  eating, but the gravy taken from it forms a rich flavoring for a  vegetable stew or a meat ragout. The following recipe for cooking this  mushroom has been recommended:        Slice and macerate it, add pepper and salt, a little lemon, and      chopped onions or garlic; then strain and boil the liquid, which      makes most excellent gravy, resembling that of good beefsteak.    The Fistulina hepatica is well known in Europe, and is found in  different parts of the United States, in some places growing abundantly.  I have gathered some fine specimens in Maryland and Virginia, but none  as large as that described by Dr. Berkeley.          RECIPES FOR COOKING MUSHROOMS.      _To Pot Mushrooms._--The small open mushrooms suit best for potting.  Trim and rub them; put into a stewpan a quart of mushrooms, 3 ounces of  butter, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt, and half a teaspoonful of cayenne and  mace, mixed, and stew for ten or fifteen minutes, or till the mushrooms  are tender; take them carefully out and drain them perfectly on a  sloping dish, and when cold press them into small pots and pour  clarified butter over them, in which state they will keep for a week or  two. Writing-paper placed over the butter, and over that melted suet,  will effectually preserve them for weeks in a dry, cool place.    _To Pickle Mushrooms._--Select a number of sound, small pasture  mushrooms, as nearly alike as possible in size. Throw them for a few  minutes into cold water, then drain them, cut off the stalks, and gently  rub off the outer skin with a moist flannel dipped in salt; then boil  the vinegar, adding to each quart two ounces of salt, half a nutmeg  grated, a dram of mace, and an ounce of white pepper corns. Put the  mushrooms into the vinegar for ten minutes over the fire; then pour the  whole into small jars, taking care that the spices are equally divided;  let them stand a day, then cover them.    _Baked Mushrooms._--Peel the tops of twenty mushrooms; cut off a portion  of the stalks and wipe them carefully with a piece of flannel dipped in  salt. Lay the mushrooms in a tin dish, put a small piece of butter on  the top of each, and season with pepper and salt. Set the dish in the  oven and bake them from twenty minutes to half an hour. When done,  arrange them high in the centre of a very hot dish, pour the sauce  around them, and serve quickly and as hot as you possibly can.    _Mushrooms with Bacon._--Take some full-grown mushrooms, and, having  cleaned them, procure a few rashers of nice streaky bacon and fry them  in the usual manner. When nearly done add a dozen or so of mushrooms  and fry them slowly until they are cooked. In this process they will  absorb all the fat of the bacon, and with the addition of a little salt  and pepper will form a most appetizing breakfast relish.    _Mushroom Pie._--A very good mushroom pie is made in the following  manner: Chop a quart of mushrooms into small pieces, season to taste,  and add one pound of round steak chopped fine and seasoned with a small  piece of onion. If the steak is lean, add a small piece of suet, unless  butter is preferred to give flavor. Put the chopped steak and mushrooms  in deep saucepan with cover, and stew slowly until tender. Make a crust  as for beefsteak pie and put in a deep earthern dish, lightly browning  the under crust before adding the stew, and cover with a crust lightly  punctured.    In some parts of Russia mushrooms form an important part of the diet of  the people, especially during the Lenten season, when the fast of the  Greek church is very strictly kept, and meat, fish, eggs, and butter are  forbidden.    Provision is made for this season in the securing of quantities of dried  and salted mushrooms, which are cut up in strips and made into salads  with a dressing of olive oil and vinegar. The poorer classes to whom the  olive oil is unattainable use the rape seed and other vegetable oils in  the cooking of their mushrooms.    The following recipes are translated from a recently published Russian  work on the subject of mushrooms, cultivated and wild:    Select fresh, sound Boleti, cut off the caps, and, after wiping clean  with a napkin, place them in a sieve, pouring over them scalding water;  when thoroughly drained, leave them where there is a free current of air  until perfectly dry. Next string them upon stout twine, leaving spaces  between to allow of free circulation of air. If convenient, they can be  dried artificially by placing in a not too hot oven with the door open.  Dried by either method, they can be kept all winter. Before using, they  should be soaked in water or milk until soft. In this condition they  make very good flavoring for soup or gravy, and can also be used as  filling for pies.    _Mushrooms Cooked in Butter._--Wipe the mushrooms clean and dip in dry  flour. Heat a quantity of butter to boiling temperature in a saucepan,  seasoning with a small piece of onion. Drop the flour-covered mushrooms  into the boiling butter, shaking the pan constantly over the fire. When  the mushrooms are cooked add sour cream to taste. Before serving,  sprinkle with grated muscat nut.    _Mushroom Pickle._--Select only young button mushrooms. Put them for a  few moments in boiling water lightly salted and vinegared. Boil vinegar  (only the best should be used), spicing it according to taste. Allow the  vinegar to cool. Put the mushrooms in layers in a jar and pour over them  enough spiced vinegar to cover. Seal tightly.    _Salted Piperites._--Only the caps are taken of the Lactarius piperites.  They are placed first in salted scalding water for several minutes. The  water is then gently pressed out with a napkin, the mushrooms are  placed on sieves and cold water poured over them. They are then placed  in layers in a jar, each layer sprinkled with salt, and whole pepper and  minced onion scattered over the layer. When the jar is full a thin round  board is placed upon the top layer and pressed down with weights, and as  the mass gives way mushrooms are added until the jar is compactly  filled. The jar is then covered with parchment or otherwise tightly  sealed. Eight gallons of mushrooms require from one to one and a half  glasses of salt. This makes a good salad when treated with oil.    NOTE.--L. piperites is an extremely acrid mushroom when in the raw  state, and the Russians do not stew it, but prepare it in the above way,  taking the precaution to scald thoroughly with salted water before  putting away. The precaution of scalding through several waters is a  wise one to use in the preparation of all mushrooms inasmuch as the  poisonous principle of most mushrooms is soluble in scalding water.  Dilute vinegar is frequently used in the same manner. Vinegar should not  be used in metal vessels unless porcelain-lined.          LIST OF THE GENERA OF HYMENOMYCETES.
