It pushes  itself beneath this loop and waits for several hours before the skin  breaks open along the back and is gradually shuffled off revealing the  chrysalis in position. A week or two later the fully developed  butterfly emerges from the chrysalis.    These yellow butterflies lend a distinctive charm to our summer  landscapes. They are constantly to be seen fluttering from place to  place, lightly visiting flowers of many kinds from which they suck the  nectar, and gathering in great colonies by roadside pools where they  seem to sip the moisture. There are many references to this insect in  the writings of New England authors. It evidently was an especial  favorite of James Russell Lowell who has often referred to it in  passages like this:    \"Those old days when the balancing of a yellow butterfly over a  thistle bloom was spiritual food and lodging for a whole forenoon.\"       =The Orange Sulphur=    _Eurymus eurytheme_    Were one able to take a Clouded Sulphur butterfly and change the  yellow to a deep orange color he could easily make a specimen that  would pass for the present species. The resemblance is very  remarkable and shows the close affinity between these two beautiful  insects.    Like so many others of this group the Orange Sulphur is essentially a  tropical species. In the eastern United States it is rarely found  north of latitude forty degrees, but south of that it becomes  increasingly abundant as one approaches the tropics. It occurs from  the Carolinas to Texas, and over the great range in which it lives it  takes on many different forms and habits. It is one of the most  remarkable examples of variation in coloring exhibited by any of the  butterflies. Nearly a dozen species names have been given to its  various disguises, all of which are now recognized as synonyms. In the  more northern regions where it is found, only one of these forms  usually occurs, but in other places bright yellow and pale white  varieties are found.    The life-history of this butterfly along latitude forty degrees is  very similar to that of the Clouded Sulphur. There seem to be usually  two broods and the caterpillars live upon leguminous plants,  especially alfalfa, buffalo clovers, wild senna, and other species of  Trifolium and Cassia. Apparently also it hibernates in both the  caterpillar and the butterfly stages.    In the extreme Southwest--as on the plains of Texas--the vegetation  dries up completely in summer so that there is no succulent leafage  for the caterpillars to live upon. In such cases the insect must  aestivate rather than hibernate. This species apparently succeeds in  doing this by having the caterpillars go into a more or less lethargic  condition in which they pass the summer. The adult butterflies utterly  disappear in June and are not seen again until early in autumn when  the autumn rains have started the growth of vegetation anew. The  insects then make up for lost time and produce several broods in rapid  succession.    In the Imperial Valley of California this butterfly is a serious pest  to alfalfa growers. It continues to reproduce throughout a very long  season, one brood following another from March until December, and in  mild winters there seems sometimes to be practically no cessation of  its activities. Mr. V. L. Wildermuth found that the development of a  generation in breeding cages in this valley varied from twenty-two to  forty-four days, the latter in cool, the former in hot weather. The  stages in the first and the third broods in spring varied thus: Egg,  first six days, third four days; larva, first thirty days, third  twelve days; chrysalis, first eight days, third five days. In this  case the first generation extended from March 15 to April 30 and the  third from May 28 to June 20. After the fourth brood of butterflies  there was such an overlapping of the various stages that it was  impossible to distinguish the broods.       =The Pink-edged Sulphur=    _Eurymus interior_    This beautiful butterfly was first made known to the world of science  by Louis Agassiz, the great naturalist who did so much to arouse a  scientific interest among Americans. He found it on a famous  expedition to the northern shores of Lake Superior, which not only  served to bring to light many interesting phases of geological history  but also laid the foundation for the copper mining industry which has  since become so important in that region. The butterfly thus brought  to light has been found to be a characteristic northern species,  occupying a rather narrow belt nearly along the fiftieth degree of  latitude and extending west almost to the Pacific Coast. The species  is occasionally taken as far south as the White Mountains and there  are indications that in this region there are two broods a year. The  male butterflies are known at once by a beautiful pink edge on all the  margins; they bear otherwise a close resemblance to our common Sulphur  Yellow. The females are much lighter in color, often having no black  markings on the upper surface of the hind wings.       =The Black-bordered Yellow=    _Eurema nicippe_    This is essentially a tropical butterfly which has spread out over  most of our Southern states where it is abundant and widely  distributed. It adds a distinct touch of color and life to many  landscapes when the butterflies swarm by thousands upon clover  blossoms and other low vegetation. The eggs are laid upon the leaves  of clover and more especially upon some common species of Cassia, such  as wild senna. Each egg soon hatches into a small greenish cylindrical  worm, colored and striped in such a way that as it rests upon the leaf  it is easily overlooked. This larva develops rapidly and soon becomes  about an inch and a quarter long, being rather slender and fairly  smooth. It now spins a bit of silk upon a twig or some similar support  and also the frailest sort of a silken loop to pass around its back.  It now entangles its hind feet in the bit of silk and soon casts off  its last caterpillar skin, emerging as a curious looking chrysalis  about three quarters of an inch long with a remarkable pointed  projection on the front of the head. When seen through a hand lens  this pointed projection and the well-developed characteristic wing  sheaths give the chrysalis a remarkable resemblance to some of the  twig hoppers or Membracids. The colors vary considerably with the  surroundings but are commonly toned in various shades of green and  yellow brown.    A little later each chrysalis breaks open to disclose one of the  beautiful butterflies.    The conditions under which this butterfly lives at the limit of its  northern range are not well determined. It is probable that many of  those seen here have flown from considerably farther south, and that  these migrants lay eggs from which a brood of butterflies develops,  these native born appearing late in summer. Presumably the latter  hibernate, but whether they can do this successfully under the  rigorous conditions of our northern winters has never been determined.  In fact, Scudder wrote some years ago that no caterpillars had ever  been found in New England. Here is an interesting opportunity for some  young observer to make a real contribution to science.       =The Little Sulphur=    _Eurema lisa_    Were one to imagine a Clouded Sulphur butterfly reduced to half its  usual size and built with a corresponding delicacy of structure, one  would have a pretty good idea of the beautiful little creature called  by the above name. I well remember in my college days taking what was  probably the first of these butterflies ever collected in the region  of our Michigan college. It was a prize that very likely had wandered  north from Indiana but which served to add much glory to the little  collection in which I took such pride, for this is essentially a  southern species. In many regions of the South it is so abundant that  it can be taken by any one. It ranges from coast to coast and extends  south into the tropics. In the eastern region it is found from  southern Wisconsin to southern New England, occurring sparingly and  locally in various places along the line thus indicated.    The food plant of the species is chiefly wild senna or other kinds of  Cassia. The mother butterflies deposit the eggs singly on leaves or  stems, generally on the small leaflets of the compound leaf. Less than  a week later each egg hatches into a cylindrical greenish caterpillar  that feeds upon the leaflets in a characteristic fashion. Instead of  devouring the blade from the margin inward it gnaws narrow strips  between the smaller veins. When not feeding, the caterpillars protect  themselves from observation by birds or other enemies by resting  motionless along the stem of the leaflet or else along the midrib on  the under side. As is well known the leaflets of Cassia, like other  leguminous plants, close at night. It is probably on this account that  these caterpillars feed chiefly by day. The general green color of the  skin and the straight stripe along the side help to make this  caterpillar very inconspicuous when it is at rest.    When full grown the caterpillar reaches a length of three quarters of  an inch. It now finds some bit of shelter on which it spins a bit of  flat web and a silken loop to hold it in place as it becomes a  chrysalis. It then changes and remains quiescent for ten days or more  when it emerges as the dainty butterfly.    Notwithstanding its abundance and its successive broods its  life-history is none too completely worked out. There is still  opportunity for careful observations upon the way in which it passes  the winter in various parts of its range. While in the South it  apparently hibernates as an adult, this fact is not certain in the  more northern localities.    Notwithstanding its diminutive size this butterfly has been known to  swarm in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3708"],[0,"An Introduction to Chemical Science (#19)"],[1,"the meeting of the American Association for the  Advancement of Science in 1887, a solid brick of CO2 was seen and  handled by the members, Liquid H is steel blue.

Examine brimstone, flowers of sulphur, pyrite, chalcopyrite,  sphalerite, galenite, gypsum, barite.    182. Separation.    Experiment 103.--To a solution of 2 g. of sodium sulphide,, Na2S2  in 10 cc. H2O add 3 or 4cc. HCl, and look for a ppt. Filter, and  examine the residue. It is lac sulphur, or milk of sulphur.    183. Crystals from Fusion.    Experiment 104.--In a beaker of 25 or 50 cc. capacity put 20 g.  brimstone. Place this over a flame with asbestos paper  interposed, and melt it slowly. Note the color of the liquid,  then let it cool, watching for crystals. When partly solidified  pour the liquid portion into an evapo- rating-dish of water, and  observe the crystals of S forming in the beaker (Fig. 42). The  hard mass may be separated from the glass by a little HNO3 and a  thin knife-blade, or by CS2.    184. Allotropy.    Experiment 105.--Place in a t.t. 15g of brimstone, then heat  slowly till it melts. Notice the thin amber-colored liquid. The  temperature is now a little above 100 degrees. As the heat  increases, notice that it grows darker till it becomes black and  so viscid that it cannot be poured out. It is now above 200  degrees. Still heat, and observe that it changes to a slightly  lighter color, and is again a thin liquid. At this time it is  above 300 degrees. Now pour a little into an evaporating dish  containing water. Examine this, noticing that it can be stretched  like rubber. Leave it in the water till it becomes hard. Continue  heating thebrimstone in the t.t. till it boils at about 450  degrees, and note the color of the escaping vapor. Just above  this point it takes fire. Cool the t.t., holding it in the light  meantime, and look for a sublimate of S on the sides.    185. Solution.    Experiment 106.--Place in an evaporating-dish a gram of powdered  brimstone, and add 5cc, CS2, carbon disulphide. Stir, and see  whether S is dissolved. Put this in a draft of air, and note the  evaporation of the liquid CS2, and the deposit of S crystals.  These crystals are different in form from those resulting from  cooling from fusion.    186. Theory of Allotropy.--The last three experiments well  illustrate allotropy. We found S to crystallize in two different  ways. Substances can crystallize in seven different systems, and  usually a given substance is found in one of these systems only;  e.g. galena is invariably cubical. An element having two such  forms is said to be dimorphous. If it crystallizes in three  systems, it is trimorphous. A crystal has a definite arrangement  of its molecules. If without crystalline form, a substance is  called amorphous. An illustration of amorphism was S after it had  been poured into water. Thus S has at least three allotropic  forms, and the gradations between these probably represent  others. Allotropy seems to be due to varied molecular structure.  We know but little of the molecular condition of solids and  liquids, since we have no law to guide us like Avogadro's in  gases; but, from the density of S vapor at different  temperatures, we infer that liquids and solids have their  molecules very differently made up from those of gases. The least  combining weight of S is 32. Its vapor density at 1,000 degrees  is 32; hence its molecular weight is 64, i.e. vapor density x 2;  and there are 2 atoms in its molecule at that temperature,  molecular weight / atomic weight. At 500 degrees, however, the  vapor density is 96and the molecular weight 192. At this degree  the molecule must contain 6 atoms. How many it has in the  allotropic forms, as a solid, is beyond our knowledge; but it  seems quite likely that allotropy is due to some change of  molecular structure.    The above experiments show two modes of obtaining crystals, by  fusion and by solution.    187. Occurrence and Purification.--Sulphur occurs both free and  combined, and is a very common element. It is found free in all  volcanic regions, but Sicily furnishes most of it. Great  quantities are thrown up from the interior of the earth during an  eruption. The heat of volcanic action probably separates it from  its compound, which may be CaSO4. Vast quantities of the  poisonous SO2 gas are also liberated during an eruption, this  being, in volume of gases evolved, next to H2O. S is crudely  separated from its earthy impurities in Sicily by piling it into  heaps, covering to prevent access of air, and igniting, when some  of the S burns, and the rest melts and is collected. After  removal from the island it is further purified by distilling in  retorts connected with large chambers where it sublimes on the  sides as flowers of sulphur (Fig. 43). This is melted and run  into molds, forming roll brimstone. S also occurs as a  constituent of animal and vegetable compounds, as in mustard,  hair, eggs, etc. The tarnishing of silver spoons by eggs is due  to the formation of silver sulphide, Ag2S. The yellow color of  eggs, however, is due to oils, not to S.    The main compounds of S are sulphides and sulphates. What acids  do they respectively represent? Metallic sulphides are as common  as oxides; e.g. FeS2, or pyrite, PbS, or galenite, ZnS, or  sphalerite, CuFeS2, or chalcopyrite, etc. The most abundant  sulphate is CaSO4, or gypsum. BaSO4, or barite, and Na2SO4, or  Glauber's salt, are others.    The only one of these compounds that is utilized for its S is  FeS2. In Europe this furnishes a great deal of the S for H2SO4. S  is obtained by roasting FeS2. 3 FeS2 = Fe3S4 + 2 S.    188. Uses. -The greatest use of S is in the manufacture of H2SO4.  A great deal is used in making gunpowder, matches, vulcanized  rubber, and the artificial sulphides, like HgS, H2S, CS2, etc.  The last is a very volatile, ill- smelling liquid, made by the  combination of two solids, S being passed over red-hot charcoal.  It dissolves S, P, rubber, gums, and many other substances  insoluble in H2O.    189. Sulphur Dioxide, SO2, has been made in many experiments. It  is a bleaching agent, a disinfectant, and a very active compound,  having great affinity for water, but it will not support  combustion. Like most disinfectants, it is very injurious to the  system. It is used to bleach silk and wool--animal substances--  and straw goods, which Cl would injure; but the color can be  restored, as the coloring molecule seems not to be broken up, but  to combine with SO2, which is again separated by reagents. Goods  bleached with SO2 often turn yellow after a time.    190. SO2 a Bleacher.    Experiment 107.-Test its bleaching power by burning S under a  receiver under which a wet rose or a green leaf is also placed.    Chapter XXXVIII.    HYDROGEN SULPHIDE.

(2) Pour  into a t.t. 5cc.solution AgNO3, and place the end of the d.t.  from a H2S generator into the solution and note the color of the  ppt. What is the ppt.? Write the equation. (3) Experiment in the  same way with Pb(NO3)2 solution. Write the equation. (4) Let some  H2S bubble into a t.t. of clean water. To see whether H2S is  soluble in H2O, put a few drops of the water on a silver coin.  Ag2S is formed. Describe, and write the equation. Do the same  with a copper coin. (5) Put a drop of lead acetate solution,  Pb(C2H3O2)2, on a piece of unglazed paper, and hold this before  the d.t. from which H2S is escap- ing. PbS is formed. Write the  equation. This is the characteristic test of H2S.    193. Combustion of H2S    Experiment 110.--Attach a philosopher's lamp tube to the H2S  generator, and, observing the same precautions as with H, light  the gas. What two products must be formed? State the reaction.  The color of the flame. Compute the molecular weight and the  vapor density of H2S. 194. Uses. -Hydrogen sulphide or  sulphuretted hydrogen, H2S, is employed chiefly as a reagent in  the chemical laboratory. It forms sulphides with many of the  metals, as shown in the last experiment. These are precipitated  from solution, and may be separated from other metals which are  not so precipitated, as was found in the case of HCl and NH4OH.  The subjoined experiment will illustrate this. Suppose we wished  to separate Pb from Ba, having salts of the two mixed together,  as Pb(NO3)2 and Ba(NO3)2.    195. H2S an Analyzer of Metals.    Experiment 111.--Pass Some H2S gas in to 5cc.solution Ba(NO3)2.  No ppt. is formed. Do the same with Pb(NO3)2 solution. A ppt.  appears. Now mix 5cc.of each of these solutions in a t.t. and  pass the gas from a H2S generator into the liquid. What is  precipitated, and what is unchanged? When fully saturated with  the gas, as indicated by the smell, filter. Which metal is on the  filter and which is in the filtrate? Other reagents, as Na2CO3  solution, would precipitate the latter.    196. Occurrence and Properties. -- H2S is an ill-smell- ing,  poisonous gas, formed in sewers, rotten eggs, and other decaying  albuminous matter. It is formed in the earth, probably from the  action of water on sulphides, and issues with water from sulphur  springs.    A characteristic property is the formation of metallic sulphides,  as above. A skipper one night anchored his newly painted vessel  near the Boston"]]]
