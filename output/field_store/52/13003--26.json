The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s    and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in    January 2000. However, small numbers of armed militants persist in    confronting government forces and conducting ambushes and occasional    attacks on villages. The army placed Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA in the    presidency in 1999 in a fraudulent election but claimed neutrality    in his 2004 landslide reelection victory. Longstanding problems    continue to face BOUTEFLIKA in his second term, including the ethnic    minority Berbers' ongoing autonomy campaign, large-scale    unemployment, a shortage of housing, unreliable electrical and water    supplies, government inefficiencies and corruption, and the    continuing - although significantly degraded - activities of    extremist militants. Algeria must also diversify its petroleum-based    economy, which has yielded a large cash reserve but which has not    been used to redress Algeria's many social and infrastructure    problems.

But  to-night, in this darkness, in the reserve which you maintain, I can  read nothing on your features, and something tells me that I shall have  great difficulty in wresting from you a sincere declaration. I beseech  you, then, not for love of me, for subjects should never weigh as  anything in the balance which princes hold, but for love of yourself,  to retain every syllable, every inflexion which, under the present most  grave circumstances, will all have a sense and value as important as any  every uttered in the world.\"    \"I listen,\" replied the young prince, \"decidedly, without either eagerly  seeking or fearing anything you are about to say to me.\" And he buried  himself still deeper in the thick cushions of the carriage, trying to  deprive his companion not only of the sight of him, but even of the very  idea of his presence.    Black was the darkness which fell wide and dense from the summits of the  intertwining trees. The carriage, covered in by this prodigious roof,  would not have received a particle of light, not even if a ray could  have struggled through the wreaths of mist that were already rising in  the avenue.    \"Monseigneur,\" resumed Aramis, \"you know the history of the government  which to-day controls France. The king issued from an infancy imprisoned  like yours, obscure as yours, and confined as yours; only, instead  of ending, like yourself, this slavery in a prison, this obscurity in  solitude, these straightened circumstances in concealment, he was  fain to bear all these miseries, humiliations, and distresses, in full  daylight, under the pitiless sun of royalty; on an elevation flooded  with light, where every stain appears a blemish, every glory a stain.  The king has suffered; it rankles in his mind; and he will avenge  himself. He will be a bad king. I say not that he will pour out his  people's blood, like Louis XI., or Charles IX.; for he has no mortal  injuries to avenge; but he will devour the means and substance of his  people; for he has himself undergone wrongs in his own interest and  money. In the first place, then, I acquit my conscience, when I consider  openly the merits and the faults of this great prince; and if I condemn  him, my conscience absolves me.\"    Aramis paused. It was not to listen if the silence of the forest  remained undisturbed, but it was to gather up his thoughts from the very  bottom of his soul--to leave the thoughts he had uttered sufficient time  to eat deeply into the mind of his companion.    \"All that Heaven does, Heaven does well,\" continued the bishop of  Vannes; \"and I am so persuaded of it that I have long been thankful  to have been chosen depositary of the secret which I have aided you  to discover. To a just Providence was necessary an instrument, at once  penetrating, persevering, and convinced, to accomplish a great work. I  am this instrument. I possess penetration, perseverance, conviction; I  govern a mysterious people, who has taken for its motto, the motto  of God, '_Patiens quia oeternus_.'\" The prince moved. \"I divine,  monseigneur, why you are raising your head, and are surprised at the  people I have under my command. You did not know you were dealing with a  king--oh! monseigneur, king of a people very humble, much disinherited;  humble because they have no force save when creeping; disinherited,  because never, almost never in this world, do my people reap the harvest  they sow, nor eat the fruit they cultivate. They labor for an abstract  idea; they heap together all the atoms of their power, so from a single  man; and round this man, with the sweat of their labor, they create a  misty halo, which his genius shall, in turn, render a glory gilded with  the rays of all the crowns in Christendom. Such is the man you have  beside you, monseigneur. It is to tell you that he has drawn you from  the abyss for a great purpose, to raise you above the powers of the  earth--above himself.\" [1]    The prince lightly touched Aramis's arm. \"You speak to me,\" he said,  \"of that religious order whose chief you are. For me, the result of your  words is, that the day you desire to hurl down the man you shall have  raised, the event will be accomplished; and that you will keep under  your hand your creation of yesterday.\"    \"Undeceive yourself, monseigneur,\" replied the bishop. \"I should not  take the trouble to play this terrible game with your royal highness, if  I had not a double interest in gaining it. The day you are elevated, you  are elevated forever; you will overturn the footstool, as you rise, and  will send it rolling so far, that not even the sight of it will ever  again recall to you its right to simple gratitude.\"    \"Oh, monsieur!\"    \"Your movement, monseigneur, arises from an excellent disposition.  I thank you. Be well assured, I aspire to more than gratitude! I am  convinced that, when arrived at the summit, you will judge me still more  worthy to be your friend; and then, monseigneur, we two will do such  great deeds, that ages hereafter shall long speak of them.\"    \"Tell me plainly, monsieur--tell me without disguise--what I am to-day,  and what you aim at my being to-morrow.\"    \"You are the son of King Louis XIII., brother of Louis XIV., natural  and legitimate heir to the throne of France. In keeping you near him,  as Monsieur has been kept--Monsieur, your younger brother--the king  reserved to himself the right of being legitimate sovereign. The doctors  only could dispute his legitimacy. But the doctors always prefer the  king who is to the king who is not. Providence has willed that you  should be persecuted; this persecution to-day consecrates you king of  France. You had, then, a right to reign, seeing that it is disputed; you  had a right to be proclaimed seeing that you have been concealed; and  you possess royal blood, since no one has dared to shed yours, as that  of your servants has been shed. Now see, then, what this Providence,  which you have so often accused of having in every way thwarted you, has  done for you. It has given you the features, figure, age, and voice  of your brother; and the very causes of your persecution are about  to become those of your triumphant restoration. To-morrow, after  to-morrow--from the very first, regal phantom, living shade of Louis  XIV., you will sit upon his throne, whence the will of Heaven, confided  in execution to the arm of man, will have hurled him, without hope of  return.\"    \"I understand,\" said the prince, \"my brother's blood will not be shed,  then.\"    \"You will be sole arbiter of his fate.\"    \"The secret of which they made an evil use against me?\"    \"You will employ it against him. What did he do to conceal it? He  concealed you. Living image of himself, you will defeat the conspiracy  of Mazarin and Anne of Austria. You, my prince, will have the same  interest in concealing him, who will, as a prisoner, resemble you, as  you will resemble him as a king.\"    \"I fall back on what I was saying to you. Who will guard him?\"    \"Who guarded _you?_\"    \"You know this secret--you have made use of it with regard to myself.  Who else knows it?\"    \"The queen-mother and Madame de Chevreuse.\"    \"What will they do?\"    \"Nothing, if you choose.\"    \"How is that?\"    \"How can they recognize you, if you act in such a manner that no one can  recognize you?\"    \"'Tis true; but there are grave difficulties.\"    \"State them, prince.\"    \"My brother is married; I cannot take my brother's wife.\"    \"I will cause Spain to consent to a divorce; it is in the interest of  your new policy; it is human morality. All that is really noble and  really useful in this world will find its account therein.\"    \"The imprisoned king will speak.\"    \"To whom do you think he will speak--to the walls?\"    \"You mean, by walls, the men in whom you put confidence.\"    \"If need be, yes. And besides, your royal highness--\"    \"Besides?\"    \"I was going to say, that the designs of Providence do not stop on such  a fair road. Every scheme of this caliber is completed by its results,  like a geometrical calculation. The king, in prison, will not be for you  the cause of embarrassment that you have been for the king enthroned.  His soul is naturally proud and impatient; it is, moreover, disarmed and  enfeebled, by being accustomed to honors, and by the license of supreme  power. The same Providence which has willed that the concluding step in  the geometrical calculation I have had the honor of describing to  your royal highness should be your ascension to the throne, and the  destruction of him who is hurtful to you, has also determined that  the conquered one shall soon end both his own and your sufferings.  Therefore, his soul and body have been adapted for but a brief agony.  Put into prison as a private individual, left alone with your doubts,  deprived of everything, you have exhibited the most sublime, enduring  principle of life in withstanding all this. But your brother, a captive,  forgotten, and in bonds, will not long endure the calamity; and Heaven  will resume his soul at the appointed time--that is to say, soon.\"    At this point in Aramis's gloomy analysis, a bird of night uttered from  the depths of the forest that prolonged and plaintive cry which makes  every creature tremble.    \"I will exile the deposed king,\" said Philippe, shuddering; \"'twill be  more human.\"    \"The king's good pleasure will decide the point,\" said Aramis. \"But has  the problem been well put? Have I brought out of the solution according  to the wishes or the foresight of your royal highness?\"    \"Yes, monsieur, yes; you have forgotten nothing--except, indeed, two  things.\"    \"The first?\"    \"Let us speak of it at once, with the same frankness we have already  conversed in. Let us speak of the causes which may bring about"]]]
