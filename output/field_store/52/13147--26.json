I found no evidence that turtles went into  deeper water to cool themselves.    The length of time spent under cover varied; most turtles had two  daily periods of activity, the second beginning in late afternoon.  Some turtles moved from shelter to shelter in the time between periods  of activity. Several turtles were known to remain quiescent  continuously for several days in the hottest part of the summer.    The maximum temperature that a reptile can tolerate physiologically is  ordinarily higher than the maximum temperature tolerated voluntarily  (Cowles and Bogert, 1944:277); but, the two maxima may be separated by  only a few degrees. Most poikilothormous vertebrates neither tolerate  nor long survive body temperatures exceeding 40 degrees (Cowles and  Bogert, _op. cit._:269).    It is evident (Fig. 22) that ornate box turtles do not often tolerate  body temperatures above 33 degrees and that temperatures in excess of  35 degrees are probably never tolerated under natural conditions. At  9:15 A. M. on July 5, 1955, an adult female emerged from mud where she  had spent the night (body temperature 28.4A deg., mud 28.4A deg., air 30A deg.).  After foraging for 40 minutes in bright sunlight on a grassy hillside  she had moved approximately 100 feet and her temperature had reached  34.6 degrees (air 33.0A deg.). At 9:56 A. M. she moved rapidly and directly  to a den under a rock nearby; 15 minutes later her body temperature  had not changed but after 65 minutes it had dropped to 33.4 degrees.  The temperature of air in the den was 31 degrees. This female began  her activities at nearly optimum body temperature relatively late in  the morning and, by foraging intensively for less than one hour,  probably was able nearly to satisfy her daily food requirements; by  foraging near suitable cover she could remain active until her body  temperature reached a critical threshold, and she thereby saved time  otherwise required for finding cover or making a form.    The following observations, extracted from field notes, indicate that  body temperatures near 40 degrees are the approximate lethal maximum  and are well above those temperatures voluntarily tolerated by _T.  ornata_. On July 4, 1955, a subadult female was in the water at the  edge of a pond. The temperatures of the air, water, and turtle were  32.0, 30.6, and 30.2 degrees, respectively. At 11 A. M. the turtle was  tethered in direct sunlight on the hard-baked clay of the pond  embankment (temperature of air 33.4A deg.). The turtle's response to  steadily rising body temperature over a period of 31 minutes is  illustrated by the following notes.                        Body   Time (A. M.)  temperature         Remarks       11:00          33.0      Tethered on slope.       11:05          34.6      Strains at tether in several directions.       11:09          36.5      Tries frantically to get away; draws in limbs and                              head rapidly and momentarily at any movement on                              my part, and hisses loudly.       11:13          37.5      Mouth held open slightly; turtle overturns in effort                              to escape; frantic scrambling resumed a few seconds                              after I right turtle.       11:17          38.2      Mouth now held open most of the time; white                              froth begins to appear around mouth.       11:20          38.6      Stops activities every 10 seconds or so, rests chin                              on ground and gapes widely; will still pull into                              shell when prodded with stick.       11:23          39.2      Still wildly active; continues to gape widely every                              few seconds.       11:27          39.4      Frothing at mouth profusely.       11:30          39.6      Attempts to escape are now in short feeble bursts.       11:31                    Turtle released; crawls toward me and immediately                              seeks shade of my body; when I move off, turtle                              seeks shade of small isolated weed on pond embankment;                              turtle removed to damp earth at edge                              of pond.       11:35          39.5      Attempts to burrow into mud at edge of pond.       11:36                    Enters shallow water and moves slowly back to                              shore.       11:37          38.8      Turtle thrown into center of pond where it remains                              motionless and drifts with wind to opposite                              shore; remains inactive in mud and shallow water                              at edge of pond; temperature of water near turtle                              35.5.       11:57          35.0      Moves 50 ft. up slope to shade of low vegetation.       01:55 P. M.    32.5      Turtle has not moved.      The overheating may have incapacitated the turtle since it moved only  50 feet in the next two days; its body temperatures on the two days  subsequent to the experiment were 26.8 and 20.6, respectively.    The mentioned gaping, as in higher vertebrates generally, cools the  animal by evaporation from the moist surfaces of the mouth and  pharynx. By keeping the mouth open for more than a few minutes at a  time in hot dry weather, a turtle would surely lose body water in  amounts that could not always be easily replaced. Ornate box turtles  seem to utilize evaporation for cooling only in emergencies and rely  for the most part on radiation and conduction to lower body  temperature after reaching a relatively cool, dark retreat.    Box turtles were never active at body temperatures below 15 degrees  and were seldom active at temperatures below 24 degrees. The two  lowest temperatures (15.3A deg. and 16.3A deg.) were taken from individuals  crossing roads on overcast days in early May.    In 78 box turtles that were under cover because their environmental  temperatures were low, the body temperatures ranged from 2.7 to 30.6  degrees (mean 19.8 A+- 6.38[sigma]). The range of body temperatures in  this group is greater than in the other groups shown in Figure 22  because low body temperatures were studied over a wide range of  conditions, including hibernation.    Box turtles actually seek cover because of low temperatures only in  fall and spring and on occasional unseasonable days in summer when  temperatures drop rapidly. Retreat to cover, in the normal cycle of  daily activity, is governed usually by high temperatures at mid-day or  by darkness at the end of the day. Turtles in dens, burrows, and grass  forms, tended to burrow if temperatures remained low for more than a  few hours.    Box turtles under cover where they cannot bask have little control  over the lower range of body temperatures. The freezing temperatures  of winter can be escaped by burrowing deeper into the ground.  Temperatures approaching the lethal minimum, however, seldom occur  during the season of normal activity. By remaining hidden in a burrow  or den therefore, box turtles are fairly well protected from predators  but are at a thermal disadvantage.    A number of turtles that had wet mud on their shells were found  basking in early morning near ditches, ponds, and marshy areas;  several others were partly buried in mud, shortly after daybreak, and  another was at the edge of a pond after dark.    Eight adults, located just as they emerged from cover in early morning  on sunny days, had body temperatures of 19.7, 21.9, 24.2, 24.5, 25.8,  26.6, 28.7, and 29.5 degrees. In five emerging from earth forms, body  temperatures were at least a degree or two below the temperature of  the air; the other three came from mud or shallow water and had body  temperatures higher than the air temperature.    Temperature is probably the primary stimulus governing emergence after  temporary periods of quiescence. Turtles in earthen forms are usually  completely covered or are head downward with only the hind quarters  exposed. Obviously, the more thoroughly a turtle protects itself  (beneath the insulating cover of a form, burrow, or den) against  unfavorable temperatures, the longer it will take for favorable  temperatures to bring about normal activity again. Turtles in forms  and deep burrows have a minimum of contact with the outer environment;  but in dens beneath rocks and in shallow burrows light and air can  enter freely. Turtles might be influenced in their activities to some  extent by the intensity of light at the opening of a burrow or den;  they are surely stimulated by changes in the temperature and humidity  of air coming through the opening. Shallow retreats that a turtle can  enter and leave with the least effort therefore seem most efficient  for purposes of thermocontrol, especially when they provide earthen  surfaces into which the turtles can burrow more deeply if more severe  environmental conditions develop.    In October, 1955, nine _T. ornata_ of various sizes, collected in  Douglas County, Kansas, were brought to the laboratory for observation  under conditions of controlled temperature. They were kept at room  temperature for several days and were fed regularly, with the  exception of one hatchling that was fed nothing in this period. On  October 22 the turtles were placed in a room where the temperature was  maintained constantly at zero degrees. One of the nine turtles, an  adult female, was killed with chloroform immediately prior to its  removal to the cold room. A list of the turtles used in this  experiment is given below.

Snow depth and supporting ability were also measured during these  winters, and the ability of wolves to capture deer was compared for a  period of usual snow conditions versus a period of extreme snow  conditions.    It was found that during February and March 1969, when snow remained  from 2.5 to 3.9 feet deep and failed to support running deer, wolves  were able to capture deer more easily. This was evidenced by kills that  were left partly or completely uneaten, and by a higher rate of  predation by radiotagged wolves and their associates.    Although both wolves and deer floundered in the extremely deep snow,  the relatively lighter weight-load-on-track of wolves evidently gave  them a greater advantage than under the usual snow conditions, when  wolves were observed floundering more than deer. This factor, plus a  decline in the health and vigor of some segments of the deer population  and a tendency for deer to congregate on frozen lakes, where wolves  have an advantage, help explain the increased vulnerability of deer to  wolf predation during the winters of deep snow.

Frenzel, Jr.      The timber wolf (_Canis lupus_) of northeastern Minnesota occupies an  area within the range given by Goldman (1944) for the eastern timber  wolf (_C. l. lycaon_ Schreber). However, this area is within 150 miles  of the eastern edge of the former range of the Great Plains wolf (_C.  l. nubilus_ Say), and there is some question as to whether the  Minnesota wolf is really an intergrade between these two subspecies.  Writing of _nubilus_, Goldman (1944, p. 444) stated: \"Specimens from  eastern Minnesota and Michigan seem more properly referable to  _lycaon_, but relationship to _nubilus_ is shown in somewhat  intermediate characters.\"    In describing _lycaon_ as basically a gray wolf, Goldman made no  mention of the occurrence of black or white color phases in that  subspecies. However, in discussing _nubilus_, Goldman (1944, p. 442)  wrote the following: \"Many color variations are presented. Individuals  may be nearly white at any season, except for a sprinkling of black  hairs over the back, a small, narrow, but conspicuous, black patch over  the tail gland, and a more or less distinctly black tip. Black  individuals may occur in the same litter with those normally colored.\"  Goldman also referred to _nubilus_ as \"now probably extinct.\"    [Illustration: _Figure 1.--A few wolves observed in the study area were  jet black. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Mech.)_]    In the eastern part of the range of _lycaon_, color phases other than  gray appear to be rare as Rutter and Pimlott (1969, p. 188) attest:  \"The uniformity of the color of timber wolves in many areas is  evidenced by the work in Algonquin Park, in Ontario. There, over the  past eight years, dozens of packs have been observed from the air.  However, we have never been able to discriminate between any of them on  the basis of the color variation of individual animals.\"    Thus it seems significant to report on incidences of black and white  color phases in wolves that we have observed in northeastern Minnesota  during some 480 hours of flying associated with wolf research (Mech _et  al._, p. 1). The observations took place in the Superior National  Forest, in northern Cook, Lake, and St. Louis Counties during the  winters of 1966-67, 1967-68, and 1968-69. A total of 309 sightings were  made of wolves that could be classified by color; of these, 11 (3.6  percent) were jet black (fig. 1) and two (0.6 percent) were creamish  white, with the cream color the most intense on the back. No doubt some  of the grays, and perhaps the blacks and whites, were repeated  observations, but the figures should provide a reasonable approximation  of the incidence of these color phases in this area. All black or white  animals except one were observed with gray wolves (table 1 and fig. 2).    A number of black wolves, and a few white wolves, have been seen by  other observers, all in the three counties listed earlier. To gain some  idea of the past incidence of these color phases in the same general  area, we asked Conservation Officers Robert Hodge, Robert Jacobsen, and  Frank Baltich of the Ely, Minnesota, area about the numbers of each  phase that they took before 1960. They reported killing an approximate  total of 580 wolves, of which four were black and three were white or  creamish white.      _Table 1.--Observations of wolves of black and white color phases_    +--------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+  |    Date      |      Location           | Color combinations       |  |              |                         | within each pack         |  +--------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+  |Feb. 24, 1967  T64N-R8W-S1 Vera Lake      3 grays; 1 black; 1 white|  |Mar. 4, 1967   T63N-R9W-S27 Lake Two      3 grays; 2 blacks        |  |Dec. 18, 1968  T63N-R8W-S35 Lake Insula   2 grays; 2 blacks[37]    |  |Jan. 17, 1969  T65N-R8W-S27 Carp Lake     1 gray; 1 white          |  |Feb. 1, 1969   T63N-R8W-S13 Lake Insula   4 blacks; 2 grays[38]    |  |Feb. 5, 1969   T63N-R8W-S8 Benezie Lake   1 black                  |  |Feb. 6, 1969   T63N-R10W-S33 Clear Lake   3 grays; 1 black         |  +--------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+  FOOTNOTES:    [37] These animals were near the shore of the lake, so others may have  been inland where they could not be seen.    [38] This group might well have been the same as that seen on Dec. 18,  1968.    [Illustration: _Figure 2.--A pack of four blacks with two grays (first  and third). (Photo courtesy of John Winship.)_]    Because black and white color phases have rarely if ever been reported  for _lycaon_, yet were well known for _nubilus_, it is not unreasonable  to conclude that the race of wolves now occupying northeastern  Minnesota does show strong _nubilus_ influence. Goldman examined the  skulls only of 10 Minnesota specimens assignable to _lycaon_ and only  one referable to _nubilus_. Because wolves in the known range of  _nubilus_ are thought to be extinct, and because the animals in  northeastern Minnesota are legally unprotected and subject to a control  program, it seems highly desirable that the question of their taxonomy  be studied intensively while specimens are still available.
