He stretched himself on her threshold, and uttered  his complaints to the cruel bolts and bars.  She was deafer than  the surges which rise in the November gale; harder than steel  from the German forges, or a rock that still clings to its native  cliff.  She mocked and laughed at him, adding cruel words to her  ungentle treatment, and gave not the slightest gleam of hope.    \"Iphis could not any longer endure the torments of hopeless love,  and standing before her doors, he spake these last words:  'Anaxarete, you have conquered, and shall no longer have to bear  my importunities.  Enjoy your triumph!  Sing songs of joy, and  bind your forehead with laurel,   you have conquered!  I die;  stony heart, rejoice!  This at least I can do to gratify you, and  force you to praise me; and thus shall I prove that the love of  you left me but with life.  Nor will I leave it to rumor to tell  you of my death.  I will come myself, and you shall see me die,  and feast your eyes on the spectacle.  Yet, Oh, ye gods, who look  down on mortal woes, observe my fate!  I ask but this!  Let me be  remembered in coming ages, and add those years to my name which  you have reft from my life.'  Thus he said, and, turning his pale  face and weeping eyes towards her mansion, he fastened a rope to  the gate-post, on which he had hung garlands, and putting his  head into the noose, he murmured, 'This garland at least will  please you, cruel girl!'  And falling, hung suspended with his  neck broken.  As he fell he struck against the gate, and the  sound was as the sound of a groan.  The servants opened the door  and found him dead, and with exclamations of pity raised him and  carried him home to his mother, for his father was not living.  She received the dead body of her son, and folded the cold form  to her bosom; while she poured forth the sad words which bereaved  mothers utter.  The mournful funeral passed through the town, and  the pale corpse was borne on a bier to the place of the funeral  pile.  By chance the home of Anaxarete was on the street where  the procession passed, and the lamentations of the mourners met  the ears of her whom the avenging deity had already marked for  punishment.    \"'Let us see this sad procession,' said she, and mounted to a  turret, whence through an open window she looked upon the  funeral.  Scarce had her eyes rested upon the form of Iphis  stretched on the bier, when they began to stiffen, and the warm  blood in her body to become cold.  Endeavoring to step back, she  found she could not move her feet; trying to turn away her face,  she tried in vain; and by degrees all her limbs became stony like  her heart.  That you may not doubt the fact, the statue still  remains, and stands in the temple of Venus at Salamis, in the  exact form of the lady.  Now think of these things, my dear, and  lay aside your scorn and your delays, and accept a lover.  So may  neither the vernal frosts blight your young fruits, nor furious  winds scatter your blossoms!\"    When Vertumnus had spoken thus, he dropped the disguise of an old  woman, and stood before her in his proper person, as a comely  youth.  It appeared to her like the sun bursting through a cloud.  He would have renewed his entreaties, but there was no need; his  arguments and the sight of his true form prevailed, and the Nymph  no longer resisted, but owned a mutual flame.    Pomona was the especial patroness of the apple-orchard, and as  such she was invoked by Phillips, the author of a poem on Cider,  in blank verse, in the following lines:      \"What soil the apple loves, what care is due    To orchats, timeliest when to press the fruits,    Thy gift, Pomona, in Miltonian verse    Adventurous I presume to sing.\"    Thomson, in the Seasons, alludes to Phillips:      \"Phillips, Pomona's bard, the second thou    Who nobly durst, in rhyme-unfettered verse,    With British freedom, sing the British song.\"    It will be seen that Thomson refers to the poet's reference to  Milton, but it is not true that Phillips is only the second  writer of English blank verse.  Many other poets beside Milton  had used it long before Phillips' time.    But Pomona was also regarded as presiding over other fruits, and,  as such, is invoked by Thomson:      \"Bear me, Pomona, to thy citron groves,    To where the lemon and the piercing lime,    With the deep orange, glowing through the green,    Their lighter glories blend.  Lay me reclined    Beneath the spreading tamarind, that shakes,    Fanned by the breeze, its fever-cooling fruit.\"      CUPID AND PSYCHE    A certain king had three daughters.  (This seems to be one of the  latest fables of the Greek mythology.  It has not been found  earlier than the close of the second century of the Christian  era.  It bears marks of the higher religious notions of that  time.)  The two elder were charming girls, but the beauty of the  youngest was so wonderful that language is too poor to express  its due praise.  The fame of her beauty was so great that  strangers from neighboring countries came in crowds to enjoy the  sight, and looked on her with amazement, paying her that homage  which is due only to Venus herself.  In fact, Venus found her  altars deserted, while men turned their devotion to this young  virgin.  As she passed along, the people sang her praises, and  strewed her way with chaplets and flowers.    This perversion to a mortal of the homage due only to the  immortal powers gave great offence to the real Venus.  Shaking  her ambrosial locks with indignation, she exclaimed, \"Am I then  to be eclipsed in my honors by a mortal girl?  In vain then did  that royal shepherd, whose judgment was approved by Jove himself,  give me the palm of beauty over my illustrious rivals, Pallas and  June.  But she shall not so quietly usurp my honors.  I will give  her cause to repent of so unlawful a beauty.\"    Thereupon she calls her winged son Cupid, mischievous enough in  his own nature, and rouses and provokes him yet more by her  complaints.  She points out Psyche to him, and says, \"My dear  son, punish that contumacious beauty; give thy mother a revenge  as sweet as her injuries are great; infuse into the bosom of that  haughty girl a passion for some low, mean, unworthy being, so  that she may reap a mortification as great as her present  exultation and triumph.\"    Cupid prepared to obey the commands of his mother.  There are two  fountains in Venus's garden, one of sweet waters, the other of  bitter.  Cupid filled two amber vases, one from each fountain,  and suspending them from the top of his quiver, hastened to the  chamber of Psyche, whom he found asleep.  He shed a few drops  from the bitter fountain over her lips, though the sight of her  almost moved him to pity; then touched her side with the point of  his arrow.  At the touch she awoke, and opened eyes upon Cupid  (himself invisible) which so startled him that in his confusion  he wounded himself with his own arrow.  Heedless of his wound his  whole thought now was to repair the mischief he had done, and he  poured the balmy drops of joy over all her silken ringlets.    Psyche, henceforth frowned upon by Venus, derived no benefit from  all her charms.  True, all eyes were cast eagerly upon her, and  every mouth spoke her praises; but neither king, royal youth, nor  plebeian presented himself to demand her in marriage.  Her two  elder sisters of moderate charms had now long been married to two  royal princes; but Psyche, in her lonely apartment, deplored her  solitude, sick of that beauty, which, while it procured abundance  of flattery, had failed to awaken love.    Her parents, afraid that they had unwittingly incurred the anger  of the gods, consulted the oracle of Apollo, and received this  answer: \"The virgin is destined for the bride of no mortal lover.  Her future husband awaits her on the top of the mountain.  He is  a monster whom neither gods nor men can resist.\"    This dreadful decree of the oracle filled all the people with  dismay, and her parents abandoned themselves to grief.  But  Psyche said, \"Why, my dear parents, do you now lament me?  You  should rather have grieved when the people showered upon me  undeserved honors, and with one voice called me a Venus.  I now  perceive that I am a victim to that name.  I submit.  Lead me to  that rock to which my unhappy fate has destined me.\" Accordingly,  all things being prepared, the royal maid took her place in the  procession, which more resembled a funeral than a nuptial pomp,  and with her parents, amid the lamentations of the people,  ascended the mountain, on the summit of which they left her  alone, and with sorrowful hearts returned home.    While Psyche stood on the ridge of the mountain, panting with  fear and with eyes full of tears, the gentle Zephyr raised her  from the earth and bore her with an easy motion into a flowery  dale.  By degrees her mind became composed, and she laid herself  down on the grassy bank to sleep.  When she awoke, refreshed with  sleep, she looked round and beheld nearby a pleasant grove of  tall and stately trees.  She entered it, and in the midst  discovered a fountain, sending forth clear and crystal waters,  and hard by, a magnificent palace whose August front impressed  the spectator that it was not the work of mortal hands, but the  happy retreat of some god.  Drawn by admiration and wonder, she  approached the building and ventured to enter.  Every object she  met filled her with pleasure and amazement.  Golden pillars  supported the vaulted roof, and the walls were enriched with  carvings and paintings representing beasts of the chase and rural  scenes, adapted to delight the eye of the beholder.  Proceeding  onward she perceived that besides the apartments of state there  were others, filled with all manner of treasures, and beautiful  and precious"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33407"],[0,"Bee and Butterfly: A Tale of Two Cousins (#19)"],[1,"?\"    \"He is the son of our new neighbor, Mrs. Medulla,\" Bee informed him. \"He  lives with his mother in the old Brawley place. He is an infant  prodigy.\"    \"I don't care much for such precocity,\" observed the doctor dryly. \"It  is usually exploited by long-legged chaps who seek to prolong the  illusion of the infantile period by knickerbockers and curls. I am not  speaking of your friend, Beatrice, but of the brood in general.\"    \"But Percival _has_ curls, and he _does_ wear knickerbockers,\" spoke Bee  in dismay. \"Though he told me, father, that he despised his clothes, and  that a real fellow did not like to wear such things. He really is a  marvel, and I am sure that Mrs. Medulla would like for us to call on  them. She has been very nice to me.\"    \"Very well, my daughter. I suppose that we ought to be neighborly, but I  shall not have much time for visiting. Let us listen to your cousin now.  She is waiting for us.\"    Adele had at length settled herself to her satisfaction. She liked to  play. She was the center of all eyes at the piano, and she was  conscious that she looked her very best as, with eyes upturned, she sang  some old ballad in her sweet and plaintive little voice.    Doctor Raymond lighted a cigar. Bee brought his tobacco set and placed  it upon a small table by his chair. Then she sat down to listen. How  beautiful Adele was! Despite her good resolutions a pang went through  her heart as she noted her father's intense gaze of admiration. Adele  sang on and on. The room grew dark. Beatrice rose, attended to the  lights, trying to stifle the feeling of sadness that was stealing over  her.    \"Isn't she pretty?\" she asked of her father suddenly, bending over and  speaking wistfully.    \"She is like an exquisite cameo,\" was the entomologist's enthusiastic  response. \"I am glad that you admire her, Beatrice, though I do not see  how one could help it. Won't she tire herself?\"    \"I will see, father.\" Bee went to her cousin and touched her gently on  the shoulder.    \"Aren't you tired, Adele?\"    \"I believe that I am,\" replied Adele, jumping up from the stool. \"I saw  that Uncle William was interested and so I kept on.\"    This was scarcely true. She had played on because she saw that her uncle  enjoyed looking at her. In common with most beauties she was conscious  when she excited admiration.    \"You sing very nicely, my dear,\" was the scientist's comment. For some  reason he appeared more at home with his niece than he did with his  daughter.    \"Thank you, uncle,\" said Adele sweetly. \"What are we to do tomorrow,  Bee? Let's go shopping. I want to get a new blue dress. Mamma said that  I could have one.\"    \"I cannot go in the morning,\" replied Bee, whose mind was made up on  this point. With her mornings with her father she had resolved there  should be no interference. \"I help father with his cataloguing then. I  will go in the afternoon, if you wish.\"    \"Then what will become of me?\" pouted Adele.    \"You shall help us,\" said Doctor Raymond, pleasantly. \"Tomorrow we take  up the life history of 'The Purple Emperor.' It is one of the most  charming of butterflies, and I am sure that you will enjoy it. Beauty  should be drawn by beautiful things,\" he added graciously.    \"Why, of course I'll help,\" cried Adele, delighted by the compliment.    \"There is one call, or errand of mercy rather, that I would like you  girls to make for me,\" remarked the scientist presently. \"This morning  the minister told me that old Rachel was ailing. It would be a graceful  thing for you two to take her some delicacies of some sort. The old  appreciate such attentions. She was a faithful servant of your mother's,  Beatrice. Indeed, she attended her through her last illness.\"    \"I know, father. Uncle Henry said that you wished her looked after, and  that she should not want for anything. He had me to go down to the cabin  every month to see what she needed. I have not been since your return  though. I thought perhaps you would prefer to attend to her yourself.\"    \"I have been once, my daughter, but I can not go tomorrow. If you  girls--\"    \"Certainly we'll go,\" cried Adele before Bee could reply. \"Let's wear  our gray dresses, Bee, and pretend that we are Sisters of Charity.\"    \"You may wear a gray dress if you wish,\" remarked Bee. \"I shall dress as  I always do. Father, don't you think that we ought to attend to that  before we go shopping?\"    \"Yes. Deeds of kindness should take precedence over all else. Now,  girls, I am going into the study to read for a time. I know that you two  must have a great deal to say to each other. Beatrice has had to be  content with just me a long time.    \"Good-night, Uncle William!\" Adele ran to him and put up her lips for a  kiss. \"You are just horrid to run off to those old bugs and things. If  you run away too often, I'll throw them into the river.\"    Bee looked up horrified at her cousin's pertness.    \"Good-night, you butterfly,\" responded Doctor Raymond, kissing his  niece, and seeming not at all dismayed by her threat. \"Don't let me  catch you tampering with my bugs, as you call them. Good-night,  daughter!\"    \"Good-night, father,\" replied the girl without glancing at him. He had  laughed just as if he had enjoyed Adele's nonsense. He had not kissed  her since the first night of his homecoming, and her heart throbbed at  the thought of how easily Adele could get what she would have given  anything for.    Her father hesitated a moment, then, catching sight of her expression,  he crossed the room to her side, and putting his hand under her chin,  raised her face gently and looked into her eyes.    \"Aren't you going to kiss me too?\" he asked.    Bee's eyes filled, and she was unable to speak, as was always the case  when she was deeply moved. He waited, wondering at her silence, when all  at once he spoke with a quick intake of his breath:    \"There is a look of your mother about you tonight, Beatrice. I never  noticed it before. Child, child,--\"    He withdrew his hand from her chin, turned, and quitted the room  abruptly.    \"What made him do that?\" cried Adele. \"Doesn't he like you yet, Bee?\"    But Bee's eyes were shining through her tears.    \"He said that I looked like my mother,\" she breathed. \"Oh, Adele! Did  you hear him?\"    \"Well, what of it? I don't see anything so wonderful in that. Everyone  says that I am the perfect image of mamma. It would be natural for you  to look like your mother.\"    \"But he loved her dearly, dearly,\" said Bee. \"If he thinks that I am  like her he will love me too. He just _must_ like me,\" she broke forth.  \"Why, Adele, I think I should die if he didn't.\"    \"Oh, no; you wouldn't, Bee. I don't think you know how to manage him.  Now I can make him do anything I wish. I could show you a few little  tricks--\"    \"Thank you,\" answered Bee with dignity. \"I don't want any more of your  tricks, Adele. One of them has caused quite enough mischief.\"    \"But you have forgiven me that, Bee; haven't you? I saw that you had  just as soon as you kissed me.\"    \"Adele,\" spoke Bee earnestly, \"I am trying to do it. It brought father  back to me sooner than he would have come. For that reason I am going to  be toward you as I used to be, but I don't want to talk about it too  much. And I don't want any more of your tricks. That is, if you care to  have me like you.\"    \"Beatrice Raymond, what has come to you?\" asked Adele, her eyes opening  wide at her cousin's seriousness. \"I never saw such a difference in any  one as there is in you since your father's return. Of course you are  going to be toward me just as you used to be. You always were fond of  me, and you are going to love me just as much as ever. What in the world  are you doing?\"    Beatrice made no reply. They were in her room by this time, and Adele  was taking down her hair to brush it. Bee was leaning far out of a  window, looking toward the garden where the dim outline of the moss rose  bush, the rose her mother had planted, could be seen. There were no  roses now, but the bush stood shapely and symmetrical in the moonlight.    \"He said that I looked like her,\" she mused thoughtfully, her heart  going out with yearning toward that mother who was scarcely more than a  memory to her. \"And he loved her dearly, dearly!\"          Chapter XVI    \"It Is So Hard To Do the Right Thing\"        \"Some of these days the skies will be brighter,      Some of these days the burdens be lighter;      Hearts will be happier, souls will be whiter,              Some of these days,              Some of these days.\"        --_Frank L. Stanton._      \"There, Beatrice, that will do for today.\" Doctor Raymond laid aside his  manuscript with a sigh of satisfaction. \"The Purple Emperor is a fitting  close for our day's work. I think there is no place in Natural History  where rank is of so much importance as among butterflies. His Majesty is  easily king of the lot.\"    He picked up the Denton frame in which the insect was mounted, and  looked at it smilingly.    \"I never see the Emperor,\" he continued reflectively, \"that I do not  think of Peter Pindar's Ode to The Emperor of Morocco and Sir Joseph  Banks. Of course it is a hit at scientists, but it is amusing for all  that. Have either of you read it?\"    \"Yes;\" spoke Bee eagerly. \"At least, I have heard it read, father.  Professor Lawrence read it to the class one day.\"    Doctor Raymond frowned. Bee had not yet learned that there are occasions  when ignorance is bliss. No one likes to have either his anecdotes or  witticisms anticipated. She might have said with perfect sincerity:    \"Yes, father; but I should like to hear it again.\"    \"Well, I haven't heard it at all,\" said Adele prettily. \"I am not so  learned as Bee.\"    \"You will doubtless appreciate it then,\" spoke the naturalist, turning  to her with pleasure apparent in both voice and manner. \"Would you care  to hear the lines?\"    \"Nothing would delight me so much, Uncle William.\"    How"]]]
