At the last session Lucretia Mott offered and spoke to the following  resolution:         _Resolved_, That the speedy success of our cause depends upon the       zealous and untiring efforts of both men and women, for the       overthrow of the monopoly of the pulpit, and for the securing to       woman an equal participation with men in the various trades,       professions, and commerce.    The only resolution that was not unanimously adopted was the ninth,  urging the women of the country to secure to themselves the elective  franchise. Those who took part in the debate feared a demand for the  right to vote would defeat others they deemed more rational, and make  the whole movement ridiculous.    But Mrs. Stanton and Frederick Douglass seeing that the power to  choose rulers and make laws, was the right by which all others could  be secured, persistently advocated the resolution, and at last carried  it by a small majority.    Thus it will be seen that the Declaration and resolutions in the very  first Convention, demanded all the most radical friends of the  movement have since claimed--such as equal rights in the universities,  in the trades and professions; the right to vote; to share in all  political offices, honors, and emoluments; to complete equality in  marriage, to personal freedom, property, wages, children; to make  contracts; to sue, and be sued; and to testify in courts of justice.  At this time the condition of married women under the Common Law, was  nearly as degraded as that of the slave on the Southern plantation.  The Convention continued through two entire days, and late into the  evenings. The deepest interest was manifested to its close.    The proceedings were extensively published, unsparingly ridiculed by  the press, and denounced by the pulpit, much to the surprise and  chagrin of the leaders. Being deeply in earnest, and believing their  demands pre-eminently wise and just, they were wholly unprepared to  find themselves the target for the jibes and jeers of the nation. The  Declaration was signed by one hundred men, and women, many of whom  withdrew their names as soon as the storm of ridicule began to break.  The comments of the press were carefully preserved,[9] and it is  curious to see that the same old arguments, and objections rife at the  start, are reproduced by the press of to-day. But the brave protests  sent out from this Convention touched a responsive chord in the hearts  of women all over the country.    Conventions were held soon after in Ohio, Massachusetts, Indiana,  Pennsylvania, and at different points in New York.    Mr. Douglass, in his paper, _The North Star_, of July 28, 1848, had  the following editorial leader:         THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN.--One of the most interesting events of the       past week, was the holding of what is technically styled a       Woman's Rights Convention at Seneca Falls. The speaking,       addresses, and resolutions of this extraordinary meeting were       almost wholly conducted by women; and although they evidently       felt themselves in a novel position, it is but simple justice to       say that their whole proceedings were characterized by marked       ability and dignity. No one present, we think, however much he       might be disposed to differ from the views advanced by the       leading speakers on that occasion, will fail to give them credit       for brilliant talents and excellent dispositions. In this       meeting, as in other deliberative assemblies, there were frequent       differences of opinion and animated discussion; but in no case       was there the slightest absence of good feeling and decorum.       Several interesting documents setting forth the rights as well as       grievances of women were read. Among these was a Declaration of       Sentiments, to be regarded as the basis of a grand movement for       attaining the civil, social, political, and religious rights of       women. We should not do justice to our own convictions, or to the       excellent persons connected with this infant movement, if we did       not in this connection offer a few remarks on the general subject       which the Convention met to consider and the objects they seek to       attain. In doing so, we are not insensible that the bare mention       of this truly important subject in any other than terms of       contemptuous ridicule and scornful disfavor, is likely to excite       against us the fury of bigotry and the folly of prejudice. A       discussion of the rights of animals would be regarded with far       more complacency by many of what are called the _wise_ and the       _good_ of our land, than would be a discussion of the rights of       women. It is, in their estimation, to be guilty of evil thoughts,       to think that woman is entitled to equal rights with man. Many       who have at last made the discovery that the negroes have some       rights as well as other members of the human family, have yet to       be convinced that women are entitled to any. Eight years ago a       number of persons of this description actually abandoned the       anti-slavery cause, lest by giving their influence in that       direction they might possibly be giving countenance to the       dangerous heresy that woman, in respect to rights, stands on an       equal footing with man. In the judgment of such persons the       American slave system, with all its concomitant horrors, is less       to be deplored than this _wicked_ idea. It is perhaps needless to       say, that we cherish little sympathy for such sentiments or       respect for such prejudices. Standing as we do upon the       watch-tower of human freedom, we can not be deterred from an       expression of our approbation of any movement, however humble,       to improve and elevate the character of any members of the human       family. While it is impossible for us to go into this subject at       length, and dispose of the various objections which are often       urged against such a doctrine as that of female equality, we are       free to say that in respect to political rights, we hold woman to       be justly entitled to all we claim for man. We go farther, and       express our conviction that all political rights which it is       expedient for man to exercise, it is equally so for woman. All       that distinguishes man as an intelligent and accountable being,       is equally true of woman; and if that government only is just       which governs by the free consent of the governed, there can be       no reason in the world for denying to woman the exercise of the       elective franchise, or a hand in making and administering the       laws of the land. Our doctrine is that \"right is of no sex.\" We       therefore bid the women engaged in this movement our humble       Godspeed.      THE ROCHESTER CONVENTION, AUGUST 2, 1848.    Those who took part in the Convention at Seneca Falls, finding at the  end of the two days, there were still so many new points for  discussion, and that the gift of tongues had been vouchsafed to them,  adjourned, to meet in Rochester in two weeks. Amy Post, Sarah D. Fish,  Sarah C. Owen, and Mary H. Hallowell, were the Committee of  Arrangements. This Convention was called for August 2d, and so well  advertised in the daily papers, that at the appointed hour, the  Unitarian Church was filled to overflowing.    Amy Post called the meeting to order, and stated that at a gathering  the previous evening in Protection Hall, Rhoda De Garmo, Sarah Fish,  and herself, were appointed a committee to nominate officers for the  Convention, and they now proposed Abigail Bush, for President; Laura  Murray, for Vice-President; Elizabeth McClintock, Sarah Hallowell, and  Catherine A. F. Stebbins, for Secretaries. Mrs. Mott, Mrs. Stanton,  and Mrs. McClintock, thought it a most hazardous experiment to have a  woman President, and stoutly opposed it.    To write a Declaration and Resolutions, to make a speech, and debate,  had taxed their powers to the uttermost; and now, with such feeble  voices and timid manners, without the slightest knowledge of Cushing's  Manual, or the least experience in public meetings, how could a woman  preside? They were on the verge of leaving the Convention in disgust,  but Amy Post and Rhoda De Garmo assured them that by the same power by  which they had resolved, declared, discussed, debated, they could also  preside at a public meeting, if they would but make the experiment.  And as the vote of the majority settled the question on the side of  woman, Abigail Bush took the chair, and the calm way she assumed the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28026"],[0,"Great Pianists on Piano Playing (#19)"],[1,"y, Philadelphia. He then  became director of the Piano Department of the Chicago Conservatory and  held this position for five years. In 1900 Godowsky appeared in Berlin  and was immediately recognized as one of the great piano masters of his  time. In 1909 he became director of the Master School of Piano Playing  connected with the Imperial Conservatory of Vienna (a post previously  held by Emil Sauer and F. B. Busoni). His success as a teacher has been  exceptional. His compositions, particularly his fifty studies upon  Chopin Etudes, have won the admiration of the entire musical world.    [Illustration: LEOPOLD GODOWSKY]          X    THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF TECHNIC    LEOPOLD GODOWSKY      IDEAS UPON TECHNIC OFTEN ERRONEOUS    \"It is quite impossible in a short talk to earnest music students to do  more than discuss a few of the more important points in the subject  proposed. It may safely be said at the start, however, that the popular  conception of technic is quite an erroneous one and one that deserves  correction. It is highly necessary that the student should have a  correct attitude of mind regarding this matter. First of all, I  distinguish between what might be called mere mechanics and technic.    \"The art of piano playing as a whole seems to divide itself into three  quite distinct channels when it is considered from the educational  standpoint. The first channel is that of mechanics. This would naturally  include all that pertains to that branch of piano study which has to do  with the exercises that develop the hand from the machine  standpoint--that is, make it capable of playing with the greatest  possible rapidity, the greatest possible power, when power is needed and  also provide it with the ability to play those passages which, because  of fingering or unusual arrangement of the piano keys, are particularly  difficult to perform.      THE BRAIN SIDE OF PIANO STUDY    \"In the second channel we would find the study of the technic of the art  of playing the instrument. Technic differs from the mechanics of piano  playing in that it has properly to do with the intellectual phase of the  subject rather than the physical. It is the brain side of the study not  the digital or the manual. To the average student who is short-sighted  enough to spend hours hammering away at the keyboard developing the  mechanical side of his work, a real conscious knowledge of the great  saving he could effect through technic, would be a godsend. Technic  properly has to do with Rhythm, Tempo, Accent, Phrasing, Dynamics,  Agogics, Touch, etc.    \"The excellence of one's technic depends upon the accuracy of one's  understanding of these subjects and his skill in applying them to his  interpretations at the keyboard. Mechanical skill, minus real technical  grasp, places the player upon a lower footing than the piano-playing  machines which really do play all the notes, with all the speed and all  the power the operator demands. Some of these instruments, indeed, are  so constructed that many of the important considerations that we have  placed in the realm of technic are reproduced in a surprising manner.      THE EMOTIONS IN PIANO PLAYING    \"However, not until man invents a living soul, can piano playing by  machine include the third and vastly important channel through which we  communicate the works of the masters to those who would hear them. That  channel is the emotional or artistic phase of piano playing. It is the  channel which the student must expect to develop largely through his own  inborn artistic sense and his cultivated powers of observation of the  playing of master pianists. It is the sacred fire communicated from one  art generation to the next and modified by the individual emotions of  the performer himself.    \"Even though the performer may possess the most highly perfected  mechanism, technical mastery which enables him to play great  masterpieces effectively, if he does not possess the emotional insight,  his performances will lack a peculiar subtlety and artistic power that  will deprive him of becoming a truly great pianist.      INSPIRING THE STUDENT    \"Exercises for the mechanical side of pianoforte playing abound. Czerny  alone wrote over one thousand opus numbers. There have also been  valuable attempts to provide books to assist the student in his  technical work, but it should always be remembered that this depends  first of all upon understanding and then upon the ability to translate  that understanding to the instrument.    \"There can never be any exercises in the emotional side of the student's  work other than the entire literature of the instrument. One may as well  try to capture the perfume of the flower as define the requirements of  the emotional in pianoforte playing. A great deal may be done to inspire  the student and suggest ideas which may bring him to the proper artistic  appreciation of a passage, but it is this very indefinability which  makes the emotional phase one of the most important of all. Attendance  at the recitals of artistic pianists is of great help in this  connection.    \"The student, however, may learn a vast amount about real piano technic  and apply his knowledge to his playing through the medium of the proper  studies. For instance, in the subject of touch alone, there is a vast  store of valuable information which can be gained from a review of the  progressive steps through which this significant phase of the subject  has passed during the last century. The art of piano playing, considered  apart from that of the similar instruments which preceded the piano, is  very little over one hundred years old.      CHANGES IN THE MECHANISM OF THE INSTRUMENT    \"During this time many significant changes have been made in the  mechanism of the instrument and in the methods of manufacture. These  changes in the nature of the instrument have in themselves doubtless had  much to do with changes in methods of touch as have the natural  evolutions coming through countless experiments made by teachers and  performers. Thus we may speak of the subject of touch as being divided  into three epochs, the first being that of Czerny (characterized by a  stroke touch), the second being that of the famous Stuttgart  Conservatory (characterized by a pressure touch), and the third or new  epoch which is characterized by weight playing. All my own playing is  based upon the last named method, and I had the honor of being one of  the first to make application of it when I commenced teaching some  twenty years ago.      THE SIGNIFICANCE OF WEIGHT PLAYING    \"In this method of playing, the fingers are virtually 'glued to the  keys' in that they leave them the least possible distance in order to  accomplish their essential aims. This results in no waste motion of any  kind, no loss of power and consequently the greatest possible  conservation of energy. In this manner of playing the arm is so relaxed  that it would fall to the side if the keyboard were removed from beneath  it. Since the hand and the arm are relaxed the back (top) of the hand is  almost on a level with the forearm.    \"The high angular stroke which characterized the playing of the Czerny  epoch and which could hardly fail to cause tired muscles and unbearably  stiff playing, is seen very little in these days. By means of it the  student was taught to deliver a blow to the keyboard--a blow which  permitted very little modification to the requirements of modern  technic.    \"In my experience as a pianist and as a teacher, I have observed that  the weight touch allows the greatest possible opportunity for the proper  application of those all-important divisions of technic without which  piano playing is not only inartistic, but devoid of all interest.  Weight playing permits nothing to interfere with discriminative  phrasing, complicated rhythmical problems, the infinitely subtle  variation of time for expressive purposes now classed under the head of  agogics, all shades of dynamic gradation; in fact everything that falls  in the domain of the artist pianist.      MOULDING THE FINGERS TO THE KEYS    \"In weight playing the fingers seem to mould the piano keys under them,  the hand and arm are relaxed, but never heavy. The maximum of relaxation  results in the minimum of fatigue. In legato playing, for instance, the  fingers rest upon the fleshy part behind the tip rather than immediately  upon the tip as they would in passage work when the player desired to  have the effect of a string of pearls. The sensation in legato playing  is that of pulling back rather than striking the keys. In passages where  force is required the sensation is that of pushing.    \"Much might be said of the sensibility of the finger tips as they come  in contact with the ivory and ebony keys. Most every artist has a strong  consciousness that there is a very manifest relation between his  emotional and mental conditions and his tactile sense, that is his  highly developed sense of feeling at the finger tips on the keyboard.  However, the phenomena may be explained from the psychological  standpoint, it is nevertheless true that the feeling of longing,  yearning, hope or soulful anticipation, for instance, induces a totally  different kind of touch from that of anger, resentment or hate.    \"The artist who is incapable of communicating his emotions to the  keyboard or who must depend upon artifice to stimulate emotions rarely  electrifies his audiences. Every concert is a test of the artist's  sincerity, not merely an exhibition of his prowess, or his acrobatic  accomplishments on the keyboard. He must have some vital message to  convey to his audience or else his entire performance will prove  meaningless, soulless, worthless.    \"That which is of great importance to him is to have the least possible  barrier between his artistic conception of the work he would interpret  and the sounds that are conveyed to the ears of his audience.
