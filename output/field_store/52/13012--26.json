If either had happened to push  the wrong way, they might both have been in serious trouble. It did not  last long. Our Porky was the stronger, and his rival was driven backward  little by little till he lost his hold completely and slipped into the  lake. He came to the surface at once, and quickly swam to the shore,  where he chattered angrily for a few minutes, and then, like the  sensible bachelor that he was, wandered off up the beach in search of  other worlds more easily conquered. There was peace on our Porky's log,  and the lily-pads that grew beside it had never been as fresh and juicy  as they were that morning.    Two months later, on a hot August afternoon, I was paddling along the  edge of the Glimmerglass in company with a friend of mine, each of us in  a small dug-out canoe, when we found the Porky asleep in the sunshine.  He was lying on the nearly horizontal trunk of a tree whose roots had  been undermined by the waves till it leaned far out over the lake,  hardly a foot from the water.    My friend, by the way, is the foreman of a lumber-camp. He has served in  the British army, has hunted whales off the coast of Greenland, married  a wife in Grand Rapids, and run a street-car in Chicago; and now he is  snaking logs out of the Michigan woods. He is quite a chunk of a man,  tall and decidedly well set up, and it would take a pretty good  prize-fighter to whip him, but he learned that day that a porcupine at  close quarters is worse than a trained pugilist.    \"Look at that porky,\" he called to me. \"I'm going to ram the canoe into  the tree and knock him off into the water. Just you watch, and you'll  see some fun.\"    I was somewhat uncertain whether the joke would ultimately be on the  Porcupine or the man, but it was pretty sure to be worth seeing, one way  or the other, so I laid my paddle down and awaited developments. Bang!  went the nose of the dug-out against the tree, and the Porcupine  dropped, but not into the water. He landed in the bow of the canoe, and  the horrified look on my friend's face was a delight to see. The Porky  was wide awake by this time, for I could hear his teeth clacking as he  advanced to the attack.    \"Great Scott! He's coming straight at me!\"    The Porcupine was certainly game. I saw the paddle rise in the air and  come down with a tremendous whack, but it seemed to have little effect.  The Porky's coat of quills and hair was so thick that a blow on the back  did not trouble him much. If my friend could have hit him across the  nose it would have ended the matter then and there, but the canoe was  too narrow and its sides too high for a crosswise stroke. He tried  thrusting, but that was no better. When a good-sized porcupine has  really made up his mind to go somewhere he may be slow, but it takes  more than a punch with the end of a stick to stop him; and this Porky  had fully determined to go aft and get acquainted with the foreman.    [Illustration: \"_He quickly made his way to the beach._\"]    My friend couldn't even kick, for he was kneeling on the bottom of the  dug-out, with his feet behind him, and if he tried to stand up he would  probably capsize.    \"Say, Hulbert, what am I going to do?\"    I didn't give him any advice, for my sympathies were largely with the  Porcupine. Besides, I hadn't any advice to give. Just then the canoe  drifted around so that I could look into it, and I beheld the Porcupine  bearing down on my helpless friend like Birnam Wood on its way to  Dunsinane, his ruffle of quills erect, fire in his little black eyes,  and a thirst for vengeance in his whole aspect. My friend made one or  two final and ineffectual jabs at him, and then gave it up.    \"It's no use!\" he called; \"I'll have to tip over!\" and the next second  the canoe was upside down and both belligerents were in the water. The  Porcupine floated high--I suppose his hollow quills helped to keep him  up--and he proved a much better swimmer than I had expected, for he  quickly made his way to the beach and disappeared in the woods, still  chattering disrespectfully. My friend waded ashore, righted his canoe,  and we resumed our journey. I don't think I'll tell you what he said. He  got over it after a while, and in the end he probably enjoyed his joke  more than if it had turned out as he had intended.    The summer followed the winter into the past, and the Moon of Falling  Leaves came round again. The Porcupine was not alone. Another porky was  with him, and the two seemed very good friends. In fact, his companion  was the very same lady porcupine who had stood by while he fought the  battle of the log and the lily-pads, though I do not suppose that they  had been keeping company all those months, and I am by no means certain  that they remembered that eventful morning at all. Let us hope they  did, for the sake of the story. Who knows how much or how little of love  was stirring the slow currents of their sluggish natures--of such love  as binds the dove or the eagle to his mate, or of such steadfast  affection as the Beaver and his wife seem to have felt for each other?  Not much, perhaps; yet they climbed the same tree, ate from the same  branch, and drank at the same spring; and the next April there was  another arrival in the old hollow log--twins, this time, and both of  them alive.    But the Porcupine never saw his children, for a wandering fit seized  him, and he left the Glimmerglass before they were born. Two or three  miles away was a little clearing where a mossback lived. A railway  crossed one edge of it, between the hill and the swamp, and five miles  away was a junction, where locomotives were constantly moving about,  backing, hauling, and making up their trains. As the mossback lay awake  in the long, quiet, windless winter nights, he often heard them puffing  and snorting, now with slow, heavy coughs, and now quick and sharp and  rapid. One night when he was half asleep he heard something that said,  \"chew-chew-chew-chew-chew-chew,\" like an engine that has its train  moving and is just beginning to get up speed. At first he paid no  attention to it. But the noise suddenly stopped short, and after a pause  of a few seconds it began again at exactly the same speed; stopped  again, and began a third time. And so it went on, chewing and pausing,  chewing and pausing, with always just so many chews to the second, and  just so many seconds to each rest. No locomotive ever puffed like that.  The mossback was wide awake now, and he muttered something about  \"another of those pesky porkies.\" He had killed the last one that came  around the house, and had wanted his wife to cook it for dinner and see  how it tasted, but she wouldn't. She said that the very sight of it was  enough for her, and more than enough; and that it was all she could do  to eat pork and potatoes after looking at it.    He turned over and tried to go to sleep again, but without success. That  steady \"chew-chew-chew\" was enough to keep a woodchuck awake, and at  last he got up and went to the door. The moonlight on the snow was  almost as bright as day, and there was the Porcupine, leaning against  the side of the barn, and busily rasping the wood from around the head  of a rusty nail. The mossback threw a stick of stove-wood at him, and  he lumbered clumsily away across the snow. But twenty minutes later he  was back again, and this time he marched straight into the open shed at  the back of the house, and began operations on a wash-tub, whose mingled  flavor of soap and humanity struck him as being very delicious. Again  the mossback appeared in the doorway, shivering a little in his  night-shirt.    The Porcupine was at the foot of the steps. He had stopped chewing when  the door opened, and now he lifted his forepaws and sat half-erect, his  yellow teeth showing between his parted lips, and his little eyes  staring at the lamp which the mossback carried. The quills slanted back  from all around his diminutive face, and even from between his  eyes--short at first, but growing longer toward his shoulders and back.  Long whitish bristles were mingled with them, and the mossback could not  help thinking of a little old, old man, with hair that was grizzly-gray,  and a face that was half-stupid and half-sad and wistful. He was not yet  two years of age, but I believe that a porcupine is born old. Some of  the Indians say that he is ashamed of his homely looks, and that that is  the reason why, by day, he walks so slowly, with hanging head and  downcast eyes; but at night, they say, when the friendly darkness hides  his ugliness, he lifts his head and runs like a dog. In spite of the  hour and the cheering influence of the wash-tub, our Porky seemed even  more low-spirited than usual. Perhaps the lamplight had suddenly  reminded him of his personal appearance. At any rate he looked so  lonesome and forlorn that the mossback felt a little thrill of pity for  him, and decided not to kill him after all, but to drive him away again.  He started down the steps with his lamp in one hand and a stick of wood  in the other, and then--he never knew how it happened, but in some way  he stumbled and fell. Never in all his life, not even when his wildest  nightmare came and sat on him in the wee, sma' hours, had he come so  near screaming out in terror as he did at that moment. He thought he was  going to sit down on the Porcupine. Fortunately for both of them, but  especially for the man, he missed him by barely half an inch, and the  Porky scuttled away as fast as his legs could carry him.    In spite of this unfriendly reception, the Porcupine hung around the  edges of the clearing for several months, and enjoyed many a meal such  as seldom falls to the lot of the woods-people.

Whether the differences here pointed out are sufficient to constitute  specific distinction, is left for the umpires to decide.    [Illustration: THE ZEBU.--(_Var. beta._)]    These Indian Cattle are extremely gentle, and admirably adapted to  harness. Some of the eastern princes attach them to their artillery; but  generally they employ the finest to draw their light carriages, which in  form are very similar to those of the ancients. In mountainous  countries, they have them shod. Their pace is a kind of amble, and they  are able to sustain a journey of about twenty leagues a day. Guided by a  cord which passes through the nasal cartilage, they obey the hand with  as much precision as a horse.    In the same provinces are seen a race of dwarf Bisons, which are  scarcely as tall as our calves of two months old, generally described  under the name of _Zebu_. They are lively, well proportioned, and  trained to be mounted by children, or to draw a light car. In both cases  their pace is a sort of amble, the same as that of the larger species.    [Illustration: Zebus (_Var. gamma_) and Car.]    The curious Hindoo customs in relation to this animal have been recorded  by almost every traveller.    Neither the horse, the sheep, nor the goat, have any peculiar sanctity  annexed to them by the Braminical superstition; it is otherwise with the  cow, which in India is everywhere regarded with veneration, and is an  object of peculiar worship. Representations of objects are made upon the  walls with cow-dung, and these enter deeply into their routine of daily  observances. The same materials are also dried, and used as fuel for  dressing their victuals; for this purpose the women collect it, and bake  it into cakes, which are placed in a position where they soon become dry  and fit for use. The sacred character of the cow probably gives this  fuel a preference to every other in the imagination of a Hindoo, for it  is used in Calcutta, where wood is in abundance.    On certain occasions it is customary for the Hindoos to consecrate a  bull as an offering to their deities; particular ceremonies are then  performed, and a mark is impressed upon the animal, expressive of his  future condition to all the inhabitants. No consideration will induce  the pious Bengalee to hurt or even control one of these consecrated  animals. You may see them every day roaming at large through the streets  of Calcutta, and tasting rice, grain, or flour in the Bazar, according  to their pleasure. The utmost a native will do, when he observes the  animal doing too much honour to his goods, is to urge him, by the  gentlest hints, to taste of the vegetables or grain of his neighbour's  stall. (_Tennant's 'Indian Recreations.'_)    One of the doctrines of the Brahmins is to believe that kine have in  them somewhat of sacred and divine; that happy is the man who can be  sprinkled over with the ashes of a cow, burnt by the hand of a Brahmin;  but thrice happy is he who, in dying, lays hold of a cow's tail and  expires with it between his hands; for thus assisted, the soul departs  out of the body purified, and sometimes returns into the body of a cow.  That such a favour, notwithstanding, is not conferred but on heroic  souls, who contemn life, and die generously, either by casting  themselves headlong from a precipice, or leaping into a kindled pile, or  throwing themselves under the holy chariot wheels, to be crushed to  death by the Pagods, when they are carried in triumph about the  town.--(_Life of St. Francis Xavier, translated by Dryden, 1688._)      AFRICAN AND OTHER VARIETIES.    In Shaw's Zoology, the following species or varieties are noticed:--      LOOSE-HORNED OX.    This is said to be found in Abyssinia and in Madagascar, and is  distinguished by pendulous ears, and horns _attached only to the skin,  so as to hang down on each side_!      THE BOURY.    Of the size of a camel, and of a snowy whiteness, with a protuberance on  the back, is a native of Madagascar and some other islands.      THE TINIAN OX.    Of a white colour, with black ears. Inhabits the island of Tinian.    Bewick mentions that in Persia there are many oxen entirely white, with  small blunt horns and humps on their backs. They are very strong, and  carry heavy burdens. When about to be loaded, they drop down on their  knees like the Camel, and rise again when their burdens are properly  fastened.      THE BORNOU OX,    which Col. Smith considers a distinct species, is likewise white, of a  very large size, with hunched back, and very large horns, which are  couched outwards and downwards, like those of the African Buffalo, with  the tip forming a small half-spiral revolution. The corneous external  coat is very soft, distinctly fibrous, and at the base not much thicker  than a human nail; the osseous core full of vascular grooves, and inside  very cellular, the pair scarcely weighing four pounds. The skin passes  insensibly to the horny state, so that there is no exact demarcation  where the one commences or the other ends. The dimension of a horn  are:--length measured on the curve, three feet seven inches;  circumference at base, two feet; circumference midway, one foot six  inches; circumference two thirds up the horn, one foot; length in a  straight line, from base to tip, one foot five inches and a half. The  species has a small neck, and is the common domestic breed of Bornou,  where the Buffalo is said to have small horns.    Leguat, in his 'Voyages in 1720,' states that the oxen are of three  sorts at the Cape of Good Hope, all of a large size, and very active;  some have a hump on the back, others have the horns long and pendent,  while others have them turned up and well shaped, as in English cattle.    [Illustration: Zebu.--(_Var. delta._)]          THE DOMESTIC OXEN OF THE HOTTENTOTS, CALLED BACKELEYS, BACKELEYERS, OR  BAKELY-OSSE.    _Bos ----?_      The following particulars relating to these Oxen are taken from the  highly interesting work '_The Present State of the Cape of Good Hope_,'  by Peter Kolben, who visited that colony in 1705, and remained there  during a period of eight years.    \"The Hottentots have a sort of oxen they call Backeleyers, or fighting  oxen; they use them in their wars, as some nations do elephants; of the  taming and farming of which last creatures upon the like discipline the  Hottentots as yet know nothing. They are of great use to them, too, in  the government of their herds at pasture; for, upon a signal from their  commanders, they will fetch in stragglers, and bring the herds within  compass. They will likewise run very furiously at strangers, and  therefore are of good defence against the Buschies, or robbers who steal  cattle. They are the stateliest oxen of the herd: every Kraal has  half-a-dozen of these oxen at the least. When one of them dies, or grows  so old, that, being unfit for business, his owner kills him, a young one  is chosen out of the herd to succeed him, by an ancient Hottentot, who  is judged best able to discern his capacity for instruction. This young  ox is associated with an old Backeleyer, and taught, by blows and other  means, to follow him. At night they tie them together by the horns; and  for some part of the day they fasten them together in the same manner,  till at length, by this and I know not what other means, the young ox  is fully instructed, and becomes a watchful guardian of the herds, and  an able auxiliary in war.    \"The Backeleyers (so called from the Hottentot word Backeley for war)  know every inhabitant of the Kraal they belong to, men, women, and  children, and pay them all just the same respect that is paid by a dog  to every person who dwells in his master's house. Any of the inhabitants  may, therefore, at any time present themselves very safely on any side  of the herds; the Backeleyers will in nowise offend them. But if a  stranger, especially a European, shall approach the herds, without the  company of a Hottentot of the Kraal they belong to, he must look sharp  to himself; for these Backeleyers, which generally feed at the skirts of  the herds, quickly discover him, and make at him upon a full gallop. And  if he is not within hearing of any of the Hottentots who keep the herds,  or has not a fire-arm, or a light pair of heels, or there is not a tree  at hand which he can immediately climb, he is certainly demolished. The  Backeleyers mind not sticks or the throwing of stones at them. This is  one great reason why the Europeans always travel the Hottentot countries  with fire-arms. But the first thing a European does, upon the appearance  of such an enemy, is to shout and call to the Hottentots that look to  the herds. The Hottentot that hears him hastens to his assistance,  making all the way a very shrill whistling through his fingers. The  Backeleyers no sooner hear the whistling of their keepers, which they  very well know, than they stop, turn about, and return leisurely to the  herds.    \"But if a European, in such a case, does not (upon his shouting and  calling to the keepers), hear the whistle, before the Backeleyers come  up with him, he discharges his fire-arm,--frightened with the report of  which, the Backeleyers run away.    \"I have been often run at by the Backeleyers myself. As soon as I saw  them sallying out upon me, I shouted and called to the keepers. But I  could not often make them hear before the Backeleyers came up with me,  when I have been obliged to discharge my fire-arm (for I always carried  one about with me), upon which they always turned about and left me.    \"In the wars of the Hottentots with one another, these Backeleyers make  very terrible impressions. They gore, and kick, and trample to death,  with incredible fury. Each army has a drove of them, which they take  their opportunity to turn upon the enemy. And if an army, against which  the Backeleyers are sent, is not alert and upon all its guard,"]]]
