They will often  invest several thousand trangkas with some village, and in return for  this money the village will supply them with food, barley, milk, eggs  and fuel. Higher up the valley there was a smaller monastery, and dotted  along the hillside were numerous cells and caves where monks or nuns had  retired to meditate. Every animal that we saw in this valley was  extraordinarily tame. In the mornings we watched the burhel coming to  some hermits' cells not a hundred yards away from the camp, to be fed,  and from there they went on to other cells. They seemed to have no fear  whatever of human beings. On the way up the valley we passed within 40  to 50 yards of a fine flock of rams, but they barely moved away, and on  the way back we passed some females that were so inquisitive that they  actually came up to within 10 yards of us in order to have a look at us.  The rock pigeons came and fed out of one's hand, and the ravens and all  the other birds here were equally tame; it was most interesting to be  able to watch all their habits and to see them at such close quarters.  On July 4, Heron and I walked up the valley to see Mallory and Bullock,  who had got an Alpine camp some 7 miles further up the valley at a  height of 18,000 feet, where they were training their coolies in snow  and ice work and trying to find out whether there was any possible way  of attacking Mount Everest from this side. It was a beautiful morning  when we started, and on the way we passed one or two small monasteries  and numerous cells where hermits and recluses were living in retirement  and meditation. After crossing several small lake beds and old  moraines--for the big Rongbuk Glacier seemed to have been retiring in  the last few years--we came to the big moraine-covered Rongbuk Glacier.  This glacier appeared to be about 8 or 9 miles long, starting  immediately below an immense circle of cliffs which formed the North  face of Mount Everest. We found afterwards that there were several other  side glaciers that joined in it, which were even larger and longer than  the centre glacier. After some steep scrambles up the moraine-covered  glacier and on to a high terrace on the West side of it, we found  Mallory and Bullock with their coolies encamped in a pleasantly  sheltered spot with plenty of water close at hand and commanding the  most magnificent views of Mount Everest, which here seemed to be only  about 6 miles away and towered up above the glacier, showing immense  cliffs 10,000 feet high. Mallory and Bullock were hard at work training  the coolies in snow and ice work and exploring all the different  glaciers from that side. They were, however, much handicapped by there  only being two of them, which made the work more strenuous. After  spending the day with them, Heron and I returned to our camp in the  evening. The evening light on Mount Everest was wonderfully beautiful.  The weather seems nearly always to clear up about sunset, and its summit  then usually towers far above the clouds in a clear sky. At dusk several  of the Lamas came for medicines of different kinds, which we gave them,  and much to our surprise in the morning they presented us with a number  of fresh eggs in gratitude. Having seen Mallory and Bullock well  established in this valley, our next most important duty seemed to be to  select a site for our next base camp. Some place on the East side of  Mount Everest would have to be chosen, and it seemed that somewhere in  the Kharta Valley would be the most likely spot. Heron and I therefore  determined that we would make a quick reconnaissance of that district  before returning to Tingri. On the following day we moved down from the  Rongbuk Monastery.                                           CHAPTER V                               THE SEARCH FOR KHARTA      After leaving Mallory and Bullock to continue the search for a possible  route up Mount Everest from the Rongbuk side, Heron and I, on July 5,  started off down the Rongbuk Valley in order to visit Kharta. We had  been told that it was only two days' easy march from the monastery to  get there. It was a cold morning when we started off; there had been a  sharp frost during the night and the sun did not reach us till late in  the morning. Mount Everest stood out at the head of the valley  wonderfully clear and clothed with a fresh mantle of white. Instead of  crossing over the river by the bridge, at Choebu, we kept straight on  down the valley till we came to Choedzong, where were the first barley  fields and cultivation. There was plenty of water here for irrigation  purposes, and some fine grassy fields on which many ponies were grazing.  We had to change our transport in this village and get fresh animals, so  that it was not till three o'clock in the afternoon that we got started  again. In Tibet they have a system of stages, and animals from one  village are taken, as a rule, for one stage only. As each stage usually  ends at the next village, and as villages are frequent, this is a most  awkward and inconvenient arrangement--as it necessitates three or four  changes a day. In order to avoid these constant changes, we used to  persuade the villagers by promises of extra baksheesh, especially where  we had a large number of animals, to undertake two or three stages.  After leaving Choedzong we climbed up over a steep pass 1,200 feet above  the valley and found a still deeper descent to the village of Halung,  which lay at our feet. Here we waited for our transport, but as this  did not arrive till dark, we decided to camp there, though we had only  done 18 miles from Rongbuk; the yak travels very slowly. We were now  again at 14,800 feet and found a much warmer climate, with green barley  fields and here and there patches of yellow mustard. A large rhubarb  with a curious crinkled leaf grew here and there in the fields. We tried  to eat this rhubarb; it had an unpleasant taste, but this disappeared  when it was cooked and it proved a welcome addition to our diet. The  Tibetans do not use it for food, as sugar--without which it would be  uneatable--is scarce and expensive in the country. The plant serves,  however, as an acid for dyes.    Halung is a very prosperous-looking village with well-built houses. The  villagers soon had three tents pitched for us on a grassy field between  the village and the river; cushions, cooking pots and fuel were also  brought out for us. Here we camped for the night in reasonable comfort.  On the following morning the loads were all carried by hand across a  fragile bridge over the glacier stream, while the yaks and the ponies  were driven across it. We then rode for a mile down the green and  well-watered valley, and afterwards turned up into another valley where  every flat space was green with barley-fields intermixed with brilliant  patches of yellow from the fields of mustard. A small glacier stream fed  this valley and supplied plenty of water for irrigation. After passing  several small villages we rode across a spur also covered with  barley-fields to Rebu, where we had to change our transport. This was  quite a picturesque village situated on a rocky knoll, part of the  village being on one side and part on the other of the river. Along the  various irrigation canals were wild flowers of all kinds. Monkshood grew  there, also black and yellow clematis, rhubarb, ranunculus and primulas  of different kinds. By ten o'clock our transport was changed and we were  given ponies instead of yaks: they travel much quicker and we had  apparently a long way to go yet before we could reach the next village.  We were expecting all the time to get to Kharta that evening, but where  distances are concerned all Tibetans are liars, and after doing 26 miles  we stopped, Kharta being apparently as far off as ever. After leaving  Rebu the path led for some miles up an uninteresting valley, in which  limestone cliffs on one side and sandstone cliffs on the other came down  almost to the stream, the waters of which, in contrast to the muddy  glacier streams that we had been meeting the whole time, were as clear  as crystal. There were many small birds along the banks, all of them  wonderfully tame; these, when we were resting for lunch, hopped all  round us and under our legs, carrying off crumbs or any morsels of food.  We now climbed up on to a pass called the Doya La, 17,000 feet, from the  top of which were fine views of great rocky peaks on either side, those  on the South being covered in parts with hanging glaciers. About a  quarter of a mile from the top of the pass we struck some granite soil  on which grew an extraordinary variety of Alpine flowers; the blue poppy  abounded, pink, yellow and white saxifrages covered all the rocks, and  besides these were many other plants which I had not seen before and  which were quite new to me. The range which we now crossed acts as a  barrier against the approach of the Monsoon clouds and prevents them  from passing over into Tibet. Over on the North side the country is  mostly dry and very little grows there, whereas on the South there is a  rich and varied vegetation and the air feels soft and moist. The road  from the pass led by an easy descent into a fine valley with a green  lake lying at its head under the dark cliffs of some bold rocky peaks.  We followed this valley for many miles, a strong head wind blowing  against us the whole of the time, and found ourselves before long once  more among the junipers and willows. We also saw pink and white  rhododendrons, and in places a small yellow one with waxy blossoms. The  yellow rock cistus, spiraeas, roses, yellow primulas, blue monkshood,  campanulas, blue anemones, and hundreds of other wild flowers formed a  rich flora which showed that a considerable precipitation from the  Monsoon fell in this valley.    At last we came to a village, but every one fled at our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39465"],[0,"Eleven Years in the Rocky Mountains and Life on the Frontier (#19)"],[1,"of Ogden's company, and immediately set about endeavoring  to purchase from the Rockways and others, the furs collected for Mr.  Ogden. Not succeeding by fair means, if the means to such an end could  be called fair,--they opened a keg of whiskey, which, when the Indians  had got a taste, soon drew them away from the Hudson's Bay trader, the  regulations of whose company forbade the selling or giving of liquors to  the Indians. Under its influence, the furs were disposed of to the Rocky  Mountain Company, who in this manner obtained nearly the whole product  of their year's hunt. This course of conduct was naturally exceedingly  disagreeable to Mr. Ogden, as well as unprofitable also; and a feeling  of hostility grew up and increased between the two camps.    While matters were in this position, a stampede one day occurred among  the horses in Ogden's camp, and two or three of the animals ran away,  and ran into the camp of the rival company. Among them was the horse of  Mr. Ogden's Indian wife, which had escaped, with her babe hanging to the  saddle.    Not many minutes elapsed, before the mother, following her child and  horse, entered the camp, passing right through it, and catching the now  halting steed by the bridle. At the same moment she espied one of her  company's pack-horses, loaded with beaver, which had also run into the  enemy's camp. The men had already begun to exult over the circumstance,  considering this chance load of beaver as theirs, by the laws of war.  But not so the Indian woman. Mounting her own horse, she fearlessly  seized the pack-horse by the halter, and led it out of camp, with its  costly burden.    At this undaunted action, some of the baser sort of men cried out \"shoot  her, shoot her!\" but a majority interfered, with opposing cries of \"let  her go; let her alone; she's a brave woman: I glory in her pluck;\" and  other like admiring expressions. While the clamor continued, the wife of  Ogden had galloped away, with her baby and her pack-horse.    As the season advanced, Fitzpatrick, with his other partners, returned  to the east side of the mountains, and went into winter quarters on  Powder river. In this trapper's \"land of Canaan\" they remained between  two and three months. The other two partners, Frapp and Jervais, who  were trapping far to the south, did not return until the following year.    While wintering it became necessary to send a dispatch to St. Louis on  the company's business. Meek and a Frenchman named Legarde, were chosen  for this service, which was one of trust and peril also. They proceeded  without accident, however, until the Pawnee villages were reached, when  Legarde was taken prisoner. Meek, more cautious, escaped, and proceeded  alone a few days' travel beyond, when he fell in with an express on its  way to St. Louis, to whom he delivered his dispatches, and returned to  camp, accompanied only by a Frenchman named Cabeneau; thus proving  himself an efficient mountaineer at twenty years of age.    1831. As soon as the spring opened, sometime in March, the whole company  started north again, for the Blackfoot country. But on the night of the  third day out, they fell unawares into the neighborhood of a party of  Crow Indians, whose spies discovered the company's horses feeding on the  dry grass of a little bottom, and succeeded in driving off about three  hundred head. Here was a dilemma to be in, in the heart of an enemy's  country! To send the remaining horses after these, might be \"sending the  axe after the helve;\" besides most of them belonged to the free  trappers, and could not be pressed into the service.    The only course remaining was to select the best men and dispatch them  on foot, to overtake and retake the stolen horses. Accordingly one  hundred trappers were ordered on this expedition, among whom were Meek,  Newell, and Antoine Godin, a half-breed and brave fellow, who was to  lead the party. Following the trail of the Crows for two hundred miles,  traveling day and night, on the third day they came up with them on a  branch of the Bighorn river. The trappers advanced cautiously, and being  on the opposite side of the stream, on a wooded bluff, were enabled to  approach close enough to look into their fort, and count the  unsuspecting thieves. There were sixty of them, fine young braves, who  believed that now they had made a start in life. Alas, for the vanity of  human, and especially of Crow expectations! Even then, while they were  grouped around their fires, congratulating themselves on the sudden  wealth which had descended upon them, as it were from the skies, an  envious fate, in the shape of several roguish white trappers, was  laughing at them and their hopes, from the overhanging bluff opposite  them. And by and by, when they were wrapped in a satisfied slumber, two  of these laughing rogues, Robert Newell, and Antoine Godin, stole under  the very walls of their fort, and setting the horses free, drove them  across the creek.    The Indians were awakened by the noise of the trampling horses, and  sprang to arms. But Meek and his fellow-trappers on the bluff fired into  the fort with such effect that the Crows were appalled. Having delivered  their first volley, they did not wait for the savages to recover from  their recoil. Mounting in hot haste, the cavalcade of bare-back riders,  and their drove of horses, were soon far away from the Crow fort,  leaving the ambitious braves to finish their excursion on foot. It was  afterwards ascertained that the Crows lost seven men by that one volley  of the trappers.    Flushed with success, the trappers yet found the backward journey more  toilsome than the outward; for what with sleeplessness and fatigue, and  bad traveling in melted snow, they were pretty well exhausted when they  reached camp. Fearing, however, another raid from the thieving Crows,  the camp got in motion again with as little delay as possible. They had  not gone far, when Fitzpatrick turned back, with only one man, to go to  St. Louis for supplies.    After the departure of Fitzpatrick, Bridger and Sublette completed their  spring and summer campaign without any material loss in men or animals,  and with considerable gain in beaver skins. Having once more visited the  Yellowstone, they turned to the south again, crossing the mountains into  Pierre's Hole, on to Snake river; thence to Salt river; thence to Bear  river; and thence to Green river, to rendezvous.    It was expected that Fitzpatrick would have arrived from St. Louis with  the usual annual recruits and supplies of merchandise, in time for the  summer rendezvous; but after waiting for some time in vain, Bridger and  Sublette determined to send out a small party to look for him. The large  number of men now employed, had exhausted the stock of goods on hand.  The camp was without blankets and without ammunition; knives were not to  be had; traps were scarce; but worse than all, the tobacco had given  out, and alcohol was not! In such a case as this, what could a  mountain-man do?    To seek the missing Booshway became not only a duty, but a necessity;  and not only a necessity of the physical man, but in an equal degree a  need of the moral and spiritual man, which was rusting with the tedium  of waiting. In the state of uncertainty in which the minds of the  company were involved, it occurred to that of Frapp to consult a great  \"medicine-man\" of the Crows, one of those recruits filched from Mr.  Ogden's party by whiskey the previous year.    Like all eminent professional men, the Crow chief required a generous  fee, of the value of a horse or two, before he would begin to make  \"medicine.\" This peculiar ceremony is pretty much alike among all the  different tribes. It is observed first in the making of a medicine man,  _i. e._, qualifying him for his profession; and afterwards is practiced  to enable him to heal the sick, to prophecy, and to dream dreams, or  even to give victory to his people. To a medicine-man was imputed great  power, not only to cure, but to kill; and if, as it sometimes happened,  the relatives of a sick man suspected the medicine-man of having caused  his death, by the exercise of evil powers, one of them, or all of them,  pursued him to the death. Therefore, although it might be honorable, it  was not always safe to be a great \"medicine.\"    The Indians placed a sort of religious value upon the practice of  fasting; a somewhat curious fact, when it is remembered how many  compulsory fasts they are obliged to endure, which must train them to  think lightly of the deprivation of food. Those, however, who could  endure voluntary abstinence long enough, were enabled to become very  wise and very brave. The manner of making a \"medicine\" among some of the  interior tribes, is in certain respects similar to the practice gone  through with by some preachers, in making a convert. A sort of  camp-meeting is held, for several nights, generally about five, during  which various dances are performed, with cries, and incantations, bodily  exercises, singing, and nervous excitement; enough to make many  patients, instead of one doctor. But the native's constitution is a  strong one, and he holds out well. At last, however, one or more are  overcome with the mysterious _power_ which enters into them at that  time; making, instead of a saint, only a superstitious Indian doctor.    The same sort of exercises which had made the Cree man a doctor were now  resorted to, in order that he might obtain a more than natural sight,  enabling him to see visions of the air, or at the least to endow him  with prophetic dreams. After several nights of singing, dancing,  hopping, screeching, beating of drums, and other more violent exercises  and contortions, the exhausted medicine-man fell off to sleep, and when  he awoke he announced to Frapp that Fitzpatrick was not dead. He was on  the road; some road; but not the right one; etc., etc.    Thus"]]]
