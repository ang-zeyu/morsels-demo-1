In spite of the  revolutionary results of modern physics, the empirical successes of the  conception of matter show that there must be some legitimate conception  which fulfils roughly the same functions. The time has hardly come when  we can state precisely what this legitimate conception is, but we can  see in a general way what it must be like. For this purpose, it is only  necessary to take our ordinary common-sense statements and reword them  without the assumption of permanent substance. We say, for example, that  things change gradually--sometimes very quickly, but not without passing  through a continuous series of intermediate states. What this means is  that, given any sensible appearance, there will usually be, _if we  watch_, a continuous series of appearances connected with the given one,  leading on by imperceptible gradations to the new appearances which  common-sense regards as those of the same thing. Thus a thing may be  defined as a certain series of appearances, connected with each other by  continuity and by certain causal laws. In the case of slowly changing  things, this is easily seen. Consider, say, a wall-paper which fades in  the course of years. It is an effort not to conceive of it as one  \"thing\" whose colour is slightly different at one time from what it is  at another. But what do we really _know_ about it? We know that under  suitable circumstances--_i.e._ when we are, as is said, \"in the  room\"--we perceive certain colours in a certain pattern: not always  precisely the same colours, but sufficiently similar to feel familiar.  If we can state the laws according to which the colour varies, we can  state all that is empirically verifiable; the assumption that there is a  constant entity, the wall-paper, which \"has\" these various colours at  various times, is a piece of gratuitous metaphysics. We may, if we like,  _define_ the wall-paper as the series of its aspects. These are  collected together by the same motives which led us to regard the  wall-paper as one thing, namely a combination of sensible continuity and  causal connection. More generally, a \"thing\" will be defined as a  certain series of aspects, namely those which would commonly be said to  be _of_ the thing. To say that a certain aspect is an aspect _of_ a  certain thing will merely mean that it is one of those which, taken  serially, _are_ the thing. Everything will then proceed as before:  whatever was verifiable is unchanged, but our language is so interpreted  as to avoid an unnecessary metaphysical assumption of permanence.    The above extrusion of permanent things affords an example of the maxim  which inspires all scientific philosophising, namely \"Occam's razor\":  _Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity._ In other words,  in dealing with any subject-matter, find out what entities are  undeniably involved, and state everything in terms of these entities.  Very often the resulting statement is more complicated and difficult  than one which, like common sense and most philosophy, assumes  hypothetical entities whose existence there is no good reason to believe  in. We find it easier to imagine a wall-paper with changing colours than  to think merely of the series of colours; but it is a mistake to suppose  that what is easy and natural in thought is what is most free from  unwarrantable assumptions, as the case of \"things\" very aptly  illustrates.    The above summary account of the genesis of \"things,\" though it may be  correct in outline, has omitted some serious difficulties which it is  necessary briefly to consider. Starting from a world of helter-skelter  sense-data, we wish to collect them into series, each of which can be  regarded as consisting of the successive appearances of one \"thing.\"  There is, to begin with, some conflict between what common sense regards  as one thing, and what physics regards an unchanging collection of  particles. To common sense, a human body is one thing, but to science  the matter composing it is continually changing. This conflict, however,  is not very serious, and may, for our rough preliminary purpose, be  largely ignored. The problem is: by what principles shall we select  certain data from the chaos, and call them all appearances of the same  thing?    A rough and approximate answer to this question is not very difficult.  There are certain fairly stable collections of appearances, such as  landscapes, the furniture of rooms, the faces of acquaintances. In these  cases, we have little hesitation in regarding them on successive  occasions as appearances of one thing or collection of things. But, as  the _Comedy of Errors_ illustrates, we may be led astray if we judge by  mere resemblance. This shows that something more is involved, for two  different things may have any degree of likeness up to exact similarity.    Another insufficient criterion of one thing is _continuity_. As we have  already seen, if we watch what we regard as one changing thing, we  usually find its changes to be continuous so far as our senses can  perceive. We are thus led to assume that, if we see two finitely  different appearances at two different times, and if we have reason to  regard them as belonging to the same thing, then there was a continuous  series of intermediate states of that thing during the time when we were  not observing it. And so it comes to be thought that continuity of  change is necessary and sufficient to constitute one thing. But in fact  it is neither. It is not _necessary_, because the unobserved states, in  the case where our attention has not been concentrated on the thing  throughout, are purely hypothetical, and cannot possibly be our ground  for supposing the earlier and later appearances to belong to the same  thing; on the contrary, it is because we suppose this that we assume  intermediate unobserved states. Continuity is also not sufficient, since  we can, for example, pass by sensibly continuous gradations from any one  drop of the sea to any other drop. The utmost we can say is that  discontinuity during uninterrupted observation is as a rule a mark of  difference between things, though even this cannot be said in such cases  as sudden explosions.    The assumption of continuity is, however, successfully made in physics.  This proves something, though not anything of very obvious utility to  our present problem: it proves that nothing in the known world is  inconsistent with the hypothesis that all changes are really continuous,  though from too great rapidity or from our lack of observation they may  not always appear continuous. In this hypothetical sense, continuity may  be allowed to be a _necessary_ condition if two appearances are to be  classed as appearances of the same thing. But it is not a _sufficient_  condition, as appears from the instance of the drops in the sea. Thus  something more must be sought before we can give even the roughest  definition of a \"thing.\"    What is wanted further seems to be something in the nature of fulfilment  of causal laws. This statement, as it stands, is very vague, but we will  endeavour to give it precision. When I speak of \"causal laws,\" I mean  any laws which connect events at different times, or even, as a limiting  case, events at the same time provided the connection is not logically  demonstrable. In this very general sense, the laws of dynamics are  causal laws, and so are the laws correlating the simultaneous  appearances of one \"thing\" to different senses. The question is: How do  such laws help in the definition of a \"thing\"?    To answer this question, we must consider what it is that is proved by  the empirical success of physics. What is proved is that its hypotheses,  though unverifiable where they go beyond sense-data, are at no point in  contradiction with sense-data, but, on the contrary, are ideally such as  to render all sense-data calculable from a sufficient collection of data  all belonging to a given period of time. Now physics has found it  empirically possible to collect sense-data into series, each series  being regarded as belonging to one \"thing,\" and behaving, with regard to  the laws of physics, in a way in which series not belonging to one thing  would in general not behave. If it is to be unambiguous whether two  appearances belong to the same thing or not, there must be only one way  of grouping appearances so that the resulting things obey the laws of  physics. It would be very difficult to prove that this is the case, but  for our present purposes we may let this point pass, and assume that  there is only one way. We must include in our definition of a \"thing\"  those of its aspects, if any, which are not observed. Thus we may lay  down the following definition: _Things are those series of aspects which  obey the laws of physics._ That such series exist is an empirical fact,  which constitutes the verifiability of physics.    It may still be objected that the \"matter\" of physics is something other  than series of sense-data. Sense-data, it may be said, belong to  psychology and are, at any rate in some sense, subjective, whereas  physics is quite independent of psychological considerations, and does  not assume that its matter only exists when it is perceived.    To this objection there are two answers, both of some importance.    (a) We have been considering, in the above account, the question of the  _verifiability_ of physics. Now verifiability is by no means the same  thing as truth; it is, in fact, something far more subjective and  psychological. For a proposition to be verifiable, it is not enough that  it should be true, but it must also be such as we can _discover_ to be  true. Thus verifiability depends upon our capacity for acquiring  knowledge, and not only upon the objective truth. In physics, as  ordinarily set forth, there is much that is unverifiable: there are  hypotheses as to ("]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37122"],[0,"Hunting in Many Lands: The Book of the Boone and Crockett Club (#19)"],[1,"wolf family whose habitat was an  enormous marshy wood, entirely impossible to mounted men, we were  compelled to await for forty-eight hours the return of the old ones,  father and mother. At times during this wait only the young ones, at  other times the young and the intermediate ones, would sing. Not hearing  the old ones, we inferred they were absent, and so they were--off on a  raid, during which they killed two peasant horses ten miles from their  stronghold. It was supposed that the wolves of intermediate age also  made excursions during this time, as indicated by the howlings, but not  to such great distances as the old ones. It was perfectly apparent, as  we listened one evening, that the old ones had placed the young ones  about a verst away and were making them answer independently. This  seemed too human for wolves.    After one day and two nights of travel we arrived at the little station  of Peschalkino, on the Bologoe-Rybinsk Railway, not far from the  frontier between the two governments, Tver and Yaroslav, where we were  met by two officers of the guard, a Yellow Cuirassier and a  Preobiajensky, on leave of absence on their estates (Koy), sixteen  versts from the rail. They were brothers-in-law and keen sportsmen, who  became members of our party and who indicated the best localities for  game on their property, as well as on the adjoining estates.    Peschalkino boasts a painted country tavern of two stories, the upper of  which, with side entrance, we occupied, using our own beds and bed  linen, table and table linen, cooking and kitchen utensils; in fact, it  was a hotel where we engaged the walled-in space and the brick cooking  stove. As to the huntsmen and the dogs, they were quartered in the  adjacent unpainted log-house peasant village--just such villages as are  seen all over Russia, in which a mud road, with plenty of mud, comprises  all there is of streets and avenues. After having arranged our temporary  domicile, and having carefully examined horses and dogs to see how they  had endured the journey, we made ready to accept a dinner invitation at  the country place of our new members. Horses were put to the brake,  called by the Russians _Amerikanka_ (American), and we set out for a  drive of sixteen versts over a mud road to enjoy the well-known Slav  hospitality so deeply engrafted in the Ponamaroff family.    I said road, but in reality it scarcely merits the name, as it is  neither fenced nor limited in width other than by the sweet will of the  traveler. Special mention is made of this road because its counterparts  exist all over the empire. It is the usual road, and not the exception,  which is worse, as many persons have ample reasons for knowing. This  condition is easily explained by the scarcity of stone, the inherent  disregard of comfort, the poverty of the peasants, the absence of a  yeoman class, and the great expense that would be entailed upon the  landed proprietors, who live at enormous distances from each other. The  country in these and many other governments has been civilized many  generations, but so unfinished and primitive does it all seem that it  recalls many localities of our West, where civilization appeared but  yesterday, and where to-morrow it will be well in advance of these  provinces. The hand-flail, the wooden plow-share, the log cabin with  stable under the same roof, could have been seen here in the twelfth  century as they are at present. Thanks to the Moscow factories, the gala  attire of the peasant of to-day may possibly surpass in brilliancy of  color that of his remote ancestry, which was clad entirely from the home  loom. With the exception of the white brick churches, whose tall green  and white spires in the distance appear at intervals of eight to ten  versts, and of occasional painted window casings, there is nothing to  indicate that the colorings of time and nature are not preferable to  those of art. The predominating features of the landscape are the  windmills and the evenness of the grain-producing country, dotted here  and there by clumps of woods, called islands. The churches, too, are  conspicuous by their number, size, and beauty of architecture;  school-houses, by their absence. Prior to 1861 there must have been a  veritable mania here for church-building. The large and beautiful church  at Koy, as well as two other pretentious brick ones, were constructed on  his estates by the grandfather of our host.    Arrived at Koy, we found a splendid country place, with brick buildings,  beautiful gardens, several hot-houses and other luxuries, all of which  appeared the more impressive by contrast. The reception and hospitality  accorded us at Koy--where we were highly entertained with singing,  dancing and cards until midnight--was as bounteous as the darkness and  rainfall which awaited us on the sixteen versts' drive over roadless  roads back to our quarter bivouac at Peschalkino.    The following morning marked the beginning of our hunting. About 10  o'clock all was in readiness. Every hunter[5] had been provided with a  leash, a knife and a whip; and, naturally, every huntsman with the two  latter. In order to increase the number of posts, some of the huntsmen  were also charged with leashes of greyhounds. I shall in the future use  the word greyhound to describe all the sight hounds, in  contradistinction to fox-hound; it includes barzois (Russian  greyhounds), greyhounds (English) and crosses between the two. The  barzois numbered about 75 per cent. of all the greyhounds, and were for  the most part somewhat less speedy than the real greyhounds, but better  adapted for wolf-hunting. They also have greater skill in taking hold,  and this, even in hare coursing, sometimes gives them advantage over  faster dogs. One of the most interesting features of the coursing was  the matching of Russian and English greyhounds. The leash system used in  the field offers practically the same fairness as is shown by dogs at  regular coursing matches. The leash is a black narrow leather thong  about fifteen feet long, with a loop at one end that passes over the  right shoulder and under the left arm. The long thong with a slit at the  end, forming the hand loop, is, when not in use, folded up like a lariat  or a driving rein, and is stuck under the knife belt. To use it, the end  is put through the loop-ring collars, which the greyhounds continually  wear, and is then held fast in the left hand until ready to slip the  hounds. Where the country is at all brushy, three dogs are the practical  limit of one leash, still for the most part only two are employed. It is  surprising to see how quickly the dogs learn the leash with mounted  huntsmen; two or three days are sufficient to teach them to remain at  the side of the horse and at a safe distance from his feet. Upon seeing  this use of the leash with two dogs each, I was curious to know why it  should be so; why it would not be more exciting to see half a dozen or  more hounds in hot pursuit racing against each other and having a common  goal, just as it is more exciting to see a horse race with a numerous  entry than merely with two competitors. This could have been remedied,  so I thought, by having horsemen go in pairs, or having several dogs  when possible on one leash. Practice showed the wisdom of the methods  actually employed. In the first place, it is fairer for the game; in the  second, it saves the dogs; and finally, it allows a greater territory to  be hunted over with the same number of dogs.      [5] Hunter-gentleman, huntsman, man of the hunt--conventional terms.    There are two ways of hunting foxes and hares, and, with certain  variations, wolves also. These are, by beating and driving with  fox-hounds, and by open driving with greyhounds alone. In the first case  a particular wood (island) is selected, and the fox-hounds with their  mounted huntsmen are sent to drive it in a certain direction. The  various leashes of greyhounds (barzois alone if wolves be expected) are  posted on the opposite side, at the edge of the wood or in the field,  and are loosed the second the game has shown its intention of clearing  the open space expressly selected for the leash. The mounted beaters  with the fox-hounds approach the thick woods of evergreens, cottonwood,  birch and undergrowth, and wait on its outskirts until a bugle signal  informs them that all the greyhound posts are ready. The fox-hounds  recognize the signal, and would start immediately were they not  terrorized by the black _nagaika_--a product of a country that has from  remotest times preferred the knout[6] to the gallows, and so is skilled  in its manufacture and use. At the word _go_ from the chief beater the  seventy fox-hounds, which have been huddled up as closely as the  encircling beaters could make them, rush into the woods. In a few  minutes, sometimes seconds, the music begins--and what music! I really  think there are too many musicians, for the voices not being classified,  there is no individuality, but simply a prolonged howl. For my part, I  prefer fewer hounds, where the individual voices may be distinguished.  It seemed to be a needless use of so many good dogs, for half the number  would drive as well; but they were out for exercise and training, and  they must have it. Subsequently the pack was divided into two, but this  was not necessitated by fatigue of the hounds, for we hunted on  alternate days with greyhounds alone.      [6] Though not pertinent to the subject, I cannot refrain from    relating a curious comparison made to me by a very intelligent    Russian, aide-de-camp general of the late Emperor: \"Just as the    scarcity of women in early American times caused them to be highly    appreciated and tenderly cared for, so the relative scarcity of men in    early Russia caused the Government to appreciate them and to preserve    them at all hazards.
