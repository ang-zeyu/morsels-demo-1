The young prince had been extremely popular at Woolwich,  and was indeed an immense favourite with all who knew him--high-spirited  and full of life, and yet singularly gentle and courteous in manner.  He  was by nature adapted to win the hearts of all who came in contact with  him.  His abilities too were of the very highest order, as was proved by  the fact that, although suffering under the disadvantage of being a  foreigner, he yet came out so high in the final examination at Woolwich  as to be entitled to a commission in the Royal Engineers.  When it is  considered how keen is the competition to enter Woolwich, and that all  the students there, having won their places by competitive examinations,  may be said to be considerably above the average of ability, it will be  seen that, for one who had previously gone through an entirely different  course of education, and had now to study in a language that was not his  own, to take rank among the foremost of these was a proof both of  exceptional ability and industry.    A splendid career was open for the young prince, for there is little  doubt that, had he lived, he would sooner or later have mounted the  throne of his father, and there are few pages of history more sad than  those which relate to his death in a paltry skirmish in a corner of  Africa.  To Englishmen the page is all the more sad, inasmuch as, had  the men accompanying him acted with the coolness and calmness generally  shown by Englishmen in a moment of danger, instead of being carried away  by a cowardly panic, the Prince Imperial might yet be alive.    At Kopje-allein Newdigate's column was joined by that of General Wood.  Three days were spent in carefully exploring the country, and on the 1st  of June the division, as nearly as possible 20,000 strong, with a  baggage-train of 400 native waggons, moved forward and encamped near the  Itelezi River.  The flying column of General Wood went on one march  ahead, and the country was carefully scouted by Buller's horse for  twenty miles round, and no Zulus were found.    CHAPTER NINE.    ULUNDI.    On Sunday, the 1st of June, General Wood with a small escort was out  reconnoitring in advance of his column, which was about five miles in  front of the force of General Newdigate.  The morning was clear and  fresh, the ridges of the hills on either side were dotted with Buller's  horsemen.  They crossed the river by a ford, and having ridden about  another mile forward they observed some of the vedettes on the high  ground signalling that horsemen were approaching.    Riding on to see who they could be, they were joined by Colonel Buller  and a dozen of his men, and together they rode forward to meet the five  men who were seen approaching.  In a few seconds Lieutenant Carey and  four troopers of Bettington's Horse rode up, and when they had told  their story English soldiers had the shame and humiliation of knowing  that an English officer and four English troopers had escaped unwounded  from a Zulu ambush, in which they had left a gallant young prince, the  guest of England and the hope of France, to be barbarously slain.    Early in the morning the prince had learnt that a patrol was to be sent  out in advance of the column, and had applied for and obtained  permission to accompany it.  Colonel Harrison, acting as  quartermaster-general, granted the permission, and had an interview with  the prince.    Six men of Bettington's Horse and the same number of Shepstone's Basutos  were to form the party; but unfortunately the Basutos did not come up at  the appointed time, and the patrol consisted therefore only of the  prince, Lieutenant Carey, the six men of Bettington's Horse, and one  Zulu.  Considering the importance of the safety of the prince, a grave  responsibility attaches to the staff-officer who allowed him to go with  so small a party.    After an hour's ride they reached the crest of a hill and dismounted to  fix the position of some distant points by the compass.  Here Colonel  Harrison overtook them, and remarked that the whole of the escort was  not with them, and that they had better wait for the Basutos to come up.  The prince said--    \"Oh, we are quite strong enough--besides, we have all our friends around  us, and with my glass I can see General Marshall's cavalry coming up.\"    Unfortunately Colonel Harrison did not insist that the party should wait  until the Basutos arrived, and they proceeded another seven miles, and  then halted in an isolated kraal in a valley.  A worse spot could not  have been selected for a halt, as it was surrounded by long grass, six  or seven feet high; here the saddles were taken off the horses, and  coffee was prepared.  Without any search being made they sat down to  make coffee, although it was clear, from the burnt embers, bones, and  other _debris_, that the place had been but recently occupied.    The Zulu was the first to see the enemy in the long grass, and the  horses were at once saddled.  The escort stood ready by them, and just  as the prince gave the word, \"Prepare to mount,\" the Zulus' war-cry  burst out, and some guns were fired from the grass.    The horses started at the outburst, and some broke away.  Never were a  body of troops in an enemy's country so unprepared for the attack.  Not  a carbine was loaded! not a sentry placed!  Each of the troopers,  including the officer, was seized with a wild panic, and thought only of  flight,--one indeed had fallen at the first shot.  The prince's horse  was ill-tempered and badly broken, and, frightened by the firing and  yells, he was so restive that the prince was unable to mount.  Had one  of those men stood for an instant at his head the prince might have  gained his saddle, but all had galloped away, leaving him alone.  Running by his horse, he in vain endeavoured to mount; he had not had  time to tighten the girth, the saddle slipped round, and the horse  galloped away.  Unfortunately the prince's revolvers were in the  holsters, so he was unarmed, save with his sword, and with this he stood  bravely at bay, and died nobly facing his foes, who pierced him with  assegais at a distance.    According to Zulu accounts afterwards obtained, there were but five or  six men engaged in the attack, and had the Englishmen accompanying the  prince, nay even had one of them, possessed but the smallest amount of  presence of mind and courage, the Prince Imperial might have been saved.  There is no blacker page in the annals of English military history.    The feeling of indignation, shame, and regret in the English camp, when  this shameful episode was known, was indescribable.  Of all the party  the friendly Zulu was the only one who came out with honour; he had gone  towards the river to fetch water when he discovered the enemy, and might  have instantly taken flight.  He returned, however, and gave warning  that the Zulus were lurking round.  Even then it does not appear that he  attempted to fly, but fought the foe until overcome by numbers.  His  body was afterwards discovered not far from that of the prince, riddled  with wounds, together with a number of his own assegais broken, but  stained with the blood of his assailants.    The next morning the cavalry rode out to find and bring in the prince's  body.  When it was discovered, it was tenderly brought into camp.  It  was afterwards taken over to England, and laid by the remains of his  father at Chislehurst.  A court-martial was held on Lieutenant Carey.  The sentence was kept secret, but it was generally understood that he  was dismissed from the service with ignominy.  He was sent home under  arrest, but on his arrival there the proceedings of the court-martial  were declared null and void on account of some technical irregularity,  and he was ordered to resume his duties.  It was reported that this  extraordinary leniency was shown by the special desire of the Empress,  who made a personal request to the Queen that nothing should be done in  the matter.    Early in June some messengers arrived in Lord Chelmsford's camp from  Cetewayo.  Lord Chelmsford told them that before any negotiations could  be entered into, the whole of the spoil taken at Isandula, especially  the two captured 7-pounder guns, must be restored.    Considerable delays now took place, and for three weeks a force of  Englishmen sufficient to march through and through Zululand in every  direction was kept doing nothing at a distance of three days' march from  the enemy's capital.  So extraordinary and unaccountable was the delay  that the English government appointed Sir Garnet Wolseley to go out to  supersede Lord Chelmsford.  Upon the receipt of this news preparations  for an advance were at last made.  On the 21st General Newdigate's  column reached the right bank of the Umlatoosi.  General Crealock, who  commanded the division which was operating by the sea, also moved  forward about this time, but met with such difficulties, owing to the  sickness which attacked his transport-train, that he was unable to  co-operate with the first division, although his force did service by  occupying a large number of the enemy, who would otherwise have been  free to act against the main column.    Between the 24th and 26th General Newdigate's and Wood's columns  advanced but six miles.  But Buller with his horse scouted ahead, and  cut up a number of Zulus who were engaged in burning the grass, to  hinder the advance of the horses and cattle.  On the 26th Colonel  Drury-Lowe, with the light cavalry, 450 of Buller's men and two guns,  went out and attacked and burnt five large military kraals.  On the 27th  the column advanced five miles towards Ulundi, leaving their tents  behind them, and taking only 200 ammunition-waggons and ten days'  rations; 500 infantry were left to guard the stores.

[Sidenote: Unsaddling]    Every hour or so loosen the cinches of your saddle horse and raise the  saddle and blankets an inch or so to permit a current of air to pass  through. Steaming makes the back tender. When you unsaddle him or the  pack animals, if they are very hot, leave the blankets across them for a  few moments. A hot sun shining on a sweaty back causes small pimples,  which may develop into sores. It is better to bathe with cold water the  backs of green horses; but such a trouble is not necessary after they  are hardened.    [Sidenote: To Pick Up a Horse's Feet]    Two more things I will mention, though strictly speaking, they do not  fall in the province of equipment. When you pick up a horse's hind foot,  face to the rear, put the hand nearest the horse firmly against his  flank, and use the other to raise the hoof. Then if he tries to kick,  you can hold him off sufficiently to get out of the way. Indeed the  very force of his movement toward you will thrust against the hand on  his flank and tend to throw you to one side.    [Sidenote: To Mount a Bad Horse]    If you are called upon to mount a bad horse, seize the check piece of  his bridle in your left hand and twist his head sharply toward you. At  the same time grasp the pommel in your right hand, thrust your foot in  the stirrup and swing aboard. Never get on any western horse as an  easterner mounts--left hand on pommel and right hand on cantle. If a  horse plunges forward to buck while you are in this position, you will  inevitably land back of the saddle. Then he has a fine leverage to throw  you about forty feet. A bad pack horse you can handle by blindfolding.  Anchor things for a storm, take off the bandage, and stand one side.          CHAPTER XII    CANOES      I SUPPOSE I have paddled about every sort of craft in use, and have  found good qualities in all. Now that I am called upon to pick out one  of them and label it as the best, even for a specific purpose, I must  confess myself puzzled as to a choice. Perhaps the best way would be to  describe the different sorts of canoe in common use, detail their  advantages, tell what I consider the best of each kind, and leave the  choice to your own taste or the circumstances in which you may find  yourself.    [Sidenote: Kinds of Canoes]    Practicable canoes are made of birch bark stretched over light frames;  of cedar; of basswood; of canvas, and of canvas cover over stiff frames.    [Sidenote: The Birch Bark]    [Sidenote: Advantages and Disadvantages]    The birch bark canoe has several unassailable advantages. It is light;  it carries a greater weight in proportion to its length than any other;  it is very easily mended. On the other hand it is not nearly so fast as  a wooden canoe of sweeter lines; does not bear transportation so well;  is more easily punctured; and does not handle so readily in a heavy  wind. These advantages and disadvantages, as you can see, balance  against one another. If it tends to veer in a heavy wind more than the  wooden canoe, it is lighter on portage. If more fragile, it is very  easily mended. If it is not quite so fast, it carries more duffle.  Altogether, it is a very satisfactory all-around craft in which I have  paddled many hundreds of miles, and with which I have never been  seriously dissatisfied. If I were to repeat some long explorations in  the absolute wilds of Canada I should choose a birch canoe, if only for  the reason that no matter how badly I might smash it, the materials are  always at hand for repairs. A strip of bark from the nearest birch tree;  a wad of gum from the next spruce; some spruce roots; a little lard and  a knife will mend a canoe stove in utterly.    [Sidenote: Selection of a Birch Bark]    In selecting a birch bark canoe the most important thing to look after  is to see that the bottom is all one piece without projecting knots or  mended cracks. Many canoes have bottoms made of two pieces. These when  grounded almost invariably spring a leak at the seam, for the simple  reason that it takes very little to scrape off the slightly projecting  gum. On the other hand, a bottom of one good piece of bark will stand an  extraordinary amount of raking and bumping without being any the worse.  If in addition you can get hold of one made of the winter cut of bark,  the outside shell will be as good as possible. Try to purchase a new  canoe. Should this be impossible, look well to the _watap_, or roots,  used in the sewing, that they are not frayed or burst. The frames should  lie so close together as fairly to touch. Such a canoe, \"two fathoms,\"  will carry two men and four hundred pounds besides. It will weigh about  fifty to seventy pounds, and should cost new from six to eight dollars.    [Illustration: Getting ready for another day of it]    [Sidenote: Cedar and Basswood]    A wooden canoe, of some sort, is perhaps better for all smooth and  open-water sailing, and all short trips nearer home. It will stand a  great deal of jamming about, but is very difficult to mend if ever you  do punch a hole in it. You will need to buy a longer craft than when  getting a birch. The latter will run from twelve to fourteen feet. A  wood canoe of that length would float gunwhale awash at half you would  wish to carry. Seventeen or eighteen feet is small enough for two men,  although I have cruised in smaller. Cedar is the lighter material--and  the more expensive--but splits too readily. Basswood is heavier, but is  cheaper and tougher.    [Sidenote: The Folding Canvas]    The folding canvas boat is an abomination. It is useful only as a craft  from which to fish in an inaccessible spot. Sooner or later it sags and  gives, and so becomes logy.    [Sidenote: Canvas Covered]    A canoe is made, however, and much used by the Hudson's Bay Company,  exactly on the frame of a birch bark, but covered with tightly stretched  and painted canvas. It is a first-rate craft, combining an approach  to the lightness of the birch bark with the sweeter lines of the wooden  canoe. All ordinary small tears in its bottom are easily patched by the  gum method. Its only inferiority to the birch rests in the facts that it  is more easily torn; that a major accident, such as the smashing of an  entire bow, cannot be as readily mended; and that it will not carry  quite so great a weight. All in all, however, it is a good and  serviceable canoe.    [Sidenote: Portaging]    In portaging, I have always had pretty good luck with the primitive  Indian fashion--the two paddles lengthwise across the thwarts and  resting on the shoulders, with perhaps a sweater or other padding to  relieve the pressure. It is possible, however, to buy cushions which  just fit, and on which you can kneel while paddling, and also a regular  harness to distribute the weight. I should think they might be very  good, and would certainly be no trouble to carry. Only that makes one  more thing to look after, and the job can perfectly well be done  without.    [Sidenote: Paddles]    The Indian paddle is a very long and very narrow blade, just as long as  the height of its wielder. For use in swift and somewhat shallow water,  where often the paddle must be thrust violently against the bottom or a  rock, this form is undoubtedly the best. In more open, or smoother  water, however, the broader and shorter blade is better, though even in  the latter case it is well to select one of medium length. Otherwise you  will find yourself, in a heavy sea, sometimes reaching rather  frantically down toward the water. Whatever its length, attach it to the  thwart nearest you by a light strong line. Then if you should go  overboard you will retain control of your craft. I once swam over a mile  before I was able to overtake a light canoe carried forward by a lively  wind.    [Sidenote: Setting Poles]    On any trip wherein you may have to work your way back against the  current, you must carry an iron \"shoe\" to fit on a setting pole. Any  blacksmith can make you one. Have it constructed with nail holes. Then  when you want a setting pole, you can cut one in the woods, and nail to  it your iron shoe.    [Sidenote: Knapsacks]    The harness for packs is varied enough, but the principle remains  simple. A light pack will hang well enough from the shoulders, but when  any weight is to be negotiated you must call into play the powerful  muscles lying along the neck. Therefore, in general, an ordinary  knapsack will answer very well for packs up to say thirty pounds. Get  the straps broad and soft; see that they are both sewed and riveted.    [Illustration: _Tumplines._]    [Sidenote: Tumplines]    [Sidenote: How to Carry Packs]    When, however, your pack mounts to above thirty pounds you will need  some sort of strap to pass across the top of your head. This is known as  a tumpline, and consists of a band of leather to cross the head, and two  long thongs to secure the pack. The blanket or similar cloth is spread,  the thongs laid lengthwise about a foot from either edge, and the  blanket folded inward and across the thongs. The things to be carried  are laid on the end of the blanket toward the head piece. The other end  of the blanket, from the folds of which the ends of the thongs are  protruding, is then laid up over the pile. The ends of the thongs are  then pulled tight, tied together, and passed around the middle of the  pack. To carry this outfit with any degree of comfort, be sure to get it  low, fairly in the small of the back or even just above the hips. A  compact and heavy article, such as a sack of flour, is a much simpler  matter. The thongs are tied together at a suitable distance. One side of  the loop thus formed goes around your head, and the other around the  sack of flour. It will not slip.
