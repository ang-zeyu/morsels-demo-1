how empires crumbled, or were reared anew. When Wellesley and Loke  overthrew the Mahrattas, Skinner entered the British service, and it  appears from the book before us that he died in 1836 a knight of the  Bath.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Hitherto,\" says M. de Sainte Beuve, \"the real learning of women has  been found to be pretty much the property of their lovers;\" and he  ridicules the notion that even Mrs. Somerville has any scholarship that  would win the least distinction for a man. It may be so. We see,  however, that a Miss FANNY CORBAUX has lately communicated to the  Syro-Egyptian Society in London a very long and ambitious paper _On the  Raphaim and their connexion with Egyptian History_, in which she quotes  Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, &c., with astonishing liberality.           *       *       *       *       *    Carlyle's translation of the _Apprenticeship and Travels of Wilhelm  Meister_, has been issued in a very handsome edition, by Ticknor, Reed &  Fields, of Boston.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Macaulay has been passing the Winter and Spring in Italy.           *       *       *       *       *    The Late Mr. John Glanville Taylor, an Englishman, left in MS. a work  upon _The United States and Cuba_, which has just been published by  Bentley, and is announced for republication by Mr. Hart of Philadelphia.  Mr. Taylor was born in 1810, and when about twenty-one years of age he  left Liverpool for the United States, on a mining speculation. After  travelling a few months in this country, he was induced to go to Cuba to  examine a gold vein of which he thought something might be made. The  place in Cuba which was to be the scene of his operations, was the  neighborhood of Gibara, on the north-eastern side of the island, which  he reached by sailing from New-York to St. Jago de Cuba, and travelling  across the island forty-five leagues. The gold vein turned out a  wretched failure; and, after having been put to some disagreeable shifts  to maintain himself, Mr. Taylor resolved to settle as a planter in  Holguin--the district to which Gibara forms the port of entry. Returning  to the United States, he made the necessary arrangements; and in the  summer of 1843, was established on his _hacienda_, in partnership with  an American who had been long resident in that part of the island. In  this and the following year, however, the east of Cuba was visited by an  unprecedented drought; causing famine which, though it destroyed many  lives and ruined thousands of proprietors, attracted no more attention,  he says, in England, than was implied by \"a paragraph of three lines in  an English newspaper.\" The west of Cuba was at the same time devastated  by a tremendous hurricane, accompanied by floods; and, all his Cuban  prospects being thus blasted, the author was glad to return to New-York  in September, 1845, whence, after a short stay, he returned to England.  He did not long, however, remain in his native country, but left it for  Ceylon, where he died suddenly in January, of the present year. His  _United States and Cuba: Eight Years of Change and Travel_, was left in  MS., and within a few weeks has been printed. It is a work of much less  value than Mr. Kimball's _Cuba and the Cubans_, published in New-York  last year. Of that very careful and judicious performance Mr. Taylor  appears to have made considerable use in the preparation of his own, and  his agreement with Mr. Kimball may be inferred from the fact that,  though pointedly protesting that he does not advocate the annexation of  Cuba to the United States, he holds that \"worse things might  happen,\"--and indeed hints that sooner or later the event is inevitable.  Of _Cuba and the Cubans_, we take this opportunity to state that a new  and very much improved edition will soon be issued by Mr. Putnam.           *       *       *       *       *    Lady Emmeline Stuart Wortley has in the press of Bentley her _Travels in  the United States_. She passed about two years, we believe, in this  country. She has written several books, in verse and prose, but we never  heard that any body had read one of them.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Nile Notes_, by Mr. CURTIS, have been republished in London by  Bentley, and the book is as much approved by English as by American  critics. The _Daily News_ says:         \"The author is evidently a man of great talent.\"    Leigh Hunt, in his _Journal_, that--         \"It is brilliant book, full of thought and feeling.\"    The _Athenaeum_, that--         \"The author of _Nile Notes_, we may now add, is richly       poetical, humorous, eloquent, and glowing as the sun, whose       southern radiance seems to burn upon his page. An affluence of       fancy which never fails, a choice of language which chastens       splendor of expression by the use of simple idioms, a love for       the forms of art whether old or new, and a passionate enjoyment       of external nature such as belongs to the more poetic order of       minds--are the chief characteristics of this writer.\"    The _Literary Gazette_--         \"The genial and kindly spirit of this book, the humor and       vivacity of personal descriptions, redeemed by an exquisite       choice of expression from the least taint of the common or the       coarse; the occasional melody and music of the diction,       cadenced, as it were, by the very grace and tenderness of the       thought it clothes, or the images of beauty it evokes; the       broad, easy touches, revealing as at a glance the majestic and       tranquil features of the Eastern landscape, and the ultimate       feeling of all its accessories of form and hue; the varied       resources of learning, tradition, poetry, romance, with which       it is not encumbered but enriched, as a banquet table with       festal crowns and sparkling wines--all these, and many other       characteristics, to which our space forbids us to do justice,       render these 'Nile Notes' quite distinct from all former books       of Eastern travel, and worthy 'to occupy the intellect of the       thoughtful and the imagination of the lively.' Never did a       wanderer resign his whole being with more entire devotion to       the silence and the mystery that brood, like the shadow of the       ages, over that dead, dumb land. A veritable lotus-eater is our       American Howadji!'\"    And a dozen other London journals might be quoted to the same effect.  But critics disagree, as well as doctors, and the Boston _Puritan  Recorder_ comes down on the Howadji in the following exemplary manner:         \"This is a much-vaunted book, by a young American, but one in       which we take no pleasure. In the first place, it is written in       a most execrable style,--all affectation, and verbal wriggling       and twisting for the sake of originality. The veriest sophomore       ought to be \"rusticated\" for such conceited phrases as       \"beautiful budburstiness of bosom,\"--\"her twin eyes shone forth       liquidly lustrous\"--and innumerable expressions in the same       namby-pamby dialect. But dellacruscan folly is but a trifle       compared with the immoral tendency of the descriptions of the       _gahzeeyah_, or dancing girls of Egypt, and the luscious       comments on their polluted ways and manners. We thought the       Harpers had done publishing this indecent trash.\"           *       *       *       *       *    D. M. Moir, the \"Delta\" of _Blackwood's Magazine_, has just published in  Edinburgh, _Sketches of the Poetical Literature of the Past Half  Century_, in six Lectures, delivered at the Edinburgh Philosophical  Institution.           *       *       *       *       *    The Rev. Satan Montgomery, otherwise called _Robert_ Montgomery, is not  dead, as some have supposed, but is still making sermons and  verses--probably sermons and verses of equally bad quality; and we see  with some alarm that the Rivingtons advertise, as in preparation, a  complete edition of his _Poetical Works_ [we never saw any works by him  that were poetical] in one octavo volume, similar in size and appearance  to the octavo editions of Southey, Wordsworth, &c., &c., and including  the whole of the author's poems--_Satan_, _Woman_, _Hell_, and all the  rest,--in a revised form, with some original minor pieces, and a general  preface. We don't suppose he will take our counsel, yet we will venture  it, that he make use of Macaulay's reviewal of his poems, instead of any  \"general preface\" of his own.           *       *       *       *       *    Documentary History of New-York.--The forthcoming (third) volume of this  State contribution to our historical literature will well sustain the  reputation of its predecessors and of its zealous editor. Dr.  O'CALLAGHAN is an enthusiast in his zeal for lighting up \"the dark ages  of our history,\" as Verplanck called the Dutch period; and he has done  as much as any man living to rescue the fast perishing memorials of the  founders of the Empire State. It is fortunate for the State that his  industry and patient research are secured for the proper arrangement of  the Archives--too long neglected and subject to loss and mutilation. The  new volume has come to hand too late for any elaborate notice or review  of its contents; but a glance at the list of papers and illustrations  alone warrants the opinion we have expressed. We notice particularly the  account of Champlain's explorations in Northern New-York, &c., from 1609  to 1615--translated from the edition of 1632. The historical student  cannot fail to note the coincidence of discovery and exploration by the  Dutch and French; and the credit due to the \"Founder of New France;\" to  which we have alluded in the article on the Jesuit Relations. The  translations of the extracts from Wassenaar (1624, etc.), give an  interesting"]]]
