I write \"awfully\" advisedly, for the mercury in  them at sunset was 2 deg. below zero, the floors were plaster, slippery  with frozen moisture, the walls were partly wood, with great apertures  between the planks; where they were mud the blistered plaster was  fringed with icicles. Later the mercury sank to 12 deg., and before  morning to 16 deg. below zero, and the hot water froze in my basin before  I could use it!    We were to have started at eight, as there was no possible way of  dividing the nine hours' march, but when the time came the _katirgis_  said it was too cold to rope the loads, a little later that we could  only get half-way, and later that there was no accommodation for mules  half-way and that we must go the whole way! At nine the mercury was at  4 deg. below zero, and the slipperiness was fearful. The poor animals  could scarcely keep on their feet. We have crossed two high passes,  Nal Shikan (the Horse-Shoe breaking pass) and the Charzabar Pass, in  tremendous snow, riding nine hours, only dismounting to walk down one  hill. At the half-way hamlet I decided to go on, having still a  lingering prejudice against sharing a den with a quantity of human  beings, mules, asses, poultry, and dogs.    On one long ascent we encountered a \"blizzard,\" when the mercury was  only 3 deg. above zero. It was awful. The men covered their heads with  their _abbas_ and turned their backs to the wind. I got my heavy  mackintosh over everything, but in taking off three pairs of gloves  for one minute to button it the pain of my hand was literally  excruciating. At the summit the snow was four feet deep, and a number  of mules were down, but after getting over the crest of the Nal Shikan  Pass and into the Zobeideh valley it became better. But after every  descent there was another ascent to face till we reached the pass  above the Cheshmeh-i-Charzabar torrent, in a picturesque glen, with a  village and some primitive flour mills.    Below this height lies the vast and fertile plain of Mahidasht, one  expanse of snow, broken by mud villages looking like brown islands,  and the truncated cone of Goree, a seat of the ancient fire-worship.  In the centre of the plain is an immense caravanserai with some houses  about it. When this came into sight it was only five miles off, but we  were nearly three hours in reaching it! The view was wonderful. Every  speck on the vast plain was seen distinctly; then came a heavy snow  blink, above which hovered ghosts of snow mountains rising into a pale  green sky, a dead and lonely wilderness, looking as if all things  which lived and moved had long ago vanished from it. Those hours after  first sighting the village were very severe. It seemed to grow no  nearer. I was half-dead with the journey of twenty-two miles at a slow  foot's pace, and was aching and cramped from the intense cold, for as  twilight fell the mercury sank to 3 deg. below zero. The Indian servants,  I believe, suffered more than I did, and some of the _katirgis_ even  more than they.    At last by a pointed brick bridge we crossed the little river of  Mahidasht, and rode into the house of the headman, who is a sort of  steward of Abdul Rahim, our future host, the owner of many villages on  this plain. The house is of the better class of Kurdish houses, with a  broad passage, and a room on each side, at the end a great, low, dark  room, half living-room, half stable, which accommodates to-night some  of the mules, the muleteers, the servants, and the men of the family.  Beyond this again is a large stable, and below-ground, reached by a  sloping tunnel, is the sheep-fold. One room has neither door nor  window, mine has an outer and inner door, and a fire of live embers in  a hole in the floor.    The family in vacating the room have left their goods behind,--two  plank beds at one end heaped with carpets and felts, a sacking cradle  hanging from the roof, two clay jars five feet high for storing grain,  and in the _takchahs_, or recesses of the walls, _samovars_ or  tea-urns, pots, metal vases, cartridge belts, and odds and ends. Two  old guns, an old sword, and a coarse coloured print of the Russian  Imperial family are on the wall.    I was lifted from the mule to my bed, covered with all available  wraps, a pot of hot embers put by the bed, my hands and feet rubbed,  hot syrup coloured with tea produced in Russian glasses, and in two  hours I was able to move. The caravan, which we thought could not get  through the snow, came in three hours later, men and mules thoroughly  knocked up, and not till nine could we get a scanty dinner. It has  been a hard day all round. The _far[=a]shes_ in the kitchen are  cursing the English sahibs, who will travel in the winter, wishing our  fathers may be burned, etc., two of the muleteers have been howling  with pain for the last two hours, and I went into the kitchen to see  the poor fellows.    In a corner of the big room, among the rough trunks of trees which  support the sooty roof, the muleteers were lying in a heap in their  big-sleeved felt coats round a big fire, about another the servants  were cooking their food, the _far[=a]shes_ were lying round another,  and some of the house people about a fourth, and through smoke and  flame a background of mules and wolf-like dogs was dimly seen, a gleam  now and then falling into the dark stable beyond, where the jaded  baggage animals were lying in heaps.    Mahidasht is said to be one of the finest and most fertile plains in  Persia, seventy-two miles long by fifteen broad, and is irrigated  throughout by a small stream swarming with turtles. Its population,  scattered over it in small villages, is estimated--over-estimated  probably--at 4000. At a height of 5050 feet the winters are severe.  The snow is nearly three feet deep already, and more is impending.    The mercury in my room fell to 5 deg. below zero before midnight, but rose  for a gray cloudy day. The men and animals were so done up that we  could not start till nearly eleven. The march, though not more than  sixteen miles, was severe, owing to the deep snow and cold wind. Five  miles over the snowy billows of the Mahidasht plain, a long ascent, on  which the strong north wind was scarcely bearable, a succession of  steep and tiresome ridges, many \"difficulties\" in passing caravans,  and then a gradual descent down a long wide valley, opened upon the  high plateau, on which Kirmanshah, one of the most important cities in  Persia, is situated.    Trees, bare and gaunt, chiefly poplars, rising out of unsullied snow,  for two hours before we reached it, denoted the whereabouts of the  city, which after many disappointments bursts upon one suddenly. The  view from the hill above the town was the most glorious snow view I  ever saw. All around, rolled to a great height, smooth as the icing of  a cake, hills, billowy like the swell of the Pacific after a storm--an  ocean of snow; below them a plateau equally unsullied, on the east  side of which rises the magnificently precipitous Besitun range,  sublime in its wintry grandeur, while on the distant side of the  plateau pink peaks raised by an atmospheric illusion to a colossal  height hovered above the snow blink, and walled in the picture. Snow  was in the air, snow clouds were darkening over the Besitun range;  except for those pink peaks there were no atmospheric effects; the  white was very pallid, and the gray was very black; no illusions were  possible, the aspect was grim, desolate, and ominous, and even before  we reached the foot of the descent the huge peaks and rock masses of  Besitun were blotted out by swirls of snow.    Kirmanshah, approached from the south-west, added no elements of  picturesqueness to the effect. A ruinous wall much too large for the  shrunken city it encloses, parts of it lying in the moat, some ruinous  loopholed towers, lines of small domes denoting bazars below, a few  good-looking houses rising above the insignificant mass, gardens,  orchards, vineyards, and poplars stretching up the southerly hollow  behind, and gardens, now under frozen water, to the north, made up a  not very interesting contrast with the magnificence of nature.    We circled much of the ruinous wall on thin ice, turned in between  high walls and up an alley cumbered with snow, dismounted at a low  door, were received by a number of servants, and were conducted  through a frozen courtyard into a handsomely-carpeted room with divans  beside a blazing fire, a table in the centre covered with apples,  oranges, and sweetmeats, and the large Jubilee photograph of Queen  Victoria hanging over the fireplace.

FOOTNOTES:    [11] Another interest, however, is its connection with many of the  romantic legends still told of Khosroe Parviz and his beautiful queen,  complicated with love stories concerning the sculptor Farhad, to whom  the Persians attribute some of their most famous rock sculptures. One  of the most romantic of these legends is that Farhad loved Shirin, and  that Khosroe was aware of it, and promised to give her to him if he  could execute the impossible task of bringing to the city the abundant  waters of the mountains. Farhad set himself to the Herculean labour,  and to the horror of the king nearly accomplished it, when Khosroe,  dreading the advancing necessity of losing Shirin or being  dishonoured, sent to inform him of her death. Being at the time on the  top of a precipice, urging on the work of the aqueduct, the news  filled him with such ungovernable despair that he threw himself down  and was killed.

It is not customary now  to rejoice at the graves of women or old men, unless the latter have  been distinguished warriors.    So far as I can learn, even in the case of the deaths of fighting men,  when the _chapi_ is danced at the grave, the women keep up the  ordinary ceremonial of mourning, which is very striking. They howl and  wail, beating their breasts rhythmically, keeping time with their  feet, tearing their hair and gashing their faces with sharp flints,  cutting off also their long locks and trampling upon them with piteous  cries. This last bitter token of mourning is confined to the deaths of  a husband and a first-born son, and the locks so ruthlessly treated  are afterwards attached to the tombstone.    Mourning for a husband, child, or parent lasts a year, and the  anniversary of the death is kept with the same ceremonies which marked  the beginning of the period of mourning. In the case of a great man  who has died fighting, the women of his tribe wail and beat their  breasts on this anniversary for many subsequent years.    Nothing is buried with the corpse, and nothing is placed on the grave,  but it is the universal custom to put a stone at the head of the body,  which is always buried facing Mecca-wards. To this position they  attach great importance, and they covet my compass because it would  enable them at any point to find the position of the Kiblah. A comb or  distaff rudely carved on a woman's headstone, and the implements of  war or hunting on that of a man, are common, and few burial-places are  without one or more of the uncouth stone lions to which frequent  reference has been made.    The graveyards are very numerous, and are usually on small elevations  by the roadside, so that passers-by, if they be Hadjis, may pray for  the repose of the soul. It must be understood that prayer consists in  the repetition of certain formulas in Arabic, which very few if any  of these people understand.[9]    As to the great matter of their religion, on which I have taken  infinite trouble to gain information, I can come to no satisfactory  conclusion. I think that they have very little, and that what they  have consists in a fusion of some of the tenets of Islam with a few  relics of a nature worship, not less rude than that of the Ainos of  Yezo and other aboriginal tribes.    They are Shiahs, that is, they hate the Sunnis, and though the belief  in Persia that they compel any one entering their country to swear  eternal hatred to Omar is not absolutely correct, this hate is an  essential part of their religion. They hold the unity of God, and that  Mohammed was His prophet; but practically, though they are not Ali  Ilahis, they place Ali on as high a pedestal as Mohammed. They are  utterly lax in observing the precepts of the Koran, even prayer at the  canonical hours is very rarely practised, and then chiefly by Seyyids  and Hadjis. It has been said that the women are devout, but I think  that this is a mistake. Many of them have said to me, \"Women have no  religion, for women won't live again.\"    Those of the Khans who can read, and who have made pilgrimages to  Mecca, such as the Hadji Ilkhani, Khaja Taimur, and Mirab Khan,  observe the times of prayer and read the Koran, and when they are so  engaged they allow of no interruption, but these are remarkable  exceptions.    Pilgrimages and visits to _imamzadas_ are lightly undertaken, either  for the accumulation of merit, or to wash away the few misdeeds which  they regard as sin, or in the hope of gaining an advantage over an  enemy.    They regard certain stones, trees, hill-tops, and springs as \"sacred,\"  but it is difficult to define the very vague ideas which they attach  to them. I am inclined to think that they look on them as the abodes  of genii, always malignant, and requiring to be propitiated. In  passing such places they use a formula equivalent to \"May God avert  evil,\" and it is common, as in Nubra and Ladak, to hang pieces of rag  on such trees and stones as offerings to the _genius loci_.    They regard certain places as possibly haunted by spirits, always  evil, and never those of the departed; but this can scarcely be termed  a belief, as it is lightly held, and quite uninfluential, except in  preventing them from passing such places alone in the darkness.    The opinions concerning God represent Him chiefly as a personification  of a fate, to which they must bow, and as a Judge, to whom, in some  mysterious way, they must account after death. Earthly justice appears  to them as a commodity to be bought and sold, as among the Persians,  or as it is among themselves, as severity solely, without a sentiment  of mercy; and I have asked them often if they think that anything will  be able to affect the judgment of the Judge of all, in case it should  go against them. Usually they reply in the negative, but a few say  that Ali, the Lieutenant of God, will ask for mercy for them, and that  he will not be refused.    Of God as a moral being I think they have little conception, and less  of the Creator as an object of love. Of holiness as an attribute of  God they have no idea. Their ejaculation, \"God is good,\" has really no  meaning. Charity, under the term \"goodness,\" they attribute to God.  But they have no notion of moral requirements on the part of the  Creator, or of sin as the breaking of any laws which He has laid down.  They concern themselves about the requirements of religion in this  life and about the future of the soul as little as is possible, and  they narrow salvation within the limits of the Shiah sect.    After Mohammed and Ali they speak of Moses, Abraham, and Jesus as  \"Prophets,\" but of Moses as a lawgiver, and of Jesus as aught else but  a healer, they seem quite ignorant.    And so they pass away, generation after generation, ignorant of the  Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man, of the love to God and  man which is alone the fulfilling of the law, and of the light which  He, who is the resurrection and the life, has shed upon the destiny of  the human spirit.    Generally I find them quite willing to talk on these subjects; but one  man said contemptuously, \"What has a _Kafir_ to do with God?\" The  women know nothing, and, except among the sons of the leading Khans,  there is no instruction in the Koran given to the children. If I have  interpreted their views correctly they must be among the most ignorant  of the races bound by the faith of Islam.    _Khuramabad, August 6._--Leaving the camp on Parwez, and skirting the  gravelly slopes on the north side of its ridge, a sudden dip over the  crest took us among great cliffs of conglomerate, with steep gravelly  slopes below, much covered with oaks growing out of scorched soil.  Grooves, slides, broken ledges, and shelving faces of rock have to be  descended. One part is awfully bad, and every available man and some  passing Bakhtiaris (who wanted to be paid in advance for their  services) went back to help the animals. The _charvadars_ shouted and  yelled, and the horses and some of the mules were taken by their heads  and tails, but though nearly every man had a fall, horses, asses,  mules, and a sheep which follows _Hak[=i]m_ got over that part safely.  It was a fine sight, thirty animals coming down, what looked from  below, a precipice, led by Hadji leading Cock o' the Walk, shaking his  tasselled head, and as full of pride and fire as usual, and the mules  looking wisely, choosing their way, and leaping dexterously upon and  among the rocks. It is not a route for laden animals, but personally,  as I had two men to help me, I did not find it so risky or severe as  the descent of the Gokun Pass.    Below these conglomerate precipices are steep and dangerous zigzags,  which I was obliged to ride down, and there we were not so fortunate,  for Hadji's big saddle-mule slipped, and being unable to recover  herself fell over the edge some hundred feet and was killed  instantaneously.    The descent of the southern face of Parwez, abrupt and dangerous most  of the way, is over 4300 feet. The track proceeds down the Holiwar  valley, brightened by a river of clear green water, descending from  Lake Irene. Having forded this, we camped on its left bank on a  gravelly platform at the edge of the oak woods which clothe the lower  spurs of the grand Kuh-i-Haft-Kuh, with a magnificent view of the gray  battlemented precipices of Parwez. The valley is beautiful, and acres  of withered flowers suggested what its brief spring loveliness must  be, but its altitude is only 5150 feet, and the mercury in the shade  was 104 deg., the radiation from the rock and gravel terrible, and the  sand-flies made rest impossible. At midnight the mercury stood at 90 deg.  There were no Bakhtiaris, but two or three patches of scorched-up  wheat, not worth cutting, evidenced their occasional presence. Among  these perished crops, revelling in blazing soil and air like the  breath of a furnace, grew the blue _centaurea_ and the scarlet poppy,  the world-wide attendants upon grain; and where other things were  burned, the familiar rose-coloured \"sweet william,\" a white-fringed  _dianthus_, and a gigantic yellow mullein audaciously braved the heat.    No one slept that night because of the sand-flies and the need for  keeping a vigilant watch. Indeed, the tents were packed shortly after  sunset, and in a hot dawn we ascended to a considerable height above  the valley, and then for many miles followed a stream in a wooded  glen, where willows, planes, vines, rank grass, and a handsome yellow  pea grew luxuriantly, looped together continually by the fragile  _Clematis orientalis_. All that country would be pretty had it  moisture and \"atmosphere.\" The hillsides are covered with oaks and the  _Paliurus aculeatus_ on their lower slopes, rising out of withered  flowers. All else is uncut sun-cured hay, and its pale uniform buff  "]]]
