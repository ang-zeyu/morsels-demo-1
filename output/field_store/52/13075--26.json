The digestive track is the principal seat of the disease, but  of course its presence is most easily recognised at those parts which are  most exposed to view. Thus the membrane of the eye, being a comparatively  large surface, and by its delicacy well calculated to denote every  variation of the system, is usually the first observed, and often the only  place inspected. If this be cloudy or watery, the nature of the malady is  at once concluded; the membrane of the nose also, though less palpable, is  under observation; and if its secretion be copious and opaque, the fact is  generally imagined to be established. The alterations, however, exhibited  by these membranes are no more than sympathetic derangements, they being  continuous with the more important organs; and when proofs are found in  the eyes or nose, the disorder is generally confirmed, or has taken hold  of the system. Some have supposed the disease originated in the nose, and  thence extended to other parts; now I shall not stop here to consider so  groundless an hypothesis. It essentially is fever affecting the entire of  the mucous surfaces, but especially those of the alimentary canal.    The causes cannot be well ascertained. Contagion has been by the majority  of writers supposed to be its principal source, but I cannot say my  experience has corroborated that opinion. My own little cur never had the  distemper, and yet she lived where the disease was scarcely ever absent.  Animals virulently affected were daily brought to me, and not a few were  left in my charge. From these she was not kept separate; they were her  acquaintances and companions; she played with them, and often by choice  shared their beds; and nevertheless she died without exhibiting the  disease. I do not generally put those dogs by themselves which are  affected with distemper; yet I cannot bring to mind the instance of an  animal while under my care having caught the disorder. I doubt whether  there is any justice in the general opinion. It would be hard to prove the  prevailing notion was a prejudice, yet there can be no doubt that it is  much more insisted upon than it deserves to be.    With regard to other causes, I know of none. I have not been able to  observe that any circumstance can induce the disease, though at particular  ages the animals are predisposed to its exhibition.    During the latter period of dentition--that is, when the second set of  incisors are well up, and the permanent tusks are about half-grown, the  temporary ones being still retained--is the time when pups are most  disposed to display this disorder. I cannot state the precise age, because  mouths are not regular in their appearances even as to mouths; but the  aspect of the teeth will sufficiently mark the period when an individual  may be expected to be attacked. The season certainly, in no little degree,  influences the disease. In winter it is not usually seen; in the spring it  is more common; in summer is rare, but less so than in winter. During the  autumn, however, especially if much rain should fall, it is very frequent,  and always more prevalent than at any other periods. Spring and autumn,  therefore, are the times when it is to be looked for, but in the latter it  is to be anticipated.    When treating of a subject like the present, there would seem to be a  disposition to string together a number of words which do duty for  information. Cold, wet, bad food, foul air, excessive exertion, fear, &c.,  are grouped together, and put forth for almost every \"ill that flesh is  heir to;\" but I have to learn that these accepted terms have any connexion  with the development of this disorder. Dogs that are starved, neglected,  and cruelly tortured--animals that are judiciously fed, properly housed,  and sensibly treated--as well as favorites that are crammed, nursed, and  humored--all equally are its victims; and those which are most cared for  fall most frequently, while those which are least prized more generally  survive. If, therefore, privation or exposure be of any importance, the  facts seem to infer their tendencies are either to check or mitigate the  attack.    Exercise and food, however, do influence the complaint. The dog that is  free suffers much less severely than the one that is confined. The animal  that never tastes flesh has a much lighter attack than the one which  subsists entirely upon meat. This last fact I have often proved. When the  distemper has made its appearance, the opportunity for changing the diet  has passed away. We have, then, only a choice of dangers. To remove the  flesh to which the animal is accustomed is to cause it to pine and to  weaken the strength, at a time when vigor is of every importance; whereas  to continue the meat is mostly certain death; in this position I generally  take away the flesh, for by so doing I give the patient a chance of  recovery; and however desperate that chance may be, nevertheless it is to  be much preferred to no chance at all.    The symptoms in the very early stage are not well marked or by any means  distinguished for their regularity. They may assume almost any form;  dulness and loss of appetite, purging, or vomiting, are very frequently  the first indications. The more than usual moisture of the eyes, and a  short cough, are often the earliest signs that attract attention. In the  bitch a desire for copulation, with a disinclination to accept the dog,  is to be regarded with suspicion; as is also a display of peevishness and  a wish to be undisturbed in full-grown animals. These things denote no  more than the derangement of the system; but if, conjoined with them, the  inner surface of the lower eyelid should appear to be more red than usual,  and the pulse should be increased in number without being materially  altered in character--ranging from one hundred and twenty to one hundred  and thirty in puppies, and in dogs from one hundred and ten to one hundred  and twenty-five--the probability of distemper making its appearance is the  greater, though even then by no means certain.    The period of the year, however, will also have to be taken into  consideration; and inquiry should always be made whether any animals in  the immediate neighborhood are known to have exhibited the disorder;  because the disease is then proved to be in the locality. At this stage  the practitioner is always more or less in the dark; and therefore he  contents himself with such measures as he concludes are adapted to the  symptoms, and waits for further instructions which nature will speedily  develope.    When the disease is established, the animal is sensitive to cold. It seeks  warmth, and is constantly shivering; when taken hold of, it is felt to  tremble violently, so much so that the pulse cannot be accurately counted.  The bowels are generally constipated. A thick purulent discharge flows  from the eyes; and the white around the eye, if the upper lid be  retracted, will be seen covered with numerous small and bright red  vessels, giving to the part the appearance of acute inflammation. The  vessels now spoken of are not to be confounded with the veins which are  natural to this organ. These last are large, and of a purple hue, while  their course is in the direction of the circumference of the cornea. The  small vessels, indicative of distemper, are fine, bright in color, and  their course is towards the centre, or in a line directly the opposite to  that indicated by the veins. They are never present during health, though  they are often to be witnessed in other diseases besides that which is  here treated of. A glairy mucus, or yellow fluid, moistens the nostrils,  and if the ear be applied to the head, the breathing will be discovered to  be accompanied with an unusual sound. The cough is often severe and  frequent; it is sometimes spasmodic--the fits being almost convulsive, and  terminating with the ejection of a small quantity of yellow frothy liquid,  which is thrown off by the stomach. The digestion is always impaired, and  sickness is not unusual; the matter vomited having an offensive smell, and  never being again consumed by the animal, as is generally the case when  the creature is in health. The nose is dry and harsh; the coat staring and  devoid of gloss: the skin hotter than is customary, and the paws warm. The  pulse is perhaps quicker by twenty beats than during the prior stage, but  less full--the artery feeling sharp, short, and thin under the finger.    When the symptoms described are apparent, the distemper is easily  recognised, but it is not likely to continue stationary for any long  period. In the course of a week it generally changes its character, and  sometimes appears to subside altogether; the cases in which the disease  steadily progresses, becoming day by day more severe, being comparatively  rare.    When no abatement is witnessed, the case is not to be despaired of, but it  requires to be anxiously watched; for often it will take a sudden turn,  sometimes favorable, but more frequently demanding immediate assistance to  prevent a fatal termination. The symptoms become aggravated. The eyes are  clogged by a thick matter which glues the lids together, especially in the  morning. The nostrils are plugged up by an accumulation of tenacious  discharge, which becomes encrusted over the lips and nose, and impedes the  breathing. The body rapidly wastes, though the appetite may return, and  even be voracious. The shivering is constant. The dog seeks repose and is  disinclined to move; though at times it may be playful, and in some  instances will never exhibit any diminution of spirit. The cough may  continue; but it more often ceases, or is only heard at irregular and  distant intervals. The animal makes repeated and desperate efforts to  expel the accumulated matter from the nose, and uses its paws evidently  with an intention to"]]]
