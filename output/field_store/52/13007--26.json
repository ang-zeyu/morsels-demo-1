The pleasures of the senses are confined within narrow limits, and  can neither be much increased nor too often repeated, without being  destructive of themselves; thus we are admonished by nature, that our  constitutions were not formed to bear the continual pleasures of  sense; for the too free use of any of them, is not only destructive  of itself, but induces those painful and languid sensations so often  complained of by the voluptuary, and which not unfrequently produce a  state of mind that prompts to suicide.    As the transition from pleasure to pain is natural, so the remission  of pain, particularly if it is great, becomes a source of pleasure.  There is much truth, therefore, in the beautiful allegory of  Socrates, who tells us, that Pleasure and Pain were sisters, who,  however, met with a very different reception by mankind on their visit  to the earth; the former being universally courted, while the latter  was carefully avoided: on this account, Pain petitioned Jupiter, who  decreed that they should not be parted; and that whoever embraced the  one, obtained also the other.    There is a great diversity with respect to the duration of the  pleasures of the different senses: some of the senses become soon  fatigued, and lose the power of distinguishing accurately their  different objects: others, on the contrary, remain perfect a long  time. Thus smell and taste are soon satiated; hearing more slowly;  while, of all the external senses, the objects of sight please us the  longest. We may, however, prolong the pleasures of sense by varying  them properly, and by a proper mixture of objects or circumstances  which are indifferent, and afford less delight. But the very  constitution of our nature limits our enjoyments, and points out the  impossibility of perpetual pleasures in this state of our existence.  To a person who is thirsty, water is delicious nectar; to one who is  hungry, every kind of food is agreeable, and even its smell pleasant;  to a person who is hot and feverish, the cool air is highly  refreshing. But to the same persons in different circumstances, the  same things are not only indifferent, but even disgusting; for  instance, a person cannot bear the sight or smell of food, after  having satiated himself with it, and perpetual feasting will cloy the  appetite of the keenest epicure.    I shall conclude this account of the general laws of sensation, by a  short recapitulation of those laws.    And, in the first place, it may be observed, that the energy or force  of any sensation, is proportioned to the degree of attention given by  the mind to the external object which causes it.    Secondly, A repetition of sensations diminishes their energy, and at  last nearly destroys it; but this energy is restored by rest, or the  absence of these sensations.    Thirdly, The mind cannot attend to two impressions at the same time:  so that two sensations never act with the same force at the same  instant; the stronger generally overcoming the weaker. The mind,  however, can attend to the weaker sensation, in such a manner, as to  overpower the stronger, or to render it insensible.    Having fully considered the general laws of sensation, I shall now  proceed to examine those proper to each sense; and in this  examination, two objects will engage our attention. 1. The structure  of the organ which receives and transmits the impulse to the mind. 2.  The qualities or properties of external bodies, particularly those by  which they are fitted to excite sensation.    The first sense that we shall examine is touch, which, of all the  external senses, is the most simple, as well as the most generally  diffused. By means of this sense, we are capable of perceiving  various qualities and properties of bodies, such as hardness,  softness, roughness, smoothness, temperature, magnitude, figure,  distance, pressure, and weight; this sense is seldom depraved;  because the bodies, whose properties are examined by it, are applied  immediately to the extremities of the nerves, without the  intervention of any medium liable to be deranged, as is the case with  the eye, and ear.    The organ of touch is seated chiefly in the skin, but different parts  of this covering possess different degrees of sensibility. The skin  consists of three parts. 1. The cutis vera, or true skin, which  covers the greatest part of the surface of the body. When the skin is  examined by a microscope, we find it composed of an infinite number  of papillae, or small eminencies, which seem to be the extremities of  nerves, each of which is accompanied by an artery and a vein, so that  when the vessels of the skin are injected, the whole appears red. 2.  Immediately over the true skin, and filling up its various  inequalities, lies a mucous reticulated substance, which has been  called by Malpighi, who first described it, rete mucosum. The real  skin is white in the inhabitants of every climate; but the rete  mucosum is of various colours, being white in Europeans, olive in  Asiatics, black in Africans, and copper coloured in Americans. This  variety depends chiefly on the degree of light and heat; for, if we  were to take a globe, and paint a portion of it with the colour of  the inhabitants of corresponding latitudes, we should have an uniform  gradation of shade, deepening from the pole to the equator.    The diversity of colour depends upon the bleaching power of the  oxygen, which, in temperate climates, combines more completely with  the carbonaceous matter deposited in the rete mucosum; while, in  hotter climates, the oxygen is kept in a gaseous state by the heat  and light, and has less tendency to unite with the carbonaceous  matter. In proof of this, the skins of Africans may be rendered white  by exposure to the oxygneated muriatic acid.    Over the rete mucosum is spread a fine transparent membrane, called  the cuticle, or scarf skin, which defends the organ of feeling from  the action of the air, and other things which would irritate it too  powerfully. In some parts of the body this membrane is very thick, as  in the soles of the feet, and palms of the hands; and this thickness  is much increased by use and pressure.    In general, the thinner the cuticle is, the more acute is the sense  of touch. This sense is very acute and delicate about the ends of the  fingers, where we have the most need of it; but in the lips, mouth,  and tongue, it is still more delicate; a galvanic or electrical shock  being felt by the tongue, when it is impossible for us to perceive it  by the fingers.    This sense, like the others, becomes more exquisite when its organ is  defended from the action of external bodies; it is on this account  that the cuticle becomes so sensible under the end of the nail, which  defends it from the action of external objects; and when part of the  nail is taken away, we can scarcely bear to touch any thing with this  newly exposed part of the skin.    When we place our fingers upon the surface of any body, the first  sensation we experience is that of resistance, after which the other  properties are perceived in a natural order; such as heat or cold,  moisture or dryness, motion or rest, distance, and figure or shape.    With respect to the diseases of this sense, it is very seldom that it  becomes too acute over the whole body; though it frequently does so  in particular parts, which may arise from the cuticle being too thin  or abraded, or from an inflamed state of the part.    It however becomes sometimes obtuse, and indeed almost abolished over  the whole body; and this takes place from compression of the brain,  and various affections of the nervous power. This diminution is  called anaesthesia. The touch becomes deficient, and indeed almost  abolished, when the cuticle is injured by the frequent application of  hot bodies, or acrid substances: thus the cuticle of the hands of  blacksmiths and glassblowers is generally so hard and horny, that  they can take up and grasp in their hand pieces of redhot iron with  impunity.    We generally refer pain to this sense, though it may arise from too  violent an impression made upon any of the organs of sense.    Pain is an unpleasant sensation, which the mind refers to some part  of the body, and very accurately, if any part of the surface is  affected, but less so, if it arises from the affection of an internal  part. The sensation of pain may arise from any thing which tends to  injure the structure of the body, whether that be internal or  external; so that it serves as a monitor to put us on our guard, and  to induce us to remove any thing which might be injurious to us. This  sensation is produced by any thing which punctures, cuts, tears,  distends, compresses, bruises, corrodes, burns, or violently  stimulates any part of the body.    A moderate degree of pain in any part excites the action of the whole  body; a greater quantity of blood and nervous energy is determined to  the part. A still greater degree of pain brings on inflammation and  its consequences, and if it be intense, it will bring on fever,  convulsions, delirium, fainting, and even death.    The endurance of pain depends much on the strength of mind possessed  by the patient, which, in some instances, is such, that the most  violent pains are patiently endured; while in other instances, the  slightest can scarcely be born.    It is a curious circumstance, that a moderate degree of pain, when  unaccompanied by fever, often tends to render the understanding more  clear, lively, and active. This is confirmed by the experience of  people labouring under gout. We have an account of a man who  possessed very ordinary powers of understanding, but who exhibited  the strongest marks of intelligence and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27778"],[0,"Outlines of Dairy Bacteriology, 8th edition (#19)"],[1,"able to entirely destroy all life, is of course  excluded, except when milk is preserved for analytical purposes; but a  number of milder substances are more or less extensively employed,  although the statutes of practically all states forbid their use.    The substances so used may be grouped in two classes:    1. Those that unite chemically with certain by-products of bacterial  growth to form inert substances. Thus bicarbonate of soda neutralizes  the acid in souring milk, although it does not destroy the lactic acid  bacteria.    2. Those that act directly upon the bacteria in milk, restraining or  inhibiting their development. The substances most frequently utilized  are salicylic acid, formaldehyde and boracic acid. These are nearly  always sold to the milk handler, under some proprietary name, at prices  greatly in excess of what the crude chemicals could be bought for in the  open market. Formaldehyde has been widely advertised of late, but its  use is fraught with the greatest danger, for it practically renders  insoluble all albuminous matter and its toxic effect is greatly  increased in larger doses.    These substances are generally used by milk handlers who know nothing of  their poisonous action, and although it may be possible for adults to  withstand their use in dilute form, without serious results, yet their  addition to general milk supplies that may be used by children is  little short of criminal. The sale of these preparations for use in milk  finds its only outlet with those dairymen who are anxious to escape the  exactions that must be met by all who attempt to handle milk in the best  possible manner. Farrington has suggested a simple means for the  detection of preservalin (boracic acid).[128] When this substance is  added to fresh milk, it increases the acidity of milk without affecting  its taste. As normal milk tastes sour when it contains about 0.3 per  cent lactic acid, a milk that tests as much or more than this without  tasting sour has been probably treated with this antiseptic agent.    ~Physical methods of preservation.~ Methods based upon the application of  physical forces are less likely to injure the nutritive value of milk,  and are consequently more effective, if of any value whatever. A number  of methods have been tried more or less thoroughly in an experimental  way that have not yet been reduced to a practical basis, as electricity,  use of a vacuum, and increased pressure.[129] Condensation has long been  used with great success, but in this process the nature of the milk is  materially changed. The keeping quality in condensed milk often depends  upon the action of another principle, viz., the inhibition of bacterial  growth by reason of the concentration of the medium. This condition is  reached either by adding sugar and so increasing the soluble solids, or  by driving off the water by evaporation, preferably in a vacuum pan.  Temperature changes are, however, of the most value in preserving milk,  for by a variation in temperature all bacterial growth can be brought to  a standstill, and under proper conditions thoroughly destroyed.    ~Use of low temperatures.~ The effect of chilling or rapid cooling on the  keeping quality of milk is well known. When the temperature of milk is  lowered to the neighborhood of 45 deg. F., the development of bacterial  life is so slow as to materially increase the period that milk remains  sweet. Within recent years, attempts have been made to preserve milk so  that it could be shipped long distances by freezing the product, which  in the form of milk-ice could be held for an indefinite period without  change.[130] A modification of this process known as Casse's system has  been in use more or less extensively in Copenhagen and in several places  in Germany. This consists of adding a small block of milk-ice (frozen  milk) to large cans of milk (one part to about fifty of milk) which may  or may not be pasteurized.[131] This reduces the temperature so that the  milk remains sweet considerably longer. Such a process might permit of  the shipment of milk for long distances with safety but as a matter of  fact, the system has not met with especial favor.    [Illustration: FIG. 22. Microscopic appearance of normal milk showing  the fat-globules aggregated in clusters.]    ~Use of high temperatures.~ Heat has long been used as a preserving agent.  Milk has been scalded or cooked to keep it from time immemorial. Heat  may be used at different temperatures, and when so applied exerts a  varying effect, depending upon temperature employed. All methods of  preservation by heat rest, however, upon the application of the heat  under the following conditions:    1. A temperature above the maximum growing-point (105 deg.-115 deg. F.)  and below the thermal death-point (130 deg.-140 deg. F.) will prevent  further growth, and consequently fermentative action.    2. A temperature above the thermal death-point destroys bacteria, and  thereby stops all changes. This temperature varies, however, with the  condition of the bacteria, and for spores is much higher than for  vegetative forms.    Attempts have been made to employ the first principle in shipping milk  by rail, viz., prolonged heating above growing temperature, but when  milk is so heated, its physical appearance is changed.[132] The methods  of heating most satisfactorily used are known as sterilization and  pasteurization, in which a degree of temperature is used approximating  the boiling and scalding points respectively.    [Illustration: FIG. 23. Microscopic appearance of milk heated above 140  deg. F., showing the homogeneous distribution of fat-globules. The  physical change noted in comparison with Fig. 22 causes the diminished  consistency of pasteurized cream.]    ~Effect of heat on milk.~ When milk is subjected to the action of heat, a  number of changes in its physical and chemical properties are to be  noted.    _1. Diminished \"body.\"_ When milk, but more especially cream, is heated  to 140 deg. F. or above, it becomes thinner in consistency or \"body,\" a  condition which is due to a change in the grouping of the fat globules.  In normal milk, the butter fat for the most part is massed in  microscopic clots as (Fig. 22). When exposed to 140 deg. F. or above for  ten minutes these fat-globule clots break down, and the globules become  homogeneously distributed (Fig. 23). A _momentary_ exposure to heat as  high as 158 deg.-160 deg. may be made without serious effect on the cream  lime; but above this the cream rises so poorly and slowly that it gives  the impression of thinner milk.    _2. Cooked Taste._ If milk is heated for some minutes to 160 deg. F., it  acquires a cooked taste that becomes more pronounced as the temperature  is further raised. Milk so heated develops on its surface a pellicle or  \"skin.\" The cause of this change in taste is not well known. Usually it  has been explained as being produced by changes in the nitrogenous  elements in the milk, particularly in the albumen. Thoerner[133] has  pointed out the coincidence that exists between the appearance of a  cooked taste and the loss of certain gases that are expelled by heating.  He finds that the milk heated in closed vessels from which the gas  cannot escape has a much less pronounced cooked flavor than if heated in  an open vessel. The so-called \"skin\" on the surface of heated milk is  not formed when the milk is heated in a tightly-closed receptacle. By  some[134] it is asserted that this layer is composed of albumen, but  there is evidence to show that it is modified casein due to the rapid  evaporation of the milk serum at the surface of the milk.    _3. Digestibility._ Considerable difference of opinion has existed in  the minds of medical men as to the relative digestibility of raw and  heated milks. A considerable amount of experimental work has been done  by making artificial digestion experiments with enzyms, also digestion  experiments with animals, and in a few cases with children. The results  obtained by different investigators are quite contradictory, although  the preponderance of evidence seems to be in favor of the view that  heating does impair the digestibility of milk, especially if the  temperature attains the sterilizing point.[135] It has been observed  that there is a noteworthy increase in amount of rickets,[136] scurvy  and marasmus in children where highly-heated milks are employed. These  objections do not obtain with reference to milk heated to moderate  temperatures, as in pasteurization, although even this lower temperature  lessens slightly its digestibility. The successful use of pasteurized  milks in children's hospitals is evidence of its usefulness.    _4. Fermentative changes._ The normal souring change in milk is due to  the predominance of the lactic acid bacteria, but as these organisms as  a class do not possess spores, they are readily killed when heated above  the thermal death-point of the developing cell. The destruction of the  lactic forms leaves the spore-bearing types possessors of the field, and  consequently the fermentative changes in heated milk are not those that  usually occur, but are characterized by the curdling of the milk from  the action of rennet enzyms.    _5. Action of rennet._ Heating milk causes the soluble lime salts to be  precipitated, and as the curdling of milk by rennet (in cheese-making)  is dependent upon the presence of these salts, their absence in heated  milks greatly retards the action of rennet. This renders it difficult to  utilize heated milks in cheese-making unless the soluble lime salts are  restored, which can be done by adding solutions of calcium chlorid.    ~Sterilization.~ As ordinarily used in dairying, sterilization means the  application of heat at temperatures approximating, if not exceeding,  212 deg. F. It does not necessarily imply that milk so treated is sterile,  i. e., germ-free; for, on account of the"]]]
