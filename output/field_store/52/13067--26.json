Whatever may be thought of the  policy of this momentous document--securing as it did to the native race  the full possession of their lands and properties under the British  flag--it is a standing witness to the influence of the missionaries, and  to the trust which the Maoris had come to place in their integrity and  benevolence of purpose.    The one place where the treaty was opposed was the new English  settlement of Wellington, where the settlers stigmatised it as \"a device  to amuse the savages,\" and proceeded to set up a rival government of  their own. Henry Williams went once more therefore to Port Nicholson,  and succeeded in getting the treaty signed by the chiefs of that place.  Thus supported, Hobson now felt himself strong enough to proclaim the  Queen's sovereignty over the country, and himself became its first  Governor. He had no military force to depend upon, and he ruled the  country through the missionaries. His tenure of office was embittered by  the constant opposition of the Company at Wellington, as well as by the  difficulties natural to such a position; and he was harassed into his  grave within two years of his arrival. But this period may be looked  upon as the climax of missionary influence in New Zealand. After 1842,  mission work went on extending, but the old workers no longer occupied  the forefront of the stage.    Before they retire into the background to make room for other figures,  it will be well therefore to cast a glance over their work and its  methods, their characters and their example. The position which they  held was in many ways unique, and though their age lies not so far  behind us in point of time, it really belongs to an order of things  quite different from our own.    The first point of contrast with our present somewhat overgoverned  society is the absence of authority. The missionaries and settlers were  sent out to a wild country to do the best they could. The bishops of the  Church in England did not claim, nor believe that they possessed, any  jurisdiction over them. The direction of the mission lay with the  Committee of the C.M.S., but unless it sent out a sentence of dismissal,  what could such a distant body do? If it sent out instructions to New  Zealand, no answer could be expected for a whole year, during which time  circumstances might have altogether changed. Short of actual dismissal,  its power of discipline was but slight. Much of its power must of  necessity be delegated to Marsden in Australia, but Marsden's authority  was limited in the same way, though not quite to the same extent. He  could not visit the mission often, nor could he secure that his  instructions should be obeyed. As a matter of fact they were often not  obeyed. \"I know nothing I can say will have any influence upon their  minds,\" he once wrote in despair; \"they have followed their own way too  long, and despise all the orders that have been given them by their  superiors.\" This censure applied to certain individuals among the first  settlers, and when one reads the letters and journals of these same men,  one cannot help feeling some sympathy with them in their position.  Possibly Marsden, with his exceptional powers, expected rather much of  average human nature. But the point is that the position of an early  missionary was an independent one. There was no civil government at all,  and the instructions from ecclesiastical superiors were necessarily  infrequent, often lacking in knowledge, never quite up to date, and  backed by no compelling force except the threat of \"disconnection\" from  the Society.    Under such circumstances everything depended on the personalities of the  men themselves. Those who came before 1823 were on the whole  disappointing. Marsden frequently compared them to the twelve spies who  all failed, excepting Caleb and Joshua. Unfortunately he never lets us  know who his \"Caleb\" and his \"Joshua\" were. But one of them can hardly  have been other than the young schoolmaster, Francis Hall, whose letters  reveal a singularly earnest and beautiful spirit. Even he, however,  admits the demoralising influence of the surrounding paganism--an  influence which none wholly escaped, and before which some actually  succumbed. \"I feel in myself,\" quaintly writes another, \"a great want of  that spirituality of mind which New Zealand is so very unfavourable for;  because of the continual scenes of evil that there is before our eyes,  and for want of Christian society. So that you must excuse my barrenness  of writing, and give me all the Christian advice you can.\"    The most interesting personality among these first settlers was Kendall.  Wayward and erring, passionate and ungovernable as he was, a close study  of his letters shows a depth of sin and penitence, together with a  breadth and boldness of philosophical speculation, which fascinates the  reader. Alone among the missionaries he seems to have tried to approach  the Maori from his own side, and to enter the inmost recesses of his  thought: \"I am now, after a long, anxious, and painful study, arriving  at the very foundation and groundwork of the Cannibalism and  Superstitions of these Islanders. All their notions are metaphysical,  and I have been so poisoned with the apparent sublimity of their ideas,  that I have been almost completely turned from a Christian to a  heathen.\" Like the ancient Gnostics, Kendall tried to combine  Christianity with a sublimated version of pagan superstitions; and if  moral restrictions stood in the way, he cast them aside. \"I was  reduced,\" he says, \"to a state so dreadful that I had given myself  entirely up, and was utterly regardless of what would become both of  body and soul.\"    The details of his strange career cannot, of course, be given here. He  has been represented as an utter hypocrite, and evidence is not wanting  to give colour to the charge. But another and more favourable view is  not only possible: it is forced upon anyone who studies his  self-revelation through his letters. He seems to have hoped that his  ordination would have given him moral strength and stability, but he had  to admit that he had never been so strongly tempted to sin, so unable to  resist it, or so ingloriously foiled, as since his return from England.  Marsden's sharp exercise of discipline, though it elicited outbursts of  passion, seems to have had a healing effect. \"Blessed be God,\" he  writes, \"who has certainly undertaken for me. His sharp rebuke has laid  me low; yet why should I repine, since He has inclined me to seek His  face again?\" Upon his expulsion from the mission, he retired to a house  he had built at \"Pater Noster Valley,\" and after a few months left the  country. His great services in reducing the Maori language to written  form have hardly been sufficiently recognised. Marsden, like the other  settlers, could never adapt himself to the Italian vowel sounds, and at  his request Kendall wrote out a new vocabulary on a different system;  but he soon found it unsatisfactory, and returned to the principles  which he had worked out with Professor Lee. For the rest of his life--in  South America and in Australia--he still tried to perfect his Maori  Grammar. But the tragedy of his life outweighs the value of his  philological efforts. If ever a New Zealand Goethe should arise, he may  find the materials for his Faust in the history of Thomas Kendall.    From the date of the new beginning of the mission in 1823, its agents  were, for the most part, men of a superior type. Yate, indeed, one of  the ablest amongst them, was accused on a charge of which he never  could, or perhaps _would_, clear himself. He was accordingly  \"disconnected\" by the Society, but a certain doubt hangs over the issue;  and his after life was spent in useful and honourable service as  chaplain to the seamen at Dover. The rest of the new workers did  excellent service for the mission, and most of them lived to an old age  in the country. Remarkable for their linguistic capacity stand out  William Williams, who translated the New Testament; and Robert Maunsell,  who followed with the Old. This remarkable man took all possible pains  to gather the correct idioms for his task--sometimes by engaging the  Maoris in argument, sometimes by watching them at their sports. The  passion for accuracy was strong in him to extreme old age, and even on  his death-bed he interrupted the ministrations of his parish priest with  the startling question, \"Don't you know that that is a mistranslation?\"    Apart from translation work, the missionaries had little inclination or  ability for literary pursuits. Some of them (e.g., W. Williams, Yate,  and Colenso) took an interest in the plants and animals of their adopted  country, but for the most part the missionary was a man of one book, and  that book was the Bible. Life was too serious a thing to allow of  attention to the literary graces. The place where his lot was cast was  in a special sense the realm of Satan. The evidences of demonic activity  lay all around. On the one hand were the sickening scenes of slaughter  and cannibalism; on the other were the evil lives of sailors and traders  of his own race. Now and then the great Enemy would draw nearer still,  and one of his own comrades would fall a prey. His own religion was of a  somewhat austere type. His calendar was unmarked by fast or festival; he  had few opportunities of participating in a joyous Eucharist; there was  no colour in his raupo chapel, nor variety in his manner of worship.    The home life of the missionary doubtless often presented a picture of  domestic happiness. But there were no luxuries. If he wished to vary the  daily routine of pork and potatoes, he must try to obtain some fish  or native game.

In view of these principles, let us examine a little more closely the  doctrine of those who maintain that the law of Missouri is not to  govern the status and condition of the plaintiff. They insist that the  removal and temporary residence with his master in Illinois, where  slavery is inhibited, had the effect to set him free, and that the  same effect is to be given to the law of Illinois, within the State of  Missouri, after his return. Why was he set free in Illinois? Because  the law of Missouri, under which he was held as a slave, had no  operation by its own force extra-territorially; and the State of  Illinois refused to recognise its effect within her limits, upon  principles of comity, as a state of slavery was inconsistent with her  laws, and contrary to her policy. But, how is the case different on  the return of the plaintiff to the State of Missouri? Is she bound to  recognise and enforce the law of Illinois? For, unless she is, the  status and condition of the slave upon his return remains the same as  originally existed. Has the law of Illinois any greater force within  the jurisdiction of Missouri, than the laws of the latter within that  of the former? Certainly not. They stand upon an equal footing.  Neither has any force extra-territorially, except what may be  voluntarily conceded to them.    It has been supposed, by the counsel for the plaintiff, that a rule  laid down by Huberus had some bearing upon this question. Huberus  observes that \"personal qualities, impressed by the laws of any place,  surround and accompany the person wherever he goes, with this effect:  that in every place he enjoys and is subject to the same law which  other persons of his class elsewhere enjoy or are subject to.\" (De  Confl. Leg., lib. 1, tit. 3, sec. 12; 4 Dallas, 375 n.; 1 Story Con.  Laws, pp. 59, 60.)    The application sought to be given to the rule was this: that as Dred  Scott was free while residing in the State of Illinois, by the laws of  that State, on his return to the State of Missouri he carried with him  the personal qualities of freedom, and that the same effect must be  given to his status there as in the former State. But the difficulty  in the case is in the total misapplication of the rule.    These personal qualities, to which Huberus refers, are those impressed  upon the individual by the law of the domicil; it is this that the  author claims should be permitted to accompany the person into  whatever country he might go, and should supersede the law of the  place where he had taken up a temporary residence.    Now, as the domicil of Scott was in the State of Missouri, where he  was a slave, and from whence he was taken by his master into Illinois  for a temporary residence, according to the doctrine of Huberus, the  law of his domicil would have accompanied him, and during his  residence there he would remain in the same condition as in the State  of Missouri. In order to have given effect to the rule, as claimed in  the argument, it should have been first shown that a domicil had been  acquired in the free State, which cannot be pretended upon the agreed  facts in the case. But the true answer to the doctrine of Huberus is,  that the rule, in any aspect in which it may be viewed, has no bearing  upon either side of the question before us, even if conceded to the  extent laid down by the author; for he admits that foreign Governments  give effect to these laws of the domicil no further than they are  consistent with their own laws, and not prejudicial to their own  subjects; in other words, their force and effect depend upon the law  of comity of the foreign Government. We should add, also, that this  general rule of Huberus, referred to, has not been admitted in the  practice of nations, nor is it sanctioned by the most approved jurists  of international law. (Story Con., sec. 91, 96, 103, 104; 2 Kent.  Com., p. 457, 458; 1 Burge Con. Laws, pp. 12, 127.)    We come now to the decision of this court in the case of Strader et  al. _v._ Graham, (10 How., p. 2.) The case came up from the Court of  Appeals, in the State of Kentucky. The question in the case was,  whether certain slaves of Graham, a resident of Kentucky, who had been  employed temporarily at several places in the State of Ohio, with  their master's consent, and had returned to Kentucky into his service,  had thereby become entitled to their freedom. The Court of Appeals  held that they had not. The case was brought to this court under the  twenty-fifth section of the judiciary act. This court held that it had  no jurisdiction, for the reason, the question was one that belonged  exclusively to the State of Kentucky. The Chief Justice, in delivering  the opinion of the court, observed that \"every State has an undoubted  right to determine the status or domestic and social condition of the  persons domiciled within its territory, except in so far as the powers  of the States in this respect are restrained, or duties and  obligations imposed upon them, by the Constitution of the United  States. There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States, he  observes, that can in any degree control the law of Kentucky upon this  subject. And the condition of the negroes, therefore, as to freedom or  slavery, after their return, depended altogether upon the laws of that  State, and could not be influenced by the laws of Ohio. It was  exclusively in the power of Kentucky to determine, for herself,  whether their employment in another State should or should not make  them free on their return.\"    It has been supposed, in the argument on the part of the plaintiff,  that the eighth section of the act of Congress passed March 6, 1820,  (3 St. at Large, p. 544,) which prohibited slavery north of thirty-six  degrees thirty minutes, within which the plaintiff and his wife  temporarily resided at Fort Snelling, possessed some superior virtue  and effect, extra-territorially, and within the State of Missouri,  beyond that of the laws of Illinois, or those of Ohio in the case of  Strader et al. _v._ Graham. A similar ground was taken and urged upon  the court in the case just mentioned, under the ordinance of 1787,  which was enacted during the time of the Confederation, and re-enacted  by Congress after the adoption of the Constitution, with some  amendments adapting it to the new Government. (1 St. at Large, p. 50.)    In answer to this ground, the Chief Justice, in delivering the opinion  of the court, observed: \"The argument assumes that the six articles  which that ordinance declares to be perpetual, are still in force in  the States since formed within the territory, and admitted into the  Union. If this proposition could be maintained, it would not alter the  question; for the regulations of Congress, under the old Confederation  or the present Constitution, for the government of a particular  Territory, could have no force beyond its limits. It certainly could  not restrict the power of the States, within their respective  territories, nor in any manner interfere with their laws and  institutions, nor give this court control over them.    \"The ordinance in question, he observes, if still in force, could have  no more operation than the laws of Ohio in the State of Kentucky, and  could not influence the decision upon the rights of the master or the  slaves in that State.\"    This view, thus authoritatively declared, furnishes a conclusive  answer to the distinction attempted to be set up between the  extra-territorial effect of a State law and the act of Congress in  question.    It must be admitted that Congress possesses no power to regulate or  abolish slavery within the States; and that, if this act had attempted  any such legislation, it would have been a nullity. And yet the  argument here, if there be any force in it, leads to the result, that  effect may be given to such legislation; for it is only by giving the  act of Congress operation within the State of Missouri, that it can  have any effect upon the question between the parties. Having no such  effect directly, it will be difficult to maintain, upon any consistent  reasoning, that it can be made to operate indirectly upon the subject.    The argument, we think, in any aspect in which it may be viewed, is  utterly destitute of support upon any principles of constitutional  law, as, according to that, Congress has no power whatever over the  subject of slavery within the State; and is also subversive of the  established doctrine of international jurisprudence, as, according to  that, it is an axiom that the laws of one Government have no force  within the limits of another, or extra-territorially, except from the  consent of the latter.    It is perhaps not unfit to notice, in this connection, that many of  the most eminent statesmen and jurists of the country entertain the  opinion that this provision of the act of Congress, even within the  territory to which it relates, was not authorized by any power under  the Constitution. The doctrine here contended for, not only upholds  its validity in the territory, but claims for it effect beyond and  within the limits of a sovereign State--an effect, as insisted, that  displaces the laws of the State, and substitutes its own provisions in  their place.    The consequences of any such construction are apparent. If Congress  possesses the power, under the Constitution, to abolish slavery in a  Territory, it must necessarily possess the like power to establish it.  It cannot be a one-sided power, as may suit the convenience or  particular views of the advocates. It is a power, if it exists at all,  over the whole subject; and then, upon the process of reasoning which  seeks to extend its influence beyond the Territory, and within the  limits of a State, if Congress should establish, instead of abolish,  slavery, we do"]]]
