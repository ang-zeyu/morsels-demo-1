REMARKABLE VARIATIONS OF.    The breeds of the pig have recently been more closely studied, though much  still remains to be done, than those of almost any other domesticated  animal. This has been effected by Hermann von Nathusius in two admirable  works, especially in the later one on the Skulls of the several races, and  by Rutimeyer in his celebrated Fauna of the ancient Swiss lake-dwellings.  (3/1. Hermann von Nathusius 'Die Racen des Schweines' Berlin 1860; and  'Vorstudien fur Geschichte' etc. 'Schweineschadel' Berlin 1864. Rutimeyer  'Die Fauna der Pfahlbauten' Basel 1861.) Nathusius has shown that all the  known breeds may be divided into two great groups: one resembling in all  important respects and no doubt descended from the common wild boar; so  that this may be called the Sus scrofa group. The other group differs in  several important and constant osteological characters; its wild parent-  form is unknown; the name given to it by Nathusius, according to the law of  priority, is Sus indicus, of Pallas. This name must now be followed, though  an unfortunate one, as the wild aboriginal does not inhabit India, and the  best-known domesticated breeds have been imported from Siam and China.    First for the Sus scrofa breeds, or those resembling the common wild boar.  These still exist, according to Nathusius ('Schweineschadel' s. 75), in  various parts of central and northern Europe; formerly every kingdom (3/2.  Nathusius 'Die Racen des Schweines' Berlin 1860. An excellent appendix is  given with references to published and trustworthy drawings of the breeds  of each country), and almost every province in Britain, possessed its own  native breed; but these are now everywhere rapidly disappearing, being  replaced by improved breeds crossed with the S. indicus form. The skull in  the breeds of the S. scrofa type resembles, in all important respects, that  of the European wild boar; but it has become ('Schweineschadel' s. 63-68)  higher and broader relatively to its length; and the hinder part is more  upright. The differences, however, are all variable in degree. The breeds  which thus resemble S. scrofa in their essential skull characters differ  conspicuously from each other in other respects, as in the length of the  ears and legs, curvature of the ribs, colour, hairiness, size and  proportions of the body.    The wild Sus scrofa has a wide range, namely, Europe, North Africa, as  identified by osteological characters by Rutimeyer, and Hindostan, as  similarly identified by Nathusius. But the wild boars inhabiting these  several countries differ so much from each other in external characters,  that they have been ranked by some naturalists as specifically distinct.  Even within Hindostan these animals, according to Mr. Blyth, form very  distinct races in the different districts; in the N. Western provinces, as  I am informed by the Rev. R. Everest, the boar never exceeds 36 inches in  height, whilst in Bengal one has been measured 44 inches in height. In  Europe, Northern Africa, and Hindostan, domestic pigs have been known to  cross with the wild native species (3/3. For Europe see Bechstein  'Naturgesch. Deutschlands' 1801 b. 1 s. 505. Several accounts have been  published on the fertility of the offspring from wild and tame swine. See  Burdach 'Physiology' and Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 1 page 370. For Africa  'Bull. de la Soc. d'Acclimat.' tome 4 page 389. For India see Nathusius  'Schweineschadel' s. 148.); and in Hindostan an accurate observer (3/4. Sir  W. Elliot Catalogue of Mammalia 'Madras Journal of Lit. and Science' volume  10 page 219.), Sir Walter Elliot, after describing the differences between  wild Indian and wild German boars, remarks that \"the same differences are  perceptible in the domesticated individuals of the two countries.\" We may  therefore conclude that the breeds of the Sus scrofa type are descended  from, or have been modified by crossing with, forms which may be ranked as  geographical races, but which, according to some naturalists, ought to be  ranked as distinct species.    Pigs of the Sus indicus type are best known to Englishmen under the form of  the Chinese breed. The skull of S. indicus, as described by Nathusius,  differs from that of S. scrofa in several minor respects, as in its greater  breadth and in some details in the teeth; but chiefly in the shortness of  the lachrymal bones, in the greater width of the fore part of the palate-  bones, and in the divergence of the premolar teeth. It deserves especial  notice that these latter characters are not gained, even in the least  degree, by the domesticated forms of S. scrofa. After reading the remarks  and descriptions given by Nathusius, it seems to me to be merely playing  with words to doubt whether S. indicus ought to be ranked as a species; for  the above-specified differences are more strongly marked than any that can  be pointed out between, for instance, the fox and the wolf, or the ass and  the horse. As already stated, S. indicus is not known in a wild state; but  its domesticated forms, according to Nathusius, come near to S. vittatus of  Java and some allied species. A pig found wild in the Aru islands  ('Schweineschadel' s. 169) is apparently identical with S. indicus; but it  is doubtful whether this is a truly native animal. The domesticated breeds  of China, Cochin-China, and Siam belong to this type. The Roman or  Neapolitan breed, the Andalusian, the Hungarian, and the \"Krause\" swine of  Nathusius, inhabiting south-eastern Europe and Turkey, and having fine  curly hair, and the small Swiss \"Bundtnerschwein\" of Rutimeyer, all agree  in their more important skull-characters with S. indicus, and, as is  supposed, have all been largely crossed with this form. Pigs of this type  have existed during a long period on the shores of the Mediterranean, for a  figure ('Schweineschadel' s. 142) closely resembling the existing  Neapolitan pig was found in the buried city of Herculaneum.    Rutimeyer has made the remarkable discovery that there lived  contemporaneously in Switzerland, during the Neolithic period, two  domesticated forms, the S. scrofa, and the S. scrofa palustris or  Torfschwein. Rutimeyer perceived that the latter approached the Eastern  breeds, and, according to Nathusius, it certainly belongs to the S. indicus  group; but Rutimeyer has subsequently shown that it differs in some well-  marked characters. This author was formerly convinced that his Torfschwein  existed as a wild animal during the first part of the Stone period, and was  domesticated during a later part of the same period. (3/5. 'Pfahlbauten' s.  163 et passim.) Nathusius, whilst he fully admits the curious fact first  observed by Rutimeyer, that the bones of domesticated and wild animals can  be distinguished by their different aspect, yet, from special difficulties  in the case of the bones of the pig ('Schweineschadel' s. 147), is not  convinced of the truth of the above conclusion; and Rutimeyer himself seems  now to feel some doubt. Other naturalists have also argued strongly on the  same side as Nathusius. (3/6. See J.W. Schutz' interesting essay 'Zur  Kenntniss des Torfschweins' 1868. This author believes that the Torfschwein  is descended from a distinct species, the S. sennariensis of Central  Africa.)    Several breeds, differing in the proportions of the body, in the length of  the ears, in the nature of the hair, in colour, etc., come under the S.  indicus type. Nor is this surprising, considering how ancient the  domestication of this form has been both in Europe and in China. In this  latter country the date is believed by an eminent Chinese scholar (3/7.  Stan. Julien quoted by de Blainville 'Osteographie' page 163.) to go back  at least 4900 years from the present time. This same scholar alludes to the  existence of many local varieties of the pig in China; and at the present  time the Chinese take extraordinary pains in feeding and tending their  pigs, not even allowing them to walk from place to place. (3/8. Richardson  'Pigs, their Origin' etc. page 26.) Hence these pigs, as Nathusius has  remarked (3/9. 'Die Racen des Schweines' s. 47, 64.), display in an eminent  degree the characters of a highly-cultivated race, and hence, no doubt,  their high value in the improvement of our European breeds. Nathusius makes  a remarkable statement ('Schweineschadel' s. 138), that the infusion of the  1/32nd, or even of the 1/64th, part of the blood of S. indicus into a breed  of S. scrofa, is sufficient plainly to modify the skull of the latter  species. This singular fact may perhaps be accounted for by several of the  chief distinctive characters of S. indicus, such as the shortness of the  lachrymal bones, etc., being common to several species of the genus; for in  crosses characters which are common to many species apparently tend to be  prepotent over those appertaining to only a few species.    (FIGURE 2. HEAD OF JAPAN OR MASKED PIG. (Copied from Mr. Bartlett's paper  in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1861 page 263.))    The Japan pig (S. pliciceps of Gray), which was formerly exhibited in the  Zoological Gardens, has an extraordinary appearance from its short head,  broad forehead and nose, great fleshy ears, and deeply furrowed skin.  Figure 2 is copied from that given by Mr. Bartlett. (3/10. 'Proc. Zoolog.  Soc.' 1861 page 263.) Not only is the face furrowed, but thick folds of  skin, which are harder than the other parts, almost like the plates on the  Indian rhinoceros, hang about the shoulders and rump. It is coloured black,  with white feet, and breeds true. That it has long been domesticated there  can be little doubt; and this might have been inferred even from the fact  that its young are not longitudinally striped; for this is a character  common to all the species included within the genus Sus and the allied  genera whilst in their natural state.

Both girls started. \"What's that?\" More knocking! \"Gracious heaven! I  am nearly dead with fear,\" Martha whispered, looking stealthily about.  Nancy pointed to the window.    \"Look----\" Martha looked.    \"Tristram--Sir Tristram!\" she whispered excitedly. \"Open the window. I  can't move, I am so scared. Now, he'll rave--and I can't resent it. We  deserve anything he may say.\" Nancy opened the window, and Sir  Tristram stepped in softly, upon receiving a caution from the girls.    \"Lady Harriet, this is most monstrous.\"    \"Oh, my soul! Don't we know it. Don't wake the farmers up, in heaven's  name! Things are bad enough without making them worse.\"    \"Yes, let us fly, and make as little row about it as we can,\" Nancy  implored.    \"Then come--no words. I have my carriage waiting; follow me quickly  and say good-bye to this hovel.\"    \"Hovel?\" Lady Harriet looked about. Suddenly she had a feeling of  regret. \"Hovel?\"    \"Nay,\" Nancy interrupted. \"To this peaceful house--good-bye.\" Nancy,  too, had a regret. They had had a gleeful hour here, among frank and  kindly folk, even if they had also been a bit frightened. Anything  that had gone wrong with them had been their fault. Tristram placed a  bench at the window that the ladies might climb over, and thus they  got out, and immediately the sound of their carriage wheels was heard  in the yard. Plunkett had waked up meantime and had come out to call  the girls. It was time for their day's work to begin. Farmer folk are  out of bed early.    \"Ho, girls!--time to be up,\" he called, entering from his chamber.  Then he saw the open window. He paused. \"Do I hear carriage  wheels--and the window open--and the bench--and the girls--gone! Ho  there! Everybody!\" he rushed out and furiously pulled the bell which  hung from the pole outside. His farmhands come running. \"Ho--those  girls hired yesterday have gone. Get after them. Bring them back. I  may drop dead the next instant, but I'll be bound they shan't treat us  in this manner. After them! Back they shall come!\" And in the midst of  all this confusion in ran Lionel.    \"What----\"    \"Thieves!--the girls have run off--a nice return for our affections!\"    \"After them!--don't lose a minute,\" Lionel then cried in his turn, and  away rushed the farmhands.    \"They are ours for one year, by law. Bring them back, or ye shall  suffer for it. Be off!\" And the men mounted horses and went after the  runaways like the wind.    \"Nice treatment!\"    \"Shameful!\" Plunkett cried, dropping into a chair, nearly fainting  with rage.      ACT III    Plunkett's men had hunted far and wide for the runaways, but without  success. The farmer was still sore over his defeat: he felt himself  not only defrauded, but he had grown to love Nancy, and altogether he  became very unhappy. One day he was sitting with his fellow farmers  around a table in a little forest inn, drinking his glass of beer,  when he heard the sound of hunting horns in the distance.    \"Hello! a hunting party from the palace must be out,\" he remarked, but  the music of the horn which once pleased him could no longer arouse  him from his moodiness. Nevertheless an extraordinary thing was about  to happen. As he went into the inn for a moment, into the grove  whirled--Nancy! all bespangled in a rich hunting costume and  accompanied by her friends who were enjoying the hunt with her. They  were singing a rousing hunting chorus, but Martha--Lady Harriet--was  not with them.    \"What has happened to Lady Harriet?\" some one questioned of Nancy, who  was expected to know all her secrets.    \"Alas--nothing interests her ladyship any more,\" she replied! Nancy  knew perfectly well that, ever since their escapade, Harriet had  thought of nothing but Lionel. For Nancy's part, she had not thought  of much besides Plunkett; but she did not mean to reveal the  situation to the court busybodies. Then while the huntresses were  roaming about the inn, out came Plunkett! and Nancy, not perceiving at  first who he was, went up to him and began to speak.    \"Pray, my good man, can you tell--Good heaven!\" she exclaimed,  recognizing him; \"Plunkett!\"    \"Yes, madame, Plunkett; and now Plunkett will see if you get the  better of him a second time. We'll let the sheriff settle this matter,  right on the spot.\"    \"Man, you are mad. Do not breathe my name or each huntress here shall  take aim and bring you down. Ho, there!\" she cried distractedly to her  friends; and she took aim at Plunkett, while all of the others closed  round him. It was then Plunkett's turn to beg for mercy.    \"They're upon me, they've undone me!\" he cried. \"This is serious,\" and  so indeed it was. \"But oh, dear me, there is a remarkable charm in  these girls, even if they do threaten a man's life,\" and still looking  back over his shoulder, away he ran, pursued by the girls. They had no  sooner gone than Lionel came in. He was looking disconsolately at the  flowers to which Martha sang the \"Last Rose of Summer.\" He himself  sang a few measures of the song and then looked about him.    \"Ah,\" he sighed, thinking still of Martha:    [Music:         None so rare,       None so fair,       Yet enraptur'd mortal heart;       Maiden dear.       Past compare,       Oh, 'twas death from thee to part!       Ere I saw thy sweet face       On my heart there was no trace       Of that love from above,       That in sorrow now I prove;       but alas, thou art gone,       And in grief I mourn alone;       Life a shadow doth seem,       And my joy a fleeting dream,       A fleeting dream.       None so rare, etc.]    And after he had sung thus touchingly of Martha, he threw himself down  on the grass, and remained absorbed in his thoughts. But while he was  resting there, Lady Harriet and Sir Tristram had also wandered  thither. At first they did not see Lionel.    \"I have come here away from the others, in order to be alone,\" Harriet  declared impatiently.    \"Alone with me?\" Sir Tristram asked indiscreetly.    \"Good heaven--it doesn't matter in the least whether you are here or  elsewhere. I am quite unconscious of you, wherever you are,\" she  replied, not very graciously. \"Do go away and let me alone!\" and,  finding that he could not please her, Tristram wandered off, and left  her meditating there. After a while she began to sing to herself,  softly, and Lionel recognized the voice.    \"It is she!--Martha!\" he cried, starting up. Harriet recognized him,  and at once found herself in a dreadful state of mind.    \"What shall I do? It is Lionel! that farmer I hired out to!\" Well! It  was Lionel's opportunity, and he fell to making the most desperate  love to her--which she liked very much, but which, being a high-born  lady of Queen Anne's Court, she was bound to resent. She called him  base-born and a good many unpleasant things, which did not seem to  discourage him in the least, even though it made him feel rather  badly; but while he was still protesting his love, Tristram returned,  and at once believed Harriet to be in the toils of some dreadful  fellow. So he called loudly for everybody in the hunt to come to the  rescue--which was about the most foolish thing he could do. Then all  set upon Lionel. Plunkett, hearing the row, rushed in.    \"Stand by me!\" Lionel cried.    Nancy appeared. \"What does this mean?\" she in turn demanded in a  high-handed manner.    \"Julia, too,\" Lionel shouted, recognizing her.    \"Bind this madman in fetters,\" Tristram ordered.    \"Don't touch him,\" Plunkett threatened.    \"I shall die,\" Nancy declared.    \"I engaged these girls in my service,\" Lionel shouted, \"and now they  wish to break the bargain!\"    \"What?\" everybody screamed, staring at Nancy and Harriet. Tristram and  the hunters laughed, Tristram trying to shield the girls and turn it  into a joke.    \"Have compassion on this madman\"; Harriet pleaded wincing when she saw  Lionel bound and helpless. Lionel then reproached her. She knew  perfectly that she deserved it and felt her love for him growing  greater. Everybody was in a most dreadful state of mind. Then a page  rushed in and cried that Queen Anne was coming toward them, and  immediately Lionel had an inspiration.    \"Take this ring to her Majesty--quick,\" he cried, handing his ring to  Plunkett.    A litter was then brought for Lady Harriet. She, heartbroken, stepped  into it. Lionel was pinioned and was being dragged off. Plunkett held  up the ring, to assure him that it should straightway be taken to the  Queen.      ACT IV    After the row had quieted down and Nancy and Harriet got time to think  matters over, Harriet reached the conclusion that she could not endure  Lionel's misfortune. Hence she had got Nancy to accompany her to the  farmer's house. When they arrived some new maid whom the farmers had  got opened the door to them.    \"Go, Nancy, and find Plunkett, Lionel's trusty friend, and tell him I  am repentant and cannot endure Lionel's misfortunes. Tell him his  friend is to have hope,\" and, obeying her beloved Lady Harriet, Nancy  departed to find Plunkett and give the message. In a few minutes she  returned with the farmer. He now knew who the ladies were and treated  Harriet most respectfully.    \"Have you told him?\" Lady Harriet asked.    \"Yes, but we cannot make Lionel understand anything. He sits vacantly"]]]
