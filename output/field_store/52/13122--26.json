Buried  here in this prison, I wait till the end comes. I trust God has forgiven  me for Christ's sake. I have bitterly repented; I repent every day.

This was said with sobbings and tears  that were heart-breaking to hear.\"    \"There goes me but for the grace of God!\" \"What, is thy servant a dog,  that he should do this great thing?\" No! not a dog, but a young man or a  young woman who is liable to forget that \"small habits well pursued  betimes may reach the dignity of crimes.\" If you do not measure your  liquor with as much care as strong medicine; if you are not on your  guard against those drinking habits of society and business which first  draw, then drag, and then haul--beware lest tyrant custom make you a  slave to what has been called \"the most authentic incarnation of the  principle of evil.\"          CHAPTER XII.    FURNISHING.         \"By wisdom is a house built; by understanding it is established;       and by knowledge the chambers are filled with all pleasant and       precious treasures.\"--_Solomon's Practical Wisdom._         \"We cannot arrest sunsets nor carve mountains, but we may turn       every English home, if we choose, into a picture which shall be       no counterfeit, but the true and perfect image of life       indeed.\"--_Ruskin._      A condition of pleasantness in a house has a real power in refining and  raising the characters of its inmates; so home should not only be a  haven of rest, peace, and sympathy, but should have an element of beauty  in all its details. Ugliness and discomfort blunt the sensibilities and  lower the spirits. D'Israeli said, \"Happiness is atmosphere,\" and from  this point of view a few words about furnishing may not be out of place  in our inquiry as to how to be happy though married. Certainly the  fitting up and arranging of a home will not appear unimportant to those  who think with Dr. Johnson that it is by studying little things that we  attain the great art of having as little misery and as much happiness as  possible. \"Pound St. Paul's church into atoms and consider any single  atom; it is, to be sure, good for nothing; but put these atoms together,  and you have St. Paul's church. So it is with human felicity, which is  made up of many ingredients, each of which may be shown to be very  insignificant.\"    The expense of furnishing is often a source of considerable anxiety to  young people about to marry. We think, however, that this matrimonial  care is, or should be, much more lightly felt than in past years.  Competition has made furniture cheaper, and it is now considered \"bad  form\" to crowd rooms or to have in them the large heavy things that were  so expensive. Elegance displayed in little things is the order of the  day. A few light chairs of different sizes and shapes, a small lounge,  one or two little tables, the floor polished round the edges and covered  in the centre with a square of carpet, or, if the whole room be stained,  with Oriental rugs where required; the windows hung with some kind of  light drapery--what more do newly-married people require in their  drawing-room? Oh! we have forgotten the piano, and we suppose it is  inevitable, but it can easily be hired.    It is a great gain for a young couple to be compelled to economize, for,  rich as they may become afterwards, habits of thrift never quite leave  them. Their furniture may be scanty and some of it not very new, but  common things can be prettily covered, and the dullest of rooms is set  off by the knick-knacks that came in so plentifully among the bridal  spoils. Besides, if they start with everything they want, there is  nothing to wish for, and no pleasure in adding to their possessions.  George Eliot has a subtle remark about the \"best society, where no one  makes an invidious display of anything in particular, and the advantages  of the world are taken with that high-bred depreciation which follows  from being accustomed to them.\"    No doubt there will be pictures and photographs, the hanging of which  occasions considerable discussion, and perhaps involves the first  serious divergence of opinion. We must remember, however, that it is  much better to have no pictures than bad ones, and that photographs of  scenery are rarely decorative. As regards one's relations when they are  really decorative, even Mr. Oscar Wilde can see no reason why their  photographs should not be hung on the walls, though he hopes that, if  called on to make a stand between the principles of domestic affection  and decorative art, the latter may have the first place.    It is a safe rule to have nothing in our houses that we do not know to  be useful or think to be beautiful. We should show our love of art and  beauty in our surroundings, and bring it to bear in the selection of the  smallest household trifle. To have things tasteful and pretty costs no  more than to have them ugly; but it costs a great deal more trouble.  Simplicity, appropriateness, harmony of colour--these produce the best  results. When we enter a room, the first feeling ought to be, \"How  comfortable!\" and the second, as we glance quickly round to discover  _why_, ought to be, \"How beautiful!\" Not a touch too much nor too  little. The art is to conceal art. Directly affectation enters, beauty  goes out. But while there should be nothing bizarre in our method of  furnishing, rooms should reflect the individuality of their owners. They  should never look as if they were furnished by contract. People should  allow their own taste to have its way. Whatever we have, let it not be  flimsy, but good of its kind. Good things are cheapest in the end, and  it is economy to employ good dependable tradespeople.    When he heard of the occurrence of some piece of mischief, George the  Fourth used to ask, \"Who is _she_?\" This question may be asked with much  more reason when we enter a pretty room. Who is she whose judgment and  fingers have so arranged these unconsidered trifles as to make out of  very little an effect so charming? Compare a bachelor's house with the  same house after its master has taken to himself a helpmate. \"Bless  thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art translated!\" the friends of his  former state may well exclaim. Of course we are supposing the lady's  head to be furnished, for if that do not contain a certain amount of  common sense, good taste, and power of observation, the result will soon  be observed in her house. A drawing-room should be for use and not for  show merely, and should be furnished accordingly. It should be tidy, but  not painfully tidy. Self-respect should lead us to have things nice in  our homes, whether the eyes of company are to see them or not. It was  surely right of Robinson Crusoe to make his solitary cave look as smart  as possible. Who does not respect the wife whose dinner-table is  prettily adorned with flowers even on days when no one but her husband  has the honour of dining with her?    To furnish the kitchen is a troublesome and unsatisfactory business. It  is unsatisfactory because one expends on kitchen utensils, which are  rather dear, a considerable amount of money without having much to show.  And it is troublesome to have to distinguish between the many implements  a cook really does require and those which she only imagines to be  necessary. Still, cook must be supplied with every appliance that is  really necessary. Without these there may be an expenditure of time out  of all proportion to her task. On the equipoise of that lady's temper  depends to a not inconsiderable extent the comfort of the house. Have in  the kitchen a good clock, and teach your servants to take a pleasure in  making sweet and bright their own special chambers.    Our present sanitary ideas will tolerate no longer curtains on beds, or  heavy carpets on the floors of sleeping apartments. Both foster dust,  and dust conceals the germs of disease. That carpets are sometimes made  a too convenient receptacle for dust is evident from the answer that was  once given by a housemaid. Professing to have become converted to  religion, she was asked for a proof of the happy change, and thus  replied: \"Now,\" she said, \"I sweep _under_ the mats.\" For bedrooms there  should be narrow, separate, tight-woven strips of carpet around the bed  and in front of furniture only. These are easy to shake, and in every  sense in harmony with the simplicity and cleanliness which, if health is  to be preserved, must pervade the bedroom. The more air it contains the  better, and hence everything superfluous should be banished from it. But  we shall not specify the different things which, in our opinion, should,  or should not, be found in the several rooms of a house, for after all  it is the arrangement of furniture rather than the furniture itself that  makes the difference.    If the question be asked, Is it better to pick up furniture at auctions  or to buy it in shops? we reply, Avoid auctions. Things are varnished up  to the eye, and it is seldom possible to examine them. So you generally  find on returning home from a sale that your purchases are by no means  what they seemed.    As regards the expense of furnishing a small house such as young  housekeepers of the middle class usually hire when first they settle  down in life, this of course varies with circumstances, but even one  hundred pounds ought nearly to suffice. To estimate the cost rightly,  one should know the tastes of the people concerned, their social  position, the size of their house, and the style of the locality in  which they propose to live. Very good furniture can sometimes be  obtained secondhand, but one must be on their guard against \"bargains\"  that are worthless. There are certain articles,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35545"],[0,"Sanders of the River (#19)"],[1,"to get out of  his way, and since both were going with the current, it was only by  putting the wheel over and scraping a sandbank that the steamer missed  sinking the smaller craft.    \"Bring that man on board!\" fumed Sanders, and when the canoe had been  unceremoniously hauled to the _Zaire's_ side by a boat-hook, and the  occupant rudely pulled on board, Sanders let himself go.    \"By your infernal laziness,\" he said, \"I see that you are of the Akasava  people; yet that is no reason why you should take the middle of the  channel to yourself.\"    \"Lord, it is written in the books of your gods,\" said the man, \"that the  river is for us all, black and white, each being equal in the eyes of  the white gods.\"    Sanders checked his lips impatiently.    \"When you and I are dead,\" he said, \"we shall be equal, but since I am  quick and you are quick, I shall give you ten strokes with a whip to  correct the evil teaching that is within you.\"    He made a convert.    But the mischief was done.    Sanders knew the native mind much better than any man living, and he  spent a certain period every day for the next month cursing the Reverend  Kenneth McDolan. So far, however, no irreparable mischief had been done,  but Sanders was not the kind of man to be caught napping. Into the  farthermost corners of his little kingdom his secret-service men were  dispatched, and Sanders sat down to await developments.    At first the news was good; the spies sent back stories of peace, of  normal happiness; then the reports became less satisfactory. The Akasava  country is unfortunately placed, for it is the very centre territory,  the ideal position for the dissemination of foolish propaganda, as  Sanders had discovered before.    The stories the spies sent or brought were of secret meetings, of envoys  from tribe to tribe, envoys that stole out from villages by dead of  night, of curious rites performed in the depth of the forest and other  disturbing matters.    Then came a climax.    Tigili, the king of the N'Gombi folk, made preparations for a secret  journey. He sacrificed a goat and secured good omens; likewise three  witch-doctors in solemn conclave gave a favourable prophecy.    The chief slipped down the river one night with fourteen paddlers, a  drummer, his chief headsman, and two of his wives, and reached the  Akasava city at sunset the next evening. Here the chief of the Akasava  met him, and led him to his hut.    \"Brother,\" said the Akasava chief, not without a touch of pompousness,  \"I have covered my bow with the skin of a monkey.\"    Tigili nodded gravely.    \"My arrows are winged with the little clouds,\" he said in reply.    In this cryptic fashion they spoke for the greater part of an hour, and  derived much profit therefrom.    In the shadow of the hut without lay a half-naked man, who seemed to  sleep, his head upon his arm, his legs doubled up comfortably.    One of the Akasava guard saw him, and sought to arouse him with the butt  of his spear, but he only stirred sleepily, and, thinking that he must  be a man of Tigili's retinue, they left him.    When the king and the chief had finished their palaver, Tigili rose from  the floor of the hut and went back to his canoe, and the chief of the  Akasava stood on the bank of the river watching the craft as it went  back the way it had come.    The sleeper rose noiselessly and took another path to the river. Just  outside the town he had to cross a path of moonlit clearing, and a man  challenged him.    This man was an Akasava warrior, and was armed, and the sleeper stood  obedient to the summons.    \"Who are you?\"    \"I am a stranger,\" said the man.    The warrior came nearer and looked in his face.    \"You are a spy of Sandi,\" he said, and then the other closed with him.    The warrior would have shouted, but a hand like steel was on his throat.  The sentinel made a little sound like the noise a small river makes when  it crosses a shallow bed of shingle, then his legs bent limply, and he  went down.    The sleeper bent down over him, wiped his knife on the bare shoulder of  the dead man, and went on his way to the river. Under the bush he found  a canoe, untied the native rope that fastened it, and stepping in, he  sent the tiny dug-out down the stream.           *     *     *     *     *    \"And what do you make of all this?\" asked Sanders. He was standing on  his broad stoep, and before him was the spy, a lithe young man, in the  uniform of a sergeant of Houssa Police.    \"Master, it is the secret society, and they go to make a great killing,\"  said the sergeant.    The Commissioner paced the verandah with his head upon his breast, his  hands clasped behind his back.    These secret societies he knew well enough, though his territories had  been free of them. He knew their mushroom growth; how they rose from  nothingness with rituals and practices ready-made. He knew their  influence up and down the Liberian coast; he had some knowledge of the  \"silent ones\" of Nigeria, and had met the \"white faces\" in the Kassai.  And now the curse had come to his territory. It meant war, the upsetting  of twenty years' work--the work of men who died and died joyfully, in  the faith that they had brought peace to the land--it meant the  undermining of all his authority.    He turned to Abiboo.    \"Take the steamer,\" he said, \"and go quickly to the Ochori country,  telling Bosambo, the chief, that I will come to him--the palaver is  finished.\" He knew he could depend upon Bosambo if the worst came.    In the days of waiting he sent a long message to the Administration,  which lived in ease a hundred miles down the coast. He had a land wire  running along the seashore, and when it worked it was a great blessing.  Fortunately it was in good order now, but there had been times when  wandering droves of elephants had pulled up the poles and twisted a mile  or so of wire into a hopeless tangle.    The reply to his message came quickly.        \"Take extreme steps to wipe out society. If necessary arrest      Tigili. I will support you with four hundred men and a gunboat;      prefer you should arrange the matter without fuss.          \"Administration.\"    Sanders took a long walk by the sea to think out the situation and the  solution. If the people were preparing for war, there would be  simultaneous action, a general rising. He shook his head. Four hundred  men and a gunboat more or less would make no difference. There was a  hope that one tribe would rise before the other; he could deal with the  Akasava; he could deal with the Isisi plus the Akasava; he was sure of  the Ochori--that was a comfort--but the others? He shook his head again.  Perhaps the inherent idleness of the Akasava would keep them back. Such  a possibility was against their traditions.    He must have come upon a solution suddenly, for he stopped dead in his  walk, and stood still, thinking profoundly, with his head upon his  breast. Then he turned and walked quickly back to his bungalow.    What date had been chosen for the rising we may never know for certain.  What is known is that the Akasava, the N'Gombi, the Isisi, and the  Boleki folk were preparing in secret for a time of killing, when there  came the great news.    Sandi was dead.    A canoe had overturned on the Isisi River, and the swift current had  swept the Commissioner away, and though men ran up and down the bank no  other sign of him was visible but a great white helmet that floated,  turning slowly, out of sight.    So a man of the Akasava reported, having learnt it from a sergeant of  Houssas, and instantly the _lo-koli_ beat sharply, and the headmen of  the villages came panting to the palaver house to meet the paramount  chief of the Akasava.    \"Sandi is dead,\" said the chief solemnly. \"He was our father and our  mother and carried us in his arms; we loved him and did many  disagreeable things for him because of our love. But now that he is  dead, and there is none to say 'Yea' or 'Nay' to us, the time of which I  have spoken to you secretly has come; therefore let us take up our arms  and go out, first against the God-men who pray and bewitch us with the  sprinkling of water, then against the chief of the Ochori, who for many  years have put shame upon us.\"    \"Master,\" said a little chief from the fishing village which is near to  the Ochori border, \"is it wise--our Lord Sandi having said there shall  be no war?\"    \"Our Lord Sandi is dead,\" said the paramount chief wisely; \"and being  dead, it does not greatly concern us what he said; besides which,\" he  said, as a thought struck him, \"last night I had a dream and saw Sandi;  he was standing amidst great fires, and he said, 'Go forth and bring me  the head of the chief of the Ochori.'\"    No further time was wasted.    That night the men of twenty villages danced the dance of killing, and  the great fire of the Akasava burnt redly on the sandy beach to the  embarrassment of a hippo family that lived in the high grasses near by.    In the grey of the morning the Akasava chief mustered six hundred spears  and three score of canoes, and he delivered his oration:    \"First, we will destroy the mission men, for they are white, and it is  not right that they should live and Sandi be dead; then we will go  against Bosambo, the chief of the Ochori. When rains came in the time of  kidding, he who is a foreigner and of no human origin brought many evil  persons with him and destroyed our fishing villages, and Sandi said  there should be no killing. Now Sandi is dead, and, I do not doubt, in  hell, and there is none to hold our pride.\"    Round the bend of the river, ever so slowly, for she was breasting a  strong and treacherous current, came the nose of the _Zaire_. It is  worthy of note that the little blue flag at her stern was not at  half-mast. The exact significance of this was lost on the Akasava.  Gingerly the little craft felt its way to the sandy strip of beach, a  plank was"]]]
