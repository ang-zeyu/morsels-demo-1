JOHN YAXLEY.\"    This remarkable agreement--made after Richard III. had vainly endeavored  to compose by arbitration the differences between Sir Robert and Sir  Robert's heir-general--certifies that Sir Robert Plumpton engaged to  provide the sergeant with suitable entertainment at the assize towns,  and also throws light upon the origin of retaining-fees. It appears from  the agreement that in olden time a retaining fee was merely part  (surrendered in advance) of a certain sum stipulated to be paid for  certain services. In principle it was identical with the payment of the  shilling, still given in rural districts, to domestic servants on an  agreement for service, and with the transfer of the queen's shilling  given to every soldier on enlistment. There is no need to mention the  classic origin of this ancient mode of giving force to a contract.    From the 'Household and Privy Purse Expenses of the Le Stranges of  Hunstanton,' published in the Archaeologia, may be gleamed some  interesting particulars relating to the payment of counsel in the reign  of Henry VIII. In 1520, Mr. Cristofer Jenney received from the Le  Stranges a half-yearly fee of ten shillings; and this general retainer  was continued on the same terms till 1527, when the fee was raised from  L1 per annum to a yearly payment of L2 13_s._ 4_d._ To Mr. Knightley was  paid the sum of 8_s._ 11_d._ \"for his fee, and that money yt he layde  oute for suying of Simon Holden;\" and the same lawyer also received at  another time 14_s._ 3_d._ \"for his fee and cost of sute for iii termes.\"  A fee of 6_s._ 8_d._ was paid to \"Mr. Spelman, s'jeant, for his counsell  in makyng my answer in ye Duchy Cham.;\" and the same serjeant received  a fee of 3_s._ 4_d._ \"for his counsell in putting in of the answer.\"  Fees of 3_s._ 4_d._ were in like manner given \"for counsell\" to Mr.  Knightley and Mr. Whyte; and in 1534, Mr. Yelverton was remunerated \"for  his counsell\" with the unusually liberal honorarium of twenty shillings.  From the household book of the Earl of Northumberland, it appears that  order was made, in this same reign, for \"every oone of my lordes  counsaill to have c's. fees, if he have it in household and not by  patent.\" After the earl's establishment was reduced to forty-two  persons, it still retained \"one of my lordes counsaill for annswering  and riddying of causes, whenne sutors cometh to my lord.\" At a time when  every lord was required to administer justice to his tenants and the  inferior people of his territory, a counsellor learned in the law, was  an important and most necessary officer in a grand seigneur's retinue.    Whilst Sir Thomas More lived in Bucklersbury, he \"gained, without grief,  not so little as L400 by the year.\" This income doubtless accrued from  the emoluments of his judicial appointment in the City, as well as from  his practice at Westminster and elsewhere. In Henry VIII.'s time it was  a very considerable income, such as was equalled by few leaders of the  bar not holding high office under the Crown.    In Elizabeth's reign, and during the time of her successor, barristers'  fees show a tendency toward increase; and the lawyers who were employed  as advocates for the Crown, or held judicial appointments, acquired  princely incomes, and in some cases amassed large fortunes. Fees of  20_s._ were more generally paid to counsel under the virgin queen, than  in the days of her father; but still half that fee was not thought too  small a sum for an opinion given by Her Majesty's Solicitor General.  Indeed, the ten-shilling fee was a very usual fee in Elizabeth's reign;  and it long continued an ordinary payment for one opinion on a case, or  for one speech in a cause of no great importance and of few  difficulties. 'A barrister is like Balaam's ass, only speaking when he  sees the angel,' was a familiar saying in the seventeenth century. In  Chancery, however, by an ordinance of the Lords Commissioners passed in  1654, to regulate the conduct of suits and the payments to masters,  counsel, and solicitors, it was arranged that on the hearing of a cause,  utter-barristers should receive L1 fees, whilst the Lord Protector's  counsel and sergeants-at-law should receive L2 fees, _i.e._, 'double  fees.'    The archives of Lyme Regis show that under Elizabeth the usage was  maintained of supplying counsel with delicacies of the table, and also  of providing them with means of locomotion. Here are some items in an  old record of disbursements made by the corporation of Lyme  Regis:--\"A.D. Paid for Wine carried with us to Mr. Poulett--L0 3_s._  6_d._; Wine and sugar given to Mr. Poulett, L0 3_s._ 4_d._; Horse-hire,  and for the Sergeant to ride to Mr. Walrond, of Bovey, and for a loaf of  sugar, and for conserves given there to Mr. Poppel, L1 1_s._ 0_d._; Wine  and sugar given to Judge Anderson, L0 3_s._ 4_d._ A bottle and sugar  given to Mr. Gibbs (a lawyer).\"    Under Elizabeth, the allowance made to Queen's Sergeants was L26 6_s._  8_d._ for fee, reward, and robes; and L20. for his services whenever a  Queen's Sergeant travelled circuit as Justice of Assize. The fee for her  Solicitor General was L50. When Francis Bacon was created King's Counsel  to James I., an annual salary of forty pounds was assigned to him from  the royal purse; and down to William IV.'s time, King's Counsel received  a stipend of L40 a year, and an allowance for stationery. Under the last  mentioned monarch, however, the stipend and allowance were both  withdrawn; and at present the status of a Q.C. is purely an affair of  professional precedence, to which no fixed emolument is attached.    But a list of the fees, paid from the royal purse to each judge or crown  lawyer under James I., would afford no indication as to the incomes  enjoyed by the leading members of the bench and bar at that period. The  salaries paid to those officers were merely retaining fees, and their  chief remuneration consisted of a large number of smaller fees. Like the  judges of prior reigns, King James's judges were forbidden to accept  _presents_ from actual suitors; but no suitor could obtain a hearing  from any one of them, until he had paid into court certain fees, of  which the fattest was a sum of money for the judge's personal use. At  one time many persons labored under an erroneous impression, that as  judges were forbidden to accept presents from actual suitors, the honest  judge of past times had no revenue besides his specified salary and  allowance. Like the king's judges, the king's counsellors frequently  made great incomes by fees, though their nominal salaries were  invariably insignificant. At a time when Francis Bacon was James's  Attorney General, and received no more than L81 6_s._ 8_d._ for his  yearly salary, he made L6000 per annum in his profession; and of that  income--a royal income in those days--the greater portion consisted of  fees paid to him for attending to the king's business. \"I shall now,\"  Bacon wrote to the king, \"again make oblation to your Majesty,--first of  my heart, then of my service; thirdly, of my place of Attorney, which I  think is honestly worth L6000 per annum; and fourthly, of my place in  the Star Chamber, which is worth L1600 per annum, and with the favor and  countenance of a Chancellor, much more.\" Coke had made a still larger  income during his tenure of the Attorney's place, the fees from his  private official practice amounting to no loss a sum than seven  thousand pounds in a single year.    At later periods of the seventeenth century barristers made large  incomes, but the fees seem to have been by no means exorbitant. Junior  barristers received very modest payments, and it would appear that  juniors received fees from eminent counsel for opinions and other  professional services. Whilst he acted as treasurer of the Middle  Temple, at an early period of his career, Whitelock received a fee from  Attorney General Noy. \"Upon my carrying the bill,\" writes Whitelock, \"to  Mr. Attorney General Noy for his signature, with that of the other  benchers, he was pleased to advise with me about a patent the king had  commanded him to draw, upon which he gave me a fee for it out of his  little purse, saying, 'Here, take those single pence,' which amounted to  eleven groats, 'and I give you more than an attorney's fee, because you  will be a better man than the Attorney General. This you will find to be  true.' After much other drollery, wherein he delighted and excelled, we  parted, abundance of company attending to speak to him all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27827"],[0,"The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana (#19)"],[1,"observe the fasts and vows of her husband,  and when he tries to prevent her doing this, she should persuade him to  let her do it.    At appropriate times of the year, and when they happen to be cheap, she  should buy earth, bamboos, firewood, skins, and iron pots, as also salt  and oil. Fragrant substances, vessels made of the fruit of the plant  wrightea antidysenterica, or oval leaved wrightea, medicines, and other  things which are always wanted, should be obtained when required and  kept in a secret place of the house. The seeds of the radish, the  potato, the common beet, the Indian wormwood, the mangoe, the cucumber,  the egg plant, the kushmanda, the pumpkin gourd, the surana, the  bignonia indica, the sandal wood, the premna spinosa, the garlic plant,  the onion, and other vegetables, should be bought and sown at the proper  seasons.    The wife, moreover, should not tell to strangers the amount of her  wealth, nor the secrets which her husband has confided to her. She  should surpass all the women of her own rank in life in her cleverness,  her appearance, her knowledge of cookery, her pride, and her manner of  serving her husband. The expenditure of the year should be regulated by  the profits. The milk that remains after the meals should be turned into  ghee or clarified butter. Oil and sugar should be prepared at home;  spinning and weaving should also be done there; and a store of ropes and  cords, and barks of trees for twisting into ropes should be kept. She  should also attend to the pounding and cleaning of rice, using its small  grain and chaff in some way or other. She should pay the salaries of the  servants, look after the tilling of the fields, and keeping of the  flocks and herds, superintend the making of vehicles, and take care of  the rams, cocks, quails, parrots, starlings, cuckoos, peacocks, monkeys,  and deer; and finally adjust the income and expenditure of the day. The  worn-out clothes should be given to those servants who have done good  work, in order to show them that their services have been appreciated,  or they may be applied to some other use. The vessels in which wine is  prepared, as well as those in which it is kept, should be carefully  looked after, and put away at the proper time. All sales and purchases  should also be well attended to. The friends of her husband she should  welcome by presenting them with flowers, ointment, incense, betel  leaves, and betel nut. Her father-in-law and mother-in law she should  treat as they deserve, always remaining dependant on their will, never  contradicting them, speaking to them in few and not harsh words, not  laughing loudly in their presence, and acting with their friends and  enemies as with her own. In addition to the above she should not be  vain, or too much taken up with her enjoyments. She should be liberal  towards her servants, and reward them on holidays and festivals; and not  give away anything without first making it known to her husband.    Thus ends the manner of living of a virtuous woman.    During the absence of her husband on a journey the virtuous woman should  wear only her auspicious ornaments, and observe the fasts in honour of  the Gods. While anxious to hear the news of her husband, she should  still look after her household affairs. She should sleep near the elder  women of the house, and make herself agreeable to them. She should look  after and keep in repair the things that are liked by her husband, and  continue the works that have been begun by him. To the abode of her  relations she should not go except on occasions of joy and sorrow, and  then she should go in her usual travelling dress, accompanied by her  husband's servants, and not remain there for a long time. The fasts and  feasts should be observed with the consent of the elders of the house.  The resources should be increased by making purchases and sales  according to the practice of the merchants, and by means of honest  servants, superintended by herself. The income should be increased, and  the expenditure diminished as much as possible. And when her husband  returns from his journey, she should receive him at first in her  ordinary clothes, so that he may know in what way she has lived during  his absence, and should bring to him some presents, as also materials  for the worship of the Deity.    Thus ends the part relating to the behaviour of a wife during the  absence of her husband on a journey.    There are also some verses on the subject as follows.    \"The wife, whether she be a woman of noble family, or a virgin widow[53]  re-married, or a concubine, should lead a chaste life, devoted to her  husband, and doing every thing for his welfare. Women acting thus,  acquire Dharma, Artha, and Kama, obtain a high position, and generally  keep their husbands devoted to them.\"    FOOTNOTE:    [Footnote 53: This probably refers to a girl married in her infancy, or  when very young, and whose husband had died before she arrived at the  age of puberty. Infant marriages are still the common custom of the  Hindoos.]          CHAPTER II.    ON THE CONDUCT OF THE ELDER WIFE TOWARDS THE OTHER WIVES OF HER HUSBAND,  AND ON THAT OF A YOUNGER WIFE TOWARDS THE ELDER ONES. ALSO ON THE  CONDUCT OF A VIRGIN WIDOW RE-MARRIED; OF A WIFE DISLIKED BY HER HUSBAND;  OF THE WOMEN IN THE KING'S HAREM; AND LASTLY ON THE CONDUCT OF A HUSBAND  TOWARDS MANY WIVES.      The causes of re-marrying during the lifetime of the wife are as  follows:    (1). The folly or ill temper of the wife.    (2). Her husband's dislike to her.    (3). The want of offspring.    (4). The continual birth of daughters.    (5). The incontinence of the husband.    From the very beginning the wife should endeavour to attract the heart  of her husband, by showing to him continually her devotion, her good  temper, and her wisdom. If however she bears him no children, she should  herself tell her husband to marry another woman. And when the second  wife is married, and brought to the house, the first wife should give  her a position superior to her own, and look upon her as a sister. In  the morning the elder wife should forcibly make the younger one decorate  herself in the presence of their husband, and should not mind all the  husband's favour being given to her. If the younger wife does anything  to displease her husband the elder one should not neglect her, but  should always be ready to give her most careful advice, and should teach  her to do various things in the presence of her husband. Her children  she should treat as her own, her attendants she should look upon with  more regard, even than on her own servants, her friends she should  cherish with love and kindness, and her relations with great honour.    When there are many other wives besides herself, the elder wife should  associate with the one who is immediately next to her in rank and age,  and should instigate the wife who has recently enjoyed her husband's  favour to quarrel with the present favourite. After this she should  sympathize with the former, and having collected all the other wives  together, should get them to denounce the favourite as a scheming and  wicked woman, without however committing herself in any way. If the  favourite wife happens to quarrel with the husband, then the elder wife  should take her part and give her false encouragement, and thus cause  the quarrel to be increased. If there be only a little quarrel between  the two, the elder wife should do all she can to work it up into a large  quarrel. But if after all this she finds the husband still continues to  love his favourite wife she should then change her tactics, and  endeavour to bring about a conciliation between them, so as to avoid her  husband's displeasure.    Thus ends the conduct of the elder wife.    The younger wife should regard the elder wife of her husband as her  mother, and should not give anything away, even to her own relations,  without her knowledge. She should tell her everything about herself, and  not approach her husband without her permission. Whatever is told to her  by the elder wife she should not reveal to others, and she should take  care of the children of the senior even more than of her own. When alone  with her husband she should serve him well, but should not tell him of  the pain she suffers from the existence of a rival wife. She may also  obtain secretly from her husband some marks of his particular regard for  her, and may tell him that she lives only for him, and for the regard  that he has for her. She should never reveal her love for her husband,  nor her husband's love for her to any person, either in pride or in  anger, for a wife that reveals the secrets of her husband is despised by  him. As for seeking to obtain the regard of her husband, Gonardiya says,  that it should always be done in private, for fear of the elder wife. If  the elder wife be disliked by her husband, or be childless, she should  sympathize with her, and should ask her husband to do the same, but  should surpass her in leading the life of a chaste woman.    Thus ends the conduct of the younger wife towards the elder.    A widow in poor circumstances, or of a weak nature, and who allies  herself again to a man, is called a widow re-married.    The followers of Babhravya say that a virgin widow should not marry a  person whom she may be obliged to leave on account of his bad character,  or of his being destitute of the excellent qualities of a man, she thus  being obliged to have recourse to another person. Gonardya is of opinion  that as the cause of a widow's marrying again is her desire for  happiness, and as happiness is secured by the possession of excellent  qualities in her husband, joined to love of enjoyment, it is better  therefore to secure a person endowed with such qualities in the first  instance. Vatsyayana however thinks that a widow may marry any person  that she likes, and that she thinks will suit her.  "]]]
