If a minister of the altar commits homicide or any other great crime,  he shall be deprived of his ecclesiastical office and banished, and  shall travel as a pilgrim as far as the Pope appoints for him and  zealously make amends. If he seeks to clear himself, he shall do so by  the triple mode of proof. If he does not begin to make amends both to  God and men within 30 days, he shall be outlawed.    If anyone binds or beats or deeply insults a man in holy orders, he  shall make amends towards him and shall pay the fine due to the bishop  for sacrilege, in accordance with the rank of the injured man, and to  his lord or to the king the full fine for breach of his mund, or he  shall clear himself by the full process of exculpation.    If a man in holy orders commits a capital crime, he shall be arrested,  and his cases shall be reserved for the bishop's decision.    If a condemned man desires confession, he shall never be refused him or  pay the king 120s. or he shall clear himself by selecting five men and  be himself the sixth.    *No condemned man shall be put to death during the Sunday festival,  unless he flees or fights, but he shall be arrested and kept in custody  until the festival is over. If a freeman works during a church  festival, he shall make amends by payment of his healsfang and make  amends to God according to the directions given him. If as slave works,  he shall undergo the lash or pay the fine, according to the nature of  the offense. If a lord compels his slave to work during a church  festival, he shall lose the slave, who shall then obtain the rights of  a freeman and the lord shall pay a fine or clear himself.    If a freeman breaks an ordained fast, he shall pay a fine. If a slave  does so, he shall undergo the lash or pay the fine in accordance with  the nature of the deed.    If anyone openly causes a breach of the fast of Lent by fighting or by  intercourse with women or by robbery or by any great misdeed, he shall  pay double compensation just as he must do during a high festival. If  he denies the charge, he shall clear himself by the triple process of  exculpation.    *If anyone refuses by force the payment of ecclesiastical dues, he  shall pay the full fine or he shall clear himself: he shall select 11  men and himself make a twelfth. If he wounds anyone, he shall make  amends and pay the full fine to the lord and redeem his hands from the  bishop or lose them. If he kills a man, he shall be outlawed and  pursued with hostility. If he so acts as to bring about his own death  by setting himself against the law, no compensation shall be paid for  him.    If anyone injures one of the clergy, he shall make amends according to  the rank of the person injured, either by the payment of his wergeld or  a fine or by the forfeiture of all his property.    *If anyone commits adultery, he shall make amends according to the  nature of the offense. It is wicked adultery for a pious man to commit  fornication with an unmarried woman, and much worse with the wife of  another man or with any woman who has taken religious vows.    *If anyone commits incest, he shall make amends according to the degree  of relationship between them, either by the payment of wergeld or of a  fine, or by the forfeiture of all his possessions.    *If anyone does violence to a widow or maiden, he shall pay his wergeld.    *If a woman commits adultery, her husband shall have all she possesses  and she shall lose her nose and her ears.    If a married man commits adultery with his own slave, he shall lose her  and make amends to God and to men.    *If anyone has a lawful wife and also a concubine, no priest shall  perform for him any of the offices which must be performed for a  Christian man, until he desists and makes amends as the bishop shall  direct.    Foreigners, if they will not regularize their unions, shall be driven  from the land with their possessions, and shall depart in sin.    *Any murderer shall be given up to the kinsmen of the slain man. The  bishop shall pronounce judgment.    *If anyone plots against the king or his own lord, he shall forfeit his  life and all that he possesses, unless he proves himself innocent by  the triple ordeal.    *If anyone violates the protection or a king, archbishop or bishop, he  shall pay 5, 3, or 2 pounds respectively as compensation.    *Anyone who fights at the king's court shall lose his life, unless  pardoned by the king.    *If a man unjustly disarms another, he shall compensate him by the  payment of his healsfang. If he binds him, he shall compensate by the  payment of half his wergeld.    If anyone is guilty of a capital deed of violence while serving in the  army, he shall lose his life or his wergeld.    *If a man makes forcible entry into another man's house, he shall pay 5  pounds to the king. If he is slain in such a case, no compensation  shall be paid for his death.    *Anyone guilty of robbery shall restore the stolen goods and pay the  injured man as much again and forfeit his wergeld to the king.    *According to secular law, assaults upon houses, arson, theft which  cannot be disproved, murder which cannot be denied, and treachery  towards a man's lord are crimes for which no compensation can be paid.    If anyone neglects the repair of fortifications or bridges or military  service, he shall pay 120s. to the king or he shall clear himself with  the support of 11 compurgators out of 14 nominated by the court.    The whole nation shall assist in the repair of churches.    If anyone unlawfully maintains an excommunicated person, he shall  deliver him up in accordance with the law, and pay compensation to him  to whom it belongs, and to the king his wergeld. Anyone keeping and  maintaining as excommunicated man or an outlaw shall risk losing his  life and all his property.    Greater leniency shall be shown in passing judgment and in imposing  penance on the weak than on the strong because they cannot bear an  equally heavy burden. So we distinguish between age and youth, wealth  and poverty, freemen and slaves, the sound and the weak.    *When a man is an involuntary agent in evil-doing or does something  unintentionally, he is more entitled to clemency.    All my reeves shall provide for me from my own property and no man need  give them anything as purveyance. If any of my reeves demands a fine,  he shall forfeit his wergeld to me. The public has been so far too  greatly oppressed by this.    *If a man dies intestate [without a will], whether through negligence  or sudden death, his lord shall take no more than his legal heriot. The  property shall be divided among his wife and children and near kinsmen  according to the share which belongs to him.    Heriots shall be fixed with regard to the rank of the person for whom  they are paid. The heriot of any earl is eight horses, four saddled and  four unsaddled, four helmets, four coats of chainmail, eight spears,  eight shields, four swords, and 200 mancuses of gold. The heriot of a  king's thegn is four horses, two saddled and two unsaddled, two swords,  four spears, four shields, four helmets, four coats of chain mail and  50 mancuses of gold, but among the Danes who possess rights of  jurisdiction 4 pounds. The heriot of an ordinary thegn is a horse and  its trappings and his weapons or his healsfang in Wessex, and in Mercia  2 pounds, and in East Anglia 2 pounds. The heriot of a man who stands  in a more intimate relationship to the king shall be two horses, one  saddled and one unsaddled, one sword, two spears, two shields, and 50  mancuses of gold. The heriot of a man who is inferior in wealth is 2  pounds.    When a householder has dwelt all his time free from claims and charges,  his wife and children shall dwell there unmolested by litigation.    *Every widow who remains a year without a husband shall do what she  herself desires. If within the space of a year, she chooses a husband,  she shall lose her morning gift and all the property she had from her  first husband, and his nearest relatives shall take the land and  property which she had held. And the second husband shall forfeit his  wergeld to the king or the lord to whom it has been granted. And  although she has been married by force, she shall lose her possessions,  unless she leaves the man and returns home. And no widow shall be too  hastily consecrated as a nun. And every widow shall pay heriots within  a year without incurring a fine, if it has not been convenient for her  to pay earlier.    *No woman or maiden shall be forced to marry a man whom she dislikes,  nor shall she be given for money, except the suitor desires of his own  freewill to give something.    If anyone sets his spear at the door to another man's house, he himself  having an errand inside, or if anyone carefully lays any other weapons  where they might remain quietly, and another seizes the weapon and  works mischief with it, he shall pay compensation for it. He who owns  the weapon may clear himself by asserting that the mischief was done  without his desire or authority or advice or cognizance.    *If anyone carries stolen goods home to his cottage and is detected,  the owner shall have what he has tracked. The wife shall be clear of  any charge of complicity unless the goods had been put under her lock  and key or in her storeroom, her chest, or her cupboard. But no wife  can forbid her husband from depositing anything in his cottage.    Until now it has been the custom for grasping persons to treat a child  which lay in the cradle, even though it had never tasted food, as being  guilty as though it were fully intelligent. I forbid this practice.    The man who, through cowardice, deserts his lord or his comrades in an  expedition, either by sea or by land, shall lose all he possesses and  his own life, and the lord shall take back the property and the land  which he had given him. And if he has land held by title-deed it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4081"],[0,"The Alchemist (#19)"],[1,"'s goose-turd bands, that ride with her!      KAS. Most brave!

Nay, and by this means, sir, you shall be brother    To a great count.      KAS. Ay, I knew that at first,    This match will advance the house of the Kastrils.      SUB.

Sweet madam--      DOL. \"And last Gog-dust, and Egypt-dust, which fall    In the last link of the fourth chain. And these    Be stars in story, which none see, or look at\"--      MAM.

Dear lady--      DOL. \"To come from Salem, and from Athens,    And teach the people of Great Britain\"--      [ENTER FACE, HASTILY, IN HIS SERVANT'S DRESS.]      FACE. What's the matter, sir?

Out of Broughton!    I told you so. 'Slid, stop her mouth.      MAM. Is't best?      FACE. She'll never leave else. If the old man hear her,    We are but faeces, ashes.      SUB [WITHIN].

My brain is quite undone with the fume, sir,    I ne'er must hope to be mine own man again.      MAM. Is all lost, Lungs? will nothing be preserv'd    Of all our cost?      FACE. Faith, very little, sir;    A peck of coals or so, which is cold comfort, sir.      MAM. O, my voluptuous mind! I am justly punish'd.      FACE. And so am I, sir.      MAM. Cast from all my hopes--      FACE. Nay, certainties, sir.      MAM. By mine own base affections.      SUB [SEEMING TO COME TO HIMSELF].    O, the curst fruits of vice and lust!      MAM.

Ay, and repent at home, sir. It may be,    For some good penance you may have it yet;    A hundred pound to the box at Bethlem--      MAM. Yes.      FACE.

Will nought be sav'd that's good for med'cine,    think'st thou?      FACE. I cannot tell, sir. There will be perhaps,    Something about the scraping of the shards,    Will cure the itch,--though not your itch of mind, sir.    [ASIDE.]    It shall be saved for you, and sent home.

Yes, your young widow by this time    Is made a countess, Face; she has been in travail    Of a young heir for you.      FACE. Good sir.      SUB. Off with your case,    And greet her kindly, as a bridegroom should,    After these common hazards.      FACE. Very well, sir.    Will you go fetch Don Diego off, the while?      SUB.
