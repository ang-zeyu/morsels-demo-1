There is always need  of persons not only to discover new truths, and point out when what were  once truths are true no longer, but also to commence new practices, and  set the example of more enlightened conduct, and better taste and sense  in human life. This cannot well be gainsaid by anybody who does not  believe that the world has already attained perfection in all its ways  and practices. It is true that this benefit is not capable of being  rendered by everybody alike: there are but few persons, in comparison  with the whole of mankind, whose experiments, if adopted by others,  would be likely to be any improvement on established practice. But these  few are the salt of the earth; without them, human life would become a  stagnant pool. Not only is it they who introduce good things which did  not before exist; it is they who keep the life in those which already  existed. If there were nothing new to be done, would human intellect  cease to be necessary? Would it be a reason why those who do the old  things should forget why they are done, and do them like cattle, not  like human beings? There is only too great a tendency in the best  beliefs and practices to degenerate into the mechanical; and unless  there were a succession of persons whose ever-recurring originality  prevents the grounds of those beliefs and practices from becoming merely  traditional, such dead matter would not resist the smallest shock from  anything really alive, and there would be no reason why civilisation  should not die out, as in the Byzantine Empire. Persons of genius, it is  true, are, and are always likely to be, a small minority; but in order  to have them, it is necessary to preserve the soil in which they grow.  Genius can only breathe freely in an _atmosphere_ of freedom. Persons of  genius are, _ex vi termini_, _more_ individual than any other  people--less capable, consequently, of fitting themselves, without  hurtful compression, into any of the small number of moulds which  society provides in order to save its members the trouble of forming  their own character. If from timidity they consent to be forced into one  of these moulds, and to let all that part of themselves which cannot  expand under the pressure remain unexpanded, society will be little the  better for their genius. If they are of a strong character, and break  their fetters, they become a mark for the society which has not  succeeded in reducing them to commonplace, to point at with solemn  warning as \"wild,\" \"erratic,\" and the like; much as if one should  complain of the Niagara river for not flowing smoothly between its banks  like a Dutch canal.    I insist thus emphatically on the importance of genius, and the  necessity of allowing it to unfold itself freely both in thought and in  practice, being well aware that no one will deny the position in theory,  but knowing also that almost every one, in reality, is totally  indifferent to it. People think genius a fine thing if it enables a man  to write an exciting poem, or paint a picture. But in its true sense,  that of originality in thought and action, though no one says that it is  not a thing to be admired, nearly all, at heart, think that they can do  very well without it. Unhappily this is too natural to be wondered at.  Originality is the one thing which unoriginal minds cannot feel the use  of. They cannot see what it is to do for them: how should they? If they  could see what it would do for them, it would not be originality. The  first service which originality has to render them, is that of opening  their eyes: which being once fully done, they would have a chance of  being themselves original. Meanwhile, recollecting that nothing was ever  yet done which some one was not the first to do, and that all good  things which exist are the fruits of originality, let them be modest  enough to believe that there is something still left for it to  accomplish, and assure themselves that they are more in need of  originality, the less they are conscious of the want.    In sober truth, whatever homage may be professed, or even paid, to real  or supposed mental superiority, the general tendency of things  throughout the world is to render mediocrity the ascendant power among  mankind. In ancient history, in the middle ages, and in a diminishing  degree through the long transition from feudality to the present time,  the individual was a power in himself; and if he had either great  talents or a high social position, he was a considerable power. At  present individuals are lost in the crowd. In politics it is almost a  triviality to say that public opinion now rules the world. The only  power deserving the name is that of masses, and of governments while  they make themselves the organ of the tendencies and instincts of  masses. This is as true in the moral and social relations of private  life as in public transactions. Those whose opinions go by the name of  public opinion, are not always the same sort of public: in America they  are the whole white population; in England, chiefly the middle class.  But they are always a mass, that is to say, collective mediocrity. And  what is a still greater novelty, the mass do not now take their opinions  from dignitaries in Church or State, from ostensible leaders, or from  books. Their thinking is done for them by men much like themselves,  addressing them or speaking in their name, on the spur of the moment,  through the newspapers. I am not complaining of all this. I do not  assert that anything better is compatible, as a general rule, with the  present low state of the human mind. But that does not hinder the  government of mediocrity from being mediocre government. No government  by a democracy or a numerous aristocracy, either in its political acts  or in the opinions, qualities, and tone of mind which it fosters, ever  did or could rise above mediocrity, except in so far as the sovereign  Many have let themselves be guided (which in their best times they  always have done) by the counsels and influence of a more highly gifted  and instructed One or Few. The initiation of all wise or noble things,  comes and must come from individuals; generally at first from some one  individual. The honour and glory of the average man is that he is  capable of following that initiative; that he can respond internally to  wise and noble things, and be led to them with his eyes open. I am not  countenancing the sort of \"hero-worship\" which applauds the strong man  of genius for forcibly seizing on the government of the world and making  it do his bidding in spite of itself. All he can claim is, freedom to  point out the way. The power of compelling others into it, is not only  inconsistent with the freedom and development of all the rest, but  corrupting to the strong man himself. It does seem, however, that when  the opinions of masses of merely average men are everywhere become or  becoming the dominant power, the counterpoise and corrective to that  tendency would be, the more and more pronounced individuality of those  who stand on the higher eminences of thought. It is in these  circumstances most especially, that exceptional individuals, instead of  being deterred, should be encouraged in acting differently from the  mass. In other times there was no advantage in their doing so, unless  they acted not only differently, but better. In this age the mere  example of nonconformity, the mere refusal to bend the knee to custom,  is itself a service. Precisely because the tyranny of opinion is such as  to make eccentricity a reproach, it is desirable, in order to break  through that tyranny, that people should be eccentric. Eccentricity has  always abounded when and where strength of character has abounded; and  the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional  to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage which it  contained. That so few now dare to be eccentric, marks the chief danger  of the time.    I have said that it is important to give the freest scope possible to  uncustomary things, in order that it may in time appear which of these  are fit to be converted into customs. But independence of action, and  disregard of custom are not solely deserving of encouragement for the  chance they afford that better modes of action, and customs more worthy  of general adoption, may be struck out; nor is it only persons of  decided mental superiority who have a just claim to carry on their lives  in their own way. There is no reason that all human existences should be  constructed on some one, or some small number of patterns. If a person  possesses any tolerable amount of common-sense and experience, his own  mode of laying out his existence is the best, not because it is the best  in itself, but because it is his own mode. Human beings are not like  sheep; and even sheep are not undistinguishably alike. A man cannot get  a coat or a pair of boots to fit him, unless they are either made to his  measure, or he has a whole warehouseful to choose from: and is it easier  to fit him with a life than with a coat, or are human beings more like  one another in their whole physical and spiritual conformation than in  the shape of their feet? If it were only that people have diversities of  taste, that is reason enough for not attempting to shape them all after  one model. But different persons also require different conditions for  their spiritual development; and can no more exist healthily in the same  moral, than all the variety of plants can in the same physical,  atmosphere and climate. The same things which are helps to one person  towards the cultivation of his higher nature, are hindrances to another.  The same mode of life is a healthy excitement to one, keeping all his  faculties of action and enjoyment in their best"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34903"],[0,"Dress Design: An Account of Costume for Artists & Dressmakers (#19)"],[1,"dimensions, in the earlier Elizabeth and James character, generally have  six pieces from front to the middle of the back, which are from 2 to 3  inches deep. The epaulets are made in small stiff tabs, caught together  in two places only, and so have plenty of give in the shoulder  movements; they run to 2-1/4 inches at the widest part, and do not  continue right under the arm. Fig. D, Plate V (see p. 71), has the  middle seam of the back open from the waist to within 2 inches of the  collar, which is noticeable on many of the later Charles I coats. Long  aprons are conspicuous through the 17th century, and one measured was 42  inches wide, gathered to 15 inches at the waist; they were decorated  with three bands of embroidered insertion down the front, with a 3-inch  plain border, edged with small lace; this is typical in character of  design, as is also the same style of linen cape seen on a figure, page  159. A similar one, lent by Sir Robert Filmer, is at the Victoria and  Albert Museum; also a cap, of which I give a pattern, A, page 285. The  smaller type of embroidered aprons of the late 17th and 18th centuries  measure 40 inches wide, 19-1/2 inches deep, with the centre dipping to  17-3/4 inches; another shape is 26 inches wide, 18 inches in centre, and  13-1/2 inches on sides. The bodice, with deep skirt, Fig. B, Plate XVIII  (see p. 183), is a type seen all through the 18th century, both longer  and shorter in the skirt. The pattern of the 17th-century breeches is  interesting as regards the cut, the upper part being kept plain,  otherwise the gathered fullness would have disturbed the set of the  jerkin tabs; the band of these breeches has six hooks either side to  back, which fasten to eyes on an under flap sewn on body of jerkin. The  epaulet on this pattern is only a 3/4-inch piece, braided with two  narrow braids, and the bows on tabs are of ribbon, 1-1/2 inches wide.    The three patterns of capes given on pages 349, 350 will be found  useful, as they are simple and very typical of the Victorian times, long  shawls being otherwise much used. The fullness of the Elizabethan  overdress seen on B, Plate II (see p. 42), is 66 inches to the back  seam, and the Fig. C, on the same plate, is 47 inches. The \"jump,\" or  jacket, Fig. A, Plate III (see p. 55), is 100 inches round, the fullness  of the sleeve 13 inches, and the length of back 32 inches. An over-tunic  of the early 17th century is interesting to examine, though it is a  specimen of German costume.
