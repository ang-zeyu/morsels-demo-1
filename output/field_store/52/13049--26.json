To say that the balloonist was astonished is putting it mildly. He was  even more excited than was Mr. Damon.    \"Wait until I get hold of that Andy Foger!\" he cried. \"I'll make him  sweat for this! I see he's already laid claim to the reward,\" he added,  reading further along in the article. \"He thinks he has put the police  on our trail.\"    \"So he seems to have done,\" added Tom. \"The whole country has been  notified to look out for us,\" the paper says. \"We're likely to be fired  upon whenever we pass over a city or a town.\"    \"Then we'll have to avoid them,\" declared the balloonist.    \"But we must go back,\" declared Tom.    \"Of course. Back to be vindicated. We'll have to give up our trip. My,  my! But this is a surprise!\"    \"I don't see what makes Andy say he saw me with burglar tools,\"  commented Tom, with a puzzled air.    Mr. Sharp thought for a moment. Then he exclaimed \"It was that bag of  tools I sent you after--the long wrenches, the pliers, and the brace  and bits.  You--\"    \"Of course!\" cried Tom. \"I remember now. The bag dropped and opened,  and Andy and Sam saw the tools. But the idea of taking them for burglar  tools!\"    \"Well, I suppose the burglars, whoever they were, did use tools similar  to those to break open the vault,\" put in Mr. Damon. \"Andy probably  thought he was a smart lad to put the police on our track.\"    \"I'll put him on the track, when I return,\" declared Mr. Sharp. \"Well,  now, what's to be done?\"    \"We've got to have food,\" suggested Tom.    \"Yes, but I think we can manage that. I've been looking over the ship,  as best I could in the dark. It seems to be all right. We can start  early in the morning without anyone around here knowing we paid their  town a visit. You and Mr. Damon go back to town, Tom, and order some  stuff. Have the man leave it by the roadside early to-morrow morning.  Tell him it's for some travelers, who will stop and pick it up. Pay him  well, and tell him to keep quiet, as it's for a racing party.  That's  true enough. We're going to race home to vindicate our reputations. I  think that will be all right.\"    \"The man may get suspicious,\" said Mr. Damon.    \"I hope not,\" answered the balloonist. \"We've got to take a chance,  anyhow.\"    The plan worked well, however, the store keeper promising to have the  supplies on hand at the time and place mentioned. He winked as Tom  asked him to keep quiet about it.    \"Oh, I know yo' automobile fellers,\" he said with a laugh. \"You want to  get some grub on the fly, so you won't have to stop, an' can beat th'  other fellow. I know you, fer I see them automobile goggles stickin'  out of your pocket.\"    Tom and Mr. Damon each had a pair, to use when the wind was strong, but  the young inventor had forgotten about his. They now served him a good  turn, for they turned the thoughts of the storekeeper into a new  channel. The lad let it go at that, and, paying for such things as he  and Mr. Damon could not carry, left the store.    The aeronauts passed an uneasy night. They raised their ship high in  the air, anchoring it by a rope fast to a big tree, and they turned on  no lights, for they did not want to betray their position. They  descended before it was yet daylight, and a little later hurried to the  place where the provisions were left. They found their supplies safely  on hand, and, carrying them into the airship, prepared to turn back to  Shopton.    As the ship rose high in the air a crowd of negro laborers passing  through a distant field, saw it. At once they raised a commotion,  shouting and pointing to the wonderful sight.    \"We're discovered!\" cried Tom.    \"No matter,\" answered Mr. Sharp. \"We'll soon be out of sight, and we'll  fly high the rest of this trip.\"    Tom looked down on the fast disappearing little hamlet, and he thought  of the pretty girl in the restaurant.          Chapter 19    Wrecked      With her nose headed north, the Red Cloud swung along through the air.  Those on board were thinking of many things, but chief among them was  the unjust accusation that had been made against them, by an  irresponsible boy--the red-haired Andy Foger. They read the account in  the paper again, seeking to learn from it new things at each perusal.    \"It's just a lot of circumstantial evidence that's what it is,\" said  Tom. \"I admit it might look suspicious to anyone who didn't know us,  but Andy Foger has certainly done the most mischief by his conclusions.  Burglar tools! The idea!\"    \"I think I shall sue the bank for damages,\" declared Mr. Damon. \"They  have injured my reputation by making this accusation against me.  Anyhow, I'll certainly never do any more business with them, and I'll  withdraw my ten thousand dollars deposit, as soon as we get back.\"    \"Mr. Sharp doesn't seem to be accused of doing anything at all,\"  remarked Tom, reading the article for perhaps the tenth time.    \"Oh, I guess I'm a sort of general all-around bad man, who helped you  burglars to escape with the booty,\" answered the balloonist, with a  laugh. \"I expect to be arrested along with you two.\"    \"But must we be arrested?\" inquired Tom anxiously. \"I don't like that  idea at all. We haven't done anything.\"    \"This is my plan,\" went on Mr. Sharp. \"We'll get back to Shopton as  quickly as we can. We'll arrive at night, so no one will see us, and,  leaving the airship in some secluded spot, we'll go to the police and  explain matters. We can easily prove that we had nothing to do with the  robbery. Why we were all home the night it happened! Mr. Swift, Mr.  Jackson and Mrs. Baggert can testify to that.\"    \"Yes,\" agreed Mr. Damon. \"I guess they can. Bless my bank book, but  that seems a good plan. We'll follow it.\"    Proceeding on the plan which they had decided was the best one, the Red  Cloud was sent high into the air. So high up was it that, at times it  was above the clouds. Though this caused some little discomfort at  first, especially to Mr. Damon, he soon became used to it, as did the  others. And it had the advantage of concealing them from the persons  below who might be on the lookout.    \"For we don't want to be shot at again,\" explained Mr. Sharp. \"It isn't  altogether healthy, and not very safe. If we keep high up they can't  see us; much less shoot at us. They'll take us for some big bird. Then,  too, we can go faster.\"    \"I suppose there will be another alarm sent out, from those negroes  having sighted us,\" ventured Tom.    \"Oh, yes, but those colored fellows were so excited they may describe  us as having horns, hoofs and a tail, and their story may not be  believed. I'm not worrying about them. My chief concern is to drive the  Red Cloud for all she is worth. I want to explain some things back  there in Shopton.\"    As if repenting of the way it had misbehaved over the forest fire, the  airship was now swinging along at a rapid rate. Seated in the cabin the  travelers would have really enjoyed the return trip had it not been for  the accusation hanging over them. The weather was fine and clear, and  as they skimmed along, now and then coming out from the clouds, they  caught glimpses below them of the earth above which they were  traveling. They had a general idea of their location, from knowing the  town where the paper had given them such astounding news, and it was  easy to calculate their rate of progress.    After running about a hundred miles or so, at high speed Mr. Sharp  found it necessary to slow down the motor, as some of the new bearings  were heating. Still this gave them no alarm, as they were making good  time. They came to a stop that night, and calculated that by the next  evening, or two at the latest, they would be back in Shopton. But they  did not calculate on an accident.    One of the cylinders on the big motor cracked, as they started up next  morning, and for some hours they had to hang in the air, suspended by  the gas in the container, while Mr. Sharp and Tom took out the damaged  part, and put in a spare one, the cylinders being cast separately. It  was dusk when they finished, and too late to start up, so they remained  about in the same place until the next day.    Morning dawned with a hot humidness, unusual at that time of the year,  but partly accounted for by the fact that they were still within the  influence of the southern climate. With a whizz the big propellers were  set in motion, and, with Tom at the wheel, the ship being about three  miles in the air, to which height it had risen after the repairs were  made, the journey was recommenced.    \"It's cooler up here than down below,\" remarked Tom, as he shifted the  wheel and rudder a bit, in response to a gust of wind, that heeled the  craft over.    \"Yes, I think we're going to have a storm,\" remarked Mr. Sharp, eyeing  the clouds with a professional air. \"We may run ahead of it, or right  into it. We'll go down a bit, toward night, when there's less danger of  being shot.\"    So far, on their return trip, they had not been low enough, in the day  time, to be in any danger from persons who hoped to earn the five  thousand dollars reward.    The afternoon passed quickly, and it got dark early. There was a  curious hum to the wind, and, hearing it, Mr. Sharp began to go about  the ship, seeing that everything was fast and taut.    \"We're going to have a blow,\" he remarked, \"and a heavy one, too.  We'll have to make everything snug, and be ready to go up or down, as  the case calls for.\"    \"Up or down?\" inquired Mr. Damon.    \"Yes. By rising we may escape the blow, or, by going below the strata  of agitated air, we may escape it.\"    \"How about rain?\"    \"Well, you can get above rain, but you can't get below it, with the law  of gravitation working as it does at present. How's the gas generator,  Tom?\"    \"Seems to be all right,\" replied the young inventor, who had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3008"],[0,"The Jargon File, Version 4.2.2, 20 Aug 2000 (#19)"],[1,"variable, Next:[1021]bamf, Previous:[1022]baggy     pantsing, Up:[1023]= B =       balloonian variable n.

In [1059]elder     days this was considered a CMUish usage, with MIT and Stanford hackers     preferring [1060]excl or [1061]shriek; but the spread of Unix has     carried `bang' with it (esp. via the term [1062]bang path) and it is     now certainly the most common spoken name for !. Note that it is used     exclusively for non-emphatic written !; one would not say     \"Congratulations bang\" (except possibly for humorous purposes), but if     one wanted to specify the exact characters `foo!' one would speak \"Eff     oh oh bang\".

[now historical] An old-style UUCP electronic-mail address specifying     hops to get from some assumed-reachable location to the addressee, so     called because each [1073]hop is signified by a [1074]bang sign. Thus,     for example, the path ...!bigsite!foovax!barbox!me directs people to     route their mail to machine bigsite (presumably a well-known location     accessible to everybody) and from there through the machine foovax to     the account of user me on barbox.       In the bad old days of not so long ago, before autorouting mailers     became commonplace, people often published compound bang addresses     using the { } convention (see [1075]glob) to give paths from several     big machines, in the hopes that one's correspondent might be able to     get mail to one of them reliably (example: ...!{seismo, ut-sally,     ihnp4}!rice!beta!gamma!me). Bang paths of 8 to 10 hops were not     uncommon in 1981. Late-night dial-up UUCP links would cause week-long     transmission times. Bang paths were often selected by both     transmission time and reliability, as messages would often get lost.
