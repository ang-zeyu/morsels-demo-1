Close on the heels of the Fizzer came other travellers, with the news  that the horse teams had got going and the Macs had \"pulled out\" to the  Four Mile. \"Your trunks'll be along in no time now, missus,\" one of them  said. \"They've got 'em all aboard.\"    The Dandy did some rapid calculations: \"Ten miles a day on good roads,\"  he said: \"one hundred and seventy miles. Tens into that seventeen  days. Give 'em a week over for unforeseen emergencies, and call it  four weeks.\" It sounded quite cheerful and near at hand, but a belated  thunderstorm or two, and consequent bogs, nearly doubled the four weeks.    Almost every day we heard news of the teams from the now constant stream  of travellers; and by the time the timber was all sawn and carted to the  house to fulfil the many promises there, they were at the Katherine.    But if the teams were at the Katherine, so were the teamsters, and so  was the Pub; and when teamsters and a pub get together it generally  takes time to separate them, when that pub is the last for over a  thousand miles. One pub at the Katherine and another at Oodnadatta and  between them over a thousand miles of bush, and desert and dust, and  heat, and thirst. That, from a teamster's point of view, is the Overland  Route from Oodnadatta to the Katherine.    A pub had little attraction for the Sanguine Scot, and provided he could  steer the other Macs safely past the one at the Katherine, there would  be no delay there with the trunks; but the year's stores were on the  horse teams and the station, having learnt bitter experience from the  past, now sent in its own waggon for the bulk of the stores, as soon  as they were known to be at the Katherine; and so the Dandy set off at  once.    \"You'll see me within a fortnight, bar accidents\" he called back, as the  waggon lurched forward towards the slip-rails; and the pub also  having little attraction for the Dandy, we decided to expect him, \"bar  accidents.\" For that matter, a pub had little attraction for any of the  Elsey men, the Quiet Stockman being a total abstainer, and Dan knowing  \"how to behave himself,\" although he owned to having \"got a bit merry  once or twice.\"    The Dandy out of sight, Johnny went back to his work, which happened to  be hammering the curves out of sheets of corrugated iron.    \"Now we shan't be long,\" he shouted, hammering vigorously, and when I  objected to the awful din, he reminded me, with a grin, that it was \"all  in the good cause.\" When \"smoothed out,\" as Johnny phrased it, the iron  was to be used for capping the piles that the house was built upon, \"to  make them little white ants stay at home.\"    \"We'll smooth all your troubles out, if you give us time,\" he shouted,  returning to the hammering after his explanation with even greater  energy. But by dinnertime some one had waddled into our lives who was to  smooth most of the difficulties out of it, to his own, and our complete  satisfaction.    Just as Sam announced dinner a cloud of dust creeping along the horizon  attracted our attention.    \"Foot travellers!\" Dan decided; but something emerged out of the dust,  as it passed through the sliprails, that looked very like a huge mould  of white jelly on horse-back.    Directly it sighted us it rolled off the horse, whether intentionally or  unintentionally we could not say, and leaving the beast to the care of  chance, unfolded two short legs from somewhere and waddled towards us--a  fat, jovial Chinese John Falstaff.    \"Good day, boss! Good day, missus! Good day, all about,\" he said in  cheerful salute, as he trundled towards us like a ship's barrel in full  sail. \"Me new cook, me--\" and then Sam appeared and towed him into port.    \"Well, I'm blest!\" Dan exclaimed, staring after him. \"What HAVE we  struck?\"    But Johnny knew, as did most Territorians. \"You've struck Cheon, that's  all,\" he said. \"Talk of luck! He's the jolliest old josser going.\"    The \"jolliest old josser\" seemed difficult to repress; for already he  had eluded Sam, and, reappearing in the kitchen doorway, waddled across  the thoroughfare towards us.    \"Me new cook!\" he repeated, going on from where he had left off. \"Me  Cheon!\" and then, in queer pidgin-English, he solemnly rolled out a few  of his many qualifications:    \"Me savey all about,\" he chanted. \"Me savey cook 'im, and gard'in', and  milk 'im, and chuckie, and fishin' and shootin' wild duck.\" On and on  he chanted through a varied list of accomplishments, ending up with an  application for the position of cook. \"Me sit down? Eh boss?\" he asked,  moon-faced and serious.    \"Please yourself!\" the Maluka laughed, and with a flash of white teeth  and an infectious chuckle Cheon laughed and nodded back; then, still  chuckling, he waddled away to the kitchen and took possession there,  while we went to our respective dinners, little guessing that the  truest-hearted, most faithful, most loyal old \"josser\" had waddled into  our lives.        CHAPTER XI      Cheon rose at cock-crow (\"fowl-sing-out,\" he preferred to call it), and  began his duties by scornfully refusing Sam's bland offer of instruction  in the \"ways of the homestead.\"    \"Me savey all about,\" he said, with a majestic wave of his hands, after  expressing supreme contempt for Sam's caste and ways; so Sam applied for  his cheque, shook hands all round, and withdrew smilingly.    Sam's account being satisfactorily \"squared,\" Cheon's name was  then formally entered in the station books as cook and gardener, at  twenty-five shillings a week. That was the only vacancy he ever filled  in the books; but in our life at the homestead he filled almost every  vacancy that required filling, and there were many.    There was nothing he could not and did not do for our good, and it was  well that he refused to be instructed in anybody's ways, for his own  were delightfully disobedient and unexpected and entertaining. Not only  had we \"struck the jolliest old josser going,\" but a born ruler and  organiser into the bargain. He knew best what was good for us, and  told us so, and, meekly bending to his will, our orders became mere  suggestions to be entertained and carried out if approved of by Cheon,  or dismissed as \"silly-fellow\" with a Podsnapian wave of his arm if they  in no way appealed to him.    Full of wrath for Sam's ways, and bubbling over with trundling energy,  he calmly appropriated the whole staff, as well as Jimmy, Billy Muck,  and the rejected, and within a week had put backbone into everything  that lacked it, from the water-butts to old Jimmy.    The first two days were spent in a whirlwind of dust and rubbish, turned  out from unguessed-at recesses, and Cheon's jovial humour suiting his  helpers to a nicety, the rubbish was dealt with amid shouts of delight  and enjoyment; until Jimmy, losing his head in his lightness of heart,  dug Cheon in the ribs, and, waving a stick over his head, yelled in mock  fierceness: \"Me wild-fellow, black fellow. Me myall-fellow.\"    Then Cheon came out in a new role. Without a moment's hesitation his  arms and legs appeared to fly out all together in Jimmy's direction,  completely doubling him up.    \"Me myall-fellow, too,\" Cheon said calmly, master of himself and the  situation. Then, chuckling at Jimmy's discomfiture, he went on with his  work, while his helpers stared open-eyed with amazement; an infuriated  Chinese catherine-wheel being something new in the experience of a black  fellow. It was a wholesome lesson, though, and no one took liberties  with Cheon again.    The rubbish disposed of, leaking water-butts, and the ruins of collapsed  water-butts, were carried to the billabong, swelled in the water,  hammered and hooped back into steadfast, reliable water-butts, and  trundled along to their places in a merry, joyous procession.    With Cheon's hand on the helm, cream rose on the milk from somewhere.  The meat no longer turned sour. An expert fisherman was discovered  among the helpers--one Bob by name. Cheon's shot-gun appeared to have  a magnetic attraction for wild duck. A garden sprang up as by magic,  grasshoppers being literally chased off the vegetables. The only thing  we lacked was butter; and after a week of order and cleanliness and  dazzlingly varied menus, we wondered how we had ever existed without  them.    It was no use trying to wriggle from under Cheon's foot once he put it  down. At the slightest neglect of duty, lubras or boys were marshalled  and kept relentlessly to their work until he was satisfied; and woe  betide the lubras who had neglected to wash hands, and pail and cow,  before sitting down to their milking. The very fowls that laid out-bush  gained nothing by their subtlety. At the faintest sound of a cackle,  a dosing lubra was roused by the point of Cheon's toe, as he shouted  excitedly above her: \"Fowl sing out! That way! Catch 'im egg! Go on!\"  pointing out the direction with much pantomime; and as the egg-basket  filled to overflowing, he either chuckled with glee or expressed further  contempt for Sam's ways.    But his especial wrath was reserved for the fowl-roosts over his  sleeping quarters. \"What's 'er matter! Fowl sit down close up kitchen!\"  he growled in furious gutturals, whenever his eyes rested on them; and  as soon as time permitted he mounted to the roof and, boiling over with  righteous indignation, hurled the offending roosts into space.      New roosts were then nailed to the branches of a spreading coolibar  tree, a hundred yards or so to the north of the buildings, the trunk  encircled with zinc to prevent snakes or wild cats from climbing into  the roosts; a movable ladder staircase made, to be used by the fowls at  bedtime, and removed as soon as they were settled for the night, lest  the cats or snakes should make unlawful use of it (Cheon always "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/470"],[0,"Heretics (#19)"],[1,"t.  But the contrast which he  offers between Christianity and Paganism in the matter of moral  ideals--a contrast which he states very ably in a paper called \"How  long halt ye?\" which appeared in the Independent Review--does, I think,  contain an error of a deeper kind.  According to him, the ideal of  Paganism was not, indeed, a mere frenzy of lust and liberty and  caprice, but was an ideal of full and satisfied humanity. According to  him, the ideal of Christianity was the ideal of asceticism. When I say  that I think this idea wholly wrong as a matter of philosophy and  history, I am not talking for the moment about any ideal Christianity  of my own, or even of any primitive Christianity undefiled by after  events.  I am not, like so many modern Christian idealists, basing my  case upon certain things which Christ said. Neither am I, like so many  other Christian idealists, basing my case upon certain things that  Christ forgot to say. I take historic Christianity with all its sins  upon its head; I take it, as I would take Jacobinism, or Mormonism, or  any other mixed or unpleasing human product, and I say that the meaning  of its action was not to be found in asceticism.  I say that its point  of departure from Paganism was not asceticism.  I say that its point of  difference with the modern world was not asceticism. I say that St.  Simeon Stylites had not his main inspiration in asceticism. I say that  the main Christian impulse cannot be described as asceticism, even in  the ascetics.    Let me set about making the matter clear.  There is one broad fact  about the relations of Christianity and Paganism which is so simple  that many will smile at it, but which is so important that all moderns  forget it.  The primary fact about Christianity and Paganism is that  one came after the other.  Mr. Lowes Dickinson speaks of them as if  they were parallel ideals--even speaks as if Paganism were the newer of  the two, and the more fitted for a new age. He suggests that the Pagan  ideal will be the ultimate good of man; but if that is so, we must at  least ask with more curiosity than he allows for, why it was that man  actually found his ultimate good on earth under the stars, and threw it  away again. It is this extraordinary enigma to which I propose to  attempt an answer.    There is only one thing in the modern world that has been face to face  with Paganism; there is only one thing in the modern world which in  that sense knows anything about Paganism: and that is Christianity.  That fact is really the weak point in the whole of that hedonistic  neo-Paganism of which I have spoken. All that genuinely remains of the  ancient hymns or the ancient dances of Europe, all that has honestly  come to us from the festivals of Phoebus or Pan, is to be found in the  festivals of the Christian Church. If any one wants to hold the end of  a chain which really goes back to the heathen mysteries, he had better  take hold of a festoon of flowers at Easter or a string of sausages at  Christmas. Everything else in the modern world is of Christian origin,  even everything that seems most anti-Christian. The French Revolution  is of Christian origin.  The newspaper is of Christian origin. The  anarchists are of Christian origin.  Physical science is of Christian  origin.  The attack on Christianity is of Christian origin. There is  one thing, and one thing only, in existence at the present day which  can in any sense accurately be said to be of pagan origin, and that is  Christianity.    The real difference between Paganism and Christianity is perfectly  summed up in the difference between the pagan, or natural, virtues, and  those three virtues of Christianity which the Church of Rome calls  virtues of grace.  The pagan, or rational, virtues are such things as  justice and temperance, and Christianity has adopted them. The three  mystical virtues which Christianity has not adopted, but invented, are  faith, hope, and charity.  Now much easy and foolish Christian rhetoric  could easily be poured out upon those three words, but I desire to  confine myself to the two facts which are evident about them.  The  first evident fact (in marked contrast to the delusion of the dancing  pagan)--the first evident fact, I say, is that the pagan virtues, such  as justice and temperance, are the sad virtues, and that the mystical  virtues of faith, hope, and charity are the gay and exuberant virtues.  And the second evident fact, which is even more evident, is the fact  that the pagan virtues are the reasonable virtues, and that the  Christian virtues of faith, hope, and charity are in their essence as  unreasonable as they can be.    As the word \"unreasonable\" is open to misunderstanding, the matter may  be more accurately put by saying that each one of these Christian or  mystical virtues involves a paradox in its own nature, and that this is  not true of any of the typically pagan or rationalist virtues. Justice  consists in finding out a certain thing due to a certain man and giving  it to him.  Temperance consists in finding out the proper limit of a  particular indulgence and adhering to that.  But charity means  pardoning what is unpardonable, or it is no virtue at all. Hope means  hoping when things are hopeless, or it is no virtue at all. And faith  means believing the incredible, or it is no virtue at all.    It is somewhat amusing, indeed, to notice the difference between the  fate of these three paradoxes in the fashion of the modern mind.  Charity is a fashionable virtue in our time; it is lit up by the  gigantic firelight of Dickens.  Hope is a fashionable virtue to-day;  our attention has been arrested for it by the sudden and silver trumpet  of Stevenson.  But faith is unfashionable, and it is customary on every  side to cast against it the fact that it is a paradox. Everybody  mockingly repeats the famous childish definition that faith is \"the  power of believing that which we know to be untrue.\" Yet it is not one  atom more paradoxical than hope or charity. Charity is the power of  defending that which we know to be indefensible. Hope is the power of  being cheerful in circumstances which we know to be desperate.  It is  true that there is a state of hope which belongs to bright prospects  and the morning; but that is not the virtue of hope. The virtue of hope  exists only in earthquake and, eclipse. It is true that there is a  thing crudely called charity, which means charity to the deserving  poor; but charity to the deserving is not charity at all, but justice.  It is the undeserving who require it, and the ideal either does not  exist at all, or exists wholly for them. For practical purposes it is  at the hopeless moment that we require the hopeful man, and the virtue  either does not exist at all, or begins to exist at that moment.  Exactly at the instant when hope ceases to be reasonable it begins to  be useful. Now the old pagan world went perfectly straightforward until  it discovered that going straightforward is an enormous mistake. It was  nobly and beautifully reasonable, and discovered in its death-pang this  lasting and valuable truth, a heritage for the ages, that  reasonableness will not do.  The pagan age was truly an Eden or golden  age, in this essential sense, that it is not to be recovered. And it is  not to be recovered in this sense again that, while we are certainly  jollier than the pagans, and much more right than the pagans, there is  not one of us who can, by the utmost stretch of energy, be so sensible  as the pagans. That naked innocence of the intellect cannot be  recovered by any man after Christianity; and for this excellent reason,  that every man after Christianity knows it to be misleading. Let me  take an example, the first that occurs to the mind, of this impossible  plainness in the pagan point of view.  The greatest tribute to  Christianity in the modern world is Tennyson's \"Ulysses.\" The poet  reads into the story of Ulysses the conception of an incurable desire  to wander.  But the real Ulysses does not desire to wander at all. He  desires to get home.  He displays his heroic and unconquerable  qualities in resisting the misfortunes which baulk him; but that is  all. There is no love of adventure for its own sake; that is a  Christian product.  There is no love of Penelope for her own sake; that  is a Christian product.  Everything in that old world would appear to  have been clean and obvious.  A good man was a good man; a bad man was  a bad man.  For this reason they had no charity; for charity is a  reverent agnosticism towards the complexity of the soul. For this  reason they had no such thing as the art of fiction, the novel; for the  novel is a creation of the mystical idea of charity. For them a  pleasant landscape was pleasant, and an unpleasant landscape  unpleasant.  Hence they had no idea of romance; for romance consists in  thinking a thing more delightful because it is dangerous; it is a  Christian idea.  In a word, we cannot reconstruct or even imagine the  beautiful and astonishing pagan world. It was a world in which common  sense was really common.    My general meaning touching the three virtues of which I have spoken  will now, I hope, be sufficiently clear. They are all three  paradoxical, they are all three practical, and they are all three  paradoxical because they are practical. it is the stress of ultimate  need, and a terrible knowledge of things as they are, which led men to  set up these riddles, and to die for them. Whatever may be the meaning  of the contradiction, it is the fact that the only kind of hope that is  of any use in a battle is a hope that denies arithmetic.  Whatever may  be the meaning of the contradiction, it is the fact that the only kind  of charity which any weak spirit wants, or which any generous spirit  feels, is the charity which forgives the sins that are like scarlet.  Whatever may be the meaning of faith, it must always mean "]]]
