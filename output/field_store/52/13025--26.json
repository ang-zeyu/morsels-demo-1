[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2849"],[0,"Against Apion (#19)"],[1,"the other Grecians, made  laws about what was to be done, or left undone, but had no regard to the  exercising them thereto in practice.    18. But for our legislator, he very carefully joined these two methods  of instruction together; for he neither left these practical exercises  to go on without verbal instruction, nor did he permit the hearing of  the law to proceed without the exercises for practice; but beginning  immediately from the earliest infancy, and the appointment of every  one's diet, he left nothing of the very smallest consequence to be done  at the pleasure and disposal of the person himself. Accordingly, he made  a fixed rule of law what sorts of food they should abstain from, and  what sorts they should make use of; as also, what communion they  should have with others what great diligence they should use in their  occupations, and what times of rest should be interposed, that, by  living under that law as under a father and a master, we might be guilty  of no sin, neither voluntary nor out of ignorance; for he did not suffer  the guilt of ignorance to go on without punishment, but demonstrated  the law to be the best and the most necessary instruction of all others,  permitting the people to leave off their other employments, and to  assemble together for the hearing of the law, and learning it exactly,  and this not once or twice, or oftener, but every week; which thing all  the other legislators seem to have neglected.    19. And indeed the greatest part of mankind are so far from living  according to their own laws, that they hardly know them; but when they  have sinned, they learn from others that they have transgressed the law.  Those also who are in the highest and principal posts of the government,  confess they are not acquainted with those laws, and are obliged to take  such persons for their assessors in public administrations as profess to  have skill in those laws; but for our people, if any body do but ask any  one of them about our laws, he will more readily tell them all than he  will tell his own name, and this in consequence of our having learned  them immediately as soon as ever we became sensible of any thing, and of  our having them as it were engraven on our souls. Our transgressors of  them are but few, and it is impossible, when any do offend, to escape  punishment.    20. And this very thing it is that principally creates such a wonderful  agreement of minds amongst us all; for this entire agreement of ours  in all our notions concerning God, and our having no difference in our  course of life and manners, procures among us the most excellent concord  of these our manners that is any where among mankind; for no other  people but the Jews have avoided all discourses about God that any way  contradict one another, which yet are frequent among other nations; and  this is true not only among ordinary persons, according as every one  is affected, but some of the philosophers have been insolent enough to  indulge such contradictions, while some of them have undertaken to use  such words as entirely take away the nature of God, as others of them  have taken away his providence over mankind. Nor can any one perceive  amongst us any difference in the conduct of our lives, but all our works  are common to us all. We have one sort of discourse concerning God,  which is conformable to our law, and affirms that he sees all things;  as also we have but one way of speaking concerning the conduct of our  lives, that all other things ought to have piety for their end; and this  any body may hear from our women, and servants themselves.    21. And, indeed, hence hath arisen that accusation which some make  against us, that we have not produced men that have been the inventors  of new operations, or of new ways of speaking; for others think it a  fine thing to persevere in nothing that has been delivered down from  their forefathers, and these testify it to be an instance of the  sharpest wisdom when these men venture to transgress those traditions;  whereas we, on the contrary, suppose it to be our only wisdom and virtue  to admit no actions nor supposals that are contrary to our original  laws; which procedure of ours is a just and sure sign that our law  is admirably constituted; for such laws as are not thus well made are  convicted upon trial to want amendment.    22. But while we are ourselves persuaded that our law was made agreeably  to the will of God, it would be impious for us not to observe the same;  for what is there in it that any body would change? and what can be  invented that is better? or what can we take out of other people's laws  that will exceed it? Perhaps some would have the entire settlement  of our government altered. And where shall we find a better or more  righteous constitution than ours, while this makes us esteem God to be  the Governor of the universe, and permits the priests in general to be  the administrators of the principal affairs, and withal intrusts the  government over the other priests to the chief high priest himself?  which priests our legislator, at their first appointment, did not  advance to that dignity for their riches, or any abundance of other  possessions, or any plenty they had as the gifts of fortune; but he  intrusted the principal management of Divine worship to those that  exceeded others in an ability to persuade men, and in prudence of  conduct. These men had the main care of the law and of the other parts  of the people's conduct committed to them; for they were the priests who  were ordained to be the inspectors of all, and the judges in doubtful  cases, and the punishers of those that were condemned to suffer  punishment.    23. What form of government then can be more holy than this? what more  worthy kind of worship can be paid to God than we pay, where the entire  body of the people are prepared for religion, where an extraordinary  degree of care is required in the priests, and where the whole polity is  so ordered as if it were a certain religious solemnity? For what things  foreigners, when they solemnize such festivals, are not able to observe  for a few days' time, and call them Mysteries and Sacred Ceremonies, we  observe with great pleasure and an unshaken resolution during our whole  lives. What are the things then that we are commanded or forbidden? They  are simple, and easily known. The first command is concerning God, and  affirms that God contains all things, and is a Being every way perfect  and happy, self-sufficient, and supplying all other beings; the  beginning, the middle, and the end of all things. He is manifest in  his works and benefits, and more conspicuous than any other being  whatsoever; but as to his form and magnitude, he is most obscure. All  materials, let them be ever so costly, are unworthy to compose an image  for him, and all arts are unartful to express the notion we ought to  have of him. We can neither see nor think of any thing like him, nor is  it agreeable to piety to form a resemblance of him. We see his works,  the light, the heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon, the waters, the  generations of animals, the productions of fruits. These things hath God  made, not with hands, nor with labor, nor as wanting the assistance of  any to cooperate with him; but as his will resolved they should be made  and be good also, they were made and became good immediately. All  men ought to follow this Being, and to worship him in the exercise of  virtue; for this way of worship of God is the most holy of all others.    24. There ought also to be but one temple for one God; for likeness is  the constant foundation of agreement. This temple ought to be common to  all men, because he is the common God of all men. High priests are to  be continually about his worship, over whom he that is the first by his  birth is to be their ruler perpetually. His business must be to offer  sacrifices to God, together with those priests that are joined with him,  to see that the laws be observed, to determine controversies, and to  punish those that are convicted of injustice; while he that does not  submit to him shall be subject to the same punishment, as if he had been  guilty of impiety towards God himself. When we offer sacrifices to him,  we do it not in order to surfeit ourselves, or to be drunken; for  such excesses are against the will of God, and would be an occasion of  injuries and of luxury; but by keeping ourselves sober, orderly, and  ready for our other occupations, and being more temperate than others.  And for our duty at the sacrifices [22] themselves, we ought, in the  first place, to pray for the common welfare of all, and after that for  our own; for we are made for fellowship one with another, and he who  prefers the common good before what is peculiar to himself is above all  acceptable to God. And let our prayers and supplications be made humbly  to God, not [so much] that he would give us what is good, [for he  hath already given that of his own accord, and hath proposed the same  publicly to all,] as that we may duly receive it, and when we have  received it, may preserve it. Now the law has appointed several  purifications at our sacrifices, whereby we are cleansed after  a funeral, after what sometimes happens to us in bed, and after  accompanying with our wives, and upon many other occasions, which it  would be too long now to set down. And this is our doctrine concerning  God and his worship, and is the same that the law appoints for our  practice.    25. But, then, what are our laws about marriage? That law owns no other  mixture of sexes but that which nature hath appointed, of a man with his  wife, and that this be used only for the procreation of children. But it  abhors the mixture of a male with a male; and if any one do that, death  is its punishment. It commands us also, when we marry, not to have  regard to portion, nor to take a woman by violence, nor to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28491"],[0,"Dishes & Beverages of the Old South (#19)"],[1,"Soup_: Cut into joints two fat chickens three parts grown,  salt and pepper, and lay aside while you fry in a deep pot half a pound  streaky bacon. Take out when crisp, put in the chicken, turning it so as  to brown it all over. Put in a thick slice of ham, let it also brown a  bit, do the same with four sliced onions--mild ones--then add two  gallons cold water, half a teaspoonful salt, two pods red pepper, a  dozen whole pepper corns, and two sprigs of parsley. Keep at a gentle  boil for an hour, then put in two small heads of tender cabbage finely  shredded, and six white potatoes, peeled and sliced a quarter-inch  thick. Fifteen minutes later put in a quart of string beans, broken  short, a pint of shelled lima beans, a stalk of celery cut fine  lengthwise, and a dozen tomatoes, peeled and sliced. Follow them in ten  minutes with a pint of tender okra sliced--next add a little later the  pulp from a dozen ears of green corn, slit lengthwise and scraped. Stir  almost constantly with a long-handled skimmer, after the corn pulp is  in. If the skimmer brings up chicken bones, throw them aside. Just  before serving put in a large spoonful of butter, rolled in flour.  Taste, add salt if required. Serve very hot with corn hoe cake and cider  just beginning to sparkle. If there is soup enough for everybody,  nothing else will be wanted.    _Black Turtle Bean Soup_: Pick and wash clean, one quart black turtle  beans, soak overnight in three quarts cold water, and put on to boil  next morning in the soaking water. When it boils add three onions  sliced, one carrot scraped and cut up, a stalk or so of celery, three  sprigs of parsley, and one tomato, fresh or canned. Boil slowly four to  five hours, until the beans are tender, filling up with cold water as  that in the kettle wastes. When the beans are very soft, strain all  through a fine collander, mashing through beans and vegetables, add a  quart of very good soup stock, also a bay leaf, and boil up hard half a  minute before serving. Put into each soup plate a slice of lemon, a  slice of hard-boiled egg, and a tablespoonful of sherry wine before  adding the soup.    _Gumbo_: Cut a tender, fat chicken, nearly grown, into joints, season  well with salt and pepper, and fry for ten minutes in the fat from half  a pound of bacon, with two thick slices of ham. Then add two onions  chopped fine, six large ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped, adding with  them their juice, half a large pod of mild red pepper, cut small, a  teaspoonful of minced thyme and parsley mixed, a pint of tender sliced  okra, stemmed and cut lengthwise. Cook altogether, watching all the  time, and stirring constantly to prevent scorching until everything is  well-browned. Then add three quarts fresh-boiled water, on the full  boil, set the pot where it will barely simmer, and cook an hour longer,  taking the same pains against scorching. Rice to eat with the gumbo--it  must never be cooked in the pot--needs to be washed until the water runs  clear from it, drained, then tossed into a wide kettle of water on the  bubbling boil, and cooked for twenty minutes. The water must be salted  to taste. Drain the rice in a collander, set it after draining in the  oven for a minute. The grains should stand out separate, but be very  tender. Rice thus cooked, and served with plenty of butter, is excellent  as a vegetable.    _Wedding Salad_: Roast unstuffed, three young tender turkeys, or six  full grown chickens. Take the white meat only, cut it fine with shears,  cutting across the grain, while hot. Let cool, then mix it with ten  hearts of crisp celery cut in bits, two heads of tender white cabbage,  finely chopped, rejecting hard stalks--use three heads if very  small--and set in a cool place. For the dressing boil thirty fresh eggs  twenty minutes, throw in cold water, shell, take out the yolks, saving  the white for garnishing, mash the yolks while hot very smooth with a  pound and a half of best butter, season them well with salt, pepper, a  little dry mustard, celery seed, and, if at hand, a dash of walnut  catsup, but not enough to discolor. Add also a teaspoonful of  sugar--this to blend flavors only. Add a little at a time enough warm  vinegar to make as thick as cream. Chill, and pour over the salad, mix  well through, then heap it in a big glass bowl, lined with partly white  lettuce leaves, make a wreath of leaves around the top, and in serving,  lay a larger lettuce leaf on each plate, filling it with the  yellow-white salad.    _Fruit Salad_: Wash well a very ripe juicy pineapple, let dry, then  shred with a fork, holding the crown in the left hand firmly, while you  pull away sections with the fork in the right. Thus you avoid taking any  of the hard center. Peel the sections delicately after they are  separated, and cut them in long thin slivers, with the grain. Arrange  these slivers star-shape upon lettuce leaves in the plates, lay a very  narrow slip of pimento--sweet red pepper,--between each two of them,  then fill in the points of the stars with grape-fruit pulp, freed of  skin and seed, and broken into convenient sized bits. Lay more pimento  strips upon it. Set on ice till ready to serve, then drench with sweet  French dressing.    _Sweet French Dressing_: Mix well a scant teaspoonful of granulated  sugar, the same of dry mustard, half a teaspoonful salt, as much black  pepper and paprika mixed, put in the bottom of a deep small bowl, and  stir for two minutes. Wet with claret vinegar, adding it gradually, and  stirring smooth. Make as thick as cream. Add twenty drops tabasco,  twenty drops onion juice, the strained juice of half a lemon, and half a  teaspoonful of brandy, rum or whiskey. Mix well, then add, tablespoonful  at a time, a gill of salad oil, stirring hard between spoonfuls. Put in  more vinegar, more oil--the seasoning suffices for half a pint of  dressing. Stir till it thickens--it should be like an emulsion when  poured upon the salad. Keep on ice. The oil and vinegar will separate,  but the dressing can be brought back by stirring hard.    _Banana and Celery Salad_: Chill heart celery and very ripe bananas,  slice thin crosswise, mingling the rounds well. Pile on lettuce leaves,  and cover with French dressing, into which finely grated cheese has been  scantly stirred. This dressing with cheese is fine for tender Romaine,  also for almost any sort of cooked vegetable used as salad.    _Red and White Salad_: Make cups from lettuce hearts, fasten them to the  plate, with a drop of melted butter, fill lightly with grape-fruit pulp,  and set a tiny red beet, boiled tender, in the middle. Have a very sharp  French dressing made with oil lemon juice and Tarragon vinegar. Pass  with this cheese straws, or toasted cracker sprinkled lightly with  Parmesan cheese.    _Pineapple Salad_: Pare and core a very ripe, sweet pineapple, cut in  slices crosswise, lay the slices in a bowl, with a sprinkle of sugar,  half a cup rum or sherry, all the juice shed in cutting up, and a grate  of nutmeg. Let stand till morning, cool, but not on ice. Make rosettes  of small lettuce leaves in the plates, lay a slice of pineapple on each,  fill the hole in the center with pink pimento cheese. Make the cheese  into a ball the size of a marble, and stick in it a tiny sprig of celery  top. Put a little of the syrup from the bowl in each plate, then finish  with very sharp French dressing. Make the pimento cheese by grinding  fine half a can of pimento, and mixing it through two cakes of cream  cheese, softening the cheese with French dressing, and seasoning it to  taste.    _Cold Slaw_: (V. Moroso.) Shave very fine half a medium sized head of  tender cabbage, put in a bowl, and cover with this dressing. Melt over  hot water a heaping tablespoonful of butter, with two tablespoonfuls  sugar, a saltspoon of pepper, a teaspoonful of salt, dash of red pepper,  and scant teaspoonful dry mustard. Mix smooth, then add gradually four  tablespoonfuls vinegar, mix well, then put in the yolk of a raw egg,  beating it in hard. Cook till creamy, but not too thick. Take from  fire, and add if you like, two tablespoonfuls cream, but it is not  essential--the dressing is good without it.    _Tomato Soy_: Take one gallon solid, ripe tomatoes, peeled and sliced,  or four canfuls put up in glass, put in a preserving kettle with a quart  of sliced onions, two tablespoonfuls salt, as much moist sugar,  teaspoonful black pepper, saltspoon paprika, four hearts of celery cut  fine, a tablespoonful of pounded cloves, alspice, mace, grated nutmeg,  and cinnamon mixed. Stir well together and cook slowly, taking care not  to burn, until reduced one-half. Dry mustard or mustard seed can be  added, but many palates do not relish them. After boiling down add a  quart of very sharp vinegar, stir well through, skim if froth rises,  bottle hot, and seal. This keeps a long time in a dark cool place.    _Table Mustard_: Mix well together two tablespoonfuls dry mustard, scant  teaspoon sugar, half a teaspoon salt. Wet smooth, to a very stiff paste  with boiling water, then add either a teaspoon of onion juice, or a  clove of garlic mashed, stir well through, add little by little, a  tablespoonful olive oil, then thin, with very sharp vinegar, added  gradually so as not to lump nor curdle, to the consistency of thin  cream. Put in a glass jar, seal tight and let stand a week. A month is  better--indeed, the mustard improves with age if not permitted to dry  up.    _Cabbage Pickle_: Shred enough tender cabbage to make four quarts, put  with it four large green tomatoes, sliced thin, six large onions,  chopped fine, three green peppers also chopped, rejecting the seed, two  ounces white mustard seed, half-ounce celery seed, quarter-ounce  turmeric, three tablespoonfuls salt, two pounds white sugar, two quarts  vinegar. Put all in a preserving kettle, set it upon an asbestos mat  over a slow fire, and cook gently for several hours,"]]]
