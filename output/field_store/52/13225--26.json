We must not try to explain too many events by the principle of  fatality adopted by so many historians.  I have elsewhere  discussed the significance of such fatalities, and have shown  that the whole effort of civilisation consists in trying to  escape therefrom.  Certainly history is full of necessities, but  it is also full of contingent facts which were, and might not  have been.  Napoleon himself, on St. Helena, enumerated six  circumstances which might have checked his prodigious career.  He  related, notably, that on taking a bath at Auxonne, in 1786, he  only escaped death by the fortuitous presence of a sandbank.  If  Bonaparte had died, then we may admit that another general would  have arisen, and might have become dictator.  But what would have  become of the Imperial epic and its consequences without  the man of genius who led our victorious armies into all the  capitals of Europe?    It is permissible to consider the Revolution as being partly a  necessity, but it was above all--which is what the fatalistic  writers already cited do not show us--a permanent struggle  between theorists who were imbued with a new ideal, and the  economic, social, and political laws which ruled mankind, and  which they did not understand.  Not understanding them, they  sought in vain to direct the course of events, were exasperated  at their failure, and finally committed every species of  violence.  They decreed that the paper money known as assignats  should be accepted as the equivalent of gold, and all their  threats could not prevent the fictitious value of such money  falling almost to nothing.  They decreed the law of the maximum,  and it merely increased the evils it was intended to remedy.  Robespierre declared before the Convention ``that all the sans-  culottes will be paid at the expense of the public treasury,  which will be fed by the rich,'' and in spite of requisitions and  the guillotine the treasury remained empty.    Having broken all human restraints, the men of the Revolution  finally discovered that a society cannot live without them; but  when they sought to create them anew they saw that even the  strongest society, though supported by the fear of the  guillotine, could not replace the discipline which the past had  slowly built up in the minds of men.  As for understanding the  evolution of society, or judging men's hearts and minds, or  foreseeing the consequences of the laws they enacted, they  scarcely attempted to do so.    The events of the Revolution did not ensue from  irreducible necessities.  They were far more the consequence of  Jacobin principles than of circumstances, and might have been  quite other than they were.  Would the Revolution have followed  the same path if Louis XVI. had been better advised, or if the  Constituent Assembly had been less cowardly in times of popular  insurrection?  The theory of revolutionary fatality is only  useful to justify violence by presenting it as inevitable.    Whether we are dealing with science or with history we must  beware of the ignorance which takes shelter under the shibboleth  of fatalism Nature was formerly full of a host of fatalities  which science is slowly contriving to avoid.  The function of the  superior man is, as I have shown elsewhere, to avert such  fatalities.      3.  The Hesitations of recent Historians of the Revolution.      The historians whose ideas we have examined in the preceding  chapter were extremely positive in their special pleading.  Confined within the limits of belief, they did not attempt to  penetrate the domain of knowledge.  A monarchical writer was  violently hostile to the Revolution, and a liberal writer was its  violent apologist.    At the present time we can see the commencement of a movement  which will surely lead to the study of the Revolution as one of  those scientific phenomena into which the opinions and beliefs of  a writer enter so little that the reader does not even suspect  them.    This period has not yet come into being; we are still in the  period of doubt.  The liberal writers who used to be so positive  are now so no longer.  One may judge of this new state of  mind by the following extracts from recent authors:--    M. Hanotaux, having vaunted the utility of the Revolution, asks  whether its results were not bought too dearly, and adds:--    ``History hesitates, and will, for a long time yet, hesitate to  answer.''    M. Madelin is equally dubious in the book he has recently  published:--    ``I have never felt sufficient authority to form, even in my  inmost conscience, a categorical judgment on so complex a  phenomenon as the French Revolution.  To-day I find it even more  difficult to form a brief judgement.  Causes, facts, and  consequences seem to me to be still extremely debatable  subjects.''    One may obtain a still better idea of the transformation of the  old ideas concerning the Revolution by perusing the latest  writings of its official defenders.  While they professed  formerly to justify every act of violence by representing it as a  simple act of defence, they now confine themselves to pleading  extenuating circumstances.  I find a striking proof of this new  frame of mind in the history of France for the use of schools,  published by MM. Aulard and Debidour.  Concerning the Terror we  read the following lines:--    ``Blood flowed in waves; there were acts of injustice and crimes  which were useless from the point of view of national defence,  and odious.  But men had lost their heads in the tempest, and,  harassed by a thousand dangers, the patriots struck out in their  rage.''    We shall see in another part of this work that the first of the  two authors whom I have cited is, in spite of his  uncompromising Jacobinism, by no means indulgent toward the men  formerly qualified as the ``Giants of the Convention.''    The judgments of foreigners upon our Revolution are usually  distinctly severe, and we cannot be surprised when we remember  how Europe suffered during the twenty years of upheaval in  France.    The Germans in particular have been most severe.  Their opinion  is summed up in the following lines by M. Faguet:--    ``Let us say it courageously and patriotically, for patriotism  consists above all in telling the truth to one's own country:  Germany sees in France, with regard to the past, a people who,  with the great words `liberty' and `fraternity' in its mouth,  oppressed, trampled, murdered, pillaged, and fleeced her for  fifteen years; and with regard to the present, a people who, with  the same words on its banners, is organising a despotic,  oppressive, mischievous, and ruinous democracy, which none would  seek to imitate.  This is what Germany may well see in France;  and this, according to her books and journals, is, we may assure  ourselves, what she does see.''    For the rest, whatever the worth of the verdicts pronounced upon  the French Revolution, we may be certain that the writers of the  future will consider it as an event as passionately interesting  as it is instructive.    A Government bloodthirsty enough to guillotine old men of eighty  years, young girls, and little children: which covered France  with ruins, and yet succeeded in repulsing Europe in arms; an  archduchess of Austria, Queen of France, dying on the  scaffold, and a few years later another archduchess, her  relative, replacing her on the same throne and marrying a sub-  lieutenant, turned Emperor--here are tragedies unique in human  history.  The psychologists, above all, will derive lessons from  a history hitherto so little studied by them.  No doubt they will  finally discover that psychology can make no progress until it  renounces chimerical theories and laboratory experiments in order  to study the events and the men who surround us.[7]        [7] This advice is far from being banal.  The psychologists of  the day pay very little attention to the world about them, and  are even surprised that any one should study it.  I have come  across an interesting proof of this indifferent frame of mind in  a review of one of my books which appeared in the Revue  philosophique and was inspired by the editor of the review.  The  author reproaches me with ``exploring the world and the  newspapers rather than books.''    I most gladly accept this reproach.  The manifold facts of the  journals and the realities of the world are far more instructive  than philosophical lucubrations such as the Revue is stuffed  with.    Philosophers are beginning to see the puerility of such  reproaches.  It was certainly of the forty volumes of this  fastidious publication that Mr. William James was thinking when  he wrote that all these dissertations simply represented ``a  string of facts clumsily observed and a few quarrelsome  discussions.''  Although he is the author of the best known  treatise on psychology extant, the eminent thinker realises ``the  fragility of a science that oozes metaphysical criticism at every  joint.''  For more than twenty years I have tried to interest  psychologists in the study of realities, but the stream of  university metaphysics is hardly yet turned aside, although it  has lost its former force        4.  Impartiality in History.      Impartiality has always been considered as the most essential  quality of the historian.  All historians since Tacitus have  assured us that they are impartial.    In reality the writer sees events as the painter sees a  landscape--that is, through his own temperament; through his  character and the mind of the race.    A number of artists, placed before the same landscape, would  necessarily interpret it in as many different fashions.  Some  would lay stress upon details neglected by others.  Each  reproduction would thus be a personal work--that is to say, would  be interpreted by a certain form of sensibility.    It is the same with the writer.  We can no more speak of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44896"],[0,"The Autobiography of Parley Parker Pratt (#19)"],[1,"of  anxiety indescribable. Every officer of the peace had abandoned us  to our fate; and it seemed as if there was no alternative but for  men, women and children to be exterminated. As we rode on,  ruminating upon these things, a man met us from Independence, who  told us there was a battle raging when he left; and how it had  terminated he knew not.    This only heightened out feelings of anxiety and suspense. We  were every instant drawing nearer to the spot where we might find  our friends alive and victorious, or dead, or perhaps in bondage,  in the hands of a worse than savage enemy.    On coming within four miles of Independence, we ventured to  inquire the distance at a certain house; this we did in order to  pass as strangers, and also, in hopes to learn some news; the man  seemed frightened, and inquired where we were from. We replied,  from Lexington. Said he, \"Have you heard what has happened?\" We  replied, \"That we had heard there was some difficulty, but of all  the participants we had not been informed.\" \"Why,\" said he, \"the  Mormons have _riz_, and have killed six men.\"    We then passed on, and as soon as we were out of sight we left  the road and took into the woods.    Taking a circuitous route, through thickets of hazel interwoven  with grape vine, we came in sight of Independence, after some  difficulty and entanglement, and advanced towards it; but seeing  parties of armed men advancing towards us, we wheeled about, and  retreating a distance, turned again into the woods, and galloping  about a half mile, reached the tents of our friends.    But what was our astonishment when we found our brethren without  arms, having surrendered them to the enemy!    The truth was this: The same evening that I dreamed of the  battle, a large body of the outlaws had marched to a certain  settlement, where they had before committed many outrages, and  commenced to unroof dwellings, destroy property, and threaten and  abuse women and children. While some sixty men were thus engaged,  and their horses quietly regaling themselves in the cornfields of  the brethren, about thirty of our men marched upon them, and drove  them from the field. Several were severely if not mortally wounded  on both sides; and one young man of the Church died of his wounds  the next day--his name was Barber.    In the battle brother Philo Dibble, of Ohio, was shot in the  body through his waistband; the ball remained in him. He bled much  inwardly, and, in a day or two his bowels were so filled with blood  and so inflamed that he was about to die, or, rather, he had been  slowly dying from the time he was wounded. The smell of himself had  become intolerable to him and those about him. At length Elder  Newel Knight administered to him, by the laying on of hands, in the  name of Jesus; his hands had scarcely touched his head when he felt  an operation penetrating his whole system as if it had been a  purifying fire. He immediately discharged several quarts of blood  and corruption, among which was the ball with which he had been  wounded. He was instantly healed, and went to work chopping wood.  He remained an able bodied man, a hard worker, and even did  military duty for many years after. He is still living in Davis  County, Utah.    The next morning, Nov. 5, armed men were assembled in  Independence from every part of the county. These joined the  outlaws, and called themselves militia, and placed themselves under  the command of Lieutenant-Governor Boggs and a colonel by the name  of Pitcher. Thus organized, manned and officered, they were a  formidable band of outlaws; capable of murder, or any other  violence or outrage which would accomplish their purpose; which was  to drive the people of the Church from the county, and plunder  their property and possess their lands.    Very early the same morning, several volunteers united their  forces from different branches of the Church and marched towards  Independence, in order to defend their brethren and friends. When  within a short distance from the town they halted, and were soon  informed that the militia were called out for their protection; but  in this they did not place confidence; for they saw that the armed  body congregated had joined with the mobbers and outlaws, and were  one with them to carry out their murderous purposes. On  communicating with the leaders, Boggs and Pitcher, it was found  that there was no alternative but for the Church to leave the  county forthwith, and deliver up their arms, and certain men to be  tried for murder, said to have been committed in the battle the  previous evening.    Rather than have submitted to these outrageous requirements the  saints would willingly have shed their blood; but they knew that if  they resisted this mob, the lies of the designing and the prejudice  of the ignorant would construe their resistance into a violation of  law, and thus bring certain destruction upon them; therefore, they  surrendered their arms and agreed to leave the county forthwith.  The men who were demanded as prisoners were also surrendered and  imprisoned, but were dismissed in a day or two without trial.    A few hours after the surrender we arrived at the camp of our  brethren on our return from Lexington.    The struggle was now over, our liberties were gone, our homes to  be deserted and possessed by a lawless banditti; and all this in  the United States of America.    The sun was then setting, and twelve miles separated me from my  family; but I determined to reach home that night. My horse being  weary I started on foot, and walked through the wilderness in  darkness; avoiding the road lest I should fall into the hands of  the enemy.    I arrived home about the middle of the night, and furnishing my  wife with a horse, we made our escape in safety.    When night again overtook us we were on the bank of the Missouri  River, which divided between Jackson and Clay Counties. Here we  camped for the night, as we could not cross the ferry till morning.  Next morning we crossed the river, and formed an encampment amid  the cottonwoods on its bank.    While we thus made our escape companies of ruffians were ranging  the county in every direction; bursting into houses without fear,  knowing that the people were disarmed; frightening women and  children, and threatening to kill them if they did not flee  immediately. At the head of one of these parties appeared the Rev.  Isaac McCoy (a noted Baptist missionary to the Indians), with gun  in hand, ordering the people to leave their homes immediately and  surrender everything in the shape of arms.    Other pretended preachers of the gospel took part in the  persecution--speaking of the Church as the common enemies of  mankind, and exulting in their afflictions. On Tuesday and  Wednesday nights, the 5th and 6th of November, women and children  fled in every direction. One party of about one hundred and fifty  fled to the prairie, where they wandered for several days, mostly  without food; and nothing but the open firmament for their shelter.  Other parties fled towards the Missouri River. During the  dispersion of women and children, parties were hunting the men,  firing upon some, tying up and whipping others, and some they  pursued several miles.    Thursday, November 7. The shore began to be lined on both sides  of the ferry with men, women and children; goods, wagons, boxes,  provisions, etc., while the ferry was constantly employed; and when  night again closed upon us the cottonwood bottom had much the  appearance of a camp meeting. Hundreds of people were seen in every  direction, some in tents and some in the open air around their  fires, while the rain descended in torrents. Husbands were  inquiring for their wives, wives for their husbands; parents for  children, and children for parents. Some had the good fortune to  escape with their families, household goods, and some provisions;  while others knew not the fate of their friends, and had lost all  their goods. The scene was indescribable, and, I am sure, would  have melted the hearts of any people on the earth, except our blind  oppressors, and a blind and ignorant community.    Next day our company still increased, and we were principally  engaged in felling cottonwood trees and erecting them into small  cabins. The next night being clear, we began to enjoy some degree  of comfort.    About two o'clock the next morning we were called up by the cry  of signs in the heavens. We arose, and to our great astonishment  all the firmament seemed enveloped in splendid fireworks, as if  every star in the broad expanse had been hurled from its course,  and sent lawless through the wilds of ether. Thousands of bright  meteors were shooting through space in every direction, with long  trains of light following in their course. This lasted for several  hours, and was only closed by the dawn of the rising sun. Every  heart was filled with joy at this majestic display of signs and  wonders, showing the near approach of the coming of the Son of God.    All our goods, were left behind; but I obtained some of them  afterwards at the risk of my life. But all my provisions for the  winter were destroyed or stolen, and my grain left growing on the  ground for my enemies to harvest. My house was afterwards burned,  and my fruit trees and improvements destroyed or plundered. In  short, every member of the society was driven from the county, and  fields of corn were ravaged and destroyed; stacks of wheat burned,  household goods plundered, and improvements and every kind of  property destroyed. One of this banditti afterwards boasted to one  of the brethren that, according to their own account of the matter,  the number of houses burned was two hundred and three.    The Saints who fled took refuge in the adjoining counties,  mostly in Clay County, which received them with some degree of  kindness. Those who fled to the county of Van Buren were again  driven"]]]
