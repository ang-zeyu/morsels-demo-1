[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46202"],[0,"A New Witness for God (Volume 1 of 3) (#19)"],[1,"by Messiah and his apostles--that of a burial  and resurrection--of a death and birth--a death unto sin, a birth  unto righteousness. It is one of those innovations which changed an  ordinance of the everlasting covenant. [20]    About the same time that the form of administering baptism was changed  it began to be misapplied, that is, it was administered to infants.  Just when this custom came into vogue may not be determined, but  clearly it has no warrant for its existence either in the doctrine or  practice of the apostles or any New Testament writer. No truth is more  plainly taught by the apostles than that baptism is for the remission  of sins, and must be preceded by faith and repentance; and as infants  are incapable of sin, and of exercising faith, or of repenting,  evidently they are not fit subjects for baptism.    Still it became the custom in the latter part of the second century or  early in the third to baptize infants. In the year 253 A. D., a council  of sixty bishops, in Africa--at which Cyprian, bishop of Carthage,  presided--considered the question whether infants should be baptized  within two or three days after birth, or whether baptism should be  deferred until the eighth day, as was the custom of the Jews in respect  to circumcision. The council decided that they should be baptized at  once, within a day or two after birth. [21] It will be observed that  the question was not as to whether infants should be baptized or not,  but when they should be baptized, within a day or two after birth or  not until they were eight days old.    The matter was treated in the council as if infant baptism was a custom  of long standing. This proves, not that infant baptism is a correct  doctrine, or that it was derived from the teachings of the apostles--as  some aver [22]--but that in a century or so after the introduction of  the gospel, men began to pervert it by changing and misapplying its  ordinances. The false doctrine of infant baptism is now practiced by  nearly all so-called Christian churches, Catholic and Protestant.    Much as the simple rite of baptism was burdened with useless  ceremonies, changed in its form and misapplied, it was not more  distorted than was the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. The nature of  the sacrament--usually called Eucharist--and the purposes for which  it was instituted are so plain that he who runs may read. From Paul's  description of the ordinance, it is clear' that the broken bread was  intended to be an emblem of the Messiah's broken body; the wine an  emblem of his blood, shed for sinful man; and his disciples were to  eat the one and drink the other in remembrance of him until he should  return; and by this ceremony show forth the Lord's death. [23] It was  designed as a memorial of Messiah's great atonement for mankind, a  token and witness unto the Father that the Son was always remembered.  It was to be a sign that those partaking of it were willing to take  upon them the name of Christ, to remember him always and keep his  commandments. In consideration of these things being observed, the  saints were always to have the Spirit of the Lord to be with them.    In this spirit and without great ceremony the sacrament was  administered for some time. But in the third century there were longer  prayers and more ceremony connected with the administration of the  sacrament than in the century preceding. Disputations arose as to the  proper time of administering it. Some considered the morning, others  the afternoon, and some the evening the most suitable time. All were  not agreed either as to how often the ordinance should be celebrated.  Gold and silver vessels were used, and neither those doing penance, nor  those unbaptized, though believers, were permitted to be present at  the celebration of the ordinance; \"which practice, it is well known,  was derived from the pagan mysteries.\" [24] Very much of mystery began  to be associated with it even at an early date. The bread and the  wine through the prayer of consecration were considered to undergo a  mystic change, by which they were converted into and became the very  body and the very blood of Jesus Christ; so that they were no longer  regarded as emblems of Messiah's body and blood, but the body and blood  itself. [25] This is the doctrine of transubstantiation. This dogma  established, it was but a short step to the \"elevation of the host;\"  that is, the elevation of the bread and wine before it was distributed,  so that it might be viewed and worshiped by the people. This was called  the adoration of the symbols. It was idolatry--the worship of the bread  and wine falsely taught to be the Lord Jesus. [26]    Hence came the Mass, or the idea of a sacrifice being connected with  the celebration of the Eucharist. It was held that as Jesus was truly  present in the bread and wine he could be offered up as an oblation to  his Eternal Father. The death of the victim was not supposed to occur  in reality, but mystically, in such a way, however, as to constitute a  true sacrifice, commemorative of that of the cross and not different  from it in essence. The same Victim was present, and offered up by  Christ through his minister the priest. The sacrifice at the cross was  offered with real suffering, true shedding of blood, and real death of  the Victim; in the mass it was taught there was a mystical suffering, a  mystical shedding of blood and a mystical death of the same Victim.    Into such absurdities was the simple sacrament of the Lord's Supper  distorted! When attended with all the pomp and ceremony of splendid  altars, lighted tapers, processions, elevations and chantings; offered  up by the priests and bishops clad in splendid vestments and in the  midst of clouds of incense, accompanied by mystic movements and  genuflections of bishops and priests, the church could congratulate  itself on having removed the reproach at the first fastened upon the  Christians for not having altars and a sacrifice. The mass took away  the reproach; and the new converts to Christianity were accustomed to  see the same rites and ceremonies employed in this mystical sacrifice  of the Son of God as they had seen employed in offering up sacrifices  to the pagan deities.    In time the idea became prevalent that the body and blood of Messiah  were equally and entirely present under each \"species\"--that is,  equally and entirely present in the bread and in the wine; and was  equally and entirely given to the faithful which ever they received.  This idea, of course, rendered it unnecessary to partake of both bread  and wine--hence the practice of communion in one kind. That is, the  sacrament was administered by giving bread alone to the communicant.  To remark that this was changing the ordinance of the sacrament as  instituted by Messiah--suppressing half of it in fact--can scarcely be  necessary, since it is so well known that he administered both bread  and wine when instituting the sacred ordinance. [27]    Thus, through changing the ordinances of the gospel; by misapplying  them in some cases, and adding pagan rites to them in others; by  dragging into the service of the church the ceremonies employed in  heathen temples in the worship of pagan gods; by departing from the  moral law of the gospel, until the pages of Christian church history  are well nigh as dark in immorality, as cruel and bloody as those  that recount the wickedness of pagan Rome; [28] by changing the form  and departing from the spirit of government in the church as fixed  by Jesus, coupled with the corrupting influence of luxury which came  with repose and wealth, together with the destruction visited upon  the noblest and best of the servants and saints of God by the pagan  persecutions which continued through three centuries--all this, I  say, brought to pass the apostasy for which I am contending in these  pages--the destruction of the Church of Christ on earth.

We seldom hear of them after that fatal period  when the Emperor Constantine called himself a Christian; and from a  vain imagination of promoting the Christian cause thereby heaped riches  and power and honor upon Christians in general, but in particular  upon the Christian clergy. From this time they [the spiritual gifts]  almost totally ceased; very few instances of the kind were found. The  cause of this was not (as has been supposed) because there was no more  occasion for them, because all the world was become Christians. This  is a miserable mistake, not a twentieth part of it was then nominally  Christians. The real cause of it was the love of many, almost all  Christians, so-called, was waxed cold. The Christians had no more of  the spirit of Christ than the other heathens. The Son of Man, when he  came to examine his church, could hardly find faith upon earth. This  was the real cause why the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost were  no longer to be found in the Christian Church--because the Christians  were turned heathens again and only had a dead form left.\"--_John  Wesley_ (Wesley's Works, vol. vii, Sermon 89, pages 26, 27).    10. \"That it was proper for the Christian bishops to increase  restraints upon the licentiousness of transgressors will be readily  granted by all who consider the circumstances of those times.

After a time folios were turned into  octavos, and the price cheapened. The 'extraneous Tegg,' as Carlyle  calls the well-known bookseller, and our friends Cooke, Walker, Bell,  and many more, commenced to cut the throat of the trade, and to ruin the  honest author, by printing favourite books at such a very cheap rate  that the public soon became totally demoralized. Cooke made an enormous  fortune--for a book-seller--and died amid the plaudits of the mob and  the curses of his competitors, for he had out-Heroded Herod in  prostituting 'Tom Jones,' a thing deemed impossible, by publishing the  text in numbers, _verbatim et literatim_, at a scandalously cheap price.  Then he approached other 'British novelists' in turn, and went through  the entire pantheon, winding up with a series of sacred classics.  Cooke  was a man of immense resource, and no scruples; he got the author out of  the way (I don't say he murdered him), sold up his rivals, and  positively lived to an advanced age--three crimes which procured him  hosts of enemies, but nevertheless altered the whole system of  publishing, and solved for ever the problem whether it is better or  worse for the producer to sell fifty articles at a penny each, or a  single one of the same kind for four and two.    Now, Cooke's procedure, and that of the other booksellers who were wise  enough to follow his lead, not only had great influence in moulding the  character of the bibliophiles of that day, but is directly responsible  even now for many of those rules and regulations which their descendants  are sticklers in the preservation of.  A folio had always been bound in  a manner suitable to its bulk, and in such a way as to render a new  binding unnecessary for a very long time, and there was, consequently,  little or no necessity for rules of any kind for its preservation.  When  the folio was hoisted to its place, there it would stop, or, if taken  down, it would be with a considerable amount of caution.    Not so Cooke's cheap and easily handled productions.  They were light  and airy, and bound in millboard, which, after a moderate use, never  failed to come to pieces.  As a matter of fact, nearly all Cooke's books  met with on the stalls to-day show unmistakable evidence of honest  handling.  They are thumbed, perhaps torn, and always very feeble in the  cover.  Should it have been worth anyone's while to rebind one of these  cheap little volumes, we may be sure that it will show a stout leather  cover, and be scrupulously cut down to the headlines for the sake of the  shavings.  This cropping of margins was no crime then, because there was  no rule to the contrary, and Cooke turned out his books in such numbers  that they were really of very trifling value at any time.  Before his  day, it was a common practice for the publishers themselves to have  their books bound in leather, and for the binders to cut as much of the  margins away as they decently could.    For instance, let us revert to 'Tom Jones,' one of the first books  experimented upon by the first of really cheap publishers.  When this  novel came out, in 1749, it made its appearance in six small volumes  bound uniformly in leather, with edges more or less cropped.  This  cropping process seems to have pleased Fielding immensely, or at any  rate there is no doubt in the world that he preferred to see his  handiwork issued in the way common to folios, rather than in boards with  ragged edges, for a sample set of volumes was done up in the latter  style and rejected.    We think him foolish, because not very long ago the sample set was  discovered in an old farmhouse, and, after changing hands once or twice,  packed off to the auction-rooms, where it realized the handsome sum of  L69.  A little bit of paper made an immense difference in this case, for  its presence was in conformity with an imperative rule that has grown up  since Fielding's day, and which lays it down that never--no, never--must  a book be denuded of its margins if you wish to make the most of it.  Whatever its quality, do not deprive it of the minutest fraction of its  legitimate area of paper.  Of course, this drastic regulation came into  force when books began to be generally published, not in folio or  quarto, but in a smaller and more handy size.    Collectors, whether of books or anything else, are content at first with  a little.  Their requirements are indeed boundless, so far as number is  concerned; but they have not yet become solicitous of technical or  minute distinctions.  A book is a book, and a coin is a coin, and they  are satisfied without it, provided it is substantially the same as some  other copy of the same edition, or some other coin struck from the same  die, which they happen to have.  After a while, however, a very natural  desire to excel produces its inevitable result, and all sorts of  arbitrary variations are catalogued and insisted upon by those who have  plenty of money, and at the same time pride themselves on their  discrimination and taste.  Thus it is that a comparatively scarce book,  this first edition of 'Tom Jones,' for instance, may become excessively  scarce under exceptional circumstances.  True, the collector who is a  terrible stickler for detail may, and probably will, be charged sooner  or later with being a fool for his pains; but that penalty he is content  to accept, happy in the consciousness, that, when everything is said and  done, he has chosen the better part, which in all these cases consists  in leaving well alone.    Not long ago a London newspaper, which ought to have known better, was  very angry with a collector of the circumspect school because he had  boasted that all the books in his library were 'uncut.'  'This shows,'  said the sage who wrote the article, 'that he has a hundred or more  books which he has never read, and, what is worse, has no intention of  reading.'  He thought that 'uncut' meant 'not cut open,' and perhaps  thinks so still, for it was worth no one's while to teach him his  business, and so the matter dropped.    The cropping of books has, indeed, become as iniquitous as the old Star  Chamber practice of cropping of ears, or perhaps even more so, for some  at least of the delinquents who appeared to the usual Writ of Rebellion,  which it was the practice of that tribunal to issue from time to time,  richly deserved all they got.  The proper way to deal with a book is to  burn it if it be wicked, and if not, to leave it alone; though, if this  fact had always been recognised, there would have been no scope for us  in the matter of broad expanse of margin, since what everybody has no  one craves for.    Fine bindings are a law unto themselves, and require separate  consideration; but there is a matter connected with bindings generally,  or, rather, with the advisability of binding at all, which has created a  considerable amount of scandal in times past.  Let us take that scarce  book, 'The English Dance of Death,' which William Combe wrote in the  safe seclusion of the King's Bench Prison.  It appeared originally in  1815 in parts, each with its wrapper, and afterwards was bound up in two  volumes, whereupon it at once lost, according to present-day ideas on  the subject, five-sixths of its value.    The 'Tale of Two Cities' when in the original eight parts is worth three  times as much, at least, as when in the publisher's cloth binding, and  nearly all Thackeray's more important works are subject to a very  considerable reduction under identical circumstances.  Curiously enough,  the rule is imperative in certain specific instances, while in others it  has no application at all.  The question whether to apply it or not  depends on the character of the book.  We should insist upon the parts  being left unbound in the case of 'Bells and Pomegranates,' but not in  that of Trusler's 1833 edition of 'Hogarth Moralized,' for here the  twenty-six parts are a positive nuisance unless they are bound.  Trusler's melancholy production is not much good, bound or unbound, but  it will serve as an illustration, and certain it is that the cost of  binding will have to be taken into consideration when estimating the  worth of the numbers, in case anyone thrusts them upon a long-suffering  purchaser, and will not be denied.    'Fools you are!' says Sir Ensor Doone, under other circumstances, and  'Idiots!' adds the man in the street when he reads that somebody has  paid a large sum for 'Ask Mamma' in the 'original thirteen parts,' when  he could, had he been so minded, have got the entire book, nicely bound,  for a fourth of the money--plates, text, and all.  This is the cry  whenever a sum which appears exorbitant on the face of it is paid for  anything.    A short time ago L445 was obtained for a fiddle by Stradivari; L798 for  an imperfect silver cup made by Jacob Frolich, master of Nuremberg in  1555; and L246 odd for a rose-point flounce of Venetian lace three yards  long.  Nothing was said about the enormity of these sums, but let a  fiftieth part of the smallest amount be realized at any time for a book  'in parts,' and there is a chorus of disapprobation, for which, however,  it must be confessed, there is just a modicum of warrant.    It is really not at all easy to see why a series of numbers, liable at  any moment to injury, and always inconvenient to handle, should, the  quality of the plates, if there are any, and other accessories being  equal, be so greatly preferred to a volume bound in a proper manner.  Perhaps it is a matter of sentiment, perhaps of pure scarcity, or  perhaps the _bona-fide_ book-collector likes to give himself as much  trouble as he possibly can, by way of purifying his life and chastening  his soul. However this may be, there is no question that some books are  thought more highly of when in sections, and that the public in their  blindness fail to see the reason why.    Well,"]]]
