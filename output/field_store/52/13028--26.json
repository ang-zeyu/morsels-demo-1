We will, if it  please you,\" said he, turning round to me, \"make our abode with you  for a few days--and, after seeing the library of your neighbour, I  will throw down the gauntlet to Philemon, challenging him to answer  certain questions which you may put to us, respecting the number,  rarity, beauty, or utility of those works which relate to the  literature and antiquities of our own country. We shall then see who  is able to return the readiest answer.\" \"Forgive,\" rejoined Philemon,  \"my bantering strain. I revoke my speech. You know that, with  yourself, I heartily love books; more from their contents than their  appearance.\" Lysander returned a gracious smile; and the hectic of  irritability on his cheek was dissipated in an instant.    The approach of evening made us think of settling our plans. My  friends begged their horses might be turned into the field; and that,  while they stayed with me, the most simple fare and the plainest  accommodation might be their lot. They knew how little able I was to  treat them as they were wont to be treated; and, therefore, taking  \"the will for the deed,\" they resolved to be as happy as an humble  roof could make them.    While the cloth was laying for supper (for I should add that we dine  at three and sup at nine), we took a stroll in my small garden, which  has a mound at the bottom, shaded with lilacs and laburnums, that  overlooks a pretty range of meadows, terminated by the village church.  The moon had now gained a considerable ascendancy in the sky; and the  silvery paleness and profound quiet of the surrounding landscape,  which, but an hour ago, had been enlivened by the sun's last rays,  seemed to affect the minds of us all very sensibly. Lysander, in  particular, began to express the sentiments which such a scene excited  in him.--\"Yonder,\" says he, pointing to the church-yard, \"is the  bourne which terminates our earthly labours; and I marvel much how  mortals can spend their time in cavilling at each other--in murdering,  with their pens as well as their swords, all that is excellent and  admirable in human nature--instead of curbing their passions,  elevating their hopes, and tranquillizing their fears. Every evening,  for at least one-third of the year, heaven has fixed in the sky yonder  visible monitor to man. Calmness and splendour are her attendants: no  dark passions, no carking cares, neither spleen nor jealousy, seem to  dwell in that bright orb, where, as has been fondly imagined, \"the  wretched may have rest.\"--\"And here,\" replied Philemon, \"we do nothing  but fret and fume if our fancied merits are not instantly rewarded, or  if another wear a sprig of laurel more verdant than ourselves; I could  mention, within my own recollection, a hundred instances of this  degrading prostitution of talent--aye, a thousand.\"--\"Gently reprimand  your fellow creatures,\" resumed Lysander, \"lest you commit an error as  great as any of those which you condemn in others. The most difficult  of human tasks seems to be the exercise of forbearance and temperance.  By exasperating, you only rekindle, and not extinguish, the evil  sparks in our dispositions. A man will bear being told he is in the  wrong; but you must tell him so gently and mildly. Animosity,  petulance, and persecution, are the plagues which destroy our better  parts.\"--\"And envy,\" replied Philemon, \"has surely enough to  do.\"--\"Yes,\" said Lysander, \"we might enumerate, as you were about to  do, many instances--and (what you were not about to do) pity while we  enumerate! I think,\" continued he, addressing himself particularly to  me, \"you informed me that the husband of poor Lavinia lies buried in  yonder church-yard; and perhaps the very tomb which now glistens by  the moonbeam is the one which consecrates his memory! That man was  passionately addicted to literature;--he had a strong mind; a  wonderful grasp of intellect; but his love of paradox and hypothesis  quite ruined his faculties. NICAS happened to discover some glaring  errors in his last treatise, and the poor man grew sick at heart in  consequence. Nothing short of _infallibility_ and _invincibility_  satisfied him; and, like the Spaniard in the 'Diable Boiteux,' who  went mad because five of his countrymen had been beaten by fifty  Portugese, this unhappy creature lost all patience and forbearance,  because, in an hundred systems which he had built with the cards of  fancy, ninety-nine happened to tumble to the ground.    \"This is the dangerous consequence, not so much of vanity and  self-love as of downright literary Quixotism. A man may be cured of  vanity as the French nobleman was--'Ecoutez messieurs! Monseigneur le  Duc va dire la meillure chose du monde!'[78] but for this raving,  ungovernable passion of soaring beyond all human comprehension, I fear  there is no cure but in such a place as the one which is now before  us. Compared with this, how different was MENANDER'S case! Careless  himself about examining and quoting authorities with punctilious  accuracy, and trusting too frequently to the _ipse-dixits_ of good  friends:--with a quick discernment--a sparkling fancy--great store of  classical knowledge, and a never ceasing play of colloquial wit, he  moved right onwards in his manly course--the delight of the gay, and  the admiration of the learned! He wrote much and variously: but in an  evil hour the demon Malice caught him abroad--watched his  deviations--noted down his failings--and, discovering his vulnerable  part, he did not fail, like another Paris, to profit by the discovery.  Menander became the victim of over-refined sensibility: he need not  have feared the demon, as no good man need fear Satan. His pen ceased  to convey his sentiments; he sickened at heart; and after his body had  been covered by the green grass turf, the gentle elves of fairy-land  took care to weave a chaplet to hang upon his tomb, which was never to  know decay! SYCORAX was this demon; and a cunning and clever demon was  he!\"         [Footnote 78: This is the substance of the story related in       Darwin's _Zoonomia_: vol. iv. p. 81.]    \"I am at a loss,\" said Philemon, \"to comprehend exactly what you  mean?\"--\"I will cease speaking metaphorically,\" replied Lysander; \"but  Sycorax was a man of ability in his way. He taught literary men, in  some measure, the value of careful research and faithful quotation; in  other words, he taught them to speak the truth as they found her; and,  doubtless, for this he merits not the name of a demon, unless you  allow me the priviledge of a Grecian.[79] That Sycorax loved truth  must be admitted; but that he loved no one so much as himself to speak  the truth must also be admitted. Nor had he, after all, any grand  notions of the goddess. She was, in his sight, rather of diminutive  than gigantic growth; rather of a tame than a towering mien; dressed  out in little trinkets, and formally arrayed in the faded point-lace  and elevated toupee of the ancient English school, and not in the  flowing and graceful robes of Grecian simplicity. But his malice and  ill-nature were frightful; and withal his love of scurrility and abuse  quite intolerable. He mistook, in too many instances, the manner for  the matter; the shadow for the substance. He passed his criticisms,  and dealt out his invectives, with so little ceremony, and so much  venom, that he seemed born with a scalping knife in his hand to commit  murder as long as he lived! To him, censure was sweeter than praise;  and the more elevated the rank, and respectable the character of his  antagonist, the more dexterously he aimed his blows, and the more  frequently he renewed his attacks. In consequence, scarcely one  beautiful period, one passionate sentiment of the higher order, one  elevated thought, or philosophical deduction, marked his numerous  writings. 'No garden-flower grew wild' in the narrow field of his  imagination; and, although the words decency and chastity were  continually dropping from his lips, I suspect that the reverse of  these qualities was always settled round his heart.[80] Thus you see,  my dear Philemon,\" concluded Lysander, \"that the love of paradox, of  carelessness, and of malice, are equally destructive of that true  substantial fame which, as connected with literature, a wise and an  honest man would wish to establish.

The engine is  coupled on, and the driver at once turns on the steam ejector,[21]  which sucks all the air out of the pipes and chambers throughout the  train. The air is sucked directly from the under side of the piston  through pipe D; and from the space A A and the cylinder (open at the  top) through the channel C, lifting the ball, which, as soon as  exhaustion is complete, or when the pressure on both sides of the piston  is equal, falls back on its seat. On air being admitted to the train  pipe, it rushes through D and into the space B (Fig. 86) below the  piston, but is unable to pass the ball, so that a strong upward pressure  is exerted on the piston, and the brakes go on. To throw them off, the  space below the piston must be exhausted. This is to be noted: If there  is a leak, as in the case of the train parting, _the brakes go on at  once_, since the vacuum below the piston is automatically broken.    [Illustration: FIG. 87.--Guard's valve for applying the Vacuum brake.]    For ordinary stops the vacuum is only partially broken--that is, an  air-pressure of but from 5 to 10 lbs. per square inch is admitted. For  emergency stops full atmospheric pressure is used. In this case it is  advisable that air should enter at _both_ ends of the train; so in the  guard's van there is installed an ingenious automatic valve, which can  at any time be opened by the guard pressing down a lever, but which  opens of itself when the train-pipe vacuum is rapidly destroyed. Fig. 87  shows this device in section. Seated on the top of an upright pipe is a  valve, _A_, connected by a bolt, B, to an elastic diaphragm, C, sealing  the bottom of the chamber D. The bolt B has a very small hole bored  through it from end to end. When the vacuum is broken slowly, the  pressure falls in D as fast as in the pipe; but a sudden inrush of air  causes the valve A to be pulled off its seat by the diaphragm C, as the  vacuum in D has not been broken to any appreciable extent. Air then  rushes into the train pipe through the valve. It is thus evident that  the driver controls this valve as effectively as if it were on the  engine. These \"emergency\" valves are sometimes fitted to every vehicle  of a train.    When a carriage is slipped, taps on each side of the coupling joint of  the train pipe are turned off by the guard in the \"slip;\" and when he  wishes to stop he merely depresses the lever E, gradually opening the  valve. Under the van is an auxiliary vacuum chamber, from which the air  is exhausted by the train pipe. If the guard, after the slip has parted  from the train, finds that he has applied his brakes too hard, he can  put this chamber into communication with the brake cylinder, and restore  the vacuum sufficiently to pull the brakes off again.    When a train has come to rest, the brakes must be sucked off by the  ejector. Until this has been done the train cannot be moved, so that it  is impossible for it to leave the station unprepared to make a sudden  stop if necessary.      THE WESTINGHOUSE AIR-BRAKE.    This system is somewhat more complicated than the vacuum, though equally  reliable and powerful. Owing to the complexity of certain parts, such as  the steam air-pump and the triple-valve, it is impossible to explain the  system in detail; we therefore have recourse to simple diagrammatic  sketches, which will help to make clear the general principles employed.    The air-brake, as first evolved by Mr. George Westinghouse, was a very  simple affair--an air-pump and reservoir on the engine; a long pipe  running along the train; and a cylinder under every vehicle to work the  brakes. To stop the train, the high-pressure air collected in the  reservoir was turned into the train pipe to force out the pistons in the  coach cylinders, connected to it by short branch pipes. One defect of  this \"straight\" system was that the brakes at the rear of a long train  did not come into action until a considerable time after the driver  turned on the air; and since, when danger is imminent, a very few  seconds are of great importance, this slowness of operation was a  serious fault. Also, it was found that the brakes on coaches near the  engine went on long before those more distant, so that during a quick  stop there was a danger of the forward coaches being bumped by those  behind. It goes without saying that any coaches which might break loose  were uncontrollable. Mr. Westinghouse therefore patented his _automatic_  brake, now so largely used all over the world. The brake ensures  practically instantaneous and simultaneous action on all the vehicles of  _a train of any length_.    [Illustration: FIG. 88.--Diagrammatic sketch of the details of the  Westinghouse air-brake. Brake \"off.\"]    The principle of the brake will be gathered from Figs. 88 and 89. P is a  steam-driven air-pump on the engine, which compresses air into a  reservoir, A, situated below the engine or tender, and maintains a  pressure of from 80 to 90 lbs. per square inch. A three-way cock, C,  puts the train pipe into communication with A or the open air at the  wish of the driver. Under each coach is a triple-valve, T, an auxiliary  reservoir, B, and a brake cylinder, D. The triple-valve is the most  noteworthy feature of the whole system. The reader must remember that  the valve shown in the section is _only diagrammatic_.    Now for the operation of the brake. When the engine is coupled to the  train, the compressed air in the main reservoir is turned into the train  pipe, from which it passes through the triple-valve into the auxiliary  reservoir, and fills it till it has a pressure of, say, 80 lbs. per  square inch. Until the brakes are required, the pressure in the train  pipe must be maintained. If accidentally, or purposely (by turning the  cock C to the position shown in Fig. 89), the train-pipe pressure is  reduced, the triple-valve at once shifts, putting B in connection with  the brake cylinder D, and cutting off the connection between D and the  air, and the brakes go on. To get them off, the pressure in the train  pipe must be made equal to that in B, when the valve will assume its  original position, allowing the air in D to escape.    The force with which the brake is applied depends upon the reduction of  pressure in the train pipe. A slight reduction would admit air very  slowly from B to D, whereas a full escape from the train pipe would open  the valve to its utmost. We have not represented the means whereby the  valve is rendered sensitive to these changes, for the reason given  above.    [Illustration: FIG. 89.--Brake \"on.\"]    The latest form of triple-valve includes a device which, when air is  rapidly discharged from the train pipe, as in an emergency application  of the brake, opens a port through which compressed air is also admitted  from the train pipe _directly_ into D. It will easily be understood that  a double advantage is hereby gained--first, in utilizing a considerable  portion of the air in the train pipe to increase the available brake  force in cases of emergency; and, secondly, in producing a quick  reduction of pressure in the whole length of the pipe, which accelerates  the action of the brakes with extraordinary rapidity.    It may be added that this secondary communication is kept open only  until the pressure in D is equal to that in the train pipe. Then it is  cut off, to prevent a return of air from B to the pipe.    An interesting detail of the system is the automatic regulation of  air-pressure in the main reservoir by the air-pump governor (Fig. 90).  The governor is attached to the steam-pipe leading from the locomotive  boiler to the air-pump. Steam from the boiler, entering at F, flows  through valve 14 and passes by D into the pump, which is thus brought  into operation, and continues to work until the pressure in the main  reservoir, acting on the under side of the diaphragm 9, exceeds the  tension to which the regulating spring 7 is set. Any excess of pressure  forces the diaphragm upwards, lifting valve 11, and allowing compressed  air from the main reservoir to flow into the chamber C. The air-pressure  forces piston 12 downwards and closes steam-valve 14, thus cutting off  the supply of steam to the pump. As soon as the pressure in the  reservoir is reduced (by leakage or use) below the normal, spring 7  returns diaphragm 9 to the position shown in Fig. 90, and pin-valve 11  closes. The compressed air previously admitted to the chamber C escapes  through the small port _a_ to the atmosphere. The steam, acting on the  lower surface of valve 14, lifts it and its piston to the position  shown, and again flows to the pump, which works until the required  air-pressure is again obtained in the reservoir.    [Illustration: FIG. 90.--Air-pump of Westinghouse brake.]      [21] This resembles the upper part of the rudimentary water injector  shown in Fig. 15. The reader need only imagine pipe B to be connected  with the train pipe. A rush of steam through pipe A creates a partial  vacuum in the cone E, causing air from the train pipe to rush into it  and be expelled by the steam blast.          Chapter XI.
