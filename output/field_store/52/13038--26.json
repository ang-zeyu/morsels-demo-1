August 17. 1639.        _Master_ George Grahame _his renouncing and abjuring of Episcopacie._      _The which day was given into the Assembly, direct from_ Master George  Grahame, _sometimes pretended Bishop of_ Orknay, _an abjuration of  Episcopacie, subscribed with his hand, which was publickly read in  audience of the Assembly; and thereafter they ordained the same to be  registrat in the assembly Books_ ad perpetuam rei memoriam, _whereof the  tenor follows._    To all and sundry whom it effects, to whose knowledge these presents shall  come, specially to the reverend and honourable Members of the future  Assembly to be holden at _Edinburgh_, the twelfth day of _August_ 1639.  years: Me Master _George Graham_, sometime pretended bishop of _Orknay_,  being sorry and grieved at my heart that I should ever for any wordly  respect have embraced the order of Episcopacie, the same having no warrand  from the Word of God, and being such an order, as hath had sensibly many  fearful and evill consequences in many parts of Christendome, and  particularly within the Kirk of _Scotland_, as by doleful and deplorable  experience this day is manifest, to have disclaimed, like as I by the  tenor hereof doe altogether disclaime and abjure all Episcopal power and  jurisdiction, with the whole corruptions thereof, condemned by lawful  Assemblies within the said Kirk of _Scotland_, in regard the same is such  an order as is also abjured within the said Kirk, by vertue of that  National Oath with was made in the years 1580. and 1581. promising and  swearing by the great Name of the Lord our God, That I shall never whiles  I live, directly or indirectly, exerce any such power within the Kirk,  neyther yet shall I ever approve or allow the same, not so much as in my  private or publike discourse: But on the contrary, shall stand and adhere  to all the Acts and Constitutions of the late Assembly holden at  _Glasgow_, the 21. of _Novemb._ 1638. last by-past, and shall concurre to  the uttermost of my power, sincerely and faithfully, as occasion shall  offer, in execution the said Acts, and in advancing the Work of  Reformation within this Land, to the glory of God, the peace of the  Countrey, and the comfort and and contentment of all good Christians, as  God shall be my help. In testimony of the which premisses, I have  subscribed thir presents with my hand at _Breeknes_ in _Stronnes_, the  eleventh day of _February_, the year of God 1639. years, before thir  witnesses Master _Walter Stuart_, Minister at _Shoutronnaldsay_, Master  _James Heynd_, Minister at _Kirkwall_, Master _Robert Peirson_, Minister  at _Firth_, and Master _Patrick Grahame_, Minister at _Holme_, my Son.          Sess. 8. August 17. 1639.        _Act containing the Causes and Remedie of the by-gone Evils of this Kirk._      The Kings Majestie having graciously declared, That it is His Royal will  and pleasure, that all questions about Religion, and matters  Ecclesiastical be determined by Assemblies of the Kirk, having also by  publike Proclamation indicted this free national Assembly, for setling the  present distraction of this Kirk, and for establishing a perfect peace,  against such divisions and disordres as have been sore displeasing to his  Majestie, and grievous to all his good Subjects. And now his Majesties  Commissioner _John_ Earle of _Traquair_, intrusted and authorized with a  full Commission, being present, and sitting in this Assembly, now fully  conveened and orderly constitute in all the members thereof, according to  the order of this Kirk, having at large declared His Majesties zeal to the  reformed Religion, and His Royal care and tender affection to this Kirk,  where His Majestie had both His Birth and Baptisme, His great displeasure  at the manifold distractions and divisions of this Kirk and Kingdome, and  His desires to have all our wounds perfectly cured with a fair and  fatherly hand: And although in the way approven by this Kirk, tryal hath  been taken in former Assemblies before from the Kirk registers, to our  full satisfaction, yet the Commissioners Grace making particular enquiry  from the members of the Assembly, now solemnly conveened, concerning the  real and true causes of so many & great evils as this time past had so  sore troubled the peace of this Kirk and Kingdome, It was represented to  his Majesties Commissioner by this Assembly, That beside many other, the  maine and most material causes were, First, The pressing of this Kirk, by  the Prelates with a Service Book, or Book of Common Prayer, without  warrand or direction from the Kirk, and containing beside the Popish frame  thereof, diverse Popish errors and ceremonies, & the seeds of manifold  grosse Superstitions and Idolatry, with a Book of Canons, without warrand  or direction from the general Assembly, establishing tyrannicall power  over the Kirk in the person of Bishops, and overthrowing the whole  discipline & government of the Kirk by Assemblies, with a Book of  Consecration and Ordination, without warrand of Authoritie, Civill or  Ecclesiasticall, appointing offices in the house of God, which are not  warranted by the word of God, and repugnant to the discipline and Acts of  our Kirk, and with the high Commission, erected without the consent of the  Kirk, subverting the jurisdiction and ordinary Judicatories of this Kirk,  and giving to persons meerely Ecclesiasticall, the power of both swords,  and to persons meerly Civill, the power of the Keys and Kirk-sensures. A  second cause was the Articles of _Perth_, _viz._ the observation of  Festivall dayes, kneeling at the Communion, Confirmation, Administration  of the Sacraments in private places, which are brought in by a null  Assembly and are contrary to the Confession of Faith, as it was meant and  subscribed _Anno_ 1580, and divers times since and to the order and  constitutions of this Kirk. Thirdly, the changing of the government of the  Kirk, from the Assemblies of the Kirk to the persons of some Kirkmen,  usurping prioritie and power over their Brethren by the way, and under the  name of Episcopall government against the Confession of Faith, 1580  against the order set downe in the Book of Policy, and against the  intention & constitution of this Kirk from the beginning."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2897"],[0,"The Sequel of Appomattox: A Chronicle of the Reunion of the States (#19)"],[1,"and their appointees were to be paid by the United States, but in  practice the running expenses of reconstruction were paid by the state  treasurers.    Any attempt to favor the Confederate soldiers was frowned upon. Laws  providing wooden legs and free education for crippled Confederates were  suspended. Militia organizations and military schools were forbidden.  No uniform might be worn, no parades were permitted, no memorial and  historical societies were to be organized, and no meeting of any  kind could be held without a permit. The attempt to control the press  resulted in what one general called \"a horrible uproar.\" Editors were  forbidden to express themselves too strongly against reconstruction;  public advertising and printing were awarded only to those papers  actively supporting reconstruction. Several newspapers were suppressed,  a notable example being the \"Tuscaloosa Independent Monitor\", whose  editor, Ryland Randolph, was a picturesque figure in Alabama journalism  and a leader in the Ku Klux Klan.    The military administration was thorough and, as a whole, honest  and efficient. With fewer than ten thousand soldiers, the generals  maintained order and carried on the reconstruction of the South. The  whites made no attempt at resistance, though they were irritated  by military rule and resented the loss of self-government. But most  Southerners preferred the rule of the army to the alternative reign  of the carpetbagger, scalawag, and Negro. The extreme radicals at the  North, on the other hand, were disgusted at the conservative policy of  the generals. The apathy of the whites at the beginning of the military  reconstruction excited surprise on all sides. Not only was there no  violent opposition, but for a few weeks there was no opposition at all.  The civil officials were openly unsympathetic, and the newspapers voiced  dissent not untouched with disgust; others simply could not take the  situation seriously because it seemed so absurd; many leaders were  indifferent, while others among them, Generals Lee, Beauregard, and  Longstreet, and Governor Patton--without approving the policy, advised  the whites to cooperate with the military authorities and save all they  could out of the situation. General Beauregard, for instance, wrote in  1867: \"If the suffrage of the Negro is properly handled and directed,  we shall defeat our adversaries with their own weapons. The Negro is  Southern born. With education and property qualifications he can be made  to take an interest in the affairs of the South and in its prosperity.  He will side with the whites.\"    Northern observers who were friendly to the South or who disapproved  of this radical reconstruction saw the danger more clearly than  the Southerners themselves, who seemed not to appreciate the full  implication of the situation. In this connection the New York \"Herald\"  remarked:    \"We may regard the entire ten unreconstructed Southern States, with  possibly one or two exceptions, as forced by a secret and overwhelming  revolutionary influence to a common and inevitable fate. They are all  bound to be governed by blacks spurred on by worse than blacks--white  wretches who dare not show their faces in respectable society anywhere.  This is the most abominable phase barbarism has assumed since the dawn  of civilization. It was all right and proper to put down the rebellion.  It was all right perhaps to emancipate the slaves.... But it is not  right to make slaves of white men even though they may have been former  masters of blacks. This is but a change in a system of bondage that is  rendered the more odious and intolerable because it has been inaugurated  in an enlightened instead of a dark and uncivilized age.\"    The political parties rapidly grouped themselves for the coming  struggle. The radical Republican party indeed was in process of  organization in the South even before the passage of the reconstruction  acts. Its membership was made up of Negroes, carpetbaggers, or Northern  men who had come in as speculators, officers of the Freedmen's Bureau  and of the army, scalawags or Confederate renegades, \"Peace Society\"  men,* and Unionists of Civil War times, with a few old Whigs who could  not yet bring themselves to affiliate with the Democrats. At first it  seemed that a respectable number of whites might be secured for the  radical party, but the rapid organization of the Negroes checked the  accession of whites. In the winter and spring of 1866-67, the Negroes  near the towns were well organized by the Union League and the  Freedmen's Bureau and then, after the passage of the reconstruction  acts, the organizing activities of the radical chieftains shifted to  the rural districts. The Union League was greatly extended; Union League  conventions were held to which local whites were not admitted; and  the formation of a black man's party was well on the way before the  registration of the voters was completed. Visiting statesmen from the  North, among them Henry Wilson of Massachusetts and \"Pig Iron\" Kelley  of Pennsylvania, toured the South in support of the radical program, and  the registrars and all Federal officials aided in the work.         * See \"The Day of the Confederacy\", by Nathaniel W.       Stephenson (in \"The Chronicles of America\"), p. 121,       footnote.      The whites, slow to comprehend the real extent of radicalism, were  finally aroused to the necessity of organizing, if they were to  influence the Negro and have a voice in the conventions. The old party  divisions were still evident. With difficulty a portion of the Whigs was  brought with the Democrats into one conservative party during the summer  and fall of 1867, though many still held aloof. The lack of the old  skilled leadership was severely felt. In places where the white man's  party was given a name, it was called \"Democratic and Conservative,\" to  spare the feelings of former Whigs who were loath to bear the party name  of their quondam opponents.    The first step in the military reconstruction was the registration of  voters. In each State a central board of registrars was appointed by the  district commander and a local board for every county and large town.  Each board consisted of three members--all radicals--who were required  to subscribe to the \"ironclad\" oath. In several states one Negro was  appointed to each local board. The registrars listed Negro voters during  the day, and at night worked at the organization of a radical Republican  party. The prospective voters were required to take the oath prescribed  in the Reconstruction Act, but the registrars were empowered to  go behind the oath and investigate the Confederate record of each  applicant. This authority was invoked to carry the disfranchisement of  the whites far beyond the intention of the law in an attempt to destroy  the leadership of the whites and to register enough Negroes to outvote  them at the polls. For this purpose the registration was continued until  October 1, 1867, and an active campaign of education and organization  carried on.    At the close of the registration, 703,000 black voters were on the rolls  and 627,000 whites. In Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, Florida, and  Mississippi there were black majorities, and in the other States the  blacks and the radical whites together formed majorities. The white  minorities included several thousand who had been rejected by the  registrars but restored by the military commanders. Though large  numbers of blacks were dropped from the revised rolls as fraudulently  registered, the registration statistics, nevertheless, bore clear  witness to the political purpose of those who compiled them.    Next followed a vote on the question of holding a state convention  and the election of delegates to such a convention if held--a double  election. The whites, who had been harassed in the registration and who  feared race conflicts at the elections, considered whether they ought  not to abstain from voting. By staying away from the polls, they might  bring the vote cast in each State below a majority and thus defeat the  proposed conventions for, unless a majority of the registered voters  actually cast ballots either for or against a convention, no convention  could be held. Nowhere, however, was this plan of not voting fully  carried out, for, though most whites abstained, enough of them voted  (against the conventions, of course) to make the necessary majority in  each State. The effect of the abstention policy upon the personnel of  the conventions was unfortunate. In every convention there was a radical  majority with a conservative and all but negligible minority. In South  Carolina and Louisiana, there were Negro majorities. In every State  except North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia, the Negroes and the  carpetbaggers together were in the majority over native whites.    The conservative whites were of fair ability; the carpetbaggers and  scalawags produced in each convention a few able leaders, but most  of them were conscienceless political soldiers of fortune; the Negro  members were inexperienced, and most of them were quite ignorant, though  a few leaders of ability did appear among them. In Alabama, for example,  only two Negro members could write, though half had been taught to sign  their names. They were barbers, field hands, hack drivers, and servants.  A Negro chaplain was elected who invoked divine blessings on \"unioners  and cusses on rebels.\" It was a sign of the new era when the convention  specially invited the \"ladies of colored members\" to seats in the  gallery.    The work of the conventions was for the most part cut and dried, the  abler members having reached a general agreement before they met. The  constitutions, mosaics of those of other states, were noteworthy only  for the provisions made to keep the whites out of power and to regulate  the relations of the races in social matters."]]]
