That is the great question just now.\"    \"It is indeed,\" answered Mr. Shanks, in great agitation; \"this is very  awkward, very awkward indeed.\"    \"I know that,\" answered John Ayliffe, laconically.    \"Well but, sir, what is to be done?\" asked Mr. Shanks, fidgeting  uneasily about the table.    \"That is what I come to ask you, not to tell you,\" answered the young  man; \"you see, Shanks, you and I are exactly in the same case, only I  have more to lose than you have. But whatever happens to me will  happen to you, depend upon it. I am not going to be the only one,  whatever Mrs. Hazleton may think.\"    Shanks caught at Mrs. Hazleton's name; \"Ay, that's a good thought,\" he  said, \"we had better go and consult her. Let us put our three heads  together, and we may beat them yet--perhaps.\"    \"No use of going to her,\" answered John Ayliffe, bitterly; \"I have  been to her, and she is a thorough vixen. She cried off having any  thing to do with me, and when I just told her quietly that she ought  to help me out of the scrape because she had a hand in getting me into  it, she flew at my throat like a terrier bitch with a litter of  puppies, barked me out of the house as if I had been a beggar, and  called me almost rogue and swindler in the hearing of her own  servants.\"    Mr. Shanks smiled--he could not refrain from smiling with a feeling of  admiration and respect, even in that moment of bitter apprehension, at  the decision, skill, and wisdom of Mrs. Hazleton's conduct. He  approved of her highly; but he perceived quite plainly that it would  not do for him to play the same game. A hope--a feeble hope--light  through a loop-hole, came in upon him in regard to the future,  suggested by Mrs. Hazleton's conduct. He thought that if he could but  clear away some difficulties, he too might throw all blame upon John  Ayliffe, and shovel the load of infamy from his own shoulders to those  of his client; but to effect this, it was not only necessary that he  should soothe John Ayliffe, but that he should provide for his safety  and escape. Recriminations he was aware were very dangerous things,  and that unless a man takes care that it shall not be in the power or  for the interest of a fellow rogue to say _tu quoque_, the effort to  place the burden on his shoulders only injures him without making our  own case a bit better. It was therefore requisite for his purposes  that he should deprive John Ayliffe of all interest or object in  criminating him; but foolish knaves are very often difficult to deal  with, and he knew his young client to be eminent in that class.  Wishing for a little time to consider, he took occasion to ask one or  two meaningless questions, without at all attending to the replies.    \"When did this letter arrive here?\" he inquired.    \"This very night,\" answered John Ayliffe, \"not three hours ago.\"    \"Do you think she has really told all?\" asked Mr. Shanks.    \"All, and a great deal more,\" replied the young man.    \"How long has she been at St. Germain?\" said the lawyer.    \"What the devil does that signify?\" said John Ayliffe, growing  impatient.    \"A great deal, a great deal,\" replied Mr. Shanks, sagely. \"Take some  more punch. You see perhaps we can prove that you and I really thought  her dead at the time the affidavit was made.\"    \"Devilish difficult that,\" said John Ayliffe, taking the punch. \"She  wrote to me about some more money just at that time, and I was obliged  to answer her letter and send it, so that if they have got the letters  that won't pass.\"    \"We'll try at least,\" said Mr. Shanks in a bolder tone.    \"Ay, but in trying we may burn our fingers worse than ever,\" said the  young man. \"I do not want to be tried for perjury and conspiracy, and  sent to the colonies with the palm of my hand burnt out, whatever you  may do, Shanks.\"    \"No, no, that would never do,\" replied the lawyer. \"The first thing to  be done, my dear Sir John, is to provide for your safety, and that can  only be done by your getting out of the way for a time. It is very  natural that a young gentleman of fortune like yourself should go to  travel, and not at all unlikely that he should do so without letting  any one know where he is for a few months. That will be the best plan  for you--you must go and travel. They can't well be on the look-out  for you yet, and you can get away quite safely to-morrow morning. You  need not say where you are going, and by that means you will save both  yourself and the property too; for they can't proceed against you in  any way when you are absent.\"    John Ayliffe was not sufficiently versed in the laws of the land to  perceive that Mr. Shanks was telling him a falsehood. \"That's a good  thought,\" he said; \"if I can live abroad and keep hold of the rents we  shall be safe enough.\"    \"Certainly, certainly,\" said Mr. Shanks, \"that is the only plan. Then  let them file their bills, or bring their actions or what not. They  cannot compel you to answer if you are not within the realm.\"    Mr. Shanks was calling him all the time, in his own mind, a  jolter-headed ass, but John Ayliffe did not perceive it, and replied  with a touch of good feeling, perhaps inspired by the punch, \"But what  is to become of you, Shanks?\"    \"Oh, I will stay and face it out,\" replied the lawyer, \"with a bold  front. If we do not peach of each other they cannot do much against  us. Mrs. Hazleton dare not commit us, for by so doing she would commit  herself; and your mother's story will not avail very much. As to the  letters, which is the worst part of the business, we must try and  explain those away; but clearly the first thing for you to do is to  get out of England as soon as possible. You can go and see your mother  secretly, and if you can but get her to prevaricate a little in her  testimony it will knock it all up.\"    \"Oh, she'll prevaricate enough if they do but press her hard,\" said  John Ayliffe. \"She gets so frightened at the least thing she does'nt  know what she says. But the worst of it is, Shanks, I have not got  money enough to go. I have not got above a hundred guineas in the  house.\"    Mr. Shanks paused and hesitated. It was a very great object with him  to get John Ayliffe out of the country, in order that he might say any  thing he liked of John Ayliffe when his back was turned, but it was  also a very great object with him to keep all the money he had got. He  did not like to part with one sixpence of it. After a few moments'  thought, however, he recollected that a thousand pounds' worth of  plate had come down from London for the young man within the last two  months, and he thought he might make a profitable arrangement.    \"I have got three hundred pounds in the house,\" he said, \"all in good  gold, but I can really hardly afford to part with it. However, rather  than injure you, Sir John, I will let you have it if you will give me  the custody of your plate till your return, just that I may have  something to show if any one presses me for money.\"    The predominant desire of John Ayliffe's mind, at that moment, was to  get out of England as fast as possible, and he was too much blinded by  fear and anxiety to perceive that the great desire of Mr. Shanks was  to get him out. But there was one impediment. The sum of four hundred  pounds thus placed at his command would, some years before, have  appeared the Indies to him, but now, with vastly expanded ideas with  regard to expense, it seemed a drop of water in the ocean. \"Three  hundred pounds. Shanks,\" he said, \"what's the use of three hundred  pounds? It would not keep me a month.\"    \"God bless my soul!\" said Mr. Shanks, horrified at such a notion, \"why  it would keep me a whole year, and more too. Moreover, things are  cheaper there than they are here; and besides you have got all those  jewels, and knick-knacks, and things, which cost you at least a couple  of thousand pounds. They would sell for a great deal.\"    \"Come, come, Shanks,\" said the young man, \"you must make it five  hundred guineas. I know you've got them in your strong box here.\"    Shanks shook his head, and John Ayliffe added sullenly, \"Then I'll  stay and fight it out too. I won't go and be a beggar in a foreign  land.\"    Shanks did not like the idea of his staying, and after some farther  discussion a compromise was effected. Mr. Shanks agreed to advance  four hundred pounds. John Ayliffe was to make over to him, as a  pledge, the whole of his plate, and not to object to a memorandum to  that effect being drawn up immediately, and dated a month before. The  young man was to set off the very next day, in the pleasant gray of  the morning, driving his own carriage and horses, which he was to sell  as soon as he got a convenient distance from his house, and Mr. Shanks  was to take the very best possible care of his interests during his  absence.    John Ayliffe's spirits rose at the conclusion of this transaction. He  calculated that with one thing or another he should have sufficient  money to last him a year, and that was quite as far as his thoughts or  expectations went. A long, long year! What does youth care for any  thing beyond a year? It seems the very end of life to pant in  expectation, and indeed, and in truth, it is very often too long for  fate.    \"Next year I will\"--Pause, young man! there is a deep pitfall in the  way. Between you and another year may be death. Next year thou wilt do  nothing--thou wilt be nothing.    His spirits rose. He put the money into his pocket, and, with more wit  than he thought, called it \"light heaviness,\" and then he sat down and  smoked a pipe, while Mr. Shanks drew up the paper; and then he drank  punch, and made more, and drank that too, so that when the paper  giving Mr. Shanks a lien upon the silver was completed, and when a  dull neighbor had been called in to see him sign his name, it needed a  witness indeed to prove that that name was John Ayliffe's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36131"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 3, June, 1851 (#19)"],[1,"Land of My Fathers,\" has just given to the world, in  three octavos, a _History of the Jews in Great Britain_. The book is  insufferably tame and feeble; the author is of the class called in  England \"religious flunkies:\" a mastiff to the poor and a spaniel to  the proud. His first book was disgusting for its feebleness and  servility, and this is scarcely better, notwithstanding the richness  of its materials and the curious interest of its subject. A good  History of the Jews in England will be a work worth reading.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Ecclesiastical History Society_ have published in London  _Strype's Memorials of Cranmer_, _Heylyn's History of the  Reformation_, and _Field's Treatise of the Church_. Strype and Heylyn  are more familiar than Field, whose work is a sort of supplement to  Hooker's _Polity_. Field resembled his illustrious master and friend  in judgment, temper, and learning. In his own day his reputation was  great. James I. regretted, when he heard of his death, that he had not  done more for him; Hall, in reference to his own deanery of Worcester,  which had been sought for Field, speaks of that \"better-deserving  divine,\" who \"was well satisfied with greater hopes;\" and Fuller, with  his accustomed humor of thoughtfulness, bestows his salutation on  \"that learned divine whose memory smelleth like a _field_ that the  Lord hath blessed.\"           *       *       *       *       *    THE LIFE OF WORDSWORTH, by Dr. Christopher Wordsworth, has appeared in  London, and with some additions by Professor Henry Reed, of  Philadelphia, will soon be issued by Ticknor, Reed & Fields, of  Boston. From what the critics write of it we suspect it is a poor  affair. The _Leader_ says that, \"all things considered, it is perhaps  the worst biographical attempt\" it \"ever waded through.\" The  _Examiner_ and other leading papers admit its dulness as a biography,  and its worthlessness in criticism, but claim for it a certain value  as a collection of facts respecting the histories of Wordsworth's  different poems. The work indeed professes to be no more than a  biographical commentary on the poet's writings. It does not even  affect to be critical, or to offer any labored exposition of the  principles on which Wordsworth's poems were composed. The author  describes his illustrious relative as having had no desire that any  such disquisition should be written. \"He wished that his poems should  stand by themselves, and plead their own cause before the tribunal of  posterity.\" Strictly, then, the volumes are so exclusively subordinate  and ministerial to the poetry they illustrate, that apart from the  latter they possess hardly any interest. By enthusiasts for the poems  they will be eagerly read, but to any other class of readers we cannot  see that they present attraction. Dr. Wordsworth's part in them,  though small, is not particularly well done; and the poet's part  almost exclusively consists of personal memoranda connected with his  poems dictated in later life, and seldom by any chance refers to any  thing but himself.    Nevertheless there are in the volumes many delightful and  characteristic details, much genuine and beautiful criticism (chiefly  in the poet's letters), and occasional passages of fine sentiment and  pure philosophy. Here is Wordsworth's own description of one of his  latest visits to London, and of his appearance at court, in a letter  to an American correspondent:    \"My absence from home lately was not of more than three weeks. I took  the journey to London solely to pay my respects to the Queen, upon my  appointment to the laureateship upon the decease of my friend Mr.  Southey. The weather was very cold, and I caught an inflammation in  one of my eyes, which rendered my stay in the south very  uncomfortable. I nevertheless did, in respect to the object of my  journey, all that was required. The reception given me by the Queen at  her ball was most gracious. Mrs. Everett, the wife of your minister,  among many others, was a witness to it, without knowing who I was. It  moved her to the shedding of tears. This effect was in part produced,  I suppose, by American habits of feeling, as pertaining to a  republican government. To see a gray-haired man of seventy-five years  of age, kneeling down in a large assembly to kiss the hand of a young  woman, is a sight for which institutions essentially democratic do not  prepare a spectator of either sex, and must naturally place the  opinions upon which a republic is founded, and the sentiments which  support it, in strong contrast with a government based and upheld as  ours is. I am not, therefore, surprised that Mrs. Everett was moved,  as she herself described to persons of my acquaintance, among others  to Mr. Rogers the poet. By the by, of this gentleman, now I believe in  his eighty-third year, I saw more than of any other person except my  host, Mr. Moxon, while I was in London. He is singularly fresh and  strong for his years, and his mental faculties (with the exception of  his memory a little) not at all impaired. It is remarkable that he and  the Rev. W. Bowles were both distinguished as poets when I was a  schoolboy, and they have survived almost all their eminent  contemporaries, several of whom came into notice long after them.  Since they became known, Burns, Cowper, Mason the author of  'Caractacus' and friend of Gray, have died. Thomas Warton, Laureate,  then Byron, Shelley, Keats, and a good deal later Scott, Coleridge,  Crabbe, Southey, Lamb, the Ettrick Shepherd, Cary the translator of  Dante, Crowe the author of 'Lewesdon Hill,' and others of more or less  distinction, have disappeared. And now of English poets advanced in  life, I cannot recall any but James Montgomery, Thomas Moore, and  myself, who are living, except the octogenarian with whom I began. I  saw Tennyson, when I was in London, several times. He is decidedly the  first of our living poets, and I hope will live to give the world  still better things. You will be pleased to hear that he expressed in  the strongest terms his gratitude to my writings. To this I was far  from indifferent, though persuaded that he is not much in sympathy  with what I should myself most value in my attempts, viz., the  spirituality with which I have endeavored to invest the material  universe, and the moral relations under which I have wished to exhibit  its most ordinary appearances.\"    Of the mention of Alfred Tennyson in the foregoing extract the  _Examiner_ remarks, that it is perhaps the greatest stretch of  appreciation or acknowledgment in regard to any living or contemporary  poet in Wordsworth. His mention of Southey's verses is always reserved  and dry. He takes no pains to conceal his poor opinion of Scott's. His  allusions to Rogers are respectful, but cold. His objection to Byron  may be forgiven. There is less reason for his appearing quite to lose  his ordinarily calm temper when Goethe is even named, or for his  extending this unreasoning dislike to Goethe's great English  expositor, Carlyle. Yet we must not omit, on the other hand, what he  says of Shelley. Shelley, he admits (much to our surprise), to have  been \"one of the best artists of us all; I mean in workmanship of  style.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The London _Standard of Freedom_ remarks of the article on \"Some  American Poets\" in the last number of _Blackwood_, that \"it assumes  more ignorance in England as to American poetry than actually exists.\"  Our readers will readily believe this when advised that the critic  regards _Longfellow_ as a greater poet than Bryant! whom he classes  with Mrs. Hemans.           *       *       *       *       *    M. COMTE has quitted metaphysics to reform the calendar, but probably  will not succeed better than those who attempted the same thing during  the first French revolution. We find a synopsis of his scheme in the  _Leader_. He proposes that each month shall be consecrated to one of  the great names that represent the intellectual and social progress of  humanity. He specializes the names of Moses, Homer, Aristotle,  Archimedes, Caesar, St. Paul, Charlemagne, Dante, Descartes, Guttenberg  (whom he probably thinks had something to do with the invention of  printing), Columbus and Frederic the Great, as most appropriate for  the designation of the twelve months; recommending, however,  particular fetes for minor heroes in the months under which they may  best be grouped--for Augustin, Hildebrand, Bernard, and Bossuet, in  St. Paul's month; Alfred and St. Louis, in Charlemagne's month;  Richelieu and Cromwell in the month of Frederic the Great, and so on.  Supplying a defect of Catholicism in this respect, he proposes what he  calls \"fetes of reprobation\" for the greatest scoundrels of  history--for such retrogressive men as Julian the Apostate, Philip II.  of Spain, and Bonaparte, (we don't agree to the classification, unless  he means President Louis Napoleon, who indeed is not a _great_  scoundrel, though disposed to be sufficiently retrogressive.)  According to this new calendar, a follower of Comte, writing a letter  in March, would have to date it as written on such or such a day of  _Aristotle_. We fear the proposal won't do even in France, but this,  at least, may be said for it, that it is as good as the Puseyite  practice of dating by saints' days, besides being novel, and Parisian,  and scientific. Sydney Smith used, in jest of the Puseyite practice,  to date his letters \"_Washing Day--Eve of Ironing Day_;\" Comte's plan  is better than that of the Puseyites--almost as good as Peter  Plimley's.           *       *       *       *       *    Among the many books lately printed in England upon the ecclesiastical  controversies, is one entitled _Remonstrance against Romish  Corruptions in the Church, addressed to the People and Parliament of  England in 1395_, now for the first time published,"]]]
