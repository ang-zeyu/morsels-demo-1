I tell you, friends, we're in a bad way.\"    \"If money was any object--,\" began Mr. Jenks.    \"What good would money be?\" demanded Mr. Hosbrook. \"What we need to  do is to get a message to some one--some of my friends--to send out  a party to rescue us.\"    \"That's right,\" chimed in Mr. Parker, the scientist. \"And the  message needs to go off soon, if we are to be saved.\"    \"Why so?\" asked Mr. Anderson.    \"Because I think this island will sink inside of a week!\"    A scream came from the two ladies.    \"Why don't you keep such thoughts to yourself?\" demanded the  millionaire yacht owner, indignantly.    \"Well, it's true,\" stubbornly insisted the scientist.    \"What if it is? It doesn't do any good to remind us of it.\"    \"Bless my gizzard, no!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"Suppose we have  dinner. I'm hungry.\"    That seemed to be his remedy for a number of ills.    \"If we only could get a message off, summoning help, it WOULD be the  very thing,\" sighed Mrs. Nestor. \"Oh, how I wish I could send my  daughter, Mary, word of where we are. She may hear of the wreck of  the RESOLUTE, and worry herself to death.\"    \"But it is out of the question to send a message for help from  Earthquake Island,\" added Mrs. Anderson. \"We are totally cut off  from the rest of the world here.\"    \"Perhaps not,\" spoke Tom Swift, quietly. He had come up silently,  and had heard the conversation.    \"What's that you said?\" cried Mr. Nestor, springing to his feet, and  crossing the sandy beach toward the lad.    \"I said perhaps we weren't altogether cut off from the rest of the  world,\" repeated Tom.    \"Why not,\" demanded Captain Mentor. \"You don't mean to say that you  have been building a boat up there in your little shack, do you?\"    \"Not a boat,\" replied Tom, \"but I think I have a means of sending  out a call for help!\"    \"Oh, Tom--Mr. Swift--how?\" exclaimed Mrs. Nestor. \"Do you mean we  can send a message to my Mary?\"    \"Well, not exactly to her,\" answered the young inventor, though he  wished that such a thing were possible. \"But I think I can summon  help.\"    \"How?\" demanded Mr. Hosbrook. \"Have you managed to discover some  cable line running past the island, and have you tapped it?\"    \"Not exactly.\" was Tom's calm answer, \"but I have succeeded, with  the help of Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick, in building an apparatus that  will send out wireless messages!\"    \"Wireless messages!\" gasped the millionaire. \"Are you sure?\"    \"Wireless messages!\" exclaimed Mr. Jenks. \"I'll give--\" He paused,  clasped his hands on his belt, and turned away.    \"Oh, Tom!\" cried Mrs. Nestor, and she went up to the lad, threw her  arms about his neck, and kissed him; whereat Tom blushed.    \"Perhaps you'd better explain,\" suggested Mr. Anderson.    \"I will,\" said the lad. \"That is the secret we have been engaged  upon--Mr. Damon, Mr. Fenwick and myself. We did not want to say  anything about it until we were sure we could succeed.\"    \"And are you sure now?\" asked Captain Mentor.    \"Fairly so.\"    \"How could you build a wireless station?\" inquired Mr. Hosbrook.    \"From the electrical machinery that was in the wrecked WHIZZER,\"  spoke Tom. \"Fortunately, that was not damaged by the shock of the  fall, and I have managed to set up the gasolene engine, and attach  the dynamo to it so that we can generate a powerful current. We also  have a fairly good storage battery, though that was slightly damaged  by the fall.\"    \"I have just tested the machinery, and I think we can send out a  strong enough message to carry at least a thousand miles.\"    \"Then that will reach some station, or some passing ship,\" murmured  Captain Mentor. \"There is a chance that we may be saved.\"    \"If it isn't too late,\" gloomily murmured the scientist. \"There is  no telling when the island will disappear beneath the sea.\"    But they were all so interested in Tom's announcement that they paid  little attention to this dire foreboding.    \"Tell us about it,\" suggested Mr. Nestor. And Tom did.    He related how he had set up the dynamo and gasolene engine, and  how, by means of the proper coils and other electrical apparatus,  all of which, fortunately, was aboard the WHIZZER, he could produce  a powerful spark.    \"I had to make a key out of strips of brass, to produce the Morse  characters,\" the lad said. \"This took considerable time, but it  works, though it is rather crude. I can click out a message with  it.\"    \"That may be,\" said Mr. Hosbrook, who had been considering  installing a wireless plant on his yacht, and who, therefore, knew  something about it, \"you may send a message, but can you receive an  answer?\"    \"I have also provided for that,\" replied Tom. \"I have made a  receiving instrument, though that is even more crude than the  sending plant, for it had to be delicately adjusted, and I did not  have just the magnets, carbons, coherers and needles that I needed.  But I think it will work.\"    \"Did you have a telephone receiver to use?\"    \"Yes. There was a small interior telephone arrangement on Mr.  Fenwick's airship, and part of that came in handy. Oh, I think I can  hear any messages that may come in answer to ours.\"    \"But what about the aerial wires for sending and receiving  messages?\" asked Mr. Nestor.    \"Don't you have to have several wires on a tall mast?\"    \"Yes, and that is the last thing to do,\" declared Tom. \"I need all  your help in putting up those wires. That tall tree on the crest of  the island will do,\" and he pointed to a dead palm that towered  gaunt and bare like a ship's mast, on a pile of rocks in the centre  of Earthquake Island.          CHAPTER XXI    MESSAGES INTO SPACE      Tom Swift's announcement of the practical completion of his wireless  plant brought hope to the discouraged hearts of the castaways. They  crowded about him, and asked all manner of questions.    Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Damon came in for their share of attention, for  Tom said had it not been for the aid of his friends he never could  have accomplished what he did. Then they all trooped up to the  little shack, and inspected the plant.    As the young inventor had said, it was necessarily crude, but when  he set the gasolene motor going, and the dynamo whizzed and hummed,  sending out great, violet-hued sparks, they were all convinced that  the young inventor had accomplished wonders, considering the  materials at his disposal.    \"But it's going to be no easy task to rig up the sending and  receiving wires,\" declared Tom. \"That will take some time.\"    \"Have you got the wire?\" asked Mr. Jenks.    \"I took it from the stays of the airship,\" was Tom's reply, and he  recalled the day he was at that work, when the odd man had exhibited  the handful of what he said were diamonds. Tom wondered if they  really were, and he speculated as to what might be the secret of  Phantom Mountain, to which Mr. Jenks had referred.    But now followed a busy time for all. Under the direction of the  young inventor, they began to string the wires from the top of the  dead tree, to a smaller one, some distance away, using five wires,  set parallel, and attached to a wooden spreader, or stay. The wires  were then run to the dynamo, and the receiving coil, and the  necessary ground wires were installed.    \"But I can't understand how you are going to do it,\" said Mrs.  Nestor. \"I've read about wireless messages, but I can't get it  through my head. How is it done, Mr. Swift?\"    \"The theory is very simple,\" said the young inventor. \"To send a  message by wire, over a telegraph system, a battery or dynamo is  used. This establishes a current over wires stretched between two  points. By means of what is called a 'key' this current is  interrupted, or broken, at certain intervals, making the sounding  instrument send out clicks. A short click is called a dot, and a  long click a dash. By combinations of dots, dashes, and spaces  between the dots and dashes, letters are spelled out. For instance,  a dot and a space and a dash, represent the letter 'A' and so on.\"    \"I understand so far,\" admitted Mrs. Nestor.    \"In telegraphing without wires,\" went on Tom, \"the air is used in  place of a metallic conductor, with the help of the earth, which in  itself is a big magnet, or a battery, as you choose to regard it.  The earth helps to establish the connection between places where  there are no wires, when we 'ground' certain conductors.\"    \"To send a wireless message a current is generated by a dynamo. The  current flows along until it gets to the ends of the sending wires,  which we have just strung. Then it leaps off into space, so to  speak, until it reaches the receiving wires, wherever they may be  erected. That is why any wireless receiving station, within a  certain radius, can catch any messages that may be flying through  the air--that is unless certain apparatus is tuned, or adjusted, to  prevent this.\"    \"Well, once the impulses, or electric currents, are sent out into  space, all that is necessary to do is to break, or interrupt them at  certain intervals, to make dots, dashes and spaces. These make  corresponding clicks in the telephone receiver which the operator at  the receiving station wears on his ear. He hears the code of clicks,  and translates them into letters, the letters into words and the  words into sentences. That is how wireless messages are sent.\"    \"And do you propose to send some that way?\" asked Mrs. Anderson.    \"I do,\" replied Tom, with a smile.    \"Where to?\" Mrs. Nestor wanted to know.    \"That's what I can't tell,\" was Tom's reply. \"I will have to project  them off into space, and trust to chance that some listening  wireless operator will 'pick them up,' as they call it, and send us  aid.\"    \"But are wireless operators always listening?\" asked Mr. Nestor.    \"Somewhere, some of them are--I hope,\" was Tom's quiet answer. \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4230"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle; Or, Fun and Adventures on the Road (#19)"],[1," next, an' I cain't now. G'lang, now,  won't yo'? Let's git dis yeah sawmill started.\"    Tom shut off the power and leaped from his wheel. From the woods at  his left came the protesting \"hee-haw\" of a mule.    \"Boomerang and Eradicate Sampson!\" exclaimed the young inventor.  \"What can they be doing here?\"    He leaned his motor-cycle against the fence and advanced toward  where he had heard the voice of the colored man. In a little  clearing he saw him. Eradicate was presiding over a portable  sawmill, worked by a treadmill, on the incline of which was the  mule, its ears laid back, and an unmistakable expression of anger on  its face.    \"Why, Rad, what are you doing?\" cried Tom.    \"Good land o' massy! Ef it ain't young Mistah Swift!\" cried the  darky. \"Howdy, Mistah Swift! Howdy! I'm jest tryin' t' saw some  wood, t' make a livin', but Boomerang he doan't seem t' want t'  lib,\" and with that Eradicate looked reproachfully at the animal.    \"What seems to be the trouble, and how did you come to own this  sawmill?\" asked Tom.    \"I'll tell yo', Mistah Swift, I'll tell yo',\" spoke Eradicate. \"Sit  right yeah on dis log, an' I'll explanation it to yo'.\"    \"The last time I saw you, you were preparing to go into the grass-cutting  business,\" went on Tom.    \"Yais, sah! Dat's right. So I was. Yo' has got a memory, yo' suah  has. But it am dis yeah way. Grass ain't growin' quick enough, an'  so I traded off dat lawn-moah an' bought dis yeah mill. But now it  won't go, an' I suah am in trouble,\" and once more Eradicate Sampson  looked indignantly at Boomerang.          CHAPTER XXI.    ERADICATE GIVES A CLUE      \"Tell me all about it,\" urged Tom sympathetically, for he had a  friendly feeling toward the aged darky.    \"Well,\" began Eradicate, \"I suah thought I were gwine to make money  cuttin' grass, 'specially after yo' done fixed mah moah. But 'peared  laik nobody wanted any grass cut. I trabeled all ober, an' I  couldn't git no jobs. Now me an' Boomerang has to eat, no mattah ef  he is contrary, so I had t' look fo' some new wuk. I traded dat  lawn-moah off fo' a cross-cut saw, but dat was such hard wuk dat I  gib it up. Den I got a chance to buy dis yeah outfit cheap, an' I  bought it.\"    Eradicate then went on to tell how he had purchased the portable  sawmill from a man who had no further use for it, and how he had  managed to transport it from a distant village to the spot where Tom  had met him. There he had secured permission to work a piece of  woodland on shares, sawing up the smaller trees into cord wood. He  had started in well enough, cutting down considerable timber, for  the colored man was a willing worker, but when he tried to start his  mill he met with trouble.    \"I counted on Boomerang helpin' me,\" he said to Tom. \"All he has to  do is walk on dat tread mill, an' keep goin'. Dat makes de saw go  'round, an' I saws de wood. But de trouble am dat I can't git  Boomerang to move. I done tried ebery means I knows on, an' he won't  go. I talked kind to him, an' I talked harsh. I done beat him wif a  club, an' I rub his ears soft laik, an' he allers did laik dat, but  he won't go. I fed him on carrots an' I gib him sugar, an' I eben  starve him, but he won't go. Heah I been tryin' fo' three days now  t' git him started, an' not a stick hab I sawed. De man what I'm  wukin' wif on shares he git mad, an' he say ef I doan't saw wood  pretty soon he gwine t' git annuder mill heah. Now I axes yo' fair,  Mistah Swift, ain't I got lots ob trouble?\"    \"You certainly seem to have,\" agreed Tom \"But why is Boomerang so  obstinate? Usually on a treadmill a horse or a mule has to work  whether they like it or not. If they don't keep moving the platform  slides out from under them, and they come up against the back bar.\"    \"Dat's what done happened to Boomerang,\" declared Eradicate. \"He  done back up against de bar, an' dere he stay.\"    Tom went over and looked at the mill. The outfit was an old one, and  had seen much service, but the trained eye of the young inventor saw  that it could still be used effectively. Boomerang watched Tom, as  though aware that something unusual was about to happen.    \"Heah I done gone an' 'vested mah money in dis yeah mill,\"  complained Eradicate, \"an' I ain't sawed up a single stick. Ef I  wasn't so kind-hearted I'd chastise dat mule wuss dan I has, dat's  what I would.\"    Tom said nothing. He was stooping down, looking at the gearing that  connected the tread mill with the shaft which revolved the saw.  Suddenly he uttered an exclamation,    \"Rad, have you been monkeying with this machinery?\" he asked.    \"Me? Good land, Mistah Swift, no, sah! I wouldn't tech it. It's jest  as I got it from de man I bought it off. It worked when he had it,  but he used a hoss. It's all due to de contrariness ob Boomerang,  an' if I--\"    \"No, it isn't the mule's fault at all!\" exclaimed Tom. \"The mill is  out of gear, and tread is locked; that's all. The man you bought it  off probably did it so you could haul it along the road. I'll have  it fixed for you in a few minutes. Wait until I get some tools.\"    From the bag on his motor-cycle Tom got his implements. He first  unlocked the treadmill, so that the inclined platform, on which the  animal slowly walked, could revolve. No sooner had he done this than  Boomerang, feeling the slats under his hoofs moving away, started  forward. With a rattle the treadmill slid around.    \"Good land o' massy! It's goin'!\" cried Eradicate delightedly. \"It  suah am goin'!\" he added as he saw the mule, with nimble feet, send  the revolving, endless string of slats around and around. \"But de  saw doan't move, Mistah Swift. Yo' am pretty smart at fixin' it as  much as yo' has, but I reckon it's too busted t' eber saw any wood.  I'se got bad luck, dat's what I has.\"    \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Tom. \"The sawmill will be going in a moment.  All I have to do is to throw it into gear. See here, Rad. When you  want the saw to go you just throw this handle forward. That makes  the gears mesh.\"    \"What's dat 'bout mush?\" asked Eradicate.    \"Mesh--not mush. I mean it makes the cogs fit together. See,\" and  Tom pressed the lever. In an instant, with a musical whirr, the saw  began revolving.    \"Hurrah! Dere it goes! Golly! see de saw move!\" cried the delighted  colored man. He seized a stick of wood, and in a trice it was sawed  through.    \"Whoop!\" yelled Eradicate. \"I'm sabed now! Bless yo', Mistah Swift,  yo' suttinly am a wondah!\"    \"Now I'll show you how it works,\" went on Tom. \"When you want to  stop Boomerang, you just pull this handle. That locks the tread, and  he can't move it,\" and, suiting the action to his words, Tom stopped  the mill. \"Then,\" he went on, \"when you want him to move, you pull  the handle this way,\" and he showed the darky how to do it. In a  moment the mule was moving again. Then Tom illustrated how to throw  the saw in and out of gear, and in a few minutes the sawmill was in  full operation, with a most energetic colored man feeding in logs to  be cut up into stove lengths.    \"You ought to have an assistant, Rad,\" said Tom, after he had  watched the work for a while. \"You could get more done then, and  move on to some other wood-patch.\"    \"Dat's right, Mistah Swift, so I had. But I 'done tried, an'  couldn't git any. I ast seberal colored men, but dey'd radder  whitewash an' clean chicken coops. I guess I'll hab t' go it alone.  I ast a white man yisterday ef he wouldn't like t' pitch in an'  help, but he said he didn't like to wuk. He was a tramp, an' he had  de nerve to ask me fer money--me, a hard-wukin' coon.\"    \"You didn't give it to him, I hope.\"    \"No, indeedy, but he come so close to me dat I was askeered he might  take it from me, so I kept hold ob a club. He suah was a bad-lookin'  tramp, an' he kept laffin' all de while, like he was happy.\"    \"What's that?\" cried Tom, struck by the words of the colored man.  \"Did he have a thick, brown beard?\"    \"Dat's what he had,\" answered Eradicate, pausing in the midst of his  work. \"He suah were a funny sort ob tramp. His hands done looked  laik he neber wuked, an' he had a funny blue ring one finger, only  it wasn't a reg'lar ring, yo' know. It was pushed right inter his  skin, laik a man I seen at de circus once, all cobered wid funny  figgers.\"    Tom leaped to his feet.    \"Which finger was the blue ring tattooed on?\" he asked, and he  waited anxiously for the answer.    \"Let me see, it were on de right--no, it were on de little finger ob  de left hand.\"    \"Are you sure, Rad?\"    \"Suah, Mistah Swift. I took 'tic'lar notice, 'cause he carried a  stick in dat same hand.\"    \"It must be my man--Happy Harry!\" exclaimed Tom half aloud. \"Which  way did he go, Rad, after he left you?\"    \"He went up de lake shore,\" replied the colored man. \"He asked me if  I knowed ob an ole big house up dere, what nobody libed in, an' I  said I did. Den he left, an' I were glad ob it.\"    \"Which house did you mean, Rad?\"    \"Why, dat ole mansion what General Harkness used t' lib in befo' de  wah. Dere ain't nobody libed in it fo' some years now, an' it's  deserted. Maybe a lot ob tramps stays in it, an' dat's where dis man  were goin'.\"    \"Maybe,\" assented Tom, who was all excitement now. \"Just where is  this old house, Rad?\"    \"Away up at de head ob Lake Carlopa. I uster wuk dere befo' de wah,  but it's been a good many years since quality folks libed dere. Why,  did yo' want t' see dat man, Mistah Swift?\"    \"Yes, Rad, I did, and very badly, too. I think he is the very person  I want. But don't say anything about it. I'm going to take a trip up  to that strange mansion. Maybe I'll get on the trail of Happy Harry  and the men who robbed me. I'm much obliged to you, Rad, for this  information. It's a good clue, I think. Strange that you should meet  the very tramp I've been searching for.\"    \"Well, I suah am obliged to yo', Mistah Swift, fo' fixin' mah  sawmill.\"    \"That's all right. What you"]]]
