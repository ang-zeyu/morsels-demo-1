For, far removed from camp or mart,      Beneath the sacred sod      Of that blest hill they sleep apart:      Forgotten by the world below,      After life's spendthrift toil they know      The rest that comes from God.        And, oh, it must be good to sleep      Within that churchyard bare,      While turn by turn the seasons keep      A bedside watch, and God may see      Safe in St. Martha's nursery      His children pillowed there.    If I had to choose a month and an hour to visit St. Martha's, it would  be an evening late in April with the trees in the valley at their  freshest and the song of blackbirds about the hill. Others, perhaps,  would choose an August day, with the wind scented and the hill purpled  with heather; perhaps, too, in August the rabbit-cropped turf is  smoothest and greenest. Others may find the chief beauty of the hill in  the bronze and yellow of the changing leaves of October; there are no  hills where the beech glows with a deeper fire than over Albury and the  Tillingbourne. Others even might ask for the vague, wet airs of  midwinter, with the shouldering hilltops east and south and west faint  and mysterious in the clinging mist, and never a house-roof to be seen.  That is an effect of strange loneliness; but the abiding charm of St.  Martha's is the peace of clear air, in the enchantment of low spring  sunlight on the down turf and the quiet walls.    Once I saw a remarkable sight by St. Martha's. Incongruously enough, the  wooded hillsides below the chapel are preserved as game-coverts; indeed,  pheasants are shot quite close to the churchyard. There are rides cut  through the wood in which broods of young pheasants are fed by their  fostermothers' coops; and looking down one of these rides on a day early  in August, I watched for some time a curious collection of birds  feeding together in front of the coops. There were the young pheasants,  of course, there was quite a crowd of small birds, finches chiefly, but  a few thrushes and hedge-sparrows; there were seven or eight  turtle-doves, five jays, and, queerest of all companions for doves and  pheasants, a carrion crow. I thought at first he must be a rook, but  there was no doubt about it. I looked up as I walked away, and over me  sailed five herring gulls, high and slow.    [Illustration: _St. Martha's Chapel._]    St. Catherine's chapel, on the other side of Guildford, has not the same  lonely charm as St. Martha's. It has never, like St. Martha's, been  restored, and the hill on which it stands is sacred to nobody. Children  climb about its walls and windows; cockneys scratch their names, and  picnic parties bestrew the grass with paper. Yet St. Catherine's, in the  days before pilgrimages ceased and shrines were left to moulder, perhaps  heard as many Aves as her sister chapel on the hill beyond the Way. A  country legend is common to both chapels. St. Catherine and St. Martha,  in the wonderful days of the giants, were sisters who built chapels on  neighbouring hills. They had but one hammer between them, and they  hurled it high over the valley one to another, St. Martha catching it  from St. Catherine, driving in a nail and hurling it back again.    North of Guildford to the west is Worplesdon Common, a stretch of  heathery, rushy ground over which have gone many marches and  manoeuvres, and north of the common is the home of Mr. Frederick  Selous, the African traveller and naturalist. Mr. Selous throws his  collection of trophies open to the public for a small sum, and his  garden is known to the readers of the _Field_ as the home of rare and  shy birds. The owner has described, with callous disregard of the  feelings of less fortunate ornithologists, the nesting operations among  his bird boxes of half a dozen nuthatches.    To the north-east, a mile from the main road from Guildford to Ripley,  is Sutton Place, perhaps the finest piece of domestic architecture in  the south of England. Mr. Frederic Harrison has described it at length  in his _Annals of an Old Manor House_. It was built by Sir Richard  Weston about 1525. The architect is unknown, but the house is peculiarly  interesting, partly because it is the best example of the use of terra  cotta in the moulding combined with brickwork, and partly because it is  one of the earliest houses in England built as a country home rather  than a castle. Sir Richard Weston, the founder, was one of the ablest  servants and greatest friends of Henry VIII, the more astonishing a  friendship in that it was never broken. Henry VIII sent his friend's son  to the scaffold, accused as a lover of Anne Boleyn; he went to the block  protesting his innocence, and there was nothing to prove him guilty; his  last words were a defence of the queen. His son, a baby when his boyish  father was executed, married the daughter of Sir Thomas Arundell. Sir  Thomas had suffered for treason, so that husband and wife were the  children of parents who had been sent to the block. They entertained  Elizabeth at Sutton; she would have a child's memory of the founder of  the house, and doubtless praised the rebus in the terra cotta moulding,  the \"R.W.,\" the grapes and the tun.    Later representatives of the Westons at Sutton were the Salvin family,  and it was one of these Salvins, I imagine, to whom Frank Buckland  refers in his edition of White's _Selborne_. Captain Salvin lived at  Whitmoor House, near Guildford, and was the happy owner of a tame wild  sow. Lady Susan was her name, and this is how her master describes  her:--        \"My sow originally came from Syria, and was given to me by H.H. the      Maharajah Duleep Singh. She is a remarkably fine healthy animal,      and her instinct and affection can only be equalled by the dog. She      follows me almost daily in my walks like a dog, to the great      astonishment of strangers. Of course I only take her out before the      crops are up, and too low to injure, during the spring and summer      months. I always have her belled, to hear when she is in the wood,      etc.; and the bell, which is a good sheep's bell, is fastened round      her neck with a strap and a buckle.        \"Her leaping powers are extraordinary, either over water or timber;      indeed, only a few weeks since she cleared some palings (between      which she had been purposely placed to secure her for a time) three      feet ten inches in height. Knowing my pig's excellent temper, even      when she has young pigs, and when domestic sows are always most      savage, I was once guilty of a practical joke. I got a blacksmith      who was quite ignorant of even the existence of my pig, to 'come and      ring a pig.' The stye being under a building, he had to enter it at      a low door, which was some distance from the sow's yard, where she      was feeding. He entered, shutting the door to keep the pig in, and      thinking his subject was an ordinary one and that assistants were      following him to hold the cord, etc. He had not been gone a minute,      before I heard the greatest 'rum-ti-tum' at the door, and cries of      'For goodness' sake, sir, let me out! let me out! I never saw such a      beast in all my life!' and out came the poor blacksmith pale with      fright, but all the consolation he got was a jolly good laugh at his      own expense.\"    All English cricket owes a debt to Guildford. It is in the annals of  Guildford that there occurs the first known mention of the game of  \"crickett.\" In 1598 there was a dispute over the rights of a plot of  land near the north town ditch, and \"John Derrick, gent., one of the  Queen's Majestie's coroners of the county of Surrey, aged fifty-nine\"  was called to give evidence. He stated that he had known the land for  fifty years and more, and that when he was a boy at the Free School at  Guildford he and his fellows \"did runne and plaie there at crickett and  other plaies.\" The evidence is interesting, because he is not asked for  an explanation. Everybody at that date evidently knew at once what  cricket meant. Besides being a cricket ground, the land was used for  baiting bears.

Eight highroads converge on Guildford, and these are fed, of course, by  many minor roads. Besides the roads, five lines of railways run into and  leave the town, so that it is eminently possible, from Guildford, to do  either of two things, to take a walk in a ring and return to the town by  another road, or, what is perhaps a little more luxurious, but enables  you to cover more country, you can walk in almost any direction, and at  the end of the day take a train back to the town. The highroad runs  north to Woking and Horsell; north-east the Ripley road goes by Cobham  to Kingston and London; eastwards, under Merrow Downs, you can walk by  Clandon and the Horsleys to Leatherhead; a smaller road travels  south-west by St. Martha's Chapel to Chilworth; almost due south a road  runs through Shalford to Wonersh, or breaks off at Shalford to go east  to Dorking; another southern road is to Godalming; the great west road  passes over the Hog's Back to Farnham, and north-west lie Worplesdon  and Bisley. And the railways can be joined north, east, south, and west.    Godalming, four miles away, is a centre in itself, and has its own  chapter. But Guildford is the best centre from which to see some of  Godalming's neighbours. A good ring is by Shalford through Bramley and  Wonersh, returning by Chilworth under St. Martha's. Shalford lies a mile  to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28198"],[0,"A Budget of Christmas Tales (#19)"],[1,"house: not only  without any abatement of his dignity, but with an expression of having  important and wealthy engagements elsewhere. \"What's the matter? What's  the matter?\"    \"You're always a-being begged, and prayed, upon your bended knees, you  are,\" said the footman with great emphasis to Trotty Veck, \"to let our  door-steps be. Why don't you let 'em be? CAN'T you let 'em be?\"    \"There! That'll do, that'll do!\" said the gentleman, \"Halloa there!  Porter!\" beckoning with his head to Trotty Veck, \"Come here. What's  that? Your dinner?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Trotty, leaving it behind him in a corner.    \"Don't leave it there!\" exclaimed the gentleman. \"Bring it here, bring  it here! So! this is your dinner, is it?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" repeated Trotty, looking with a fixed eye and a watery mouth  at the piece of tripe he had reserved for a last delicious tit-bit,  which the gentleman was now turning over and over on the end of a fork.    Two other gentlemen had come out with him. One was a low-spirited  gentleman of middle age, of a meagre habit, and a disconsolate face; who  kept his hands continually in the pockets of his scanty pepper-and-salt  trousers, very large and dog's-eared from that custom; and was not  particularly well brushed or washed. The other, a full sized, sleek,  well-conditioned gentleman, in a blue coat, with bright buttons, and a  white cravat. This gentleman had a very red face, as if an undue  proportion of the blood in his body were squeezed up into his head,  which perhaps accounted for his having also the appearance of being  rather cold about the heart.    He who had Toby's meat upon the fork called to the first one by the name  of Filer, and they both drew near together. Mr. Filer being exceedingly  short sighted, was obliged to go so close to the remnant of Toby's  dinner before he could make out what it was, that Toby's heart leaped up  into his mouth. But Mr. Filer didn't eat it.    \"This is a description of animal food, Alderman,\" said Filer, making  little punches in it with a pencil-case, \"commonly known to the laboring  population of this country by the name of tripe.\"    The Alderman laughed, and winked; for he was a merry fellow. Alderman  Cute. Oh, and a sly fellow too! A knowing fellow. Up to everything. Not  to be imposed upon. Deep in the people's hearts! He knew them, Cute did.  I believe you!    \"But who eats tripe?\" said Mr. Filer, looking round. \"Tripe is without  an exception the least economical, and the most wasteful article of  consumption that the markets of this country can by possibility produce.  The loss upon a pound of tripe has been found to be, in the boiling,  seven-eighths of a fifth more than the loss upon a pound of any other  animal substance whatever. Tripe is more expensive, properly understood,  than the hot-house pine-apple. Taking into account the number of animals  slaughtered yearly within the bills of mortality alone; and forming a  low estimate of the quantity of tripe which the carcases of these  animals, reasonably well butchered, would yield--I find that the waste  on that amount of tripe, if boiled, would victual a garrison of five  hundred men for five months of thirty-one days each, and a February  over. The Waste, the Waste!\"    Trotty stood aghast, and his legs shook under him. He seemed to have  starved a garrison of five hundred men with his own hand.    \"Who eats tripe?\" said Mr. Filer, warmly. \"Who eats tripe?\"    Trotty made a miserable bow.    \"You do, do you?\" said Mr. Filer. \"Then I'll tell you something. You  snatch your tripe, my friend, out of the mouths of widows and orphans.\"    \"I hope not, sir,\" said Trotty, faintly. \"I'd sooner die of want!\"    \"Divide the amount of tripe before-mentioned, Alderman,\" said Mr. Filer,  \"by the estimated number of existing widows and orphans, and the result  will be one pennyweight of tripe to each. Not a grain is left for that  man. Consequently, he's a robber.\"    Trotty was so shocked that it gave him no concern to see the Alderman  finish the tripe himself. It was a relief to get rid of it, anyhow.    \"And what do you say?\" asked the Alderman, jocosely, of the red-faced  gentleman in the blue coat. \"You have heard friend Filer. What do _you_  say?\"    \"What's it possible to say?\" returned the gentleman. \"What _is_ to be  said? Who can take any interest in a fellow like this,\" meaning Trotty,  \"in such degenerate times as these? Look at him! What an object! The  good old times, the grand old times, the great old times! _Those_ were  the times for a bold peasantry, and all that sort of thing. Those were  the times for every sort of thing, in fact. There's nothing now-a-days.  Ah!\" sighed the red-faced gentleman. \"The good old times, the good old  times!\"    It is possible that poor Trotty's faith in these very vague Old Times  was not entirely destroyed, for he felt vague enough, at that moment.  One thing, however, was plain to him, in the midst of his distress; to  wit, that however these gentlemen might differ in details, his  misgivings of that morning, and of many other mornings, were well  founded. \"No, no. We can't go right or do right,\" thought Trotty in  despair. \"There is no good in us. We are born bad!\"    But Trotty had a father's heart within him; which had somehow got into  his breast in spite of this decree; and he could not bear that Meg, in  the blush of her brief joy, should have her fortune read by these wise  gentlemen. \"God help her,\" thought poor Trotty. \"She will know it soon  enough.\"    He anxiously signed, therefore, to the young smith, to take her away.  But he was so busy, talking to her softly at a little distance, that he  only became conscious of this desire, simultaneously with Alderman Cute.  Now, the Alderman had not yet had his say, but _he_ was a philosopher,  too--practical though! Oh, very practical!--and, as he had no idea of  losing any portion of his audience, he cried \"Stop!\"    Trotty took Meg's hand and drew it through his arm. He didn't seem to  know what he was doing though.    \"Your daughter, eh?\" said the Alderman, chucking her familiarly under  the chin.    \"And you're making love to her, are you?\" said Cute to the young smith.    \"Yes,\" returned Richard quickly, for he was nettled by the question.  \"And we are going to be married on New Year's Day.\"    \"What do you mean?\" cried Filer sharply. \"Married!\"    \"Why, yes, we were thinking of it. Master,\" said Richard. \"We're rather  in a hurry you see, in case it should be Put Down first.\"    \"Ah!\" cried Filer, with a groan. \"Put _that_ down indeed. Alderman, and  you'll do something. Married! Married!! The ignorance of the first  principles of political economy on the part of these people; their  improvidence; their wickedness is by Heavens! enough to--Now look at  that couple, will you!\"    Well! They were worth looking at. And marriage seemed as reasonable and  fair a deed as they need have in contemplation.    \"A man may live to be as old as Methuselah,\" said Mr. Filer, \"and may  labor all his life for the benefit of such people as those; and may heap  up facts on figures, facts on figures, facts on figures, mountains high  and dry; and he can no more hope to persuade 'em that they have no right  or business to be married than he can hope to persuade 'em that they  have no earthly right or business to be born. And _that_ we know they  haven't. We reduced that to a mathematical certainty long ago!\"    \"Come here, my girl!\" said Alderman Cute.    The young blood of her lover had been mounting, wrathfully, within the  last few minutes; and he was indisposed to let her come. But, setting a  constraint upon himself, he came forward with a stride as Meg approached  and stood beside her. Trotty kept her hand within his arm still, but  looked from face to face as wildly as a sleeper in a dream.    \"Now, I'm going to give you a word or two of good advice, my girl,\" said  the Alderman, in his nice easy way. \"It's my place to give advice, you  know, because I'm a Justice. You know I'm a Justice, don't you?\"    Meg timidly said, \"Yes.\" But everybody knew Alderman Cute was a Justice!  Oh dear, so active a Justice always! Who such a mote of brightness in  the public eye, as Cute!    \"You are going to be married, you say,\" pursued the Alderman. \"Very  unbecoming and indelicate in one of your sex! But never mind that.  After you're married, you'll quarrel with your husband, and come to be a  distressed wife. You may think not; but you will, because I tell you so.  Now, I give you fair warning, that I have made up my mind to Put  distressed wives Down. So, don't be brought before me. You'll have  children--boys. Those boys will grow up bad, of course, and run wild in  the streets without shoes or stockings. Mind, my young friend! I'll  convict 'em summarily every one, for I am determined to Put boys without  shoes or stockings, Down. Perhaps your husband will die young (most  likely) and leave you with a baby. Then you'll be turned out of doors,  and wander up and down the streets. Now don't wander near me, my dear,  for I am resolved to Put all wandering mothers Down. All young mothers,  of all sorts and kinds, it's my determination to Put Down. Don't think  to plead illness as an excuse with me; or babies as an excuse with me;  for all sick persons and young children (I hope you know the  church-service, but I'm afraid not) I am determined to Put Down. And if  you attempt, desperately and ungratefully, and impiously, and  fraudulently attempt, to drown yourself, or hang yourself, I'll have no  pity on you, for I have made up my mind to Put all suicide Down! If  there is one thing,\" said the Alderman, with his self-satisfied smile,  \"on which I can be said to have made up my mind more than on another, it  is to Put suicide Down. So don't try it on. That's the phrase, isn't it!  Ha, ha! now we understand each other.\"    Toby knew not whether to be agonized or glad, to see that Meg had turned  deadly"]]]
