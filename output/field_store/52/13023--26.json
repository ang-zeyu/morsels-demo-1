The more intensely passionate the love of the child, the more  fantastical is its conduct. The child sometimes endeavours to imitate  the beloved person in every detail, often with the most ridiculous  results. A boy's mode of dress, even, may be influenced by his love for  a girl, and still more by his love for another boy. The child tries also  to imitate the movements of the beloved person, and in walking to tread  in the same footsteps. The youthful knight seeks in every possible way  to become pleasing to the girl of his choice, and to exhibit to her  every attention in his power. He does all this, not merely in imitation  of the conduct of grown-up persons, but for the gratification of his own  impulses. Sometimes we are able to observe the changes of mood that  occur in the child when the loved one is present or absent. The boy  bubbles over with joy when the girl he loves draws near; sorrow and  depression overwhelm him when the hour of parting is at hand. All kinds  of fetichistic sentiments are also met with even in childhood. Every  object belonging to the loved one is covered with passionate kisses; and  everything which has been touched by the beloved, has been endowed for  the child-lover with a quite exceptional value. \"Those lovely girls whom  kindly or cruel Nature has predestined to awaken desire and to call  forth sighs at every footstep they take, are often unaware that among  the crowd of their admirers are numbered boys also, who have hardly  outgrown the age of childhood, who kiss in secret every flower which  their beloved has let fall, who are happy if they have been able to  steal like thieves into the room in which the fair one has slept, who  kiss the carpet where her foot has pressed, to whom she is the most  wonderful creature in the universe. And when a young woman allows a boy  to sit on the ground beside her, resting his head on her knee, when her  fingers play lightly among his curls, how rarely does she know that his  heart is beating furiously under her caressing touch; when he throws  back his curly head, and she sees that his face is reddened, she does  not know that this is not simply on account of the heat of the fire, but  that he is glowing from the effect of an internal fire whose nature is a  mystery even to himself--the fire of Love.\"[36]    Children have also ample experience of jealousy. A boy is tortured by  its pangs when he sees his much-loved friend conversing with another. A  girl of ten may suffer from sleepless nights when the governess she  loves has spoken affectionately to another girl. A child may wait for  hours before the door or in the neighbourhood of the beloved person,  simply to snatch a glance in passing. Speaking generally, it appears to  me that children are jealous of adults to a less extent than they are  jealous of children of their own age.    Very frequently even in childhood sexuality gives rise to enduring  imaginative sexual activity. There results that which Hufeland in his  _Makrobiotik_ terms psychical onanism, viz., the imaginative  contemplation of a train of lascivious and voluptuous ideas. In many  instances there even results a poetical treatment of the sexual topic.    Among children, love-letters also play their part. Sometimes, indeed,  their contents is so harmless that the sexual motive remains  unsuspected; but in other cases, the child's sentiments are clearly  displayed, even when the whole character of the letter is extremely  naive. Sometimes the letter appears out of harmony with the child's  conduct in other respects. For example, I have seen cases in which,  though in conversation children spoke to one another in an impassioned  manner as \"darling\" and \"my dear love,\" no such expressions were used  by them in their letters. Verses are also composed by comparatively  youthful lovers. As we should expect, such verses are commonly deficient  in the matter of artistic technique. A lady who, when twelve years of  age, had been enamoured of her governess, copied for me from her album  the following verses:--        \"Es gibt nichts schoeneres auf der Welt,     Als wenn einem ein Wesen besonders gefaellt;     Und fuehlt man sich gezogen hin     Zu einer suessen Lehrerin,     Das ist ein Glueck.     Und liebt man sie so inniglich,     Dann fuerchtet wohl gar sehr man sich     Vorm Abschiedtag...\"      \"Of all things sweet beneath the sun,     The sweetest is to love but one;     And when the object of one's fondness     Is one's darling governess,     Supreme the joy.     And if one love her so intensely,     Then, of course, one dreads immensely     The day of parting....\"    In this style the poem continues for some time, and occasionally we come  to verses showing that jealousy was felt:--      \"O! Du Pauline sei kein Dieb,     Raub' mir nicht Fraeulein ----'s Lieb'.     Die Eifersucht, die quaelt mich sehr     Und noch mit jedem Tage mehr.     Sie sucht mich heim selbst in der Nacht.     O Liebe, Du hast dies vollbracht.\"      \"Pauline, you my anger move,     Stealing my Miss ----'s love.     From jealousy I've no release;     Day by day my pangs increase;     I've jealous thoughts too in the night.     Love, I suffer from thy might.\"    Many of the accompaniments of love may make their appearance the very  first time the passion awakens, such as the desire to please and to  astonish the object of affection, whether by mental or by bodily  excellence, A schoolmaster, of whom a child is enamoured, will  frequently find that this child is more obedient and more diligent than  all the others, the child endeavouring in every possible way to inspire  a reciprocal admiration. I remember a girl who during her first years at  school was extremely idle. Although by no means lacking in intelligence,  all the efforts spent on her failed to bring about a proper advance. All  at once she became most industrious; no task was too hard for her, and  everyone wondered at the sudden change, until after a time the enigma  was explained. The child, having conceived a great fondness for her  schoolmistress, wished to please the latter by attention to her lessons.  In addition, she was jealous; afraid lest the mistress should prefer  some other girl. In many instances, where a child's behaviour is  puzzling, such a solution of the riddle will become apparent when it is  looked for. Boys, again, endeavour by feats of strength to make the  greatest possible impression upon the girls of their choice, in  gymnastic exercises, for example, in athletic sports, and games.  Coquetry also occasionally manifests itself very early in life. Girls  try to please boys by their dress, and in similar ways. In boys also  similar phenomena may often be observed.    Vanity, too, plays an important part, and this all the more because a  child often wishes to appear older than his years, and despises childish  ways. If a boy loves a girl several years older than himself, his  sensitive pride will suffer if, as usually happens in such cases, the  girl treats him as a child. Goethe, who at the age of ten was inspired  by such a passion, describes it in _Wahrheit und Dichtung_. \"Young  Derones introduced me to his sister, who was a few years older than  myself, a very agreeable girl, well-grown, regularly formed, a brunette,  with black hair and eyes. Her whole expression was quiet, and even sad.  I tried to please her in every possible way, but could not succeed in  attracting her attention. Young girls are apt to regard themselves as  greatly in advance of boys a little younger than themselves, and whilst  they look up to young men, they assume the manners of an aunt towards  any boy who makes them the object of his first love.\"    The sense of shame makes its appearance in childhood. Havelock Ellis  and others indeed deny this, pointing out how readily shyness is  mistaken for the sense of shame. The error is common enough, but it  certainly does not apply to all cases, for even in childhood we often  enough encounter distinct manifestations of the sexual sense of shame. I  shall not here discuss the question to what extent this sense is innate  and to what extent acquired, since the matter will come up for  consideration in later part of this book. Unquestionably, during  childhood, the sense of shame in respect of certain processes may be  awakened by means of imitation and education. Thus we may observe that  many children, boys as well as girls, are greatly distressed, at any  rate during the second period of childhood, at having to undress in the  presence of others, and especially in the presence of persons of the  opposite sex. It is interesting to learn that many homosexuals declare  that even during childhood they felt ashamed when they were compelled to  undress before someone of their own sex, whereas in the presence of a  person of the opposite sex they were comparatively unashamed.    Sanford Bell is of opinion that girl-children, although in them as in  boys the sense of shame awakens comparatively early, are yet more  aggressive than boys. I have not myself been able to observe any such  difference. In the earlier years of childhood I have been unable to  detect any notable difference in this respect between the sexes; but  during the latter part of the second period of childhood, boys are  unquestionably more active. In general, the girl-child, when in love,  displays far less coyness and reserve than the young woman. In this  respect the difference between children and adults is most marked. A  girl of eleven, for example, will not make any difficulties about the  exchange of love-letters with the boy she loves, or about appointments  for secret meetings; whereas the young woman, at any rate when  well-behaved and well brought up, is cautious in such matters. But none  the less, I cannot admit that girls are more free in their behaviour in  these respects than boys."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28434"],[0,"The Astronomy of Milton's 'Paradise Lost' (#19)"],[1,"of the subject. Fuccarius, in a disparaging letter, says  that one of the Dutch telescopes had been brought to Venice, and that he  himself had seen it. This statement is not incompatible with Galileo's  affirmation that he had not seen the original instrument, and knew no  more about it than what had been communicated to him in the letters from  the French capital. It was insinuated by Fuccarius that Galileo had seen  the telescope at Venice, but, as he denied this, we should not hesitate  to believe in his veracity.    Immediately after his return to Padua, Galileo began to think how he  might be able to contrive an instrument with properties similar to the  one of which he had been informed; and in the following words describes  the process of reasoning by which he arrived at a successful result: 'I  argued in the following manner. The contrivance consists either of one  glass or of more--one is not sufficient, since it must be either convex,  concave, or plane. The last does not produce any sensible alteration in  objects; the concave diminishes them. It is true that the convex  magnifies, but it renders them confused and indistinct; consequently,  one glass is insufficient to produce the desired effect. Proceeding to  consider two glasses, and bearing in mind that the plane causes no  change, I determined that the instrument could not consist of the  combination of a plane glass with either of the other two. I therefore  applied myself to make experiments on combinations of the two other  kinds, and thus obtained that of which I was in search.' Galileo's  telescope consisted of two lenses--one plano-convex, the other  plano-concave, the latter being held next the eye. These he fixed in a  piece of organ pipe, which served the purpose of a tube, the glasses  being distant from each other by the difference of their focal lengths.  An exactly similar principle is adopted in the construction of an  opera-glass, which can be accurately described as a double Galilean  telescope. Galileo must be regarded as the inventor of this kind of  telescope, which in one respect differed very materially from the one  constructed by the Dutch optician. If what has been said with regard to  the _inverted_ weather-cock be true, then Lippershey's telescope was  made with two convex lenses, distant from each other by the sum of their  focal lengths, and all objects observed with it were seen inverted.  Refracting astronomical telescopes are now constructed on this  principle, it having been discovered that for observational purposes  they possess several advantages over the Galilean instrument. When  Galileo had completed his first telescope he returned with it to  Venice, where he exhibited it to his friends. The sensation created by  this small instrument, which magnified only three times, was most  extraordinary, and almost amounted to a frenzy. Crowds of the principal  citizens of Venice flocked to Galileo's house in order that they might  see the magical tube about which such wonderful reports were circulated;  and for upwards of a month he was daily occupied in describing his  invention to attentive audiences. At the expiration of this time the  Doge of Venice, Leonardo Deodati, hinted that the Senate would not be  averse to receive the telescope as a gift. Galileo readily acquiesced  with this desire, and, as an acknowledgment of his merits, a decree was  issued confirming his appointment as professor at Padua for life, and  increasing his salary from 500 to 1,000 florins. The public excitement  created by the telescope showed no signs of abatement. Sirturi mentions  that, having succeeded in constructing an instrument, he ascended the  tower of St. Mark's at Venice, hoping to be able to use it there without  interruption. He was, however, detected by a few individuals, and soon  surrounded by a crowd, which took possession of his telescope, and  detained him for several hours until their curiosity was satisfied.  Eager inquiries having been made as to where he lodged, Sirturi, fearing  a repetition of his experience in the church tower, decided to quit  Venice early next morning, and betake himself to a quieter and less  frequented neighbourhood.    The instrument was at first called Galileo's tube; the double eye-glass;  the perspective; the trunk; the cylinder. The appellation _telescope_  was given it by Demisiano.    Galileo next directed his attention to the construction of telescopes,  and applied his mechanical skill in making instruments of a larger size,  one of which magnified _eight_ times. 'And at length,' he writes,  'sparing neither labour nor expense, he completed an instrument that was  capable of magnifying more than _thirty_ times.'    Galileo now commenced an exploration of the celestial regions with his  telescope, and on carefully examining some of the heavenly bodies, made  many wonderful discoveries which added greatly to the fame and lustre of  his name.    The first celestial object to which Galileo directed his telescope was  the Moon. He was deeply interested to find how much her surface  resembled that of the Earth, and was able to perceive lofty mountain  ranges, the illumined peaks of which reflected the sunlight, whilst  their bases and sides were still enveloped in dark shadow; great plains  which he imagined were seas, valleys, elevated ridges, depressions, and  inequalities similar to what are found on our globe. Galileo believed  the Moon to be a habitable world, and concluded that the dark and  luminous portions of her surface were land and water, which reflected  with unequal intensity the light of the Sun. The followers of Aristotle  received the announcement of these discoveries with much displeasure.  They maintained that the Moon was perfectly spherical and smooth--a vast  mirror, the dark portions of which were the reflection of our  terrestrial mountains and forests--and accused Galileo 'of taking a  delight in distorting and ruining the fairest works of Nature.' He  appealed to the unequal condition of the surface of our globe, but this  was of no avail in altering their preconceived notions of the lunar  surface.    Perhaps the most important discovery made by Galileo with the telescope  was that of the four moons of Jupiter. On the night of January 7, 1610,  when engaged in observing the planet, his attention was attracted by  three small stars which appeared brighter than those in their immediate  neighbourhood. They were all in a straight line and parallel with the  ecliptic; two of them were situated to the east, and one to the west of  Jupiter. On the following night he was surprised to find all three to  the west of the planet, and nearer to each other. This caused him  considerable perplexity, and he was at a loss to understand how Jupiter  could be east of the three stars, when on the preceding night he was  observed to the west of two of them. Galileo was unable to reconcile the  altered positions of those bodies with the apparent motion of Jupiter  among the fixed stars as indicated by the astronomical tables. The next  opportunity he had of observing them was on the 10th, when two stars  only were visible, and they were to the east of the planet. As it was  impossible for Jupiter to move from west to east on January 8 and from  east to west on the 10th, he concluded that it was the motion of the  stars and not that of Jupiter which accounted for the observed  phenomena. Galileo watched the stars attentively on successive evenings  and discovered a fourth, and on observing how they changed their  positions relatively to each other he soon arrived at the conclusion  that the stars were four moons which revolved round Jupiter after the  manner in which the Moon revolves round the Earth. Having assured  himself that the four new stars were four moons that with periodical  regularity circled round the great planet, Galileo named them the  Medicean Stars in honour of his patron, Cosmo de' Medici, Grand Duke of  Tuscany. He also published an essay entitled 'Nuncius Sidereus,' or the  'Sidereal Messenger,' which contained an account of this important  discovery.    The announcement of Galileo's discovery of the four satellites of  Jupiter created a profound sensation, and its significance became at  once apparent. Aristotelians and Ptolemaists received the information  with much disfavour and incredulity, and many persons positively refused  to believe Galileo, whom they accused of inventing fables. On the other  hand, the upholders of the Copernican theory hailed it with  satisfaction, as it declared that Jupiter with his four moons  constituted a system of greater magnitude and importance than that of  our globe with her single satellite, and that consequently the Earth  could not be regarded as the centre of the universe.    When Kepler heard of this remarkable discovery, he wrote to Galileo and  expressed himself in the following characteristic manner: 'I was sitting  idle at home thinking of you, most excellent Galileo, and your letters,  when the news was brought me of the discovery of four planets by the  help of the double eye-glass. Wachenfels stopped his carriage at my door  to tell me, when such a fit of wonder seized me at a report which seemed  so very absurd, and I was thrown into such agitation at seeing an old  dispute between us decided in this way, that between his joy, my  colouring, and the laughter of both, confounded as we were by such a  novelty, we were hardly capable, he of speaking, or I of listening.... I  am so far from disbelieving in the existence of the four circumjovial  planets, that I long for a telescope to anticipate you, if possible, in  discovering two round Mars (as the proportion seems to me to require),  six or eight round Saturn, and perhaps one each round Mercury and  Venus.' The intelligence of Galileo's discoveries was received by his  opponents in a spirit entirely different from that manifested by Kepler.  The principal"]]]
