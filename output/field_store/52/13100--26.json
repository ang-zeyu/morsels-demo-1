Here, the Bee is making use of a tube  whose diameter is not suited to her work; she is constructing a complex  and difficult edifice, which perhaps would not possess the necessary  solidity if the ceilings were too broad. The Osmia therefore supports  these ceilings with longitudinal partitions; and the unequal chambers  resulting from the introduction of these partitions receive females at  one time and males at another, according to their capacity.          CHAPTER 5. PERMUTATIONS OF SEX.    The sex of the egg is optional. The choice rests with the mother, who is  guided by considerations of space and, according to the accommodation  at her disposal, which is frequently fortuitous and incapable of  modification, places a female in this cell and a male in that, so that  both may have a dwelling of a size suited to their unequal development.  This is the unimpeachable evidence of the numerous and varied facts  which I have set forth. People unfamiliar with insect anatomy--the  public for whom I write--would probably give the following explanation  of this marvellous prerogative of the Bee: the mother has at her  disposal a certain number of eggs, some of which are irrevocably female  and the others irrevocably male: she is able to pick out of either group  the one which she wants at the actual moment; and her choice is decided  by the holding capacity of the cell that has to be stocked. Everything  would then be limited to a judicious selection from the heap of eggs.    Should this idea occur to him, the reader must hasten to reject it.  Nothing could be more false, as the merest reference to anatomy will  show. The female reproductive apparatus of the Hymenoptera consists  generally of six ovarian tubes, something like glove-fingers, divided  into bunches of three and ending in a common canal, the oviduct, which  carries the eggs outside. Each of these glove-fingers is fairly wide  at the base, but tapers sharply towards the tip, which is closed.  It contains, arranged in a row, one after the other, like beads on a  string, a certain number of eggs, five or six for instance, of which the  lower ones are more or less developed, the middle ones half-way towards  maturity, and the upper ones very rudimentary. Every stage of evolution  is here represented, distributed regularly from bottom to top, from the  verge of maturity to the vague outlines of the embryo. The sheath clasps  its string of ovules so closely that any inversion of the order is  impossible. Besides, an inversion would result in a gross absurdity: the  replacing of a riper egg by another in an earlier stage of development.    Therefore, in each ovarian tube, in each glove-finger, the emergence of  the eggs occurs according to the order governing their arrangement in  the common sheath; and any other sequence is absolutely impossible.  Moreover, at the nesting period, the six ovarian sheaths, one by one and  each in its turn, have at their base an egg which in a very short time  swells enormously. Some hours or even a day before the laying, that egg  by itself represents or even exceeds in bulk the whole of the ovigenous  apparatus. This is the egg which is on the point of being laid. It is  about to descend into the oviduct, in its proper order, at its proper  time; and the mother has no power to make another take its place. It is  this egg, necessarily this egg and no other, that will presently be laid  upon the provisions, whether these be a mess of honey or a live prey; it  alone is ripe, it alone is at the entrance to the oviduct; none of the  others, since they are farther back in the row and not at the right  stage of development, can be substituted at this crisis. Its birth is  inevitable.    What will it yield, a male or a female? No lodging has been prepared,  no food collected for it; and yet both food and lodging have to be in  keeping with the sex that will proceed from it. And here is a much more  puzzling condition: the sex of that egg, whose advent is predestined,  has to correspond with the space which the mother happens to have found  for a cell. There is therefore no room for hesitation, strange though  the statement may appear: the egg, as it descends from its ovarian tube,  has no determined sex. It is perhaps during the few hours of its rapid  development at the base of its ovarian sheath, it is perhaps on its  passage through the oviduct that it receives, at the mother's pleasure,  the final impress that will produce, to match the cradle which it has to  fill, either a female or a male.    Thereupon the following question presents itself. Let us admit that,  when the normal conditions remain, a laying would have yielded m females  and n males. Then, if my conclusions are correct, it must be in the  mother's power, when the conditions are different, to take from the m  group and increase the n group to the same extent; it must be possible  for her laying to be represented as m-1, m-2, m-3, etc. females and by  n+1, n+2, n+3, etc. males, the sum of m+n remaining constant, but one of  the sexes being partly permuted into the other. The ultimate conclusion  even cannot be disregarded: we must admit a set of eggs represented  by m-m, or zero, females and of n+m males, one of the sexes being  completely replaced by the other. Conversely, it must be possible for  the feminine series to be augmented from the masculine series to the  extent of absorbing it entirely. It was to solve this question and some  others connected with it that I undertook, for the second time, to rear  the Three-horned Osmia in my study.    The problem on this occasion is a more delicate one; but I am  also better-equipped. My apparatus consists of two small, closed  packing-cases, with the front side of each pierced with forty holes,  in which I can insert my glass tubes and keep them in a horizontal  position. I thus obtain for the Bees the darkness and mystery which suit  their work and for myself the power of withdrawing from my hive, at any  time, any tube that I wish, with the Osmia inside, so as to carry it  to the light and follow, if need be with the aid of the lens, the  operations of the busy worker. My investigations, however frequent and  minute, in no way hinder the peaceable Bee, who remains absorbed in her  maternal duties.    I mark a plentiful number of my guests with a variety of dots on the  thorax, which enables me to follow any one Osmia from the beginning  to the end of her laying. The tubes and their respective holes are  numbered; a list, always lying open on my desk, enables me to note from  day to day, sometimes from hour to hour, what happens in each tube and  particularly the actions of the Osmiae whose backs bear distinguishing  marks. As soon as one tube is filled, I replace it by another. Moreover,  I have scattered in front of either hive a few handfuls of empty  Snail-shells, specially chosen for the object which I have in view.  Reasons which I will explain later led me to prefer the shells of Helix  caespitum. Each of the shells, as and when stocked, received the date  of the laying and the alphabetical sign corresponding with the Osmia to  whom it belonged. In this way, I spent five or six weeks in continual  observation. To succeed in an enquiry, the first and foremost condition  is patience. This condition I fulfilled; and it was rewarded with the  success which I was justified in expecting.    The tubes employed are of two kinds. The first, which are cylindrical  and of the same width throughout, will be of use for confirming the  facts observed in the first year of my experiments in indoor rearing.  The others, the majority, consist of two cylinders which are of very  different diameters, set end to end. The front cylinder, the one which  projects a little way outside the hive and forms the entrance-hole,  varies in width between 8 and 12 millimetres. (Between.312 to .468  inch.--Translator's Note.) The second, the back one, contained  entirely within my packing-case, is closed at its far end and is 5 to 6  millimetres (.195 to.234 inch.--Translator's Note.) in diameter. Each of  the two parts of the double-galleried tunnel, one narrow and one wide,  measures at most a decimetre (3.9 inches.--Translator's Note.) in  length. I thought it advisable to have these short tubes, as the Osmia  is thus compelled to select different lodgings, each of them being  insufficient in itself to accommodate the total laying. In this way I  shall obtain a greater variety in the distribution of the sexes. Lastly,  at the mouth of each tube, which projects slightly outside the case,  there is a little paper tongue, forming a sort of perch on which the  Osmia alights on her arrival and giving easy access to the house. With  these facilities, the swarm colonized fifty-two double-galleried tubes,  thirty-seven cylindrical tubes, seventy-eight Snail-shells and a few old  nests of the Mason-bee of the Shrubs. From this rich mine of material I  will take what I want to prove my case.    Every series, even when incomplete, begins with females and ends with  males. To this rule I have not yet found an exception, at least in  galleries of normal diameter. In each new abode, the mother busies  herself first of all with the more important sex. Bearing this point  in mind, would it be possible for me, by manoeuvring, to obtain an  inversion of this order and make the laying begin with males? I  think so, from the results already ascertained and the irresistible  conclusions to be drawn from them. The double-galleried tubes are  installed in order to put my conjectures to the proof.    The back gallery, 5 or 6 millimetres (.195 to.234 inch.--Translator's  Note.) wide, is too narrow to serve as a lodging for normally developed  females. If, therefore, the Osmia, who is very economical of her space,  wishes to occupy them, she will be obliged to establish males there.

What is required by every living organism? In plants?  Insects? Reptiles? Man?]    1. THE BLOOD.--Every living organism of the higher sort, whether animal or  vegetable, requires for the maintenance of life and activity, a circulatory  fluid, by which nutriment is distributed to all its parts. In plants, this  fluid is the sap; in insects, it is a watery and colorless blood; in  reptiles and fishes, it is red but cold blood; while in the nobler animals  and man, it is the red and warm blood.    [Sidenote: 2. Importance and abundance of blood? Dependence of life? Abel?  Mosaic law? In what part of the body is blood not found? Quantity of blood  in the body?]    2. The blood is the most important, as it is the most abundant, fluid of  the body; and upon its presence, under certain definite conditions, life  depends. On this account it is frequently, and very properly, termed \"the  vital fluid.\" The importance of the blood, as essential to life, was  recognized in the earliest writings. In the narration of the death of the  murdered Abel, it is written, \"the voice of his _blood_ crieth from the  ground.\" In the Mosaic law, proclaimed over thirty centuries ago, the  Israelites were forbidden to eat food that contained blood, for the reason  that \"the life of the flesh is in the blood.\" With the exception of a few  tissues, such as the hair, the nails, and the _cornea_ of the eye, blood  everywhere pervades the body, as may be proven by puncturing any part with  a {102} needle. The total quantity of blood in the body is estimated at  about one-eighth of its weight, or eighteen pounds.    [Sidenote: 3. Color of blood? Its consistence? Odor?]    3. The color of the blood, in man and the higher animals, as is well known,  is red; but it varies from a bright scarlet to a dark purple, according to  the part whence it is taken. \"Blood is thicker than water,\" as the adage  truly states, and has a glutinous quality. It has a faint odor, resembling  that peculiar to the animal from which it is taken.    [Sidenote: 4. What is stated of the blood as viewed under the microscope?]    4. When examined under the microscope, the blood no longer appears a simple  fluid, and its color is no longer red. It is then seen to be made up of two  distinct parts: first, a clear, colorless fluid, called the _plasma_; and  secondly, of a multitude of minute solid bodies, or corpuscles, that float  in the watery plasma. The plasma, or nutritive liquid, is composed of water  richly charged with materials derived from the food, viz., albumen, which  gives it smoothness and swift motion; fibrin; certain fats; traces of  sugar; and various salts.    [Illustration: FIG 25.--THE BLOOD CORPUSCLES.]    [Sidenote: 5. State what you can of the little bodies called corpuscles.]    5. THE BLOOD CORPUSCLES.--In man, these remarkable \"little bodies,\" as the  word _corpuscles_ signifies, are of a yellow color, but by their vast  numbers impart a red hue to the blood. They are very small, having a  diameter of about 1/3500 of an inch, and being one-fourth of that fraction  in thickness; so that if 3,500 of them were placed in line, side by side,  they would only extend one inch; or, if {103} piled one above another, it  would take at least 14,000 of them to stand an inch high. Although so small  in size, they are very regular in form. As seen under the microscope, they  are not globular or spherical, but flat, circular, and disc-like, with  central depressions on each side, somewhat like a pearl button that has not  been perforated. In freshly-drawn blood they show a disposition to arrange  themselves in little rolls like coins (Fig. 25).    [Illustration: FIG. 26.    _a_, Oval Corpuscles of a fowl. _b_, Corpuscles of a frog. _c_, Those of a  shark.    The five small ones at the upper part of the figure, represent the human  corpuscles magnified 400 times.]    [Sidenote: 6. The size and shape of corpuscles? Why is the fact important?]    6. The size and shape of the blood corpuscles vary in different animals, so  that it is possible to discriminate between those of man and the lower  animals (Fig. 26). This is a point of considerable practical importance.  For example, it is sometimes desirable to decide in a court of justice the  source, whether from man or an inferior animal, of blood stains upon the  clothing of an accused person, or upon some deadly weapon. This may be done  by a microscopical examination of a minute portion of the dried stain,  previously refreshed by means of gum-water. Certain celebrated cases are  recorded in which the guilt of criminals has been established, and they  have been condemned and punished upon the evidence which science rendered  on this single point, the detecting of the human from other blood.    [Sidenote: 7. The character of the blood of dead animals? Means of  detecting such blood?]    7. The character of the blood of dead, extinct, and even fossil animals,  such as the mastodon, has been ascertained by obtaining and examining  traces of it which had been shut up, perhaps for ages, in the circulatory  canals of bone. A means of detecting blood in minute quantities is found  {104} in the spectroscope, the same instrument by which the constitution of  the heavenly bodies has been studied. If a solution containing not more  than one-thousandth part of a grain of the coloring matter of the  corpuscle, be examined, this instrument will detect it.    [Sidenote: 8. White corpuscles? Total number of corpuscles in the body?]    8. The corpuscles, just described, are known as the red blood corpuscles.  Besides these, and floating along in the same plasma, are the white  corpuscles. These are fewer in number, but larger and globular in form.  They are colorless, and their motion is less rapid than that of the other  variety. The total number of both varieties of these little bodies in the  blood is enormous. It is calculated that in a cubic inch of that fluid  there are eighty-three millions, and at least five hundred times that  number in the whole body.    [Sidenote: 9. The blood in its natural condition in the body? Describe the  process by which the coagulation of blood takes place?]    9. COAGULATION.--The blood, in its natural condition in the body, remains  perfectly fluid; but, within a few minutes after its removal from its  proper vessels, whether by accident or design, a change takes place. It  begins to coagulate, or assume a semi-solid consistence. If allowed to  stand, after several"]]]
