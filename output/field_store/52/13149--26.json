And here good Master Hunt preached twice every  Sunday while the men sat on felled trunks reverently listening to  his long sermons.    While the houses were being built Smith, with some twenty others,  was sent to explore the country.  They sailed up the river and found  the Indians to all appearance friendly.  But they found no gold  or precious stones, and could hear nothing of a passage to the  Pacific Ocean which they had been told to seek.  So they returned  to Jamestown.  Arriving here they found that the day before the  Indians had attacked the settlement and that one Englishman lay  slain and seventeen injured.    This was a bitter disappointment to Wingfield who had trusted in  the friendliness of the Indians.  But at length he was persuaded to  allow fortifications to be built.  Even then, however, the colonists  were not secure, for as they went about their business felling  trees or digging the ground the savages would shoot at them from  the shelter of the surrounding forest.  If a man strayed from the  fort he was sure to return wounded if he returned at all; and in  this sort of warfare the stolid English were no match for the wily  Indians. \"Our men,\" says Smith, \"by their disorderly straggling  were often hurt when the savages by the nimbleness of their heels  well escaped.\"    So six months passed, and the ships which had brought out the  colonists were ready to go back to England with a cargo of wood  instead of the gold which the Company had hoped for.  But before  the ships sailed Smith, who was still considered in disgrace, and  therefore kept out of the council, insisted on having a fair trial.  For he would not have Captain Newport go home and spread evil  stories about him.    Smith's enemies were unwilling to allow the trial.  But Smith would  take no denial.  So at length his request was granted, the result  being that he was proved innocent of every charge against him, and  was at length admitted to the council.    Now at last something like peace was restored, and Captain Newport  set sail for home.  He promised to make all speed he could and to  be back in five months' time.  And indeed he had need to hasten.  For  the journey outward had been so long, the supply of food so scant,  that already it was giving out.  And when Captain Newport sailed it  was plain that the colonists had not food enough to last fifteen  weeks.    Such food it was too! It consisted chiefly of worm-eaten grain.  A  pint was served out daily for each man, and this boiled and made  into a sort of porridge formed their chief food.  Their drink was  cold water.  For tea and coffee were unknown in those days, and  beer they had none.  To men used to the beer and beef of England  in plenty this indeed seemed meagre diet. \"Had we been as free of  all sins as gluttony and drunkenness,\" says Smith, \"we might have  been canonised as saints, our wheat having fried some twenty-six weeks  in the ship's hold, contained as many worms as grains, so that we  might truly call it rather so much bran than corn.  Our drink was  water, our lodging castles in the air.\"    There was fish enough in the river, game enough in the woods.  But  the birds and beasts were so wild, and the men so unskilful and  ignorant in ways of shooting and trapping, that they succeeded  in catching very little.  Besides which there were few among the  colonists who had any idea of what work meant.  More than half the  company were \"gentlemen adventurers,\" dare devil, shiftless men who  had joined the expedition in search of excitement with no idea of  labouring with their hands.    Badly fed, unused to the heat of a Virginian summer the men soon  fell ill.  Their tents were rotten, their houses yet unbuilt.  Trees  remained unfelled, the land untilled, while the men lay on the bare  ground about the fort groaning and in misery.  Many died, and soon  those who remained were so feeble that they had scarce strength  to bury the dead or even to crawl to the \"common kettle\" for their  daily measure of porridge.    In their misery the men became suspicious and jealous, and once  more quarrels were rife.  Wingfield had never been loved.  Now many  grew to hate him, for they believed that while they starved he  kept back for his own use secret stores of oil and wine and other  dainties.  No explanations were of any avail, and he was deposed  from his office of President and another chosen in his place.    As autumn drew on the misery began to lessen.  For the Indians, whose  corn was now ripe, began to bring it to the fort to barter it for  chisels, and beads, and other trifles.  Wild fowl too, such as ducks  and geese, swarmed in the river.    So with good food and cooler weather the sick soon began to mend.  Energy returned to them, and once more they found strength to build  and thatch their houses.  And led by Smith they made many expeditions  among the Indians, bringing back great stores of venison, wild  turkeys, bread, and grain in exchange for beads, hatchets, bells  and other knick-knacks.    But all the misery through which the colonists had passed had taught  them nothing.  They took no thought for the time to come when food  might again be scarce.  They took no care of it, but feasted daily  on good bread, fish and fowl and \"wild beasts as fat as we could  eat them,\" says Smith.    Now one December day Smith set out on an exploring expedition up  the Chickahominy River.  It was a hard journey, for the river was so  overgrown with trees that the men had to hew a path for the little  vessel.  At length the barque could go no further, so Smith left it,  and went on in a canoe with only two Englishmen, and two Indians  as guides.    For a time all went well.  But one day he and his companions went  ashore to camp.  While the others were preparing a meal, Smith, taking  one of the Indians with him, went on to explore a little further.  But he had not gone far when he heard the wild, blood-curdling war  whoop of the Indians.  Guessing at once that they had come against  him he resolved to sell his life as dearly as might be.  So seizing  the Indian guide he tied his arm fast to his own with his garters.  Then with pistol in his right hand, and holding the Indian in  front of him as a shield, he pushed as rapidly as he could in the  direction of the camp.    Arrows flew round him thick and fast, but Smith's good buff coat turned  them aside.  The whole forest was alive with Indians, but although  from the shelter of the trees they showered arrows upon Smith  none dared approach him to take him.  For they knew and dreaded the  terrible fire stick which he held in his hand.  Smith fired again  and yet again as he retreated, and more than one Indian fell, never  more to rise.  He kept his eyes upon the bushes and trees trying  to catch glimpses of the dusky figures as they skulked among them,  and paid little heed to the path he was taking.  So suddenly he  found himself floundering in a quagmire.    Still he fought for dear life, and as long as he held his pistol  no Redman dared come near to take him.  But at length, chilled and  wet, and half dead-with cold, unable to go further, he saw it was  useless to resist longer.  So he tossed away his pistol.  At once  the savages closed in upon and, dragging him out of the quagmire,  led him to their chief.    Smith had given in because he knew that one man stuck in a quagmire  could not hope to keep three hundred Indians long at bay.  But he  had sharp wits as well as a steady hand, and with them he still  fought for his life.  As soon as he was brought before the chief he  whipped out his compass, and showing it to the chief, explained to  him that it always pointed north, and thus the white men were able  to find their way through the pathless desert.    To the Indians this seemed like magic; they marvelled greatly at the  shining needle which they could see so plainly and yet not touch.  Seeing their interest Smith went on to explain other marvels of  the sun, and moon, and stars, and the roundness of the earth, until  those who heard were quite sure he was a great \"medicine man.\"    Thus Smith fought for his life.  But at length utterly exhausted, he  could say no more.  So while the chief still held the little ivory  compass, and watched the quivering needle, his followers led Smith  away to his own camp fire.  Here lay the other white men dead, thrust  through with many arrows.  And here the Indians warmed and chafed  his benumbed body, and treated him with all the kindness they knew.  But that brought Smith little comfort.  For he knew it was the Indian  way.  A famous warrior might be sure of kindness at their hands if  they meant in the end to slay him with awful torture.    And so, thoroughly warmed and restored, in less than an hour Smith  found himself fast bound to a tree, while grim warriors, terribly  painted, danced around him, bows and arrows in hand.  They were about  to slay him when the chief, holding up the compass, bade them lay  down their weapons.  Such a medicine man, he had decided, must not  thus be slain.  So Smith was unbound.    For some weeks Smith was marched hither and thither from village to  village.  He was kindly enough treated, but he never knew how long  the kindness would last, and he constantly expected death.  Yet he  was quite calm.  He kept a journal, and in this he set down accounts  of many strange sights he saw, not knowing if indeed they would  ever be read.    At length Smith was brought to the wigwam of the great Powhatan*,  the chief of chiefs, or Emperor, as these simple English folk  called him.  To receive the white prisoner the Powhatan put on his  greatest bravery.  Feathered and painted, and wearing a wide robe  of raccoon skins he sat upon a broad couch beside a fire.  On either  side of him sat one of his wives and behind in grim array stood his  warriors, row upon row.  Behind them again stood the squaws.

At  the same time they were constantly plotting conspiracies against  the life of Napoleon, and sending assassins to shoot him. \"I will  yet teach those Bourbons,\" that I am not a man to be shot at like  a dog.\" Napoleon complained bitterly that his enemies, then attempting  his assassination, were in the pay of the British government.  Almost daily the plots of these emigrants were brought to light by  the vigilance of the French police.    A Bourbon pamphleteer, named Peltier, circulated widely through  England the most atrocious libels against the First Consul, his  wife, her children, his brothers and sisters. They were charged  with the most low, degrading, and revolting vices. These accusations  were circulated widely through England and America. They produced  a profound impression. They were believed. Many were interested in  the circulation of these reports, wishing to destroy the popularity of  Napoleon, and to prepare the populace of England for the renewal of  the war. Napoleon remonstrated against such infamous representations  of his character being allowed in England. But he was informed  that the British press was free; that there was no resource but  to prosecute for libel in the British courts; and that it was the  part of true greatness to treat such slanders with contempt. But  Napoleon felt that such false charges were exasperating nations,  were paving the way to deluge Europe again in war, and that causes  tending to such woes were too potent to be despised.    The Algerines were now sweeping with their paretic crafts  the Mediterranean, exacting tribute from all Christian powers. A  French ship had been wrecked upon the coast, and the crew were made  prisoners. Two French vessels and a Neapolitan ship had also been  captured and taken to Algiers. The indignation of Napoleon was  aroused. He sent an officer to the Dey with a letter, informing him  that if the prisoners were not released and the captured vessels  instantly restored, and promise given to respect in future the  flags of France and Italy, he would send a fleet and an army and  overwhelm him with ruin. The Dey had heard of Napoleon's career  in Egypt. He was thoroughly frightened, restored the ships and the  prisoners, implored clemency, and with barbarian injustice doomed  to death those who had captured the ships in obedience to his  commands. Their lives were saved only through the intercession of  the French minister Napoleon then performed one of the most gracious  acts of courtesy toward the Pope. The feeble monarch had no means  of protecting his coasts from the pirates who still swarmed in  those seas. Napoleon selected two fine brigs in the naval arsenal  at Toulon, equipped them with great elegance, armed them most  effectively, filled them with naval stores, and conferring upon  them the apostolical names of St. Peter and St. Paul, sent them as  a present to the Pontiff. With characteristic grandeur of action,  he carried his attentions so far as to send a cutter to bring back  the crews, that the papal treasury might be exposed to no expense.  The venerable Pope, in the exuberance of his gratitude, insisted  upon, taking the French seamen to Rome. He treated them with every  attention in his power; exhibited to them St. Peter's, and dazzled  them with the pomp and splendor of cathedral worship. They returned  to France loaded with humble presents, and exceedingly gratified  with the kindness with which they had been received.    It was stipulated in the treaty of Amiens, that both England and  France should evacuate Egypt, and that England should surrender Malta  to its ancient rulers. Malta, impregnable in its fortifications,  commanded the Mediterranean, and was the key of Egypt. Napoleon  had therefore, while he professed a willingness to relinquish all  claim to the island himself, insisted upon it, as an essential  point, that England should do the same. The question upon which  the treaty hinged, was the surrender of Malta to a neutral power.  The treaty was signed. Napoleon promptly and scrupulously fulfilled  his agreements. Several embarrassments, for which England was not  responsible, delayed for a few months the evacuation of Malta. But  now nearly a year had passed since the signing of the treaty. All  obstacles were removed from the way of its entire fulfillment, and  yet the troops of England remained both in Egypt and in Malta. The  question was seriously discussed in Parliament and in the English  journals, whether England were bound to fulfill her engagements,  since France was growing so alarmingly powerful. Generously and  eloquently Fox exclaimed, \"I am astonished at all I hear, particularly  when I consider who they are that speak such words. Indeed I am  more grieved than any of the honorable friends and colleagues of Mr.  Pitt, at the growing greatness of France, which is daily extending  her power in Europe and in America. That France, now accused of  interfering with the concerns of others, we invaded, for the purpose  of forcing upon her a government to which she would not submit,  and of obliging her to accept the family of the Bourbons, whose  yoke she spurned. By one of those sublime movements, which history  should recommend to imitation, and preserve in eternal memorial,  she repelled her invaders. Though warmly attached to the cause  of England, we have felt an involuntary movement of sympathy with  that generous outburst of liberty, and we have no desire to conceal  it. No doubt France is great, much greater than a good Englishman  ought to wish, but that ought not to be a motive for violating solemn  treaties. But because France now appears too great to us--greater  than we thought her at first--to break a solemn engagement, to  retain Malta, for instance, would be an unworthy breach of faith,  which would compromise the honor of Britain. I am sure that if  there were in Paris an assembly similar to that which is debating  here, the British navy and its dominion over the seas would he  talked of, in the same terms as we talk in this house of the French  armies, and their dominion over the land.\"    Napoleon sincerely wished for peace. He was constructing vast works  to embellish and improve the empire. Thousands of workmen were  employed in cutting magnificent roads across the Alps. He was  watching with intensest interest the growth of fortifications and  the excavation of canals. He was in the possession of absolute power,  was surrounded by universal admiration, and, in the enjoyment of  profound peace, was congratulating himself upon being the pacificator  of Europe. He had disbanded his armies, and was consecrating all  the resources of the nation to the stimulation of industry. He  therefore left no means of forbearance and conciliation untried to  avert the calamities of war. He received Lord Whitworth, the English  embassador in Paris, with great distinction. The most delicate  attentions were paid to this lady, the Duchess of Dorset. Splendid  entertainments were given at the Tuileries and at St. Cloud in  their honor. Talleyrand consecrated to them all the resources of his  courtly and elegant manners. The two Associate Consuls, Cambaceres  and Lebrum, were also unwearied in attentions. Still all these efforts  on the part of Napoleon to secure friendly relations with England  were unavailing. The British government still, in open violation  of the treaty, retained Malta. The honor of France was at stake  in enforcing the sacredness of treaties Malta was too important a  post to be left in the hands of England. Napoleon at last resolved  to have a personal interview himself with Lord Whitworth, and  explain to him, with all frankness, his sentiments and his resolves.    It was on the evening of the 18th of February, 1803, that Napoleon  received Lord Whitworth in his cabinet in the Tuileries. A large  writing-table occupied the middle of the room. Napoleon invited  the embassador to take a seat at one end of the table, and seated  himself at the other. \"I have wished,\" said he, \"to converse with  you in person, that I may fully convince you of my real opinions and  intentions.\" Then with that force of language and that perspicuity  which no man ever excelled, he recapitulated his transactions with  England from the beginning; that he had offered peace immediately  upon the accession to the consulship; that peace had been refused;  that eagerly he had renewed negotiations as soon as he could with  any propriety do so: and that he had made great concessions to  secure the peace of Amiens. \"But my efforts,\" said he, \"to live on  good terms with England, have met with no friendly response. The  English newspapers breathe but animosity against me. The journals  of the emigrants are allowed a license of abuse which is not justified  by the British constitution. Pensions are granted to Georges and  his accomplices, who are plotting my assassination. The emigrants,  protected in England, are continually making excursions to France  to stir up civil war. The Bourbon princes are received with the  insignia of the ancient royalty. Agents are sent to Switzerland  and Italy to raise up difficulties against France. Every wind  which blows from England brings me but hatred and insult. Now we  have come to a situation from which we must relieve ourselves. Will  you or will you not execute the treaty of Amiens? I have executed  it on my part with scrupulous fidelity. That treaty obliged me to  evacuate Naples, Tarento, and the Roman States, within three months.  In less than two months, all the French troops were out of those  countries. Ten months have elapsed since the exchange of the  ratifications, and the English troops are still in Malta, and at  Alexandria. It is useless to try to deceive us on this point. Will  you have peace, or will you have war? If you are for war, only say  so; we will wage it unrelentingly. If you wish for peace, you must  evacuate"]]]
