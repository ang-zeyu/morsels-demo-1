Apparently in opposition to the peacefully  industrious democrats and Revolution-ideologues, and still more so  to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-visionaries who call  themselves Socialists and want a \"free society,\" those are really at one  with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form  of society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd (to the extent even of  repudiating the notions \"master\" and \"servant\"--ni dieu ni maitre, says  a socialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to every  special claim, every special right and privilege (this means ultimately  opposition to EVERY right, for when all are equal, no one needs \"rights\"  any longer); at one in their distrust of punitive justice (as though it  were a violation of the weak, unfair to the NECESSARY consequences of  all former society); but equally at one in their religion of sympathy,  in their compassion for all that feels, lives, and suffers (down to the  very animals, up even to \"God\"--the extravagance of \"sympathy for  God\" belongs to a democratic age); altogether at one in the cry and  impatience of their sympathy, in their deadly hatred of suffering  generally, in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or  ALLOWING it; at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart-softening,  under the spell of which Europe seems to be threatened with a new  Buddhism; at one in their belief in the morality of MUTUAL sympathy, as  though it were morality in itself, the climax, the ATTAINED climax of  mankind, the sole hope of the future, the consolation of the present,  the great discharge from all the obligations of the past; altogether at  one in their belief in the community as the DELIVERER, in the herd, and  therefore in \"themselves.\"    203. We, who hold a different belief--we, who regard the democratic  movement, not only as a degenerating form of political organization, but  as equivalent to a degenerating, a waning type of man, as involving his  mediocrising and depreciation: where have WE to fix our hopes? In  NEW PHILOSOPHERS--there is no other alternative: in minds strong and  original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvalue  and invert \"eternal valuations\"; in forerunners, in men of the future,  who in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which  will compel millenniums to take NEW paths. To teach man the future  of humanity as his WILL, as depending on human will, and to make  preparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in  rearing and educating, in order thereby to put an end to the frightful  rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name of  \"history\" (the folly of the \"greatest number\" is only its last  form)--for that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will  some time or other be needed, at the very idea of which everything that  has existed in the way of occult, terrible, and benevolent beings might  look pale and dwarfed. The image of such leaders hovers before OUR  eyes:--is it lawful for me to say it aloud, ye free spirits? The  conditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for  their genesis; the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which  a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a  CONSTRAINT to these tasks; a transvaluation of values, under the new  pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart  transformed into brass, so as to bear the weight of such responsibility;  and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders, the dreadful  danger that they might be lacking, or miscarry and degenerate:--these  are OUR real anxieties and glooms, ye know it well, ye free spirits!  these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the  heaven of OUR life. There are few pains so grievous as to have seen,  divined, or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and  deteriorated; but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger  of \"man\" himself DETERIORATING, he who like us has recognized the  extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in  respect to the future of mankind--a game in which neither the hand, nor  even a \"finger of God\" has participated!--he who divines the fate that  is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of  \"modern ideas,\" and still more under the whole of Christo-European  morality--suffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared.  He sees at a glance all that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through  a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and  arrangements; he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction how  unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities, and how often  in the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisions  and new paths:--he knows still better from his painfulest recollections  on what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank  have hitherto usually gone to pieces, broken down, sunk, and become  contemptible. The UNIVERSAL DEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of  the \"man of the future\"--as idealized by the socialistic fools and  shallow-pates--this degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely  gregarious animal (or as they call it, to a man of \"free society\"),  this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims, is  undoubtedly POSSIBLE! He who has thought out this possibility to its  ultimate conclusion knows ANOTHER loathing unknown to the rest of  mankind--and perhaps also a new MISSION!        CHAPTER VI. WE SCHOLARS      204. At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that  which it has always been--namely, resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIES,  according to Balzac--I would venture to protest against an improper and  injurious alteration of rank, which quite unnoticed, and as if with the  best conscience, threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations  of science and philosophy. I mean to say that one must have the right  out of one's own EXPERIENCE--experience, as it seems to me, always  implies unfortunate experience?--to treat of such an important question  of rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or AGAINST science  like women and artists (\"Ah! this dreadful science!\" sigh their instinct  and their shame, \"it always FINDS THINGS OUT!\"). The declaration of  independence of the scientific man, his emancipation from philosophy,  is one of the subtler after-effects of democratic organization and  disorganization: the self-glorification and self-conceitedness of  the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom, and in its best  springtime--which does not mean to imply that in this case self-praise  smells sweet. Here also the instinct of the populace cries, \"Freedom  from all masters!\" and after science has, with the happiest results,  resisted theology, whose \"hand-maid\" it had been too long, it now  proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for  philosophy, and in its turn to play the \"master\"--what am I saying!  to play the PHILOSOPHER on its own account. My memory--the memory of  a scientific man, if you please!--teems with the naivetes of insolence  which I have heard about philosophy and philosophers from young  naturalists and old physicians (not to mention the most cultured and  most conceited of all learned men, the philologists and schoolmasters,  who are both the one and the other by profession). On one occasion it  was the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood on the  defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another time  it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refined  luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher, and felt  himself aggrieved and belittled thereby. On another occasion it was the  colour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing in philosophy but  a series of REFUTED systems, and an extravagant expenditure which \"does  nobody any good\". At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of  the boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous, at another  time the disregard of individual philosophers, which had involuntarily  extended to disregard of philosophy generally. In fine, I found most  frequently, behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars,  the evil after-effect of some particular philosopher, to whom on the  whole obedience had been foresworn, without, however, the spell of his  scornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of--the  result being a general ill-will to all philosophy. (Such seems to  me, for instance, the after-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modern  Germany: by his unintelligent rage against Hegel, he has succeeded in  severing the whole of the last generation of Germans from its connection  with German culture, which culture, all things considered, has been  an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE, but  precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself was poor, irreceptive,  and un-German to the extent of ingeniousness.) On the whole, speaking  generally, it may just have been the humanness, all-too-humanness of the  modern philosophers themselves, in short, their contemptibleness, which  has injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the  doors to the instinct of the populace. Let it but be acknowledged to  what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the  world of Heraclitus, Plato, Empedocles, and whatever else all the royal  and magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called, and with what  justice an honest man of science MAY feel himself of a better family and  origin, in view of such representatives of philosophy, who, owing to  the fashion of the present day, are just as much aloft as they are down  below--in Germany, for instance, the two lions of Berlin, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4367"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Complete (#19)"],[1,"of  the road from San Augustin Tlalpam to the city, General Pierce attempted  to accompany them.  He was not sufficiently recovered to do so, and  fainted.  This circumstance gave rise to exceedingly unfair and unjust  criticisms of him when he became a candidate for the Presidency.  Whatever General Pierce's qualifications may have been for the  Presidency, he was a gentleman and a man of courage.  I was not a  supporter of him politically, but I knew him more intimately than I did  any other of the volunteer generals.    General Scott abstained from entering the city at this time, because Mr.  Nicholas P. Trist, the commissioner on the part of the United States to  negotiate a treaty of peace with Mexico, was with the army, and either  he or General Scott thought--probably both of them--that a treaty would  be more possible while the Mexican government was in possession of the  capital than if it was scattered and the capital in the hands of an  invader.  Be this as it may, we did not enter at that time. The army  took up positions along the slopes of the mountains south of the city,  as far west as Tacubaya.  Negotiations were at once entered into with  Santa Anna, who was then practically THE GOVERNMENT and the immediate  commander of all the troops engaged in defence of the country.  A truce  was signed which denied to either party the right to strengthen its  position, or to receive reinforcements during the continuance of the  armistices, but authorized General Scott to draw supplies for his army  from the city in the meantime.    Negotiations were commenced at once and were kept up vigorously between  Mr. Trist and the commissioners appointed on the part of Mexico, until  the 2d of September.  At that time Mr. Trist handed in his ultimatum.  Texas was to be given up absolutely by Mexico, and New Mexico and  California ceded to the United States for a stipulated sum to be  afterwards determined.  I do not suppose Mr. Trist had any discretion  whatever in regard to boundaries. The war was one of conquest, in the  interest of an institution, and the probabilities are that private  instructions were for the acquisition of territory out of which new  States might be carved.  At all events the Mexicans felt so outraged at  the terms proposed that they commenced preparations for defence, without  giving notice of the termination of the armistice.  The terms of the  truce had been violated before, when teams had been sent into the city  to bring out supplies for the army.  The first train entering the city  was very severely threatened by a mob. This, however, was apologized for  by the authorities and all responsibility for it denied; and thereafter,  to avoid exciting the Mexican people and soldiery, our teams with their  escorts were sent in at night, when the troops were in barracks and the  citizens in bed.  The circumstance was overlooked and negotiations  continued.  As soon as the news reached General Scott of the second  violation of the armistice, about the 4th of September, he wrote a  vigorous note to President Santa Anna, calling his attention to it, and,  receiving an unsatisfactory reply, declared the armistice at an end.    General Scott, with Worth's division, was now occupying Tacubaya, a  village some four miles south-west of the City of Mexico, and extending  from the base up the mountain-side for the distance of half a mile.  More than a mile west, and also a little above the plain, stands Molino  del Rey.  The mill is a long stone structure, one story high and several  hundred feet in length.  At the period of which I speak General Scott  supposed a portion of the mill to be used as a foundry for the casting  of guns.  This, however, proved to be a mistake.  It was valuable to the  Mexicans because of the quantity of grain it contained. The building is  flat roofed, and a line of sand-bags over the outer walls rendered the  top quite a formidable defence for infantry.  Chapultepec is a mound  springing up from the plain to the height of probably three hundred  feet, and almost in a direct line between Molino del Rey and the western  part of the city.  It was fortified both on the top and on the rocky and  precipitous sides.    The City of Mexico is supplied with water by two aqueducts, resting on  strong stone arches.  One of these aqueducts draws its supply of water  from a mountain stream coming into it at or near Molino del Rey, and  runs north close to the west base of Chapultepec; thence along the  centre of a wide road, until it reaches the road running east into the  city by the Garita San Cosme; from which point the aqueduct and road  both run east to the city.  The second aqueduct starts from the east  base of Chapultepec, where it is fed by a spring, and runs north-east to  the city.  This aqueduct, like the other, runs in the middle of a broad  road-way, thus leaving a space on each side.  The arches supporting the  aqueduct afforded protection for advancing troops as well as to those  engaged defensively.  At points on the San Cosme road parapets were  thrown across, with an embrasure for a single piece of artillery in  each.  At the point where both road and aqueduct turn at right angles  from north to east, there was not only one of these parapets supplied by  one gun and infantry supports, but the houses to the north of the San  Cosme road, facing south and commanding a view of the road back to  Chapultepec, were covered with infantry, protected by parapets made of  sandbags.  The roads leading to garitas (the gates) San Cosme and Belen,  by which these aqueducts enter the city, were strongly intrenched.  Deep, wide ditches, filled with water, lined the sides of both roads.  Such were the defences of the City of Mexico in September, 1847, on the  routes over which General Scott entered.    Prior to the Mexican war General Scott had been very partial to General  Worth--indeed he continued so up to the close of hostilities--but, for  some reason, Worth had become estranged from his chief.  Scott evidently  took this coldness somewhat to heart.  He did not retaliate, however,  but on the contrary showed every disposition to appease his subordinate.  It was understood at the time that he gave Worth authority to plan and  execute the battle of Molino del Rey without dictation or interference  from any one, for the very purpose of restoring their former relations.  The effort failed, and the two generals remained ever after cold and  indifferent towards each other, if not actually hostile.    The battle of Molino del Rey was fought on the 8th of September.  The  night of the 7th, Worth sent for his brigade and regimental commanders,  with their staffs, to come to his quarters to receive instructions for  the morrow.  These orders contemplated a movement up to within striking  distance of the Mills before daylight.  The engineers had reconnoitred  the ground as well as possible, and had acquired all the information  necessary to base proper orders both for approach and attack.    By daylight on the morning of the 8th, the troops to be engaged at  Molino were all at the places designated.  The ground in front of the  Mills, to the south, was commanded by the artillery from the summit of  Chapultepec as well as by the lighter batteries at hand; but a charge  was made, and soon all was over.  Worth's troops entered the Mills by  every door, and the enemy beat a hasty retreat back to Chapultepec.  Had  this victory been followed up promptly, no doubt Americans and Mexicans  would have gone over the defences of Chapultepec so near together that  the place would have fallen into our hands without further loss.  The  defenders of the works could not have fired upon us without endangering  their own men.  This was not done, and five days later more valuable  lives were sacrificed to carry works which had been so nearly in our  possession on the 8th.  I do not criticise the failure to capture  Chapultepec at this time.  The result that followed the first assault  could not possibly have been foreseen, and to profit by the unexpected  advantage, the commanding general must have been on the spot and given  the necessary instructions at the moment, or the troops must have kept  on without orders.  It is always, however, in order to follow a  retreating foe, unless stopped or otherwise directed.  The loss on our  side at Molino del Rey was severe for the numbers engaged.  It was  especially so among commissioned officers.    I was with the earliest of the troops to enter the Mills.  In passing  through to the north side, looking towards Chapultepec, I happened to  notice that there were armed Mexicans still on top of the building, only  a few feet from many of our men.  Not seeing any stairway or ladder  reaching to the top of the building, I took a few soldiers, and had a  cart that happened to be standing near brought up, and, placing the  shafts against the wall and chocking the wheels so that the cart could  not back, used the shafts as a sort of ladder extending to within three  or four feet of the top.  By this I climbed to the roof of the building,  followed by a few men, but found a private soldier had preceded me by  some other way.  There were still quite a number of Mexicans on the  roof, among them a major and five or six officers of lower grades, who  had not succeeded in getting away before our troops occupied the  building.  They still had their arms, while the soldier before mentioned  was walking as sentry, guarding the prisoners he had SURROUNDED, all by  himself.  I halted the sentinel, received the swords from the  commissioned officers, and proceeded, with the assistance of the  soldiers now with me, to disable the muskets by striking them against  the edge of the wall, and throw them to the ground below.    Molino del Rey was now captured, and the troops engaged, with the  exception of an appropriate guard over the captured position and  property, were marched back to "]]]
