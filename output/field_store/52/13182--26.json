But the runaway couple were  soon to be parted. Eight months passed, and she was dead; and the  youthful widower survived only three years. Old Sir Edward lived  sufficiently long to repent his extravagant habits, for he is said to  have died in poverty at five score and fifteen!    [Illustration: OLD HOUSE NEAR CROSCOMBE.]    [Illustration: BECKINGTON CASTLE.]    Beckington, about four miles to the south of Farleigh, has another  castle, but more a castle in name than anything else. It is a fine  many-gabled house, by all appearances not older than the reign of James  I. or perhaps Elizabeth. It is close against the road, and practically  in the village, where are other lofty houses similar in character. There  is an erroneous tradition that James II. slept here the night before the  battle of Sedgemoor, regardless of the fact that his sacred Majesty was  snug in London. The house was long neglected and deserted, and owing to  stories of ghostly visitors and subterranean passages could not find a  purchaser at L100! But this was many years ago, as will be seen from an  advertisement quoted in an old number of _Notes and Queries_. Things are  different now, for ghosts and subterranean passages have a marketable  value.    Somersetshire abounds in superstitions as well as in old-world villages.  From the southern part of the county come tales of people being  bewitched, and it is a good thing for many an aged crone that their  supposed offences are thought lightly of nowadays.    Some five years ago a notorious \"wise man\" of Somerset, known as Dr.  Stacey, fell down stairs and broke his neck. The doctor's clients  doubtless had expected a more dignified ending to his career, for,  judging from his powers of keeping evil or misfortune at arm's-length,  it was a regular thing for people who had been \"overlooked\" to seek a  consultation so as to get the upper hand of the evil influence. His  patients were usually received at midnight, when incantations were held  and mysterious powders burned. In most instances this was done where  there had been continual losses in stock, or on farms where the cattle  had fallen sick.    A remarkable instance of credulity only the other day came from the East  End of London, which, happening in the twentieth century, is too  astonishing not to be recorded here. A young Jewess sought the aid of a  Russian \"wise woman\" to bring the husband back who had deserted her. The  process was a little complicated. Eighteen pennyworth of candles stuck  all round with pins were burned. Pins also had to be sewn into the  lady's garments, and some \"clippings\" from a black cat had to be burned  in the fire. The cost of these mysterious charms altogether amounted to  nearly six pounds, which was expensive considering the truant husband  did not return. During some recent alterations to an old house near  Kilrush, Ireland, beneath the flooring was discovered a doll dressed  to personify a woman against whom a former occupant owed a deadly  grudge. It was stabbed through the breast with a dagger-shaped hairpin,  which presumably it was hoped would bring about a more speedy death than  the slower process of melting a diminutive waxen effigy.    Cases of ague in Somerset are said to succumb if a spider is captured  and starved to death! Consumptives also are said to be cured by carrying  them through a flock of sheep in the morning when the animals are first  let out of the fold. It is said to bode good luck if, when drinking, a  fly should drop into one's cup or glass. When this happens, we have  somewhere heard, that a person's nationality may be discovered; but beer  must be the liquid. A Spaniard leaves his drink and is mute. A Frenchman  leaves it also untouched, but uses strong language. An Englishman pours  the beer away and orders another glass. A German extracts the fly with  his finger and finishes his beer. A Russian drinks the beer, fly and  all. And a Chinaman fishes out the fly, swallows it, and throws away the  beer.    But enough of these peculiarities.    [Illustration: CROSCOMBE CHURCH.]    [Illustration: CROSCOMBE.]    In the wooded vale between Shepton Mallet and Wells is a pretty  straggling village of whitewashed houses with Tudor mullioned windows  and, some of them, Tudor fireplaces within. This is Croscombe, which,  like Crowcombe in western Somerset, has its village cross, but a  mutilated one, and a church rich in Jacobean woodwork. The canopied  pulpit, dated 1616, and the chancel screen, reaching almost to the roof,  bearing the Royal arms, are perhaps the finest examples of the period to  be found anywhere. An inn, once a priory, near the cross has panelled  ceilings and other features of the fifteenth century. Some old cloth  mills, with their emerald green mill-ponds, are one of the peculiarities  of Croscombe. Shepton Mallet is depressing, perhaps because crape is  manufactured there. A lonely old hostelry to the south of the town known  as \"Cannard's Grave,\" not a cheery sign under the most favourable  circumstances, but with padlocked doors and windows boarded up as we saw  it, had a forbidding look, and seemed to warrant the mysterious stories  that are told about it. The cross in the market-place was erected in  1500, but it has been too scraped and restored to classify it with those  at Cheddar or Malmesbury. The church contains a fine oak roof and some  ancient tombs, mainly to the Strodes, an important Somersetshire family  with Republican tendencies, one of whom harboured the Duke of Monmouth  in his house the night after his defeat at Sedgemoor. The remains of  this house, \"Downside,\" stand about a mile from Shepton Mallet, but it  has been altered and restored from time to time, so that now it has  lost much of its ancient appearance. The pistols which the duke left  here remained in the possession of descendants until about eight years  ago, when they were lost. Monmouth's host, Edward Strode, also owned  what is now called \"Monmouth House,\" from the fact that the duke slept  there on June 23rd and 30th, 1685, upon his march from Bridgwater  towards Bristol and back again. Monmouth's room may yet be seen, and not  many years ago possessed its original furniture.[18]    [Illustration: LYTES CARY MANOR-HOUSE.]    [Illustration: LYTES CARY MANOR-HOUSE.]    [Illustration: FIREPLACE, LYTES CARY.]    At Cannard's Grave we strike into the old Foss way, and if we follow it  through West Lydford towards Ilchester we shall find on the left-hand  side, a quarter of a mile or so from the road, Lytes Cary, one of the  most compact little manor-houses in western England. But the fine old  rooms are bare and almost ruinous. The arms of the Lytes occur in some  shields of arms in the \"decorated\" chapel (which is now a cider cellar),  and upon a projecting bay-window near a fine embattled and pierced  parapet. The hall is entered from the entrance porch (over which is a  graceful oriel), and has its timber roof and rich cornice intact. On the  first floor is a spacious panelled room with Tudor bay-window (dated  1533) and open fireplace, which if carefully restored would make a  delightful dwelling room; and it seems a thousand pities that this and  other apartments dating from the fourteenth century should be in their  present neglected state. The front of the manor-house reminds one of  Great Chaldfield in Wiltshire, but on a smaller scale and exteriorly  less elaborate in architectural detail.    The eastern corner of the western division of Somerset is especially  rich in picturesque old villages and mansions--that is to say, the  country enclosed within or just beyond the four towns Langport,  Somerton, Chard, and Yeovil. Within this area, or a mile or so beyond,  we have the grand seats of Montacute, Brympton D'Eversy, Hinton St  George, and Barrington Court; the smaller but equally interesting  manor-houses of Sandford Orcas, South Petherton, and Tintinhull, and the  quaint old villages and churches of Trent, Martock, Curry Rivel, etc.    [Illustration: ANCIENT SCREEN. CURRY RIVEL CHURCH.]    The ancient county town of Somerton having been left severely alone by  the railway, remains in a very dormant state, and, of course, is  picturesque in proportion, as will be seen by its octagonal canopied  market-cross and the group of buildings adjacent Langport lies low, and  is uninviting, with marshy pools around, with to the north-west  Bridgwater way the villages of Chedzoy, Middlezoy, and Weston Zoyland,  full of memories of the fight at Sedgemoor. The church of Curry Rivel,  to the west of Langport, has many ancient carvings, and retains its  beautiful oak screen and bench-ends of the fifteenth century. Within its  ancient ornamented ironwork railing is a curious Jacobean tomb,  representing the recumbent effigies of two troopers, Marmaduke and  Robert Jennings. It seems selfish that they should thus lie in state  while their wives are kneeling below by two little cribs containing  their children tucked up in orderly rows like mummified bambinoes. On  the summit of a circular arch above, five painted cherubs are reclining  at their ease, and chained to one of the iron railings is a little  coffer which gives a touch of mystery to the whole. What does this  little sealed coffer contain?--for it must have been in its present  position since the monument was erected. Are the warriors' hearts  therein, or the bones of the five bambinoes? There is another Jacobean  tomb, just like a cumbrous cabinet of the period. It is hideous enough  for anything, and obscures one of three interesting fourteenth-century  mural monuments.

Also did God bring trembling and terror over him, that he  might see the peace in which he was at first, and see also the  trembling and terror he endured at the last; so that he might humble  himself before God, and repent of his sin, and seek the peace that he  enjoyed at first.    26 And in the word of God that said, \"I will put seven punishments on  anyone who  kills Cain,\" God was not seeking to kill Cain with the  sword, but He sought to make him die of fasting, and praying and crying  by hard rule, until the time that he was delivered from his sin.    27 And the seven punishments are the seven generations during which God  awaited Cain for the murder of his brother.    28 But as to Cain, ever since he had killed his brother, he could find  no rest in any place; but went back to Adam and Eve, trembling,  terrified, and defiled with blood. . . ."]]]
