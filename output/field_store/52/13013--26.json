It is different from the <i>Blue-fish</i> of the  American coasts, which is of the family <i>Carangidae</i>.    <hw>Blue-Groper</hw>, <i>n</i>. a fish of New South Wales and  Tasmania, <i>Cossyphus gouldii</i>, one of the <i>Labridae</i>  or Wrasses, often called <i>Parrot-Fish</i> in Australia.  Called also <i>Blue-head</i> in Tasmania.  Distinct from the  fish called the <i>Groper</i> (q.v).    <hw>Blue-gum</hw>, <i>n</i>.  See under <i>Gum</i>. It is an  increasing practice to make a single word of this compound, and  to pronounce it with accent on the first syllable, as  `wiseman,' `goodman.'    <hw>Blue-head</hw>, <i>n</i>. Tasmanian name for the fish  called the <i>Blue-Groper</i> (q.v.)    <hw>Blue Lobelia</hw>, <i>n</i>.  The indigenous species in  Tasmania which receives this name is <i>Lobelia gibbosa</i>,  Lab., <i>N.O.

Rev. J. E. Tenison-Woods, `Fish of New South Wales,'  p. 95:    \"On the appearance of a `blue pointer' among boats fishing for  schnapper outside, the general cry is raised, `Look out for the  blue pointer.' . . .  These are high swimming fishes, and may  be readily seen when about pushing their pursuits; the  beautiful azure tint of their back and sides, and independent  manner they have of swimming rapidly and high among the boats  in search of prey, are means of easy recognition, and they  often drive the fishermen away.\"    <hw>Bluestone</hw>, <i>n</i>. a kind of dark stone of which many  houses and public buildings are built.    1850.  `The Australasian' (Quarterly), Oct.

J. Hector, `Handbook to New Zealand,' p. 62:    \"Basalts, locally called `bluestones,' occur of a quality  useful for road-metal, house-blocks, and ordinary rubble  masonry.\"    1890.  `Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania,' p. xx.  [Letter from Mr. S. H. Wintle]:    \"The newer basalts, which in Victoria have filled up so  extensively Miocene and Pliocene valleys, and river channels,  are chiefly vesicular Zeolitic <i>dolerites</i> and  <i>anaemesites</i>, the former being well represented by the  light-coloured Malmsbury `bluestone' so extensively employed in  buildings in Melbourne.\"    <hw>Blue-tongued Lizard</hw>, <i>n</i>. name given to  <i>Tiliqua nigroluteus</i>, Gray, a common Australian and  Tasmanian lizard belonging to the family <i>Scincidae</i>.  The name is derived from its blue-coloured tongue, and on  account of its sluggish habits it is also often called the  Sleepy lizard.    1887.  F. McCoy, `Prodromus of the Zoology of Victoria,' Dec. 14,  pl. 131:    \"Not uncommon about Melbourne, where it is generally called the  `Blue-tongued Lizard,' or `Sleepy Lizard.'\"    <hw>Blue-wing</hw>, <i>n</i>. a sportsman's name (as in England)  for the bird called the <i>Shoveller</i> (q.v.).    <hw>Bluey</hw>, <i>n</i>.

He wraps his bundle in it, and the whole  is called a <i>Swag</i> (q.v.).  <i>To hump bluey</i> means to  go on the tramp, carrying a swag on the back.    (2) In the wet wildernesses of Western Tasmania a rough shirt  or blouse is made of this material, and is worn over the coat  like an English smock-frock.  Sailors and fishermen in England  call it a \"Baltic shirt.\"    1890.  `The Argus,' Aug. 16, p. 13, col. 2:    \"We shall have to hump bluey again.\"    1891.  R.

(`Century.') In New Zealand it is given to <i>Cyttus  australis</i>, family <i>Cyttidae</i>, which is related to the  <i>John Dory</i> (q.v.).  This name is sometimes applied to it,  and it is also called <i>Bastard Dory</i> (q.v.).  In Melbourne  the <i>Boar-fish</i> is <i>Histiopterus recurvirostris</i>,  family <i>Percidae</i>, and <i>Pentaceropsis  recurvirostris</i>, family <i>Pentacerotidae</i>.  Mrs. Meredith, in `Tasmanian Friends and Foes,' 1880 (pl. vi.),  figures <i>Histiopterus recurvirostris</i> with the vernacular  name of <i>Pig-faced Lady</i>.  It is a choice edible fish.    <hw>Boil down</hw>, <i>v</i>. to reduce a statement to its  simplest form; a constant term amongst pressmen.  Over the  reporters' table in the old `Daily Telegraph' office  (Melbourne) there was a big placard with the words-\"Boil it  down.\"  The phrase is in use in England.  `O.E.D.'  quotes  `Saturday Review,' 1880.  The metaphor is from the numerous  boiling-down establishments for rendering fat sheep into  tallow.  See quotation, 1878.    1878.  F. P. Labilliere, `Early History of the Colony of  Victoria,' vol. ii. p. 330:    \"The first step which turned the tide of ill-fortune was the  introduction of the system of boiling down sheep.  When stock  became almost worthless, it occurred to many people that, when  a fleece of wool was worth from half-a-crown to three shillings  in England, and a sheep's tallow three or four more, the value  of the animal in Australia ought to exceed eighteenpence or two  shillings.  Accordingly thousands of sheep were annually boiled  down after shearing . . . until . . . the gold discovery; and  then `boiling down,' which had saved the country, had to be  given up. . . .  The Messrs. Learmonth at Buninyong . . . found  it answered their purpose to have a place of their own, instead  of sending their fat stock, as was generally done, to a public  `boiling down' establishment.\"    1895.  `The Argus,' Aug. 17, p. 8, col. 2:    \"Boiled down, the matter comes to this.\"    <hw>Bonduc Nuts</hw>, <i>n</i>. a name in Australia for the  fruit of the widely distributed plant <i>Caesalpina  bonducella</i>, Flem., <i>N.O. Leguminosae</i>.  Called  <i>Molucca Beans</i> in Scotland and <i>Nicker Nuts</i>  elsewhere.    <hw>Bonito</hw>, <i>n</i>. Sir Frederick McCoy says that the  <i>Tunny</i>, the same fish as the European species <i>Thynnus  thynnus</i>, family <i>Scombridae</i>, or Mackerels, is called  <i>Bonito</i>, erroneously, by the colonists and fishermen. The  true <i>Bonito</i> is <i>Thynnus pelamys</i>, Linn., though the  name is also applied to various other fishes in Europe, the  United States, and the West Indies.    <hw>Bony-Bream</hw>, i.q. <i>Sardine</i> (q.v.).    <hw>Boobook</hw>, <i>n</i>. an owl.  <i>Ninox boobook</i> (see  <i>Owl</i>); <i>Athene boobook</i> (Gould's `Birds of  Australia,' vol.i. pl. 32).\"  From cry or note of bird.  In the  Mukthang language of Central Gippsland, BawBaw, the mountain in  Gippsland, is this word as heard by the English ear.\"  (A. W. Howitt.)  In South Australia the word is used for a  <i>mopoke</i>.    1827.  Vigors and Horsfield, `Transactions of Linnaean  Society,' vol. xv. p. 188:    \"The native name of this bird, as Mr. Caley informs us, is  Buck'buck.  It may be heard nearly every night during winter,  uttering a cry, corresponding with that word. . . .The lower  order of the settlers in New South Wales are led away by the  idea that everything is the reverse in that country to what it  is in England : and the cuckoo, as they call this bird, singing  by night, is one of the instances which they point out.\"    1894.  `The Argus,' June 23, p. 11, col. 4:    \"In most cases--it may not be in all--the familiar call, which  is supposed to sound like `More-pork,' is not the mopoke (or  podargus) at all, but the hooting of a little rusty red  feather-legged owl, known as the Boobook.  Its double note is  the opposite of the curlew, since the first syllable is dwelt  upon and the second sharp.  An Englishman hearing it for the  first time, and not being told that the bird was a `more-pork,'  would call it a night cuckoo.\"    <hw>Booby</hw>, <i>n</i>. English bird-name.  Used in Australia  for the <i>Brown-Gannet</i>.  See <i>Gannet</i>.    <hw>Boobyalla</hw>, or <hw>Boobialla</hw>, <i>n</i>. the  aboriginal name for the tree <i>Acacia longifolia</i>, Willd.,  <i>N.O.

A gentleman by birth, a rich and  successful man, happy in his private life, a great stickler for justice,  as a magistrate severe upon those who cheat and adulterate, a loyal and  patriotic man, and always filled with the desire to promote the  interests of the City which had received him and made him rich.          33. GIFTS AND BEQUESTS.      The stream of charity which has so largely enriched and endowed the City  of London began very early. You have seen how Rahere built and endowed  Bartholomew's, and how Queen Maud founded the Lazar House of St. Giles.  The fourteenth century furnishes many more instances. Thus William  Elsinge founded in 1332 a hospital for a hundred poor blind men: in 1371  John Barnes gave a chest containing 1,000 marks to be lent by the City  to young men beginning trade. You have heard how one Mayor went out to  fight a pirate and slew him and made prizes of his vessels. Another when  corn was very dear imported at his own expense a great quantity from  Germany. Another gave money to relieve poor prisoners: another left  money for the help of poor householders: another provided that on his  commemoration day in the year 2,400 poor householders, of the City  should have a dinner and every man two pence. This means in present  money about L600 a year, or an estate worth L20,000: another left money  to pay the tax called the Fifteenth, for three parishes: another brought  water in a conduit from Highbury to Cripplegate.    But the greatest and wisest benefactor of his time was Whittington. In  his own words: 'The fervent desire and busy intention of a prudent,  wise, and devout man, should be to cast before and make secure the state  and the end of this short life with deeds of mercy and pity, and  especially to provide for those miserable persons whom the penury of  poverty insulteth, and to whom the power of seeking the necessaries of  life by act or bodily labour is interdicted.'    With these grave words, which should be a lesson to all men, rich or  poor, Whittington begins the foundation of his College. If a man were in  these days to found a College he would make it either a school for boys  or a technical school--in any case a place which should be always  _working_ for the world. In those days, when it was universally believed  that the saying of masses was able to lift souls out of punishment, a  man founded a College which should _pray_ for the world. Whittington's  College was to consist of a Master and four Fellows--who were to be  Masters of Arts--with clerks, choristers, and servants. They were every  day to say mass for the souls of Richard and Alice Whittington in the  church of St. Michael's Paternoster Royal--which church Whittington  himself had rebuilt. Behind the church he founded and built an almshouse  for thirteen poor men, who were to have 16_d._ each per week, about  7_s._ of our money, with clothing and rooms on the condition of praying  daily for their founder and his wife. Part of the ground for the  building was granted by the Mayor and Corporation.    The College continued until the Dissolution of the Religious  Houses--that is, for one hundred and fifty years: the almshouse  continues to this day: but it has been removed to Highgate: on its site  the Mercers' Company has established a school.    Whittington, further, built a library for the Franciscan House; part of  the building still remains at Christ's Hospital. It was 129 feet long  and 31 feet broad. He also gave the friars 400_l._ to buy books. He  restored and repaired the Hospital of St. Bartholomew's, to which he  gave a library. He paved and glazed the new building of Guildhall: he  gave large sums for the bridge--and the chapel on the bridge--at  Rochester--as a merchant he was greatly interested in keeping this  important bridge in order: he repaired Gloucester Cathedral--the  cathedral church of his native diocese: he made 'bosses,' i.e. taps of  water, to the great aqueduct: he rebuilt and enlarged Newgate Prison;  and he founded a library at Guildhall.    Many of these things were done after his death by his executors.    Such were the gifts by which a City merchant of the fourteenth and  fifteenth centuries sought to advance the prosperity of the citizens.  Fresh water in plenty by 'bosses' here and there: the light of learning  by means of libraries: almshouses for the poor: mercy and charity for  the prisoners: hospitals for the sick: help for the young: prayers for  the dead. These things he understood.    We cannot expect any man to be greatly in advance of his age. Otherwise  we should find a Whittington insisting upon cleanliness of streets:  fresh air in the house: burial outside the City: the abolition of the  long fasts which made people eat stinking fish and so gave them leprosy:  the education of the craftsmen in something besides their trade: the  establishment of a patrol by police: and the freedom of trade.    He did not found any school. That is a remarkable omission. One of his  successors, Sir William Sevenoke, founded a school for lads of his  native town Sevenoaks: another, Sir Robert Chichele, founded a school,  an almshouse, and a college in his native town of Higham Ferrers. A  friend of his own, Sir John Niel, proposed to establish four new grammar  schools in the City. And yet Whittington left no money for a school. We  may be quite sure that there was a reason for the omission. Perhaps he  was afraid of the growing spirit of doubt and inquiry. Boys who learn  grammar and rhetoric may grow into men who question and argue; and so,  easily and naturally, get bound to the stake and are consumed with the  pile of faggots. Everything was provided except a school for boys.  Libraries for men; but not a school for boys. The City of London School  was founded by Whittington's executor, John Carpenter. There must have  been reasons in Whittington's mind for omitting any endowment of  schools. What those reasons were I cannot even guess.          34. THE PALACES AND GREAT HOUSES.      When you think of a great city of the thirteenth or fourteenth century  you must remember two things. First, that the streets were mostly very  narrow--if you walk down Thames Street and note the streets running  north and south you will be able to understand how narrow the City  streets were. Second, that the great houses of the nobles and the rich  merchants stood in these narrow streets, shut in on all sides though  they often contained spacious courts and gardens. No attempt was made to  group the houses or to arrange them with any view to picturesque effect.    It has been the fashion to speak of mediaeval London as if it were a city  of hovels grouped together along dark and foul lanes. This was by no  means the case. On the contrary, it was a city of splendid palaces and  houses nearly all of which were destroyed by the Great Fire. You have  seen how the City was covered with magnificent buildings of monasteries  and churches. Do not believe that the nobles and rich merchants who  endowed and built these places would be content to live in hovels.    [Illustration: DURHAM, SALISBURY, AND WORCESTER HOUSES.]    The nobles indeed wanted barracks. A great Lord never moved anywhere  without his following. The Earl of Warwick, called the King Maker, when  he rode into London was followed by five hundred men, wearing his  colours: all of these had to find accommodation in his town house. This  was always built in the form of a court or quadrangle. The modern  Somerset House, which is built on the foundations of the old house,  shows us what a great man's house was like: and the College of Heralds  in Queen Victoria Street, is another illustration, for this was Lord  Derby's town house. Hampton Court and St. James's, are illustrations of  a great house with more than one court. Any one who knows the colleges  of Oxford and Cambridge will understand the arrangement of the great  noble's town house in the reign of Richard II. On one side was the hall  in which the banquets took place and all affairs of importance were  discussed. The kitchen, butteries and cellars stood opposite the doors  of the hall; at the back of the hall with a private entrance were the  rooms of the owner and his family: the rest of the rooms on the  quadrangle were given up to the use of his followers.    Baynard's Castle--the name yet survives--stood on the river bank not far  from Blackfriars. It was a huge house with towers and turrets and a  water gate with stairs. It contained two courts. It was at last, after  standing for six hundred years, destroyed in the Great Fire, and was one  of the most lamentable of the losses caused by that disaster. The house  had been twice before burned down, and that which finally perished was  built in 1428. Here Edward IV. assumed the Crown: here he placed his  wife and children for safety before going forth to the Battle of Barnet.  Here Buckingham offered the Crown to Richard. Here Henry VIII. lived.  Here Charles II. was entertained.    Eastward, also on the river bank and near the old Swan Stairs, stood  another great house called Cold Harbour. It belonged to Holland, Dukes  of Exeter, to Richard III. and to Margaret, Countess of Richmond.    North of Thames Street near College Hill was the Erber, another great  house which belonged successively to the Scropes and the Nevilles. Here  lived the King-maker Earl of Warwick. His following was so numerous that  every day six oxen were consumed for breakfast alone. His son-in-law,  who had the house afterwards, was the Duke of Clarence--'false,  fleeting, perjured Clarence.'    If you would know how a great merchant of the fifteenth century loved to  be housed, go visit Crosby Hall. It is the only specimen left of the  ancient wealth and splendour of a City merchant. But as one man lived so  did many. We cannot believe that Crosby was singular in his building a  palace for "]]]
