So when Dorothy was first blown to this place by a cyclone I arranged  to go away with her in a balloon; but the balloon escaped too soon and  carried me back alone.  After many adventures I reached Omaha, only to  find that all my old friends were dead or had moved away.  So, having  nothing else to do, I joined a circus again, and made my balloon  ascensions until the earthquake caught me.\"    \"That is quite a history,\" said Ozma; \"but there is a little more  history about the Land of Oz that you do not seem to  understand--perhaps for the reason that no one ever told it you.  Many  years before you came here this Land was united under one Ruler, as it  is now, and the Ruler's name was always 'Oz,' which means in our  language 'Great and Good'; or, if the Ruler happened to be a woman, her  name was always 'Ozma.'  But once upon a time four Witches leagued  together to depose the king and rule the four parts of the kingdom  themselves; so when the Ruler, my grandfather, was hunting one day, one  Wicked Witch named Mombi stole him and carried him away, keeping him a  close prisoner.  Then the Witches divided up the kingdom, and ruled the  four parts of it until you came here.  That was why the people were so  glad to see you, and why they thought from your initials that you were  their rightful ruler.\"    \"But, at that time,\" said the Wizard, thoughtfully, \"there were two  Good Witches and two Wicked Witches ruling in the land.\"    \"Yes,\" replied Ozma, \"because a good Witch had conquered Mombi in the  North and Glinda the Good had conquered the evil Witch in the South.  But Mombi was still my grandfather's jailor, and afterward my father's  jailor.  When I was born she transformed me into a boy, hoping that no  one would ever recognize me and know that I was the rightful Princess  of the Land of Oz.  But I escaped from her and am now the Ruler of my  people.\"    \"I am very glad of that,\" said the Wizard, \"and hope you will consider  me one of your most faithful and devoted subjects.\"    \"We owe a great deal to the Wonderful Wizard,\" continued the Princess,  \"for it was you who built this splendid Emerald City.\"    \"Your people built it,\" he answered.  \"I only bossed the job, as we say  in Omaha.\"    \"But you ruled it wisely and well for many years,\" said she, \"and made  the people proud of your magical art.  So, as you are now too old to  wander abroad and work in a circus, I offer you a home here as long as  you live.  You shall be the Official Wizard of my kingdom, and be  treated with every respect and consideration.\"    \"I accept your kind offer with gratitude, gracious Princess,\" the  little man said, in a soft voice, and they could all see that  tear-drops were standing in his keen old eyes.  It meant a good deal to  him to secure a home like this.    \"He's only a humbug Wizard, though,\" said Dorothy, smiling at him.    \"And that is the safest kind of a Wizard to have,\" replied Ozma,  promptly.    \"Oz can do some good tricks, humbug or no humbug,\" announced Zeb, who  was now feeling more at ease.    \"He shall amuse us with his tricks tomorrow,\" said the Princess.  \"I  have sent messengers to summon all of Dorothy's old friends to meet her  and give her welcome, and they ought to arrive very soon, now.\"    Indeed, the dinner was no sooner finished than in rushed the Scarecrow,  to hug Dorothy in his padded arms and tell her how glad he was to see  her again.  The Wizard was also most heartily welcomed by the straw  man, who was an important personage in the Land of Oz.    \"How are your brains?\" enquired the little humbug, as he grasped the  soft, stuffed hands of his old friend.    \"Working finely,\" answered the Scarecrow.  \"I'm very certain, Oz, that  you gave me the best brains in the world, for I can think with them day  and night, when all other brains are fast asleep.\"    \"How long did you rule the Emerald City, after I left here?\" was the  next question.    \"Quite awhile, until I was conquered by a girl named General Jinjur.  But Ozma soon conquered her, with the help of Glinda the Good, and  after that I went to live with Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman.\"    Just then a loud cackling was heard outside; and, when a servant threw  open the door with a low bow, a yellow hen strutted in.  Dorothy sprang  forward and caught the fluffy fowl in her arms, uttering at the same  time a glad cry.    \"Oh, Billina!\" she said; \"how fat and sleek you've grown.\"    \"Why shouldn't I?\" asked the hen, in a sharp, clear voice.  \"I live on  the fat of the land--don't I, Ozma?\"    \"You have everything you wish for,\" said the Princess.    Around Billina's neck was a string of beautiful pearls, and on her legs  were bracelets of emeralds.  She nestled herself comfortably in  Dorothy's lap until the kitten gave a snarl of jealous anger and leaped  up with a sharp claw fiercely bared to strike Billina a blow.  But the  little girl gave the angry kitten such a severe cuff that it jumped  down again without daring to scratch.    \"How horrid of you, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy.  \"Is that the way to treat  my friends?\"    \"You have queer friends, seems to me,\" replied the kitten, in a surly  tone.    \"Seems to me the same way,\" said Billina, scornfully, \"if that beastly  cat is one of them.\"    \"Look here!\" said Dorothy, sternly.  \"I won't have any quarrelling in  the Land of Oz, I can tell you!  Everybody lives in peace here, and  loves everybody else; and unless you two, Billina and Eureka, make up  and be friends, I'll take my Magic Belt and wish you both home again,  IMMEJITLY.  So, there!\"    They were both much frightened at the threat, and promised meekly to be  good.  But it was never noticed that they became very warm friends, for  all of that.    And now the Tin Woodman arrived, his body most beautifully  nickle-plated, so that it shone splendidly in the brilliant light of  the room.  The Tin Woodman loved Dorothy most tenderly, and welcomed  with joy the return of the little old Wizard.    \"Sir,\" said he to the latter, \"I never can thank you enough for the  excellent heart you once gave me.  It has made me many friends, I  assure you, and it beats as kindly and lovingly today as it every did.\"    \"I'm glad to hear that,\" said the Wizard.  \"I was afraid it would get  moldy in that tin body of yours.\"    \"Not at all,\" returned Nick Chopper.  \"It keeps finely, being preserved  in my air-tight chest.\"    Zeb was a little shy when first introduced to these queer people; but  they were so friendly and sincere that he soon grew to admire them very  much, even finding some good qualities in the yellow hen.  But he  became nervous again when the next visitor was announced.    \"This,\" said Princess Ozma, \"is my friend Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E.,  who assisted me one time when I was in great distress, and is now the  Dean of the Royal College of Athletic Science.\"    \"Ah,\" said the Wizard; \"I'm pleased to meet so distinguished a  personage.\"    \"H. M.,\" said the Woggle-Bug, pompously, \"means Highly Magnified; and  T. E. means Thoroughly Educated.  I am, in reality, a very big bug, and  doubtless the most intelligent being in all this broad domain.\"    \"How well you disguise it,\" said the Wizard.  \"But I don't doubt your  word in the least.\"    \"Nobody doubts it, sir,\" replied the Woggle-Bug, and drawing a book  from its pocket the strange insect turned its back on the company and  sat down in a corner to read.    Nobody minded this rudeness, which might have seemed more impolite in  one less thoroughly educated; so they straightway forgot him and joined  in a merry conversation that kept them well amused until bed-time  arrived.          16.  Jim, The Cab-Horse      Jim the Cab-horse found himself in possession of a large room with a  green marble floor and carved marble wainscoting, which was so stately  in its appearance that it would have awed anyone else.  Jim accepted it  as a mere detail, and at his command the attendants gave his coat a  good rubbing, combed his mane and tail, and washed his hoofs and  fetlocks.  Then they told him dinner would be served directly and he  replied that they could not serve it too quickly to suit his  convenience.  First they brought him a steaming bowl of soup, which the  horse eyed in dismay.    \"Take that stuff away!\" he commanded.  \"Do you take me for a  salamander?\"    They obeyed at once, and next served a fine large turbot on a silver  platter, with drawn gravy poured over it.    \"Fish!\" cried Jim, with a sniff.  \"Do you take me for a tom-cat?  Away  with it!\"    The servants were a little discouraged, but soon they brought in a  great tray containing two dozen nicely roasted quail on toast.    \"Well, well!\" said the horse, now thoroughly provoked.  \"Do you take me  for a weasel?  How stupid and ignorant you are, in the Land of Oz, and  what dreadful things you feed upon!  Is there nothing that is decent to  eat in this palace?\"    The trembling servants sent for the Royal Steward, who came in haste  and said:    \"What would your Highness like for dinner?\"    \"Highness!\" repeated Jim, who was unused to such titles.    \"You are at least six feet high, and that is higher than any other  animal in this country,\" said the Steward.    \"Well, my Highness would like some oats,\"  declared the horse.    \"Oats?  We have no whole oats,\" the Steward replied, with much  deference.  \"But there is any quantity of oatmeal, which we often cook  for breakfast.  Oatmeal is a breakfast dish,\" added the Steward, humbly.    \"I'll make it a dinner dish,\" said Jim.  \"Fetch it on, but don't cook  it, as you value your life.\"    You see, the respect shown the worn-out old cab-horse made him a little  arrogant, and he forgot he was a guest, never having been treated  otherwise than as a servant since the day he was born, until his  arrival in the Land of Oz.  But the royal attendants did not heed the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4204"],[0,"The Elements of Geology (#19)"],[1,"neve has been compacted to a mass of porous crystalline  ice. Snow has been changed to neve, and neve to glacial ice, both  by pressure, which drives the air from the interspaces of the  snowflakes, and also by successive meltings and freezings, much as  a snowball is packed in the warm hand and becomes frozen to a ball  of ice.    THE BERGSCHRUND. The neve is in slow motion. It breaks itself  loose from the thinner snows about it, too shallow to share its  motion, and from the rock rim which surrounds it, forming a deep  fissure called the bergschrund, sometimes a score and more feet  wide.    SIZE OF GLACIERS. The ice streams of the Alps vary in size  according to the amount of precipitation and the area of the neve  fields which they drain. The largest of Alpine glaciers, the  Aletsch, is nearly ten miles long and has an average width of  about a mile. The thickness of some of the glaciers of the Alps is  as much as a thousand feet. Giant glaciers more than twice the  length of the longest in the Alps occur on the south slope of the  Himalaya Mountains, which receive frequent precipitations of snow  from moist winds from the Indian Ocean. The best known of the many  immense glaciers of Alaska, the Muir, has an area of about eight  hundred square miles (Fig. 95).    GLACIER MOTION. The motion of the glaciers of the Alps seldom  exceeds one or two feet a day. Large glaciers, because of the  enormous pressure of their weight and because of less marginal  resistance, move faster than small ones. The Muir advances at the  rate of seven feet a day, and some of the larger tide glaciers of  Greenland are reported to move at the exceptional rate of fifty  feet and more in the same time. Glaciers move faster by day than  by night, and in summer than in winter. Other laws of glacier  motion may be discovered by a study of Figures 96 and 97. It is  important to remember that glaciers do not slide bodily over their  beds, but urged by gravity move slowly down valley in somewhat the  same way as would a stream of thick mud. Although small pieces of  ice are brittle, the large mass of granular ice which composes a  glacier acts as a viscous substance.    CREVASSES. Slight changes of slope in the glacier bed, and the  different rates of motion in different parts, produce tensions  under which the ice cracks and opens in great fissures called  crevasses. At an abrupt descent in the bed the ice is shattered  into great fragments, which unite again below the icefall.  Crevasses are opened on lines at right angles to the direction of  the tension. TRANSVERSE CREVASSES are due to a convexity in the  bed which stretches the ice lengthwise (Fig. 99). MARGINAL  CREVASSES are directed upstream and inwards; RADIAL CREVASSES are  found where the ice stream deploys from some narrow valley and  spreads upon some more open space. What is the direction of the  tension which causes each and to what is it due?    LATERAL AND MEDIAL MORAINES. The surface of a glacier is striped  lengthwise by long dark bands of rock debris. Those in the center  are called the medial moraines. The one on either margin is a  lateral moraine, and is clearly formed of waste which has fallen  on the edge of the ice from the valley slopes. A medial moraine  cannot be formed in this way, since no rock fragments can fall so  far out from the sides. But following it up the glacial stream,  one finds that a medial moraine takes its beginning at the  junction of the glacier and some tributary and is formed by the  union of their two adjacent lateral moraines. Each branch thus  adds a medial moraine, and by counting the number of medial  moraines of a trunk stream one may learn of how many branches it  is composed.    Surface moraines appear in the lower course of the glacier as  ridges, which may reach the exceptional height of one hundred  feet. The bulk of such a ridge is ice. It has been protected from  the sun by the veneer of moraine stuff; while the glacier surface  on either side has melted down at least the distance of the height  of the ridge. In summer the lowering of the glacial surface by  melting goes on rapidly. In Swiss glaciers it has been estimated  that the average lowering of the surface by melting and  evaporation amounts to ten feet a year. As a moraine ridge grows  higher and more steep by the lowering of the surface of the  surrounding ice, the stones of its cover tend to slip down its  sides. Thus moraines broaden, until near the terminus of a glacier  they may coalesce in a wide field of stony waste.    ENGLACIAL DRIFT. This name is applied to whatever debris is  carried within the glacier. It consists of rock waste fallen on  the neve and there buried by accumulations of snow, and of that  engulfed in the glacier where crevasses have opened beneath a  surface moraine. As the surface of the glacier is lowered by  melting, more or less englacial drift is brought again to open  air, and near the terminus it may help to bury the ice from view  beneath a sheet of debris.    THE GROUND MORAINE. The drift dragged along at the glacier's base  and lodged beneath it is known as the ground moraine. Part of the  material of it has fallen down deep crevasses and part has been  torn and worn from the glacier's bed and banks. While the stones  of the surface moraines remain as angular as when they lodged on  the ice, many of those of the ground moraine have been blunted on  the edges and faceted and scratched by being ground against one  another and the rocky bed.    In glaciers such as those of Greenland, whose basal layers are  well loaded with drift and whose surface layers are nearly clean,  different layers have different rates of motion, according to the  amount of drift with which they are clogged. One layer glides over  another, and the stones inset in each are ground and smoothed and  scratched. Usually the sides of glaciated pebbles are more worn  than the ends, and the scratches upon them run with the longer  axis of the stone. Why?    THE TERMINAL MORAINE. As a glacier is in constant motion, it  brings to its end all of its load except such parts of the ground  moraine as may find permanent lodgment beneath the ice. Where the  glacier front remains for some time at one place, there is formed  an accumulation of drift known as the terminal moraine. In valley  glaciers it is shaped by the ice front to a crescent whose convex  side is downstream. Some of the pebbles of the terminal moraine  are angular, and some are faceted and scored, the latter having  come by the hard road of the ground moraine. The material of the  dump is for the most part unsorted, though the water of the  melting ice may find opportunity to leave patches of stratified  sands and gravels in the midst of the unstratified mass of drift,  and the finer material is in places washed away.    GLACIER DRAINAGE. The terminal moraine is commonly breached by a  considerable stream, which issues from beneath the ice by a tunnel  whose portal has been enlarged to a beautiful archway by melting  in the sun and the warm air (Fig. 107). The stream is gray with  silt and loaded with sand and gravel washed from the ground  moraine. \"Glacier milk\" the Swiss call this muddy water, the gray  color of whose silt proves it rock flour freshly ground by the ice  from the unoxidized sound rock of its bed, the mud of streams  being yellowish when it is washed from the oxidized mantle of  waste. Since glacial streams are well loaded with waste due to  vigorous ice erosion, the valley in front of the glacier is  commonly aggraded to a broad, flat floor. These outwash deposits  are known as VALLEY DRIFT.    The sand brought out by streams from beneath a glacier differs  from river sand in that it consists of freshly broken angular  grains. Why?    The stream derives its water chiefly from the surface melting of  the glacier. As the ice is touched by the rays of the morning sun  in summer, water gathers in pools, and rills trickle and unite in  brooklets which melt and cut shallow channels in the blue ice. The  course of these streams is short. Soon they plunge into deep wells  cut by their whirling waters where some crevasse has begun to open  across their path. These wells lead into chambers and tunnels by  which sooner or later their waters find way to the rock floor of  the valley and there unite in a subglacial stream.    THE LOWER LIMIT OF GLACIERS. The glaciers of a region do not by  any means end at a uniform height above sea level. Each terminates  where its supply is balanced by melting. Those therefore which are  fed by the largest and deepest neves and those also which are best  protected from the sun by a northward exposure or by the depth of  their inclosing valleys flow to lower levels than those whose  supply is less and whose exposure to the sun is greater.    A series of cold, moist years, with an abundant snowfall, causes  glaciers to thicken and advance; a series of warm, dry years  causes them to wither and melt back. The variation in glaciers is  now carefully observed in many parts of the world. The Muir  glacier has retreated two miles in twenty years. The glaciers of  the Swiss Alps are now for the most part melting back, although a  well-known glacier of the eastern Alps, the Vernagt, advanced five  hundred feet in the year 1900, and was then plowing up its  terminal moraine.    How soon would you expect a glacier to advance after its neve  fields have been swollen with unusually heavy snows, as compared  with the time needed for the flood of a large river to reach its  mouth after heavy rains upon its headwaters?    On the surface of glaciers in summer time one may often see large  stones supported by pillars of ice several feet in height (Fig.  108). These \"glacier tables\" commonly slope more or less strongly  to the south, and thus may be used to indicate roughly the points  of the compass. Can you explain their formation and the direction  of their slope? On the"]]]
