In what parts of the earth would this eclipse be visible? What kinds of  solar eclipse would be produced by the new moon at _Q_? In what parts of  the earth would they be visible?    64. THE SHADOW CONE.--The shape and position of the earth's shadow are  indicated in Fig. 33 by the lines drawn tangent to the circles which  represent the sun and earth, since it is only between these lines that  the earth interferes with the free radiation of sunlight, and since both  sun and earth are spheres, and the earth is much the smaller of the two,  it is evident that the earth's shadow must be, in geometrical language,  a cone whose base is at the earth, and whose vertex lies far to the  right of the figure--in other words, the earth's shadow, although very  long, tapers off finally to a point and ends. So, too, the shadow of the  moon is a cone, having its base at the moon and its vertex turned away  from the sun, and, as shown in the figure, just about long enough to  reach the earth.    It is easily shown, by the theorem of similar triangles in connection  with the known size of the earth and sun, that the distance from the  center of the earth to the vertex of its shadow is always equal to the  distance of the earth from the sun divided by 108, and, similarly, that  the length of the moon's shadow is equal to the distance of the moon  from the sun divided by 400, the moon's shadow being the smaller and  shorter of the two, because the moon is smaller than the earth. The  radius of the moon's orbit is just about 1/400th part of the radius of  the earth's orbit--i. e., the distance of the moon from the earth is  1/400th part of the distance of the earth from the sun, and it is this  \"chance\" agreement between the length of the moon's shadow and the  distance of the moon from the earth which makes the tip of the moon's  shadow fall very near the earth at the time of solar eclipses. Indeed,  the elliptical shape of the moon's orbit produces considerable  variations in the distance of the moon from the earth, and in  consequence of these variations the vertex of the shadow sometimes falls  short of reaching the earth, and sometimes even projects considerably  beyond its farther side. When the moon's distance is too great for the  shadow to bridge the space between earth and moon there can be no total  eclipse of the sun, for there is no shadow which can fall upon the  earth, even though the moon does come directly between earth and sun.  But there is then produced a peculiar kind of partial eclipse called  _annular_, or ring-shaped, because the moon, although eclipsing the  central parts of the sun, is not large enough to cover the whole of it,  but leaves the sun's edge visible as a ring of light, which completely  surrounds the moon. Although, strictly speaking, this is only a partial  eclipse, it is customary to put total and annular eclipses together in  one class, which is called central eclipses, since in these eclipses the  line of centers of sun and moon strikes the earth, while in ordinary  partial eclipses it passes to one side of the earth without striking it.  In this latter case we have to consider another cone called the  _penumbra_--i. e., partial shadow--which is shown in Fig. 33 by the  broken lines tangent to the sun and moon, and crossing at the point _V_,  which is the vertex of this cone. This penumbral cone includes within  its surface all that region of space within which the moon cuts off any  of the sunlight, and of course it includes the shadow cone which  produces total eclipses. Wherever the penumbra falls there will be a  solar eclipse of some kind, and the nearer the place is to the axis of  the penumbra, the more nearly total will be the eclipse. Since the moon  stands about midway between the earth and the vertex of the penumbra,  the diameter of the penumbra where it strikes the earth will be about  twice as great as the diameter of the moon, and the student should be  able to show from this that the region of the earth's surface within  which a partial solar eclipse is visible extends in a straight line  about 2,100 miles on either side of the region where the eclipse is  total. Measured along the curved surface of the earth, this distance is  frequently much greater.    Is it true that if at any time the axis of the shadow cone comes within  2,100 miles of the earth's surface a partial eclipse will be visible in  those parts of the earth nearest the axis of the shadow?    65. DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF LUNAR AND SOLAR ECLIPSES.--One marked  difference between lunar and solar eclipses which has been already  suggested, may be learned from Fig. 33. The full moon, _M´_, will be  seen eclipsed from every part of the earth where it is visible at all at  the time of the eclipse--that is, from the whole night side of the  earth; while the eclipsed sun will be seen eclipsed only from those  parts of the day side of the earth upon which the moon's shadow or  penumbra falls. Since the point of the shadow at best but little more  than reaches to the earth, the amount of space upon the earth which it  can cover at any one moment is very small, seldom more than 100 to 200  miles in length, and it is only within the space thus actually covered  by the shadow that the sun is at any given moment totally eclipsed, but  within this region the sun disappears, absolutely, behind the solid body  of the moon, leaving to view only such outlying parts and appendages as  are too large for the moon to cover. At a lunar eclipse, on the other  hand, the earth coming between sun and moon cuts off the light from the  latter, but, curiously enough, does not cut it off so completely that  the moon disappears altogether from sight even in mid-eclipse. The  explanation of this continued visibility is furnished by the broken  lines extending, in Fig. 33, from the earth through the moon. These  represent sunlight, which, entering the earth's atmosphere near the edge  of the earth (edge as seen from sun and moon), passes through it and  emerges in a changed direction, refracted, into the shadow cone and  feebly illumines the moon's surface with a ruddy light like that often  shown in our red sunsets. Eclipse and sunset alike show that when the  sun's light shines through dense layers of air it is the red rays which  come through most freely, and the attentive observer may often see at a  clear sunset something which corresponds exactly to the bending of the  sunlight into the shadow cone; just before the sun reaches the horizon  its disk is distorted from a circle into an oval whose horizontal  diameter is longer than the vertical one (see § 50).    QUERY.--At a total lunar eclipse what would be the effect upon the  appearance of the moon if the atmosphere around the edge of the earth  were heavily laden with clouds?    66. THE TRACK OF THE SHADOW.--We may regard the moon's shadow cone as a  huge pencil attached to the moon, moving with it along its orbit in the  direction of the arrowhead (Fig. 34), and as it moves drawing a black  line across the face of the earth at the time of total eclipse. This  black line is the path of the shadow and marks out those regions within  which the eclipse will be total at some stage of its progress. If the  point of the shadow just reaches the earth its trace will have no  sensible width, while, if the moon is nearer, the point of the cone will  be broken off, and, like a blunt pencil, it will draw a broad streak  across the earth, and this under the most favorable circumstances may  have a breadth of a little more than 160 miles and a length of 10,000 or  12,000 miles. The student should be able to show from the known distance  of the moon (240,000 miles) and the known interval between consecutive  new moons (29.5 days) that on the average the moon's shadow sweeps past  the earth at the rate of 2,100 miles per hour, and that in a general way  this motion is from west to east, since that is the direction of the  moon's motion in its orbit. The actual velocity with which the moon's  shadow moves past a given station may, however, be considerably greater  or less than this, since on the one hand when the shadow falls very  obliquely, as when the eclipse occurs near sunrise or sunset, the  shifting of the shadow will be very much greater than the actual motion  of the moon which produces it, and on the other hand the earth in  revolving upon its axis carries the spectator and the ground upon which  he stands along the same direction in which the shadow is moving. At the  equator, with the sun and moon overhead, this motion of the earth  subtracts about 1,000 miles per hour from the velocity with which the  shadow passes by. It is chiefly on this account, the diminished velocity  with which the shadow passes by, that total solar eclipses last longer  in the tropics than in higher latitudes, but even under the most  favorable circumstances the duration of totality does not reach eight  minutes at any one place, although it may take the shadow several hours  to sweep the entire length of its path across the earth.    According to Whitmell the greatest possible duration of a total solar  eclipse is 7m. 40s., and it can attain this limit only when the eclipse  occurs near the beginning of July and is visible at a place 5° north of  the equator.    The duration of a lunar eclipse depends mainly upon the position of the  moon with respect to the earth's shadow. If it strikes the shadow  centrally, as at _M´_, Fig. 33, a total eclipse may last for about two  hours, with an additional hour at the beginning and end, during which  the moon is entering and leaving the earth's shadow. If the moon meets  the shadow at one side of the axis, as at _P_, the total phase of the  eclipse may fail altogether, and between these extremes the duration of  totality may "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34848"],[0,"Mammals of the San Gabriel Mountains of California (#19)"],[1," Comments on the taxonomy and geographic distribution                 of some North American marsupials, insectivores, and                 carnivores.
