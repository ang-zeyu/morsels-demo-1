I am not offering you my own money.  But  with such inventions as you have exhibited I could easily secure  millions of capital.  Suppose we form a trust, and place them upon the  market.  We'll capitalize it for a hundred millions, and you can have a  quarter of the stock--twenty-five millions.  That would keep you from  worrying about grocery bills.\"    \"But I wouldn't need groceries if I had the tablets,\" said Rob,  laughing.    \"True enough!  But you could take life easily and read your newspaper  in comfort, without being in any hurry to get down town to business.  Twenty-five millions would bring you a cozy little income, if properly  invested.\"    \"I don't see why one should read newspapers when the Record of Events  shows all that is going on in the world,\" objected Rob.    \"True, true!  But what do you say to the proposition?\"    \"I must decline, with thanks.  These inventions are not for sale.\"    The gentleman sighed and resumed his magazine, in which he became much  absorbed.    Rob put on the Character Marking Spectacles and looked at him.  The  letters \"E,\" \"W\" and \"C\" were plainly visible upon the composed,  respectable looking brow of his companion.    \"Evil, wise and cruel,\" reflected Rob, as he restored the spectacles to  his pocket.  \"How easily such a man could impose upon people.  To look  at him one would think that butter wouldn't melt in his mouth!\"    He decided to part company with this chance acquaintance and, rising  from his seat, strolled leisurely up the walk.  A moment later, on  looking back, he discovered that the old gentleman had disappeared.    He walked down State Street to the river and back again, amused by the  activity displayed in this busy section of the city.  But the time he  had allowed himself in Chicago had now expired, so he began looking  around for some high building from the roof of which he could depart  unnoticed.    This was not at all difficult, and selecting one of many stores he  ascended by an elevator to the top floor and from there mounted an iron  stairway leading to the flat roof.  As he climbed this stairway he  found himself followed by a pleasant looking young man, who also seemed  desirous of viewing the city from the roof.    Annoyed at the inopportune intrusion, Rob's first thought was to go  back to the street and try another building; but, upon reflecting that  the young man was not likely to remain long and he would soon be alone,  he decided to wait.  So he walked to the edge of the roof and appeared  to be interested in the scenery spread out below him.    \"Fine view from here, ain't it?\" said the young man, coming up to him  and placing his hand carelessly upon the boy's shoulder.    \"It is, indeed,\" replied Rob, leaning over the edge to look into the  street.    As he spoke he felt himself gently but firmly pushed from behind and,  losing his balance, he plunged headforemost from the roof and whirled  through the intervening space toward the sidewalk far below.    Terrified though he was by the sudden disaster, the boy had still wit  enough remaining to reach out his right hand and move the indicator of  the machine upon his left wrist to the zero mark.  Immediately he  paused in his fearful flight and presently came to a stop at a distance  of less than fifteen feet from the flagstones which had threatened to  crush out his life.    As he stared downward, trying to recover his self-possession, he saw  the old gentleman he had met on the Lake Front standing just below and  looking at him with a half frightened, half curious expression in his  eyes.    At once Rob saw through the whole plot to kill him and thus secure  possession of his electrical devices.  The young man upon the roof who  had attempted to push him to his death was a confederate of the  innocent appearing old gentleman, it seemed, and the latter had calmly  awaited his fall to the pavement to seize the coveted treasures from  his dead body.  It was an awful idea, and Rob was more frightened than  he had ever been before in his life--or ever has been since.    But now the shouts of a vast concourse of amazed spectators reached the  boy's ears.  He remembered that he was suspended in mid-air over the  crowded street of a great city, while thousands of wondering eyes were  fixed upon him.    So he quickly set the indicator to the word \"up,\" and mounted sky-ward  until the watchers below could scarcely see him.  Then he fled away  into the east, even yet shuddering with the horror of his recent escape  from death and filled with disgust at the knowledge that there were  people who held human life so lightly that they were willing to destroy  it to further their own selfish ends.    \"And the Demon wants such people as these to possess his electrical  devices, which are as powerful to accomplish evil when in wrong hands  as they are good!\" thought the boy, resentfully.  \"This would be a fine  world if Electric Tubes and Records of Events and Traveling Machines  could be acquired by selfish and unprincipled persons!\"    So unnerved was Rob by his recent experiences that he determined to  make no more stops.  However, he alighted at nightfall in the country,  and slept upon the sweet hay in a farmer's barn.    But, early the next morning, before any one else was astir, he resumed  his journey, and at precisely ten o'clock of this day, which was  Saturday, he completed his flying trip around the world by alighting  unobserved upon the well-trimmed lawn of his own home.          19.  Rob Makes a Resolution      When Rob opened the front door he came face to face with Nell, who gave  an exclamation of joy and threw herself into his arms.    \"Oh, Rob!\" she cried, \"I'm so glad you've come.  We have all been  dreadfully worried about you, and mother--\"    \"Well, what about mother?\" inquired the boy, anxiously, as she paused.    \"She's been very ill, Rob; and the doctor said to-day that unless we  heard from you soon he would not be able to save her life.  The  uncertainty about you is killing her.\"    Rob stood stock still, all the eager joy of his return frozen into  horror at the thought that he had caused his dear mother so much  suffering.    \"Where is she, Nell?\" he asked, brokenly.    \"In her room.  Come; I'll take you to her.\"    Rob followed with beating heart, and soon was clasped close to his  mother's breast.    \"Oh, my boy--my dear boy!\" she murmured, and then for very joy and love  she was unable to say more, but held him tight and stroked his hair  gently and kissed him again and again.    Rob said little, except to promise that he would never again leave home  without her full consent and knowledge.  But in his mind he contrasted  the love and comfort that now surrounded him with the lonely and  unnatural life he had been leading and, boy though he was in years, a  mighty resolution that would have been creditable to an experienced man  took firm root in his heart.    He was obliged to recount all his adventures to his mother and,  although he made light of the dangers he had passed through, the story  drew many sighs and shudders from her.    When luncheon time arrived he met his father, and Mr. Joslyn took  occasion to reprove his son in strong language for running away from  home and leaving them filled with anxiety as to his fate.  However,  when he saw how happy and improved in health his dear wife was at her  boy's return, and when he had listened to Rob's manly confession of  error and expressions of repentance, he speedily forgave the culprit  and treated him as genially as ever.    Of course the whole story had to be repeated, his sisters listening  this time with open eyes and ears and admiring their adventurous  brother immensely.  Even Mr. Joslyn could not help becoming profoundly  interested, but he took care not to show any pride he might feel in his  son's achievements.    When his father returned to his office Rob went to his own bed-chamber  and sat for a long time by the window in deep thought.  When at last he  aroused himself, he found it was nearly four o'clock.    \"The Demon will be here presently,\" he said, with a thrill of aversion,  \"and I must be in the workshop to receive him.\"    Silently he stole to the foot of the attic stairs and then paused to  listen.  The house seemed very quiet, but he could hear his mother's  voice softly humming a cradle-song that she had sung to him when he was  a baby.    He had been nervous and unsettled and a little fearful until then, but  perhaps the sound of his mother's voice gave him courage, for he boldly  ascended the stairs and entered the workshop, closing and locking the  door behind him.          20.  The Unhappy Fate of the Demon      Again the atmosphere quickened and pulsed with accumulating vibrations.  Again the boy found himself aroused to eager expectancy.  There was a  whirl in the air; a crackling like distant musketry; a flash of  dazzling light--and the Demon stood before him for the third time.    \"I give you greetings!\" said he, in a voice not unkindly.    \"Good afternoon, Mr. Demon,\" answered the boy, bowing gravely.    \"I see you have returned safely from your trip,\" continued the  Apparition, cheerfully, \"although at one time I thought you would be  unable to escape.  Indeed, unless I had knocked that tube from the  rascally Turk's hand as he clambered to the top of the wall, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43607"],[0,"Builders of United Italy (#19)"],[1,"Marseilles press scattered throughout Europe, men were in such a  state of unrest that the burning words became to them a prophetic  writing on the wall. In a hundred ways the contraband pamphlets were  smuggled across frontiers, all classes sent assurances of support  and aid to the young men in Marseilles, everywhere lodges of \"Young  Italy\" were started, and local editors scattered Mazzini's doctrines  through their immediate territories. Priests, attracted by the strong  religious tenor, professional and business men, many of the nobility  even joined the new movement. Garibaldi, a young officer in the Genoese  merchant service, Gioberti, then a teacher at Vercelli, Ruffini, and  his fellow-conspirators working under the very shadow of destruction  at Genoa, enrolled under the new standard of \"God and the People.\" The  old members of the Carbonari, the followers of Buonarotti and his \"veri  Italiani\" joined the ranks, within two years \"Young Italy\" counted  its members by the tens of thousands. Not since the era of the great  Crusades had there been any simultaneous rising to compare with it.    All men who hoped for the coming of a united Italy looked towards  Piedmont as the state by which the first step must be taken. Piedmont  had great military traditions. It supported an efficient army, it was  so situated that it held the key of entrance into Lombardy, and had  the Alps and the Apennines as a base of retreat. In Piedmont there was  moreover an intense national feeling, the House of Savoy was deeply  rooted in the affections of the people, and almost alone among the  Italian sovereignties that House was practically indigenous to the  soil. In Charles Albert Piedmont had just received a king who was an  intense nationalist, to whom the name of \"Italia\" was sacred, and who,  at certain times, seems to have felt that he was destined to drive the  foreigner beyond the Alps. He was no liberal, both his nature and his  priestly advisers counseled him against revolutionary measures, he  had not the sanguine temper of the leader, he was more the theorist  than the actor. Yet with all his temperamental defects the men of  the new generation looked on him as a possible saviour, he had given  countenance to the Carbonari in his youth, and had led the conspirators  of 1821 to believe that he would side with them in any war for Lombard  independence. He had not given such aid as they expected, but he was  still the one sovereign to whom \"Young Italy\" could look with any  measure of hope. Mazzini was never an ardent believer in monarchies,  but now, when his new party was growing with tremendous leaps and  bounds, he felt that even the leadership of a king was better than no  leadership at all. He was ready at this time to sacrifice republicanism  for nationalism; how far he would then have followed a monarchy, if  successful, is a difficult question to decide. He was so much in earnest  that he could not always critically balance the means and the end.    Early in 1831 Mazzini published his famous letter to Charles Albert. It  was the cry of a prophet to a later generation. He pointed out that the  King of Piedmont needed no aid from Austria or France. \"There is a crown  more brilliant and sublime than that of Piedmont, a crown that waits the  man who dares to think of it, who dedicates his life to winning it, and  scorns to dull the splendor with thoughts of petty tyranny. Sire, have  you ever cast an eagle glance upon this Italy, so fair with nature's  smile, crowned by twenty centuries of noble memory, the land of genius,  strong in the infinite resources that only want a common purpose, girt  round with barriers so impregnable, that it needs but a firm will and  a few brave breasts to shelter it from foreign insult? Place yourself  at the head of the nation, write on your flag, 'Union, Liberty,  Independence.' Free Italy from the barbarian, build up the future, be  the Napoleon of Italian freedom. Do this and we will gather round you,  we will give our lives for you, we will bring the little states of Italy  under your flag. Your safety lies on the sword's point, draw it and  throw away the scabbard. But remember, if you do it not, others will do  it without you and against you.\"    Charles Albert had moments of heroism, but they were only too often  followed by moments of overwhelming caution. If he ever read Mazzini's  letter he must have thrilled at the call to save a country he loved  with the whole ardor of his nature. After that first thrill had passed  he must have realized that the time to take such a supreme step had not  come, or that he had not the will to lead it. Once harboring such a  doubt the King became a battle-ground for advisers, and when the short  fight for control of the King's mind was won, the reactionaries proved  themselves the victors. The unfortunate King allowed others to act  against his better judgment; when the fire of revolt next blazed up in  Piedmont the government turned a savage face towards the conspirators.  The little band of revolutionists was hounded without mercy, terror  reigned in Genoa, and the only choice offered the rebels was between  betrayal of their friends and execution. Jacopo Ruffini, one of  Mazzini's dearest boyhood friends, killed himself in prison when offered  such an alternative. The pendulum swung back, gaining momentum thereby  for its coming flight. \"Ideas,\" wrote Mazzini, \"ripen quickly when  nourished by the blood of martyrs.\"    At twenty-eight Mazzini found himself an outcast, hunted at last  from France as he had been before from Italy, living in the closest  concealment in Switzerland, all his hopes tumbling about him. He  tried to organize a band of raiders who should enter Savoy from the  Swiss frontier; they were disrupted by treachery and distrust before  the first shot was fired. Mazzini's health broke under the endless  strain, there were nights when he never went to bed, days when he had  to lie concealed in a goatherd's hut. At times he seemed to find his  only consolation in the white-capped mountains, them he passionately  worshiped, the Alps were always nearest to him after Italy. He had very  few friends, almost no books; there were no presses now to speak his  words to the young hearts of Europe, only occasionally word came to him  that his great idea was growing in the outer world.    In those dark days in Switzerland Mazzini suffered most from the thought  that he had entailed all his family and friends in his vain sacrifice.  His boyhood confidants were dead or in exile, families he loved were  scattered over many countries, the few women he knew well were left  solitary in their homes. The woman he loved he felt he could not ask to  marry him, he had no home to give her, and scarcely knew whether his  next day's food would be forthcoming. He wrote to a friend, \"I wanted to  do good, but I have always done harm to everybody, and the thought grows  and grows until I think I shall go mad. Sometimes I fancy I am hated  by those I love most.\" In all his letters of this period we catch the  note of a spirit torn between pity for sufferings he thinks himself to  have caused, and the stern sense of a duty given him by God. They are  wonderful letters, the thoughts of a man who could put no limits to his  own self-sacrifice nor value too highly the sacrifices of others. In one  letter he wrote: \"I think over it from morning to night, and ask pardon  of my God for having been a conspirator; not that I in the least repent  the reasons for it, or recant a single one of my beliefs, which were and  are and will be a religion to me, but because I ought to have seen that  there are times when a believer should only sacrifice himself to his  belief. I have sacrificed everybody.\"    A great heroic spirit was trying to justify, not its own aims, but the  sorrows it had brought upon others. Mazzini could never have seemed hard  and cold, but in those dark days in Switzerland, and in those later to  come in London, the gentle, humble spirit of him was pre-eminent. He  loved friendship, home life, the arts; he had met his ideal woman; and  yet each and every joy life had to offer him he gave up on the altar of  his duty. \"Duty,\" he said, \"an arid, bare religion, which does not save  my heart a single atom of unhappiness, but still the only one that can  save me from suicide;\" and again he wrote, \"When a man has once said to  himself in all seriousness of thought and feeling, I believe in liberty  and country and humanity, he is bound to fight for liberty and country  and humanity--fight while life lasts, fight always, fight with every  weapon, face all from death to ridicule, face hatred and contempt, work  on because it is his duty, and for no other reason.\"    In 1837 Mazzini gave up the heights of Switzerland for the fogs of  London, moved largely to this change by the fact that in England  he need no longer live in hiding. He did not look forward with any  eagerness to life in England; if the English cared little what political  beliefs refugees brought with them, they were not the people to flame  with interest in a cause. Byron, Mazzini considered more Italian than  English; he could not conceive of poetry as stirring the British blood.  He took cheap lodgings, and set himself to writing for support, finding  time to keep up his correspondence with members of \"Young Italy\"  scattered over Europe, and also time to look after such Italians in  London as were in greater straits than he. The Ruffini family were with  him for a time, then misunderstandings separated them, and the last  tie that bound him to Genoa was gone. He lived the pathetic life of a  literary hack, spending his days working in the British Museum, and his  nights writing in his own small room. The one charm he found about  London was its fog. \"The whole city,\" he wrote, \"seems under a kind of  spell, and reminds me of the witches' scene in Macbeth or the Brocksberg"]]]
