[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2885"],[0,"The House of the Wolfings (#19)"],[1," thrashed through the small wood and bracken of  the thicket-way; and those eight men and their leader came forward,  moving like one, close up to the thicket where I lay, just where the path  passed into the thicket beset by the Sons of the Goths: so near they were  that I could see the dints upon their armour, and the strands of the wire  on their sax-handles.  Down then bowed the tall bracken on the further  side of the wood-lawn, the thicket crashed before the march of men, and  on they strode into the lawn, a goodly band, wary, alert, and silent of  cries.    \"But when they came into the lawn they spread out somewhat to their left  hands, that is to say on the west side, for that way was the clear glade;  but on the east the thicket came close up to them and edged them away.  Therein lay the Goths.    \"There they stayed awhile, and spread out but a little, as men marching,  not as men fighting.  A while we let them be; and we saw their captain,  no big man, but dight with very fair armour and weapons; and there drew  up to him certain Goths armed, the dastards of the folk, and another  unarmed, an old man bound and bleeding.  With these Goths had the captain  some converse, and presently he cried out two or three words of Welsh in  a loud voice, and the nine men who were ahead shifted them somewhat away  from us to lead down the glade westward.    \"The prey had come into the net, but they had turned their faces toward  the mouth of it.    \"Then turned Thiodolf swiftly to the man behind him who carried the war-  horn, and every man handled his weapons: but that man understood, and set  the little end to his mouth, and loud roared the horn of the Markmen, and  neither friend nor foe misdoubted the tale thereof.  Then leaped every  man to his feet, all bow-strings twanged and the cast-spears flew; no man  forebore to shout; each as he might leapt out of the thicket and fell on  with sword and axe and spear, for it was from the bowmen but one shaft  and no more.    \"Then might you have seen Thiodolf as he bounded forward like the wild-  cat on the hare, how he had no eyes for any save the Roman captain.  Foemen enough he had round about him after the two first bounds from the  thicket; for the Romans were doing their best to spread, that they might  handle those heavy cast-spears, though they might scarce do it, just come  out of the thicket as they were, and thrust together by that onslaught of  the kindreds falling on from two sides and even somewhat from behind.  To  right and left flashed Throng-plough, while Thiodolf himself scarce  seemed to guide it: men fell before him at once, and close at his heels  poured the Wolfing kindred into the gap, and in a minute of time was he  amidst of the throng and face to face with the gold-dight captain.    \"What with the sweep of Throng-plough and the Wolfing onrush, there was  space about him for a great stroke; he gave a side-long stroke to his  right and hewed down a tall Burgundian, and then up sprang the white  blade, but ere its edge fell he turned his wrist, and drove the point  through that Captain's throat just above the ending of his hauberk, so  that he fell dead amidst of his folk.    \"All the four kindreds were on them now, and amidst them, and needs must  they give way: but stoutly they fought; for surely no other warriors  might have withstood that onslaught of the Markmen for the twinkling of  an eye: but had the Romans had but the space to have spread themselves  out there, so as to handle their shot-weapons, many a woman's son of us  had fallen; for no man shielded himself in his eagerness, but let the  swiftness of the Onset of point-and-edge shield him; which, sooth to say,  is often a good shield, as here was found.    \"So those that were unslain and unhurt fled west along the glade, but not  as dastards, and had not Thiodolf followed hard in the chase according to  his wont, they might even yet have made a fresh stand and spread from oak-  tree to oak-tree across the glade: but as it befel, they might not get a  fair offing so as to disentangle themselves and array themselves in good  order side by side; and whereas the Markmen were fleet of foot, and in  the woods they knew, there were a many aliens slain in the chase or taken  alive unhurt or little hurt: but the rest fled this way and that way into  the thicket, with whom were some of the Burgundians; so there they abide  now as outcasts and men unholy, to be slain as wild-beasts one by one as  we meet them.    \"Such then was the battle in Mirkwood.  Give me the mead-horn that I may  drink to the living and the dead, and the memory of the dead, and the  deeds of the living that are to be.\"    So they brought him the horn, and he waved it over his head and drank  again and spake:    \"Sixty and three dead men of the Romans we counted there up and down that  oak-glade; and we cast earth over them; and three dead dastards of the  Goths, and we left them for the wolves to deal with.  And twenty-five men  of the Romans we took alive to be for hostages if need should be, and  these did we Shielding men, who are not very many, bring aback to the  wain-burg; and the Daylings, who are a great company, were appointed to  enter the wood and be with Thiodolf; and me did Otter bid to bear the  tidings, even as I have told you.  And I have not loitered by the way.\"    Great then was the joy in the Hall; and they took Gisli, and made much of  him, and led him to the bath, and clad him in fine raiment taken from the  coffer which was but seldom opened, because the cloths it held were  precious; and they set a garland of green wheat-ears on his head.  Then  they fell to and spread the feast in the hall; and they ate and drank and  were merry.    But as for speeding the tidings, the Hall-Sun sent two women and two  lads, all a-horseback, to bear the words: the women to remember the words  which she taught them carefully, the lads to be handy with the horses, or  in the ford, or the swimming of the deeps, or in the thicket.  So they  went their ways, down the water: one pair went on the western side, and  the other crossed Mirkwood-water at the shallows (for being Midsummer the  water was but small), and went along the east side, so that all the  kindred might know of the tidings and rejoice.    Great was the glee in the Hall, though the warriors of the House were  away, and many a song and lay they sang: but amidst the first of the  singing they bethought them of the old woman, and would have bidden her  tell them some tale of times past, since she was so wise in the ancient  lore.  But when they sought for her on all sides she was not to be found,  nor could anyone remember seeing her depart from the Hall.  But this had  they no call to heed, and the feast ended, as it began, in great glee.    Albeit the Hall-Sun was troubled about the carline, both that she had  come, and that she had gone: and she determined that the next time she  met her she would strive to have of her a true tale of what she was, and  of all that was toward.          CHAPTER XIII--THE HALL-SUN SAITH ANOTHER WORD      It was no later than the next night, and a many of what thralls were not  with the host were about in the feast-hall with the elders and lads and  weaklings of the House; for last night's tidings had drawn them thither.  Gisli had gone back to his kindred and the wain-burg in the Upper-mark,  and the women were sitting, most of them, in the Women's-Chamber, some of  them doing what little summer work needed doing about the looms, but more  resting from their work in field and acre.    Then came the Hall-Sun forth from her room clad in glittering raiment,  and summoned no one, but went straight to her place on the dais under her  namesake the Lamp, and stood there a little without speaking.  Her face  was pale now, her lips a little open, her eyes set and staring as if they  saw nothing of all that was round about her.    Now went the word through the Hall and the Women's-Chamber that the Hall-  Sun would speak again, and that great tidings were toward; so all folk  came flock-meal to the dais, both thralls and free; and scarce were all  gathered there, ere the Hall-Sun began speaking, and said:       \"The days of the world thrust onward, and men are born therein     A many and a many, and divers deeds they win     In the fashioning of stories for the kindreds of the earth,     A garland interwoven of sorrow and of mirth.     To the world a warrior cometh; from the world he passeth away,     And no man then may sunder his good from his evil day.     By the Gods hath he been tormented, and been smitten by the foe:     He hath seen his maiden perish, he hath seen his speech-friend go:     His heart hath conceived a joyance and hath brought it unto birth:     But he hath not carried with him his sorrow or his mirth.     He hath lived, and his life hath fashioned the outcome of the deed,     For the blossom of the people, and the coming kindreds' seed.       \"Thus-wise the world is fashioned, and the new sun of the morn     Where earth last night was desert beholds a kindred born,     That to-morrow and to-morrow blossoms all gloriously     With many a man and maiden for the kindreds yet to be,     And fair the Goth-folk groweth.  And yet the story saith     That the deeds that make the summer make too the winter's death,     That summer-tides unceasing from out the grave may grow     And the spring rise up unblemished from the bosom of the snow.       \"Thus as to every kindred the day comes once for all     When yesterday it was not, and to-day it builds the hall,     So every kindred bideth the night-tide of the day,     Whereof it knoweth nothing, e'en when noon is past away.     E'en thus the House of the Wolfings 'twixt dusk and dark doth stand,     And narrow is the pathway with the deep on either hand.     On the left are the days forgotten, on the right the days to come,     And another folk and their story in the stead "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2888"],[0,"Yorkshire Dialect Poems (1673-1915) and traditional poems (#19)"],[1," her at fast(4) did weer             A braadal band          Bun' roond her leg; gie her a cheer:       Sea sip it, an' tip it, bud tip it doon your wizan.
