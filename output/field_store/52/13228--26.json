It is admitted without argument  that men have the right to form among themselves associations and  communities, to organize sects, parties, companies, churches, clubs, or  any other union they may choose to create, provided, of course, such  bodies are not inimical to law and order. It is further admitted that  any established association of men may enact laws and ordain rules  for the government of its members, provided the rights of individual  liberty are not infringed thereby. Both church and state, therefore,  may enact, prescribe, and ordain, lawful regulations as to marriage or  as to any other form of contract; and such regulations are acknowledged  to be of full effect within the domain of actual jurisdiction. Thus,  marriages may be legally and properly authorized by states and nations,  and the contracts of marriage so made are effective during the life of  the parties thereto.    But, can it be said that any association of men may create and  establish an authority that shall be effective after death? Can any  power legislate beyond its lawful jurisdiction? Can a man sitting in  his own home prescribe family rules for the household of his neighbor?  Can our nation ordain laws that shall be valid in a foreign {104}  realm? Can man enact laws to regulate the affairs of the Kingdom of God?    Only as God delegates authority to man, with the assurance that  administration under that authority shall be acknowledged in heaven,  can any contract be made on earth and be of assured effect after the  death of the parties concerned. Authority to act in the name of the  Lord is the distinguishing characteristic of the Holy Priesthood. As  the Lord hath said:        \"All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows,      performances, connections, associations, or expectations, that      are not made, and entered into, and sealed, by the Holy Spirit of      promise, of him who is anointed, both as well for time and for all      eternity, and that too most holy, by revelation and commandment      through the medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on      the earth to hold this power, * * * are of no efficacy, virtue      or force, in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all      contracts that are not made unto this end, have an end when men are      dead.\"[25]    In application of this principle to the covenants of matrimony, the  revelation continues:        \"Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry      her not by me, nor by my word; and he covenant with her so long as      he is in the world, and she with him, their covenant and marriage      are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the      world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out      of the world.        \"Therefore, when they are out of the world, they neither marry, nor      are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which      angels are ministering servants, to minister {105} for those who      are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight      of glory;        \"For these angels did not abide my law, therefore they cannot be      enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in      their saved condition, to all eternity, and from henceforth are not      gods, but are angels of God, for ever and ever.\"[26]    This system of holy matrimony, involving covenants for both time and  eternity, is known distinctively as _Celestial Marriage_, and is  understood to be the order of marriage that exists in the celestial  worlds. This sacred ordinance is administered by the Church to those  only who are adjudged to be of worthy life, fit to be admitted to  the House of the Lord; for this holy rite, together with others of  eternal validity, may be solemnized only within the temples reared and  dedicated for such exalted service.[27] Children born to parents thus  married under the celestial law are heirs to the Priesthood; \"children  of the covenant\" they are called; no ordinance of adoption or sealing  is required to give them place in the blessed posterity of promise.    The Church, however, sanctions and acknowledges legal marriages for  time only, and indeed solemnizes such unions between parties who may  not be admitted to the House of the Lord, or who voluntarily choose the  lesser and temporal order of matrimony.    Within the temple and not elsewhere, are marriages solemnized for and  in behalf of parties who are dead. Husbands and wives who have lived in  mortality together and now are dead, may be sealed under the authority  {106} of the Priesthood, provided, of course, the preliminary temple  ordinances have been administered in their behalf. In the marriage rite  for the dead as in other ordinances, the parties are represented by  their living descendants acting in the capacity of proxy.    The ordinance of celestial marriage, whereby the contracting parties,  whether living or dead, are united under the authority of the Holy  Priesthood for time and eternity, is known distinctively as the  ceremony of _Sealing in Marriage_. Husband and wife so united are said  to be sealed, whereas if united under the lesser law for time only,  either by secular or ecclesiastical authority, they are only married.    Husband and wife who have been married for time only, either by  secular or ecclesiastical ceremony, may afterward be sealed for time  and eternity, provided they have become members of the Church, and  are adjudged worthy to enter the temple for this purpose; but no  such confirmation of an existing union, nor any sealing of married  persons is possible unless the parties furnish proof that they have  been legally and lawfully married. No marriage of living persons is  performed in any of the temples except under license duly issued as  required by the laws of the state. The sealing ordinance extends to  other associations than those of matrimony as will be shown.    The actuality of the sealing ordinance in marriage finds an  illustration in the personal teachings of the Savior. On one occasion  there came unto Him certain Sadducees,[28] and these, be it remembered,  denied the possibility of the {107} resurrection of the dead. They  sought to entrap Him by a difficult question. They thus stated their  case:        \"Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother      shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.        \"Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had      married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto      his brother:        \"Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.        \"And last of all the woman died also.        \"Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the      seven? for they all had her.\"    Note the sequel:        \"Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the      scriptures, nor the power of God.        \"For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in      marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.\"    It is evident that in the resurrected state there could be no contest  among the seven brothers as to whose wife the woman was,--for after  death there was to be no marrying nor giving in marriage. The question  of marriage between individuals was and is to be settled before that  time. The woman would and could be the wife of but one in the eternal  world, and that one the man to whom she was given by the authority of  the Holy Priesthood on earth, as a consort for time and eternity. In  short, the woman would be the wife of the man with whom she entered  into covenant for eternity under the seal of Divine authority; and  no contract or agreement for time only would be effective in the  resurrection.    {108} This exposition seems to have been convincing; the multitude  were astonished, and the Sadducees were silenced;[29] moreover some  of the Scribes declared: \"Master, thou hast well said.\"[30] Our Lord  added what appears to have been a supplementary question, coupled with  instruction of the greatest import:        \"But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read      that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,        \"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of      Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.\"[31]    OTHER SEALING ORDINANCES    Children born outside celestial marriage, yet within legally  established wedlock, are the lawful and legitimate heirs of their  parents in all affairs of earth. They are the offspring of an earthly  union that is in every respect a legal, moral, and proper relation  under the laws of man. That these children will belong to their parents  in the hereafter is as uncertain as that the parents will belong to  each other. The parents have been but temporally and temporarily  married, and the offspring are theirs for the period of their own  contract only. Even as husband and wife though legally wedded under the  secular law must be sealed by the authority of the Holy Priesthood if  their union is to be valid in eternity, so must children who have been  born to parents married for time only be sealed to their parents after  father and {109} mother have been sealed to each other in the order of  celestial marriage.    The Church affirms the eternal perpetuity of all family relationships  existing on earth under the seal and authority of the Priesthood; and  declares that none other relationship will be binding after death. The  offspring of parents not joined in celestial marriage are thus sealed  to or adopted by their parents as members of the family organization  which shall endure through eternity; thus, husbands and wives who are  dead are married or sealed to each other by proxy ministration, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4524"],[0,"Familiar Letters on Chemistry, and Its Relation to Commerce, Physiology, and (#19)"],[1,"phosphates, but abound in insoluble  earthy phosphates, as hay, carrots, and potatoes, the urine will be  free from alkaline phosphates, but the earthy phosphates will be  found in the faeces. The urine of man, of carnivorous and  graminivorous animals, contains alkaline phosphates; that of  herbivorous animals is free from these salts.    The analysis of the excrements of man, of the piscivorous birds (as  the guano), of the horse, and of cattle, furnishes us with the  precise knowledge of the salts they contain, and demonstrates, that  in those excrements, we return to the fields the ashes of the plants  which have served as food,--the soluble and insoluble salts and  earths indispensable to the development of cultivated plants, and  which must be furnished to them by a fertile soil.    There can be no doubt that, in supplying these excrements to the  soil, we return to it those constituents which the crops have  removed from it, and we renew its capability of nourishing new  crops: in one word, we restore the disturbed equilibrium; and  consequently, knowing that the elements of the food derived from the  soil enter into the urine and solid excrements of the animals it  nourishes, we can with the greatest facility determine the exact  value of the different kinds of manure. Thus the excrements of pigs  which we have fed with peas and potatoes are principally suited for  manuring crops of potatoes and peas. In feeding a cow upon hay and  turnips, we obtain a manure containing the inorganic elements of  grasses and turnips, and which is therefore preferable for manuring  turnips. The excrement of pigeons contains the mineral elements of  grain; that of rabbits, the elements of herbs and kitchen  vegetables. The fluid and solid excrements of man, however, contain  the mineral elements of grain and seeds in the greatest quantity.          LETTER XV      My dear Sir,    You are now acquainted with my opinions respecting the effects of  the application of mineral agents to our cultivated fields, and also  the rationale of the influence of the various kinds of manures; you  will, therefore, now readily understand what I have to say of the  sources whence the carbon and nitrogen, indispensable to the growth  of plants, are derived.    The growth of forests, and the produce of meadows, demonstrate that  an inexhaustible quantity of carbon is furnished for vegetation by  the carbonic acid of the atmosphere.    We obtain from an equal surface of forest, or meadow-land, where the  necessary mineral elements of the soil are present in a suitable  state, and to which no carbonaceous matter whatever is furnished in  manures, an amount of carbon, in the shape of wood and hay, quite  equal, and oftimes more than is produced by our fields, in grain,  roots, and straw, upon which abundance of manure has been heaped.    It is perfectly obvious that the atmosphere must furnish to our  cultivated fields as much carbonic acid, as it does to an equal  surface of forest or meadow, and that the carbon of this carbonic  acid is assimilated, or may be assimilated by the plants growing  there, provided the conditions essential to its assimilation, and  becoming a constituent element of vegetables, exist in the soil of  these fields.    In many tropical countries the produce of the land in grain or  roots, during the whole year, depends upon one rain in the spring.  If this rain is deficient in quantity, or altogether wanting, the  expectation of an abundant harvest is diminished or destroyed.    Now it cannot be the water merely which produces this enlivening and  fertilising effect observed, and which lasts for weeks and months.  The plant receives, by means of this water, at the time of its first  development, the alkalies, alkaline earths, and phosphates,  necessary to its organization. If these elements, which are  necessary previous to its assimilation of atmospheric nourishment,  be absent, its growth is retarded. In fact, the development of a  plant is in a direct ratio to the amount of the matters it takes up  from the soil. If, therefore, a soil is deficient in these mineral  constituents required by plants, they will not flourish even with an  abundant supply of water.    The produce of carbon on a meadow, or an equal surface of forest  land, is independent of a supply of carbonaceous manure, but it  depends upon the presence of certain elements of the soil which in  themselves contain no carbon, together with the existence of  conditions under which their assimilation by plants can be effected.  We increase the produce of our cultivated fields, in carbon, by a  supply of lime, ashes, and marl, substances which cannot furnish  carbon to the plants, and yet it is indisputable,--being founded  upon abundant experience,--that in these substances we furnish to  the fields elements which greatly increase the bulk of their  produce, and consequently the amount of carbon.    If we admit these facts to be established, we can no longer doubt  that a deficient produce of carbon, or in other words, the  barrenness of a field does not depend upon carbonic acid, because we  are able to increase the produce, to a certain degree, by a supply  of substances which do not contain any carbon. The same source  whence the meadow and the forest are furnished with carbon, is also  open to our cultivated plants. The great object of agriculture,  therefore, is to discover the means best adapted to enable these  plants to assimilate the carbon of the atmosphere which exists in it  as carbonic acid. In furnishing plants, therefore, with mineral  elements, we give them the power to appropriate carbon from a source  which is inexhaustible; whilst in the absence of these elements the  most abundant supply of carbonic acid, or of decaying vegetable  matter, would not increase the produce of a field.    With an adequate and equal supply of these essential mineral  constituents in the soil, the amount of carbonic acid absorbed by a  plant from the atmosphere in a given time is limited by the quantity  which is brought into contact with its organs of absorption.    The withdrawal of carbonic acid from the atmosphere by the vegetable  organism takes place chiefly through its leaves; this absorption  requires the contact of the carbonic acid with their surface, or  with the part of the plant by which it is absorbed.    The quantity of carbonic acid absorbed in a given time is in direct  proportion to the surface of the leaves and the amount of carbonic  acid contained in the air; that is, two plants of the same kind and  the same extent of surface of absorption, in equal times and under  equal conditions, absorb one and the same amount of carbon.    In an atmosphere containing a double proportion of carbonic acid, a  plant absorbs, under the same condition, twice the quantity of  carbon. Boussingault observed, that the leaves of the vine, inclosed  in a vessel, withdrew all the carbonic acid from a current of air  which was passed through it, however great its velocity. (Dumas  Lecon, p.23.) If, therefore, we supply double the quantity of  carbonic acid to one plant, the extent of the surface of which is  only half that of another living in ordinary atmospheric air, the  former will obtain and appropriate as much carbon as the latter.  Hence results the effects of humus, and all decaying organic  substances, upon vegetation. If we suppose all the conditions for  the absorption of carbonic acid present, a young plant will increase  in mass, in a limited time, only in proportion to its absorbing  surface; but if we create in the soil a new source of carbonic acid,  by decaying vegetable substances, and the roots absorb in the same  time three times as much carbonic acid from the soil as the leaves  derive from the atmosphere, the plant will increase in weight  fourfold. This fourfold increase extends to the leaves, buds,  stalks, &c., and in the increased extent of the surface, the plant  acquires an increased power of absorbing nourishment from the air,  which continues in action far beyond the time when its derivation of  carbonic acid through the roots ceases. Humus, as a source of  carbonic acid in cultivated lands, is not only useful as a means of  increasing the quantity of carbon--an effect which in most cases may  be very indifferent for agricultural purposes--but the mass of the  plant having increased rapidly in a short time, space is obtained  for the assimilation of the elements of the soil necessary for the  formation of new leaves and branches.    Water evaporates incessantly from the surface of the young plant;  its quantity is in direct proportion to the temperature and the  extent of the surface. The numerous radical fibrillae replace, like  so many pumps, the evaporated water; and so long as the soil is  moist, or penetrated with water, the indispensable elements of the  soil, dissolved in the water, are supplied to the plant. The water  absorbed by the plant evaporating in an aeriform state leaves the  saline and other mineral constituents within it. The relative  proportion of these elements taken up by a plant, is greater, the  more extensive the surface and more abundant the supply of water;  where these are limited, the plant soon reaches its full growth,  while if their supply is continued, a greater amount of elements  necessary to enable it to appropriate atmospheric nourishment being  obtained, its development proceeds much further. The quantity, or  mass of seed produced, will correspond to the quantity of mineral  constituents present in the plant. That plant, therefore, containing  the most alkaline phosphates and earthy salts will produce more or a  greater weight of seeds than another which, in an equal time has  absorbed less of them. We consequently observe, in a hot summer,  when a further supply of mineral ingredients from the soil ceases  through want of water, that the height and strength of plants, as  well as the"]]]
