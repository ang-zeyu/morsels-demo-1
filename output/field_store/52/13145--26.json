Sandro, after many a hearty laugh, hied him to  the Lord, who at his instance sent for Martellino. The messengers found  Martellino still in his shirt before the deputy, at his wits' end, and all  but beside himself with fear, because the deputy would hear nothing that he  said in his defence. Indeed, the deputy, having a spite against Florentines,  had quite made up his mind to have him hanged; he was therefore in the last  degree reluctant to surrender him to the Lord, and only did so upon  compulsion. Brought at length before the Lord, Martellino detailed to him  the whole affair, and prayed him as the greatest of favours to let him  depart in peace. The Lord had a hearty laugh over the adventure, and  bestowed a tunic on each of the three. So, congratulating themselves on  their unexpected deliverance from so great a peril, they returned home safe  and sound.      NOVEL II.    --  Rinaldo d'Asti is robbed, arrives at Castel Guglielmo, and is entertained by  a widow lady; his property is restored to him, and he returns home safe and  sound.  --    The ladies and the young men, especially Filostrato, laughed inordinately at  Neifile's narrative of Martellino's misadventures. Then Filostrato, who sate  next Neifile, received the queen's command to follow her, and promptly thus  began:--    Fair ladies, 'tis on my mind to tell you a story in which are mingled things  sacred and passages of adverse fortune and love, which to hear will  perchance be not unprofitable, more especially to travellers in love's  treacherous lands; of whom if any fail to say St. Julian's paternoster, it  often happens that, though he may have a good bed, he is ill lodged.    Know, then, that in the time of the Marquis Azzo da Ferrara, a merchant,  Rinaldo d'Asti by name, having disposed of certain affairs which had brought  him to Bologna, set his face homeward, and having left Ferrara behind him  was on his way to Verona, when he fell in with some men that looked like  merchants, but were in truth robbers and men of evil life and condition,  whose company he imprudently joined, riding and conversing with them. They,  perceiving that he was a merchant, and judging that he must have money about  him, complotted to rob him on the first opportunity; and to obviate  suspicion they played the part of worthy and reputable men, their discourse  of nought but what was seemly and honourable and leal, their demeanour at  once as respectful and as cordial as they could make it; so that he deemed  himself very lucky to have met with them, being otherwise alone save for a  single mounted servant. Journeying thus, they conversed after the desultory  manner of travellers, of divers matters, until at last they fell a talking  of the prayers which men address to God, and one of the robbers--there were  three of them--said to Rinaldo:--\"And you, gentle sir, what is your wonted  orison when you are on your travels?\" Rinaldo answered:--\"Why, to tell the  truth, I am a man unskilled, unlearned in such matters, and few prayers have  I at my command, being one that lives in the good old way and lets two soldi  count for twenty-four deniers; nevertheless it has always been my custom in  journeying to say of a morning, as I leave the inn, a paternoster and an  avemaria for the souls of the father and mother of St. Julian, after which I  pray God and St. Julian to provide me with a good inn for the night. And  many a time in the course of my life have I met with great perils by the  way, and evading them all have found comfortable quarters for the night:  whereby my faith is assured, that St. Julian, in whose honour I say my  paternoster, has gotten me this favour of God; nor should I look for a  prosperous journey and a safe arrival at night, if I had not said it in the  morning.\" Then said his interrogator:--\"And did you say it this morning?\"  Whereto Rinaldo answered, \"Troth, did I,\" which caused the other, who by  this time knew what course matters would take, to say to himself:--\"'Twill  prove to have been said in the nick of time; for if we do not miscarry, I  take it thou wilt have but a sorry lodging.\" Then turning to Rinaldo he  said:--\"I also have travelled much, and never a prayer have I said though I  have heard them much, commended by many, nor has it ever been my lot to find  other than good quarters for the night; it may be that this very evening you  will be able to determine which of us has the better lodging, you that have  said the paternoster, or I that have not said it. True, however, it is that  in its stead I am accustomed to say the 'Dirupisti,' or the 'Intemerata,' or  the 'De profundis,' which, if what my grandmother used to say is to be  believed, are of the greatest efficacy.\" So, talking of divers matters, and  ever on the look-out for time and place suited to their evil purpose, they  continued their journey, until towards evening, some distance from Castel  Guglielmo, as they were about to ford a stream, these three ruffians,  profiting by the lateness of the hour, and the loneliness and straitness of  the place, set upon Rinaldo and robbed him, and leaving him afoot and in his  shirt, said by way of adieu:--\"Go now, and see if thy St. Julian will  provide thee with good lodging to-night; our saint, we doubt not, will do as  much by us;\" and so crossing the stream, they went their way. Rinaldo's  servant, coward that he was, did nothing to help his master when he saw him  attacked, but turned his horse's head, and was off at a smart pace; nor did  he draw rein until he was come to Castel Guglielmo; where, it being now  evening, he put up at an inn and gave himself no further trouble. Rinaldo,  left barefoot, and stripped to his shirt, while the night closed in very  cold and snowy, was at his wits' end, and shivering so that his teeth  chattered in his head, began to peer about, if haply he might find some  shelter for the night, that so he might not perish with the cold; but,  seeing none (for during a recent war the whole country had been wasted by  fire), he set off for Castel Guglielmo, quickening his pace by reason of the  cold. Whether his servant had taken refuge in Castel Guglielmo or elsewhere,  he knew not, but he thought that, could he but enter the town, God would  surely send him some succour. However, dark night overtook him while he was  still about a mile from the castle; so that on his arrival he found the  gates already locked and the bridges raised, and he could not pass in. Sick  at heart, disconsolate and bewailing his evil fortune, he looked about for  some place where he might ensconce himself, and at any rate find shelter  from the snow. And by good luck he espied a house, built with a balcony a  little above the castle-wall, under which balcony he purposed to shelter  himself until daybreak. Arrived at the spot, he found beneath the balcony a  postern, which, however, was locked; and having gathered some bits of straw  that lay about, he placed them in front of the postern, and there in sad and  sorrowful plight took up his quarters, with many a piteous appeal to St.  Julian, whom he reproached for not better rewarding the faith which he  reposed in him. St. Julian, however, had not abandoned him, and in due time  provided him with a good lodging.    There was in the castle a widow lady of extraordinary beauty (none fairer)  whom Marquis Azzo loved as his own life, and kept there for his pleasure.  She lived in the very same house beneath the balcony of which Rinaldo had  posted himself. Now it chanced that that very day the Marquis had come to  Castel Guglielmo to pass the night with her, and had privily caused a bath  to be made ready, and a supper suited to his rank, in the lady's own house.  The arrangements were complete; and only the Marquis was stayed for, when a  servant happened to present himself at the castle-gate, bringing tidings for  the Marquis which obliged him suddenly to take horse. He therefore sent word  to the lady that she must not wait for him, and forthwith took his  departure. The lady, somewhat disconsolate, found nothing better to do than  to get into the bath which had been intended for the Marquis, sup and go to  bed: so into the bath she went. The bath was close to the postern on the  other side of which hapless Rinaldo had ensconced himself, and, thus the  mournful and quavering music which Rinaldo made as he shuddered in the cold,  and which seemed rather to proceed from a stork's beak than from the mouth  of a human being, was audible to the lady in the bath. She therefore called  her maid, and said to her:--\"Go up and look out over the wall and down at  the postern, and mark who is there, and what he is, and what he does there.\"  The maid obeyed, and, the night being fine, had no difficulty in making out  Rinaldo as he sate there, barefoot, as I have, said, and in his shirt, and  trembling in every limb. So she called out to him, to know who he was.  Rinaldo, who could scarcely articulate for shivering, told as briefly as he  could, who he was, and how and why he came to be there; which done, he began  piteously to, beseech her not, if she could avoid it, to leave him there all  night to perish of cold. The maid went back to her mistress full of pity for  Rinaldo, and told her all she had seen and heard. The lady felt no less pity  for Rinaldo; and bethinking her that she had the key of the postern by which  the Marquis sometimes entered when he paid her a secret visit, she said to  the maid:--\"Go, and let him in softly; here is this supper, and there will  be none to eat it; and we can very well put him up for the night.\" Cordially  commending her mistress's humanity, the maid went and let Rinaldo in, and  brought him to the lady, who, seeing that he was all but dead with cold,  said to him:--\"Quick, good man, get into that bath, which is still warm.\"  Gladly he did so, awaiting no second "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],[0,"The Domestic Cat (#19)"],[1," the covers that she is not a match for.  Polecats and weasels have to own her sway, while rabbits and leverets  fall an easy prey to her prowess.    Most cats, who are well treated by their owners, have a habit of  bringing everything home which they catch.  I have often seen a cat come  trotting homewards, carrying in its mouth a rabbit well-nigh as big as  herself.    Cats may therefore be called poachers; and it is curious, but true, that  when a poor man owns a cat who poaches, and brings home the quarry, he  usually winks at it.    I have dozens of well-authenticated anecdotes of cats who are very  expert at fishing.  I have, myself, watched a cat by the banks of a  stream, until I have seen him dive into the water, and emerge almost  immediately with a large trout in his mouth.  Cats who fish, generally  belong to millers, or are bred and reared somewhere near a river.  They  not only catch fish of all sorts, but even water-rats; often springing  many feet off the bank after prey of this kind, and even diving under to  secure it.  In Scotland cats often attack and destroy large quantities  of salmon in small streams, in the spawning season.    Cats are supposed to have an antipathy to water, and, as a rule, this is  so.  They are very cleanly animals, and it has often amused me to watch  a pussy crossing a muddy street.  How eagerly she looks out for the dry  spots, how gingerly she picks her steps, and, when she does tread in a  pool, with what an air of supreme disgust she stops and shakes the  offending foot!    Cats swim well, nevertheless.  I have seen a cat take the water as  coolly as an Irish spaniel, swim the river, hunt in the woods for some  time, and then swim back again with a bird in her mouth.  And, to save  their kittens from drowning, almost any cat will swim a long distance.    I have known a cat whose favourite fish was the eel, and he always  managed to catch one somehow.    Cats are very fanciful at times, and very self-opinionated.  If a cat  takes a fancy to a particular house, or part of the house, it is  difficult to dislodge her.    \"In the year 1852,\" a lady writes me, \"my mother was living with a  family in the Albany Road, Camberwell, who had a large tabby Tom cat.  This cat had formed a strong attachment to a kitten who belonged to the  lady next door.  In 1853, the family removed to the Ashby Road, Lower  Road, Islington, and the cat was _packed in a hamper_, and sent with the  furniture.    \"It was kept in confinement the first day and night, and let out the  next morning.  Tabby had his feet buttered, to keep him employed, as  they said it was a good thing to keep him busy.  The next day he had  disappeared, no one knew whither, though search was made for him  everywhere.    \"A few days after, the lady from Camberwell wrote to say that Tabby had  put in an appearance there, and resumed the charge of his kitten.  He  was sent back by the carrier to his proper owner, and every means was  tried to induce him to stop; but he returned the second time to the  kitten, and so they let him remain, because they knew he would be well  taken care of.  The wonderment of this was: _which bridge did he go over  in passing through busy London_?\"    It is really wonderful how a cat can often find its way, long distances  across a country which he never before may have traversed.    \"A few days ago,\" says another correspondent, \"a lady who lives in  Newport told me that, at one time, her house was quite overrun with  mice; and, having procured the loan of a cat which was considered a good  mouser, she tied it into a basket, and then placed it in a concealed  part of the pony carriage.  On her arrival at the `Cliff' the prisoner  was released; but even the prospect of a delicious feast of mice could  not obliterate its thoughts of `home, sweet home;' and, after about an  hour's stay, it set off, and, ere long, arrived at its former abode--  distant three miles!\"    Some months ago, a half-bred Persian tabby, came to my place, and has  since then stuck to it with all the persistency of Edgar Allan Poe's  raven.  He is a cat that seems to have nothing to recommend him; if he  would come into the house, and behave like a civilised being, I would  never grudge him his daily dole.  But he prefers to live a half-pagan  existence, out among the bushes, and take his nap of a night in the  coal-house; and Bridget says he is an awful thief, and that she can't  leave the kitchen-door open one moment for fear of him.  I've often  asked that cat to take his departure, but, as plain as cat can speak,  that cat says \"never more.\"    By way of experiment I have caught him several times--no easy task, I  assure you--and _sent him_, securely packed in a hamper, distances of  three, four, and five miles to friends who have set him free.  And he  always came back.  His last journey was at Christmas-time--may Heaven  forgive me this sin!--to the house of a parson _whom I did not know_,  and I stuck some pheasants' feathers too just under the lid.  I don't  know what the parson thought, but Tom came back next day, not looking a  single bit put out, and--I am willing to sell him to anyone who may have  need of his services.    I know a cat who caught two sparrows at once, and when retreating, a  third sparrow pursued and attacked him.  This one pussy also killed,  with his paw.  That was funny!    Cats know certain days of the week, such as Sunday for instance, and  they also know certain hours of each day.  I don't mean to say they look  at the clock, but, if a favourite master or mistress is in the habit of  coming home every day, say at 4 p.m., there you will often find that  every day at 4 p.m. pussy will trot down the road to meet her and wait  till she comes.    Cats make good husbands, gentle fathers, and the most tender and loving  of mothers.  A cat will fight for her kittens, starve or _steal_ for  them.  Oh!  I daresay you imagine that stealing wouldn't be likely to  lie very heavily on a cat's conscience.  Now listen to this--which the  printer will kindly put in italics--_all experience goes to prove that  well-fed, properly cared-for cats, are not thieves, but the reverse_.    Cats have their kittens in queer places, at times.  A lady's best Sunday  bonnet, or master's wig, or a set of ermine furs, just suits pussy to a  nicety.  My cat once kittened in my cocked hat.  It is a positive fact,  madam, and so far from thinking she had done anything to offend me, she  held up one of her brats for me to admire.  But the queerest place for a  cat to kitten in, that ever I knew, was a tree.  The cat scrambled up  the tree and brought forth her young in the nest of a wood-pigeon!  I  didn't hear how the kittens got down again though, but I have every  reason to believe the story.  Probably, when the kittens opened their  eyes they commenced playing with their mother's tail, and went  topsy-turvy to the ground.  Well, _facilis descensus Averni_, and you  know cats always fall on their feet.  I knew a man who kicked his own  cat out of his pigeon loft, three storeys high.  He told me it didn't  seem to hurt her a bit, but rather increased her appetite.    Whether cats have nine lives or not, they take a great deal of killing.    I knew a cat that was drowned four times, and came home again as  unconcernedly as if nothing very unusual had happened.  However,  drowning in the end seemed to get rather irksome to this pussy, and  after the fourth immersion, he ran away to the woods, and didn't come  back to be drowned any more.    Many cases I know of parties having started off with puss in a bag to  drown her, and having stopped to talk to a friend on the way back found,  on their return, the cat sitting by the fire drying herself!  I have  many instances of cats having been thrown from bridges and other high  places, with the intention of killing them, but without fatal effect.    Cats have been buried alive for days and recovered after being dug up.  A cat of my acquaintance was sent to live at a mill.  This seemed to  please pussy very much.  You see there were plenty of mice in the mill,  and plenty of rats and fish in the mill-lead, so the cat made herself at  home.  But in course of time pussy became the mother of two kittens, and  then the longing for her old home came back with a force too powerful to  be resisted.  She determined, therefore, to return to her former  residence, and she did so, carrying her kittens one by one.  The  distance she had to travel was two miles, and the night she chose was a  dark and stormy one.    There were two cats who dwelt at the self-same house and had kittens at  the self-same time.  All the kittens were drowned with the exception of  two, one being left with each mother.  And now comes the curious part of  the business.  These two mother-cats came to an amicable understanding,  that whenever the one was abroad the other should suckle and attend to  both babies, and this treaty was carried out to the letter.    Cats are not only fond of human beings, but often get greatly attached  to other domestic animals, especially to the family dog.  I know at this  moment a cat whose constant companion is a Dandy Dinmont; and a rough  one he is too, for, although he sleeps in pussy's arms every night, he  thinks nothing of pulling her all round the lawn by the tail at any  time, the cat herself seeming to enjoy the fun!    Rabbits and cats often associate together on the most friendly terms,  even accompanying each other in long excursions, the cat on these  occasions electing herself protector of her feebler friend against  predatory dogs and other cats.    A cat belonging to a friend of mine used to be constantly at war with  the dog, until one day, with a blow of her ungloved paw, she blinded the  poor animal in one eye.  No mother could have been kinder to her child  than pussy was to this dog, after she saw what she had done.  That she  bitterly repented the rash act is"]]]
