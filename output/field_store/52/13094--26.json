Thou wilt return at daybreak with two glasses too many and thou'lt not  fail to have some kind of an affair to take thy strength. No; thou canst  not go. When we get through thou mayest play.\"    And the work over, if there were a few days of liberty before the next  _corrida_ in some other city, the _cuadrilla_ would put off the trip,  and then the gay time would begin, far from the restraint of their  families, with abundance of wine and women in company with enthusiastic  devotees, who imagined this to be the everyday life of their idols.    The divers dates of the _fiestas_ obliged the swordsman to take absurd  journeys. He would leave one city to work in the other extreme of Spain,  and four days later he would return, fighting bulls in a town near the  first one. He almost spent the summer months, when _corridas_ were most  frequent, in the train, making a continual zigzag over all the railroads  of the Peninsula, killing bulls in the plazas, and sleeping on the  cars.    \"If all my summer travel were arranged in a straight line,\" said  Gallardo, \"it would sure reach to the North Pole.\"    At the beginning of the season he started on his travels with  enthusiasm, thinking of the multitude that talked of him throughout the  whole year, impatiently awaiting his coming; he thought of the  unforeseen events; of the adventures that feminine curiosity would  frequently yield him; of the life from hotel to hotel, with its changes,  its annoyances, its varied meals, that contrasted strongly with the  placid existence in Seville and the days of mountain solitude at La  Rinconada. But after a few weeks of this giddy life, in which he earned  five thousand pesetas for each afternoon of work, Gallardo began to  lament, like a child far from its family.    \"Ah! My cool house in Seville! Poor Carmen who keeps it shining like a  little silver cup! Ah! _Mamita's_ cooking! So rich!\"    He only forgot Seville on holiday nights, when he did not have to fight  bulls the following day; when all the _cuadrilla_, surrounded by  devotees anxious to give them a good impression of the city, gathered at  a _cafe flamenco_ where women and songs were all for the _maestro_.    When Gallardo went home to recuperate during the remainder of the year  he felt the satisfaction of the mighty who, forgetting honors, give  themselves up to the comforts of ordinary life.    He slept late, free from the tyranny of train schedules and unstirred by  any emotion when he thought of bulls. Nothing to do this day, nor the  next, nor the next! His travel ended at Sierpes Street, or the plaza of  San Fernando. The family seemed changed, happier and in better health,  having him safe at home for a few months. He went out with his hat on  the back of his head, twirling his gold-headed cane and admiring the big  brilliants on his fingers. In the vestibule some men were waiting for  him,--sun-browned men with a sour, sweaty, stench, wearing dirty blouses  and broad hats with ragged rims. Some were field laborers out on a  tramp, who thought it quite natural on passing through Seville to obtain  help from the famous _matador_ whom they called Senor Juan. Others lived  in the city, and _thou_-ed the bull-fighter, calling him Juaniyo.    Gallardo, with a memory for faces characteristic of a public man,  recognized them and permitted their familiarity. They were comrades of  his few school days or his youthful vagabondage.    \"Business not going well, eh? Times are hard for everybody.\"    And before this friendliness could encourage them to greater intimacy he  turned to Garabato who stood holding the gate open.    \"Tell the _senora_ to give thee a couple of _pesetas_ for each one.\"    Then he went out into the street whistling, pleased with his generosity  and the beauty of his life. He was detained on the next block by a  couple of old women, friends of his mother, who asked him to stand as  godfather to the grandchild of one of them. Her poor daughter was about  to become a mother at any moment; her son-in-law, an ardent Gallardist,  had come to blows several times going out of the plaza in defence of his  idol but dared not speak to him.    \"But, damn it! Do you take me for the director of an orphan asylum?  I've got more god-children than there are in the poor-house.\"    To rid himself of them he told them to see his _mamita_. Whatever she  said should stand! And he went on, not stopping until he reached Sierpes  Street, bowing to some and giving others the honor of walking at his  side in glorious intimacy before the gaze of the passersby.    He looked in at the Forty-five Club, to see if his manager were there.  This was an aristocratic society of a limited membership, as its title  indicated, in which the talk was only of bulls and horses. It was  composed of gentlemen-amateurs and cattle-breeders, the Marquis of  Moraima figuring preeminently, like an oracle.    On one of these walks, one afternoon, Gallardo found himself sauntering  along Sierpes Street, and took a notion to enter the parish chapel of  San Lorenzo. In the little square before it stood luxurious carriages.  On this day the best families were wont to pray to the miraculous image  of Our Lord Jesus of the Great Power. Ladies stepped out of the coaches,  dressed in black, with rich _mantillas_; and men went into the church  attracted by the feminine assemblage.    Gallardo entered also. A bull-fighter must take advantage of  opportunities to rub elbows with persons of high position. The son of  Senora Angustias felt the pride of a conqueror when rich gentlemen bowed  to him and elegant ladies murmured his name, turning their eyes upon  him. Moreover, he was a devotee of the Lord of the Great Power. He  tolerated in Nacional his opinions on \"God or Nature\" without being much  shocked, for the Divinity meant for him something vague and indefinite,  like the existence of a great lord about whom one might listen calmly  to all kinds of blasphemy, because he is only known by hearsay. But the  Virgin of Hope and Jesus of the Great Power he had been accustomed to  seeing since his earliest years, and these must not be maligned. The  susceptibilities of the lusty youth were touched by the theatrical agony  of the Christ with the cross on his back, the sweaty countenance,  painful and livid like that of comrades he had seen stretched out in the  infirmaries of the bull-plazas. He must be on good terms with this  powerful lord and he fervently uttered several _pater-nosters_, standing  before the image, with the candles like red stars reflected in the  corneas of his Moorish eyes.    A movement among the women kneeling before him distracted his attention,  which had been absorbed in a plea for supernatural intervention whenever  his life should be in danger.    A lady passed among the worshippers, attracting their notice; she was a  tall, slender woman, of astounding beauty, dressed in light colors and  wearing a great hat with plumes beneath which shone the luminous gold of  her abundant hair.    Gallardo knew her. It was Dona Sol, the Marquis of Moraima's niece, the  \"Ambassadress,\" as they called her in Seville. She passed among the  women paying no attention to their movements of curiosity, satisfied to  win their glances and to hear the murmur of their words as though this  were a natural homage that should follow her appearance in any public  place. The foreign elegance of her dress and her enormous hat were  outlined in their showy splendor against the dark mass of feminine  toilettes. She knelt, inclined her head as if in prayer for a few  moments, and then her light eyes of greenish blue, with their  reflections of gold, roved about the temple tranquilly as though she  were in a theatre examining the audience, searching for familiar faces.  Those eyes seemed to smile when they encountered the face of a friend  and persisted in their roving until they met Gallardo's, which were  fixed upon her. The _matador_ was not modest. Accustomed to being  himself the object of contemplation of thousands and thousands of  persons on bull-fight afternoons, he might well believe that, wherever  he was, the looks of all must of course be meant for him. Many women, in  hours of confidence, had revealed to him their emotion, the curiosity  and desire they felt on seeing him for the first time in the ring. Dona  Sol's gaze did not fall as it met the bull-fighter's; instead it  remained fixed, with the frigidity of a great lady, obliging the  _matador_, ever respectful to the rich, to turn his eyes away.    \"What a woman!\" thought Gallardo, with the petulance of a popular idol.  \"Can that _gachi_ be for me?\"    Outside of the church he felt a desire to wait, and he remained near the  door. His heart warned him of something extraordinary, as on afternoons  when good fortune was coming. It was that mysterious presentiment which  in the ring made him deaf to the protests of the public, throwing  himself headlong into the greatest dangers, and always with excellent  results. When she came out of the church she again looked at him  strangely, as if she had guessed that he would be waiting for her. She  stepped into an open carriage accompanied by two friends, and when the  coachman drove away she still turned her head to see the bull-fighter, a  faint smile on her lips.    Gallardo was distracted the remainder of the afternoon--thinking of his  former love affairs, of the triumphs of admiration and curiosity that  his bull-fighter's arrogance had won for him; conquests that filled him  with pride and made him think himself irresistible, but which now  inspired him with a kind of shame. A woman like that, a great lady, who  had travelled about the world and lived in Seville like an unthroned  queen! That would be a conquest! To his admiration of beauty was united  a certain reverence derived from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33830"],[0,"Fur Farming (#19)"],[1," bred in parks for pleasure  or in large preserves for sport, but the economic possibilities in  raising them have received little attention. Recently breeders have  recognized the fact that they are profitable under proper management and  would be much more so were conditions for marketing live animals and  venison more favorable.      _Experiences of Breeders._    The Biological Survey has reports of successful experience in raising  Virginia deer from more than a dozen persons, located in different parts  of the country, who are now engaged in the business. The management of  the herds varies slightly with the surroundings and the object for which  they are kept.    Thomas Blagden, of Washington, D. C., began raising deer in 1874. After  an experience of over a third of a century he is confident that the  business can be made profitable. In his own herds he has carefully  avoided in-breeding by securing new bucks from time to time. His stock  is vigorous and of the large size characteristic of the Adirondack and  other northern deer. Consequently the animals are in demand for breeding  purposes, the bucks bringing $50 each and the does, $75. He feeds grain,  using corn and a mixture of bran and meal, and during the summer cuts as  much wild forage as possible. He finds that the animals prefer the  rankest weeds to the choicest grass. Of the various kinds of hay, they  prefer alfalfa. He provides abundant water at all times.    John W. Griggs, of Goodell, Iowa, writes that he has been engaged in  raising deer for about fourteen years. Until two years ago he sold all  his surplus stock for parks, but since then has disposed of about half  of it for venison. For park purposes he gets $20 to $30 a head, but they  bring fully as much or more when fattened for venison. As to management  of deer, Mr. Griggs writes:    \"In raising a large herd the park should be divided into two or three  lots, and one plowed each year and sown to red clover, mustard, rape,  and seeds of different kinds of weeds. Bluegrass and timothy are  useless. Corn is the principal grain I feed. I feed it winter and  summer. In winter I feed also clover hay, oat straw, and weedy wild hay.  Deer when rightly handled are very prolific, and from 50 does one can  count on 75 fawns. They can be raised profitably for venison--very  profitably until overdone; but I would not advise one to go into it on a  large scale without previous experience with deer.\"    The report received from C. H. Roseberry, of Stella, Mo., although less  enthusiastic than others, is quoted because his herd approaches more  nearly a state of true domestication. Under date of January 13, 1908,  Mr. Roseberry wrote as follows:    \"My experience in breeding the common or Virginia deer covers a period  of seventeen years, beginning in March, 1891, when, as a boy of 16, I  built a small inclosure of 1-1/2 acres to confine a single doe that was  captured as a fawn in the neighboring forest.    \"A buck and other does were secured from year to year, until in 1900, by  purchase and natural increase, my herd numbered 25 head of all ages.    \"From 1891 to 1901 I lost every year from disease an average of 20 per  cent. The climax came in the drought year of 1901, when my loss was 50  per cent from the disease known as \"black tongue.\"    \"I am convinced that, like cholera in swine, individuals recovering from  this disease are immune from further attack. Apparently all of my herd  were afflicted. The survivors and their progeny constitute my present  breeding stock. I have made no purchases since 1901, nor have I suffered  any loss from disease.    \"For the last seven years my herd has averaged 70 per cent increase, all  of which I have sold at satisfactory prices. I began selling at $20 per  pair of fawns at 4 months of age and $30 per pair of adults. I now get  $40 and $60, respectively. I sell almost exclusively for pets and for  propagating purposes, although a few surplus bucks have been sold for  venison, averaging me 15 cents per pound gross weight.    \"If we except the goat, I know of no domestic animal common to the farm  that requires so little feed and attention as the deer. My herd has a  range of only 15 acres, two-thirds of which are set to white clover,  bluegrass, and orchard grass. I provide also a small plat of wheat or  rye for winter pasture. With the above provision, in this latitude, no  feed is required between April 15 and November 15. During the rest of  the year a ration of corn, bran, or other mill feed somewhat smaller  than that required for sheep, in connection with a stack of clover or  pea hay to which they have free access, is sufficient to keep them in  good condition. Deer eat with relish nearly all of the common coarse  weeds, and for clearing land of brush they are, I think, second only to  the common goat.    \"Probably the greatest expense connected with the business of raising  deer is the fencing. Another item of trouble and expense, when the  animals are raised for pets, requiring that they be handled and shipped  alive, is the fact that the fawns must be taken from the does when 10  days old and raised by hand on cow's milk. They are quite easily raised  in this way, with but slight percentage of loss, but require frequent  and careful attention for the first month. When they are allowed to run  with the does their natural wildness can not be overcome, no matter how  gentle the does may be.    \"I have found the business profitable on the lines indicated. I believe  they could be profitably bred for venison alone--certainly with less  trouble and expense, since the fawns could be reared by the does and the  trouble and expense of raising by hand would be eliminated.    \"My experience does not coincide with that of some other breeders in  respect to the weakening of reproductive powers of deer by the  confinement in parks. I have no barren does. Usually they produce a  single fawn at two years of age; afterwards twins, and in rare cases  triplets.\"      [Illustration: Tame Deer Eating Watermelon.]    _Management of Virginia Deer._    As to the management of deer little need be added to the statements from  practical breeders already given. Virginia deer are polygamous, like  cattle; the rutting season is in November; the period of gestation is  about seven months, and the fawns are born in May or June. Young does  usually breed when about 17 months old and have but one fawn the first  time; afterwards they commonly produce twins. The fawns are spotted  until the first shedding of the hair in the fall.    While deer are chiefly browsing animals, in captivity they eat nearly  every kind of vegetation, including most kinds of garden stuff. They are  fond of acorns, beechnuts, chestnuts, and other mast. Lily pads, leaves,  lichens, and mosses are freely eaten. With plenty of range and an  abundant variety of plants there need be, therefore, no apprehension  concerning the deer's food. A good supply of running water must be  provided, and the animals should have access to rock salt. If the browse  and pasturage are scant, a small ration of grain should be fed. Of the  grains, corn is generally recommended as a food; there is no waste, as  the deer pick up every grain. Coarse hay full of weeds is preferable to  timothy or other tame hays, except alfalfa. Of clover hay, deer usually  eat the blossom heads greedily, but waste the other parts. In winter  feeding is necessary everywhere, and in the northern half of the United  States shelter of some kind should be provided.    The remarks about castrating elk apply as well to the common deer. A  number of vigorous bucks, however, must be kept with any considerable  herd of does, for a single buck can not serve an unlimited number.  Frequent changes of blood by introducing new bucks should be practiced  to avoid in-breeding.      _Wild Deer in Private Game Preserves._    Individual owners, as well as associations, have established large  private preserves in many parts of the country and stocked them with  deer and other big game. The objects have been to preserve the animals  and to provide sport for the owners. In the free life under the  protected conditions generally provided, deer do remarkably well, the  increase being even more rapid than in small parks. There can be no  doubt of the success of ventures in propagating the Virginia deer under  natural conditions as wild game, as is proved by the experience of a  large number of hunting clubs and private owners.    Deer in Buckwood Park, a New Jersey preserve of 4,000 acres, belonging  to Charles S. Worthington, increased in the ten years between 1892 and  1903 from 19 to about 400 head, and the number was then lessened because  it was thought too large for the permanent sustaining capacity of the  park. The St. Louis Park and Agricultural Company have about 1,000 deer  and 400 elk in their 5,000-acre preserve in Taney County, Mo. The  Otzinachson Rod and Gun Club six years ago placed about 90 deer, mostly  does, in their 4,000 acre park in Clinton County, Pa. These have  multiplied to nearly 2,000 head, and a further increase of about a  thousand fawns is expected during the present season (1908). Doubtless  these experiences are not exceptional.    The good effect of such preserves on the supply of game in the State  should not be overlooked. While they may temporarily restrict the  hunting privileges of a few citizens, they ultimately become a source of  game supply secondary in importance only to State preserves or game  refuges. Already a number of private reserves have become overstocked,  and game has escaped or been turned over to the State to become the  property of the people. The success of private enterprise in propagating  large game in inclosures has thus become an object lesson for State game  commissioners and others, and suggests the feasibility of the State's  undertaking a similar work for the people.
