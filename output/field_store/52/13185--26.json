Out  of this wish and desire there was developed my third comfort,  namely, that she is not lost to us forever, that we shall see her  again, that we shall be together more joyous and happy than ever  we were in this world. It is only the time that is unknown, and  that fact does not frighten me. When it is God's will, it shall  be mine. Only the divine, the most sacred will be done; let us  then pray a devout 'Our Father' for her soul and proceed to other  matters; everything has its time.\"    (Paris, July 9, 1778, to his father, informing him of his  mother's death.)    251. \"Be without concern touching my soul's welfare, best of  fathers! I am an erring young man, like so many others, but I can  say to my own comfort, that I wish all were as little erring as  I. You, perhaps, believe things about me which are not true. My  chief fault is that I do not always appear to act as I ought. It  is not true that I boasted that I eat fish every fast-day; but I  did say that I was indifferent on the subject and did not  consider it a sin, for in my case fasting means breaking off,  eating less than usual. I hear mass every Sunday and holy day,  and when it is possible on week days also,--you know that, my  father.\"    (Vienna, June 13, 1781--another attempt at justification against  slander.)    252. \"Moreover take the assurance that I certainly am religious,  and if I should ever have the misfortune (which God will  forefend) to go astray, I shall acquit you, best of fathers, from  all blame. I alone would be the scoundrel; to you I owe all my  spiritual and temporal welfare and salvation.\"    (Vienna, June 13, 1781.)    253. \"For a considerable time before we were married we went  together to Holy Mass, to confession and to communion; and I  found that I never prayed so fervently, confessed and  communicated so devoutly, as when I was at her side;--and her  experience was the same. In a word we were made for each other,  and God, who ordains all things and consequently has ordained  this, will not desert us. We both thank you obediently for your  paternal blessing.\"    (Vienna, August 17, 1782.)    254. \"I have made it a habit in all things to imagine the worst.  Inasmuch as, strictly speaking, death is the real aim of our  life, I have for the past few years made myself acquainted with  this true, best friend of mankind, so that the vision not only  has no terror for me but much that is quieting and comforting.  And I thank my God that He gave me the happiness and the  opportunity (you understand me) to learn to know Him as the key  to true blessedness.\"    (Vienna, April 4, 1787, to his father, who died on the 28th of  the following month. One of the few passages in Mozart's letters  in which there are suggestions of the teachings of Freemasonry.  In 1785 he had persuaded his father to join the order, with the  result that new warmth was restored to the relationship which had  cooled somewhat after Mozart's marriage.)    255. \"To me that again is art twaddle! There may be something  true in it for you enlightened Protestants, as you call  yourselves, when you have your religion in your heads; I can not  tell. But you do not feel what 'Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata  mundi' and such things mean. But when one, like I, has been  initiated from earliest childhood in the mystical sanctuary of  our religion; when there one does not know whither to go with all  the vague but urgent feelings, but waits with a heart full of  devotion for the divine service without really knowing what to  expect, yet rises lightened and uplifted without knowing what one  has received; when one deemed those fortunate who knelt under the  touching strains of the Agnus Dei and received the sacrament, and  at the moment of reception the music spoke in gentle joy from the  hearts of the kneeling ones, 'Benedictus qui venit,' etc.;--then  it is a different matter. True, it is lost in the hurly-burly of  life; but,--at least it is so in my case,--when you take up the  words which you have heard a thousand times, for the purpose of  setting them to music, everything comes back and you feel your  soul moved again.\"    (Spoken in Leipsic, in 1789, when somebody expressed pity for  those capable musicians who were obliged to \"employ their powers  on ecclesiastical subjects, which were mostly not only unfruitful  but intellectually killing.\" Rochlitz reports the utterance but  does not vouch for its literalness.)"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4060"],[0,"The Renaissance: studies in art and poetry (#19)"],[1,"ontinually,  he is the most profane of painters; the given person or subject,  Saint John in the Desert, or the Virgin on the knees of Saint  Anne, is often merely the pretext for a kind of work which carries  one altogether beyond the range of its conventional associations.    About the Last Supper, its decay and restorations, a whole  literature has risen up, Goethe's pensive sketch of its sad fortunes  being perhaps the best.  The death in childbirth of the Duchess  Beatrice was followed in Ludovico by one of those paroxysms of  religious feeling which in him were constitutional.  The low,  gloomy Dominican church of Saint Mary of the Graces had been  the favourite oratory of Beatrice.  She had spent her last days  there, full of sinister presentiments; at last it had been almost  necessary to remove her from it by force; and now it was here  that mass was said a hundred times a day for her repose.  On the  damp wall of the refectory, oozing with mineral salts, Leonardo  painted the Last Supper.  Effective anecdotes were told about it,  his retouchings and delays.  They show him refusing to work  except at the moment of invention, scornful of any one who  supposed that art could be a work of mere industry and rule,  [120] often coming the whole length of Milan to give a single  touch.  He painted it, not in fresco, where all must be impromptu,  but in oils, the new method which he had been one of the first to  welcome, because it allowed of so many after-thoughts, so  refined a working out of perfection.  It turned out that on a  plastered wall no process could have been less durable.  Within  fifty years it had fallen into decay.  And now we have to turn  back to Leonardo's own studies, above all to one drawing of the  central head at the Brera, which, in a union of tenderness and  severity in the face-lines, reminds one of the monumental work  of Mino da Fiesole, to trace it as it was.    Here was another effort to lift a given subject out of the range of  its traditional associations.  Strange, after all the mystic  developments of the middle age, was the effort to see the  Eucharist, not as the pale Host of the altar, but as one taking  leave of his friends.  Five years afterwards the young Raphael, at  Florence, painted it with sweet and solemn effect in the refectory  of Saint Onofrio; but still with all the mystical unreality of the  school of Perugino.  Vasari pretends that the central head was  never finished.  But finished or unfinished, or owing part of its  effect to a mellowing decay, the head of Jesus does but  consummate the sentiment of the whole company--ghosts  through which you see the wall, faint as the shadows of the [121]  leaves upon the wall on autumn afternoons.  This figure is but the  faintest, the most spectral of them all.    The Last Supper was finished in 1497; in 1498 the French  entered Milan, and whether or not the Gascon bowmen used it as  a mark for their arrows, the model of Francesco Sforza certainly  did not survive.  What, in that age, such work was capable of  being--of what nobility, amid what racy truthfulness to fact--we  may judge from the bronze statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni on  horseback, modelled by Leonardo's master, Verrocchio (he died  of grief, it was said, because, the mould accidentally failing, he  was unable to complete it), still standing in the piazza of Saint  John and Saint Paul at Venice.  Some traces of the thing may  remain in certain of Leonardo's drawings, and perhaps also, by a  singular circumstance, in a far-off town of France.  For Ludovico  became a prisoner, and ended his days at Loches in Touraine.  After many years of captivity in the dungeons below, where all  seems sick with barbarous feudal memories, he was allowed at  last, it is said, to breathe fresher air for awhile in one of the rooms  of the great tower still shown, its walls covered with strange  painted arabesques, ascribed by tradition to his hand, amused a  little, in this way, through the tedious years.  In those vast  helmets and human faces and pieces of armour, among which, in  great letters, the [122] motto Infelix Sum is woven in and out, it is  perhaps not too fanciful to see the fruit of a wistful after-  dreaming over Leonardo's sundry experiments on the armed  figure of the great duke, which had occupied the two so much  during the days of their good fortune at Milan.    The remaining years of Leonardo's life are more or less years of  wandering.  From his brilliant life at court he had saved nothing,  and he returned to Florence a poor man.  Perhaps necessity kept  his spirit excited: the next four years are one prolonged rapture or  ecstasy of invention.  He painted now the pictures of the Louvre,  his most authentic works, which came there straight from the  cabinet of Francis the First, at Fontainebleau.  One picture of his,  the Saint Anne--not the Saint Anne of the Louvre, but a simple  cartoon, now in London--revived for a moment a sort of  appreciation more common in an earlier time, when good pictures  had still seemed miraculous.  For two days a crowd of people of  all qualities passed in naïve excitement through the chamber  where it hung, and gave Leonardo a taste of the \"triumph\" of  Cimabue.  But his work was less with the saints than with the  living women of Florence.  For he lived still in the polished  society that he loved, and in the houses of Florence, left perhaps a  little subject to light thoughts by the death of Savonarola--the  latest gossip (1869) is of an [123] undraped Monna Lisa, found in  some out-of-the-way corner of the late Orleans collection--he  saw Ginevra di Benci, and Lisa, the young third wife of  Francesco del Giocondo.  As we have seen him using incidents of  sacred story, not for their own sake, or as mere subjects for  pictorial realisation, but as a cryptic language for fancies all his  own, so now he found a vent for his thought in taking one of  these languid women, and raising her, as Leda or Pomona, as  Modesty or Vanity, to the seventh heaven of symbolical  expression.    La Gioconda is, in the truest sense, Leonardo's masterpiece, the  revealing instance of his mode of thought and work.  In  suggestiveness, only the Melancholia of Dürer is comparable to  it; and no crude symbolism disturbs the effect of its subdued and  graceful mystery.  We all know the face and hands of the figure,  set in its marble chair, in that circle of fantastic rocks, as in some  faint light under sea.  Perhaps of all ancient pictures time has  chilled it least.*  As often happens with works in which invention  seems to reach its limit, there is an element in it given to, not  invented by, the master.  In that inestimable folio of drawings,  once in the possession of Vasari, were certain designs by  Verrocchio, faces of such impressive beauty that Leonardo in his  boyhood copied them [124] many times.  It is hard not to connect  with these designs of the elder, by-past master, as with its  germinal principle, the unfathomable smile, always with a touch  of something sinister in it, which plays over all Leonardo's work.  Besides, the picture is a portrait.  From childhood we see this  image defining itself on the fabric of his dreams; and but for  express historical testimony, we might fancy that this was but his  ideal lady, embodied and beheld at last.  What was the  relationship of a living Florentine to this creature of his thought?  By what strange affinities had the dream and the person grown up  thus apart, and yet so closely together?  Present from the first  incorporeally in Leonardo's brain, dimly traced in the designs of  Verrocchio, she is found present at last in Il Giocondo's house.  That there is much of mere portraiture in the picture is attested by  the legend that by artificial means, the presence of mimes and  flute-players, that subtle expression was protracted on the face.  Again, was it in four years and by renewed labour never really  completed, or in four months and as by stroke of magic, that the  image was projected?    The presence that rose thus so strangely beside the waters, is  expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years men had come  to desire.  Hers is the head upon which all \"the ends of the world  are come,\" and the eyelids are a little [125] weary.  It is a beauty  wrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by  cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite  passions.  Set it for a moment beside one of those white Greek  goddesses or beautiful women of antiquity, and how would they  be troubled by this beauty, into which the soul with all its  maladies has passed!  All the thoughts and experience of the  world have etched and moulded there, in that which they have of  power to refine and make expressive the outward form, the  animalism of Greece, the lust of Rome, the mysticism of the  middle age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves, the  return of the Pagan world, the sins of the Borgias.  She is older  than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has  been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and  has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about  her; and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants;  and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint  Anne, the mother of Mary; and all this has been to her but as the  sound of lyres and flutes, and lives only in the delicacy with  which it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the  eyelids and the hands.  The fancy of a perpetual life, sweeping  together ten thousand experiences, is an old one; and modern  philosophy has conceived the idea of humanity as wrought upon  by, and summing up in itself, all modes of thought and life.  Certainly [126] Lady Lisa might stand as the embodiment of the  old fancy, the symbol of the modern idea.    During these years at Florence Leonardo's history is the history  of his art; for"]]]
