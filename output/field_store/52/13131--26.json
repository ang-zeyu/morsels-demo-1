In magic, indeed, the assumption is only  implicit, but in science it is explicit. It is true that magic often  deals with spirits, which are personal agents of the kind assumed by  religion; but whenever it does so in its proper form, it treats them  exactly in the same fashion as it treats inanimate agents, that is,  it constrains or coerces instead of conciliating or propitiating  them as religion would do. Thus it assumes that all personal beings,  whether human or divine, are in the last resort subject to those  impersonal forces which control all things, but which nevertheless  can be turned to account by any one who knows how to manipulate them  by the appropriate ceremonies and spells. In ancient Egypt, for  example, the magicians claimed the power of compelling even the  highest gods to do their bidding, and actually threatened them with  destruction in case of disobedience. Sometimes, without going quite  so far as that, the wizard declared that he would scatter the bones  of Osiris or reveal his sacred legend, if the god proved  contumacious. Similarly in India at the present day the great Hindoo  trinity itself of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva is subject to the  sorcerers, who, by means of their spells, exercise such an  ascendency over the mightiest deities, that these are bound  submissively to execute on earth below, or in heaven above, whatever  commands their masters the magicians may please to issue. There is a  saying everywhere current in India: \"The whole universe is subject  to the gods; the gods are subject to the spells (_mantras_); the  spells to the Brahmans; therefore the Brahmans are our gods.\"    This radical conflict of principle between magic and religion  sufficiently explains the relentless hostility with which in history  the priest has often pursued the magician. The haughty  self-sufficiency of the magician, his arrogant demeanour towards the  higher powers, and his unabashed claim to exercise a sway like  theirs could not but revolt the priest, to whom, with his awful  sense of the divine majesty, and his humble prostration in presence  of it, such claims and such a demeanour must have appeared an  impious and blasphemous usurpation of prerogatives that belong to  God alone. And sometimes, we may suspect, lower motives concurred to  whet the edge of the priest's hostility. He professed to be the  proper medium, the true intercessor between God and man, and no  doubt his interests as well as his feelings were often injured by a  rival practitioner, who preached a surer and smoother road to  fortune than the rugged and slippery path of divine favour.    Yet this antagonism, familiar as it is to us, seems to have made its  appearance comparatively late in the history of religion. At an  earlier stage the functions of priest and sorcerer were often  combined or, to speak perhaps more correctly, were not yet  differentiated from each other. To serve his purpose man wooed the  good-will of gods or spirits by prayer and sacrifice, while at the  same time he had recourse to ceremonies and forms of words which he  hoped would of themselves bring about the desired result without the  help of god or devil. In short, he performed religious and magical  rites simultaneously; he uttered prayers and incantations almost in  the same breath, knowing or recking little of the theoretical  inconsistency of his behaviour, so long as by hook or crook he  contrived to get what he wanted. Instances of this fusion or  confusion of magic with religion have already met us in the  practices of Melanesians and of other peoples.    The same confusion of magic and religion has survived among peoples  that have risen to higher levels of culture. It was rife in ancient  India and ancient Egypt; it is by no means extinct among European  peasantry at the present day. With regard to ancient India we are  told by an eminent Sanscrit scholar that \"the sacrificial ritual at  the earliest period of which we have detailed information is  pervaded with practices that breathe the spirit of the most  primitive magic.\" Speaking of the importance of magic in the East,  and especially in Egypt, Professor Maspero remarks that \"we ought  not to attach to the word magic the degrading idea which it almost  inevitably calls up in the mind of a modern. Ancient magic was the  very foundation of religion. The faithful who desired to obtain some  favour from a god had no chance of succeeding except by laying hands  on the deity, and this arrest could only be effected by means of a  certain number of rites, sacrifices, prayers, and chants, which the  god himself had revealed, and which obliged him to do what was  demanded of him.\"    Among the ignorant classes of modern Europe the same confusion of  ideas, the same mixture of religion and magic, crops up in various  forms. Thus we are told that in France \"the majority of the peasants  still believe that the priest possesses a secret and irresistible  power over the elements. By reciting certain prayers which he alone  knows and has the right to utter, yet for the utterance of which he  must afterwards demand absolution, he can, on an occasion of  pressing danger, arrest or reverse for a moment the action of the  eternal laws of the physical world. The winds, the storms, the hail,  and the rain are at his command and obey his will. The fire also is  subject to him, and the flames of a conflagration are extinguished  at his word.\" For example, French peasants used to be, perhaps are  still, persuaded that the priests could celebrate, with certain  special rites, a Mass of the Holy Spirit, of which the efficacy was  so miraculous that it never met with any opposition from the divine  will; God was forced to grant whatever was asked of Him in this  form, however rash and importunate might be the petition. No idea of  impiety or irreverence attached to the rite in the minds of those  who, in some of the great extremities of life, sought by this  singular means to take the kingdom of heaven by storm. The secular  priests generally refused to say the Mass of the Holy Spirit; but  the monks, especially the Capuchin friars, had the reputation of  yielding with less scruple to the entreaties of the anxious and  distressed. In the constraint thus supposed by Catholic peasantry to  be laid by the priest upon the deity we seem to have an exact  counterpart of the power which the ancient Egyptians ascribed to  their magicians. Again, to take another example, in many villages of  Provence the priest is still reputed to possess the faculty of  averting storms. It is not every priest who enjoys this reputation;  and in some villages, when a change of pastors takes place, the  parishioners are eager to learn whether the new incumbent has the  power (_pouder_), as they call it. At the first sign of a heavy  storm they put him to the proof by inviting him to exorcise the  threatening clouds; and if the result answers to their hopes, the  new shepherd is assured of the sympathy and respect of his flock. In  some parishes, where the reputation of the curate in this respect  stood higher than that of his rector, the relations between the two  have been so strained in consequence that the bishop has had to  translate the rector to another benefice. Again, Gascon peasants  believe that to revenge themselves on their enemies bad men will  sometimes induce a priest to say a mass called the Mass of Saint  Sécaire. Very few priests know this mass, and three-fourths of those  who do know it would not say it for love or money. None but wicked  priests dare to perform the gruesome ceremony, and you may be quite  sure that they will have a very heavy account to render for it at  the last day. No curate or bishop, not even the archbishop of Auch,  can pardon them; that right belongs to the pope of Rome alone. The  Mass of Saint Sécaire may be said only in a ruined or deserted  church, where owls mope and hoot, where bats flit in the gloaming,  where gypsies lodge of nights, and where toads squat under the  desecrated altar. Thither the bad priest comes by night with his  light o' love, and at the first stroke of eleven he begins to mumble  the mass backwards, and ends just as the clocks are knelling the  midnight hour. His leman acts as clerk. The host he blesses is black  and has three points; he consecrates no wine, but instead he drinks  the water of a well into which the body of an unbaptized infant has  been flung. He makes the sign of the cross, but it is on the ground  and with his left foot. And many other things he does which no good  Christian could look upon without being struck blind and deaf and  dumb for the rest of his life. But the man for whom the mass is said  withers away little by little, and nobody can say what is the matter  with him; even the doctors can make nothing of it. They do not know  that he is slowly dying of the Mass of Saint Sécaire.    Yet though magic is thus found to fuse and amalgamate with religion  in many ages and in many lands, there are some grounds for thinking  that this fusion is not primitive, and that there was a time when  man trusted to magic alone for the satisfaction of such wants as  transcended his immediate animal cravings. In the first place a  consideration of the fundamental notions of magic and religion may  incline us to surmise that magic is older than religion in the  history of humanity. We have seen that on the one hand magic is  nothing but a mistaken application of the very simplest and most  elementary processes of the mind, namely the association of ideas by  virtue of resemblance or contiguity; and that on the other hand  religion assumes the operation of conscious or personal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36299"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#19)"],[1,"and  consisted of the Conquerer's wife and sons, earls, barons, knights,  officers of the King's household, archbishops, and bishops. It replaced  the witan of wise men. It dealt with fundamental matters of law, state,  war, and church. Earldoms and knighthoods were conferred and homages to  the king were witnessed. Bishops were nominated. Attendance at the  council, like attendance at courts, was regarded as a burden rather than  a privilege. The Conquerer's will was the motive force which under lay  all the council's action. When it was administering royal justice, it  was called the Royal Court.         The Justiciar was the head of all legal matters and he or the  Conquerer's wife represented the King at the Royal Court in his absence  from the realm. The chamberlain was a financial officer of the  household; his work was rather that of auditor or accountant. The  Chancellor headed the Chancery and the chapel. Other household offices  were steward, butler, constable, and marshall. The Treasurer was  responsible for the collection and distribution of revenue and was the  keeper of the royal treasure at the palace at Winchester. He was also an  important member of the household and sat in the Exchequer at  Westminster, where he received the accounts of the sheriffs. The  Exchequer was composed of the justiciar as head, the chancellor, the  constable, two chamberlains, the marshall and other experienced  councilors. The word \"Exchequer\" came from the chequered cloth on the  table used to calculate in Roman numerals the amount due and the amount  paid. The word \"calculate\" derives from the word \"calculi\", meaning  pebbles. It was a kind of abacus. The Exchequer received yearly from the  sheriffs of the counties taxes, fines, treasure trove, goods from  wrecks, deodands, and movable property of felons, of persons executed,  of fugitives, and of outlaws due to the Crown. The Conqueror presided  yearly over feasts involving several thousand guests at Westminster  Hall, which was 250 feet by 70 feet with a high ceiling, the largest  hall in England.         The Conquerer's reign was a time of tentative expedients and simple  solutions. He administered by issuing writs with commands or  prohibitions. These were read aloud by the sheriffs in the county courts  and other locations. Administration was by the personal servants of his  royal household, such as the chancellor, chamberlain, constable,  marshals, steward, and butler. The language of government changed to  Latin. The chancellor was from the clergy and supervised the writers and  clerks, who were literate, and appended the great seal before witnesses  to documents. He also headed the staff of the royal chapel. The  chamberlain was a financial officer who audited and accounted. The  constable was responsible for supplies for the knights of the royal  household. He also supervised the care of horses, hounds, hawks, and  huntsmen, houndsmen, and foresters. The marshals came from less  important families than the constable and they preserved order in the  king's hall and recorded expenditures of the household officers on  tallies. The steward was a great baron whose duties were chiefly  ceremonial, such as placing the dishes before the king at banquets.         Sheriffs became powerful figures as the primary agents for enforcing  royal edicts. There was no longer supervision of them by earls nor  influence on them by bishops. They were customarily prominent barons.  They collected the royal taxes, executed royal justice, and presided  over and controlled the hundred and county courts. They were responsible  for remitting a certain sum annually. If a sheriff received more than  necessary, he retained the difference as his lawful profit of office. If  he received less than necessary, he had to make up the difference from  his own pocket. Before rendering this account, he paid the royal  benefactions to religious houses, provided for the maintenance of stock  on crown lands, paid for the costs of provisions supplied to the court,  and paid for traveling expenses of the king and his visitors. The  payments were initially paid in kind: e.g. grain, cattle, horses,  hounds, and hawks. Sheriffs also took part in the keeping of castles and  often managed the estates of the King. Most royal writs were addressed  to the sheriff and county courts. They also led the county militia in  time of war or rebellion. At times, a sheriff usurped royal rights, used  royal estates for his own purposes, encroached on private land and  rights, extorted money, and collected revenues only for his own pockets.  Over the centuries, there was much competition for the authority to  select the sheriff, e.g. by the king, the county court, the barons, and  the Exchequer. There was also much pressure to limit his term to one  year. Over time, the powers of the sheriffs slowly declined.         Royal income came from customary dues, profits of coinage and of  justice, and revenues from the King's own estates. For war, there was no  change in the custom that a man with five hides of land was required to  furnish one heavy armed horseman for forty days service in a year. The  fyrd was retained. A threat of a Viking invasion caused the Conquerer to  reinstate the danegeld tax at 6s. per hide, which was three times its  old rate. (The price of an ox was still about 30d.) To impose this tax  uniformly, he sent commissioners to conduct surveys by sworn verdicts of  appointed groups of local men. A detailed survey of land holdings and  the productive worth of each was made in 1086. The English called it the  \"Doomsday Book\" because there was no appeal from it.         The survey revealed, for instance, that one estate had \"on the home  farm five plough teams: there are also 25 villeins and 6 cotters with 14  teams among them. There is a mill worth 2s. a year and one fishery, a  church and four acres of meadow, wood for 150 pigs and two stone  quarries, each worth 2s. a year, and two nests of hawks in the wood and  10 slaves.\" This estate was deemed to be worth 480s. a year.         Laxton \"had 2 carucates of land [assessed] to the geld. [There is] land  for 6 ploughs. There Walter, a man of [the lord] Geoffrey Alselin's has  1 plough and 22 villeins and 7 bordars [a bordar had a cottage and a  small amount land in return for supplying small provisions to his lord]  having 5 ploughs and 5 serfs and 1 female serf and 40 acres of meadow.  Wood [land] for pannage [foraging by pigs] 1 league in length and half a  league in breadth. In King Edward's time it was worth 9 pounds; now [it  is worth] 6 pounds.\"         Ilbert de Laci has now this land, where he has twelve ploughs in the  demesne; and forty-eight villani, and twelve bordars with fifteen  ploughs, and three churches and three priests, and three mills of ten  shillings. Wood pastures two miles long, and one broad. The whole manor  five miles long and two broad. Value in King Edward's time sixteen  pounds, the same now.         That manor of the town of Coventry which was individually held was that  of the Countess of Coventry, who was the wife of the earl of Mercia.  \"The Countess held in Coventry. There are 5 hides. The arable land  employs 20 ploughs. In the demesne lands there are 3 ploughs and 7  bondmen. There are 50 villeins and 12 bordars with 20 ploughs. The mill  there pay[s] 3 shillings. The woodlands are 2 miles long and the same  broad. In King Edward's time and afterwards, it was worth 22 pounds [440  s.], now only 11 pounds by weight. These lands of the Countess Godiva  Nicholas holds to farm of the King.\"         The survey shows a few manors and monasteries owned a salthouse or  saltpit in the local saltworks, from which they were entitled to obtain  salt.         In total there were about 110,000 villani [former coerls regarded as  customary, irremovable cultivator tenants]; 82,000 bordarii; 7,000  cotarii and cotseti [held land by service of labor or rent paid in  produce], and 25,000 servi [landless laborers]. There are no more  theows. This survey resulted in the first national tax system of about  6s. per hide of land.         The survey also provided the Conquerer with a summary of customs of  areas. For instance, in Oxfordshire, \"Anyone breaking the King's peace  given under his hand and seal to the extent of committing homicide shall  be at the King's mercy in respect of his life and members. That is if he  be captured. And if he cannot be captured, he shall be considered as an  outlaw, and anyone who kills him shall have all his possessions. The  king shall take the possessions of any stranger who has elected to live  in Oxford and who dies in possession of a house in that town, and  without any kinfolk. The king shall be entitled to the body and the  possessions of any man who kills another within his own court or house  excepting always the dower of his wife, if he has a wife who has  received dower.         The courts of the king and barons became schools of chivalry wherein  seven year old noble boys became pages or valets, wore a dagger and  waited upon the ladies of the household. At age fourteen, they were  advanced to squires and admitted into more familiar association with the  knights and ladies of the court. They perfected their skills in dancing,  riding, fencing, hawking, hunting, jousting, and engaged in team sports  in which the goal was to put the other side to rout. They learned the  knightly art of war. Enemy fighters were to be taken and held for ransom  rather than killed. Those engaging in rebellion were to be pardoned and  restored to some or all of their lands and titles. Lords' sons could be  mutually exchanged with an enemy's as security for peace. After  achieving knighthood, a man usually selected a wife from the court at  which he grew up. Parents tried to send their daughters to a household  superior in social status not only to learn manners, but to make a good  marriage. A girl who did"]]]
