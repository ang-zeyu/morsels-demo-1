For the first time in  her life Lygia saw those magnificent gardens, full of pines, cypresses,  oaks, olives, and myrtles, among which appeared white here and there a  whole population of statues. The mirror of ponds gleamed quietly; groves  of roses were blooming, watered with the spray of fountains; entrances  to charming grottos were encircled with a growth of ivy or woodbine;  silver-colored swans were sailing on the water; amidst statues and trees  wandered tame gazelles from the deserts of Africa, and rich-colored  birds from all known countries on earth.    The gardens were empty; but here and there slaves were working, spade in  hand, singing in an undertone; others, to whom was granted a moment  of rest, were sitting by ponds or in the shade of groves, in trembling  light produced by sun-rays breaking in between leaves; others were  watering roses or the pale lily-colored blossoms of the saffron. Acte  and Lygia walked rather long, looking at all the wonders of the gardens;  and though Lygia's mind was not at rest, she was too much a child yet to  resist pleasure, curiosity, and wonder. It occurred to her, even, that  if Caesar were good, he might be very happy in such a palace, in such  gardens.    But at last, tired somewhat, the two women sat down on a bench hidden  almost entirely by dense cypresses and began to talk of that which  weighed on their hearts most,--that is, of Lygia's escape in the  evening. Acte was far less at rest than Lygia touching its success. At  times it seemed to her even a mad project, which could not succeed.  She felt a growing pity for Lygia. It seemed to her that it would be  a hundred times safer to try to act on Vinicius. After a while she  inquired of Lygia how long she had known him, and whether she did not  think that he would let himself be persuaded to return her to Pomponia.    But Lygia shook her dark head in sadness. \"No. In Aulus's house,  Vinicius had been different, he had been very kind, but since  yesterday's feast she feared him, and would rather flee to the Lygians.\"    \"But in Aulus's house,\" inquired Acte, \"he was dear to thee, was he  not?\"    \"He was,\" answered Lygia, inclining her head.    \"And thou wert not a slave, as I was,\" said Acte, after a moment's  thought. \"Vinicius might marry thee. Thou art a hostage, and a daughter  of the Lygian king. Aulus and Pomponia love thee as their own child; I  am sure that they are ready to adopt thee. Vinicius might marry thee,  Lygia.\"    But Lygia answered calmly, and with still greater sadness, \"I would  rather flee to the Lygians.\"    \"Lygia, dost thou wish me to go directly to Vinicius, rouse him, if he  is sleeping, and tell him what I have told thee? Yes, my precious one, I  will go to him and say, 'Vinicius, this is a king's daughter, and a dear  child of the famous Aulus; if thou love her, return her to Aulus and  Pomponia, and take her as wife from their house.'\"    But the maiden answered with a voice so low that Acte could barely hear  it,--    \"I would rather flee to the Lygians.\" And two tears were hanging on her  drooping lids.    Further conversation was stopped by the rustle of approaching steps, and  before Acte had time to see who was coming, Poppaea Sabina appeared in  front of the bench with a small retinue of slave women. Two of them held  over her head bunches of ostrich feathers fixed to golden wires; with  these they fanned her lightly, and at the same time protected her from  the autumn sun, which was hot yet. Before her a woman from Egypt, black  as ebony, and with bosom swollen as if from milk, bore in her arms  an infant wrapped in purple fringed with gold. Acte and Lygia rose,  thinking that Poppaea would pass the bench without turning attention to  either; but she halted before them and said,--\"Acte, the bells sent by  thee for the doll were badly fastened; the child tore off one and put it  to her mouth; luckily Lilith saw it in season.\"    \"Pardon, divinity,\" answered Acte, crossing her arms on her breast and  bending her head.    But Poppaea began to gaze at Lygia.    \"What slave is this?\" asked she, after a pause.    \"She is not a slave, divine Augusta, but a foster child of Pomponia  Graecina, and a daughter of the Lygian king given by him as hostage to  Rome.\"    \"And has she come to visit thee?\"    \"No, Augusta. She is dwelling in the palace since the day before  yesterday.\"    \"Was she at the feast last night?\"    \"She was, Augusta.\"    \"At whose command?\"    \"At Caesar's command.\"    Poppaea looked still more attentively at Lygia, who stood with bowed  head, now raising her bright eyes to her with curiosity, now covering  them with their lids. Suddenly a frown appeared between the brows of  the Augusta. Jealous of her own beauty and power, she lived in continual  alarm lest at some time a fortunate rival might ruin her, as she had  ruined Octavia. Hence every beautiful face in the palace roused her  suspicion. With the eye of a critic she took in at once every part of  Lygia's form, estimated every detail of her face, and was frightened.  \"That is simply a nymph,\" thought she, \"and 'twas Venus who gave birth  to her.\" On a sudden this came to her mind which had never come before  at sight of any beauty,--that she herself had grown notably older!  Wounded vanity quivered in Poppaea, alarm seized her, and various fears  shot through her head. \"Perhaps Nero has not seen the girl, or, seeing  her through the emerald, has not appreciated her. But what would happen  should he meet such a marvel in the daytime, in sunlight? Moreover she  is not a slave, she is the daughter of a king,--a king of barbarians,  it is true, but a king. Immortal gods! she is as beautiful as I am, but  younger!\" The wrinkle between her brows increased, and her eyes began to  shine under their golden lashes with a cold gleam.    \"Hast thou spoken with Caesar?\"    \"No, Augusta.\"    \"Why dost thou choose to be here rather than in the house of Aulus?\"    \"I do not choose, lady. Petronius persuaded Caesar to take me from  Pomponia. I am here against my will.\"    \"And wouldst thou return to Pomponia?\"    This last question Poppaea gave with a softer and milder voice; hence a  sudden hope rose in Lygia's heart.    \"Lady,\" said she, extending her hand to her, \"Caesar promised to give  me as a slave to Vinicius, but do thou intercede and return me to  Pomponia.\"    \"Then Petronius persuaded Caesar to take thee from Aulus, and give thee  to Vinicius?\"    \"True, lady. Vinicius is to send for me to-day, but thou art good, have  compassion on me.\" When she had said this, she inclined, and, seizing  the border of Poppaea's robe, waited for her word with beating heart.  Poppaea looked at her for a while, with a face lighted by an evil smile,  and said,--\"Then I promise that thou wilt become the slave of Vinicius  this day.\" And she went on, beautiful as a vision, but evil. To the ears  of Lygia and Acte came only the wail of the infant, which began to cry,  it was unknown for what reason.    Lygia's eyes too were filled with tears; but after a while she took  Acte's hand and said,--\"Let us return. Help is to be looked for only  whence it can come.\" And they returned to the atrium, which they did not  leave till evening.    When darkness had come and slaves brought in tapers with great flames,  both women were very pale. Their conversation failed every moment. Both  were listening to hear if some one were coming. Lygia repeated again and  again that, though grieved to leave Acte, she preferred that all should  take place that day, as Ursus must be waiting in the dark for her then.  But her breathing grew quicker from emotion, and louder. Acte collected  feverishly such jewels as she could, and, fastening them in a corner  of Lygia's peplus, implored her not to reject that gift and means of  escape. At moments came a deep silence full of deceptions for the ear.  It seemed to both that they heard at one time a whisper beyond the  curtain, at another the distant weeping of a child, at another the  barking of dogs.    Suddenly the curtain of the entrance moved without noise, and a tall,  dark man, his face marked with small-pox, appeared like a spirit in the  atrium. In one moment Lygia recognized Atacinus, a freedman of Vinicius,  who had visited the house of Aulus.    Acte screamed; but Atacinus bent low and said,--\"A greeting, divine  Lygia, from Marcus Vinicius, who awaits thee with a feast in his house  which is decked in green.\"    The lips of the maiden grew pale.    \"I go,\" said she.    Then she threw her arms around Acte's neck in farewell.          Chapter X      THE house of Vinicius was indeed decked in the green of myrtle and ivy,  which had been hung on the walls and over the doors. The columns were  wreathed with grape vine. In the atrium, which was closed above by a  purple woollen cloth as protection from the night cold, it was as clear  as in daylight. Eight and twelve flamed lamps were burning; these were  like vessels, trees, animals, birds, or statues, holding cups filled  with perfumed olive oil, lamps of alabaster, marble, or gilded  Corinthian bronze, not so wonderful as that famed candlestick used by  Nero and taken from the temple of Apollo, but beautiful and made by  famous masters. Some of the lights were shaded by Alexandrian glass,  or transparent stuffs from the Indus, of red, blue, yellow, or violet  color, so that the whole atrium was filled with many colored rays.  Everywhere was given out the odor of nard, to which Vinicius had grown"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],[0,"The Astronomy of the Bible (#19)"],[1,"in the heavens, eastward and westward, and flew  against one another, like a scattering swarm of locusts, to the right  and left.\" There are not records of all the returns of this meteoric  swarm between the thirteenth century and the eighteenth, but when the  earth encountered it in 1799, Humboldt reported that \"from the beginning  of the phenomenon there was not a space in the firmament equal in extent  to three diameters of the moon that was not filled every instant with  bolides and falling stars;\" and Mr. Andrew Ellicott, an agent of the  United States, cruising off the coast of Florida, watched this same  meteoric display, and made the drawing reproduced on the opposite page.  In 1833 a planter in South Carolina wrote of a return of this same  system, \"Never did rain fall much thicker than the meteors fell towards  the earth; east, west, north, south, it was the same.\" In 1866 the  shower was again heavy and brilliant, but at the end of the nineteenth  century, when the swarm should have returned, the display was meagre and  ineffective.    [Illustration: METEORIC SHOWER OF 1799, NOVEMBER 12.    Seen off Cape Florida, by Mr. Andrew Ellicott.]    The Leonid system of meteorites did not always move in a closed orbit  round our sun. Tracing back their records and history, we find that in  A.D. 126 the swarm passed close to Uranus, and probably at that time the  planet captured them for the sun. But we cannot doubt that some such  similar sight as they have afforded us suggested the imagery employed by  the Apostle St. John when he wrote, \"The stars of heaven fell unto the  earth, even as a fig-tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken  of a mighty wind. And the heavens departed as a scroll when it is rolled  together.\"    And the prophet Isaiah used a very similar figure--         \"All the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens       shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall       fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a       falling fig from the fig-tree.\"    Whilst the simile of a great aerolite is that employed by St. John in  his description of the star \"Wormwood\"--         \"The third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from       heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third       part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters.\"    St. Jude's simile of the \"wandering stars, to whom is reserved the  blackness of darkness for ever,\" may have been drawn from meteors rather  than from comets. But, as has been seen, the two classes of objects are  closely connected.    The word \"meteor\" is sometimes used for any unusual light seen in the  sky. The Zodiacal Light, the pale conical beam seen after sunset in the  west in the spring, and before sunrise in the east in the autumn, and  known to the Arabs as the \"False Dawn,\" does not appear to be mentioned  in Scripture. Some commentators wrongly consider that the expression,  \"the eyelids of the morning,\" occurring twice in the Book of Job, is  intended to describe it, but the metaphor does not in the least apply.    The Aurora Borealis, on the other hand, seldom though it is seen on an  impressive scale in Palestine, seems clearly indicated in one passage.  \"Out of the north cometh golden splendour\" would well fit the gleaming  of the \"Northern Lights,\" seen, as they often are, \"as sheaves of golden  rays.\"          CHAPTER XI    ECLIPSES OF THE SUN AND MOON      We do not know what great comets, or aerolites, or \"star-showers\" were  seen in Palestine during the centuries in which the books of the Bible  were composed. But we do know that eclipses, both of the sun and moon,  must have been seen, for these are not the results of chance  conjunctions. We know more, that not only partial eclipses of the sun,  but total eclipses, fell within the period so covered.    There is no phenomenon of nature which is so truly impressive as a total  eclipse of the sun. The beautiful pageants of the evening and the  morning are too often witnessed to produce the same effect upon us,  whilst the storm and the earthquake and the volcano in eruption, by the  confusion and fear for personal safety they produce, render men unfit to  watch their developments. But the eclipse awes and subdues by what might  almost be called moral means alone: no noise, no danger accompanies it;  the body is not tortured, nor the mind confused by the rush of the  blast, the crash of the thunder-peal, the rocking of the earthquake, or  the fires of the volcano. The only sense appealed to is that of sight;  the movements of the orbs of heaven go on without noise or confusion,  and with a majestic smoothness in which there is neither hurry nor  delay.    This impression is felt by every one, no matter how perfectly  acquainted, not only with the cause of the phenomenon, but also with the  appearances to be expected, and scientific men have found themselves  awestruck and even overwhelmed.    But if such are the feelings called forth by an eclipse now-a-days, in  those who are expecting it, who are prepared for it, knowing perfectly  what will happen and what brings it about, how can we gauge aright the  unspeakable terror such an event must have caused in ages long ago, when  it came utterly unforeseen, and it was impossible to understand what was  really taking place?    And so, in olden time, an eclipse of the sun came as an omen of terrible  disaster, nay as being itself one of the worst of disasters. It came so  to all nations but one. But to that nation the word of the prophet had  come--         \"Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the       signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.\"    God did not reveal the physical explanation of the eclipse to the  Hebrews: that, in process of time, they could learn by the exercise of  their own mental powers. But He set them free from the slavish fear of  the heathen; they could look at all these terror-striking signs without  fear; they could look with calmness, with confidence, because they  looked in faith.    It is not easy to exaggerate the advantage which this must have given  the Hebrews over the neighbouring nations, from a scientific point of  view. The word of God gave them intellectual freedom, and so far as they  were faithful to it, there was no hindrance to their fully working out  the scientific problems which came before them. They neither worshipped  the heavenly bodies nor were dismayed at their signs. We have no record  as to how far the Hebrews made use of this freedom, for, as already  pointed out, the Holy Scriptures were not written to chronicle their  scientific achievements. But there can be no doubt that, given the  leisure of peace, it is _a priori_ more likely that they should have  taught astronomy to their neighbours, than have learnt it even from the  most advanced.    There must have been numberless eclipses of the moon seen in the ages  during which the Canon of Holy Scripture was written. Of eclipses of the  sun, total or very nearly total over the regions of Palestine or  Mesopotamia, in the times of the Old Testament, we know of four that  were actually seen, whose record is preserved in contemporaneous  history, and a fifth that was nearly total in Judaea about midday.    The first of the four is recorded on a tablet from Babylon, lately  deciphered, in which it states that on \"the 26th day of Sivan, day was  turned into night, and fire appeared in the midst of heaven.\" This has  been identified with the eclipse of July 31, 1063 B.C., and we do not  find any reference to it in Scripture.    The second is that of Aug. 15, 831 B.C. No specific record of this  eclipse has been found as yet, but it took place during the lifetime of  the prophets Joel and Amos, and may have been seen by them, and their  recollection of it may have influenced the wording of their prophecies.    The third eclipse is recorded on a tablet from Nineveh, stating the  coincidence of an eclipse in Sivan with a revolt in the city of Assur.  This has been identified with the eclipse of June 15, 763 B.C.    The fourth is that known as the eclipse of Larissa on May 18, 603 B.C.,  which was coincident with the final overthrow of the Assyrian Empire,  and the fifth is that of Thales on May 28, 585 B.C.    The earth goes round the sun once in a year, the moon goes round the  earth once in a month, and sometimes the three bodies are in one  straight line. In this case the intermediate body--earth or  moon--deprives the other, wholly or partially of the light from the sun,  thus causing an eclipse. If the orbits of the earth and moon were in the  same plane, an eclipse would happen every time the moon was new or full;  that is to say, at every conjunction and every opposition, or about  twenty-five times a year. But the plane of the moon's orbit is inclined  to the plane of the earth's orbit at an angle of about 5 deg., and so an  eclipse only occurs when the moon is in conjunction or opposition and is  at the same time at or very near one of the nodes--that is, one of the  two points where the plane of the earth's orbit intersects the moon's  orbit. If the moon is in opposition, or \"full,\" then, under these  conditions, an eclipse of the moon takes place, and this is visible at  all places where the moon is above the horizon at the time. If,  however, the moon is in conjunction, or \"new,\" it is the sun that is  eclipsed, and as the shadow cast by the moon is but small, only a  portion of the earth's surface will experience the solar eclipse. The  nodes of the moon's orbit are not stationary, but have a daily  retrograde motion of 3' 10.64''. It takes the moon therefore 27{d} 5{h}  5{m} 36{s} (27.21222{d}) to perform a journey in its orbit from one node  back to that node again; this is called a Draconic period. But it takes  the moon 29{d} 12{h} 44{m} 2.87{s} (29.53059{d}) to pass from new to  new, or from full to full, _i. e._ to"]]]
