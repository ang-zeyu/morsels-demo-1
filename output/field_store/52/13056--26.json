[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3055"],[0,"The Wood Beyond the World (#19)"],[1," the King's Son had been more than ever instant  with me to yield him my body, threatening me else with casting me into  all that the worst could do to me of torments and shames day by day.  I  say my heart failed me, and I was wellnigh brought to the point of yea-  saying his desires, that I might take the chance of something befalling  me that were less bad than the worst.  But here must I tell thee a thing,  and pray thee to take it to heart.  This, more than aught else, had given  me strength to nay-say that dastard, that my wisdom both hath been, and  now is, the wisdom of a wise maid, and not of a woman, and all the might  thereof shall I lose with my maidenhead.  Evil wilt thou think of me  then, for all I was tried so sore, that I was at point to cast it all  away, so wretchedly as I shrank from the horror of the Lady's wrath.\"    \"But there as I sat pondering these things, I saw a man coming, and  thought no otherwise thereof but that it was the King's Son, till I saw  the stranger drawing near, and his golden hair, and his grey eyes; and  then I heard his voice, and his kindness pierced my heart, and I knew  that my friend had come to see me; and O, friend, these tears are for the  sweetness of that past hour!\"    Said Walter: \"I came to see my friend, I also.  Now have I noted what  thou badest me; and I will forbear all as thou commandest me, till we be  safe out of the desert and far away from all evil things; but wilt thou  ban me from all caresses?\"    She laughed amidst of her tears, and said: \"O, nay, poor lad, if thou  wilt be but wise.\"    Then she leaned toward him, and took his face betwixt her hands and  kissed him oft, and the tears started in his eyes for love and pity of  her.    Then she said: \"Alas, friend! even yet mayst thou doom me guilty, and all  thy love may turn away from me, when I have told thee all that I have  done for the sake of thee and me.  O, if then there might be some  chastisement for the guilty woman, and not mere sundering!\"    \"Fear nothing, sweetling,\" said he; \"for indeed I deem that already I  know partly what thou hast done.\"    She sighed, and said: \"I will tell thee next, that I banned thy kissing  and caressing of me till to-day because I knew that my Mistress would  surely know if a man, if thou, hadst so much as touched a finger of mine  in love, it was to try me herein that on the morning of the hunting she  kissed and embraced me, till I almost died thereof, and showed thee my  shoulder and my limbs; and to try thee withal, if thine eye should  glister or thy cheek flush thereat; for indeed she was raging in jealousy  of thee.  Next, my friend, even whiles we were talking together at the  Well of the Rock, I was pondering on what we should do to escape from  this land of lies.  Maybe thou wilt say: Why didst thou not take my hand  and flee with me as we fled to-day?  Friend, it is most true, that were  she not dead we had not escaped thus far.  For her trackers would have  followed us, set on by her, and brought us back to an evil fate.  Therefore I tell thee that from the first I did plot the death of those  two, the Dwarf and the Mistress.  For no otherwise mightest thou live, or  I escape from death in life.  But as to the dastard who threatened me  with a thrall's pains, I heeded him nought to live or die, for well I  knew that thy valiant sword, yea, or thy bare hands, would speedily tame  him.  Now first I knew that I must make a show of yielding to the King's  Son; and somewhat how I did therein, thou knowest.  But no night and no  time did I give him to bed me, till after I had met thee as thou wentest  to the Golden House, before the adventure of fetching the lion's skin;  and up to that time I had scarce known what to do, save ever to bid thee,  with sore grief and pain, to yield thee to the wicked woman's desire.  But  as we spake together there by the stream, and I saw that the Evil Thing  (whose head thou clavest e'en now) was spying on us, then amidst the  sickness of terror which ever came over me whensoever I thought of him,  and much more when I saw him (ah! he is dead now!), it came flashing into  my mind how I might destroy my enemy.  Therefore I made the Dwarf my  messenger to her, by bidding thee to my bed in such wise that he might  hear it.  And wot thou well, that he speedily carried her the tidings.  Meanwhile I hastened to lie to the King's Son, and all privily bade him  come to me and not thee.  And thereafter, by dint of waiting and  watching, and taking the only chance that there was, I met thee as thou  camest back from fetching the skin of the lion that never was, and gave  thee that warning, or else had we been undone indeed.\"    Said Walter: \"Was the lion of her making or of thine then?\"    She said: \"Of hers: why should I deal with such a matter?\"    \"Yea,\" said Walter, \"but she verily swooned, and she was verily wroth  with the Enemy.\"    The Maid smiled, and said: \"If her lie was not like very sooth, then had  she not been the crafts-master that I knew her: one may lie otherwise  than with the tongue alone: yet indeed her wrath against the Enemy was  nought feigned; for the Enemy was even I, and in these latter days never  did her wrath leave me.  But to go on with my tale.\"    \"Now doubt thou not, that, when thou camest into the hall yester eve, the  Mistress knew of thy counterfeit tryst with me, and meant nought but  death for thee; yet first would she have thee in her arms again,  therefore did she make much of thee at table (and that was partly for my  torment also), and therefore did she make that tryst with thee, and  deemed doubtless that thou wouldst not dare to forgo it, even if thou  shouldst go to me thereafter.\"    \"Now I had trained that dastard to me as I have told thee, but I gave him  a sleepy draught, so that when I came to the bed he might not move toward  me nor open his eyes: but I lay down beside him, so that the Lady might  know that my body had been there; for well had she wotted if it had not.  Then as there I lay I cast over him thy shape, so that none might have  known but that thou wert lying by my side, and there, trembling, I abode  what should befall.  Thus I passed through the hour whenas thou shouldest  have been at her chamber, and the time of my tryst with thee was come as  the Mistress would be deeming; so that I looked for her speedily, and my  heart wellnigh failed me for fear of her cruelty.\"    \"Presently then I heard a stirring in her chamber, and I slipped from out  the bed, and hid me behind the hangings, and was like to die for fear of  her; and lo, presently she came stealing in softly, holding a lamp in one  hand and a knife in the other.  And I tell thee of a sooth that I also  had a sharp knife in my hand to defend my life if need were.  She held  the lamp up above her head before she drew near to the bed-side, and I  heard her mutter: 'She is not there then! but she shall be taken.'  Then  she went up to the bed and stooped over it, and laid her hand on the  place where I had lain; and therewith her eyes turned to that false image  of thee lying there, and she fell a-trembling and shaking, and the lamp  fell to the ground and was quenched (but there was bright moonlight in  the room, and still I could see what betid).  But she uttered a noise  like the low roar of a wild beast, and I saw her arm and hand rise up,  and the flashing of the steel beneath the hand, and then down came the  hand and the steel, and I went nigh to swooning lest perchance I had  wrought over well, and thine image were thy very self.  The dastard died  without a groan: why should I lament him?  I cannot.  But the Lady drew  him toward her, and snatched the clothes from off his shoulders and  breast, and fell a-gibbering sounds mostly without meaning, but broken  here and there with words.  Then I heard her say: 'I shall forget; I  shall forget; and the new days shall come.'  Then was there silence of  her a little, and thereafter she cried out in a terrible voice: 'O no,  no, no!  I cannot forget; I cannot forget;' and she raised a great  wailing cry that filled all the night with horror (didst thou not hear  it?), and caught up the knife from the bed and thrust it into her breast,  and fell down a dead heap over the bed and on to the man whom she had  slain.  And then I thought of thee, and joy smote across my terror; how  shall I gainsay it?  And I fled away to thee, and I took thine hands in  mine, thy dear hands, and we fled away together.  Shall we be still  together?\"    He spoke slowly, and touched her not, and she, forbearing all sobbing and  weeping, sat looking wistfully on him.  He said: \"I think thou hast told  me all; and whether thy guile slew her, or her own evil heart, she was  slain last night who lay in mine arms the night before.  It was ill, and  ill done of me, for I loved not her, but thee, and I wished for her death  that I might be with thee.  Thou wottest this, and still thou lovest me,  it may be overweeningly.  What have I to say then?  If there be any guilt  of guile, I also was in the guile; and if there be any guilt of murder, I  also was in the murder.  Thus we say to each other; and to God and his  Hallows we say: 'We two have conspired to slay the woman who tormented  one of us, and would have slain the other; and if we have done amiss  therein, then shall we two together pay the penalty; for in this have we  done as one body and one soul.'\"    Therewith he put his arms about her and kissed her, but soberly and  friendly, as if he would comfort her.  And thereafter he said to her:  \"Maybe to-morrow, in the sunlight, I will ask thee of this woman, what  she verily was; but now let her be.  And thou, thou art over-wearied, and  I bid thee sleep.\"    So he went about and gathered of bracken a great heap for her bed, and  did his coat thereover, and led her thereto, and she lay down meekly, and  smiled and crossed her arms over her bosom, and presently fell asleep."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30550"],[0,"Finn The Wolfhound (#19)"],[1,"appeared]      Finn galloped for about three miles, his heart swelling within him  for joy in his freedom. Then, gradually, his gait slackened to a  canter, and then to a trot, and, finally, the sight of a wayside  pond brought him to a standstill; and, after a mechanical look  behind him, he walked into the water and drank, and drank, and  drank till he could drink no more. Finn emerged from the pond with  heaving flanks and dripping muzzle, conscious now of some of his  hurts and bruises, but licking his wet chops with satisfaction, and  supremely glad of his freedom. He lay down on the grass near the  pond and proceeded to lick those of his wounds and bruises which  were within licking reach, and to pity himself regarding the sharp  pain in his side which his broken rib was causing. Presently a cart  came jolting along from the direction in which Finn had come, and  the Wolfhound shrank back as far as possible into the hedge behind  him. But the driver of the cart took no further notice of Finn than  to stare idly at him, possibly without even seeing him; at all  events with an absolutely incurious stare. With renewed confidence,  the young hound stretched himself out again on the cool grass and  presently began to doze, this being the wise manner of all his kind  in assisting Nature to cure them of their various ills.    While Finn dozed, another cart approached him from the little town  he had left behind, and in this second cart were two extremely  angry men, one of whom strongly desired Finn's recapture on  mercenary grounds, while the other desired it upon these grounds  and others also. Bill wanted his share of Finn's price; Matey  wanted his larger share of that price, and he also wanted badly to  have Finn securely tied up in a convenient position for being  soundly beaten. Matey would almost rather have foregone the money  than the satisfaction of administering the beating, the very  thorough beating which he pictured himself administering to Finn.  His heavy mouth twitched viciously as Matey thought about it.  Suddenly Bill pulled the pony on to its haunches with a jerk.    \"I'm jiggered if that ain't 'im a-waitin' for us!\" exclaimed Bill,  in a hoarse whisper.    Matey was out of the trap in an instant, and, with meat in his  hand, was already beginning a whining call, which was meant to be  extremely ingratiating. But Finn sprang to his feet at the sound of  the cart coming to a standstill, and, after one glance at Matey,  was off like a wolf down the empty country road.    This was yet another lesson learned. Finn would not be in a hurry  to rest by the wayside again. After two miles of galloping at the  rate of nearly twenty miles an hour, Finn steadied down to a fast  loping gait, which would have kept him abreast of any other road  vehicle than a motor-car, and maintained this for quite a long  while. Then, by reason of the pain in his side, and of other pains,  he decided to stop. But, with his last-learned lesson fresh in his  mind, he had no intention of resting by the roadside. With a twist  of pain that cut into his side like a knife, he leapt a field gate,  and crept along the inner side of the hedge for some distance  before finally curling up in a dry hollow beside a hayrick. Here,  sheltered by the rick and half buried in dry hay and straw, Finn  courted the sleep he needed, so that it came to him swiftly. In his  sleep the young Wolfhound whimpered occasionally, and once or twice  his whole great body shook to the sound of a growling bark, causing  two bloodshot eyes to be half opened, and then mechanically closed  again, with a small grunt, as Finn's muzzle drove a little deeper  into the dry hay under his hocks, and he allowed sleep to  strengthen its healing hold upon him.    It was a dream that caused Finn to give that growling bark, and it  was a dream of a kind that had been foreign to his breed for  generations. He dreamed that he was chasing Matey, in the form of a  huge rabbit, armed with a stick. Matey, the rabbit, bounded away  from him, just as ordinary rabbits did; but sounds came from  Matey's rabbit mouth, and they were the horrid, venomous sounds of  the curses with which Matey had followed him that morning in the  walled-in yard. In the dream Finn was always on the point of  leaping upon the back of rabbit-Matey's neck, with jaws stretched  wide for slaughter. But something always intervened to prevent Finn  taking the leap. The something was this: at the moment of the leap,  Matey always looked more like a man and less like a rabbit, and the  instinct which told Finn not to slay a man was a very strong one.  But, somehow, rabbit-Matey seemed an exception. Finn was very  anxious to feel the crunching of his shoulder and neck bones; and  altogether it was unfortunate that such a dream should have been  inspired in the brain of so nobly born a hound.    When Finn finally woke he gaped right in the eye of the setting  sun, and all about him was the solemn silence of a fine October  twilight. He yawned cavernously, and, raising his haunches,  stretched his huge trunk from fore-paws placed far out. But, in the  midst of the stretch, he gave a little smothered yelp of pain, and  came to earth again, solicitously licking at the ribs of his right  side. Matey's heavy boot had done great execution there. Slowly,  then, Finn rose, and walked out into the darkening twilight of the  field. Before he had covered a hundred yards, a rabbit started up  from behind a bush, and scurried hedgewards for its life. But the  distance was too great for bunny by three yards, and Finn's jaws  snapped his backbone in sunder within six feet of his own burrow.  This was hard on the rabbit; but it was no more than one tiny  instance of the outworking of Nature's most inexorable law. Finn  had killed many rabbits before this evening; but in the past he had  merely obeyed his hunting and killing instinct. Now this instinct  in him was sharpened by hunger, by having slept on the open earth,  and by being conscious of no human control or protection. Finn  proceeded to eat this particular rabbit, and that was distinctly a  new experience for him, and one that left him upon the whole  pleased with himself. He was not aware of the fact, of course, but  this simple act placed him more nearly on terms with his ancestors  than anything else he had ever done, unless, perhaps, one counts  the dream acts of that afternoon.    After his meal Finn strolled along the hedge-side till he came to a  gap, and then slipped through to the road. For a mile or two he  trotted along the silent road with no particular object in view,  and then, coming to a grassy lane, turned into that, and trotted  for another mile or two, leaping a gate and a stile which barred  his way at intervals, and coming presently to a group of three  large ricks. His side was aching dully, and Finn was rather unhappy  over finding no sign of the home beside the Downs where his friends  were, and his own comfortable bed. Having allowed his mind to dwell  upon this for several minutes, he sat down on his haunches near one  of the ricks, and howled to the stars about it all for quite a  while, and so effectively that a farmer, sitting in his comfortable  dining-room nearly half a mile away, made a remark to his daughter  about the new-fangled way these pesky motor-car people have of  blowing fog-horns like the ships at sea, and carrying on as if the  road belonged to them--drat 'un!    It was not active unhappiness, let alone misery like that of the  previous night, that moved Finn to this vocal display; but only a  kind of gentle melancholy such as we call home-sickness, and after  five minutes of it, he curled up beside one of the ricks, after  scratching and turning round and round sufficiently to make a kind  of burrow for himself, and was fast asleep in about two minutes.    In the morning, long before the dew was off the grass, Finn set out  to do what he had never done a before: he set out deliberately to  hunt and kill some creature for his breakfast. He very nearly  caught an unwary partridge, though the bird did not tempt him  nearly so strongly as a thing that ran upon the earth, and ran  fast. In the end his menu was that of the previous evening, and, as  he eyed its still warm and furry remains, Finn felt that life was  really a very good thing, even when one had a pain in one's side,  and a large assortment of bruises and sore places in various other  parts of one's body.    Towards midday Finn lounged into a rather large village, and did  not like it at all. It stirred up in him the recollection of Matey  and his horrible environment, and he began to hurry, impelled by a  nervous dread of some kind of treachery. Towards the end of the  village he passed a pretty, creeper-grown cottage, from the door of  which a policeman issued. The policeman stared at Finn, and smacked  his own leg. Then he bent his body in an insinuating manner and  called to the Wolfhound: \"Here, boy! Here, good dog! Come along!\"  But Finn only lengthened his stride, and presently broke into a  gallop. He was no longer the guileless, trustful Finn of a week  ago. The rural constable sighed as he resumed an erect position and  watched Finn's disappearing form.    \"He must be the dog that's wanted, all right; reg'ler monster, I'm  blessed if he isn't. But, takin' one thing with another, I'd just  as soon they catched him somewhere else than here. Why, I reckon my  missis 'ud have a fit. I don't call it hardly right, myself; not  'avin' 'em that size.\"    Half an hour later, to his great delight, Finn found himself clear  of roads and houses, and on the warm, chalky slopes of the Sussex  Downs. These great, smooth, immemorial hills, with their blunt  crests, and close-cropped, springy turf, brought a rush of home-feeling  into Finn's heart, which made his eyes misty, so that he  had to sit down and give vent to two or three long-drawn howls by  way of"]]]
