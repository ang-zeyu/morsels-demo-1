In his formal  plan for the institution, Joseph Henry outlined a program that  included the following statement: \"It is proposed to publish a series  of reports, giving an account of the new discoveries in science, and  of the changes made from year to year in all branches of knowledge.\"  This theme of basic research has been adhered to through the years by  thousands of titles issued in series publications under the  Smithsonian imprint, commencing with _Smithsonian Contributions to  Knowledge_ in 1848 and continuing with the following active series:      _Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology_    _Smithsonian Contributions to Botany_    _Smithsonian Contributions to the Earth Sciences_    _Smithsonian Contributions to the Marine Sciences_    _Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology_    _Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology_    _Smithsonian Folklife Studies_    _Smithsonian Studies in Air and Space_    _Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology_    In these series, the Institution publishes small papers and full-scale  monographs that report the research and collections of its various  museums and bureaux or of professional colleagues in the world of  science and scholarship. The publications are distributed by mailing  lists to libraries, universities, and similar institutions throughout  the world.    Papers or monographs submitted for series publication are received by  the Smithsonian Institution Press, subject to its own review for  format and style, only through departments of the various Smithsonian  museums or bureaux, where the manuscripts are given substantive  review. Press requirements for manuscript and art preparation are  outlined on the inside back cover.                                                Robert McC.

Now they waded through waist-high patches of wild rye, recalling with  its fine soft beard the waving fields of grain they had left in the far  East; again they pushed on in dense copses of the sinuous redwood, whose  delicate inner bark furnished pleasant Indian tobacco to the Frenchman  and half-breed. Sometimes the trail lay through an open wood with  smaller undergrowth, where beds of odorous mint recalled his Virginian  home to Lewis; where the delicate mountain-rose, in countless thousands,  was born to blush unseen; where, if only one ripened berry to-day  invited the hunter, other kinds promised their welcome fruit in due but  later season.    Rarely did the dull gray of the sky dim the glory of a whole day, and  the short summer showers, freshening the beauty of the landscape and  abating the fervid heat of mid-summer, seemed only too infrequent. And  above all, the pure, free, upland air, that gives vigor and health to  the body, joy and lightness to the heart, almost annihilates distance to  the eye; and in breathing which, one drinks into the lungs the very wine  of life. Surely more than the heroes of Virgil's song did they feel that  sweet in their memory would abide these days forever.    Of the mountains, now always in sight, and a constant source of  inspiration to the eager explorers, those to the north and northwest  were yet snow-capped, and Lewis says: \"They glisten with great beauty  when the sun shines on them in a particular direction, and most  probably from this glittering appearance have derived the name of the  Shining Mountains.\"    During his explorations of the country around the falls Captain Lewis  visited a remarkable and beautiful spring, near the present city of  Great Falls, Montana. Of it he writes:    \"The fountain, which perhaps is the largest in America, is situated in a  pleasant level plain, about twenty-five yards from the river, into which  it falls over some steep irregular rocks, with a sudden descent of about  six feet in one part of its course. The water boils up from among the  rocks with such force near the centre, that the surface seems higher  than the earth on the sides of the fountain, which is a handsome turf of  fine green grass.\"    While the main party was making the portage, a detachment was \"occupied  in fitting up a boat of skins, the iron frame of which, thirty-six feet  long, had been prepared for the purpose at Harper's Ferry. The iron  frame is to be covered with skins, and requires thin-shaved strips of  wood for lining. The skins necessary to cover it have already been  prepared--twenty-eight elk and four buffalo skins.\" This experimental  boat proved to be a total failure, and it was not till Lewis's long  journey was nearly over that he copied the skin boat of the Indian  squaws, which had excited his surprise, and found that the methods of  the locality could be followed with advantage in navigation as well as  otherwise.    [Illustration: Lieutenant William Clark.]    As the six canoes were insufficient to carry all their men and  supplies, Clark was sent ahead to find suitable wood for two more, there  being no fit trees below the falls. With much difficulty trees were  found, and two canoes, three feet wide and twenty-five and thirty-three  feet long respectively, were fashioned. Near here a deserted Indian  lodge or council house was seen. It was two hundred and sixteen feet in  circumference, made of sixteen cottonwood poles, fifty feet long,  converging toward the centre, where they were united and secured by  large withes of sinewy willow.    Although the swivel and some other articles had been cached at the head  of the falls, their loads were yet very heavy, and all walked except  those engaged in working the canoe. The windings of the river became  very tortuous, and frequent rapids made their progress correspondingly  slow and laborious.    Game was less plentiful, and, as it was necessary to save the dried and  concentrated food for the crossing of the mountains, it became somewhat  of a task to provide food for a party of thirty-two which consumed a  quantity of meat daily equal to an elk and deer, four deer or one  buffalo. Fortunately, the berries were now ripening, and, as they grew  in great quantities, proved a not inconsiderable contribution to their  food-supply. Of currants there were red, purple, yellow, and black, all  pleasant to the taste; the yellow being thought superior to any other  known variety. The purple service-berry and pinkish gooseberry were also  favorites. Besides, they made use of the very abundant and almost  omnipresent sunflower. Of it Lewis says: \"The Indians of the Missouri,  more especially those who do not cultivate maize, make great use of the  seed of this plant for bread or in thickening their soup. They first  parch and then pound it between two stones until it is reduced to a fine  meal. Sometimes they add a portion of water, and drink it thus diluted;  at other times they add a sufficient proportion of marrow grease to  reduce it to the consistency of common dough and eat it in that manner.  This last composition we preferred to all the rest, and thought it at  that time a very palatable dish.\"    The Missouri now took in general a southerly course, and on July 18th  they reached a bold clear stream, which was named Dearborn River for the  then Secretary of War. They had intended to send back a small party in  canoes with despatches, but as they had not met the Snake Indians, and  so were uncertain as to their friendliness, it was thought best not to  weaken their already small party for hostilities. Lewis decided,  however, to send Clark, with three men, in advance to open up  communication with these Indians and, if possible, to negotiate for  horses. Clark's journey was a failure, for the Indians, alarmed at the  firing of a gun, fled into the mountains.    The mountains now closed in on the explorers and they camped one night  at a place named the Gates of the Rocky Mountains. \"For five and  three-quarter miles these rocks rise perpendicularly from the water's  edge to the height of nearly twelve hundred feet. They are composed of  black granite near the base, but ... we suppose the upper part to be  flint of a yellowish brown and cream color. Nothing can be imagined more  tremendous than the frowning blackness of these rocks, which project  over the river and threaten us with destruction.... For the first three  miles there is not a spot, except one of a few yards, in which a man  could stand between the water and the towering perpendicular of the  mountains.\"    On July 25th Clark, who was in advance, reached the three forks of the  Missouri, where he had to camp, his party worn out, their feet full of  prickly pear needles and Chaboneau unable to go farther. The forks were  all clear pebbly streams, discharging large amounts of water. The  southeast fork was named Gallatin, the middle Madison, and the southwest  Jefferson, the latter two, of equal size, being larger branches than the  Gallatin.    At the three forks Sacajawea, the wife of Chaboneau, was encamped five  years before, when the Minnetarees of Knife River attacked the Snakes,  killed about a dozen and made prisoners of her and others of her tribe.  Strangely enough Chaboneau nearly lost his life crossing the Madison,  where Clark saved him from drowning. Lewis was struck with the seeming  indifference of the Snake woman on her return to the spot and her own  country.    The party followed Jefferson River, their journey being marked by the  killing of a panther seven and a half feet long, and the overturning of  a canoe, injuring one of the party, Whitehouse, losing some articles,  and wetting others, but the all-important powder was so well packed that  it remained dry.    \"Persuaded,\" says the narrative, \"of the necessity of securing horses to  cross the mountains, it was determined that one of us should proceed ...  till he found the Shoshones, ... who could assist us in transporting  our baggage.\" Captain Lewis with three men preceded, and on August 11,  saw \"with the greatest delight a man on horseback, at the distance of  two miles, coming down the plain toward them. On examining him with the  glass, Captain Lewis saw that he was armed with a bow and a quiver of  arrows; mounted on an elegant horse without a saddle, and a small string  attached to the under jaw answered as a bridle. Convinced that he was a  Shoshonee, and knowing how much of our success depended on the friendly  offices of that nation, Captain Lewis was full of anxiety to approach  without alarming him, and endeavor to convince him that he was a white  man. He therefore proceeded on towards the Indian at his usual pace;  when they were within a mile of each other the Indian suddenly stopped,  Captain Lewis immediately followed his example, took his blanket from  his knapsack, and holding it with both hands at the four corners, threw  it above his head and unfolded it as he brought it to the ground, as if  in the act of spreading it. This signal, which originates in the act of  spreading a robe or skin as a seat for guests to whom they wish to show  a distinguished kindness, is the universal sign of friendship among the  Indians on the Missouri and Rocky Mountains.\" Unfortunately, the brave  took alarm at the movement of Lewis's companions and fled. The next day  brought them to the head-waters of the Jefferson. Here, \"from the foot  of one of the lowest of these mountains, which rises with a gentle  ascent for about half a mile, issues the remotest water of the  Missouri. They had now reached the hidden sources of that river, which  had never yet been seen by civilized man; and as they quenched"]]]
