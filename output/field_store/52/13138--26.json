The effect  was infinitely more dapper, becoming to the figure, and serviceable for  hard wear. The Queenslanders and Canadians at once fraternised, the  older arrivals making the new comers welcome by inviting them to drinks  and breakfast, and generally \"showing them around.\" The bond of union  was cemented by the fact that the officer in command of the  Queenslanders, Colonel Ricardo, was an old Royal Canadian Artillery  officer.      COLONEL PILCHER'S RAID    New Year's Day was a great occasion for the Colonial troops. They had  been burning with impatience to come in touch with the enemy, and till  now no opportunity had been afforded for testing their prowess in the  field. At midday on the 31st of December a force under Colonel Pilcher  started off from Belmont. The force consisted of 200 Queenslanders,  commanded by Colonel Ricardo; 100 Canadians, Toronto Company, with two  guns; and a horse battery under Major de Rougemont; 30 Mounted Infantry  under Lieutenant Ryan (Munster Fusiliers); the New South Wales  Ambulance, under Surgeon-Major Dodds; and 200 Cornwall Light Infantry.  These left Belmont and proceeded westward. Twenty miles were covered  before sunset, and the force encamped at Cook's Farm. In this region, on  a string of kopjes, a Boer laager was reported to be, and this--it was  decided--must be removed.    [Illustration: MAP ILLUSTRATING COLONEL PILCHER'S RAID.    Scale 9 miles = 1 inch.]    Colonel Pilcher's programme, however, was not divulged. Great caution  was preserved, as the country was swarming with native spies, and all  movements of the troops were watched and reported to the enemy. The  Colonel therefore very adroitly arranged that no person should have a  chance of reporting his movements, and caused a watch to be kept on all  the natives, and these during the night were shut in their huts to  prevent any from escaping and communicating the intention of the troops.  The vigilance was certainly well rewarded. At daybreak the force  steadily marched out, creating as little dust as possible, and took up a  position at a place some fifteen miles off, called Sunnyside. Here the  enemy's laager was reported to be situated. It was posted on two  connected kopjes to north and south, and towards these kopjes the troops  advanced. When within a distance of some four miles the troops halted.  Major de Rougemont with two guns under Lieutenant Atkinson, Captain  Barker with the Toronto Company of Canadians, and Lieutenants Ryan and  Smith with the Mounted Infantry were ordered in the direction of the  enemy's laager to the north; while Colonel Pilcher with Colonel Ricardo  and the Queenslanders, A Company under Captain Chaucer, and B Company  under Captain Pinnock, advanced from the south. Patrols were sent to the  east. All was done with great quietness and precision, and the Boer  tactics so closely imitated that the enemy were unconscious of the  arrival of the British till the troops were upon them. Major Rougemont's  force made use of all the existing cover, which luckily was sufficient  to screen both man and horse, and in a very short time had discovered  some excellent ground which gave on to the Boer position. The enemy's  laager was ensconced in a nest of trees, at the base of a range of  kopjes commanded by a convenient ridge. This ridge--reported by the  Mounted Infantry to be clear of the enemy--with great promptness was  practically seized and occupied before the Boers had sufficiently  gathered themselves together to contest the position. The guns were  advanced at a trot, and unlimbered within 1500 yards of the laager, into  which two shells were neatly plumped, with a stupendous detonation that  startled the whole surrounding neighbourhood. Up scrambled the Boers,  streaming and bounding along the sides of the kopje like stampeded  goats, and commencing to fire with all their might. Upon our guns and  gunners came a torrent of lead fierce and sustained. Two Maxims under  Captain Bell now prepared to give tongue from the right, and then the  Toronto Company was ordered to double into action. They leapt to the  word. With a gasp of relief they cried, \"At last!\" and were off. When  within 1000 yards of the position their rifles came into play. A  hurricane of bullets met the enemy's fire: met it, continued  fiercely--and finally subdued it.    While the guns under Lieutenant Atkinson were booming and banging, the  Mounted Infantry, ably led by Lieutenant Ryan, were working their way  along the right, and hunting the enemy from a concealed position among  the scrub. At midday Colonel Pilcher and the Queenslanders were steadily  nearing the position from three separate directions. They approached  under cover, cautious as tigers and nimble as cats, finally firing, and  returning the fire, but only when they caught glimpses of the enemy.  Then they blazed away to good purpose, and continued to approach nearer  and ever nearer, till the enemy, in view of the persistent and deadly  advance, shrank from his ground, and sulkily retired. The dexterity of  the Queenslanders was remarkable; they stalked the enemy as a sportsman  would stalk a deer, criticising their own fire and the fire of the foe  with workmanlike coolness and interest. The success of these tactics was  complete. The laager was captured, and with it forty ill-kempt, surly  prisoners. Lieutenant Adie, who was with a patrol of four men, came  suddenly on a number of the enemy, and was wounded in two places, but he  was saved and carried off by two plucky fellows, Butler and Rose, who  came to his rescue. The latter was wounded, and his horse was killed.  Another dashing Queenslander, Victor Jones, was shot through the heart,  and Macleod, an equally brave comrade, after many lucky escapes, while  advancing with Colonel Pilcher's force, was shot through the spine.  While these heroic and tragic doings were taking place, General  Babington with a mounted force had been working hard, his operations  having been arranged for the purpose of co-operating with Colonel  Pilcher, and distracting the enemy's attention from the north. These  manoeuvres had the desired effect, and the day's work, apart from its  pathetic side, was accounted a glorious success. So cleverly had the  proceedings been contrived, and so ingeniously were the orders  interpreted by one and all, that the Boers were completely nonplussed.  There was a hurried stampede, and the Federals bolted, leaving their  laager with all its luxuries, its boiling soup, its gin and water  bottles, &c., at the mercy of the invaders.    [Illustration: COLONEL PILCHER'S ATTACK ON SUNNYSIDE KOPJE--CANADIAN AND  AUSTRALIAN CONTINGENTS RECEIVE THEIR \"BAPTISM OF FIRE.\"    Drawing by H. C. Seppings Wright from Sketch by Fred. Villiers.]    A vivid description of the Boer camp was given by Mr. Frederick Hamilton  of the _Toronto Globe_, who accompanied the Canadians.         \"Fourteen ancient tents, their blankets, kettles, and camp       utensils, tossed about in wild confusion. Three long waggons of       the type in which the voortrekkers voyaged the veldt, a team of       a dozen magnificent oxen, a big water-cart which we eyed       greedily, a Kaffir wattled hut, its floor piled high with odds       and ends of clothing and valuables, its doorway marked by a       shell-smash; the rocky kopje-side behind, a flat plain dotted       with shaggy, bushlike trees in front--such was the Boer laager.       Prisoners came from here and there, over a score from the       kopje-top, more from this corner and that of the field, and       were taken to the hut. Within it and around its door they       squatted, a silent downcast crew; what a mess they had made of       their affairs! Perhaps they were not so despondent as we       thought, for one man as he sat in the guarded group pointed out       a rifle which one of the victors was carrying, and claimed it       as his own--a piece of cheek which staggered our men. The       prisoners claimed only part of our attention; with eager       curiosity the camp was ransacked. At last we had our hands upon       these Boers: what manner of men were they, and how did they       live? Poorly enough, I should say; the camp must have been       densely crowded with the motley gathering, and we could see the       odd admixture of practical barbarism with occasional contact       with civilisation, as when good suits of clothes lay side by       side with repulsive-looking strips of biltong. We felt that all       this was ours, ours by right of battle, ours by virtue of       victory. Perhaps we were wrong, perhaps the confiscated       property of rebels should fall to the Crown, but as long as men       go to war so long will victors walk through the camp of the       vanquished with just that feeling swelling through their veins.       Something else lay heavy upon us--thirst. It raged through us.       The yellow pool where the veldt cut into the kopje face filled       our water-bottles, and we drank and drank. The foul dregs of       the Boers' water-cart were drained with joy. As the sun was       setting our own water-cart with more wholesome water drove up,       and we drank and drank again. As our fires were lighted, what       receptacles could be found were filled and the muddy fluid       boiled. Our transport waggons were miles away, and for tea or       coffee we were dependent on what we found in the Boer waggons.       I remember drinking a cup of hot water and finding it most       refreshing. Food was foraged. One section of our men found a       sheep's carcass hanging up under a tree, slaughtered by the       rebels before our shell changed the tenor of their day. Some       had hardtack or army rations in their haversacks. Here and       there they picked up enough to make up a meal, not especially       plentiful, and very scrappy, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3689"],[0,"Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 1 (#19)"],[1,"David's \"Bunte  Reihe,\" Op. 30, which Liszt transcribed for piano alone.]        72. To Carl Reinecke    My dear Mr. Reinecke,    I am still writing to you from Eilsen; your two kind and charming  letters found me here and have given me a very real pleasure. You  may rest quite assured during your life of the sincere and  affectionate interest I feel for you, an interest of which I  shall always be happy to give you the best proofs as far as it  depends on me.    Madame Patersi is loud in her praises both of your talent and of  yourself,--and I thank you sincerely for having so well fulfilled  my wishes with regard to the lessons you have been so kind as to  give to Blandine and Cosima. [Liszt's daughters. Blandine (died  1872) became afterwards the wife of Emile Ollivier; Cosima is the  widow of Wagner.] Who knows? Perhaps later on these girls will do  you honor in a small way by coming out advantageously with some  new composition by their master Reinecke, to the great applause  of Papa!    Hiller shows tact and taste in making sure of you as a coadjutor  at the Rhenish Conservatorium, which seems to be taking a turn  not to be leaky everywhere. Cologne has much good,  notwithstanding its objectionable nooks. Until now the musical  ground there has been choked up rather than truly cultivated!  People are somewhat coarse and stupidly vain there; I know not  what stir of bales, current calculations, and cargoes incessantly  comes across the things of Art. It would be unjust, however, not  to recognize. the vital energy, the wealth of vigor, the  praiseworthy activity of this country, in which a group of  intelligent men, nobly devoted to their task, may bring about  fine results, more easily than elsewhere.    At any rate I approve of what you have done, and compliment you  on having accepted Hiller's offer, [Namely, a position as  Professor at the Conservatorium of Cologne, which Reinecke  occupied from 1851 to 1854.] and shall have pleasure in sending  to your new address some of my latest publications, which will  appear towards the end of May (amongst others a new edition,  completely altered and well corrected, I hope, of my twelve great  Etudes, the Concerto without orchestra dedicated to Henselt, and  the six \"Harmonies Poetiques et Religieuses\"). I have also  written a very melancholy Polonaise, and some other trifles which  you will perhaps like to look over.    Let me hear from you soon, my dear Mr. Reinecke, and depend,  under all circumstances, on the faithful attachment of    Yours affectionately and sincerely,    F. Liszt    Eilsen, March 19th, 1851        73. To Dr. Eduard Liszt in Vienna    [An uncle of Liszt's (that is, the younger half-brother of his  father), although Liszt was accustomed to call him his cousin: a  noble and very important man, who became Solicitor-General in  Vienna, where he died February 8th, 1879. Franz Liszt clung to  him with ardor, as his dearest relation and friend, and in March,  1867, made over to him the hereditary knighthood.]    [Weimar, 1851]    Dear, excellent Eduard ,    It will be a real joy to me to take part in your joy, and I thank  you very cordially for having thought first of me as godfather to  your child. I accept that office very willingly, and make sincere  wishes that this son may be worthy of his father, and may help to  increase the honor of our name. Alas! it has been only too much  neglected and even compromised by the bulk of our relations, who  have been wanting either in noble sentiments, or in intelligence  and talent--some even in education and the first necessary  elements--to give a superior impulse to their career and to  deserve serious consideration and esteem. Thank God it is  otherwise with you, and I cannot tell you what a sweet and noble  satisfaction I derive from this. The intelligent constancy which  you have used to conquer the numerous difficulties which impeded  your way; the solid instruction you have acquired; the  distinguished talents you have developed; the healthy and wise  morality that you have ever kept in your actions and speech; your  sincere filial piety towards your mother; your attachment,  resulting from reflection and conviction, to the precepts of the  Catholic religion; these twenty years, in fine, that you have  passed and employed so honorably,--all this is worthy of the  truest praises, and gives you the fullest right to the regard and  esteem of honest and sensible people. So I am pleased to see that  you are beginning to reap the fruits of your care, and the  distinguished post to which you have just been appointed [He had  been made Assistant Public Prosecutor in 1850.] seems to justify  the hopes that you confided to me formerly, and which I treated,  probably wrongly, as so much naive ambition. At the point at  which you have arrived it would be entirely out of place for me  to poke advice and counsel out of season at you. Permit me, for  the sake of the lively friendship I bear you, and the ties of  relationship which bind us together, to make this one and only  recommendation, \"Remain true to yourself!\" Remain true to all you  feel to be highest, noblest, most right and most pure in your  heart! Don't ever try to be or to become something (unless there  were opportune and immediate occasion for it), but work  diligently and with perseverance to be and to become more and  more some one.--Since the difficult and formidable duty has  fallen upon you of judging men, and of pronouncing on their  innocence or guilt, prove well your heart and soul, that you may  not be found guilty yourself at the tribunal of the Supreme  Judge,--and under grave and decisive circumstances learn not to  give ear to any one but your conscience and your God!--    Austria has shown lately a remarkable activity, and a military  and diplomatic energy the service of which we cannot deny for the  re-establishment of her credit and political position. Certainly  by the prevision of a great number of exclusive Austrians--a  prevision which, moreover, I have never shared--it is probable  that the Russian alliance will have been a stroke of diplomatic  genius very favorable to the Vienna Cabinet, and that, in  consequence of this close alliance, the monarchical status quo  will be consolidated in Europe, notwithstanding all the  democratic ferments and dissolving elements which are evidently,  whatever people may say, at their period of ebb. I do not  precisely believe in a state of tranquility and indefinite peace,  but simply in a certain amount of order in the midst of disorder  for a round dozen of years, the main spring of this order being  naturally at Petersburg. From the day in which a Russian  battalion had crossed the Austrian frontier my opinion was fixed,  and when my friend Mr. de Ziegesar came and told me the news I  immediately said to him, \"Germany will become Russian, and for  the great majority of Germans there is no sort of hesitation as  to the only side it remains to them to take.\"    The Princess having very obligingly taken the trouble to tell you  my wishes with regard to my money matters, I need not trouble you  further with them, and confine myself to thanking you very  sincerely for your exactness, and for the discerning integrity  with which you watch over the sums confided to your care. May  events grant that they may prosper, and that they may not become  indispensable to us very soon.--    Before the end of the winter I will send you a parcel of music  (of my publications), which will be a distraction for your  leisure hours. I endeavour to work the utmost and the best that I  can, though sometimes a sort of despairing fear comes over me at  the thought of the task I should like to fulfill, for which at  least ten years more of perfect health of body and mind will be  necessary to me.    Give my tender respects to Madame Liszt; you two form henceforth  my father's entire family; and believe in the lively and  unalterable friendship of    Your truly devoted,    F. Liszt        74. To Count Casimir Esterhazy    [Autograph (without address) in the possession of Herr Albert  Cohn, bookseller in Berlin.--The addressee was presumably Count  Esterhazy, whose guest Liszt was in Presburg in 1840.]    Let me thank you very sincerely for your kind remembrance, dear  friend, and let me also tell you how much I regret that my  journey to Hohlstein cannot come to pass during your short stay  there. But as by chance you already find yourself in Germany,  will you not push on some fine day as far as Weymar?--I should  have very great pleasure in seeing you there and in receiving  you--not in the manorial manner in which you received me at  Presburg, but very cordially and modestly as a conductor, kept by  I know not what strange chance of fate at a respectful distance  from storms and shipwrecks!--    For three weeks past a very sad circumstance has obliged me to  keep at Eilsen, where I had already passed some months of last  winter. The reigning Prince is, as you have perhaps forgotten,  the present proprietor of one of your estates,--the Prince of  Schaumburg-Lippe. If by chance you are owing him a debt of  politeness, the opportunity of putting yourself straight would be  capital for me. Nevertheless I dare not count too much on the  attractions of the grandeur and charms of Buckeburg! and I must  doubtless resign myself to saying a longer farewell to you.    Let me know by Lowy of Vienna where I shall address to you some  pieces in print which you can look over at any leisure hour, and  which I shall be delighted to offer you. I will add to them later  the complete collection of my \"Hungarian Rhapsodies,\" which will  now form a volume of nearly two hundred pages, of which I shall  prepare a second edition next winter. Hearty and affectionate  remembrances from    Yours ever,    F. Liszt    Eilsen, June 6th, 1851        75. To Theodor Uhlig, Chamber Musician in Dresden    [Autograph in the possession of"]]]
