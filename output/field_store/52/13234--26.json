I know, lad, how you English object to  be embraced,--were it not for that, I would take you to my heart; but a  hand-clasp will say as much.\"    The two officers were almost as much excited as Garibaldi himself, for  this gift would remove one of the obstacles that lay in their way. By  means of a subscription contributed in small amounts by patriots all  over Italy for the purchase of arms, twelve thousand good muskets had  been bought and stored at Milan, together with ammunition. When, a few  days before Frank's arrival, Crispi, with some other of Garibaldi's  officers, had gone to fetch them, they found that Cavour had placed a  guard of royal troops over the magazine, with orders that nothing  whatever was to be taken out. Heavy though the blow had been, the  Garibaldian agents were already at work buying arms, but with no hope of  collecting more than sufficient for the comparatively small force that  would sail for Sicily. Even this addition of funds would not avail to  supply that deficiency, as it was very difficult for the general's  agents, closely watched as they now were, to purchase military weapons.    For some time the conversation turned entirely upon the steps to be  taken, now that the war-chest had been so unexpectedly replenished. Then  Garibaldi put aside the papers on which he had been taking notes, and  said,--    \"Enough for the time, Signor Percival. I shall, of course, write myself  to your good mother, expressing my heartfelt thanks, and telling her  that if success attends us, she can be happy in the knowledge that it  will be largely due to her. You will, naturally, yourself write home and  tell her what joy her gift occasioned, how much it added to our hopes  and relieved us of our difficulties. Tell her that I have appointed you  as a lieutenant on my staff, and that I shall trust you as I trusted  your noble father.\"    \"I thank you greatly, general; I hope to prove myself worthy of your  confidence.\"    \"And now, sir, will you advise me as to your own movements?\"    \"I have put up at the Hotel Europa.\"    \"At present it will be best for you to stay there. We are anxious that  there should be no appearance of any gathering here, and my friends will  not assemble until all the preparations are completed. How did you come  over here?\"    \"I drove, General; the carriage is waiting for me.\"    \"Then it must wait for awhile; or, better still, it can carry my two  friends here to the town, where they have much to do. In future it will  be best for you to walk over; 'tis but a short distance, and I know that  you English are good walkers. Of course, the authorities know that I am  here; there is no concealment about that. As long as they do not see any  signs of preparations for a movement, they will leave me alone. As  probably your prolonged stay at the hotel may excite curiosity, it is  well that you should visit the galleries and palaces, and take  excursions in the neighbourhood. It may be as well, too, that you should  mention casually at the _table-d'hote_ that you know me, as your father  was a great friend of mine when we were together in South America, which  will account for your paying visits here frequently. We know that we are  being closely looked after by government spies, and must therefore omit  no precaution. Now I wish you to take lunch with me, as I have many  questions to ask you. I had heard, of course, of Signor Forli being  missing, and of the correspondence between your government and that of  Naples on the subject.\"    Frank went out and told the driver that he should not be returning for  some time, but that two gentlemen would go back in the carriage in a few  minutes. \"As I took the carriage from the hotel, the hire will, of  course, be charged in my bill; but here are a couple of francs for  yourself.\"    In two or three minutes the Italian officers came out, and thanking  Frank for the accommodation, drove away, while the lad himself  re-entered the villa.    \"The meal is ready,\" Garibaldi said, when he entered the room where he  had left him. \"It is very pleasant to me to turn my thoughts for once  from the subject of my expedition.\"    The meal was a very simple one, though the general had ordered one or  two extra dishes in honour of his guest.    \"Now,\" he said, when they had sat down, and the servant had retired,  \"tell me first of all about the loss of my dear friend.\"    Frank related the story of his father going out to search for Signor  Forli, and how he had been captured and killed by brigands. As the  general listened, his kindly face grew stern and hard, but he did not  speak until Frank brought the tale to an end.    \"_Cospetto!_\" he exclaimed, \"he may have been killed by brigands, but I  doubt not the Neapolitan government were at the bottom of it. I would  wager any money that they hired the men of the mountains to disembarrass  them of one who was exposing the horrible secrets of their prisons. And  you say that his body could not be found. Was the search made for it  simply by the carabinieri?\"    \"It was made by them, sir, but the secretary of our legation accompanied  them, and wrote that, although he had himself searched everywhere in the  neighbourhood of the hut, he could find no traces whatever of a newly  made grave. I may say that Signora Forli still believes that my father  was not killed, but was, like her husband, carried off to some  dungeon.\"    \"It is possible,\" the general said, \"though I would not encourage you to  hope; the ways of these people are so dark that there is no fathoming  them. Since his grave could not be found, I regard it as certain that he  was not buried there, for his captors would not have troubled to carry  his body far, but would have dug a hole close by and thrown the earth  over the body; and in that case, when the band returned, one or the  other of the men who did the work would most likely have carelessly  pointed to the spot, and said, 'There lies the Englishman.' But though I  believe that he did not die there, he might have died elsewhere. His  wounds were evidently very severe, and they may have proved fatal after  he was carried off by those who took him away from the brigands; if they  were not fatal, he may have been murdered afterwards.\"    \"Signora Forli thought, general, that it was more probable that he had  been taken to one of the prisons, and that, just as they hunted down the  brigands in order that none of these should have power to betray them,  so they might have preferred putting him in prison to having him  murdered, because in the latter case the men employed might go to the  British legation and accept a large sum for betraying the secret.\"    \"It may have been so,\" the general said; \"and if we succeed, perhaps you  will find both your father and grandfather. But do not cherish false  hopes. Even if both were once in the Neapolitan dungeons, they may  before this have succumbed to their treatment there. You have mourned  them as dead; do not buoy yourself up with hope, for if you did so, the  chances are all in favour of your suffering a terrible disappointment.\"    \"That is just what my mother impressed upon me, general. She said that  from the first she had never allowed herself to think of my father as  in prison; and it was not until she received your letter, and thought  that at last there was really a chance that the inmost cells of all the  prisons would be opened, she would admit a possibility of my father  still being alive.\"    \"At least, she and you will have the consolation that if you do not find  those dear to you, you will have aided in restoring fathers and husbands  to hundreds of other grieving wives, mothers, and children.\"    \"May I ask how large a force you are likely to take over with you,  general?\"    \"If the government had remained neutral and not interfered with me, we  could have found men for the twelve thousand muskets they have seized;  as it is, we have been obliged to write letters to all parts of Italy,  stopping the volunteers who were preparing to join us. Some of these  letters will doubtless fall into the hands of the authorities, and we  have therefore so worded them that it may be supposed that the  expedition has been altogether given up. A thousand men is the utmost  that we can hope to embark secretly. These will be all picked men and  gallant fellows who fought under me in the Alps, or men who have, like  myself, been for years living as exiles. These thousand I have chosen,  every one; they will die fighting, and will never turn their back to an  enemy. Would that I had them all safely landed in Sicily, and had  surmounted all the difficulties and dangers that are caused by the  hostility of the government, which will, however, be glad enough to take  advantage of our work.\"    \"My mother thought that you would probably form the Neapolitan States,  if you conquered them, into a republic.\"    \"That was my dream when I was fighting at Rome but I see now that it is  impossible. I am for a republic on principle, but I must take what I can  get. I cannot conceal from myself that my experience of Mazzini and  other enthusiasts is that they are not practical, they commit terrible  blunders, and the matter ends in a dictatorship, as has twice been the  case in France. Mazzini would sacrifice the practical to gain his ideal.  I care nothing for theory--I want to see Italy free; and this can only  be done under Victor Emmanuel. He is popular and energetic. His father  suffered for his devotion to the cause of freedom. The son is a stronger  man; but at present he is forced by Cavour and the other temporisers who  surround him to curb his own impetuosity.    \"I don't like Cavour--he gave up my birthplace, Nice, to France; but, at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4558"],[0,"Barry Lyndon (#19)"],[1,"for that. He has bought a snug farm in Tipperary  with the money that was given him to secure his brothers; and I fancy  few men of the guards ever profited so much by it.'    The Prussian captain laughed exceedingly at this story, said that the  English were the cleverest nation in the world, and, on my setting him  right, agreed that the Irish were even more so. We rode on very well  pleased with each other; for he had a thousand stories of the war to  tell, of the skill and gallantry of Frederick, and the thousand escapes,  and victories, and defeats scarcely less glorious than victories,  through which the King had passed. Now that I was a gentleman, I could  listen with admiration to these tales: and yet the sentiment recorded  at the end of the last chapter was uppermost in my mind but three weeks  back, when I remembered that it was the great general got the glory, and  the poor soldier only insult and the cane.    'By the way, to whom are you taking despatches?' asked the officer.    It was another ugly question, which I determined to answer at  hap-hazard; and so I said 'To General Rolls.' I had seen the general  a year before, and gave the first name in my head. My friend was quite  satisfied with it, and we continued our ride until evening came on; and  our horses being weary, it was agreed that we should come to a halt.    'There is a very good inn,' said the Captain, as we rode up to what  appeared to me a very lonely-looking place.    'This may be a very good inn for Germany,' said I, 'but it would not  pass in old Ireland. Corbach is only a league off: let us push on for  Corbach.'    'Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?' said the officer.  'Ah! you sly rogue, I see THAT will influence you;' and, truth to say,  such a proposal WAS always welcome to me, as I don't care to own. 'The  people are great farmers,' said the Captain, 'as well as innkeepers;'  and, indeed, the place seemed more a farm than an inn yard. We entered  by a great gate into a Court walled round, and at one end of which was  the building, a dingy ruinous place. A couple of covered waggens were in  the court, their horses were littered under a shed hard by, and lounging  about the place were some men and a pair of sergeants in the Prussian  uniform, who both touched their hats to my friend the Captain. This  customary formality struck me as nothing extraordinary, but the aspect  of the inn had something exceedingly chilling and forbidding in it,  and I observed the men shut to the great yard-gates as soon as we were  entered. Parties of French horsemen, the Captain said, were about  the country, and one could not take too many precautions against such  villains.    We went into supper, after the two sergeants had taken charge of our  horses; the Captain, also, ordering one of them to take my valise to my  bedroom. I promised the worthy fellow a glass of schnapps for his pains.    A dish of fried eggs-and-bacon was ordered from a hideous old wench that  came to serve us, in place of the lovely creature I had expected to see;  and the Captain, laughing, said, 'Well, our meal is a frugal one, but a  soldier has many a time a worse:' and, taking off his hat, sword-belt,  and gloves, with great ceremony, he sat down to eat. I would not be  behindhand with him in politeness, and put my weapon securely on the old  chest of drawers where his was laid.    The hideous old woman before mentioned brought us in a pot of very sour  wine, at which and at her ugliness I felt a considerable ill-humour.    'Where's the beauty you promised me?' said I, as soon as the old hag had  left the room.    'Bah!' said he, laughing, and looking hard at me: 'it was my joke. I was  tired, and did not care to go farther. There's no prettier woman here  than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, you must wait a  while.'    This increased my ill-humour.    'Upon my word, sir,' said I sternly, 'I think you have acted very  coolly!'    'I have acted as I think fit!' replied the captain.    'Sir,' said I, 'I'm a British officer!'    'It's a lie!' roared the other, 'you're a DESERTER! You're an impostor,  sir; I have known you for such these three hours. I suspected you  yesterday. My men heard of a man escaping from Warburg, and I thought  you were the man. Your lies and folly have confirmed me. You pretend to  carry despatches to a general who has been dead these ten months: you  have an uncle who is an ambassador, and whose name forsooth you don't  know. Will you join and take the bounty, sir; or will you be given up?'    'Neither!' said I, springing at him like a tiger. But, agile as I was,  he was equally on his guard. He took two pistols out of his pocket,  fired one off, and said, from the other end of the table where he stood  dodging me, as it were,--    'Advance a step, and I send this bullet into your brains!' In another  minute the door was flung open, and the two sergeants entered, armed  with musket and bayonet to aid their comrade.    The game was up. I flung down a knife with which I had armed myself; for  the old hag on bringing in the wine had removed my sword.    'I volunteer,' said I.    'That's my good fellow. What name shall I put on my list?'    'Write Redmond Barry of Bally Barry,' said I haughtily; 'a descendant of  the Irish kings!'    'I was once with the Irish brigade, Roche's,' said the recruiter,  sneering, 'trying if I could get any likely fellows among the few  countrymen of yours that are in the brigade, and there was scarcely one  of them that was not descended from the kings of Ireland.'    'Sir,' said I, 'king or not, I am a gentleman, as you can see.'    'Oh! you will find plenty more in our corps,' answered the Captain,  still in the sneering mood. 'Give up your papers, Mr. Gentleman, and let  us see who you really are.'    As my pocket-book contained some bank-notes as well as papers of Mr.  Fakenham's, I was not willing to give up my property; suspecting very  rightly that it was but a scheme on the part of the Captain to get and  keep it.    'It can matter very little to you,' said I, 'what my private papers are:  I am enlisted under the name of Redmond Barry.'    'Give it up, sirrah!' said the Captain, seizing his cane.    'I will not give it up!' answered I.    'HOUND! do you mutiny?' screamed he, and, at the same time, gave me a  lash across the face with the cane, which had the anticipated effect  of producing a struggle. I dashed forward to grapple with him, the two  sergeants flung themselves on me, I was thrown to the ground and  stunned again; being hit on my former wound in the head. It was bleeding  severely when I came to myself, my laced coat was already torn off my  back, my purse and papers gone, and my hands tied behind my back.    The great and illustrious Frederick had scores of these white  slave-dealers all round the frontiers of his kingdom, debauching troops  or kidnapping peasants, and hesitating at no crime to supply those  brilliant regiments of his with food for powder; and I cannot help  telling here, with some satisfaction, the fate which ultimately befell  the atrocious scoundrel who, violating all the rights of friendship and  good-fellowship, had just succeeded in entrapping me. This individual  was a person of high family and known talents and courage, but who had  a propensity to gambling and extravagance, and found his calling as a  recruit-decoy far more profitable to him than his pay of second captain  in the line. The sovereign, too, probably found his services more useful  in the former capacity. His name was Monsieur de Galgenstein, and he was  one of the most successful of the practisers of his rascally trade. He  spoke all languages, and knew all countries, and hence had no difficulty  in finding out the simple braggadocio of a young lad like me.    About 1765, however, he came to his justly merited end. He was at this  time living at Kehl, opposite Strasburg, and used to take his walk upon  the bridge there, and get into conversation with the French advanced  sentinels; to whom he was in the habit of promising 'mountains and  marvels,' as the French say, if they would take service in Prussia.  One day there was on the bridge a superb grenadier, whom Galgenstein  accosted, and to whom he promised a company, at least, if he would  enlist under Frederick.    'Ask my comrade yonder,' said the grenadier; 'I can do nothing without  him. We were born and bred together, we are of the same company, sleep  in the same room, and always go in pairs. If he will go and you will  give him a captaincy, I will go too.'    'Bring your comrade over to Kehl,' said Galgenstein, delighted. 'I will  give you the best of dinners, and can promise to satisfy both of you.'    'Had you not better speak to him on the bridge?' said the grenadier.  'I dare not leave my post; but you have but to pass, and talk over the  matter.'    Galgenstein, after a little parley, passed the sentinel; but presently a  panic took him, and he retraced his steps. But the grenadier brought  his bayonet to the Prussian's breast and bade him stand: that he was his  prisoner.    The Prussian, however, seeing his danger, made a bound across the bridge  and into the Rhine; whither, flinging aside his musket, the intrepid  sentry followed him. The Frenchman was the better swimmer of the two,  seized upon the recruiter, and bore him to the Strasburg side of the  stream, where he gave him up.    'You deserve to be shot,' said the general to him, 'for abandoning your  post and arms; but you merit reward for an act of courage and daring.  The King prefers to reward you,' and the man received money and  promotion.    As for Galgenstein, he declared his quality as a nobleman and a captain  in the Prussian service, and applications were made to Berlin to know if  his representations were true. But the King, though he employed men of  this stamp (officers to seduce the subjects of his allies) could not  acknowledge his"]]]
