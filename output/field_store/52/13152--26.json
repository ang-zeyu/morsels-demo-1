They are present in developmental stage 44 before  metamorphosis is completed. The maxillaries bear a few teeth anteriorly  and are ossified posteriorly to a point one-third of the distance from  the anterior to the posterior edge of the orbit. Ossification lengthens  the posterior termini of the maxillaries to the posterior edge of the  orbit. In front of the anterior margin of the orbit, bone is  proliferated dorsal to the main axes of the maxillaries and forms  moderate dorsal maxillary flanges. The premaxillaries appear  simultaneously with the maxillaries. Initially they are widely separated  medially from each other, and laterally from the developing maxillaries;  each bears two or three teeth, large dorsally blunt alary processes, and  small palatine processes. The median and lateral edges of the prenasal  processes lengthen heterochronously, causing the median edges to be  longest and to lie slightly dorsal to the level of the septomaxillaries.  After the maxillaries and premaxillaries develop, the vomers appear as  small horizontal ossifications anterior to the parasphenoid.  Ossification begins in the lateral flanges, then in the prevomerine  processes, and lastly in the posterior dentigerous parts of the bones;  the prevomerine processes are the last parts of the vomers to ossify  completely.    Initially the frontoparietals are present as thin rods of ossification  dorsomedial to the orbits; the frontoparietals extend from the anterior  to the posterior end of the orbit by developmental stage 44. The  anterior ends of the bones remain thin and pointed; ossification  progresses medially from the midpoint of the length of the orbit and  posteriorly to the level of the exoccipital; a median center of  ossification joins the frontoparietals posteriorly, thereby forming the  posterior border of the frontoparietal fontanelle. The supraorbital  flanges of the frontoparietals do not appear until all other cranial  bones are ossified, or nearly so. The most rapid ossification begins  laterally at the posterior edge of the orbit and decreases anteriorly  over the posterior half of the orbit. This differential rate of  proliferation of bone results in the pattern of development of the  supraorbital flanges shown in figure 7. The nasals appear as  thin slivers of bone half way between the anterior ends of the  frontoparietals and the end of the snout. As ossification proceeds the  nasals assume a triangular shape in dorsal view. The anterior ends are  pointed; the lateral margins are parallel to the maxillaries. The  posteromedial points do not reach the lateral margins of the ethmoid,  and the maxillary processes extend about three-fourths the distance from  the bodies of the nasals to the maxillaries. Following the union of the  frontoparietals posteriorly, the nasals widen anteriorly and are  narrower at the midpoints of their long axes than anteriorly or  posteriorly. With further ossification the maxillary processes extend to  the maxillaries and form complete bony anterior margins to the orbits;  the mid-parts of the nasals widen (Pl. 1B).        [Illustration: FIG. 7. Developmental sequence of the frontoparietal         fontanelle and associated bony elements in _Smilisca baudird_:         (A) KU 60026, x5; (B) KU 85438, x4; (C) KU 26328, x3;         (D) KU 68184, x2.3.]    The parasphenoid is the first of the palatal bones to appear. At  metamorphosis the bone is well developed; the anterior tip is situated  just in front of the anterior edge of the orbit, and posteriorly the  lateral processes extend laterally beyond the ossified parts of the  auditory region. The pterygoids do not appear until metamorphosis, when  ossification is evident in only the mid-parts of the posterolateral  arms. Ossification follows in the mid-parts of the anterolateral arms  and occurs last in the pterygoid pedicles. The palatines do not appear  until all three arms of the pterygoids are at least partly ossified.  Ossification proceeds rapidly from the maxillaries medially to the  unossified ethmoid, which is the last of the cranial bones to appear.  Initially it is extremely shallow; dorsally it is widely separated from  the nasals, and ventrally the posterior margin meets the anterior point  of the parasphenoid. In dorsal view, ossification proceeds anteriorly  between the nasals and posteriorly, ventral to the frontoparietals;  ventrally, ossification proceeds posteriorly dorsal to the parasphenoid.    The ventral arms of the squamosal and the supraoccipital region of the  exoccipital are the first occipital bones to appear. Ossification  follows in the regions of the semicircular canals and occipital  condyles. The dorsal end of the ventral arm of the squamosal and the  posterior arm of the squamosal ossify as a unit at the same time the  quadratojugal appears. Shortly thereafter the anterior arm of the  squamosal ossifies, the distal part of the columella appears, and the  anterior and lateral parts of the auditory region ossify.    The angular and dentary of the lower jaw appear concurrently with the  dentigerous bones. Initially, the angular is short and broad; the  articular surface is absent, and the anterior end is slightly overlapped  by the dentary. The mentomecklians do not ossify until approximately  the same time that the quadratojugal appears in the upper jaw.    _Comparative Osteology_    The genus _Smilisca_ is characterized by the following combination of  cranial osteological characters: (1) A large amount of bone is involved  in the skull and a minimal amount of cartilage and/or secondarily  ossified cartilage; co-ossification is absent. (2) The skulls are  uniformly broad with angular lateral margins, and truncate anteriorly.  (3) An internasal septum and quadratojugals are present. (4) A  well-developed squamosal minimally extends one-fourth the distance from  the dorsal end of the quadrate to the maxillary, and maximally is  separated from the maxillary by a suture. (5) The ethmoid is large; the  distance between the anterior end of the ethmoid and the anterior edge  of the premaxillary varies between 15 and 20 per cent of the total  length of the skull.    On the basis of cranial osteology two species-groups can be recognized  within the genus _Smilisca_. The _sordida_ group, comprising _S.  sordida_ and _puma_, is characterized by a broad skull in which the  lateral margins of the maxillaries are relatively straight anterior to  the orbit. The moderate-sized nasals are rounded anteriorly, and bear  relatively short, sometimes blunt, maxillary processes. The long axes of  the nasals are not parallel to the maxillaries. The ethmoid is  proportionately small in the _sordida_ group. The bony part of the  ethmoid terminates near the anterior edge of the orbits and does not  extend anteriorly between the nasals; the entire anterior margin of the  ethmoid is separated from the nasals by cartilage. The squamosals are  generally small. They are narrow in dorsal view, and minimally extend  one-fourth the distance from the dorsal end of the quadrate to the  maxillary, and maximally, two-thirds the distance. The tegmen tympani  are relatively small (Fig. 8).        [Illustration: FIG. 8. Dorsal views of the skulls of the species of         _Smilisca_: (A) _S. baudini_ (KU 68184); (B) _S. puma_ (KU 68636);         (C) _S. phaeota_ (KU 41090); (D) _S. sila_ (KU 80625); (E) _S.         cyanosticta_ (KU 55938), and (F) _S. sordida_ (KU 36765). x1.5.]    In contrast to the tendency for reduction of cranial parts in the  _sordida_ group, the _baudini_ group, constituted by _S. cyanosticta_,  _phaeota_, and _baudini_, is characterized by more ossification of the  cranial elements. The skull is broad; the lateral margins are less  angular and are gently curved, rather than straight as in the _sordida_  group. The nasals tend to be larger with the long axes parallel to the  maxillary. Anteriorly the nasals are pointed, and posteriorly they bear  long, delicate palatine processes extending to the maxillary. The  ethmoid is fully ossified, extends anteriorly between the nasals, and  laterally is separated by a suture from the nasals if the latter are  fully ossified. The squamosals are large, and wide in dorsal view. They  minimally extend one-fourth the distance from the dorsal end of the  quadrate to the maxillary, and maximally are sutured to the maxillary.  The tegmen tympani are massive.    _Smilisca sila_ is intermediate between the two species-groups  described. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37839"],[0,"My Experiences in Manipur and the Naga Hills (#19)"],[1," a distance of  thirteen miles on the border of the valley, and up to which the road  is flat, and soon entered a broken country, first grass, then scrub,  then forest. The road lay over a succession of spurs of the Kowpree  Hills which run down into a very narrow valley, and was as bad as  can be imagined--very steep ascents and descents. At last we reached  Kaithemabee, the second stage, and fourteen miles from Sengmai. It  is exceedingly picturesquely situated, having a splendid view of the  Kowpree range, here rising to over 8000 feet. The outpost is situated  on a high bank overlooking a stream, and beyond it a splendid rolling  slope of grass extending for miles.    All this part of the country is covered with beehive-shaped cairns,  built of well-selected stones. They are said to have been made by  the Koeereng Nagas, formerly a very powerful race, whose miserable  remnants now inhabit the neighbouring hills. Farther on the bee-hives  end suddenly, and a region of monoliths is entered. Probably both  monoliths and bee-hives were erected to commemorate great events  in the lives of the builders, the death of a chief, the birth of  a son, the giving of a great feast when a bison, or possibly many,  were killed. Monoliths are common, and exist all over the Naga Hills  and among the Kolarian and Dravidian tribes, as well as all over  Europe. Cairns also are common, but the beehive-shaped cairns are,  I believe, unique, and found only in Manipur and in this neighbourhood.    I reached Mayung Khang at 4 P.M., having an hour before crossed the  watershed, all the streams south of it falling into the tributaries of  the Chindwin Irrawaddy, all to the north running into the tributaries  of the Ganges and Burrhampooter.    Mayung Khang is a highly undulating grassy slope, the Kowpree rising  to nearly nine thousand feet in the west, while after crossing a small  stream a lower range closes it in on the east. We halted there for  the night close to a monolith, and the next day marched to Mythephum.    Mythephum or Muphum (lit. Manipuri settlement) was a small military  post, and we encamped below in a wide valley among recently cut  rice fields, with a river rushing by us. The place is so named from  having been a Manipuri settlement, in the old days before the Burmese  invasion. High hills rose above us on all sides, the valley running  in and out among them and following the course of the stream. To  our north, and at a distance of a mile or two, was the once powerful  village of Muram, still populous but submissive. I had a small but  most comfortable straw-built hut, and well remember how delightful the  early morning was next day, when I had breakfast at sunrise and saw  my thermometer at thirty-two degrees. Only those accustomed to great  heat realise the delights of a low thermometer. Mythephum is over  4000 feet above the sea, and being a low valley is often extremely  cold. Sometimes in winter the stream is for a day quite choked by  blocks of ice, and I have seen the thermometer at twenty-six degrees,  150 feet above the valley, which probably meant eighteen degrees at  the lowest level on the grass.    It was my intention to march on Mozuma by a track which would avoid  the powerful villages of Viswema, Kohima, Jotsuma and Konoma, and  enable me to attack the enemy in the rear. Half-way I was delayed  by receiving no letter from Mr. Carnegy, with whom I had to act in  concert, and this prevented me from reaching the scene of operations,  as I received the startling news that the Manipuri outpost of Kongal  Tannah on the borders of the Kubo valley had been attacked on December  14th by a party of men sent by the Rajah of Sumjok or Thoungdoot,  and eight men killed. This threw the whole population of Manipur into  a state of commotion, and the Maharajah begged me to return at once,  and I felt it my duty to do so, as my chief work was to protect Manipur  and its interests. I therefore returned to Manipur on December 17th,  leaving my party on the frontier, where they remained some time longer,  the Nagas being unwilling to submit; and making overtures instead to  the Maharajah Chandra Kirtee Singh. He sternly declined their offers,  and threatened that if they did not speedily yield to the British  authorities, he would send a large force to our aid.    The Naga Hills Campaign of that year had no further interest for  Manipur, and it had a sad ending for us, as Mr. Carnegy was accidently  shot by a sentry.    The \"Kongal outrage,\" as it was thenceforth called, was so serious and  so evidently premeditated, that a most thorough inquiry was needed. It  took some time to collect evidence as wounded men had to be brought  in, and it was the end of the month before I was able to proceed to  the spot. At last I started and crossed the Yoma range of hills for  the first time. What a lovely march it was and what an anxious one,  as I left my wife not at all well, and no one but an ignorant and  not very sweet-tempered English nurse to look after her. However,  duty must come first, and off I started, posting relays of ponies on  the way to enable me to return quickly when the work was done. Thangal  Major accompanied me.    The first part of our march lay across the valley, and we began the  ascent of the hills at a place called Ingorok. After a wearisome ascent  of 3500 feet and a more gradual one along the crest, we made a rapid  descent of 4000 feet to the Turet river, where we encamped. The river  runs at the bottom of an exceedingly narrow valley, and the ascent on  both sides is one of the most wearisome I have ever made. On a dark  night lights on the hillside above, appear as stars from the bed of  the stream. The scenery was majestic, and the vegetation very fine. The  next day we commenced with a steep ascent of 2500 feet, and ended with  a descent of 3000 feet to the Maghung river. From the Maghung next  morning we started for Kongal Tannah, which we reached in good time.    I carefully examined the place and saw the charred remains of the  murdered men, and many bullets still sticking in the stockade. The  evidence being complete, I turned homewards, and by travelling  incessantly reached Manipur next morning to find that my wife had  presented me with another son, the first pure European child born in  Manipur. It had been an anxious time for me, and I was thankful to  find both her and the baby well. We named the baby Arthur.    I sent a full report of the Kongal case to the Government of India,  and a demand for reparation was made at the Court of Mandalay,  but it was not backed up with sufficient vigour. The outrage was  unprovoked, and nothing less than the execution of the ringleaders,  who were well known, would have satisfied Manipur, and, indeed,  the claims of justice, but though the case dragged on for years, no  redress was ever given. I predicted at the time that failure to do  justice would eventually lead to underhand reprisals on the part of  Manipur, as the Durbar could not understand our Government tolerating  an attack of this kind on a protected state, and naturally ascribed our  forbearance to weakness. I shall have to refer to the case farther on.                CHAPTER XII.        Discussions as to New Residency--Its completion--Annual boat      races--Kang-joop-kool--Daily work--Dealings with the Durbar.      I have briefly described the old Residency which was rented from  the Heir Apparent. Money had been sanctioned for a new Residency,  to belong to the British Government, but there had been squabbles  for a long time between my predecessors and the Durbar regarding a  suitable site. Also such a building as was required could only be  built with the help of the Durbar whom it was advisable to conciliate.    One of my predecessors wished to build on a small hill called  \"Chinga,\" about a mile from the palace. It was an admirable site,  and had the position of the Political Agent been similar to that in  other Indian States, it could not have been better. But in Manipur, the  representative of the Government of India was regarded by the Maharajah  as a powerful prop and support in case of his throne being attacked,  as was constantly the case in former years. On this ground the Durbar  objected that it was too far off; also that the place was reported  to be the residence of an evil spirit inimical to the Royal family,  so that it was not a convenient spot for the Maharajah to visit. So,  after many acrimonious disputes, the negotiation fell through.    Another Political Agent chose a site called Ching-mai-roong, which  in many ways was very satisfactory, and the Durbar reluctantly  consented to give it, but it was a mile and a half from the palace,  and therefore much out of the way. The question was still in abeyance  when I arrived. As soon as I had time, I discussed the matter with  the Durbar, and found the Maharajah much averse to my removal from  the old site. He said \"Where you are now, I can call to you; but if  you go to a distance, I shall be cut off entirely.\"    I quite saw the advisability of being on the spot, also in what I may  call the fashionable quarter of the town; and, as from a sanitary point  of view, the position was as good as any other, I agreed to stay, on  condition that all the squalid houses and slums in the neighbourhood  were cleared away, dirty tanks filled, and others deepened, and a fine  large space cleared and handed over to me. I further insisted that  I should have all the assistance necessary in building a suitable  Residency. My terms were agreed to, and the work put in hand. I  determined to have a building worthy of the representative of the  British Government, and sacrificed everything to suitable rooms, and  sound construction, so that it was not till the end of 1880 that it  was finished.    I was greatly indebted to my head clerk, Baboo Rusni Lall Coondoo, who  acted as clerk of the works. The result was a charming residence. "]]]
