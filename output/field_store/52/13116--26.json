It's the       only thing, concerning myself that is, which you do not know as       well as I, and if I have not confided this to you, it was because I       almost feared to. But then, why try to explain and excuse on paper       when we are to meet, please God, so soon. Brother mine, what if       that flood tide which comes, they say, to each, once in life, was       on its way to you and to me? Well, it shall not separate us, Rob.;       not by my will. But stop. I shall grow positively oracular if I       keep on, (no one ever could understand an oracle, you know) and so,       till we meet, adieu.         \"BROTHER CHARLIE.\"      When Ferrars had read this strange missive once, he sat for a moment as  if thinking, and then deliberately re-read it slowly, and with here and  there a pause; when at last he handed it back to Brierly, he asked:    \"Do you understand that letter?\"    \"No more than I do the riddle of the sphinx, Ferrars,\" he leaned forward  eagerly as he put a question, and his eyes were apprehensive, though his  voice was firm. \"Do you connect that letter in any way with my brother's  death?\"    For a moment the detective was silent, thinking of the newspaper and the  missing clipping. Then he replied slowly as if considering between the  words.    \"Of course it's possible, Mr. Brierly, but as yet I cannot give an  opinion. If you will trust that letter to me for a few days, however,  perhaps I may see more clearly. It's a surprise, I'll admit. I had fully  decided in my own mind that howsoever much the murderer may have  premeditated and planned, his victim was wholly unaware of an en-- of  his danger.\"    \"You were about to say, of an enemy!\"    \"Yes. It is what I have been saying before seeing that letter.\" He put  out his hand, and as Brierly placed the letter in it, he added, \"Let us  not discuss this further. Does your friend, Mr. Myers, know of it?\"    \"Not a word.\"    \"Then for the present let it rest between us.\"    Two days after this interview Doran dropped in at the doctor's office,  and before he left had managed to put a newspaper, folded small, into  the hands of the detective, quite unperceived by the other occupants of  the room. For while since Brierley's return, accompanied by his friend,  these two had occupied together the rooms at Mrs. Fry's, the doctor's  cottage was still headquarters for them all, while Ferrars now had  solitary possession of the guest chamber, formerly assigned to Brierly.    Mr. Myers was a shrewd lawyer, as well as a faithful family friend. He  had felt from the first that there was mystery as well as crime behind  the death of Charles Brierly, who had been near and dear to him, as dear  as an own son, for the two families had been almost as one ever since  John Myers and the elder Brierly, who had been school friends and fellow  students, finally entered together the career of matrimony.    There had been no children in the Myers homestead, and the two lads  soon learned to look upon the Myers' house as their second home, and  \"Uncle\" John Myers had ranked, in their regard, only second to their  well beloved father. So that when the young men were left alone, in a  broken and desolate home, that other door opened yet wider, and claimed  them by right of affection.    Mr. Myers had been taken to the scene of the murder, had visited Hilda  Grant, and by his own desire had examined the books, papers, and  manuscripts in Charles Brierly's rooms, and on the day of Doran's call,  a longer drive than he had yet taken had been arranged. He was going,  accompanied by Brierly and driven by Doran, to look at the skiff, still  unclaimed and waiting upon the lake shore below the town.    Ferrars, much to Doran's regret, had declined to accompany them from the  first, and when he found himself in possession of the coveted newspaper,  he joined the others in their desire that Doctor Barnes should take the  fourth seat in the light surrey behind Doran's pet span; and the day  being fine, and business by no means pressing, that gentleman consented.          CHAPTER XIV.    A GHOST.      When Ferrars found himself alone he lost no time in locking his chamber  door and beginning his study of ancient news.    Taking the newly arrived paper from beneath his pillow, where he had  hastily thrust it, he spread out the mutilated copy beside it and  speedily located the clipping which should explain, or interpret,  Charles Brierly's last letter.    Putting the perforated paper over the other, as the quickest means to  the end, he drew a pencil mark around the paragraph which appeared in  the vacant space, and then, without pausing to read it, he reversed the  two sheets and repeated the operation.    This done, he took up the marked paper and sat down to read and digest  the secret.    \"It won't take long to tell which side of this precious square of paper  contains the thing I want, I fancy,\" he meditated, as he smoothed out  the sheet.    The printed paragraph outlined by his pencil was hardly three inches in  length, and he read it through with a growing look of comprehension upon  his face. \"I wonder if that can be it?\" he said to himself at the end.  And then he slowly turned the paper and read the pencil-marked lines  upon the other side.    When he had perused the brief lines over, his brow knit itself into a  frown, and he re-read them, with his face still darkened by it. Then he  uttered a short laugh, and laid the paper down across his knee.    \"I wonder if the other fellow will know which side was which!\" he  muttered. \"I'm blest if I do!\" He sat for half an hour with the paper  upon his knee, looking off into space, and wrinkling his brow in  thought. Then he got up and put the two papers carefully away.    \"I'm very thankful that I did not speak of this to Brierly,\" he thought  as he went out and locked his door behind him. \"It would be only another  straw--yes, a whole weight of them, added to his load of doubt and  trouble.\"    The two paragraphs read as follows, the first being an advertisement,  with the usual heading, and in solid nonpareil type:--           \"Charlie: A. has found you out. He will not give me your address.       Be on guard at all times, for there is danger. All will be forgiven       if you will come back, and F. will help you to avoid A. You are not       safe where you are. The city is better, and we cannot feel at ease       knowing the risk you are running. At least stay where you are. Your       brother or some friend ought to know. For your own sake do not       treat this warning as you did A.'s other threat. He means it. Still       at G. Street.         \"M.\"      The second paragraph was in the form of a would-be facetious editorial  paragraph, and ran thus:--           \"Not to have a fortune is sad enough, but to go up and down in the       land a millionaire and never know it is wretchedness indeed. Many       are the foreign fortunes seeking American heirs, if we are to       believe the advertising columns, and the heirs seeking fortunes are       as the sands of the sea in number.         \"There have been the Frayles, and the Jans, and a long retinue of       lost heirs to waiting estates, and now it appears that the great       Paisley fortune rusts in idleness and shamelessly accumulates,       while the heirs of a certain Hugo Paisley, an Englishman who was       last heard from in the Canadas many years ago, are much to be       desired now that the home supply of English bred Paisley stock is       run out.\"      There was more to this screed below the line which marked the lower end  of the clipping, but it contained no further reference to the Paisleys,  merely dilating in a would-be humorous manner upon the degenerating  influence of the foreign legacy upon the American citizen. But the  advertisement upon the other side had been cut out in full, and exactly  at the beginning and end.    It was puzzling and disappointing in the extreme. Ferrars had really  looked upon this cut newspaper as his strongest card when he should have  found the missing fragment, and now----! He thought and wondered, and  re-read letter and clipping again and again, but to no good purpose, and  at last he locked away the puzzling documents and went out to make a  morning call upon Mrs. Jamieson.    That evening he talked first with Robert Brierly and then with the  family lawyer, and to both he put the same direct questions, \"What could  they tell him of the early history of the Brierlys? of Mrs. Brierly's  family and ancestors? Had they any relatives in England or Scotland,  say? Were there any old family papers in the possession of either?\"    Of Robert Brierly he also asked if, to his knowledge, his brother had  had at any time a love affair--not serious, but amusing, perhaps--a  student's flirtation, even. Also, when and for how long, if at all, had  the brothers been separated since their schooldays?    And Brierly had replied that he knew very little of his father's  ancestors, beyond the fact that his grandfather Brierly was a Virginia  gentleman, and his father an only son. The family, so far as he knew,  had been Virginians for three generations, and what more, pray, could an  American ask? As for his mother, she had been a Miss Louise Cotterrell  of Baltimore, her father a railway magnate of renown. In her desk, very  much as she had left it, in a closed-up room in the old house, were  bundles of old letters and ancient family papers, so his father had once  told him; he had meant to examine them some time, but had not yet so  done. If Ferrars desired it he would do this soon.    So far as his dead brother was concerned, Brierly was sure there had  never been a love affair of even the most ephemeral sort. In fact,  Charles had always been shy of women, and used to shirk his social  duties as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3533"],[0,"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (#19)"],[1,"discovery.    He raised his head, and looked for a moment through the window at the  shadow of the church against the night, so outlined that you could  almost fancy that the light of the New Jerusalem was beyond it. Then he  wrote, and this time not to the world at large but only to Mullins:    \"My dear Harry, I want to resign my charge. Will you come over and help  me?\"      When the Dean at last rose from writing that, I think it was far on in  the night. As he rose he looked again through the window, looked once  and then once more, and so stood with widening eyes, and his face set  towards what he saw.    What was that? That light in the sky there, eastward?--near or far he  could not say. Was it already the dawn of the New Jerusalem brightening  in the east, or was it--look--in the church itself,--what is that?--that  dull red glow that shines behind the stained-glass windows, turning them  to crimson? that fork of flame that breaks now from the casement and  flashes upward, along the wood--and see--that sudden sheet of fire that  springs the windows of the church with the roar of splintered glass and  surges upward into the sky, till the dark night and the bare trees and  sleeping street of Mariposa are all illumined with its glow!    Fire! Fire! and the sudden sound of the bell now, breaking upon the  night.    So stood the Dean erect, with one hand pressed against the table for  support, while the Mariposa fire bell struck out its warning to the  sleeping town,--stood there while the street grew loud with the tumult  of voices,--with the roaring gallop of the fire brigade,--with the harsh  note of the gong--and over all other sounds, the great seething of the  flames that tore their way into the beams and rafters of the pointed  church and flared above it like a torch into the midnight sky.    So stood the Dean, and as the church broke thus into a very beacon  kindled upon a hill,--sank forward without a sign, his face against the  table, stricken.      You need to see a fire in a place such as Mariposa, a town still half of  wood, to know what fire means. In the city it is all different. To  the onlooker, at any rate, a fire is only a spectacle, nothing more.  Everything is arranged, organized, certain. It is only once perhaps in a  century that fire comes to a large city as it comes to the little wooden  town like Mariposa as a great Terror of the Night.    That, at any rate, is what it meant in Mariposa that night in April, the  night the Church of England Church burnt down. Had the fire gained but  a hundred feet, or less, it could have reached from the driving shed  behind the church to the backs of the wooden shops of the Main Street,  and once there not all the waters of Lake Wissanotti could stay the  course of its destruction. It was for that hundred feet that they  fought, the men of Mariposa, from the midnight call of the bell till the  slow coming of the day. They fought the fire, not to save the church,  for that was doomed from the first outbreak of the flames, but to stop  the spread of it and save the town. They fought it at the windows,  and at the blazing doors, and through the yawning furnace of the open  belfry; fought it, with the Mariposa engine thumping and panting in the  street, itself aglow with fire like a servant demon fighting its own  kind, with tall ladders reaching to the very roof, and with hose that  poured their streams of tossing water foaming into the flames.    Most of all they fought to save the wooden driving shed behind the  church from which the fire could leap into the heart of Mariposa. That  was where the real fight was, for the life of the town. I wish you could  have seen how they turned the hose against the shingles, ripping and  tearing them from their places with the force of the driven water: how  they mounted on the roof, axe in hand, and cut madly at the rafters  to bring the building down, while the black clouds of smoke rolled in  volumes about the men as they worked. You could see the fire horses  harnessed with logging chains to the uprights of the shed to tear the  building from its place.    Most of all I wish you could have seen Mr. Smith, proprietor, as I think  you know, of Smith's Hotel, there on the roof with a fireman's helmet  on, cutting through the main beam of solid cedar, twelve by twelve, that  held tight still when the rafters and the roof tree were down already,  the shed on fire in a dozen places, and the other men driven from the  work by the flaming sparks, and by the strangle of the smoke. Not so  Mr. Smith! See him there as he plants himself firm at the angle of the  beams, and with the full impact of his two hundred and eighty pounds  drives his axe into the wood! I tell you it takes a man from the pine  country of the north to handle an axe! Right, left, left, right, down  it comes, with never a pause or stay, never missing by a fraction of  an inch the line of the stroke! At it, Smith! Down with it! Till with  a shout from the crowd the beam gapes asunder, and Mr. Smith is on the  ground again, roaring his directions to the men and horses as they haul  down the shed, in a voice that dominates the fire itself.    Who made Mr. Smith the head and chief of the Mariposa fire brigade that  night, I cannot say. I do not know even where he got the huge red helmet  that he wore, nor had I ever heard till the night the church burnt down  that Mr. Smith was a member of the fire brigade at all. But it's always  that way. Your little narrow-chested men may plan and organize, but when  there is something to be done, something real, then it's the man of size  and weight that steps to the front every time. Look at Bismarck and  Mr. Gladstone and President Taft and Mr. Smith,--the same thing in each  case.    I suppose it was perfectly natural that just as soon as Mr. Smith came  on the scene he put on somebody's helmet and shouted his directions  to the men and bossed the Mariposa fire brigade like Bismarck with the  German parliament.    The fire had broken out late, late at night, and they fought it till the  day. The flame of it lit up the town and the bare grey maple trees, and  you could see in the light of it the broad sheet of the frozen lake,  snow covered still. It kindled such a beacon as it burned that from the  other side of the lake the people on the night express from the north  could see it twenty miles away. It lit up such a testimony of flame that  Mariposa has never seen the like of it before or since. Then when the  roof crashed in and the tall steeple tottered and fell, so swift a  darkness seemed to come that the grey trees and the frozen lake vanished  in a moment as if blotted out of existence.      When the morning came the great church of Mariposa was nothing but a  ragged group of walls with a sodden heap of bricks and blackened wood,  still hissing here and there beneath the hose with the sullen anger of  a conquered fire. Round the ruins of the fire walked the people of  Mariposa next morning, and they pointed out where the wreck of the  steeple had fallen, and where the bells of the church lay in a molten  heap among the bricks, and they talked of the loss that it was and how  many dollars it would take to rebuild the church, and whether it was  insured and for how much. And there were at least fourteen people who  had seen the fire first, and more than that who had given the first  alarm, and ever so many who knew how fires of this sort could be  prevented.    Most noticeable of all you could see the sidesmen and the wardens and  Mullins, the chairman of the vestry, talking in little groups about the  fire. Later in the day there came from the city the insurance men and  the fire appraisers, and they too walked about the ruins, and talked  with the wardens and the vestry men. There was such a luxury of  excitement in the town that day that it was just as good as a public  holiday.    But the strangest part of it was the unexpected sequel. I don't know  through what error of the Dean's figures it happened, through what lack  of mathematical training the thing turned out as it did. No doubt the  memory of the mathematical professor was heavily to blame for it, but  the solid fact is that the Church of England Church of Mariposa turned  out to be insured for a hundred thousand, and there were the receipts  and the vouchers, all signed and regular, just as they found them in a  drawer of the rector's study. There was no doubt about it. The insurance  people might protest as they liked. The straight, plain fact was that  the church was insured for about twice the whole amount of the cost and  the debt and the rector's salary and the boarding-school fees of the  littlest of the Drones all put together.      There was a Whirlwind Campaign for you! Talk of raising money,--that was  something like! I wonder if the universities and the city institutions  that go round trying to raise money by the slow and painful method  called a Whirlwind Campaign, that takes perhaps all day to raise fifty  thousand dollars, ever thought of anything so beautifully simple as  this.    The Greater Testimony that had lain so heavily on the congregation went  flaming to its end, and burned up its debts and its obligations and  enriched its worshippers by its destruction. Talk of a beacon on a hill!  You can hardly beat that one.    I wish you could have seen how the wardens and the sidesmen and Mullins,  the chairman of the vestry, smiled and chuckled at the thought of it.  Hadn't they said all along that all that was needed was a little faith  and effort? And here it was, just as they said, and they'd been right  after all.    Protest from the insurance people? Legal proceedings to prevent payment?  My dear sir! I see you know nothing about the Mariposa court, in spite  of the fact that I have already said that it was one of the most  precise instruments of British fair play ever established.
