[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34131"],[0,"Butterflies and Moths (British) (#19)"],[1,"at once condemn the former method, at least for field  work, as troublesome and inconvenient; and as to the other, I have tried  the effect of a puff (and many puffs) of tobacco smoke on an imprisoned  insect, but was so dissatisfied with the result that I am not likely to  do so again.    We have now considered a good many insecticides more or less suitable to  our purpose, but there still remains the unsolved problem as to which is  the best. Each one has its advantages. For _convenience_ nothing beats  the cyanide bottle. It is very speedy in its action, and the use of a  bottle is a little preferable to a metal box, for you can always satisfy  yourself as to its efficiency without opening it. Cyanide, chloroform,  benzole, and some others render the insects more or less brittle and  stiff, so that it is not so easy to 'set' them for the cabinet. Perhaps,  if you happen to have a supply of growing laurel close at hand, you  cannot do better than stick to the laurel box. The time taken in  bruising up a few leaves is inconsiderable, and the moisture given off  from them will keep your insects moist and supple, or will even 'relax'  them if they have become rigid. But try various plans for yourself, and  you will be able to settle a question which all the entomologists in the  world cannot answer for you--which method answers best in _your_ hands.    The next item for our consideration is the 'collecting box.' This is  merely a box in which the butterflies are pinned as soon as they are  dead. Here, again, we shall note a few variations from which a selection  can be made according to the means or the ingenuity of the reader. For a  couple of shillings you can obtain a good zinc collecting box, lined  with cork, of oval form (a most convenient shape for the pocket), and  quite large enough for one day's captures; and half that modest sum will  purchase a wooden box, also lined with cork, adapted to the same  purpose.    As with many other things, so with collecting boxes, the cheapest is  often the dearest in the end. You may feel inclined to save a shilling  by buying a wooden box, but you are sure to discard it after a little  practical experience for a metal one. We shall speak a little later on  concerning the advisability of 'setting' the butterflies as soon as  possible after capture; but this is not always practicable, especially  after a good day's catch. Now, if the insects are pinned in a wooden  box, they soon become dry and rigid, and consequently cannot be 'set'  till they have been put through the more or less tedious process of  'relaxing.' If you use a wooden collecting box you will often find, on a  hot and dry day, that all or nearly all your butterflies are rigid  before you arrive home; but a metal box will keep them moist and supple,  so that you can even put off the setting till the following day if you  are unable to do it immediately after your return.    Another point worth considering is the best economy of space. If your  collecting box is only about one inch deep inside, you have room for  only one layer of pinned insects; but a box only a little deeper may be  lined with cork both at top and bottom, and thus be made to accommodate  double the number. The zinc boxes sold by the dealers are generally  lined with cork in this manner, and are, of course, deep enough for the  double layer of specimens; but the wooden boxes are sometimes lined on  the bottom only. After these few remarks you will at once see the  economy of expending the extra shilling on the former.    Although the prices of collecting boxes are low, yet there are many who  would prefer making their own, and there is much to be said in favour of  this. A great deal of pleasure is to be derived from the construction of  your own apparatus, especially when that apparatus is afterwards to be  used in the pursuit of a delightful hobby. During the whole of the time  thus engaged, you are looking forward with the most pleasurable feelings  to the glorious treat before you, and every joint you make seems to  bring you nearer to the realisation of your joys. During the bleak  winter months there is no better employment for an entomologist who has  a little spare time than the preparation for the next outing. It is just  one of those artful schemes by which he seeks to get as much pleasure  out of life as it is capable of affording. How many there are who, for  the lack of a pleasant and instructive hobby, find their leisure hours  the most dismal of all, and who complain of the toil and wearisomeness  of their lot! The mournful thought with them is, 'Is life worth living?'  but who ever heard such an expression from the lips of an active  entomologist?    But I must have done with moralising and proceed to business. The  question is--How shall we set to work about the construction of a  collecting box? If it is to be a wooden one, select or make a box of  such a size as to suit your pocket or satchel, and cover the bottom, and  lid too if the depth allows of it, with sheet cork or slices of good  wine corks, about one-eighth of an inch thick, fixed on with glue.    The metal box is not quite so easy, but even here you may save yourself  much work by keeping your eyes open. Very neat little collecting boxes  can be made out of the flat metal boxes in which are sold certain  favourite brands of tobacco. Some of these are just the right depth, and  also of a very convenient size for the coat pocket. Beg one of these  boxes from a smoking friend, and if the lid is not held by a hinge (a  great advantage, by the way), you can easily solder on a brass one.    All that remains now is the fixing of the cork. Buy a sheet of cork at a  naturalist's shop, this being a commodity always in stock, and cut out  two pieces just the size to cover the bottom and the lid.    Gum and glue are not very satisfactory as fixing agents, for, as you  will presently learn, there are times when it will be necessary to keep  the box moist, and moisture softens both these substances. The cork must  be fixed by means of little strips of metal. Here are two ways of doing  this:    First.--Cut a few little strips of sheet tin, each about two inches long  and one-eighth wide. Double and bend them as shown in fig. 46, and  solder them to the surfaces which the cork is to cover (fig. 47). As the  cork is pushed in its place, these little slips are allowed to force  themselves through slits in it made by means of a penknife, and then the  ends are bent over as shown in fig. 48. Two or three such fasteners will  be quite sufficient to hold down each sheet of cork.    [Illustration: FIG. 46.]    [Illustration: FIG. 47.]    [Illustration: FIG. 48.]    [Illustration: FIG. 49.]    Second.--Put the sheets of cork in their places _first_, then make a few  little slits through both metal and cork with the point of a penknife,  and then bind the two together with a few ordinary paper fasteners. This  arrangement is shown in section in fig. 49.    Just one point more concerning the metal collecting box. You will often  call moisture to your aid in keeping the butterflies flexible and soft.  This will have but little action on zinc, but will sooner or later cause  the 'tin' (really tinned iron) box to rust. Here, then, is a point in  favour of zinc, but still a home-made 'tin' collector will last a long  time if kept dry when not in use.    As already hinted, there are times when it is desirable to take home  certain butterflies alive, either for a study of their movements or for  the purpose of securing eggs for breeding. To this end you must provide  yourself either with a number of 'chip boxes' with a few small holes  pricked in the cover, or with some metal boxes with perforations for the  admission of air. If the latter, you will have no difficulty in  securing a few 'tin' boxes of suitable size, but, as the surface of the  metal is very smooth, you should always introduce a few leaves or  something else that will provide a foothold for the inmates.    The last item of the outfit is the pins. Ordinary draper's pins are  quite out of the question. They are far too thick and clumsy for the  collector's work. If you are not already acquainted with the  'entomological pins,' you had better ask a dealer to give you a sample  card. This will be very useful for reference until you become well  acquainted with the various lengths, thicknesses, numbers and prices.  The card will contain one of each kind, with price and number attached.    If you fix a butterfly with the ordinary pin, you may find the latter  partly covered over with verdigris after a time. This bright green  substance is formed by the action of decomposing animal matter on the  copper of the pin, and gives a very unsightly appearance to the  specimen. To avoid this the entomological pins are either silvered,  blackened or gilded. The silvered pins tarnish after a time, but the two  other kinds keep their colour well, and are therefore better. The gilded  ones are rather expensive and unnecessary, and perhaps the black ones  are to be preferred to the silvered, although they are rather more  costly.    Most dealers will supply you with a box of mixed pins, each box  containing about six different sizes. This is very convenient for those  who work in a rather small way; but if you intend to make entomology a  prolonged study you had better get an ounce or so of each of the more  useful sizes.    Butterflies vary much in size, and Nos. 3 to 8 are the most useful sizes  of pins to fix them; No. 3 being for the largest, and 8 for the  smallest.    Supposing all the foregoing requisites to be quite ready, still you are  really by no means prepared for all your work. The butterflies captured  should be set as soon as possible after your return, and everything  required for _this_ part of the work must be in perfect trim. Yet I  think it will be more convenient just now to confine our attention to  the subject"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34175"],[0,"Domestic Animals (#19)"],[1," appear of great  importance that the whey should be as completely removed from the curd  as it can possibly be. To aid in effecting this, a curd-mill, for  chopping it fine after the whey is _strained_ off, is in use in many of  the large English dairies, and a very ingenious and effectual pneumatic  cheese-press for sucking out the whey, was lately invented.    But the way in which the whey is separated is not a matter of  indifference, and has much influence upon the quality of the cheese.  Thus, in Norfolk, according to Marshall, when the curd is fairly set,  the dairy-maid bares her arm, plunges it into the curd, and with the  help of her wooden ladle, breaks up minutely, and intimately mixes the  curd with the whey. This she does for ten or fifteen minutes, after  which the curd is allowed to subside, and the whey is drawn off. By this  agitation, the whey must carry off more of the butter and the cheese  must be poorer.    In Cheshire and Ayrshire, the curd is cut with a knife, but is gently  used and slowly pressed till it is dry enough to be chopped fine, and  thus more of the oily matter is retained. On the same principle, in  making the Stilton cheese, the curd is not cut or broken at all, but is  pressed gently and with care till the whey gradually drains out. Thus  the butter and the curd remain intermixed, and the rich cheese of  Stilton is the result. Thus, while it is of importance that all the whey  should be extracted from the curd, yet the quickest way may not be the  best. More time and care must be bestowed in order to effect this  object, the richer the cheese we wish to obtain.    The quality of the milk or of the pastures, may often be blamed for the  deficiencies in the richness or other qualities of cheese, which are in  reality due to slight but material differences in the mode of  manufacturing it.    _The kind of salt_ used, is considered by many to have some effect upon  the taste of the cheese. Thus the cheese of Gerome, in the Vosges, is  supposed to derive a peculiar taste from the Lorena salt with which it  is cured. In Holland, the efficacy of one kind of salt over another for  the curing of cheese is generally acknowledged.      The Mode in which the Salt is applied.    In making the large Cheshire cheeses, the dried curd, for a single  cheese of sixty pounds, is broken down fine and divided into three equal  portions. One of these is mingled with double the quantity of salt added  to the others, and this is so put into the cheese-vat as to form the  central part of the cheese. By this precaution, the after-salting on the  surface is sure to penetrate deep enough to cure effectually the less  salted parts.    In the counties of Gloucester and Somerset the curd is pressed without  salt, and the cheese, when formed, is made to absorb the whole of the  salt afterwards through its surface. This is found to answer well with  the small and thin cheeses made in those counties, but were it adopted  for the large cheeses of Cheshire and Dunlop, or even for the pine-apple  cheeses of Wiltshire, there can be no doubt that their quality would  frequently be injured. It may not be impossible to cause salt to  penetrate into the very heart of a large cheese, but it cannot be easy  in this way to salt the whole cheese equally, while the care and  attention required must be greatly increased.      Addition of Cream or Butter to the Curd.    Another mode of improving the quality of cheese, is by the addition of  cream or butter to the dried and crumbled curd. Much diligence, however,  is required fully to incorporate these, so that the cheese may be  uniform throughout. Still this practice gives a peculiar character to  the cheeses of certain districts. In Italy, they make a cheese _after  the manner of the English_, into which a considerable quantity of butter  is worked; and the _Reckem_ cheese of Belgium is made by adding half an  ounce of butter and the yolk of an _egg_, to every pound of pressed  curd.      Size of the Cheese.    From the same milk, it is obvious that cheeses of different sizes, if  treated in the same way, will, at the end of a given number of months,  possess qualities in a considerable degree different. Hence, without  supposing any inferiority, either in the milk or in the general mode of  treatment, the size usually adopted for the cheeses of a particular  district or dairy, may be the cause of a recognised inferiority in some  quality, which it is desirable that they should possess in a high  degree.      The Method of Curing.    This has very much influence upon the quality of the cheese. The care  with which they are salted, the warmth of the place in which they are  kept during the first two or three weeks, the temperature and closeness  of the cheese-room in which they are afterwards preserved, the frequency  of turning, of cleaning from mould, and rubbing with butter; all these  circumstances exercise a remarkable influence upon the after-qualities  of the cheese. Indeed, in very many instances, the high reputation of a  particular dairy district or dairy farm, is derived from some special  attention to some or to all of these apparently minor points.    In Tuscany, the cheeses, after being hung up for some time at a proper  distance from the fire, are put to ripen in an underground, cool, and  damp cellar; and the celebrated French cheeses of Roquefort, are  supposed to owe much of the peculiar estimation in which they are held,  to the cool and uniform temperature of the subterranean caverns in which  the inhabitants of the village have long been accustomed to preserve  them.      Ammoniacal Cheese.    The influence of the mode of curing, is shown very strikingly in the  small ammoniacal cheeses of Brie, which are very much esteemed in Paris.  They are soft unpressed cheeses, which are allowed to ripen in a room,  the temperature of which is kept between 60 deg. and 70 deg. Fahrenheit, till  they begin to undergo the putrefactive fermentation, and emit an  ammoniacal odor. They are generally unctuous, and sometimes so small as  not to weigh more than an ounce.      Inoculating Cheese.    It is said that a cheese, possessed of no very striking taste of its  own, may be inoculated with any flavor we approve, by putting into it  with a scoop a small portion of the cheese which we are desirous that  it should be made to resemble. Of course, this can apply only to cheeses  otherwise of equal richness, for we could scarcely expect to give a  Gloucester the flavor of a Stilton, by merely patting into it a small  portion of a rich and esteemed Stilton cheese. [_Johnston and various  other authorities._]    [Illustration: Fig. 19.    Cheese-Press.]    Fig. 19 is a _self-acting cheese-press_, light yet strong. The cheese  itself gives a pressure of twelve times its own weight; and if this is  insufficient, additional weight may be added as required.    The following statements were made by those receiving premiums from the  New York State Agricultural Society:    \"Number of cows kept, eleven. Cheese made from two milkings, in the  English manner; no addition made of cream. For a cheese of twenty  pounds, a piece of rennet about two inches square is soaked about twelve  hours in one pint of water. As rennets differ much in quality, enough  should be used to coagulate the milk _sufficiently_ in about forty  minutes. No salt is put _into_ the cheese, nor any on the outside during  the first six or eight hours it is pressed; but a thin coat of fine  Liverpool salt is kept on the outside during the remainder of the time  it remains in press. The cheeses are pressed forty-eight hours, under a  weight of seven or eight cwt. Nothing more is required but to turn the  cheeses once a day on the shelves.\"    \"The milk is strained in large tubs over night; the cream stirred in  milk, and in the morning strained in same tub; milk heated to natural  heat; add color and rennet; curd broke fine and whey off, and broke fine  in hoop with fast bottom, and put in strainer; pressed twelve hours;  then taken from hoop, and salt rubbed on the surface; then put in hoop,  without strainer, and pressed forty-eight hours; then put on tables, and  salt rubbed on surface, and remain in salt six days, for cheese weighing  thirty pounds. The hoops to have holes in the bottom; the crushings are  saved, and set, and churned, to grease the cheese. The above method is  for making one cheese per day. As in butter-making, the utmost  cleanliness is required in every part of the cheese-making premises.\"          CHAPTER IV.    SHEEP      With the exception of the dog, there is no one of the brute creation  which exhibits the diversity of size, color, form, covering, and general  appearance, which characterizes the sheep, and none which occupies a  wider range of climate, or subsists on a greater variety of food. In  every latitude between the equator and the arctic, he ranges over the  sterile mountains, and through the fertile valleys. He feeds on almost  every species of edible forage, the cultivated grasses, clovers, cereals  and roots; he browses on aromatic and bitter herbs; he crops the leaves  and bark from the stunted forest shrubs, and the pungent, resinous  evergreens. In some parts of Norway and Sweden, when other resources  fail, he subsists on fish or flesh during their long and rigorous  winters, and if reduced to necessity, he eats his own wool.    He is diminutive like the Orkney, or massive like the Teeswater. He is  policerate or many horned; he has two large or small spiral horns like  the Merino, or is polled or hornless like the mutton sheep. He has a  long tail like our own breeds; a broad tail, like many of the eastern;  or a mere button of a tail, like the fat-rumps, discernible only by the  touch. His coat is sometimes long and coarse, like the Lincolnshire;  short and hairy, like those of Madagascar; soft and furry, like the  Angola; or fine and spiral, like the silken Saxon."]]]
