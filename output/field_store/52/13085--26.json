The latter  is bent downwards at a right angle just above the blade, in a plane  perpendicular to that of the blade, and its other end is prolonged  by a short wooden handle, into the end of which it is thrust. The  woman stoops to the work, hoeing carefully round each PADI plant, by  holding the hoe in the right hand and striking the blade downwards and  towards her toes with a dragging action. In working over the patch in  this careful fashion some three weeks are consumed. In the intervals  the women gather the small crops of early PADI, pumpkin, cucumbers,  and so forth, spending several weeks together on the farm, sleeping  in the hut. In a good season this is the happiest time of the year;  both men and women take the keenest interest and pleasure in the  growth of the crop.    During the time when the grain is formed but not yet ripe, the people  live upon the green corn, which they prepare by gathering the heads and  beating them flat. These are not cooked, but merely dried in the sun,  and though they need much mastication they are considered a delicacy.    During the time of the ripening of the corn a spirit of gaiety and  joyful anticipation prevails. It is a favourite time for courtship,  and many marriages are arranged.    The harvest is the most important event of the year. Men, women, and  children, all take part. The rice-sparrows congregate in thousands as  the grain begins to ripen, and the noisy efforts of the people fail  to keep them at a distance. Therefore the people walk through the  crop gathering all ripe ears. The operation is performed with a small  rude knife-blade mounted in a wooden handle along its whole length  (Figs. 14, 15). This is held in the hollow of the right hand, the ends  of a short cross bar projecting between the first and second fingers  and between thumb and first finger. The thumb seizes and presses the  head of each blade of corn against the edge of the knife. The cars  thus cropped are thrown into a basket slung round the neck. As soon  as a large basket has been filled by the reapers, its contents are  spread out on mats on a platform before the hut. After an exposure of  two or three days, the grain is separated from the ears by stamping  upon them with bare feet. The separated grain passes through the  meshes of the coarse mat on to a finer mat beneath. The grain is then  further dried by exposure to the sun. When the whole crop has been  gathered, threshed, and dried in this way, it is transported in the  large shoulder baskets amid much rejoicing and merry-making to the  PADI barns adjoining the house, and the harvest festival begins.    The elaborate operations on the BADI FARM that we have described might  seem to a materialist to be sufficient to secure a good harvest;  but this is not the view taken by the Kayans, or any other of the  cultivators of Borneo. In their opinion all these material labours  would be of little avail if not supplemented at every stage by the  minute observance of a variety of rites. The PADI has life or soul,  or vitality, and is subject to sickness and to many vaguely conceived  influences, both good and bad.      Determination of the Seasons    The determination of the time for sowing the seed is a matter of so  great importance that in each village this duty is entrusted to a man  who makes it his profession to observe the signs of the seasons. This  work is so exacting that he is not expected to cultivate a crop of  PADI for himself and family, but is furnished with all the PADI he  needs by contributions from all the other members of the village.    It is essential to determine the approach of the short dry season, in  order that in the course of it the timber may be felled and burned. In  Borneo, lying as it does upon the equator, the revolution of the  year is marked by no very striking changes of weather, temperature,  or of vegetation. In fact, the only constant and striking evidences  of the passage of the months are the alternations of the north-east  and the south-west monsoons. The former blows from October to March,  the latter from April to September, the transitions being marked by  variable winds. The relatively dry season sets in with the south-west  monsoon, and lasts about two months; but in some years the rainfall  during this season is hardly less abundant than during the rest of  the year.    The \"clerk of the weather\" (he has no official title, though the  great importance of his function secures him general respect) has  no knowledge of the number of days in the year, and does not count  their passage. He is aware that the lunar month has twenty-eight  days, but he knows that the dry season does not recur after any  given number of completed months, and therefore keeps no record of  the lunar months. He relies almost entirely upon observation of the  slight changes of the sun's altitude. His observations are made by  the help of an instrument closely resembling the ancient Greek gnomon,  known as TUKAR DO or ASO DO (Pl. 60).    A straight cylindrical pole of hardwood is fixed vertically in the  ground; it is carefully adjusted with the aid of plumb lines, and  the possibility of its sinking deeper into the earth is prevented by  passing its lower end through a hole in a board laid horizontally on  the ground, its surface flush with the surface of the ground which  is carefully smoothed. The pole is provided with a shoulder which  rests upon this board. The upper end of the pole is generally carved  in the form of a human figure. The carving may be very elaborate,  or the figure may be indicated only by a few notches. The length of  the pole from the collar to its upper extremity is made equal to  the span from tip to tip of outstretched arms of its maker, plus  the length of his span from tip of the thumb to that of the first  finger. This pole (ASO DO) stands on a cleared space before or behind  the house, and is surrounded by a strong fence; the area within the  fence, some three or four yards in diameter, being made as level and  smooth as possible. The clerk of the weather has a neatly worked flat  stick, on which lengths are marked off by notches; these lengths are  measured by laying the stick along the radial side of the left arm,  the butt end against the anterior fold of the armpit. A notch is  then cut at each of the following positions: one notch about one  inch from the butt end, a second opposite the middle of the upper  arm, one opposite the elbow, one opposite the bend of the wrist,  one at the first interphalangeal joint, one at the finger-tip. The  other side of the rod bears a larger number of notches, of which the  most distal marks the greatest length of the mid-day shadow, the next  one the length of the mid-day shadow three days after it has begun  to shorten, the next the length of the shadow after three more days'  shortening, and so on. The mid-day shadow is, of course, the minimal  length reached in the course of the day, and the marks denoting the  changes in length of the shadow are arrived at, purely empirically,  by marking off the length of the mid-day shadow every three days.    The clerk of the weather measures the shadow of the pole at mid-day  whenever the sun is unclouded. As the shadow grows shorter after  reaching its maximal length, he observes it with special care, and  announces to the village that the time for preparing the land is near  at hand. When the shadow reaches the notch made opposite the middle  of the arm, the best time for sowing the grain is considered to have  arrived; the land is therefore cleared, and made ready before this time  arrives. Sowing at times when the shadow reaches other notches is held  to involve various disadvantages, such as liability to more than the  usual number of pests -- monkeys, insects, rats, or sparrows. In the  case of each successful harvest, the date of the sowing is recorded  by driving a peg of ironwood into the ground at the point denoting  the length of the mid-day shadow at that date. The weather prophet  has other marks and notches whose meaning is known only to himself;  his procedures are surrounded with mystery and kept something of  a secret, even from the chief as well as from all the rest of the  village, and his advice is always followed.    The method of observing the sun described above is universal among the  Kenyahs, but some of the Kayans practise a different method. A hole is  made in the roof of the weather-prophet's chamber in the long-house,  and the altitude of the mid-day sun and its direction, north or south  of the meridian, are observed by measuring along a plank fixed on  the floor the distance of the patch of sunlight (falling through the  hole on to the plank) from the point vertically below the hole. The  horizontal position of the plank is secured by placing upon it smooth  spherical stones and noting any inclination to roll. The sunbeam which  enters this hole is called KLEPUT TOH (=the blow-pipe of the spirit).    Some of the Klemantans practise a third method to determine when  the time for sowing is at hand, using a bamboo some feet in length  which bears a mark at a level which is empirically determined. The  bamboo is filled with water while in the vertical position. It is  then tilted till it points towards a certain star, when of course  some water escapes. After it has been restored to the vertical, the  level of the surface of the remaining water is noted. The coincidence  of this level with the mark mentioned above indicates that the time  for sowing is come.    The Sea Dayaks are guided by the observation of the position of  the Pleiades.    The appropriate season having been determined, it is necessary to  secure good omens before the preparation of the land can be begun. A  pig and a fowl having been sacrificed in the usual way, and their  blood sprinkled upon the wooden figures before the house,[46] two  men are sent out in a boat, and where"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3310"],[0,"A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A Contribution to the History of India (#19)"],[1," they used to import large numbers of horses,  principally for the use of the great contending armies in the Dakhan  and Vijayanagar. The Hindu king depended on this supply to a large  extent. In 1469 the Moors at Batecala (Bhatkal) having sold horses  to the \"Moors of Decan,\" the king of Vijayanagar ordered his vassal  at Onor (Honawar) \"to kill all those Moors as far as possible, and  frighten the rest away.\" The result of this was a terrible massacre, in  which 10,000 Musulmans lost their lives. The survivors fled and settled  themselves at Goa, thus founding the city that afterwards became  the capital of Portuguese India. Nuniz alludes to the loss of \"Goa,  Chaull, and Dabull\" by Vijayanagar in the reign of \"Verupaca.\"[155]  (Purchas states that the massacre took place in 1479 A.D.)    Shortly afterwards there arose to power under the Sultan Muhammad  one Yusuf Adil Khan, a slave, who before long grew to such power  that he overthrew the Bahmani dynasty, and became himself the first  independent sovereign of Bijapur -- the first \"Adil Shah.\" In 1470,  says the BURHAN-I MAASIR, the Sultan took Rajahmundry and Kondavid from  the king of Orissa. An inscription at Kondapalle, a fine hill-fort  beautifully situated on a range of hills, gives the date as 1470 or  1471; my copy is imperfect.    Firishtah tells us that --    \"In the year 877 (A.D. 1472 -- 73) Perkna, roy of the fortress of  Balgoan, at the instigation of the prince of Beejanuggur, marched  to retake the island of Goa.... Mahummud Shaw, immediately upon  intelligence of this irruption, collected his forces and moved against  Balgoan, a fortress of great strength, having round it a deep wet  ditch, and near it a pass, the only approach, defended by redoubts.\"    The attack ended in the reduction of the place, when the Sultan  returned to Kulbarga.    The BURHAN-I MAASIR CALLS the chief of Belgaum \"Parkatapah,\" and Major  King, the translator of the work, gives a large variety of spellings of  the name, viz.: \"Birkanah,\" \"Parkatabtah,\" \"Parkatiyah,\" \"Parkitah,\"  \"Barkabtah.\"[156] Briggs gives it as \"Birkana.\" It has been supposed  that the real name was Vikrama.    About the year 1475 there was a terrible famine in the Dakhan and  the country of the Telugus, which lasted for two years. At its close  the Hindu population of Kondapalle revolted, murdered the Muhammadan  governor, and invited aid from the king of Orissa. This monarch  accordingly advanced and laid siege to Rajahmundry, which was then  the governorship of Nizam-ul-Mulkh, but on the Shah marching in person  to the relief of the place the army of Orissa retired. In the latter  part of the year 882, which corresponds to March 1478 A.D., Muhammad  penetrated to the capital of Orissa, \"and used no mercy in slaughtering  the inhabitants and laying waste the country of the enemy.\" The Rajah  submitted, and purchased his immunity from further interference on  the part of the Sultan by a present of some valuable elephants.    Firishtah and the BURHAN-I MAASIR differ considerably as to what  followed. The former states that, after his raid into Orissa,  Muhammad Shah reduced Kondapalle, where he destroyed a temple,  slew the Brahman priests attached to it, and ordered a mosque to be  erected on its site. He remained nearly three years at Rajahmundry,  secured the Telingana country, expelled some refractory zamindars,  and \"resolved on the conquest of Nursing Raya.\"    \"Nursing,\" says Firishtah, \"was a powerful raja, possessing the country  between Carnatic[157] and Telingana, extending along the sea-coast,  to Matchiliputtum,[158] and had added much of the Beejanuggur territory  to his own by conquest, with several strong forts.\"    This was probably the powerful chief Narasimha Raya, a relation of  the king of Vijayanagar, who, intrusted with the government of large  tracts, was rising rapidly to independence under the weak and feeble  monarch whom he finally supplanted. The Sultan went to Kondapalle,[159]  and there was told that, at a distance of ten days' journey, \"was  the temple of Kunchy,[160] the walls and roof of which were plated  with gold, ornamented with precious stones;\" upon receipt of which  intelligence the Sultan is said to have made a forced march thither,  taking with him only 6000 cavalry, and to have sacked the place.    The account given by the BURHAN-I MAASIR as to Muhammad Shah's  proceedings at this period is that on going to Rajahmundry he found  there Narasimha Raya \"with 700,000 cursed infantry, and 500 elephants  like mountains of iron,\" who, in spite of all his pomp and power,  fled like a craven on the approach of the army of Islam. The Sultan  then reduced Rajahmundry, which had been held by a HINDU force --  not Muhammadan, as Firishtah declares. In November 1480[161] he  marched from Rajahmundry to Kondavid, going \"towards the kingdom  of Vijayanagar.\" After reducing that fortress, he proceeded after  a while to Malur, which belonged to Narasimha, \"who, owing to his  numerous army and the extent of his dominions, was the greatest and  most powerful of all the rulers of Telingana and Vijayanagar,\" and who  \"had established himself in the midst of the countries of Kanara and  Telingana, and taken possession of most of the districts of the coast  and interior of Vijayanagar.\"    While at Malur the Sultan was informed that \"at a distance of fifty  farsakhas from his camp was a city called Ganji,\" containing temples,  &c., to which he promptly marched, arriving before the place on 13th  March A.D. 1481.[162] He sacked the city and returned.    After this the Sultan went to Masulipatam, which he reduced, and thence  returned to Kondapalle. This was his last success. His cold-blooded  murder of the celebrated Mahmud Gawan, his loyal and faithful servant,  in 1481, so disgusted the nobles that in a short time the kingdom  was dismembered, the chiefs revolted, the dynasty was overthrown,  and five independent kingdoms were raised on its ruins.    Muhammad Shah died on 21st March. A.D. 1482. Shortly before his death  he planned an expedition to relieve Goa from a Vijayanagar army which  \"Sewaroy, Prince of Beejanuggur,\" had sent there (Firishtah); but  the Sultan's death put a stop to this (BURHAN-I MAASIR).    We have some further information on the affairs of Kulbarga during  the reign of Muhammad Shah in the writings of the Russian traveller  Athanasius Nikitin, but it is very difficult to fix the exact date  of his sojourn there. Nikitin was a native of Twer, and set out on  his wanderings by permission of the Grand Duke Michael Borissovitch,  and his own bishop, Gennadius. This fixes the time of his start so  far that it must have taken place subsequent to 1462, and the author  of the \"Bombay Gazetteer,\" RE Poonah, assigns the period 1468 to 1474  as that of Nikitin's stay in India.    Nikitin first went to Chaul, and thence travelled by land to Junir.    \"Here resides Asat, Khan of Indian Jooneer, a tributary of  Meliktuchar.... He has been fighting the Kofars for twenty years,  being sometimes beaten but mostly beating them.\"    By \"Meliktuchar\" is probably meant the celebrated minister Mahmud  Gawan, who in 1457 A.D. received the title \"Mallik-al-Tijar,\"  a title which was borne by the chief amongst the nobility at the  Bahmani court. It meant literally \"chief of the merchants.\" The  \"Kofars\" are, of course, the Kaffirs or Hindus. Firishtah tells us of  fighting having taken place in 1469 between the Mallik-al-Tijar and  \"the roles of Songeer, Khalneh, and rebels in Kokun,\" when the troops  of Junir were under the Mallik's command. During the war he captured  Goa, as already stated. There were campaigns also against the Hindus  of Rajahmundry, Vinukonda, and other places, and in 1472 one against  Belgaum, which has been already described. Firishtah tells us that the  Daulatabad and Junir troops were sent against the powerful Hindu Raja  Narasimha on the east coast.[163] As to Kulbarga and his experiences  there, Nikitin writes as follows: --    \"The Hindus ... are all naked and bare-footed. They carry a shield  in one hand and a sword in the other. Some of the servants are  armed with straight bows and arrows. Elephants are greatly used  in battle.... Large scythes are attached to the trunks and tusks  of the elephants, and the animals are clad in ornamental plates of  steel. They carry a citadel, and in the citadel twelve men in armour  with guns and arrows.... The land is overstocked with people; but those  in the country are very miserable, whilst the nobles are extremely  opulent and delight in luxury. They are wont to be carried on their  silver beds, preceded by some twenty chargers caparisoned in gold,  and followed by three hundred men on horseback and five hundred on  foot, and by horn-men, ten torch-bearers, and ten musicians.    \"There may be seen in the train of the Sultan about a thousand ordinary  horses in gold trappings, one hundred carrels with torch-bearers,  three hundred trumpeters, three hundred dancers.... The Sultan, riding  on a golden saddle, wears a habit embroidered with sapphires, and on  his pointed headdress a large diamond; he also carries a suit of gold  armour inlaid with sapphires, and three swords mounted in gold.... The  brother of the Sultan rides on a golden bed, the canopy of which is  covered with velvet and ornamented with precious stones.... Mahmud  sits on a golden bed, with a silken canopy to it and a golden top,  drawn by four horses in gilt harness. Around him are crowds of people,  and before him many singers and dancers....    \"Melikh Tuchar took two Indian Towns whose ships pirated on the Indian  Sea, captured seven princes with their treasures.... The town had  been besieged for two years by an army of two hundred thousand men,  a hundred elephants, and three hundred camels.[164] ...    \"Myza Mylk, Mek-Khan, and Farat Khan took three large cities, and  captured an immense quantity of precious stones, the whole of "]]]
