It may seem strange that a territorial arrangement which, unless  cemented by a confederacy, is condemned by the publicist as fatal to  national strength, should have formerly ensured to Italy, as it had  done to ancient Greece, no ordinary measure of those benefits which  national independence is supposed to secure. But it is still more  remarkable that the nationality prescribed by political empiricists  nowadays as a remedy for all her woes should be directly opposed to  the system under which she became the harbinger of European  improvement and civilisation. This subject, if followed out, would  lead to disquisitions, for which these pages are no place. Enough to  observe, that the centralisation which united these twenty-two  commonwealths under the papal sway, is still, after two centuries,  their standing grievance. A spirit of discontent now broods over that  district, although government is mildly administered, and taxation is  moderate for a land so productive. But twenty-two capitals have been  absorbed, and consequently humbled and empoverished. _Hinc illae  lacrymae!_ Yet theorists, sweeping away ancient landmarks, and  overstepping natural boundaries, would begin their speculative  ameliorations of the Ausonian peninsula by provincialising nine of her  ten remaining capitals; they would diffuse desolation, propagate  discontent, and call them nationality. The projects of union and  strength that tinge such day-dreams are met by a perhaps  insurmountable barrier, in the abundant local jealousies which have  survived the independence of multitudinous petty states, and which, as  in Spain, often amusingly startle strangers in that country.[16] When  an Italian talks with ardour of his _patria_, or devotes his energies  to illustrate its history or its heroes, he means not Dante's land,         \"Circled by sea and Alps, parted by Apennine,\"    but the village which gave him birth, or, at most, the province in  which he dwells. Such is the boasted and burning patriotism of Young  Italy, however her advocates may gloss over the fact.    [Footnote 16: This was written under Gregory XVI. Time will show how  far the more enlarged and generous policy essayed by his successor can  abate long and deeply rooted prejudices on the one hand, without  fostering undue expectations on the other. As yet (1850) the  experiment has signally failed.[*A]]    [Footnote *A: As we know, it succeeded ten years later.]    These are, however, matters belonging rather to speculation than to  history, and from which it is time to return. That we have not  unreasonably questioned the tendency of the old Italian democracies to  promote individual felicity, and the safety of personal rights, may be  presumed from the dictum of one whose prepossessions are all in their  favour. The views stated in the following passage in the main bear out  those observations we have hazarded, and illustrate the tendency of  republicanism, in its sternest forms, to pass under oligarchy or  despotism.    \"Our ancient republicans loved their institutions, not so much in  proportion to the amount of happiness and security which they afforded  to the mass, as to the share that each individual was allowed to take  in the sovereignty of the state. Liberty was for them rather an  essential element of life than a source of enjoyment. Public spirit  was the mainspring which determined all private exertion. Freedom they  understood to be the identification of every citizen with the state.  Hence patriotism gradually prevailed over liberty. Every one was  vitally interested in the advancement of his country's greatness and  power, endangered his life and property, sacrificed his domestic  comforts, and even submitted to vexatious and arbitrary laws, whenever  the safety of the republic seemed to require it. In their eagerness to  assert the supremacy of their native state, they acceded to the  concentration of power into one or a few hands, and gave rise to the  establishment of oligarchy and despotism. But those patricians and  tyrants still constituted the state, and although the sovereignty with  which they had been provisionally invested became, in their hands,  oppressive and permanent, yet those national governments were looked  upon with devotion and pride, as the emanation of popular will and the  depositaries of popular power.\"[17]    [Footnote 17: MARIOTTI'S _Italy_, II., p. 298, first edition.]          CHAPTER II         Origin of the Counts of Montefeltro, and of their       sovereignty in Urbino and the surrounding country--Their       early genealogy--Guido, Count of Urbino--Antonio, Count of       Urbino.      The first princely dynasty of Urbino affords examples of most of the  phases of mediaeval jurisdiction on which we have briefly touched in  our introductory remarks.    [Illustration: _Alinari_    VIEW OF URBINO]    From the mists of the dark ages which brooded over the mountains of  Central Italy, there emerged a race who gradually spread their paltry  highland holding over a broad and fair duchy. In the territories  earned by their good swords, and their faithful services to the  Church, it was their pride to foster the lessons of peace, until their  state became the cradle of science, of letters, and of art. The Counts  of Montefeltro, a fief long held by imperial grant, gradually  established the seigneury over the neighbouring town of Urbino, which  thenceforth gave them their title, and in the thirteenth century they  received investiture of it from the popes. Invited in 1371 by the  people of Cagli to supplant the usurping Ceccardi, and in 1384, by  those of Gubbio,[*18] to expel the tyrannical race of the  Gabrielli, they were soon recognised as Church-vassals in both.  Casteldurante, partially conquered from the Brancaleoni by Count  Guidantonio, was erected into a countship in his person by Martin V.  in 1433; and his son Federigo obtained by marriage the remaining fiefs  of that family, including S. Angelo in Vado, Mercatello, and Massa  Trabaria. Fossombrone was bought by the same Federigo in 1445, from  Malatesta of Pesaro. Mondaino, Tavoleta, Sassocorbaro, La Pergola, S.  Leo, Sant'Agata, and other townships, were wrested at intervals by the  Counts of Urbino from their hereditary foes the Malatesta. The ducal  house della Rovere owed to papal nepotism the rich endowments of  Sinigaglia and Mondavio in 1474, and those of Pesaro, Gradara, and  Novilara in 1513.

It contained seven episcopal cities, a number  of smaller towns, and some three or four hundred \"castles,\" by which  must be understood fortified villages, for in that land of  interminable contests, every hamlet became a stronghold. Penna da  Billi was the original capital of Montefeltro. S. Leo, in the same  wild and rugged district, was by nature one of the most impregnable  fortresses in Italy; yet we shall have to detail its capture by  surprise or treachery on three several occasions. Fano, with its  small circumjacent territory, though nearly in the middle of the  duchy, continued to hold directly of the Church.    The early lords of Montefeltro were raised to the rank of counts of  that fief by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa about 1160, a favour  which seems to have long borne fruits in their Ghibelline principles.  Their first investiture as Church-vassals was from Honorius III., in  1216, but it was not till towards the close of that century, that we  find them designated Counts of Urbino, a title which they used in  common with Montefeltro, until the dukedom of Urbino was conferred  upon Federigo in 1474.[19] On the death of his son, Duke Guidobaldo,  in 1508, the ecclesiastical investitures fell by failure of heirs  male; but the dynasty was revived in the person of Francesco Maria  della Rovere, who happened to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42622"],[0,"The Book of Christmas (#19)"],[1,"complaining bitterly of the manner in which he was \"used in the city,  and wandering into the country up and down from house to house, found  small comfort in any,\" asserts his determination not to be so repulsed:  \"Welcome or not welcome,\" says he, \"I am come.\" In a periodical  publication of that day entitled \"Mercurius Democritus, or a True and  Perfect Nocturnall, communicating many strange wonders out of the World  in the Moon, etc.,\" the public are encouraged to keep Christmas, and  promised better days. No. 37 contains some verses to that effect, of  which the following are the first two:--        \"Old Christmass now is come to town,         Though few do him regard;       He laughs to see them going down,         That have put down his Lord.        \"Cheer up, sad heart, crown Christmass bowls,         Banish dull grief and sorrow;       Though you want cloaths, you have rich souls,         The _sun_ may shine to-morrow.\"    And again in No. 38:--        \"A gallant crew, stir up the fire,         The other winter tale,       Welcome, Christmass, 'tis our desire         To give thee more spic'd ale.\"    On the return of the royal family to England, the court celebrations of  Christmas were revived both there and at the Inns of Court; and the Lord  of Misrule came again into office. We have allusions to the one and the  other in the writings of Pepys and of Evelyn. The nobles and wealthy  gentry, too, once more at their country-seats, took under their  protection such of the ancient observances as had survived the  persecution, and from time to time stole out of their hiding-places  under the encouragement of the new order of things. But in none of its  ancient haunts did the festival ever again recover its splendor of old.  The condition of Charles's exchequer, and the many charges upon  it,--arising as well out of the services of his adherents as from his  own dissolute life,--left him little chance of imitating the lavish  appointments of the court pageantries in the days of Elizabeth and  James; and the troubles out of which the nation had emerged had made  changes as well in the face of the country as in the condition and  character of society, alike opposed to anything like a general and  complete revival of the merry doings of yore. In the country, estates  had passed into new hands, and the immemorial ties between the ancient  families and the tenants of the soil had been rudely severed. Many of  the old establishments in which these celebrations had been most  zealously observed, were finally broken up; and friends who had met  together from childhood around the Christmas fire, and pledged each  other year by year in the wassail-bowl, were scattered by the chances of  war. But out of this disturbance of the old localities and disruption of  the ancient ties of the land, a result still more fatal to these old  observances had arisen, promoted besides by the dissipation of manners  which the restored monarch had introduced into the country. Men rooted  out from their ancestral possessions and looking to a licentious king  for compensation, became hangers-on about the court; and others who had  no such excuse, seduced by their example and enamoured of the gayeties  of the metropolis and the profligacies of Whitehall, abandoned the  shelter of the old trees beneath whose shade their fathers had fostered  the sanctities of life, and from \"country gentlemen\" became \"men about  town.\" The evils of this practice, at which we have before hinted as one  of those to which the decay of rural customs is mainly owing, began to  be early felt, and form the topic of frequent complaint and the subject  of many of the popular ballads of that day. The song of the \"Old and  Young Courtier\" was written for the purpose of contrasting the good old  manners with those of Charles's time; and the effects of the change upon  the Christmas hospitalities has due and particular notice therein. We  extract it from the Percy collection for our readers, as appropriate to  our subject and a sample of the ballads of the time:--    THE OLD AND YOUNG COURTIER.        An old song made by an aged old pate,      Of an old worshipful gentleman who had a greate estate,      That kept a brave old house at a bountifull rate,      And an old porter to relieve the poor at his gate;                  Like an old courtier of the Queen's,                  And the Queen's old courtier.        With an old lady, whose anger one word assuages;      They every quarter paid their old servants their wages,      And never knew what belong'd to coachmen, footmen, nor pages,      But kept twenty old fellows with blue coats and badges;                  Like an old courtier, etc.        With an old study fill'd full of learned old books,      With an old reverend chaplain,--you might know him by his looks,--      With an old buttery hatch worn quite off the hooks,      And an old kitchen, that maintained half-a-dozen old cooks;                  Like an old courtier, etc.        With an old hall, hung about with pikes, guns, and bows,      With old swords, and bucklers that had borne many shrewde blows,      And an old frize coat, to cover his worship's trunk hose,      And a cup of old sherry to comfort his copper nose;                  Like an old courtier, etc.        With a good old fashion, when Christmasse was come,      To call in all his old neighbours with bagpipe and drum,      With good chear enough to furnish every old room,      And old liquor able to make a cat speak, and man dumb;                  Like an old courtier, etc.        With an old falconer, huntsman, and a kennel of hounds,      That never hawked, nor hunted, but in his own grounds,      Who, like a wise man, kept himself within his own bounds,      And when he dyed gave every child a thousand good pounds;                  Like an old courtier, etc.        But to his eldest son his house and land he assign'd,      Charging him in his will to keep the old bountifull mind,      To be good to his old tenants, and to his neighbours be kind;      But in the ensuing ditty you shall hear how he was inclined;                  Like a young courtier, etc.        Like a flourishing young gallant, newly come to his land,      Who keeps a brace of painted madams at his command,      And takes up a thousand pound upon his father's land,      And gets drunk in a tavern, till he can neither go nor stand;                  Like a young courtier, etc.        With a new-fangled lady, that is dandy, nice, and spare,      Who never knew what belong'd to good housekeeping or care,      Who buys gaudy-color'd fans to play with wanton air,      And seven or eight different dressings of other women's hair;                  Like a young courtier, etc.        With a new-fashion'd hall, built where the old one stood,      Hung round with new pictures, that do the poor no good,      With a fine marble chimney, wherein burns neither coal nor wood,      And a new smooth shovelboard, whereon no victuals ne'er stood;                  Like a young courtier, etc.        With a new study, stuff'd full of pamphlets and plays,      And a new chaplain, that swears faster than he prays,      With a new buttery-hatch that opens once in four or five days,      And a new French cook, to devise fine kickshaws and toys;                 Like a young courtier, etc.        With a new fashion, when Christmasse is drawing on,      On a new journey to London straight we all must begone,      And leave none to keep house, but our new porter John,      Who relieves the poor with a thump on the back with a stone;                 Like a young courtier, etc.        With a new gentleman usher, whose carriage is compleat,      With a new coachman, footmen, and pages to carry up the meat,      With a waiting-gentlewoman, whose dressing is very neat,      Who when her lady has din'd, lets the servants not eat;                 Like a young courtier, etc.        With new titles of honour bought with his father's old gold,      For which sundry of his ancestors' old manors are sold;      And this is the course most of our new gallants hold,      Which makes that good housekeeping is now grown so cold,                Among the young courtiers of the King,                Or the King's young courtiers.    In a word, the old English feeling seemed nearly extinct for a time; and  the ancient customs which had connected themselves therewith, one by one  fell more or less into disuse. The chain of _universal_ sympathy and  _general_ observance, which had long kept the festival together in all  its parts, was broken; and the parts fell asunder, and were by degrees  lost or overlooked. Let no man say that this is scarcely worth  lamenting! Let none imagine that, in the decay of customs useless or  insignificant in themselves, there is little to regret! \"The  affections,\" says Sterne, \"when they are busy that way, will build their  structures, were it but on the paring of a nail;\" and there is no  practice of long observance and ancient veneration--whether among  nations or individuals--round which the affections have not in some  degree twined themselves, and which are not therefore useful as supports  and remembrancers to those affections. There are few of the consequences  springing from civil war more lamentable than the disturbance which it  gives to the social arrangements, were it but to the meanest of them. It  is impossible that customs long identified with the feelings should  perish without those feelings (though from their own eternal principle  they will ultimately revive and find new modes of action) suffering some  temporary injury. It was a beautiful assertion of Dr. Johnson that his  feelings would be outraged by seeing an old post rooted up from before  his door which he had been used to look at all his life,--even though it  might be an incumbrance there. How much more would he have grieved over  the removal of a village"]]]
