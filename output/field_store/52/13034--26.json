The papaw it was; a fruit all too  luscious and sweet, when fully ripe in the fall, for most tastes, but  appealing strongly to the omnivorous small boy. I suppose most of my  readers know its banana-like fruits, four or five inches long, green  outside, but filled with soft and sweet aromatic yellow pulp, punctuated  by several fat bean-like seeds.    [Illustration: The papaw in bloom]    But it is the very handsome and distinct little tree, with its decidedly  odd flowers, I would celebrate, rather than the fruits. This tree,  rather common to shady places in eastern America as far north as New  York, is worth much attention, and worth planting for its spreading  richness of foliage. The leaves are large, and seem to carry into the  cold North a hint of warmth and of luxuriant growth not common, by any  means--I know of only one other hardy tree, the cucumber magnolia, with  an approaching character. The arrangement of these handsome papaw leaves  on the branches, too, makes the complete mass of regularly shaped  greenery that is the special characteristic of this escape from the  tropics; and, since I have seen the real papaw of the West Indies in  full glory, I am more than ever glad for the handsomer tree that belongs  to the regions of cold and vigor.    [Illustration: Flowers of the papaw]    The form of our papaw, or _Asimina triloba_--the botanical name is  rather pleasing--is noticeable, and as characteristic as its leafage.  See these side branches, leaving the slender central stem with a  graceful up-curve, but almost at once swinging down, only to again curve  upward at the ends! Are they not graceful? Such branches as these point  nature's marvelous engineering, to appreciate which one needs only to  try to imagine a structure of equal grace and efficiency, made with any  material of the arts. How awkward and clumsy steel would be, or other  metal!    Along these swinging curved branches, as we see them in the April winds,  there appear hints of the leaf richness that is to come--but something  else as well. These darkest purple-red petals, almost black, as they  change from the green of their opening hue, make up the peculiar flowers  of the papaw. There is gold in the heart of the flower, not hid from the  bees, and there is much of interest for the seeker for spring knowledge  as well; though I advise him not to smell the flowers. Almost the exact  antithesis of the dogwood is the bloom of this tree; for, both starting  green when first unfolded from the buds, the papaw's flowers advance  through browns and yellows, dully mingled, to the deep vinous red of  maturity. The dogwood's final banner of white is unfolded through its  progress of greens, about the same time or a little later.    A pleasant and peculiar small tree is this papaw, not nearly so well  known or so highly esteemed as it ought to be.    Another tree with edible fruits--but here there will be a dispute,  perhaps!--is the persimmon. I mean the American persimmon, indissolubly  associated in our own Southland with the darky and the 'possum, but also  well distributed over Eastern North America as far north as Connecticut.  The botanical name of the genus is Diospyros, liberally translated as  \"fruit of the gods,\" or \"Jove's fruit.\" If his highness of Olympus was,  by any chance, well acquainted with our 'simmon just before frost, he  must have had a copper-lined mouth, to choose it as his peculiar fruit!    Making a moderate-sized tree of peculiar and pleasing form, its branches  twisting regardless of symmetry, the persimmon in Pennsylvania likes  the country roadsides, especially along loamy banks. Here it has  unequaled opportunity for hanging out its attractively colored fruits.  As one drives along in early fall, just before hard frost, these  fine-looking little tomato-like globes of orange and red are advertised  in the wind by the absence of the early dropping foliage. They look  luscious and tempting; indeed, they _are_ tempting! Past experience--you  need but one--had prepared me for this \"bunko\" fruit; but my friend  would not believe me, one day in early October--he must taste for  himself. Taste he did, and generously, for the first bite is pleasing,  and does not alarm, wherefore he had time, before his insulted nerves of  mouth and tongue gave full warning, to absorb two of the 'simmons. Whew!  What a face he made when the puckering juice got to work, and convinced  him that he had been sucking a disguised lump of alum. Choking and  gasping, he called for the water we were far from; and _he_ won't try an  unfrosted persimmon again!    My clerical friend who brought home the fairy tale about the red-bud,  or Judas-tree, might well have based his story on the American  persimmon, but for the fact that this puckery little globe, so brilliant  and so deceptive before frost, loses both its beauty and its astringency  when slightly frozen. Then its tender flesh is suave and delicious, and  old Jove might well choose it for his own.    [Illustration: The persimmon tree in fruiting time]    But the tree--that is a beauty all summer, with its shining leaves,  oblong, pointed and almost of the magnolia shape. It will grace any  situation, and is particularly one of the trees worth planting along  highways, to relieve the monotony of too many maples, ashes,  horse-chestnuts and the like, and to offer to the passer-by a tempting  fruit of which he will surely not partake too freely when it is most  attractive. I read that toward the Western limit of its range the  persimmon, in Louisiana, Eastern Kansas and the Indian Territory,  becomes another tree of the first magnitude, towering above a hundred  feet. This would be well worth seeing!    There is another persimmon in the South, introduced from Japan, the  fruits of which are sold on the fruit-stands of Philadelphia, Boston  and New York. This, the \"kaki\" of Japan, is a small but business-like  tree, not substantially hardy north of Georgia, which provides great  quantities of its beautiful fruits, rich in coloring and sweet to the  taste, and varying greatly in size and form in its different varieties.  These 'simmons do not need the touch of frost, nor do they ever attain  the fine, wild, high flavor of the frost-bitten Virginian fruits; the  tree that bears them has none of the irregular beauty of our native  persimmon, nor does it approach in size to that ornament of the  countryside.           *       *       *       *       *    And now, in closing these sketches, I become most keenly sensible of  their deficiencies. Purely random bits they are, coming from a busy man,  and possessing the one merit of frankness. Deeply interested in trees,  but lacking the time for continuous study, I have been turning my camera  and my eyes upon the growths about me, asking questions, mentally  recording what I could see, and, while thankful for the rest and the  pleasure of the pursuit, always sorry not to go more fully into proper  and scientific tree knowledge. At times my lack in this respect has made  me ashamed to have written at all upon trees; but with full gratitude to  the botanical explorers whose labors have made such superficial  observations as mine possible, I venture to send forth these sketches,  without pretension as to the statement of any new facts or features.    [Illustration: Berries of the spice-bush]    If anything I have here set down shall induce among those who have  looked and read with me from nature's open book the desire to go more  deeply into the fascinating tree lore that always awaits and inevitably  rewards the effort, I shall cry heartily, \"God-speed!\"          Index      Illustrations are indicated by a prefixed asterisk (*).

By means of the  expression, \"And this shall not be unto thee,\" she made him  understand that the day had not yet arrived, but that it would come,  when a woman, Bath-sheba, would play a disastrous part in his  life. Thus she manifested her gift of prophecy.    Not even Abigail was free from the feminine weakness of  coquetry. The words \"remember thine handmaid\" should never  have been uttered by her. As a married woman, she should not  have sought to direct the attention of a man to herself. (137) In the  women's Paradise she supervises the fifth of the seven divisions  into which it is divided, and her domain adjoins that of the wives  of the Patriarchs, Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Leah. (138)    Among the sons of David, Adonijah, the son of Haggith, must be  mentioned particularly, the pretender to the throne. The fifty men  whom he prepared to run before him had fitted themselves for the  place of heralds by cutting out their spleen and the flesh of the  soles of their feet. That Adonijah was not designated for the royal  dignity, was made manifest by the fact that the crown of David did  not fit him. This crown had the remarkable peculiarity of always  fitting the legitimate king of the house of David. (139)    Chileab was a son worthy of his mother Abigail. The meaning of  his name is \"like the father,\" which had been given him because of  his striking resemblance to David in appearance, a circumstance  that silenced the talk against David's all too hasty marriage with  the widow of Nabal. (140) Intellectually, too, Chileab testified to  David's paternity. In fact, he excelled his father in learning, as he  did even the teacher of David, Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan.  (141) On account of his piety he is one of the few who have  entered Paradise alive. (142)    Tamar cannot be called one of the children of David, because she  was born before her mother's conversion to Judaism.  Consequently, her relation to Amnon is not quite of the grave  nature it would have been, had they been sister and brother in the  strict sense of the terms.    To the immediate household of David belonged four hundred  young squires, the sons of women taken captive in battle. They  wore their hair in heathen fashion, and, sitting in golden chariots,  they formed the vanguard of the army, and terrified the enemy by  their appearance. (143)      HIS TOMB    When David was buried, Solomon put abundant treasures into his  tomb. Thirteen hundred years later the high priest Hyrcanus took a  thousand talents of the money secreted there to use it in preventing  the siege of Jerusalem by the Greek king Antiochus. King Herod  also abstracted great sums. But none of the marauders could  penetrate to the resting-place of the kings,--next to David his  successors were interred,--for it was sunk into the earth so  skillfully that it could not be found. (144)    Once on a time, a Moslem pasha visited the mausoleum, and as he  was looking through the window in it, a weapon of his ornamented  with diamonds and pearls dropped into the tomb. A Mohammedan  was lowered through the window to fetch the weapon. When he  was drawn up again, he was dead, and three other Mohammedans  who tried to enter in the same way met the fate of their comrade.  At the instigation of the kadi, the pasha informed the Rabbi of  Jerusalem that the Jews would be held responsible for the  restoration of the weapon. The Rabbi ordered a three days' fast, to  be spent in prayer. Then lots were cast to designate the messenger  who was to be charged with the perilous errand. The lot fell upon  the beadle of the synagogue, a pious and upright man. He secured  the weapon, and returned it to the pasha, who manifested his  gratitude by kindly treatment of the Jews thereafter. The beadle  later told his adventures in the tomb to the Hakam Bashi. When he  had descended, there suddenly appeared before him an old man of  dignified appearance, and handed him what he was seeking. (145)    Another miraculous tale concerning the tomb of David runs as  follows: A poor but very pious Jewish washerwoman was once  persuaded by the keeper of the tomb to enter it. Hardly was she  within, when the man nailed up the entrance, and ran to the kadi to  inform him that a Jewess had gone in. Incensed, the kadi hastened  to the spot, with the intention of having the woman burnt for her  presumptuousness. In her terror the poor creature had begun to  weep and implore God for help. Suddenly a flood of light  illumined the dark tomb, and a venerable old man took her by the  hand, and led her downward under the earth until she reached the  open. There he parted from her with the words: \"Hasten  homeward, and let none know that thou wert away from thy  house.\" The kadi had the tomb and its surroundings thoroughly  searched by his bailiffs, but not a trace of the woman could be  discovered, although the keeper again and again swore by the  Prophet that the woman had entered. Now the messengers whom  the kadi had sent to the house of the woman returned, and reported  they had found her washing busily, and greatly astonished at their  question, whether she had been at the tomb of David. The kadi  accordingly decided that for his false statements and his perjury,  the keeper must die the very death intended for the innocent  woman, and so he was burnt. The people of Jerusalem suspected a  miracle, but the woman did not divulge her secret until a few hours  before her death. She told her story, and then bequeathed her  possessions to the congregation, under the condition that a scholar  recite Kaddish for her on each anniversary of her death. (146)    SOLOMON PUNISHES JOAB    At the youthful age of twelve (1) Solomon succeeded his father  David as king. His real name was Jedidiah, the \"friend of God,\"  but it was superseded by the name Solomon on account of the  peace that prevailed throughout the realm during his reign. He  bore three other names besides: Ben, Jakeh, and Ithiel. He was  called Ben because he was the builder of the Temple; Jakeh,  because he was the ruler of the whole world; and Ithiel, because  God was with him. (2)    The rebellion Adonijah intended to lead against the future king  was suppressed during David's lifetime, by having Solomon  anointed in public. On that occasion Solomon rode upon a  remarkable she-mule, remarkable because she was not the product  of cross-breeding, but of a special act of creation. (3)    As soon as he ascended the throne, Solomon set about executing  the instructions his father had given him on his death-bed. The first  of them was the punishment of Joab. (4)    Notwithstanding all his excellent qualities, which fitted him to be  not only David's first general, but also the president of the  Academy, (5) Joab had committed great crimes, which had to be  atoned for. Beside the murder of Abner (6) and Amasa of which he  was guilty, he had incurred wrong against David himself. The  generals of the army suspected him of having had Uriah the Hittite  put out of the way for purposes of his own, whereupon he showed  them David's letter dooming Uriah. David might have forgiven  Joab, but he wanted him to expiate his sins in this world, so that he  might be exempt from punishment in the world to come. (7)    When Joab perceived that Solomon intended to have him  executed, he sought the protection of the Temple. He knew full  well that he could not save his life in this way, for the arm of  justice reaches beyond the doors of the sanctuary, to the altar of  God. What he wished was to be accorded a regular trial, and not  suffer death by the king's order. In the latter case he would lose  fortune as well as life, and he was desirous of leaving his children  well provided for. Thereupon Solomon sent word to him that he  had no intention of confiscating his estates. (8)    Though he was convinced of Joab's guilt, Solomon nevertheless  granted him the privilege of defense. The king questioned him:  \"Why didst thou kill Abner?\"    Joab: \"I was the avenger of my brother Asahel, whom Abner had  slain.\"    Solomon: \"Why, it was Asahel who sought to kill Abner, and  Abner acted in self-defense.\"    Joab: \"Abner might have disabled Asahel without going to  extremes.\"    Solomon: \"That Abner could not do.\"    Joab: \"What! Abner aimed directly at Asahel's fifth rib, and thou  wouldst say he could not have managed to wound him lightly?\"    Solomon: \"Very well, then, we shall drop Abner's case. But why  didst thou slay Amasa?\"    Joab: \"He acted rebelliously toward King David. He omitted to  execute his order to gather an army within three days; for that  offense he deserved to suffer the death penalty.\"    Solomon: \"Amasa failed to obey the king's order, because he had  been taught by our sages that even a king's injunctions may be set  at defiance if they involve neglect of the study of the Torah, which  was the case with the order given to Amasa. And, indeed,\"  continued Solomon, \"it was not Amasa but thou thyself who didst  rebel against the king, for thou wert about to join Absalom, and if  thou didst refrain, it was from fear of David's strong-fisted troops.\"  (9)    When Joab saw that death was inevitable, he said to Benaiah, who  was charged with the execution of the king's order: \"Tell Solomon  he cannot inflict two punishments upon me. If he expects to take  my life, he must remove the curse pronounced by David against  me and my descendants on account of the slaying of Abner. If not,  he cannot put me to death.\" Solomon realized the justness of the  plea. By executing Joab, he transferred David's curse to his own  posterity: Rehoboam, his son, was afflicted with an issue; Uzziah  suffered with leprosy; Asa had to lean on a "]]]
