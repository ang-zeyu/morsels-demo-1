She said the quarters were built in rows with streets  between them.    She also remembers the first boat she ever saw that was when she was  brought to Mobile after the surrender, and when she saw the boat she  said to her mother: \"Look at that house sitting on the water.\"    Ella said that there were three cooks at the big house, their names  being Hannah, Judy, and Charlotte, and the gardener's name was Uncle  John. Ella also said that one thing that she remembers so well about the  kitchen in the big house was a large dishpan, that had a partition in  the middle of it, one side you washed the dishes in, and the other side  was used for scalding them.    The slaves always had Saturdays to wash their clothes and do things for  themselves. Ella, not having lived among Negroes, does not know much  about their habits and customs, but she does remember seeing the big  white covered wagons that the slaves were carried in to be sold; and  remembers hearing talk of the \"Pattyrollers.\" She said when the slaves  were sold, they were put on a block, and that the man who were buying  would look in their mouths just like they did horses.    Ella said she was born in Greensboro, Alabama, but the plantation where  she later lived was on the Alabama river near Selma, Ala. She doesn't  know how many acres it comprised, or how many slaves that her master  owned. She remembers her madame made her stop calling her mother  \"mammy,\" and her father \"daddy.\" She said: \"You know, Miss, that the  white children now-a-days calls their parents 'mammy and daddy' like the  colored people used to. The children now do not respect their parents as  they should, and in fact everything is so different the truth done 'be  under the table.' You know, miss, I am telling the truth, because the  Bible says, 'Woe be unto the one that lies; Judgment is on the land.'    \"In those days people had to work to live, and they raised most  everything they used, such as cattle, hogs, cotton, and foodstuff. Then  the women spun the thread out of the cotton, and wove the cloth.\"    Ella helped her grandmother at the weaving by picking up the shuttles  for her. She said they generally used the cloth as it was woven. The  shoes were made on the place and were called red brogans.    As for the churches, the white folks had the brush arbor camp meetings,  where the people would go and camp in little cabins for weeks, so they  could attend the church. They had newspapers then, Ella said, \"but  'course they ain't like you have now, there warn't so many as there is  now.    \"You asked something, miss, about medicines. I don't remember much about  any medicine, because Mr. Calvin Norris was a doctor, and he always  treated us when we were sick. There was a Dr. Browder who 'tended the  plantation.\"    Ella is a bright colored, small woman, whose eyes are very keen. She  says that a short time ago she had some trouble with her eyes, and she  got something from the drug store to bathe them with, but it did not  help them. So she caught some pure rain water and \"anointed\" her eyes  with that, and now she can see to thread a needle. Her life has been  very colorful in many respects. She recalled as a small child, that,  during the war, a minie-ball came through a brick wall of the servant  house where they were living, but it fell without harming any of the  servants. She said when Wilson's raid was made on Selma, that the Yankee  men went through the houses just like dogs, taking whatever they wanted.    \"I 'members Mr. Parkman putting two sacks of money down in his big well,  and him getting it out with hooks after the Yankees left.\"    Later when she was brought to Mobile she worked for Judge Oliver Semmes  for twenty years. Judge Semmes was the son of Admiral Raphael Semmes,  and she said he was a blessed, good man. For the past fourteen years she  has been working for the Frank Lyons family of Mobile.    Ella lives in a double tenement house, having one room and a small  kitchen. The room is full of old furniture and odd things. On the mantle  is a lovely old china pitcher that once was owned by Judge Semmes and  which Ella prizes very much. The thing that puzzles Ella most among the  modern inventions, she said, are the aeroplanes, and the way ice is  made. She said:    \"Miss, we never had any ice way back yonder. We had nice, old, open  brick wells, and the water was just like ice. We would draw the water  and put around the milk and butter in the dairy. It's a mystery to me  how they make that ice, but, my goodness! I guess I need not worry my  head about things, because I am not here for long. All my family is dead  and gone now, and the only companion I have is this here little white  hen. Her name is Mary. You see, I bought her last year to kill for  Christmas, but I couldn't do it. She is so human; and you ought to see  the eggs she lays. I even have a few to sell sometimes. I just keeps  Mary in the room at night with me, and she is heaps of company for me.\"          Rufus Dirt          *Interview with Rufus Dirt*      --_Woodrow Hand, Birmingham, Alabama_    _RUFUS WOULD TALK A LOT FOR A DIME_    Foreword: This Negro, Rufus Dirt, was found on one of Birmingham's  busiest streets begging for coins. Because of his inability to read, he  was unable to give the number or location of his home. All he knew was  \"jes' som'ers on Southside, boss.\"    \"I'll drop a dime in your hat uncle if you'll stand here and talk to me  for a few minutes.\"    \"Sho' boss, iffen you wants, I'll talk all day fo' dat much money. I'se  been here fo' a long time an' I knows plenty to talk 'bout. What does  yo' want to know?\"    I explained my interest in slavery days and my search for ex-slaves, but  he began telling me before I had time to finish. His ability to talk had  somehow escaped what his age had done to his hair, which was sparse as  well as snowy white. His eyes were a glazy red. One hand and arm seemed  to be crippled, but the other waved around in the air as he talked and  finally settled on my shoulder.    \"Boss, I don' rightly know jes' how old I is. I was a driver (Negro boss  of other slaves) during slavery and I reckons I was about twenty  sompin'. I don' remember nothin' in particular that caused me to get dat  drivin' job, ceptin' hard work, but I knows dat I was proud of it 'cause  I didn' have to work so hard no mo'. An' den it sorta' made de other  niggers look up to me, an' you knows us niggers, boss. Nothin' makes us  happier dan' to strut in front of other niggers. Dere ain't nothin' much  to tell about. We jes' moved one crop atter de other till layin' by time  come and den we'd start in on de winter work. We done jes' 'bout de same  as all de other plantations.    \"My massa's name was Digby and we live at Tuscaloosa befo' de war. An'  'bout dat war, white folks. Dem was some scary times. De nigger women  was a-feared to breathe out loud come night an' in de day time, dey  didn't work much 'cause dey was allus lookin' fo' de Yankees. Dey didn'  come by so much 'cause atter de first few times. Dere wa'nt no reason to  come by. Dey had done et up ever'thing and toted off what dey didn' eat.  Dey tuk all Massa's stock, burned down de smokehouse atter dey tuk de  meat out, an' dey burned de barn, an' we'all think ever' time dat dey  goin' to burn de house down, but dey musta forgot to do dat.    \"When de war was finally over an' I was free, my family went to  Vicksburg, Mississippi where we made a livin' first one way an' den de  other. I don't know how long we stayed dere, but I was livin' in  Bummin'ham when dere wa'nt nothin' much here a'tall. I watched all de  big buildin's 'round here go up and I see'd dem build all de big plants  and I'se still watchin', but I still don' know how to tell folks where  places is, 'cause I don' know how to read numbers. I goes anywhere I  wants to go an' I don't ever get lost, but jes' de same, I can't tell  nobody where I am. I don' even know where we is standin' talking like  dis right now. An' boss, I ain't beggin' 'cause I'se too lazy to work.  I'se worked plenty in my time till I crippled dis arm in de mines and  befo' my eyes got so bad,\" and with a grace and gentleness that may be  called a characteristic of his generation, he added, \"I hope I'se told  you what you wants to know.\"    He had. I felt well repaid for the dime I had given him. As he walked  off down the street, I noticed for the first time the large crowd that  had gathered around us. Evidently slave tales carry more interest than  this writer realized.          Katherine Eppes          *Interview with Katherine Eppes*      --_Susie R.

I fool 'round de store a good long while  like I didn't have nothin' on my mind 'cept my 'bacco. I had a plenty on  my mind, 'cause as dark come I headed up de Cling Creek road towards dat  gal's house. When I got close to her house I seen her down at de fence  in front of de house. Soon as she glimpsed me, she 'tended like she was  lookin' for something dat wasn't dere. I knowed what she was lookin'  for, 'cause women has got their own 'culiar way of foolin' men; keepin'  them from knowin' what they are thinkin' 'bout. Dat gal knowed all de  time in dat little kinky head of hers dat I was goin' to see her dat  night. When I spoke to her she didn't 'pear to be de least bit  frightened or surprised.    \"Quick as a cat she climbed up and set down on top of de fence, while  from de other side I leaned against it, close by. Dere she was smilin'  just as shy and skittish as a squirrel. Us stayed right dere and talked  and talked 'bout everything we knowed 'bout and a heap we didn't know  'bout, 'til de big yellow moon stood straight up, befo' I said farewell  to her and begun makin' my way down de big road towards home.    \"I went on down de road whistling wid nothin' on my mind 'cept dat gal.  When I got 'bout a mile from home I seen a woman wid a basket on her  arm, a little piece ahead, comin' towards me. Just as I turnt to let her  pass I kinda raised my hand to my hat to speak. But bless your soul, I  ain't seen dat woman no more. I stopped and looked everywhere and dere  was nobody in dat road 'cept me. Well, dere you is. What does all dis  mean nohow? So de more I thought de more a 'culiar feelin' crept over my  body. Then I say: 'Here I is been lookin' for hants and spirits all my  life and I ain't never seen one befo' dis one.' By dis time dat 'culiar  feelin' had reached my foots and they got to movin' 'bout uneasy like.  Dis ain't gwine to do I said and wid dat I tore off down de road faster  than a wild hoss. White man, I believes I run de first hundred yards in  nearly no time and after dat I kinda picked up a bit. I begun to feel  dat I wasn't makin' as good time in de road as I ought to be makin' so I  cut 'cross de field towards a narrow strip of woods close to home. When  my foots hit de rough grass and corn stalks of de field they took holt  then and got to bird-working[2], smooth and nice like machinery. I  thought I heard something back of me, I glanced back to see what it was  and befo' I could git my head straight again I smacked head on into a  pine tree as big as I is. Well, my runnin' ceasted right dere, de big  yellow moon went dark, a breeze fanned my face, and then everything got  still.

After a while I tried to move and sho' 'nough I  was dere all right.    \"After de war de most of us slaves stayed on de plantation and worked  right on just like nothin' had happened. I lived with my mammy and daddy  a long time after I was grown. Old master and mistress died soon after  de war and then my family went to live wid young Master Mid on his  plantation on de other side of Saluda River.    \"When I got some over thirty years old I got married and then I left de  farm, moved lower down in Lexington County and went to work at a  sawmill. I worked in de sawmill business 'bout twenty-five years.  Rollin' big logs to de saw wid a kanthook ain't no easy job, but it was  better to do dat than nothin'. I made a pretty good livin' but didn't  save no money, 'cause money was scarce in them days, nobody was paid  much for their labor in them times.    \"Soon after I quit working in de sawmill business I moved to Columbia  and has been here every since. De white folks has been pretty good to me  here, 'cause I has had work most all de time. I has always been able to  pay my bills and support my family right good. I believes de reason of  dat is, I has never bothered nobody, and attended to my own little  business as best as I knowed. Even now, as old as I is, I can git work  from my white friends 'most all de time, dat's right.    \"Did I marry dat first gal what mammy fussed wid me 'bout? Listen at  dat.

DuPre, Spartanburg, S.C._    A colored woman who states she was about four years old during slavery  times, states she doesn't remember much about those days, except what  her mother told her. Her mother was a slave and was given to Bill Smith,  otherwise known as \"Big-eyed Smith\", and they used to live on his  plantation somewhere between Glenn Springs and Spartanburg. The actual  possession of her mother was 'vested in Mrs. Bill Smith, as the mother  was presented to Mrs. Smith by her father. Her mother's work was around  the house, such as cleaning house, washing, milking the cows etc.; but  she never had to do the cooking for the Smith family. The source states  that she and the other children of slaves used to play in the sand and  have a good time--just as all children do. Sometimes Mr. Smith would go  to whip her mother for some reason, but Mrs. Smith wouldn't let him do  so, for she told her husband that the woman belonged to her and she was  not going to have her whipped. However, she stated she does not remember  ever seeing Big Eyed Smith whipping any slave, for his wife would always  stop him. As a whole, she and her mother were treated very kindly,  though at times they did not have enough to eat. Mrs. Smith would always  tell her mother who was milking to give the children plenty of milk.  This woman was too young to remember anything about the Yankee soldiers  coming to their place, but one day a black man came by the house and  told her mother she was now free. She states her mother continued to  work for Mr. Smith after she was set free. She was sent to school where  she learned to read and write, but when she became older, she came to  Spartanburg to live, because it looked like in the country, no one could  get a doctor out there until he or she was about dead; so she wanted to  be in town where she could get a doctor when she got sick.
