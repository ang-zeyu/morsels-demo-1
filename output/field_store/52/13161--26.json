The Blue or Tom Tit so closely resembles the Great Tit in its habits,  that, with trifling exceptions, a description of one would be equally  applicable to the other. Though much smaller than his relative, the  Tom Tit is equally brave and pugnacious, and is even more quarrelsome,  for he will fight with birds of his own kind; and the Great Tit, if  obliged to contest with him the possession of a prize, retires from  the field. His food, too, consists principally of insects, but he is  also very partial to meat. This taste leads him much to the  neighbourhood of houses and other places where he can indulge his  carnivorous propensities. A dog-kennel, with its usual accompaniment  of carrion, is a favourite resort, and there are probably few  butchers' shops in country villages which he does not frequently  visit. A bit of bacon suspended from the branch of a tree is a great  attraction. He evinces little fear of man, and will hunt about the  trees in our gardens without seeming to notice the presence of a  stranger. He frequently pays visits, too, to roses trained against  cottages, and will occasionally flutter against the glass to secure a  spider or gnat that he has detected while passing. His power of  grasping is very great. I have seen him cling to the moulding of a  window for several minutes, without relinquishing his hold, though the  projecting surface was merely a smooth beading. All this while he was  engaged in tearing to pieces the cocoon which some caterpillar had  constructed in a crevice; and so intent was he on his occupation, that  he took no notice of the tenants of the room, though they were only a  few feet distant from him. He is more frequently seen on the ground  than either of the other species, and where it is the custom to throw  out crumbs and the scrapings of plates, for the benefit of little  birds, the Blue Tit rarely fails to present itself among Sparrows and  Redbreasts.    The Tom Tit builds its nest of moss, and lines it with hair, wool, and  feathers. This it places in a hole, either in a wall or tree, and is  at so great pains to combine comfort and security for its brood, that  it has been known to excavate, in a decayed stump, a chamber large  enough for its nest, and to carry away the chips in its beak to some  distant place, lest, we may suppose, they should betray its retreat.  More frequently, however, it selects a natural hollow, as, for  instance, the stump of a small tree in a hedge, of which all the inner  part is decayed; nor does it despise human appliances if they will  answer its purpose; a disused pump, a bottle, or a flower-pot, have  all been known to serve its turn. It lays seven or eight eggs, but a  nest containing eighteen is on record; and in defence of its family,  shows great courage. If a nest be molested, the bird, instead of  endeavouring to escape, retains its place and makes an unpleasant  hissing noise, and if this be not enough to deter the intruder, pecks  his fingers with great vigour. Hence it has received the popular name  of 'Billy Biter'. As a songster, it does not rank high: yet it has  some variety of notes, which it utters in short snatches, expressive  rather than musical, as if the bird were trying to talk rather than to  sing.        THE COLE TIT     PARUS ATER        Crown of the head, throat, and front of the neck black; cheeks      and nape white; upper parts grey; wings bluish grey, with two      white bands; under parts white, tinged with grey. Length four      inches and a half; breadth nearly eight. Eggs like the last.    This and the following species resemble each other so closely in size,  habits, general hue and note, that at a distance it is difficult to  distinguish them. There are, however, strong points of difference; the  head and neck of the present species being glossy black, with a patch  of pure white on the nape of the neck and on the cheeks, while the  head of the Marsh Tit is of a dull sooty black, without any admixture  of white, nor is there a white spot on the cheeks. The Cole Tit is in  many districts a common bird, inhabiting woods and hedgerows, and  feeding on insects, for which it hunts with unceasing activity among  the branches and twigs of trees. Its note is less varied than that of  the Blue Tit, but sweeter in tone. It builds its nest in the holes of  trees and walls, of moss, hair, and feathers, and lays six or seven  eggs.        THE MARSH TIT     PARUS PALUSTRIS        Forehead, crown, head, and nape black; upper parts grey; wings      dark grey, lighter at the edges; cheeks, throat, and breast      dull white. Dimensions and eggs as in the last.    As has been said, the Marsh Tit and Cole Tit are so much alike that it  requires a sharp eye to distinguish them at a distance. On a closer  inspection, however, the characters mentioned in the preceding  paragraph become apparent, and there can be no question that they are  distinct species. The Marsh Tit is a bird of common occurrence,  resident south of the Forth, being in some places less abundant, in  others more so than the Cole Tit, while in others, again, the two are  equally frequent. In those districts with which I am myself most  familiar, it is hard to say which kind preponderates. Though it freely  resorts to woods and plantations remote from water, it prefers,  according to Montagu, low, wet ground, where old willow-trees abound,  in the holes of which it often makes its nest. Its note, I have  already observed, is very like that of the Cole Tit, being less harsh  than that either of the Blue or Great Tit. The peculiar double note,  which I know no other way of describing than by comparing it to the  syllables '_if-he_', rapidly uttered, and repeated in imitation of a  sob, characterizes, in a more or less marked degree, the spring song  of all four. Another characteristic of the same species is, that all  the members of a brood appear to keep much together for several months  after they are fledged. At the approach of winter, they break up their  societies, and are for the most part solitary till the return of  spring. The Marsh Tit, like the Tom Tit, has been observed to enlarge  the hole which it has selected for its nest, and to carry the chips in  its bill to a distance, and it is equally courageous in defence of its  eggs and young.        THE CRESTED TIT     PARUS CRISTATUS        Feathers of the crown elongated and capable of being erected,      black, edged with white; cheeks and sides of the neck white;      throat, collar, and a streak across the temples black; all the      other upper parts reddish brown; lower parts white, faintly      tinged with red. Length four inches and three-quarters. Eggs      white spotted with blood-red.    'The Crested Tit', is a solitary retired species, inhabiting only  gloomy forests, particularly those which abound with evergreens. On  the European Continent it is found in Denmark, Sweden, Russia,  Switzerland, and some parts of France. In the large pine tracts in the  north of Scotland, it is said to be not uncommon, and it used to be  found also in the neighbourhood of Glasgow, but has been seldom  observed in England. Its food consists of insects, berries of the  juniper, and seeds of evergreens. It builds its nest in hollow trees,  or in the deserted nests of squirrels and crows, and lays as many as  eight eggs.        FAMILY PANURIDA      THE BEARDED TITMOUSE OR REEDLING     PANAsRUS BIARMICUS        Head bluish grey; between the bill and eye a tuft of pendant      black feathers prolonged into a pointed moustache; throat and      neck greyish white; breast and abdomen white, tinged with      yellow and pink; upper parts light orange-brown; wings      variegated with white, black, and red; tail long,      orange-brown, the outer feathers variegated with white and      black. In the _female_ the moustache is of the same colour as      the cheek, and the grey on the head is absent. Length six      inches. Eggs white, with a few wavy lines of dark red.    This pretty bird is of very local occurrence, being found in  considerable numbers in several marshy districts where reeds abound,  but in others being totally unknown. Their habits resemble those of  the true Tits, but instead of spending their lives in trees, they  confine themselves to the marshes, and are constantly employed in  running up and down the stems of the reeds, hunting for their food,  which consists of small molluscs (or water-snails) and the seeds of  the reeds. Like the Tits, too, they are sociable, always being  observed in pairs or families; not congregating like Sparrows for the  sake of mutual protection, but seemingly from the pure love of each  other's company. A writer in the _Magazine of Natural History_ gives  the following account of their habits:--'I was told that some of these  birds had been seen in a large piece of reeds below Barking Creek; and  being desirous of observing them in their haunts, I went, accompanied  by a person and a dog, to the above-named place, on a cold and windy  morning; the reed-cutters having commenced their operations, I was  fearful of deferring my visit, lest my game might be driven away.  Arrived on our ground, we traversed it some time without success, and  were about to leave it, when our attention was roused by the alarm-cry  of the bird. Looking up, we saw eight or ten of these beautiful  creatures on the wing, just topping the reeds over our heads,  uttering, in full chorus, their forcibly musical note, which resembles  the monosyllable _ping!_ pronounced first slow and single, then two or  three times in a more hurried manner, uttered in a clear and ringing,  though soft tone, which well corresponds with the beauty and delicacy  of the bird. Their flights were short and low, only sufficient to  clear the reeds, on the seedy tops of which they alight to feed,  hanging, like most of their tribe, with the head and back downwards.  After some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3810"],[0,"The Man-Eaters of Tsavo, and Other East African Adventures (#19)"],[1,"no inclination to explore  the gloomy depths of the interior, but thinking that there might  possibly still be a lioness or cub inside, I fired a shot or two into  the cavern through a hole in the roof. Save for a swarm of bats,  nothing came out; and after taking a photograph of the cave, I gladly  left the horrible spot, thankful that the savage and insatiable brutes  which once inhabited it were no longer at large.    Retracing my steps to the main ravine, I continued my journey along it.  After a little while I fancied I saw a hippo among some tall rushes  growing on the bank, and quickly signed to Mahina and Moota to stay  perfectly still. I then made a careful stalk, only to discover, after  all my trouble, that my eyes had deceived me and made me imagine a  black bank and a few rushes to be a living animal. We now left the bed  of the ravine, and advanced along the top. This turned out to be a good  move, for soon we heard the galloping of a herd of some animal or other  across our front. I rushed round a corner in the path a few yards  ahead, and crouching under the bushes saw a line of startled zebras  flying past. This was the first time I had seen these beautifully  marked animals in their wild state, so I selected the largest and  fired, and as I was quite close to them he dropped in his tracks  stone-dead. When I stood over the handsome creature I was positively  sorry for having killed him. Not so Moota, however, who rushed up in  ecstasy, and before I could stop him had cut his throat. This was done,  as he remarked, \"to make the meat lawful,\" for Moota was a devout  follower of the Prophet, and no true Mohammedan will eat the flesh of  any animal unless the throat has been cut at the proper place and the  blood allowed to flow. This custom has often caused me great annoyance,  for Mohammedan followers rush in so quickly when an animal is shot and  cut the head off so short that it is afterwards quite useless as a  trophy.    By the time the zebra was skinned, darkness was fast approaching, so we  selected a suitable tree in which to pass the night. Under it we built  a goodly fire, made some tea, and roasted a couple of quails which I  had shot early in the day and which proved simply delicious. We then  betook ourselves to the branches--at least, Mahina and I did; Moota was  afraid of nothing, and said he would sleep on the ground. He was not so  full of courage later on, however, for about midnight a great rhino  passed our way, winded us and snorted so loudly that Moota scrambled in  abject terror up our tree. He was as nimble as a monkey for all his  stoutness, and never ceased climbing until he was far above us. We both  laughed heartily at his extraordinary haste to get out of danger, and  Mahina chaffed him unmercifully.    The rest of the night passed without incident, and in the early  morning, while the boys were preparing breakfast, I strolled off  towards the rocky hills which I had seen from Tsavo, and which were now  only about half a mile distant. I kept a sharp look-out for game, but  came across nothing save here and there a paa and a few guinea-fowl,  until, just as I was about half-way round the hill, I saw a fine  leopard lying on a rocky ledge basking in the morning sun. But he was  too quick for me, and made off before I could get a shot; I had not  approached noiselessly enough, and a leopard is too wary a beast to be  caught napping. Unfortunately I had no more time at my disposal in  which to explore these hills, as I was anxious to resume work at Tsavo  as soon as possible; so after breakfast we packed up the zebra skin and  began to retrace our steps through the jungle. It was an intensely hot  day, and we were all very glad when at length we reached the home camp.    Most of my little trips of this sort, however, were made in a northerly  direction, towards the ever-interesting Athi or Sabaki rivers. After a  long and tiring walk through the jungle what a pleasure it was to lie  up in the friendly shelter of the rushes which line the banks, and  watch the animals come down to drink, all unconscious of my presence. I  took several photographs of scenes of this kind, but unfortunately many  of the negatives were spoiled. Often, too, on a brilliant moonlight  night have I sat on a rock out in the middle of the stream, near a  favourite drinking place, waiting for a shot at whatever fortune might  send my way. How exasperating it was, when the wind changed at the  critical moment, and gave me away to the rhino or other animal I had  sat there for hours patiently awaiting! Occasionally I would get  heartily tired of my weary vigil and would wade ashore through the warm  water, to make my bed in the soft sand regardless of the snap, snap of  the crocodiles which could plainly be heard from the deeper pools up  and down the river. At the time, being new to the country, I did not  realise the risks I ran; but later on--after my poor Wa Kamba follower  had been seized and dragged under, as I have already described--I  learned to be much more cautious.    The shortest way of reaching the Athi river from Tsavo was to strike  through the jungle in a north-westerly direction, and here there was  luckily a particularly well-defined rhino path which I always made use  of. I discovered it quite by accident on one occasion when I had asked  some guests, who were staying with me at Tsavo, to spend a night on the  banks of the river. As we were making our way slowly and painfully  through the dense jungle, I came across this well-trodden path, which  appeared to lead in the direction in which I wished to go, and as I  felt convinced that at any rate it would bring us to the river  somewhere, I followed it with confidence. Our progress was now easy,  and the track led through fairly open glades where traces of bush-buck  and water-buck were numerous; indeed once or twice we caught glimpses  of these animals as they bounded away to the shelter of the thicket,  warned by the sound of our approach. In the end, as I anticipated, the  old rhino path proved a true guide, for it struck the Athi at an ideal  spot for a camping ground, where some lofty trees close to the bank of  the river gave a most grateful and refreshing shade. We had a  delightful picnic, and my guests greatly enjoyed their night in the  open, although one of them got rather a bad fright from a rhino which  suddenly snorted close to our camp, evidently very annoyed at our  intrusion on his domain.    In the morning they went off as soon as it was light to try their luck  along the river, while I remained in camp to see to breakfast. After an  hour or more, however, they all returned, empty-handed but very hungry;  so when they had settled down to rest after a hearty meal, I thought I  would sally forth and see if I could not meet with better success. I  had gone only a short distance up the right bank of the river, when I  thought I observed a movement among the bushes ahead of me. On the  alert, I stopped instantly, and the next moment was rewarded by seeing  a splendid bush-buck advance from the water in a most stately manner. I  could only make out his head and neck above the undergrowth, but as he  was only some fifty yards off, I raised my rifle to my shoulder to  fire. This movement at once caught his eye, and for the fraction of a  second he stopped to gaze at me, thus giving me time to aim at where I  supposed his shoulder to be. When I fired, he disappeared so suddenly  and so completely that I felt sure that I had missed him, and that he  had made off through the bush. I therefore re-loaded, and advanced  carefully with the intention of following up his trail; but to my  unbounded delight I came upon the buck stretched out dead in his  tracks, with my bullet through his heart. I lost no time in getting  back to camp, the antelope swinging by his feet from a branch borne by  two sturdy coolies: and my unlucky friends were very much astonished  when they saw the fine bag I had secured in so short a time. The animal  was soon skinned and furnished us with a delicious roast for lunch; and  in the cool of the evening we made our way back to Tsavo without  further adventure.    Some little time after this, while one of these same friends (Mr. C.  Rawson) happened to be again at Tsavo, we were sitting after dark under  the verandah of my hut. I wanted something from my tent, and sent  Meeanh, my Indian chaukidar, to fetch it. He was going off in the dark  to do so, when I called him back and told him to take a lantern for  fear of snakes. This he did, and as soon as he got to the door of the  tent, which was only a dozen yards off, he called out frantically,  \"Are, Sahib, burra sanp hai!\" (\"Oh, Master, there is a big snake here!)    \"Where?\" I shouted.    \"Here by the bed,\" he cried, \"Bring the gun, quickly.\"    I seized the shot-gun, which I always kept handy, and rushed to the  tent, where, by the light of the lantern, I saw a great red snake,  about seven feet long, gazing at me from the side of my camp-bed. I  instantly fired at him, cutting him clean in half with the shot; the  tail part remained where it was, but the head half quickly wriggled off  and disappeared in the gloom of the tent. The trail of blood, however,  enabled us to track it, and we eventually found the snake, still full  of fight, under the edge of the ground-sheet. He made a last vicious  dart at one of the men who had run up, but was quickly given the happy  despatch by a blow on the head. Rawson now picked it up and brought it  to the light. He then put his foot on the back of its head and with a  stick forced open the jaws, when suddenly we saw two perfectly clear  jets of poison spurt out from the fangs. An Indian baboo (clerk), who  happened to be standing near, got the full benefit of this, and the  poor man was so panic-stricken that in a second he had torn off every  atom of his clothing. We were very much amused at this, as of course "]]]
