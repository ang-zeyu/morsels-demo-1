BOOT TOPS. Many of the compositions sold for the purpose of cleaning and  restoring the colour of boot tops, are not found to answer, and are  often injurious to the leather. A safe and easy preparation is made of a  quart of boiled milk, which, when cold, is to be mixed with an ounce of  the oil of vitriol, and an ounce of the spirit of salts, shaken well  together. An ounce of red lavender is then to be added, and the liquid  applied to the leather with a sponge. Or, mix a dram of oxymuriate of  potash with two ounces of distilled water; and when the salt is  dissolved, add two ounces of muriatic acid. Shake together in another  vial, three ounces of rectified spirits of wine, with half an ounce of  the essential oil of lemon, and unite the contents of the two vials,  keeping the liquid closely corked for use. It is to be applied with a  clean sponge, and dried gently; after which the tops may be polished  with a proper brush, so as to appear like new leather. This mixture will  readily take out grease, or any kind of spots, from leather or  parchment.      BOTTLES. The common practice of cleaning glass bottles with shot is  highly improper; for if through inattention any of it should remain,  when the bottles are again filled with wine or cider, the lead will be  dissolved, and the liquor impregnated with its pernicious qualities. A  few ounces of potash dissolved in water will answer the purpose much  better, and clean a great number of bottles. If any impurity adhere to  the sides, a few pieces of blotting paper put into the bottle, and  shaken with the water, will very soon remove it. Another way is to roll  up some pieces of blotting paper, steep them in soap and water, then put  them into bottles or decanters with a little warm water, and shake them  well for a few minutes: after this they will only require to be rinsed  and dried.      BOTTLING LIQUORS. Here the first thing to be attended to is, to see that  the bottles be perfectly clean and dry; if wet, they will spoil the  liquor, and make it turn mouldy. Then, though the bottles should be  clean and dry, yet if the corks be not new and sound, the liquor will be  damaged; for if the air can by any means penetrate, the liquor will grow  flat, and never rise. As soon as a cask of liquor begins to grow vapid,  and to lose its briskness, while it is on the tap, it should be drawn  off immediately into bottles; and in order to quicken it, put a piece of  loaf sugar into every bottle, about the size of a walnut. To forward the  ripening, wrap the bottles in hay, and set them in a warm place; straw  will not answer the purpose. When ale is to be bottled, it will be an  improvement to add a little rice, a few raisins, or a tea-spoonful of  moist sugar to each bottle. In the summer time, if table beer is bottled  as soon as it has done working, it will soon become brisk, and make a  very pleasant and refreshing drink.      BOTTLED CURRANTS. See that the bottles be perfectly clean and dry, and  let the fruit be gathered quite ripe, and when the weather is dry. The  currants should be cut from the large stalks, with the smallest bit of  stalk to each, and care taken not to wound the fruit, that none of the  moisture may escape. It would be best indeed to cut them under the  trees, and let them drop gently into the bottles. Stop up the bottles  with cork and rosin, and trench them in the garden with the neck  downwards: sticks should be placed opposite to where each sort of fruit  begins. Cherries and damsons may be kept in the same way.      BOTTLED GOOSEBERRIES. Pick some smooth gooseberries before they are  quite full grown, put them into gooseberry bottles lightly corked, and  set them up to their necks in a copper of cold water. Put a little hay  round the bottles to prevent their breaking, make a fire under them, and  let the heat increase gradually; let them simmer ten minutes, but not  boil. Take out the fire, and let them remain in the copper till cold.  Then take them out, dry the bottles, rosin down the corks close, and set  them in dry saw-dust with their necks downward.      BRAISING. To braise any kind of meat, put it into a stewpan, and cover  it with fat bacon. Then add six or eight onions, a bundle of herbs,  carrots, celery, any bones or trimmings of meat or fowls, and some  stock. The bacon must be covered with white paper, and the lid of the  pan must be kept close. Set it on a slow stove; and according to what  the meat is, it will require two or three hours. The meat is then to be  taken out, the gravy nicely skimmed, and set on to boil very quick till  it is thick. The meat is to be kept hot; and if larded, put into the  oven for a few minutes. Then put the jelly over it, which is called  glazing, and is used for ham, tongue, and various made-dishes. White  wine is added to some glazing. The glaze should be of beautiful clear  yellow brown, and it is best put on with a nice brush.      BRAISED CHICKENS. Bone them, and fill them with forcemeat. Lay the bones  and any other poultry trimmings into a stewpan, and the chickens on  them. Put to them a few onions, a handful of herbs, three blades of  mace, a pint of stock, and a glass or two of sherry. Cover the chickens  with slices of bacon, and then white paper; cover the whole close, and  put them on a slow stove for two hours. Then take them up, strain the  braise, and skim off the fat carefully: set it on to boil very quick to  a glaze, and lay it over the chicken with a brush. Before glazing, put  the chicken into an oven for a few minutes, to give it a colour. Serve  with a brown fricassee of mushrooms.      BRAISED MUTTON. Take off the chump end of a loin of mutton, cover it  with buttered paper, and then with paste, as for venison. Roast it two  hours, but let it not be browned. Have ready some French beans boiled,  and drained on a sieve; and while you are glazing the mutton, give the  beans one heat-up in gravy, and lay them on the dish with the meat over  them.      BRAISED VEAL. Lard the best end of a neck of veal with bacon rolled in  chopped parsley, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Put it into a tosser, and  cover it with water. Add the scrag end of the neck, a little lean bacon  or ham, an onion, two carrots, two heads of celery, and a glass of  Madeira. Stew it quickly for two hours, or till it is tender, but not  too much. Strain off the liquor: mix a little flour and butter in a  stewpan till brown, and lay the veal in this, the upperside to the  bottom of the pan. Let it be over the fire till it gets coloured: then  lay it into the dish, stir some of the liquor in and boil it up, skim  it nicely, and squeeze orange and lemon juice into it.      BRANDY CREAM. Boil two dozen of blanched almonds, and pounded bitter  almonds, in a little milk. When cold, add to it the yolks of five eggs  beating well in cream; sweeten, and put to it two glasses of good  brandy. After it is well mixed, pour to it a quart of thin cream; set it  over the fire, but not to boil. Stir it one way till it thickens, then  pour into cups or low glasses, and when cold it will be ready. A ratafia  drop may be added to each cup; and if intended to keep, the cream must  be previously scalded.      BRANDY PUDDING. Line a mould with jar-raisins stoned, or dried cherries,  then with thin slices of French roll; next to which put ratafias, or  macaroons; then the fruit, rolls and cakes in succession, till the mould  is full, sprinkling in at times two glasses of brandy. Beat four eggs,  add a pint of milk or cream lightly sweetened, half a nutmeg, and the  rind of half a lemon finely grated. Let the liquid sink into the solid  part; then flour a cloth, tie it tight over, and boil one hour; keep the  mould the right side up. Serve with pudding sauce.      BRASS. Culinary vessels made of this metal, are constantly in danger of  contracting verdigris. To prevent this, instead of wiping them dry in  the usual manner, let them be frequently immersed in water, and they  will be preserved safe and clean.      BRAWN. Young brawn is to be preferred, the horny part of which will feel  moderately tender, and the flavour will be better; the rind of old brawn  will be hard. For Mock Brawn, boil a pair of neat's feet very tender;  take the meat off, and have ready a belly-piece of salt pork, which has  been in pickle for a week. Boil this almost enough, take out the bones  if there be any, and roll the feet and the pork together. Bind it tight  together with a strong cloth and coarse tape, boil it quite tender, and  hang it up in the cloth till cold. Keep it afterwards in souse till it  is wanted.      BREAD. Two very important reasons urge the propriety and necessity of  using home-baked bread, in preference to baker's bread, wherever it can  be done with tolerable convenience; these are, its superior quality, and  its cheapness. A bushel of wheat, weighing sixty pounds, will make  sixty-five pounds of household bread, after the bran has been taken out;  and if the pollard be separated also, to make a finer article, a bushel  of ground wheat will then make fifty-eight pounds of fine white bread,  free from any foreign mixture, leaving from ten to fifteen pounds of  bran and pollard, which may be applied to useful purposes. The  calculation then will be easy, and the difference between purchasing and  making bread will be seen at once. A bushel of ground wheat weighing  sixty pounds will produce thirteen quartern loaves and a half of fine  bread, after the bran and pollard have been taken out; add to the price  of the wheat, nine-pence a bushel for grinding, three-pence for yeast,  four-pence for salt and the expence of baking; and from this deduct  six-pence at least for the value of the bran and pollard, and it gives  the price of the quartern"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29086"],[0,"The Mushroom, Edible and Otherwise (#19)"],[1,"end, 5-6x3-4u.    These plants grow among leaves in the woods after warm rains, growing in  tufts, sometimes in rows or lines. They are not as large as C.  dryophylla, the stem is quite different and the plants seem to have the  ability to revive like a Marasmius. They can be dried for winter use.      _Collybia myriadophylla. Pk._    MANY-LEAVED COLLYBIA.    [Illustration: Figure 85.--Collybia myriadophylla.]    Myriadophylla is from two Greek words, meaning many leaves. It has  reference to its numerous gills.    The pileus is very thin, broadly convex, then plane or centrally  depressed, sometimes umbillicate, hygrophanous, brown when moist,  ochraceous or tan-color when dry.    The gills are very numerous, narrow, linear, crowded, rounded behind or  slightly adnexed, brownish-lilac.    The stem is slender, but commonly short, equal, glabrous, stuffed or  hollow, reddish-brown. The spores are minute, broadly elliptical, .00012  to .00016-inch long, .0008-inch broad. _Peck_, 49th Rep.    I found only a few specimens in Haynes's Hollow. The caps were about an  inch broad and the stems were an inch and a half long. It will be easily  identified if one has the description of it, because of its peculiarly  colored gills. I found my plants on a decayed stump in August. In the  dried specimens the gills assume a more brownish-red hue, as in the next  following species.    Collybia colorea. Pk. They sometimes appear to have a glaucous  reflection, probably from the abundance of the spores. The stem is more  or less radicated and often slightly floccose-pruinose toward the base.  The basidia are very short, being only .0006 to .0008-inch long.      _Collybia atratoides. Pk._    THE BLACKISH COLLYBIA.    [Illustration: Figure 86.--Collybia atratoides. Two-thirds natural size.  Caps blackish to grayish-brown.]    Atratoides means like the species _atrata_, which means black; so called  because the caps when fresh are quite black. Atratoides has a different  habitat and is not so dark.    The pileus is thin, convex, subumbilicate, glabrous, hygrophanous,  blackish-brown when moist, grayish-brown and shining when dry.    The gills are rather broad, subdistant, adnate, grayish-white, often  transversely veiny above and venosely connected.    The stem is equal, hollow, smooth, grayish-brown with a whitish  mycelioid tomentum at the base. The spores are nearly globose, about  .0002-inch broad. The pileus is six to ten lines broad and the stem is  about one inch long. _Peck._    The plant is gregarious, growing on decayed wood and on mossy sticks in  mixed woods. The margin of the cap is often serrated, as you will see in  Figure 86, yet this does not seem to be a constant characteristic of the  species. It is closely related to C. atrata, but its habitat and the  color of its pileus and gills differ very greatly. I have not eaten it,  but have no doubt of its good qualities.    Found in August and September. Quite common in all our woods.      _Collybia acervata. Fr._    THE TUFTED COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 87.--Collybia acervata. Two-thirds natural size.  Caps pale, tan or dingy pink.]    Acervata, from acervus, a mass, a heap.    Pileus fleshy but thin, convex, or nearly plane, obtuse, glabrous,  hygrophanous, pale, tan-color or dingy pinkish-red, and commonly striate  on the margin when moist, paler or whitish when dry.    Gills narrow, close, adnexed or free, whitish or tinged with  flesh-color.    The stem slender, rigid, hollow, glabrous, reddish, reddish-brown or  brown, often whitish at the top, especially when young, commonly with a  matted down at the base. Spores elliptical, 6x3-4u.    The plant is cespitose. Pileus one-half inch broad. Stem two to three  inches long. _Peck's_ 49th Report.    This is a beautiful plant when growing in large tufts. The entire plant  is tender and has a delicate flavor. I found the plant figured here on  the Frankfort pike where an old saw mill had formerly stood. It grew  abundantly there, along with Lepiota Americana and Pluteus cervinus.    Found from August to October.      _Collybia velutipes. Curtis._    THE VELVET-FOOT COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._    Plate XV. Figure 88.--Collybia velutipes.    Natural size, showing the velvet stems, which give name to the  species.]    Velutipes, from _vellum_, velvet and _pes_, foot.    Pileus from one to four inches broad, tawny yellow, fleshy at the  center, thick on the margin, quite sticky or viscid when moist, margin  slightly striate, sometimes inclined to be excentric.    Gills rounded behind, broad, slightly adnexed, tan or pale-yellow,  somewhat distant.    The stem is cartilaginous, tough, hollow, umber, then becoming blackish,  with a velvety coat. Spores are elliptical, 7x3-3.5u.    It grows on stumps, logs and roots, in the ground. It grows almost the  year round. I have gathered it to eat in February. Plate XV gives a very  correct notion of the plant. It is most plentiful in September, October  and November, yet found throughout the winter months.      _Mycena. Fr._    Mycena is from a Greek word, meaning a fungus. The plants of this genus  are small and rather fragile.    Pileus more or less membranaceous, generally striate, with the margin  almost straight, and at first pressed to the stem, never involute,  expanded, campanulate, and generally umbonate.    The stem is externally cartilaginous, hollow, not stuffed when young,  confluent with the cap. Gills never decurrent, though some species have  a broad sinus near the stem.    Most species are small and inodorous, but some which have a strong  alkaline odor are probably not good. Some are known to be edible.    A few species exude a colored or watery juice when bruised. The Mycena  resembles the Collybia, but never has the incurved margin of the latter.  The plants are usually smaller, and the caps are more or less conical.    This genus might be mistaken for Omphalia, in which the gills are but  slightly decurrent, but in Omphalia the cap is umbilicate while in  Mycena it is umbonate.    Their being so small makes the determination of species somewhat  difficult. Some have characteristic odors which greatly assist in  establishing their identity.      _Mycena galericulata. Scop._    THE SMALL PEAKED-CAP MYCENA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Plate XVI. Figure 89.--Mycena galericulata.    Natural size.]    Galericulata, a small peaked-cap.    The pileus is campanulate, whitish or grayish, center of the disk darker  and lighter toward the margin, smooth, dry, margin striated nearly to  the peak of the umbo, sometimes slightly depressed.    The gills are adnate with a tooth, connected by veins, whitish, then  gray, often flesh color, rather distant, ventricose, edge sometimes  entire, sometimes serrate.    The stem is rigid, cartilaginous, hollow, tough, straight, polished,  smooth, hairy at the base.    It grows on logs and stumps in the woods. It is very common and  sometimes found in abundance. The plants are frequently densely  clustered, the numerous stems matted together by a soft hairy down at  the base. There are many forms of this plant. Found from September to  frost. The plants in Figure 89 were photographed by Prof. G. D. Smith,  Akron, O.      _Mycena rugosa. Fr._    THE WRINKLED MYCENA. EDIBLE.    Rugosa means wrinkled. The pileus is somewhat fleshy, darker and smaller  than the galericulata, quite tough, bell-shaped, then expanded, with  unequal elevated wrinkles, always dry, striate on the margin.    The gills are adnate, with a tooth, united behind, connected by veins,  somewhat distant, whitish, then gray, edge sometimes entire, sometimes  serrate.    The stem is short, tough, rooted with a hairy base, strongly  cartilaginous, hollow, rigid, smooth. It is found on stumps or decayed  logs during September and October.      _Mycena prolifera. Sow._    THE PROLIFEROUS MYCENA. EDIBLE.    Prolifera is from _proles_, offspring, and _fero_, to bear. The pileus  is somewhat fleshy, campanulate, then expanded, dry, with a broad, dark  umbo; margin at length sulcate or furrowed and sometimes split,  pale-yellowish or becoming brownish-tan.    The gills are adnexed, subdistant, white, then pallid.    The stem is firm, rigid, smooth, shining, minutely striate, rooting.  _Fries._    This species, as well as M. galericulata, is closely related to M.  cohaerens. I have found it in dense tufts or clusters, sometimes on  lawns, on the bare ground, and in the woods. It is one of the plants in  which the stems may be cooked with the caps.      _Mycena capillaris. Schum._    Capillaris means hair-like. This is a very small but beautiful white  plant.    The pileus is bell-shaped, at length umbilicate, smooth.    The gills are attached to the stem, ascending, rather distant.    The stem is thread-like, smooth, short.    The spores are 7-8x4. _Fries._    These plants are very small and easily overlooked. They grow on leaves  in the woods after a rain. July and August. Quite common.      _Mycena setosa. Sow._    Setosa means full of setae or hairs.    The pileus is very delicate, hemispherical, obtuse, smooth.    The gills are distant, white, almost free.    The stem is short, slender, and covered with spreading hairs which gives  rise to its specific name.    Commonly found on dead leaves in the woods after a rain. Found in July  and August.      _Mycena haematopa. Pers._    THE BLOOD-FOOT MYCENA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 90.--Mycena haematopa. Brownish-red or flesh-color.  A dull red juice exudes from the stem. Margin dentate by sterile flap.]    Haematopa is from two Greek words, meaning blood and foot.    The pileus is fleshy, one inch broad, conic, or bell-shaped, somewhat  umbonate, obtuse, whitish to flesh-color, with more or less dull red,  even, or slightly striate at the margin, the margin extending beyond the  gills and is toothed.    The gills are attached to the stem, often with a decurrent tooth,  whitish."]]]
