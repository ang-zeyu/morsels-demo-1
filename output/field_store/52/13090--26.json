You dare not call your soul your own;  for you are always drunk. Bah!\" She made as if to draw herself from  beyond his touch. He did not stir, but a frightful whiteness extended  over his hands and face.    \"Go on,\" he said metallically.    With a refinement of insolence difficult to describe, ignoring his  person, she looked _through_ him, and with a gesture ordered the music  to begin again.    Harland stood motionless for a moment. Immovable, he fixed his gray eyes  upon a little black square of court-plaster under the lobe of her left  ear. The music crashed through the banquet-hall. The dancing-girl tried  to distract the man of stone. He looked at that little black patch. Its  wearer shrugged her shoulders significantly; then, as if wearied of the  thought of him, she moved her white arm to the table and took up a glass  flaming with champagne; waving it towards him she said malevolently:    \"There! That's what you are waiting for. Drink and go!--Sot!\" The  viciousness of the act and word served as the key to the situation. Like  rusting steel, Harland became unlocked. Oddly enough, at this crisis it  occurred to him to question whether this were his old friend at all.  Then who? Then what? Was the woman an embodiment of all the past evil of  his own soul? By some horrible law of metempsychosis had his old spirit  passed into this too fashionable married flirt at his side? That  outstretched, mocking hand--was it what the abstainers called the \"demon  of drink?\" How often he had laughed at the phrase, lighting his  cigarette with their tracts!    At the fearful import of these thoughts, he felt himself endowed by a  bidding higher than fate. Justice arose and compelled him. His eyes  brightened before he did the deed. With a sweep, he shattered the hand  that held the slender glass, and snatching up a silver knife from the  table he poised it for an instant: then buried it to the hilt.    It struck just below her left ear. It obliterated the little black  patch. With a sound more like a hiss than a cry the woman drooped to her  divan. The music stopped with a frightened crash. The dancing-girl fled  with a shriek; but Harland stood immovable, exultant, holding his hands  ready to strangle if the wound did not kill. His face, but now so weak,  had acquired an inexorable strength. Strange! At this moment he felt  himself not a murderer, but a man.    He watched his victim dying, without a word; and when her curse was  spent, he turned and walked triumphantly back through the wasted  magnificence to the room from whence he had come.    He did not hurry. At first, he did not apprehend arrest. He felt as if  he had accomplished a great deed. Without looking back he closed the  door and sought for his hat. He put it on and made for the outer  entrance. He tried it and found it locked.    Now at last he began to comprehend his situation. Terror fell upon him.  Cold drops bathed him. The enormity of his act flashed upon his  conscience. _Kill!_ Kill a _woman_? He struggled at the window and the  door. Both were impervious. He dared not go back. How could he look at  her? Escape was cut off. His head became clotted with the old  sensations. Fear, such as makes a man's heart stand still, assailed him.  He looked in vain for the flask. It was gone. With a loud cry, he flung  himself upon the sofa and fainted dead away.    How long he lay there of course he did not know. Soon, vague  cerebrations began to torture his mind. It burned as if it were being  recalled to life from a frozen state. Then, soaring upward from deeps  beyond the deeps, supported through irremediable turmoil by an  overwhelming power, he felt himself gently laid upon a couch. There was  a moment when the brain, recovering its equilibrium, swam and spun. Then  suddenly he found consciousness and emerged through the mist of pain. He  tried to use his limbs, but could not rise. With an effort he strove to  loosen his tongue, but could not speak. With desperate will he  endeavored to open his eyes. Their lids were riveted together. This was  no hallucination. He was never more alert nor more helpless.    He knew that some one was bending over him.    He felt two eyes examining his soul. He had the consciousness that there  was nothing hid from this intense gaze. Then a commanding voice spoke  to him, and a hand of unutterable persuasion touched his forehead.    \"Harland Slack!\" said the ringing voice. Beginning a little above a  whisper it seemed to increase to oratorical tones: then it reverberated  throughout his nature, and burst upon him like the rattle of thunder.  \"Harland Slack, you have had a terrible lesson. Harland Slack, you will  not drink again!\" Then after a pause in a different voice, \"Now, Slack  get up! You're all right now. Come!\"    With a mighty wrench Harland, at his bidding, cast off the numbness from  his body, the incubus from his will, and staggering to his feet opened  his eyes.    Before him stood Dr. Alaric Randolph holding his hand and looking  searchingly into his face.    This fact recalled to him his awful deed. He understood perfectly that  he had committed a murder. He knew not how, or why, or where. With a  tremulous look about him he burst into tears and clung for protection to  his enigmatical host.    As tenderly as a hospital nurse Dr. Randolph led the criminal to a deep  chair and placed him in it.    \"There, there, old fellow. It's all right. You will come out of it all  straight. I'll see you through. Trust me. There, take my hand. That will  help you, see?\"    The broken man, shuddering from weakness, clasped the sympathetic hand  and wrung it. Harland sat still a long while with closed eyes. The  doctor watched him professionally, even tenderly, at times anxiously.    \"Now,\" he said, \"I'll go and bring you a _demitasse_. It will set you on  your feet.\"    \"No, no!\" cried Harland in terror, \"don't leave me. I can't be left  alone.\"    \"But only to the next room.\"    The patient's hands relaxed, and he assented wearily. When the coffee  came, he drank a little obediently.    \"Now, my boy,\" said the Doctor, with what under the circumstances seemed  to Harland a ghastly cheerfulness, \"this will get you up entirely. When  you finish it, I am going to send you to the Club!\" At the mention of  the Club Harland began to tremble.    \"My God, Randolph! I can't go there. I'll be arrested.\" He glanced  apprehensively at the outer door as if expecting a policeman. \"Don't you  know,\" he added in a whisper, \"what I've done in your infernal place?\"    \"Nonsense!\" replied Randolph lightly, \"not a soul shall know you've been  here. She deserved it. I'll take all the blame. Now brace up and be a  man. Don't be nervous. You're feverish. You need a tonic before you  start. What'll you drink?\"    Harland looked at his host in a state divided between dementia and moral  nausea. What manner of man was this American Doctor with his accursed  Parisian education?    \"I am horribly thirsty,\" he admitted: \"I will take a glass of water,  thank you.\"    He said this without surprise at himself, naturally and quite sincerely.  He longed for it. It was the first request of the kind he had made for  years. Randolph handed the water to him and watched him narrowly.  Harland held up the glass to the light with a connoisseur's eye, smiled  with satisfaction, and took the clear draught down at one swallow.    \"Ah!\" he said: \"that is good. I feel better now. Now swear that you will  save me. Don't give me up. Hide me somehow. It happened in your house,  you know.\"    \"Give yourself no concern,\" said the Doctor easily.    \"Why, man,\" blazed Harland Slack, \"don't you know that I've murdered  somebody? It was a woman. I've murdered that woman you keep here. I am  a murderer.\"    \"Your Club is only two blocks off,\" answered the physician with  astonishing indifference; \"It will do you good to walk there. Trust me.  Don't worry over it. Let me feel your hand. It's moist and soft. No  fever; that's good. When you step foot into the Club you will never  think of the affair again.\"    The Doctor quietly gave the criminal his hat and coat, put a cane into  his hand, and conducted him to the door.    \"Go!\" he said, \"go directly to your Club as usual. As a physician I  order it. It is the best thing you can do.\"    Mutely the trembling man obeyed, and thus the two actors in this awful  evening parted; so, perhaps, criminal and accomplice are wont to part in  the extremity of great emergencies, as if nothing had happened out of  the moral order of things.    Harland Slack walked into his fashionable Club slowly. As he did so,  whether by reason of the familiar atmosphere, or the contrast to the  scene from which he had escaped, he did not stop to consider, his crime  dropped from his memory like the burden from Christian's back. He handed  his outer garments to the liveried boy, and, as was his wont, turned  towards the poker and billiard rooms. There were the usual number of  useless gambling and playing men uselessly drinking. Harland Slack was  greeted in the usual boisterous manner.    \"Hilloa! What'll you take? Here, boy, bring the same old stuff to Mr.  Slack.\"    The gossip proceeded, the chips rattled, the balls clicked, the smoke  mounted, the liquors gurgled, and the regular Club life proceeded.    The friend of his appointment now joined him.    \"By ----! You look as white as that foam there. You need a nerve  restorer. You haven't been idiot enough to buck the tiger again, have  you? What will you take?\"    \"No,\" said Harland slowly. \"I have not gambled.\" He shook his head with  a strange expression. He did not understand. The Club seemed different  to him. It was not as entrancing or as necessary as usual. The odor of  stale liquor and of staler tobacco nauseated him. Still, it did not  occur to him that this was an unusual state of mind for him to be in.    The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33687"],[0,"Illustrative Anecdotes of the Animal Kingdom (#19)"],[1,"residing a  few miles from London, in Surrey, was roused in the middle of the night  by the intelligence that the premises adjoining his house of business  were on fire. The removal of his furniture and papers, of course,  immediately called his attention; yet, notwithstanding this, and the  bustle that is ever incident to a fire, his eye every now and then  rested on a dog, whom, during the progress of the devouring element, he  could not help noticing, running about, and apparently taking a deep  interest in what was going on--contriving to keep himself out of every  body's way, and yet always present amidst the thickest of the stir.    When the fire was got under, and the gentleman had leisure to look  about him, he again observed the dog, who, with the firemen, appeared  to be resting from the fatigues of duty, and was led to make inquiries  respecting him. Stooping down, and patting the animal, he addressed a  fireman near him, and asked him if the dog were his.    \"No, sir,\" replied the man, \"he does not belong to me, nor to any one  in particular. We call him the firemen's dog.\"    \"The firemen's dog? Why so? Has he no master?\"    \"No, sir; he calls none of us master, though we are all of us willing  to give him a night's lodging, and a pennyworth of meat; but he won't  stay long with any of us. His delight is to be at all the fires of  London, and, far or near, we generally find him on the road as we are  going along; and sometimes, if it is out of town, we give him a lift. I  don't think that there has been a fire for these two or three years  past which he has not been at.\"    Three years after this conversation, the same gentleman was again  called up in the night to a fire in the village where he resided, and,  to his surprise, he again met \"the firemen's dog,\" still alive and  well, pursuing, with the same apparent interest and satisfaction, the  exhibition of that which generally brings with it ruin and loss of  life. Still he called no man master, disdained to receive bed or board  from the same hand more than a night or two at a time, nor could the  firemen trace out his ordinary resting-place.    To this long list, we might add many other anecdotes, in evidence of  the varied powers of the canine family. We have endeavored to select  those only which are well authenticated. Some of these are sufficiently  marvellous, but there are many other well-attested accounts equally  wonderful. Mr. Hogg seems to imagine that mankind are prepared to  believe any thing in respect to dogs which partakes of the mysterious,  and accordingly plays off the following quiet joke upon his readers:--    \"It's a good sign of a dog when his face grows like his master's. It's  proof he's aye glow'ring up in his master's e'en to discover what he's  thinking on; and then, without the word or wave of command, to be aff  to execute the wull o' his silent thocht, whether it be to wean sheep,  or to run doon deer. Hector got so like me, afore he dee'd, that I  remember, when I was owre lazy to gang to the kirk, I used to send him  to take my place in the pew, and the minister never kent the  difference. Indeed, he once asked me next day what I thocht of the  sermon; for he saw me wonderfu' attentive amang a rather sleepy  congregation.    \"Hector and me gied ane anither sic a look! and I was feared Mr. Paton  would have observed it; but he was a simple, primitive, unsuspecting  old man--a very Nathaniel without guile, and he jaloused nothing; tho'  both Hector and me was like to split; and the dog, after laughing in  his sleeve for mair than a hundred yards, couldn't stand't nae longer,  but was obliged to loup awa owre a hedge into a potato field,  pretending to scent partridges.\"      THE WOLF.    This is a fierce and savage beast, resembling in form and size the  Newfoundland dog. It hunts in packs, and attacks deer, sheep, and  sometimes even man himself. When taken young, it may be tamed. It is  found in the northern portions of both continents. In North America,  there are several varieties.    _Miscellaneous Anecdotes._--Mr. Cuvier gives an account of a wolf that  had all the obedience and affection that any dog could evince. He was  brought up by his master in the same manner as a puppy, and, when full  grown, was sent to the menagerie at Paris. For many weeks, he was quite  disconsolate at the separation from his master, refused to take food,  and was indifferent to his keepers. At length he became attached to  those about him, and seemed to have forgotten his old affections.    On his master's return, however, in a year and a half, the wolf heard  his voice among the crowd in the gardens, and, being set at liberty,  displayed the most violent joy. He was again separated from his friend;  and again, his grief was as extreme as on the first occasion.    After three years' absence, his master once more returned. It was  evening, and the wolf's den was shut up from any external observation;  yet, the moment the man's voice was heard, the faithful animal set up  the most anxious cries, and, on the door of his cage being opened, he  rushed to his friend, leaped upon his shoulders, licked his face, and  threatened to bite his keepers when they attempted to separate them.  When the man again left him, he fell sick, and refused all food; and  from the time of his recovery, which was long very doubtful, it was  always dangerous for a stranger to approach him.    A story is told of a Scotch bagpiper, who was travelling in Ireland one  evening, when he suddenly encountered a wolf who seemed to be very  ravenous. The poor man could think of no other expedient to save his  life, than to open his wallet, and try the effect of hospitality; he  did so, and the savage beast swallowed all that was thrown to him with  such voracity, that it seemed as if his appetite was not in the least  degree satisfied.    The whole stock of provisions was of course soon spent, and now the  man's only resource was in the virtues of his bagpipe; this the monster  no sooner heard than he took to the mountains with the same  precipitation with which he had left them. The poor piper did not  wholly enjoy his deliverance; for, looking ruefully at his empty  wallet, he shook his fist at the departing animal, saying, \"Ay! Are  these your tricks? Had I known your humor, you should have had your  music before your supper.\"    In Sweden, frequent attacks are made upon the people by wolves, during  the winter, as they are then often in a famishing condition. In one  instance, a party of sixteen sledges were returning from a dance on a  cold and starlight night. In the middle of the cavalcade was a sledge  occupied by a lady; at the back of the vehicle sat the servant; and at  her feet, on a bear skin, reposed her favorite lapdog. In passing  through a wood, a large wolf suddenly sprang out, and, jumping into the  sledge, seized the poor dog, and was out of sight before any steps  could be taken for his rescue.    A Swedish peasant was one day crossing a large lake on his sledge, when  he was attacked by a drove of wolves. This frightened the horse so much  that he went off at full speed. There was a loose rope hanging from the  back of the vehicle that had been used for binding hay; to the end of  this a noose happened to be attached. Though this was not intended to  catch a wolf, it fortunately effected that object; for one of the  ferocious animals getting his feet entangled in it, he was immediately  destroyed, owing to the rapidity with which the horse was proceeding.    The poor man at length reached a place of safety. Though he had been  dreadfully frightened during the ride, he not only found himself much  sooner at the end of his journey than he expected, but richer by the  booty he had thus unexpectedly gained--the skin of a wolf in this  country being worth about two dollars and a half.    A peasant in Russia was once pursued in his sledge by eleven wolves.  Being about two miles from home, he urged his horse to the very extent  of his speed. At the entrance to his residence was a gate, which being  shut at the time, the frightened horse dashed open, and carried his  master safely into the courtyard. Nine of the wolves followed them into  the enclosure, when fortunately the gate swung back, and shut them all  as it were in a trap. Finding themselves thus caught, the animals  seemed to lose all their ferocity; and, as escape was impossible, slunk  into holes and corners, molesting no one, and offering no resistance.  They were all despatched without further difficulty.    The prairie wolf is said to be wonderfully cunning and sagacious.  Instances have been known of his burrowing under ground to procure the  bait from a trap, rather than run the chance of being caught above.  Many and curious are the devices prepared to ensnare this animal, but  very few have succeeded. This variety of wolf is common in the prairies  of the western country, where it hunts deer by running them down.  Sometimes a large number associate together, and, forming a crescent,  creep slowly towards a herd of deer, so as not to alarm them. They then  rush on with hideous yells, and drive the poor animals towards a  precipice, seeming to know that, when they are once at full speed, they  will all follow one another over the cliff. The wolves then descend at  leisure, and feed upon their slaughtered victims.    A farmer in France, one day looking through the hedge in his garden,  observed a wolf walking round a mule, but unable to get at him on  account of the mule's constantly kicking with his hind legs. As the  farmer perceived that the beast was so well able to defend himself, he  did not interfere. After the attack and defence had lasted a quarter of  an hour, the wolf ran off to a neighboring ditch, where he several  times plunged into the water.    The farmer imagined that he did this to refresh himself after the  fatigue he had sustained, and had no doubt that his"]]]
