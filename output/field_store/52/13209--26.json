Unger"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4330"],[0,"Two Expeditions into the Interior of Southern Australia â€” Complete (#19)"],[1,"on my arrival at Mount Harris, to  find its neighbourhood silent and deserted. I remained, however, under it  for the greater part of the next day, and, prior to leaving it, placed a  sheet of paper with written instructions against a tree, though almost  without a hope that it would remain untouched.    PERPLEXING SITUATION.    A little after sun-set we reached the first small marsh, at which we  slept; and on the following morning I crossed the plains of the Macquarie,  and joined the party at about fifteen miles from the creek at which I had  left it. I found it in a condition that was as unlooked for by Mr. Hume as  it was unexpected by me, and really in a most perplexing situation.    On the day I left him, Mr. Hume only advanced about two miles, in  consequence of some derangement in the loads. Having crossed the creek,  he, the next morning, proceeded down its right bank, until it entered the  marshes and was lost. He then continued to move on the outskirts of the  latter, and having performed a journey or about eight miles, was anxious  to have stopped, but there was no water at hand. The men, however, were so  fatigued, in consequence of previous illness, that he felt it necessary to  halt after travelling about eleven miles.    No water could be procured even here, notwithstanding that Mr. Hume, who  was quite unfit for great exertion, underwent considerable bodily fatigue  in his anxiety to find some. He was, therefore, obliged to move early on  the following morning, but neither men nor animals were in a condition to  travel; and he had scarcely made three miles' progress, when he stopped  and endeavoured to obtain a supply or water by digging pits among the  reeds. From these he had drawn sufficient for the wants of the people when  I arrived. Some rain had fallen on the 6th and 7th of the month, or it is  more than probable the expedient to which he resorted would have failed of  success. Mr. Hume, I was sorry to observe, looked very unwell; but nothing  could prevent him from further endeavours to extricate the party from its  present embarrassment.    JOURNEY CONTINUED.    As soon as I had taken a little refreshment, therefore, I mounted a fresh  horse; and he accompanied me across a small plain, immediately in front of  the camp, which was subject to overflow and covered with polygonum, having  a considerable extent of reeds to its right.    From the plain we entered a wood of blue-gum, in which reeds, grass, and  brush formed a thick coppice. We at length passed into an open space,  surrounded on every side by weeds in dense bodies. The great marsh bore  south of us, and was clear and open, but behind us the blue-gum trees  formed a thick wood above the weeds.    About two hundred yards from the outskirts of the marsh there was a line  of saplings that had perished, and round about them a number of the tern  tribe (sea swallow) were flying, one of which Mr. Hume had followed a  considerable way into the reeds the evening before, in the hope that it  would have led him to water. The circumstance of their being in such  numbers led us to penetrate towards them, when we found a serpentine sheet  of water of some length, over which they were playing. We had scarcely  time to examine it before night closed in upon us, and it was after nine  when we returned to the tents.    From the general appearance of the country to the northward, and from the  circumstance of our having got to the bottom of the great marsh, which but  a few days before had threatened to be so formidable, I thought it  probable that the reeds would not again prove so extensive as they had  been, and I determined, if I could do so, to push through them in a  westerly direction from our position.    SECOND GREAT MARSH.    The pits yielded us so abundant a supply during the night, that in the  morning we found it unnecessary to take the animals to water at the  channel we had succeeded in finding the evening before; but pursuing a  westerly course we passed it, and struck deep into the reeds. At mid-day  we were hemmed in by them on every side, and had crossed over numerous  channels, by means of which the waters of the marshes are equally and  generally distributed over the space subject to their influence. Coming to  a second sheet of water, narrower, but longer, as well as we could judge,  than the first, we stopped to dine at it; and, while the men were resting  themselves, Mr. Hume rode with me in a westerly direction, to ascertain  what obstacles we still had to contend with. Forcing our way through  bodies of reeds, we at length got on a plain, stretching from S.E. to  N.W., bounded on the right by a wood of blue-gum, under which the reeds  still extended, and on the left by a wood in which they did not appear to  exist. Certain that there was no serious obstacle in our way, we returned  to the men; and as soon as they had finished their meal, led them over the  plain in a N.W. by W. direction. It was covered with shells, and was full  of holes from the effects of flood.    CONCLUSIONS IN REGARD TO THE MACQUARIE.    As we were journeying over it, I requested Mr. Hume to ride into the wood  upon our left, to ascertain if it concealed any channel. On his return he  informed me that he descended from the plain into a hollow, the bottom of  which was covered with small shells and bulrushes. He observed a new  species of eucalypti, on the trunks of which the water-mark was three feet  high. After crossing this hollow, which was about a quarter of a mile in  breadth, he gained an open forest of box, having good grass under it; and,  judging from the appearance of the country that no other channel could  exist beyond him, and that he had ascertained sufficient for the object I  had in view, he turned back to the plain. We stopped for the night under a  wood of box, where the grass, which had been burnt down, was then  springing up most beautifully green, and was relished exceedingly by the  animals.    It was in consequence of our not having crossed any channel, while  penetrating through the reeds, that could by any possible exaggeration  have been laid down as the bed of the river, that I detached Mr. Hume; and  the account he brought me at once confirmed my opinion in regard to the  Macquarie, and I thenceforth gave up every hope of ever seeing it in its  characteristic shape again.    Independently however of all circumstantial evidence, it was clear that  the river had not re-formed at a distance of twenty-five miles to the  north of us, since Mr. Hume had gone to the westward of that point, at  about the same distance on his late journey, without having observed the  least appearance of reeds or of a river. He had, indeed, noticed a hollow,  which occasionally contained water, but he saw nothing like the bed of a  permanent stream. I became convinced, also, from observation of the  country through which we had passed, that the sources of the Macquarie  could not be of such magnitude as to give a constant flow to it as a  river, and at the same time to supply with water the vast concavity into  which it falls. In very heavy rains only could the marshes and adjacent  lands be laid wholly under water, since the evaporation alone would be  equal to the supply.    The great plains stretching for so many miles to the westward of Mount  Harris, even where they were clear of reeds, were covered with shells and  the claws of cray-fish and their soil, although an alluvial deposit, was  superficially sandy. They bore the appearance not only of frequent  inundation, but of the floods having eventually subsided upon them. This  was particularly observable at the bottom of the marshes. We did not find  any accumulation of rubbish to indicate a rush of water to any one point;  but numerous minor channels existed to distribute the floods equally and  generally over every part of the area subject to them, and the marks of  inundation and subsidence were everywhere the same. The plain we had last  crossed, was, in like manner, covered with shells, so that we could not  yet be said to be out of the influence of the marshes; besides which we  had not crossed the hollow noticed by Mr. Hume, which it was clear we  should do, sooner or later.    SITUATION OF THE PARTY.    To have remained in our position would have been impossible, as there was  no water either for ourselves or the animals; to have descended into the  reeds again, for the purpose of carrying on a minute survey, would, under  existing circumstances, have been imprudent. Our provisions were running  short, and if a knowledge of the distant interior was to be gained, we had  no time to lose. It was determined, therefore, to defer our further  examination of the marshes to the period of our return; and to pursue such  a course as would soonest and most effectually enable us to determine the  character of the western interior.          CHAPTER II.        Prosecution of our course into the interior--Mosquito Brush--Aspect and  productions of the country--Hunting party of natives--Courageous conduct  of one of them--Mosquitoes--A man missing--Group of hills called  New-Year's Range--Journey down New-Year's Creek--Tormenting attack of the  kangaroo fly--Dreariness and desolation of the country--Oxley's Table  Land--D'Urban's Group--Continue our journey down New-Year's Creek--  Extreme Disappointment on finding it salt--Fall in with a tribe of  natives--Our course arrested by the want of fresh water--Extraordinary  sound--Retreat towards the Macquarie.      We left our position at the head of the plain early on the 13th of  January, and, ere the sun dipped, had entered a very different country  from that in which we had been labouring for the last three weeks. We had,  as yet, passed over little other than an alluvial soil, but found that it  changed to a red loam in the brushes immediately backing the camp. An open  forest track succeeded this, over which the vegetation had an"]]]
