Linnaeus named this group of plants for Matthias de l'Obel, a  Flemish botanist, or herbalist more likely, who became physician  to James I. of England.    Preferably in dry, sandy soil or in meadows, and over a wide  range, the slender, straight shoots of PALE SPIKED LOBELIA (L.  spicata) bloom early and throughout the summer months, the  inflorescence itself sometimes reaching a height of two feet. At  the base of the plant there is usually a tuft of broadly oblong  leaves; those higher up narrow first into spoon-shaped, then into  pointed, bracts, along the thick and gradually lengthened spike  of scattered bloom. The flowers are oft en pale enough to be  called white. Like their relatives, they first ripen their  anthers to prevent self-fertilization.    The lithe, graceful little BROOK LOBELIA (L. Kalmii), whose  light-blue flowers, at the end of thread-like footstems, form a  loose raceme, sways with a company of its fellows among the grass  on wet banks, beside meadow runnels and brooks, particularly in  limestone soil, from Nova Scotia to the Northwest Territory and  southward to New Jersey. It bears an insignificant capsule, not  inflated like the Indian tobacco's; and long, narrow,  spoon-shaped leaves. Twenty inches is the greatest height this  little plant may hope to attain.    Not only beside water, and in it, but often totally immersed,  grows the WATER LOBELIA or GLADIOLE (L. Dortmanna). The slender,  hollow, smooth stem rises from a submerged tuft of round, hollow,  fleshy leaves longitudinally divided by a partition, and bears at  the top a scattered array of pale-blue flowers from August to  September.      INDIAN or WILD TOBACCO; GAG-ROOT; ASTHMA-WEED; BLADDER-POD  LOBELIA    (Lobelia inflata)  Bellflower family    Flowers - Pale blue or violet, small, borne at short intervals in  spike-like leafy racemes. Calyx 5-parted, its awl-shaped lobes  1/4 in. long, or as long as the tubular, 2-lipped, 5-cleft,  corolla that opens to base of tube on upper side. Stamens, 5  united by their hairy anthers into a ring around the 2-lobed  style. Stem: From 1 to 3 feet high, hairy, very acrid, much  branched, leafy. Leaves: Alternate, oblong or ovate, toothed, the  upper ones acute, seated on stem; lower ones obtuse, petioled, to  2 1/2 in. long. Fruit: A much inflated, rounded, ribbed, many  seeded capsule.  Preferred Habitat - Dry fields and thickets; poor soil.  Flowering Season - July-November.  Distribution - Labrador westward to the Missouri River, south to  Arkansas and Georgia.    The most stupid of the lower animals knows enough to let this  poisonous, acrid plant alone; but not so man, who formerly made a  quack medicine from it in the days when a drug that set one's  internal organism on fire was supposed to be especially  beneficial. One taste of the plant gives a realizing sense of its  value as an emetic. How the red man enjoyed smoking and chewing  the bitter leaves, except for the drowsiness that followed, is a  mystery.    On account of the smallness of its flowers and their scantiness,  the Indian tobacco is perhaps the least attractive of the  lobelias, none of which has so inflated a seed vessel, the  distinguishing characteristic of this common plant.      CHICORY; SUCCORY; BLUE SAILORS; BUNK    (Cichorium Intybus)  Chicory family    Flower-head - Bright, deep azure to gray blue, rarely pinkish or  white, 1 to 1 1/2 in. broad, set close to stem, often in small  clusters for nearly the entire length; each head a composite of  ray flowers only, 5-toothed at upper edge, and set in a flat  green receptacle. Stem: Rigid, branching, to 3 ft. high. Leaves:  Lower ones spreading on ground, 3 to 6 in. long, spatulate, with  deeply cut or irregular edges, narrowed into petioles, from a  deep tap-root; upper leaves of stem and branches minute,  bract-like.  Preferred Habitat - Roadsides, waste places, fields.  Flowering Season - July-October.  Distribuition - Common in Eastern United States and Canada, south  to the Carolinas; also sparingly westward to Nebraska.    At least the dried and ground root of this European invader is  known to hosts of people who buy it undisguised or not, according  as they count it an improvement to their coffee or a disagreeable  adulterant. So great is the demand for chicory that,  notwithstanding its cheapness, it is often in its turn  adulterated with roasted wheat, rye, acorns, and carrots. Forced  and blanched in a warm, dark place, the bitter leaves find a  ready market as a salad known as \"barbe de Capucin\" by the  fanciful French. Endive and dandelion, the chicory's relatives,  appear on the table too, in spring, where people have learned the  possibilities of salads, as they certainly have in Europe.    >From the depth to which the tap-root penetrates, it is not  unlikely the succory derived its name from the Latin succurrere =  to run under. The Arabic name chicourey testifies to the almost  universal influence of Arabian physicians and writers in Europe  after the Conquest. As chicoree, achicoria, chicoria, cicorea,  chicorie, cichorei, cikorie, tsikorei, and cicorie the plant is  known respectively to the French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italians,  Germans, Dutch, Swedes, Russians, and Danes.    On cloudy days or in the morning only throughout midsummer the  \"peasant posy\" opens its \"dear blue eyes\"         \"Where tired feet        Toil to and fro;        Where flaunting Sin        May see thy heavenly hue,        Or weary Sorrow look from thee        Toward a tenderer blue!\"                            - Margaret Deland.    In his \"Humble Bee\" Emerson, too, sees only beauty in the  \"Succory to match the sky;\" but, mirabile dictu, Vergil, rarely  caught in a prosaic, practical mood, wrote, \"And spreading  succ'ry chokes the rising field.\"      IRON-WEED; FLAT TOP    (Vernonia Noveboracensis)  Thistle family.    Flower-head - Composite of tubular florets only, intense  reddish-purple thistle-like heads, borne on short, branched  peduncles and forming broad, flat clusters; bracts of involucre,  brownish purple, tipped with awl-shaped bristles. Stem: 3 to 9  ft. high, rough or hairy, branched. Leaves: Alternate, narrowly  oblong or lanceolate, saw-edged, 3 to 10 in. long, rough.  Preferred Habitat - Moist soil, meadows, fields.  Flowering Season - July-September.  Distribution - Massachusetts to Georgia, and westward to the  Mississippi.    Emerson says a weed is a plant whose virtues we have not yet  discovered; but surely it is no small virtue in the iron-weed to  brighten the roadsides and low meadows throughout the summer with  bright clusters of bloom. When it is on the wane, the asters, for  which it is sometimes mistaken, begin to appear, but an instant's  comparison shows the difference between the two flowers. After  noting the yellow disk in the center of an aster, it is not  likely the iron-weed's thistle-like head of ray florets only will  ever again be confused with it. Another rank-growing neighbor  with which it has been confounded by the novice is the Joe Pye  weed, a far paler, pinkish flower.    To each tiny floret, secreting nectar in its tube, many insects,  attracted by the bright color of the iron-weed standing high  above surrounding vegetation, come to feast. Long-lipped bees and  flies rest awhile for refreshment, but butterflies of many  beautiful kinds are by far the most abundant visitors. Pollen  carried out by the long, hairy styles as they extend to maturity  must attach itself to their tongues. The tiger swallow-tail  butterfly appears to have a special preference for this flower.  (See Self-Heal.)      COMMON or SCALY BLAZING STAR; COLIC-ROOT; RATTLESNAKE MASTER;  BUTTON SNAKEROOT    (Lacinaria squarrosa; Liatris squarrosa of Gray)  Thistle  family    Flower-heads - Composite, about 1 in. long, bright purple or rose  purple, of tubular florets only, from an involucre of  overlapping, rigid, pointed bracts; each of the few flower-heads  from the leaf axils along a slender stem in a wand-like raceme.  Stem: 1/2 to 2 ft. high. Leaves: Alternate, narrow, entire.  Preferred habitat - Dry, rich soil.  Flowering Season - June-September.  Distribution - Ontario to the Gulf of Mexico, westward to  Nebraska.    Beginning at the top, the apparently fringed flower-heads open  downward along the wand, whose length depends upon the richness  of the soil. All of the flowers are perfect and attract  long-tongued bees and flies (especially Exoprosopa fasciata) and  butterflies, which, as they sip from the corolla tube, receive  the pollen carried out and exposed on the long divisions of the  style. Some people have pretended to cure rattlesnake bites with  applications of the globular tuber of this and the next species.    The LARGE BUTTON SNAKEROOT, BLUE BLAZING STAR, or GAY FEATHER (L.  scariosa), may attain six feet, but usually not more than half  that height; and its round flower-heads normally stand well away  from the stout stem on foot-stems of their own. The bristling  scales of the involucre, often tinged with purple at the tips,  are a conspicuous feature. With much the same range and choice of  habitat as the last species, this Blazing Star is a later  bloomer, coming into flower in August, and helping the goldenrods  and asters brighten the landscape throughout the early autumn.  The name of gay feather, miscellaneously applied to several  blazing stars, is especially deserved by this showy beauty of the  family.    Unlike others of its class, the DENSE BUTTON SNAKEROOT, DEVIL'S  BIT, ROUGH or BACKACHE ROOT, PRAIRIE PINE or THROATWORT (L.  spicata), the commonest species we have, chooses moist soil, even  salt marshes near the coast, and low meadows throughout a range  nearly corresponding with that of the scaly blazing star.

But what is more important is the fact that the       Zeppelin is so large that it furnishes an excellent target,       unless it sails considerably higher than is comparatively safe       for an airplane. And when the Zeppelin is at a safe height it is       too far above the ground for your scout to make accurate       observations. Similarly, when the Zeppelin is used for dropping       bombs, it must be too high for the bomb thrower to show much       accuracy.\"         \"You think that the use of flying machines for scouting purposes       will be of considerably more importance than their use as a means       of attack?\" was another question.         \"That has been decidedly true so far,\" replied Wright. \"About all       that has been accomplished by either side from bomb dropping has       been to kill a few non-combatants and that will have no bearing       on the result of the war.    [Illustration: _At a French Airplane Base._ (C) International Pilot  Service.]         \"English newspapers have long talked of the danger of Zeppelin       attacks or airplane attacks, but it was all for a purpose,       because they did not believe the country was sufficiently       prepared for war and sought to arouse the people and the War       Department to action by means of the airship bogy. [Later history       showed Mr. Wright sadly in error on this point.]         \"Aside from the use of the machines for war purposes the war will       give a great boost to aviation generally. It has led more men to       learn to fly, and with a higher degree of skill than ever before.       It has awakened people to aviation possibilities.    [Illustration: Stringfellow's Airplane.]         \"Just like the automobile, it will become more and more       fool-proof, easier to handle and safer. There is no reason why it       should not take the place of special trains where there is urgent       need of great speed.         \"The airplane has never really come into its own as a sporting       proposition. Of late years the tendency has been to develop a       high rate of speed rather than to build machines that may be       operated safely at a comparatively low speed. You see, a machine       adapted to make from seventy to one hundred miles an hour cannot       run at all except at a pretty rapid clip, and this means       difficulty in getting down. One must have a good, smooth piece of       ground to land on and plenty of it. When we get an airplane that       will fly along at twenty miles an hour, one can land almost any       place,--on a roof, if necessary,--and then people will begin to       take an interest in owning an airplane for the enjoyment of       flying.\"         \"Is it true that you and your brother had a compact not to fly       together?\"         \"Yes, we felt that until the records of our work could be made       complete it was a wise precaution not to take a chance on both of       us getting killed at the same time. We never flew together but       once. From 1900 to 1908 the total time in the air for both Wilbur       and myself, all put together, was only about four hours.\"    Mr. Wright's statement of the brevity of the time spent in actual  flying in order to learn the art will astonish many people. Few  novices would be so rash as to undertake to steer an automobile  alone after only four hours' practice, and despite the fact that the  aviator always has plenty of space to himself the airplane can  hardly yet be regarded as simple a machine to handle as the  automobile. Nevertheless the ease with which the method of its  actual manipulation is acquired is surprising. More work is done in  the classroom and on the ground to make the fighting pilot than in  the air. As we have traced the development of both dirigible and  airplane from the first nascent germ of their creation to the point  at which they were sufficiently developed to play a large part in  the greatest of all wars, let us now consider how hosts of young  men, boys in truth, were trained to fly like eagles and to give  battle in mid-air to foes no less well trained and desperate than  they.          CHAPTER VI    THE TRAINING OF THE AVIATOR      The Great War, opening in Europe in 1914 and before its end  involving practically the whole world, including our own nation, has  had more to do with the rapid development of aircraft, both  dirigible balloons and airplanes, than any other agency up to the  present time. It tested widely and discarded all but the most  efficient. It established the relative value of the dirigible and  the airplane, so relegating the former to the rear that it is said  that the death of Count Zeppelin, March 8, 1917, was in a measure  due to his chagrin and disappointment. It stimulated at once the  inventiveness of the constructors and the skill and daring of the  pilots. When it opened there were a few thousand machines and  trained pilots in all the armies of Europe. Before the war had been  in progress three years there were more flying men over the  battlefields of the three continents, Europe, Asia, and Africa,  than there were at that time soldiers of all classes enlisted in the  regular army of the United States. Before that war the three arms of  the armed service had been infantry, artillery, and cavalry. The  experience of war added a new arm--the aviation corps--and there is  to-day some doubt whether in importance it should not be ranked  above the cavalry.    [Illustration: \"_America\"--Built to Cross the Atlantic Ocean._ (C) U.  & U.]    When war was declared none of the belligerent nations had its aerial  fleet properly organized, nor was the aviation department in any of  them equal in preparedness to the rest of the army. The two great  antagonists did not differ greatly in the strength of their flying  forces. Germany possessed about 1000 airplanes, exclusive of about  450 in private hands, of all which it is estimated about 700 were  ready for immediate service. Fourteen Zeppelins were in commission,  and other large dirigibles of different types brought the number of  the craft of this sort available up to forty.    [Illustration: _Wright Airplane in Flight._]    France was stronger in airplanes but weaker in dirigibles. Of the  former she had about 1500; of the latter not more than twenty-five.  The land was swept for planes in the hands of private owners and, as  the French people had from the first taken a lively interest in  aviation, more than 500 were thus obtained. The French furthermore  at the very outset imperilled their immediate strength in the air  for the sake of the future by adopting four or five machines as army  types and throwing out all of other makes. More than 550 machines  were thus discarded, and their services lost during the first weeks  of the war. The reason for this action was the determination of the  French to equip their aviation corps with standardized machines of a  few types only. Thus interchangeable parts could always be kept in  readiness in case of an emergency, and the aviation corps was  obliged to familiarize itself with the workings of only a few  machines. The objection to the system is the fact that it  practically stopped all development of any machines in France except  the favoured few. Moreover it threw out of the service at a stroke,  or remanded for further instruction, not less than four hundred  pilots who had been trained on the rejected machines. The order was  received with great public dissatisfaction, and for a time  threatened serious trouble in the Chamber of Deputies where  criticisms of the direction of the flying service even menaced the  continuance of the ministry in power.    At the outset of the war Great Britain lagged far behind the other  chief belligerents in the extent of her preparations for war in the  air. As has been pointed out the people of that nation had never  taken the general interest in aviation which was manifested in  France, and there was no persistent Count von Zeppelin to stir  government and citizens into action. The situation was rather  anomalous. Protected from invasion by its ring of surrounding  waters, England had long concentrated its defensive efforts upon its  navy. But while the danger of invasion by the air was second only to  that by sea the British contemplated with indifference the feverish  building of Zeppelins by Germany, and the multiplication of aircraft  of every sort in all the nations of the continent. The manufacture  of aircraft was left to private builders, and not until the war was  well under way did the government undertake its systematic  supervision. The Royal Aerial Factory, then established, became the  chief manufacturer of machines for army and navy use, and acted also  as the agent for the inspection and testing of machines built by  private firms. Control of the Royal Flying Corps is vested in the  Admiralty, the government holding that the strategy of airships was  distinctly naval.    In the use of seaplanes the British were early far in the lead of  other nations, as we shall see in a later chapter. And in the prompt  and efficient employment of such aircraft as she possessed at the  opening of the war she far outclassed Germany which in point of  numbers was her superior. At that moment Great Britain possessed  about five hundred machines, of which two hundred were seaplanes,  and fifteen dirigibles. Despite this puny force, however, British  aviators flew across the channel in such numbers to the headquarters  in France that when the Expeditionary Army arrived on the scene it  found ready to its hand a scouting force vastly superior to anything  the Germans could put in the air. It is no exaggeration to say that  the Royal Flying Corps saved Sir John French's army in "]]]
