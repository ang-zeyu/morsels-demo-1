Would the fettered chieftain desire to be freed from his bonds, and  breathe once more the free breath of the woods, and again return to his  distant people?\"    \"Gentle Monega!\" cried he, \"I pray thee, free these limbs from the  hateful thongs that eat into the flesh, and so cramp his benumbed  members, and Wauchee will fly like a deer to his own people, and also  bear away with him the sweet Wild-rose of the Oneidas, to bloom afresh  in the gardens of the Mohawks. Will Monega free the bondsman? and will  she fly with him to be the bride of his heart, and the queen of the  Mohawk people?    \"Monega cannot refuse,\" said the maiden, after a little hesitation;  \"Monega cannot refuse to save the life of the brave and handsome young  warrior; and if he asks it, neither can she refuse to depart with him,  and cast her lot with his people.\"    \"Monega speaks well,\" cried the captive, \"and her words gladden my  darkened spirit. Quick then, sever these bonds from my wrists and limbs,  that I may stand forth once more a free man. I will then escape to the  forest, and await you at the great fall of waters.\"    \"I gladly free you from your thongs,\" said she, \"and will not fail to  join you where you appoint; but remember that two brave warriors guard  with their weapons at the door, and that they will spare him not if he  but offer to depart. Yet one of them, the young Thaygea, has vowed to me  his love, and him will I entice away from his post of guard, and the  captive must fain deal with the other as he may. Is Wauchee content to  make the trial?\"    \"Sever these thongs, and free these crippled limbs, bright maiden, and I  would not shrink from an armed host. Do you entice away one of my  guards, and I will manage to escape from the other; and I shall then  impatiently await your coming at the Falls.\"    The bold girl with a trembling hand cut away the gyves that held the  prisoner, and then, departing, exchanged a few words with one of the  young men who guarded the hut, and who instantly forsook his post to  follow her footsteps. Wauchee hurriedly glanced around, to discover some  article that might serve as a weapon, and, snatching up a small billet  of wood that lay on the hearth, sprang to the door, and with one furious  blow felled the solitary sentinel to the earth, and then stretched  swiftly away in flight. But numbers of warriors, aroused by the sound of  the blow, were instantly after him in hot pursuit. The flying Wauchee  was most remarkable for his fleetness of foot, and could easily have  distanced his pursuers, but for his wounded ankle, which greatly impeded  his motions; and in a short time, after a desperate struggle, he was  overpowered, and roughly dragged back to the place of his captivity.    Again did the fair Monega, whose agency in his attempted flight had not  been suspected, attend upon her wounded lover; but so vigilant were his  guards, that an attempt at escape seemed now impossible.    In the lapse of a few days, the prisoner, under her skilful treatment,  had entirely recovered from his injuries, and a day was appointed for  his death. He was doomed to \"run the gauntlet\" of the tribe; that is, he  was required to run between two lines of warriors and of women and  children, armed with thongs of hide and small rods, which each one was  to use upon his person as the fugitive passed them in full career. On a  bright and cheerful morning the luckless prisoner was loosened from his  bonds, and led forth to run his race; after which he was doomed to  perish at the stake. But the brave youth stepped forth with an undaunted  eye, and a firm tread, to the place of torment. He eyed with a fearless  and contemptuous glance the fearful preparations made for punishment;  the long lines of his enemies ready with their rods to strike at him;  and the blackened pole of sacrifice surrounded with its pile of faggots.    He took his post at the head of the arranged lines, ready to plunge  through the thicket of rods that were menacing him. For a moment before  the start, he glanced his eye along the dark faces that scowled upon  him, to discern the fair form of Monega, but he observed her not. At  length the two men that held him loosened their grasp, and he was  directed to use his utmost speed. And well did the most famous runner of  the Mohawks maintain that day the fame that he had won in so many a  hard-contested race. He sprang forth with the strength and activity of  the wild stag, and scarcely a blow from the multitude alighted upon his  shoulders. When he had passed unharmed through the whole line, he would  have succeeded in making his escape altogether, had not several Oneidas,  posted for that purpose, flung themselves upon him, and securely  pinioned his limbs. Thus firmly bound, the Mohawk was led to the fatal  stake, and secured with thongs to the upright posts, while large bundles  of dried saplings were heaped around him by his persecutors. The whole  party of the Oneidas then assembled around him in a circle, to enjoy his  dying agonies. The brave youth now gave himself up for lost, and threw a  hasty glance on the blue sky that bent its dome above him, and over the  green woods that nestled with all their leaves in the summer breeze, as  on lovely objects which his eyes were never more destined to look upon  again.    The torch was lighted, and a grim chief was advancing to apply it to the  pile, when the light step of Monega anticipated his approach. As she  issued from the crowd, she implored the privilege of whispering a few  words to him who was about to die. So highly was she held in the  estimation of the tribe, that leave was readily granted her, and,  thrusting aside the dry heap of the sacrifice, she stood beside the  captive. She spoke not a word, however, but hastily passed a sharp knife  over the thongs that secured him, and instantly freed his limbs in  liberty.    \"Now, fly, fly, I beseech thee,\" she whispered; \"you are free--once more  free! Fly with the speed of the wind.\"    \"I will do my best endeavor,\" said he, hurriedly; \"and if I escape,  shall await you at the great Waterfall; and so, farewell.\" And, with one  vigorous bound, he sprang through the ring of his foes, overthrowing  some three or four of them to the earth. And bravely did he stretch away  his sinewy limbs in the flight for life and liberty; and though fifty  active runners followed in pursuit, yet soon did he outstrip them all,  and effected his escape.    He was shortly rejoined at the foot of the great falls by his faithful  Monega, who accompanied her lover in his flight, and became his bride,  and the chief woman of the Mohawk nation.          THRENODIA.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE,    BY MRS. KIMBALL.          Dear one, mine own! art gone        From young life's happy places,      To the dark grave and lone--        Death's cold and drear embraces!        Loosed are the silver strings        Of thy heart's ringing lyre--      Are broken thy wild wings,        Spirit of love and fire!        No, I feel hovering near,        Thy presence mild and tender,      My heart looks in thine eyes so dear,        And thrills at their soft splendor.        The dreams I dream are thine        When come my sweetest slumbers;      No melody is so divine        As memories of thy numbers.        Why art thou near my soul        Yet flying my fond vision?      Eluding yet love's sweet control,        Yet raining dreams elysian?        Oh angel, who before us        Art summoned home to heaven,      Still, still, oh linger o'er us,        Till we too are forgiven;        'Till we in holiest songs        Repeat each sweetest duty,      In that pure air where Heaven prolongs        Thy gentle life of beauty.          MR. ASHBURNER IN NEW-YORK.    BY FRANK MANHATTAN, JUN.           _To the Editor of the International._         The very graphic and interesting pictures of American society       with which my respected progenitor has recently favored the       English public having been received with unusual favor, and the       series having been suddenly terminated, to the great regret of       the literary public, it becomes, I conceive, my duty to carry       on the work so nobly begun, even though the superstructure be       far inferior in beauty and solidity to the foundation. In       pursuing these, my filial labors, I shall always keep in view       the two pole stars which ever guided the senior Mr.       Ashburner--first, that these letters are designed for English       and not American readers, and second, that I am portraying a       class, and not individuals. As I shall thus address myself to a       foreign audience, it will of course be my duty to describe the       frivolities of American manners--the faults of American ladies,       the imbecilities of American gentlemen, the scurrilities of the       American press, the weakness of American magazines, the       degeneracy of American literature, the roguery of the American       public, the want of taste of American engineers, the ignorance       of American professors, and to discuss any questions of       strictly local interest which may happen to present themselves.       I shall studiously avoid stating that education or intelligence       or usefulness are ever encountered here; and if occasionally       some little sketch of domestic happiness or private worth       should be given, you will attribute it to my own inadvertence,       or set it down as a result of English education. As I shall be       describing a class, and not individuals, it will of course be       perfectly proper for me to narrate any little incidents of       private life which I may have heard; and persons interested       will (or at least ought to) bear in mind, if my letters are       ever read by themselves or talked of by their acquaintances,       that I am not alluding to them in the slightest degree, but  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31219"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#19)"],[1,"come.

I was born near Auburn, in Wake County,  January 7, 1856. My father was Allen Lane and my mother was named  Bertcha Lane. We belonged to Gov. Charles Manly, that is mother and  myself, father belonged to some maiden ladies, Susan and Emma White.  The governor had large plantations, but mother and myself lived with  them on their lot right where the Rex Hospital now stands on South and  Fayetteville Streets. Governor Manly owned the block down to the  railroad, and we chillun went into [HW: ?] grove, it was a grove then,  to pick up walnuts and hickory nuts.    \"My father was a stonecutter and he hired his time and gave it to his  missus and lived with us. Mother was at Governor Manly's. He said  father was a high-headed fellow and said he was livin' on his lot and  in his house and that he didn't do anything for him, and that he ought  to keep up his family. Mother was the washerwoman for the governor and  his family. Missus Manly, the Governor's wife, I forget her first name,  did not take any particular interest in her servants. She had slave  servants for everything: a wash and ironer, a drawing room and parlor  cleaner, a cook, waiting men, waitresses and a maid who did nothing  but wait on her.    \"Governor Manly was a mighty rich man, and he had several plantations  and a lot o' slaves. I don't remember how many slaves he owned. Mother  was given meal and meat and had to cook it just the same as she would  now. They didn't allow her food from the great house. Mother had ten  children, and at times we did not have enough to eat. We went hungry a  lot. The boys were named Fred, David, Matthew, Allen, and Thomas.  Girls, Cinderilla, Corinna, Hannah, Victoria, and Mary. All were born  slaves but two. Thomas and Mary. David and myself are all that are left  alive.    \"I remember that we lived in a plank house, with three rooms and a shed  porch. Mother washed clothes under the porch. The house had two rooms  downstairs and one upstairs. (Oh! I have thought of the Governor's  wife's name, missus name, it was Charity.) We used trundle beds of  wood. Mother made our bed clothes at night. She also made bonnets and  dresses. Sometimes she made bonnets and sold them. The child that set  up with her she gave some kind o' sweets. I set up with her a lot  because I liked to eat. Mother was allowed the little money she made  makin' bonnets and dresses at night.    \"They whupped slaves on the place. I could hear the blows and hear 'em  screamin' cryin' an' beggin', but I never saw it. I never saw a slave  sold an' I never saw any in chains.    \"I do not remember how many children old marster had, I only remember  one; he was Marster Basil Manly. He was an officer in the Confederate  Army. He used to come home with his pretty clothes an' his hat with  plumes on it. Mother tole me that before she was married Marster gave  her to his son Basil as a maid for his wife Caroline.    \"Missus Caroline whupped her most every day, and about anything. Mother  said she could not please her in anything, no matter what she done or  how hard she tried. Missus would go up town and come back and whup her.  Mother was a young girl then. One day Miss Caroline went up town, an'  come back mad. She made mother strip down to her waist, and then took a  carriage whup an' beat her until the blood was runnin' down her back.  Mother said she was afraid she would kill her, so she ran for the woods  and hid there, and stayed three weeks. She made up her mind she wasn't  comin' back.    \"The old Governor Charles Manly, went to mother's father, Jimmie Manly  an' tole him if he did not get Bertcha back he would whup him. Her  father tole him he did not know where she was, an' that he belonged to  him an' he could do with him as he liked, but he was not goin' one step  to hunt Bertcha, my mother. Then the governor went to grandmother an'  tole her she had to find her. He tole her to leave the lot an' stay  away until her daughter came back. Grandmother did not know where she  was.    \"The niggers on different plantations fed mother by carrying things to  certain hidin' places and leavin' it. Grandmother got word to her, an'  she said she would come back, but not to Mis' Caroline. She told  marster, so marster let her stay with grandmother until Christmas, then  they allowed her to hire herself out. She hired herself to Mrs.  Simpson. She was good to her and allowed her to work for herself at  night, sit up as long as she wanted to, and she stayed with her until  she was married. Then she went back to old marster's.    \"When the war ended mother went to old marster and told him she was  goin' to leave. He told her she could not feed all her children, pay  house rent, and buy wood, to stay on with him. Marster told father and  mother they could have the house free and wood free, an' he would help  them feed the children, but mother said, 'No, I am goin' to leave. I  have never been free and I am goin' to try it. I am goin' away and by  my work and the help of the Lord I will live somehow'. Marster then  said, 'Well stay as long as you wish, and leave when you get ready, but  wait until you find a place to go, and leave like folks.' Marster  allowed her to take all her things with her when she left. The white  folks told her good bye.    \"We went to a colored Methodist Church in slavery time but we had a  white pastor. His name was Dr. Pell. He was a mighty nice man and all  the colored people loved him. After the surrender it was a long time  that the colored people had white preachers in their churches. It was a  long time after the war before any of the colored churches had Negro  preachers. William Warrick was the first colored preacher in Raleigh.  He preached in the basement of the Baptist Church now standing on the  corner of Hillsboro and Salisbury Streets. I went to church and Sunday  school there after the surrender.    \"I went to school in Raleigh and taught school in Ft. Payne, Alabama.  My husband was a carpenter and went there where he could get good  wages. Slavery was a very bad thing. Abraham Lincoln was one of the  best men that ever lived.    \"Roosevelt is just grand. He is no doubt one of the greatest men of any  age. I love to look at his picture. I love him because he has done so  much for humanity. I pray to the Lord to let him live to serve his  country, and help his people.\"    LE          N.C. District:       No. 2  Worker:              T.
