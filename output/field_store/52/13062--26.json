Be eloquent, and deep, and tender; see, with a clear eye, into Nature and  into life; spread your white wings of quivering thought, and soar, a  god-like spirit, over the whirling world beneath you, up through long  lanes of flaming stars to the gates of eternity!\"    After hot muffins, it says, \"Be dull and soulless, like a beast of the  field--a brainless animal, with listless eye, unlit by any ray of fancy,  or of hope, or fear, or love, or life.\"  And after brandy, taken in  sufficient quantity, it says, \"Now, come, fool, grin and tumble, that  your fellow-men may laugh--drivel in folly, and splutter in senseless  sounds, and show what a helpless ninny is poor man whose wit and will are  drowned, like kittens, side by side, in half an inch of alcohol.\"    We are but the veriest, sorriest slaves of our stomach.  Reach not after  morality and righteousness, my friends; watch vigilantly your stomach,  and diet it with care and judgment.  Then virtue and contentment will  come and reign within your heart, unsought by any effort of your own; and  you will be a good citizen, a loving husband, and a tender father--a  noble, pious man.    Before our supper, Harris and George and I were quarrelsome and snappy  and ill-tempered; after our supper, we sat and beamed on one another, and  we beamed upon the dog, too.  We loved each other, we loved everybody.  Harris, in moving about, trod on George's corn.  Had this happened before  supper, George would have expressed wishes and desires concerning  Harris's fate in this world and the next that would have made a  thoughtful man shudder.    As it was, he said: \"Steady, old man; 'ware wheat.\"    And Harris, instead of merely observing, in his most unpleasant tones,  that a fellow could hardly help treading on some bit of George's foot, if  he had to move about at all within ten yards of where George was sitting,  suggesting that George never ought to come into an ordinary sized boat  with feet that length, and advising him to hang them over the side, as he  would have done before supper, now said: \"Oh, I'm so sorry, old chap; I  hope I haven't hurt you.\"    [Picture: Smoking pipes] And George said: \"Not at all;\" that it was his  fault; and Harris said no, it was his.    It was quite pretty to hear them.    We lit our pipes, and sat, looking out on the quiet night, and talked.    George said why could not we be always like this--away from the world,  with its sin and temptation, leading sober, peaceful lives, and doing  good.  I said it was the sort of thing I had often longed for myself; and  we discussed the possibility of our going away, we four, to some handy,  well-fitted desert island, and living there in the woods.    Harris said that the danger about desert islands, as far as he had heard,  was that they were so damp: but George said no, not if properly drained.    And then we got on to drains, and that put George in mind of a very funny  thing that happened to his father once.  He said his father was  travelling with another fellow through Wales, and, one night, they  stopped at a little inn, where there were some other fellows, and they  joined the other fellows, and spent the evening with them.    They had a very jolly evening, and sat up late, and, by the time they  came to go to bed, they (this was when George's father was a very young  man) were slightly jolly, too.  They (George's father and George's  father's friend) were to sleep in the same room, but in different beds.  They took the candle, and went up.  The candle lurched up against the  wall when they got into the room, and went out, and they had to undress  and grope into bed in the dark.  This they did; but, instead of getting  into separate beds, as they thought they were doing, they both climbed  into the same one without knowing it--one getting in with his head at the  top, and the other crawling in from the opposite side of the compass, and  lying with his feet on the pillow.    There was silence for a moment, and then George's father said:    \"Joe!\"    \"What's the matter, Tom?\" replied Joe's voice from the other end of the  bed.    \"Why, there's a man in my bed,\" said George's father; \"here's his feet on  my pillow.\"    \"Well, it's an extraordinary thing, Tom,\" answered the other; \"but I'm  blest if there isn't a man in my bed, too!\"    \"What are you going to do?\" asked George's father.    \"Well, I'm going to chuck him out,\" replied Joe.    \"So am I,\" said George's father, valiantly.    There was a brief struggle, followed by two heavy bumps on the floor, and  then a rather doleful voice said:    \"I say, Tom!\"    \"Yes!\"    \"How have you got on?\"    \"Well, to tell you the truth, my man's chucked _me_ out.\"    \"So's mine!  I say, I don't think much of this inn, do you?\"    \"What was the name of that inn?\" said Harris.    \"The Pig and Whistle,\" said George.  \"Why?\"    \"Ah, no, then it isn't the same,\" replied Harris.    \"What do you mean?\" queried George.    \"Why it's so curious,\" murmured Harris, \"but precisely that very same  thing happened to _my_ father once at a country inn.  I've often heard  him tell the tale.  I thought it might have been the same inn.\"    We turned in at ten that night, and I thought I should sleep well, being  tired; but I didn't.  As a rule, I undress and put my head on the pillow,  and then somebody bangs at the door, and says it is half-past eight: but,  to-night, everything seemed against me; the novelty of it all, the  hardness of the boat, the cramped position (I was lying with my feet  under one seat, and my head on another), the sound of the lapping water  round the boat, and the wind among the branches, kept me restless and  disturbed.    I did get to sleep for a few hours, and then some part of the boat which  seemed to have grown up in the night--for it certainly was not there when  we started, and it had disappeared by the morning--kept digging into my  spine.  I slept through it for a while, dreaming that I had swallowed a  sovereign, and that they were cutting a hole in my back with a gimlet, so  as to try and get it out.  I thought it very unkind of them, and I told  them I would owe them the money, and they should have it at the end of  the month.  But they would not hear of that, and said it would be much  better if they had it then, because otherwise the interest would  accumulate so.  I got quite cross with them after a bit, and told them  what I thought of them, and then they gave the gimlet such an  excruciating wrench that I woke up.    The boat seemed stuffy, and my head ached; so I thought I would step out  into the cool night-air.  I slipped on what clothes I could find  about--some of my own, and some of George's and Harris's--and crept under  the canvas on to the bank.    It was a glorious night.  The moon had sunk, and left the quiet earth  alone with the stars.  It seemed as if, in the silence and the hush,  while we her children slept, they were talking with her, their  sister--conversing of mighty mysteries in voices too vast and deep for  childish human ears to catch the sound.    They awe us, these strange stars, so cold, so clear.  We are as children  whose small feet have strayed into some dim-lit temple of the god they  have been taught to worship but know not; and, standing where the echoing  dome spans the long vista of the shadowy light, glance up, half hoping,  half afraid to see some awful vision hovering there.    And yet it seems so full of comfort and of strength, the night.  In its  great presence, our small sorrows creep away, ashamed.  The day has been  so full of fret and care, and our hearts have been so full of evil and of  bitter thoughts, and the world has seemed so hard and wrong to us.  Then  Night, like some great loving mother, gently lays her hand upon our  fevered head, and turns our little tear-stained faces up to hers, and  smiles; and, though she does not speak, we know what she would say, and  lay our hot flushed cheek against her bosom, and the pain is gone.    Sometimes, our pain is very deep and real, and we stand before her very  silent, because there is no language for our pain, only a moan.  Night's  heart is full of pity for us: she cannot ease our aching; she takes our  hand in hers, and the little world grows very small and very far away  beneath us, and, borne on her dark wings, we pass for a moment into a  mightier Presence than her own, and in the wondrous light of that great  Presence, all human life lies like a book before us, and we know that  Pain and Sorrow are but the angels of God.    Only those who have worn the crown of suffering can look upon that  wondrous light; and they, when they return, may not speak of it, or tell  the mystery they know.    Once upon a time, through a strange country, there rode some goodly  knights, and their path lay by a deep wood, where tangled briars grew  very thick and strong, and tore the flesh of them that lost their way  therein.  And the leaves of the trees that grew in the wood were very  dark and thick, so that no ray of light came through the branches to  lighten the gloom and sadness.    And, as they passed by that dark wood, one knight of those that rode,  missing his comrades, wandered far away, and returned to them no more;  and they, sorely grieving, rode on without him, mourning him as one dead.    Now, when they reached the fair castle towards which they had been  journeying, they stayed there many days, and made merry; and one night,  as they sat in cheerful ease around the logs that burned in the great  hall, and drank a loving measure, there came the comrade they had lost,  and greeted them.  His clothes were ragged, like a beggar's, and many sad  wounds were on his sweet flesh, but upon his face there shone a great  radiance of deep joy.    And they questioned him, asking him what had befallen him: and he told  them how in the dark wood he had lost his way, and had wandered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30802"],[0,"Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book the First (#19)"],[1,"ls, or new constitutions, posterior in time to the other books,  and amounting to a supplement to the code; containing new decrees of  successive emperors, as new questions happened to arise. These form  the body of Roman law, or _corpus juris civilis_, as published about  the time of Justinian: which however fell soon into neglect and  oblivion, till about the year 1130, when a copy of the digests was  found at Amalfi in Italy; which accident, concurring with the policy  of the Romish ecclesiastics[w], suddenly gave new vogue and authority  to the civil law, introduced it into several nations, and occasioned  that mighty inundation of voluminous comments, with which this system  of law, more than any other, is now loaded.    [Footnote w: See Sec. 1. pag. 18.]    THE canon law is a body of Roman ecclesiastical law, relative to such  matters as that church either has, or pretends to have, the proper  jurisdiction over. This is compiled from the opinions of the antient  Latin fathers, the decrees of general councils, the decretal epistles  and bulles of the holy see. All which lay in the same disorder and  confusion as the Roman civil law, till about the year 1151, one  Gratian an Italian monk, animated by the discovery of Justinian's  pandects at Amalfi, reduced them into some method in three books,  which he entitled _concordia discordantium canonum_, but which are  generally known by the name of _decretum Gratiani_. These reached as  low as the time of pope Alexander III. The subsequent papal decrees,  to the pontificate of Gregory IX, were published in much the same  method under the auspices of that pope, about the year 1230, in five  books entitled _decretalia Gregorii noni_. A sixth book was added by  Boniface VIII, about the year 1298, which is called _sextus  decretalium_. The Clementine constitutions, or decrees of Clement V,  were in like manner authenticated in 1317 by his successor John XXII;  who also published twenty constitutions of his own, called the  _extravagantes Joannis_: all which in some measure answer to the  novels of the civil law. To these have been since added some decrees  of later popes in five books, called _extravagantes communes_. And all  these together, Gratian's decree, Gregory's decretals, the sixth  decretal, the Clementine constitutions, and the extravagants of John  and his successors, form the _corpus juris canonici_, or body of the  Roman canon law.    BESIDES these pontificial collections, which during the times of  popery were received as authentic in this island, as well as in other  parts of christendom, there is also a kind of national canon law,  composed of _legatine_ and _provincial_ constitutions, and adapted  only to the exigencies of this church and kingdom. The _legatine_  constitutions were ecclesiastical laws, enacted in national synods,  held under the cardinals Otho and Othobon, legates from pope Gregory  IX and pope Adrian IV, in the reign of king Henry III about the years  1220 and 1268. The _provincial_ constitutions are principally the  decrees of provincial synods, held under divers arch-bishops of  Canterbury, from Stephen Langton in the reign of Henry III to Henry  Chichele in the reign of Henry V; and adopted also by the province of  York[x] in the reign of Henry VI. At the dawn of the reformation, in  the reign of king Henry VIII, it was enacted in parliament[y] that a  review should be had of the canon law; and, till such review should be  made, all canons, constitutions, ordinances, and synodals provincial,  being then already made, and not repugnant to the law of the land or  the king's prerogative, should still be used and executed. And, as no  such review has yet been perfected, upon this statute now depends the  authority of the canon law in England.    [Footnote x: Burn's eccl. law, pref. viii.]    [Footnote y: Statute 25 Hen. VIII. c. 19; revived and confirmed by 1  Eliz. c. 1.]    AS for the canons enacted by the clergy under James I, in the year  1603, and never confirmed in parliament, it has been solemnly adjudged  upon the principles of law and the constitution, that where they are  not merely declaratory of the antient canon law, but are introductory  of new regulations, they do not bind the laity[z]; whatever regard the  clergy may think proper to pay them.    [Footnote z: Stra. 1057.]    THERE are four species of courts in which the civil and canon laws are  permitted under different restrictions to be used. 1. The courts of  the arch-bishops and bishops and their derivative officers, usually  called in our law courts christian, _curiae christianitatis_, or the  ecclesiastical courts. 2. The military courts. 3. The courts of  admiralty. 4. The courts of the two universities. In all, their  reception in general, and the different degrees of that reception, are  grounded intirely upon custom; corroborated in the latter instance by  act of parliament, ratifying those charters which confirm the  customary law of the universities. The more minute consideration of  these will fall properly under that part of these commentaries which  treats of the jurisdiction of courts. It will suffice at present to  remark a few particulars relative to them all, which may serve to  inculcate more strongly the doctrine laid down concerning them[a].    [Footnote a: Hale Hist. c. 2.]    1. AND, first, the courts of common law have the superintendency over  these courts; to keep them within their jurisdictions, to determine  wherein they exceed them, to restrain and prohibit such excess, and  (in case of contumacy) to punish the officer who executes, and in some  cases the judge who enforces, the sentence so declared to be illegal.    2. THE common law has reserved to itself the exposition of all such  acts of parliament, as concern either the extent of these courts or  the matters depending before them. And therefore if these courts  either refuse to allow these acts of parliament, or will expound them  in any other sense than what the common law puts upon them, the king's  courts at Westminster will grant prohibitions to restrain and control  them.    3. AN appeal lies from all these courts to the king, in the last  resort; which proves that the jurisdiction exercised in them is  derived from the crown of England, and not from any foreign potentate,  or intrinsic authority of their own.--And, from these three strong  marks and ensigns of superiority, it appears beyond a doubt that the  civil and canon laws, though admitted in some cases by custom in some  courts, are only subordinate and _leges sub graviori lege_; and that,  thus admitted, restrained, altered, new-modelled, and amended, they  are by no means with us a distinct independent species of laws, but  are inferior branches of the customary or unwritten laws of England,  properly called, the king's ecclesiastical, the king's military, the  king's maritime, or the king's academical, laws.    LET us next proceed to the _leges scriptae_, the written laws of the  kingdom, which are statutes, acts, or edicts, made by the king's  majesty by and with the advice and content of the lords spiritual and  temporal and commons in parliament assembled[b]. The oldest of these  now extant, and printed in our statute books, is the famous _magna  carta_, as confirmed in parliament 9 Hen. III: though doubtless there  were many acts before that time, the records of which are now lost,  and the determinations of them perhaps at present currently received  for the maxims of the old common law.    [Footnote b: 8 Rep. 20.]    THE manner of making these statutes will be better considered  hereafter, when we examine the constitution of parliaments. At present  we will only take notice of the different kinds of statutes; and of  some general rules with regard to their construction[c].    [Footnote c: The method of citing these acts of parliament is various.  Many of our antient statutes are called after the name of the place,  where the parliament was held that made them: as the statutes of  Merton and Marlbridge, of Westminster, Glocester, and Winchester.  Others are denominated entirely from their subject; as the statutes of  Wales and Ireland, the _articuli cleri_, and the _praerogativa regis_.  Some are distinguished by their initial words, a method of citing very  antient; being used by the Jews in denominating the books of the  pentateuch; by the christian church in distinguishing their hymns and  divine offices; by the Romanists in describing their papal bulles; and  in short by the whole body of antient civilians and canonists, among  whom this method of citation generally prevailed, not only with regard  to chapters, but inferior sections also: in imitation of all which we  still call some of our old statutes by their initial words, as the  statute of _quia emptores_, and that of _circumspecte agatis_. But the  most usual method of citing them, especially since the time of Edward  the second, is by naming the year of the king's reign in which the  statute was made, together with the chapter, or particular act,  according to it's numeral order; as, 9 Geo. II. c. 4. For all the acts  of one session of parliament taken together make properly but one  statute; and therefore when two sessions have been held in one year,  we usually mention stat. 1. or 2. Thus the bill of rights is cited, as  1 W. & M. st. 2. c. 2. signifying that it is the second chapter or  act, of the second statute or the laws made in the second sessions of  parliament, held in the first year of king William and queen Mary.]    FIRST, as to their several kinds. Statutes are either _general_ or  _special_, _public_ or _private_. A general or public act is an  universal rule, that regards the whole community; and of these the  courts of law are bound to take notice judicially and _ex officio_;  without the statute being particularly pleaded, or formally set forth  by the party who claims an advantage under it. Special or private acts  are rather"]]]
