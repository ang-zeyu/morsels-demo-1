Lecoq started nervously, and replied, frowning:    \"You are too curious, Master Squirrel; be careful that you do not go too  far. Do you understand?\"    Fanferlot began to apologize.    \"That will do,\" interrupted M. Lecoq. \"If I choose to lend you a helping  hand, it is because it suits my fancy to do so. It pleases me to be the  head, and let you be the hand. Unassisted, with your preconceived ideas,  you never would have found the culprit; if we two together don't find  him, my name is not Lecoq.\"    \"We shall certainly succeed if you interest yourself in the case.\"    \"Yes, I am interested in it, and during the last four days I have  discovered many important facts. But listen to me. I have reasons for  not appearing in this affair. No matter what happens, I forbid your  mentioning my name. If we succeed, all the success must be attributed  to you. And, above all, don't try to find out what I choose to keep from  you. Be satisfied with what explanations I give you. Now, be careful.\"    These conditions seemed quite to suit Fanferlot.    \"I will obey your instructions, and be discreet.\"    \"I shall rely upon you. Now, to begin, you must carry this photograph  to the judge of instruction. I know M. Patrigent is much perplexed about  this case. Explain to him, as if it were your own discovery, what I have  just shown you; repeat for his benefit the scene we have acted, and I am  convinced that this evidence will determine him to release the cashier.  Prosper must be at liberty before I can commence my operations.\"    \"Of course, patron, but must I let him know that I suspect anyone  besides the banker or cashier?\"    \"Certainly. Justice must not be kept in ignorance of your intention of  following up this affair. M. Patrigent will tell you to watch Prosper;  you will reply that you will not lose sight of him. I myself will answer  for his being in safe-keeping.\"    \"Suppose he asks me about Gypsy?\"    M. Lecoq hesitated for a moment.    \"Tell him,\" he finally said, \"that you persuaded her, in the interest  of Prosper, to live in a house where she can watch someone whom you  suspect.\"    Fanferlot was joyously picking up his hat to go, when M. Lecoq checked  him by waving his hand, and said:    \"I have not finished. Do you know how to drive a carriage and manage  horses?\"    \"Why, patron, can you ask this of a man who used to be a rider in the  Bouthor Circus?\"    \"Very well. As soon as the judge dismisses you, return home immediately,  make yourself a wig and the complete dress of a valet; and, having  dressed yourself, take this letter to the Agency on Delorme Street.\"    \"But, patron--\"    \"There must be no but, my friend; the agent will send you to M.  de Clameran, who is looking for a valet, his man having left him  yesterday.\"    \"Excuse me if I venture to suggest that you are making a mistake. This  Clameran is not the cashier's friend.\"    \"Why do you always interrupt me?\" said M. Lecoq imperiously. \"Do what I  tell you, and don't disturb your mind about the rest. Clameran is not a  friend of Prosper's, I know; but he is the friend and protector of  Raoul de Lagors. Why so? Whence the intimacy of these two men of such  different ages? That is what I must find out. I must also find out who  this forge-master is who lives in Paris, and never goes to attend to  his furnaces. A jolly fellow, who takes it into his head to live at the  Hotel du Louvre, in the midst of a tumultuous, ever-changing crowd, is  a fellow difficult to watch. Through you I will have an eye upon him. He  has a carriage, you are to drive it; and you will soon be able to give  me an account of his manner of life, and of the sort of people with whom  he associates.\"    \"You shall be obeyed, patron.\"    \"Another thing. M. de Clameran is irritable and suspicious. You will be  presented to him under the name of Joseph Dubois. He will demand your  certificate of good character. Here are three, which state that you have  lived with the Marquis de Sairmeuse and the Count de Commarin, and that  you have just left the Baron de Wortschen, who went to Germany the other  day. Now keep your eyes open; be careful of your dress and manners.  Be polite, but not excessively so. And, above all things, don't be  obsequious; it might arouse suspicion.\"    \"I understand, patron. Where shall I report to you?\"    \"I will call on you every day. Until I tell you differently, don't step  foot in this house; you might be followed. If anything important should  happen, send a note to your wife, and she will inform me. Go, and be  prudent.\"    The door closed on Fanferlot as M. Lecoq passed into his bedroom.    In the twinkling of an eye he had divested himself of the appearance of  a police officer. He took off his stiff cravat and gold spectacles, and  removed the close wig from his thick black hair. The official Lecoq had  disappeared, leaving in his place the genuine Lecoq whom nobody knew--a  handsome young man, with a bold, determined manner, and brilliant,  piercing eyes.    But he only remained himself for an instant. Seated before a  dressing-table covered with more cosmetics, paints, perfumes, false  hair, and other unmentionable shams, than are to be found on the  toilet-tables of our modern belles, he began to undo the work of nature,  and make himself a new face.    He worked slowly, handling his brushes with great care. But in an hour  he had accomplished one of his daily masterpieces. When he had finished,  he was no longer Lecoq: he was the large gentleman with red whiskers,  whom Fanferlot had failed to recognize.    \"Well,\" he said, casting a last look in the mirror, \"I have forgotten  nothing: I have left nothing to chance. All my plans are fixed; and I  shall make some progress to-day, provided the Squirrel does not waste  time.\"    But Fanferlot was too happy to waste a minute. He did not run, he flew,  toward the Palais de Justice.    At last he was now able to convince someone that he, Fanferlot, was a  man of wonderful perspicacity.    As to acknowledging that he was about to obtain a triumph with the ideas  of another man, he never thought of it. It is generally in perfect good  faith that the jackdaw struts in the peacock's feathers.    His hopes were not deceived. If the judge was not absolutely and  fully convinced, he admired the ingenuity and shrewdness of the whole  proceeding, and complimented the proud jackdaw upon his brilliancy.    \"This decides me,\" he said, as he dismissed Fanferlot. \"I will make out  a favorable report to-day; and it is highly probable that the accused  will be released to-morrow.\"    He began at once to write out one of these terrible decisions of \"Not  proven,\" which restores liberty, but not honor, to the accused man;  which says that he is not guilty, but does not say he is innocent.    \"Whereas there do not exist sufficient charges against the accused,  Prosper Bertomy, in pursuance of Article 128 of the Criminal Code,  we hereby declare that we find no grounds for prosecution against the  aforesaid prisoner at this present time; and we order that he shall be  released from the prison where he is confined, and set at liberty by the  jailer,\" etc.    \"Well,\" he said to the clerk, \"here is another one of those crimes  which justice cannot clear up. The mystery remains to be solved. This is  another file to be stowed away among the archives of the record-office.\"    And with his own hand he wrote on the cover of the bundle of papers  relating to Prosper's case, the number of the package, File No. 113.          VII    Prosper had been languishing in his private cell for nine days, when on  Thursday morning the jailer came to inform him of the judge's decision.  He was conducted before the officer who had searched him when he was  arrested; and the contents of his pocket, his watch, penknife, and  several little pieces of jewelry, were restored to him; then he was told  to sign a large sheet of paper, which he did.    He was next led across a dark passage, and almost pushed through a door,  which was abruptly shut upon him.    He found himself on the quay: he was alone; he was free.    Free! Justice had confessed her inability to convict him of the crime of  which he was accused.    Free! He could walk about, he could breathe the pure air; but every door  would be closed against him.    Only acquittal after due trial would restore him to his former position  among men.    A decision of \"Not proven\" had left him covered with suspicion.    The torments inflicted by public opinion are more fearful than those  suffered in a prison cell.    At the moment of his restoration to liberty, Prosper so cruelly suffered  from the horror of his situation, that he could not repress a cry of  rage and despair.    \"I am innocent! God knows I am innocent!\" he cried out. But of what use  was his anger?    Two strangers, who were passing, stopped to look at him, and said,  pityingly, \"He is crazy.\"    The Seine was at his feet. A thought of suicide crossed his mind.    \"No,\" he said, \"no! I have not even the right to kill myself. No: I will  not die until I have vindicated my innocence!\"    Often, day and night, had Prosper repeated these words, as he walked  his cell. With a heart filled with a bitter, determined thirst for  vengeance, which gives a man the force and patience to destroy or  wear out all obstacles in his way, he would say, \"Oh! why am I not at  liberty? I am helpless, caged up; but let me once be free!\"    Now he was free; and, for the first time, he saw the difficulties of the  task before him. For each crime, justice requires a criminal: he could  not establish his own innocence without producing the guilty man; how  find the thief so as to hand him over to the law?    Discouraged, but not despondent, he turned in the direction of his  apartments. He was beset by a thousand anxieties."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38032"],[0,"Game Birds and Game Fishes of the Pacific Coast (#19)"],[1,"less than six ounces, and I  believe that a fifty pound fish can be landed with the same tackle.  Trolling with hand lines for salmon is practiced by some, but such is  not angling. Hauling in an impaled fish hand over hand with a small  cable is neither sport nor sportsmanlike.        [Illustration: CHINOOK SALMON (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha)]      THE CHINOOK, OR KING SALMON    (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha)    This species has a multiplicity of names, being known in different  localities as chinook, quinnat, king, Sacramento river and Columbia  river salmon, besides half a dozen or more Indian names. Its  distribution is the widest of any of the Pacific salmon, ranging on  both sides of the ocean from the latitude of Monterey Bay to Behring  Straits. The run begins on the Columbia river as early as the latter  part of February, many of the fish going up its tributaries 1000 miles  or more to spawn. Farther south the run becomes gradually later.    The spawning season also varies with the locality, and ranges from the  latter part of July to the middle of November. The date of spawning  seems to be determined by the temperature of the water, for it is said  that the salmon will not spawn, even if on the spawning grounds, until  the water has fallen to a temperature of 54 degrees Fahrenheit.    The chinook salmon is the largest of the family, specimens having been  taken in Alaska waters that have weighed 100 pounds, while 50 to 60  pound fish are common. Those taken in the Columbia river are said to  average 22 pounds, while the average of the Sacramento river catch is  16.    Head, rather pointed; eye, small and situated a little in front of the  back of the mouth; body, rounded and full, the deepest part being  about midway of its length; pectoral fins, short and situated low and  just behind the gills; dorsal fin, nearly midway of the back; ventral  fins, a little behind the center of the dorsal; anal fin about half  way between the ventral and the tail; adipose fin, a little in front  of the rear of the ventrals; caudal fin, or tail, slightly forked.    The back, dorsal fin and tail are generally well covered with dark  brownish black spots. There are few spots as a rule on the head, and  those are of a slaty color.    There is always some variation in color, but usually the back is quite  dark, turning to bluish on the sides and light silver below. As the  spawning season approaches, the jaws of the males become lengthened  and badly distorted and the color changes to more of a pinkish hue and  blotched in appearance. The gills are never alike on both sides,  varying from 15 to 19 in number. (See plate giving names of all parts  mentioned.)      BLUEBACK, OR SOCK-EYE SALMON, REDFISH    (Oncorhynchus nerka)    This species is next in commercial value to the chinook. It has been  taken occasionally in the Sacramento river but it is not common south  of the Columbia river. The run of this species begins about the first  of April and the fish go as far as Salmon river, Idaho, fully 1000  miles from the sea to spawn. By a peculiar instinct this species only  run up such rivers as have lakes at their heads, and spawn in the  lakes or at the mouths of little streams emptying into them, in many  of the lakes of Oregon and Washington are found the young of the  blue-back salmon which are commonly called redfish. These fish never  leave these lakes and therefore never attain a size of more than five  to seven pounds.    Head, short and pointed and light olive in color; under jaw, white;  body, long, slim and rather flattened; back, blue; sides, silver;  belly, dull white; dorsal fin, dark; others flesh color; tail, rather  narrow and well forked; gills, 13 to 15. As the spawning season  approaches the whole fish takes on a decided reddish cast, which  sometimes becomes as dark as a brick-red. The jaw becomes very much  hooked, and a few spots appear.      THE SILVER SALMON    (Oncorhynchus kisutch)    In line of importance the silver salmon occupies the next place. It is  also known by a number of names, among which are koho, skowitz and  kisutch. It is a small fish, rarely exceeding 16 inches in length and  never reaching more than ten pounds in weight. Its range is from  Alaska south to Monterey Bay, where it has recently been planted and  seems to flourish. It spawns in the smaller coast streams, never going  far from the salt water. Its run begins about the first of September,  spawning in October and November.    Head, short with blunt snout; opercles or gill covers, very convex;  body, shaped very much like the chinook; back, bluish green; sides,  silver white. It has but few spots and these are confined pretty much  to the head, upper fins and tail. Gills, 13 or 14.      THE HUMP-BACK SALMON    (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha)    This is another small species, rarely exceeding six pounds in weight  but more commonly from three to four. Its range is from the Sacramento  river, where it appears in limited numbers, north to Alaska.    Body, slim, scales very small; back, blue and sides silvery white.  Profusely spotted on the after part of the back, with large oval spots  on the tail. Gills, 11 to 13.      THE DOG SALMON    (Oncorhynchus keta)    The dog salmon rarely exceeds ten pounds in weight. Its range is from  the Sacramento river north, and its spawning-grounds the small streams  up which it never extends any great distance from the salt water.    Head, quite pike-like in shape and therefore much longer and slimmer  than the chinook. Back, dirty brown, with the sides of much the same  color, but of a lighter tint; fins, very dark; very few distinct  spots, with those showing very small; gills, 13 or 14.    =Tackle and Lure=--The Pacific salmon are only caught by trolling.  They will take a spoon, or any live bait. The most successful lure,  however, is a sardine, or other small fish of six to eight inches in  length. Pass the hook through both eyes, take a half hitch around the  head, insert the point of the hook in the gill and by bending the fish  in the shape of the hook bring the point out about an inch and a half  or two inches from the tail. This allows the fish to remain curved,  and gives it a revolving motion while trolling, resembling a live,  though disabled fish.    A salmon rod should consist of a butt 14 to 16 inches in length, with  a hand piece in front of the reel; tip, 6 feet long and not to weigh  more than 7 ounces; line not to exceed standard 12-thread. With fishes  weighing from 40 pounds and upward, 300 feet of line can be used to  advantage.        [Illustration: RAINBOW TROUT (Salmo irideus)]      THE RAINBOW TROUT    (Salmo irideus)    There are at least four distinct species of trout; that is, trout  proper and chars, now common to the coast. One of these, the Eastern  brook trout, is the result of artificial hatching and distribution.  These, as well as the rainbow, and to lesser extent the cutthroat,  have been so widely distributed by the state fish commission and  private hatcheries that to attempt to give the present habitat of the  several species would be sure to result in many errors which might be  confounding. The Eastern brook trout has taken kindly to our waters  and seem to be doing well in all suitable streams. Several other  foreign species of trout have been introduced into our waters as well  as these, among which are the Loch Leven, the German brown trout and  the Mackinaw, but the success of their acclimatization has yet to be  fully determined, though the Loch Leven and German brown seem to be  doing well in the higher streams.    The Eastern brook trout and the native species, known as dolly varden,  are chars and belong to the genus =Salvelinus=, but the rainbow and  the cutthroat are true trout belonging to the genus =Salmo=. The  rainbow and the cutthroat present a variety of forms in different  localities and these have been given separate specific names by the  naturalist. With many of these species(?) the only difference seems to  be too slight to entitle them to specific or even sub-specific  separation; the variation being no more than that found in the color  and markings of the same fishes in the same stream, caused by the  depth of the water, the food, or other local conditions.    The rainbow trout is now a resident, either through natural or  artificial distribution, of nearly all the streams of the Coast from  Washington to Lower California. They vary in size, color and number of  scales in different localities and have been given distinct specific  names in the various sections, those of the Coast streams of  California being used as the typical form. These several varieties,  even in their natural condition, showed very little, if any positive  line of demarkation, but since the establishment of the many  hatcheries on the Coast and the wide distribution of the fry hatched  from the spawn of the rainbow of the Sacramento and its tributaries,  of the steelhead of the Eel river, and of the typical form of the  Coast streams, there seems but one course now left, and that is to  group them all as one species under the original name of rainbow.    The rainbow is a very handsome trout, varying in size from adults of  but a few inches in the smaller Coast streams, to 25 and 30 inches  long in the larger rivers and lakes. Its dark spotted back and silvery  sides with the rich metallic colors of the rainbow streak gives it a  coloration that is at once brilliant and pleasing. As a game fish it  has no superior, if indeed an equal. It takes the fly with a rush,  often leaping out of the water to seize it as it is descending. Then  it fights with a determination, often breaking three or four feet into  the air, shaking its head to free the hook like a terrier shakes a  rat. It seldom sounds and never sulks. The rainbow trout goes to the  sea at varying ages, the same as all other trout that can get there  without passing through long stretches of warm"]]]
