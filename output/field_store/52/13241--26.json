At your wrist,  twenty miles eastward, lay Pretoria. On our front the hills were very  steep and high, but on the far side they sloped and were covered with  brushwood. It was through this brushwood that the Boers cunningly crept  on Tuesday night to make their attack at dawn.    \"This attack was a bit of first-class generalship. It was made at five  different points against five separate forces, and at exactly the same  hour, and, when the day was over, the Boers had by far the best of it. On  Tuesday afternoon five companies of the Lincolns, under Colonel Roberts,  arrived to relieve our squadron at the Nek, who were on the fatal morning  to join the other squadrons and march to reinforce General Smith-Dorrien.  About 5.30 on Wednesday morning I was awakened by the crackle of rifles.  I thought they were just behind the kopje. I jumped up, and picking up my  glass, I made for the top. I was soon joined by other officers, and,  while we could see nothing, we listened with serious and solemn awe,  owing to the continuous rattle of many Mausers. We knew what it meant to  our comrades in the gully, and worst of all, we could not help them very  much. About eight o'clock a galloper came from Major Scobell to bring  over all the guns. This was done, and soon our shells were dropping on  the ridges where we could see some Boers. We could not fire into the  hollow for fear of killing our own men. The fire became fiercer and  fiercer. We now knew the Boers had secured both sides of the valley, and  that our poor comrades were at their mercy. Were it not for the many  boulders, nooks, and crevices which were taken for cover, few should have  come out alive. The situation was critical in the extreme. What was to be  done? Colonel Alexander asked me if I would ride into Pretoria, see Lord  Roberts, explain the situation, and urge out reinforcements. I went off  at full gallop. After riding ten miles I noticed a gentleman on a  bicycle. Something said to me, secure this bike. I gave my horse to the  cyclist, told him to wait for me and I would return his bike, and then  mounted and scorched to headquarters. I sketched and explained the whole  situation to Lords Roberts and Kitchener, and by this time strong  reinforcements were despatched. After a much needed and kindly provided  lunch in Lord Roberts's dining-room, I, with his despatch to our Colonel,  cycled back, anxious to see what was what, and hoping that something had  been done to help our comrades in their dire straits.    \"There was scarcely a soldier left to guard Pretoria, so the order I  carried was to run no risks and return to Pretoria as soon as possible.  Oh, it was hard when I overtook them and found they could do nothing for  these poor fellows who had held out against the tremendous odds  throughout that fatal day, and who were now either dead, wounded, or in  the hands of the enemy. We all retired, reaching our camp outside  Pretoria about 1 A.M. Oh, the sadness and gloom at our mess that night!  Few words were spoken. Some of us hoped against hope. We earnestly  cherished the hope that Major Scobell would find some way out of this  gorge of death. At 5.30 we were up and ready to march. About eight a war  correspondent informed us that Major Scobell had escaped, two officers  had been killed, and one wounded, and the squadron prisoners. This was a  terrible blow to us all. We rejoiced at the escape of our popular and  gallant Major, but we mourned deeply the loss of the others. There was  brave Lieutenant Conolly, a dashing, ready-for-anything young soldier, a  great favourite in our midst. He, poor fellow, had fallen, shot through  the brain. His death was instantaneous. There was young Lieutenant  Pilkington, one of the most gentle and sweet-tempered fellows I ever met.  He had been five months a prisoner in Pretoria, and on being liberated  got his desire gratified by being attached to us. We all loved him, and  he, too, was among the dead, shot in several places while leading his men  against the foe. He had five months before been taken prisoner because he  refused to abandon a wounded comrade. Poor fellow! Black indeed was the  brief page of this fine young soldier's campaign. May his friends be  comforted by the assurance that we all loved him, and that he died as a  true and brave soldier at his terrible post. Captain Maxwell was  seriously wounded. I rode by his side for a long bit on our march to  that fatal death-trap, and had a very pleasant conversation together. He  didn't like the idea of being left in the Nek. He was, as we all  were--for we were all so happy together--dejected at the regiment being  divided. I'll never forget how, with a clap on the back, he said, 'Good  night, Padre.' Little I thought the next time I would see him would be  prostrated by the Boer bullet. When we heard the news, I was anxious to  get to the battle-field to lend what hand I could to the wounded and bury  our dead.\"    On the way the Samaritan, to his intense joy and relief, encountered  Major Scobell, who had been captured by the Boers and had escaped by a  marvel. From him he learnt the sad story of the battle, and the splendid  resistance of the troops till ammunition had been exhausted. He then  proceeded to visit Captain Maxwell, who was lying wounded in the hands of  the Boers, and afterwards engaged in carrying in the wounded on  stretchers, consoling the dying and tending the injured. Finally, after  Herculean labours, such sick as remained alive were carried off to  Pretoria. All, on this memorable day, behaved like heroes, but prominent  among them was Sergeant Rawdon, who worked a Maxim which was supporting  the D and F Companies of the Lincolns. While the others retired he stuck  to his gun under a concentrated fire from the enemy. As ill-luck would  have it his gun jammed, but the gallant fellow, undefeatable, dissected  the weapon, recoupled the parts, and resumed firing till the Maxim,  pocked with bullet marks, could be removed by volunteers of the D  Company!    An officer serving with General French described the sad events of the  day: \"The Scots Greys were detached from their brigade, and one squadron  was sent to accompany a column under Colonel Roberts of the Lincoln  Regiment, which proceeded towards Commando Poort on the Crocodile River,  north-west of Pretoria.    \"The fate of this column was briefly as follows. It encamped in a pass  with a poort on its front, consisting of high hills. The tops of these  hills were not occupied by our outposts, and at daybreak it was found  that the enemy had established himself there. The detachment of Greys and  Lincolns, with two guns, found themselves under a heavy fire, which  continued throughout the day. Our guns were unable to reply, as the Boers  were on high ground close on their front. The guns were abandoned, and  the fight was continued till evening, when our force surrendered. Major  Scobell, the squadron leader, escaped after having been taken prisoner,  and about fifty horses of the Greys were cut loose by the sergeant-major  and found their way back to our lines.\"    Simultaneously an attack was made by a commando under Grobler on the  outposts at Deerdepoort, about 8000 yards north of Wonderboom Fort. The  7th Dragoon Guards were briskly engaged, and Colonel Lowe with great  skill tackled the enemy, keeping the Dutchmen in check, and preventing  them from making a turning movement towards the extreme left of General  Pole-Carew's position. Some seventeen losses were sustained, however,  owing to the fact that the scouts mistook a party of Boers dressed in  khaki for the 14th Hussars, and were fired on at a range of 100 yards.  Few escaped, but these had managed to warn the regiment of the approach  of the enemy.    General Hutton in the meantime was opposing the southern detachment of  Boers near Lewpoort. He had four days' fighting, and finding that he was  being outflanked, asked for reinforcements. The 1st Cavalry Brigade left  Kameeldrift on the 9th of July, the 8th Hussars taking the place of the  Greys. On the 11th the Brigade carried Lewpoort Hill at the gallop--the  position for which General Hutton had been fighting before. Only one man  was lost in this operation. The Cavalry Brigade then went into camp at  Olifantsfontein, on the right of General Hutton's position at Reitvlei.  (The whole force continued to draw its supplies from Springs Station, the  terminus of a short mineral line from Johannesburg, where, at the end of  June, the Boers had been routed by the Canadians who garrisoned the  place.) The Dutchmen moved to some kopjes, and infested the high ground  on the east of Bronkhers Spruit. The outposts of the two forces were  continually in contact, and sniping was part of the daily programme.    The Cavalry remained at Olifantsfontein till after the 21st of July,  while preparing for a general advance towards Middelburg.    The list of casualties on that fatal 11th was a long one:--         Near Deerdepoort: _Killed_:--7th Dragoon Guards--Second       Lieutenant K. K. Mackellar. _Wounded_--Captain B. E. Church;       Lieutenant H. A. Chomeley.         At Nitral's Nek: _Killed_:--Royal Scots Greys--Lieutenant       Conolly. Royal Dragoons--Second Lieutenant Pilkington. 2nd       Lincoln--Lieutenant G. F. Prichard. _Wounded:_--Lincolnshire       Regiment--Captain J. J. Howley, Lieutenant C. J.

For a moment Philip stood  looking after him, a queer lump in his throat. He would have liked to  shake hands, and yet at the same time he was glad that DeBar had gone in  this way. He turned to the left--and saw at a glance that the outlaw  had given him the best light. DeBar was facing him when he reached his  ground.    \"Are you ready?\" he shouted.    \"Ready!\" cried Philip.    DeBar ran forward, shoulders hunched low, his pistol arm half extended,  and Philip advanced to meet him. At seventy paces, without stopping  in his half trot, the outlaw fired, and his bullet passed in a hissing  warning three feet over Philip's head. The latter had planned to hold  his fire until he was sure of hitting the outlaw in the arm or shoulder,  but a second shot from him, which seemed to Philip almost to nip him in  the face, stopped him short, and at fifty paces he returned the fire.    DeBar ducked low and Philip thought that he was hit.    Then with a fierce yell he darted forward, firing as he came.    Again, and still a third time Philip fired, and as DeBar advanced,  unhurt, after each shot, a cry of amazement rose to his lips. At forty  paces he could nip a four-inch bull's-eye three times out of five,  and here he missed a man! At thirty he held an unbeaten record--and at  thirty, here in the broad open, he still missed his man!    He had felt the breath of DeBar's fourth shot, and now with one  cartridge each the men advanced foot by foot, until DeBar stopped  and deliberately aimed at twenty paces. Their pistols rang out in one  report, and, standing unhurt, a feeling of horror swept over Philip as  he looked at the other. The outlaw's arms fell to his side. His empty  pistol dropped to the snow, and for a moment he stood rigid, with his  face half turned to the gloomy sky, while a low cry of grief burst from  Philip's lips.    In that momentary posture of DeBar he saw, not the effect of a wound  only, but the grim, terrible rigidity of death. He dropped his own  weapon and ran forward, and in that instant DeBar leaped to meet him  with the fierceness of a beast!    It was a terrible bit of play on DeBar's part, and for a moment took  Philip off his guard. He stepped aside, and, with the cleverness of a  trained boxer, he sent a straight cut to the outlaw's face as he closed  in. But the blow lacked force, and he staggered back under the other's  weight, boiling with rage at the advantage which DeBar had taken of him.    The outlaw's hands gripped at his throat and his fingers sank into his  neck like cords of steel. With a choking gasp he clutched at DeBar's  wrists, knowing that another minute--a half-minute of that death clutch  would throttle him. He saw the triumph in DeBar's eyes, and with a last  supreme effort drew back his arm and sent a terrific short-arm punch  into the other's stomach.    The grip at his throat relaxed. A second, a third, and a fourth blow,  his arm traveling swiftly in and out, like a piston-rod, and the triumph  in DeBar's eyes was replaced by a look of agony. The fingers at his  throat loosened still more, and with a sudden movement Philip freed  himself and sprang back a step to gather force for the final blow.    The move was fatal. Behind him his heel caught in a snow-smothered log  and he pitched backward with DeBar on top of him.    Again the iron fingers burned at his throat. But this time he made no  resistance, and after a moment the outlaw rose to his feet and stared  down into the white, still face half buried in the snow. Then he gently  lifted Philip's head in his arms. There was a crimson blotch in the snow  and close to it the black edge of a hidden rock.    As quickly as possible DeBar carried Philip into the cabin and placed  him on one of the cots. Then he gathered certain articles of food from  Pierre's stock and put them in his pack. He had carried the pack half  way to the door when he stopped, dropped his load gently to the floor,  and thrust a hand inside his coat pocket. From it he drew forth a  letter. It was a woman's letter--and he read it now with bowed lead,  a letter of infinite faith, and hope, and love, and when once more  he turned toward Philip his face was filled with the flush of a great  happiness.    \"Mebby you don't just understand, Phil,\" he whispered, as if the other  were listening to him. \"I'm going to leave this.\"    With the stub of a pencil he scribbled a few words at the bottom of the  crumpled letter.    He wrote in a crude, awkward hand:    You'd won if it hadn't been for the rock. But I guess mebby that it  was God who put the rock there, Phil. While you was asleep I took the  bullets out of your cartridges and put in damp-paper, for I didn't want  to see any harm done with the guns. I didn't shoot to hit you, and after  all, I'm glad it was the rock that hurt you instead of me.      He leaned over the cot to assure himself that Philip's breath was coming  steadier and stronger, and then laid the letter on the young man's  breast.    Five minutes later he was plodding steadily ahead of his big Mackenzie  hound into the peopleless barrens to the south and west.    And still later Philip opened his eyes and saw what DeBar had left for  him. He struggled into a sitting posture and read the few lines which  the outlaw had written.    \"Here's to you, Mr. Felix MacGregor,\" he chuckled feebly, balancing  himself on the edge of the bunk. \"You're right. It'll take two men to  lay out Mr. William DeBar--if you ever get him at all!\"    Three days later, still in the cabin, he raised a hand to his bandaged  head with an odd grimace, half of pain, half of laughter.    \"You're a good one, you are!\" he said to himself, limping back and forth  across the narrow space of the cabin. \"You've got them all beaten to a  rag when it comes to playing the chump, Phil Steele. Here you go up to  Big Chief MacGregor, throw out your chest, and say to him, 'I can  get that man,' and when the big chief says you can't, you call him a  four-ply ignoramus in your mind, and get permission to go after him  anyway--just because you're in love. You follow your man up here--four  hundred miles or so--and what's the consequence? You lose all hope of  finding her, and your 'man' does just what the big chief said he would  do, and lays you out--though it wasn't your fault after all. Then you  take possession of another man's shack when he isn't at home, eat his  grub, nurse a broken head, and wonder why the devil you ever joined the  glorious Royal Mounted when you've got money to burn. You're a wise one,  you are, Phil Steele--but you've learned something new. You've learned  there's never a man so good but there's a better one somewhere--even if  he is a man-killer like Mr. William DeBar.\"    He lighted his pipe and went to the door. For the first time in days the  sun was shining in a cold blaze of fire over the southeastern edge of  the barrens, which swept away in a limitless waste of snow-dune and rock  and stunted scrub among which occasional Indian and half-breed trappers  set their dead-falls and poison baits for the northern fox. Sixty  miles to the west was Fort Smith. A hundred miles to the south lay the  Hudson's Bay Company's post at Chippewayan; a hundred and fifty miles  to the south and east was the post at Fond du Lac, and to the  north--nothing. A thousand miles or so up there one would have struck  the polar sea and the Eskimo, and it was with this thought of the  lifelessness and mystery of a dead and empty world that Philip turned  his eyes from the sun into the gray desolation that reached from Pierre  Thoreau's door to the end of the earth. Far off to the north he saw  a black speck moving in the chaos of white. It might have been a fox  coming over a snow-dune a rifle-shot away, for distances are elusive  where the sky and the earth seem to meet in a cold gray rim about one;  or it might have been a musk-ox or a caribou at a greater distance, but  the longer he looked the more convinced he became that it was none of  these--but a man. It moved slowly, disappeared for a few minutes in one  of the dips of the plain, and came into view again much nearer. This  time he made out a man, and behind, a sledge and dogs.    \"It's Pierre,\" he shivered, closing the door and coming back to the  stove. \"I wonder what the deuce the breed will say when he finds a  stranger here and his grub half gone.\"    After a little he heard the shrill creaking of a sledge on the crust  outside and then a man's voice. The sounds stopped close to the cabin  and were followed by a knock at the door.    \"Come in!\" cried Philip, and in the same breath it flashed upon him that  it could not be the breed, and that it must be a mighty particular and  unusual personage to knock at all.    The door opened and a man came in. He was a little man, and was bundled  in a great beaver overcoat and a huge beaver cap that concealed all  of his face but his eyes, the tip of his nose, and the frozen end of a  beard which stuck out between the laps of his turned-up collar like  a horn. For all the world he looked like a diminutive drum-major, and  Philip rose speechless, his pipe still in his mouth, as his strange  visitor closed the door behind him and approached.    \"Beg pardon,\" said the stranger in a smothered voice, walking as though  he were ice to the marrow and afraid of breaking himself. \"It's so  beastly cold that I have taken the liberty of dropping in to get warm.\"    \"It is cold--beastly cold,\" replied Philip, emphasizing the word. \"It  was down to sixty last night. Take off your things.\"    \"Devil of a country--this,\" shivered the man, unbuttoning his coat. \"I'd  rather roast of the fever than freeze to death.\" Philip limped forward  to assist him, and the stranger eyed him sharply for a moment.    \"Limp not natural,\" he said quickly, his voice freeing itself at "]]]
