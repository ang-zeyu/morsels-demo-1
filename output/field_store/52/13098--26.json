Arthur Dimmesdale, Hester Prynne, and Roger  Chillingworth are developing, suffering, living creatures, caught  inextricably in the toils of a moral situation. By an incomparable  succession of pictures Hawthorne exhibits the travail of their souls. In  the greatest scene of all, that between Hester and Arthur in the forest,  the Puritan framework of the story gives way beneath the weight of human  passion, and we seem on the verge of another and perhaps larger solution  than was actually worked out by the logic of succeeding events. But  though the book has been called Christless, prayerless, hopeless, no  mature person ever reads it without a deepened sense of the impotence of  all mechanistic theories of sin, and a new vision of the intense reality  of spiritual things. \"The law we broke,\" in Dimmesdale's ghostly words,  was a more subtle law than can be graven on tables of stone and numbered  as the Seventh Commandment.    The legacy of guilt is likewise the theme of \"The House of the Seven  Gables,\" which Hawthorne himself was inclined to think a better  book than \"The Scarlet Letter.\" Certainly this story of old Salem is  impeccably written and its subtle handling of tone and atmosphere is  beyond dispute. An ancestral curse, the visitation of the sins of the  fathers upon the children, the gradual decay of a once sound stock, are  motives that Ibsen might have developed. But the Norseman would have  failed to rival Hawthorne's delicate manipulation of his shadows,  and the no less masterly deftness of the ultimate mediation of a dark  inheritance through the love of the light-hearted Phoebe for the latest  descendant of the Maules. In \"The Blithedale Romance\" Hawthorne stood  for once, perhaps, too near his material to allow the rich atmospheric  effects which he prefers, and in spite of the unforgetable portrait of  Zenobia and powerful passages of realistic description, the book is not  quite focussed. In \"The Marble Faun\" Hawthorne comes into his own again.  Its central problem is one of those dark insoluble ones that he loves:  the influence of a crime upon the development of a soul. Donatello, the  Faun, is a charming young creature of the natural sunshine until his  love for the somber Miriam tempts him to the commission of murder: then  begins the growth of his mind and character. Perhaps the haunting power  of the main theme of the book has contributed less to its fame than the  felicity of its descriptions of Rome and Italy. For Hawthorne possessed,  like Byron, in spite of his defective training in the appreciation of  the arts, a gift of romantic discernment which makes \"The Marble Faun,\"  like \"Childe Harold,\" a glorified guide-book to the Eternal City.    All of Hawthorne's books, in short, have a central core of psychological  romance, and a rich surface finish of description. His style, at its  best, has a subdued splendor of coloring which is only less wonderful  than the spiritual perceptions with which this magician was endowed. The  gloom which haunts many of his pages, as I have said elsewhere, is  the long shadow cast by our mortal destiny upon a sensitive soul. The  mystery is our mystery, perceived, and not created, by that finely  endowed mind and heart. The shadow is our shadow; the gleams of insight,  the soft radiance of truth and beauty, are his own.    A college classmate of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow summed up the Portland  boy's character in one sentence: \"It appeared easy for him to avoid  the unworthy.\" Born in 1807, of Mayflower stock that had distinguished  itself for bravery and uprightness, the youth was graduated from Bowdoin  at eighteen. Like his classmate Hawthorne, he had been a wide and  secretly ambitious reader, and had followed the successive numbers of  Irving's \"Sketch Book,\" he tells us, \"with ever increasing wonder and  delight.\" His college offered him in 1826 a professorship of the modern  languages, and he spent three happy years in Europe in preparation. He  taught successfully at Bowdoin for five or six years, and for eighteen  years, 1836 to 1854, served as George Ticknor's successor at Harvard,  ultimately surrendering the chair to Lowell. He early published two  prose volumes, \"Hyperion\" and \"Outre-mer,\" Irvingesque romances of  European travel. Then came, after ten years of teaching and the death  of his young wife, the sudden impulse to write poetry, and he produced,  \"softly excited, I know not why,\" \"The Reaper and the Flowers, a Psalm  of Death.\" From that December morning in 1838 until his death in 1882 he  was Longfellow the Poet.    His outward life, like Hawthorne's, was barren of dramatic incident,  save the one tragic accident by which his second wife, the mother of his  children, perished before his eyes in 1861. He bore the calamity with  the quiet courage of his race and breeding. But otherwise his days ran  softly and gently, enriched with books and friendships, sheltered from  the storms of circumstance. He had leisure to grow ripe, to remember,  and to dream. But he never secluded himself, like Tennyson, from normal  contacts with his fellowmen. The owner of the Craigie House was a good  neighbor, approachable and deferential. He was even interested in  local Cambridge politics. On the larger political issues of his day his  Americanism was sound and loyal. \"It is disheartening,\" he wrote in his  Cambridge journal for 1851, \"to see how little sympathy there is in the  hearts of the young men here for freedom and great ideas.\" But his own  sympathy never wavered. His linguistic talent helped him to penetrate  the secrets of alien ways of thought and speech. He understood Italy and  Spain, Holland and France and Germany. He had studied them on the  lips of their living men and women and in the books where soldier and  historian, priest and poet, had inscribed the record of five hundred  years. From the Revival of Learning to the middle of the nineteenth  century, Longfellow knew the soul of Europe as few men have known  it, and he helped to translate Europe to America. His intellectual  receptivity, his quick eye for color and costume and landscape, his ear  for folklore and ballad, his own ripe mastery of words, made him the  most resourceful of international interpreters. And this lover of  children, walking in quiet ways, this refined and courteous host and  gentleman, scholar and poet, exemplified without self-advertisement the  richer qualities of his own people. When Couper's statue of Longfellow  was dedicated in Washington, Hamilton Mabie said: \"His freedom from the  sophistication of a more experienced country; his simplicity, due in  large measure to the absence of social self-consciousness; his tranquil  and deep-seated optimism, which is the effluence of an unexhausted  soil; his happy and confident expectation, born of a sense of tremendous  national vitality; his love of simple things in normal relations to  world-wide interests of the mind; his courage in interpreting those  deeper experiences which craftsmen who know art but who do not know  life call commonplaces; the unaffected and beautiful democracy of his  spirit--these are the delicate flowers of our new world, and as much a  part of it as its stretches of wilderness and the continental roll of  its rivers.\"    Longfellow's poetic service to his countrymen has thus become a national  asset, and not merely because in his three best known narrative poems,  \"Evangeline,\" \"Hiawatha,\" and \"The Courtship of Miles Standish,\" he  selected his themes from our own history. \"The Building of the Ship,\"  written with full faith in the troubled year of 1849, is a national  anthem. \"It is a wonderful gift,\" said Lincoln, as he listened to it,  his eyes filled with tears, \"to be able to stir men like that.\" \"The  Skeleton in Armor,\" \"A Ballad of the French Fleet,\" \"Paul Revere's  Ride,\" \"The Wreck of the Hesperus,\" are ballads that stir men still.  For all of his skill in story-telling in verse--witness the \"Tales of a  Wayside Inn\"--Longfellow was not by nature a dramatist, and his trilogy  now published under the title of \"Christus,\" made up of \"The Divine  Tragedy,\" \"The Golden Legend,\" and \"New England Tragedies,\" added little  to a reputation won in other fields. His sonnets, particularly those  upon \"Chaucer,\" \"Milton,\" \"The Divina Commedia,\" \"A Nameless Grave,\"  \"Felton,\" \"Sumner,\" \"Nature,\" \"My Books,\" are among the imperishable  treasures of the English language. In descriptive pieces like \"Keramos\"  and \"The Hanging of the Crane,\" in such personal and occasional verses  as \"The Herons of Elmwood,\" \"The Fiftieth Birthday of Agassiz,\" and  the noble \"Morituri Salutamus\" written for his classmates in 1875,  he exhibits his tenderness of affection and all the ripeness of his  technical skill. But it was as a lyric poet, after all, that he won and  held his immense audience throughout the English-speaking world. Two  of the most popular of all his early pieces, \"The Psalm of Life\" and  \"Excelsior,\" have paid the price of a too apt adjustment to the ethical  mood of an earnest moment in our national life. We have passed beyond  them. And many readers may have outgrown their youthful pleasure in  \"Maidenhood,\" \"The Rainy Day,\" \"The Bridge,\" \"The Day is Done,\" verses  whose simplicity lent themselves temptingly to parody. Yet such poems as  \"The Belfry of Bruges,\" \"Seaweed,\" \"The Fire of Driftwood,\" \"The Arsenal  at Springfield,\" \"My Lost Youth,\" \"The Children's Hour,\" and many  another lyric, lose nothing with the lapse of time. There is fortunately  infinite room for personal preference in this whole matter of poetry,  but the confession of a lack of regard for Longfellow's verse must often  be recognized as a confession of a lessening love for what is simple,  graceful, and refined. The current of contemporary American taste,  especially among consciously clever, half-trained persons, seems to be  running against Longfellow.

Unprime skins are those that turn blue or black after being stretched  for a time. Usually the darker the pelt the poorer the fur. If only  slightly blued the pelt may go back only one grade, while if black it  is apt to be no better than No. 3 or No. 4 and may be trash of no  value.    Springy skins, as the name indicates, are those taken toward the last  of the season or in the spring and tho often prime pelted, have begun  to shed. The beginner is often deceived, for he thinks if the pelt is  prime, the fur is. Foxes and other animals are often \"rubbed\" toward  spring, which of course lessens their value.    A No. 1 skin must be not only average in size but free from cuts,  etc. No unprime skin will grade better than No. 2.    Skunk, to be No. 1 or black, must be prime in pelt, fair size and  stripe not extending beyond the shoulders. The day that only \"star  black\" were taken for No. 1 is passed, for most trappers and shippers  know better now.    A No. 2, or short striped skunk, is prime and the stripes, if narrow,  may extend nearly to the tail. A small No. 1 or a blued No. 1 is  graded No. 2.    A No. 3 or long stripe has two stripes extending the entire length,  but there must be as much black between the stripes as either of the  white stripes.    In some of the states, such as Minnesota, Iowa, the Dakotas, etc.,  skunk are large and are nearly all striped the same--long narrow  stripes--but owing to their size they are worth about the same as the  eastern short stripe or No. 2.    A No. 4, broad or white skunk, is prime but has two broad stripes  extending down the back. Most dealers class skunk as No. 4 if either  white stripe contains more white than there is black between the two  stripes.    All unprime skunk are graded down to No. 2, 3 and 4 according to  depth of fur and stripe. A No. 1 skunk in stripe, but blue, becomes a  No. 2, or if badly blued No. 3 or 4; a No. 2 skunk in stripe but blue  becomes a No. 3; a No. 3 in stripe but blue, a No. 4; a No. 4 in  stripe but blue generally goes into trash. In fact, if badly blued,  any of the grades may be thrown to trash.    Muskrat are assorted into four grades--spring, winter, fall and  kitts. Spring rats are known as No. 1; winter, No. 2; fall, No. 3;  Kitts, No. 4.    No. 1 or spring rats are those taken in March and April. The pelt is  then of a reddish color and is entirely free from dark spots. A few  spring rats may be caught earlier than March, but so long as they  show dark spots they are not No. 1.    No. 2, or winter rats, are pretty well furred, but there are dark  streaks and spots in the hide usually on the back.    No. 3 or fall are not full furred and the pelt is far from prime. The  dark streaks show much more than later in the season.    No. 4, or kitts, are only partly grown or if larger are badly  damaged.    Opossum is the only animal that may have a \"prime\" pelt but an  \"unprime\" coat of fur. This makes opossum rather difficult to assort  unless turned fur side out.    If opossum have been properly skinned and stretched they will, when  unprime, show a dark blue spot on the under side at the throat. The  plainer this spot the poorer the fur.    Good unprime skins are No. 2; poor unprime skins, No. 3; the very  poor and stagey, no fur, are No. 4, generally known as trash and of  no value.    The other fur-bearers, such as mink, otter, beaver, fox, wolves,  lynx, wild cat, fisher, raccoon, bear, badger, civet cat, weasel,  etc., are graded much the same that is, all skins to be No. 1 must be  caught in season, when the fur is prime, at which time the \"pelt\" is  healthy appearing--never blue or black--must be of average size,  correctly skinned, handled and free of cuts or shot holes.    Skins may be unprime from several causes, viz: caught too early,  improperly handled, under size, etc. Unprime skins are graded No. 2,  3 and 4 according to how inferior they are. The fairly well furred  unprime skins are graded No. 2; the low furred unprime skins are  thrown to No. 3; the poorly furred are thrown to No. 4, while low  stagey skins go to trash.    Some skins altho prime are so small that they grade No. 3. This,  however, is the exception rather than the rule. Usually if prime, the  under size will only put the skin down one grade.      * * *    I have bought some for a number of years, writes a collector, and  know that some trappers are like some farmers, they want as much  money for a bushel of dirty wheat as their neighbor gets for a bushel  of clean wheat. I have had skunk and opossum hides offered me that  had a pound or two of tainted fat on them, and skins that were taken  out of season, for which they expect to get No. 1 prices.    There are some who stretch their skins in the shape of an oblong  triangle and leave flesh enough on to make their dinner. Stretch your  hides as near the shape of the animal as possible; don't try to make  a muskrat hide as long as a mink, or a mink as wide as a muskrat.  Catch in season, flesh carefully, stretch in good shape, always take  bone out of tails, keep in an airy building until dry and then you  will not have to grumble so much at the buyer in regard to prices.        CHAPTER XXVII.    FROM ANIMAL TO MARKET.    Under this title, says an experienced Western trapper, I shall  endeavor to show my brother trappers how to handle pelts:    As soon as I get in from my traps (I use a team and wagon), I feed  team, dogs and self, then I proceed to skin the game in the usual  manner; when game is all skinned I put on my fleshing suit, made of  rubber cloth like that buggy curtains are made of, get out my  fleshing boards, of which I have three sizes--large, medium and  small--for each kind of cased skins except rat, which I flesh with  thumb and knife. The fleshing boards are like Fig. 1 on enclosed  diagram, made of 1 inch pine free from knots and dressed on both  sides, 3 feet 6 inches long, and for skunk 3/4 in. and 10 in. wide,  tapered up to a blunt point, edges rounded and sandpapered smooth.  These boards can be made of other sizes so as to fit larger or  smaller pelts of other kinds.      [Illustration: FLESHING BOARD.]    For a flesher I have tried nearly everything imaginable, dull knives,  hardwood scrapers, etc., but have abandoned them all for the hatchet.  I use an old lath hatchet head and use it tolerably sharp; I proceed  as follows: Put pelt on board but do not fasten, grip lower edge with  left hand, pull down hard, place point of board against breast and  use hatchet with right, pushing down and holding hatchet nearly flat;  use plenty of elbow grease; as fast as you get a strip cleaned off  turn hide a little but do not flesh on edge of board. It may not work  good at first and you may cut one or two hides, but you will soon get  the knack.      [Illustration: STRETCHING FRAME.]    If possible take a bitch skunk for the first as they flesh easier,  and be sure there are no burrs or chunks of mud in the fur, or you  will cut a hole the size of the burr. Now for the stretchers. In Fig.  2 is what I use; it is something of my own invention, and there is no  patent on it. It is made of any wood that will split straight, and  the dimensions are as follows: Pieces are 4 ft. long by 1 3/8 in.  dressed smooth; pieces are 1 1/2 X 3/8 in.; will say for large skunks  here they would be 10 in. and 4 1/2 in. To frame you must soak or  steam the long pieces; mitre the ends and fasten with 3d finishing  nails clinched. Then place in position 1 in. from ends and fasten  with two 6d finishing nails; place in position and pull up to 8 in.  from nose and fasten: now chamfer off edges and sandpaper smooth.    I like this stretcher, as it airs both sides of pelt and will dry  them in half the time. Fig 3 shows manner of fastening pelt; on belly  side it can be drawn down and fastened to tail pieces with sack  needle and twine; it is made of two or more poles fastened in the  shape of a hoop.    In shipping furs, bale tight; do not ship loose in sack; place mink  and rat inside of skunk and other fur, and always place the toughest  pelts on outside. By bailing tight you will avoid crinkling and they  will not look mussy and will bring from 5 to 10 per cent more. Now,  brother trappers, fleshing pelts, as I understand it, is not merely  taking the fat off, but in going deeper and taking the flesh clean  from the pelt so that if skunk, the stripe will show clear the full  length and reducing the weight by half. On February 2nd. I shipped 15  skunk, all large; the lot only weighed 9 pounds including sack.      [Illustration: SKIN ON STRETCHER.]    When stretching skunk and otter skins, if the weather is warm, split  the tails, open and tack flat. Split open half way all others that  have fur tails. Open pelts can be stretched in hoops made of one or  more poles an inch or so in diameter, and sewed in with a sack needle  and heavy twine.    In stretching do not get the pelt so wide that the fur looks thin, or  so long and narrow that it looks as if a horse had been hitched to  each end. Keep the natural shape of the animal as much as possible,  dry in a cool, airy place inside, or on the north side of a building  and away from fire.    Baling--here is where the expert trapper shows his craft, and in  baling you will see him wipe off all surplus fat and dirt and place  the heavy pelts on the outside of his pack. The lighter furs, such as  mink, marten, cat, etc., will be placed inside of the skins that are  heavier. For instance: From four to eight rats or mink, inside of a  fox or skunk. He will place the head of one to the tail of another,  the tails folded in. He now ties a cord tightly around each end,  placing them on a square of burlap, and with sack needle and twine  draws up the sides as tight as he can; then he folds in the ends and  sews up snug. Furs thus packed reach the market in good shape, and  not such as they would if crammed"]]]
