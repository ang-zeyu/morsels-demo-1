They were both laughing when Harry  came up.    \"That is the first time I have run a race,\" Jeanne said. \"I have  often wanted to try how fast I could run, but I have never ventured  to ask mademoiselle; she would have been horrified; but I don't  know how it is Virginie does not run faster.\"    \"Virginie has more flesh,\" Harry said smiling. \"She carries weight,  as we should say in England, while you have nothing to spare.    \"And she is three years older,\" Virginie put in. \"Jeanne is just  sixteen, and I am not thirteen yet; it makes a difference.\"    \"A great deal of difference,\" Harry agreed; \"but I don't think you  will ever run as fast as she does. That will not matter, you know,\"  he went on, as Virginie looked a little disappointed, \"because it  is not likely that you will ever race again; but Jeanne looks cut  out for a runner--just the build, you see--tall, and slim, and  active.\"    \"Yes,\" Virginie agreed frankly, \"Jeanne has walked ever so far and  never gets tired, while I get dreadfully tired; mamma says sometimes  I am quite a baby for my age.\"    \"Here are some people coming,\" Harry said; \"as we pass them please  talk with a little patois. Your good French would be suspicious.\"    All the children of the marquis, from their visits among the peasants'  cottages, had picked up a good deal of the Burgundian patois, and  when talking among themselves often used the expressions current  among the peasantry, and they now dropped into this talk, which  Harry had also acquired, as they passed a group of people coming  in from St. Denis.    They walked nearly as far as that town, and then turned and reached  the point where the party had separated, a few minutes before the  expiration of the appointed hour.    The two girls ran away to Louise Moulin, and chatted to her gaily,  while Harry walked up and down until, a quarter of an hour later,  the count and Marie made their appearance. The party stood talking  together for a few minutes; then adieus were said with a very pale  face, but with firmness on  Marie's part, and then the girls, with  Louise, turned their faces to Paris, while Harry and Victor remained  behind until they had got well on their way.    \"It was hard to deceive her,\" Victor said; \"but you were right.  She insisted that I should go. I seemed to resist, and urged that  it was cowardly for me to run away and to leave her here alone,  but she would not listen to it. She said it was a duty I owed to my  father and family to save myself, and that she should be wretched  if she thought I was in Paris in constant danger of arrest. Finally,  I had to give way to her, but it went against the grain, for even  while she was urging me she must have felt in her heart it would be  cowardly of me to go.  However, she will know some day that Victor  de Gisons is no coward.\"    \"I am sure it is better so,\" Harry said. \"She will have anxiety  enough to bear as to her father and mother; it is well that her  mind should be at ease concerning you.\"    \"In reality,\" Victor said, \"I shall be safer here than I should be  journeying towards the frontier. The papers this morning say that  in consequence of the escape of suspected persons, and of the  emigration of the nobles to join the enemies of France, orders  have been sent that the strictest scrutiny is to be exercised on  the roads leading to the frontier, over all strangers who may pass  through. All who cannot give a perfectly satisfactory account of  themselves and produce their papers en regle, are to be arrested  and sent to Paris. Therefore, my chance of getting through would be  small indeed, whereas while remaining in Paris there can be little  fear of detection.\"    \"Not much risk, I hope,\" Harry agreed; \"but there is no saying what  stringent steps they may take as time goes on.\"    Victor had taken a lodging a few houses from that of Harry.  Every  day the excitement in Paris increased, every day there were fresh  arrests until all the prisons became crowded to overflowing. It  was late in August; the Prussians were advancing and had laid siege  to Verdun, and terror was added to the emotions which excited to  madness the population of Paris. Black flags were hung from the  steeples, and Danton and his allies skilfully used the fear inspired  by the foreign enemy to add to the general hatred of the Royalists.    \"We Republicans,\" he said in the rostrum of the Assembly, \"are  exposed to two parties, that of the enemy without, that of the  Royalists within. There is a Royalist directory which sits secretly  at Paris and corresponds with the Prussian army. To frustrate it  we must terrify the Royalists.\"    The Assembly decreed death against all who directly or indirectly  refused to execute or hindered the orders given by the executive  power.  Rumours of conspiracy agitated Paris and struck alarm into  people's minds, while those who had friends within the prison walls  became more and more alarmed for their safety.    On the 28th of August orders were issued that all the inhabitants  of Paris were to stay in their houses in order that a visit might  be made by the delegates of the Commune to search for arms, of which  Danton had declared there were eighty thousand hidden in Paris, and  to search for suspected persons. As soon as the order was issued,  Harry and Victor went to their lodgings, and telling their landlords  that they had obtained work at the other end of town, paid their  rent and left the city, and for the next two days slept in the  woods.    They passed most of their time discussing projects for enabling  their friends to escape, for from the stringency of the steps taken,  and the violence of the Commune, they could no longer indulge in  the hopes that in a short time the prisoners against whom no serious  charge could be brought, would be released. At the same time they  could hardly persuade themselves that even such men as those who  now held the supreme power in their hands, could intend to take  extreme measures against so vast a number of prisoners as were now  in custody.    Victor and Harry knew that their friends had at first been taken to  the prison of Bicetre, but whether they were still confined there  they were of course ignorant. Still there was no reason to suppose  that they had been transferred to any of the other jails.    The Bicetre was, they had discovered, so strongly guarded that  neither force nor stratagem seemed available. The jailers were the  creatures of Danton and Robespierre, and any attempt to bribe them  would have been dangerous in the extreme. Victor proposed that,  as he as well as Harry was well provided with funds, for he had  brought to Paris all the money which the steward of the estates  had collected, they should recruit a band among the ruffians of the  city, and make a sudden attack upon the prison. But  Harry pointed  out that a numerous band would be required for such an enterprise,  and that among so many men one would be sure to turn traitor before  the time came.    \"I am ready to run all risks, Victor, but I see no chance of success  in it. The very first man we spoke to might denounce us, and if  we were seized there would be no one to look after the safety of  Mademoiselle de St. Caux and her sisters. My first duty is towards  them. I gave my promise to their father, and although it is not  probable that I can be of any use to them, I will at any rate, if  possible, be at hand should occasion arise.\"    On the evening of the 30th they returned to Paris, and took two  fresh apartments at a distance from their former quarters.    They were greatly anxious as to the safety of the girls, and Harry  at once hastened there, but found that all was well. The deputies,  learning from the landlord that only an old woman and her nieces  inhabited the upper story, and having a heavy task before them,  had only paid a short visit to the room, and had left after asking  Louise one or two questions.    The girls, however, were in a state of terrible anxiety as to  their parents, although Louise had avoided repeating to them the  sinister rumours which came to her ears when she was abroad doing  her marketing, for she now went out alone, thinking it better that  the girls should appear as little as possible in the streets.    \"It is terrible,\" Marie said. \"I think night and day of our father  and mother. Can nothing be done? Surely we might devise some means  for their escape.\"    \"I can think of nothing,\" Harry said. \"The prison is too strong to  be taken without a considerable force, and it would be impossible  to get that together.\"    \"Could we not bribe these wretches?\"    \"I have thought over that too,\" Harry replied; \"but, you see, it  would be necessary to get several men to work together. One might,  perhaps, bribe the man who has charge of the cell, but there would  be other warders, and the guard at the gate, and the latter are  changed every day. I do not see how that could possibly be done.\"    \"Would it be any use, do you think, were I to go to Danton or  Robespierre and plead with them for their lives? I would do that  willingly if you think there would be the slightest chance of  success.\"    \"It would be like a lamb going to plead with a wolf. You would only  attract attention to them.\"    \"Could you not get hold of one of these wretches and force him to  sign an order for their release?\" Jeanne suggested.    \"Eh!\" Harry exclaimed in surprise. \"Jeanne, you have the best  head of us all. That idea never occurred to me. Yes, that might be  possible. How stupid of me not to think of it!\"    \"Do not run into any danger, Harry,\" Marie said earnestly.  \"Such  a scheme could hardly succeed.\"    \"I don't know, mademoiselle. I think it might. I will think it over.  Of course there are difficulties, but I do not see why it should  not succeed.\"    \"Certainly it will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],[0,"The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#19)"],[1,"less than one pound in weight, and it has  no spots. The large trout has a few spots, these being particularly  brilliant in the mating season--September and October. The best time  to fish for this large species is in August and September. Both of  these unidentified trout will rise to the artificial fly, but in  fly-fishing I have never taken a specimen of the large species that  weighed over six pounds, the fish ranging beyond this weight favoring  small fish and red meat for bait. The waters are overstocked with the  large variety; the small unspotted variety is only in one stream.\"  Undoubtedly these two trout are odd forms of well-known species. Mr.  Dunham should send specimens of each to the United States Fish  Commission at Washington. The small trout will undoubtedly prove to be  the common mountain trout, whose peculiar habitat--the one stream Mr.  Dunham mentions--is responsible for its peculiar coloring. The large  fish that ranges up to forty-nine pounds is no doubt a form of lake  trout which has been known to attain a weight of eighty pounds and a  length of six feet.    =The Trout's Symmetry.=--\"Few humanly designed lines are more graceful  than those of the yacht. The trout is made up of such lines. It is a  submarine designed by the Almighty. It makes the most of the simple  elements of artistic beauty--symmetry of line, suggestive of agile  power, and delicately blended harmonies of rich color.\"--New York  _Evening Telegram_, editorial page, July 17, 1915.    =The Beautiful Trout.=--\"Of all the many species of trout,  _Salvelinus_ or _Salmo_, the brook trout, _fontinalis_, is by far the  most beautiful.\"--Charles Zibeon Southard.    =A Loving Trout.=--At the Wintergreen estate, Highland Lake, Winsted,  Conn., a brook trout was kept in captivity in a deep spring for seven  years. When the fish was fifteen inches in length two other brook  trout, a male and female, each ten inches long, were placed in the  spring to keep the old fellow company. He promptly fell in love with  the lady trout and killed and swallowed her escort.    =Albino Trout.=--The fish hatchery in St. Paul, Minn., had at one time  twenty thousand albino trout in stock. This species was discovered in  1893. There is something peculiar in Minnesota waters which aids  propagation of this species. The fish are white mottled with red and  yellow spots; the fins are white with red bands mottled with yellow.  The eyes are red and the trout has apparently a transparent skin so  that the bones are visible through it.    =Rainbow Trout.=--Dr. A. E. Buzard, of Hayward. Calif., fishing in the  Spokane River within ten minutes' walk of the city of Spokane, Wash.,  creeled eleven rainbow trout weighing, collectively, seventeen pounds.    =Rocky Mountain Trout.=--H. E. Peck, of Kenman. North Dakota, and H.  N. Stabeck, of Minneapolis. Minn., enjoyed good trout fishing last  summer in the Crow West country of the Rocky Mountains. A catch of  thirty-one trout weighed, collectively, fifty-one pounds. The largest  specimen weighed three and one fourth pounds.    =Flood-water Trout.=--When the trout stream is flooded, the trout find  plenty of food and they gorge themselves with worms, etc. Then they  refuse the Angler's bait for several days--\"trout feed on a rising  stream, not on a falling stream.\"--E. Curley.    =A Tame Trout.=--\"Sunbeam, the pet speckled trout in the fish hatchery  at Estes Park, is very fond of being stroked and petted, and will swim  around and rub itself against a person's hand whenever a chance is  given it.\"--Estes (Calif.) Correspondent New York _World_. I'll  warrant this fish only rubs its lips against the hand of man. No fish  will willingly allow its body to come in contact with a man's hand,  because fishes are covered with a slime that protects them when they  encounter rocks, logs, etc., and they naturally would not voluntarily  waste this valuable armor.    =Traits of the Trout.=--The brook trout (_Salvelinus fontinalis_),  using its tail with vigor and precision, will splash water into the  midst of a mass of flying insects (midge, black gnat, mosquito, etc.),  and thus disable these insects so that they will fall on the surface  of the water, where they become easy prey to the voracious trout.  _Fontinalis_ will also use his tail in striking to disable larger  insects (butterflies, beetles, cricket, potato-bug, etc.), and the  Angler's artificial flies when they are floating in or upon the water.    =Rainbow Trout.=--\"The rainbow takes the fly so readily that there is  no reason for resorting to grasshoppers, salmon eggs, or other bait.  It is a fish whose gameness will satisfy the most exacting of expert  Anglers, and whose readiness to take any proper line will please the  most impatient of inexperienced amateurs.\"--Prof. Evermann.    =The Tactful Trout.=--\"Trout are emblems of quiet, calm, and  gentleness, such as love not to be in troubled waters or to be tossed  to and fro by the blustering of wicked and malevolent spirits, but  rather live quiet at home than enjoy abundance through labor and  trouble.\"--Randal Holme.    =Double-headed Trout.=--A two-headed brook trout is the product of the  fish hatchery at Colebrook, N. H.    =Trout in Side Currents.=--\"As a general rule although many trout are  taken near, very near the rough, white water of a stream, they do not  as a rule lie in the very swiftest portions, but in adjacent and  quieter side currents.\"--Samuel G. Camp.    =The Angler's Joy.=--\"The brook trout always will be the Angler's  greatest joy, but the German brown trout [introduced in American  waters] and the rainbow trout add variety to the social life of the  streams.\"--Neal Brown.          CHAPTER XIX    THE ANGLER        \"I live not in myself, but I become      Portion of that around me; and to me      High mountains are a feeling, but the hum      Of human cities torture.\"            BYRON.        \"He'd eat his lunch in a minute;        He had no time to spare.      At a mounted fish in a window        He'd stop an hour to stare.\"           _Judge._      =The Lone Angler.=--\"The reason a man likes to go angling is that his  family doesn't like to go with him.\"--New York _Press_.    =The True Angler.=--\"If true Anglers, you are sure to be gentle; and  as the truly gentle are always virtuous, you must be happy. Let  neither prosperity nor adversity deaden 'the fresh feeling after  Nature' which the use of the rod and reel always heightens or confers.  Whether overladen with good fortune or suffering under the shocks of  adversity, forget not to take the magic wand and repair to the  murmuring waters. 'The music of those gentle moralists will steal into  your heart'; and, while invigorating physical energy, your souls will  be charmed and your minds soothed and tempered by the melody of  birds, the sights of nature, and the sounds of inferior animals above,  around, and beneath the enlivening waters. With rosy dreams and bright  streams, breezy morns and mellow skies, a light heart and a clear  conscience, may 'God speed ye well.'\"--Genio C. Scott, _Fishing in  American Waters_.    =Real vs. Rural Angler.=--The assertion that the bent-pin-fishing  country boy can catch more trout than the properly equipped Angler is  material of the comic papers. No impracticable boy, whether he be of  the country or of the city, can excel the correctly rigged, careful  Angler. The bent-pin youth of the farm may outfish the unskillful,  showy tyro from the city, but to compete with the scientific Angler he  would have about the same chance of outfishing the expert as a cow  would have fishing alongside of a mink.    =The Bicycle Angler.=--Mr. David Rivers writes me: \"I ride my wheel to  my favorite angling places regularly in the spring, summer, and autumn  times. The four-ounce rod takes up no noticeable space on the wheel,  and my leader-box and fly-book are easily carried in my pockets.\"    =The Determined Angler.=--\"There is peculiar pleasure in catching a  trout in a place where nobody thinks of looking for them, and at an  hour when everybody believes they cannot be caught.\"--Henry van Dyke.    =Dry and Wet Fly Angler.=--\"Startling as the statement may sound, it  is probably true that the really good wet-fly fisherman is a greater  rarity than the really good dry-fly man.\"--London _Field_.    =The Expert Fly Angler.=--\"A real expert with the wet-fly is a much  rarer bird than one with the dry.\"--London _Fishing Gazette_.    =The Finished Fly Angler.--= \" ... to be a finished wet-fly Angler one  must possess as much skill as the dry-fly fisherman.\"--Emlyn M. Gill.    =The Angler Body and Soul.=--\"To take fish is only the body of the  gentle art. Some of its real enjoyments are what the Angler sees and  feels--the echo of the running streams, the music of the birds, the  beauty of the flowers peering at him from every side, the bracing  atmosphere, the odor of pines, hemlocks, and spruce; the hush of the  woods at night, the morning song of the robin, and the revived  appetite.\"--A. L. H.    =Ye Gude Angler.=--\"Wha ever heard o' a gude angler being a bad or  indifferent man?\"--Noctes.    =The Merry Angler.=--\"And if the angler take fysshe: surely thenne is  there noo man merier than he is in his spyryte.\"--Dame Juliana Berners  (1496).    =The Religious Angler.=--\"The old man fished not for pastime, nor  solely for a subsistence, but as a solemn sacrament and withdrawal  from the world, just as the aged read their Bible.\"--Thoreau.    =The Satisfied Angler.=--Trout in the creel or no trout in the creel,  the Angler never complains of poor sport if there be trout in the  water he fishes, if the weather be pleasant, and the scenery fair.  Some fishermen judge their day by the actual catch of fish. The true  rodster loves the pursuit and capture of the fish, the bright day, and  the beautiful natural surroundings equally well.    =The Tidy Angler.=--I don't care if the fish I catch weigh only a  "]]]
