It must not be  supposed that this entire obliteration of the peloric structure in the  crossed plants can be accounted for by any incapacity of transmission; for  I raised a large bed of plants from the peloric Antirrhinum, artificially  fertilised by its own pollen, and sixteen plants, which alone survived the  winter, were all as perfectly peloric as the parent-plant. Here we have a  good instance of the wide difference between the inheritance of a character  and the power of transmitting it to crossed offspring. The crossed plants,  which perfectly resembled the common snapdragon, were allowed to sow  themselves, and, out of a hundred and twenty-seven seedlings, eighty-eight  proved to be common snapdragons, two were in an intermediate condition  between the peloric and normal state, {71} and thirty-seven were perfectly  peloric, having reverted to the structure of their one grandparent. This  case seems at first sight to offer an exception to the rule formerly given,  namely, that a character which is present in one form and latent in the  other is generally transmitted with prepotent force when the two forms are  crossed. For in all the Scrophulariaceae, and especially in the genera  Antirrhinum and Linaria, there is, as was shown in the last chapter, a  strong latent tendency to become peloric; and there is also, as we have  just seen, a still stronger tendency in all peloric plants to reacquire  their normal irregular structure. So that we have two opposed latent  tendencies in the same plants. Now, with the crossed Antirrhinums the  tendency to produce normal or irregular flowers, like those of the common  Snapdragon, prevailed in the first generation; whilst the tendency to  pelorism, appearing to gain strength by the intermission of a generation,  prevailed to a large extent in the second set of seedlings. How it is  possible for a character to gain strength by the intermission of a  generation, will be considered in the chapter on pangenesis.    On the whole, the subject of prepotency is extremely intricate,--from its  varying so much in strength, even in regard to the same character, in  different animals,--from its running either equally in both sexes, or, as  frequently is the case with animals, but not with plants, much stronger in  the one sex than the other,--from the existence of secondary sexual  characters,--from the transmission of certain characters being limited, as  we shall immediately see, by sex,--from certain characters not blending  together,--and, perhaps, occasionally from the effects of a previous  fertilisation on the mother. It is therefore not surprising that every one  hitherto has been baffled in drawing up general rules on the subject of  prepotency.    _Inheritance as limited by Sex._    New characters often appear in one sex, and are afterwards transmitted to  the same sex, either exclusively or in a much greater degree than to the  other. This subject is important, because with animals of many kinds in a  state of nature, both high and low in the scale, secondary sexual  characters, not in {72} any way directly connected with the organs of  reproduction, are often conspicuously present. With our domesticated  animals, also, these same secondary characters are often found to differ  greatly from the state in which they exist in the parent-species. And the  principle of inheritance as limited by sex shows how such characters might  have been first acquired and subsequently modified.        Dr. P. Lucas, who has collected many facts on this subject, shows[160]      that when a peculiarity, in no manner connected with the reproductive      organs, appears in either parent, it is often transmitted exclusively      to the offspring of the same sex, or to a much greater number of them      than of the opposite sex. Thus, in the family of Lambert, the horn-like      projections on the skin were transmitted from the father to his sons      and grandsons alone; so it has been with other cases of ichthyosis,      with supernumerary digits, with a deficiency of digits and phalanges,      and in a lesser degree with various diseases, especially with      colour-blindness, and a haemorrhagic diathesis, that is, an extreme      liability to profuse and uncontrollable bleeding from trifling wounds.      On the other hand, mothers have transmitted, during several      generations, to their daughters alone, supernumerary and deficient      digits, colour-blindness, and other peculiarities. So that we see that      the very same peculiarity may become attached to either sex, and be      long inherited by that sex alone; but the attachment in certain cases      is much more frequent to one than the other sex. The same peculiarities      also may be promiscuously transmitted to either sex. Dr. Lucas gives      other cases, showing that the male occasionally transmits his      peculiarities to his daughters alone, and the mother to her sons alone;      but even in this case we see that inheritance is to a certain extent,      though inversely, regulated by sex. Dr. Lucas, after weighing the whole      evidence, comes to the conclusion that every peculiarity, according to      the sex in which it first appears, tends to be transmitted in a greater      or lesser degree to that sex.        A few details from the many cases collected by Mr. Sedgwick,[161] may      be here given. Colour-blindness, from some unknown cause, shows itself      much oftener in males than in females; in upwards of two hundred cases      collected by Mr. Sedgwick, nine-tenths related to men; but it is      eminently liable to be transmitted through women. In the case given by      Dr. Earle, members of eight related families were affected during five      generations: these families consisted of sixty-one individuals, namely,      of thirty-two males, of whom nine-sixteenths were incapable of      distinguishing colour, and of twenty-nine females, of whom only      one-fifteenth were thus affected. {73} Although colour-blindness thus      generally clings to the male sex, nevertheless, in one instance in      which it first appeared in a female, it was transmitted during five      generations to thirteen individuals, all of whom were females. A      haemorrhagic diathesis, often accompanied by rheumatism, has been known      to affect the males alone during five generations, being transmitted,      however, through the females. It is said that deficient phalanges in      the fingers have been inherited by the females alone during ten      generations. In another case, a man thus deficient in both hands and      feet, transmitted the peculiarity to his two sons and one daughter; but      in the third generation, out of nineteen grandchildren, twelve sons had      the family defect, whilst the seven daughters were free. In ordinary      cases of sexual limitation, the sons or daughters inherit the      peculiarity, whatever it may be, from their father or mother, and      transmit it to their children of the same sex; but generally with the      haemorrhagic diathesis, and often with colour-blindness, and in some      other cases, the sons never inherit the peculiarity directly from their      fathers, but the daughters, and the daughters alone, transmit the      latent tendency, so that the sons of the daughters alone exhibit it.      Thus, the father, grandson, and great-great-grandson will exhibit a      peculiarity,--the grandmother, daughter, and great-granddaughter having      transmitted it in a latent state. Hence we have, as Mr. Sedgwick      remarks, a double kind of atavism or reversion; each grandson      apparently receiving and developing the peculiarity from his      grandfather, and each daughter apparently receiving the latent tendency      from her grandmother.        From the various facts recorded by Dr. Prosper Lucas, Mr. Sedgwick, and      others, there can be no doubt that peculiarities first appearing in      either sex, though not in any way necessarily or invariably connected      with that sex, strongly tend to be inherited by the offspring of the      same sex, but are often transmitted in a latent state through the      opposite sex.        Turning now to domesticated animals, we find that certain characters      not proper to the parent-species are often confined to, and inherited      by, one sex alone; but we do not know the history of the first      appearance of such characters. In the chapter on Sheep, we have seen      that the males of certain races differ greatly from the females in the      shape of their horns, these being absent in the ewes of some breeds, in      the development of fat in the tail in certain fat-tailed breeds, and in      the outline of the forehead. These differences, judging from the      character of the allied wild species, cannot be accounted for by      supposing that they have been derived from distinct parent-forms. There      is, also, a great difference between the horns of the two sexes in one      Indian breed of goats. The bull zebu is said to have a larger hump than      the cow. In the Scotch deer-hound the two sexes differ in size more      than in any other variety of the dog,[162] and, judging from analogy,      more than in the aboriginal parent-species. The peculiar colour called      tortoise-shell is very rarely seen in a male cat; the males of this      variety being of a rusty tint. A tendency to baldness in man before the      advent of old age is certainly inherited; and in the European, or at      least in the {74} Englishman, is an attribute of the male sex, and may      almost be ranked as an incipient secondary sexual character.        In various breeds of the fowl the males and females often differ      greatly; and these differences are far from being "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2892"],[0,"Irish Fairy Tales (#19)"],[1,"the great, mild hero.    Goll spoke to him across the table enthusiastically.    \"There is nothing wanting to this banquet, O Chief,\" said he.    And Fionn smiled back into that eye which seemed a well of tenderness  and friendship.    \"Nothing is wanting,\" he replied, \"but a well-shaped poem.\" A crier  stood up then, holding in one hand a length of coarse iron links and in  the other a chain of delicate, antique silver. He shook the iron chain  so that the servants and followers of the household should be silent,  and he shook the silver one so that the nobles and poets should hearken  also.    Fergus, called True-Lips, the poet of the Fianna-Finn, then sang of  Fionn and his ancestors and their deeds. When he had finished Fionn and  Oisi'n and Oscar and mac Lugac of the Terrible Hand gave him rare and  costly presents, so that every person wondered at their munificence, and  even the poet, accustomed to the liberality of kings and princes, was  astonished at his gifts.    Fergus then turned to the side of Goll mac Morna, and he sang of the  Forts, the Destructions, the Raids, and the Wooings of clann-Morna; and  as the poems succeeded each other, Goll grew more and more jovial and  contented. When the songs were finished Goll turned in his seat.    \"Where is my runner?\" he cried.    He had a woman runner, a marvel for swiftness and trust. She stepped  forward.    \"I am here, royal captain.\"    \"Have you collected my tribute from Denmark?\"    \"It is here.\"    And, with help, she laid beside him the load of three men of doubly  refined gold. Out of this treasure, and from the treasure of rings and  bracelets and torques that were with him, Goll mac Morna paid Fergus for  his songs, and, much as Fionn had given, Goll gave twice as much.    But, as the banquet proceeded, Goll gave, whether it was to harpers or  prophets or jugglers, more than any one else gave, so that Fionn became  displeased, and as the banquet proceeded he grew stern and silent.        CHAPTER II    [This version of the death of Uail is not correct. Also Cnocha is not in  Lochlann but in Ireland.]      The wonderful gift-giving of Goll continued, and an uneasiness and  embarrassment began to creep through the great banqueting hall.    Gentlemen looked at each other questioningly, and then spoke again on  indifferent matters, but only with half of their minds. The singers, the  harpers, and jugglers submitted to that constraint, so that every person  felt awkward and no one knew what should be done or what would happen,  and from that doubt dulness came, with silence following on its heels.    There is nothing more terrible than silence. Shame grows in that blank,  or anger gathers there, and we must choose which of these is to be our  master.    That choice lay before Fionn, who never knew shame.    \"Goll,\" said he, \"how long have you been taking tribute from the people  of Lochlann?\"    \"A long time now,\" said Goll.    And he looked into an eye that was stern and unfriendly.    \"I thought that my rent was the only one those people had to pay,\" Fionn  continued.    \"Your memory is at fault,\" said Goll.    \"Let it be so,\" said Fionn. \"How did your tribute arise?\"    \"Long ago, Fionn, in the days when your father forced war on me.\"    \"Ah!\" said Fionn.    \"When he raised the High King against me and banished me from Ireland.\"    \"Continue,\" said Fionn, and he held Goll's eye under the great beetle of  his brow.    \"I went into Britain,\" said Goll, \"and your father followed me there. I  went into White Lochlann (Norway) and took it. Your father banished me  thence also.\"    \"I know it,\" said Fionn.    \"I went into the land of the Saxons and your father chased me out of  that land. And then, in Lochlann, at the battle of Cnocha your father  and I met at last, foot to foot, eye to eye, and there, Fionn!\"    \"And there, Goll?\"    \"And there I killed your father.\"    Fionn sat rigid and unmoving, his face stony and terrible as the face of  a monument carved on the side of a cliff.    \"Tell all your tale,\" said he.    \"At that battle I beat the Lochlannachs. I penetrated to the hold of the  Danish king, and I took out of his dungeon the men who had lain  there for a year and were awaiting their deaths. I liberated fifteen  prisoners, and one of them was Fionn.\"    \"It is true,\" said Fionn.    Goll's anger fled at the word.    \"Do not be jealous of me, dear heart, for if I had twice the tribute I  would give it to you and to Ireland.\"    But at the word jealous the Chief's anger revived.    \"It is an impertinence,\" he cried, \"to boast at this table that you  killed my father.\"    \"By my hand,\" Goll replied, \"if Fionn were to treat me as his father did  I would treat Fionn the way I treated Fionn's father.\"    Fionn closed his eyes and beat away the anger that was rising within  him. He smiled grimly.    \"If I were so minded, I would not let that last word go with you, Goll,  for I have here an hundred men for every man of yours.\"    Goll laughed aloud.    \"So had your father,\" he said.    Fionn's brother, Cairell Whiteskin, broke into the conversation with a  harsh laugh.    \"How many of Fionn's household has the wonderful Goll put down?\" he  cried.    But Goll's brother, bald Cona'n the Swearer, turned a savage eye on  Cairell.    \"By my weapons,\" said he, \"there were never less than an hundred-and-one  men with Goll, and the least of them could have put you down easily  enough.\"    \"Ah?\" cried Cairell. \"And are you one of the hundred-and-one, old  scaldhead?\"    \"One indeed, my thick-witted, thin-livered Cairell, and I undertake to  prove on your hide that what my brother said was true and that what your  brother said was false.\"    \"You undertake that,\" growled Cairell, and on the word he loosed a  furious buffet at Con'an, which Cona'n returned with a fist so big that  every part of Cairell's face was hit with the one blow. The two then  fell into grips, and went lurching and punching about the great hall.  Two of Oscar's sons could not bear to see their uncle being worsted, and  they leaped at Cona'n, and two of Goll's sons rushed at them. Then Oscar  himself leaped up, and with a hammer in either hand he went battering  into the melee.    \"I thank the gods,\" said Cona'n, \"for the chance of killing yourself,  Oscar.\"    These two encountered then, and Oscar knocked a groan of distress out of  Cona'n. He looked appealingly at his brother Art og mac Morna, and that  powerful champion flew to his aid and wounded Oscar. Oisi'n, Oscar's  father, could not abide that; he dashed in and quelled Art Og. Then  Rough Hair mac Morna wounded Oisin and was himself tumbled by mac Lugac,  who was again wounded by Gara mac Morna.    The banqueting hall was in tumult. In every part of it men were giving  and taking blows. Here two champions with their arms round each other's  necks were stamping round and round in a slow, sad dance. Here were two  crouching against each other, looking for a soft place to hit. Yonder a  big-shouldered person lifted another man in his arms and threw him at a  small group that charged him. In a retired corner a gentleman stood in  a thoughtful attitude while he tried to pull out a tooth that had been  knocked loose.    \"You can't fight,\" he mumbled, \"with a loose shoe or a loose tooth.\"    \"Hurry up with that tooth,\" the man in front of him grum-bled, \"for I  want to knock out another one.\"    Pressed against the wall was a bevy of ladies, some of whom were  screaming and some laughing and all of whom were calling on the men to  go back to their seats.    Only two people remained seated in the hall.    Goll sat twisted round watching the progress of the brawl critically,  and Fionn, sitting opposite, watched Goll.    Just then Faelan, another of Fionn's sons, stormed the hall with three  hundred of the Fianna, and by this force all Goll's people were put out  of doors, where the fight continued.    Goll looked then calmly on Fionn.    \"Your people are using their weapons,\" said he.    \"Are they?\" Fionn inquired as calmly, and as though addressing the air.    \"In the matter of weapons--!\" said Goll.    And the hard-fighting pillar of battle turned to where his arms hung on  the wall behind him. He took his solid, well-balanced sword in his fist,  over his left arm his ample, bossy shield, and, with another side-look  at Fionn, he left the hall and charged irresistibly into the fray.    Fionn then arose. He took his accoutrements from the wall also and  strode out. Then he raised the triumphant Fenian shout and went into the  combat.    That was no place for a sick person to be. It was not the corner which  a slender-fingered woman would choose to do up her hair; nor was it the  spot an ancient man would select to think quietly in, for the tumult of  sword on sword, of axe on shield, the roar of the contending parties,  the crying of wounded men, and the screaming of frightened women  destroyed peace, and over all was the rallying cry of Goll mac Morna and  the great shout of Fionn.    Then Fergus True-Lips gathered about him all the poets of the Fianna,  and they surrounded the combatants. They began to chant and intone  long, heavy rhymes and incantations, until the rhythmic beating of their  voices covered even the noise of war, so that the men stopped hacking  and hewing, and let their weapons drop from their hands. These were  picked up by the poets and a reconciliation was effected between the two  parties.    But Fionn affirmed that he would make no peace with clann-Morna until  the matter had been judged by the king, Cormac mac Art, and by his  daughter Ailve, and by his son Cairbre of Ana Life' and by Fintan the  chief poet. Goll agreed that the affair should be submitted to that  court, and a day was appointed, a fortnight from that date, to meet  at Tara of the Kings for judgement. Then the hall was cleansed and the  banquet recommenced.    Of Fionn's people eleven hundred of men and women were dead, while of  Goll's"]]]
