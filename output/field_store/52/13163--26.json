The bobolink is a  rollicking, jolly fellow; the grackle is solemn, even morose. What a  queer family!

Both are mischievous rascals,  extraordinarily clever, with the most highly developed brains that any  of our birds possess. Some men of science believe that, because of  their brain power, they rightly belong at the head of the bird class  where the thrushes now stand; but who wishes to see a family of  songless rogues awarded the highest honours of the class _Aves?_    No bird is so well known to \"every child,\" so admired by artists, so  hated by farmers, as the crow, who flaps his leisurely way above the  cornfields with a _caw_ for friend and foe alike, not caring the least  for anyone's opinion of him, good or bad. Perhaps he knows his own  true worth better than the average farmer, who has persecuted him with  bounty laws, shotgun, and poison for generations. The crow keeps no  account of the immense numbers of grubs and larvae he picks up as he  walks after the plough every spring, nor does the farmer, who  nevertheless counts the corn stolen as fast as it is planted, and as  fast as it ripens, {154} you may be very sure, and puts a price on the  robber's head. Yet he knows that corn, dipped in tar before it is put  in the ground, will be left alone to sprout. But who is clever enough  to keep the crows out of the field in autumn?    How humiliated would humans feel if they realised what these knowing  birds must think of us when we set up in our cornfields the  absurd-looking scares they so calmly ignore! Some crows I know ate  every kernel off every ear around the scare-crow in a neighbour's  field, but touched no stalk very far from it, as much as to say: \"We  take your dare along with your corn, Mr. Silly. If the ox that  treadeth out his corn is entitled to his share of it, ought not we,  who saved it from grasshoppers, cutworms, May beetles and other pests,  be sharers in the profits?\" Granted; but what about eating the  farmer's young chickens and turkeys as well as the eggs and babies of  little song birds? At times, it must be admitted, the crow's heart is  certainly as dark as his feathers; he is as black as he is painted,  but happily such cannibalism is apt to be rare. Strange that a bird so  tenderly devoted to his own fledglings, should be so heartless to  others'!    Toward the end of winter, you may see a pair of crows carrying sticks  and trash to the top of some tall tree in the leafless woods, {155}  and there, in this bulky cradle, almost as bulky as a squirrel's nest,  they raise their family. Young crows may be easily tamed and they make  interesting, but very mischievous pets. It is only when crows are  nesting that they give up their social, flocking habit.    In winter, if the fields be lean, large picturesque flocks may be seen  at dawn streaking across the sky to distant beaches where they feed on  worms, refuse and small shellfish. More than one crow has been  watched, rising in the air with a clam or a mussel in his claws,  dropping it on a rock, then falling after it, as soon as the shell is  smashed, to feast upon its contents. The fish crow, a distinct  species, never found far inland, although not necessarily seen near  water, may be distinguished from our common crow by its hoarser _car_.  In some cases it joins its cousins on the beaches. With punctual  regularity at sundown, the flocks straggle back inland to go to sleep,  sometimes thousands of crows together in a single roost. Many birds  have more regular meal hours and bed-time than some children seem to  care for. Because crows eat almost anything they can find, and pick up  a good living where other birds, more finical or less clever, would  starve, they rarely need to migrate; but they are great rovers. There  is not a day in the year when you could not find a crow.    {156}    BLUE JAY    This vivacious, dashing fellow, harsh-voiced and noisy, cannot be  overlooked; for when a brightly coloured bird, about a foot long,  roves about your neighbourhood with a troop of screaming relatives,  everybody knows it. In summer he keeps quiet, but throws off all  restraint in autumn. Hear him hammering at an acorn some frosty  morning! How vigorous his motions, how alert and independent! His  beautiful military blue, black and white feathers, and crested head,  give him distinction.    He is certainly handsome. But is his beauty only skin deep? Does it  cover, in reality, a multitude of sins? Shocking stories of murder in  the song bird's nest have branded the blue jay with quite as bad a  name as the crow's. The brains of fledglings, it has been said, are  his favourite tid-bits. But happily scientists, who have turned the  searchlight on his deeds, find that his sins have been very greatly  exaggerated. Remains of young birds were found in only two out of  nearly three hundred blue jays' stomachs analysed. Birds' eggs are  more apt to be sucked by both jays and squirrels than are the  nestlings to be eaten. Do you ever enjoy an egg for breakfast? Fruit,  grain, thin-shelled nuts, and the larger seeds of trees {157} and  shrubs, gathered for the most part in Nature's open store-room, not in  man's, are what the jay chiefly delights in; and these he hides away,  squirrel-fashion, to provide for the rainy day. More than half of all  his food in summer consists of insects, so you see he is then quite as  useful as his cousin, the crow.    Jays are fearful teasers. How they love to chase about some poor,  blinking, bewildered owl, in the daylight! _Jay-jay-jay_, you may hear  them scream through the woods. They mimic the hawk's cry for no better  reason, perhaps, than that they may laugh at the panic into which  timid little birds are thrown at the terrifying sound. A pet jay I  knew could whistle up the stupid house-dog, who was fooled again and  again. This same jay used to carry all its beech nuts to a piazza  roof, wedge them between the shingles, and open them there with ease.  An interesting array of hair pins, matches, buttons, a thimble and a  silver spoon were raked out of his favourite cache under the eaves.      CANADA JAY    _Called also: Whiskey Jack; Moose-bird; Meat-bird_    Anyone who has camped in the northern United States and over the  Canadian border knows that the crow and blue jay have a rogue for  {158} a cousin in this sleek, bold thief, the Canada jay. He is a  fluffy, big, gray bird, without a crest, with a white throat and  forehead and black patch at the back of his neck. This rascal will  walk alone or with his gang into your tent, steal your candles,  matches, venison, and collar-buttons before your eyes, or help himself  to the fish bait while he perches on your canoe, or laugh at you with  an impudent _ca-ca-ca_ from the mountain ash tree where he and his  friends are feasting on the berries; then glide to the ground to slyly  pick a trap set for mink or marten. Fortunate the trapper who, on his  return, does not find either bait gone, or game damaged.    Fearless, amazingly hardy (having been hatched in zero weather),  mischievous and clever to a maddening degree, this jay, like his  cousins, compels admiration, although we know all three to be rogues.

If the bird has a  white band across the end of its tail it is probably the fearless  kingbird. If the feathers on top of its head look as if they had been  brushed the wrong way into a pointed crest; moreover, if some chestnut  colour shows in its tail when spread, and its pearly gray breast  shades into yellow underneath, you are looking at the noisy \"wild  Irishman\" of birddom, the crested flycatcher. Confiding Phoebe wears  the plainest of dull clothes with a still darker, dusky crown cap, and  a line of white on her outer tail feathers. She and the plaintive wood  pewee, who has two indistinct whitish bars across her extra-long  wings, are scarcely larger than an English sparrow; while the least  flycatcher, who calls himself _Chebec_, is, as you may suppose, the  smallest member of the tribe to leave the tropics and spend the summer  with us. Male and female members of this {162} family wear similar  clothes, fortunately for \"every child\" who tries to identify them.    You can tell a flycatcher at sight by the way he collects his dinner.  Perhaps he will be sitting quietly on the limb of a tree or on a fence  as if dreaming, when suddenly off he dashes into the air, clicks his  broad bill sharply over a winged insect, flutters an instant, then  wheels about and returns to his favourite perch to wait for the next  course to fly by. He may describe fifty such loops in mid-air and make  as many fatal snap-shots before his hunger is satisfied. A swallow or  a swift would keep constantly on the wing; a vireo would hunt  leisurely among the foliage; a warbler would restlessly flit about the  tree hunting for its dinner among the leaves; but the dignified,  dexterous flycatcher, like a hawk, waits patiently on his lookout for  a dinner to fly toward him. \"All things come to him"]]]
