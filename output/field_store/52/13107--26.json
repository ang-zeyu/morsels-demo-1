Well, it  happened that about that time a Jewish conscript--born at  Berdiezow--escaped over the frontier near Hussintyn, and was sent on to  Barnow from thence. The community did what they could for him, and a  rich, kind-hearted man, Chaim Gruenstein, father-in-law of Moses  Freudenthal, took him into his service as groom.    \"The Russian Government of course wanted to get the fugitive back into  their hands, and our officials received orders to look for him.    \"Our _mandatar_ got the same order as the others. He at once sent for  the elders of our congregation and questioned them on the subject. They  were inwardly much afraid, but outwardly they made no sign, and denied  all knowledge of the stranger. It was on the eve of the Day of Atonement  that this took place--and how could they have entered the presence of  God that evening if they had betrayed their brother in the faith? So  they remained firm in spite of the agent's threats and rage. When he  perceived that they either knew nothing or would confess nothing, he let  them go with these dark words of warning: 'It will be the worse for you  if I find the youth in Barnow. You do not know me yet, but--I swear that  you shall know me then!'    \"The elders went home, and I need hardly tell you that the hearts of the  whole community sank on hearing Wollmann's threat. The young man they  were protecting was a hard-working honest fellow, but even if he had  been different, it wouldn't have mattered--he was a Jew, and none of  them would have forsaken him in his adversity. If he remained in Barnow,  the danger to him and to all of them was great, for the _mandatar_ would  find him out sooner or later--nothing could be kept from him for long.  But if they sent him away without a passport or naturalization papers,  he would of course be arrested very soon. After a long consultation,  Chaim Gruenstein had a happy inspiration. One of his relations was a  tenant-farmer in Marmaros, in Hungary. The young man should be sent to  him on the night following the Day of Atonement, and should be desired  to make the whole journey by night for fear of discovery. In this  manner he could best escape from his enemies.    \"They all agreed that the idea was a good one, and then partook with  lightened hearts of the feast which was to strengthen them for their  fast on the Day of Atonement. Dusk began to fall. The synagogue was  lighted up with numerous wax-candles, and the whole community hastened  there with a broken and a contrite heart to confess their sins before  God; for at that solemn fast we meet to pray to the Judge of all men to  be gracious to us, and of His mercy to forgive us our trespasses. The  women were all dressed in white, and the men in white grave-clothes.  Chaim Gruenstein and his household were there to humble themselves before  the Lord, and among them was the poor fugitive, who was trembling in  every limb with fear lest he should fall into the hands of his enemies.    \"All were assembled, and divine service was about to begin. Little  Mendele had placed the flat of his hand upon his throat in order to  bring out the first notes of the 'Kol-Nidra' with fitting tremulousness,  when he was interrupted by a disturbance at the door. The entrance of  the synagogue was beset by the Graf's men-at-arms, and Herr Wollmann was  seen walking up the aisle between the rows of seats. The intruder  advanced until he stood beside the ark of the covenant and quite close  to little Mendele, who drew back in terror, but the elders of the  congregation came forward with quiet humility.    \"'I know that the young man is here,' said Wollmann; 'will you give him  up now?'    \"The men were silent.    \"'Very well,' continued the _mandatar_, 'I see that kindness has no  effect upon you. I will arrest him after service when you leave the  synagogue. And I warn you that both he and you shall have cause to  remember this evening. But now, don't let me disturb you; go on with  your prayers. I have time to wait.'    \"A silence as of death reigned in the synagogue. It was at length broken  by a shrill cry from the women's gallery. The whole congregation was at  first stupefied with fear. But after a time every one began to regain  his self-command, and to raise his eyes to God for help. Without a word  each went back to his seat.    \"Little Mendele trembled in every limb; but all at once he drew himself  up and began to sing the 'Kol-Nidra,' that ancient simple melody, which  no one who has ever heard can forget. His voice at first sounded weak  and quavering, but it gradually gained strength and volume, filled the  edifice, thrilled the hearts of all the worshipers, and rose up to the  throne of God. Little Mendele never again sang as he did that evening.  He seemed as though he were inspired. When he was singing in that  marvelous way, he ceased to be the absurd little man he had always  hitherto been, and became a priest pleading with God for his people. He  reminded us of the former glories of our race, and then of the many,  many centuries of ignominy and persecution that had followed. In the  sound of his voice we could hear the story of the way in which we had  been chased from place to place--never suffered to rest long anywhere;  of how we were the poorest of the poor, the most wretched among the  miserable of the earth; and how the days of our persecution were not yet  ended, but ever new oppressors rose against us and ground us down with  an iron hand. The tale of our woes might be heard in his voice--of our  unspeakable woes and our innumerable tears. But there was something else  to be heard in it too. It told us in triumphant tones of our pride in  our nation, and of our confidence and _trust in God_. Ah me! I can never  describe the way little Mendele sang that evening; he made us weep for  our desolation, and yet restored our courage and our trust....    \"The women were sobbing aloud when he ceased; even the men were weeping;  but little Mendele hid his face in his hands and fainted.    \"At the beginning of the service Wollmann had kept his eyes fixed on the  ark of the covenant, but as it went on he had to turn away. He was very  pale, and his knees shook so that, strong man as he was, he could hardly  stand. His eyes shone as though through tears. With trembling steps and  bowed head he slowly passed Mendele, and walked down the aisle to the  entrance-door. Then he gave the soldiers a sign to follow him.    \"Every one guessed what had happened, but no one spoke of it.    \"He sent for Chaim Gruenstein on the day after the fast, and, giving him  a blank passport, said, 'It will perhaps be useful to you.'    \"From that time forward he treated us with greater toleration; but his  power did not last long. The peasants, whom he had formerly oppressed,  rose against him in the spring of the Great Year, and put him to  death....\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Now, my friends, this is the story of the Two Saviours of the Jews of  Barnow. Let it teach you to think twice before saying who is great and  who is small, who is weak and who is mighty!\"          \"THE CHILD OF ATONEMENT.\"    (1872.)      The heroine of this story is a child. Her name was Lea, and at the time  of which the story treats, she was four years old. She had glossy black  hair and large dark eyes. Her eyes, however, were not bright, for it  seemed as if a shadow lay on her pale delicate face. She was the child  of poor people, and had only one frock, which was patched all over--the  same for Saturdays as for the other days of the week. It was hardly  possible to distinguish the original color of the yellow gabardine.    But that was not the cause of the sadness of her expression, for what  did Lea know of poverty? Every day her appetite was satisfied, or at any  rate half satisfied; and every day she played in the sunshine as long as  she liked.    She had the most beautiful playground that could be desired--large,  green, quiet, and full of countless flowers, and of elders bowing their  blossom-laden heads over many resting-places. Lea's playground was the  Jewish cemetery at Barnow. It was strange to see the serious child  wandering among the graves, or sitting on a stone watching the merry  cockchafers running about in the grass; but this was not the cause of  the shade of sadness on her face.    What did Lea know of death? She knew that her father was dead, and that  death meant sleep, and never, never to be hungry more. How, then, could  the daily sight of the graves have saddened her?...    No, it had not; and the Jews of Barnow were also wrong when they said,  \"The child is a child of atonement; how can its face be otherwise than  sad?\"    No; every trace of suffering in her pale face was an inheritance.    Poor Miriam Goldstein had borne the child beneath a heart that was heavy  with grief and sorrow. Bitter tears had fallen upon the face of the  little creature that lay upon her bosom. Such tears dry, but they leave  their traces. Lea bore upon her countenance the marks of the tears shed  by her mother.    Later, as the child grew older, her mother ceased to weep. The poor  widow had no time for tears. She had to work all day long, and when she  came home at night, she sank exhausted on her bed. Even when she  wakened, and mused upon her hard sad lot, she did not weep, for she  could always comfort herself with the reflection, \"Thank God! the child  and I are not obliged to beg or starve. Thank God! the child is well.\"    \"The child is well.\"    Miriam Goldstein, widow of the gravedigger at Barnow, who received from  the community as her widow's portion the grant of a little room in the  cottage near the gate of the cemetery, and who worked in other people's  houses all day long, did not weep during any sleepless hours that might  come to her at night, because--her child was well. I ask all  mothers--had Miriam Goldstein any cause for tears?    The days came and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3462"],[0,"More Hunting Wasps (#19)"],[1,"herself.    But, where the Gad-fly has got off, the Midge remains. The winged Aphis  also remains, the Ant, the Mosquito and many another of the smaller  insects. What does the plant do with its captures? Of what use are  these trophies of corpses hanging by a leg or a wing? Does the  vegetable bird-limer, with its sticky rings, derive advantage from these  death-struggles? A Darwinian, remembering the carnivorous plants, would  say yes. As for me, I don't believe a word of it. The Oporto silene is  ringed with bands of gum. Why? I don't know. Insects are caught in these  snares. Of what use are they to the plant? Why, none at all; and that's  all about it. I leave to others, bolder than myself, the fantastic idea  of taking these annular exudations for a digestive fluid which will  reduce the captured Midges to soup and make them serve to feed the  Silene. Only I warn them that the insects sticking to the plant do not  dissolve into broth, but shrivel, quite uselessly, in the sun.    Let us return to the Tachytes, who is also a victim of the vegetable  snare. With a sudden flight, a huntress arrives, carrying her drooping  prey. She grazes the Silene's lime-twigs too closely. Behold the Mantis  caught by the abdomen. For twenty minutes at least the Wasp, still on  the wing, tugs at her, tugging again and again, to overcome the cause of  the hitch and release the spoil. The hauling-method, a continuation of  the flight, comes to nothing; and no other is attempted. At last the  insect wearies and leaves the Mantis hanging to the Silene.    Now or never was the moment for the intervention of that tiny glimmer  of reason which Darwin so generously grants to animals. Do not, if you  please, confound reason with intelligence, as people are too prone to  do. I deny the one; and the other is incontestable, within very modest  limits. It was, I said, the moment to reason a little, to discover the  cause of the hitch and to attack the difficulty at its source. For the  Tachytes the matter was of the simplest. She had but to grab the body  by the skin of the abdomen immediately above the spot caught by the glue  and to pull it towards her, instead of persevering in her flight without  releasing the neck. Simple though this mechanical problem was, the  insect was unable to solve it, because she was not able to trace the  effect back to the cause, because she did not even suspect that the  stoppage had a cause.    Ants doting on sugar and accustomed to cross a foot-bridge in order  to reach the warehouse are absolutely prevented from doing so when the  bridge is interrupted by a slight gap. They would only need a few grains  of sand to fill the void and restore the causeway. They do not for a  moment dream of it, plucky navvies though they be, capable of raising  miniature mountains of excavated soil. We can get them to give us an  enormous cone of earth, an instinctive piece of work, but we shall never  obtain the juxtaposition of three grains of sand, a reasoned piece of  work. The Ant does not reason, any more than the Tachytes.    If you bring up a tame Fox and set his platter of food before him, this  creature of a thousand tricks confines himself to tugging with all his  might at the leash which keeps him a step or two from his dinner. He  pulls as the Tachytes pulls, exhausts himself in futile efforts and then  lies down, with his little eyes leering fixedly at the dish. Why does he  not turn round? This would increase his radius; and he could reach then  the food with his hind-foot and pull it towards him. The idea never  occurs to him. Yet another animal deprived of reason.    Friend Bull, my Dog, is no better-endowed, despite his quality as a  candidate for humanity. In our excursions through the woods, he happens  to get caught by the paw in a wire snare set for rabbits. Like the  Tachytes, he tugs at it obstinately and only pulls the noose tighter.  I have to release him when he does not himself succeed in snapping the  wire by his hard pulling. When he tries to leave the room, if the two  leaves of the door are just ajar, he contents himself with pushing his  muzzle, like a wedge, into the too narrow aperture. He moves forward,  pushing in the direction which he wishes to take. His simple, dog-like  method has one unfailing result: the two leaves of the door, when  pushed, merely shut still closer. It would be easy for him to pull one  of them towards him with his paw, which would make the passage wider;  but this would be a movement backward, contrary to his natural impulse;  and so he does not think of it. Yet another creature that does not  reason.    The Tachytes, who stubbornly persists in tugging at her limed Mantis  and refuses to acknowledge any other method of wresting her from the  Silene's snare, shows us the Wasp in an unflattering light. What a very  poor intellect! The insect becomes only the more wonderful, therefore,  when we consider its supreme talent as an anatomist. Many a time I have  insisted upon the incomprehensible wisdom of instinct; I do so again at  the risk of repeating myself. An idea is like a nail: it is not to be  driven in save by repeated blows. By hitting it again and again, I hope  to make it enter the most rebellious brains. This time I shall attack  the problem from the other end, that is, I shall first allow human  knowledge to have its say and shall then interrogate the insect's  knowledge.    The outward structure of the Praying Mantis would of itself be enough to  teach us the arrangement of the nerve-centres which the Tachytes has to  injure in order to paralyse its victim, which is destined to be devoured  alive but harmless. A narrow and very long prothorax divides the front  pair of legs from the two hinder pairs. There must therefore be an  isolated ganglion in front and two ganglia, close to each other,  about two-fifths of an inch back. Dissection confirms this forecast  completely. It shows us three fairly bulky thoracic ganglia, arranged in  the same manner as the legs. The first which actuates the fore-legs, is  placed opposite their roots. It is the largest of the three. It is also  the most important, for it presides over the insect's weapons, over the  two powerful arms, toothed like saws and ending in harpoons. The other  two, divided from the first by the whole length of the prothorax, each  face the origin of the corresponding legs; consequently they are very  near each other. Beyond them are the abdominal ganglia, which I pass  over in silence, as the operating insect does not have to trouble about  them. The movements of the belly are mere pulsations and are in no way  dangerous.    Now let us do a little reasoning on behalf of our non-reasoning insect.  The sacrificer is weak; the victim is comparatively powerful. Three  strokes of the lancet must abolish all offensive movement. Where will  the first stroke be delivered? In front is a real engine of warfare, a  pair of powerful shears with toothed jaws. Let the fore-arm close  upon the upper arm; and the imprudent insect, crushed between the two  saw-blades, will be torn to pieces; wounded by the terminal hook, it  will be eviscerated. This ferocious mechanism is the great danger; it is  this that must be mastered at the outset, at the risk of life; the rest  is less urgent. The first blow of the stylet, cautiously directed, is  therefore aimed at the lethal fore-legs, which imperil the vivisector's  own existence. Above all, there must be no hesitation. The blow must be  accurate then and there, or the sacrificer will be caught in the  vice and perish. The two other pairs of legs present no danger to the  operator, who might neglect them if she had only her own security to  think of; but the surgeon is operating with a view to the egg, which  demands complete immobility in the provisions. Their centres of  innervation will therefore be stabbed as well, with the leisure which  the Mantis, now put out of action, permits. These legs, as well as their  nervous centres, are situated very far behind the first point attacked.  There is a long neutral interval, that of the prothorax, into which it  is quite useless to drive the sting. This interval has to be crossed; by  a backward movement conforming with the secrets of the victim's internal  anatomy, the second ganglion must be reached and then its neighbour, the  third. In short, the surgical operation may be formulated thus: a  first stab of the lancet in front; a considerable movement to the rear,  measuring about two-fifths of an inch; lastly, two lancet-thrusts at  two points very close together. Thus speaks the science of man; thus  counsels reason, guided by anatomical structure. Having said this much  let us observe the insect's practice.    There is no difficulty about seeing the Tachytes operate in our  presence; we have only to resort to the method of substitution, which  has already done me so much service, that is, to deprive the huntress of  her prey and at once to give her, in exchange, a living Mantis of about  the same size. This substitution is impracticable with the majority  of the Tachytes, who reach the threshold of their dwelling in a single  flight and at once vanish underground with their game. A few of them,  from time to time, harassed perhaps by their burden, chance to alight at  a short distance from their burrow, or even drop their prey. I profit by  these rare occasions to witness the tragedy.    The dispossessed Wasp recognizes instantly, from the proud bearing of  the substituted Mantis, that she is no longer embracing and carrying off  an inoffensive carcase. Her hovering, hitherto silent, develops a buzz,  perhaps to overawe the victim; her flight becomes an extremely rapid  oscillation, always behind the quarry. It is as who should say the quick  movement of a pendulum swinging without a wire to hang from. The Mantis,  however, lifts herself boldly upon her four hind-legs; she raises the  fore-part of her body,"]]]
