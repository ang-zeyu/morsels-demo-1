I remember, too, that my spirits were very low, for one of my  boys was ill, and we feared we should lose him. I had been watching at  his bed-side all the evening while his mother slept; for she had sat  up with him the night before. I had been watching, and went out for a  little fresh air, the day had been very sultry. As I walked under the  shades and mused, I heard music at a distance, and thought it was  Claude playing upon his flute, as he often did of a fine evening, at  the cottage door. But, when I came to a place where the trees opened, (I  shall never forget it!) and stood looking up at the north-lights, which  shot up the heaven to a great height, I heard all of a sudden such  sounds!--they came so as I cannot describe. It was like the music of  angels, and I looked up again almost expecting to see them in the sky.  When I came home, I told what I had heard, but they laughed at me, and  said it must be some of the shepherds playing on their pipes, and I  could not persuade them to the contrary. A few nights after, however, my  wife herself heard the same sounds, and was as much surprised as I was,  and Father Denis frightened her sadly by saying, that it was music come  to warn her of her child's death, and that music often came to houses  where there was a dying person.'    Emily, on hearing this, shrunk with a superstitious dread entirely new  to her, and could scarcely conceal her agitation from St. Aubert.    'But the boy lived, monsieur, in spite of Father Denis.'    'Father Denis!' said St. Aubert, who had listened to 'narrative old age'  with patient attention, 'are we near a convent, then?'    'Yes, sir; the convent of St. Clair stands at no great distance, on the  sea shore yonder.'    'Ah!' said St. Aubert, as if struck with some sudden remembrance, 'the  convent of St. Clair!' Emily observed the clouds of grief, mingled with  a faint expression of horror, gathering on his brow; his countenance  became fixed, and, touched as it now was by the silver whiteness of  the moon-light, he resembled one of those marble statues of a monument,  which seem to bend, in hopeless sorrow, over the ashes of the dead,  shewn         by the blunted light   That the dim moon through painted casements lends.*       * The Emigrants.      'But, my dear sir,' said Emily, anxious to dissipate his thoughts, 'you  forget that repose is necessary to you. If our kind host will give me  leave, I will prepare your bed, for I know how you like it to be made.'  St. Aubert, recollecting himself, and smiling affectionately, desired  she would not add to her fatigue by that attention; and La Voisin, whose  consideration for his guest had been suspended by the interests  which his own narrative had recalled, now started from his seat, and,  apologizing for not having called Agnes from the green, hurried out of  the room.    In a few moments he returned with his daughter, a young woman of  pleasing countenance, and Emily learned from her, what she had not  before suspected, that, for their accommodation, it was necessary  part of La Voisin's family should leave their beds; she lamented this  circumstance, but Agnes, by her reply, fully proved that she inherited,  at least, a share of her father's courteous hospitality. It was settled,  that some of her children and Michael should sleep in the neighbouring  cottage.    'If I am better, to-morrow, my dear,' said St. Aubert when Emily  returned to him, 'I mean to set out at an early hour, that we may rest,  during the heat of the day, and will travel towards home. In the present  state of my health and spirits I cannot look on a longer journey with  pleasure, and I am also very anxious to reach La Vallee.' Emily, though  she also desired to return, was grieved at her father's sudden wish to  do so, which she thought indicated a greater degree of indisposition  than he would acknowledge. St. Aubert now retired to rest, and Emily to  her little chamber, but not to immediate repose. Her thoughts returned  to the late conversation, concerning the state of departed spirits; a  subject, at this time, particularly affecting to her, when she had every  reason to believe that her dear father would ere long be numbered with  them. She leaned pensively on the little open casement, and in deep  thought fixed her eyes on the heaven, whose blue unclouded concave was  studded thick with stars, the worlds, perhaps, of spirits, unsphered  of mortal mould. As her eyes wandered along the boundless aether, her  thoughts rose, as before, towards the sublimity of the Deity, and to the  contemplation of futurity. No busy note of this world interrupted the  course of her mind; the merry dance had ceased, and every cottager had  retired to his home. The still air seemed scarcely to breathe upon the  woods, and, now and then, the distant sound of a solitary sheep-bell,  or of a closing casement, was all that broke on silence. At length, even  this hint of human being was heard no more. Elevated and enwrapt, while  her eyes were often wet with tears of sublime devotion and solemn awe,  she continued at the casement, till the gloom of mid-night hung over the  earth, and the planet, which La Voisin had pointed out, sunk below the  woods. She then recollected what he had said concerning this planet, and  the mysterious music; and, as she lingered at the window, half  hoping and half fearing that it would return, her mind was led to the  remembrance of the extreme emotion her father had shewn on mention of  the Marquis La Villeroi's death, and of the fate of the Marchioness,  and she felt strongly interested concerning the remote cause of this  emotion. Her surprise and curiosity were indeed the greater, because she  did not recollect ever to have heard him mention the name of Villeroi.    No music, however, stole on the silence of the night, and Emily,  perceiving the lateness of the hour, returned to a scene of fatigue,  remembered that she was to rise early in the morning, and withdrew from  the window to repose.        CHAPTER VII           Let those deplore their doom,   Whose hope still grovels in this dark sojourn.   But lofty souls can look beyond the tomb,   Can smile at fate, and wonder how they mourn.   Shall Spring to these sad scenes no more return?   Is yonder wave the sun's eternal bed?--   Soon shall the orient with new lustre burn,   And Spring shall soon her vital influence shed,   Again attune the grove, again adorn the mead!       BEATTIE    Emily, called, as she had requested, at an early hour, awoke, little  refreshed by sleep, for uneasy dreams had pursued her, and marred the  kindest blessing of the unhappy. But, when she opened her casement,  looked out upon the woods, bright with the morning sun, and inspired the  pure air, her mind was soothed. The scene was filled with that cheering  freshness, which seems to breathe the very spirit of health, and she  heard only sweet and PICTURESQUE sounds, if such an expression may be  allowed--the matin-bell of a distant convent, the faint murmur of the  sea-waves, the song of birds, and the far-off low of cattle, which  she saw coming slowly on between the trunks of trees. Struck with  the circumstances of imagery around her, she indulged the pensive  tranquillity which they inspired; and while she leaned on her window,  waiting till St. Aubert should descend to breakfast, her ideas arranged  themselves in the following lines:    THE FIRST HOUR OF MORNING     How sweet to wind the forest's tangled shade,    When early twilight, from the eastern bound,   Dawns on the sleeping landscape in the glade,    And fades as morning spreads her blush around!     When ev'ry infant flower, that wept in night,    Lifts its chill head soft glowing with a tear,   Expands its tender blossom to the light,    And gives its incense to the genial air.     How fresh the breeze that wafts the rich perfume,    And swells the melody of waking birds;   The hum of bees, beneath the verdant gloom,    And woodman's song, and low of distant herds!     Then, doubtful gleams the mountain's hoary head,    Seen through the parting foliage from afar;   And, farther still, the ocean's misty bed,    With flitting sails, that partial sun-beams share.     But, vain the sylvan shade--the breath of May,    The voice of music floating on the gale,   And forms, that beam through morning's dewy veil,   If health no longer bid the heart be gay!   O balmy hour! 'tis thine her wealth to give,   Here spread her blush, and bid the parent live!    Emily now heard persons moving below in the cottage, and presently the  voice of Michael, who was talking to his mules, as he led them forth  from a hut adjoining. As she left her room, St. Aubert, who was now  risen, met her at the door, apparently as little restored by sleep as  herself. She led him down stairs to the little parlour, in which they  had supped on the preceding night, where they found a neat breakfast set  out, while the host and his daughter waited to bid them good-morrow.    'I envy you this cottage, my good friends,' said St. Aubert, as he met  them, 'it is so pleasant, so quiet, and so neat; and this air, that one  breathes--if any thing could restore lost health, it would surely be  this air.'    La Voisin bowed gratefully, and replied, with the gallantry of a  Frenchman, 'Our cottage may be envied, sir, since you and Mademoiselle  have honoured it with your presence.' St. Aubert gave him a friendly  smile for his compliment, and sat down to a table, spread with cream,  fruit, new cheese, butter, and coffee. Emily, who had observed her  father with attention and thought he looked very ill, endeavoured to  persuade him to defer travelling till the afternoon; but he seemed very  anxious to be at home, and his anxiety he expressed repeatedly, and with  an earnestness that was unusual with him.

We are now just about over the southern end of  Hudson Bay, heading down and south to join in making a vertical Fleet  Formation ... no more waves coming, but they say to expect attacks from  low-flying combat rockets--there goes the alert! On your toes,  fellows--but there isn't a thing on Sector A's screen....\"    There wasn't. Since the CR10685 was diving downward and southward, there  wouldn't be. Nevertheless, some observer aboard that rocket saw that  atomic missile coming. Some Fire Control Officer yelled orders; some  Technos did their best--and failed.    And such is the violence of nuclear fission; so utterly incomprehensible  is its speed, that Theodore K. Kinnison died without realizing that  anything whatever was happening to his ship or to him.           *       *       *       *       *    _Gharlane of Eddore looked upon ruined Earth, his handiwork, and found  it good. Knowing that it would be many of hundreds of Tellurian years  before that planet would again require his personal attention, he went  elsewhere; to Rigel Four, to Palain Seven, and to the solar system of  Velantia, where he found that his creatures the Overlords were not  progressing according to schedule. He spent quite a little time there,  then searched minutely and fruitlessly for evidence of inimical activity  within the Innermost Circle._    _And upon far Arisia a momentous decision was made: the time had come to  curb sharply the hitherto unhampered Eddorians._    \"_We are ready, then, to war openly upon them?\" Eukonidor asked,  somewhat doubtfully. \"Again to cleanse the planet Tellus of dangerous  radioactives and of too-noxious forms of life is of course a simple  matter. From our protected areas in North America a strong but  democratic government can spread to cover the world. That government can  be extended easily enough to include Mars and Venus. But Gharlane, who  is to operate as Roger, who has already planted, in the Adepts of North  Polar Jupiter, the seeds of the Jovian Wars...._\"    \"_Your visualization is sound, youth. Think on._\"    \"_Those interplanetary wars are of course inevitable, and will serve to  strengthen and to unify the government of the Inner Planets ... provided  that Gharlane does not interfere.... Oh, I see. Gharlane will not at  first know; since a zone of compulsion will be held upon him. When he or  some Eddorian fusion perceives that compulsion and breaks it--at some  such time of high stress as the Nevian incident--it will be too late.  Our fusions will be operating. Roger will be allowed to perform only  such acts as will be for Civilization's eventual good. Nevia was  selected as Prime Operator because of its location in a small region of  the galaxy which is almost devoid of solid iron and because of its  watery nature; its aquatic forms of life being precisely those in which  the Eddorians are least interested. They will be given partial  neutralization of inertia; they will be able to attain velocities a few  times greater than that of light. That covers the situation, I think?_\"    \"_Very good, Eukonidor,\" the Elders approved. \"A concise and accurate  summation._\"    _Hundreds of Tellurian years passed. The aftermath. Reconstruction.  Advancement. One world--two worlds--three worlds--united, harmonious,  friendly. The Jovian Wars. A solid, unshakeable union._    _Nor did any Eddorian know that such fantastically rapid progress was  being made. Indeed, Gharlane knew, as he drove his immense ship of space  toward Sol, that he would find Tellus inhabited by peoples little above  savagery._    _And it should be noted in passing that not once, throughout all those  centuries, did a man named Kinnison marry a girl with red-bronze-auburn  hair and gold-flecked, tawny eyes._          BOOK THREE    TRIPLANETARY          CHAPTER 7    PIRATES OF SPACE      Apparently motionless to her passengers and crew, the Interplanetary  liner _Hyperion_ bored serenely onward through space at normal  acceleration. In the railed-off sanctum in one corner of the control  room a bell tinkled, a smothered whirr was heard, and Captain Bradley  frowned as he studied the brief message upon the tape of the recorder--a  message flashed to his desk from the operator's panel. He beckoned, and  the second officer, whose watch it now was, read aloud:    \"Reports of scout patrols still negative.\"    \"Still negative.\" The officer scowled in thought. \"They've already  searched beyond the widest possible location of wreckage, too. Two  unexplained disappearances inside a month--first the _Dione_, then the  _Rhea_--and not a plate nor a lifeboat recovered. Looks bad, sir. One  might be an accident; two might possibly be a coincidence....\" His voice  died away.    \"But at three it would get to be a habit,\" the captain finished the  thought. \"And whatever happened, happened quick. Neither of them had  time to say a word--their location recorders simply went dead. But of  course they didn't have our detector screens nor our armament. According  to the observatories we're in clear ether, but I wouldn't trust them  from Tellus to Luna. You have given the new orders, of course?\"    \"Yes, sir. Detectors full out, all three courses of defensive screen on  the trips, projectors manned, suits on the hooks. Every object detected  to be investigated immediately--if vessels, they are to be warned to  stay beyond extreme range. Anything entering the fourth zone is to be  rayed.\"    \"Right--we are going through!\"    \"But no known type of vessel could have made away with them without  detection,\" the second officer argued. \"I wonder if there isn't  something in those wild rumors we've been hearing lately?\"    \"Bah! Of course not!\" snorted the captain. \"Pirates in ships faster than  light--sub-ethereal rays--nullification of gravity mass without  inertia--ridiculous! Proved impossible, over and over again. No, sir, if  pirates are operating in space--and it looks very much like it--they  won't get far against a good big battery full of kilowatt-hours behind  three courses of heavy screen, and good gunners behind multiplex  projectors. They're good enough for anybody. Pirates, Neptunians,  angels, or devils--in ships or on broomsticks--if they tackle the  _Hyperion_ we'll burn them out of the ether!\"    Leaving the captain's desk, the watch officer resumed his tour of duty.  The six great lookout plates into which the alert observers peered were  blank, their far-flung ultra-sensitive detector screens encountering no  obstacle--the ether was empty for thousands upon thousands of  kilometers. The signal lamps upon the pilot's panel were dark, its  warning bells were silent. A brilliant point of white light in the  center of the pilot's closely ruled micrometer grating, exactly upon the  cross-hairs of his directors, showed that the immense vessel was  precisely upon the calculated course, as laid down by the automatic  integrating course plotters. Everything was quiet and in order.    \"All's well, sir,\" he reported briefly to Captain Bradley--but all was  not well.    Danger--more serious by far in that it was not external--was even then,  all unsuspected, gnawing at the great ship's vitals. In a locked and  shielded compartment, deep down in the interior of the liner, was the  great air purifier. Now a man leaned against the primary duct--the aorta  through which flowed the stream of pure air supplying the entire vessel.  This man, grotesque in full panoply of space armor, leaned against the  duct, and as he leaned a drill bit deeper and deeper into the steel wall  of the pipe. Soon it broke through, and the slight rush of air was stopped  by the insertion of a tightly fitting rubber tube. The tube terminated in  a heavy rubber balloon, which surrounded a frail glass bulb. The man stood  tense, one hand holding before his silica-and-steel-helmeted head a large  pocket chronometer, the other lightly grasping the balloon. A sneering  grin was upon his face as he waited the exact second of action--the  carefully predetermined instant when his right hand, closing, would  shatter the fragile flask and force its contents into the primary air  stream of the _Hyperion_!           *       *       *       *       *    Far above, in the main saloon, the regular evening dance was in full  swing. The ship's orchestra crashed into silence, there was a patter of  applause, and Clio Marsden, radiant belle of the voyage, led her partner  out onto the promenade and up to one of the observation plates.    \"Oh, we can't see the Earth any more!\" she exclaimed. \"Which way do you  turn this, Mr. Costigan?\"    \"Like this,\" and Conway Costigan, burly young First Officer of the  liner, turned the dials. \"There--this plate is looking back, or down, at  Tellus; this other one is looking ahead.\"    Earth was a brilliantly shining crescent far beneath the flying vessel.  Above her, ruddy Mars and silvery Jupiter blazed in splendor ineffable  against a background of utterly indescribable blackness--a background  thickly besprinkled with dimensionless points of dazzling brilliance  which were the stars.    \"Oh, isn't it wonderful!\" breathed the girl, awed. \"Of course, I suppose  that it's old stuff to you, but I'm a ground-gripper, you know, and I  could look at it forever, I think. That's why I want to come out here  after every dance. You know, I....\"    Her voice broke off suddenly, with a queer, rasping catch, as she seized  his arm in a frantic clutch and as quickly went limp. He stared at her  sharply, and understood instantly the message written in her eyes--eyes  now enlarged, staring, hard, brilliant, and full of soul-searing terror  as she slumped down, helpless but for his support. In the act of  exhaling as he was, lungs almost entirely empty, yet he held his breath  until he had seized the microphone from his"]]]
