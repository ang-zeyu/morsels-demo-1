[Illustration: Worthy of the Name, Fox Hounds.]        CHAPTER XX.    AMERICAN FOX HOUNDS.    Those who make a science of breeding and training fox hounds, and  indulge in the chase for sport only, have a nearly identical standard  of the ideal the country over. Even he who chases the fox for profit  may find valuable information and interest in such a standard, even  though they may be convinced that their hounds, though without  pedigree, are capable dogs.    At a gathering of the foremost sportsmen of this country, in 1905,  the following standard was fixed as ideal:    The American foxhound should be smaller and lighter in muscle and  bone, than the English foxhound. Dogs should not be under 21 nor over  23 1/2 in., nor weigh more than 57 pounds. Bitches should not be  under 20 nor over 22 1/2 inches nor weigh more than 50 pounds.    The head (value 15) should be of medium size with muzzle in  harmonious proportions.    The skull should be rounded cross-wise with a slight peak, line of  profile nearly straight, with sufficient stop to give symmetry to the  head.    Ears should meet to within one inch of end of muzzle, should be thin,  soft in coat, low set and closely pendant.    Eyes soft, medium size, and varying shades of brown. Nostrils  slightly expanded. The head as a whole should denote hound character.    The neck (value 5) must be clean and of good length, slightly arched,  strong where it springs from the shoulders and gradually tapering to  the head, without trace of throatiness.    The shoulders (value 10) must be of sufficient length to give  leverage and power, well sloped, muscular, but with clean run and not  too broad.    Chest and back ribs (value 10). The chest should be deep for lung  space, narrower in proportion to depth than the English hound, 28  inches in a 23 1/2 inch hound being good. Well sprung ribs, back ribs  should extend well back, a three-inch flank allowing springiness.    Back and loin (value 10) should be broad, short and strong, slightly  arched.    The hindquarters and lower thighs (value 10) must be well muscled and  very strong. The stifle should be low set, not too much bent, nor yet  too straight, a happy medium.    The elbows (value 5) should set straight, neither in nor out.    Legs and feet (value 20) are of great importance. Legs should be  straight and placed squarely under shoulder, having plenty of bone  without clumsiness, strong pasterns well stood upon. Feet round, cat  like, not too large, toes well knuckled, close and compact, strong  nails, pad thick, tough and indurated by use.    Color and coat (value 5). Black, white and tan are preferable, though  the solids and various pies are permissible. Coat should be rough and  course without being wiry or shaggy.    Symmetry (value 5). The form of the hound should be harmonious  thruout. He should show his blood quality and hound character in  every aspect and movement. If he scores high in other properties,  symmetry is bound to follow.    The stern (value 5) must be strong in bone at the root, of a medium  length, carried like a sabre on line with the spine and must have a  good brush. A docked stern shall not disqualify, but simply handicap  according to extent of docking.    SUMMARY.    Head 15, neck 5, shoulders 10, chest and back ribs 10, hindquarters  and lower thighs 10, back and loin 10, elbows 5, legs and feet 20,  color and coat 5, stern 5, symmetry 5. Total 100.    THE GREY HOUND.    Without doubt, the grey hound, bred almost solely for speed, is the  fleetest runner on earth.    In a general way it may be said that the grey hound pursues by sight  only, yet some experienced hunters will contend that they can follow  a fairly warm trail successfully, if trained to it. It is not natural  for them, however, to take and follow an old track until the game is  started, but what they lack in that way is made up in speed.      [Illustration: Good Specimens.]    It has been a favorite practice for decades to take advantage of his  speed, by crossing with other strains, resulting in courage, tenacity  and trailing powers, very useful in several kinds of hunting.    This type of dog, either pure bred or crossed lends himself readily  to deer, wolf, fox or rabbit chasing, and is especially successful if  hunted in company with good trailers. The latter start the game when  the grey hound goes forward and effects a capture, or so interferes  with progress, that the other dogs come up and finish the work.    A bit of practical talk on the subject from the pen of a grey hound  enthusiast is appended:    I have always had grey hounds. If they are let run with the track  hounds when they are young they soon learn to take a track, run away  from the pack and catch the game. I have some one-half grey hound and  one-half bloodhound or fox hound. No better dogs living. Great  fighters, stay as long as the game runs. This kind are good bear  dogs. I keep live 'coon to train pups on and commence to train them  at 4 or 5 months old. The older they get the longer races I give  them.    SCOTCH DEER HOUND.    An excellent deer hound is half scotch deer hound and one-half grey  hound, and I will say there is no breed called stag hound, writes a  well informed Canadian deer hunter. All that claim that name are  overgrown fox hounds used in England for that purpose. Thompson Gray  in \"Dogs of Scotland,\" written in 1890, says that the first mention  of the Scotch deer hound was in \"Pitcotts History of Scotland.\" It is  of the same family as the grey hound and has been spoken of by early  writers as the Rough Scotch Grey Hound.    He is more massive, is about three inches taller than the grey hound  and has a rough coat. His vocation is to course the stag and the  deer. He, like the grey hound must not use his nose when hunting his  quarry and for this reason great speed is absolutely necessary. His  head is somewhat longer and wider across the skull than that of the  grey hound and the hair on the sides of the lip form a mustache.  Small ears are a sign of good breeding. They should be set on high  and at the back of the skull and be semi-erect when at attention.    The coat is hard in texture, without any silkiness. The color most  admired is blue grizzle with its various shades but brindle and fawn,  either light or dark are admirable. There should be no white on any  part of the body. As to formation, he should be made on the same  lines as the grey hound.    THE BLOOD HOUND.    The original and oldest of the hound family is the blood hound. He  takes his name from having originally been used to track wounded  animals to their lairs. Their fame to the public is based on their  use as man trailers, which gained more notice at about the time of  the Civil War than before or since. There is considerable question as  to their infallibility and powers in this direction. While nearly any  dog can, if he wishes, trail a human being, and while the blood hound  is the best scented of the dog family, it is rather doubtful if all  the things that have been written about the blood hounds and slave  fugitives are true.      [Illustration: Blood Hound.]    Bloodhounds are known under several names, such as, Cuban, Siberian,  St. Hubert blood hounds, etc.    Civil authorities and detectives, the country over, employ the blood  hounds to trail criminals, or rather ostensibly to bring them to  justice. Rarely do they succeed in actually capturing a fleeing  culprit, however, if he has passed over sections trampled over by  many other people.    The blood hound, as has been mentioned before, is quite useful in  breeding hunting dogs for specific purposes.    Some light of experience is furnished us by a Pennsylvania breeder,  as follows:    In regard to blood hounds or a cross between the blood hound and fox  hound, they are good hunters on wolf, fox, 'coon and bear. In fact,  they are all around good dogs, great fighters on game. They are  tough, active, will stand a long run and come home and not seem to be  tired.    The blood hound is a good man as well as an animal hunter. They will  stand the longest races and not tire. In fifty years breeding from  the best, these dogs are all that are needed in a hound dog.    On the same subject a Western brother says:    I have bred dogs for 55 years from most of the kennels in this  country, England and other countries. I like English blood hound or  one-half hound and one-half fox hound. They are sharp scented, fast  runners, good stayers, good fighters and game for fox and wolf  hunting.      [Illustration: \"As Pretty as a Picture.\" (Beagles.)]        CHAPTER XXI.    THE BEAGLE DACHSHUND AND BASSET HOUNDS.    \"A few years ago I gave up the large hound for the beagle hound, as I  hunt rabbit a good deal now and I find it good sport with the right  kind of beagles,\" writes a beagle enthusiast of the middle west,  \"but, of course, they are just like fox hounds or any other breed of  dogs, many of them would be better training themselves in the happy  hunting grounds. The main thing is to get the right strain of  beagles, of which there are several. Champion Bannerman, imported by  J. Crane, Esq., about 1884, has had a great influence towards  producing the smaller size. Of course every man to his opinion as to  size. Some prefer the small, while others the larger size. The  importation by General Rowett, of Carlinsville, Ill., which has been  known since as the Rowett strain, when it comes to beauty and hunting  qualities combined, are very good, in fact, are among the best. The  blue cap strain imported into the country by Captain William Ausheton  from the kennels of Sir Arthur Ashburnham along in the seventies.  This strain seems to have a stronger love for the scent of the rabbit  than anything else.    By crossing strains it is possible to get beagles with a fierce  hunting"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3434"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#19)"],[1,"    But they treated him as a liar, and shall therefore be consigned to  punishment,    Except God's faithful servants.    And we left this for him among posterity,    \"PEACE BE ON ELIASIN!\"15    Thus do we reward the well-doers,    For he was one of our believing servants.    And Lot truly was of our Sent Ones,    When we rescued him and all his family,    Save an aged woman among those who tarried.    Afterward we destroyed the others.    And ye indeed pass by their ruined dwellings at morn    And night: will ye not then reflect?    Jonas, too, was one of the Apostles,    When he fled unto the laden ship,    And lots were cast,16 and he was doomed,    And the fish swallowed him, for he was blameworthy.    But had he not been of those who praise Us,    In its belly had he surely remained, till the day of resurrection.    And we cast him on the bare shoreand he was sick;    And we caused a gourd-plant to grow up over him,    And we sent him to a hundred thousand persons, or even more,    And because they believed, we continued their enjoyments for a season.    Inquire then of the Meccans whether thy Lord hath daughters, and they, sons?    Have we created the angels females? and did they witness it?    Is it not a falsehood of their own devising, when they say,    \"God hath begotten\"? They are indeed liars.    Would he have preferred daughters to sons?    What reason have ye for thus judging?    Will ye not then receive this warning?    Have ye a clear proof for them?    Produce your Book if ye speak truth.    And they make him to be of kin with the Djinn: but the Djinn have long known  that these idolaters shall be brought up before God.    Far be the glory of God from what they impute to him.    \"His faithful servants do not thus.    Moreover, ye and what ye worship    Shall not stir up any against God,17    Save him who shall burn in Hell.    And verily each one of us hath his appointed place,    And we range ourselves in order,    And we celebrate His praises.\"18    And if those infidels say,    \"Had we a revelation transmitted to us from those of old,19    We had surely been God's faithful servants.\"    Yet they believe not the Koran. But they shall know its truth at last.    Our word came of old to our servants the apostles,    That they should surely be the succoured,    And that our armies should procure the victory for them.    Turn aside therefore from them for a time,    And behold them, for they too shall in the end behold their doom.    Would they then hasten our vengeance?    But when it shall come down into their courts, an evil morning shall it be to  those who have had their warning.    Turn aside from them therefore for a time.    And behold; for they too shall in the end behold their doom.    Far be the glory of thy Lord, the Lord of all greatness, from what they  impute to him,    And peace be on his Apostles!    And praise be to God the Lord of the worlds.      _______________________    1 I have given in the text the sense of these first two verses according to  the Muhammadan commentators.

SURA LXXI.NOAH [LI.]    MECCA.29 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    We sent NOAH to his people, and said to him, \"Warn thou thy people ere there  come on them an afflictive punishment.\"    He said, \"O my people! I come to you a plain-spoken warner:    Serve God and fear Him, and obey me:    Your sins will He forgive you, and respite you till the fixed Time; for when  God's fixed Time hath come, it shall not be put back. Would that ye knew  this!\"    He said, \"Lord I have cried to my people night and day; and my cry doth but  make them flee from me the more.    So oft as I cry to them, that thou mayest forgive them, they thrust their  fingers into their ears, and wrap themselves in their garments, and persist  in their error, and are disdainfully disdainful.    Then I cried aloud to them:    Then again spake I with plainness, and in private did I secretly address  them:    And I said, Beg forgiveness of your Lord, for He is ready to forgive.    He will send down the very Heaven upon you in plenteous rains;    And will increase you in wealth and children; and will give you gardens, and  will give you watercourses:    What hath come to you that ye hope not for goodness from the hand of God?    For He it is who hath formed you by successive steps.1    See ye not how God hath created the seven heavens one over the other?    And He hath placed therein the moon as a light, and hath placed there the sun  as a torch;    And God hath caused you to spring forth from the earth like a plant;    Hereafter will He turn you back into it again, and will bring you forth anew    And God hath spread the earth for you like a carpet,    That ye may walk therein along spacious paths.\"'    Said Noah, \"O my Lord! they rebel against me, and they follow those whose  riches and children do but aggravate their ruin.\"    And they plotted a great plot;    And they said, \"Forsake not your Gods; forsake not Wadd nor Sowah,    Nor Yaghuth and Yahuk and Nesr;\"    And they caused many to err;2and thou, too, O Muhammad! shalt be the means  of increasing only error in the wicked    Because of their sins they were drowned, and made to go into the Fire;    And they found that they had no helper save God.    And Noah said, \"Lord, leave not one single family of Infidels on the Earth:    For if thou leave them they will beguile thy servants and will beget only  sinners, infidels.    O my Lord, forgive me, and my parents, and every one who, being a believer,  shall enter my house, and believers men and women: and add to the wicked  nought but perdition.\"      _______________________    1 See Sura xxii. 5.    2 Or, the idols had seduced many.

For the Infidels we have got ready chains and collars and flaming fire.    But a wine cup tempered at the camphor fountain2 the just shall quaff:    Fount whence the servants of God shall drink, and guide by channels from  place to place;    They who fulfilled their vows, and feared the day whose woes will spread far  and wide;    Who though longing for it themselves, bestowed their food on the poor and the  orphan and the captive:    \"We feed you for the sake of God: we seek from you neither recompense nor  thanks:3    A stern and calamitous day dread we from our Lord.\"    From the evil therefore of that day hath God delivered them and cast on them  brightness of face and joy:    And hath rewarded their constancy, with Paradise and silken robes:    Reclining therein on bridal couches, nought shall they know of sun or  piercing cold:    Its shades shall be close over them, and low shall its fruits hang down:    And vessels of silver and goblets like flagons shall be borne round among  them:    Flagons of silver whose measure themselves shall mete.    And there shall they be given to drink of the cup tempered with zendjebil  (ginger)    From the fount therein whose name is Selsebil (the softly flowing).    Aye-blooming youths go round among them. When thou lookest at them thou  wouldest deem them scattered pearls;    And when thou seest this, thou wilt see delights and a vast kingdom:    Their clothing green silk robes and rich brocade: with silver bracelets shall  they be adorned; and drink of a pure beverage shall their Lord give them.    This shall be your recompense. Your efforts shall meet with thanks.    We ourselves have sent down to thee the Koran as a missive from on high.    Await then with patience the judgments of thy Lord, and obey not the wicked  among them and the unbelieving:    And make mention of the name of thy Lord at morn, at even,    And at night. Adore him, and praise him the livelong night.    But these men love the fleeting present, and leave behind them the heavy day  of doom.    Ourselves have we created them, and strengthened their joints; and when we  please, with others like unto themselves will we replace them.   "]]]
