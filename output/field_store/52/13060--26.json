[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30754"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 1 (of 3) (#19)"],[1," be angry with me for  stating things so self-evident, for these are all necessary steps in the  chain of argument which I must not break. Even this change from detached  stones to a single block is not without significance; for it is part of  the real service and value of the member Yb to provide for the reception  of the shaft a surface free from joints; and the eye always conceives it  as a firm covering over all inequalities or fissures in the smaller  masonry of the floor.    Sec. XV. I have said nothing yet of the proportion of the height of Yb to  its width, nor of that of Yb and Xb to each other. Both depend much on  the height of shaft, and are besides variable within certain limits, at  the architect's discretion. But the limits of the height of Yb may be  thus generally stated. If it looks so thin as that the weight of the  column above might break it, it is too low; and if it is higher than its  own width, it is too high. The utmost admissible height is that of a  cubic block; for if it ever become higher than it is wide, it becomes  itself a part of a pier, and not the base of one.    Sec. XVI. I have also supposed Yb, when expanded from beneath Xb, as  always expanded into a square, and four spurs only to be added at the  angles. But Yb may be expanded into a pentagon, hexagon, or polygon; and  Xb then may have five, six, or many spurs. In proportion, however, as  the sides increase in number, the spurs become shorter and less energetic  in their effect, and the square is in most cases the best form.    Sec. XVII. We have hitherto conducted the argument entirely on the  supposition of the pillars being numerous, and in a range. Suppose,  however, that we require only a single pillar: as we have free space  round it, there is no need to fill up the first ranges of its  foundations; nor need we do so in order to equalise pressure, since the  pressure to be met is its own alone. Under such circumstances, it is  well to exhibit the lower tiers of the foundation as well as Yb and Xb.  The noble bases of the two granite pillars of the Piazzetta at Venice  are formed by the entire series of members given in Fig. X., the lower  courses expanding into steps, with a superb breadth of proportion to the  shaft. The member Xb is of course circular, having its proper decorative  mouldings, not here considered; Yb is octagonal, but filled up into a  square by certain curious groups of figures representing the trades of  Venice. The three courses below are octagonal, with their sides set  across the angles of the innermost octagon, Yb. The shafts are 15 feet  in circumference, and the lowest octagons of the base 56 (7 feet each  side).    Sec. XVIII. Detached buildings, like our own Monument, are not pillars,  but towers built in imitation of Pillars. As towers they are barbarous,  being dark, inconvenient, and unsafe, besides lying, and pretending to  be what they are not. As shafts they are barbarous, because they were  designed at a time when the Renaissance architects had introduced and  forced into acceptance, as _de rigueur_, a kind of columnar high-heeled  shoe,--a thing which they called a pedestal, and which is to a true base  exactly what a Greek actor's cothurnus was to a Greek gentleman's  sandal. But the Greek actor knew better, I believe, than to exhibit or  to decorate his cork sole; and, with shafts as with heroes, it is rather  better to put the sandal off than the cothurnus on. There are, indeed,  occasions on which a pedestal may be necessary; it may be better to  raise a shaft from a sudden depression of plinth to a level with others,  its companions, by means of a pedestal, than to introduce a higher  shaft; or it may be better to place a shaft of alabaster, if otherwise  too short for our purpose, on a pedestal, than to use a larger shaft of  coarser material; but the pedestal is in each case a make-shift, not an  additional perfection. It may, in the like manner, be sometimes  convenient for men to walk on stilts, but not to keep their stilts on as  ornamental parts of dress. The bases of the Nelson Column, the Monument,  and the column of the Place Vendome, are to the shafts, exactly what  highly ornamented wooden legs would be to human beings.    Sec. XIX. So far of bases of detached shafts. As we do not yet know in  what manner shafts are likely to be grouped, we can say nothing of those  of grouped shafts until we know more of what they are to support.    Lastly; we have throughout our reasoning upon the base supposed the pier  to be circular. But circumstances may occur to prevent its being  reduced to this form, and it may remain square or rectangular; its base  will then be simply the wall base following its contour, and we have no  spurs at the angles. Thus much may serve respecting pier bases; we have  next to examine the concentration of the Wall Veil, or the Shaft.      FOOTNOTES:      [35] The experiment is not quite fair in this rude fashion; for the      small rolls owe their increase of strength much more to their      tubular form than their aggregation of material; but if the paper be      cut up into small strips, and tied together firmly in three or four      compact bundles, it will exhibit increase of strength enough to show      the principle. Vide, however, Appendix 16, \"Strength of Shafts.\"      [36] Appendix 17, \"Answer to Mr. Garbett.\"      [37] Yet more so than any other figure enclosed by a curved line:      for the circle, in its relations to its own centre, is the curve of      greatest stability. Compare Sec. XX. of Chap. XX.          CHAPTER VIII.      THE SHAFT.      Sec. I. We have seen in the last Chapter how, in converting the wall  into the square or cylindrical shaft, we parted at every change of form  with some quantity of material. In proportion to the quantity thus  surrendered, is the necessity that what we retain should be good of its  kind, and well set together, since everything now depends on it.    It is clear also that the best material, and the closest concentration,  is that of the natural crystalline rocks; and that, by having reduced  our wall into the shape of shafts, we may be enabled to avail ourselves  of this better material, and to exchange cemented bricks for  crystallised blocks of stone. Therefore, the general idea of a perfect  shaft is that of a single stone hewn into a form more or less elongated  and cylindrical. Under this form, or at least under the ruder one of a  long stone set upright, the conception of true shafts appears first to  have occurred to the human mind; for the reader must note this  carefully, once for all, it does not in the least follow that the order  of architectural features which is most reasonable in their arrangement,  is most probable in their invention. I have theoretically deduced shafts  from walls, but shafts were never so reasoned out in architectural  practice. The man who first propped a thatched roof with poles was the  discoverer of their principle; and he who first hewed a long stone into  a cylinder, the perfecter of their practice.    Sec. II. It is clearly necessary that shafts of this kind (we will call  them, for convenience, _block_ shafts) should be composed of stone not  liable to flaws or fissures; and therefore that we must no longer  continue our argument as if it were always possible to do what is to be  done in the best way; for the style of a national architecture may  evidently depend, in great measure, upon the nature of the rocks of the  country.    Our own English rocks, which supply excellent building stone from their  thin and easily divisible beds, are for the most part entirely incapable  of being worked into shafts of any size, except only the granites and  whinstones, whose hardness renders them intractable for ordinary  purposes;--and English architecture therefore supplies no instances of  the block shaft applied on an extensive scale; while the facility of  obtaining large masses of marble has in Greece and Italy been partly the  cause of the adoption of certain noble types of architectural form  peculiar to those countries, or, when occurring elsewhere, derived from  them.    We have not, however, in reducing our walls to shafts, calculated on the  probabilities of our obtaining better materials than those of which the  walls were built; and we shall therefore first consider the form of  shaft which will be best when we have the best materials; and then  consider how far we can imitate, or how far it will be wise to imitate,  this form with any materials we can obtain.    Sec. III. Now as I gave the reader the ground, and the stones, that he  might for himself find out how to build his wall, I shall give him the  block of marble, and the chisel, that he may himself find out how to  shape his column. Let him suppose the elongated mass, so given him,  rudely hewn to the thickness which he has calculated will be  proportioned to the weight it has to carry. The conditions of stability  will require that some allowance be made in finishing it for any chance  of slight disturbance or subsidence of the ground below, and that, as  everything must depend on the uprightness of the shaft, as little chance  should be left as possible of its being thrown off its balance. It will  therefore be prudent to leave it slightly thicker at the base than at  the top. This excess of diameter at the base being determined, the  reader is to ask himself how most easily and simply to smooth the  column from one extremity to the other. To cut it into a true  straight-sided cone would be a matter of much trouble and nicety, and  would incur the continual risk of chipping into it too deep. Why not  leave some room for a chance stroke, work it slightly, _very_ slightly  convex, and smooth the curve by the eye between the two extremities? you  will save much trouble and time, and the shaft will be all the stronger.    [Illustration: Fig. XIII.]    This is accordingly the natural form of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30755"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 2 (of 3), (#19)"],[1,"an incrusted coat to it would be  greater than the saving of material is worth. Therefore the shaft, of  whatever size, is always to be solid; and because the incrusted  character of the rest of the building renders it more difficult for the  shafts to clear themselves from suspicion, they must not, in this  incrusted style, be in any place jointed. No shaft must ever be used but  of one block; and this the more, because the permission given to the  builder to have his walls and piers as ponderous as he likes, renders it  quite unnecessary for him to use shafts of any fixed size. In our Norman  and Gothic, where definite support is required at a definite point, it  becomes lawful to build up a tower of small stones in the shape of a  shaft. But the Byzantine is allowed to have as much support as he wants  from the walls in every direction, and he has no right to ask for  further license in the structure of his shafts. Let him, by generosity  in the substance of his pillars, repay us for the permission we have  given him to be superficial in his walls. The builder in the chalk  valleys of France and England may be blameless in kneading his clumsy  pier out of broken flint and calcined lime; but the Venetian, who has  access to the riches of Asia and the quarries of Egypt, must frame at  least his shafts out of flawless stone.    Sec. XXXIII. And this for another reason yet. Although, as we have said,  it is impossible to cover the walls of a large building with color, except  on the condition of dividing the stone into plates, there is always a  certain appearance of meanness and niggardliness in the procedure. It is  necessary that the builder should justify himself from this suspicion;  and prove that it is not in mere economy or poverty, but in the real  impossibility of doing otherwise, that he has sheeted his walls so  thinly with the precious film. Now the shaft is exactly the portion of  the edifice in which it is fittest to recover his honor in this respect.  For if blocks of jasper or porphyry be inserted in the walls, the  spectator cannot tell their thickness, and cannot judge of the  costliness of the sacrifice. But the shaft he can measure with his eye  in an instant, and estimate the quantity of treasure both in the mass of  its existing substance, and in that which has been hewn away to bring it  into its perfect and symmetrical form. And thus the shafts of all  buildings of this kind are justly regarded as an expression of their  wealth, and a form of treasure, just as much as the jewels or gold in  the sacred vessels; they are, in fact, nothing else than large  jewels,[31] the block of precious serpentine or jasper being valued  according to its size and brilliancy of color, like a large emerald or  ruby; only the bulk required to bestow value on the one is to be  measured in feet and tons, and on the other in lines and carats. The  shafts must therefore be, without exception, of one block in all  buildings of this kind; for the attempt in any place to incrust or joint  them would be a deception like that of introducing a false stone among  jewellery (for a number of joints of any precious stone are of course  not equal in value to a single piece of equal weight), and would put an  end at once to the spectator's confidence in the expression of wealth in  any portion of the structure, or of the spirit of sacrifice in those who  raised it.    Sec. XXXIV. LAW IV. _The shafts may sometimes be independent of the  construction._ Exactly in proportion to the importance which the shaft  assumes as a large jewel, is the diminution of its importance as a  sustaining member; for the delight which we receive in its abstract  bulk, and beauty of color, is altogether independent of any perception  of its adaptation to mechanical necessities. Like other beautiful things  in this world, its end is to _be_ beautiful; and, in proportion to its  beauty, it receives permission to be otherwise useless. We do not blame  emeralds and rubies because we cannot make them into heads of hammers.  Nay, so far from our admiration of the jewel shaft being dependent on  its doing work for us, it is very possible that a chief part of its  preciousness may consist in a delicacy, fragility, and tenderness of  material, which must render it utterly unfit for hard work; and  therefore that we shall admire it the more, because we perceive that if  we were to put much weight upon it, it would be crushed. But, at all  events, it is very clear that the primal object in the placing of such  shafts must be the display of their beauty to the best advantage, and  that therefore all imbedding of them in walls, or crowding of them into  groups, in any position in which either their real size or any portion  of their surface would be concealed, is either inadmissible altogether,  or objectionable in proportion to their value; that no symmetrical or  scientific arrangements of pillars are therefore ever to be expected in  buildings of this kind, and that all such are even to be looked upon as  positive errors and misapplications of materials: but that, on the  contrary, we must be constantly prepared to see, and to see with  admiration, shafts of great size and importance set in places where  their real service is little more than nominal, and where the chief end  of their existence is to catch the sunshine upon their polished sides,  and lead the eye into delighted wandering among the mazes of their azure  veins.    Sec. XXXV. LAW V. _The shafts may be of variable size._ Since the value of  each shaft depends upon its bulk, and diminishes with the diminution of  its mass, in a greater ratio than the size itself diminishes, as in the  case of all other jewellery, it is evident that we must not in general  expect perfect symmetry and equality among the series of shafts, any  more than definiteness of application; but that, on the contrary, an  accurately observed symmetry ought to give us a kind of pain, as proving  that considerable and useless loss has been sustained by some of the  shafts, in being cut down to match with the rest. It is true that  symmetry is generally sought for in works of smaller jewellery; but,  even there, not a perfect symmetry, and obtained under circumstances  quite different from those which affect the placing of shafts in  architecture. First: the symmetry is usually imperfect. The stones that  seem to match each other in a ring or necklace, appear to do so only  because they are so small that their differences are not easily measured  by the eye; but there is almost always such difference between them as  would be strikingly apparent if it existed in the same proportion  between two shafts nine or ten feet in height. Secondly: the quantity of  stones which pass through a jeweller's hands, and the facility of  exchange of such small objects, enable the tradesman to select any  number of stones of approximate size; a selection, however, often  requiring so much time, that perfect symmetry in a group of very fine  stones adds enormously to their value. But the architect has neither the  time nor the facilities of exchange. He cannot lay aside one column in a  corner of his church till, in the course of traffic, he obtain another  that will match it; he has not hundreds of shafts fastened up in  bundles, out of which he can match sizes at his ease; he cannot send to  a brother-tradesman and exchange the useless stones for available ones,  to the convenience of both. His blocks of stone, or his ready hewn  shafts, have been brought to him in limited number, from immense  distances; no others are to be had; and for those which he does not  bring into use, there is no demand elsewhere. His only means of  obtaining symmetry will therefore be, in cutting down the finer masses  to equality with the inferior ones; and this we ought not to desire him  often to do. And therefore, while sometimes in a Baldacchino, or an  important chapel or shrine, this costly symmetry may be necessary, and  admirable in proportion to its probable cost, in the general fabric we  must expect to see shafts introduced of size and proportion continually  varying, and such symmetry as may be obtained among them never  altogether perfect, and dependent for its charm frequently on strange  complexities and unexpected rising and falling of weight and accent in  its marble syllables; bearing the same relation to a rigidly chiselled  and proportioned architecture that the wild lyric rhythm of Aeschylus  or Pindar bears to the finished measures of Pope.    Sec. XXXVI. The application of the principles of jewellery to the smaller  as well as the larger blocks, will suggest to us another reason for the  method of incrustation adopted in the walls. It often happens that the  beauty of the veining in some varieties of alabaster is so great, that  it becomes desirable to exhibit it by dividing the stone, not merely to  economize its substance, but to display the changes in the disposition  of its fantastic lines. By reversing one of two thin plates successively  taken from the stone, and placing their corresponding edges in contact,  a perfectly symmetrical figure may be obtained, which will enable the  eye to comprehend more thoroughly the position of the veins. And this is  actually the method in which, for the most part, the alabasters of St.  Mark are employed; thus accomplishing a double good,--directing the  spectator, in the first place, to close observation of the nature of the  stone employed, and in the second, giving him a farther proof of the  honesty of intention in the builder: for wherever similar veining is  discovered in two pieces, the fact is declared that they have been cut  from the same stone. It would have been easy to disguise the similarity  by using them in different parts of the building; but on the contrary  they are set edge to edge, so that the whole system of the architecture  may be discovered at a glance by any one"]]]
