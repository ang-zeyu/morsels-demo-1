In all these arts, purpose is implied--not purpose in the hypothetical  sense, as applied to the existence, conditions, and objects, of natural  beings--but in the common intelligible sense of the word, as expressing  the intention of men in the pursuit of these arts.      _Beauty of Useful Objects._    Here the purpose being utility, this kind of beauty arises from the  perception of means as adapted to an end, which of course implies, the  parts of anything being fitted to answer the purpose of the whole.    This implies an act of understanding and judgment; for of no product of  useful art can we perceive the extrinsic beauty, until we know its  destination, and the relations which that involves.    When these are known, so powerful is the sense of utility, that, though  deviation from the elementary beauty never ceases to be felt, yet that  sense sanctions it to a great extent. Hence it is that an irregular  dwelling-house may become beautiful, when its convenience is striking.  Hence it is that, in the forms of furniture, machines, and instruments,  their beauty arises chiefly from this consideration; and that every form  becomes beautiful by association, where it is perfectly adapted to its  end.    The greater, however, the elementary beauty, that can be introduced in  useful objects, the more obvious will their utility be, and the more  beautiful will they universally appear. This will be granted the moment I  mention simplicity.    Of all the elements of beauty already spoken of--of all the means of  producing accordant and agreeable relations--simplicity appears to be the  most efficient; and in all the useful arts, no elementary consideration  recommends their objects so much.    This implies all the rest, regularity, uniformity, proportion, order, &c.,  as far as is compatible with purpose.    Thus, in regard to uniformity, says some one, a number of things destined  for the same purpose, as chairs, spoons, &c., cannot be too uniform,  because they are adapted to uniform purposes; but it would be absurd to  give to objects destined for one purpose the form suited to those destined  for another.    So also the objects of useful art will resemble in form precisely as they  resemble in purpose; and where the purpose is similar, and the deviation  which is admissible is slight, this becomes a subject of great nicety,  and, if ornament be at the same time admissible, a subject of exquisite  taste.    It was by the transcendent exercise of these qualities, that the Greeks  succeeded in fixing the orders of architecture. The most beautiful columns  would have shocked the sight, if their mass had not corresponded to that  of the edifice which they sustained; and the difference which existed in  this respect, required a difference of ornament.    Home indeed observes, that \"writers on architecture insist much upon the  proportions of a column, and assign different proportions to the Doric,  Ionic, and Corinthian; but no architect will maintain, that the most  accurate proportions contribute more to use, than several that are less  accurate and less agreeable.\"    That such a man should have committed such an error is surprising. It  seems evident that the different proportion in the columns of these orders  is admirably suited to the different quantity of matter in their  entablatures. A greater superincumbent mass, required shorter and thicker  columns; a less superincumbent mass, longer and slender ones. Many  experiments, much observation, were requisite to determine this; but the  Greeks had the means of making them, and solved every problem on the  subject; and the result of the perfection they attained is, that all err  who depart from the truth they have determined.    It was, again, the differing quantities of matter in the entablatures, and  the accurately-corresponding dimensions of the columns that determined, of  course amid infinite experiment and observation, the nature of their  ornaments. Hence, the Doric is distinguished by simplicity; the Ionic by  elegance; and the Corinthian by lightness, in ornament as well as in  proportion.    Even, therefore, if we were to destroy all the associations of elegance,  of magnificence, of costliness, and, still more than all, of antiquity,  which are so strongly connected with such forms, the pleasure which their  proportions would afford, would remain, as in all cases where means are  best adapted to their end.    In his objections to proportion as an element of beauty, Burke only  confounds this kind of beauty with that which I have next to describe.    \"The effects of proportion and fitness,\" he says, \"at least so far as they  proceed from a mere consideration of the work itself, produce approbation,  the acquiescence of the understanding, but not love, nor any passion of  that species. When we examine the structure of a watch, when we come to  know thoroughly the use of every part of it, satisfied as we are with the  fitness of the whole, we are far enough from perceiving anything like  beauty in the watchwork itself; but let us look on the case, the labor of  some curious artist in engraving, with little or no idea of use, we shall  have a much livelier idea of beauty than we ever could have had from the  watch itself, though the masterpiece of Graham.\"    It is an emotion of pleasure which is the inevitable result of the  perception of beauty, not love, nor any passion of the kind. These will or  will not follow, according to the nature of the object, and of the mind of  the observer. A hill, a valley, or a rivulet, may be beautiful, and it  will excite an emotion of pleasure when its beauty is discerned; but it  may produce no desire or passion of love. There may exist, then, the  beauty of utility, as to the structure of the watch, and that of ornament  as to its case; and some minds will more readily perceive the one; others,  the other.    When Burke adds, \"In beauty, the effect is previous to any knowledge of  the use; but to judge of proportion, we must know the end for which any  work is designed;\" he forgets, that, in the instance of the barber's  block, &c., he showed that the perception of beauty, as well as  proportion, required observation, experience, and reflection.      _Beauty of Ornamental Objects._    There are three great arts which, under circumstances of high  civilization, become ornamental, namely, landscape-gardening,  architecture, and dress--the particular arts by which our persons are more  or less closely invested;[14] and all of them, then, require beauty of the  second kind, that which belongs particularly to vegetable beings, and is  characterized by delicate, bending varied, and contrasted forms.    All these, regarded as ornamental arts, have chiefly bodily and sensual  pleasures for their purpose; and this I consider as distinguishing them  from the intellectual arts, which have a higher purpose.    Of landscape-gardening, the materials are plants, and therefore its beauty  is evidently dependant on, or rather composed of, theirs.    The same kind of beauty will be found in every ornamental art. Hence,  Alison says: \"The greater part of beautiful forms in nature, are to be  found in the vegetable kingdom, in the forms of flowers, of foliage, of  shrubs, and in those assumed by the young shoots of trees. It is from  them, accordingly, that almost all those forms have been imitated, which  have been employed by artists for the purposes of ornament and elegance.\"    On this kind of beauty, mistaking it for the only one, Hogarth founded his  peculiar doctrine. \"He adopts two lines, on which, according to him, the  beauty of figure principally depends. One is the waving line, or a curve  bending gently in opposite directions. This he calls the line of beauty;  and he shows how often it is found in flowers, shells, and various works  of nature; while it is common also in the figures designed by painters and  sculptors, for the purpose of decoration. The other line, which he calls  the line of grace, is the former waving line, twisted round some solid  body. Twisted pillars and twisted horns exhibit it. In all the instances  which he mentions, variety plainly appears to be so important an element  of this kind of beauty, that he states a portion of the truth, when he  defines the art of drawing pleasing forms to be the art of varying well;  for the curve line, so much the favorite of painters, derives much of its  beauty from its perpetual bending and variation from the stiff regularity  of the straight line.\" It is evident, however, that in this, he mistakes  one kind of beauty for all.    Of architecture, considered as a fine art, much of the beauty depends on  the imitation of vegetable forms. Employing materials which require the  best characteristics of the first kind of beauty, it, in its choicest and  ornamented parts, imitates both the rigid trunks, and the delicate and  bending forms of plants. Its columns, tapering upward, are copied from the  trunks of trees; and their decorations are suited with consummate art to  their dimensions, and the weight they support. The simple Doric has little  ornament; the elegant Ionic has more; the light Corinthian has most.    On the subject of these finely-calculated ornaments, some observations  have struck me, which I have not seen mentioned elsewhere. The Doric  presents only columns, without any other ornament than that of which their  mere form admits. The Ionic expresses increased lightness, by the  interposition of its volute, as if the superincumbent weight had but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35448"],[0,"Herd Record of the Association of Breeders of Thorough-Bred Neat Stock (#19)"],[1,"an  article.    Mr. Howard's opportunities of studying this breed, both in Scotland and  in this country have been such, that he is eminently fitted to write  with authority on the subject. The Committee did not follow his  suggestion and give in the Herd Book the lists of premiums taken by the  animals at the various Agricultural Fairs, knowing that many of the  premiums in this country have been awarded for want of competition, and  by judges not acquainted with the excellencies or the peculiarities of  the breed. Should this Society ever hold exhibitions, a record of the  premiums taken at them would be of great value to breeders in selecting  animals for stock purposes.                        HENRY H.

THE breed of cattle now know as the Ayrshire, undoubtedly originated in  the county of that name, in Scotland; but by what special means it was  formed cannot be particularly told. Youatt (1835) says, \"A century ago  there was no such breed in Ayrshire or in Scotland;\" and he asks, \"Did  the [present] Ayrshire cattle arise entirely from a careful selection of  the native breed?\" adding, \"If they did it is a circumstance  unparalleled in the history of agriculture. The native breed may be  ameliorated by careful selection; its value may be incalculably  increased; some good qualities may for the first time be developed; but  yet there will be some resemblance to the original stock.\" A comparison  of the modern breed with the description given by Aiton of the cattle  which he says occupied Ayrshire fifty years before the time when he  wrote (1806), will show that the difference is great. He says, \"The cows  kept in the districts of Kyle and Cunningham [districts of Ayrshire],  were of a diminutive size, ill-fed, ill-shaped, and they yielded but a  scanty return in milk; they were mostly of a black color, with stripes  of white along the chine or ridge of their backs, about their flanks and  on their faces. Their horns were high and crooked, * * * their pile  [hair] was coarse and open; and few of them yielded more than three or  four Scotch pints [six to eight wine quarts] of milk a day.\"    Those who are acquainted with the Ayrshire cattle of to-day, will  readily admit that they present a wide contrast with the old stock,  according to the above description of the latter; and the suggestion of  Youatt, that the present breed could not have arisen entirely by  selection from the old, seems reasonable. It follows, then, that the  Ayrshire, like the modern or \"improved\" Short Horn breed, originated in  crossing. The question as to the breeds from which it was derived, will  be briefly considered, although the attempt will not be made to give  precise details on this point.    Various accounts represent that the Earl of Marchmont, some time between  1724 and 1740, introduced to his estates, in Berwickshire, some cattle,  conjectured (their history was not positively known) to be of the  Holderness or Teeswater breed, and that, not long afterwards, some of  the stock was carried to estates belonging to the same nobleman, in that  part of Ayrshire called Kyle. But, perhaps, the main nucleus of the  improved breed was the \"Dunlop stock,\" so called, which appears to have  been possessed by a distinguished family by the name of Dunlop, in the  Cunningham District of Ayrshire, as early as 1780. This stock, it is  said, was derived, at least in part, from animals imported from Holland.  The Dunlop cows soon became noted. Rawlin (as quoted by Youatt), who  wrote in 1794, speaking of the cattle of Ayrshire, says, \"They have  another breed, called the Dunlop, which are allowed to be the best race  for yielding milk in Great Britain, or Ireland, not only for large  quantities, but also for richness and quality.\" This, though extravagant  praise, perhaps, shows that the stock possessed remarkable qualities at  that early day. It was, indeed, held in great esteem still earlier. In  Youatt's Treatise, it is mentioned, when speaking of the cattle of  Dumfrieshire, that the poet Burns, when he occupied a farm near the city  of Dumfries, \"not content with the Galloway breed, introduced some of  the West-Country cows, which he thought would produce more milk.\" In  the poet's published correspondence, allusion is made, in a letter dated  November 13th, 1788, to a heifer which had been presented to him by the  proprietor of Dunlop House, as \"the finest quey in Ayrshire.\" Mrs.  Dunlop, it will be remembered, was a special friend and correspondent of  the poet.[A]    Col. Le Couteur, in a paper on the Jersey or Alderney cow, published in  the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society, refers to a statement by  Quayle, that the Ayrshire was a cross of the Short Horn and Alderney;  and adds himself that \"there is a considerable affinity between the two  breeds.\" Rawlin also says, in reference to the Ayrshire breed, \"It is  said to be a mixture by bulls brought from the island of Alderney, with  their own or the old race of cows.\" Martin says, \"At some period or  other there has evidently been a cross with the Durham or Holderness,  and, perhaps, also with the Alderney.\" Professor Low, in his  \"Illustrations of British Quadrupeds,\" says, \"From all the evidence  which, in the absence of authentic documents, the case admits of, the  dairy breed of Ayrshire cows, owes the characters which distinguish it  from the older race, to a mixture of the blood of the races of the  continent and of the dairy breed of Alderney.\"    So far, the authorities quoted have, doubtless, given the main facts in  regard to the originals of the present Ayrshire cattle. But there is  evidence that the present leading type of the breed was formed, in part,  by an infusion of the blood of the Kyloe, or West-Highland breed. This  appeared in the first instance, probably, in what has been called the  Swinley variety. The facts, which the writer has obtained in Scotland in  regard to it, are substantially as follows: Theophilus Parton, of  Swinley Farm, near Dairy, Ayrshire, about forty to forty-five years ago,  took great pains to establish a herd of what were deemed the _best_  Ayrshire cattle, into which he infused a strain of the West-Highland  blood, the particular degree of which is not publicly or generally  known. The Swinley stock differs from the older Ayrshire in having a  shorter head, with more breadth across the eyes, more upright and  spreading horns, more hair, and generally better constitutions. They are  also somewhat smaller boned than the old stock, though from their  superior symmetry, and greater tendency to fatten, they are fully equal  to the former in weight of carcass when slaughtered.    The following points given by the Ayrshire Agricultural Association,  1853, \"as indicating superior quality,\" will give an idea of the  standard for Ayrshire cattle, as recognized by the leading breeders:    Head short, forehead wide, nose fine between the muzzle and the eyes;  muzzle moderately large, eyes full and lively, horns widely set on,  inclining upwards and curving slightly inwards.    Neck long and straight from the head to the top of the shoulders, free  from loose skin on the underside, fine at its junction with the head,  and the muscles symmetrically enlarging towards the shoulders.    Shoulders thin at the top, brisket light, the whole fore-quarter thin in  front and gradually increasing in depth and width backwards.    Back short and straight, spine well defined, especially at the  shoulders, short ribs arched, the body deep at the flanks, and the  milk-veins well developed.    Pelvis long, broad and straight, hook [or hip] bones wide apart, and not  much overlaid with fat, thighs deep and broad, tail long and slender,  and set on a level with the back.    Milk-vessel [udder] capacious and extending well forward, hinder-part  broad and firmly attached to the body, the sole or under surface nearly  level. The teats from two to two and a half inches in length, equal in  thickness, and hanging perpendicularly; their distance apart at the  sides should be equal to about one-third the length of the vessel, and  across to about one-half the breadth.    Legs short, the bones fine and the joints firm.    Skin soft and elastic, and covered with soft, close and woolly hair.    The colors preferred are brown, or brown and white, the colors being  distinctly defined. Weight of the animal, when fattened, about forty  imperial stones, sinking the offal [that is 560 pounds], the quarters or  meat only.    From what has already been said, it will be understood, that the dairy  is the leading object with the breeders of Ayrshires. At the same time  the fact has not been overlooked, that to breed and perpetuate a  profitable dairy stock, regard must be had to hardiness and strength of  constitution, and also to such fattening tendencies as will insure a  profitable return from calves fattened for veal, from steers reared for  beef, and for cows, which having served their turn in the dairy, are at  last dried of their milk and prepared for the shambles. The importance  of these properties is not sufficiently regarded by keepers of dairy  stock in this country. The remark has not unfrequently been heard that  the \"_looks_ of a cow are nothing.\" People who hold this absurd notion  will never be distinguished for breeding profitable dairy stock. Even if  milk were the sole object, it would be impossible to preserve a breed  possessing superior qualities, in this respect, without giving attention  to those points of form which denote strength of constitution. It has  been well observed by Magne, that in the breeding of dairy stock, we  should \"make choice only of animals possessing the _two-fold character  of general vigor, and activity of the mammary system_.\"    The"]]]
