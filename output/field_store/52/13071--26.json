[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3165"],[0,"Rashi (#19)"],[1,"the power of His works, that He may give     them the heritage of the heathen.\"[64]  If the heathen nations     say to Israel: You are robbers, for you have seized the land     of the seven nations (Canaanites), the Israelites can reply:     The entire earth belongs to God, who, having created it,     disposes of it in favor of whomsoever it pleases Him.  It     pleased Him to give it to the seven nations, and it pleased     Him to take it away from them in order to give it to us.     <I>In the beginning, etc.  Bereshit bara</I>].  This verse     should be interpreted according to the Midrash, and it is in     this way that our rabbis apply it to the Torah as having     existed \"before His works of old,\"[65] or to Israel, called     \"the first-fruits of His increase.\"[66]  But if one wishes to     explain these words in their natural meaning, it is necessary     to observe the following method.  In the beginning of the     creation of the heaven and the earth, when the earth was     confusion and chaos, God said: \"Let there be light.\" This     verse does not set forth the order of the creation.  If it     did, the word <H>barishona (Bet Resh Alef Shin Nun He)</H>     would have been necessary, whereas the word <H>reshit (Resh     Alef Shin Yod Tav)</H> is always in the construct, as     in Jer. xxvii. 1, Gen. x. 10, Deut. xviii. 4;[67] likewise     <H>bara (Bet Resh Alef)</H> must here be taken as an     infinitive <H>(Bet Resh Alef with shin dot)</H>; the same     construction occurs in Hosea i. 2.  Shall we assert that the     verse intends to convey that such a thing was created before     another, but that it is elliptical (just as ellipses occur in     Job iii. 10, Is. viii. 4, Amos vi. 12, Is. xlvi. 10)?  But     this difficulty arises: that which existed first were the     waters, since the following verse says, that \"the Spirit of     God moved upon the face of the waters,\" and since the text did     not previously speak of the creation of the waters, the waters    Rashi's exegesis is a bit complicated, because his beliefs  prevented him from realizing that the narrative of Genesis  presupposes a primordial chaos; but his explanations are  ingenious, and do away with other difficulties.  They have been  propounded again as original explanations by modern commentators,  such as Ewald, Bunsen, Schrader, Geiger, etc.  Botticher even  proposed the reading <H>bara (Bet Resh Alef)</H>.  I did not give  the preceding commentary in its entirety, because it is fairly  long and, in this respect, not typical.  Consequently other  quotations will serve a purpose.                  2.  THE SACRIFICE OF ISAAC (Gen. xxii. 1)        1. <I>After these words</I>].  Some of our teachers explain     the expression: \"after the words of Satan,\" who said to God Of     all his meals Abraham sacrifices nothing to Thee, neithe a     bull nor a ram.  He would sacrifice his son, replied God if I     told him to do it.  Others say: \"after the words of Ishmael,\"     who boasted of having undergone circumcision when he was     thirteen years old, and to whom Isaac answered: If God     demanded of me the sacrifice of my entire being, I would do     what he demanded.  Abraham said: <I>Behold, here I am</I>].     Such is the humility of pious men; for this expression     indicates that one is humble, ready to obey.       2. God said: <I>Take now</I>].  This is a formula of prayer;     God seems to say to Abraham: I pray thee, submit thyself to     this test, so that thy faith shall not be doubted.  <I>Thy     son</I>].  I have two sons, replied Abraham.  <I>Thine only     son</I>].  But each is the only son of his mother.  <I>Whom     thou lovest</I>].  I love them both.  <I>Isaac</I>].  Why did not     God name Isaac immediately? In order to trouble Abraham, and     also to reward him for each word, etc.    All these explanations are drawn from Talmudic (<I>Sanhedrim  89b</I>) and Midrashic (<I>Bereshit Rabba</I> and <I>Tanhuma</I>)  sources.  The meaning of the passage being clear, Rashi has  recourse to Haggadic elaborations, which, it must be admitted,  are wholly charming.  Rashi will be seen to be more original in  his commentary on the Song of the Red Sea, the text of which  offers more difficulties.                       3. SONG OF THE RED SEA (Ex. xv. 1)       1. <I>Then sang Moses</I>].  \"Then\": when Moses saw the     miracle, he had the idea of singing a song; similar     construction in Josh. x. 12, I Kings vii. 8.  Moses said to     himself that he would sing, and that is what he did.  Moses     and the children of Israel \"spake, saying, I will sing unto     the Lord.\" The future tense is to be explained in the same way     as in Josh. x. 12 (Joshua, seeing the miracle, conceived the     idea of singing a song, \"and he said in the sight of Israel,\"     etc.), in Num. xxi. 17 (\"Then Israel sang this song, Spring     up, O well; sing ye unto it\"), and in I Kings xi. 7 (thus     explained by the sages of Israel: \"Solomon wished to build a     high place, but he did not build it\").  The \"yod\" (of the     future) applies to the conception.  Such is the natural     meaning of the verse.  But, according to the Midrashic     interpretation, our rabbis see in it an allusion to the     resurrection, and they explain it in the same fashion as the     other passages, with the exception of the verse in Kings,     which they translate: \"Solomon wished to build a high place,     but he did not build it.\"  But our verse cannot be explained     like those in which the future is employed, although the     action takes place immediately, as in Job i. 5 (\"Thus did     Job\"); Num. ix. 23 (\"The Israelites rested in their tents at     the commandment of the Lord\") and 20 (\"when the cloud was a     few days\"), because here the action is continued and is     expressed as well by the future as by the past.  But our song     having been sung only at a certain moment, the explanation     does not apply.       <H>Ki gaoh gaah (Kaf Yod, Gimel Alef with holam He, Gimel with     qamats, Alef with qamats He)</H>].  As the Targum[68] translates.     Another explanation: \"He is most exalted,\" above all     praise, and however numerous our eulogies, I could add to     them; such is not the human king whom one praises without     reason.  <I>The horse and his rider</I>] - The one attached to     the other; the waters carried them off and they descended     together into the sea.  <H>Ramah (Resh Mem He)</H> (hath He     thrown)] like <H>hishlich (He Shin Lamed Yod Final_Kaf)</H>;     the same as in Dan. iii. 21.  The Haggadic Midrash[69] gives     this explanation: one verse employs the verb <H>(Yod Resh     He)</H> the other the verb <H>Ramah (Resh Mem He)</H> which     teaches us that the Egyptians mounted into the air in order     then to descend into the ocean.  The same as in Job xxxviii.     6, \"who laid (<H>yarah (Yod Resh He)</H> ) the corner stone     thereof\" from top to bottom?       2. <H>Ozi vezimrat yah vayei li lishuah (Ayin Zayin Yod, Vav     Zayin Mem Resh Tav, Yod He, Vav Yod He Yod, Lamed Yod, Lamed     Yod Shin Vav Ayin He)</H>].  Onkelos translates: my strength     and my song of praise.  He therefore explains <H>ohzi     (Ayin with qamats Zayin with dagesh and hiriq Yod)</H> as     <H>uzi (Ayin with qubuts, Zayin with dagesh and hiriq Yod)</H>     and <H>vezimrat (Vav Zayin Mem Resh Tav)</H> as <H>vezimrati     (Vav Zayin Mem Resh Tav Yod)</H>  But I am astonished at the     vowelling of the first word, which is unique in Scriptures, if     an exception is made of the three passages in which the two     words are joined.  In all other places it is provided with the     vowel \"u\", for example in Jer. xvi. 19 and Psalms lix. 10.  In     general, when a word of two letters contains the vowel \"o\", if     it is lengthened by a third letter, and if the second letter     has no \"sheva\", the first takes an \"u\": <H>oz (Ayin with holam     Zayin)</H> makes <H>rok, uzi (Resh with sin dot Qof, Ayin with     qubuts Zayin with dagesh Yod</H> makes <H>jok, ruki (Het Qof,     Resh with qubuts Qof with dagesh and hiriq Yod)</H> makes     <H>ol, juki (Ayin with holam Lamed, Het with qubuts Qof with     dagesh and hiriq Yod</H> makes <H>kol ulo (Kaf with holam     Lamed, Ayin with qubuts Lamed with dagesh Vav)</H>[70] makes     <H>kulo (Kaf with qubuts Lamed with dagesh Vav)</H>, as in     Exodus xiv. 7. On the contrary, the three other passages,     namely, our passage, the one in Is. (xii. 2), and that in     Psalms (cxviii. 14), have <H>ozi (Ayin Zayin Yod)</H> vowelled     with a short \"o\"; moreover, these verses do not have     <H>vezimrati (Vav Zayin Mem Resh Tav Yod)</H> but <H>vezimrat     (Vav Zayin Mem Resh Tav)</H>, and all continue with <H>vayei     li lishuah (Vav Yod He Yod, Lamed Yod, Lamed Yod Shin Vav Ayin     He)</H>.  And to give a full explanation of this verse, it is     in my opinion necessary to say that <H>ohzi (Ayin with qamats     Zayin with dagesh Yod)</H> is not equivalent to <H>uzi (Ayin     with qubuts Zayin with dagesh Yod</H> nor <H>vezimrat (Vav     Zayin Mem Resh Tav)</H> to <H>vezimrati (Vav Zayin Mem Resh     Tav Yod),</H> but that <H>ohzi (Ayin with qamats Zayin with     dagesh Yod)</H> is a substantive (without a possessive suffix,     but provided with a paragogic \"yod\"), as in Psalm cxxiii. 1,     Obadiah 3, Deut. xxxiii. 16. The eulogy (of the Hebrews)     therefore signifies: it is the strength and the vengeance of     God that have been my salvation. <H>vezimrat (Vav Zayin Mem     Resh Tav)</H> is thus in the construct with the word God,     exactly as in Judges v.23, Is. ix. 18, Eccl. iii. 18.  As for     the word <H>vezimrat (Vav Zayin Mem Resh Tav)</H> it has the     meaning which the same root has in Lev. xxv. 4 (\"thou shalt     not prune\") and in Is. xxv. 5; that is to say, \"to cut\".  The     meaning of our verse, then, is: \"The strength and the     vengeance of our Lord have been our salvation.\" One must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31751"],[0,"What Bird is That?

Next to the Mockingbird's medley, the rich, mellow whistle of the  Cardinal is the most prominent bird voice in the choir of southern  songsters. Passing most of the time in the undergrowth, where, in spite  of his brilliant colors, he readily conceals himself, he makes no  attempt, when singing, to hide his fiery plumes, but selecting a  conspicuous perch, challenges the attention of the world.    The female Cardinal also sings, but her song has much less volume than  that of her mate, and is more rarely heard. The call-note of both sexes  is a minute; sharp, _cheep_, which one would attribute to a bird half  their size. The Cardinal nests in bushes, laying 3-4 whitish eggs  speckled and spotted with brown, in April.    The Florida Cardinal (_C. c. floridanus_), a slightly smaller, deeper  colored (especially in the female) race of the preceding, inhabits the  peninsula of Florida.      BLUE GROSBEAK    _Guiraca caerulea caerulea. Case 6, Figs. 52, 53_              Should be confused only with the Indigo Bunting,            but it is larger and the male is darker and has            brown wing-bars. L. 7.              _Range._ Nests from Florida to Maryland and            southern Illinois; winters in the tropics,            uncommon east of the Alleghanies.              Washington, very uncommon, S.R., May 1-Sept. 20.            Cambridge, A.V., one instance, May.    The Blue Grosbeak is an unfamiliar bird to most eastern students.  Ridgway states that its haunts resemble those of the Field Sparrow or  Indigo Bunting. Its call is a strong, harsh _ptchick_, its song a  beautiful, but rather feeble warble. The nest is usually built in bushes  and the 3-4 pale bluish white eggs are laid in May.      ROSE-BREASTED GROSBEAK    _Zamelodia ludoviciana. Case 7, Figs. 25, 26_              The male needs no introduction; the streaked            plumage of the female betrays her Sparrow            ancestry; the white stripe over her eye is a            conspicuous mark. Young males in the fall resemble            the female, but have a rose-tinted breast. L. 8.              _Range._ Nests from central Kansas and central New            Jersey north to Canada, and, in the mountains,            south to northern Georgia; winters in the tropics.              Washington, rather common T.V., May 1-30; Aug.            29-Oct. 6. Ossining, tolerably common S.R., May            3-Oct. 1. Cambridge, very common S.R., May            10-Sept. 10. N.

Distinguished alike by plumage and song, the Rose-breast is one of our  most notable bird citizens. His song resembles in form that of the  Robin, but has a more lyrical, flowing, joyous quality, and, unlike the  Robin, he often sings while flying. The call-note of both sexes is a  sharp _peek_ which, like the Cardinal's _cheep_, seems too small for the  bird.    The Rose-breast lives and nests in woodland, particularly  second-growths, building a frail nest ten to twenty feet from the  ground. The 4-5 blue, brown-marked eggs are laid the latter half of May.      INDIGO BUNTING    _Passerina cyanea. Case 7, Figs. 23, 24_              The male, well seen, is unmistakable. The female            is very 'sparrowy' and, unless one gets a            suggestion of blue in her plumage, can best be            identified by her unsparrow-like, sharp _pit_. L.            5-1/2.              _Range._ Nests from Georgia and Louisiana to            Canada; winters in the tropics.              Washington, common S.R., Apl. 29-Oct. 9.

Glen Ellyn, fairly common S.R., May            1-Sept. 22. SE. Minn., common S.R. Apl. 28-Oct. 2.    \"July, July, summer-summer's here; morning, noontide, evening, list to  me\" the Indigo sings in rather hard but brilliant little voice. To me  the words express the rhythm as well as the spirit of the song. We hear  them most often in bushy fields and open second-growths, along  hedge-rows or from briery clumps in which the bird's nest may be hidden.  The pale, bluish white eggs are laid the latter half of May.      PAINTED BUNTING    _Passerina ciris. Case 6, Figs. 49, 50_              The male is one of our most brilliantly colored            birds, the female has the color of a Vireo but the            bill of a Sparrow.              _Range._ Southern States north to southeastern            North Carolina and southern Kansas; winters from            southern Florida southward.    \"Painted\" Bunting he is called, but the brilliancy and luster of his  plumage were not painted by human hands. 'Nonpareil' he has also been  named, and, in the eastern United States, at least, he is without equal  in the brightness of his colors. The bird's haunts are not unlike those  of the Indigo Bunting, and its song is said to resemble the Indigo's but  to be more feeble. It builds in bushes and low trees, laying 3-4 bluish  white, brown-spotted eggs in May.      DICKCISSEL    _Spiza americana. Case 7, Fig. 20_              The yellow on the breast and, in the male, black            crescent will distinguish this species from all            its Sparrow kin. L. 6.              _Range._ Chiefly prairies of the Mississippi            Valley, from Texas and Mississippi north to            Minnesota and southern Ontario; now rare east of            the Alleghanies.              Washington, formerly \"very abundant,\" now seen            only occasionally, May-Aug. Cambridge, casual,            found nesting at Medford, June 9. 1877, where            several birds were observed; not uncommon in            1833-34 (see Bull. Nutt. Orn. Club, III, 1878, 45.            190). N. Ohio, rare S.R., May 1. Glen Ellyn,            rather rare and local S.R., formerly common. May            3-Sept. 5. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 11-Aug. 20.    The Dickcissel is a bird of the fields who, from a weed-stalk or fence  by the wayside, sings his unmusical _dick-dick cissel, cissel, cissel_.  The nest is built on the ground or in a bush and the 4-5 pale blue eggs  are laid the latter half of May.            TANAGERS. FAMILY TANGARIDAE      SCARLET TANAGER    _Piranga erythromelas. Case 7, Figs. 27, 28_              The black wings and tail of the male will            distinguish him from our other two red birds--the            Cardinal and Summer Tanager. The olive-green            female may be known from all our other olive-green            birds by her larger size. L. 7-1/4.              _Range._ Nests from northern Georgia and southern            Kansas to Canada; winters in the tropics.              Washington, common T.V., less common S.R., Apl.            17-Oct. 15. Ossining, common S.R., May 4-Oct. 9.            Cambridge, rather common S.R., May 12-Oct. 1. N.

As a family Tanagers are the most strikingly colored of American birds,  but among the nearly 400 species none appears more brilliant in life  than the male Scarlet Tanager. The leaf-colored female is as difficult  to see as the male is conspicuous. Both have the same characteristic  call--_chip-churr, chip-churr_. The song suggests a Robin's but is more  forced and has a hoarse undertone. They live and nest in the woods,  building on a horizontal limb 10-20 feet up. The 3-4 greenish blue,  brown-marked eggs are laid late in May.      SUMMER TANAGER    _Piranga rubra rubra. Case 5, Figs. 33, 34_              The male is usually red like the Cardinal, but            lacks the Cardinal's crest; the female is more            yellow than the female of the Scarlet Tanager.              _Range._ Southern States; nesting north to            Maryland and Illinois; winters in the tropics.              Washington, uncommon S.R., Apl. 18-Sept. 19.            Cambridge, one record.    The \"Summer Redbird's\" _chicky-tucky-tuck_, is as clearly pronounced and  unmistakable as the Scarlet Tanager's _chip-churr_. Its song is somewhat  sweeter than that of its scarlet cousin, but bears a general resemblance  to it. Both pine and deciduous woods are inhabited by this bird. Its  nesting habits resemble those of the Scarlet Tanager.          SWALLOWS. FAMILY HIRUNDINIDAE      PURPLE MARTIN    _Progne subis subis. Case 5, Fig. 25_              Largest of our Swallows. The female is duller            above than the male, and below is brownish gray.            L. 8.              _Range._ Nests locally from the Gulf to Canada;            winters in the tropics.              Washington, rather common S.R., Apl. 1-Sept. 14.            Ossining, tolerably common S.R., Apl. 27-Sept. 11.            Cambridge, formerly locally common S.R., Apl.            20-Aug. 25. N. Ohio, common S.R. Apl. 1-Sept. 5.            Glen Ellyn, local S.R., Mch. 23-Sept. 10. SE.            Minn., common S.R., Apl. 1-Sept. 9.    Fortunate is the man whose hospitality the Martins accept. Their cheery  notes and sociability make them the best kind of guests. The Audubon  Society will send one plans for a Martin house, and tell one where to  place it. Martins nest in May and lay white eggs.      CLIFF SWALLOW    _Petrochelidon lunifrons lunifrons. Case 6, Fig. 55_              The rusty rump is distinctive.
