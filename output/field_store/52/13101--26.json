After the details which I have already given about my ancestors, it  would be ridiculous to look to heredity for an explanation of the fact.  Nor would any one venture to suggest the words or example of my masters.  Of scientific education, the fruit of college training, I had none  whatever. I never set foot in a lecture hall except to undergo the  ordeal of examinations. Without masters, without guides, often without  books, in spite of poverty, that terrible extinguisher, I went ahead,  persisted, facing my difficulties, until the indomitable bump ended by  shedding its scanty contents. Yes, they were very scanty, yet possibly  of some value, if circumstances had come to their assistance. I was a  born animalist. Why and how? No reply.    We thus have, all of us, in different directions and in a greater  or lesser degree, characteristics that brand us with a special mark,  characteristics of an unfathomable origin. They exist because they  exist; and that is all that any one can say. The gift is not handed  down: the man of talent has a fool for a son. Nor is it acquired; but it  is improved by practice. He who has not the germ of it in his veins will  never possess it, in spite of all the pains of a hothouse education.    That to which we give the name of instinct when speaking of animals is  something similar to genius. It is, in both cases, a peak that rises  above the ordinary level. But instinct is handed down, unchanged and  undiminished, throughout the sequence of a species; it is permanent  and general and in this it differs greatly from genius, which is not  transmissible and changes in different cases. Instinct is the inviolable  heritage of the family and falls to one and all, without distinction.  Here the difference ends. Independent of similarity of structure, it  breaks out like genius, here or elsewhere, for no perceptible reason.  Nothing causes it to be foreseen, nothing in the organization explains  it. If cross-examined on this point, the Dung beetles and the rest, each  with his own peculiar talent, would answer, were we able to understand  them: 'Instinct is the animal's genius.'          CHAPTER VII. THE POND    The pond, the delight of my early childhood, is still a sight whereof my  old eyes never tire. What animation in that verdant world! On the warm  mud of the edges, the frog's little tadpole basks and frisks in its  black legions; down in the water, the orange-bellied newt steers his  way slowly with the broad rudder of his flat tail; among the reeds are  stationed the flotillas of the caddis worms, half protruding from their  tubes, which are now a tiny bit of stick and again a turret of little  shells.    In the deep places, the water beetle dives, carrying with him his  reserves of breath: an air bubble at the tip of the wing cases and,  under the chest, a film of gas that gleams like a silver breastplate;  on the surface, the ballet of those shimmering pearls, the whirligigs,  turns and twists about; hard by there skims the unsubmersible troop of  the pond skaters, who glide along with side strokes similar to those  which the cobbler makes when sewing.    Here are the water boatmen, who swim on their backs with two oars spread  cross-wise, and the flat water scorpions; here, squalidly clad in mud,  is the grub of the largest of our dragonflies, so curious because of its  manner of progression: it fills its hinder parts, a yawning funnel, with  water, spurts it out again and advances just so far as the recoil of its  hydraulic cannon.    The mollusks abound, a peaceful tribe. At the bottom, the plump river  snails discreetly raise their lid, opening ever so little the shutters  of their dwelling; on the level of the water, in the glades of the  aquatic garden, the pond snails--Physa, Limnaea and Planorbis--take  the air. Dark leeches writhe upon their prey, a chunk of earthworm;  thousands of tiny, reddish grubs, future mosquitoes, go spinning around  and twist and curve like so many graceful dolphins.    Yes, a stagnant pool, though but a few feet wide, hatched by the sun, is  an immense world, an inexhaustible mine of observation to the studious  man and a marvel to the child who, tired of his paper boat, diverts his  eyes and thoughts a little with what is happening in the water. Let me  tell what I remember of my first pond, at a time when ideas began to  dawn in my seven-year-old brain.    How shall a man earn his living in my poor native village, with its  inclement weather and its niggardly soil? The owner of a few acres of  grazing land rears sheep. In the best parts, he scrapes the soil with  the swing plow; he flattens it into terraces banked by walls of broken  stones. Pannierfuls of dung are carried up on donkey-back from the  cowshed. Then, in due season, comes the excellent potato, which, boiled  and served hot in a basket of plaited straw, is the chief stand-by in  winter.    Should the crop exceed the needs of the household, the surplus goes to  feed a pig, that precious beast, a treasure of bacon and ham. The ewes  supply butter and curds; the garden boasts cabbages, turnips and even a  few hives in a sheltered corner. With wealth like that one can look fate  in the face.    But we, we have nothing, nothing but the little house inherited by my  mother and its adjoining patch of garden. The meager resources of the  family are coming to an end. It is time to see to it and that quickly.  What is to be done? That is the stern question which father and mother  sat debating one evening.    Hop-o'-my-Thumb, hiding under the woodcutter's stool, listened to his  parents overcome by want. I also, pretending to sleep, with my elbows on  the table, listen not to blood curdling designs, but to grand plans that  set my heart rejoicing. This is how the matter stands: at the bottom of  the village, near the church, at the spot where the water of the large  roofed spring escapes from its underground weir and joins the brook in  the valley, an enterprising man, back from the war, has set up a small  tallow factory. He sells the scrapings of his pans, the burnt fat,  reeking of candle grease, at a low price. He proclaims these wares to be  excellent for fattening ducks.    \"Suppose we bred some ducks,\" says mother. \"They sell very well in town.  Henri would mind them and take them down to the brook.\"    \"Very well,\" says father, \"let's breed some ducks. There may be  difficulties in the way; but we'll have a try.\"    That night, I had dreams of paradise: I was with my ducklings, clad in  their yellow suits; I took them to the pond, I watched them have their  bath, I brought them back again, carrying the more tired ones in a  basket.    A month or two after, the little birds of my dreams were a reality.  There were twenty-four of them. They had been hatched by two hens, of  whom one, the big, black one, was an inmate of the house, while the  other was borrowed from a neighbor.    To bring them up, the former is sufficient, so careful is she of her  adopted family. At first, everything goes perfectly: a tub with two  fingers' depth of water serves as a pond. On sunny days, the ducklings  bathe in it under the anxious eye of the hen.    A fortnight later, the tub is no longer enough. It contains neither  cresses crammed with tiny shellfish nor worms and tadpoles, dainty  morsels both. The time has come for dives and hunts amid the tangle of  the water weeds; and for us the day of trouble has also come. True, the  miller, down by the brook, has fine ducks, easy and cheap to bring up;  the tallow smelter, who has extolled his burnt fat so loudly, has some  as well, for he has the advantage of the waste water from the spring at  the bottom of the village; but how are we, right up there, at the top,  to procure aquatic sports for our broods? In summer, we have hardly  water to drink!    Near the house, in a freestone recess, a scanty source trickles into a  basin made in the rock.. Four or five families have, like ourselves,  to draw their water there with copper pails. By the time that the  schoolmaster's donkey has slaked her thirst and the neighbors have  taken their provision for the day, the basin is dry. We have to wait for  four-and-twenty hours for it to fill. No, this is not the hole in which  the ducks would delight nor indeed in which they would be tolerated.    There remains the brook. To go down to it with the troop of ducklings is  fraught with danger. On the way through the village, we might meet cats,  bold ravishers of small poultry; some surly mongrel might frighten and  scatter the little band; and it would be a hard puzzle to collect it in  its entirety. We must avoid the traffic and take refuge in peaceful and  sequestered spots.    On the hills, the path that climbs behind the chateau soon takes a  sudden turn and widens into a small plain beside the meadows. It skirts  a rocky slope whence trickles, level with the ground, a streamlet,  forming a pond of some size. Here profound solitude reigns all day long.  The ducklings will be well off; and the journey can be made in peace by  a deserted footpath.    You, little man, shall take them to that delectable spot. What a day  it was that marked my first appearance as a herdsman of ducks! Why  must there be a jar to the even tenor of such joys? The too frequent  encounter of my tender skin with the hard ground had given me a large  and painful blister on the heel. Had I wanted to put on the shoes stowed  away in the cupboard for Sundays and holidays, I could not. There was  nothing for it but to go barefoot over the broken stones, dragging my  leg and carrying high the injured heel.    Let us make a start, hobbling along, switch in hand, behind the ducks.  They too, poor little things, have sensitive soles to their feet; they  limp, they quack with fatigue. They would refuse to go any farther if I  did not, from time to time, call a halt under the shelter of an ash.    We are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3424"],[0,"For the Term of His Natural Life (#19)"],[1," into water. If the supposition were not too extravagant, one  might imagine that when the Australian continent was fused, a careless  giant upset the crucible, and spilt Van Diemen's land in the ocean. The  coast navigation is as dangerous as that of the Mediterranean. Passing  from Cape Bougainville to the east of Maria Island, and between the  numerous rocks and shoals which lie beneath the triple height of the  Three Thumbs, the mariner is suddenly checked by Tasman's Peninsula,  hanging, like a huge double-dropped ear-ring, from the mainland. Getting  round under the Pillar rock through Storm Bay to Storing Island, we  sight the Italy of this miniature Adriatic. Between Hobart Town  and Sorrell, Pittwater and the Derwent, a strangely-shaped point of  land--the Italian boot with its toe bent upwards--projects into the bay,  and, separated from this projection by a narrow channel, dotted with  rocks, the long length of Bruny Island makes, between its western  side and the cliffs of Mount Royal, the dangerous passage known as  D'Entrecasteaux Channel. At the southern entrance of D'Entrecasteaux  Channel, a line of sunken rocks, known by the generic name of the  Actaeon reef, attests that Bruny Head was once joined with the shores  of Recherche Bay; while, from the South Cape to the jaws of Macquarie  Harbour, the white water caused by sunken reefs, or the jagged peaks of  single rocks abruptly rising in mid sea, warn the mariner off shore.    It would seem as though nature, jealous of the beauties of her silver  Derwent, had made the approach to it as dangerous as possible; but  once through the archipelago of D'Entrecasteaux Channel, or the less  dangerous eastern passage of Storm Bay, the voyage up the river is  delightful. From the sentinel solitude of the Iron Pot to the smiling  banks of New Norfolk, the river winds in a succession of reaches,  narrowing to a deep channel cleft between rugged and towering cliffs. A  line drawn due north from the source of the Derwent would strike another  river winding out from the northern part of the island, as the Derwent  winds out from the south. The force of the waves, expended, perhaps, in  destroying the isthmus which, two thousand years ago, probably connected  Van Diemen's Land with the continent has been here less violent. The  rounding currents of the Southern Ocean, meeting at the mouth of the  Tamar, have rushed upwards over the isthmus they have devoured, and  pouring against the south coast of Victoria, have excavated there that  inland sea called Port Philip Bay. If the waves have gnawed the south  coast of Van Diemen's Land, they have bitten a mouthful out of the south  coast of Victoria. The Bay is a millpool, having an area of nine hundred  square miles, with a race between the heads two miles across.    About a hundred and seventy miles to the south of this mill-race lies  Van Diemen's Land, fertile, fair, and rich, rained upon by the genial  showers from the clouds which, attracted by the Frenchman's Cap, Wyld's  Crag, or the lofty peaks of the Wellington and Dromedary range, pour  down upon the sheltered valleys their fertilizing streams. No parching  hot wind--the scavenger, if the torment, of the continent--blows upon  her crops and corn. The cool south breeze ripples gently the blue waters  of the Derwent, and fans the curtains of the open windows of the city  which nestles in the broad shadow of Mount Wellington. The hot wind,  born amid the burning sand of the interior of the vast Australian  continent, sweeps over the scorched and cracking plains, to lick up  their streams and wither the herbage in its path, until it meets the  waters of the great south bay; but in its passage across the straits it  is reft of its fire, and sinks, exhausted with its journey, at the feet  of the terraced slopes of Launceston.    The climate of Van Diemen's Land is one of the loveliest in the world.  Launceston is warm, sheltered, and moist; and Hobart Town, protected by  Bruny Island and its archipelago of D'Entrecasteaux Channel and Storm  Bay from the violence of the southern breakers, preserves the mean  temperature of Smyrna; whilst the district between these two towns  spreads in a succession of beautiful valleys, through which glide clear  and sparkling streams. But on the western coast, from the steeple-rocks  of Cape Grim to the scrub-encircled barrenness of Sandy Cape, and  the frowning entrance to Macquarie Harbour, the nature of the country  entirely changes. Along that iron-bound shore, from Pyramid Island and  the forest-backed solitude of Rocky Point, to the great Ram Head, and  the straggling harbour of Port Davey, all is bleak and cheerless. Upon  that dreary beach the rollers of the southern sea complete their circuit  of the globe, and the storm that has devastated the Cape, and united in  its eastern course with the icy blasts which sweep northward from the  unknown terrors of the southern pole, crashes unchecked upon the Huon  pine forests, and lashes with rain the grim front of Mount Direction.  Furious gales and sudden tempests affright the natives of the coast.  Navigation is dangerous, and the entrance to the \"Hell's Gates\" of  Macquarie Harbour--at the time of which we are writing (1833), in the  height of its ill-fame as a convict settlement--is only to be attempted  in calm weather. The sea-line is marked with wrecks. The sunken rocks  are dismally named after the vessels they have destroyed. The air is  chill and moist, the soil prolific only in prickly undergrowth and  noxious weeds, while foetid exhalations from swamp and fen cling close  to the humid, spongy ground. All around breathes desolation; on the face  of nature is stamped a perpetual frown. The shipwrecked sailor, crawling  painfully to the summit of basalt cliffs, or the ironed convict,  dragging his tree trunk to the edge of some beetling plateau, looks down  upon a sea of fog, through which rise mountain-tops like islands; or  sees through the biting sleet a desert of scrub and crag rolling to the  feet of Mount Heemskirk and Mount Zeehan--crouched like two sentinel  lions keeping watch over the seaboard.          CHAPTER II. THE SOLITARY OF \"HELL'S GATES\".        \"Hell's Gates,\" formed by a rocky point, which runs abruptly northward,  almost touches, on its eastern side, a projecting arm of land which  guards the entrance to King's River. In the middle of the gates is a  natural bolt--that is to say, an island-which, lying on a sandy bar in  the very jaws of the current, creates a double whirlpool, impossible  to pass in the smoothest weather. Once through the gates, the convict,  chained on the deck of the inward-bound vessel, sees in front of him the  bald cone of the Frenchman's Cap, piercing the moist air at a height of  five thousand feet; while, gloomed by overhanging rocks, and shadowed  by gigantic forests, the black sides of the basin narrow to the mouth of  the Gordon. The turbulent stream is the colour of indigo, and, being fed  by numerous rivulets, which ooze through masses of decaying vegetable  matter, is of so poisonous a nature that it is not only undrinkable, but  absolutely kills the fish, which in stormy weather are driven in from  the sea. As may be imagined, the furious tempests which beat upon this  exposed coast create a strong surf-line. After a few days of north-west  wind the waters of the Gordon will be found salt for twelve miles up  from the bar. The head-quarters of the settlement were placed on an  island not far from the mouth of this inhospitable river, called Sarah  Island.    Though now the whole place is desolate, and a few rotting posts and logs  alone remain-mute witnesses of scenes of agony never to be revived--in  the year 1833 the buildings were numerous and extensive. On Philip's  Island, on the north side of the harbour, was a small farm, where  vegetables were grown for the use of the officers of the establishment;  and, on Sarah Island, were sawpits, forges, dockyards, gaol,  guard-house, barracks, and jetty. The military force numbered about  sixty men, who, with convict-warders and constables, took charge of  more than three hundred and fifty prisoners. These miserable wretches,  deprived of every hope, were employed in the most degrading labour.  No beast of burden was allowed on the settlement; all the pulling and  dragging was done by human beings. About one hundred \"good-conduct\" men  were allowed the lighter toil of dragging timber to the wharf, to  assist in shipbuilding; the others cut down the trees that fringed the  mainland, and carried them on their shoulders to the water's edge. The  denseness of the scrub and bush rendered it necessary for a \"roadway,\"  perhaps a quarter of a mile in length, to be first constructed; and the  trunks of trees, stripped of their branches, were rolled together in  this roadway, until a \"slide\" was made, down which the heavier logs  could be shunted towards the harbour. The timber thus obtained was made  into rafts, and floated to the sheds, or arranged for transportation  to Hobart Town. The convicts were lodged on Sarah Island, in barracks  flanked by a two-storied prison, whose \"cells\" were the terror of the  most hardened. Each morning they received their breakfast of porridge,  water, and salt, and then rowed, under the protection of their guard, to  the wood-cutting stations, where they worked without food, until night.  The launching and hewing of the timber compelled them to work up to  their waists in water. Many of them were heavily ironed. Those who died  were buried on a little plot of ground, called Halliday's Island (from  the name of the first man buried there), and a plank stuck into the  earth, and carved with the initials of the deceased, was the only  monument vouchsafed him.    Sarah Island, situated at the south-east corner of the harbour, is long  and low. The commandant's house was built in the centre, having the  chaplain's house and barracks between"]]]
