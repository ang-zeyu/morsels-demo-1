The illusion was so complete, that you expected, by  looking down, to see the Tugela lashing at her banks, tossing the spray  hundreds of feet in air, and battling with her sides of rock.  It was  like the roar of Niagara in a gale, and yet when you did look below, not  a leaf was stirring, and the Tugela was slipping forward, flat and  sluggish, and in peace.    The long procession of yellow figures was still advancing along the  bottom of the valley, toward the right, when on the crest of the  farthermost hill fourteen of them appeared suddenly, and ran forward and  sprang into the trenches.    Perched against the blue sky on the highest and most distant of the three  hills, they looked terribly lonely and insufficient, and they ran about,  this way and that, as though they were very much surprised to find  themselves where they were.  Then they settled down into the Boer trench,  from our side of it, and began firing, their officer, as his habit is,  standing up behind them.  The hill they had taken had evidently been  abandoned to them by the enemy, and the fourteen men in khaki had taken  it by \"default.\"  But they disappeared so suddenly into the trench, that  we knew they were not enjoying their new position in peace, and every one  looked below them, to see the arriving reinforcements.  They came at  last, to the number of ten, and scampered about just as the others had  done, looking for cover.  It seemed as if we could almost hear the  singing of the bullet when one of them dodged, and it was with a distinct  sense of relief, and of freedom from further responsibility, that we saw  the ten disappear also, and become part of the yellow stones about them.  Then a very wonderful movement began to agitate the men upon the two  remaining hills.  They began to creep up them as you have seen seaweed  rise with the tide and envelop a rock.  They moved in regiments, but each  man was as distinct as is a letter of the alphabet in each word on this  page, black with letters.  We began to follow the fortunes of individual  letters.  It was a most selfish and cowardly occupation, for you knew you  were in no greater danger than you would be in looking through the  glasses of a mutoscope.  The battle unrolled before you like a panorama.  The guns on our side of the valley had ceased, the hurricane in the  depths below had instantly spent itself, and the birds and insects had  again begun to fill our hill with drowsy twitter and song.  But on the  other, half the men were wrapping the base of the hill in khaki, which  rose higher and higher, growing looser and less tightly wrapt as it spun  upward.  Halfway to the crest there was a broad open space of green  grass, and above that a yellow bank of earth, which supported the track  of the railroad.  This green space spurted with tiny geysers of yellow  dust.  Where the bullets came from or who sent them we could not see.  But the loose ends of the bandage of khaki were stretching across this  green space and the yellow spurts of dust rose all around them.  The men  crossed this fire zone warily, looking to one side or the other, as the  bullets struck the earth heavily, like drops of rain before a shower.    The men had their heads and shoulders bent as though they thought a roof  was about to fall on them; some ran from rock to rock, seeking cover  properly; others scampered toward the safe vantage-ground behind the  railroad embankment; others advanced leisurely, like men playing golf.  The silence, after the hurricane of sounds, was painful; we could not  hear even the Boer rifles.  The men moved like figures in a dream,  without firing a shot.  They seemed each to be acting on his own account,  without unison or organization.  As I have said, you ceased considering  the scattered whole, and became intent on the adventures of individuals.  These fell so suddenly, that you waited with great anxiety to learn  whether they had dropped to dodge a bullet or whether one had found them.  The men came at last from every side, and from out of every ridge and  dried-up waterway.  Open spaces which had been green a moment before were  suddenly dyed yellow with them.  Where a company had been clinging to the  railroad embankment, there stood one regiment holding it, and another  sweeping over it.  Heights that had seemed the goal, became the  resting-place of the stretcher-bearers, until at last no part of the hill  remained unpopulated, save a high bulging rampart of unprotected and open  ground.  And then, suddenly, coming from the earth itself, apparently,  one man ran across this open space and leaped on top of the trench which  crowned the hill.  He was fully fifteen yards in advance of all the rest,  entirely unsupported, and alone.  And he had evidently planned it so, for  he took off his helmet and waved it, and stuck it on his rifle and waved  it again, and then suddenly clapped it on his head and threw his gun to  his shoulder.  He stood so, pointing down into the trench, and it seemed  as though we could hear him calling upon the Boers behind it to  surrender.    A few minutes later the last of the three hills was mounted by the West  Yorks, who were mistaken by their own artillery for Boers, and fired upon  both by the Boers and by their own shrapnel and lyddite.  Four men were  wounded, and, to save themselves, a line of them stood up at full length  on the trench and cheered and waved at the artillery until it had ceased  to play upon them.  The Boers continued to fire upon them with rifles for  over two hours.  But it was only a demonstration to cover the retreat of  the greater number, and at daybreak the hills were in complete and  peaceful possession of the English.    These hills were a part of the same Railway Hill which four nights before  the Inniskillings and a composite regiment had attempted to take by a  frontal attack with the loss of six hundred men, among whom were three  colonels.  By this flank attack, and by using nine regiments instead of  one, the same hills and two others were taken with two hundred  casualties.  The fact that this battle, which was called the Battle of  Pieter's Hill, and the surrender of General Cronje and his forces to Lord  Roberts, both took place on the anniversary of the battle of Majuba Hill,  made the whole of Buller's column feel that the ill memory of that  disaster had been effaced.        II--THE RELIEF OF LADYSMITH      After the defeat of the Boers at the battle of Pieter's Hill there were  two things left for them to do.  They could fall back across a great  plain which stretched from Pieter's Hill to Bulwana Mountain, and there  make their last stand against Buller and the Ladysmith relief column, or  they could abandon the siege of Ladysmith and slip away after having held  Buller at bay for three months.    Bulwana Mountain is shaped like a brick and blocks the valley in which  Ladysmith lies.  The railroad track slips around one end of the brick,  and the Dundee trail around the other.  It was on this mountain that the  Boers had placed their famous gun, Long Tom, with which they began the  bombardment of Ladysmith, and with which up to the day before Ladysmith  was relieved they had thrown three thousand shells into that miserable  town.    If the Boers on retreating from Pieter's Hill had fortified this mountain  with the purpose of holding off Buller for a still longer time, they  would have been under a fire from General White's artillery in the town  behind them and from Buller's naval guns in front.  Their position would  not have been unlike that of Humpty Dumpty on the wall, so they wisely  adopted the only alternative and slipped away.  This was on Tuesday  night, while the British were hurrying up artillery to hold the hills  they had taken that afternoon.    By ten o'clock the following morning from the top of Pieter's Hill you  could still see the Boers moving off along the Dundee road.  It was an  easy matter to follow them, for the dust hung above the trail in a yellow  cloud, like mist over a swamp.  There were two opinions as to whether  they were halting at Bulwana or passing it, on their way to Laing's Neck.  If they were going only to Bulwana there was the probability of two  weeks' more fighting before they could be dislodged.  If they had avoided  Bulwana, the way to Ladysmith was open.    Lord Dundonald, who is in command of a brigade of irregular cavalry, was  scouting to the left of Bulwana, far in advance of our forces.  At sunset  he arrived, without having encountered the Boers, at the base of Bulwana.  He could either return and report the disappearance of the enemy or he  could make a dash for it and enter Ladysmith.  His orders were \"to go,  look, see,\" and avoid an action, and the fact that none of his brigade  was in the triumphant procession which took place three days later has  led many to think that in entering the besieged town without orders he  offended the commanding general.  In any event, it is a family row and of  no interest to the outsider.  The main fact is that he did make a dash  for it, and just at sunset found himself with two hundred men only a mile  from the \"Doomed City.\"  His force was composed of Natal Carbiniers and  Imperial Light Horse.  He halted them, and in order that honors might be  even, formed them in sections with the half sections made up from each of  the two organizations.  All the officers were placed in front, and with a  cheer they started to race across the plain.    The wig-waggers on Convent Hill had already seen them, and the  townspeople and the garrison were rushing through the streets to meet  them, cheering and shouting, and some of them weeping.  Others, so  officers tell me, who were in the different camps, looked down upon the  figures galloping across the plain in the twilight, and continued making  tea.

The disease was tic douloureux,  which was relieved by Dr. M.    229. _The preservation of the teeth requires that they be frequently  examined._ When a part of the enamel is removed, and a small portion  of the body of the tooth has become carious, in many instances such  teeth may be preserved from further decay by having them filled or  \"plugged\" with _gold foil_. All amalgams, pastes, and cheap patent  articles for filling, should be avoided, if you would preserve both  the teeth and the general health.    230. The practice of cracking nuts with the teeth, or of lifting heavy  bodies, and the constant habit of biting thread, should be avoided, as  they finally destroy the enamel.    231. _All acidulated drinks and mineral waters, that \"set the teeth on  edge,\" are injurious._ All tooth-powders and washes that contain any  article that is acid, corrosive, or grinding, should be banished from  the toilet. Tobacco is not a preservative of the teeth. It contains  \"grit,\" which wears away the enamel; beside, when chewed, it  debilitates the vessels of the gums, turns the teeth yellow, and  renders the breath and the appearance of the mouth disagreeable.    232. Healthy persons have generally sound teeth, while feeble persons  have decayed teeth. For this reason, we should try to learn and  practise the few simple rules that promote health.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    Give an illustration of the removal of sound teeth. 229. How may  decaying teeth be preserved? What should be avoided in the filling of  teeth? 230. What practices should also be avoided? 231. What is said  of acidulated drinks? What effect has the chewing of tobacco upon the  teeth? 232. What is one reason for preserving health?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=          CHAPTER XIII.    THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS.      233. From the earliest existence of the human system to the last ray  of life, change is impressed upon it by the Giver of this curious  fabric. New atoms of matter are deposited, while the old and now  useless particles are constantly removed. The material necessary to  sustain the growth of the body in early life, and also to repair the  waste that is unceasing to animal existence, is the food we eat.    234. Food, animal or vegetable, contains most of the elements of the  different tissues of the system, yet it must undergo certain essential  alterations before it can become a part of the body. The first change  is effected by the action of the _Digestive Organs_.      ANATOMY OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS    235. The DIGESTIVE ORGANS are the _Mouth_, _Teeth_,[7] _Sal'i-va-ry  Glands_, _Phar'ynx_, _OE-soph'a-gus_, (gullet,) _Stom'ach_,  _In-tes'tines_, (bowels,) _Lac'te-als_, (milk, or chyle vessels,)  _Tho-rac'ic Duct_, _Liv'er_, and the _Pan'cre-as_, (sweetbread.)       [7] See Chapter XII.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    233. What is impressed upon the human system from its earliest  existence? What maintains this change? 234. Has animal or vegetable  food any resemblance to the different tissues of which it finally  forms a part? By what organs is the first change in the food effected?  235-258. _Give the anatomy of the digestive organs._ 235. Name them.  236. Describe the mouth.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    MOUTH is an irregular cavity, which contains the instruments of  mastication and the organs of taste. It is bounded in front by the  lips; on each side by the internal surface of the cheeks; above, by  the _hard palate_ (roof of the mouth) and teeth of the upper jaw;  below, by the tongue and teeth of the lower jaw; behind, it is  continuous with the pharynx, but is separated from it by a kind of  movable curtain, called the _soft palate_. This may be elevated or  depressed, so as to close the passage or leave it free.    237. The SALIVARY GLANDS are six in number; three on each side of the  jaw. They are called the _pa-rot'id_, the _sub-max'il-la-ry_ and the  _sub-lin'gual_.    [Illustration: Fig. 58.

The PAROTID GLAND, the largest, is situated in front of the  external ear, and behind the angle of the jaw.

Its excretory duct (Wharton's) opens into the mouth by  the side of the _frae'num lin'guae_, (bridle of the tongue.)    240. The _SUBLINGUAL GLAND_ is elongated and flattened, and situated  beneath the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, on each side of  the fraenum linguae. It has seven or eight small ducts, which open into  the mouth by the side of the bridle of the tongue.    _Observation._ In the \"mumps,\" the parotid gland is diseased. The  swelling under the tongue called the \"frog\" is a disease of the  sublingual gland.    [Illustration: Fig. 59.

The PHARYNX is a membranous sac, situated upon the upper portion  of the spinal column. It extends from the base of the skull to the top  of the _tra'che-a_, (windpipe,) and is continuous with the oesophagus.  From the pharynx are four passages; one opens upward and forward to  the nose, the second leads forward to the mouth, the third downward to  the trachea and lungs, the fourth downward and backward to the  stomach.    242. The OESOPHAGUS is a large membranous tube that extends behind the  trachea, the heart, and lungs, pierces the diaphragm, and terminates  in the stomach. It is composed of two membranes--an internal, or  mucous, and a muscular coat. The latter is composed of two sets of  fibres; one extends lengthwise, the other is arranged in circular  bands.    243. The STOMACH is situated in the left side of the abdomen,  immediately below and in contact with the diaphragm. It has two  openings; one connected with the oesophagus, called the _car'di-ac_  orifice; the other connected with the upper portion of the small  intestine, called the _py-lor'ic_ orifice. It is composed of three  coats, or membranes. The exterior or serous coat is very tough and  strong, and invests every part of this important organ. The middle, or  muscular coat is composed of two layers of muscular fibres, one set of  which is arranged longitudinally, the other circularly. The interior  coat is called the mucous, and is arranged in _ru'gae_, (folds.) The  stomach is provided with a multitude of small glands, in which is  secreted the gastric fluid.    _Illustration._ The three coats of the stomach anatomically resemble  tripe, which is a preparation of the largest stomach of the cow or ox.  The outer coat is smooth and highly polished. The middle coat is  composed of minute threads, which are arranged in two layers. The  fibres of these layers cross each other. The inner coat is soft, and  presents many folds, usually named \"the honey-comb.\"      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    241. Describe the pharynx and the passages leading from it. 242.

The INTESTINES, or alimentary canal, are divided into two  parts--the _small_ and _large_. The small intestine is about  twenty-five feet in length, and is divided into three portions,  namely, the _Du-o-de'num_, the _Je-ju'num_, and the _Il'e-um_. The  large intestine is about five feet in length, and is divided into  three parts, namely, the _Cae'cum_, the _Co'lon_, and the _Rec'tum_.  (Appendix D.)    245. The DUODENUM is somewhat larger than the rest of the small  intestine, and has received its name from being in length about the  breadth of twelve fingers. It commences at the pylorus, and ascends  obliquely backward to the under surface of the liver. It then descends  perpendicularly in front of the right kidney, and passes transversely  across the lower portion of the spinal column, behind the colon, and  terminates in the jejunum. The ducts from the liver and pancreas open  into the perpendicular portion, about six inches from the stomach.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    244. Explain fig. 60.
