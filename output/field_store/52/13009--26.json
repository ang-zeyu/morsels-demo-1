Percy loved her truly and with a depth of passion proportionate to his  own curious dual personality: it were sacrilege, almost, to doubt the  intensity of his love. But nevertheless she had at all times a feeling  as if he were holding himself and his emotions in check, as if his love,  as if she, Marguerite, his wife, were but secondary matters in his life;  as if her anxieties, her sorrow when he left her, her fears for his  safety were but small episodes in the great book of life which he had  planned out and conceived for himself.    Then she would hate herself for such thoughts: they seemed like doubts  of him. Did any man ever love a woman, she asked herself, as Percy loved  her? He was difficult to understand, and perhaps--oh! that was an awful  \"perhaps\"--perhaps there lurked somewhere in his mind a slight mistrust  of her. She had betrayed him once! unwittingly 'tis true! did he fear  she might do so again?    And to-night after her guests had gone she threw open the great windows  that gave on the beautiful terrace, with its marble steps leading down  to the cool river beyond. Everything now seemed so peaceful and still;  the scent of the heliotrope made the midnight air swoon with its  intoxicating fragrance: the rhythmic murmur of the waters came gently  echoing from below, and from far away there came the melancholy cry of a  night-bird on the prowl.    That cry made Marguerite shudder: her thoughts flew back to the  episodes of this night and to Chauvelin, the dark bird of prey with his  mysterious death-dealing plans, his subtle intrigues which all tended  towards the destruction of one man: his enemy, the husband whom  Marguerite loved.    Oh! how she hated these wild adventures which took Percy away from her  side. Is not a woman who loves--be it husband or child--the most truly  selfish, the most cruelly callous creature in the world, there, where  the safety and the well-being of the loved one is in direct conflict  with the safety and well-being of others.    She would right gladly have closed her eyes to every horror perpetrated  in France, she would not have known what went on in Paris, she wanted  her husband! And yet month after month, with but short intervals, she  saw him risk that precious life of his, which was the very essence of  her own soul, for others! for others! always for others!    And she! she! Marguerite, his wife, was powerless to hold him back!  powerless to keep him beside her, when that mad fit of passion seized  him to go on one of those wild quests, wherefrom she always feared he  could not return alive: and this, although she might use every noble  artifice, every tender wile of which a loving and beautiful wife is  capable.    At times like those her own proud heart was filled with hatred and with  envy towards everything that took him away from her: and to-night all  these passionate feelings which she felt were quite unworthy of her and  of him seemed to surge within her soul more tumultuously than ever. She  was longing to throw herself in his arms, to pour out into his loving  ear all that she suffered, in fear and anxiety, and to make one more  appeal to his tenderness and to that passion which had so often made him  forget the world at her feet.    And so instinctively she walked along the terrace towards that more  secluded part of the garden just above the river bank, where she had  so oft wandered hand in hand with him, in the honeymoon of their  love. There great clumps of old-fashioned cabbage roses grew in untidy  splendour, and belated lilies sent intoxicating odours into the air,  whilst the heavy masses of Egyptian and Michaelmas daisies looked like  ghostly constellations in the gloom.    She thought Percy must soon be coming this way. Though it was so late,  she knew that he would not go to bed. After the events of the night, his  ruling passion, strong in death, would be holding him in its thrall.    She too felt wide awake and unconscious of fatigue; when she reached  the secluded path beside the river, she peered eagerly up and down, and  listened for a sound.    Presently it seemed to her that above the gentle clapper of the waters  she could hear a rustle and the scrunching of the fine gravel under  carefully measured footsteps. She waited a while. The footsteps seemed  to draw nearer, and soon, although the starlit night was very dark, she  perceived a cloaked and hooded figure approaching cautiously toward her.    \"Who goes there?\" she called suddenly.    The figure paused: then came rapidly forward, and a voice said timidly:    \"Ah! Lady Blakeney!\"    \"Who are you?\" asked Marguerite peremptorily.    \"It is I... Desiree Candeille,\" replied the midnight prowler.    \"Demoiselle Candeille!\" ejaculated Marguerite, wholly taken by surprise.  \"What are you doing here? alone? and at this hour?\"    \"Sh-sh-sh...\" whispered Candeille eagerly, as she approached quite close  to Marguerite and drew her hood still lower over her eyes. \"I am all  alone ... I wanted to see someone--you if possible, Lady Blakeney... for  I could not rest... I wanted to know what had happened.\"    \"What had happened? When? I don't understand.\"    \"What happened between Citizen Chauvelin and your husband?\" asked  Candeille.    \"What is that to you?\" replied Marguerite haughtily.    \"I pray you do not misunderstand me...\" pleaded Candeille eagerly. \"I  know my presence in your house... the quarrel which I provoked must have  filled your heart with hatred and suspicion towards me... but oh! how  can I persuade you?... I acted unwillingly... will you not believe  me?... I was that man's tool... and... Oh God!\" she added with sudden,  wild vehemence, \"if only you could know what tyranny that accursed  government of France exercises over poor helpless women or men who  happen to have fallen within reach of its relentless clutches...\"    Her voice broke down in a sob. Marguerite hardly knew what to say or  think. She had always mistrusted this woman with her theatrical ways and  stagy airs, from the very first moment she saw her in the tent on the  green: and she did not wish to run counter against her instinct, in  anything pertaining to the present crisis. And yet in spite of her  mistrust the actress' vehement words found an echo in the depths of her  own heart. How well she knew that tyranny of which Candeille spoke with  such bitterness! Had she not suffered from it, endured terrible sorrow  and humiliation, when under the ban of that same appalling tyranny  she had betrayed the identity--then unknown to her--of the Scarlet  Pimpernel?    Therefore when Candeille paused after those last excited words, she said  with more gentleness than she had shown hitherto, though still quite  coldly:    \"But you have not yet told me why you came back here to-night? If  Citizen Chauvelin was your taskmaster, then you must know all that has  occurred.\"    \"I had a vague hope that I might see you.\"    \"For what purpose?\"    \"To warn you if I could.\"    \"I need no warning.\"    \"Or are too proud to take one.... Do you know, Lady Blakeney, that  Citizen Chauvelin has a personal hatred against your husband?\"    \"How do you know that?\" asked Marguerite, with her suspicions once more  on the qui-vive. She could not understand Candeille's attitude. This  midnight visit, the vehemence of her language, the strange mixture of  knowledge and ignorance which she displayed. What did this woman know of  Chauvelin's secret plans? Was she his open ally, or his helpless tool?  And was she even now playing a part taught her or commanded her by that  prince of intriguers?    Candeille, however, seemed quite unaware of the spirit of antagonism  and mistrust which Marguerite took but little pains now to disguise. She  clasped her hands together, and her voice shook with the earnestness of  her entreaty.    \"Oh!\" she said eagerly, \"have I not seen that look of hatred in  Chauvelin's cruel eyes?... He hates your husband, I tell you.... Why I  know not... but he hates him.. and means that great harm shall come to  Sir Percy through this absurd duel.... Oh! Lady Blakeney, do not let him  go... I entreat you, do not let him go!\"    But Marguerite proudly drew back a step or two, away from the reach of  those hands, stretched out towards her in such vehement appeal.    \"You are overwrought, Mademoiselle,\" she said coldly. \"Believe me, I  have no need either of your entreaties or of your warning.... I should  like you to think that I have no wish to be ungrateful... that I  appreciate any kind thought you may have harboured for me in your  mind.... But beyond that... please forgive me if I say it somewhat  crudely--I do not feel that the matter concerns you in the least.... The  hour is late,\" she added more gently, as if desiring to attenuate the  harshness of her last words. \"Shall I send my maid to escort you home?  She is devoted and discreet...\"    \"Nay!\" retorted the other in tones of quiet sadness, \"there is no need  of discretion... I am not ashamed of my visit to you to-night.... You  are very proud, and for your sake I will pray to God that sorrow and  humiliation may not come to you, as I feared.... We are never likely  to meet again, Lady Blakeney... you will not wish it, and I shall have  passed out of your life as swiftly as I had entered into it.... But  there was another thought lurking in my mind when I came to-night....  In case Sir Percy goes to France... the duel is to take place in or near  Boulogne... this much I do know... would you not wish to go with him?\"    \"Truly, Mademoiselle, I must repeat to you...\"    \"That 'tis no concern of mine... I know... I own that.... But, you see  when I came back here to-night in the silence and the darkness--I had  not guessed that you would be so proud... I thought that I, a woman,  would know how to touch your womanly heart.... I was clumsy, I  suppose.... I made so sure that you would wish to go with your husband,  in case... in case"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27868"],[0,"The Glow-Worm and Other Beetles (#19)"],[1,"CEROCOMAE, MYLABRES AND ZONITES      All has not been told concerning the Meloidae, those strange  parasites, some of which, the Sitares and the Oil-beetles, attach  themselves, like the tiniest of Lice, to the fleece of various Bees to  get themselves carried into the cell where they will destroy the egg  and afterwards feed upon the ration of honey. A most unexpected  discovery, made a few hundred yards from my door, has warned me once  again how dangerous it is to generalize. To take it for granted, as  the mass of data hitherto collected seemed to justify us in doing,  that all the Meloidae of our country usurp the stores of honey  accumulated by the Bees, was surely a most judicious and natural  generalization. Many have accepted it without hesitation; and I for my  part was one of them. For on what are we to base our conviction when  we imagine that we are stating a law? We think to take our stand upon  the general; and we plunge into the quicksands of error. And behold,  the law of the Meloidae has to be struck off the statutes, a fate  common to many others, as this chapter will prove.    On the 16th of July, 1883, I was digging, with my son Emile, in the  sandy heap where, a few days earlier, I had been observing the labours  and the surgery of the Mantis-killing Tachytes. My purpose was to  collect a few cocoons of this Digger-wasp. The cocoons were turning up  in abundance under my pocket-trowel, when Emile presented me with an  unknown object. Absorbed in my task of collection, I slipped the find  into my box without examining it further than with a rapid glance. We  left the spot. Half-way home, the ardour of my search became assuaged;  and a thought of the problematical object, so negligently dropped into  the box among the cocoons, flashed across my mind.    \"Hullo!\" I said to myself. \"Suppose it were _that_? Why not? But, no,  yes, it _is_ that; that's just what it is!\"    Then, suddenly turning to Emile, who was rather surprised by this  soliloquy:    \"My boy,\" I said, \"you have had a magnificent find. It's a  pseudochrysalis of the Meloidae. It's a document of incalculable  value; you've struck a fresh vein in the extraordinary records of  these creatures. Let us look at it closely and at once.\"    The thing was taken from the box, dusted by blowing on it and  carefully examined. I really had before my eyes the pseudochrysalis of  some Meloid. Its shape was unfamiliar to me. No matter: I was an old  hand and could not mistake its source. Everything assured me that I  was on the track of an insect that rivalled the Sitares and the  Oil-beetles in the strangeness of its transformations; and, what was a  still more precious fact, its occurrence amid the burrows of the  Mantis-killer told me that its habits would be wholly different.    \"It's very hot, my poor Emile; we are both of us pretty done. Never  mind: let's go back to our sand-hill and dig and have another search.  I must have the larva that comes before the pseudochrysalis; I must,  if possible, have the insect that comes out of it.\"    Success responded amply to our zeal. We found a goodly number of  pseudochrysalids. More often still, we unearthed larvae which were  busy eating the Mantes, the rations of the Tachytes. Are these really  the larvae that turn into the pseudochrysalids? It seems very  probable, but there is room for doubt. Rearing them at home will  dispel the mists of probability and replace them by the light of  certainty. But that is all: I have not a vestige of the perfect insect  to inform me of the nature of the parasite. The future, let us hope,  will fill this gap. Such was the result of the first trench opened in  the heap of sand. Later searches enriched my harvest a little, without  furnishing me with fresh data.    Let us now proceed to examine my double find. And first of all the  pseudochrysalis, which put me on the alert. It is a motionless, rigid  body, of a waxen yellow, smooth, shiny, curved like a fish-hook  towards the head, which is inflected. Under a very powerful  magnifying-glass the surface is seen to be strewn with very tiny  points which are slightly raised and shinier than the surface. There  are thirteen segments, including the head. The dorsal surface is  convex, the ventral surface flat. A blunt ridge divides the two  surfaces. The three thoracic segments bear each a pair of tiny conical  nipples, of a deep rusty red, signs of the future legs. The stigmata  are very distinct, appearing as specks of a deeper red than the rest  of the integuments. There is one pair, the largest, on the second  segment of the thorax, almost on the line dividing it from the first  segment. Then follow eight pairs, one on each segment of the abdomen  except the last, making in all nine pairs of stigmata. The last pair,  that of the eighth abdominal segment, is the smallest.    The anal extremity displays no peculiarity. The cephalic mask  comprises eight cone-shaped tubercles, dark red like the tubercles of  the legs. Six of these are arranged in two lateral rows; the others  are between the two rows. In each row of three nipples, the one in the  middle is the largest; it no doubt corresponds with the mandibles. The  length of this organism varies greatly, fluctuating between 8 and 15  millimetres.[1] Its width is from 3 to 4 millimetres.[2]    [Footnote 1: .312 to .585 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]    [Footnote 2: .117 to .156 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]    Apart from the general configuration, it will be seen that we have  here the strikingly characteristic appearance of the pseudochrysalids  of the Sitares, Oil-beetles and Zonites. There are the same rigid  integuments, of the red of a cough-lozenge or virgin wax; the same  cephalic mask, in which the future mouth-parts are represented by  faintly marked tubercles; the same thoracic studs, which are the  vestiges of the legs; the same distribution of the stigmata. I was  therefore firmly convinced that the parasite of the Mantis-hunters  could only be a Meloid.    Let us also record the description of the strange larva found  devouring the heap of Mantes in the burrows of the Tachytes. It is  naked, blind, white, soft and sharply curved. Its general appearance  suggests the larva of some Weevil. I should be even more accurate if I  compared it with the secondary larva of _Meloe cicatricosus_, of which  I once published a drawing in the _Annales des sciences  naturelles_.[3] If we reduce the dimensions considerably, we shall  have something very like the parasite of the Tachytes.    [Footnote 3: It was his essays in this periodical, on the  metamorphoses of the Sitares and Oil-beetles, that procured Fabre his  first reputation as an entomologist.--_Translator's Note_.]    The head is large, faintly tinged with red. The mandibles are strong,  bent into a pointed hook, black at the tip and a fiery red at the  base. The antennae are very short, inserted close to the root of the  mandibles. I count three joints: the first thick and globular, the  other two cylindrical, the second of these cut short abruptly. There  are twelve segments, apart from the head, divided by fairly definite  grooves. The first thoracic segment is a little longer than the rest,  with the dorsal plate very slightly tinged with russet, as is the top  of the head. Beginning with the tenth segment, the body tapers a  little. A slight scalloped rim divides the dorsal from the ventral  surface.    The legs are short, white and transparent and end in a feeble claw. A  pair of stigmata on the mesothorax, near the line of junction with the  prothorax; a stigma on either side of the first eight abdominal  segments; in all nine pairs of stigmata, distributed like those of the  pseudochrysalis. These stigmata are small, tinged with red and rather  difficult to distinguish. Varying in size, like the pseudochrysalid  which seems to come from it, this larva averages nearly half an inch  in length and an eighth of an inch in width.    The six little legs, feeble though they be, perform services which one  would not at first suspect. They embrace the Mantis that is being  devoured and hold her under the mandibles, while the grub, lying on  its side, takes its meal at its ease. They also serve for locomotion.  On a firm surface, such as the wooden top of my table, the larva can  move about quite well; it toddles along, dragging its belly, with its  body straight from end to end. On fine, loose sand, change of position  becomes difficult. The grub now bends itself into a bow; it wriggles  upon its back, upon its side; it crawls a little way; it digs and  heaves with its mandibles. But let a less crumbling support come to  its assistance; and pilgrimages of some length are not beyond its  powers.    I reared my guests in a box divided into compartments by means of  paper partitions. Each space, representing about the capacity of a  Tachytes-cell, received its layer of sand, its pile of Mantes and its  larva. And more than one disturbance arose in this refectory, where I  had reckoned upon keeping the banqueters isolated one from the other,  each at its special table. This larva, which had finished its ration  the day before, was discovered next day in another chamber, where it  was sharing its neighbour's repast. It had therefore climbed the  partition, which for that matter was of no great height, or else had  forced its way through some chink. This is enough, I think, to prove  that the grub is not a strict stay-at-home, as are the larvae of the  Sitares and the Oil-beetles when devouring the ration of the  Anthophora.    I imagine that, in the burrows of the Tachytes, the grub, when its  heap of Mantes is consumed, moves from cell to cell until it has  satisfied its appetite. Its subterranean excursions cannot cover a  wide range, but they enable it to visit a few adjacent cells. I have  mentioned how greatly the Tachytes' provision of Mantes varies.[4] The  smaller rations certainly fall to the males, "]]]
