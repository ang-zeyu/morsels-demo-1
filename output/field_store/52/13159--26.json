Something, perhaps, remains to be said concerning the causes which seem  to have led to the development of these giant birds, as well as the  reasons for their flightless condition and peculiar distribution, for it  will be noticed that, with the exception of the African and South  American ostriches the great flightless birds as a rule are, and were,  confined to uninhabited or sparsely populated islands, and this is  equally true of the many small, but equally flightless birds. It is a  seemingly harsh law of nature that all living beings shall live in a  more or less active struggle with each other and with their  surroundings, and that those creatures which possess some slight  advantage over their fellows in the matter of speed, or strength, or  ability to adapt themselves to surrounding conditions, shall prosper at  the expense of the others. In the power of flight, birds have a great  safeguard against changes of climate with their accompanying variations  in the supply of food, and, to a lesser extent, against their various  enemies, including man. This power of flight, acquired early in their  geological history, has enabled birds to spread over the length and  breadth of the globe as no other group of animals has done, and to  thrive under the most varying conditions, and it would seem that if this  power were lost it must sooner or later work harm. Now to-day we find no  great wingless birds in thickly populated regions, or where beasts of  prey abound; the ostriches roam the desert wastes of Arabia, Africa and  South America where men are few and savage beasts scarce, and against  these is placed a fleetness of foot inherited from ancestors who  acquired it before man was. The heavy cassowaries dwell in the thinly  inhabited, thickly wooded islands of Malaysia, where again there are no  large carnivores and where the dense vegetation is some safeguard  against man; the emu comes from the Australian plains, where also there  are no four-footed enemies[11] and where his ancestors dwelt in peace  before the advent of man. And the same things are true of the Moas, the  AEpyornithes, the flightless birds of Patagonia, the recent dodo of  Mauritius and the solitaire of Rodriguez, each and all of which  flourished in places where there were no men and practically no other  enemies. Hence we deduce that absence of enemies is the prime factor in  the existence of flightless birds,[12] although presence of food is an  essential, while isolation, or restriction to a limited area, plays an  important part by keeping together those birds, or that race of birds,  whose members show a tendency to disuse their wings. It will be seen  that such combinations of circumstances will most naturally be found on  islands whose geological history is such that they have had no  connection with adjacent continents, or such a very ancient connection  that they were not then peopled with beasts of prey, while subsequently  their distance from other countries has prevented them from receiving  such population by accident in recent times and has also retarded the  arrival of man.    [11] _The dingo, or native dog, is not forgotten, but, like man, it is a  comparatively recent animal._    [12] _Note that in Tasmania, which is very near Australia, both in space  and in the character of its animals, there are two carnivorous mammals,  the Tasmanian \"Wolf\" and the Tasmanian Devil, and no flightless birds._    Once established, flightlessness and size play into one another's hands;  the flightless bird has no limit placed on its size[13] while granted a  food supply and immunity from man; the larger the bird the less the  necessity for wings to escape from four-footed foes. So long as the  climate was favorable and man absent, the big, clumsy bird might thrive,  but upon the coming of man, or in the face of any unfavorable change of  climate, he would be at a serious disadvantage and hence whenever either  of these two factors has been brought to bear against them the feathered  giants have vanished.    [13] _While we do not know the limit of size to a flying creature, none  has as yet been found whose wings would spread over twenty feet from tip  to tip, and it is evident that wings larger than this would demand great  strength for their manipulation._      _REFERENCES_    _There is a fine collection of mounted skeletons of various species of  Moas in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, Mass., and  another in the American Museum of Natural History, New York. A few  _other skeletons and numerous bones are to be found in other  institutions, but the author is not aware of any egg being in this  country. Specimens of the AEpyornis are rare in this country, but Mr.  Robert Gilfort, of Orange, N.J., is the possessor of a very fine egg. A  number of eggs have been sold in London, the prices ranging from L200  down to L42, this last being much less than prices paid for eggs of the  great auk. But then, the great auk is somewhat of a fad, and there are  just enough eggs in existence to bring one into the market every little  while. Besides, the number of eggs of the great auk is a fixed quantity,  while no one knows how many more of AEpyornis remain to be discovered in  the swamps of Madagascar. No specimens of the gigantic Patagonian birds  are now in this country, but a fine example of one of the smaller forms,  Pelycornis, including the only breast-bone yet found, is in the Museum  of Princeton University._    _The largest known tibia of a Moa, the longest bird-bone known, is in  the collection of the Canterbury Museum, Christchurch, New Zealand; it  is 3 feet 3 inches long. This, however, is exceptional, the measurements  of the leg-bones of an ordinary Dinornis maximus being as follows:  Femur, 18 inches; tibia, 32 inches; tarsus, 19 inches, a total of 5 feet  9 inches. The egg measures 10-1/2 by 6-1/2 inches._    _There is plenty of literature, and very interesting literature,  about the Moas, but, unfortunately, the best of it is not always  accessible, being contained in the \"New Zealand Journal of Science\" and  the \"Transactions of the New Zealand Institute.\" The volume of  \"Transactions\" for 1893, being vol. xxvi., contains a very full list of  articles relating to the Moas, compiled by Mr. A. Hamilton; it will be  found to commence on page 229. There is a good article on Moa in  Newton's \"Dictionary of Birds,\" a book that should be in every library._    [Illustration: Fig. 32.--The Three Giants, Phororhacos, Moa, Ostrich.]          IX    THE ANCESTRY OF THE HORSE        \"_Said the little Eohippus        I am going to be a horse      And on my middle finger-nails        To run my earthly course._\"      The American whose ancestors came over in the \"Mayflower\" has a proper  pride in the length of the line of his descent. The Englishman whose  genealogical tree sprang up at the time of William the Conqueror has, in  its eight centuries of growth, still larger occasion for pluming himself  on the antiquity of his family. But the pedigree of even the latter is a  thing of yesterday when compared with that of the horse, whose family  records, according to Professor Osborn, reach backward for something  like 2,000,000 years. And if, as we have been told, \"it is a good thing  to have ancestors, but sometimes a little hard on the ancestor,\" in  this instance at least the founders of the family have every reason to  regard their descendants with undisguised pride. For the horse family  started in life in a small way, and the first of the line, the  Hyracotherium, was \"a little animal no bigger than a fox, and on  five[14] toes he scampered over Tertiary rocks,\" in the age called  Eocene, because it was the morning of life for the great group of  mammals whose culminating point was man. At that time, western North  America was a country of many lakes, for the most part comparatively  shallow, around the reedy margins of which moved a host of animals,  quite unlike those of to-day, and yet foreshadowing them, the  forerunners of the rhinoceros, tapir, and the horse.    [14] _Four, to be exact; but we prefer to sacrifice the foot of the  Hyracothere rather than to take liberties with one of the feet of Mrs.  Stetson's poem._    The early horse--we may call him so by courtesy, although he was then  very far from being a true horse--was an insignificant little creature,  apparently far less likely to succeed in life's race than his bulky  competitors, and yet, by making the most of their opportunities, his  descendants have survived, while most of theirs have dropped by the  wayside; and finally, by the aid of man, the horse has become spread  over the length and breadth of the habitable globe.    [Illustration: Fig. 33.--Skeleton of the Modern Horse and of His Eocene  Ancestor.]    Now right here it may be asked, How do we know that the little  Hyracothere _was_ the progenitor of the horse, and how can it be shown  that there is any bond of kinship between him and, for example, the  great French Percheron? There is only one way in which we can obtain  this knowledge, and but one method by which the relationship can be  shown, and that is by collecting the fossil remains of animals long  extinct and comparing them with the bones of the recent horse, a branch  of science known as Palaeontology. It has taken a very long time to  gather the necessary evidence, and it has taken a vast amount of hard  work in our western Territories, for \"the country that is as hot as  Hades, watered by stagnant alkali pools, is almost invariably the  richest in fossils.\" Likewise it has called for the expenditure of much  time and more patience to put together some of this petrified evidence,  fragmentary in every sense of the word, and"]]]
