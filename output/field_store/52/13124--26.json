An exception to this  was Dean Wren of Windsor (father of the famous architect). He could  not speak strongly enough against it in his marginal notes on Browne's  _Pseudodoxia Epidemica_. As Dr. Johnson wrote,[359] Sir Thomas Browne  (1605-1682) himself in his zeal for the old errors, did not easily  admit new positions, for he never mentioned the motion of the earth  but with contempt and ridicule. This was not enough for the Dean, who  wrote in the margin of Browne's book, at such a passage,[360] that  there were \"eighty-odd expresse places in the Bible affirming in  plaine and overt terms the naturall and perpetuall motion of sun and  moon\" and that \"a man should be affrighted to follow that audacious  and pernicious suggestion which Satan used, and thereby undid us all  in our first parents, that God hath a double meaning in his commands,  in effect condemning God of amphibologye. And all this boldness and  overweaning having no other ground but a seeming argument of some  phenomena forsooth, which notwithstanding we know the learned Tycho,  prince of astronomers, who lived fifty-two years since Copernicus,  hath by admirable and matchlesse instruments and many yeares exact  observations proved to bee noe better than a dreame.\"    [Footnote 357: Berry quotes (p. 92) a passage from Thomas Digges (d.  1595) with the date 1590: \"But in this our age, one rare witte (seeing  the continuall errors that from time to time more and more continually  have been discovered, besides the infinite absurdities in their  Theoricks, which they have been forced to admit that would not confess  any mobility in the ball of the Earth) hath by long studye, paynfull  practise, and rare invention delivered a new Theorick or Model of the  World, shewing that the Earth resteth not in the Center of the whole  world or globe of elements, which encircled or enclosed in the Moone's  orbit, and together with the whole globe of mortality is carried round  about the Sunne, which like a king in the middst of all, rayneth and  giveth laws of motion to all the rest, sphaerically dispersing his  glorious beames of light through all this sacred celestiall Temple.\"  Browne also refers to Digges (I, 383).]    [Footnote 358: Gilbert: _De Magnete_, Bk. VI, c. 3-5 (214-228).]    [Footnote 359: Johnson: _Life_, in Browne: I, xvii.]    [Footnote 360: Browne: I, 35.]    Richard [Transcriber's Note: Robert] Burton (1576-1639) in  _The Anatomy of Melancholy_ speaks of the doctrine as a \"prodigious  tenent, or paradox,\" lately revived by \"Copernicus, Brunus and some  others,\" and calls Copernicus in consequence the successor of  Atlas.[361] The vast extent of the heavens that this supposition  requires, he considers \"quite opposite to reason, to natural  philosophy, and all out as absurd as disproportional, (so some will)  as prodigious, as that of the sun's swift motion of the heavens.\" If  the earth is a planet, then other planets may be inhabited (as  Christian Huygens argued later on); and this involves a possible  plurality of worlds. Burton laughs at those who, to avoid the Church  attitude and yet explain the celestial phenomena, invent new  hypotheses and new systems of the world, \"correcting others, doing  worse themselves, reforming some and marring all,\" as he says of  Roeslin's endeavors. \"In the meantime the world is tossed in a blanket  amongst them; they hoyse the earth up and down like a ball, make it  stand and goe at their pleasure.\"[362] He himself was indifferent.    [Footnote 361: Burton: _Anatomy of Melancholy_, I, 1; I, 66. First  edition, 1621; reprinted 1624, 1628, 1632, 1638, 1651-2, 1660, 1676.]    [Footnote 362: Ibid: I, 385, 389.]    Others more sensitive to the implications of this system, might  exclaim with George Herbert (1593-1633):[363]        \"Although there were some fourtie heav'ns, or more,        Sometimes I peere above them all;      Sometimes I hardly reach a score,        Sometimes to hell I fall.        \"O rack me not to such a vast extent,        Those distances belong to thee.      The world's too little for thy tent,        A grave too big for me.\"    [Footnote 363: Herbert: II, 315.]    Or they might waver, undecided, like Milton who had the archangel  answer Adam's questions thus:[364]        \"But whether thus these things, or whether not,      Whether the Sun predominant in Heaven      Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun,      Hee from the East his flaming robe begin,      Or Shee from West her silent course advance      With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps      On her soft axle, while she paces ev'n      And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along,      Solicit not thy thoughts with matters hid,      Leave them to God above, him serve and feare;      Of other Creatures, as him pleases best,      Wherever plac't, let him dispose; joy thou      In what he gives to thee, this Paradise      And the fair Eve: Heaven is for thee too high      To know what passes there: be lowlie wise.\" (1667)    [Footnote 364: Milton: _Paradise Lost_, Bk. VIII, lines 159 _et seq._    The great Puritan divine, John Owen (1616-1683), accepts the miracle  of the sun's standing still without a word of reference to the new  astronomy. (_Works_: II, 160.) Farrar states that Owen declared  Newton's discoveries were against the evident testimonies of Scripture  (Farrar: _History of Interpretation_: xviii.), but I have been unable  to verify this statement. Owen died before the _Principia_ was  published in 1687.]    Whewell thinks[365] that at this time the diffusion of the Copernican  system was due more to the writings of Bishop Wilkins than to those of  any one else, for their very extravagances drew stronger attention to  it. The first, \"The Discovery of a New World: or a Discourse tending  to prove that there may be another habitable world in the moon,\"  appeared in 1638; and a third edition was issued only two years later  together with the second book; \"Discourse concerning a New  Planet--that 'tis probable our Earth is one of the planets.\" In this  latter, the Bishop stated certain propositions as indubitable; among  these were, that the scriptural passages intimating diurnal motion of  the sun or of the heavens are fairly capable of another  interpretation; that there is no sufficient reason to prove the earth  incapable of those motions which Copernicus ascribes to it; that it is  more probable the earth does move than the heavens, and that this  hypothesis is exactly agreeable to common appearances.[366] And these  books appeared when political and constitutional matters, and not  astronomical ones, were the burning questions of the day in England.    [Footnote 365: Whewell: I, 410.]    [Footnote 366: Wilkins: _Discourse Concerning a New Planet_.]    The spread of the doctrine was also helped by Thomas Salusbury's  translations of the books and passages condemned by the Index in 1616  and 1619. This collection, \"intended for gentlemen,\" he published by  popular subscription immediately after the Restoration,[367] a fact  that indicates that not merely mathematicians (whom Whewell  claims[368] were by that time all decided Copernicans) but the general  public were interested and awake.[369]    [Footnote 367: Salusbury: _Math. Coll._: To the Reader.]    [Footnote 368: Whewell: I, 411.]    [Footnote 369: One London bookseller in 1670 advertised for sale  \"spheres according to the Ptolmean, Tychonean and Copernican systems  with books for their use.\" (Moxon: 272.) In 1683 in London appeared  the third edition of Gassendi's _Institutio_, the textbook of  astronomy in the universities during this period of uncertainty. It  too wavers between the Tychonic and the Copernican systems.]    The appearance of Newton's _Principia_ in 1687 with his statement of  the universal application of the law of gravitation, soon ended  hesitancy for most people. Twelve years later, John Keill,  (1671-1721), the Scotch mathematician and astronomer at Oxford,  refuted Descartes's theory of vortices and opened the first course of  lectures delivered at Oxford on the new Newtonian philosophy.[370] Not  only were his lectures thronged, but his books advocating the  Copernican system in full[371] went through several editions in  relatively few years.    [Footnote 370: _Dict. of Nat. Biog._: \"Keill.\"]    [Footnote 371: Keill: _Introductio ad Veram Astronomiam_.]    In the Colonies, Yale University which had hitherto been using  Gassendi's textbook, adopted the Newtonian ideas a few years later,  partly through the gift to the university of some books by Sir Isaac  himself, and partly through the enthusiasm of two young instructors  there, Johnson and Brown, who in 1714-1722 widened the mathematical  course by including the new theories.[372] The text they used was by  Rohault, a Cartesian, edited by Samuel Clarke with critical notes  exposing the fallacies of Cartesianism. This \"disguised Newtonian  treatise\" was used at Yale till 1744. The University of Pennsylvania  used this same text book even later.[373]    [Footnote 372: Cajori: 29-30.]    [Footnote 373: Cajori: 37.]    In 1710 Pope (1688-1744) refers to \"our Copernican system,\"[374] and  Addison (1671-1719) in the _Spectator_ (July 2, 1711) writes this very  modern passage:         \"But among this set of writers, there are none who more       gratify and enlarge the imagination, than the authors of the       new philosophy, whether we consider their theories of the       earth or heavens, the discoveries they have made by glasses,       or any other of their contemplations on nature....

Madame Bonaparte rode in the carriage with her husband; General Moncey,  Inspector-general of the Constabulary, on horseback on the right; in the  second carriage was General Soult and his aides-de-camp; in the third  carriage, General Bessieres and M. de Lugay; in the fourth, General  Lauriston; then came the carriages of the personal attendants, Hambard,  Hebert, and I being in the first.    It is impossible to give an idea of the enthusiasm of the inhabitants of  Rouen on the arrival of the First Consul. The market-porters and the  boatmen in grand costume awaited us outside the city; and when the  carriage which held the two august personages was in sight, these brave  men placed themselves in line, two and two, and preceded thus the  carriage to the hotel of the prefecture, where the First Consul alighted.  The prefect and the mayor of Rouen, the archbishop, and the general  commanding the division dined with the First Consul, who showed a most  agreeable animation during the repast, and with much solicitude asked  information as to the condition of manufactures, new discoveries in the  art of manufacturing, in fact, as to everything relating to the  prosperity of this city, which was essentially industrial.    In the evening, and almost the whole night, an immense crowd surrounded  the hotel, and filled the gardens of the prefecture, which were  illuminated and ornamented with allegorical transparencies in praise of  the First Consul; and each time he showed himself on the terrace of the  garden the air resounded with applause and acclamations which seemed most  gratifying to him.    The next morning, after having made on horseback the tour of the city,  and visited the grand sites by which it is surrounded, the First Consul  heard mass, which was celebrated at eleven o'clock by the archbishop in,  the chapel of the prefecture. An hour after he had to receive the  general council of the department, the council of the prefecture, the  municipal council, the clergy of Rouen, and the courts of justice, and  was obliged to listen to a half-dozen discourses, all expressed in nearly  the same terms, and to which he replied in such a manner as to give the  orators the highest opinion of their own merit. All these bodies, on  leaving the First Consul, were presented to Madame Bonaparte, who  received them with her accustomed grace, in, the evening Madame Bonaparte  held a reception for the wives of the officials, at which the First  Consul was present, of which fact some availed themselves to present to  him several emigres, who had recently returned under the act of amnesty,  and whom he received graciously.    After which followed crowds, illuminations, acclamations, all similar to  those of the evening before. Every one wore an air of rejoicing which  delighted me, and contrasted strangely, I thought, with the dreadful  wooden houses, narrow, filthy streets, and Gothic buildings which then  distinguished the town of Rouen.    Monday, Nov. 1, at seven o'clock in the morning, the First Consul mounted  his horse, and, escorted by a detachment of the young men of the city,  forming a volunteer guard, passed the bridge of boats, and reached the  Faubourg Saint-Sever. On his return from this excursion, we found the  populace awaiting him at the head of the bridge, whence they escorted him  to the hotel of the prefecture, manifesting the liveliest joy.    After breakfast, there was a high mass by the archbishop, the occasion  being the fete of All Saints; then came the learned societies, the chiefs  of administration, and justices of the peace, with their speeches, one of  which contained a remarkable sentence, in which these good magistrates,  in their enthusiasm, asked the First Consul's permission to surname him  the great justice of the peace of Europe. As they left the Consul's  apartment I noticed their spokesman; he had tears in his eyes, and was  repeating with pride the reply he had just received.    I regret that I do not remember his name, but I was told that he was one  of the most highly esteemed men in Rouen. His countenance inspired  confidence, and bore an expression of frankness, which prepossessed me in  his favor.    In the evening the First Consul went to the theater, which was packed to  the ceiling, and offered a charming sight. The municipal authorities had  a delightful fete prepared, which the First Consul found much to his  taste, and upon which he complimented the prefect and the mayor on  several different occasions. After witnessing the opening of the ball,  he made two or three turns in the hall, and retired, escorted by the  staff of the National Guard.    On Tuesday much of the day was spent by the First Consul in visiting the  workshops of the numerous factories of the city, accompanied by the  minister of the interior, the prefect, the mayor, the general commanding  the division, the inspector-general of police, and the staff of the  Consular Guard. In a factory of the Faubourg Saint-Sever, the minister  of the interior presented to him the dean of the workmen, noted as having  woven the first piece of velvet in France; and the First Consul, after  complimenting this honorable old man, granted him a pension. Other  rewards and encouragements were likewise distributed to several parties  whose useful inventions commended them to public gratitude.    Wednesday morning early we left for Elbeuf, where we arrived at ten  o'clock, preceded by threescore young men of the most distinguished  families of the city, who, following the example of those of Rouen,  aspired to the honor of forming the guard of the First Consul.    The country around us was covered with an innumerable multitude, gathered  from all the surrounding communes. The First Consul alighted at Elbeuf,  at the house of the mayor, where he took breakfast, and then visited the  town in detail, obtaining information everywhere; and knowing that one of  the first wishes of the citizens was the construction of a road from  Elbeuf to a small neighboring town called Romilly, he gave orders to the  minister of the interior to begin work upon it immediately.    At Elbeuf, as at Rouen, the First Consul was overwhelmed with homage and  benedictions; and we returned from this last town at four o'clock in the  afternoon.    The merchants of Rouen had prepared a fete in the hall of the Stock  Exchange, which the First Consul and his family attended after dinner.  He remained a long time on the ground floor of this building, where there  were displayed magnificent specimens from the industries of this  Department. He examined everything, and made Madame Bonaparte do the  same; and she also purchased several pieces of cloth.    The First Consul then ascended to the first floor, where, in the grand  saloon, were gathered about a hundred ladies, married and single, and  almost all pretty, the wives and daughters of the principal merchants of  Rouen, who were waiting to compliment him. He seated himself in this  charming circle, and remained there perhaps a quarter of an hour; then  passed into another room, where awaited him the representation of a  little proverb, containing couplets expressing, as may be imagined, the  attachment and gratitude of the inhabitants of Rouen. This play was  followed by a ball.    Thursday evening the First Consul announced that he would leave for Havre  the next morning at daybreak; and exactly at five o'clock I was awakened  by Hebert, who said that at six o'clock we would set out. I awoke  feeling badly, was sick the whole day, and would have given much to have  slept a few hours longer; but we were compelled to begin our journey.  Before entering his carriage, the First Consul made a present to  Monseigneur, the archbishop, of a snuff-box with his portrait, and also  gave one to the mayor, on which was the inscription, 'Peuple Francais'.    We stopped at Caudebec for breakfast. The mayor of this town presented  to the First Consul a corporal who had made the campaign of Italy (his  name was, I think, Roussel), and who had received a sword of honor as a  reward for his brave conduct at Marengo. He was at Caudebec on a  half-year's furlough, and asked the First Consul's permission to be a  sentinel at the door of the apartment of the august travelers, which was  granted; and after the First Consul and Madame Bonaparte were seated at  the table, Roussel was sent for, and invited to breakfast with his  former general. At Havre and at Dieppe the First Consul invited thus to  his table all the soldiers or sailors who had received guns, sabers, or  boarding-axes of honor. The First Consul stopped an hour at Bolbec,  showing much attention and interest in examining the products of the  industries of the district, complimenting the guards of honor who passed  before him on their fine appearance, thanking the clergy for the prayers  in his behalf which they addressed to Heaven, and leaving for the poor,  either in their own hands, or in the hands of the mayor, souvenirs of  his stay. On the arrival of the First Consul at Havre, the city was  illuminated; and the First Consul and his numerous cortege passed  between two rows of illuminations and columns of fire of all kinds. The  vessels in the port appeared like a forest on fire; being covered with  colored lamps to the very top of their masts. The First Consul  received, the day of his arrival at Havre, only a part of the  authorities of the city, and soon after retired, saying that he was  fatigued; but at six o'clock in the morning of the next day he was on  horseback, and until two o'clock he rode along the seacoast and low  hills of Ingouville for more than a league, and the banks of the Seine  as far as the cliffs of Hoc. He also made a tour outside of the  citadel. About three o'clock the First Consul began to receive the  authorities. He conversed with them in great detail upon the work that  had, been done at this "]]]
