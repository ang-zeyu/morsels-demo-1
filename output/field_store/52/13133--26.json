Finally, if the animal is lying  down, he expires in slow agony, his head borne down by its own weight;  or, if standing, he sinks and falls down, his death having anticipated  the fall.    Such are the symptoms--the subjective signs which enable us to detect  the contagious typhus of the ox. But all animals do not exhibit these  disorders of the vital functions with the same regularity and excess.  Some of these we have seen, from first to last, sustain the internal  effects of the morbid process--in some sort passively--without revealing  any deep derangements in the nervous, respiratory, and digestive  functions. The poisonous virus had smitten them; they suffered in their  general structure; they looked stupefied; they lost, at a given moment,  their appetite and rumination; they had fever; their breathing had  become short and frequent; they had diarrhoea; they gradually lost  flesh, and the excreta passed through certain changes and  transformations. In a word, the animal had manifestly the bovine typhus;  but, thanks to a relative immunity, to a special organization, which  renders some of these beasts capable of resisting the contagion for a  long period, and sometimes altogether[O]--thanks to that variety which  we observe in different constitutions (for small-pox and typhus in man,  and the true typhoid fever in animals, do not operate with the same  violence on all alike)--thanks to this privileged organization,--we have  seen some oxen pass through every stage of the disease without  exhibiting this terrible train of morbid phenomena.    In these cases--for even this mild form of the distemper at last  produces death--the injuries fix themselves more exclusively on the  digestive channels, and we witness, in dissection, ulcerations in some,  in others mere spots of a livid red, more or less extensive.    Finally, although the typhus be one of the gravest maladies which  destroy and decimate cattle, all sick animals are not mortally affected  thereby. In the present epizootia, five per cent., as nearly as can be  ascertained, recover; and when that happens, signs of a favourable omen  are observable during the course of the attack. In these favourable  instances, indeed, the symptoms, even though they exhibit a certain  gravity, pursue a regular course; fever does not become remittent; the  faecal discharge is copious and easy, with less foetor; the animal  loses flesh slowly and progressively; the tumours are cutaneous,  inflammatory; their character is good, depurative, and rather purulent  than gaseous and crackling. The droppings do not show that high degree  of pestilential decomposition described above; the animal in his drink  welcomes and digests a mixture of bran and flour; the secretions of  purulent mucus and the faecal discharges dry up and stop in the early  part of the period of decline; the epidermis of the openings through  which they passed out peels off in thin scales, and afterwards in scurfs  or husks--in a word, the economy does not experience those acute  disturbances which strike one of the tripods of life--that is to say,  either the nervous centres, the lungs, or the digestive organs.    Now, in these curable cases, in which the cure is most generally due to  nature's own efforts, but which a systematic treatment might render far  more frequent, the convalescence is long, and requires great attention  and a well-regulated diet, in which the food is carefully measured and  divided. Here there must be a rigid superintendence. A laxity in the  watchfulness, or too much reliance on the reviving health, have produced  sudden relapses, and been fatal to many sick cattle, which had been  looked upon as thoroughly cured. For it may well be conceived that  convalescent animals, after sustaining such violent derangements in  their health, and having been brought down to the lowest degree of  prostration and marasmus--to a reconstitution, we may call it, of the  solids and liquids--have a devouring hunger. If, therefore, the keeper  who looks after them unhappily forgets that the principal lesions or  sores are seated in the stomach and intestines, and if he gives them too  much solid nutriment, he impedes the cure, irritates the ulcerations not  yet thoroughly covered over, and soon adds another victim to those which  had already died.    This convalescence lasts from fifteen to twenty days, and the animal  only recovers its health at last by slow degrees. Still the careful  keeper need not be afraid of a relapse when he is patient and watchful.    Such, then, is the contagious typhus of the ox. Type of the unreturnable  infectious diseases, its virulent miasms undergo within the structure a  series of transformations: they produce in the frame a general disorder  fully capable of annihilating the predisposition or aptitude of the  animal to receive the taint. A disease essentially specific, it affects  the principal centres of life; it kills its victim both by its deadly  virus and by the local derangements to which it gives rise; for how is  it possible to preserve life when the whole nervous system, that  promoter and regulator of all the functions, is upset?--when the lungs  which revivify the blood, when the digestive organs which are the very  sources of alimentation, are smitten with stagnation?--when, in fine,  not only these vital centres have ceased to operate, but when each by  itself is the cause of torturing pains and exhaustion?    The typhus, moreover, is observed in all animals of the bovine species,  whatever may be their race, their age, or their sex. The recovered  animals may live with impunity amidst diseased herds of cattle, thanks  to its non-relapsive nature. Jessen has even witnessed cows which, after  their own cure, communicated a sort of immunity to their offspring. For  the same reason it is that epizootias are less fatal in those countries  where they often occur, the constitutions of those animals which are  engendered amongst such habituated herds, preserving a prophylaxy  inherent to the blood which has been transmitted to them.    Besides, what a pregnant subject is this for the physician, and what  more meritorious task can he set himself than the treatment of such a  distemper, which reason assures him must eventually lead to the cure and  eradication of the same complaint in the human species?    From a cause which as yet has been indistinguishable and imponderable,  what important, what marvellous results loom in the future! The air  seems to us pure and wholesome, yet it conceals a typhic miasma of the  most deadly kind; it carries this pernicious principle into the richest  meadows, where we see feeding flocks and herds which to us seem  exuberant with health. Then this miasma is inhaled and absorbed, and it  meets in the frame the special and indispensable organic element which  is needed for its multiplication; there it undergoes certain latent  transformations, and a fermentation, a germination, which we call  _incubation_, in order to explain a process which we cannot understand.  Then fever is kindled, all the functions are disturbed, and the sick  animal is struck down, leaving us wondering, ignorant, and powerless  spectators in the presence of phenomena which, nevertheless, are the  eternal work of nature and have endured through all time.--But if in  the invisible typhic atom nature gives us death, it also gives us life  in the zoosperma.      II.    _Lesions found in the Bodies of Oxen after Death._    The description which we have given of the disorders produced in the  different functions by the operation of the typhus, may easily suggest  what must be the lesions exhibited by the organs of the body.    Death, we have said already, may overtake the disease at any of its  periods, and thus show every aspect and every degree of the organic  lesions. Such an animal being struck down at the period of initiation,  will not, of course, present the changes and varieties of the period of  decline, and _vice versa_.    In general, the state of the dead bodies is that of the most decided  marasmus; the remains are intensely repulsive, as well by the stench  they emit as by the sight they afford; and, in summer especially,  decomposition sets in with great rapidity. Consequently, the utmost care  is required in conveying them from place to place; and this attention  is the more essential, because in the transit, the cavities being  deprived of their contractile power, let flow the pestilential liquids  which they contain, thereby infecting the carriages and public roads.  The urgent necessity there is to inhume at once these dead bodies, the  most active agents in diffusing the contagion, is equally the drift of  this observation.    The deceased animal, as a subject of anatomy, enables us to certify the  seat of the emphysematous tumours, and to see that they are really due  to the air which insinuates itself into the cellular tissue, and which,  receding from the pressure of the fingers between the cells, produced  the crackling sound we noticed above. This penetration of the air is,  moreover, a far more general effect than was supposed.    It is ascertained, likewise, from the examination of these subjects,  that the round, fluctuating, and smaller tumours, are indeed purulent  gatherings, which occasionally find a passage into the layers and  interstices of the muscles.    The muscular flesh is usually flabby, bloodless, unsightly, of a very  nauseous smell; and it would be difficult to imagine that the most  avaricious trickster would dare to offer even the most presentable parts  of it for sale and consumption. But when the expedients and artifices  known to the butcher's trade are had resort to, when, regardless of the  public health, the unprincipled dealer selects the most fleshy parts,  when he dresses and adorns them by colouring them over with the blood of  a healthy beast, the unwary eye of the purchaser may be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36504"],[0,"Freshwater Sponges, Hydroids & Polyzoa (#19)"],[1,"commonest species in most parts of both  continents. It has also been found in Northern Asia and may occur in the  Himalayan lakes and in the north-west of India.      1 _a._ Subspecies reticulata*, _Annandale_.         _Spongilla reticulata_, Annandale, Rec. Ind. Mus. i, p. 387,       pl. xiv, fig. 1 (1907).         _Spongilla lacustris_ subspecies _reticulata_, _id._, P.       U.S. Mus. xxxvii, p. 401 (1909).    This race differs from the typical _S. lacustris_ in the following  particulars:--         (1) The branches are always compressed and anastomose       freely when well developed (fig. 5, p. 37);         (2) the skeleton-fibres are finer;         (3) the skeleton-spicules are longer;         (4) the gemmule-spicules are longer and more slender and are       never strongly bent.    [Illustration: Fig. 8.    A=gemmule-spicules of _Spongilla lacustris_ subsp. _reticulata_ (from  type); B=gemmule-spicules of _S. alba_ from Calcutta: both highly  magnified.]    As regards the form of the skeleton- and gemmule-spicules and also that  of the branches the subspecies _reticulata_ resembles _S. alba_ rather  than _S. lacustris_, but owing to the fact that it agrees with _S.  lacustris_ in its profuse production of branches, in possessing green  corpuscles and in its fragility, I think it should be associated with  that species.    The branches are sometimes broad (fig. 5, p. 37), sometimes very  slender. In the latter condition they resemble blades of grass growing  in the water.    TYPE in the Indian Museum; a co-type in the British Museum.    GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.--All over Eastern India and Burma; also in  the Bombay Presidency. _Localities:_--BENGAL, Port Canning, Ganges  delta; Rajshahi (Rampur Bhulia) on the Ganges, 150 miles N. of Calcutta  (_Annandale_); Puri district, Orissa (_Annandale_); R. Jharai, Siripur,  Saran district, Tirhut (_M. Mackenzie_): MADRAS PRESIDENCY, Madras  (town) (_J. R. Henderson_): BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, Igatpuri, W. Ghats  (_Annandale_).    BIOLOGY.--This subspecies is usually found in small masses of water,  especially in pools of rain-water, but Mr. Mackenzie found it growing  luxuriantly in the Jharai at a time of flood in September. It is very  abundant in small pools among the sand-dunes that skirt the greater part  of the east coast of India. Here it grows with great rapidity during the  \"rains,\" and often becomes desiccated even more rapidly as soon as the  rain ceases. As early in the autumn as October I have seen masses of the  sponge attached, perfectly dry, to grass growing in the sand near the  Sur Lake in Orissa. They were, of course, dead but preserved a life-like  appearance. Some of them measured about six inches in diameter. At Port  Canning the sponge grows during the rains on the brickwork of bridges  over ditches of brackish water that dry up at the beginning of winter,  while at Rajshahi and at Igatpuri I found it at the edges of small  ponds, at the latter place in November, at the former in February.  Specimens taken at Madras by Dr. Henderson during the rains in small  ponds in the sand contained no gemmules, but these structures are very  numerous in sponges examined in autumn or winter.    Numerous larvae of _Sisyra indica_ (p. 92) were found in this sponge at  Rajshahi. Unlike those obtained from _S. alba_, they had a green colour  owing to the green matter sucked from the sponge in their stomachs. The  _coralloides_ phase of _Plumatella fruticosa_ (p. 219) was also found in  _S. lacustris_ subsp. _reticulata_ at Rajshahi.    So far as my experience goes, this subspecies has always a bright green  colour due to the presence of \"green corpuscles,\" even when it is  growing in a pond heavily shaded by trees or under the arch of a small  bridge. Probably the more intense light of India enables the corpuscles  to flourish in situations in which in Europe they would lose their  chlorophyll.      2.

Asiat. Soc. Bengal,       1907, p. 15, fig. 1.         _Spongilla proliferens_, _id._, Rec. Ind. Mus. i, pp. 267,       271 (1907).    _Sponge_ forming soft, shallow cushions rarely more than 10 cm. in  diameter on the leaves of water-plants, or small irregular masses on  their roots and stems. Colour bright green. Oscula moderate, flat,  surrounded by deep, cone-shaped collars; radiating furrows and canals in  the parenchyma surrounding them often deep. External pores contained  normally in single cells. The surface frequently covered by small  rounded buds; true branches if present more or less flattened or  conical, always short, as a rule absent.    _Skeleton_ loose, feebly reticulate at the base of the sponge;  transverse fibres slender in the upper part of the sponge, often  scarcely recognizable at its base. Very little spongin present.    _Spicules._ Skeleton-spicules long, smooth, sharply pointed; the length  on an average at least 20 times the greatest breadth, often more.  Flesh-spicules slender, gradually pointed, nearly straight, covered with  minute straight or nearly straight spines. Gemmule-spicules very  similar, but usually a little stouter and often blunt at the ends; their  spines rather longer than those on the flesh-spicules, usually more  numerous near the ends than in the middle of the spicule, slightly  retroverted, those at the extreme tips often so arranged as to suggest a  rudimentary rotule.    [Illustration: Fig. 9.--Gemmule of _Spongilla proliferens_ as seen in  optical section (from Calcutta), x 140.]    _Gemmules_ usually numerous, lying free near the base of the sponge,  very variable in size, spherical, surrounded by a thick granular layer  in which the spicules, which are always very numerous, are arranged  tangentially, their position being more near the vertical than the  horizontal; a few horizontal spicules usually present on the external  surface of the gemmule, which frequently has a ragged appearance owing  to some of the tangential spicules protruding further than others.  Foraminal tubule stout, cylindrical, usually somewhat contorted; its  orifice irregular in outline. Sometimes more than one foramen present.    _S. proliferens_ can be distinguished from all forms of _S. lacustris_  and _S. alba_ by the fact that its gemmules possess a foraminal tubule;  from _S. cinerea_ it can be distinguished by its colour and its smooth  skeleton-spicules, and from _S. travancorica_ by its free gemmules. I  have been enabled by the kindness of Prof. Max Weber to examine  specimens from Celebes and Java identified by him as _S. cinerea_,  Carter, and have no doubt that they belong to my species.    TYPE in the Indian Museum; a co-type in the British Museum.    GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.--All over Eastern India and Burma; also in  Cochin on the west coast; Ceylon; W. China; Java, Flores and Celebes.  _Localities_:--BENGAL, Calcutta and neighbourhood (_Annandale_);  Berhampore, Murshidabad district (_R. E. Lloyd_): ASSAM, Mangal-dai near  the Bhutan frontier (_S. W. Kemp_): MADRAS PRESIDENCY, Madras (town) and  neighbourhood (_J. R. Henderson_); Rambha, Ganjam district  (_Annandale_); Bangalore, Mysore (alt. _ca._ 3000 ft.) (_Annandale_);  Ernakulam and Trichur, Cochin (_G. Mathai_): BURMA, Rangoon  (_Annandale_, _J. Coggin Brown_); Prome, Upper Burma (_J. Coggin  Brown_); Kawkareik, Amherst district, Tenasserim (_Annandale_): CEYLON,  between Maradankawela and Galapita-Gala, North Central Province  (_Willey_). Mr. J. Coggin Brown has recently brought back specimens from  Yunnan.    BIOLOGY.--_S. proliferens_ is usually found in ponds which never dry up;  Prof. Max Weber found it in small streams in Malaysia. It is common in  India on the leaves of _Vallisneria_ and _Limnanthemum_, on the roots of  _Pistia stratiotes_ and on the stems of rushes and grass. So far as I  have been able to discover, the life of the individual sponge is short,  only lasting a few weeks.    Sexual reproduction occurs seldom or never, but reproduction by means of  buds and gemmules continues throughout the year. The former is a rare  method of reproduction in most Spongillidae but in this species occurs  normally and constantly, the buds being often very numerous on the  external surface. They arise a short distance below the surface as  thickenings in the strands of cells that accompany the radiating fibres  of the skeleton. As they grow they push their way up the fibres, forcing  the external membrane outwards. The membrane contracts gradually round  their bases, cuts off communication between them and the parent sponge  and finally sets them adrift. No hole remains when this takes place, for  the membrane closes up both round the base of the bud and over the  aperture whence it has emerged.    The newly liberated bud already possesses numerous minute pores, but as  yet no osculum; its shape exhibits considerable variation, but the end  that was farthest from the parent-sponge before liberation is always  more or less rounded, while the other end is flat. The size also varies  considerably. Some of the buds float, others sink. Those that float do  so either owing to their shape, which depends on the degree of  development they have reached before liberation, or to the fact that a  bubble of gas is produced in their interior. The latter phenomenon only  occurs when the sun is shining on the sponge at the moment they are set  free, and is due to the action of the chlorophyll of the green bodies so  abundant in certain of the parenchyma cells of this species. If the  liberation of the bud is delayed rather longer than usual, numbers of  flesh-spicules are produced towards the ends of the primary  skeleton-fibres and spread out in one plane so as to have a fan-like  outline; in such buds the form is more flattened and the distal end less  rounded than in"]]]
