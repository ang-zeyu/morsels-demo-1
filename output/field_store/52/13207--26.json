Those things belong to the tamasic foods--all foods, for  instance, of the nature of game, of venison, all food which is  showing signs of decay (all alcohol is a product of decay), are  to be avoided. Flesh foods come under the quality of activity.  All flesh foods are really stimulants. All forms in the animal  kingdom are built up to express animal desires and animal  activities. The yogi cannot afford to use these in a body meant  for the higher processes of thought. Vitality, yes, they will  give that; strength, which does not last, they will give that; a  sudden spurs of energy, yes, meat will give that; but those are  not the things which the yogi wants; so he puts aside all those  foods as not available for the work he desires, and chooses his  food out of the most highly vitalised products. All the foods  which tend to growth, those are the most highly vitalised, grain,  out of which the new plant will grow, is packed full of the most  nutritious substances; fruits; all those things which have growth  as their next stage in the life cycle, those are the rhythmic  foods, full of life, and building up a body sensitive and strong  at the same time.          Dwellers on the Threshold        Of these there are many kinds. First, elementals. They try to bar  the astral plane against man. And naturally so, because they are  concerned with the building up of the lower kingdoms, these  elementals of form, the Rupa Devas; and to them man is a really  hateful creature, because of his destructive properties. That is  why they dislike him so much. He spoils their work wherever he  goes, tramples down vegetable things, and kills animals, so that  the whole of that great kingdom of nature hates the name of man.  They band themselves together to stop the one who is just taking  his first conscious steps on the astral plane, and try to  frighten him, for they fear that he is bringing destructiveness  into the new world. They cannot do anything, if you do not mind  them. When that rush of elemental force comes against the man  entering on the astral plane, he must remain quiet, indifferent,  taking up the position: \"I am a higher product of evolution than  you are; you can do nothing to me. I am your friend, not your  enemy, Peace!\" If he be strong enough to take up that position,  the great wave of elemental force will roll aside and let him  through. The seemingly causeless fears which some feel at night  are largely due to this hostility. You are, at night, more  sensitive to the astral plane than during the day, and the  dislike of the beings on the plane for man is felt more strongly.  But when the elementals find you are not destructive, not an  embodiment of ruin, they become as friendly to you as they were  before hostile. That is the first form of the dweller on the  threshold. Here again the importance of pure and rhythmic food  comes in; because if you use meat and alcohol, you attract the  lower elementals of the plane, those that take pleasure in the  scent of blood and spirits, and they will inevitably prevent your  seeing and understanding things clearly. They will surge round  you, impress their thoughts upon you, force their impressions on  your astral body, so that you may have a kind of shell of  objectionable hangers-on to your aura, who will much obstruct you  in your efforts to see and hear correctly. That is the chief  reason why every one who is teaching Yoga on the right-hand path  absolutely forbids indulgence in meat and alcohol.    The second form of the dweller on the threshold is the thought  forms of our own past. Those forms, growing out of the evil of  lives that lie behind us, thought forms of wickedness of all  kinds, those face us when we first come into touch with the  astral plane, really belonging to us, but appearing as outside  forms, as objects; and they try to scare back their creator. You  can only conquer them by sternly repudiating them: \"You are no  longer mine; you belong to my past, and not to my present. I will  give you none of my life.\" Thus you will gradually exhaust and  finally annihilate them. This is perhaps one of the most painful  difficulties that one has to face in treading the astral plane in  consciousness for the first time. Of course, where a person has  in any way been mixed up with objectionable thought forms of the  stronger kind, such as those brought about by practicing black  magic, there this particular form of the dweller will be much  stronger and more dangerous, and often desperate is the struggle  between the neophyte and these dwellers from his past backed up  by the masters of the black side.    Now we come to one of the most terrible forms of the dwellers on  the threshold. Suppose a case in which a man during the past has  steadily identified himself with the lower part of his nature and  has gone against the higher, paralysing himself, using higher  powers for lower purposes, degrading his mind to be the mere  slave of his lower desires. A curious change takes place in him.  The life which belongs to the Ego in him is taken up by the  physical body, and assimilated with the lower lives of which the  body is composed. Instead of serving the purposes of the Spirit,  it is dragged away for tile purposes of the lower, and becomes  part of the animal life belonging to the lower bodies, so that  the Ego and his higher bodies are weakened, and the animal life  of the lower is strengthened. Now under those conditions, the Ego  will sometimes become so disgusted with his vehicles that when  death relieves him of the physical body he will cast the others  quite aside. And even sometimes during physical life he will  leave the desecrated temple. Now after death, in these cases, the  man generally reincarnates very quickly; for, having torn himself  away from his astral and mental bodies, he has no bodies with  which to live in the astral and mental worlds, and he must  quickly form new ones and come again to rebirth here. Under these  conditions the old astral and mental bodies are not disintegrated  when the new mental and astral bodies are formed and born into  the world, and the affinity between the old and new, both having  had the same owner, the same tenant, asserts itself, and the  highly vitalised old astral and mental bodies will attach  themselves to the new astral and mental bodies, and become the  most terrible form of the dweller on the threshold.    These are the various forms which the dweller may assume, and all  are spoken of in books dealing with these particular subjects,  though I do not know that you will find anywhere in a single book  a definite classification like the above. In addition to these  there are, of course, the direct attacks of the Dark Brothers,  taking up various forms and aspects, and the most common form  they will take is the form of some virtue which is a little bit  in excess in the yogi. The yogi is not attacked through his  vices, but through his virtues; for a virtue in excess becomes a  vice. It is the extremes which are ever the vices; the golden  mean is the virtue. And thus, virtues become tempters in the  difficult regions of the astral and mental worlds, and are  utilised by the Brothers of the Shadow in order to entrap the  unwary.    I am not here speaking of the four ordinary ordeals of the astral  plane: the ordeals by earth, water, fire and air. Those are mere  trifles, hardly worth considering when speaking of these more  serious difficulties. Of course, you have to learn that you are  entirely master of astral matter, that earth cannot crush you,  nor water drown you, etc. Those are, so to speak, very easy  lessons. Those who belong to a Masonic body will recognise these  ordeals as parts of the language they are familiar with in their  Masonic ritual.    There is one other danger also. You may injure yourself by  repercussion. If on the astral plane you are threatened with  danger which belongs to the physical, but are unwise enough to  think it can injure you, it will injure your physical body. You  may get a wound, or a bruise, and so on, out of astral  experiences. I once made a fool of myself in this way. I was in a  ship going down and, as I was busy there, I saw that the mast of  the ship was going to fall and, in a moment's forgetfulness,  thought: \"That mast will fall on me\" that momentary thought had  its result, for when I came back to the body in the morning, I  had a large physical bruise where the mast fell. That is a  frequent phenomenon until you have corrected the fault of the  mind, which thinks instinctively the things which it is  accustomed to think down here.    One protection you can make for yourself as you become more  sensitive. Be rigorously truthful in thought, in word, in deed.  Every thought, every desire, takes form in the higher world. If  you are careless of truth here, you are creating a whole host of  terrifying and deluding forms. Think truth, speak truth, live  truth, and then you shall be free from the illusions of the  astral world.          Preparation for Yoga        People say that I put the ideal of discipleship so very high that  nobody can hope to become a disciple. But I have not said that no  one can become a disciple who does not reproduce the description  that is given of the perfect disciple. One may. But we do it at  our own peril. A man may be thoroughly capable along one line,  but have a serious fault along another. The serious fault will  not prevent him from becoming a disciple, but he must suffer for  it. The initiate pays for his faults ten times the price he would  have had to pay for them as a man of the world. That is why I  have put the ideal so high. I have never said that a person must  come utterly up to the ideal before becoming a disciple, but I  have said that the risks of becoming a disciple without these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4294"],[0,"Tales of Aztlan; The Romance of a Hero of Our Late Spanish-American War, (#19)"],[1," had  been pointed out to him beforehand as though he really saw them,  carrying out this illusion to the extent of ridiculousness. It is said  that at a hunt-meet a courtier incurred his royal displeasure through  these incautious words: \"Sire, you shot this hare from a next to  impossible distance, condescend to feel how fat it is!\"    As the poor man failed to say \"See how fat,\" he fell promptly into  disfavor, which is equivalent to being blacklisted in our country.    The king's general behaviour suggests that he deemed his blindness not  merely to be a most regrettable misfortune, but that he regarded it as  a deserved culpable affliction.    When a small boy I was told that he lost his eyesight through an act of  charity. He drew a purse from his pocket, intending to give a beggar an  aim when his horse shied violently, causing the steel-beaded tassels of  the purse to injure his eyes.    Later, as I grew older, I heard a different tale:    The king as a student, then being crown-prince of the realm, found  pleasure in looking at the wine which was red, and at a pair of eyes  that were blue and shone like heavenly stars, oh so gently and  tenderly! But he looked, alas, once too often--into eyes that blazed  with lurid flames of hate and fury--the terrible eyes of the green-eyed  monster. There came a flash as of lightning with a loud report and he  saw stars that fell fiercely fast until they vanished under a cloud of  awful gloom in the hopeless despair of perpetual night; but the  glorious luminous star of day for him shone not again, nevermore, on  earth! To this day I know not which version tells the truth.    The castle's grand hall was overflowing with people. I followed in the  wake of father, who had fallen into line, advancing gradually toward  the august presence of a crowned king. Nervously father awaited his  turn to bask for one anxious moment in the sunshine of royal favor and  touch a king's hand.    I slipped away unperceived to the kitchen, knowing well the premises of  this fine old castle which was kept in good repair by the city of  Hamburg, its present owner. It had been won by conquest of arms in 1394  A.D. from the noble family \"Von Lappe.\"    The principal occupation of these knights was the waylaying and robbing  of merchants; but the wrecking of ships was their favorite, most  profitable pastime.    The kitchen was in the basement of the castle and great in size, its  floor paved with slabs of stone, the walls and ceilings were paneled in  oak. On one side of the room were stone-hearths with blazing fires,  over which hung pots and brazen kettles. Game and meats broiled on  spits, there being no cook-stoves in those days. Heavy doors, strapped  with great wrought iron hinges and studded with ornamental scroll-work  led into pantries and cellars.    The place swarmed with liveried servants and cooks; also the king had  brought his \"chef de cuisine and own butler. The latter, a lordly  Englishman, was a grand, haughty person who superintended the  extravagant preparations for the entertainment of royalty.    A maid conducted me to a corner where I was out of harm's way and  regaled me with delicacies when the courses were served, oh it was  fine! The chef prepared certain dishes for the king and I saw the  butler taste of the viands that were placed on crown-marked dishes of  porcelain and gold. He also tasted the king's wine.    When at last I grew sleepy, kind maids arranged a couch of snowy linen  for me, and I slept until the banquet royal was over when the guests  returned to their homes.    But me lord, the butler, eyed me with questioning curiosity.    \"Aw me lad, h'and where did your father get 'is blooming costume?\" he  asked.    \"Mother supplied it, good sir,\" I answered.    \"Hi say, me lad,\" he laughed, \"your mother h'is a grand lydie, you tike  me word for h'it; h'in h'England they would decorate that suit with the  h'order h'of the garter!\"    \"Honi soit, qui mal y pense!\" I lisped.          A MAID OF YAVAPAI.    To S. M. H.    (AN IDYLLIC SKETCH.)      People from every land sojourn in Arizona.    From the Atlantic's sandy coasts, the icy shores of crystal lakes, from  turbid miasmatic swamps--east, north and south, they come.    Over mountain, canyon and gulch they roam, prospecting nature's  grandest wonders.    But the purest gold on Arizona's literary field, that was found by the  genius of a lonesome valley's queen, the song-lark of our \"Great  Southwest.\"    From the sheltering tree of her ancestral hall shyly she fluttered  forth.    Among stony crags of the sierra, on fearsome dizzy trails, in the  somber shadows of virgin forests, in the rustling of wind-blown leaves  (the seductive swish of elfin skirts) she heard the voices of Juno's  sylvan train. Enchanted she listened to the syren's call, and ere the  echo died within her ear she had devoted her talent to literature, a  priestess self-ordained in Arizona's temple of the muses.    In the flight of her poetic mind she met his majesty, king of the  hills, the mountain-lion at the threshold of his lair and toyed with  his cubs, princes and heirs to freedom.    She heard the were-wolf scourge of herds, fierce lobos snarl in silent  groves of timber and shivered at the coyote's piercing yelps from grave  yards in the valleys.    At nighttime, in her lonely camp the dread tarantela disturbed her rest  and in day's early gloam a warning rattle of creepy serpents sounded  her reveille:    \"Fair maid, awake, arise in haste! When darkness vanishes with dawn,  heed our alarm-clock in the morn!\"    She spoke not to the sullen bear, in cautious silence passed him by and  shunned the fetid breath of monster lizards and venom stings of  centipedes and scorpions; but woman-like she feared the  hydrophobia-skunk more for its scent than for its deadly poison.    She heeded not the half-tamed Indian on the trail; but the insolent  leer of Sonora's scum, the brutalized peon, the low caste chulo of  Chihuahua, froze into the panic-stare of abject terror under the  straight glance of her eye. The slightest motion of her tender hand to  him augured a sudden death, for she was of Arizona's daughters,  invulnerable in the armor of their self-reliant strength, a shield of  lovely innocence, white as the snow is driven.    On the Mesa del Mogollon, in the darkling Coconino Forest she  interviewed the cowboy, that valiant belted knight of modern western  chivalry, and in the chaparral she cheered the lonesome herder.    In the treasure-vaults of earth, a thousand feet below the surface,  invading the domain of Pluto's treacherous gnomes she met the hardiest  man in Arizona, the miner, who always happy is and full of hope.    Poor fellows, they hobnob with death and do not mind it!    Floods of rivers, cloudbursts in narrow gorges, the lightning of the  hills, blinding and smothering sandstorms on the desert detained her  not, for in her chosen path not on delay she thought.    By fragrant orange groves in the valley of Saltriver, past \"lowing kine  on pastures green,\" under the luring shade of palms, among the vines  she passed.    Winging her virgin-flight to snowclad pinnacles of Parnassus she pours  her jubilant songs of hope, faith, love into men's souls and women's  hearts.    \"May constant happiness attend thee, fair lady, our precious pearl in  Arizona's diadem!\"    Though time shall wreath thy raven tresses with silvery laurel, and  with his palsied hand forever stay, in the fulfilment of thy mortal  destiny, the throbbing of thy faithful heart--\"Yet shall the genius of  thy lyre with angel-hands reverberate the shining chords through untold  future ages in heavenly strains of resonance and glory, until the  solace of their faintest echoes dies within the last true heart in  Arizona.\""]]]
