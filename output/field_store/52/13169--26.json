Calling the evaporative power of good anthracite coal 1, good  bituminous coal rates at about 0.92, and coke from 0.89 to 0.95.    (28) J. W. S. asks what to impregnate paper with to give it an  agreeable smell while burning. A. You may try a strong ethereal or  alcoholic solution of benzoin, tolu, storax, olibanum or labdanum.  To burn well the paper should first be impregnated with an aqueous  solution of niter and dried.    (29) M. G. asks whether hydrogen and oxygen can be produced as rapidly  and copiously in the decomposition of water by the galvanic battery as  by the action of sulphuric acid on zinc or lead in the one case,  and by heating chlorate of potassa in the other. A. Yes, with a very  powerful current.    (30) T. G. H. asks for names of useful treatises on mechanical  movements. A. \"Scientific American Reference Book,\" and \"507  Mechanical Movements.\"    (31) R. B. T. writes: We have just set up a new engine; the cylinder  is 8 x 12, has a common slide valve. We think the valve is too short;  it is set 0.125 inch open when on center, takes steam 10 inches before  cutting off; the exhaust is very free. The engine runs about 110  revolutions per minute. We think we could save steam by using a longer  valve, and cut-off about 5/8 stroke, and make the exhaust space in the  valve shorter, so that it will shut in a portion of the exhaust and  form a cushion for the piston. About how much of the exhaust can  we shut in without overdoing it? A. You can obtain a good action by  making the ratio of compression equal to the ratio of expansion,  with the proviso that the final cushion pressure must not exceed the  initial pressure.    (32) D. B. L. writes: Our boiler after being repaired was tested at  110 lbs. cold water pressure. Three days after it gave out where it  was repaired at 58 lbs. steam pressure. To find the leak we put on  80 lbs. cold water pressure, and could not find it. We then put steam  pressure at 40 lbs., which made the leak very great, whereas with  cold water pressure we could find none. Can you explain it? A. The  phenomenon is probably due to the change of shape in the boiler when  heated.    (33) F. C. writes: Our engine is a plain slide valve engine, 24 x 9,  steam following almost to end of stroke. How shall I make a valve to  cut off at 3/4? Our exhaust now is 1 inch, steam ports 0.75, bridges  0.75. Length of valve 41/2 inches, cavity 2-3/8, travel of valve 2  inches. Will I have to enlarge the steam chest; the valve uses the  whole length of it now? A. As the length and travel of valve must be  increased, it will be necessary to lengthen the steam chest, unless  you can apply an independent cut-off valve.    (34) T. P. writes: A small basement room 9 feet high is to be heated  by a furnace in an adjoining room. By carrying the hot air pipe  through the partition midway between the floor and the ceiling it will  stand at an angle of about 45 deg.. If carried through at the top of the  room it will of course be nearer vertical. In which position of the  hot air pipe will the room be most easily heated? A. Place the hot air  pipe in the position first described. Take the cold air from a point  near the floor through a flue opening above the roof.    (35) G. M. P. asks: What is a good and cheap substitute for salt for  raising the temperature of water to 230 deg. Fah.? A. An oil bath is often  used instead. Chloride of calcium will answer as well as salt, though  not so cheap.    [Illustration: Right Triangle--sides 15, 20, 25ft.]    (36) J. D. reminds us of an old and good method of drawing a  perpendicular to a straight line for the purpose of squaring  foundations, etc. From the corner of the foundation take two lines  respectively 15 and 20 feet, and connect them by a line of 25 feet;  the angle included between the two shorter lines will be a right  angle. The numbers 3, 4, 5, or, as in the present case, their  multiples 15, 20, 25, are taken to measure respectively the  perpendicular, base, and slant side of the triangle. It is obvious  that any scale may be used so long as the ratio of 3, 4, 5, is  observed.    (37) J. H. asks what kind of iron to use in making cast iron  armatures. A. Soft gray iron.    (38) F. H. C. asks: How can I etch cheaply on glass to imitate ground  figures or transparent figures on a ground background? A. For this  purpose the sand blast is now generally used; the glass is covered  with a film of wax or varnish, through which, with suitable needles or  gravers, is etched the design; a fine sharp silicious sand impelled  by a current of air is then directed from a suitable jet over the  prepared surface, and the etching is accomplished in a few minutes.  Glass is etched also by hydrofluoric acid; the plate may be prepared  as for the sand blast, and placed face downwards over a shallow leaden  tray, containing powdered fluorspar moistened with strong oil of  vitriol and gently warmed; the gaseous hydrofluoric acid given off  rapidly etches the portions of the glass not protected by the wax or  varnish. Hydrofluoric acid should be used with great care.    (39) L. H. writes: I have seen it asserted that the parasites that  infest the Asiatic tiger's paw are an exact miniature image of itself.  Is this so? A. No.    (40) J. G. B. asks if there is any way of melting brass in a common  sand crucible for castings of a pound or so in weight for a small  engine. A. You may melt small quantities of brass in any common stove  having a good draught, using a coal fire. You may use borax as a flux.    (41) F. & Co. ask: 1. In making a telephone as described in Figs. 4  and 5, SUPPLEMENT 142, must the diaphragm be entirely free, or can it  be punched and the screws which secure the flange pass through it? A.  The diaphragm should not be punched. 2. In new form of telephone in No  20, current volume, must there be a battery in the circuit, or is the  telephone sufficient to work it? A. A battery is required.    (42) J. M. B. asks: What will prevent the hair from falling out? A.  Keep the pores of the skin open by frequent bathing and change of  underclothing. Bathe the head with clean soft water, and stimulate  the scalp with a moderately stiff brush morning and evening. The head  should be occasionally cleansed with a weak solution of glycerin soap  in dilute spirit of wine, with care to remove all traces of soap from  the hair. Use no pomades or oils of any kind.    (43) B. H. P. asks (1) how to make malleable iron, such as used in  wrenches. A. Malleable iron castings are made from mottled iron. They  are cleaned by tumbling and then packed in iron boxes with alternating  layers of rolling mill scale. The boxes are carefully luted and packed  in an annealing furnace, where they are kept at a white heat for a  week or more, and then allowed to cool gradually. 2. How is steel  or iron made to adhere to the face of the jaws of the wrench? A. By  welding.    (44) J. G. E. asks: What is the highest column of water that can  be raised from a well by means of a siphon pump with 60 lbs. steam,  likewise a 1 inch column of water with 60 lbs. steam? A. Lift, from 26  to 27 feet.    (45) W. H. W. asks: 1. Is there any solution excepting rubber that  will make cloth thoroughly waterproof, or at least withstand the  attack of water for an hour or so? It should be applied by dipping  the cloth in the solution. A. Linseed oil boiled with a little wax and  litharge is useful for some purposes. Cloth prepared with paraffin,  balata gum, the gum of the asclet pias or milkweed, naphtha solution  of the dried pulp of the bamboo berry, anhydrous aluminum soaps (see  pp. 149 and 159, \"Science Record,\" 1874), are also employed. 2. Is  there any chemical that could be combined with the solution, imparting  some property to the same for which rats or mice would have an  antipathy so as to prevent their attacks? A. A trace of phenol will  generally suffice.    (46) J. L. asks: Is the balata gum softened by animal oils or fat? A.  Yes.    (47) P. L. W. asks. What distance would a 100 lb. weight have to fall  to run a sewing machine for 5 hours? A. For an ordinary family sewing  machine, requiring about one thirtieth of a horse power, the weight  would have to fall about 3,300 feet in the 5 hours.    (48) W. G. R. asks: 1. What is the valve yoke of a steam engine? A.  We presume you refer to the rectangular yoke that receives the back  of the valve in the class of engines having balanced valves. 2. What  should be the diameter of the bore of an engine of 1 horse power with  100 lbs. pressure, also the length of stroke? A. Diameter, 23/4 inches;  stroke, 41/2 inches. 3. How are the back gears of a lathe made so as  to be thrown out of gear when it is wished to use the lathe at a high  speed? A. Ordinarily by a cam and lever, or tight and loose joint. 4.  Would 1/64 of an inch thickness of sheet steel be strong enough for  the boiler of a small model locomotive? How much pressure would it  stand to the inch? A. If the diameter does not exceed 3 inches, you  can carry a pressure of from 50 to 60 lbs. per square inch.    (49) J. W. W. asks: Which will stand the most pressure, a piece of  round iron 1 inch long and 1 inch in diameter, or a piece of gas pipe  the same dimensions, both being set upon end? A. The round iron.    (50) W. M. B. writes: 1. I have one eighth inch basswood, cherry,  butternut and walnut. Which do you advise for the sounding board of a  microphone and Hughes telephone? A. Either will do, but pine or spruce  is better. 2. Would a glazed earthen jar do for the outside of battery  described in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT, No. 149? A. Yes. 3. Could  I make insulated wire myself? If so, how? A. Wire may be insulated by  giving it a coat of shellac varnish and allowing it to become dry and  nearly hard before winding.    (51) W. H. S. asks how to satin finish tubing like sample sent. A.
