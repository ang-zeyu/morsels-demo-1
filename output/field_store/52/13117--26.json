Kimball, an Apostle (#19)"],[1," I baptized and confirmed her a member of the Church,  and at the same time prayed for her, and rebuked the disease, and  commanded it to depart from her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  She began to amend from that very hour, and in less than one week she  was performing her usual household duties, walked into the streets and  attended meetings, to the astonishment of the people. Sister Chapin  and others were also healed of their infirmities. Sister Davis'  husband was considered a staunch Universalist. He was convinced and  baptized.\"    Thence I journeyed to Plattsburg, where I staid all night with a Mr.  Mansfield, who was very friendly to me. I then went in a steamer to  St. Albans, Vt., and visited my friends in Sheldon and Bakersfield,  traveled through various parts of Vermont, visited Wright's settlement  on the top of the Green Mountains, where some were believing. I met  Elder Solon Foster at Potsdam, preaching there once, and eight or nine  bore testimony to the truth of the Gospel.    \"After an absence of about five weeks I returned to Ogdensburg, met  the brethren whom I had baptized, and they rejoiced at my return. When  I got to the house of Brother Heman Chapin, he was grinding his scythe  and fixing his cradle to commence cutting his wheat. I proposed to him  if he would furnish me a tow frock and pantaloons to put on, and a  rake, I would go into the field and rake and bind all he could cut. He  declared there was no man living could do it. Said I, 'never mind,  Brother Chapin, its nearly as easy for me to do it as to say it.' The  next morning after the dew had passed off we went into the field,  commencing at a piece of wheat which he said had three acres in it.  Said I, 'go ahead, Brother Heman, we'll cut down this piece before  dinner.' About the time he took the last clipp of the three acres I  had it bound in a bundle before he had hardly a chance to look round,  and about that time the horn blew to call us to dinner. We started  back to his house; he never spoke or said one word to me, appearing  rather confounded. The next Sabbath such a congregation of hearers I  had never seen in the United States; for priests and people had come  for twenty-five miles distance, to see and hear that \"Mormon\" who had  performed a thing that had never before been done in that country, for  Brother Chapin had proclaimed this occurrence unknown to me. I tarried  several days in those regions, preaching and baptizing.    \"August 25th, while we were assembled for a meeting our hearts were  filled with joy by the arrival of Joseph Smith, Sen., the patriarch,  and his brother John Smith, who were on a mission to bless the  churches in the eastern states.    \"On the 27th, the church, numbering twenty, that I had baptized, came  together and received patriarchal blessings under the hands of  President Joseph Smith, Sen.    \"Sunday, 28th, Father John Smith preached at 10 a. m., and four of us  bore testimony to the Book of Mormon and the truth of the work. In the  afternoon we administered the sacrament, confirmed three and blessed  the little children of the branch.    \"Monday, 20th, we ordained Levi Chapin a Teacher and Alvin Simons an  Elder to watch over the church. I then went to Black Lake, preached  and baptized one; then preached at Potsdam and baptized another.  Returned to the township of Oswegatchie, called the church together at  Ogdensburg, which numbered twenty-eight, and bade them farewell. I  left the church rejoicing in the Lord, and many around believing the  testimony.    \"Thence I pursued my journey to Victor, Ontario County, where I met  Vilate, my wife, who was visiting her friends, and I tarried a few  days with them. Thence we pursued our journey to Buffalo. Here a  magistrate came forward and paid five dollars for our passage to  Frankfort, a distance of one hundred and eighty miles. The passengers  were chiefly Swiss emigrants. After sitting and hearing them for some  time, the Spirit of the Lord came upon me, and I was enabled to preach  to them in their own language. They seemed much pleased and treated us  kindly. We had a very heavy gale while going up the lake, so that  every passenger almost and some of the hands were very sick. Many were  frightened, and one woman died, she being very feeble when she came on  board. But we reached our destination without accident, and arrived in  Kirtland, October 2nd. I was gone nearly five months, visited many of  my friends, preached much, and baptized thirty. This was the first  mission I took alone. The Lord was with me and blessed me, and  confirmed the word with signs following.\"          CHAPTER XIII.    THE WORSHIP OF MAMMON--THE TEMPORAL ABOVE THE SPIRITUAL--THE KIRTLAND  BANK--FINANCIAL DISASTERS--APOSTASY--HEBER SORROWS OVER THE DEGENERACY  OF THE TIMES.          \"Ill fares the land; to hastening ills a prey,      Where wealth accumulates and men decay.\"    During the absence of Apostle Kimball in the east, a grievous change  had come over the Church in Kirtland. The greed of gain, the spirit of  speculation was abroad in the land. Mammon had reared his altars on  consecrated ground; the money-changer was within the temple. The love  of the things of earth had usurped, in many hearts, the love of the  things of heaven, and comparatively few were free from the  soul-destroying influence of idolatry. Idolatry? Yes; the bowing down  to the modern Baal, the worship of wealth--the god of gold--the lust  after the ways and pleasures of the world.    The order of Christ's kingdom is the order of creation: firstly  spiritual, secondly temporal. When this order is subverted, \"chaos is  come again.\" Sorrow is the inevitable consequence of apostasy from the  spiritual to the temporal. \"To be carnally-minded is death; but to be  spiritually-minded is life and peace.\" Does not the fall of man  illustrate this principle? Can he descend from heaven to earth without  causing and enduring pain?    The spiritual must sway the temporal, the earthly be ruled by the  heavenly. How else shall it be sanctified? It is the spirit in man  that moves the body, not the body the spirit. In the Church, Christ's  body, the spiritual must reign supreme. The temporal on the heart's  throne is ever the usurper; the spiritual crowned and sceptred, ruler  by right divine.    Jacob is spiritual; Japheth is temporal. The mission of Israel and the  mission of the Gentiles are as the poles antipodal; God's ways and  man's ways, as heaven and earth apart.    \"We were very much grieved,\" says Heber, \"on our arrival in Kirtland,  to see the spirit of speculation that was prevailing in the Church.  Trade and traffic seemed to engross the time and attention of the  Saints. When we left Kirtland a city lot was worth about $150; but on  our return, to our astonishment, the same lot was said to be worth  from $500. to $1000., according to location; and some men, who, when I  left, could hardly get food to eat, I found on my return to be men of  supposed great wealth; in fact everything in the place seemed to be  moving in great prosperity, and all seemed determined to become rich;  in my feelings they were artificial or imaginary riches. This  appearance of prosperity led many of the Saints to believe that the  time had arrived for the Lord to enrich them with the treasures of the  earth, and believing so, it stimulated them to great exertions, so  much so that two of the Twelve, Lyman E. Johnson and John F. Boynton,  went to New York and purchased to the amount of $20,000 worth of  goods, and entered into the mercantile business, borrowing  considerable money from Polly Voce and other Saints in Boston and the  regions round about, and which they have never repaid.\"    The Prophet Joseph says of those times: \"The spirit of speculation in  lands and property of all kinds, which was so prevalent throughout the  whole nation, was taking deep root in the Church. As the fruits of  this spirit, evil surmising, fault-finding, disunion, dissension and  apostasy followed in quick succession, and it seemed as though all the  powers of earth and hell were combining their influence in an especial  manner to overthrow the Church at once and make a final end. The enemy  abroad and apostates in our midst united in their schemes, flour and  provisions were turned towards other markets, and many became  disaffected towards me, as though I were the sole cause of those very  evils I was strenuously striving against, and which were actually  brought upon us by the brethren not giving heed to my counsel.\"    During this period, the Kirtland Safety Society was organized, with a  view to controlling the prevailing sentiment and directing it in  legitimate channels. The ablest and staunchest men in Israel,  including the Prophet and most of the Apostles, were made officers and  members of the association.    Then came the financial crash of 1837, by which so many of the banking  and business houses of the country were prostrated. Nearly all the  banks, one after another, suspended specie payment, \"and gold and  silver rose in value in direct ratio with the depreciation of paper  currency.\" The Kirtland Bank shared a similar fate to many others, and  went down in the whirlpool of financial ruin. One of the causes  alleged for its failure was the misfeasance of some of those who were  entrusted with the funds of the Bank. Heber says that Warren Parrish,  one of the clerks, \"afterwards acknowledged that he took $20,000, and  there was strong evidence that he took more. Those of integrity in the  Church replaced the stolen money at the expense of all they had.\" A  counterfeit, falsely reputed to have been issued by the Bank, was also  used by its enemies as a means to effect its overthrow.    As usual the onus of responsibility was placed upon the shoulders of  the Prophet, although he had withdrawn from the institution some time  before. He was falsely accused of dishonesty and fraud, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3534"],[0,"A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson (#19)"],[1,"by promulgating it, we feigned that our  preparations were directed against Broken Bay; and that the man who  had wounded the governor was the object of punishment. It was now also  determined, being full moon, that our operations should be carried on in  the night, both for the sake of secrecy, and for avoiding the extreme heat  of the day.    A little before sun-set on the evening of the 22nd, we marched. Lieutenant  Abbot, and ensign Prentice, of the New South Wales corps, were the two  officers under my command, and with three sergeants, three corporals, and  thirty privates, completed the detachment.    We proceeded directly to the fords of the north arm of Botany Bay, which we  had crossed in our last expedition, on the banks of which we were compelled  to wait until a quarter past two in the morning, for the ebb of the tide.  As these passing-places consist only of narrow slips of ground, on each  side of which are dangerous holes; and as fording rivers in the night is at  all times an unpleasant task, I determined before we entered the water,  to disburthen the men as much as possible; that in case of stepping wrong  every one might be as ready, as circumstances would admit, to recover  himself. The firelock and cartouche-box were all that we carried, the  latter tied fast on the top of the head, to prevent it from being wetted.  The knapsacks, etc. I left in charge of a sergeant and six men, who from  their low stature and other causes, were most likely to impede our march,  the success of which I knew hinged on our ability, by a rapid movement, to  surprise the village before daybreak.    The two rivers were crossed without any material accident: and in pursuit  of my resolution, I ordered the guides to conduct us by the nearest route,  without heeding difficulty, or impediment of road. Having continued to push  along the river-bank very briskly for three quarters of an hour, we were  suddenly stopped by a creek, about sixty yards wide, which extended to our  right, and appeared dry from the tide being out: I asked if it could be  passed, or whether it would be better to wheel round the head of it. Our  guides answered that it was bad to cross, but might be got over, which  would save us more than a quarter of a mile. Knowing the value of time, I  directly bade them to push through, and every one began to follow as well  as he could. They who were foremost had not, however, got above half over  when the difficulty of progress was sensibly experienced. We were immersed,  nearly to the waist in mud, so thick and tenacious, that it was not without  the most vigorous exertion of every muscle of the body, that the legs could  be disengaged. When we had reached the middle, our distress became not only  more pressing, but serious, and each succeeding step, buried us deeper. At  length a sergeant of grenadiers stuck fast, and declared himself incapable  of moving either forward or backward; and just after, Ensign Prentice and  I felt ourselves in a similar predicament, close together. 'I find it  impossible to move; I am sinking;' resounded on every side. What to do  I knew not: every moment brought increase of perplexity, and augmented  danger, as those who could not proceed kept gradually subsiding. From our  misfortunes, however, those in the rear profited. Warned by what they saw  and heard, they inclined to the right towards the head of the creek, and  thereby contrived to pass over.    Our distress would have terminated fatally, had not a soldier cried out  to those on shore to cut boughs of trees*, and throw them to us--a lucky  thought, which certainly saved many of us from perishing miserably; and  even with this assistance, had we been burdened by our knapsacks, we could  not have emerged; for it employed us near half an hour to disentangle some  of our number. The sergeant of grenadiers in particular, was sunk to his  breast-bone, and so firmly fixed in that the efforts of many men were  required to extricate him, which was effected in the moment after I had  ordered one of the ropes, destined to bind the captive Indians, to be  fastened under his arms.    [*I had often read of this contrivance to facilitate the passage of a  morass. But I confess, that in my confusion I had entirely forgotten it,  and probably should have continued to do so until too late to be of use.]    Having congratulated each other on our escape from this 'Serbonian Bog,'  and wiped our arms (half of which were rendered unserviceable by the mud)  we once more pushed forward to our object, within a few hundred yards of  which we found ourselves about half an hour before sunrise. Here I formed  the detachment into three divisions, and having enjoined the most perfect  silence, in order, if possible, to deceive Indian vigilance, each division  was directed to take a different route, so as to meet at the village at the  same moment.    We rushed rapidly on, and nothing could succeed more exactly than the  arrival of the several detachments. To our astonishment, however, we found  not a single native at the huts; nor was a canoe to be seen on any part of  the bay. I was at first inclined to attribute this to our arriving half an  hour too late, from the numberless impediments we had encountered. But  on closer examination, there appeared room to believe, that many days had  elapsed since an Indian had been on the spot, as no mark of fresh fires, or  fish bones, was to be found.    Disappointed and fatigued, we would willingly have profited by the  advantage of being near water, and have halted to refresh. But on  consultation, it was found, that unless we reached in an hour the rivers  we had so lately passed, it would be impossible, on account of the tide,  to cross to our baggage, in which case we should be without food until  evening. We therefore pushed back, and by dint of alternately running and  walking, arrived at the fords, time enough to pass with ease and safety.  So excessive, however, had been our efforts, and so laborious our progress,  that several of the soldiers, in the course of the last two miles, gave up,  and confessed themselves unable to proceed farther. All that I could do for  these poor fellows, was to order their comrades to carry their muskets, and  to leave with them a small party of those men who were least exhausted, to  assist them and hurry them on. In three quarters of an hour after we  had crossed the water, they arrived at it, just time enough to effect a  passage.    The necessity of repose, joined to the succeeding heat of the day, induced  us to prolong our halt until four o'clock in the afternoon, when we  recommenced our operations on the opposite side of the north arm to that  we had acted upon in the morning. Our march ended at sunset, without  our seeing a single native. We had passed through the country which the  discoverers of Botany Bay extol as 'some of the finest meadows in the  world*.' These meadows, instead of grass, are covered with high coarse  rushes, growing in a rotten spongy bog, into which we were plunged  knee-deep at every step.    [*The words which are quoted may be found in Mr. Cook's first voyage, and  form part of his description of Botany Bay. It has often fallen to my lot  to traverse these fabled plains; and many a bitter execration have I heard  poured on those travellers, who could so faithlessly relate what they saw.]    Our final effort was made at half past one o'clock next morning; and after  four hours toil, ended as those preceding it had done, in disappointment  and vexation. At nine o'clock we returned to Sydney, to report our  fruitless peregrination.    But if we could not retaliate on the murderer of M'Entire, we found no  difficulty in punishing offences committed within our own observation. Two  natives, about this time, were detected in robbing a potato garden. When  seen, they ran away, and a sergeant and a party of soldiers were dispatched  in pursuit of them. Unluckily it was dark when they overtook them, with  some women at a fire; and the ardour of the soldiers transported them so  far that, instead of capturing the offenders, they fired in among them. The  women were taken, but the two men escaped.    On the following day, blood was traced from the fireplace to the sea-side,  where it seemed probable that those who had lost it, had embarked. The  natives were observed to become immediately shy; but an exact knowledge of  the mischief which had been committed, was not gained until the end of two  days, when they said that a man of the name of Bangai (who was known to  be one of the pilferers) was wounded and dead. Imeerawanyee, however,  whispered that though he was wounded, he was not dead. A hope now existed  that his life might be saved; and Mr. White, taking Imeerawanyee, Nanbaree,  and a woman with him, set out for the spot where he was reported to be. But  on their reaching it, they were told by some people who were there that the  man was dead, and that the corpse was deposited in a bay about a mile  off. Thither they accordingly repaired, and found it as described,  covered--except one leg, which seemed to be designedly left bare--with  green boughs and a fire burning near it. Those who had performed the  funeral obsequies seemed to have been particularly solicitous for the  protection of the face, which was covered with a thick branch, interwoven  with grass and fern so as to form a complete screen. Around the neck was  a strip of the bark of which they make fishing lines, and a young strait  stick growing near was stripped of its bark and bent down so as to form an  arch over the body, in which position it was confined by a forked branch  stuck into the earth.    On examining the corpse, it was found to be warm. Through the shoulder had  passed a musquet ball, which had divided the subclavian artery and caused  death by loss of blood. No mark of any remedy having been applied could  be discovered. Possibly the nature of the"]]]
