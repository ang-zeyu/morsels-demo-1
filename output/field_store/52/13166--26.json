[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38315"],[0,"Artistic Anatomy of Animals (#19)"],[1,"the femur of certain animals with that of man, we see that  the corresponding details of form are readily recognisable, but they are  slightly modified. Thus, on examining the superior extremity, we find  there a head, a neck, a great trochanter, and a lesser; but the neck is  usually short and thick, and the great trochanter does not occupy the  same level with regard to the articular head of the bone. In man, the  great trochanter does not rise to the level of the head of the femur; in  the dog and the cat it approaches that level; in the horse and in  ruminants it rises above it.    With regard to the inferior extremity, its surfaces undergo  modifications which are further accentuated as we pass from the  digitigrades to the ungulates, or unguligrades. We know that in man the  femoral trochlea is continuous behind, without interruption, with the  condyles--that is to say, that each of the condyles is the continuation  of one of the lips of the trochlea. We have just said that the trochlea  is continuous without interruption with the condyles; this is accurate.  Nevertheless, we must remark that, at the level of the junction of these  surfaces, the bone presents a slight constriction, which is more marked  on the external than on the internal aspect. This constriction, which is  but slightly marked in man, is accentuated in the dog and the cat; in  the ruminants and the solipeds it is still more pronounced so that we  may say that in these latter the trochlea and the condyles are almost  completely separated.    There is another modification in regard to the prominence and extent of  the two lips of the trochlea. In man, the external lip of the trochlea  reaches higher than the internal, and it is more prominent in front. In  the dog, these lips are equal with regard to thickness, but the external  still reaches higher than the internal; in the cat, they are equal in  every respect; in ruminants and solipeds the internal lip is wider,  thicker, and rises higher than the external.    In animals the trochlea is, as a general rule, narrower than in man, and  the condyles are more prominent posteriorly; so that, when viewed from  one of the lateral aspects, the inferior extremity of the femur is, in  them, better developed in the antero-posterior direction.    In birds, the femur is shorter than the bones of the leg; its great  trochanter is in contact with a prominence which occupies the posterior  part of the border of the cotyloid cavity. Instead of articulating at  the level of the knee, with the knee-cap and tibia only, as in man, it  articulates, in addition, with the superior extremity of the fibula. A  similar arrangement is found in marsupials and reptiles.    =The Knee-cap.=--This bone, developed in the thickness of the tendon of  the triceps muscle of the thigh, is in contact, by its posterior  surface, with the femoral trochlea. The two articular surfaces which are  applied to the lips of the trochlea present, with regard to their  extent, an inequality which is in proportion to the arrangement which we  have above indicated--that is, while in man it is the external surface  which is the larger, in the horse it is the internal. We shall see what  the general form of the knee-cap is when we come, later on, to study  more particularly the posterior limbs of some animals.      The Leg    The skeleton of the leg consists of two bones: the tibia and the fibula.  The tibia is the more internal and the larger of the two; the fibula is  slender, and situated on the outer side, and a little posterior to, the  preceding. The fibula is more or less developed according to the  species; in some it is complete, in others it is very much atrophied.    This peculiarity may be compared with that which we have drawn attention  to regarding the development of the ulna; but here the seriation is less  distinct. Not only in the different species, but even in the individuals  of the same species, the development of the fibula presents little  regularity. In quadrupeds, the bones of the leg are directed obliquely  downwards and backwards, so that they form, with the femur, which is  directed obliquely downwards and forwards, an angle, the apex of which  is placed at the anterior surface of the knee.    =Tibia.=--The tibia of quadrupeds is readily comparable with that of  man; as in the case of the latter, its shaft has three surfaces--an  external, which is hollowed out in its upper portion, and becomes  anterior below; an internal, slightly convex and subcutaneous; the  posterior, which presents, in its superior part, a crest, the oblique  line of the tibia, and some rugosities. The borders separate the  surfaces. The anterior border, or crest of the tibia, is prominent in  its superior part; below it gradually disappears in passing towards the  internal aspect of the inferior extremity. The external and internal  borders separate the corresponding surfaces from the posterior one.    The superior extremity is thick, and expands in forming three  tuberosities: two lateral and an anterior. The anterior tuberosity,  situated at the superior part of the crest of the tibia, is very  prominent; for this reason the superior extremity is very much expanded  in the antero-posterior direction--hence it results that this diameter  is equal to the transverse, and sometimes even greater. In man, it is  the latter which is the larger. The anterior tuberosity is visible under  the skin.    The inferior extremity, less thick, is prolonged internally by a  prominence which corresponds to the internal malleolus of man. In  animals whose fibula is but slightly developed the tibia presents, on  the external part of its inferior extremity, a small prominence, which  replaces the fibular malleolus. The ruminants must, however, be  excepted, in which we find in this region a special bone, which certain  authors look on as the inferior part of the fibula (see p. 97). The  inferior surface of this extremity of the tibia is articular; and is in  contact with one of the tarsal bones, the astragalus. Because the  superior surface of this latter has the form of a pulley, a pulley much  more marked than that on the human astragalus, the corresponding surface  of the tibia, which has the opposite form, presents two lateral  cavities, separated by a median ridge, which is directed forwards and  slightly outwards; this ridge projects into the groove of the pulley.    =The Fibula.=--This bone, situated at the back of the external  surface of the tibia, is, as we have said, more or less developed. Its  superior extremity, or head, articulates with the external tuberosity  of the tibia. Its inferior extremity, when it exists--it is this  which disappears in animals which have the fibula incompletely  developed--forms a prominence which, placed on the external surface of  the inferior extremity of the tibia, articulates with the astragalus,  and recalls the external malleolus of man.    We have stated above that it is the inferior extremity of the fibula  which disappears when the bone is incompletely developed; it is  necessary to except the bat, in which the fibula, fairly well developed  at its inferior extremity, by which it articulates with the tibia, thins  off in its superior portion, and does not reach the corresponding  extremity of the latter. Further, as in this animal the surface of the  knee, which corresponds to the anterior surface of the same region in  other animals, is turned backwards, the result is that the fibula is  situated on the inner side of the tibia, instead of being placed on the  outer.      The Foot    The foot, in animals, as well as in man, is formed of three portions,  which, as we pass from the part which articulates with the leg towards  the terminal extremity, are: the tarsus, the metatarsus, and the toes.  These three portions are the homologues of the carpus, the metacarpus,  and the fingers, which, as we have already seen in the case of the hand,  are the osseous groups which form its skeleton. The tarsus is formed of  short bones, as the carpus is; these are, in man, seven in number. The  bones are arranged in two rows: one, the posterior, formed of two bones  superimposed--the astragalus, by which the tarsus articulates with the  leg, and the calcaneum, which forms the prominence of the heel; and an  anterior row formed of five juxtaposed ones--the cuboid, situated  externally, and the scaphoid internally, in front of which are found the  three cuneiforms. To the tarsus succeeds the metatarsus, whose form  reminds us very much of that of the metacarpals.    With regard to the toes, which we enumerate in proceeding from the most  internal to the most external, they are formed of phalanges, which are  three in number for the four outer toes; but the number is reduced to  two in the case of the first--that is, the so-called great-toe.    The bones of the tarsus are not seven in all animals; they are fewer in  ruminants and solipeds. We already know that, in the latter, the  metacarpals and the digits are equally reduced in number; the same is  the case for the metatarsals and the toes. We will analyze these  differences when dealing with the species individually.    When we studied the anterior limbs, we saw in passing from the  plantigrades to the digitigrades, and finally the ungulates, or  unguligrades, as the hand became hyperextended, the carpus was raised  and more and more removed from the ground. We shall establish the  existence of the same condition in the posterior limbs; in the  plantigrades the tarsus rests on the ground; in the digitigrades it is  removed from it; while in the unguligrades the distance which separates  it from the point of support is still more considerable; and it is,  indeed, necessary to imagine that if these latter were plantigrades,  would occupy the position on the ground which is indicated by Fig. 47.    In veterinary anatomy the tarsus is called the _ham_; a name we adopt  in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3833"],[0,"Australian Legendary Tales: folk-lore of the Noongahburrahs as told to the (#19)"],[1," goo  gurrahwulday.
