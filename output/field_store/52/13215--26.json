The winter of 1848 '49 was a period of intense activity throughout  California.  The rainy season was unfavorable to the operations of  gold-mining, and was very hard upon the thousands of houseless men  and women who dwelt in the mountains, and even in the towns.  Most  of the natives and old inhabitants had returned to their ranches  and houses; yet there were not roofs enough in the country to  shelter the thousands who had arrived by sea and by land.  The news  had gone forth to the whole civilized world that gold in fabulous  quantities was to be had for the mere digging, and adventurers came  pouring in blindly to seek their fortunes, without a thought of  house or food.  Yerba Buena had been converted into San Francisco.  Sacramento City had been laid out, lots were being rapidly sold,  and the town was being built up as an entrepot to the mines.  Stockton also had been chosen as a convenient point for trading  with the lower or southern mines.  Captain Sutter was the sole  proprietor of the former, and Captain Charles Weber was the owner  of the site of Stockton, which was as yet known as \"French Camp.\"          CHAPTER III.    EARLY RECOLLECTIONS OF CALIFORNIA--(CONTINUED).    1849-1850.      The department headquarters still remained at Monterey, but, with  the few soldiers, we had next to nothing to do.  In midwinter we  heard of the approach of a battalion of the Second Dragoons, under  Major Lawrence Pike Graham, with Captains Rucker, Coutts, Campbell,  and others, along.  So exhausted were they by their long march from  Upper Mexico that we had to send relief to meet them as they  approached.  When this command reached Los Angeles, it was left  there as the garrison, and Captain A. J. Smith's company of the  First Dragoons was brought up to San Francisco.  We were also  advised that the Second Infantry, Colonel B. Riley, would be sent  out around Cape Horn in sailing-ships; that the Mounted Rifles,  under Lieutenant-Colonel Loring, would march overland to Oregon;  and that Brigadier-General Persifer F. Smith would come out in  chief command on the Pacific coast.  It was also known that a  contract had been entered into with parties in New York and New  Orleans for a monthly line of steamers from those cities to  California, via Panama.  Lieutenant-Colonel Burton had come up from  Lower California, and, as captain of the Third Artillery, he was  assigned to command Company F, Third Artillery, at Monterey.  Captain Warner remained at Sacramento, surveying; and Halleck,  Murray, Ord, and I, boarded with Dona Augustias.  The season was  unusually rainy and severe, but we passed the time with the usual  round of dances and parties.  The time fixed for the arrival of the  mail-steamer was understood to be about January 1, 1849, but the  day came and went without any tidings of her.  Orders were given to  Captain Burton to announce her arrival by firing a national  salute, and each morning we listened for the guns from the fort.  The month of January passed, and the greater part of February, too.  As was usual, the army officers celebrated the 22d of February with  a grand ball, given in the new stone school-house, which Alcalde  Walter Colton had built.  It was the largest and best hall then in  California.  The ball was really a handsome affair, and we kept it  up nearly all night.  The next morning we were at breakfast:  present, Dona Augustias, and Manuelita, Halleck, Murray, and  myself.  We were dull and stupid enough until a gun from the fort  aroused us, then another and another.  \"The steamer\" exclaimed all,  and, without waiting for hats or any thing, off we dashed.  I  reached the wharf hatless, but the dona sent my cap after me by a  servant.  The white puffs of smoke hung around the fort, mingled  with the dense fog, which hid all the water of the bay, and well  out to sea could be seen the black spars of some unknown vessel.  At the wharf I found a group of soldiers and a small row-boat,  which belonged to a brig at anchor in the bay.  Hastily ordering a  couple of willing soldiers to get in and take the oars, and Mr.  Larkin and Mr. Hartnell asking to go along, we jumped in and pushed  off.  Steering our boat toward the spars, which loomed up above the  fog clear and distinct, in about a mile we came to the black hull  of the strange monster, the long-expected and most welcome steamer  California.  Her wheels were barely moving, for her pilot could not  see the shore-line distinctly, though the hills and Point of Pines  could be clearly made out over the fog, and occasionally a glimpse  of some white walls showed where the town lay.  A \"Jacob's ladder\"  was lowered for us from the steamer, and in a minute I scrambled up  on deck, followed by Larkin and Hartnell, and we found ourselves  in the midst of many old friends.  There was Canby, the  adjutant-general, who was to take my place; Charley Hoyt, my cousin;  General Persifer F. Smith and wife; Gibbs, his aide-de-camp; Major  Ogden, of the Engineers, and wife; and, indeed, many old  Californians, among them Alfred Robinson, and Frank Ward with his  pretty bride. By the time the ship was fairly at anchor we had  answered a million of questions about gold and the state of the  country; and, learning that the ship was out of fuel, had informed  the captain (Marshall) that there was abundance of pine-wood, but no  willing hands to cut it; that no man could be hired at less than an  ounce of gold a day, unless the soldiers would volunteer to do it  for some agreed-upon price.  As for coal, there was not a pound in  Monterey, or anywhere else in California.  Vessels with coal were  known to be en route around Cape Horn, but none had yet reached  California.    The arrival of this steamer was the beginning of a new epoch on the  Pacific coast; yet there she lay, helpless, without coal or fuel.  The native Californians, who had never seen a steamship, stood for  days on the beach looking at her, with the universal exclamation,  \"Tan feo!\"--how ugly!--and she was truly ugly when compared with  the clean, well-sparred frigates and sloops-of-war that had  hitherto been seen on the North Pacific coast.  It was first  supposed it would take ten days to get wood enough to prosecute her  voyage, and therefore all the passengers who could took up their  quarters on shore.  Major Canby relieved me, and took the place I  had held so long as adjutant-general of the Department of  California.  The time seemed most opportune for me to leave the  service, as I had several splendid offers of employment and of  partnership, and, accordingly, I made my written resignation; but  General Smith put his veto upon it, saying that he was to command  the Division of the Pacific, while General Riley was to have the  Department of California, and Colonel Loring that of Oregon.  He  wanted me as his adjutant-general, because of my familiarity with  the country, and knowledge of its then condition: At the time, he  had on his staff Gibbs as aide-de-camp, and Fitzgerald as  quartermaster.  He also had along with him quite a retinue of  servants, hired with a clear contract to serve him for a whole year  after reaching California, every one of whom deserted, except a  young black fellow named Isaac.  Mrs. Smith, a pleasant but  delicate Louisiana lady, had a white maid-servant, in whose  fidelity she had unbounded confidence; but this girl was married to  a perfect stranger, and off before she had even landed in San  Francisco.  It was, therefore, finally arranged that, on the  California, I was to accompany General Smith to San Francisco as  his adjutant-general.  I accordingly sold some of my horses, and  arranged for others to go up by land; and from that time I became  fairly enlisted in the military family of General Persifer F.  Smith.    I parted with my old commander, Colonel Mason, with sincere regret.  To me he had ever been kind and considerate, and, while stern,  honest to a fault, he was the very embodiment of the principle of  fidelity to the interests of the General Government.  He possessed  a native strong intellect, and far more knowledge of the principles  of civil government and law than he got credit for.  In private and  public expenditures he was extremely economical, but not penurious.  In cases where the officers had to contribute money for parties and  entertainments, he always gave a double share, because of his  allowance of double rations.  During our frequent journeys, I was  always caterer, and paid all the bills.  In settling with him he  required a written statement of the items of account, but never  disputed one of them.  During our time, California was, as now,  full of a bold, enterprising, and speculative set of men, who were  engaged in every sort of game to make money.  I know that  Colonel-Mason was beset by them to use his position to make a  fortune for himself and his friends; but he never bought land or  town-lots, because, he said, it was his place to hold the public  estate for the Government as free and unencumbered by claims as  possible; and when I wanted him to stop the public-land sales in San  Francisco, San Jose, etc., he would not; for, although he did not  believe the titles given by the alcaldes worth a cent, yet they  aided to settle the towns and public lands, and he thought, on the  whole, the Government would be benefited thereby.  The same thing  occurred as to the gold-mines.  He never took a title to a town lot,  unless it was one, of no real value, from Alcalde Colton, in  Monterey, of which I have never heard since.  He did take a share in  the store which Warner, Beator, and I, opened at Coloma, paid his  share of the capital, five hundred dollars, and received his share  of the profits, fifteen hundred dollars.  I think also he took a  share in a venture to China with Larkin and others; but, on leaving  California, he was glad to sell "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4362"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of P. H. Sheridan, General, United States Army — Complete (#19)"],[1,"Confederate cavalry.  This was  handsomely met by the reserve under Captain Archibald P. Campbell, of  the Second Michigan, who, dismounting a portion of his command,  received the enemy with such a volley from his Colt's repeating  rifles that the squadron broke and fled in all directions.  We were  not molested further, and resumed our work, intending to extend the  break toward Baldwin, but receiving orders from Elliott to return to  Booneville immediately, the men were recalled, and we started to  rejoin the main command.    In returning to Booneville, I found the railroad track above where I  had struck it blocked by trains that we had thus cut off, and the  woods and fields around the town covered with several thousand  Confederate soldiers.  These were mostly convalescents and  disheartened stragglers belonging to General Beauregard's army, and  from them we learned that Corinth was being evacuated.  I spent some  little time in an endeavor to get these demoralized men into an open  field, with a view to some future disposition of them; but in the  midst of the undertaking I received another order from Colonel  Elliott to join him at once.  The news of the evacuation had also  reached Elliott, and had disclosed a phase of the situation so  different from that under which he had viewed it when we arrived at  Booneville, that he had grown anxious to withdraw, lest we should be  suddenly pounced upon by an overwhelming force from some one of the  columns in retreat.  Under such circumstances my prisoners would  prove a decided embarrassment, so I abandoned further attempts to get  them together--not even paroling them, which I thought might have  been done with but little risk.    In the meantime the captured cars had been fired, and as their  complete destruction was assured by explosions from those containing  ammunition, they needed no further attention, so I withdrew my men  and hastened to join Elliott, taking along some Confederate officers  whom I had retained from among four or five hundred prisoners  captured when making the original dash below the town.    The losses in my regiment, and, in fact, those of the entire command,  were insignificant.  The results of the expedition were important;  the railroad being broken so thoroughly as to cut off all rolling  stock north of Booneville, and to place at the service of General  Halleck's army the cars and locomotives of which the retreating  Confederates were now so much in need.  In addition, we burned  twenty-six cars containing ten thousand stand of small arms, three  pieces of artillery, a great quantity of clothing, a heavy supply of  ammunition, and the personal baggage of General Leonidas Polk.  A  large number of prisoners, mostly sick and convalescent, also fell  into our hands; but as we could not carry them with us--such a hurried  departure was an immediate necessity, by reason of our critical  situation--the process of paroling them was not completed, and they  doubtless passed back to active service in the Confederacy, properly  enough unrecognized as prisoners of war by their superiors.    In returning, the column marched back by another indirect route to  its old camp near Farmington, where we learned that the whole army  had moved into and beyond Corinth, in pursuit of Beauregard, on the  13th of May, the very day we had captured Booneville.  Although we  had marched about one hundred and eighty miles in four days, we were  required to take part, of course, in the pursuit of the Confederate  army.  So, resting but one night in our old camp, we were early in  the saddle again on the morning of the 2d of June.  Marching south  through Corinth, we passed on the 4th of June the scene of our late  raid, viewing with much satisfaction, as we took the road toward  Blackland, the still smoldering embers of the burned trains.    On the 4th of June I was ordered to proceed with my regiment along  the Blackland road to determine the strength of the enemy in that  direction, as it was thought possible we might capture, by a  concerted movement which General John Pope had suggested to General  Halleck, a portion of Beauregard's rear guard.  Pushing the  Confederate scouts rapidly in with a running fire for a mile or more,  while we were approaching a little stream, I hoped to gobble the main  body of the enemy's pickets.  I therefore directed the sabre  battalion of the regiment, followed by that portion of it armed with  revolving rifles, to dash forward in column, cut off these videttes  before they could cross the stream, and then gather them in.  The  pickets fled hastily, however, and a pell-mell pursuit carried us  over the stream at their heels by a little bridge, with no thought of  halting till we gained a hill on the other side, and suddenly found  ourselves almost in the camp of a strong body of artillery and  infantry.  Captain Campbell being in advance, hurriedly dismounted  his battalion for a further forward movement on foot, but it was  readily seen that the enemy was present in such heavy force as almost  to ensure our destruction, and I gave orders for a hasty withdrawal.  We withdrew without loss under cover of thick woods, aided much,  however, by the consternation of the Confederates, who had hardly  recovered from their surprise at our sudden appearance in their camp  before we had again placed the stream between them and us by  recrossing the bridge.  The reconnoissance was a success in one way  --that is, in finding out that the enemy was at the point supposed by,  General Pope; but it also had a tendency to accelerate Beauregard's  retreat, for in a day or two his whole line fell back as far south as  Guntown, thus rendering abortive the plans for bagging a large  portion of his army.    General Beauregard's evacuation of Corinth and retreat southward were  accomplished in the face of a largely superior force of Union troops,  and he reached the point where he intended to halt for reorganization  without other loss than that sustained in the destruction of the cars  and supplies at Booneville, and the capture of some stragglers and  deserters that fell into our hands while we were pressing his rear  from General Pope's flank.  The number of these was quite large, and  indicated that the enemy was considerably demoralized.  Under such  circumstances, an energetic and skillfully directed pursuit might not  have made certain the enemy's destruction, but it would largely have  aided in disintegrating his forces, and I never could quite  understand why it was not ordered.  The desultory affairs between  rear and advance guards seemed as a general, thing to have no  particular purpose in view beyond finding out where the enemy was,  and when he was found, since no supporting colums were at hand and no  one in supreme control was present to give directions, our  skirmishing was of little avail and brought but small reward.    A short time subsequent to these occurrences, Colonel Elliott was  made a brigadier-general, and as General Pope appointed him his  Chief-of-Staff, I, on the 11th of June, 1862, fell in command of the  brigade by seniority.  For the rest of the month but little of moment  occurred, and we settled down into camp at Booneville on the 26th of  June, in a position which my brigade had been ordered to take up some  twenty miles, in advance of the main army for the purpose of covering  its front.  Although but a few days had elapsed from the date of my  appointment as colonel of the Second Michigan to that of my  succeeding to the command of the brigade, I believe I can say with  propriety that I had firmly established myself in the confidence of  the officers and men of the regiment, and won their regard by  thoughtful care.  I had striven unceasingly to have them well fed and  well clothed, had personally looked after the selection of their  camps, and had maintained such a discipline as to allay former  irritation.    Men who march, scout, and fight, and suffer all the hardships that  fall to the lot of soldiers in the field, in order to do vigorous  work must have the best bodily sustenance, and every comfort that can  be provided.  I knew from practical experience on the frontier that  my efforts in this direction would not only be appreciated, but  requited by personal affection and gratitude; and, further, that such  exertions would bring the best results to me.  Whenever my authority  would permit I saved my command from needless sacrifices and  unnecessary toil; therefore, when hard or daring work was to be done  I expected the heartiest response, and always got it.  Soldiers are  averse to seeing their comrades killed without compensating results,  and none realize more quickly than they the blundering that often  takes place on the field of battle.  They want some tangible  indemnity for the loss of life, and as victory is an offset the value  of which is manifest, it not only makes them content to shed their  blood, but also furnishes evidence of capacity in those who command  them.  My regiment had lost very few men since coming under my  command, but it seemed, in the eyes of all who belonged to it, that  casualties to the enemy and some slight successes for us had repaid  every sacrifice, and in consequence I had gained not only their  confidence as soldiers, but also their esteem and love as men, and to  a degree far beyond what I then realized.    As soon as the camp of my brigade was pitched at Booneville, I began  to scout in every direction, to obtain a knowledge of the enemy's  whereabouts and learn the ground about me.  My standing in drawing at  the Military Academy had never been so high as to warrant the belief  that I could ever prove myself an expert, but a few practical lessons  in that line were impressed on me there, and I had retained enough to  enable me to make rough maps that could be readily understood, and  which would be suitable to replace the erroneous skeleton outlines"]]]
