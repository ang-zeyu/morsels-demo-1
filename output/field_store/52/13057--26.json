Any fair historical account of the  development of the Sonata-Form should recognize the Italians,  Sammartini and Galuppi; the gifted Belgian Gossec, who exercised such  a marked influence in Paris, and above all, the Bohemian Johann  Stamitz (1717-1757), the leader of the famous Mannheim Orchestra, of  whom we shall speak further when we come to the orchestra as a medium.  In many of Stamitz's Symphonies we find the essential first-movement  structure (_i.e._, tripartite grouping with a clear second theme) and,  as Riemann says in his _Handbuch der Musikgeschichte_, \"Their sincere  phraseology, their boldness of conception and the masterly _thematic  development_ give Stamitz's works lasting value. Haydn and Mozart rest  absolutely upon his shoulders.\"[91]    [Footnote 87: Except in the comparatively rare cases where we have a  Fugue on two subjects.]    [Footnote 88: Illuminating comments on this point will be found in  _Outlines of Musical Form_ from W.H. Hadow's _Studies in Modern Music_  (2nd Series).]    [Footnote 89: See the prelude in D major of the second book of the  _Well-tempered Clavichord_.]    [Footnote 90: For further information consult the first chapter of  J.S. Shedlock's _The Pianoforte Sonata_.]    [Footnote 91: For an extended account of this development see the  second chapter, Vol. II, of _The Art of Music_ (The National Society  of Music, N.Y.). See also Chapter XIX of Pratt's _History of Music_.]    The other marked characteristic of the Sonata-Form is the _second_  part which is known as the Development Section; for, as we shall soon  explain, the structure as a whole is tripartite. In this portion of  the movement the composer has an opportunity to improvise, as it were,  with his material, using one theme or both as already presented. Dry  and labored development sections may, of course, be found in certain  Sonatas and Symphonies, but in the great works of such masters as  Beethoven, Brahms, Tchaikowsky and d'Indy the development is the most  exciting part of the movement. The hearer is conducted through a  musical excursion; every device of rhythmic variety, of modulatory  change and polyphonic imitation being employed to enhance the beauty  of the themes and to reveal their latent possibilities.    Before going further, it is well to point out a confusion which often  arises between the terms Sonata and Sonata-Form. When we speak of  Sonata-_Form_ we mean invariably the structural treatment as to number  of themes, key-relationship, etc., of _any single_ movement within a  series.[92] By the term Sonata is meant a composition generally in  three or four movements, _e.g._, First Movement, Slow Movement, Minuet  or Scherzo and Finale; of which, in most examples of the classic  school, the First Movement--and often the last--were in Sonata-Form.  An alternative name, indeed, for Sonata-Form is First Movement Form.  Beginning with Beethoven, however, composers began to exhibit great  freedom in the application of the Sonata-Form. We find Sonatas of  Beethoven, notably the set op. 31, in which every movement (even the  Scherzo) is in Sonata Form or a modification thereof; on the other  hand, there are compositions, entitled Sonatas, in which not a single  movement is in pure Sonata-Form, _e.g._, Beethoven's Twelfth Sonata,  op. 26. These comments apply equally to many other large instrumental  works. For a symphony is merely a Sonata for Orchestra, a  String-Quartet a composition--of the same general type--for four solo  instruments[93] and there is, furthermore, a large group of ensemble  compositions: Sonatas for Violin (or any solo-instrument) and  Pianoforte; Trios, often for unusual combinations, _e.g._, Brahms's  _Trio for Violin, Horn and Pianoforte_; Quintets and even Septets--in  all of which the distinction must be made between the terms Sonata and  Sonata-Form. Nor is there any rigid rule in regard to number of  movements or the moods expressed therein. The classic Sonata, Symphony  or Quartet, as we have stated above, generally contained three or four  movements, of which the first would be direct and vigorous in  nature--a summons to attention--cast in sonata-form, with a wealth of  material organically treated, and requiring from the listener  concentrated attention. The second movement was generally much simpler  in form, affording relief after the tension of the preceding  movement--its themes of a lyric nature, often with great depth of  emotion, sometimes even of tragic import. The third movement, Minuet  or Scherzo, would portray the light, humorous side of life; and the  Finale, joyful and optimistic--its themes often bearing strongly the  sense of finality--would close the work with a general feeling of  satisfaction. It was Beethoven who first modified these principles to  suit his own poetic needs. Thus we find some of his Sonatas with only  two movements; some have three, some have four. One of Schumann's  Symphonies contains five movements and Rubinstein's _Ocean Symphony_  seven! When we reach the modern school, we shall see further freedom  as to number, order and type of movements.    [Footnote 92: The form is also sometimes used independently, as in  Brahms's _Rhapsody in G minor_ and often, of course, in the Overture.]    [Footnote 93: _I.e._, 1st Violin, 2d Violin, Viola and Violoncello.]    We are now prepared to sum up the essential characteristics of the  Sonata-Form; for there is no structure in which it is more important  for the music-lover to acquire the art of listening easily, naturally  and with a minimum of friction. The Sonata-Form is the instrumental  form \"par excellence\"--the Gothic Cathedral[94] of music--and has  retained its place, not because of any slavish regard for form as  such, but because it has been worked out, perfected and utilized by  the greatest of the composers. Any form with a beginning, a middle and  an ending, _i.e._, presenting material worthy of consideration, which  allows this material to grow and realize its inherent possibilities  and then sums the matter up in a convincing, objective close; which,  furthermore, exemplifies the great principle of Duality, _i.e._,  reveals _two_ musical personalities, has as little need for  argumentative sanction as a tree or a human being. The Sonata-Form--often,  to be sure, with free modifications--predominates in all the large  instrumental compositions of the Classic, Romantic and Modern  Composers, notably of such men as Beethoven, Schumann, Brahms, Cesar  Franck, Tchaikowsky, d'Indy and Sibelius. Anyone unable readily to  follow movements in this form, if he thinks he is receiving the  complete message of the music, is his own dupe. It would be as logical  to expect to enjoy the beauties of architecture without perceiving the  difference between a nave and a bowling-alley. The obvious way to  understand the meaning of a language is to know something of the  principles of structure and expression in that language. Music is in  very truth a language; and far too many people get from it nothing  save the appeal which comes from its emotional power. This exciting  experience is important, we may frankly acknowledge, but there are no  reasons, save apathy and indifference, why the hearer should not have  all this and more too. There is no conflict between warm emotions and  an intelligent, well-trained mind. They should go hand in hand; and in  any complete artistic appreciation each is indispensable.[95]    [Footnote 94: See the eloquent comments on this analogy by d'Indy in  his _Course in Composition_, Vol. II, Chap. 5.]    [Footnote 95: \"Art is not more a riot of the passions than it is a  debauch of the senses; it contains, no doubt, sensuous and emotional  elements, the importance of which there is no need to undervalue, but  it is only artistic if it subordinate them to the paramount claims of  reason.\" W.H. Hadow, _Studies in Modern Music_ (second series),  preface.]    The three main divisions of the Sonata-Form, with their essential  features, are the following: (1) the Exposition, in which two themes  in different tonalities are announced for the consideration--and, as  the composer hopes, the pleasure--of the hearer. In the works of Haydn  and Mozart this contrast of key was invariably that of Tonic and  Dominant, _e.g._, C major and G major, or of major and relative minor,  _e.g._, A-flat major and F minor. Beginning, however, with Beethoven  great emphasis has been laid on _mediant_ relationship, _e.g._, C  major and E major or C major and A-flat major; and in modern  composers[96] this more stimulating change has largely superseded the  former tonic and dominant grouping, _e.g._, Brahms's _Third Symphony_.  We thus see that the harmonic feature of the Exposition is _Duality_  of Key-relationship. Between these two main themes there is always a  modulatory connection or Bridge Passage which, in the time of Haydn,  was generally of a very perfunctory, stereotyped character. Wagner  once sarcastically remarked that Haydn's transitions reminded him of  the clatter of dishes between courses at a royal feast. In Mozart we  find the bridge-passage more deftly planned, more organically  connected with what precedes and follows; but it was Beethoven who, in  this portion of the movement, first revealed its possibilities.  Throughout his works the bridge-passage is never a mere mechanical  modulation or a floundering about until the introduction of the second  theme, but is so conceived that the interest of the hearer is  increasingly aroused until, at the entrance of the second theme, he is  in the highest state of expectancy.[97] A bridge-passage of this kind  often has a subsidiary theme of its own, or even several melodic  phrases, and is planned as carefully as the action by which a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30576"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#19)"],[1,"week and sometime Sunday, iffen de crops in a  rush.

He was       born a slave to John Thomas Boykin, Troupe Co., Georgia, 80 miles       from Lagrange, Ga. His master was a very wealthy plantation owner,       working 1,000 slaves.      \"I been well taken care of durin' my life. When I was young I lived  right in de big house with my marster. I was houseboy. My mother's name  was Betsy Ann Boykin and she was cook for Old Missus. My grandpa was  blacksmith. I slept on a pallet in de kitchen and in winter time on cold  nights I 'members how cold I would get. I'd wake up and slip in by  marsters bed and den I'd say, 'Marster John, I's about to freeze.' He'd  say, 'You ought to freeze, you little black devil. What you standin'  dere for?' I'd say, 'Please, marster John, jes' let me crawl in by your  feet.' He'd say, 'Well, I will dis one time,' and dat's de way I'd do  every cold night.    \"I was full of mischief and I'd tu'n de mules out of de lot, jus' to see  de stableboy git a lickin'. One time I wanted a fiddle a white man named  Cocoanut Harper kep' tryin' to sell me for $7.50. I didn' never have any  money, 'cept a little the missie give me, so I kep' teasin' her to buy  de fiddle for me. She was allus on my side, so she tol' me to take some  co'n from de crib and trade in for de fiddle. In de night I slips out  and hitch up de mules and fetched de co'n to old Harper's house and  traded for dat fiddle. Den I hides out and play it, so's marster wouldn'  fin' out, but he did and he whip all de daylight outta me. When de  missie try to whip me, I jes' wrop up in her big skirts and she never  could hurt me much.    \"I allus ate my meals in de house at de white folks table, after dey  done et. Iffen I couldn' sit in de marster's chair, I'd swell up like a  toad.    \"De marster done all de whippin', 'cause dey had been two overseers  killed on de plantation for whippin' slaves till de blood run out dey  body.    \"Was I bovered with haints and spooks? I been meetin' up with 'em all my  life. When I was younger I was such an old scratch I'd meet 'em right in  de road, some without heads. I'd take to my heels and then I'd stop and  look 'round and they'd be gone.    \"I wore home-weaved shirts till I was grown, then I had some pants and  dey was homemade, too. The women gathered womack leaves to dye de goods  black.    \"I well rec'lects when my marster went to war. He called all us in de  kitchen and telled us he had to go over dere and whip those  sons-of-bitches and would be back 'fore breakfast. He didn' return for  two years. I says, 'Marster, we sho' would have waited breakfast on you  a long time.' He said, 'Yes; deys de hardes' sons-of-bitches to whip I  ever had dealins' with.'    \"When war was over, he called us together and tol' us we were free. He  said, 'Now, I'm goin' to give you a big day and after that you can stay  and work for pay or you can go.' So he rolled out two barrels of whiskey  and killed hogs and spread a big day.    \"I wants to tell you 'bout how we killed hogs in my day. We digged a  deep pit in de groun' and heated big rocks red hot and filled up de pit  with water and dropped dem hot rocks in and got de water hot; den we  stuck de hogs and rolled 'em in dat pit.    \"Soon after I's free a man come for me from Louisville to hire me as  foreman in his cotton mule barn. So I went there and I worked in  Kentucky for 18 year. Fifty-one years ago I married my ol' woman, Rachel  Taylor, at Corsicana, Texas, and I think she's jes' as fine as the day I  married her. We has six chillen and all works hard for a livin' and we  got one lil' grandbaby 10 years ol'. She lives here at our house and  we're educatin' her.    \"I knows I's goin' to live to be over 100 years ol', 'cause my marster  done tol' me so.\"          420073      [Illustration: Monroe Brackins]           MONROE BRACKINS, born in Monroe Co., Mississippi, in 1853, was the       property of George Reedes.
