[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37215"],[0,"The Argus Pheasant (#19)"],[1," paused significantly.    \"It is from his excellency, the Jonkheer Van Schouten,\" Peter Gross  corrected quietly.    Peter Gross's tolerance of this interrogation convinced Van Slyck that  he had to do with an inferior intelligence suddenly elevated to an  important position and very much at sea in it.    \"And your message, I understand, is for Mynheer Muller, the  _controlleur_?\" the captain inquired loftily with a pert uptilt of his  chin.    \"For Mynheer Muller, the _controlleur_,\" Peter Gross acknowledged  gravely.    \"Ah, yes. This is Mynheer Muller.\" He indicated the _controlleur_ with a  flourish. \"But you have not yet told us your name.\"    \"I am Peter Gross.\"    \"Ah, yes, Pieter Gross. Pieter Gross.\" The captain repeated the name  with evident relish. \"Pieter Gross. Mynheer Pieter Gross.\"    There was a subtle emphasis on the _mynheer_--a half-doubtful use of the  word, as though he questioned Peter Gross's right to a gentleman's  designation. It was designed to test the sailor.    Peter Gross's face did not change a muscle. Turning to the  _controlleur_, he asked in a voice of unruffled calm: \"May I speak to  you privately, _mynheer_?\"    Muller glanced apprehensively at Van Slyck. The fears inspired by his  dreams made him more susceptible to ulterior impressions than the  captain, whose naturally more acute sensibilities were blunted by the  preconceived conviction that he had an ignorant Yankee to deal with. Van  Slyck smiled cynically and observed:    \"Am I in the way, Mynheer Gross?\" Again the ironic accent to the  _mynheer_. He rose to go, but Muller stayed him with the cry:    \"_Neen, neen, kapitein._ Whatever comes from the governor concerns you,  too. Stay with us, and we will see what his excellency has to say.\"    None knew the importance of first impressions better than the captain.  If the new resident could be thwarted in his purpose of seeing Muller  alone that achievement would exercise its influence on all their future  relations, Van Slyck perceived.    Assuming an expression of indifference, he sank indolently into an easy  chair. When he looked up he found the gray eyes of Peter Gross fixed  full upon him.    \"Perhaps I should introduce myself further, captain,\" Peter Gross said.  \"I am Mynheer Gross, of Batavia, your new resident by virtue of his  excellency the Jonkheer Van Schouten's appointment.\"    Van Slyck's faint, cynical smile deepened a trifle.    \"Ah, _mynheer_ has been appointed resident,\" he remarked  non-committally.    Peter Gross's face hardened sternly.    \"It is not the custom in Batavia, captain, for officers of the garrison  to be seated while their superiors stand.\"    For a moment the astonished captain lost his usual assurance. In that  moment he unwittingly scrambled to his feet in response to the  commanding look of the gray eyes that stared at him so steadily. The  instant his brain cleared he regretted the action, but another lightning  thought saved him from the folly of defying the resident by reseating  himself in the chair he had vacated. Furious at Peter Gross, furious at  himself, he struggled futilely for an effective reply and failed to find  it. In the end he took refuge in a sullen silence.    Peter Gross turned again to Muller.    \"Here are my credentials, _mynheer_, and a letter from his excellency,  the governor-general,\" he announced simply.    With the words he placed in Muller's hands two envelopes plentifully  decorated with sealing-wax stamped with the great seal of the  Netherlands. The _controlleur_ took them with trembling fingers. Peter  Gross calmly appropriated a chair. As he seated himself he remarked:    \"Gentlemen, you may sit.\"    Van Slyck ignored the permission and strolled to one end of the veranda.  He was thinking deeply, and all the while stole covert looks at Peter  Gross. Had he been mistaken, after all, in his estimate of the man? Was  this apparent guilelessness and simplicity a mask? Were Koyala and  Muller right? Or was the resident's sudden assumption of dignity a petty  vanity finding vent in the display of newly acquired powers?    He stole another look. That face, it was so frank and ingenuous, so free  from cunning and deceit, and so youthful. Its very boyishness persuaded  Van Slyck. Vanity was the inspiration for the resident's sudden  assertion of the prerogatives of his office, he decided, the petty  vanity of a boor eager to demonstrate authority. Confidence restored, he  became keenly alert for a chance to humble this froward Yankee.    It was some time before Muller finished reading the documents. He was  breathing heavily the while, for he felt that he was reading his own  death-warrant. There was no doubting their authenticity, for they were  stamped with the twin lions of the house of Orange and the motto, \"_Je  Maintiendrai_.\" The signature at the bottom of each was the familiar  scrawl of Java's gamecock governor.    Muller stared at them blankly for a long time, as though he half hoped  to find some mitigation of the blow that swept his vast administrative  powers as acting resident from him to the magistracy of a district.  Dropping them on his lap at last with a weary sigh, he remarked:    \"Welcome, Mynheer Gross, to Bulungan. I wish I could say more, but I  cannot. The most I can say is that I am happy his excellency has at last  yielded to my petition and has relieved me of a portion of my duties. It  is a hard, hard residency to govern, _mynheer_.\"    \"A splendid start,\" Van Slyck muttered to himself under his breath.    \"So I have been informed, _mynheer_,\" Peter Gross replied gravely.  \"Pardon me a moment.\"    He turned toward Van Slyck: \"Captain, I have a letter for you also from  his excellency. It will inform you of my appointment.\"    \"It would be better form, perhaps, _mynheer_, for me to receive his  excellency's commands at Fort Wilhelmina,\" Van Slyck replied suavely,  delighted at being able to turn the tables.    \"Very true, very true, _kapitein_, if you insist,\" Peter Gross agreed  quietly. \"I hope to visit you at the fort within the hour. In the mean  time you will excuse Mynheer Muller and me.\"    For the second time a cold chill of doubt seized Van Slyck. Was it  possible that he had misjudged his man? If he had, it was doubly  dangerous to leave Muller alone with him. He resolved to force the  issue.    \"A thousand pardons, _mynheer_,\" he apologized smilingly. \"Mynheer  Muller just now requested me to remain.\"    A swift change came into the face of Peter Gross. His chin shot forward;  in place of the frank simplicity on which Van Slyck had based his  estimate was a look of authority.    \"Mynheer Muller cancels that invitation at my request,\" he announced  sternly.    Van Slyck glanced in quick appeal at his associate, but Muller's eyes  were already lowering under Peter Gross's commanding glance. Unable to  find a straw of excuse for holding the captain, the _controlleur_  stammered:    \"Certainly, _mynheer_. I will see you later, _kapitein_.\"    Even then Van Slyck lingered, afraid now to leave Muller alone. But the  cold, gray eyes of Peter Gross followed him; they expressed a decision  from which there was no appeal. Furious at Muller, furious at his own  impotence, the captain walked slowly across the veranda. Half-way down  the steps he turned with a glare of defiance, but thought better of it.  Raging inwardly, and a prey to the blackest passions, he strode toward  the stockade. The unhappy sentinel at the gate, a Javanese colonial, was  dozing against the brass cannon.    \"Devil take you, is this the way you keep guard?\" Van Slyck roared and  leaped at the man. His sword flashed from its scabbard and he brought  the flat of the blade on the unhappy wretch's head. The Javanese dropped  like a log.    \"Bring that carrion to the guard-house and put some one on the gate that  can keep his eyes open,\" Van Slyck shouted to young Lieutenant Banning,  officer of the day. White to the lips, Banning saluted, and executed the  orders.    In barracks that night the soldiers whispered fearfully to each other  that a _budjang brani_ (evil spirit) had seized their captain again.          CHAPTER XIII    A FEVER ANTIDOTE      \"You have found Bulungan a difficult province to govern, _mynheer_?\"  Peter Gross asked.    The words were spoken in a mild, ingratiating manner. Peter Gross's  voice had the friendly quality that so endeared him to all who made his  acquaintance, and the harshness that had distinguished his curt  dismissal of the supercilious Van Slyck was wholly absent.    Muller wiped away the drops of perspiration that had gathered on his  forehead. A prey to conscience, Van Slyck's dismissal had seemed to him  the beginning of the end.    \"_Ach, mynheer_,\" he faltered, \"it has been a heavy task. Too much for  one man, altogether too much. Since Mynheer de Jonge left here two years  ago I have been both resident and _controlleur_. I have worked night and  day, and the heavy work, and the worry, have made me almost bald.\"    That a connection existed between baldness and overwork was a new theory  to Peter Gross and rather amusing, since he knew the circumstances. But  not the faintest flicker of a smile showed on his face.    \"You have found it difficult, then, I presume, to keep up with all your  work?\" he suggested.    Muller instantly grasped at the straw. \"Not only difficult, _mynheer_,  but wholly impossible,\" he vehemently affirmed. \"My reports are far  behind. I suppose his excellency told you that?\"    He scanned Peter Gross's face anxiously. The latter's serenity remained  undisturbed.    \"His excellency told me very little,\" he replied. \"He suggested that I  consult with you and Captain Van Slyck to get your ideas on what is  needed for bettering conditions here. I trust I will have your  cooperation, _mynheer_?\"    Muller breathed a silent sigh of relief. \"That you will, _mynheer_,\" he  assured fervently. \"I shall be glad to help you all I can. And so will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3725"],[0,"Famous Men of the Middle Ages (#19)"],[1,"there would be no strong force to stop his progress.  However, he was mistaken, for he had not marched forty miles toward  Cairo when he was attacked by a Moslem army led by the sultan of  Egypt.    A great battle was fought. The Crusaders were commanded by King  Louis and throughout the battle showed the utmost bravery, but they  were outnumbered. Thousands were slain and the survivors retreated  toward Damietta.    The Moslems pursued them and the Crusaders were obliged to surrender.  Out of the forty thousand men who had left France only about six  thousand now remained. Many had died of disease as well as in battle.    King Louis was among the prisoners, and the sultan of Egypt agreed  to release him only upon the payment of a large ransom.    When the ransom had been paid a truce was made for ten years between  Louis and the sultan, and the good king left Egypt. He then went  to the Holy Land, and for four years worked to deliver Crusaders  who were in Moslem prisons.    II    During the time that Louis was in the Holy Land his mother ruled  France as regent. When she died he returned immediately to his  kingdom and devoted himself to governing it.    In 1252 he took part in the founding of the Sorbonne, the most  famous theological college of Europe from the days of St. Louis  down to the time of the French Revolution.    [Illustration: THE FOUNDING OF THE SORBONNE]    He ruled his people so wisely and justly that it is hard to find  any better king or even one equally as good in the whole line of  French kings. He never wronged any man himself, or knowingly allowed  any man to be wronged by others.    Near his palace there was a grand oak with wide-spreading branches,  under which he used to sit on pleasant days in summer. There he  received all persons who had complaints to make, rich and poor  alike. Every one who came was allowed to tell his story without  hindrance.    For hours Louis would listen patiently to all the tales of wrong-doing,  of hardships and misery that were told him, and he would do what  he could to right the wrongs of those who suffered.    When news came of some more dreadful persecutions of Christians by  the Moslems in Palestine, Louis again raised an army of Crusaders  and started with them for Tunis, although he was sick and feeble--so  sick, indeed, that he had to be carried on a litter. Upon his arrival  at Tunis he was attacked by fever and died in a few days.    He is better known to the world as Saint Louis than as Louis IX,  because some years after his death Pope Boniface VIII canonized  him on account of his pious life and his efforts to rescue the  Holy Land from the Turks.          ROBERT BRUCE    KING FROM 1306-1329    The most famous king that Scotland ever had was Robert Bruce. He  lived in the days when Edward I, Edward II, and Edward III were  kings of England.    During the reign of Edward I the king of Scotland died and thirteen  men claimed the throne. Instead of fighting to decide which of  them should be king they asked Edward to settle the question. When  he met the Scottish nobles and the rivals, each of whom thought  that next day he would be wearing the crown, Edward told them that  he would himself be their king. Just then an English army marched  up. What could the nobles do but kneel at the feet of Edward and  promise to be his vassals? This they did; and so Scotland became  a part of Edward's kingdom and Ba'li-ol, one of the rivals who  claimed the Scottish throne, was made the vassal king.    Some time after this Edward ordered Baliol to raise an army and  help him fight the French. Baliol refused to do this, so Edward  marched with an army into Scotland and took him prisoner. He was  determined that the Scotch should have no more kings of their own.  So he carried away the sacred stone of Scone (_scoon_), on which  all kings of Scotland had to sit when they were crowned, and put  it in Westminster Abbey in London, and there it is to this day. It  is underneath the chair on which the sovereigns of England always  sit when the crown of England, Scotland, and Ireland is placed upon  their heads. It is said to have been the very stone that Jacob  used for a pillow on the night that he saw, in his dream, angels  ascending and descending on the ladder that reached from earth  to heaven.    Edward now supposed, as he had this sacred stone and had put King  Baliol in prison, that Scotland was conquered.    But the men whom he appointed to govern the Scotch ruled unwisely  and nearly all the people were discontented. Suddenly an army of  Scots was raised. It was led by Sir William Wallace, a knight who  was almost a giant in size. Wallace's men drove the English out  of the country and Wallace was made the \"Guardian of the Realm.\"    Edward then led a great army against him. The Scottish soldiers were  nearly all on foot. Wallace arranged them in hollow squares--spearmen  on the outside, bowmen within. The English horsemen dashed vainly  against the walls of spear-points. But King Edward now brought his  archers to the front. Thousands of arrows flew from their bows  and thousands of Wallace's men fell dead. The spears were broken  and the Scotch were defeated. Wallace barely escaped with his life.  He was afterwards betrayed to Edward, who cruelly put him to death.    II    But the Scotch had learned what they could do and they still went  on fighting for freedom, under two leaders named Robert Bruce and  John Comyn. Edward marched against them with another large army.  He won a great victory, and the nobles once more swore to obey  him.    But in spite of this oath, Bruce meant to free Scotland if he could,  and win the crown. He was privately crowned king of Scotland in  the Abbey of Scone in 1306.    He said to his wife, \"Henceforth you are the queen and I am the  king of our country.\"    \"I fear,\" said his wife, \"that we are only playing at being king  and queen, like children in their games.\"    \"Nay, I shall be king in earnest,\" said Bruce.    The news that Bruce had been crowned roused all Scotland and the  people took up arms to fight under him against the English. But  again King Edward defeated the Scotch and Bruce himself fled to  the Grampian Hills.    For two months he was closely pursued by the English who used  bloodhounds to track him. He and his followers had many narrow  escapes. Once he had to scramble barefoot up some steep rocks,  and another time all the party would have been captured had not  Bruce awakened just in time to hear the approach of the enemy.  He and his men lived by hunting and fishing.    However, many brave patriots joined them, until after a while Bruce  had a small army. Five times he attacked the English, and five  times he was beaten. After his last defeat he fled from Scotland  and took refuge in a wretched hut on an island off the north coast  of Ireland. Here he stayed all alone during one winter.    III    It is said that one day, while he was very down-hearted, he saw  a spider trying to spin a web between two beams of his hut. The  little creature tried to throw a thread from one beam to another,  but failed. Not discouraged, it tried four times more without success.    [Illustration: SCOTS IN THE BATTLE OF BANNOCKBURN]    \"Five times has the spider failed,\" said Bruce. \"That is just the  number of times the English have defeated me. If the spider has  courage to try again, I also will try to free Scotland!\"    He watched the spider. It rested for a while as if to gain strength,  and then threw its slender thread toward the beam. This time it  succeeded.    \"I thank God!\" exclaimed Bruce. \"The spider has taught me a lesson.  No more will I be discouraged.\"    About this time Edward I died and his son, Edward II, succeeded  to the throne of England. For about two years the new king paid  little attention to Scotland.    Meantime Bruce captured nearly all the Scotch castles that were held  by the English, and the nobles and chiefs throughout the country  acknowledged him as their king.    At last Edward II marched into Scotland at the head of a hundred  thousand men. Bruce met him at Bannockburn on June 24, 1314, with  thirty thousand soldiers.    Before the battle began Bruce rode along the front of his army  to encourage his men. Suddenly an English knight, Henry de Bohun,  galloped across the field and tried to strike him down with a spear.  Bruce saw his danger in time and with a quick stroke of his battle-axe  cleft the knight's skull.    The Scotch army shouted again and again at this feat of their commander,  and they went into the battle feeling sure that the victory would  be theirs. They rushed upon the English with fury and although  outnumbered three to one, completely defeated them. Thousands of  the English were slain and a great number captured.    In spite of this terrible blow Edward never gave up his claim to  the Scottish crown. But his son Edward III, in 1328, recognized  Scotland's independence and acknowledged Bruce as her king.          MARCO POLO    LIVED FROM 1254-1324    I    Some years before St. Louis led his last Crusade there was born in  Venice a boy named Marco Polo. His father was a wealthy merchant  who often went on trading journeys to distant lands.    In 1271, when Marco was seventeen years old, he accompanied his  father and uncle on a journey through the Holy Land, Persia and  Tartary, and at length to the Empire of China--then called Ca-thay'.  It took the travelers three years to reach Cathay.    The emperor of Cathay was a monarch named Kublai Khan (_koo' bli-kaen'_),  who lived in Peking.    Marco's father and uncle had been in Cathay once before and had  entertained Kublai Khan by telling him about the manners and customs  of Europe.    So when the two Venetian merchants again appeared in Peking, Kublai  Khan was glad to see them. He was also greatly pleased with the  young Marco, whom he invited to the palace.
