The Sun shining into a dark Chamber through a little round  hole in the Window-shut, and his Light being there refracted by a Prism  to cast his coloured Image PT [in _Fig._ 5.] upon the opposite Wall: I  held a white Paper V to that image in such manner that it might be  illuminated by the colour'd Light reflected from thence, and yet not  intercept any part of that Light in its passage from the Prism to the  Spectrum. And I found that when the Paper was held nearer to any Colour  than to the rest, it appeared of that Colour to which it approached  nearest; but when it was equally or almost equally distant from all the  Colours, so that it might be equally illuminated by them all it appeared  white. And in this last situation of the Paper, if some Colours were  intercepted, the Paper lost its white Colour, and appeared of the Colour  of the rest of the Light which was not intercepted. So then the Paper  was illuminated with Lights of various Colours, namely, red, yellow,  green, blue and violet, and every part of the Light retained its proper  Colour, until it was incident on the Paper, and became reflected thence  to the Eye; so that if it had been either alone (the rest of the Light  being intercepted) or if it had abounded most, and been predominant in  the Light reflected from the Paper, it would have tinged the Paper with  its own Colour; and yet being mixed with the rest of the Colours in a  due proportion, it made the Paper look white, and therefore by a  Composition with the rest produced that Colour. The several parts of the  coloured Light reflected from the Spectrum, whilst they are propagated  from thence through the Air, do perpetually retain their proper Colours,  because wherever they fall upon the Eyes of any Spectator, they make the  several parts of the Spectrum to appear under their proper Colours. They  retain therefore their proper Colours when they fall upon the Paper V,  and so by the confusion and perfect mixture of those Colours compound  the whiteness of the Light reflected from thence.    _Exper._ 10. Let that Spectrum or solar Image PT [in _Fig._ 6.] fall now  upon the Lens MN above four Inches broad, and about six Feet distant  from the Prism ABC and so figured that it may cause the coloured Light  which divergeth from the Prism to converge and meet again at its Focus  G, about six or eight Feet distant from the Lens, and there to fall  perpendicularly upon a white Paper DE. And if you move this Paper to and  fro, you will perceive that near the Lens, as at _de_, the whole solar  Image (suppose at _pt_) will appear upon it intensely coloured after the  manner above-explained, and that by receding from the Lens those Colours  will perpetually come towards one another, and by mixing more and more  dilute one another continually, until at length the Paper come to the  Focus G, where by a perfect mixture they will wholly vanish and be  converted into whiteness, the whole Light appearing now upon the Paper  like a little white Circle. And afterwards by receding farther from the  Lens, the Rays which before converged will now cross one another in the  Focus G, and diverge from thence, and thereby make the Colours to appear  again, but yet in a contrary order; suppose at [Greek: de], where the  red _t_ is now above which before was below, and the violet _p_ is below  which before was above.    Let us now stop the Paper at the Focus G, where the Light appears  totally white and circular, and let us consider its whiteness. I say,  that this is composed of the converging Colours. For if any of those  Colours be intercepted at the Lens, the whiteness will cease and  degenerate into that Colour which ariseth from the composition of the  other Colours which are not intercepted. And then if the intercepted  Colours be let pass and fall upon that compound Colour, they mix with  it, and by their mixture restore the whiteness. So if the violet, blue  and green be intercepted, the remaining yellow, orange and red will  compound upon the Paper an orange, and then if the intercepted Colours  be let pass, they will fall upon this compounded orange, and together  with it decompound a white. So also if the red and violet be  intercepted, the remaining yellow, green and blue, will compound a green  upon the Paper, and then the red and violet being let pass will fall  upon this green, and together with it decompound a white. And that in  this Composition of white the several Rays do not suffer any Change in  their colorific Qualities by acting upon one another, but are only  mixed, and by a mixture of their Colours produce white, may farther  appear by these Arguments.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    If the Paper be placed beyond the Focus G, suppose at [Greek: de], and  then the red Colour at the Lens be alternately intercepted, and let pass  again, the violet Colour on the Paper will not suffer any Change  thereby, as it ought to do if the several sorts of Rays acted upon one  another in the Focus G, where they cross. Neither will the red upon the  Paper be changed by any alternate stopping, and letting pass the violet  which crosseth it.    And if the Paper be placed at the Focus G, and the white round Image at  G be viewed through the Prism HIK, and by the Refraction of that Prism  be translated to the place _rv_, and there appear tinged with various  Colours, namely, the violet at _v_ and red at _r_, and others between,  and then the red Colours at the Lens be often stopp'd and let pass by  turns, the red at _r_ will accordingly disappear, and return as often,  but the violet at _v_ will not thereby suffer any Change. And so by  stopping and letting pass alternately the blue at the Lens, the blue at  _v_ will accordingly disappear and return, without any Change made in  the red at _r_. The red therefore depends on one sort of Rays, and the  blue on another sort, which in the Focus G where they are commix'd, do  not act on one another. And there is the same Reason of the other  Colours.    I considered farther, that when the most refrangible Rays P_p_, and the  least refrangible ones T_t_, are by converging inclined to one another,  the Paper, if held very oblique to those Rays in the Focus G, might  reflect one sort of them more copiously than the other sort, and by that  Means the reflected Light would be tinged in that Focus with the Colour  of the predominant Rays, provided those Rays severally retained their  Colours, or colorific Qualities in the Composition of White made by them  in that Focus. But if they did not retain them in that White, but became  all of them severally endued there with a Disposition to strike the  Sense with the Perception of White, then they could never lose their  Whiteness by such Reflexions. I inclined therefore the Paper to the Rays  very obliquely, as in the second Experiment of this second Part of the  first Book, that the most refrangible Rays, might be more copiously  reflected than the rest, and the Whiteness at Length changed  successively into blue, indigo, and violet. Then I inclined it the  contrary Way, that the least refrangible Rays might be more copious in  the reflected Light than the rest, and the Whiteness turned successively  to yellow, orange, and red.    Lastly, I made an Instrument XY in fashion of a Comb, whose Teeth being  in number sixteen, were about an Inch and a half broad, and the  Intervals of the Teeth about two Inches wide. Then by interposing  successively the Teeth of this Instrument near the Lens, I intercepted  Part of the Colours by the interposed Tooth, whilst the rest of them  went on through the Interval of the Teeth to the Paper DE, and there  painted a round Solar Image. But the Paper I had first placed so, that  the Image might appear white as often as the Comb was taken away; and  then the Comb being as was said interposed, that Whiteness by reason of  the intercepted Part of the Colours at the Lens did always change into  the Colour compounded of those Colours which were not intercepted, and  that Colour was by the Motion of the Comb perpetually varied so, that in  the passing of every Tooth over the Lens all these Colours, red, yellow,  green, blue, and purple, did always succeed one another. I caused  therefore all the Teeth to pass successively over the Lens, and when the  Motion was slow, there appeared a perpetual Succession of the Colours  upon the Paper: But if I so much accelerated the Motion, that the  Colours by reason of their quick Succession could not be distinguished  from one another, the Appearance of the single Colours ceased. There was  no red, no yellow, no green, no blue, nor purple to be seen any longer,  but from a Confusion of them all there arose one uniform white Colour.  Of the Light which now by the Mixture of all the Colours appeared white,  there was no Part really white. One Part was red, another yellow, a  third green, a fourth blue, a fifth purple, and every Part retains its  proper Colour till it strike the Sensorium. If the Impressions follow  one another slowly, so that they may be severally perceived, there is  made a distinct Sensation of all the Colours one after another in a  continual Succession. But if the Impressions follow one another so  quickly, that they cannot be severally perceived, there ariseth out of  them all one common Sensation, which is neither of this Colour alone nor  of that alone, but hath it self indifferently to 'em all, and this is a  Sensation of Whiteness. By the Quickness of the Successions, the  Impressions of the several Colours are confounded in the Sensorium, and  out of that Confusion ariseth a mix'd Sensation. If a burning Coal be  nimbly moved round in a Circle with Gyrations continually repeated, the  whole Circle will appear like Fire; the reason of which is, that the  Sensation of the Coal in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33527"],[0,"Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Western North Atlantic (#19)"],[1,"to Florida. From all accounts, this species appears widely but  sparsely distributed in warm temperate seas.      Stranded Specimens    Adults of this species should be distinguishable by the highly  distinctive contour of the mouth. The teeth, located in the high rise of  the mouth, are oriented slightly backwards.    [Illustration: Figure 83.--A dense-beaked whale in the tank at New York  Aquarium. Note the position of the prominent dorsal fin, just breaking  the surface. The blow of beaked whales is usually small and  inconspicuous and reportedly projects markedly forward from the head.

As they mature, males (middle and top) begin to display  the two arching prominences near the corners of the mouth which give the  characteristic contour to the mouth. The teeth are located in these  prominences and are oriented slightly backwards. (Photos from  _northeastern Florida by W. A. Huck, courtesy of Marineland of Florida_  (top and middle) and by J. G.

Description    North Sea beaked whales reach a length of at least 16.5 feet (5 m). The  body is distinctly spindle-shaped, but apparently more robust near  midbody than that of the dense-beaked whale. The head is characterized  by a pronounced bulge in front of the blowhole, a slightly concave  forehead, and a moderate to long beak. The flippers are relatively long  (one-eighth to one-ninth the body length). The dorsal fin is reportedly  tall and variable in shape from triangular to slightly falcate and is  located just behind the midpoint of the back. The flukes are not notched  but are sometimes quite concave on the rear margin.    Adult North Sea beaked whales are dark charcoal gray on the back with  white spots overall. Young animals are also dark charcoal gray on the  back but are lighter on the belly and are unspotted. The flukes of  adults are dark above and below. Those of young are dark above, lighter  below.      Natural History Notes    North Sea beaked whales are known to feed on squid.      May Be Confused With    North Sea beaked whales are the most northerly species of beaked whales.  No other species is very likely to be encountered in the same area.      Distribution    North Sea beaked whales have been reported in the offshore waters from  the latitude of New England north perhaps to the pack ice. Individuals  are occasionally drawn to the coasts of Newfoundland in summer,  presumably by concentrations of squid, a known food item.      Stranded Specimens    The teeth of North Sea beaked whales are located about midway between  the tip of the snout and the corner of the mouth. Except for this  characteristic and their northerly distribution, however, this species  might easily be confused with any other of the beaked whales species.    [Illustration: Figure 86.--North Sea beaked whales are the most  northerly of the beaked whale species, extending north as far as the  pack ice. They reach at least 16.5 feet (5.0 m) and can be identified on  the beach by the position of the teeth near the middle of the lower jaw.  Little is known of the species at sea. (_Drawing by L. Winn._)]    [Illustration: Figure 87.--A female North Sea beaked whale (16.5 feet  [5.0 m]) stranded in Hjertuika in 1957. (_Photo courtesy of A.  Jonsgard._)]          KILLER WHALE (T)    _Orcinus orca_ (Linnaeus 1758)      Other Common Names    Blackfish (see also pilot whales, p. 91 and 94), sword fish (Canada),  grampus (see p. 96), whitefish (St. Vincent), Espladon (Quebec).      Description    Killer whales are the largest member of the dolphin family. Adult males  reach a length of at least 30 feet (9.1 m) and are robust in form. One  specimen of 31 feet (9.5 m) was recorded for the western North Pacific.  Females are considerably smaller and less stocky. Newborn are  approximately 7-8 feet (2.1-2.4 m) long. Killer whales have large  paddle-shaped flippers.    The most distinctive field character of the species is the dorsal fin.  In adult males it is extremely erect and may be as much as 6 feet (1.8  m) tall. Though the fin of females and immature males is less than 3  feet (0.9 m) tall, it is nonetheless taller even in these animals than  in any other cetacean species and is distinctly falcate and pointed on  the tip.    Killer whales are basically black with an extensive region of white on  the undersides extending from the lower jaw to the anal region with a  branch extending onto the flanks behind the dorsal fin. There is an oval  white patch on the side of the head just above and behind the eye. In  newborn and very young calves, these regions may be tan to lemon yellow  in color. Most animals have a light-gray saddle marking just behind the  dorsal fin. The undersides of the flukes are usually white. Both  all-black and all-white animals have been reported.      Natural History Notes    Killer whales travel in groups of from a few to 25 or 30 individuals,  though herds of 150 have been reported. Males appear polygamous, and  females and young may form groups separate from young bachelors and  bulls.    Killer whales are extremely fast swimmers, capable of reaching top  speeds of 25 knots or more, and have been reported \"porpoising\" and  breaching. Individuals and entire groups have also been reported  \"spy-hopping,\" or \"pitchpoling,\" behaviors which consist of hanging  vertically in the water with the head and much of the body (to just  behind the flippers) exposed above the surface.    Killer whales feed on squid, fishes, sea turtles, seabirds, and marine  mammals.    Controversy still continues over whether or not killer whales pose a  threat to man. Documented attacks of killer whales on boats are rare and  have usually been provoked (i.e., harpooning or attempts to capture).  Only two uncertain instances of attacks in the wild have been reported,  but all divers and mariners should be cautioned that this powerful  animal is perfectly capable of doing tremendous damage and should not be  provoked.      May Be Confused With    Because of its very distinctive dorsal fin, body shape, and coloration,  the killer whale is not likely to be confused with any other whale when  it can be examined at close range or when an adult male is present in  the group. Pods of females and immature animals, however, may be  confused with false killer whales or with grampus. The killer whales may  be distinguished from false killers by the following differences:          KILLER WHALE                  FALSE KILLER WHALE                            BODY SHAPE      Chunky.                         Slender.                            BODY COLOR      Black with white on belly,      All black with some gray on    flank, and head.                belly.                            DORSAL FIN      Very tall and erect in adult    Shorter, slender, strongly    males; tall and slightly back   falcate.    curved in female.                            HEAD SHAPE      Broad, rounded.                 Tapered, slender.                           FLIPPER SHAPE      Paddle-shaped.                  Moderately long with                                    characteristic hump near                                    middle on forward margin.                              LENGTH      To at least 30 feet (9.1 m).    To at least 18 feet (5.5 m).    Furthermore, false killer whales are the only \"blackfish\" which are  known to ride the bow wave of a ship.    Grampus have a tall dorsal fin (15 inches [38.1 cm]) which is very  similar in appearance to that of adult female and juvenile killer  whales. But grampus have much lighter coloration, from slate gray to  nearly all white, and larger animals are covered with numerous  scratches. Upon closer examination they can be further distinguished  from killer whales by a crease in the front of the head dividing the  melon into two distinct sections. Grampus are considerably smaller, to  about 13 feet (4 m) maximum length.      Distribution    In the western North Atlantic killer whales have been reported from the  polar pack ice south to Florida and St. Vincent, Lesser Antilles, and  into the Gulf of Mexico at least as far as Texas, though they are far  more common in the cooler waters from about New Jersey north.  Throughout their range, killer whales seem to prefer coastal areas and  often enter shallow bays, estuaries, and river mouths in search of food.    Migrations of the species are probably closely tied to movements of  their food supply. They annually arrive on the coast of New England with  the tuna. Along the Canadian coasts, where distribution and migrations  have been described in some detail, killer whales appear to move inshore  in spring and summer. Many arrive off the east coast of Newfoundland in  June, the Strait of Belle Isle in June and July, and slightly later  along the Labrador coast and Arctic waters. They are found around the  loose ice in April, presumably feeding on harp seals, _Pagophilus  groenlandicus_, and hooded seals, _Cystophora cristata_, and are  frequent in the St. Lawrence estuary in spring and autumn following the  movements of the white whales. The northward movements in spring also  coincide with migrations of balaenopterine whales, which have also been  reported among the food items.
