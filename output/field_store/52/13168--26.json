R. Jones had not moved.    On the 29th and 30th, General D. H. Hill sent out reconnoitring parties on  the Williamsburg and Charles City roads. On the 30th he received a fair  report of Casey's intrenched camp, and the probable strength and extent of  the line of his skirmishers reaching out his left front to White Oak  Swamp. On the 29th, General Johnston wrote General Whiting, commanding  Smith's division, giving notice of a reconnoissance ordered by General  Hill, cautioning the former that his division should be drawn towards the  right, to be in better position for support of a battle of his right, and  adding,--        \"Who knows but that in the course of the morning Longstreet's scheme      may accomplish itself? If we get into a fight here, you will have to      hurry to help us.\"    The report of General D. H. Hill's reconnoissance of the 30th was  forwarded to head-quarters. I followed it, and found General Johnston  ready to talk over plans for battle. General Huger had reported with three  of his brigades, and was in camp near the outskirts of Richmond on Gillis  Creek. The plan settled upon was that the attack should be made by General  D. H. Hill's division on the Williamsburg road, supported by Longstreet's  division. Huger's division, just out of garrison duty at Norfolk, was to  march between Hill's right and the swamp against the enemy's line of  skirmishers, and move abreast of the battle; G. W. Smith's division, under  Whiting, to march by the Gaines road to Old Tavern, and move abreast of  the battle on its left. The field before Old Tavern was not carefully  covered by the enemy's skirmishers north of Fair Oaks, nor by parties in  observation.    Experience during the discussion of the battle ordered for the 28th caused  me to doubt of effective work from the troops ordered for the left flank,  but the plan seemed so simple that it was thought impossible for any one  to go dangerously wrong; and General Johnston stated that he would be on  that road, the better to receive from his troops along the crest of the  Chickahominy information of movements of the enemy on the farther side of  the river, and to look to the co-operation of the troops on the Nine Miles  road.    To facilitate marches, Huger's division was to have the Charles City road  to the head of White Oak Swamp, file across it and march down its northern  margin; D. H. Hill to have the Williamsburg road to the enemy's front;  Longstreet's division to march by the Nine Miles road and a lateral road  leading across the rear of General Hill on the Williamsburg road; G. W.  Smith by the Gaines road to Old Tavern on the Nine Miles road.    The tactical handling of the battle on the Williamsburg road was left to  my care, as well as the general conduct of affairs south of the York River  Railroad, the latter line being the left of the field to which I had been  assigned, the right wing.    While yet affairs were under consideration, a terrific storm of vivid  lightning, thunderbolts, and rain, as severe as ever known to any climate,  burst upon us, and continued through the night more or less severe. In the  first lull I rode from General Johnston's to my head-quarters, and sent  orders for early march.    For a more comprehensive view of affairs as ordered, it may be well to  explain that General Johnston ordered Smith's division by the Gaines road,  so that, in case of delay of its march, McLaws's division, on that road  and nearer the field of proposed action, could be brought in to the left  of the battle, leaving the place of his division to be occupied by  Smith's, when the latter reached McLaws's vacated line. There was,  therefore, no reason why the orders for march should be misconstrued or  misapplied. I was with General Johnston all of the time that he was  engaged in planning and ordering the battle, heard every word and thought  expressed by him of it, and received his verbal orders; Generals Huger and  Smith his written orders.    General Johnston's order to General Smith was:        \"HEAD-QUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,          \"May 30, 9.15 P.M.        \"MAJOR-GENERAL G. W. SMITH:        \"GENERAL,--If nothing prevents, we will fall upon the enemy in front      of Major-General Hill (who occupies the position on the Williamsburg      road from which your troops moved to the neighborhood of Meadow      Bridge) early in the morning, as early as practicable. The      Chickahominy will be passable only at the bridge, a great advantage to      us. Please be ready to move by the Gaines road, coming as early as      possible to the point at which the road to New Bridge turns off.      Should there be cause for haste, Major-General McLaws, on your      approach, will be ordered to leave his ground for you, that he may      reinforce General Longstreet.              \"Most respectfully your obedient servant,              \"J. E. JOHNSTON.\"[14]    General Johnston's order for General Huger read:        \"HEAD-QUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,          \"May 30, 1862, 8.30 P.M.        \"MAJOR-GENERAL HUGER:        \"GENERAL,--The reports of Major-General D. H. Hill give me the      impression that the enemy is in considerable strength in his front. It      seems to me necessary that we should increase our force also; for that      object I wish to concentrate the troops of your division on the      Charles City road, and to concentrate the troops of Major-General Hill      on the Williamsburg road. To do this it will be necessary for you to      move, as early in the morning as possible, to relieve the brigade of      General Hill's division now on the Charles City road. I have desired      General Hill to send you a guide. The road is the second large one      diverging to the right from the Williamsburg road. The first turns      off near the toll-gate. On reaching your position on the Charles City      road, learn at once the route to the main roads, to Richmond on your      right and left, especially those to the left, and try to find guides.      Be ready, if an action should begin on your left, to fall upon the      enemy's left flank.              \"Most respectfully your obedient servant,              \"J. E. JOHNSTON.        \"P.S.--It is necessary to move very early.\"[15]    The Nine Miles road takes the name from the distance by that road from  Richmond to Seven Pines. The Williamsburg road to the same point was  sometimes called the Seven Miles road, because of the distance by that  road to Seven Pines.    As expressed and repeated in his orders, General Johnston's wish was to  have the battle pitched as early as practicable. When his orders were  issued, he was under the impression that I would be the ranking officer on  the right of the York Railroad, and would give detailed instructions to  govern the later operations of Huger's troops.    Subsequent events seem to call for mention just here that General Smith,  instead of moving the troops by the route assigned them, marched back to  the Nine Miles road near the city, rode to Johnston's head-quarters about  six in the morning, and reported that he was with the division, but not  for the purpose of taking command from General Whiting. As General  Johnston did not care to order him back to his position as commander of  the left wing, he set himself to work to make trouble, complained that my  troops were on the Nine Miles road in the way of his march, and presently  complained that they had left that road and were over on the Williamsburg  road, and induced General Johnston to so far modify the plans as to order  three of my brigades down the Nine Miles road to the New Bridge fork.    The order was sent by Lieutenant Washington, of Johnston's staff, who,  unused to campaigning, failed to notice that he was not riding on my line  of march, and rode into the enemy's lines. This accident gave the enemy  the first warning of approaching danger; it was misleading, however, as it  caused General Keyes to look for the attack by the Nine Miles road.    The storms had flooded the flat lands, and the waters as they fell seemed  weary of the battle of the elements, and inclined to have a good rest on  the soft bed of sand which let them gently down to the substratum of clay;  or it may have been the purpose of kind Providence to so intermix the  upper and lower strata as to interpose serious barriers to the passing of  artillery, and thus break up the battle of men.    My march by the Nine Miles and lateral roads leading across to the  Williamsburg road was interrupted by the flooded grounds about the head of  Gillis Creek. At the same time this creek was bank full, where it found a  channel for its flow into the James. The delay of an hour to construct a  bridge was preferred to the encounter of more serious obstacles along the  narrow lateral road, flooded by the storm. As we were earlier at the  creek, it gave us precedence over Huger's division, which had to cross  after us. The division was prepared with cooked rations, had wagons packed  at six o'clock, and rested in the rear of General Hill's at nine A.M.    Meanwhile, General G. W. Smith's division had marched by the Nine Miles  road and was resting near the fork of the New Bridge road at Old Tavern.  Upon meeting General Huger in the morning, I gave him a succinct account  of General Johnston's plans and wishes; after which he inquired as to the  dates of our commissions, which revealed that he was the ranking officer,  when I suggested that it was only necessary for him to take command and  execute the orders. This he declined. Then it was proposed that he should  send two of his brigades across to join on the right of the column of  attack, while he could remain with his other brigade, which was to relieve  that of General Hill on the Charles City road. Though he expressed himself  satisfied with this, his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38478"],[0,"Narrative of the Circumnavigation of the Globe (#19)"],[1,"of the frightful appearance of these  warriors, when, instead of simulated rage, they were animated by the  ferocity of real warfare with the foe! As soon as symptoms of lassitude  and fatigue began to be visible among the war-dancers they arranged  themselves, at the command of the old chief, Patuoni, on both sides, three  ranks deep, and permitted the strangers to pass from end to end of the  camp. Here we were once more welcomed in genuine New Zealand fashion by  the various chiefs, some of whom endeavoured to strike up a conversation.  Mr. W. Baker, Government interpreter, and Secretary to the Native  Department, who had been desired by Government to attend the _Novara_  staff to the feast, was so kind as to translate.    The first to emerge from the ranks was Paora Tuhaera of Oraki, who spoke  as follows: \"Welcome, O chief from a foreign shore, messenger of a king  and a nation of which we only lately have heard tell! Our English friends  explained to us that your countrymen have long been friends and allies of  the British people, whose Queen is our protectress, and under whose laws  we live in undisturbed tranquillity on our own lands. You are a stranger  among us! You for the first time behold a race whose fathers passed their  lives in ignorance, in war, in the practice of every evil custom. You have  been present at this place and witnessed how we sought once to give vent  to our passions and to scare our enemies. This spectacle you saw in  peace, and no man ventured or even thought of lifting the hand against  you! Yet had you come among us at the period of which I spoke, our arm  would have been raised to inflict the deadly blow upon you, or your hand,  which I have just pressed, would have been striking at me to compass my  destruction! You have seen many lands, many perhaps fairer than this  island of ours; but here there is nothing to injure us or to make us wish  to live in other countries. The laws of England shield us from the hand of  the aggressor, we live happy and at peace, and rejoice to welcome those  who, like you, come to us on a mission of good will!\"    This speech and the two following, the Commodore responded to in English,  in terms of warm cordial thanks, and enlarged on the material and  intellectual progress of the aborigines, all which was duly translated by  Mr. Baker to the Maories.    After this Cruera Patuoni of Awataha, an elder brother of  Tamati-Waka-Neni, advanced and said: \"Welcome! welcome! The young men have  welcomed you, and I, an old man, a friend of the Europeans from the  earliest days in which they planted foot in New Zealand, I also bid you  welcome! What can I say more? You have heard what we were,--you see now  what we are! It needs not that I should add to what has been said by those  who spoke before me. Welcome then to the land of the Maories, friends of  the white man.\"    After several more of the younger chiefs had greeted the Commodore and  staff in the most hearty manner, Hui Haupapa, of colossal stature and  frank expression of countenance, made with his powerful arm a passage for  himself through the compact crowd, placed himself in a somewhat theatrical  position, and began in a loud voice, and in evident excitement,  brandishing his meri-meri as he spoke:--    \"The chiefs of this neighbourhood have welcomed thee. My tribe lives far  from here, but _I_ am here, and I bid thee welcome! Thou hast said we are  happy and live at peace. It is true the laws of our Queen have contributed  to this fortunate state of things. Formerly, war, murder, and spilling of  blood formed our chief occupation. Even now troubles arise, which it is  often difficult to smooth over. Just as thou wert landing we were engaged  reading a letter informing us that a dispute of long standing between the  Ngatiwhatua and the Uriohare threatened to give rise to a war. Were we  still in our old Maori state we should assuredly have had recourse to arms  for its settlement, but the two tribes will remember that the laws do not  permit one family of our Queen's children to make war against another, and  they will therefore restrain their anger in the hope that their  differences may be amicably arranged. But what interest have these things  for you? You came to us in peace and friendliness, take with you the love  of the entire assembly, which is proud of having been visited by an  officer of the great king, who is a friend of Queen Victoria and her  children.\"    The natives, who were standing closely packed on either side, and listened  in breathless silence, expressed their acquiescence by head and hand at  the end of each oration. The manner in which they are accustomed to  express themselves at these assemblies is quite unique. The speaker plants  himself at a distance of about ten steps from his audience, whom he  gradually approaches in his speech till within three feet, when he turns  round in silence, resumes his former distance, and begins anew. This  custom has several advantages; it gives the orator time to collect his  thoughts, while his eloquence has time to sink into the heart of his  hearers. Each speaker advances his opinions and sentiments with singular  calmness and dignity. Only at certain \"points,\" which seem to him to be of  importance, does the orator throw up his right hand, while on his left  arm, hanging by his side, lies his stone club, without which no chief  would think of addressing a meeting.    During these speeches we had drawn near the groups surrounding us. The  majority were dressed in European clothes, the chiefs usually wearing a  black cap with gold band, the rest in the most various costumes,  apparently as accident or caprice had dictated their choice. The old men  were tattooed more or less, according to their rank, strongly contrasting  with their European habiliments. The elder women, except that they were  bare-footed, were mostly clad in European dress, some even in elegant  silks and muslins, and had their lips and chins tattooed, whereas the  young folk of both sexes no longer followed that custom, and hence we  frequently had occasion to remark exceedingly agreeable features. Only a  very small number of aborigines seemed to be contented with their own  national dress, and wore either the universal blanket, or else the Cacahu,  a handsome kind of cloak, very artistically made by the Maori women from  the fibres of the New Zealand flax. All had the flaps of their ears  pierced, and a piece of oval-shaped rock passed through the orifice, or  were adorned with shark's teeth, which are usually made fast to a narrow  black silk ribbon. As we inspected some of these groups, and especially  were admiring their splendid figures, we came upon two individuals who had  hid their heads under their blankets, and were weeping bitterly. To our  inquiry as to the cause of their uncontrollable grief amid such a festive  gathering, we were told that they were two relatives who had long been  separated, and were thus celebrating their meeting again. Friends and  relations usually express their joy at seeing each other again by sitting  for hours together, according to their friendship or esteem, rubbing noses  and sobbing bitterly, and weeping over each other the while! If unobserved  this will go on with uncovered head; otherwise they will draw a blanket  over themselves. Kissing and hand-shaking have only become a fashion among  the New Zealanders since their more intimate intercourse with Europeans.    As we withdrew from this singular never-to-be-forgotten people's festival,  and were on our way to our boats, the entire merry multitude assembled on  the slope in front of the tents, and to show, it may be supposed, that  they were not unacquainted with the usages of other countries, gave, with  genuine English good-will, three rousing hurrahs in honour of the  departing guests!    The study of the language and history of the traditions, habits, and  morals of the aborigines of New Zealand, must necessarily be of special  interest on account of our presumed acquaintance with the race they are  descended from, and the important conclusions thence deducible as to the  settlement of Polynesia at large.    A Maori legend relates that their first progenitors came in seven canoes  from the island of Hawaiki (i. e. cradle of the race), one of the Sandwich  Islands, 4000 miles to the N.E. of New Zealand.[30] These canoes had  outriggers to prevent foundering, and were called Amatiatia, whereas those  they now use, which are also of very simple construction, are named Wakka,  and have evidently borrowed their form from the dried seed of the New  Zealand honey-suckle (_Rewarewa_). The first canoe that came from Hawaiki  was named Arawa. It brought over Honmaitawiti, Tamakekapua, Toi, Maka,  Hei, Jhenga, Tauninihi, Rongokako, and others, and these were the first  settlers from whom the New Zealanders are descended.    One of the earlier authors respecting these isles of the Antipodes,  Richard Taylor, the missionary, relates that in 1840 there was living in  the village of Para-para, on the road from Kaitaia to Doubtless Bay, an  aged New Zealand chief named Hahakai, who was thoroughly conversant with  the history of his native land, and used to enumerate twenty-six  generations since the first arrival on the island of the ancestors of his  tribe. Taylor is of opinion, however, that a number of these generations  must be considered as divinities, and that hardly more than fifteen  generations or five hundred years can have elapsed since the first  vagrants from the north settled in New Zealand.[31] At that period they  knew neither the custom of Taboo (the sanctity and inviolability of all  things) nor cannibalism, both of which customs they first began to  practise in their adopted country. As the aborigines before the arrival of  the Europeans possessed no written language, these traditions were usually  handed down from father to son, while one or more"]]]
