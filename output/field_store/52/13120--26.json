But if the  progeny are not so bright as required, and the ground colour not glowing  enough, then, when the young arrive at maturity, mate with a dark-yellow  red tabby either male or female.    Very beautiful brown tabbies are also to be found among the litters of  the female tortoiseshell, allied with a dark-brown tabby with narrow  black bars. It is a cross that may be tried with advantage for both  variety and richness of colour, among which it will not be found  difficult to find something worthy of notice.      WHITE.    Of English, or short-haired cats, the best white are those from a  tortoiseshell mother, and as often some of the best blacks. These whites  are generally of soft yellow, or sandy tint of white. Although they have  pink noses, as also are the cushions of their feet, they are not  Albinos, not having the peculiar pink or red eyes, nor are they  deficient in sight. I have seen and examined with much care some  hundreds of white cats, but have never yet seen one with pink eyes,  though it has been asserted that such exist, and there is no reason why  they should not. Still, I am inclined to think they do not, and the pale  blue eyes, or the red tinted blue, like those of the Siamese, take the  place of it in the feline race; neither have I ever seen a white horse  with pink eyes, but I find it mentioned in one of the daily papers that  among other presents to the Emperor of Russia, the Bokhara Embassy took  with them ten thoroughbred saddle-horses of different breeds, one of  them being a magnificent animal--a pure white stallion with _blue eyes_.    The cold gray-white is the opposite of the black, and this knowledge  should not be lost sight of in mating. It generally has yellow or light  orange eyes. This colour, in a male, may be crossed with the  yellow-white with advantage, when more strength of constitution is  required; but otherwise I deem the best matching is that of two  yellow-white, both with blue eyes, for soft hair, elegance, and beauty;  but even a black male and a white female produce whites, and sometimes  blacks, but the former are generally of a coarse description, and harsh  in coat by comparison. I think the blue-eyed white are a distinct breed  from the common ordinary white cat, nor do I remember any such being  bred from those with eyes of yellow colour.      ABYSSINIAN.    To breed these true, it is well to procure imported or pedigree stock,  for many cats are bred in England from ordinary tabbies, that so nearly  resemble Abyssinian in colour as scarcely to be distinguished from the  much-prized foreigners. The males are generally of a darker colour than  the females, and are mostly marked with dark-brown bands on the  forehead, a black band along the back which ends at the tip of the tail,  with which it is annulated. The ticking should be of the truest kind,  each hair being of three distinct colours, blue, yellow, or red, and  black at the points, the cushions of the feet black, and back of the  hind-legs. Choose a female, with either more red or yellow, the markings  being the same, and, with care in the selection, there will be some very  brilliant specimens. Eyes bright orange-yellow.      ABYSSINIAN CROSSES.    Curiously coloured as the Abyssinian cat is, and being a true breed, no  doubt of long far back ancestry, it is most useful in crossing with  other varieties, even with the Persian, Russian, Angora, or the  Archangel, the ticking hues being easy of transmission, and is then  capable of charming and delightful tints, with breadths of beautiful  mottled or grizzled colouring, if judiciously mated. The light tabby  Persian, matched with a female Abyssinian, would give unexpected  surprises, so with the dark blue Archangel; a well-ticked blue would not  only be a novelty, but an elegant colour hitherto unseen. A deep red  tabby might result in a whole colour, bright red, or a yellow tint. I  have seen a cat nearly black ticked with white, which had yellow eyes.  It was truly a splendid and very beautiful animal, of a most _recherche_  colour. Matched with a silver-gray tabby, a silver-gray tick is  generally the sequence. A yellow-white will possibly prove excellent.  Try it!      WHITE AND BLACK.    For white and black choose evenly marked animals, in which white  predominates. I have seen three differently bred cats, white, with black  ears and tails, all else being white, and been informed of others. I  failed to notice the colour of the eyes which came under my own  observation, for which I am sorry, for much depends on the colour of the  eyes in selection; for though the parents are white and black, many gray  and white, tabby and white, even yellow and white will appear among the  kittens, gray being the original colour, and black the sport.      BLACK AND WHITE.    A deep brown, dense black ground, with a blaze up the face, white nose  and lips, should be chosen--white chest and white feet. Get a female as  nearly as possible so marked, and being a dense blue-black, both with  orange eyes, when satisfactorily marked, and sable and white kittens may  be expected.      BLUE TABBY.    A slate colour, or a blue male cat, mated with a strongly black-marked,  though narrow-banded blue or gray tabby, is the best for dark blue  tabbies, or a light-gray, evenly-marked female may be used. What a  lovely thing a white cat, marked with black stripes, would be! It may be  got.      SPOTTED TABBY.    For spotted tabby the best brown are those got by mating a spotted red  tabby, the darker the better, and a brown and black spotted female.  These should be carefully selected, not only for their ground colour,  but also for the roundness, distinctness, blackness, and arrangements of  their spots.    For grays, blues, and light ash-coloured tabbies, the same care should  be exercised, the only difference being the choice of ground colours.      FANCY COLOURS.    By other odd and fanciful combinations, many beautiful mottles and  stripes may be secured, and strange, quaint, harmonious arrangements of  lines and spots produced according to \"fancy's dictates;\" but the  foregoing are the chief colours in request for exhibition purposes, and  most of the colour marking. In any other colour classes, the beauties,  whatever they may be, are chiefly the result of accident or sports,  selected for such beauty, or in other ways equally interesting.    [Illustration]      [Illustration]          CAT AND KITTENS.      Care and attention is necessary when the cat is likely to become a  mother. A basket or box, half filled with sweet hay, or clean oat straw,  with some flannel in the winter, is absolutely requisite, and a quiet  nook or corner selected away from light, noise, and intrusion. Some  prefer a box made like a rabbit-hutch, with sleeping place, and a barred  door to one or both compartments which may be closed when thought  necessary for comfort and quiet. The cat should be placed within, with  food and new milk by or inside, and there be regularly fed for a few  days, all pans and plates to be kept well washed, and only as much food  given at a time as can be eaten at one meal, so that everything is clean  and fresh. Cats, as I have before stated, delight in cleanliness,  therefore this, nor any comfort, should not be forgotten or omitted, for  so much depends on her health and the growth of her little family, with  regard to their future well-being.    The cat brings forth three times a year, and often more. The time of  gestation is to sixty-three days, and the number of the kittens varies  much. Some will have five to six at a birth, while others _never_ have  more than two or three. I had a blue tabby, \"The Old Lady,\" which never  had more than _one_. The cat, however, is a very prolific animal, and,  if of long life, produces a very numerous progeny. _The Derby Gazette_,  December 10th, 1886, states:--\"There is a cat at Cromford, the age of  which is nineteen years. It belonged to the late Mr. Isaac Orme, who  died a few months ago. The old man made an entry of all the kittens the  cat had given birth to, which, up to the time of his death, numbered  120. It has now just given birth to _one_ more. It will not leave the  house where the old man died, except to visit a neighbouring house,  where there is a harmonium; and when the instrument is being played, the  cat will go and stand on its hind-legs beside the player.\"    Cats live to various ages, the oldest I have seen being twenty-one  years, and the foregoing is the greatest age at which I have known one  to breed. But I am indebted to Mrs. Paterson, of Tunbridge Wells, for  the information that Mr. Sandal had a cat that lived to the  extraordinary age of twenty-four years. I have seen Mr. Sandal, and  found that such was the case. It was a short-haired cat, and rather  above the usual size, and tabby in colour.    When littered, the kittens are weak, blind, deaf, helpless little  things, and it appears almost impossible they can ever attain the supple  grace and elegance of form and motion so much admired in the  fully-developed cat.    The state of visual darkness continues until the eighth or ninth day,  during which the eyesight is gradually developing. After this they grow  rapidly, and, at the age of a few weeks, the gamboling, frolicsome life  of \"kittenhood\" begins, and they begin to feed, lap milk, if slightly  warm, when placed in front of them.    No animal is more fond and attentive than the cat; she is the most  tender and gentle of nurses, watching closely every movement of her  young. With the utmost solicitude she brings the choicest morsels of her  own food, which she lays before them, softly purring, while with gentle  and motherly ways she attracts them to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35470"],[0,"Key to the Science of Theology (#19)"],[1,", and re-entered his fleshly tabernacle,  then the Saints who had obeyed the Gospel while in the flesh, and had  slept in death, or finished their sojourn in the spirit world, were  called forth to re-enter their bodies, and to ascend with him to  mansions and thrones of eternal power, while the residue of the  spirits remained in the world of spirits to await another call.    Those who obeyed the Gospel on the earth, after this first  resurrection, will also be called from their sojourn in the spirit  world, and re-united with their tabernacles of flesh, at the sounding  of the next trump, and will reign on the earth in the flesh, one  thousand years, while those who rejected the Gospel will remain in the  spirit world without a resurrection, till after the thousand years.    Again, those who obey the Gospel in the present age will rise from the  spirit world, and from the grave, and reign on the earth during the  great thousand years; while those who reject it will remain in  condemnation in the spirit world, without a resurrection, till the  last trump shall sound, and death and hell deliver up their dead.          CHAPTER XV.    RESURRECTION, ITS TIMES AND DEGREES--FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD HEAVENS,  OR THE TELESTIAL, TERRESTRIAL AND CELESTIAL KINGDOMS.          The grave and death and hell no more retain      Their lawful captives. Earth yields its slain.      The raging ocean, from its lowly bed,      At Michael's call, delivers up its dead.      Then comes the judgment, and the final doom      Of man--his destiny beyond the tomb.    There are three general resurrections revealed to man on the earth;  one of these is past, and the other two are future.    The first general resurrection took place in connexion with the  resurrection of Jesus Christ. This included the Saints and Prophets of  both hemispheres, from Adam down to John the Baptist; or, in other  words, all those who died in Christ before his resurrection.    The second will take place in a few years from the present time, and  will be immediately succeeded by the coming of Jesus Christ, in power  and great glory, with all his Saints and Angels. This resurrection  will include the Former and Latter-day Saints--all those who have  received the Gospel since the former resurrection.    The third and last resurrection will take place more than a thousand  years afterwards, and will embrace all the human family not included  in the former resurrections or translations.    After man is raised from the dead he will be judged according to his  works, and will receive the reward, and be consigned to the sphere,  exactly corresponding to his former deeds, and the preparations or  qualifications which he possesses.    In the former resurrection, those raised left the earth and ascended,  or, were transplanted far on high, with the risen Jesus, to the  glorified mansions of his Father, or to some planetary system already  redeemed and glorified. The reasons for thus leaving the earth are  obvious. Our planet was still in its rudimental state, and therefore  subject to the rule of sin and death. It was necessary that it should  continue thus, until the full time of redemption should arrive; it  was, therefore, entirely unfitted for the residence of immortal man.    But in the resurrection which now approaches, and in connexion with  the glorious coming of Jesus Christ, the earth will undergo a change  in its physical features, climate, soil, productions; and in its  political, moral, and spiritual government.    Its mountains will be levelled, its valleys exalted, its swamps and  sickly places will be drained and become healthy, while its burning  deserts, and its frigid polar regions, will be redeemed and become  temperate and fruitful.    Kingcraft and priestcraft, tyranny, oppression and idolatry will be at  an end, darkness and ignorance will pass away, war will cease, and the  rule of sin, and sorrow, and death will give place to the reign of  peace, and truth, and righteousness.    For this reason, and to fulfil certain promises made to the Fathers,  the Former and Latter-day Saints included in the two resurrections,  and all those translated, will then receive an inheritance on the  earth, and will build upon and improve the same for a thousand years.    The heathen nations, also, will then be redeemed, and will be exalted  to the privilege of serving the Saints of the Most High. They will be  the ploughmen, the vine-dressers, the gardeners, builders, etc. But  the Saints will be the owners of the soil, the proprietors of all real  estate, and other precious things; and the kings, governors, and  judges of the earth.    As the children of man multiply in those peaceful times, a careful and  wise system of agriculture will be rapidly developed, and extended  over the face of the whole earth; its entire surface will at length  become like the garden of Eden, the trees of life being cultivated,  and their fruits enjoyed.    Science, and the useful and ornamental arts, will also be greatly  extended and cultivated. The fine toned instrument of many strings,  the melodious organs of the human voice, will then be tuned to poetry  and sentiments equally pure and refined, and will pour forth melodies  and strains of holy joy, calculated to purify and melt every heart in  love, and fill every soul with mutual sympathy and extasy of heavenly  union.    Geographical knowledge, history, astronomy, mathematics and  navigation, will be greatly extended and matured. Railroads and  telegraphic lines of communication, will be universally extended, and  the powers of steam, or other means of locomotion brought to the  highest state of perfection.    Thus all nations will be associated in one great brotherhood. A  universal Theocracy will cement the whole body politic. One king will  rule. One holy city will compose the capitol. One temple will be the  centre of worship. In short, there will be one Lord, one Faith, one  Baptism, and one Spirit.    One equable, just and useful commercial interest, founded on the  necessity and convenience of mutual exchange of products, will also  form another important bond of union.    Mineralogy will also be greatly improved, and its knowledge extended.  Its hidden treasures will be developed, and gold, silver and the most  precious and beautiful stones will be the building materials in most  common use, and will compose the utensils and furniture of the  habitations of man.    The earth and man thus restored and exalted, will not yet be perfect  in the celestial sense of the word, but will be considered, in the  light of eternity, as occupying an intermediate and still progressive  position amid the varieties of nature.    The flesh, bones, sinews, nerves--all the organs--all the particles of  the celestial body, must be quickened, filled, surrounded with that  divine and holy element, which is purer, more intelligent, more  refined and active, fuller of light and life, than any other substance  in the universe.    Every organ must be restored, and adapted to its natural and perfect  use in the celestial body.        The Greek Philosopher's immortal mind,      Again with flesh and bone and nerve combined;      Immortal brain and heart--immortal whole,      Will make, as at the first, a living soul.    Man, thus adapted to all the enjoyments of life and love, will possess  the means of gratifying his organs of sight, hearing, taste, &c., and  will possess, improve and enjoy the riches of the eternal elements.  The palace, the city, the garden, the vineyard, the fruits of the  earth, the gold, the silver, the precious stones, the servants, the  chariots, horses and horsemen are for his use; also thrones and  dominions, principalities and powers, might, majesty, and an eternal  increase of riches, honours, immortality and eternal life are his. He  is, in a subordinate sense, a god; or, in other words, one of the sons  of God. All things are his, and he is Christ's, and Christ is God's.    Such is the great Millennium.    And such is _celestial_ man, in his progress towards perfection.    Besides the peculiar glory of the _celestial_, there are in the  resurrection and final reward of man, many subordinate spheres, many  degrees of reward adapted to an almost infinite variety of  circumstances, conditions, degrees of improvement, knowledge,  accountability and conduct.    The final state of man, though varying in almost infinite gradations  and rewards, adapted to his qualifications and deserts, and meted out  in the scale of exact justice and mercy, may be conceived or expressed  under three grand heads, or principal spheres, viz.--    First. The Telestial, or least heaven, typified by the stars of the  firmament.    Secondly. The Terrestrial, or intermediate heaven, typified by the  moon.    Thirdly. The Celestial, or third heaven, of which the sun of the  firmament is typical.    The qualifications which fit and prepare intelligences, for these  different spheres or rewards, are an all important consideration, and  well worthy of the sincere attention of all people.    These several kingdoms or degrees, and their comparative happiness,  and what characters are candidates for each degree, are revealed in a  most concise, clear, lucid and beautiful manner, in one of the visions  of our great Prophet and founder. We will therefore complete this  chapter by the insertion of said                                \"VISION.    \"Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, and rejoice, ye  inhabitants thereof, for the Lord is God, and beside him there is no  Saviour: great is His wisdom, marvellous are His ways, and the extent  of His doings none can find out; His purposes fail not, neither are  there any who can stay His hand; from eternity to eternity He is the  same, and His years never fail.    \"For thus saith the Lord, I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto  those who fear me, and delight to honour those who serve me in  righteousness"]]]
