There was a long row of them in the  orchard, with a Lombardy poplar at either end, and a hedge of lilacs  behind. When the wind blew over them all the spicy breezes of Ceylon's  isle were never sweeter.    It was a time of wonder and marvel, of the soft touch of silver rain on  greening fields, of the incredible delicacy of young leaves, of blossom  in field and garden and wood. The whole world bloomed in a flush and  tremor of maiden loveliness, instinct with all the evasive, fleeting  charm of spring and girlhood and young morning. We felt and enjoyed it  all without understanding or analyzing it. It was enough to be glad and  young with spring on the golden road.    \"I don't like excitement very much,\" said Cecily. \"It makes one so  tired. I'm sure it was exciting enough when Paddy was missing, but we  didn't find that very pleasant.\"    \"No, but it was interesting,\" returned the Story Girl thoughtfully.  \"After all, I believe I'd rather be miserable than dull.\"    \"I wouldn't then,\" said Felicity decidedly. \"And you need never be dull  when you have work to do. 'Satan finds some mischief still for idle  hands to do!'\"    \"Well, mischief is interesting,\" laughed the Story Girl. \"And I thought  you didn't think it lady-like to speak of that person, Felicity?\"    \"It's all right if you call him by his polite name,\" said Felicity  stiffly.    \"Why does the Lombardy poplar hold its branches straight up in the  air like that, when all the other poplars hold theirs out or hang them  down?\" interjected Peter, who had been gazing intently at the slender  spire showing darkly against the fine blue eastern sky.    \"Because it grows that way,\" said Felicity.    \"Oh I know a story about that,\" cried the Story Girl. \"Once upon a time  an old man found the pot of gold at the rainbow's end. There IS a pot  there, it is said, but it is very hard to find because you can never get  to the rainbow's end before it vanishes from your sight. But this old  man found it, just at sunset, when Iris, the guardian of the rainbow  gold, happened to be absent. As he was a long way from home, and the pot  was very big and heavy, he decided to hide it until morning and then get  one of his sons to go with him and help him carry it. So he hid it under  the boughs of the sleeping poplar tree.    \"When Iris came back she missed the pot of gold and of course she was in  a sad way about it. She sent Mercury, the messenger of the gods, to  look for it, for she didn't dare leave the rainbow again, lest somebody  should run off with that too. Mercury asked all the trees if they had  seen the pot of gold, and the elm, oak and pine pointed to the poplar  and said,    \"'The poplar can tell you where it is.'    \"'How can I tell you where it is?' cried the poplar, and she held up all  her branches in surprise, just as we hold up our hands--and down tumbled  the pot of gold. The poplar was amazed and indignant, for she was a very  honest tree. She stretched her boughs high above her head and declared  that she would always hold them like that, so that nobody could hide  stolen gold under them again. And she taught all the little poplars she  knew to stand the same way, and that is why Lombardy poplars always do.  But the aspen poplar leaves are always shaking, even on the very calmest  day. And do you know why?\"    And then she told us the old legend that the cross on which the Saviour  of the world suffered was made of aspen poplar wood and so never again  could its poor, shaken, shivering leaves know rest or peace. There was  an aspen in the orchard, the very embodiment of youth and spring in its  litheness and symmetry. Its little leaves were hanging tremulously, not  yet so fully blown as to hide its development of bough and twig, making  poetry against the spiritual tints of a spring sunset.    \"It does look sad,\" said Peter, \"but it is a pretty tree, and it wasn't  its fault.\"    \"There's a heavy dew and it's time we stopped talking nonsense and went  in,\" decreed Felicity. \"If we don't we'll all have a cold, and then  we'll be miserable enough, but it won't be very exciting.\"    \"All the same, I wish something exciting would happen,\" finished the  Story Girl, as we walked up through the orchard, peopled with its  nun-like shadows.    \"There's a new moon tonight, so may be you'll get your wish,\" said  Peter. \"My Aunt Jane didn't believe there was anything in the moon  business, but you never can tell.\"    The Story Girl did get her wish. Something happened the very next day.  She joined us in the afternoon with a quite indescribable expression  on her face, compounded of triumph, anticipation, and regret. Her  eyes betrayed that she had been crying, but in them shone a chastened  exultation. Whatever the Story Girl mourned over it was evident she was  not without hope.    \"I have some news to tell you,\" she said importantly. \"Can you guess  what it is?\"    We couldn't and wouldn't try.    \"Tell us right off,\" implored Felix. \"You look as if it was something  tremendous.\"    \"So it is. Listen--Aunt Olivia is going to be married.\"    We stared in blank amazement. Peg Bowen's hint had faded from our minds  and we had never put much faith in it.    \"Aunt Olivia! I don't believe it,\" cried Felicity flatly. \"Who told  you?\"    \"Aunt Olivia herself. So it is perfectly true. I'm awfully sorry in one  way--but oh, won't it be splendid to have a real wedding in the family?  She's going to have a big wedding--and I am to be bridesmaid.\"    \"I shouldn't think you were old enough to be a bridesmaid,\" said  Felicity sharply.    \"I'm nearly fifteen. Anyway, Aunt Olivia says I have to be.\"    \"Who's she going to marry?\" asked Cecily, gathering herself together  after the shock, and finding that the world was going on just the same.    \"His name is Dr. Seton and he is a Halifax man. She met him when she  was at Uncle Edward's last summer. They've been engaged ever since. The  wedding is to be the third week in June.\"    \"And our school concert comes off the next week,\" complained Felicity.  \"Why do things always come together like that? And what are you going to  do if Aunt Olivia is going away?\"    \"I'm coming to live at your house,\" answered the Story Girl rather  timidly. She did not know how Felicity might like that. But Felicity  took it rather well.    \"You've been here most of the time anyhow, so it'll just be that you'll  sleep and eat here, too. But what's to become of Uncle Roger?\"    \"Aunt Olivia says he'll have to get married, too. But Uncle Roger says  he'd rather hire a housekeeper than marry one, because in the first case  he could turn her off if he didn't like her, but in the second case he  couldn't.\"    \"There'll be a lot of cooking to do for the wedding,\" reflected Felicity  in a tone of satisfaction.    \"I s'pose Aunt Olivia will want some rusks made. I hope she has plenty  of tooth-powder laid in,\" said Dan.    \"It's a pity you don't use some of that tooth-powder you're so fond of  talking about yourself,\" retorted Felicity. \"When anyone has a mouth the  size of yours the teeth show so plain.\"    \"I brush my teeth every Sunday,\" asseverated Dan.    \"Every Sunday! You ought to brush them every DAY.\"    \"Did anyone ever hear such nonsense?\" demanded Dan sincerely.    \"Well, you know, it really does say so in the Family Guide,\" said Cecily  quietly.    \"Then the Family Guide people must have lots more spare time than I  have,\" retorted Dan contemptuously.    \"Just think, the Story Girl will have her name in the papers if she's  bridesmaid,\" marvelled Sara Ray.    \"In the Halifax papers, too,\" added Felix, \"since Dr. Seton is a Halifax  man. What is his first name?\"    \"Robert.\"    \"And will we have to call him Uncle Robert?\"    \"Not until he's married to her. Then we will, of course.\"    \"I hope your Aunt Olivia won't disappear before the ceremony,\" remarked  Sara Ray, who was surreptitiously reading \"The Vanquished Bride,\" by  Valeria H. Montague in the Family Guide.    \"I hope Dr. Seton won't fail to show up, like your cousin Rachel Ward's  beau,\" said Peter.    \"That makes me think of another story I read the other day about  Great-uncle Andrew King and Aunt Georgina,\" laughed the Story Girl. \"It  happened eighty years ago. It was a very stormy winter and the roads  were bad. Uncle Andrew lived in Carlisle, and Aunt Georgina--she was  Miss Georgina Matheson then--lived away up west, so he couldn't get to  see her very often. They agreed to be married that winter, but Georgina  couldn't set the day exactly because her brother, who lived in Ontario,  was coming home for a visit, and she wanted to be married while he was  home. So it was arranged that she was to write Uncle Andrew and tell him  what day to come. She did, and she told him to come on a Tuesday. But  her writing wasn't very good and poor Uncle Andrew thought she wrote  Thursday. So on Thursday he drove all the way to Georgina's home to be  married. It was forty miles and a bitter cold day. But it wasn't any  colder than the reception he got from Georgina. She was out in the  porch, with her head tied up in a towel, picking geese. She had been  all ready Tuesday, and her friends and the minister were there, and the  wedding supper prepared. But there was no bridegroom and Georgina was  furious. Nothing Uncle Andrew could say would appease her. She wouldn't  listen to a word of explanation, but told him to go, and never show his  nose there again. So poor Uncle Andrew had to go ruefully home, hoping  that she would relent later on, because he was really very much in love  with her.\"    \"And did she?\" queried Felicity.    \"She did. Thirteen years exactly from that day they were married. It  took her just that long to forgive him.\"    \"It took her just that long to find out she couldn't get anybody else,\"  said Dan,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3163"],[0,"Birds and Bees, Sharp Eyes, and Other Papers (#19)"],[1,"only out of the corner of my eye and yet bagged him, because I  had already made him my own.    Nevertheless, the habit of observation is the habit of clear and  decisive gazing. Not by a first casual glance, but by a steady  deliberate aim of the eye are the rare and characteristic things  discovered. You must look intently and hold your eye firmly to the spot,  to see more than do the rank and file of mankind. The sharp-shooter  picks out his man and knows him with fatal certainty from a stump, or a  rock, or a cap on a pole. The phrenologists do well to locate, not only  form, color, and weight, in the region of the eye, but also a faculty  which they call individuality--that which separates, discriminates, and  sees in every object its essential character. This is just as necessary  to the naturalist as to the artist or the poet. The sharp eye notes  specific points and differences,--it seizes upon and preserves the  individuality of the thing. Persons frequently describe to me some bird  they have seen or heard and ask me to name it, but in most cases the  bird might be any one of a dozen, or else it is totally unlike any bird  found in this continent. They have either seen falsely or else vaguely.  Not so the farm youth who wrote me one winter day that he had seen a  single pair of strange birds, which he describes as follows: \"They were  about the size of the 'chippie,' the tops of their heads were red, and  the breast of the male was of the same color, while that of the female  was much lighter; their rumps were also faintly tinged with red. If I  have described them so that you would know them, please write me their  names.\" There can be little doubt but the young observer had seen a pair  of red-polls,--a bird related to the goldfinch, and that occasionally  comes down to us in the winter from the far north. Another time,  the same youth wrote that he had seen a strange bird, the color of  a sparrow, that alighted on fences and buildings as well as upon  the ground, and that walked. This last fact shoved the youth's  discriminating eye and settled the case. I knew it to be a species of  the lark, and from the size, color, season, etc., the tit-lark. But how  many persons would have observed that the bird walked instead of hopped?    Some friends of mine who lived in the country tried to describe to me a  bird that built a nest in a tree within a few feet of the house. As it  was a brown bird, I should have taken it for a wood-thrush, had not  the nest been described as so thin and loose that from beneath the eggs  could be distinctly seen. The most pronounced feature in the description  was the barred appearance of the under side of the bird's tail. I was  quite at sea, until one day, when we were driving out, a cuckoo flew  across the road in front of us, when my friends exclaimed, \"There is our  bird!\" I had never known a cuckoo to build near a house, and I had never  noted the appearance the tail presents when viewed from beneath; but if  the bird had been described in its most obvious features, as slender,  with a long tail, cinnamon brown above and white beneath, with a curved  bill, anyone who knew the bird would have recognized the portrait.    We think we have looked at a thing sharply until we are asked for its  specific features. I thought I knew exactly the form of the leaf of the  tulip-tree, until one day a lady asked me to draw the outline of one. A  good observer is quick to take a hint and to follow it up. Most of the  facts of nature, especially in the life of the birds and animals, are  well screened. We do not see the play because we do not look intently  enough. The other day I was sitting with a friend upon a high rock  in the woods, near a small stream, when we saw a water-snake swimming  across a pool toward the opposite bank. Any eye would have noted it,  perhaps nothing more. A little closer and sharper gaze revealed the fact  that the snake bore something in its mouth, which, as we went down to  investigate, proved to be a small cat-fish, three or four inches long.  The snake had captured it in the pool, and, like any other fisherman,  wanted to get its prey to dry land, although itself lived mostly in the  water. Here, we said, is being enacted a little tragedy, that would have  escaped any but sharp eyes. The snake, which was itself small, had the  fish by the throat, the hold of vantage among all creatures, and clung  to it with great tenacity. The snake knew that its best tactics was to  get upon dry land as soon as possible. It could not swallow its victim  alive, and it could not strangle it in the water. For a while it tried  to kill its game by holding it up out of the water, but the fish grew  heavy, and every few moments its struggles brought down the snake's  head. This would not do. Compressing the fish's throat would not shut  off its breath under such circumstances, so the wily serpent tried to  get ashore with it, and after several attempts succeeded in effecting a  landing on a flat rock. But the fish died hard. Cat-fish do not give up  the ghost in a hurry. Its throat was becoming congested, but the snake's  distended jaws must have ached. It was like a petrified gape. Then the  spectators became very curious and close in their scrutiny, and the  snake determined to withdraw from the public gaze and finish the  business in hand to its own notions. But, when gently but firmly  remonstrated with by my friend with his walking-stick, it dropped the  fish and retreated in high dudgeon beneath a stone in the bed of the  creek. The fish, with a swollen and angry throat, went its way also.    Birds, I say, have wonderfully keen eyes. Throw a fresh bone or a  piece of meat upon the snow in winter, and see how soon the crows will  discover it and be on hand. If it be near the house or barn, the crow  that first discovers it will alight near it, to make sure he is not  deceived; then he will go away, and soon return with a companion. The  two alight a few yards from the bone, and after some delay, during which  the vicinity is sharply scrutinized, one of the crows advances boldly to  within a few feet of the coveted prize. Here he pauses, and if no trick  is discovered, and the meat be indeed meat, he seizes it and makes off.    One midwinter I cleared away the snow under an apple-tree near the house  and scattered some corn there. I had not seen a blue-jay for weeks, yet  that very day one found my corn, and after that several came daily and  partook of it, holding the kernels under their feet upon the limbs of  the trees and pecking them vigorously.    Of course the woodpecker and his kind have sharp eyes; still I was  surprised to see how quickly Downy found out some bones that were placed  in a convenient place under the shed to be pounded up for the hens. In  going out to the barn I often disturbed him making a meal off the bite  of meat that still adhered to them.    \"Look intently enough at anything,\" said a poet to me one day, \"and you  will see something that would otherwise escape you.\" I thought of the  remark as I sat on a stump in an opening of the woods one spring day. I  saw a small hawk approaching; he flew to a tall tulip-tree and alighted  on a large limb near the top. He eyed me and I eyed him. Then the bird  disclosed a trait that was new to me: he hopped along the limb to a  small cavity near the trunk, when he thrust in his head and pulled out  some small object and fell to eating it. After he had partaken of it for  some minutes he put the remainder back in his larder and flew away. I  had seen something like feathers eddying slowly down as the hawk ate,  and on approaching the spot found the feathers of a sparrow here and  there clinging to the bushes beneath the tree. The hawk then--commonly  called the chicken hawk--is as provident as a mouse or a squirrel, and  lays by a store against a time of need, but I should not have discovered  the fact had I not held my eye on him.    An observer of the birds is attracted by any unusual sound or commotion  among them. In May or June, when other birds are most vocal, the jay  is a silent bird; he goes sneaking about the orchards and the groves  as silent as a pickpocket; he is robbing bird's-nests and he is very  anxious that nothing should be said about it; but in the fall none so  quick and loud to cry \"Thief, thief!\" as he. One December morning a  troop of jays discovered a little screech-owl secreted in the hollow  trunk of an old apple-tree near my house. How they found the owl out is  a mystery, since it never ventures forth in the light of day; but  they did, and proclaimed the fact with great emphasis. I suspect the  bluebirds first told them, for these birds are constantly peeping into  holes and crannies, both spring and fall. Some unsuspecting bird had  probably entered the cavity prospecting for a place for next year's  nest, or else looking out a likely place to pass a cold night, and then  had rushed out with important news. A boy who should unwittingly venture  into a bear's den when Bruin was at home could not be more astonished  and alarmed than a bluebird would be on finding itself in the cavity of  a decayed tree with an owl. At any rate the bluebirds joined the jays  in calling the attention of all whom it might concern to the fact that  a culprit of some sort was hiding from the light of day in the old  apple-tree. I heard the notes of warning and alarm and approached to  within eye-shot. The bluebirds were cautious and hovered about uttering  their peculiar twittering calls; but the jays were bolder and took turns  looking in at the cavity, and deriding the poor shrinking owl. A  jay would alight in the entrance of the hole and flirt and peer and  attitudinize, and then flyaway crying \"Thief, thief, thief!\" at the top  of his voice.    I climbed up and peered into the opening, and could just descry the  owl clinging to the inside of the tree. I reached in and took him out,"]]]
