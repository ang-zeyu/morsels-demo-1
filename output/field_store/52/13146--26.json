All goes to  emphasize the height, mass, and interest of the right side.  On the left, which is otherwise empty, is a door half the  height of the window, giving on a brightly lighted courtyard,  from which is entering a woman, also in light clothing.  The  light streams in diagonally across the floor.  Thus, with all  the \"weight\" on the right, the effect of this deep vista on  the left and of its brightness is to give a complete balance,  while the suggestion of line from doorway and light makes,  together with the central figure, a roughly outlined V, which  serves to bind together all the elements.  Equation, (Lt.)V.+I.  =(Rt.)M.+I.    The thousand pictures on which the study was based<1> were  classified for convenience into groups,--Religious, Portrait,  Genre, and Landscape.  It was found on analysis that the  functions of the elements came out clearly, somewhat as follows.    <1> One thousand reproductions of old masters from F. Bruckmann's  _Classischer Bilderschatz_, Munich, omitting frescoes and  pictures of which less than the whole was given.    Of the religious pictures, only the \"Madonnas Enthroned\" and  other altar-pieces are considered at this point as presenting a  simple type, in which it is easy to show the variations from  symmetry.  In all these pictures the balance comes in between  the interest in the Infant Christ, sometimes together with  direction of attention to him, on one side, and other elements  on the other.  When the first side is especially \"heavy\" the  number of opposing elements increases, and especially takes  the form of vista and line, which have been experimentally  found to be powerful in attracting attention.  Where there are  no surrounding worshipers, we notice remarkable frequency in  the use of vista and line, and, in general, balance is brought  about through the disposition of form rather than of interests.  The reason for this would appear to be that the lack of  accessories in the persons of saints, worshipers, etc., and  the consequent increase in the size of Madonna and Child in  the picture, heightens the effect of any given outline, and so  makes the variations from symmetry greater.  This being the  case, the compensations would be stronger; and as we have  learned that vista and line are of this character, we see why  they are needed.    The portrait class is an especially interesting object for  study, inasmuch as while its general type is very simple and  constant, for this very reason the slightest variations are  sharply felt, and have their very strongest characteristic  effect.  The general type of the portrait composition is, of  course, the triangle with the head at the apex, and this point  is also generally in the central line; nevertheless, great  richness of effect is brought about by emphasizing variations.  For instance, the body and head are, in the great majority of  cases, turned in the same way, giving the strongest possible  emphasis to the direction of attention,--especially powerful,  of course, where all the interest is in the personality.  But  it is to be observed that the very strongest suggestion of  direction is given by the direction of the glance; and in no  case, when most of the other elements are directed in one way,  does the glance fail to come backward.  With the head on one  side of the central line, of course the greatest interest is  removed to one side, and the element of direction is brought  in to balance.  Again, with this decrease in symmetry, we see  a significant increase in the use of the especially effective  elements, vista and line.  In fact, the use of the small deep  vista is almost confined to the class with heads not in the  middle.  The direction of the glance also plays an important  part.  Very often the direction of movement alone is not  sufficient to balance the powerful M.+I. of the other side,  and the eye has to be attracted by a definite object of interest.  This is usually the hand, with or without an implement,--like  the palette, etc., of our first examples,--or a jewel, vase,  or bit of embroidery.  This is very characteristic of the  portraits of Rembrandt and Van Dyck.    In general, it may be said that (1) portraits with the head in  the centre of the frame show a balance between the direction  of suggested movement on one side, and mass or direction of  attention, or both together, on the other; while (2) portraits  with the head not in the centre show a balance between mass  and interest on one side, and direction of attention, or of  line, or vista, or combinations of these, on the other.    Still more unsymmetrical in their framework than portraits, in  fact the most unfettered type of all, are the genre pictures.  As these are pictures with a human interest, and full of action  and particular points of interest, it was to be expected that  interest would be the element most frequently appearing.  In  compositions showing great variations from geometrical symmetry,  it was also to be expected that vista and line, elements which  have been noted comparatively seldom up to this point, should  suddenly appear strongly; for, as being the most strikingly  \"heavy\" of the elements, they serve to compensate for other  variations combined.    The landscape is another type of unfettered composition.  It  was of course to be expected that in pictures without action  there should be little suggestion of attention or of direction  of movement.  But the most remarkable point is the presence  of vista in practically every example.  It is, of course,  natural that somewhere in almost every picture there should  be a break to show the horizon line, for the sake of variety,  if for nothing else; but what is significant is the part played  by this break in the balancing of the picture.  In about two  thirds of the examples the vista is inclosed by lines, or  masses, and when near the centre, as being at the same time the  \"heaviest\" part of the picture, it serves as a fulcrum or centre  to bind the parts--always harder to bring together than in the  other types of pictures--into a close unity.  The most frequent  form of this arrangement is a diagonal, which just saves itself  by turning up at its far end.  Thus the mass, and hence usually  the special interest of the picture, is on the one side, on  the other the vista and the sloping line of the diagonal.  In  very few cases is the vista behind an attractive or noticeable  part of the picture, the fact showing that it acts in opposition  to the latter, leading the eye away from it, and thus serving at  once the variety and richness of the picture, and its unity.  A  complete diagonal would have line and vista both working at the  extreme outer edge of the picture, and thus too strongly,--  unless, indeed, balanced by very striking elements near the  outer edge.    This function of the vista as a unifying element is of interest  in connection with the theory of Hildebrand,<1> that the landscape  should have a narrow foreground and wide background, since that  is most in conformity with our experience.  He adduces Titian's  \"Sacred and Profane Love\" as an example.  But of the general  principle it may be said that not the reproduction of nature,  but the production of beauty, is the aim of composition, and that  this aim is best reached by focusing the eye by a narrow background,  i.e. vista.  No matter how much it wanders, it returns to that  central spot and is held there, keeping hold on all the other  elements.  Of Hildebrand's example it may be said that the  pyramidal composition, with the dark and tall tree in the centre,  effectually accomplishes the binding together of the two figures,  so that a vista is not needed.  A wide background without that  tree would leave them rather disjointed.    <1> Op cit., p. 55.    In general, it may be said that balance in landscape is effected  between mass and interest on one side and vista and line on the  other; and that union is given especially by the use of vista.      II    The experimental treatment of the isolated elements detected  the particular function of each in distributing attention in  the field of view.  But while all are possibly operative in a  given picture, some are given, as we have seen, much more  importance than others, and in pictures of different types  different elements predominate.  In those classes with a  general symmetrical framework, such as the altar and Madonna  pieces, the elements of interest and direction of attention  determine the balance, for they appear as variations in a  symmetry which has already, so to speak, disposed of mass and  line.  They give what action there is, and where they are very  strongly operative, they are opposed by salient lines and deep  vistas, which act more strongly on the attention than does mass.  Interest keeps its predominance throughout the types, except in  the portraits, where the head is usually in the central line.  But even among the portraits it has a respectable representation,  as jewels, embroideries, beautiful hands, etc., count largely  too in composition.    The direction of attention is most operative among the portraits.  Since these pictures represent no action, it must be given by  those elements which move and distribute the attention; in  accordance with which principle we find line also unusually  influential.  As remarked above, altar-pieces and Madonna pictures,  also largely without action, depend largely for it on the direction  of attention.    The vista, as said above, rivets and confines the attention.  We  can, therefore, understand how it is that in the genre pictures it  appears very numerous.  The active character of these pictures  naturally requires to be modified, and the vista introduces a  powerful balancing element, which is yet quiet; or, it might be  said, inasmuch as energy is certainly expended in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3754"],[0,"The Wonders of Instinct: Chapters in the Psychology of Insects (#19)"],[1,"so to  the nostrils of my children, whom I call to bear witness. Then why does  the Flesh-fly, who but now was dropping her grubs from a goodly height,  refuse to let them fall from the top of a column twice as high? Does  she fear lest her worms should be bruised by an excessive drop? There  is nothing about her to point to anxiety aroused by the length of the  shaft. I never see her explore the tube or take its size. She stands on  the trellised orifice; and there the matter ends. Can she be apprised  of the depth of the chasm by the comparative faintness of the offensive  odours that arise from it? Can the sense of smell measure the distance  and judge whether it be acceptable or not? Perhaps.    The fact remains that, despite the attraction of the scent, the  Flesh-fly does not expose her worms to disproportionate falls. Can she  know beforehand that, when the chrysalids break, her winged family,  knocking with a sudden flight against the sides of a tall chimney, will  be unable to get out? This foresight would be in agreement with the  rules which order maternal instinct according to future needs.    But, when the fall does not exceed a certain depth, the budding worms  of the Flesh-fly are dropped without a qualm, as all our experiments  show. This principle has a practical application which is not without  its value in matters of domestic economy. It is as well that the  wonders of entomology should sometimes give us a hint of commonplace  utility.    The usual meat-safe is a sort of large cage with a top and bottom of  wood and four wire-gauze sides. Hooks fixed into the top are used  whereby to hang pieces which we wish to protect from the Flies. Often,  so as to employ the space to the best advantage, these pieces are  simply laid on the floor of the cage. With these arrangements, are we  sure of warding off the Fly and her vermin?    Not at all. We may protect ourselves against the Bluebottle, who is not  much inclined to lay her eggs at a distance from the meat; but there is  still the Flesh-fly, who is more venturesome and goes more briskly to  work and who will slip the grubs through a hole in the meshes and drop  them inside the safe. Agile as they are and well able to crawl, the  worms will easily reach anything on the floor; the only things secure  from their attacks will be the pieces hanging from the ceiling. It is  not in the nature of maggots to explore the heights, especially if this  implies climbing down a string in addition.    People also use wire-gauze dish-covers. The trellised dome protects the  contents even less than does the meat-safe. The Flesh-fly takes no heed  of it. She can drop her worms through the meshes on the covered joint.    Then what are we to do? Nothing could be simpler. We need only wrap the  birds which we wish to preserve--Thrushes, Partridges, Snipe and so  on--in separate paper envelopes; and the same with our beef and mutton.  This defensive armour alone, while leaving ample room for the air to  circulate, makes any invasion by the worms impossible; even without a  cover or a meat-safe: not that paper possesses any special preservative  virtues, but solely because it forms an impenetrable barrier. The  Bluebottle carefully refrains from laying her eggs upon it and the  Flesh-fly from bringing forth her offspring, both of them knowing that  their new-born young are incapable of piercing the obstacle.    Paper is equally successful in our strife against the Moths, those  plagues of our furs and clothes. To keep away these wholesale ravagers,  people generally use camphor, naphthalene, tobacco, bunches of  lavender, and other strong-scented remedies. Without wishing to malign  those preservatives, we are bound to admit that the means employed are  none too effective. The smell does very little to prevent the havoc of  the Moths.    I would therefore advise our housewives, instead of all this chemist's  stuff, to use newspapers of a suitable shape and size. Take whatever  you wish to protect--your furs, your flannel, or your clothes--and pack  each article carefully in a newspaper, joining the edges with a double  fold, well pinned. If this joining is properly done, the Moth will  never get inside. Since my advice has been taken and this method  employed in my household, the old damage has no longer been repeated.    To return to the Fly. A piece of meat is hidden in a jar under a layer  of fine, dry sand, a finger's-breadth thick. The jar has a wide mouth  and is left quite open. Let whoso come that will, attracted by the  smell. The Bluebottles are not long in inspecting what I have prepared  for them: they enter the jar, go out and come back again, inquiring  into the invisible thing revealed by its fragrance. A diligent watch  enables me to see them fussing about, exploring the sandy expanse,  tapping it with their feet, sounding it with their proboscis. I leave  the visitors undisturbed for a fortnight or three weeks. None of them  lays any eggs.    This is a repetition of what the paper bag, with its dead bird, showed  me. The Flies refuse to lay on the sand, apparently for the same  reasons. The paper was considered an obstacle which the frail vermin  would not be able to overcome. With sand, the case is worse. Its  grittiness would hurt the new-born weaklings, its dryness would absorb  the moisture indispensable to their movements. Later, when preparing  for the metamorphosis, when their strength has come to them, the grubs  will dig the earth quite well and be able to descend: but, at the  start, that would be very dangerous for them. Knowing these  difficulties, the mothers, however greatly tempted by the smell,  abstain from breeding. As a matter of fact, after long waiting, fearing  lest some packets of eggs may have escaped my attention, I inspect the  contents of the jar from top to bottom. Meat and sand contain neither  larvae nor pupae: the whole is absolutely deserted.    The layer of sand being only a finger's-breadth thick, this experiment  requires certain precautions. The meat may expand a little, in going  bad, and protrude in one or two places. However small the fleshy eyots  that show above the surface, the Flies come to them and breed.  Sometimes also the juices oozing from the putrid meat soak a small  extent of the sandy floor. That is enough for the maggot's first  establishment. These causes of failure are avoided with a layer of sand  about an inch thick. Then the Bluebottle, the Flesh-fly, and other  Flies whose grubs batten on dead bodies are kept at a proper distance.    In the hope of awakening us to a proper sense of our insignificance,  pulpit orators sometimes make an unfair use of the grave and its worms.  Let us put no faith in their doleful rhetoric. The chemistry of man's  final dissolution is eloquent enough of our emptiness: there is no need  to add imaginary horrors. The worm of the sepulchre is an invention of  cantankerous minds, incapable of seeing things as they are. Covered by  but a few inches of earth, the dead can sleep their quiet sleep: no Fly  will ever come to take advantage of them.    At the surface of the soil, exposed to the air, the hideous invasion is  possible; aye, it is the invariable rule. For the melting down and  remoulding of matter, man is no better, corpse for corpse, than the  lowest of the brutes. Then the Fly exercises her rights and deals with  us as she does with any ordinary animal refuse. Nature treats us with  magnificent indifference in her great regenerating factory: placed in  her crucibles, animals and men, beggars and kings are 1 and all alike.  There you have true equality, the only equality in this world of ours:  equality in the presence of the maggot.        CHAPTER 8. THE PINE-PROCESSIONARY.    Drover Dingdong's Sheep followed the Ram which Panurge had maliciously  thrown overboard and leapt nimbly into the sea, one after the other,  \"for you know,\" says Rabelais, \"it is the nature of the sheep always to  follow the first, wheresoever it goes.\"    The Pine caterpillar is even more sheeplike, not from foolishness, but  from necessity: where the first goes all the others go, in a regular  string, with not an empty space between them.    They proceed in single file, in a continuous row, each touching with  its head the rear of the one in front of it. The complex twists and  turns described in his vagaries by the caterpillar leading the van are  scrupulously described by all the others. No Greek theoria winding its  way to the Eleusinian festivals was ever more orderly. Hence the name  of Processionary given to the gnawer of the pine.    His character is complete when we add that he is a rope-dancer all his  life long: he walks only on the tight-rope, a silken rail placed in  position as he advances. The caterpillar who chances to be at the head  of the procession dribbles his thread without ceasing and fixes it on  the path which his fickle preferences cause him to take. The thread is  so tiny that the eye, though armed with a magnifying-glass, suspects it  rather than sees it.    But a second caterpillar steps on the slender foot-board and doubles it  with his thread; a third trebles it; and all the others, however many  there be, add the sticky spray from their spinnerets, so much so that,  when the procession has marched by, there remains, as a record of its  passing, a narrow white ribbon whose dazzling whiteness shimmers in the  sun. Very much more sumptuous than ours, their system of road-making  consists in upholstering with silk instead of macadamizing. We sprinkle  our roads with broken stones and level them by the pressure of a heavy  steam-roller; they lay over their paths a soft satin rail, a work of  general interest to which each contributes his thread.    What is the use of all this luxury? Could they not, like other  caterpillars, walk about without these costly preparations? I see two  reasons for their mode of progression. It is night when the"]]]
