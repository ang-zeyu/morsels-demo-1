O turn on me Thy look with mercy fraught,        And see how envious malice makes me groan!        The pall upon my heart by error thrown      Remove; illume me with Thy radiant thought.        At truth let not the wicked scorner mock,        O Thou, that breath'dst in me a spark divine.        The lying tongue's deceit with silence blight,        Protect me from its venom, Thou, my Rock,        And show the spiteful sland'rer by this sign        That Thou dost shield me with Thy endless might.\"    Sara's vindication was complete. Her friend Ceba was kept faithfully  informed of all that befell her, but he was absorbed in thoughts of her  conversion and his approaching end. He wrote to her that he did not care  to receive any more letters from her unless they announced her  acceptance of the true faith.    After Ansaldo's death, we hear nothing more about the poetess. She died  at the beginning of 1641, and the celebrated rabbi, Leon de Modena,  composed her epitaph, a poetic tribute to one whose life redounded to  the glory of Judaism.    Our subject now carries us from the luxuriant south to the dunes of the  North Sea. Holland was the first to open the doors of its cities  hospitably to the three hundred thousand Jews exiled from Spain, and its  busy capital Amsterdam became the centre whither tended the intelligent  of the Marranos, fleeing before the Holy Inquisition. Physicians,  mathematicians, philologists, military men, and diplomats, poets and  poetesses, took refuge there. Among the poetesses,[33] the most  prominent was Isabella Correa, distinguished for wit as well as poetic  endowment, the wife of the Jewish captain and author, Nicolas de Oliver  y Fullano, of Majorca. One of her contemporaries, Daniel de Barrios,  says that \"she was an accomplished linguist, wrote delightful letters,  composed exquisite verses, played the lute like a _maestro_, and sang  like an angel. Her sparkling black eyes sent piercing darts into every  beholder's heart, and she was famed for beauty as well as intellect.\"  She made a noble Spanish translation of _Pastor Fido_, the most popular  Italian drama of the day, and published a volume of poems, also in  Spanish. Antonio dos Reys sings her praises:      \"_Pastor Fido!_ no longer art thou read in thy own tongue, since Correa,    Faithfully rendering thy song, created thee anew in Spanish forms.    A laurel wreath surmounts her brow,    Because her right hand had cunning to strike tones from the tragic lyre.    On the mount of singers, a seat is reserved for her,    Albeit many a Batavian voice refused consent.    For, Correa's faith invited scorn from aliens,    And her own despised her cheerful serenity.    Now, with greater justice, all bend a reverent knee to Correa, the Jewess,    Correa, who, it seems, is wholly like Lysia.\"    Donna Isabella Enriquez, a Spanish poetess of great versatility, was her  contemporary. She lived first in Madrid, afterwards in Amsterdam, and  even in advanced age was surrounded by admirers. At the age of  sixty-two, she presented the men of her acquaintance with amulets  against love, notwithstanding that she had spoken and written against  the use of charms. For instance, when an egg with a crown on the end was  found in the house of Isaac Aboab, the celebrated rabbi at Amsterdam,  she wrote him the following:        \"See, the terror! Lo! the wonder!      Basilisk, the fabled viper!      Superstition names it so.      Look at it, I pray, with calmness,      'Twas thy mind that was at fault.      God's great goodness is displayed here;      He, I trow, rewards thy eloquence      In the monster which thou seest:      All this rounded whole's thy virtue,      Wisdom's symbol is the crown!\"    Besides Isabella Correa and Isabella Enriquez, we have the names, though  not the productions, of Sara de Fonseca Pina y Pimentel, Bienvenida  Cohen Belmonte, and Manuela Nunes de Almeida. They have left but faint  traces of their work, and fancy can fill in the sketch only with  conjectures.    After these Marrano poetesses, silence fell upon the women of Israel for  a whole century--a century of oppression and political slavery, of  isolation in noisome Ghettos, of Christian scorn and mockery. The Jews  of Germany and Poland, completely crushed beneath the load of sorrow,  hibernated until the gentle breath of a new time, levelling Ghetto walls  and heralding a dawn when human rights would be recognized, awoke them  to activity and achievement.    Mighty is the spirit of the times! It clears a way for itself, boldly  pushing aside every stumbling-block in the shape of outworn prejudices  and decaying customs. A century dawned, the promise of liberty and  tolerance flaming on its horizon, to none so sweet as to the Jew. Who  has the heart to cast the first stone upon a much-tried race, tortured  throughout the centuries, for surrendering itself to the unwonted joy of  living, for drinking deep, intoxicating draughts from the newly  discovered fount of liberty, and, alas! for throwing aside, under the  burning sun of the new era, the perennial protection of its religion?  And may we utterly condemn the daughters of Israel, the \"roses of  Sharon,\" and \"lilies of the valleys,\" \"unkissed by the dew, lost  wanderers cheered by no greeting,\" who, now that all was sunshine,  forgot their people, and disregarded the sanctity of family bonds, their  shield and their refuge in the sorrow and peril of the dark ages?    With emotion, with pain, not with resentment, Jewish history tells of  those women, who spurned Judaism, knowing only its external appearance,  its husk, not its essence, high ethical principles and philosophical  truths--of Rahel Varnhagen, Henriette Herz, Regina Froehlich, Dorothea  Mendelssohn, Sarah and Marianne Meyer, Esther Gad, and many others,  first products of German culture in alliance with Jewish wit and  brilliancy.    Rahel Levin was the foster-mother of \"Young Germany,\" and leader in the  woman's emancipation movement, so fruitful later on of deplorable  excesses. Rahel herself never overstepped the limits of \"_das  Ewig-Weibliche_.\" No act of hers ran counter to the most exalted  requirements of morality. Her being was pervaded by high seriousness,  noble dignity, serene cheerfulness. \"She dwelt always in the Holy of  holies of thought, and even her most daring wishes for herself and  mankind leapt shyly heavenwards like pure sacrificial flames.\" Nothing  more touching can be found in the history of the human heart than her  confession before death: \"With sublime rapture I dwell upon my origin  and the marvellous web woven by fate, binding together the oldest  recollections of the human race and its most recent aspirations,  connecting scenes separated by the greatest possible intervals of time  and space. My Jewish birth which I long considered a stigma, a sore  disgrace, has now become a precious inheritance, of which nothing on  earth can deprive me.\"[34]    The fact is that Rahel Levin was a great woman, great even in her  aberrations, while her satellites, shining by reflected light, and  pretending to perpetuate her spirit, transgressed the bounds of  womanliness, and opened wide a door to riotous sensuality. Certain  opponents of the woman's emancipation movement take malicious  satisfaction in rehearsing that it was a Jewess who inaugurated it,  prudently neglecting to mention that in the list of Rahel's followers,  not one Jewish name appears.    The spirit of Judaism and with it the spirit of morality can never be  extinguished. They may flag, or vanish for a time, but their restoration  in increased vigor and radiance is certain; for, they bear within  themselves the guarantee of a future. Henriette Herz, the apostate  daughter of Judaism chewing the cud of Schleiermacher's sentimentality  and Schlegel's romanticism, had not yet passed away when England  produced Jewish women whose deeds were quickened by the spirit of olden  heroism, who walked in the paths of wisdom and faith, and, recoiling  from the cowardice that counsels apostasy, would have fought, if need  be, suffered, and bled, for their faith. What answer but the blush of  shame mantling her cheek could the proud beauty have found, had she been  asked by, let us say, Lady Judith Montefiore, to tell what it was that  chained her to the ruins of the Jewish race?    Lady Montefiore truly was a heroine, worthy to be named with those who  have made our past illustrious, and her peer in intellect and strength  of character was Charlotte Montefiore, whose early death was a serious  loss to Judaism as well as to her family. Her work, \"A Few Words to the  Jews by one of themselves,\" containing that charming tale, \"The Jewel  Island,\" displays intellectual and poetic gifts.    The most prominent of women writers in our era unquestionably is Grace  Aguilar, in whom we must admire the rare union of broad culture and  profound piety. She was born at Hackney in June of 1816, and early  showed extraordinary talent and insatiable thirst for knowledge. In her  twelfth year she wrote \"Gustavus Vasa,\" an historical drama evincing  such unusual gifts that her parents were induced to devote themselves  exclusively to her education. It is a charming picture this, of a young,  gifted girl, under the loving care of cultured parents actuated by the  sole desire to imbue their daughter with their own taste for natural and  artistic beauty and their steadfast love for Judaism, and content to  lead a modest existence, away from the bustle and the opportunities of  the city, in order to be able to give themselves up wholly to the  education and companionship of their beloved, only daughter. Under the  influence of a wise friend, Grace Aguilar herself tells us, she  supplicated God to enable her to do something by which her people might  gain higher esteem with their Christian fellow-citizens.

He said that white men were never put to death within sight of the  kraal, lest the affair might be talked of by the women and children in  the presence of other white men who might pass through the country.  Although all might be well aware of their fate, but few would witness  their execution.  They would be led away some night, two or three miles  from the village and then put to death.  Their executioners would return  to the kraal with the story that they had been sent back to their own  country.    The chief, Congo believed, was not yet ready to witness their execution,  being too well pleased with his late acquired property to think of any  other business for the present.    Willem and Hendrik, after all that had been told them, were not prepared  to give up every hope.  Some chance to escape might offer, though it  should be with bare life; for they could not expect to take with them  their horses and guns.    As evening came on, the watch over the prisoners seemed less strictly  kept than during the earlier hours of the day.  But in vain they strove  to rend the thongs that bound them, or slip from their embrace.  They  had been too securely tied, most likely by one whose experience, alas!  had been but too well perfected in the enslavement of his own unhappy  countrymen.    During the evening, an individual was observed approaching.  Stepping up  to where Groot Willem was bound, he commenced an earnest scrutiny of his  features.    Willem fancied that the man had a familiar look, and, examining him  attentively, he recognised no less a personage than the banished Sindo,  the individual whom he had saved from the wrath of Macora.  Here was a  sudden transition from despair to hope.  Surely the would-be chief could  not be ungrateful!  Perhaps he would intercede in their behalf!  This  was but his duty.    Willem strove to make him understand that he was recognised, hoping the  knowledge of that would stimulate him to exert himself on their behalf.  The attempt wholly failed.  With a scornful expression upon his  features, the man moved away.    \"That's Sindo,\" muttered Willem to his fellow-prisoners.  \"He appears at  home among them.  Will he not assist us?\"    \"Yaas, that is Sindo,\" said Congo, \"but he no help you.\"    \"Why do you think so, Cong?\"    \"He no big enough fool do dat.\"    This might be true.  Sindo had once got into trouble through treason,  and had narrowly escaped death.  He would be a fool to incur such a  danger again, in the new home he had found for himself.    This was the construction Groot Willem was inclined to put on the  African's conduct.  Sindo was acting ungratefully.  He had not shown the  slightest sympathy for those who had befriended him in his hour of  adversity.  On the contrary, he had cut their acquaintance in the most  unceremonious manner.    All night long they lay in their thongs.  Morning came and still they  were not set free.    \"What does this treatment mean?\" asked Hendrik.  \"What do they intend  doing with us?\"    \"I am beginning to have fears that Congo is right,\" answered Willem.  \"They do mean harm.  They have robbed and kept us tied up all night.  Those acts look suspicious.\"    \"But dare they deprive us of life?\" asked the ex-cornet.  \"We are white  men, and of a race who avenge each other's wrongs.  Will they not be  afraid of the consequences of proceeding to extremities?\"    \"So I once would have thought,\" replied Willem, \"but from the way we are  now treated, I believe they fear nothing.\"    \"I tell you, baas Willem,\" joined in Congo, \"the chief here got too much  fear.\"    \"Indeed!  He has a peculiar way of showing it.\"    \"I mean, he's 'fraid to let us go.  We'll have to die, baas Willem.\"    The Kaffir uttered these words with a resigned expression of  countenance, that proclaimed him inspired by a firm conviction of their  truth.    \"Must this be, Hendrik?\" said Willem, turning to his companion.  \"It  hardly seems possible.  Tell me, am I dreaming?\"    \"I can answer for myself,\" replied Hendrik, \"for I was never more awake.  The rheims around my wrists are nearly cutting off my hands.  I shall  die if I have to remain tied up much longer.  But dare these people put  us to death?\"    For a time, the captives remained silent.  They were reflecting upon the  many atrocities which they had heard to have been committed by Zooloo  Kaffirs on the white settlers of the Cape country,--deeds of unprovoked  violence performed much nearer the reach of retribution than these now  were.  The savages into whose hands they had fallen were protected by  distance from any chance of being chastised from the south; and they had  no respect for the cowardly Portuguese of the north.    This was not all.  The hunters had first done them an injury, and then  refused what had been demanded for compensation.  In that resistance, a  chief had been outraged by a blow.  Moreover, there was property which  the natives dearly prized; and the safest way to secure it would be to  render their captives incapable of ever afterwards claiming it, or  seeking redress for the spoliation.    The whole case wore a black look.  Our adventurers began really to  believe that Congo was telling the truth, when he said, they _would have  to die_!        CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.    LED OUT TO DIE.    Another day passed over, and no change was made in the treatment of the  prisoners.  In fact very little notice was taken of them, except by the  women and children.  The chief with some others of the tribe spent the  day amusing themselves by firing the captured guns at a target, and  learning the use of the various articles they had taken from their  captives.    \"What are they waiting for?\" exclaimed Hendrik in an impatient tone.  \"If they are going to put us to death, it would be almost better for us  than to endure this misery.\"    \"True,\" rejoined Willem; \"life is not worth much, suffering as we do;  still, where there's uncertainty, there is hope.  Think of that,  Hendrik.  We have seen nothing of Sindo to-day.  How carefully the  ungrateful wretch keeps out of our sight!\"    \"If we were not in need of a friend,\" said Hendrik, \"I dare say he would  acknowledge our acquaintance.  But never mind.  He's the last that will  ever prove ungrateful, since we're not likely ever again to have an  opportunity of befriending any one in distress.\"    Night came on, and amongst the tribe the captives observed an unusual  excitement.  Several of the men were hurrying to and fro carrying  torches and evidently making preparations for some great event.  The  horses were also being saddled.    \"I tole you so,\" said Congo.  \"They take us away to die.\"    Willem and Hendrik remained silent spectators of what was going on.  A  party of the natives then approached them, and the three prisoners were  set loose from the trees.  Some scene, solemn and serious, was about to  be enacted; but worn out with their misery, and weary of their long  imprisonment, almost any change appeared a relief.    The chief of the tribe was now seen mounted on Willem's horse, heading a  procession of from ten to twelve men.  He rode off towards the pool,  where his horses had been killed.  The prisoners were conducted after  him.  Spoor'em and the other dogs accompanied the party, wholly  unconscious of the fears that troubled their masters.  As the procession  passed out of the village, the old men, women, and children were ranged  along the road, to see them depart.  These gazed after them with  expressions of curiosity, not unmingled with pity, though there were  some that appeared to show satisfaction.  The captives observed this,  and talked of it.  Why did they, the villagers, feel so much interested  in their departure?  They had not taken much heed of their arrival; and  but little attention had been paid to them while bound to the trees.  Why should there be now?  There was but one answer to these questions.  The natives were looking upon them with that expression of sad curiosity  with which men gaze upon one who is about to suffer a violent death.    The chief was carrying Willem's roer, and from his behaviour he seemed  preparing for an opportunity to use it.  At intervals he brought it to  his shoulder and glanced along the barrel.    \"Ask them where we are being taken, Congo,\" said Hendrik.    The Kaffir spoke to one of the natives who was near him, but only  received a grunt in reply.    \"He don't know where we go,\" said Congo, interpreting the gruff answer  to his question, \"but I know.\"    \"Where?\"    \"We go to die.\"    \"Congo!\" exclaimed Willem, \"ask after Sindo.  He may do something to  save us, or he may not.  There can be no harm in trying.  If not, we may  get him into some trouble for his ingratitude.  I should feel a  satisfaction in that.\"    In compliance with his master's command, Congo inquired for Sindo.  The  chief heard the inquiry and immediately ordered a halt, and put several  questions to his followers.    \"The chief just like you, baas Willem,\" said Congo.  \"He too want know  where Sindo am.\"    The procession was delayed while the parley was going on.  After it had  ended, the chief and another rode back to the village;--they were now  about half a mile distant from it.  The prisoners, with their guards  remained upon the spot.  The chief was absent nearly an hour, when he  returned seemingly in a great rage.  By his angry talking, every one was  made aware of the fact.  Congo listened attentively to what he said.    \"He's talking about Sindo,\" said the Kaffir.  \"He swear he kill dat  nigga to-morrow.\"    \"I hope he'll keep his oath,\" said Willem.  \"I suppose we have succeeded  in awaking his suspicions against the wretch he was harbouring; and he  will be punished for his ingratitude.  He should have tried to save  us,--even at the risk of having again to make change of his tribe.\"    The march"]]]
