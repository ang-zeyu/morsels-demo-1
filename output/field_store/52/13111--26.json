THE CATALOGUES OF WOMEN AND EOIAE (fragments) [1701]    Fragment #1--Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. iii. 1086: That  Deucalion was the son of Prometheus and Pronoea, Hesiod states in the  first \"Catalogue\", as also that Hellen was the son of Deucalion and  Pyrrha.      Fragment #2--Ioannes Lydus [1702], de Mens. i. 13: They came to call  those who followed local manners Latins, but those who followed Hellenic  customs Greeks, after the brothers Latinus and Graecus; as Hesiod says:  'And in the palace Pandora the daughter of noble Deucalion was joined in  love with father Zeus, leader of all the gods, and bare Graecus, staunch  in battle.'      Fragment #3--Constantinus Porphyrogenitus [1703], de Them. 2 p. 48B: The  district Macedonia took its name from Macedon the son of Zeus and Thyia,  Deucalion's daughter, as Hesiod says: 'And she conceived and bare to  Zeus who delights in the thunderbolt two sons, Magnes and Macedon,  rejoicing in horses, who dwell round about Pieria and Olympus....  ((LACUNA)) ....And Magnes again (begot) Dictys and godlike Polydectes.'      Fragment #4--Plutarch, Mor. p. 747; Schol. on Pindar Pyth. iv. 263:  'And from Hellen the war-loving king sprang Dorus and Xuthus and Aeolus  delighting in horses. And the sons of Aeolus, kings dealing justice,  were Cretheus, and Athamas, and clever Sisyphus, and wicked Salmoneus  and overbold Perieres.'      Fragment #5--Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. iv. 266: Those who  were descended from Deucalion used to rule over Thessaly as Hecataeus  and Hesiod say.      Fragment #6--Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. i. 482: Aloiadae.  Hesiod said that they were sons of Aloeus,--called so after him,--and of  Iphimedea, but in reality sons of Poseidon and Iphimedea, and that Alus  a city of Aetolia was founded by their father.      Fragment #7--Berlin Papyri, No. 7497; Oxyrhynchus Papyri, 421 [1704]:  (ll. 1-24) '....Eurynome the daughter of Nisus, Pandion's son, to whom  Pallas Athene taught all her art, both wit and wisdom too; for she was  as wise as the gods. A marvellous scent rose from her silvern raiment  as she moved, and beauty was wafted from her eyes. Her, then, Glaucus  sought to win by Athena's advising, and he drove oxen [1705] for her.  But he knew not at all the intent of Zeus who holds the aegis. So  Glaucus came seeking her to wife with gifts; but cloud-driving Zeus,  king of the deathless gods, bent his head in oath that the.... son of  Sisyphus should never have children born of one father [1706]. So she  lay in the arms of Poseidon and bare in the house of Glaucus blameless  Bellerophon, surpassing all men in.... over the boundless sea. And when  he began to roam, his father gave him Pegasus who would bear him most  swiftly on his wings, and flew unwearying everywhere over the earth, for  like the gales he would course along.

Fragment #9--Scholiast Ven. on Homer, Il. xi. 750: The two sons of Actor  and Molione... Hesiod has given their descent by calling them after  Actor and Molione; but their father was Poseidon.    Porphyrius [1707], Quaest. Hom. ad Iliad. pert., 265: But Aristarchus is  informed that they were twins, not.... such as were the Dioscuri, but,  on Hesiod's testimony, double in form and with two bodies and joined to  one another.      Fragment #10--Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. i. 156: But Hesiod  says that he changed himself in one of his wonted shapes and perched on  the yoke-boss of Heracles' horses, meaning to fight with the hero; but  that Heracles, secretly instructed by Athena, wounded him mortally with  an arrow. And he says as follows: '...and lordly Periclymenus. Happy he!  For earth-shaking Poseidon gave him all manner of gifts. At one time he  would appear among birds, an eagle; and again at another he would be  an ant, a marvel to see; and then a shining swarm of bees; and again at  another time a dread relentless snake. And he possessed all manner of  gifts which cannot be told, and these then ensnared him through the  devising of Athene.'      Fragment #11--Stephanus of Byzantium [1708], s.v.: '(Heracles) slew the  noble sons of steadfast Neleus, eleven of them; but the twelfth, the  horsemen Gerenian Nestor chanced to be staying with the horse-taming  Gerenians. ((LACUNA)) Nestor alone escaped in flowery Gerenon.'      Fragment #12--Eustathius [1709], Hom. 1796.39: 'So well-girded  Polycaste, the youngest daughter of Nestor, Neleus' son, was joined in  love with Telemachus through golden Aphrodite and bare Persepolis.'      Fragment #13--Scholiast on Homer, Od. xii. 69: Tyro the daughter of  Salmoneus, having two sons by Poseidon, Neleus and Pelias, married  Cretheus, and had by him three sons, Aeson, Pheres and Amythaon. And  of Aeson and Polymede, according to Hesiod, Iason was born: 'Aeson, who  begot a son Iason, shepherd of the people, whom Chiron brought up in  woody Pelion.'      Fragment #14--Petrie Papyri (ed. Mahaffy), Pl. III. 3: '....of the  glorious lord ....fair Atalanta, swift of foot, the daughter of  Schoeneus, who had the beaming eyes of the Graces, though she was ripe  for wedlock rejected the company of her equals and sought to avoid  marriage with men who eat bread.'    Scholiast on Homer, Iliad xxiii. 683: Hesiod is therefore later in date  than Homer since he represents Hippomenes as stripped when contending  with Atalanta [1710].    Papiri greci e latini, ii. No. 130 (2nd-3rd century) [1711]: (ll. 1-7)  'Then straightway there rose up against him the trim-ankled maiden  (Atalanta), peerless in beauty: a great throng stood round about her as  she gazed fiercely, and wonder held all men as they looked upon her. As  she moved, the breath of the west wind stirred the shining garment about  her tender bosom; but Hippomenes stood where he was: and much people was  gathered together. All these kept silence; but Schoeneus cried and said:    (ll. 8-20) '\"Hear me all, both young and old, while I speak as my spirit  within my breast bids me. Hippomenes seeks my coy-eyed daughter to wife;  but let him now hear my wholesome speech. He shall not win her without  contest; yet, if he be victorious and escape death, and if the deathless  gods who dwell on Olympus grant him to win renown, verily he shall  return to his dear native land, and I will give him my dear child and  strong, swift-footed horses besides which he shall lead home to be  cherished possessions; and may he rejoice in heart possessing these, and  ever remember with gladness the painful contest. May the father of men  and of gods (grant that splendid children may be born to him)' [1712]    ((LACUNA))    (ll. 21-27) 'on the right.... and he, rushing upon her,.... drawing back  slightly towards the left. And on them was laid an unenviable struggle:  for she, even fair, swift-footed Atalanta, ran scorning the gifts of  golden Aphrodite; but with him the race was for his life, either to find  his doom, or to escape it. Therefore with thoughts of guile he said to  her:    (ll. 28-29) '\"O daughter of Schoeneus, pitiless in heart, receive these  glorious gifts of the goddess, golden Aphrodite...'    ((LACUNA))    (ll. 30-36) 'But he, following lightly on his feet, cast the first apple  [1713]: and, swiftly as a Harpy, she turned back and snatched it.  Then he cast the second to the ground with his hand. And now fair,  swift-footed Atalanta had two apples and was near the goal; but  Hippomenes cast the third apple to the ground, and therewith escaped  death and black fate. And he stood panting and...'      Fragment #15--Strabo [1714], i. p. 42: 'And the daughter of Arabus, whom  worthy Hermaon begat with Thronia, daughter of the lord Belus.'      Fragment #16--Eustathius, Hom. 461. 2: 'Argos which was waterless Danaus  made well-watered.'      Fragment #17--Hecataeus [1715] in Scholiast on Euripides, Orestes,  872: Aegyptus himself did not go to Argos, but sent his sons, fifty in  number, as Hesiod represented.      Fragment #18--[1716] Strabo, viii. p. 370: And Apollodorus says that  Hesiod already knew that the whole people were called both Hellenes  and Panhellenes, as when he says of the daughters of Proetus that the  Panhellenes sought them in marriage.    Apollodorus, ii. 2.1.4: Acrisius was king of Argos and Proetus of  Tiryns. And Acrisius had by Eurydice the daughter of Lacedemon, Danae;  and Proetus by Stheneboea 'Lysippe and Iphinoe and Iphianassa'. And  these fell mad, as Hesiod states, because they would not receive the  rites of Dionysus.    Probus [1717] on Vergil, Eclogue vi. 48: These (the daughters of  Proetus), because they had scorned the divinity of Juno, were overcome  with madness, such that they believed they had been turned into  cows, and left Argos their own country. Afterwards they were cured by  Melampus, the son of Amythaon.    Suidas, s.v.: [1718] 'Because of their hideous wantonness they lost  their tender beauty....'    Eustathius, Hom. 1746.7: '....For he shed upon their heads a fearful  itch: and leprosy covered all their flesh, and their hair dropped from  their heads, and their fair scalps were made bare.'

Pizarro found means of making his  arrival known to him, and at the same time offered him his alliance  against his enemies.[68] Atahualpa was delighted with these overtures,  and invited his pretended allies to a conference near Caxamarca, where  the Spaniards had installed themselves. The Inca advanced, parading all  the pomp and splendour of his solar divinity. Four hundred richly-clad  attendants preceded his palanquin, which sparkled at a thousand points  with gold and precious stones, and was borne on the shoulders of  officers drawn from amongst the highest nobles, while troops of male and  female dancers followed the child of the Sun and plied their art. Then  ensued one of those unique scenes of history upon which, as indignation  contends with amazement for the mastery in our minds, we must pause for  a moment to gaze.    Pizarro's almoner, Father Valverde, drew near to the Inca, a crucifix in  one hand and a missal in the other, and by means of an interpreter  delivered a regular discourse to him, in which he announced that Pope  Alexander VI. had given all the lands of America to the King of Spain,  which he had a right to do as the successor of St. Peter, who was  himself the Vicar of the Son of God. Then he expounded the chief  articles of Christian orthodoxy, and summoned the Inca there and then  to abjure the religion of his ancestors, receive baptism, and submit to  the sovereignty of the King of Spain. On these conditions he might  continue to reign. Otherwise he must look for every kind of disaster.    Atahualpa was literally stupefied. Much of the discourse, no doubt, he  failed to follow, but what he did understand filled him with  indignation. He answered that he reigned over his peoples by hereditary  right, and could not see how a foreign priest could dispose of lands  that were not his. He should remain faithful to the religion of his  fathers, \"especially,\" he added, as he pointed to the crucifix grasped  by the monk, \"since my god, the Sun, is at any rate alive; whereas the  one you propose for my acceptance, as far as I gather, is dead.\"  Finally, he desired to know whence his interlocutor had derived all the  strange things that he had told him. \"Hence!\" cried Valverde, holding  out his missal. The Inca, who had never seen a book in all his life,  took this object, so new to him, in his hands, opened it, put it to his  ear, and finding that it said nothing, flung it contemptuously on the  ground.    Pizarro saw the moment for striking the blow he contemplated. Crying out  at the sacrilege, he gave his soldiers the signal of attack. Their  horses and fire-arms caused an instant panic. In vain did some of his  officers attempt to defend the Inca. Pizarro broke through to him,  seized him by the arm and dragged him to his quarters. All his escort  fled in terror.    Atahualpa, then, was in the immediate power of Pizarro, who (still  imitating Cortes) surrounded his prisoner with every comfort and  attention, though confining him strictly to one chamber, and warning him  that any attempt at escape or resistance would be the signal for his  death. Atahualpa soon perceived that thirst for gold was the great  motive that had impelled the Spaniards to their audacious enterprize. He  hoped to disarm them by offering as ransom gold enough to fill the  chamber in which he was confined up to the height of a man. He gave the  necessary orders for collecting the precious metal in the requisite  amount, and to secure the good reception of the emissaries whom Pizarro  despatched everywhere to receive it. One of these detachments even  entered into relations with the captive Inca, Huascar, and the latter  hastened to offer the Spaniards yet more gold than Atahualpa was giving  them if they would take his part. Atahualpa heard of this, was alarmed,  regarded his conquered brother's attempts in the light of high-treason,  gave orders for his death--and was obeyed.[69]    He was not aware how precarious was his own tenure of life. Pizarro saw  more and more clearly that, in order to become the real master of Peru,  he must get rid of the reigning Inca, and put some child in his place,  who would be a passive instrument in his hands. He was fairly alarmed by  the religious obedience, timid but absolute, that the \"child of the  Sun,\" even in his captivity, received from all classes of his subjects.  He fancied that from the recesses of his prison, and even while paying  off his enormous ransom,[70] Atahualpa had sent secret orders to the  most distant populations to arm themselves and come to his rescue. The  interpreter through whom he communicated with his captive was out of  temper with his master, for his head had been so turned by ambition,  that he had demanded the hand of a _coya_, that is to say, one of the  Inca's women, and had been haughtily refused. In revenge, he made  malicious reports to Pizarro. But it was an accidental circumstance that  brought the latter's ill-will towards his captive to a point. The Inca  greatly admired the art of writing when he discovered all the uses the  Spaniards made of it. One day it occurred to him to get one of the  soldiers on guard over him to write the word _Dio_ upon his nail, and he  was delighted and astonished to find that every one to whom he showed it  read it in the same way. So they told him that every one a little above  the common herd could read and write in Europe. His evil star would  have it that he showed his thumb one day to Pizarro, who could make  nothing of it. Pizarro, then, could not read! Atahualpa concluded that  he was merely one of the common herd, and found an opportunity of  telling him so. Pizarro, stung to the quick, hesitated no longer. A mock  judgment condemned Atahualpa to the extreme penalty for the crimes of  idolatry, polygamy, usurpation, fratricide and rebellion. In vain he  appealed to the King of Spain. He was led to the stake, and Father  Valverde made him purchase by a baptism _in extremis_ the privilege of  being strangled instead of burned alive.    From this moment the fate of Peru was decided. The head once struck from  the great body, long convulsions ensued, but no serious resistance was  possible. Pizarro set up as Inca a young brother of Huascar's, who was  at first a mere instrument in the hands of his country's bleeders, but  afterwards escaped and raised insurrections which ended in his total  defeat. The Spaniards had been reinforced, and had found allies amongst  the peoples who had been torn from their native soils by the victorious  Incas.[71] Other attempts, still attaching themselves to the name of  some Inca, failed in like manner. And yet the mass of the Peruvians, in  spite of their conversion to Roman Catholicism, remained obstinately  attached to the memory of their Incas. One of their real or pretended  descendants, in the eighteenth century, did not shrink from serving as a  domestic at Madrid and Rome, as the only means of learning the secret of  that European power which had so cruelly crushed his ancestors.[72] But  on his return to Peru (1744 A.D.) his efforts only ended in his  destruction. But this did not prevent a certain Tupac Amarou, who was  descended from the Incas through a female line, from fomenting a  rebellion in 1780, which it cost the Spaniards an effort to  suppress.[73] Later on, after the revolution that broke the bond of  subjection to Spain, this stubborn hostility of the Peruvians changed  its character; but in 1867, Bustamente still tried to make capital out  of the historical attachment of the natives to the Incas by declaring  himself their descendant. The opposition, however, had long lost all  vestige of a religious character. The legend of Manco Capac, which is  still current amongst the people, has been euhemerized. It is now no  more than the story of a just and enlightened prince, the benefactor of  the country. The natives, it seems, are fond of playing a kind of drama,  in which the trial and death of Atahualpa are represented. Superstitious  to the last degree, they accept the practices of Catholicism with a  submission that has in it more of a melancholy and hopeless resignation  than an ardent or trusting faith. The glorious age of the Incas is gone,  and will never return, but it is still regretted.[74]      II.    And now it is high time that we examined that religion which was so  closely associated with the whole national life of Peru.    From all that I have said already, you will easily understand that the  Sun has never been worshipped more directly or with more devotion than  in Peru. It was he whom the Peruvians regarded as sovereign lord of the  world, king of the heaven and the earth. His Peruvian name was _Inti_,  \"Light.\" The villages were usually built so as to look eastward, in  order that the inhabitants might salute the supreme god as soon as he  appeared in the morning. The most usual representation of him was a  golden disk representing a human face surrounded by rays and flames. In  Peru, as everywhere else, a feeling existed that there was a certain  relation between the substance of gold and that of the great luminary.  In the nuggets torn from the mountain sides they thought they saw the  Sun's tears.[75] The great periodic fetes of the year, the imperial and  national festivals in which every one took part, were those held in  honour of the Sun.    Immediately after him came his sister and consort the Moon, Mama Quilla.  Her image was a disk of silver bearing human features, and silver played  the same part in her worship that gold did in that of the Sun. It  appears, however, that they performed fewer sacrifices to her than to  her august consort, which is quite in harmony with the inferior position  assigned to woman in the Peruvian civilization.[76] Like Selene"]]]
