USES.      The rigid utilitarian will hardly be satisfied with the short  catalogue which can be furnished of the uses of fungi. Excepting those  which are employed more or less for human food, very few are of any  practical value in arts or medicine. It is true that imperfect  conditions of fungi exert a very important influence on fermentation,  and thus become useful; but, unfortunately, fungi have the reputation  of being more destructive and offensive than valuable or useful.  Notwithstanding that a large number of species have from time to time  been enumerated as edible, yet those commonly employed and recognized  are very few in number, prejudice in many cases, and fear in others,  militating strongly against additions to the number. In Great Britain  this is especially the case, and however advisable it may be to  exercise great care and caution in experimenting on untried or  doubtful species, it can only be regarded as prejudice which prevents  good, in fact, excellent, esculent species being more extensively  used, instead of allowing them to rot by thousands on the spots where  they have grown. Poisonous species are also plentiful, and no golden  rule can be established by means of which any one may detect at a  glance good from bad, without that kind of knowledge which is applied  to the discrimination of species. Yet, after all, the characters of  half a dozen good esculent fungi are acquired as easily as the  distinctions between half a dozen birds such as any ploughboy can  discriminate.    The common mushroom (_Agaricus campestris_) is the best known  esculent, whether in its uncultivated or in a cultivated state. In  Britain many thousands of people, notably the lower classes, will not  recognize any other as fit for food, whilst in Italy the same classes  have a strong prejudice against this very species.[A] In Vienna, we  found by personal experience that, although many others are eaten, it  is this which has the most universal preference, yet it appears but  sparingly in the markets as compared with others. In Hungary it does  not enjoy by any means so good a reputation. In France and in Germany  it is a common article of consumption. The different varieties found,  as the results of cultivation, present some variation in colour,  scaliness of pileus, and other minor features, whilst remaining true  to the constituent characters of the species. Although it is not our  intention to enumerate here the botanical distinctions of the species  to which we may call attention, yet, as mistakes (sometimes fatal) are  often being recorded, in which other fungi are confounded with this,  we may be permitted a hint or two which should be remembered. The  spores are purple, the gills are at first delicate pink, afterwards  purple; there is a permanent ring or collar round the stem, and it  must _not_ be sought in woods. Many accidents might have been spared  had these facts been remembered.    The meadow mushroom (_Agaricus arvensis_) is common in meadows and  lowland pastures, and is usually of a larger size than the preceding,  with which it agrees in many particulars, and is sent in enormous  quantities to Covent Garden, where it frequently predominates over  _Agaricus campestris_. Some persons prefer this, which has a stronger  flavour, to the ordinary mushroom, and it is the species most commonly  sold in the autumn in the streets of London and provincial towns.  According to Persoon, it is preferred in France; and, in Hungary, it  is considered as a special gift from St. George. It has acquired in  England the name of horse mushroom, from the enormous size it  sometimes attains. Withering mentions a specimen that weighed fourteen  pounds.[B]    One of the commonest (in our experience the _most_ common) of all  edible fungi in the public markets of Vienna is the Hallimasche  (_Agaricus melleus_), which in England enjoys no good reputation for  flavour or quality; indeed, Dr. Badham calls it \"nauseous and  disagreeable,\" and adds that \"not to be poisonous is its only  recommendation.\" In Vienna it is employed chiefly for making sauce;  but we must confess that even in this way, and with a prejudice in  favour of Viennese cookery, our experience of it was not satisfactory.  It is at best a sorry substitute for the mushroom. In the summer and  autumn this is a very common species in large tufts on old stumps. In  similar localities, and also in tufts, but neither so large, nor so  common, _Agaricus fusipes_ is found. It is preferable to the foregoing  as an esculent, and is easily recognized by the spindle-shaped stem.    _Agaricus rubescens_, P., belongs to a very suspicious group of  fungi, in which the cap or pileus is commonly studded or sprinkled  with paler warts, the remains of an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30230"],[0,"A Story of the Red Cross; Glimpses of Field Work (#19)"],[1,"cooperation between the government and its  supplemental handmaiden, the Red Cross. That these relations might not  have been clearly understood at this initial date may well be  appreciated, but that time and experience will remedy this may be  confidently hoped.    Through all our discouragements the steady hand and calm approval of our  great head of the army and navy was our solace and our strength. And  when at length it was all over, his hand could trace for his message to  his people the following testimonial, what need had one even to remember  past discouragements, however great? It was as if the hand of the martyr  had set its undying seal upon the brow of the American Red Cross. What  greater justification could it have? What greater riches could it crave?    \"In this connection it is a pleasure for me to mention in terms of  cordial appreciation the timely and useful work of the American Red  Cross, both in relief measures preparatory to the campaigns, in sanitary  assistance at several of the camps of assemblage, and, later, under the  able and experienced leadership of the president of the society, Miss  Clara Barton, on the fields of battle and in the hospitals at the front  in Cuba. Working in conjunction with the governmental authorities and  under their sanction and approval, and with the enthusiastic cooperation  of many patriotic women and societies in the various States, the Red  Cross has fully maintained its already high reputation for intense  earnestness and ability to exercise the noble purposes of its  international organization, thus justifying the confidence and support  which it has received at the hands of the American people. To the  members and officers and all who aided them in their philanthropic  work, the sincere and lasting gratitude of the soldiers and the public  is due and freely accorded.    \"In tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obligations  to the Divine Master for His watchful care over us, and His safe  guidance, for which the nation makes reverent acknowledgment and offers  humble prayers for the continuance of His favors.\"--FROM PRESIDENT  MCKINLEY'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS, DECEMBER 6, 1898.          IX    GALVESTON    1900      This time there was no murmur in the air, no warning of approaching  danger. Even the watchful press, that knows so much before it ever  happens, slumbered quiet and deep, till the hissing wires shrieked the  terrifying word--Galveston.    Then we learned that, as at Port Royal, the sea had overleaped its  bounds and its victims by thousands were in its grasp.    In all the land no one slept then. To us it was the clang of the  fire-bell, and the drop of the harness. The Red Cross clans commenced to  gather.    In two days a little coterie of near a dozen left Washington under  escort of the competent agency of the New York World, which had on the  first day telegraphed that it would open a subscription for the relief  of Galveston, and would be glad to send all supplies and money received  to the Red Cross, if its president, Miss Clara Barton, would go and  distribute it. It was the acceptance of this generous offer that had  brought to the station in Washington the escort; and a palace-car,  provided with all comforts for the journey to Galveston, was under the  management of the World's efficient correspondent and agent, Robert  Adamson.    The direfulness of the news gathered as we proceeded on our journey, and  delays were gotten over as quickly as possible. A detention of several  hours in New Orleans gave opportunity for consultation with the officers  of the Red Cross Society of that city, which had held its loyal ranks  unbroken since 1882, and became a tower of strength in this relief. A  day of waiting in Houston for a passage over the Gulf gave us a glimpse  of what the encroachment had been on the mainland. We found the passage  across to Galveston difficult, and with one night of waiting by the  shore in almost open cars, at Texas City, we at length arrived in  Galveston on the morning of the 15th of September.    Here again no description could adequately serve its purpose. The sea,  with fury spent, had sullenly retired. The strongest buildings, half  standing, roofless and tottering, told what once had been the make-up of  a thriving city. But that cordon of wreckage skirting the shore for  miles it seemed, often twenty feet in height, and against which the high  tide still lapped and rolled! What did it tell? The tale is all too  dreadful to recall--the funeral pyre of at least five thousand human  beings. The uncoffined dead of the fifth part of a city lay there. The  lifeless bodies festering in the glaring heat of a September sun told  only too fatally what that meant to that portion of the city left alive.  The streets were well-nigh impassable, the animals largely drowned, the  working force of men diminished, dazed, and homeless. The men who had  been the fathers of the city, its business and its wealth, looked on  aghast at their overwhelmed possessions, ruined homes, and, worse than  all, mourned their own dead.    Yet these men, to the number of thirty or more, had, as one may say,  pulled themselves together, and were even at that early date a relief  committee, holding their meetings at the wrecked and half-ruined hotel,  almost the only public house left standing. To this hotel we also went  and reported to the committee. To say that we were kindly and  gratefully received by them says nothing that would satisfy either  ourselves or them.    The conditions were so new to them that it was a relief to meet persons  who had seen such things before. We were asked not only to act with  them, but to assume charge of the administration of relief. This, of  course, we would not do, but that we would meet with, counsel, and aid  them in every way in our power, is needless to affirm. That we did do  this, through every day of our stay of three months, not only our own  conviction, but the unasked and unexpected testimony of both Galveston  and the Legislature of the State of Texas, go to assure.    On the third day after our arrival we were joined by Mr. Stephen E.  Barton, President of the former Central Cuban Relief Committee, and Mr.  Fred L. Ward, its competent secretary, who became our secretary from the  time of his arrival until the close of the field, continuing until after  our return to headquarters and settling the last account. Not only the  thanks of the Red Cross are due for his faithful, painstaking work, but  his name is still a household word through the score of counties  skirting the shore on the mainland of Texas.    It may be interesting to readers to know what is done first, or just how  a relief party commence under circumstances like that. A few words will  give an outline. First the ground must be overlooked and conditions  learned. This is not easy when it is remembered that broken houses,  cars, wagons, church steeples, and grand pianos were liable to be  encountered in the middle of the leading streets, themselves buried  three feet in the coarse black sand, brought in by the great tidal wave.    Nevertheless, a building must be found in which to store and distribute  the supplies that would immediately come. How needful these supplies  would be can be inferred when it is recalled that scores of persons came  alive out of that wreck, with simply the band of a shirt or a  night-dress held by its button about the neck as the only reminder that  ever a cover of clothing had been theirs.    A little meeting of my assistants early held assigned each to his duty  and his place. A warehouse, fortunately still intact, was generously  supplied by Mr. John Sealy. Major James A. McDowell, with the  experience of this branch of Red Cross work from Johnstown down, and the  record of twenty-six battles in the old civil war, was placed in charge.  Here is one of the scenes given by a casual eye-witness:    A poor feeble-looking man, with scant clothing, enters the warehouse and  waits. \"Hello there,\" calls the observant major--with his Grand Army  button--overhauling clothes for the visitor. \"But, major, I was a  Confederate soldier.\" \"Lord bless your poor suffering soul, what  difference does that make? Here, this will suit you.\"    It was thought advisable by some of the party to establish an orphanage,  which was done and carried through, regardless of the common-sense idea  that few children would survive, when the parents were drowned. And so  it proved, although the work was faithfully administered.    Homes must be made, lumber obtained, and houses built. The Red Cross  sent out the appeal for lumber and aided in the work of shelter.    Mrs. Fannie B. Ward was placed in charge of a special clothing  department. Need I remind thoughtful readers that in a disaster like  that, where people of affluence, culture, and position are in a night  bereft of all, one of the cruelest features might be to go to the open  boxes of a relief station for clothing, such as never before worn, and  could not be asked for through the choking tears. In all humanity these  cases must be properly, respectfully, and discreetly met, as one lady  could meet another in distress.    No more vivid picture of the conditions by which we were surrounded can  be imagined than the following extract from Mrs. Ward's report:      \"Just seven days after the storm we found ourselves stranded at Texas  City, on the mainland opposite Galveston Island, waiting for  transportation across the six-mile stretch of water. Bridges had been  swept away, and new sand-bars thrown up in the bay; floating roofs and  timbers impeded navigation, and the only method of communication between  the mainland and Galveston was one poor little ferry-boat, which had to  feel her now dangerous way very cautiously, by daylight only. She had  also to carry nearly a quarter of her capacity in soldiers to prevent  her being swamped by waiting"]]]
