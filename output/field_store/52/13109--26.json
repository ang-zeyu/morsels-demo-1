It is thus, O man! that Jesus becomes unto thee the way  of life, and thus thou becomest in him a \"new creature.\" But if thou  continuest to commit thy favorite sins, and remainest unwilling to die to  the corrupt bent of \"the old man\" (Rom. 6:6; Eph. 4:22), how wilt thou  pretend to be a new creature? How is it possible for thee to belong to  Christ, when thou dost not \"crucify the flesh, with its affections and  lusts?\" Gal. 5:24.    15. Even if thou shouldst listen to ten sermons in one day, shouldst  confess thy sins every month, and receive the Lord's Supper, thou wouldst  derive no benefit from such exercises, nor obtain the remission of sins;  the reason is, that thou hast not a penitent, contrite, and believing  heart, which can be reached by the healing influences of the medicine. The  Word of God and the Sacraments are, indeed, salutary remedies; but they  are such to those alone who unfeignedly repent and believe. What would it  profit, to anoint a stone with costly ointment? What harvest shalt thou  reap, if thou sowest among briers and thorns? First pull up the thorns and  thistles that choke the good seed, and, then, thou mayest reasonably  expect the precious fruit. Luke 8:7. And, in fine, Christ will never  profit thee at all, if thou continuest to love sin rather than Him. The  _birth_ of the Saviour is of no advantage to a man whose aim it is not to  be _born_ with him; nor shall his _death_ avail for any, who are not  disposed to _die_ to sin, and to mortify the deeds of the flesh. Rom.  6:11. So, the _resurrection_ of Christ will benefit none who will not  _rise_ from sin, and live unto righteousness; nor will his _ascension_  prove a blessing to any who refuse to _ascend_ with him, and to have their  conversation in heaven.    16. But when, on the contrary, a man, like the Prodigal Son, truly returns  to his offended father, deploring, hating, and forsaking his sins; when he  earnestly seeks forgiveness, and, with the eye of faith, beholds Christ  and his bleeding wounds, as the Israelites beheld the serpent of brass,  and lived (Numb. 21:9); when, at last, under a real sense of guilt, he  cries out with the penitent publican, \"God be merciful to me a sinner\"  (Luke 18:13); then, _then_, the pardon is granted, the absolution is  sealed, however great and many the sins be which he has committed against  his God.    17. Such is the efficacy of the redemption which the blood of Christ has  effected, and of so extensive a nature is his merit, that it is fully  imputed, through faith, to every penitent soul. Thus is brought to pass  the scripture, \"He giveth repentance and forgiveness of sins\" (Acts 5:31);  that is, he pardons the repentant sinner freely and wholly, for Christ's  sake. For it is a pleasure with God to exercise mercy, and to forgive a  sinner. \"My bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon  him, saith the Lord.\" Jer. 31:20; Hosea 11:8. Then it is, that the death  of Christ is rendered truly effectual; and then it is, that the angels of  God rejoice in heaven (Luke 15:7), because the blood of Christ was not  shed in vain for the poor sinner for whom He had died. 1 Cor. 8:11.          Chapter IX.          The Unchristian Walk Of Many Persons In Our Day, Is A Cause Of The                  Rejection Of Christ And Of The True Faith.          _Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof._--2.      TIM. 3:5.      Every one calls himself by the Christian name, even though he do not  perform the least part of what he thereby professes; and, by this means,  the Saviour is denied, contemned, blasphemed, scourged, crucified, and, as  it were, cast out of the sight of men, as dead. The Apostle expressly  declares, that some persons \"crucify the Son of God afresh.\" Heb. 6:6.    2. Would to God that Christ were not, even in _our_ days, crucified again  and again among those who call themselves after his name, and honor him  with their lips; and yet, by their anti-christian lives and actions,  utterly reject and deny him. His most holy, humble, and exemplary life is,  at this day, to be found among but few; and wherever there is not the  _life_ of Christ, _there_ Christ is not himself, however loudly the faith  and the doctrine may be commended. For the Christian faith without a  Christian life is a tree without fruit. True faith works by love (Gal.  5:6); and wherever it is found, there Christ dwells, with all his divine  graces and virtues. Eph. 3:17.    3. But when these are not expressed in the lives of those who profess his  doctrine, there Christ himself is rooted up and denied; for it is only  where true faith exists that Christ dwells.    4. Now Christ hath said, \"Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I  also deny before my Father and the angels.\" Matt. 10:33; Luke 12:9. This  denial of Christ is not only made in words (as by those who renounce  Christ and Christianity), but it is also done when, by our lives and  actions, we wilfully sin against the Saviour and resist the Holy Ghost.  St. Paul speaks of some who \"profess that they know God, but _in works  deny him_\" (Tit. 1:16); and it is certain that Christ is no less denied by  a wicked and satanic life, than he is by a verbal abjuration. It is with  hypocrisy and an empty profession of the faith as it is with open  wickedness; and this is strikingly illustrated by our Lord's parable of  the two sons, who were commanded by their father to go and work in his  vineyard. The one (_openly_ denying) said, \"I will not;\" while the other  (_professing_ obedience) said, \"I go, sir,\" and went not. Matt. 21:28-30.    5. This is a forcible representation of those Christians who make religion  to consist in empty profession without obedience. They will cry \"Yea,  yea,\" and \"Lord, Lord!\" (Matt. 7:21), and yet are worse than others,  because they pretend to be children of the Father, and yet do not, in any  respect, obey his will. Their character is thus given by St. Paul: \"Having  a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.\" 2 Tim. 3:5. Now, what  is it to deny the power of godliness but to deny Christ himself, and to  shake off allegiance to him, and thus to act the part of a heathen under  the mask and name of a Christian? These are \"the children of unbelief or  disobedience,\" in whom the spirit, not of Christ, but _of this world_,  worketh. Eph. 2:2. They, therefore, who usurp a Christian's name, and yet  do not a Christian's work, shall be denied, in their turn, by the Saviour  when he shall pronounce the sentence: \"I never knew you: depart from me,  ye that work iniquity.\" Matt. 7:23.          Chapter X.        The Children Of The World Are Against Christ, And, Consequently, Their              Life And Their Christianity Are Both Alike False.          _He that is not with me is against me._--MATT. 12:30.      If the conduct of the generality of men in the present age be examined by  the standard of life and doctrine left us by Christ, we must soon come to  the conclusion that it is wholly _unchristian_, and totally repugnant to  his example. The lives of men in our day are, in too many cases, made up  of insatiable avarice, sordid and self-seeking manners,  worldly-mindedness, worldly cares, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the  eye, and the pride of life; disobedience, wrath, strife, hatred, malice,  contentions, and a violent thirst after human applause, pomps, and  dignities. Add to these the jealousies, the revenge, the secret feuds and  envyings, the unforgiving spirit, the injustice and hypocrisy, the frauds  and calumnies, the lies and perjuries, together with all the impurity and  unrighteousness with which the world so exceedingly abounds. In short, the  whole life of the children of this generation consists of the love of the  world, self-love, self-honor, and self-seeking.    2. To all this the life of Christ is entirely opposed; it can have no sort  of communion with it. His life is nothing else but pure and sincere love  to God and men. It is composed of humanity and kindness, of meekness and  patience, of humility and obedience even unto death, of mercy and  righteousness, of truth and simplicity, of purity and holiness, of  contempt of the world, its honors, wealth, and pleasures; of self-denial;  of the cross, tribulations, and afflictions; of fervent desires after the  kingdom of God, and after the fulfilment of the divine will. This is the  life of Christ, to which the false Christianity of the present age is so  greatly opposed.    3. If, then, it be the truth that he who is not _with_ Christ is accounted  as one that is _against_ him; and he that _standeth_ not _in_ the will of  God, as he that _withstandeth_ it (and we know that this is the meaning of  the language of our Lord himself), it is most evident that the generality  of those who make a public profession of the Christian faith, not being  with Christ, must be against him. They have no communion with him, but are  contrary to him; they are not led by a Christian, but by an antichristian  spirit. Scarcely any, indeed, are to be found who are of one soul, one  will, one mind, and one spirit with him; and yet only these can be  Christ's, or be accounted his disciples. It is in reference to the latter  that the apostle speaks when he says, they have \"the mind of Christ\" (1  Cor. 2:16); and, in another place, \"Let this mind be in you which was also  in Christ Jesus.\" Phil. 2:5. The children of the world have not this mind,  and it is hence certain that they are not _with_ but _against_ Christ. Now  whatever any man's profession and doctrine be, he who is thus _against_  Christ in his life and actions, is most undoubtedly an antichrist. 1 John  2:18.    4. Where, alas! shall we now find true Christians, in the midst of so many  _unchristian_ disorders that universally"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34781"],[0,"An Australian Bird Book: A Pocket Book for Field Use (#19)"],[1,"is made when flying. They are thus able to  approach their prey without giving warning. The Powerful Owl well  deserves its name, as it possesses great strength, and is a formidable  enemy if wounded. However, Owls are, fortunately, seldom shot at.    Like Hawks, Owls catch their prey with and carry it in their feet,  unless the feet are required for climbing. One peculiarity of the feet  is that the bird can reverse one toe, so that it can have three toes  in front and one behind, like most birds, or two in front and two  behind, like Parrots and Cuckoos.    Although not so strong of flight as the Diurnal Birds of Prey (_e.g._,  Hawks), Owls have managed to spread throughout the world, so that  they are found even in New Zealand. The different kinds are not easily  separated, so most people are satisfied when they have classed a  bird as an Owl, though you will probably want to divide them into two  groups--the Owls Proper and the Barn Owls.    ====      [Page 85]        ORDER XVI--STRIGIFORMES, NOCTURNAL BIRDS OF PREY, OWLS.

In addition, there are some groups  which are found in other continents, but which reach their highest  development here. Conspicuous amongst these are Parrots and Cockatoos.  Australians are so accustomed to see these beautiful birds on every  country road, and in cages outside their houses, that they do not  appreciate their beauty or their interest, for \"familiarity breeds  contempt,\" even with bird life.    When one reflects that no figure of a Parrot is found in ancient  Egyptian art, and that no Parrot is mentioned in the Bible, then  one begins to understand the interest of Europeans in these \"spoilt  children\" of the animal world, the \"monkeys of the bird world,\" and  \"the cream of the Australian avifauna.\"    Their tameness, their affection, their entertaining habits, and their  remarkable powers of speech, all help to render Parrots the favorites  amongst birds. The brilliance of their plumage, their intelligence,  and their longevity excite wonder, for Parrots have been known to live  100 years in captivity. Presumably, they would live even longer in a  state of nature. Humboldt recorded, as quoted in Newton's \"Dictionary  of Birds,\" \"that in South America he met with a venerable bird, which  remained the sole possessor of a literally dead language, the  whole tribe of Indians, Atures by name, who spoke it, having become  extinct.\"    Australians will perhaps be surprised to learn that there are no  Parrots or Cockatoos in Europe, and none in Asia, excepting India,  none in Africa north of the Tropic of Cancer, and only two in North  America, and that one of these is rapidly becoming extinct, and  that Africa and India are poor in Parrots. Thus South America and  Australasia alone are left as the lands that contain these interesting  birds in any number. While South America contains the largest  Parrots--the Macaws--all the South American species belong to  one family. In the Australian region six families of Parrots are  represented. Four of them are confined to the region, while but one  species of the fifth family (Cockatoos) is found outside the region.    The Brush-tongued Parrots, or \"Lorikeets,\" are a purely Australian  family. Some of these are very common at times in flowering eucalypts,  even in the public gardens and streets. The Blue Mountain Parrot, very  common at times, is a giant of the family. It has been described as  a \"noble bird, gorgeously apparelled.\" Its vernacular name of  Blue-bellied Lorikeet has been altered to Blue Mountain Lorikeet.  We found these birds nesting in the big sugar-gums bordering Warunda  Creek, Eyre Peninsula. They keenly and noisily resented our curiosity,  and screeched much as we tried to discover them amongst the green  foliage. Though so gaudy, they were picked out with difficulty.  This bird was very troublesome in my garden at Bengworden, near  the Gippsland Lakes, where, when the apples were about the size of  marbles, they tore them to pieces to get the developing \"pips.\" In  common with the other members of the family, they have a swift, direct  flight, and screech much when flying. The \"Green Keets,\" generally  called \"Green Leeks,\" which are so very numerous at times, are often  accompanied by two other Lorikeets, the Little and Purple-crowned  Lorikeets. These green birds hang, head down, among the eucalyptus  leaves, and brush up the honey from the flowers with their brush  tongue. They follow the flowering of the eucalypts from district to  district, and since the eucalypts flower at irregular intervals, these  birds are not so regular in their movements as Swifts, Snipe, Curlews,  Cuckoos, and other migratory birds. For this reason the birds may be  absent from a district for some years, and then suddenly appear again  in great numbers.    Cockatoos are almost confined to the Australian region. This includes  the islands north-west of Australia out to Wallace's line, passing  between Celebes and the Philippine Islands, Celebes and Borneo, and  between the small islands of Lombok and Bali, east of Java. These  islands, though but fifteen miles apart, \"differ far more from each  other in their birds and quadrupeds than do England and Japan. The  birds of the one are extremely unlike those of the other.\" Another  authority says that the faunas of Bali and Lombok are more unlike  than those of South America and Africa. Bali has Woodpeckers, Barbets,  Bulbuls, and Black and White Magpie-Robins, none of which is found  in Lombok, where we find Screaming Cockatoos, Friar-birds, and other  Honey-eaters, and the strange mound-building Megapodes and numerous  other remarkable birds. This narrow strait is over 1000 fathoms in  depth, and is probably one of the most ancient and most permanent  dividing lines in the world. Instead of being united to Asia, it is  probable that Australia has been more recently joined to New Zealand,  South America, and South Africa. Only one Cockatoo transgresses  Wallace's line to the west, and that is found in the Philippine  Islands; evidently it has spread there from the adjacent part of the  Australian region.    The sombre, slow-flying Black Cockatoo is the largest of all  Cockatoos. It is seen fairly often in small companies, especially on  wattles and eucalypts, the wood of which it tears to pieces with its  powerful bill to get the insect larvae feeding there. It is a valuable  forest-saving bird.    The Glossy or Leach Black Cockatoo is named after Dr. Leach, who did a  great amount of work on Australian animals about 100 years ago. "]]]
