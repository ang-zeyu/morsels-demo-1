They are quite substantially made and deeply cupped, very different from  the nests of the Herons. Their eggs are from three to five in number,  vary from grayish ash to pale greenish or bluish in color, blotched with  light brown. Size 2.25 x 1.60. The nesting season is during May and  June. Data.--Tampa Bay, Fla., June 4, 1895. Three eggs. Nest of sticks  and a few weeds in small bushes on an island. Collector, Fred Doane.      185. SCARLET IBIS. _Guara rubra._.    Range.--Occasionally, but not recently met with in the southern states.  Their habitat is tropical America, they being especially abundant along  the Orinoco River in northern South America.    Full plumaged adults of this species are wholly bright scarlet, except  for the primaries, which are black. Their nests are built in  impenetrable thickets, rushes or mangroves, the nests being constructed  like those of the White Ibis. The eggs, too, are very similar to those  of the preceding species, but both the ground color and the markings  average brighter. While still common in some localities, the species is  gradually becoming less abundant, chiefly because of the demand for  their feathers for use in fly-tying.    [Illustration 119: Grayish.]  [Illustration: White Ibis. Scarlet Ibis.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 118    186. GLOSSY IBIS. _Plegadis autumnalis._.    Range.--This tropical and sub-tropical species, is chiefly found in the  Old World. It is occasionally found in southeastern United States where  it sometimes breeds. Its habits, nesting habits and eggs are just the  same as the next species.      187. WHITE-FACED GLOSSY IBIS. _Plegadis guarauna._    Range.--A sub-tropical species found in the southwestern parts of the  United States, rarely found east of the Mississippi.    This species differs from the Glossy Ibis in having the feathers on the  front of the head white, the rest of the plumage is a dull brownish  chestnut, with greenish reflections on the back. As these birds are not  in demand commercially, their numbers have not decreased, and thousands  of them breed in colonies in southern Texas. They build a substantial  nest of reeds and rushes woven about the upright canes, close to the  surface of the water. Their eggs are laid during May, and number from  three to four. They are easily distinguished from those of the Herons,  being of a deeper greenish blue color and averaging more elongate. Size  1.95 x 1.35. Data.--Corpus Christi, Texas, May 26, 1899. Four eggs. Nest  of twigs and rushes on side of river. Collector, F. B. Armstrong.      STORKS and WOOD IBISES  Family CICONIIDAE    188. WOOD IBIS. _Mycteria americana._    Range.--A sub-tropical species which is resident along the Gulf coast  and which strays casually north to New England and Colorado.    This peculiar member of the Stork family has the whole head and part of  the neck bare and covered with numerous scales; the bill is large, long  and heavy; the plumage is white, except for the black primaries and  tail. It is a large bird about four feet in length. They are quite  abundant in swamps along the    [Illustration 120: Glossy Ibis. White-faced Glossy Ibis. Wood Ibis.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 119    Gulf coast, where they place their nests, which are platforms of sticks,  in trees and bushes over the water. They lay three eggs which are white,  and have a rough surface. Size 2.75 x 1.75.      189. JABIRU. _Jabiru mycteria._    This large bird, which is the only true Stork that claims a place in our  avifauna, is a native of South and Central America, wandering north,  casually to Texas. Their nests are large platforms of sticks in very  high trees.      BITTERNS and HERONS Family ARDEIDAE    Herons and Bitterns are long-legged waders, having straight, pointed  bills, and with the head feathered, except for the lores.      190. BITTERN. _Bautaurus lentiginosus._    Range.--United States and southern British provinces, breeding in the  northern half of the United States and wintering in the southern  portion.    This species, with its mottled rusty brownish plumage, is one of the  best known of the Heron family. It is known locally by a great many  names, nearly all of which have reference to the \"booming\" or \"pumping\"  sound made during the mating season. They build their nests in swampy or  marshy places, placing them on the ground, frequently on a tussock,  entirely surrounded by water. The nest proper is only a few grasses  twisted about to form a lining to the hollow. They lay from three to  five eggs of brownish drab. Size 1.95 x 1.50.    They do not breed in colonies, generally, but one or two pairs nesting  in one marsh. Data.--Worcester, Mass., June 3, 1897. Four eggs laid in a  grass lined hollow in middle of a hummock of earth and grass, in middle  of marsh. Collector, James Jackson.    [Illustration 121: Jabiru. Bittern.]  [Illustration: Brownish drab.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 120    191. LEAST BITTERN. _Ixobrychus exilis._    Range.--Common throughout the United States, especially in the eastern  part, and in the southern British provinces.    This small variety of Bittern is very common in the southern portions of  the United States, but less so and locally distributed in the northern  portions of its range. They are very quiet and sly birds, and their  presence is often unsuspected when they are really quite abundant. When  approached, they will remain perfectly quiet, with the body erect and  the head and neck pointed skyward, in which position their yellowish  brown plumage strongly resembles the rushes among which they are found.  Their nests are made of strips of rushes woven about upright stalks,  generally over water. They lay from three to five eggs of a pale bluish  white color. Size 1.20 x .90. Data.--Avery's Island, La., May 1, 1896.  Four eggs. Nest of strips of rushes woven together to form a platform  and fastened to saw grass growing on the bank of a stream. Collector, E.  A. McIlhenny.      191.1. CORY'S LEAST BITTERN. _Ixobrychus neoxenus._    This rare species, of which about twenty specimens are known is probably  resident in Florida, wandering north in the summer, specimens having  been taken in Ontario, Canada, and in several localities in eastern  United States. It is very different from the Least Bittern, having a  more uniform chestnut coloration, especially on the under parts. It is  twelve inches in length. Mr. C. W. Crandall has a set of five eggs of  this species, taken on the Caloosahatchee River, Fla., April 15, 1891,  by S. B. Ladd. Nest was made of grasses and rushes placed in the cane  two feet above the water.    [Illustration 122: Pale bluish gray.]  [Illustration: Least Bittern. Cory's Least Bittern.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 121    192. GREAT WHITE HERON. _Ardea occidentalis._    Range.--This species occurs in the United States regularly, only in the  southern parts of Florida. It is a resident of the West Indies.    This large white Heron is about the same size as the Great Blue Heron;  it has none of the slender plumes found on the smaller White Herons.  These birds are not uncommon in southern Florida, especially on the  Keyes, where they build their nests in company with Great Blue Herons.  Their nesting habits and eggs are very similar to those of the Blue  Heron. Size of eggs 2.25 x 1.80. Data.--Outside of Torch Key, Florida,  June 16, 1899. Nest a platform of sticks about five feet from the  ground, in a mangrove tree. Three eggs. Collector, O. Tollin.      194. GREAT BLUE HERON. _Ardea herodias herodias._    Range.--Nearly the whole of North America, except the extreme north;  resident south of the middle portions of the United States and migratory  north of there.    This handsome Heron is about four feet in length. Its general color is a  bluish gray, relieved by a black crest, primaries and patches on the  sides, and a white crown. In the south they breed in large colonies,  often in company with many other species. In the northern portions of  their range they breed singly or in companies of under a hundred  individuals. They generally place their rude platforms of sticks well up  in trees, near ponds, swamps or rivers, but in the most northerly parts  of their range, where trees are scarce, they often build on the ground.  Unless they are disturbed, they return to the same breeding grounds,  year after year. They lay from three to five eggs of a greenish blue  color. Size 2.50 x 1.50. Data.--Duck Island, Maine, May 20, 1883. Three  eggs. Nest of sticks and twigs, about fifteen feet from the ground.  Collector, R. B. Gray.      194a. NORTHWEST COAST HERON. _Ardea herodias fannini._    This darker sub-species of the breeding is found along the Pacific  coast, north to Sitka, Alaska. Its nests and eggs do not differ from the  former species.    [Illustration 123: Great White Heron. Great Blue Heron.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 122    194b. WARD'S HERON. _Ardea herodias wardi._    This sub-species is a resident in Florida. It is a lighter variety than  the common. It nests together with the Great Blue Heron and its habits  are the same.      195. EUROPEAN HERON. _Ardea cinerea._    This species is only an accidental straggler in Greenland. It is very  similar to our Blue Heron and is the one which was formerly used to  furnish sport for the royalty when falconry was at its height.      196. EGRET. _Herodias egretta._    Range.--Resident in the southern portions of the United States,  straggling northward casually to the northern parts.    This is one of the beautiful Herons which have been sought by plume  hunters till they are upon the verge of extermination.

The gentleman, named Flatly, was in  the habit of inviting members of the Bar to his house when the Court was  held in Limerick. One evening the conversation turned upon matrimony,  and surprise was expressed that their host still remained a bachelor. He  confessed that he never had had the courage to propose to a young lady.  \"Depend upon it,\" said Lysaght, \"if you ask any girl _boldly_ she will  not refuse you, _Flatly_.\"           *       *       *       *       *    O'Flanagan, author of _The Lord Chancellors of Ireland_, writes of  Holmes, an Irish barrister: \"He made us laugh very much one day in the  Queen's Bench. I was waiting for some case in which I was counsel, when  the crier called, 'Pluck and Diggers,' and in came James Scott, Q.C.,  very red and heated, and, throwing his bag on the table within the bar,  he said, 'My lords, I beg to assure your lordships I feel so exhausted I  am quite unable to argue this case. I have been speaking for three hours  in the Court of Exchequer, and I am quite tired; and pray excuse me, my  lords, I must get some refreshment.' The Chief Justice bowed, and said,  'Certainly, Mr. Scott.' So that gentleman left the Court. 'Mr. Holmes,  you are in this case,' said the Chief Justice; 'we'll be happy to hear  you.'--'Really, my lord, I am very tired too,' said Mr. Holmes.  'Surely,' said the Chief Justice, 'you have not been speaking for three  hours in the Court of Exchequer? What has tired you?'--'Listening to Mr.  Scott,' was Holmes' sarcastic reply.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Although rivals in their profession, C. K. Bushe had a great admiration  for Plunket's abilities, and would not listen to any disparagement of  them. One day while Plunket was speaking at the Bar a friend said to  Bushe, \"Well, if it was not for the eloquence, I'd as soon listen to  ----,\" who was a very prosy speaker. \"No doubt,\" replied Bushe, \"just as  the Connaught man said, ''Pon my conscience if it was not for the malt  and the hops, I'd as soon drink ditch water as porter.'\"    There is an impromptu of Bushe's upon two political agitators of the day  who had declined an appeal to arms, one on account of his wife, the  other from the affection in which he held his daughter:        \"Two heroes of Erin, abhorrent of slaughter,      Improved on the Hebrew command--      One honoured his wife, and the other his daughter,      That 'their' days might be long in 'the land.'\"    A young barrister once tried to raise a laugh at the Mess dinner at the  expense of \"Jerry Keller,\" a barrister who was prominent in social  circles of Dublin, and whose cousin, a wine merchant, held the contract  for supplying wine to the Mess cellar. \"I have noticed,\" said the  junior, \"that the claret bottles are growing smaller and smaller at each  Assizes since your cousin became our wine merchant.\"--\"Whist!\" replied  Jerry; \"don't you be talking of what you know nothing about. It's quite  natural the bottles should be growing smaller, because we all know _they  shrink in the washing_.\"    An ingenious expedient was devised to save a prisoner charged with  robbery in the Criminal Court at Dublin. The principal thing that  appeared in evidence against him was a confession, alleged to have been  made by him at the police office. The document, purporting to contain  this self-criminating acknowledgment, was produced by the officer, and  the following passage was read from it:        \"Mangan said he never robbed but twice      Said it was Crawford.\"    This, it will be observed, has no mark of the writer having any notion  of punctuation, but the meaning attached to it was, that        \"Mangan said he never robbed but twice.      _Said it was Crawford._\"    Mr. O'Gorman, the counsel for the prisoner, begged to look at the paper.  He perused it, and rather astonished the peace officer by asserting,  that so far from its proving the man's guilt, it clearly established his  innocence. \"This,\" said the learned gentleman, \"is the fair and obvious  reading of the sentence:        \"Mangan said he never robbed;      _But twice said it was Crawford_.\"    This interpretation had its effect on the jury, and the man was  acquitted.           *       *       *       *       *    There were two barristers at the Irish Bar who formed a singular  contrast in their stature--Ninian Mahaffy was as much above the middle  size as Mr. Collis was below it. When Lord Redsdale was Lord Chancellor  of Ireland these two gentlemen chanced to be retained in the same cause  a short time after his lordship's elevation, and before he was  personally acquainted with the Irish Bar. Mr. Collis was opening the  motion, when the Lord Chancellor observed, \"Mr. Collis, when a barrister  addresses the Court, he must stand.\"--\"I am standing on the bench, my  lord,\" said Collis. \"I beg a thousand pardons,\" said his lordship,  somewhat confused. \"Sit down, Mr. Mahaffy.\"--\"I am sitting, my lord,\"  was the reply to the confounded Chancellor.    A barrister who was present on this occasion made it the subject of the  following epigram:        \"Mahaffy and Collis, ill-paired in a case,      Representatives true of the rattling size ace;      To the heights of the law, though I hope you will rise,      You will never be judges I'm sure of a(s)size.\"    A very able barrister, named Collins, had the reputation of occasionally  involving his adversary in a legal net, and, by his superior subtlety,  gaining his cause. On appearing in Court in a case with the eminent  barrister, Mr. Pigot, Q.C., there arose a question as to who should be  leader, Mr. Collins being the senior in standing at the Bar, Mr. Pigot  being one of the Queen's Counsel. \"I yield,\" said Mr. Collins; \"my  friend holds the honours.\"--\"Faith, if he does, Stephen,\" observed Mr.  Herrick, \"'tis you have all the tricks.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: DANIEL O'CONNELL, \"THE LIBERATOR.\"]    It is told by one of O'Connell's biographers that he never prepared his  addresses to judges or juries--he trusted to the inspiration of the  moment. He had at command humour and pathos, invective and argument; he  was quick-witted and astonishingly ready in repartee, and he brought all  these into play, as he found them serviceable in influencing the bench  or the jury-box.    Lord Manners, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, stopped several of the many  counsels in a Chancery suit by saying he had made up his mind. He, in  fact, lost his temper as each in succession rose, and he declined them  in turn. At last O'Connell, one of the unheard counsel, began in his  deepest and most emphatic tone: \"Well then, my lord, since your lordship  refuses to hear my learned friend, you will be pleased to hear ME\"; and  then he plunged into the case, without waiting for any expression,  assent or dissent, or allowing any interruption. On he went, discussing  and distinguishing, and commenting and quoting, till he secured the  attention of, and evidently was making an impression on, the unwilling  judge. Every few minutes O'Connell would say: \"Now, my lord, my learned  young friend beside me, had your lordship heard him, would have informed  your lordship in a more impressive and lucid manner than I can hope to  do,\" etcetera, until he finished a masterly address. The Lord Chancellor  next morning gave judgment in favour of O'Connell's client.    He was engaged in a will case, the allegation being that the will was a  forgery. The subscribing witness swore that the will had been signed by  the deceased \"while life was in him\"--that being an expression derived  from the Irish language, which peasants who have long ceased to speak  Irish still retain. The evidence was strong in favour of the will, when  O'Connell was struck by the persistency of the man, who always repeated  the same words, \"The life was in him.\" O'Connell asked: \"On the virtue  of your oath, was he alive?\"--\"By the virtue of my oath, the life was  in him.\"--\"Now I call upon you in the presence of your Maker, who will  one day pass sentence on you for this evidence, I solemnly ask--and  answer me at your peril--was there not a live fly in the dead man's  mouth when his hand was placed on the will?\" The witness was taken aback  at this question; he trembled, turned pale, and faltered out an abject  confession that the counsellor was right; a fly had been introduced into  the mouth of the dead man, to allow the witness to swear that \"life was  in him.\"    O'Connell was defending John Connor on a charge of murder. The most  incriminating evidence was the finding of the murderer's hat, left  behind on the road. The all-important question was as to the  identity of the hat as that of the accused man. A constable was  prepared to swear to it. \"You found this hat?\" said O'Connell.  \"Yes.\"--\"You examined it?\"--\"Yes.\"--\"You know it to be the  prisoner's property?\"--\"Yes.\"--\"When you picked it up you saw it  was damaged?\"--\"Yes.\"--\"And looking inside you saw the prisoner's  name, J-O-H-N C-O-N-N-O-R?\" (here he spelt out the name slowly).  \"Yes,\" was the answer. \"There is no name inside at all, my lord,\"  said O'Connell, and the prisoner was saved.           *       *       *       *       *    Explaining to a judge his absence from the Civil Court at the time a  case was heard, in which he should have appeared as counsel, O'Connell  said he could not leave a client in the Criminal Court until the verdict  was given. \"What was it?\" inquired the judge. \"Acquitted,\" responded  O'Connell. \"Then you have got off a wretch who is not fit to live,\" said  the judge.
