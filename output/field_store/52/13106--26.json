Mention is also made of one Mosca, whether a native or foreigner I know  not, as a doubtful disciple of this school. Christ on his way to Mount  Calvary, now in the Academy in Mantua, is certainly a Raffaellesque  picture, but we may rather consider Mosca an imitator and copyist, than  a pupil of Raffaello. In the edition of Palomino, published in London,  1742, I find some others noticed as scholars of Raffaello, who being  born a little before or after 1520, could not possibly belong to him; as  Gaspare Bacerra, the assistant of Vasari; Alfonso Sanchez, of Portugal;  Giovanni di Valencia; Fernando Jannes. It is not unusual to find similar  instances in the history of painting, and the reports have for the most  part originated in the last age. Whenever the artists of a country began  to collect notices of the masters who had preceded them, their style had  become the prevailing taste; and as if human genius could attain no  improvement beyond that which it receives subserviently from another,  every imitator was supposed to be a scholar of the artist imitated, and  every school, arrogating to itself the names of the first masters,  endeavoured to load itself with fresh honours.    [Footnote 26: Hist. Rom. vol. i. ad calcem.]    [Footnote 27: Besides his life by Vasari, another was published by Sig.  Abate Comolli, which I consider posterior to that of Vasari. Memoirs of  him were also collected by Piacenza, Bottari, and other authors whom I  shall notice; and I shall also avail myself of the information derived  from the inspection of his pictures, and their character, and the  various dates of his works.]    [Footnote 28: We find his name written _Io. Sanctis_ in the Nunziata of  Sinigaglia; and it appears that he was born of a father called,  according to the expression of that age, _Santi_ or _Sante_; a name in  common use in many parts of Italy. In support of the surname of Sanzio,  Bottari produces a portrait of Antonio Sanzio, which exists in the  Palazzo Albani, representing him holding in his hands a document, with  the title of _Genealogia Raphaelis Sanctii Urbinatis_. Julius Sanctius  is there named as the head of the family, _familiae quae adhuc Urbini  illustris extat, ab agris dividendis cognomen imposuit_, and was the  progenitor of Antonio. From the latter, and through a Sebastiano, and  afterwards through a Gio. Batista, descends Giovanni, _ex quo ortus est  Raphael qui pinxit a. 1519_. It is also recorded that Sebastiano had a  brother, Galeazzo, _egregium pictorem_, and the father of three  painters, Antonio, Vincenzio, and Giulio, called _maximus pictor_. Thus  in this branch of the Sanzii are enumerated four painters, of whom I do  not find any memorial in Urbino. The family also boasts of a Canon in  divinity, and a distinguished captain of infantry. The anonymous writer  of Comolli confirms this illustrious origin of Raffaello; but it is  highly probable, that in that age, when the forgery of genealogies, as  Tiraboschi observes, was a common practice, he may have adopted it  without any examination. The portrait of Antonio is well executed, but  it has been said that it would have been much more so, if Raffaello had  painted it a year before his death, according to the inscription. If  connoisseurs (who alone ought to decide this point) should be of this  opinion, it may be suspected that the person that counterfeited the hand  of the artist, might also substitute the writing; or we may at least  conclude, that the etymology of Sanzio should be sought for in the word  _Sanctis_, the name of the grandfather of Raffaello, not in _sancire_,  (to divide fields or property). In tom. xxxi. of the Ant. Picene, a will  is produced of Ser Simone di Antonio, in 1477, where a _Magister  Baptista, qu. Peri Sanctis de Peris_, who is called _Pittor di grido e  di eccellenza_, leaves his son Tommaso his heir, to whom is substituted  a son of Antonio his brother, of the name of Francesco. I may remark,  that in this _Batista di Pier Sante de' Pieri_, we may find the surname  of a family different from that of Sanzia. But on this subject I hope we  shall shortly be favoured with more certain information by the Sig.  Arciprete Lazzari, who has obliged me with many valuable contributions  to the present edition of this work.]    [Footnote 29: Condivi, in his Life of Bonarruoti, (num. 67.) assures us  that Michaelangelo was not of a jealous temper, but spoke well of all  artists, not excepting Raffaello di Urbino, \"between whom and himself  there existed, as I have mentioned, an emulation in painting; and the  utmost that he said was, that Raffaello did not inherit his excellences  from nature, but obtained them through study and application.\"]    [Footnote 30: See the Preface to the Life of Raffaello, by Vasari,  _ediz. Senese_, p. 228, where the will is quoted.]    [Footnote 31: Vasari states, that that event occurred either whilst  Michaelangelo was employed upon the Statues in S. Pietro in Vincoli, or  whilst he was painting the vault of the Sistine Chapel, that is, some  years afterwards, when Raffaello was in Rome. To this second opinion,  which is the most common one, I formerly assented; but since, on perusal  of a Brief of Julius II. (Lett. Pittoriche, tom. iii. p. 320) in which  that Pope invites Michaelangelo back to Rome, and promises that  _illaesus, inviolatusque erit_, I am inclined to believe that the Cartoon  was finished in 1506, which is the date of the brief; so that Raffaello,  if he could not see it on his first visit to Florence, might at least  have done so on his second or third.]    [Footnote 32: See Vasari, ed. Sen. tom. v. p. 238, where we find the  Letter written from him to one of his uncles, with all the  provincialisms common to the inhabitants of Urbino and its  neighbourhood.]    [Footnote 33: Malvasia, _Felsina Pittrice_, tom. i. p. 45. There are  some facts, however, in opposition to this letter, and which seem to  prove that Raffaello did not go to Rome until 1510. But the Sig. Abate  Francesconi is now employed in rectifying the chronology of the Life and  Works of Sanzio; and from his critical sagacity we may expect the  solution of this difficulty.]    [Footnote 34: See Le Aggiunte al Vasari.

Piacenza, in his  notes to Baldinucci, tom. xi. p. 371.]    [Footnote 36: In compliance with the wishes of Leo X. he made drawings  of the buildings of Ancient Rome, and accompanied them with  descriptions, employing the compass to ascertain their admeasurement. We  owe this information to Sig. Abate Francesconi, who has restored to  Sanzio a letter, formerly attributed to Castiglione. It is a sort of  dedication of the work to Leo X.; but the work itself and the drawings  are lost; and many of the edifices measured by Raffaello were destroyed  in the following Pontificates. The Abate Morelli has made public a high  eulogium on this work, by a contemporary pen, in the notes to the  Notizia, page 210. It is written by one Marcantonio Michiel, who  asserts, that Raffaello had drawn the ancient buildings of Rome in such  a manner, and shewn their proportions, forms, and ornaments so  correctly, that whoever had inspected them might be said to have seen  Ancient Rome.]    [Footnote 37: In a brief of Leo X. 1514, mentioned by Sig.

But a painter who is the master of his art, elevates or lowers his  style according to his subject. The Sybils are in Raffaello's grandest  style; and that they are amongst his earliest works, is proved from his  having had Timoteo della Vite, as his assistant in them.]    [Footnote 44: Lett.

I have seen a similar subject in the Lauretana, belonging to  the Signori Pirri, in Rome. At Sassoferrato also, on the great altar of  the church of the Capucins, there is a Virgin and child, said to be by  him; but it is more probably by Fra Bernardo Catelani.

With the speed of thought the warning note was sounded along the  whole line, and in a moment the woods seemed alive with turkeys, running  for dear life. In less time than it takes to tell it, that gallinaceous  army had passed out of sight, forever. And the like of it will never  again be possible on this continent.    [Sidenote: _Turkeys and Deer_]    And again, on the morning of the sixth day out, I blundered on to such  an aggregation of deer as a man sees but once in a lifetime. I had  camped over night on low land, among heavy timber, but soon after  striking camp, came to a place where the timber was scattering, and the  land had a gentle rise to the westward. Scarcely had I left the low land  behind, when a few deer got out of their beds and commenced lazily  bounding away. They were soon joined by others; on the right flank, on  the left, and ahead, they continued to rise and canter off leisurely,  stopping at a distance of one or two hundred yards to look back. It  struck me finally that I had started something rather unusual, and I  began counting the deer in sight. It was useless to attempt it; their  white flags were flying in front and on both flanks, as far as one  could see, and new ones seemed constantly joining the procession. Among  them were several very large bucks with superb antlers, and these seemed  very little afraid of the small, quiet biped in leaf-colored rig. They  often paused to gaze back with bold, fearless front, as though inclined  to call a halt and face the music; but when within a hundred yards,  would turn and canter leisurely away. As the herd neared the summit of  the low-lying ridge, I tried to make a reasonable guess at their  numbers, by counting a part and estimating the rest, but could come to  no satisfactory conclusion. As they passed the summit and loped down the  gentle decline toward heavy timber, they began to scatter, and soon not  a flag was in sight. It was a magnificent cervine army with white  banners, and I shall never look upon its like again. The largest drove  of deer I have seen in twenty years consisted of seven only.    And with much of interest, much of tramping, and not a little vexatious  delay, I came at length to a stream that I knew must be the south branch  of the Muskegon. The main river could scarcely be more than ten miles to  the westward, and might be easily reached in one day.    It was time. The meal and pork were nearly gone, sugar and tea were at  low ebb, and I was tired of venison; tired anyhow; ready for human  speech and human companionship.    It was in the afternoon of the ninth day that I crossed the South  Muskegon and laid a course west by north. The travelling was not bad;  and in less than an hour I ran on to the ruins of a camp that I knew to  be the work of Indians. It had evidently been a permanent winter camp,  and was almost certainly the Indian camp spoken of by Bill Hance.  Pausing a short time to look over the ruins, with the lonely feeling  always induced by a decayed, rotting camp, I struck due west and made  several miles before sundown.    I camped on a little rill, near a huge dry stub that would peel, made  the last of the meal into a johnny-cake, broiled the last slice of pork,  and lay down with the notion that a ten days' tramp, where it took an  average of fifteen miles to make six, ought to end on the morrow. At  sunrise I was again on foot, and after three hours of steady tramping,  saw a smoky opening ahead. In five minutes I was standing on the left  bank of the Muskegon.    And the Joe Davis camp--was it up stream or down? I decided on the  latter, and started slowly down stream, keeping an eye out for signs. In  less than an hour I struck a dim log road which led to the river, and  there was a \"landing,\" with the usual debris of skids, loose bark,  chocks, and some pieces of broken boards. It did not take long to  construct an efficient log raft from the dry skids, and as I drifted  placidly down the deep, wild river, munching the last bit of  johnny-cake, I inwardly swore that my next wilderness cruise should be  by water.    It was in late afternoon that I heard--blessed sound--the eager clank,  clank, clank of the old-fashioned sawmill. It grew nearer and more  distinct; presently I could distinguish the rumble of machinery as the  carriage gigged back; then the raft rounded a gentle bend, and a mill,  with its long, log boarding-house, came full in sight.    As the raft swung into the landing the mill became silent; a  brown-bearded, red-shirted fellow came down to welcome me, a pair of  strong hands grasped both my own, and the voice of Joe Davis said  earnestly, \"Why, George! I never was so d--d glad to see a man in my  life!\"    The ten days' tramp was ended. It had been wearisome to a degree, but  interesting and instructive. I had seen more game birds and animals in  the time than I ever saw before or since in a whole season; and, though  I came out with clothes pretty well worn and torn off my back and legs,  I was a little disposed to plume myself on the achievement. Even at this  day I am a little proud of the fact that, with so many temptations to  slaughter, I only fired three shots on the route. Nothing but the  exceptionally fine, dry weather rendered such a trip possible in a  wilderness so cut up with swamps, lakes, marshes and streams. A week of  steady rain or a premature snow storm--either likely enough at that  season--would have been most disastrous; while a forest fire like that  of '56, and later ones, would simply have proved fatal.    Reader, if ever you are tempted to make a similar thoughtless, reckless  trip--don't do it.          Chapter IX--Canoeing         THE LIGHT CANOE AND DOUBLE BLADE--VARIOUS CANOES FOR VARIOUS       CANOEISTS--REASONS FOR PREFERRING THE CLINKER-BUILT CEDAR      The canoe is coming to the front, and canoeing is gaining rapidly in  popular favor, in spite of the disparaging remark that \"a canoe is a  poor man's yacht.\" The canoe editor of _Forest and Stream_ pertinently  says, \"we may as properly call a bicycle 'the poor man's express  train.'\" But, suppose it is the poor man's yacht? Are we to be debarred  from aquatic sports because we are not rich? And are we such weak  flunkies as to be ashamed of poverty? Or to attempt shams and  subterfuges to hide it? For myself, I freely accept the imputation. In  common with nine-tenths of my fellow citizens I am poor--and the canoe  is my yacht, as it would be were I a millionaire. We are a nation of  many millions, and comparatively few of us are rich enough to support a  yacht, let alone the fact that not one man in fifty lives near enough to  yachting waters to make such an acquisition desirable--or feasible,  even. It is different with the canoe. A man like myself may live in the  backwoods, a hundred miles from a decent sized inland lake, and much  further from the sea coast, and yet be an enthusiastic canoeist. For  instance.    Last July I made my preparations for a canoe cruise, and spun out with  as little delay as possible. I had pitched on the Adirondacks as  cruising ground, and had more than 250 miles of railroads and buckboards  to take, before launching the canoe on Moose River. She was carried  thirteen miles over the Brown's Tract road on the head of her skipper,  cruised from the western side of the Wilderness to the Lower St. Regis  on the east side, cruised back again by a somewhat different route, was  taken home to Pennsylvania on the cars, 250 miles, sent back to her  builder, St. Lawrence County, N.Y., over 300 miles, thence by rail to  New York City, where, the last I heard of her, she was on exhibition at  the _Forest and Stream_ office. She took her chances in the baggage car,  with no special care, and is today, so far as I know, staunch and tight,  with not a check in her frail siding.    Such cruising can only be made in a very light canoe, and with a very  light outfit. It was sometimes necessary to make several carries in one  day, aggregating as much as ten miles, besides from fifteen to twenty  miles under paddle. No heavy, decked, paddling or sailing canoe would  have been available for such a trip with a man of ordinary muscle.    The difference between a lone, independent cruise through an almost  unbroken wilderness, and cruising along civilized routes, where the  canoeist can interview farm houses and village groceries for supplies,  getting gratuitous stonings from the small boy, and much reviling from  ye ancient mariner of the towpath--I say, the difference is just  immense. Whence it comes that I always prefer a very light, open canoe;  one that I can carry almost as easily as my hat, and yet that will float  me easily, buoyantly, and safely. And such a canoe was my last cruiser.  She only weighed ten and one-half pounds when first launched, and after  an all-summer rattling by land and water had only gained half a pound. I  do not therefore advise any one to buy a ten and a half pound canoe;  although she would prove competent for a skillful light-weight. She was  built to order, as a test of lightness and was the third experiment in  that line.    I have nothing to say against the really fine canoes that are in highest  favor today. Were I fond of sailing, and satisfied to cruise on routes  where clearings are more plentiful than carries, I dare say I should run  a Shadow, or Stella Maris, at a cost of considerably more than  $100--though I should hardly call it a \"poor man's yacht.\"    Much is being said and written at the present day as to the \"perfect  canoe.\" One writer decides in favor of a Pearl 15x31-1/2 inches. In the  same column another says, \"the perfect canoe does not exist.\" I should  rather say there are several types of the modern canoe, each nearly  perfect in its way and for the use to which it is best"]]]
