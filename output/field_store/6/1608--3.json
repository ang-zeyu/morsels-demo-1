Then they wanted to change their horses for his,  but he said they had had first choice and he was not going to change.    In two or three years the monkey boy became rich and then he announced  that he wanted to marry; this puzzled his mother for she thought that  no human girl would marry him while a monkey would not be able to talk;  so she told him that he must find a bride for himself. One day he set  off to look for a wife and came to a tank in which some girls were  bathing, and he took up the cloth belonging to one of them and ran  up a tree with it, and when the girl missed it and saw it hanging  down from the tree she borrowed a cloth from her friends and went  and asked the monkey boy for her own; he told her that she could only  have it back if she consented to marry him; she was surprised to find  that he could talk and as he conversed she was bewitched by him and  let him pull her up into the tree by her hair, and she called out to  her friends to go home and leave her where she was. Then he took her  on his back and ran off home with her.    The girl's father and relations turned out with bows and arrows to  look for the monkey who had carried her off but he had gone so far  away that they never found him. When the monkey boy appeared with his  bride all the villagers were astonished that he had found anyone to  marry him, but everything was made ready for the marriage as quickly  as possible and all the relations were invited and the wedding took  place and the monkey boy and his wife lived happily ever after.          XVI. The Miser's Servant.    Once there was a rich man who was a miser. Although he kept farm  servants they would never stay out the year with him; but ran away in  the middle. When the villagers asked why they ran away and so lost  their year's wages the servants answered. \"You would do the same in  our place: at the busy time of the year he speaks us fair and feeds  us well, but directly the crops are gathered he begins to starve us;  this year we have had nothing to eat since September.\"    And the villagers said \"Well, that is a good reason, a man can  stand scolding but not starvation; we all work to fill our bellies,  hunger is the worst disease of all.\" The news that the miser made his  servants work for nothing spread throughout the neighbourhood so he  could get no servants near by and when he brought them from a distance  they soon heard of his character and ran away. Men would only work  for him on daily wages and because of his miserliness they demanded  higher wages than usual from him and would not work without. Now  there was a young fellow named Kora who heard all this and he said  \"If I were that man's servant I would not run away. I would get the  better of him; ask him if he wants a servant and if he says, yes,  take me to him.\" The man to whom Kora told this went to the miser  and informed him that Kora was willing to engage himself to him;  so Kora was fetched and they had a drink of rice beer and then the  miser asked Kora whether he would work for the full year and not run  away in the middle. Kora said that he would stay if he were satisfied  with the wages. The master said \"I will fix your wages when I see  your work; if you are handy at every thing I will give you 12 _Kats_  of rice and if you are only a moderate worker then 9 or 10 _Kats_  besides your clothes. How much do you ask for?\"    And Kora said \"Well, listen to me: I hear that your servants run away  in the middle of the year because you give them so little to eat, all  I ask for my wages is that you give me once a year one grain of rice  and I will sow it and you must give me low land to plant all the seed  that I get from it; and give me one seed of maize and I will sow it for  seed, and you must give me upland to sow all the seed I get from it;  and give me the customary quantity of clothes, and for food give me  one leaf full of rice three times a day. I only want what will go on a  single leaf, you need not sew several leaves together into a plate. I  will ask for no second helping but if you do not fill the leaf full  I shall have the right to abuse you, and if I do not do all the work  you give me properly, then you can abuse me and beat me. If I run away  from fear of hard work you may cut off the little finger of my right  hand, and if you do not give me the wages we have agreed upon then I  shall have the right to cut off the little finger of your hand. What  do you say to this proposal: consult your friends and give me your  answer.\" Then the miser answered \"I engage you on these terms and if  I turn you off without reason you may cut off my little finger.\" Then  Kora turned to the man who had fetched him and said \"Listen to all  this: if there is any dispute hereafter you will be my witness.\"    So Kora began to work and the first day they gave him rice on a  single _sal_ leaf and he ate it up in one mouthful: but the next  day he brought a plantain leaf (_which is some three feet long_)  and said \"Give me my rice on this and mind you fill it full.\" And  they refused: but he said \"Why not? it is only a single leaf\" and  they had to give in because he was within his rights; so he ate as  much as he wanted, and every day he brought a plantain leaf till his  master's wife got tired and said to her husband \"Why have you got a  servant like this--he takes a whole pot of rice to himself every day,\"  but he answered \"Never mind: his wages are nothing, he is working for  his keep alone;\" so the whole year Kora got his plantain leaf filled  and he was never lazy over his work so they could find no fault with  him on that score, and when the year was up they gave him one grain  of rice and one seed of maize for his wages for the year. Kora kept  them carefully, and his master's sons laughed at him and said \"Mind  you don't drop them or let a mouse eat them.\"    Kora said nothing but when the time for sowing maize came he took his  grain of maize and sowed it by the dung heap, and he called them to  see where he sowed it; and at the time of sowing rice he sowed his  grain separately, and when the time for transplanting came he planted  his rice seedling in a hollow and bade them note it. When the maize  ripened it was found that his plant had two big cobs and one small  one on it, and his rice seedling sent up a number of ears; and when  it ripened he cut it and threshed it and got one _pai_ of rice, and he  kept the maize and rice for seed. And the next year also he sowed this  seed separately and it produced a big basket of rice and another one  of maize, and he kept this also for seed; and in the course of five  or six years he had taken all their high lands to sow his seed in  and in a few years more he had taken all their rice lands too. Then  his master was very miserable but he saw that it was useless to make  any complaint and the master became so poor that he had to work as  a servant to Kora. At last the miser called the heads of the village  together and wept before them, and they had pity on him and interceded  for him; but Kora said \"It is God who has punished him and not I; he  made poor men work for nothing for so long and now he has to suffer;\"  but they asked him to be merciful and give him some land, and he agreed  and said \"Cut off his little finger and I will let him off his bargain;  and call all the servants whom he has defrauded and I will pay them\"  but the miser would not have his finger cut off; then Kora said \"Let  him keep his finger and I will give him back half his land.\" The miser  agreed to this and promised to treat his servants well in future,  and in order to lessen his shame he married his daughter to Kora;  and he had to admit that it was by his own folly that this trouble  had befallen him.          XVII. Kuwar and the Raja's Daughter.    There was once a rich merchant who lived in a Raja's city; and the  Raja founded a school in order that his own children might have some  education, and the boys and the girls of the town used to go to the  school as well as the Raja's sons and daughters and among them the  rich merchant's son, whose name Was Kuwar. In the course of time the  children all learned to read and write. In the evenings all the boys  used to mount their horses and go for a ride.    Now it happened that Kuwar and the Raja's daughter fell in love with  each other and she wrote him a letter saying that if he did not marry  her she would forcibly install herself in his house. He wrote back  and begged her not to come to his house as this would be the ruin of  his family; but he said that he would willingly run away with her to  a distant country, and spend his whole life with her, if she would  overlook the fact that they were of different castes; and if she  agreed to this they must settle to what country to go. Somehow news  of their intention got about, and the Raja was told that his daughter  was in love with the merchant's son. Then the Raja gave orders that  his daughter was not to be allowed to go outside the palace, and the  merchant spoke severely to Kuwar and neither of them was allowed to  go to the school any more. But one day the princess went to the place  where the Raja's horses were tied up and among them was a mare named  Piyari and she went up to the mare and said \"You have eaten our salt  for a long time, will you now requite me?\" And Piyari said \"Certainly  I will!\". Then the princess asked \"If I mount you, will you jump  over all these horses and this wall and escape?\" And the mare said  \"Yes, but you will have to hold on very tight.\" The princess said  \"That is my look-out: it is settled that on the day I want you you  will jump over the wall and escape.\" Then she wrote a letter to Kuwar  and gave it to her maid-servant to deliver into Kuwar's own hands,  without letting anyone know: and in the letter she fixed a day for  their elopement and told Kuwar to wait "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11951"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 1 (#10)"],[1,"(Via Donaitia), and less  than sixty years after Cisalpine Gaul had been reduced to a Roman  province, Rome possessed, in Transalpine Gaul, a second province, whither  she sent her armies, and where she established her citizens without  obstruction.  But Providence seldom allows men, even in the midst of  their successes, to forget for long how precarious they are; and when He  is pleased to remind them, it is not by words, as the Persians reminded  their king, but by fearful events that He gives His warnings.  At the  very moment when Rome believed herself set free from Gallic invasions,  and on the point of avenging herself by a course of conquest, a new  invasion, more extensive and more barbarous, came bursting upon Rome and  upon Gaul at the same time, and plunged them together in the same  troubles and the same perils.    In the year 113 B.C. there appeared to the north of the Adriatic, on the  right bank of the Danube, an immense multitude of barbarians, ravaging  Noricum and threatening Italy.  Two nations predominated; the Kymrians or  Cimbrians, and the Teutons, the national name of the Germans.  They came  from afar, northward, from the Cimbrian peninsula, nowadays Jutland, and  from the countries bordering on the Baltic which nowadays form the  duchies of Holstein and Schleswig.  A violent shock of earthquake, a  terrible inundation, had driven them, they said, from their homes; and  those countries do indeed show traces of such events.  And Cimbrians and  Teutons had been for some time roaming over Germany.    The consul Papirius Carbo, despatched in all haste to defend the  frontier, bade them, in the name of the Roman people, to withdraw.  The  barbarians modestly replied that they had no intention of settling in  Noricum, and if the Romans had rights over the country, they would carry  their arms elsewhere.  The consul, who had found haughtiness succeed,  thought he might also employ perfidy against the barbarians.  He offered  guides to conduct them out of Noricum; and the guides misled them.  The  consul attacked them unexpectedly during the night, and was beaten.    However, the barbarians, still fearful, did not venture into Italy.  They roamed for three years along the Danube, as far as the mountains of  Macedonia and Thrace.  Then retracing their steps, and marching eastward,  they inundated the valleys of the Helvetic Alps, now Switzerland, having  their numbers swelled by other tribes, Gallic or German, who preferred  joining in pillage to undergoing it.  The Ambrons, among others, a Gallic  peoplet that had taken refuge in Helvetia after the expulsion of the  Umbrians by the Etruscans from Italy, joined the Cimbrians and Teutons;  and in the year 110 B.C.  all together entered Gaul, at first by way of  Belgica, and then, continuing their wanderings and ravages in central  Gaul, they at last reached the Rhone, on the frontiers of the Roman  province.    There the name of Rome again arrested their progress; they applied to her  anew for lands, with the offer of their services.  \"Rome,\" answered  M. Silanus, who commanded in the province, \"has neither lands to give you  nor services to accept from you.\"  He attacked them in their camp, and  was beaten.    Three consuls, L. Cassius, C. Servilius Omepio, and Cu. Manlius,  successively experienced the same fate.  With the barbarians victory bred  presumption.  Their chieftains met and deliberated whether they should  not forthwith cross into Italy, to exterminate or enslave the Romans,  and make Kymrian spoken at Rome.  Scaurus, a prisoner, was in the tent,  loaded with fetters, during the deliberation.  He was questioned about  the resources of his country.  \"Cross not the Alps,\" said he; \"go not  into Italy: the Romans are invincible.\"  In a transport of fury the  chieftain of the Kymrians, Boiorix by name, fell upon the Roman, and ran  him through.  Howbeit the advice of Scaurus was followed.  The barbarians  did not as yet dare to decide upon invading Italy; but they freely  scoured the Roman province, meeting here with repulse, and there with  re-enforcement from the peoplets who formed the inhabitants.  The  Tectosagian Voles, Hymrian in origin and maltreated by Rome, joined them.  Then, on a sudden, whilst the Teutons and Ambrons remained in Gaul, the  Kymrians passed over to Spain without apparent motive, and probably as an  overswollen torrent divides, and disperses its waters in all directions.  The commotion at Rome was extreme; never had so many or such wild  barbarians threatened the Republic; never had so many or such large Roman  armies been beaten in succession.  There was but one man, it was said,  who could avert the danger, and give Rome the ascendency.  It was Marius,  low-born, but already illustrious; esteemed by the Senate for his genius  as a commander and for his victories; swaying at his will the people, who  saw in him one of themselves, and admired without envying him; beloved  and feared by the army for his bravery, his rigorous discipline, and his  readiness to share their toils and dangers; stern and rugged; without  education, eloquence, or riches; ill-suited for shining in public  assemblies, but resolute and dexterous in action; verily made to dominate  the vigorous but unrefined multitude, whether in camp or city, partly by  participating their feelings, partly by giving them in his own person a  specimen of the deserts and sometimes of the virtues which they esteem  but do not possess.    He was consul in Africa, where he was putting an end to the war with  Jugurtha.  He was elected a second time consul, without interval and in  his absence, contrary to all the laws of the Republic.  Scarcely had he  returned, when, on descending from the Capitol, where he had just  received a triumph for having conquered and captured Jugurtha, he set out  for Gaul.  On his arrival, instead of proceeding, as his predecessors,  to attack the barbarians at once, he confined himself to organizing and  inuring his troops, subjecting them to frequent marches, all kinds of  military exercises, and long and hard labor.  To insure supplies he made  them dig, towards the mouths of the Rhone, a large canal which formed a  junction with the river a little above Arles, and which, at its entrance  into the sea, offered good harborage for vessels.  This canal, which  existed for a long while under the name of Rossae Mariance (the dikes of  Marius), is filled up nowadays; but at its southern extremity the village  of Foz still preserves a remembrance of it.  Trained in this severe  school, the soldiers acquired such a reputation for sobriety and  laborious assiduity, that they were proverbially called Marius's mules.    He was as careful for their moral state as for their physical fitness,  and labored to exalt their imaginations as well as to harden their  bodies.  In that camp, and amidst those toils in which he kept them  strictly engaged, frequent sacrifices, and scrupulous care in consulting  the oracles, kept superstition at a white heat.  A Syrian prophetess,  named Martha, who had been sent to Marius by his wife Julia, the aunt of  Julius Caesar, was ever with him, and accompanied him at the sacred  ceremonies and on the march, being treated with the greatest respect, and  having vast influence over the minds of the soldiers.    Two years rolled on in this fashion; and yet Marius would not move.  The  increasing devastation of the country, fire, and famine, the despair and  complaints of the inhabitants, did not shake his resolution.  Nor was the  confidence he inspired both in the camp and at Rome a whit shaken: he was  twice re-elected consul, once while he was still absent, and once during  a visit he paid to Rome to give directions to his party in person.    It was at Rome, in the year 102 B.C., that he learned how the Kymrians,  weary of Spain, had recrossed the Pyrenees, rejoined their old comrades,  and had at last resolved, in concert, to invade Italy; the Kymrians from  the north, by way of Helvetia and Noricum, the Teutons and Ambrons from  the south, by way of the maritime Alps.  They were to form a junction on  the banks of the Po, and thence march together on Rome.  At this news  Marius returned forthwith to Gaul, and, without troubling himself about  the Kymrians, who had really put themselves in motion towards the  north-east, he placed his camp so as to cover at one and the same time  the two Roman roads which crossed at Arles, and by one of which the  Ambro-Teutons must necessarily pass to enter Italy on the south.    They soon appeared \"in immense numbers,\" say the historians, \"with their  hideous looks and their wild cries,\" drawing up their chariots and  planting their tents in front of the Roman camp.  They showered upon  Marius and his soldiers continual insult and defiance.  The Romans, in  their irritation, would fain have rushed out of their camp, but Marius  restrained them.  \"It is no question,\" said he, with his simple and  convincing common sense, \"of gaining triumphs and trophies; it is a  question of averting this storm of war and of saving Italy.\"  A Teutonic  chieftain came one day up to the very gates of the camp, and challenged  him to fight.  Marius had him informed that if he were tired of life he  could go and hang himself.  As the barbarian still persisted, Marius sent  him a gladiator.    However, he made his soldiers, in regular succession, mount the ramparts,  to get them familiarized with the cries, looks, arms, and movements of  the barbarians.  The most distinguished of his officers, young Sertorius,  who understood and spoke Gallic well, penetrated, in the disguise of a  Gaul, into the camp of the Ambrons, and informed Marius of what was going  on there.    At last the barbarians, in their impatience, having vainly attempted to  storm the Roman camp, struck their own, and put themselves in motion  towards the Alps.  For six whole days, it is said, their bands were  defiling"]]]
