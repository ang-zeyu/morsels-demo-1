MR. STAPYLTON OVERTAKES THE PARTY.    We had not proceeded far beyond that ridge when Mr. Stapylton overtook  the party, having travelled in great haste from Sydney to join us as  second in command, in compliance with my letter of instructions sent from  Buree. Mr. Stapylton was accompanied by two stockmen, having left his own  light equipments at Cordowe, a station above Mount Cunningham. On the  plains which we crossed this day grew in great abundance that beautiful  species of lily found in the expedition of 1831, and already mentioned  under the name of Calostemma candidum,* also the Calostemma luteum of Ker  with yellow flowers.    (*Footnote. Volume 1. C. candidum; floribus centralibus subsessilibus,  articulo infra medium in pedicellis longioribus, corona integerrima.)    At nine miles we crossed some granite rocks, evidently a part of the  ridge of Tarratta, thus exhibiting a uniformity in the granite with the  general direction of other ridges, which is about north-north-east. The  strike is between north and north-east; the dip in some places being to  the west, and in others to the east, at great inclinations. The ridge of  Kalingalungaguy consists of quartz, clay-slate, and the ferruginous  sandstone, but I observed in the bed of the river a trap-dyke extending  to the Bolloon ridge. Of the few low hills about the Lachlan it may be  observed that they generally range in lines crossing the bed of that  river. Mount Amyot is a ridge of this sort, being connected to the  southward with Mount Stewart and Nyororong; and to the northward with the  high ground separating the Bogan from the Goobang; the latter creek also  forcing its way through the same chain on its course westward. Mounts  Cunningham, Melville, and the small hills about them on each bank belong  to another system of ridges of similar character, but more broken up; and  the range of Kalingalungaguy with that of Bolloon form a third, also  intersected by the river.    OF THE PLAINS IN GENERAL.    The plains appear to be divided into several stages by these cross  ridges, which may have shut up the water of high floods in extensive  lakes during the existence of which the deposits formed the surface of  the present plains. Loose red sand also constantly forms low hills on the  borders of these plains; and it seems to have been derived from the  decomposition of the sandstone, and may be a diluvial or lacustrine  deposit. Blue clay appears in the lowest parts of the basin, and forms  the level parts of the plain, with concretions of marl in thin layers.  This has every appearance of a mud deposit; but its depth is greater than  the lowest part visible in the channel of the river. The parallel course  of small tributaries joining rivers, which seem to be the middle drain of  extensive plains, may have been marked out during the deposition of the  sedimentary matter as tributaries, on entering the channel of greater  streams, immediately become a portion of them; hence it is, the general  inclination being common to both, that such tributaries do not cross  these sediments of floods now termed plains in order to join the main  channel or river now remaining.    CHARACTER OF THE GOOBANG AND BOGAN.    Thus the Goobang, on entering the valley of the Lachlan, pursues a  parallel course until the ridge from Hurd's peak confines the plain on  the west and turns the Goobang into the main channel. The Bogan, on the  opposite side of the high land, may be said to belong to the basin of the  Macquarie, although it never joins that river, but merely skirts the  plains which, below Cambelego, may be all supposed to belong to the  original bed of the Macquarie. Throughout its whole course of 250 miles  the left bank of the Bogan is close to low hills, while the right adjoins  the plains of the Macquarie. The basin of the Macquarie, as shown by its  course near Mount Harris and Morrisset's ponds, falls northward, but that  of the Darling to the south-west. It is not at all surprising therefore  that the course of a tributary so much opposed, as the Macquarie is, to  that of the main stream, should spread into marshes: still less that, on  being at length choked with the deposit filling up these marshes, it  should work out for itself a channel less opposed to the course of the  main stream. Duck creek appears to be now the channel by which the floods  of the Macquarie join the Darling, and in a course much more direct than  that through the marshes. Hence the Bogan also, being still less opposed  to that of the Darling, finally enters that river without presenting the  anomaly of an invisible channel. In like manner, at a much lower point on  the Darling, the course of the little stream named Shamrock ponds, so  remarkable in this respect, may be understood. This forms a chain of  ponds, or a flowing stream, according to the seasons, between the plains  on the left bank of the Darling, and the rising grounds further to the  eastward: but instead of crossing the plains to join the main channel  this supposed tributary, after approaching within one or two miles of the  Darling where its plains were narrow, again receded from it as they  widened, and finally disappeared to the left where the plains were broad,  so that its junction with the Darling has not even yet been discovered.  On this principle the channel of the Lachlan, as soon as it enters the  plains belonging to the basin of the Murrumbidgee, may be sought for on  the northern skirts of these plains, although its floods may have been  found to spread in different channels more directly towards the main  stream.    At 12 1/4 miles we crossed a dry and shallow branch of the river, and at  14 1/2 miles we at length reached the main channel, and encamped where a  considerable pond of water remained in it, surrounded by abundance of  good grass. In this hole we caught some cod-perch (Gristes peelii).    April 12.    I sent back three men with two horses to bring on the light cart of Mr.  Stapylton, intending to await its arrival (which I expected would be in  five days) at the end of this day's journey. It was my object to encamp  as near as possible to Regent's Lake without diverging from the route  which I wished to follow with the carts, along the bank of the Lachlan.    WANT OF WATER IN THE RIVER.    For this purpose it was desirable to gain a bend of that river at least  as far west as the most western portion of the lake, according to Mr.  Oxley's survey. This distance we accomplished and more; for we were  obliged to proceed several miles further than I intended, and along the  bank of the river, because no water remained in its bed, until Mr.  Stapylton found a good pond where we encamped after a journey of 16 1/4  miles. Notwithstanding such an alarming want of water in the river, we  saw during this day's journey abundance in hollows on the surface of the  plains; a circumstance clearly evincing that this river, as Mr. Oxley has  truly stated, is not at all dependent for its supply on the rains falling  here. The deep cracks on the plains, so abundant as to impede the  traveller, seemed capable of absorbing not only the water which falls  upon them, but also any which may descend from the low hills around.  During our day's journey I found grey porphyry, the base consisting  apparently of granular felspar with embedded crystals of common felspar  and grains of hornblende.    April 13.    The night had been unusually warm, so much so that the thermometer stood  during the whole of it at 76 degrees (the usual noonday heat) and so  parching was the air that no one could sleep. A hot wind blew from the  north-east in the morning, and the barometer fell 4/10 of an inch; there  were also slight showers.    CUDJALLAGONG OR REGENT'S LAKE.    Leaving Mr. Stapylton in charge of the camp I went with a small mounted  party to Cudjallagong (Regent's lake) which I found to be nine miles to  the east-south-east of our tents. We passed by the place where  Cudjallagong creek first leaves the river and by which this lake is  supplied.    NEARLY DRY.    The uniformity of breadth and width in this streamlet and its tortuous  course were curious, especially as it must lead the floods of the Lachlan  almost directly back from the general direction of their current to  supply a lake. Thus the fluviatile process seemed to be reversed here,  the tendency of this river being not to carry surface waters off, but  rather to spread over land where none could otherwise be found, those  brought from a great distance. The particular position of this portion of  depressed surface being so far distant from the general course of the  river and the communication between it and the river by a backwater so  shallow and small, the lake can only receive a small share of the river  deposits and this only from the waters of its highest floods. We found  the \"noble lake\" (as it appeared when discovered by Mr. Oxley) now for  the most part a plain covered with luxuriant grass; some water, it is  true, lodged on the most eastern extremity, but nowhere to a greater  depth than a foot. Innumerable ducks took refuge there and also a great  number of black swans and pelicans, the last standing high upon their  legs above the remains of Regent's lake. We found the water perfectly  sweet even in this shallow state. It abounds with the large freshwater  mussel which was the chief food of the natives at the time we visited it.    DEAD TREES IN IT.    On its northern margin and a good way within the former boundary of the  lake stood dead trees of a full-grown size which had been apparently  killed by too much water, plainly showing, like the trees similarly  situated in Lake George and Lake Bathurst, to what long periods the  extremes of drought and moisture have extended, and may again extend, in  this singular country.

I saw him by the roadside lay    His sunken head upon a stone,    And while he slumbered, still and lone,    A dream fell on him, fair as day.      I saw a golden ladder reach    From earth to heaven among the stars,    And up and down its gleaming bars    Trod stately angels, without speech.      What wonders did I not behold!

Lord  Brougham, in addition to other curious phenomena, has discovered that  the ray, when once diflected, cannot be again diflected in the same  direction, but may be diflected in an opposite direction.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM THE SPECTATOR, OF JUNE 15.]    LIFE OF THE AUTHOR OF 'TREMAINE.'[3]    The literary success of the author of _Tremaine_ was owing to the  worldly experience and means of observation which his official  position gave him; but the sole interest which he possesses in  the eyes of the world arises from his success as an author. As an  office-holder, he was not a mere red-tapist, but one of those able,  hard-working, experienced administrative men, who really carry on  the business of government, and, except in the case of rare ability  and courage in a \"chief,\" are masters of the Ministers, though want  of interest, ambition, or \"gift of the gab,\" retains them in a  subordinate post. As an author, Mr. Ward's temporary success was  greater than his permanent prospects. His subjects were generally  large enough, he was a man of extensive reading, and his tastes took  in a wide range; but he was essentially bounded by the present. His  earlier works, which procured him the patronage of Pitt, and with it a  seat in Parliament and office, were on the Law of Nations: and though  their most attractive part related to a temporary subject, the rights  of belligerents and neutrals, there was enough in that branch of the  subject to secure duration; but who reads them now? how few, indeed,  know of their existence? He cannot be said to have originated the  serio-didactic novel, for Hannah More and others had long cultivated  that field; but he brought to it, what they could not bring, a  well-bred scholarship, a wide knowledge of public and private life,  seen in affairs as well as society, with less of a narrow sectarian  spirit: yet it may be doubted whether _Tremaine_ some thirty years  hence will be more read than _Coelebs in Search of a Wife_. If  Mr. Ward did not found the school of fashionable novelists, he was  certainly among the founders; and he infused into the best of his  works, _De Vere_, a real knowledge of Parliamentary life, a newer and  truer view of statesmen and nobles, though a little _en beau_, and a  great variety of actual characters. The circumstance of Wentworth's  supposed resemblance to Canning, and the accident of publication at  a time when the official conspiracy of the novel seemed acting in  Parliament, gave _De Vere_ a success with the world at large, which  its length and longwindedness might have marred. Mr. Ward's essays  (generally in the form of stories) were not so successful with the  public as his fictions. We think he was by nature designed for an  essayist--naturally given to discuss and expound; but nature had  denied him that penetrating originality of perception, that vigor of  thought, and (as a consequence) that terseness of style, which are  necessary to render the essay attractive and to preserve it. As  Robert Plumer Ward was essentially confined to the present, so he was  dependent on it; he was nothing if not in the mode, and in his later  works he rather fell behind the fashion.    His life as presented in these volumes was not very remarkable or  eventful. His father was a merchant at Gibraltar, and also held the  post of chief clerk of the civil department of the Ordnance in that  garrison: his mother was a Spanish Jewess. Robert Ward was born in  London, in 1765, on a visit of the family to England; and, after an  education at private schools, was sent to Oxford, in 1783. He left the  University in 1787, in debt; and soon after became a student of the  Inner Temple. An affection of the knee-joint sent him to Bareges: he  was speedily cured; but was so attracted by the pleasures of French  society, that he remained in France till the Revolution; from which he  had a narrow escape.        \"It happened, unfortunately for him, that another 'Ward,' of      about the same age and personal appearance, had incurred the      suspicion of the Republican party, at a moment when suspicion      lost all its doubts, and death followed close upon the heels      of certainty. To use his own words, 'I was arrested for having      the same name and the same colored coat and waistcoat as      another Ward, guilty of treason; was ordered without trial to      Paris, to be guillotined; and only escaped by their catching      the real traitor: I was, however, banished the republic,      merely for my name's sake.'\"    On his return to England he was called to the bar, in June 1790; and  but for a singular circumstance might have passed through life as a  literary barrister, with middling success in law and letters.        \"He was, early in 1794, leaving his chambers in the Temple      for the purpose of paying a visit in the Northern outskirts      of London. Upon crossing Fleet Street he had to traverse Bell      Yard; and as he passed a watchmaker's shop his attention was      attracted by a placard in the window, of a very revolutionary      character, convening a meeting of a certain society, that      evening, at the watchmaker's. Many a man would have passed it      unnoticed, or contented himself with a feeling of regret or      indignation at the prevalence during that period of similar      views: not so was it with young Ward; he was fresh from      all the horrors which the success of such principles in a      neighboring country had entailed; he at once determined to      enter the watchmaker's shop and provoke a discussion with      him. For two hours did the young student contest with the      Republican the justice of his sentiments; for two hours did he      labor to impress upon him, not only by argument but by his own      experience, the horrors to which success must lead; but at      the end of that time he was obliged to leave him, apparently      unmoved, or at all events unconvinced. He paid his distant      visit, and late in the evening returned homeward through the      same alley. Desparing of success, he paid no second visit      to the disputant of the morning, though he did remark with      pleasure that the revolutionary placard had been withdrawn.      Hardly, however, had he passed the shop twenty yards, when      he heard some one running after and calling to him. He looked      back and beheld the Republican watchmaker. The manner of the      man was changed from the dogged imperturbability with which he      had listened to Mr. Ward's arguments in the morning to a frank      and eager confidence. 'I have called you in,' said he, 'to say      I have done nothing but think over your words: I feel their      truth; I shudder at the precipice on which I stood, at the      evil I was about to do; and am now as anxious to communicate      and prevent as I was before to conceal all our schemes.' He      then communicated to him the existence of a most fearful      plot against the Government, which, with his newly-awakened      feelings, he longed to frustrate by immediately informing the      authorities, if he who had convinced would also accompany and      support him.        \"They went to the Chief Magistrate, Sir Richard Ford; who      attached so much importance to the communication, that the      three were at once ushered into the presence of Pitt and his      colleagues, assembled with Macdonald and Scott, the Attorney      and Solicitor-General. The singular history was duly narrated      in detail; the arguments carried on by the young Mentor, the      misgivings of the Republican, and then the details of the"]]]
