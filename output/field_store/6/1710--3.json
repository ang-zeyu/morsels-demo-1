The total electric work stored up is 130,000 kilogrammeters, or 7,600  kilogrammeters per kilogramme of accumulator. Theory indicates that a zinc  accumulator might store up as much as 15,600 kilogrammeters per  kilogramme. If the present model gives half less, it is because I have  purposely exaggerated the solidity of the trough and the mass of the  electrodes.    It should be remarked that this capacity of 7,600 kilogrammeters per  kilogramme is much greater than that of any other accumulator constructed  in France. The new model possesses, then, despite the size of the  positives and the box, a relative lightness that will permit it to take a  place upon electric locomotives as well as in fixed installations.    Independently of their use as accumulators, secondary zinc batteries may  be utilized as regulating voltameters in lighting by incandescence, for  deadening piston strokes, attenuating the irregularities in speed, and  covering accidental stoppages.--_E.

Lately we have all felt, I doubt not, a considerable amount of interest in  the various phenomena attending this summer's unusually heavy  thunderstorms, accompanied, as they have been, by vivid lightning  discharges of a more or less hurtful nature. The list of disasters  published in _Knowledge_, No. 143, might be very materially augmented were  we to record such damage as has been wrought since that list was compiled.    There is not, I suppose, in the mind of any intelligent man at the present  day a doubt as to the electrical origin of a lightning flash. The  questions to be considered are rather whence comes the electricity, and in  what way is the thunderstorm brought about. In attempting to answer these  questions, sight must not be lost of the fact that the very nature of  electricity is in itself almost sufficient to baffle any effort put forth  to ascertain from lightning, as such, its whence and its whither.    It is possible, however, with the aid of our knowledge of static  electricity, to arrive at hypotheses of a more than chimerical nature. In  the first place, that our sphere is a more or less electrified body is  generally admitted. More than this, it is demonstrated that the different  parts of the earth's surface and its enveloping atmosphere are variously  charged. As a consequence of these varying charges, there is a constant  series of currents flowing through the various parts of the earth, which  show themselves in such telegraph wires as may lie in the direction  followed by the currents. Such currents are known as earth currents, and  present phenomena of a highly interesting nature. But, apart from these  electrical manifestations, there is generally a difference of electrical  condition between the various parts of the earth's surface and those  portions of the atmosphere adjacent to or above them. Inasmuch as air is  one of the very best insulators, this difference of condition (or  potential) in any particular region is in most cases incapable of being  neutralized or equilibrated by an electric flow. Consequently the air  remains more or less continually charged. With these points admitted as  facts, the question arises, Whence this electricity? There have been very  many and various opinions expressed as to the cause of terrestrial  electricity, but far the greater portion of such theories lack fundamental  probability, and indicate causes which cannot be regarded as sufficiently  extensive or operative to produce such tremendous effects as are  occasionally witnessed. I take it that we may safely regard the evolution  of electricity as one of the ways in which force exhibits itself, that, in  other words, when work is performed electricity may result. When two  bodies are rubbed together, electricity is produced, so also is it when  two connected metals are immersed in water and one of them is dissolved,  or when one of the junctions of two metals is raised to a higher  temperature than the other junction. I will go further than this, so far,  in fact, as to maintain that there is a reasonable ground for supposing  that every movement, whether it be of the mass or among the constituent  particles, is attended by a change of electrical distribution; and if this  is true, it may easily be conceived that inasmuch as motion is the rule of  the universe, there must be a constant series of electrical changes. Now,  these changes do not all operate in one direction, nor are they all of  similar character, whence it is that not only are there earth currents of  feeble electro-motive force, but that this E.M.F. is constantly varying,  and that, furthermore, electricity of high E.M.F. is to be met with in  various parts of the atmosphere.    With earth currents we have here very little to do. The rotation of the  earth is in itself sufficient to generate small currents, and the fact  that they vary in strength at regular periods of the day and of the year  enforces the suggestion that the sun exerts considerable electrical  influence on the earth. Letting it be granted, however, that the earth is  variously charged, how comes it that the air is also charged, and with  electricity of greater tension than that of the earth itself? It was  pointed out by Sir W. Grove that if the extremities of a piece of platinum  wire be placed in a candle flame, one at the bottom and the other near the  top, an electric current will flow through the wire, indicating the  presence of electricity. If an electrified body be heated, the electricity  escapes more rapidly as the temperature rises. If a vessel of water be  electrified, and the water then converted into steam, the electric charge  will be rapidly dissipated. If a vessel containing water be electrified,  and the water allowed to escape drop by drop, electricity will escape with  each drop, and the vessel will soon be discharged.    We regard it as an established fact that the earth has always a greater or  less charge; whence it is safe to assume that in the process of  evaporation which is going on all over the surface of the globe, more  particularly in equatorial regions, every particle of water, as it rises  into the air, carries with it its portion, however minute that portion may  be, of the earth's electric charge. This small charge distributes itself  over the surface of the aqueous particle, and the vapor rises higher and  higher until it reaches that point above which the air is too rare to  support it. It then flows away laterally, and as it approaches colder  regions gets denser, sinking lower and nearer to the earth's surface. The  aqueous particles becoming reduced in size, the extent of their surfaces  is proportionately reduced. It follows that as the particles and their  surfaces are reduced, the charge is confined to a smaller surface, and  attains, therefore, a greater \"surface density,\" or in simpler language, a  greater amount of electricity per unit of surface.    Electricity, as above set forth, is in what is known as the \"static\"  condition (to distinguish it from electricity which is being transferred  in the form of a current), when it has the property of \"repelling itself\"  to the utmost limits of any conductor upon which it may be confined. This  will account for the charge finding its way to the surface of the water  particles, and will furthermore account for the greater density of the  charge as the particle gets smaller and has the extent of its surface  rapidly diminished. It may be mentioned that the surface of a sphere  varies as the cube of its radius.    Returning to the discussion of the state of affairs existing when the  particles have reached their highest position in the atmosphere, we may  imagine that they set themselves off on journeys toward either the north  or the south pole. As they pass from the hotter to the colder regions, a  number of particles coalesce; these again combine with others on the road  until the vapor becomes visible as cloud. The increased density implies  increased weight, and the cloud particles, as they sail poleward, descend  toward the surface of the earth. Assuming that a spherical form is  maintained throughout, the condensation of a number of particles implies a  considerable reduction of surface. Thus, the contents of two spheres vary  as the cubes of their radii, or eight (the cube of 2) drops on combining  will form a drop twice the radius of one of the original drops. We may  safely conceive hundreds and thousands of such combinations to take place  until a cloud mass is formed, in which the constituent parts are more or  less in contact, and, therefore, behave electrically as a single conductor  of irregular surface, upon which is accumulated all the electricity that  was previously distributed over the surfaces of the millions of particles  that now compose it.    The tendency of an electric charge upon the surface of a conductor is to  take upon itself a position in which it may approach nearest to an equal  and opposite charge; or, if possible, to attain neutrality. If, then, a  cloud has a charge, and there is no other cloud above or near it, the  charge _induces_ on the adjacent earth surface electricity of the opposite  kind. Thus, assuming the cloud to be charged with positive electricity,  the subjacent earth will be in the negative state.
