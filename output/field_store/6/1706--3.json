No estimate has been made of the portions of  bodies which were recovered and buried. The large percentage of bodies  not recovered is due, no doubt, to the fact that the men were swinging  in their hammocks immediately over that portion of the vessel which was  totally destroyed.    A.S. CROWNINSHIELD,    _Chief of Bureau_.        EXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 25, 1898_.    _To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of  America_:    I transmit to the Congress, for its consideration and appropriate  action, copies of correspondence recently had with the representative of  Spain in the United States, with the United States minister at Madrid,  and through the latter with the Government of Spain, showing the action  taken under the joint resolution approved April 20, 1898, \"for the  recognition of the independence of the people of Cuba, demanding that  the Government of Spain relinquish its authority and government in the  island of Cuba and to withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and  Cuban waters, and directing the President of the United States to use  the land and naval forces of the United States to carry these  resolutions in to effect.\"[7]    Upon communicating to the Spanish minister in Washington the demand  which it became the duty of the Executive to address to the Government  of Spain in obedience to said resolution, the minister asked for his  passports and withdrew. The United States minister at Madrid was in turn  notified by the Spanish minister for foreign affairs that the withdrawal  of the Spanish representative from the United States had terminated  diplomatic relations between the two countries, and that all official  communications between their respective representatives ceased  therewith.    I commend to your especial attention the note addressed to the United  States minister at Madrid by the Spanish minister for foreign affairs  on the 21st instant, whereby the foregoing notification was conveyed.  It will be perceived therefrom that the Government of Spain, having  cognizance of the joint resolution of the United States Congress,  and in view of the things which the President is thereby required and  authorized to do, responds by treating the reasonable demands of this  Government as measures of hostility, following with that instant and  complete severance of relations by its action which by the usage of  nations accompanies an existent state of war between sovereign powers.    The position of Spain being thus made known and the demands of the  United States being denied, with a complete rupture of intercourse,  by the act of Spain, I have been constrained, in exercise of the power  and authority conferred upon me by the joint resolution aforesaid, to  proclaim, under date of April 22, 1898,[8] a blockade of certain ports  of the north coast of Cuba lying between Cardenas and Bahia Honda, and  of the port of Cienfuegos, on the south coast of Cuba, and further in  exercise of my constitutional powers and using the authority conferred  upon me by the act of Congress approved April 22, 1898, to issue my  proclamation dated April 23, 1898,[9] calling forth volunteers in order  to carry into effect the said resolution of April 20, 1898. Copies of  these proclamations are hereto appended.    In view of the measures so taken, and with a view to the adoption of  such other measures as may be necessary to enable me to carry out the  expressed will of the Congress of the United States in the premises, I  now recommend to your honorable body the adoption of a joint resolution  declaring that a state of war exists between the United States of  America and the Kingdom of Spain, and I urge speedy action thereon, to  the end that the definition of the international status of the United  States as a belligerent power may be made known and the assertion of all  its rights and the maintenance of all its duties in the conduct of a  public war may be assured.[10]    WILLIAM McKINLEY.    [Footnote 7: See p. 155.]    [Footnote 8: See pp. 202-203.]    [Footnote 9: See pp. 203-204.]    [Footnote 10: See p. 201.]      JOINT RESOLUTION for the recognition of the independence of the people  of Cuba, demanding that the Government of Spain relinquish its authority  and government in the island of Cuba and to withdraw its land and naval  forces from Cuba and Cuban waters, and directing the President of the  United States to use the land and naval forces of the United States to  carry these resolutions into effect.    Whereas the abhorrent conditions which have existed for more than three  years in the island of Cuba, so near our own borders, have shocked the  moral sense of the people of the United States, have been a disgrace to  Christian civilization, culminating, as they have, in the destruction of  a United States battle ship, with 266 of its officers and crew, while on  a friendly visit in the harbor of Havana, and can not longer be endured,  as has been set forth by the President of the United States in his  message to Congress of April 11, 1898,[11] upon which the action of  Congress was invited: Therefore,    _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United  States of America in Congress assembled_, First. That the people of  the island of Cuba are and of right ought to be free and independent.    Second. That it is the duty of the United States to demand, and the  Government of the United States does hereby demand, that the Government  of Spain at once relinquish its authority and government in the island  of Cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban  waters.    Third. That the President of the United States be, and he hereby is,  directed and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of the  United States and to call into the actual service of the United States  the militia of the several States to such extent as may be necessary to  carry these resolutions into effect.    Fourth. That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or  intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over  said island except for the pacification thereof, and asserts its  determination, when that is accomplished, to leave the government  and control of the island to its people.    Approved, April 20, 1898.    [Footnote 11: See pp. 139-150.]        EXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 9, 1898_.    _To the Congress of the United States:_    On the 24th of April I directed the Secretary of the Navy to telegraph  orders to Commodore George Dewey, of the United States Navy, commanding  the Asiatic Squadron, then lying in the port of Hongkong, to proceed  forthwith to the Philippine Islands, there-to commence operations and  engage the assembled Spanish fleet.    Promptly obeying that order, the United States squadron, consisting of  the flagship _Olympia_, _Baltimore_, _Raleigh_, _Boston_, _Concord_, and  _Petrel_, with the revenue cutter _McCulloch_ as an auxiliary dispatch  boat, entered the harbor of Manila at daybreak on the 1st of May and  immediately engaged the entire Spanish fleet of eleven ships, which were  under the protection of the fire of the land forts. After a stubborn  fight, in which the enemy suffered great loss, these vessels were  destroyed or completely disabled and the water battery at Cavite  silenced. Of our brave officers and men not one was lost and only eight  injured, and those slightly. All of our ships escaped any serious  damage.    By the 4th of May Commodore Dewey had taken possession of the naval  station at Cavite, destroying the fortifications there and at the  entrance of the bay and paroling their garrisons. The waters of the bay  are under his complete control. He has established hospitals within the  American lines, where 250 of the Spanish sick and wounded are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/139"],[0,"The Lost World (#10)"],[1," Waldron is very wrong in supposing that  because he has never himself seen a so-called prehistoric animal,  therefore these creatures no longer exist.  They are indeed, as he has  said, our ancestors, but they are, if I may use the expression, our  contemporary ancestors, who can still be found with all their hideous  and formidable characteristics if one has but the energy and hardihood  to seek their haunts.  Creatures which were supposed to be Jurassic,  monsters who would hunt down and devour our largest and fiercest  mammals, still exist.\" (Cries of \"Bosh!\" \"Prove it!\" \"How do YOU know?\"  \"Question!\") \"How do I know, you ask me? I know because I have visited  their secret haunts.  I know because I have seen some of them.\"  (Applause, uproar, and a voice, \"Liar!\")  \"Am I a liar?\" (General  hearty and noisy assent.)  \"Did I hear someone say that I was a liar?  Will the person who called me a liar kindly stand up that I may know  him?\"  (A voice, \"Here he is, sir!\" and an inoffensive little person in  spectacles, struggling violently, was held up among a group of  students.)  \"Did you venture to call me a liar?\"  (\"No, sir, no!\"  shouted the accused, and disappeared like a jack-in-the-box.)  \"If any  person in this hall dares to doubt my veracity, I shall be glad to have  a few words with him after the lecture.\"  (\"Liar!\")  \"Who said that?\"  (Again the inoffensive one plunging desperately, was elevated high into  the air.) \"If I come down among you----\" (General chorus of \"Come,  love, come!\" which interrupted the proceedings for some moments, while  the chairman, standing up and waving both his arms, seemed to be  conducting the music.  The Professor, with his face flushed, his  nostrils dilated, and his beard bristling, was now in a proper Berserk  mood.)  \"Every great discoverer has been met with the same  incredulity--the sure brand of a generation of fools.  When great facts  are laid before you, you have not the intuition, the imagination which  would help you to understand them.  You can only throw mud at the men  who have risked their lives to open new fields to science.  You  persecute the prophets!  Galileo!  Darwin, and I----\" (Prolonged  cheering and complete interruption.)    All this is from my hurried notes taken at the time, which give little  notion of the absolute chaos to which the assembly had by this time  been reduced.  So terrific was the uproar that several ladies had  already beaten a hurried retreat.  Grave and reverend seniors seemed to  have caught the prevailing spirit as badly as the students, and I saw  white-bearded men rising and shaking their fists at the obdurate  Professor.  The whole great audience seethed and simmered like a  boiling pot.  The Professor took a step forward and raised both his  hands.  There was something so big and arresting and virile in the man  that the clatter and shouting died gradually away before his commanding  gesture and his masterful eyes.  He seemed to have a definite message.  They hushed to hear it.    \"I will not detain you,\" he said.  \"It is not worth it.  Truth is  truth, and the noise of a number of foolish young men--and, I fear I  must add, of their equally foolish seniors--cannot affect the matter.  I claim that I have opened a new field of science.  You dispute it.\"  (Cheers.)  \"Then I put you to the test.  Will you accredit one or more  of your own number to go out as your representatives and test my  statement in your name?\"    Mr. Summerlee, the veteran Professor of Comparative Anatomy, rose among  the audience, a tall, thin, bitter man, with the withered aspect of a  theologian.  He wished, he said, to ask Professor Challenger whether  the results to which he had alluded in his remarks had been obtained  during a journey to the headwaters of the Amazon made by him two years  before.    Professor Challenger answered that they had.    Mr. Summerlee desired to know how it was that Professor Challenger  claimed to have made discoveries in those regions which had been  overlooked by Wallace, Bates, and other previous explorers of  established scientific repute.    Professor Challenger answered that Mr. Summerlee appeared to be  confusing the Amazon with the Thames; that it was in reality a somewhat  larger river; that Mr. Summerlee might be interested to know that with  the Orinoco, which communicated with it, some fifty thousand miles of  country were opened up, and that in so vast a space it was not  impossible for one person to find what another had missed.    Mr. Summerlee declared, with an acid smile, that he fully appreciated  the difference between the Thames and the Amazon, which lay in the fact  that any assertion about the former could be tested, while about the  latter it could not.  He would be obliged if Professor Challenger would  give the latitude and the longitude of the country in which prehistoric  animals were to be found.    Professor Challenger replied that he reserved such information for good  reasons of his own, but would be prepared to give it with proper  precautions to a committee chosen from the audience.  Would Mr.  Summerlee serve on such a committee and test his story in person?    Mr. Summerlee:  \"Yes, I will.\"  (Great cheering.)    Professor Challenger:  \"Then I guarantee that I will place in your  hands such material as will enable you to find your way.  It is only  right, however, since Mr. Summerlee goes to check my statement that I  should have one or more with him who may check his.  I will not  disguise from you that there are difficulties and dangers.  Mr.  Summerlee will need a younger colleague.  May I ask for volunteers?\"    It is thus that the great crisis of a man's life springs out at him.  Could I have imagined when I entered that hall that I was about to  pledge myself to a wilder adventure than had ever come to me in my  dreams?  But Gladys--was it not the very opportunity of which she  spoke?  Gladys would have told me to go.  I had sprung to my feet.  I  was speaking, and yet I had prepared no words.  Tarp Henry, my  companion, was plucking at my skirts and I heard him whispering, \"Sit  down, Malone! Don't make a public ass of yourself.\"  At the same time I  was aware that a tall, thin man, with dark gingery hair, a few seats in  front of me, was also upon his feet.  He glared back at me with hard  angry eyes, but I refused to give way.    \"I will go, Mr. Chairman,\" I kept repeating over and over again.    \"Name!  Name!\" cried the audience.    \"My name is Edward Dunn Malone.  I am the reporter of the Daily  Gazette.  I claim to be an absolutely unprejudiced witness.\"    \"What is YOUR name, sir?\" the chairman asked of my tall rival.    \"I am Lord John Roxton.  I have already been up the Amazon, I know all  the ground, and have special qualifications for this investigation.\"    \"Lord John Roxton's reputation as a sportsman and a traveler is, of  course, world-famous,\" said the chairman; \"at the same time it would  certainly be as well to have a member of the Press upon such an  expedition.\"    \"Then I move,\" said Professor Challenger, \"that both these gentlemen be  elected, as representatives of this meeting, to accompany Professor  Summerlee upon his journey to investigate and to report upon the truth  of my statements.\"    And so, amid shouting and cheering, our fate was decided, and I found  myself borne away in the human current which swirled towards the door,  with my mind half stunned by the vast new project which had risen so  suddenly before it.  As I emerged from the hall I was conscious for a  moment of a rush of laughing students--down the pavement, and of an arm  wielding a heavy umbrella, which rose and fell in the midst of them.  Then, amid a mixture of groans and cheers, Professor Challenger's  electric brougham slid from the curb, and I found myself walking under  the silvery lights of Regent Street, full of thoughts of Gladys and of  wonder as to my future.    Suddenly there was a touch at my elbow.  I turned, and found myself  looking into the humorous, masterful eyes of the tall, thin man who had  volunteered to be my companion on this strange quest.    \"Mr. Malone, I understand,\" said he.  \"We are to be companions--what?  My rooms are just over the road, in the Albany.  Perhaps you would have  the kindness to spare me half an hour, for there are one or two things  that I badly want to say to you.\"                                      CHAPTER VI                      \"I was the Flail of the Lord\"    Lord John Roxton and I turned down Vigo Street together and through the  dingy portals of the famous aristocratic rookery.  At the end of a long  drab passage my new acquaintance pushed open a door and turned on an  electric switch.  A number of lamps shining through tinted shades  bathed the whole great room before us in a ruddy radiance.  Standing in  the doorway and glancing round me, I had a general impression of  extraordinary comfort and elegance combined with an atmosphere of  masculine virility.  Everywhere there were mingled the luxury of the  wealthy man of taste and the careless untidiness of the bachelor.  Rich  furs and strange iridescent mats from some Oriental bazaar were  scattered upon the floor.  Pictures and prints which even my  unpractised eyes could recognize as being of great price and rarity  hung thick upon the walls.  Sketches of boxers, of ballet-girls, and of  racehorses alternated with a sensuous Fragonard, a martial Girardet,  and a dreamy Turner.  But amid these varied ornaments there were  scattered the trophies which brought back strongly to my recollection  the fact that Lord John Roxton was one of the great all-round sportsmen  and athletes of his day.  A dark-blue oar crossed with a cherry-pink  one above his mantel-piece spoke of the old Oxonian and Leander man,  while the foils and boxing-gloves above and below them were the tools  of a man who had won supremacy with each.  Like a dado round the room  was the jutting line of"]]]
