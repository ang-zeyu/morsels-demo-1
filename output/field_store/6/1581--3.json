He  is so quiet, in a way, and yet so wonderfully confident and at ease!\"    \"That's Eton,\" said I. \"He is the best type of Eton boy, and the best  type of Eton boy,\" I declared, airing the little condition with a  flourish, \"is one of the greatest works of God.\"    \"I daresay you're right,\" said Mrs. Lascelles, smiling indulgently; \"but  what is it? How do you define it? It isn't 'side,' and yet I can quite  imagine people who don't know him thinking that it is. He is cocksure of  himself, but of nothing else; that seems to me to be the difference. No  one could possibly be more simple in himself. He may have the assurance  of a man of fifty, yet it isn't put on; it's neither bumptious nor  affected, but just as natural in Mr. Evers as shyness and awkwardness in  the ordinary youth one meets. And he has the _savoir faire_ not to ask  questions!\"    Were we all mistaken? Was this the way in which a designing woman would  speak of the object of her designs? Not that I thought so hardly of Mrs.  Lascelles myself; but I did think that she might well fall in love with  Bob Evers, at least as well as he with her. Was this, then, the way in  which a woman would be likely to speak of the young man with whom she  had fallen in love? To me the appreciation sounded too frank and  discerning and acute. Yet I could not call it dispassionate, and  frankness was this woman's outstanding merit, though I was beginning to  discover others as well. Moreover, the fact remained that they had been  greatly talked about; that at any rate must be stopped and I was there  to stop it.    I began to pick my words.    \"It's all Eton, except what is in the blood, and it's all a question of  manners, or rather of manner. Don't misunderstand me, Mrs. Lascelles. I  don't say that Bob isn't independent in character as well as in his  ways, but only that when all's said he's still a boy and not a man. He  can't possibly have a man's experience of the world, or even of himself.  He has a young head on his shoulders, after all, if not a younger one  than many a boy with half the assurance that you admire in him.\"    Mrs. Lascelles looked at me point-blank.    \"Do you mean that he can't take care of himself?\"    \"I don't say that.\"    \"Then what do you say?\"    The fine eyes met mine without a flicker. The full mouth was curved at  the corners in a tolerant, unsuspecting smile. It was hard to have to  make an enemy of so handsome and good-humoured a woman. And was it  necessary, was it even wise? As I hesitated she turned and glanced  downward once more toward the glacier, then rose and went to the lip of  our grassy ledge, and as she returned I caught the sound which she had  been the first to hear. It was the gritty planting of nailed boots upon  a hard, smooth rock.    \"I'm afraid you can't say it now,\" whispered Mrs. Lascelles. \"Here's Mr.  Evers himself, coming this way back from the Monte Rosa hut! I'm going  to give him a surprise!\"    And it was a genuine one that she gave him, for I heard his boyish  greeting before I saw his hot brown face, and there was no mistaking the  sudden delight of both. It was sudden and spontaneous, complete, until  his eyes lit on me. Even then his smile did not disappear, but it  changed, as did his tone.    \"Good heavens!\" cried Bob. \"How on earth did _you_ get up here? By rail  to the Riffelberg, I hope?\"    \"On my sticks.\"    \"It was much too far for him,\" added Mrs. Lascelles, \"and all my fault  for showing him the way. But I'm afraid there was contributory obstinacy  in Captain Clephane, because he simply wouldn't turn back. And now tell  us about yourself, Mr. Evers; surely we were not coming back this way?\"    \"_We_ were not,\" said Bob, with a something sardonic in his little  laugh, \"but I thought I might as well. It's the long way, six miles on  end upon the glacier.\"    \"But have you really been to the hut?\"    \"Rather!\"    \"And where's our guide?\"    \"Oh, I wouldn't be bothered with a guide all to myself.\"    \"My dear young man, you might have stepped straight into a crevasse!\"    \"I precious nearly did,\" laughed Bob, again with something odd about his  laughter; \"but I say, do you know, if you won't think me awfully rude,  I'll push on back and get changed. I'm as hot as anything and not fit  to be seen.\"    And he was gone after very little more than a minute from first to last,  gone with rather an elaborate salute to Mrs. Lascelles, and rather a  cavalier nod to me. But then neither of us had made any effort to detain  him and a notable omission I thought it in Mrs. Lascelles, though to the  lad himself it may well have seemed as strange in the old friend as in  the new.    \"What was it,\" asked Mrs. Lascelles, when we were on our way home, \"that  you were going to say about Mr. Evers when he appeared in the flesh in  that extraordinary way?\"    \"I forget,\" said I, immorally.    \"Really? So soon? Don't you remember, I thought you meant that he  couldn't take care of himself, and you were just going to tell me what  you did mean?\"    \"Oh, well, it wasn't that, because he can!\"    But, as a matter of fact, I had seen my way to taking care of Master Bob  without saying a word either to him or to Mrs. Lascelles, or at all  events without making enemies of them both.          CHAPTER VII    SECOND FIDDLE      My plan was quite obvious in its simplicity, and not in the least  discreditable from my point of view. It was perhaps inevitable that a  boy like Bob should imagine I was trying to \"cut him out,\" as my blunt  friend Quinby phrased it to my face. I had not, of course, the smallest  desire to do any such vulgar thing. All I wanted was to make myself, if  possible, as agreeable to Mrs. Lascelles as this youth had done before  me, and in any case to share with him all the perils of her society. In  other words I meant to squeeze into \"the imminent deadly breach\" beside  Bob Evers, not necessarily in front of him. But if there was nothing  dastardly in this, neither was there anything heroic, since I was proof  against that kind of deadliness if Bob was not.    On the other hand, the whole character of my mission was affected by the  decision at which I had now arrived. There was no longer a necessity to  speak plainly to anybody. That odious duty was eliminated from my plan  of campaign, and the \"frontal attack\" of recent history discarded for  the \"turning movement\" of the day. So I had learnt something in South  Africa after all. I had learnt how to avoid hard knocks which might very  well do more harm than good to the cause I had at heart. That cause was  still sharply defined before my mind. It was the first and most sacred  consideration. I wrote a reassuring despatch to Catherine Evers, and  took it myself to the little post-office opposite the hotel that very  evening before dressing for dinner. But I cannot say that I was thinking  of Catherine when I proceeded to spoil three successive ties in the  tying.    Yet I can only repeat that I felt absolutely \"proof\" against the real  cause of my solicitude. It is the most delightful feeling where a  handsome woman is concerned. The judgment is not warped by passion or  clouded by emotion; you see the woman as she is, not as you wish to see  her, and if she disappoint it does not matter. You are not left to  choose between systematic self-deception and a humiliating admission of  your mistake. The lady has not been placed upon an impossible pedestal,  and she has not toppled down. In this case the lady started at the most  advantageous disadvantage; every admirable quality, her candour, her  courage, her spirited independence, her evident determination to piece a  broken life together again and make the best of it, told doubly in her  favour to me with my special knowledge of her past. It would be too much  to say that I was deeply interested; but Mrs. Lascelles had inspired me  with a certain sympathy and dispassionate regard. Cultivated she was  not, in the conventional sense, but she knew more than can be imbibed  from books. She knew life at first hand, had drained the cup for  herself, and yet could savour the lees. Not that she enlarged any  further on her own past. Mrs. Lascelles was never a great talker, like  Catherine; but she was certainly a woman to whom one could talk. And  talk to her I did thenceforward, with a conscientious conviction that I  was doing my duty, and only an occasional qualm for its congenial  character, while Bob listened with a wondering eye, or went his own way  without a word.    It is easy to criticise my conduct now. It would have been difficult to  act otherwise at the time. I am speaking of the evening after my walk  with Mrs. Lascelles, of the next day when it rained, and now of my third  night at the hotel. The sky had cleared. The glass was high. There was a  finer edge than ever on the silhouetted mountains against the stars. It  appeared that Bob and Mrs. Lascelles had talked of taking their lunch to  the Findelen Glacier on the next fine day, for he came up and reminded  her of it as she sat with me in the glazed veranda after dinner. I had  seen him standing alone under the stars a few minutes before: so this  was the result of his cogitation. But in his manner there was nothing  studied, much less awkward, and his smile even included me, though he  had not spoken to me alone all day.    \"Oh, no, I hadn't forgotten, Mr. Evers. I am looking forward to it,\"  said my companion, with a smile of her own to which the most jealous  swain could not have taken exception.    Bob Evers looked hard at me.    \"You'd better come, too,\" he said.    \"It's probably too far,\" said I, quite intending to play second fiddle  next day, for it was really Bob's turn.    \"Not for a man who has been up to the Cricket-ground,\" he rejoined.    \"But it's dreadfully slippery,\" put in Mrs. Lascelles, with a  sympathetic glance at my sticks.    \"Let him get them shod like alpenstocks,\" quoth Bob, \"and nails in his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11171"],[0,"Uncle Tom's Cabin, Young Folks' Edition (#10)"],[1," free men and women ought.'    'One thing more,' added George, when the cheering and rejoicing had  died away a little. 'You all remember our good old Uncle Tom. You have  heard how he died, and how he sent his love to you all. It was on his  grave, my friends, that I made up my mind, with God's help, never to own  another slave, if it were possible to free him. I resolved that nobody,  through my fault, should ever run the risk of being parted from his dear  ones, and of dying far from them, as he died.    'So, when you rejoice in your freedom, remember that you owe it to dear  old Uncle Tom, and pay it back in kindness to his wife and children.  Think of your freedom every time you see Uncle Tom's Cabin; and let it  help you to try to live as he did, and be as honest and faithful and  Christian as he was.'      THE END."]]]
