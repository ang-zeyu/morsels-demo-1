Thomas, John Gilbert, J.D.  Watson, A.B. Houghton, W. Small, A. Parquier, R. Barnes, M.E. Edwards,  and T. Morten. No book can be imagined which would afford the essential  nature of his art less opportunity of showing itself than this one. He  was no good at horrors, though his resourcefulness in the manifestation  of emotional light and shadow was encouraged by the character of the  full-page illustration which he had to supply. A signed full page  appears in Part XVI., page 541. It is a scene in which the four  martyrs, Bland, Frankesh, Sheterden, and Middleton, condemned by the  Bishop of Dover, 25th June 1555, are shown being burned at the stakes.  One of the martyrs certainly looks intensely smug with his hands folded  as if he were at grace before a favourite dinner. Yes, du Maurier  certainly failed to attain quite to the heights of the horror of this  book.    The following year we have from the artist's pencil illustrations to a  book of the heroine of which he was so fond that he named his own  daughter after her. That book was Mrs. Gaskell's _Wives and Daughters_,  \"an everyday story,\" as it is called in its sub-title. For this story du  Maurier's art was much more fitted than for any other. In it, certainly,  and not in Foxe's book, we should expect his temperament to reveal  itself--and we are not disappointed. It is here that du Maurier is at  his best. His illustrations have a daintiness in this tale which they  have nowhere else. A sign of the presence of fine art is the  accommodation of style to theme. The illustrations had been made for  this book when it appeared serially in the _Cornhill_, and were  afterwards published in the issue in two volumes. There is a picture at  the beginning of the second volume called \"The Burning Gorse,\" in  which du Maurier makes an imaginative appeal through landscape almost  worthy of Keene.    [Illustration: Illustration for \"The Story of a Feather\" 1867.]    The artist is again at his best in the work of illustrating fiction in  the following year in Douglas Jerrold's _Story of a Feather_. It is the  same refinement of technique that is evident as in Mrs. Gaskell's tale.  One of du Maurier's greatest characteristics was charm. One is forced  into ringing changes upon the word in the description of his work. But  charm it is, more than ever, that characterises his illustrations to  _The Story of a Feather_. The initial letters in this book afford him a  succession of opportunities for displaying that inventive genius which  is evident wherever he turns to the province of pure fancy. It was not  for nothing apparently that he was the son of an inventor.    We have already spoken of his power in these days in the emotional use  of light and shade. It is perhaps even in this light book--in the  illustration reproduced opposite--that we have one of the best examples  of this power. But this book is all through a gold-mine of the work of  the real du Maurier.    Another work in which his art is to be found at this time is Shirley  Brooks's _Sooner or Later_ (1868). The novel does not seem treated with  quite the same reverence and enthusiasm which has characterised his work  in the books we have just described, but it is among the representative  examples of his illustration in the sixties. This story also passed as a  serial through _Cornhill_. In the same year, with E.H. Corbould, he  provides illustrations to _The Book of Drawing-room Plays_, &c., a  manual of indoor recreation by H. Dalton. It is not impossible that  these were prepared long in advance of publication, for they are in a  very much earlier manner than the illustrations we have been speaking  of. In them du Maurier has not yet emerged from the influence of  Leech--the first influence we encountered when a few years previously he  joined himself to the band of those who solicit the publishers for  illustrative work. From the point of view of our subject the book does  not repay much study. In 1876, in illustrations to _Hurlock Chase, or  Among the Sussex Ironworks_, by George E. Sargent, published by The  Religious Tract Society, we have some pictures of extraordinary power,  in which it is to be seen how much his contact with Millais and other  great illustrators in the sixties inspired him, and developed his  resources. His work has a \"weight\" in this book which was common to the  best illustration of the period, a deliberation which shows the  influence of Durer over the illustrators of the sixties, and also the  influence of pre-Raphaelitism in precise elaboration of form. It is in  lighter vein we find him again in the same year in Jemmett Browne's  _Songs of Many Seasons_, published by Simpkin, Marshall & Co., and  illustrated also by Walter Crane and others. Every now and then at this  period du Maurier shows us a genius for \"still-life\" in interior _genre_  which he did not seem to develop afterwards to the extent of the promise  shown in these pictures. He gained at this time a very great deal in his  art by the pre-Raphaelite influence. Never is he more exquisite than  when he embraces detail. The need to produce with rapidity, and the  effect of later fashions which did not suit his own nature so well,  induced him to give up a very deliberate style suited to his quick  perception of beauty in everyday incident, for one that sometimes only  achieved emptiness in its attempt at breadth. But to have kept his  pre-Raphaelite individuality with two such native impressionists as  Keene and Whistler for his most intimate friends would have perhaps  been more than could be expected of human nature. But it is true that he  seemed to lose where those two artists proved they had everything to  gain from a style that passed detail swiftly, treating it suggestively.  They were by nature impressionable to a different aspect of life, and in  self expression they required a different method.    Du Maurier's artistic creed that everything should be drawn from  nature--and tables and chairs are \"nature\" for the artist--forced him to  return again and again to accessible properties which could be fitted  into his scenes. Notable among those were the big vases and the  constantly reappearing ornamental gilt clock. Though drawn in black and  white we are sure of its gilt, for it belongs to the Victorian period.  It is to be met with in all the surviving drawing-rooms of the  period--that is, it is to be met with in \"Apartments.\"    Du Maurier next furnishes a frontispiece and vignettes, which we do not  admire, to Clement Scott's _Round about the Islands_ (1874).    In 1882 he is at work in the field he had made his own, illustrating the  story of a fad that had always amused him, illustrating the craze he  had helped to create, in _Prudence: A Story of Aesthetic London_, by  Lucy C. Lillie. We hope the reader of this page does not think we should  have read this book. We looked at the illustrations of a muscular  curate--whom we took to be the hero--making an impressive entrance into  a gathering of \"aesthetes,\" and farther on leaving the church door with  \"Prudence\"; we read the legend to the final illustration--\"It was odd to  see how completely Prudence forsook her brief period of aesthetic  light\"--and we came to our own conclusions. The illustrations are made  very small in process of printing, but du Maurier's art never lost by  reduction. A picture of a Private View day in a Gallery--which at first  makes one think of the Royal Academy, but in which the pictures are too  well hung for that, and which is probably intended for the Grosvenor  Gallery--is one of those admirable drawings of a fashionable crush with  which du Maurier always excelled. In reviewing this book, however, we  are already away from the most characteristic period of du Maurier's  work as an illustrator of fiction. That was between 1860 and 1880. His  line is altogether less intense in the next book we have to  consider--Philips's _As in a Looking Glass_ (1889). The falling off  between this and the book we were reviewing here but a moment ago is the  most evident feature of the work before us. We have, we feel, said  good-bye to the du Maurier who added so much lustre to the illustrative  work of the period just preceding its publication. But in _Punch_ the  vivacity of his art is still sustained; and long afterwards in _Trilby_  he scores successes again. In later years du Maurier _allowed_ in his  originals for reduction, and the original cannot be rightly judged until  the reduction is made. In the book under notice no reduction appears to  have been made, and the drawings are consequently lacking in precision  of detail. The book is a large drawing-room table book--in our opinion  the most hateful kind of book that was ever made--occupying more space  than any but the rarest works in the world are worth, giving more  trouble to hold than it is possible for any but a great masterpiece to  compensate for--and generally putting author and publisher in the debt  of the reader, which is quite the wrong way round. The curious may see  in this book what du Maurier's art was at its worst, and it may help  them to estimate his achievement to note how even on this occasion it  surpasses easily all later modern work in the same vein.    There is one other book, published in 1874, which du Maurier illustrated  at that time which should be mentioned. It had, we believe, a great  success of a popular kind. We refer to _Misunderstood_, by Florence  Montgomery. In the light of the illustrations, which are in the artist's  finest vein, one wonders how much of this success could with justice  have been attributed to the illustrations. We are inclined to think not  a little. These pictures show many of the most interesting qualities of  his work. In the portrait of Sir Everard Duncombe, Misunderstood's  father, we have a skill in portraying a type that cannot have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14400"],[0,"Manual of Egyptian Archaeology and Guide to the Study of Antiquities in Egypt (#10)"],[1,"out to  the form required (fig. 56). The ordinary roofing consists of flat paving  slabs. When the space between the walls was not too wide, these slabs  bridged it over at a single stretch; otherwise the roof had to be supported  at intervals, and the wider the space the more these supports needed to be  multiplied. The supports were connected by immense stone architraves, on  which the roofing slabs rested.    [Illustration: Fig. 56.--\"Corbelled\" arch, temple of Seti I. at Abydos.]    The supports are of two types,--the pillar and the column. Some are cut  from single blocks. Thus, the monolithic pillars of the temple of the  sphinx (Note 8), the oldest hitherto found, measure 16 feet in height by 4-  1/2 feet in width. Monolithic columns of red granite are also found among  the ruins of Alexandria, Bubastis,[12] and Memphis, which date from the  reigns of Horemheb and Rameses II., and measure some 20 to 26 feet in  height. But columns and pillars are commonly built in courses, which are  often unequal and irregular, like those of the walls which surround them.  The great columns of Luxor are not even solid, two-thirds of the diameter  being filled up with yellow cement, which has lost its strength, and  crumbles between the fingers. The capital of the column of Taharka at  Karnak contains three courses, each about 48 inches high. The last and most  projecting course is made up of twenty-six convergent stones, which are  held in place by merely the weight of the abacus. The same carelessness  which we have already noted in the workmanship of the walls is found in  the workmanship of the columns.    [Illustration: Fig. 57.--Hathor pillar, Abu Simbel.]    [Illustration: Fig. 58.--Pillar of Amenhotep III., Karnak.]    The quadrangular pillar, with parallel or slightly inclined sides, and  generally without either base or capital, frequently occurs in tombs of the  ancient empire. It reappears later at Medinet Habu, in the temple of  Thothmes III., and again at Karnak, in what is known as the processional  hall. The sides of these square pillars are often covered with painted  scenes, while the front faces were more decoratively treated, being  sculptured with lotus or papyrus stems in high relief, as on the pillar-  stelae of Karnak, or adorned with a head of Hathor crowned with the  sistrum, as in the small speos of Abu Simbel (fig. 57), or sculptured with  a full-length standing figure of Osiris, as in the second court of Medinet  Habu; or, as at Denderah and Gebel Barkal, with the figure of the god Bes.  At Karnak, in an edifice which was probably erected by Horemheb with  building material taken from the ruins of a sanctuary of Amenhotep II. and  III., the pillar is capped by a cornice, separated from the architrave by a  thin abacus (fig. 58). By cutting away its four edges, the square pillar  becomes an octagonal prism, and further, by cutting off the eight new  edges, it becomes a sixteen-sided prism. Some pillars in the tombs of Asuan  and Beni Hasan, and in the processional hall at Karnak (fig. 59), as well  as in the chapels of Deir el Bahari, are of this type. Besides the forms  thus regularly evolved, there are others of irregular derivation, with  six, twelve, fifteen, or twenty sides, or verging almost upon a perfect  circle. The portico pillars of the temple of Osiris at Abydos come last in  the series; the drum is curved, but not round, the curve being interrupted  at both extremities of the same diameter by a flat stripe. More frequently  the sides are slightly channelled; and sometimes, as at Kalabsheh, the  flutings are divided into four groups of five each by four vertical flat  stripes (fig. 60). The polygonal pillar has always a large, shallow plinth,  in the form of a rounded disc. At El Kab it bears the head of Hathor,  sculptured in relief upon the front (fig. 61); but almost everywhere else  it is crowned with a simple square abacus, which joins it to the  architrave. Thus treated, it bears a certain family likeness to the Doric  column; and one understands how Jomard and Champollion, in the first ardour  of discovery, were tempted to give it the scarcely justifiable name of  \"proto-Doric.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 59.--Sixteen-sided pillars, Karnak.]    The column does not rest immediately upon the soil. It is always furnished  with a base like that of the polygonal pillar, sometimes square with the  ground, and sometimes slightly rounded. This base is either plain, or  ornamented only with a line of hieroglyphs. The principal forms fall into  three types: (1) the column with campaniform, or lotus-flower capital; (2)  the column with lotus-bud capital; (3) the column with Hathor-head capital.    [Illustration: Fig. 60.--Fluted pillar, Kalabsheh.]    [Illustration: Fig. 61.--Polygonal Hathor-headed pillar, El Kab.]    I. _Columns with Campaniform Capitals_.--The shaft is generally plain, or  merely engraved with inscriptions or bas-reliefs. Sometimes, however, as at  Medamot, it is formed of six large and six small colonnettes in  alternation. In Pharaonic times, it is bulbous, being curved inward at the  base, and ornamented with triangles one within another, imitating the large  leaves which sheathe the sprouting plant. The curve is so regulated that  the diameter at the base and the top shall be about equal. In the Ptolemaic  period, the bulb often disappears, owing probably to Greek influences. The  columns which surround the first court at Edfu rise straight from their  plinths. The shaft always tapers towards the top. It is finished by three  or five flat bands, one above the other. At Medamot, where the shaft is  clustered, the architect has doubtless thought that one tie at the top  appeared insufficient to hold in a dozen colonnettes; he has therefore  marked two other rings of bands at regular intervals. The campaniform  capital is decorated from the spring of the curve with a row of leaves,  like those which sheathe the base. Between these are figured shoots of  lotus and papyrus in flower and bud. The height of the capital, and the  extent of its projection beyond the line of the shaft, varied with the  taste of the architect. At Luxor, the campaniform capitals are eleven and a  half feet in diameter at the neck, eighteen feet in diameter at the top,  and eleven and a half feet in height. At Karnak, in the hypostyle hall, the  height of the capital is twelve and a quarter feet, and the greatest  diameter twenty-one feet. A square die surmounts the whole. This die is  almost hidden by the curve of the capital, though occasionally, as at  Denderah, it is higher, and bears on each face a figure of the god Bes  (fig. 62).    [Illustration: Fig. 62.--Column with square die, Contra Esneh.]    [Illustration: Fig. 63.--Column with campaniform capital, Ramesseum.]    The column with campaniform capital is mostly employed in the middle avenue  of hypostyle halls, as at Karnak, the Ramesseum, and Luxor (fig. 63); but  it was not restricted to this position, for we also find it in porticoes,  as at Medinet Habu, Edfu, and Philae. The processional hall[13] of  Thothmes III., at Karnak, contains one most curious variety (fig. 64); the  flower is inverted like a bell, and the shaft is turned upside down, the  smaller end being sunk in the plinth, while the larger is fitted to the  wide part of the overturned bell. This ungraceful innovation achieved no  success, and is found nowhere else. Other novelties were happier,  especially those which enabled the artist to introduce decorative elements  taken from the flora of the country. In the earlier examples at Soleb,  Sesebeh, Bubastis, and Memphis, we find a crown of palm branches springing  from the band, their heads being curved beneath the weight of the abacus  (fig. 65). Later on, as we approach the Ptolemaic period, the date and the  half-unfolded lotus were added to the palm-branches (fig. 66).    [Illustration: Fig. 64.--Inverted campaniform capital, Karnak.]    [Illustration: Fig. 65.--Palm capital, Bubastis.]    [Illustration: Fig. 66.--Compound capital.]    Under the Ptolemies and the Caesars the capital became a complete basket of  flowers and leaves, ranged row above row, and painted in the brightest  colours (fig. 67.) At Edfu, Ombos, and Philae one would fancy that the  designer had vowed never to repeat the same pattern in the same portico.    [Illustration: Fig. 67.--Ornate capitals, Ptolemaic.]    [Illustration: Fig. 68.--Lotus-bud column, Beni Hasan.]    [Illustration: Fig. 69.--Lotus-bud column, processional hall, Thothmes  III., Karnak.]    [Illustration: Fig. 70.--Column in the aisles of the hypostyle hall at  Karnak.]      II. _Columns with Lotus-bud Capitals_.--Originally these may perhaps have  represented a bunch of lotus plants, the buds being bound together at the  neck to form the capital. The columns of Beni Hasan consist of four rounded  stems (fig. 68). Those of the Labyrinth, of the processional hall of  Thothmes III., and of Medamot, consist of eight stems, each presenting a  sharp edge on the outer side (fig. 69). The bottom of the column is  bulbous, and set round with triangular leaves. The top is surrounded by  three or five bands. A moulding composed of groups of three vertical  stripes hangs like a fringe from the lowest band in the space between  every two stems. So varied a surface does not admit of hieroglyphic  decoration; therefore the projections were by degrees suppressed, and the  whole shaft was made smooth. In the hypostyle hall at Gurneh, the shaft is  divided in three parts, the middle one being smooth and covered with  sculptures, while the upper and lower divisions are formed of clustered  stems. In the temple of Khonsu, in the aisles of the hypostyle hall of  Karnak, and in the portico of Medinet Habu, the shaft is quite smooth, the  fringe alone being retained below the top bands, while a slight ridge  between each of the three bands recalls the original stems (fig. 70).
