Whatever his intention may have been, his expedition  was a failure, for Melissus, the son of Ithagenes, a man of culture, who  was then in command of the Samian forces, conceiving a contempt for the  small force of the Athenians and the want of experience of their leaders  after Pericles' departure, persuaded his countrymen to attack them. In  the battle the Samians proved victorious, taking many Athenians  prisoners, and destroying many of their ships. By this victory they  obtained command of the sea, and were able to supply themselves with  more warlike stores than they had possessed before. Aristotle even says  that Pericles himself was before this beaten by Melissus in a sea-fight.  The Samians branded the figure of an owl on the foreheads of their  Athenian prisoners, to revenge themselves for the branding of their own  prisoners by the Athenians with the figure of a _samaina_. This is a  ship having a beak turned up like a swine's snout, but with a roomy  hull, so as both to carry a large cargo and sail fast. This class of  vessel is called _samaina_ because it was first built at Samos by  Polycrates, the despot of that island.    When Pericles heard of the disaster which had befallen his army, he  returned in all haste to assist them. He beat Melissus, who came out to  meet him, and, after putting the enemy to rout, at once built a wall  round their city, preferring to reduce it by blockade to risking the  lives of his countrymen in an assault. In the ninth month of the siege  the Samians surrendered. Pericles demolished their walls, confiscated  their fleet, and imposed a heavy fine upon them, some part of which was  paid at once by the Samians, who gave hostages for the payment of the  remainder at fixed periods.    Pericles, after the reduction of Samos, returned to Athens, where he  buried those who had fallen in the war in a magnificent manner, and was  much admired for the funeral oration which, as is customary, was spoken  by him over the graves of his countrymen. Ion says that his victory over  the Samians wonderfully flattered his vanity. Agamemnon, he was wont to  say, took ten years to take a barbarian city, but he in nine months had  made himself master of the first and most powerful city in Ionia. And  the comparison was not an unjust one, for truly the war was a very great  undertaking, and its issue quite uncertain, since, as Thucydides tells  us, the Samians came very near to wresting the empire of the sea from  the Athenians.    After these events, as the clouds were gathering for the Peloponnesian  war, Pericles persuaded the Athenians to send assistance to the people  of Corcyra, who were at war with the Corinthians, and thus to attach to  their own side an island with a powerful naval force, at a moment when  the Peloponnesians had all but declared war against them.    When the people passed this decree, Pericles sent only ten ships under  the command of Lacedaemonius, the son of Cimon, as if he designed a  deliberate insult; for the house of Cimon was on peculiarly friendly  terms with the Lacedaemonians. His design in sending Lacedaemonius out,  against his will, and with so few ships, was that if he performed  nothing brilliant he might be accused, even more than he was already, of  leaning to the side of the Spartans. Indeed, by all means in his power,  he always threw obstacles in the way of the advancement of Cimon's  family, representing that by their very names they were aliens, one son  being named Lacedaemonius, another Thessalus, another Elius. Moreover,  the mother of all three was an Arcadian.    Now Pericles was much reproached for sending these ten ships, which were  of little value to the Corcyreans, and gave a great handle to his  enemies to use against him, and in consequence sent a larger force after  them to Corcyra, which arrived there after the battle. The Corinthians,  enraged at this, complained in the congress of Sparta of the conduct of  the Athenians, as did also the Megarians, who said that they were  excluded from every market and every harbor which was in Athenian hands,  contrary to the ancient rights and common privileges of the Hellenic  race. The people of Aegina also considered themselves to be oppressed  and ill-treated, and secretly bemoaned their grievances in the ears of  the Spartans, for they dared not openly bring any charges against the  Athenians. At this time, too, Potidaea, a city subject to Athens, but a  colony of Corinth, revolted, and its siege materially hastened the  outbreak of the war. Archidamus, indeed, the king of the Lacedaemonians,  sent ambassadors to Athens, was willing to submit all disputed points to  arbitration, and endeavored to moderate the excitement of his allies, so  that war probably would not have broken out if the Athenians could have  been persuaded to rescind their decree of exclusion against the  Megarians, and to come to terms with them. And, for this reason,  Pericles, who was particularly opposed to this, and urged the people not  to give way to the Megarians, alone bore the blame of having begun the  war.    Pericles passed a decree for a herald to be sent to the Megarians, and  then to go on to the Lacedaemonians to complain of their conduct. This  decree of Pericles is worded in a candid and reasonable manner; but the  herald, Anthemocritus, was thought to have met his death at the hands of  the Megarians, and Charinus passed a decree to the effect that Athens  should wage war against them to the death, without truce or armistice;  that any Megarian found in Attica should be punished with death, and  that the generals, when taking the usual oath for each year, should  swear in addition that they would invade the Megarian territory twice  every year; and that Anthemocritus should be buried near the city gate  leading into the Thriasian plain, which is now called the Double Gate.  How the dispute originated it is hard to say, but all writers agree in  throwing on Pericles the blame of refusing to reverse the decree.    Now, as the Lacedaemonians knew that if he could be removed from power  they would find the Athenians much more easy to deal with, they bade  them \"drive forth the accursed thing,\" alluding to Pericles' descent  from the Alcmaeonidae by his mother's side, as we are told by Thucydides  the historian. But this attempt had just the contrary effect to that  which they intended; for, instead of suspicion and dislike, Pericles met  with much greater honor and respect from his countrymen than before,  because they saw that he was an object of especial dislike to the enemy.  For this reason, before the Peloponnesians, under Archidamus, invaded  Attica, he warned the Athenians that if Archidamus, when he laid waste  everything else, spared his own private estate because of the friendly  private relations existing between them, or in order to give his  personal enemies a ground for impeaching him, he should give both the  land and the farm buildings upon it to the state.    The Lacedaemonians invaded Attica with a great host of their own troops  and those of their allies, led by Archidamus, their king. They  proceeded, ravaging the country as they went, as far as Acharnae (close  to Athens), where they encamped, imagining that the Athenians would  never endure to see them there, but would be driven by pride and shame  to come out and fight them. However, Pericles thought that it would be a  very serious matter to fight for the very existence of Athens against  sixty thousand Peloponnesian and Boeotian heavy-armed troops, and so he  pacified those who were dissatisfied at his inactivity by pointing out  that trees when cut down quickly grow again, but that when the men of a  state are lost, it is hard to raise up others to take their place. He  would not call an assembly of the people, because he feared that they  would force him to act against his better judgment, but, just as the  captain of a ship, when a storm comes on at sea, places everything in  the best trim to meet it, and trusting to his own skill and seamanship,  disregarding the tears and entreaties of the seasick and terrified  passengers, so did Pericles shut the gates of Athens, place sufficient  forces to insure the safety of the city at all points, and calmly carry  out his own policy, taking little heed of the noisy grumblings of the  discontented. Many of his friends besought him to attack, many of his  enemies threatened him and abused him, and many songs and offensive  jests were written about him, speaking of him as a coward, and one who  was betraying the city to its enemies. Cleon too attacked him, using the  anger which the citizens felt against him to advance his own personal  popularity.    Pericles was unmoved by any of these attacks, but quietly endured all  this storm of obloquy. He sent a fleet of a hundred ships to attack  Peloponnesus, but did not sail with it himself, remaining at home to  keep a tight hand over Athens until the Peloponnesians drew off their  forces. He regained his popularity with the common people, who suffered  much from the war, by giving them allowances of money from the public  revenue, and grants of land; for he drove out the entire population of  the island of Aegina, and divided the land by lot among the Athenians. A  certain amount of relief also was experienced by reflecting upon the  injuries which they were inflicting on the enemy; for the fleet as it  sailed round Peloponnesus destroyed many small villages and cities, and  ravaged a great extent of country, while Pericles himself led an  expedition into the territory of Megara and laid it all waste. By this  it is clear that the allies, although they did much damage to the  Athenians, yet"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10136"],[0,"The Book of Household Management (#10)"],[1," 1442

CHAPTER I.      THE MISTRESS.    \"Strength, and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to  come. She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of  kindness. She looketh well to the ways of her household; and eateth not  the bread of idleness. Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her  husband also, and he praiseth her.\"--_Proverbs_, xxxi. 25-28.    I. AS WITH THE COMMANDER OF AN ARMY, or the leader of any enterprise, so  is it with the mistress of a house. Her spirit will be seen through the  whole establishment; and just in proportion as she performs her duties  intelligently and thoroughly, so will her domestics follow in her path.  Of all those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the  feminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our  estimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties; for  on these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and  well-being of a family. In this opinion we are borne out by the author  of \"The Vicar of Wakefield,\" who says: \"The modest virgin, the prudent  wife, and the careful matron, are much more serviceable in life than  petticoated philosophers, blustering heroines, or virago queens. She who  makes her husband and her children happy, who reclaims the one from vice  and trains up the other to virtue, is a much greater character than  ladies described in romances, whose whole occupation is to murder  mankind with shafts from their quiver, or their eyes.\"    2. PURSUING THIS PICTURE, we may add, that to be a good housewife does  not necessarily imply an abandonment of proper pleasures or amusing  recreation; and we think it the more necessary to express this, as the  performance of the duties of a mistress may, to some minds, perhaps seem  to be incompatible with the enjoyment of life. Let us, however, now  proceed to describe some of those home qualities and virtues which are  necessary to the proper management of a Household, and then point out  the plan which may be the most profitably pursued for the daily  regulation of its affairs.    3. EARLY RISING IS ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL QUALITIES which enter into  good Household Management, as it is not only the parent of health, but  of innumerable other advantages. Indeed, when a mistress is an early  riser, it is almost certain that her house will be orderly and  well-managed. On the contrary, if she remain in bed till a late hour,  then the domestics, who, as we have before observed, invariably partake  somewhat of their mistress's character, will surely become sluggards. To  self-indulgence all are more or less disposed, and it is not to be  expected that servants are freer from this fault than the heads of  houses. The great Lord Chatham thus gave his advice in reference to this  subject:--\"I would have inscribed on the curtains of your bed, and the  walls of your chamber, 'If you do not rise early, you can make progress  in nothing.'\"    4. CLEANLINESS IS ALSO INDISPENSABLE TO HEALTH, and must be studied both  in regard to the person and the house, and all that it contains. Cold or  tepid baths should be employed every morning, unless, on account of  illness or other circumstances, they should be deemed objectionable. The  bathing of _children_ will be treated of under the head of \"MANAGEMENT  OF CHILDREN.\"    5. FRUGALITY AND ECONOMY ARE HOME VIRTUES, without which no household  can prosper. Dr. Johnson says: \"Frugality may be termed the daughter of  Prudence, the sister of Temperance, and the parent of Liberty. He that  is extravagant will quickly become poor, and poverty will enforce  dependence and invite corruption.\" The"]]]
