[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12985"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions â€” Volume 2 (#10)"],[1," we have said many times before, that much as we revere    Benjamin Harrison's purity and amiability, we cannot but accord the    tribute of our sincerest admiration, to that paragon of American    manhood, Michael J. Kelly.    So when Kelly essayed to change the scene of his labors from the  diamond to the melodramatic stage in 1893 it is not surprising to find  that Field, in a semi-humorous and semi-serious vein, thus applauded  and approved his choice:      Surprise is expressed in certain quarters because Mike Kelly, the    base-ball virtuoso, has made a hit upon the dramatic stage. The    error into which many people have fallen is in supposing that Kelly    was simply a clever base-ball machine. He is very much more than    this: he is an unusually bright and intelligent man. As a class,    base-ball professionals are either dull brutes or ribald brutes;    ignorance as dense as Egyptian darkness has seemed to constitute one    of the essentials to successful base-ball playing, and the average    professional occupies an intellectual plane hardly above that of the    average stall-fed ox or the fat pig at a country fair. Mike Kelly    stands pre-eminent in his profession; no other base-ball player    approaches him. He is in every way qualified for a better career    than that which is bounded on one side by the bleaching boards, and    on the other by the bar-room. Of course he is a good actor. He is    too smart to attempt anything at which he does not excel.    But I have been diverted from telling of the sport in which Field was  an active participant by the recollection of his critical and literary  expertness in the great game in which he never took an active part.  Once when Melville Stone was asked what was his dearest wish at that  instant, he replied, \"to beat Field and Thompson bowling.\" This was in  the days before bowling was the fashionable winter sport it has since  become. The alleys in Chicago in 1885 were neither numerous nor in  first-class condition; but after Field once discovered that he had a  special knack with the finger-balls we hunted them up and tested most  of them. After a while we settled down on the alleys under Slosson's  billiard-room on Monroe Street for our afternoon games and on the  Superior Alleys on North Clark Street on the evenings when it was my  turn to walk home with \"Gene.\" Rolling together we were scarcely ever  overmatched, and he was the better man of the two. He rolled a slow,  insinuating ball. It appeared to amble aimlessly down the alley,  threatening to stop or to sidle off into the gutter for repose. But it  generally had enough momentum and direction to reach the centre pin  quartering, which thereupon, with its nine brothers, seemed suddenly  smitten with the panic so dear to the bowler's heart. I never knew  another bowler so quick to discover the tricks and peculiarities of an  alley or so crafty to master and profit by them. Whenever the hour was  ripe for a game Field would send the boy with some such taunt or  challenge as is shown in the accompanying fac-simile.    I shall never forget, nor would an elaborately colored score by Field  permit me, if I would, his chagrin over the result of one of these  matches. He and Willis Hawkins had challenged Cowen and me to a  tourney, as he called it, of five strings. His record of this \"great  game of skittles,\" all figured out by frames, strikes and spares in  red, blue, yellow, and green ink, shows the following result:      Field      878    Thompson    866    Hawkins    697    Cowen       818              ----               ----              1575               1684    Only one of the three alleys was fit to roll on, and Field scored 231  and 223 in his turns upon it. The modern experts may be interested in  the following details of his high score:      ___________________________________________________________    |    |    |    |    |     |     |     |     |     |      |    |  \\ |  \\ |  \\ |  X |   X |   X |   X |   \\ |   \\ |  X X |    | 18 | 37 | 57 | 87 | 117 | 144 | 164 | 182 | 202 | 231  |  ___________________________________________________________|    It will be perceived that Field's score contained six strikes and five  spares, which was good rolling on a long and not too carefully planed  alley. His average was spoiled by the frames he was forced to roll on  the poorer alleys, where all his cunning could not insure a safe  passage of his slow delivery on their billowy surfaces. Field's  disgust over the result of this game lasted all summer, and Hawkins  was never permitted to forget the part he played in the defeat of \"the  only Bowling King.\"    [Illustration: A BOWLING CHALLENGE FROM EUGENE FIELD.      Who is this graceful, agile king      In proud but modest garb revealed?    He is the only Bowling King,    And loud and long the people sing      The prowess of Old Field.      How slender yet how lithe is he      And when unto the fray he glides    So awful is his majesty    That Nompy fears his wrath to be      And straightway runs and hides.      May 4th, 1886.]    During the fall of 1886 I went to New Brunswick on my annual vacation,  and Field fairly out-did himself in keeping me informed of how \"matters  and things\" moved along at the office while I was gone. It pleased his  sense of humor to dispatch a letter to me every evening invariably  addressed \"For Sir Slosson Thomson.\" As these letters ran the gamut of  the subjects uppermost in Field's life at this time, I give them in the  order of their receipt:      I      CHICAGO, September 10th (Friday night), 1886.      Dear Nomp: Hawkins, Cowen and I went out to the base-ball game    together to-day and saw the champions down the Detroits to the tune    of 14 to 8. It was a great slugging match all around. Conway pitched    for Detroit and McCormick for Chicago. As I say, there was terrific    batting; on the part of Chicago, Gore made 1 base hit, Kelly 3,    Anson 2, Pfeffer 3, Williamson 1, Burns 1 and Ryan 2; on the part of    Detroit. Richardson made 2, Brouthers 4, Thompson 1 and Dunlap 1.    The Chicagos played in excellent form, yet batting seemed to be    _the_ feature of the game. McCormick struck out 6 men and gave    2 men bases on called balls; Conway struck out 4 men and gave 4    bases on balls. Brouthers made 3 home runs, but there happened to be    no one on bases at the time. There was such a large crowd of    spectators that Hawkins, Cowen and I had to sit on the roof of the    grand-stand. The sun cast its rays on us, and it was hot! [Here    followed a detailed pen-and-ink sketch of the scene.]      Whilst I was drawing this _chef d'oeuvre_ (and, by the way, it    took an hour to do it) Ballantyne came in. \"That's mighty good,\"    said he; \"are you making it for the paper?\"      I understand that Stone has sailed out of town again, this time to    Kansas City. Poor man! his slavish devotion to the details of his    newspaper is simply grinding the life out of him.      Mrs. Billings [Field's sister-in-law] has arrived from Washington    and she will go down to St. Louis with Julia and Mrs. Ballantyne    next Monday morning. Later in the fall she will make us a visit.      Cowen pawned his watch to-day for $40 and bet $30 to $21 on the    Chicagos. This is the result by innings: [Here followed another    drawing as shown in the accompanying fac-simile.] The watch retained    its normal size for two innings, but in the third it shrank so sadly    as to become hardly visible to the mind's eye. In the fourth inning,    however, it began to pick up, and in the seventh it had resumed its    normal shape, and in the ninth it was as big as a dinner-plate and    we could hear it tick, although hung in Moses Levy's secluded    retreat on Dearborn Street, two and one-half miles distant. As we    were riding over to the base-ball grounds Cowen's eyes rested on a    vision of female loveliness--a girl he knew--standing on the corner    of Madison and Aberdeen Streets. It was all Hawkins and I could do    to hold him in the car. But I am determined to save this young and    interesting soul if I can. Peattie and his wife start for Colorado    next Monday. 'Tis now 11 o'clock. Where are you that you are not    here to walk with me? Tossing in the \"upper ten\" [another drawing]    and struggling for fresh air! Well, good-by and bless you, old boy.      Affectionately yours,      EUGENE FIELD.    [Illustration: A LETTER FROM EUGENE FIELD CONTAINING THREE DRAWINGS.]    If the reader is at all curious in such matters, a cursory inspection  of the illustrations of this letter will assure him that its composition  and embellishment must have cost its fanciful writer at least three  hours' work. But this was the kind of work that lightened the toil of  Field's daily grind.      II      (Written in gamboge ink) CHICAGO, Sunday night, September the 12th,    1886.      Dear Nomp:--You have been gone but forty-eight hours--it seems an    age. I have been thinking the matter over and I have come to the    appalling conclusion that I shall starve before you get back,    unless, perchance, in the meantime, Marie Matilda or some fair    unknown sends me truage that can be realized upon.      Dock has returned with an air of rusticity that makes me shiver when    I think of all he has got to go through with before you come to the    rescue. My wife goes to St. Louis to-morrow and I shall be on the    turf for one long week. Ballantyne, Cowen, Dennis and I went to the    base-ball game yesterday--10,000 people; enthusiasm; slugging game;    Chicago fielded beautifully; Chicagos 14, Detroits 4--that's all    I've got to say on that subject. I have sent a personal to each of    the Denver papers announcing that Mr. and Mrs. Peattie are there on    their bridal tour. I have given Peattie divers letters of    introduction to Denver folks: to Dr. Lemen, introducing him as an    invalid; to Judge Tall, as a client; to Fred Skiff, as a rich young   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130"],[0,"Orthodoxy (#10)"],[1," them well.  It is, on the contrary,  a thing analogous to writing one's own love-letters or blowing  one's own nose.  These things we want a man to do for himself,  even if he does them badly.  I am not here arguing the truth of any  of these conceptions; I know that some moderns are asking to have  their wives chosen by scientists, and they may soon be asking,  for all I know, to have their noses blown by nurses.  I merely  say that mankind does recognize these universal human functions,  and that democracy classes government among them.  In short,  the democratic faith is this:  that the most terribly important things  must be left to ordinary men themselves--the mating of the sexes,  the rearing of the young, the laws of the state.  This is democracy;  and in this I have always believed.         But there is one thing that I have never from my youth up been  able to understand.  I have never been able to understand where people  got the idea that democracy was in some way opposed to tradition.  It is obvious that tradition is only democracy extended through time.  It is trusting to a consensus of common human voices rather than to  some isolated or arbitrary record.  The man who quotes some German  historian against the tradition of the Catholic Church, for instance,  is strictly appealing to aristocracy.  He is appealing to the  superiority of one expert against the awful authority of a mob.  It is quite easy to see why a legend is treated, and ought to be treated,  more respectfully than a book of history.  The legend is generally  made by the majority of people in the village, who are sane.  The book is generally written by the one man in the village who is mad.  Those who urge against tradition that men in the past were ignorant  may go and urge it at the Carlton Club, along with the statement  that voters in the slums are ignorant.  It will not do for us.  If we attach great importance to the opinion of ordinary men in great  unanimity when we are dealing with daily matters, there is no reason  why we should disregard it when we are dealing with history or fable.  Tradition may be defined as an extension of the franchise.  Tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes,  our ancestors.  It is the democracy of the dead.  Tradition refuses  to submit to the small and arrogant oligarchy of those who merely  happen to be walking about.  All democrats object to men being  disqualified by the accident of birth; tradition objects to their  being disqualified by the accident of death.  Democracy tells us  not to neglect a good man's opinion, even if he is our groom;  tradition asks us not to neglect a good man's opinion, even if he is  our father.  I, at any rate, cannot separate the two ideas of democracy  and tradition; it seems evident to me that they are the same idea.  We will have the dead at our councils.  The ancient Greeks voted  by stones; these shall vote by tombstones.  It is all quite regular  and official, for most tombstones, like most ballot papers, are marked  with a cross.         I have first to say, therefore, that if I have had a bias, it was  always a bias in favour of democracy, and therefore of tradition.  Before we come to any theoretic or logical beginnings I am content  to allow for that personal equation; I have always been more  inclined to believe the ruck of hard-working people than to believe  that special and troublesome literary class to which I belong.  I prefer even the fancies and prejudices of the people who see  life from the inside to the clearest demonstrations of the people  who see life from the outside.  I would always trust the old wives'  fables against the old maids' facts.  As long as wit is mother wit it  can be as wild as it pleases.         Now, I have to put together a general position, and I pretend  to no training in such things.  I propose to do it, therefore,  by writing down one after another the three or four fundamental  ideas which I have found for myself, pretty much in the way  that I found them.  Then I shall roughly synthesise them,  summing up my personal philosophy or natural religion; then I  shall describe my startling discovery that the whole thing had  been discovered before.  It had been discovered by Christianity.  But of these profound persuasions which I have to recount in order,  the earliest was concerned with this element of popular tradition.  And without the foregoing explanation touching tradition and  democracy I could hardly make my mental experience clear.  As it is,  I do not know whether I can make it clear, but I now propose to try.         My first and last philosophy, that which I believe in with  unbroken certainty, I learnt in the nursery.  I generally learnt it  from a nurse; that is, from the solemn and star-appointed priestess  at once of democracy and tradition.  The things I believed most then,  the things I believe most now, are the things called fairy tales.  They seem to me to be the entirely reasonable things.  They are  not fantasies:  compared with them other things are fantastic.  Compared with them religion and rationalism are both abnormal,  though religion is abnormally right and rationalism abnormally wrong.  Fairyland is nothing but the sunny country of common sense.  It is not earth that judges heaven, but heaven that judges earth;  so for me at least it was not earth that criticised elfland,  but elfland that criticised the earth.  I knew the magic beanstalk  before I had tasted beans; I was sure of the Man in the Moon before I  was certain of the moon.  This was at one with all popular tradition.  Modern minor poets are naturalists, and talk about the bush or the brook;  but the singers of the old epics and fables were supernaturalists,  and talked about the gods of brook and bush.  That is what the moderns  mean when they say that the ancients did not \"appreciate Nature,\"  because they said that Nature was divine.  Old nurses do not  tell children about the grass, but about the fairies that dance  on the grass; and the old Greeks could not see the trees for  the dryads.         But I deal here with what ethic and philosophy come from being  fed on fairy tales.  If I were describing them in detail I could  note many noble and healthy principles that arise from them.  There is the chivalrous lesson of \"Jack the Giant Killer\"; that giants  should be killed because they are gigantic.  It is a manly mutiny  against pride as such.  For the rebel is older than all the kingdoms,  and the Jacobin has more tradition than the Jacobite.  There is the  lesson of \"Cinderella,\" which is the same as that of the Magnificat--  EXALTAVIT HUMILES.  There is the great lesson of \"Beauty and the Beast\";  that a thing must be loved BEFORE it is loveable.  There is the  terrible allegory of the \"Sleeping Beauty,\" which tells how the human  creature was blessed with all birthday gifts, yet cursed with death;  and how death also may perhaps be softened to a sleep.  But I am  not concerned with any of the separate statutes of elfland, but with  the whole spirit of its law, which I learnt before I could speak,  and shall retain when I cannot write.  I am concerned with a certain  way of looking at life, which was created in me by the fairy tales,  but has since been meekly ratified by the mere facts.         It might be stated this way.  There are certain sequences  or developments (cases of one thing following another), which are,  in the true sense of the word, reasonable.  They are, in the true  sense of the word, necessary.  Such are mathematical and merely  logical sequences.  We in fairyland (who are the most reasonable  of all creatures) admit that reason and that necessity.  For instance, if the Ugly Sisters are older than Cinderella,  it is (in an iron and awful sense) NECESSARY that Cinderella is  younger than the Ugly Sisters.  There is no getting out of it.  Haeckel may talk as much fatalism about that fact as he pleases:  it really must be.  If Jack is the son of a miller, a miller is  the father of Jack.  Cold reason decrees it from her awful throne:  and we in fairyland submit.  If the three brothers all ride horses,  there are six animals and eighteen legs involved:  that is true  rationalism, and fairyland is full of it.  But as I put my head over  the hedge of the elves and began to take notice of the natural world,  I observed an extraordinary thing.  I observed that learned men  in spectacles were talking of the actual things that happened--  dawn and death and so on--as if THEY were rational and inevitable.  They talked as if the fact that trees bear fruit were just as NECESSARY  as the fact that two and one trees make three.  But it is not.  There is an enormous difference by the test of fairyland; which is  the test of the imagination.  You cannot IMAGINE two and one not  making three.  But you can easily imagine trees not growing fruit;  you can imagine them growing golden candlesticks or tigers hanging  on by the tail.  These men in spectacles spoke much of a man  named Newton, who was hit by an apple, and who discovered a law.  But they could not be got to see the distinction between a true law,  a law of reason, and the mere fact of apples falling.  If the apple hit  Newton's nose, Newton's nose hit the apple.  That is a true necessity:  because we cannot conceive the one occurring without the other.  But we can quite well conceive the apple not falling on his nose;  we can fancy it flying ardently through the air to hit some other nose,  of which it had a more definite dislike.  We have always in our fairy  tales kept this sharp distinction between the science of mental relations,  in which there really are laws, and the science of physical facts,  in which there are no laws, but only weird repetitions.  We believe  in bodily miracles, but not in mental impossibilities.  We believe  that a Bean-stalk climbed up to Heaven; but that does not at all  confuse our convictions on the"]]]
