Speed fortune then her wheel, as likes her best,  The clown his mattock; all things have their course.\"       Thereat my sapient guide upon his right  Turn'd himself back, then look'd at me and spake:  \"He listens to good purpose who takes note.\"       I not the less still on my way proceed,  Discoursing with Brunetto, and inquire  Who are most known and chief among his tribe.       \"To know of some is well;\" thus he replied,  \"But of the rest silence may best beseem.  Time would not serve us for report so long.  In brief I tell thee, that all these were clerks,  Men of great learning and no less renown,  By one same sin polluted in the world.  With them is Priscian, and Accorso's son  Francesco herds among that wretched throng:  And, if the wish of so impure a blotch  Possess'd thee, him thou also might'st have seen,  Who by the servants' servant was transferr'd  From Arno's seat to Bacchiglione, where  His ill-strain'd nerves he left.  I more would add,  But must from farther speech and onward way  Alike desist, for yonder I behold  A mist new-risen on the sandy plain.  A company, with whom I may not sort,  Approaches.  I commend my TREASURE to thee,  Wherein I yet survive; my sole request.\"       This said he turn'd, and seem'd as one of those,  Who o'er Verona's champain try their speed  For the green mantle, and of them he seem'd,  Not he who loses but who gains the prize.        CANTO XVI    NOW came I where the water's din was heard,  As down it fell into the other round,  Resounding like the hum of swarming bees:  When forth together issu'd from a troop,  That pass'd beneath the fierce tormenting storm,  Three spirits, running swift.  They towards us came,  And each one cried aloud, \"Oh do thou stay!  Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem  To be some inmate of our evil land.\"       Ah me! what wounds I mark'd upon their limbs,  Recent and old, inflicted by the flames!  E'en the remembrance of them grieves me yet.       Attentive to their cry my teacher paus'd,  And turn'd to me his visage, and then spake;  \"Wait now! our courtesy these merit well:  And were 't not for the nature of the place,  Whence glide the fiery darts, I should have said,  That haste had better suited thee than them.''       They, when we stopp'd, resum'd their ancient wail,  And soon as they had reach'd us, all the three  Whirl'd round together in one restless wheel.  As naked champions, smear'd with slippery oil,  Are wont intent to watch their place of hold  And vantage, ere in closer strife they meet;  Thus each one, as he wheel'd, his countenance  At me directed, so that opposite  The neck mov'd ever to the twinkling feet.       \"If misery of this drear wilderness,\"  Thus one began, \"added to our sad cheer  And destitute, do call forth scorn on us  And our entreaties, let our great renown  Incline thee to inform us who thou art,  That dost imprint with living feet unharm'd  The soil of Hell.  He, in whose track thou see'st  My steps pursuing, naked though he be  And reft of all, was of more high estate  Than thou believest; grandchild of the chaste  Gualdrada, him they Guidoguerra call'd,  Who in his lifetime many a noble act  Achiev'd, both by his wisdom and his sword.  The other, next to me that beats the sand,  Is Aldobrandi, name deserving well,  In the' upper world, of honour; and myself  Who in this torment do partake with them,  Am Rusticucci, whom, past doubt, my wife  Of savage temper, more than aught beside  Hath to this evil brought.\"  If from the fire  I had been shelter'd, down amidst them straight  I then had cast me, nor my guide, I deem,  Would have restrain'd my going; but that fear  Of the dire burning vanquish'd the desire,  Which made me eager of their wish'd embrace.       I then began:  \"Not scorn, but grief much more,  Such as long time alone can cure, your doom  Fix'd deep within me, soon as this my lord  Spake words, whose tenour taught me to expect  That such a race, as ye are, was at hand.  I am a countryman of yours, who still  Affectionate have utter'd, and have heard  Your deeds and names renown'd.  Leaving the gall  For the sweet fruit I go, that a sure guide  Hath promis'd to me.  But behooves, that far  As to the centre first I downward tend.\"       \"So may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs,\"  He answer straight return'd; \"and so thy fame  Shine bright, when thou art gone; as thou shalt tell,  If courtesy and valour, as they wont,  Dwell in our city, or have vanish'd clean?  For one amidst us late condemn'd to wail,  Borsiere, yonder walking with his peers,  Grieves us no little by the news he brings.\"       \"An upstart multitude and sudden gains,  Pride and excess, O Florence! have in thee  Engender'd, so that now in tears thou mourn'st!\"  Thus cried I with my face uprais'd, and they  All three, who for an answer took my words,  Look'd at each other, as men look when truth  Comes to their ear.  \"If thou at other times,\"  They all at once rejoin'd, \"so easily  Satisfy those, who question, happy thou,  Gifted with words, so apt to speak thy thought!  Wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime,  Returning to behold the radiant stars,  When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past,  See that of us thou speak among mankind.\"       This said, they broke the circle, and so swift  Fled, that as pinions seem'd their nimble feet.       Not in so short a time might one have said  \"Amen,\" as they had vanish'd. Straight my guide  Pursu'd his track.  I follow'd; and small space  Had we pass'd onward, when the water's sound  Was now so near at hand, that we had scarce  Heard one another's speech for the loud din.       E'en as the river, that holds on its course  Unmingled, from the mount of Vesulo,  On the left side of Apennine, toward  The east, which Acquacheta higher up  They call, ere it descend into the vale,  At Forli by that name no longer known,  Rebellows o'er Saint Benedict, roll'd on  From the' Alpine summit down a precipice,  Where space enough to lodge a thousand spreads;  Thus downward from a craggy steep we found,  That this dark wave resounded, roaring loud,  So that the ear its clamour soon had stunn'd.       I had a cord that brac'd my girdle round,  Wherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take  The painted leopard.  This when I had all  Unloosen'd from me (so my master bade)  I gather'd up, and stretch'd it forth to him.  Then to the right he turn'd, and from the brink  Standing few paces distant, cast it down  Into the deep abyss.  \"And somewhat strange,\"  Thus to myself I spake, \"signal so strange  Betokens, which my guide with earnest eye  Thus follows.\"  Ah! what caution must men use  With those who look not at the deed alone,  But spy into the thoughts with subtle skill!       \"Quickly shall come,\" he said, \"what I expect,  Thine eye discover quickly, that whereof  Thy thought is dreaming.\"  Ever to that truth,  Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears,  A man, if possible, should bar his lip;  Since, although blameless, he incurs reproach.  But silence here were vain; and by these notes  Which now I sing, reader!  I swear to thee,  So may they favour find to latest times!  That through the gross and murky air I spied  A shape come swimming up, that might have quell'd  The stoutest heart with wonder, in such guise  As one returns, who hath been down to loose  An anchor grappled fast against some rock,  Or to aught else that in the salt wave lies,  Who upward springing close draws in his feet.        CANTO XVII    \"LO! the fell monster with the deadly sting!  Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls  And firm embattled spears, and with his filth  Taints all the world!\"  Thus me my guide address'd,  And beckon'd him, that he should come to shore,  Near to the stony causeway's utmost edge.       Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear'd,  His head and upper part expos'd on land,  But laid not on the shore his bestial train.  His face the semblance of a just man's wore,  So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;  The rest was serpent all:  two shaggy claws  Reach'd to the armpits, and the back and breast,  And either side, were painted o'er with nodes  And orbits.  Colours variegated more  Nor Turks nor Tartars e'er on cloth of state  With interchangeable embroidery wove,  Nor spread Arachne o'er her curious loom.  As ofttimes a light skiff, moor'd to the shore,  Stands part in water, part upon the land;  Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,  The beaver settles watching for his prey;  So on the rim, that fenc'd the sand with rock,  Sat perch'd the fiend of evil.  In the void  Glancing, his tail upturn'd its venomous fork,  With sting like scorpion's arm'd.  Then thus my guide:  \"Now need our way must turn few steps apart,  Far as to that ill beast, who couches there.\"       Thereat toward the right our downward course  We shap'd, and, better to escape the flame  And burning marle, ten paces on the verge  Proceeded.  Soon as we to him arrive,  A little further on mine eye beholds  A tribe of spirits, seated on the sand  Near the wide chasm.  Forthwith my master spake:  \"That to the full thy knowledge may extend  Of all this round contains, go now, and mark  The mien these wear:  but hold not long discourse.  Till thou returnest, I with him meantime  Will parley, that to us he may vouchsafe  The aid of his strong shoulders.\"  Thus alone  Yet forward on the' extremity I pac'd  Of that seventh circle, where the mournful tribe  Were seated.  At the eyes forth gush'd their pangs.  Against the vapours and the torrid soil  Alternately their shifting hands they plied.  Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply  Their jaws and feet by turns, when bitten sore  By gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round.       Noting the visages of some, who lay  Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire,  One of them all I knew not; but perceiv'd,  That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch  With colours and with emblems various mark'd,  On which it seem'd as if "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10084"],[0,"Kazan (#10)"],[1," you please come--soon?\"    \"After I smoke,\" he said. \"Are you comfortable?\"    \"Yes, I'm so tired--and--sleepy--\"    Pierre laughed softly. In the darkness he was gripping at his throat.    \"We're almost home, Joan. That is our river out there--the Little  Beaver. If I should run away and leave you to-night you could follow it  right to our cabin. It's only forty miles. Do you hear?\"    \"Yes--I know--\"    \"Forty miles--straight down the river. You couldn't lose yourself, Joan.  Only you'd have to be careful of air-holes in the ice.\"    \"Won't you come to bed, father? You're tired--and almost sick.\"    \"Yes--after I smoke,\" he repeated. \"Joan, will you keep reminding me  to-morrow of the air-holes? I might forget. You can always tell them,  for the snow and the crust over them are whiter than that on the rest of  the ice, and like a sponge. Will you remember--the airholes--\"    \"Yes-s-s-s--\"    Pierre dropped the tent-flap and returned to the fire. He staggered as  he walked.    \"Good night, boy,\" he said. \"Guess I'd better go in with the kids. Two  days more--forty miles--two days--\"    Kazan watched him as he entered the tent. He laid his weight against the  end of his chain until the collar shut off his wind. His legs and back  twitched. In that tent where Radisson had gone were Joan and the baby.  He knew that Pierre would not hurt them, but he knew also that with  Pierre Radisson something terrible and impending was hovering very near  to them. He wanted the man outside--by the fire--where he could lie  still, and watch him.    In the tent there was silence. Nearer to him than before came Gray  Wolf's cry. Each night she was calling earlier, and coming closer to the  camp. He wanted her very near to him to-night, but he did not even whine  in response. He dared not break that strange silence in the tent. He lay  still for a long time, tired and lame from the day's journey, but  sleepless. The fire burned lower; the wind in the tree-tops died away;  and the thick gray clouds rolled like a massive curtain from under the  skies. The stars began to glow white and metallic, and from far in the  North there came faintly a crisping moaning sound, like steel  sleigh-runners running over frosty snow--the mysterious monotone of the  Northern Lights. After that it grew steadily and swiftly colder.    To-night Gray Wolf did not compass herself by the direction of the wind.  She followed like a sneaking shadow over the trail Pierre Radisson had  made, and when Kazan heard her again, long after midnight, he lay with,  his head erect, and his body rigid, save for a curious twitching of his  muscles. There was a new note in Gray Wolf's voice, a wailing note in  which there was more than the mate-call. It was The Message. And at the  sound of it Kazan rose from out of his silence and his fear, and with  his head turned straight up to the sky he howled as the wild dogs of the  North howl before the tepees of masters who are newly dead.    Pierre Radisson was dead.          CHAPTER VII    OUT OF THE BLIZZARD      It was dawn when the baby snuggled close to Joan's warm breast and  awakened her with its cry of hunger. She opened her eyes, brushed back  the thick hair from her face, and could see where the shadowy form of  her father was lying at the other side of the tent. He was very quiet,  and she was pleased that he was still sleeping. She knew that the day  before he had been very near to exhaustion, and so for half an hour  longer she lay quiet, cooing softly to the baby Joan. Then she arose  cautiously, tucked the baby in the warm blankets and furs, put on her  heavier garments, and went outside.    By this time it was broad day, and she breathed a sigh of relief when  she saw that the storm had passed. It was bitterly cold. It seemed to  her that she had never known it to be so cold in all her life. The fire  was completely out. Kazan was huddled in a round ball, his nose tucked  under his body. He raised his head, shivering, as Joan came out. With  her heavily moccasined foot Joan scattered the ashes and charred sticks  where the fire had been. There was not a spark left. In returning to the  tent she stopped for a moment beside Kazan, and patted his shaggy head.    \"Poor Wolf!\" she said. \"I wish I had given you one of the bearskins!\"    She threw back the tent-flap and entered. For the first time she saw her  father's face in the light--and outside, Kazan heard the terrible  moaning cry that broke from her lips. No one could have looked at Pierre  Radisson's face once--and not have understood.    After that one agonizing cry, Joan flung herself upon her father's  breast, sobbing so softly that even Kazan's sharp ears heard no sound.  She remained there in her grief until every vital energy of womanhood  and motherhood in her girlish body was roused to action by the wailing  cry of baby Joan. Then she sprang to her feet and ran out through the  tent opening. Kazan tugged at the end of his chain to meet her, but she  saw nothing of him now. The terror of the wilderness is greater than  that of death, and in an instant it had fallen upon Joan. It was not  because of fear for herself. It was the baby. The wailing cries from the  tent pierced her like knife-thrusts.    And then, all at once, there came to her what old Pierre had said the  night before--his words about the river, the air-holes, the home forty  miles away. \"_You couldn't lose yourself, Joan_\" He had guessed what  might happen.    She bundled the baby deep in the furs and returned to the fire-bed. Her  one thought now was that they must have fire. She made a little pile of  birch-bark, covered it with half-burned bits of wood, and went into the  tent for the matches. Pierre Radisson carried them in a water-proof box  in a pocket of his bearskin coat. She sobbed as she kneeled beside him  again, and obtained the box. As the fire flared up she added other bits  of wood, and then some of the larger pieces that Pierre had dragged into  camp. The fire gave her courage. Forty miles--and the river led to their  home! She must make that, with the baby and Wolf. For the first time  she turned to him, and spoke his name as she put her hand on his head.  After that she gave him a chunk of meat which she thawed out over the  fire, and melted the snow for tea. She was not hungry, but she recalled  how her father had made her eat four or five times a day, so she forced  herself to make a breakfast of a biscuit, a shred of meat and as much  hot tea as she could drink.    The terrible hour she dreaded followed that. She wrapped blankets  closely about her father's body, and tied them with babiche cord. After  that she piled all the furs and blankets that remained on the sledge  close to the fire, and snuggled baby Joan deep down in them. Pulling  down the tent was a task. The ropes were stiff and frozen, and when she  had finished, one of her hands was bleeding. She piled the tent on the  sledge, and then, half, covering her face, turned and looked back.    Pierre Radisson lay on his balsam bed, with nothing over him now but the  gray sky and the spruce-tops. Kazan stood stiff-legged and sniffed the  air. His spine bristled when Joan went back slowly and kneeled beside  the blanket-wrapped object. When she returned to him her face was white  and tense, and now there was a strange and terrible look in her eyes as  she stared out across the barren. She put him in the traces, and  fastened about her slender waist the strap that Pierre had used. Thus  they struck out for the river, floundering knee-deep in the freshly  fallen and drifted snow. Half-way Joan stumbled in a drift and fell, her  loose hair flying in a shimmering veil over the snow. With a mighty pull  Kazan was at her side, and his cold muzzle touched her face as she drew  herself to her feet. For a moment Joan took his shaggy head between her  two hands.    \"Wolf!\" she moaned. \"Oh, Wolf!\"    She went on, her breath coming pantingly now, even from her brief  exertion. The snow was not so deep on the ice of the river. But a wind  was rising. It came from the north and east, straight in her face, and  Joan bowed her head as she pulled with Kazan. Half a mile down the river  she stopped, and no longer could she repress the hopelessness that rose  to her lips in a sobbing choking cry. Forty miles! She clutched her  hands at her breast, and stood breathing like one who had been beaten,  her back to the wind. The baby was quiet. Joan went back and peered down  under the furs, and what she saw there spurred her on again almost  fiercely. Twice she stumbled to her knees in the drifts during the next  quarter of a mile.    After that there was a stretch of wind-swept ice, and Kazan pulled the  sledge alone. Joan walked at his side. There was a pain in her chest. A  thousand needles seemed pricking her face, and suddenly she remembered  the thermometer. She exposed it for a time on the top of the tent. When  she looked at it a few minutes later it was thirty degrees below zero.  Forty miles! And her father had told her that she could make it--and  could not lose herself! But she did not know that even her father would  have been afraid to face the north that day, with the temperature at  thirty below, and a moaning wind bringing the first warning of a  blizzard.    The timber was far behind her now. Ahead there was nothing but the  pitiless barren, and the timber beyond that was hidden by the gray gloom  of the day. If there had been trees, Joan's heart would not have choked  so with terror. But there was nothing--nothing but that gray ghostly  gloom, with the rim of the sky touching the earth a mile away.    The snow grew heavy under her feet again. Always she was watching for  those treacherous, frost-coated traps in the ice her father had spoken  of. But she found now that all the ice and snow looked alike to her, and  that there was a growing pain back of her eyes. It was the intense cold.    The river widened into a"]]]
