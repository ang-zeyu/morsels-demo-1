The adding some part of the royal arms to his own,  was also made a pretence against him, but in this he was justified by  the heralds, as he proved that a power of doing so was granted by some  preceeding Monarchs to his forefathers. Upon the strength of these  suspicions and surmises, he and his father were committed to the Tower  of London, the one by water, the other by land, so that they knew  not of each other's apprehension. The fifteenth day of January next  following he was arraigned at Guildhall, where he was found guilty by  twelve common jurymen, and received judgment. About nine days before  the death of the King he lost his head on Tower-Hill; and had not that  Monarch's decease so soon ensued, the fate of his father was likewise  determined to have been the same with his sons.    It is said, when a courtier asked King Henry why he was so zealous in  taking off Surry; \"I observed him, says he, an enterprizing youth; his  spirit was too great to brook subjection, and 'tho' I can manage him,  yet no successor of mine will ever be able to do so; for which reason  I have dispatched him in my own time.\"    He was first interred in the chapel of the Tower, and afterwards in  the reign of King James, his remains were removed to Farmingam in  Suffolk, by his second son Henry Earl of Northampton, with this  epitaph.

Upon the accession of Queen Mary the attainder was taken off his  father, which circumstance has furnished some people with an  opportunity to say, that the princess was fond of, and would have  married, the Earl of Surry. I shall transcribe the act of repeal as I  find it in Collins's Peerage of England, which has something singular  enough in it.    'That there was no special matter in the Act of Attainder, but only  general words of treason and conspiracy: and that out of their care  for the preservation of the King and the Prince they passed it, and  this Act of Repeal further sets forth, that the only thing of which he  stood charged, was for bearing of arms, which he and his ancestors had  born within and without the kingdom in the King's presence, and sight  of his progenitors, as they might lawfully bear and give, as by good  and substantial matter of record it did appear. It also added, that  the King died after the date of the commission; likewise that he only  empowered them to give his consent; but did not give it himself; and  that it did not appear by any record that they gave it. Moreover, that  the King did not sign the commission with his own hand, his stamp  being only set to it, and that not to the upper part, but to the  nether part of it, contrary to the King's custom.'    Besides the amorous and other poetical pieces of this noble author, he  translated Virgil's AEneid, and rendered (says Wood) the first, second,  and third book almost word for word:--All the Biographers of the  poets have been lavish, and very justly, in his praise; he merits the  highest encomiums as the refiner of our language, and challenges the  gratitude and esteem of every man of literature, for the generous  assistance he afforded it in its infancy, and his ready and liberal  patronage to all men of merit in his time.      [Footnote 1: Dugdale's Baronage.]           *       *       *       *       *      Sir THOMAS WYAT.    Was distinguished by the appellation of the Elder, as there was one of  the same name who raised a rebellion in the time of Queen Mary. He  was son to Henry Wyat of Alington-castle in Kent. He received the  rudiments of his education at Cambridge, and was afterwards placed at  Oxford to finish it. He was in great esteem with King Henry VIII. on  account of his wit and Love Elegies, pieces of poetry in which he  remarkably succeeded. The affair of Anne Bullen came on, when he made  some opposition to the King's passion for her, that was likely to  prove fatal to him; but by his prudent behaviour, and retracting  what he had formerly advanced, he was restored again to his royal  patronage. He was cotemporary with the Earl of Surry, who held him in  high esteem. He travelled into foreign parts, and as we have observed  in the Earl of Surry's life, he added something towards refining the  English stile, and polishing our numbers, tho' he seems not to have  done so much in that way as his lordship. Pitts and Bale have entirely  neglected him, yet for his translation of David's Psalms into English  metre and other poetical works, Leland scruples not to compare him  with Dante and Petrarch, by giving him this ample commendation.      Let Florence fair her Dantes justly boast,    And royal Rome, her Petrarchs numbered feet,    In English Wyat both of them doth coast:    In whom all graceful eloquence doth meet.    Leland published all his works under the title of Naenia. Some of his  Biographers (Mrs. Cooper and Winstanley) say that he died of the  plague as he was going on an embassy to the Emperor Charles V. but  Wood asserts, that he was only sent to Falmo by the King to meet the  Spanish ambassador on the road, and conduct him to the court, which it  seems demanded very great expedition; that by over-fatiguing himself,  he was thrown into a fever, and in the thirty-eighth year of his age  died in a little country-town in England, greatly lamented by all  lovers of learning and politeness. In his poetical capacity, he does  not appear to have much imagination, neither are his verses so musical  and well polished as lord Surry's. Those of gallantry in particular  seem to be too artificial and laboured for a lover, without that  artless simplicity which is the genuine mark of feeling; and too  stiff, and negligent of harmony for a His letters to John Poynes and  Sir Francis Bryan deserve more notice, they argue him a man of great  sense and honour, a critical observer of manners and well-qualified  for an elegant and genteel satirist. These letters contain  observations on the Courtier's Life, and I shall quote a few lines as  a specimen, by which it will be seen how much he falls short of  his noble cotemporary, lord Surry, and is above those writers that  preceded him in versification.      The COURTIERS LIFE.      In court to serve decked with fresh araye,    Of sugared meats seling the sweet repast,    The life in blankets, and sundry kinds of playe,    Amidst the press the worldly looks to waste,    Hath with it joyned oft such bitter taste,    That whoso joys such kind of life to holde,    In prison joys, fetter'd with chains of golde.           *       *       *       *       *      THOMAS SACKVILLE, Earl DORSET    Was son of Richard Sackville and Winifrede, daughter of Sir John  Bruges, Lord of London.[1] He was born at Buckhurst in the parish of  Withiam in Suffex, and from his childhood was distinguished for wit  and manly behaviour: He was first of the University of Oxford, but  taking no degree there, he went to Cambridge, and commenced master of  arts; he afterwards studied the law in the Inner-Temple, and became a  barrister; but his genius being too lively to be confined to a dull  plodding study, he chose rather to dedicate his hours to poetry and  pleasure; he was the first that wrote scenes in verse, the Tragedy of  Ferrex and Perrex, sons to Gorboduc King of Britain, being performed  in the presence of Queen Elizabeth, long before Shakespear appeared[2]  on the stage, by the Gentlemen of the Inner-Temple, at Whitehall the  18th of January, 1561, which Sir Philip Sidney thus characterises: \"It  is full of stately speeches, and well founding phrases, climbing to  the height of Seneca's stile, and as full of notable morality, which  it doth most delightfully teach, and so obtain the very end of  poetry.\" In the course of his studies, he was most delighted with the  history of his own country, and being likewise well acquainted with  antient history, he formed a design of writing the lives of several  great personages in verse, of which we have a specimen in a book  published 1610, called the Mirror of Magistrates, being a true  Chronicle History of the untimely falls of such unfortunate princes  and men of note, as have happened since the first entrance of Brute  into this Island until his own time. It appears by a preface of  Richard Nicolls, that the original plan of the Mirror of Magistrates  was principally owing to him, a work of great labour, use and beauty.  The induction, from which I shall quote a few lines, is indeed a  master-piece, and if the-whole could have been compleated in the same  manner, it would have been an honour to the nation to this day, nor  could have sunk under the ruins of time; but the courtier put an end  to the poet; and one cannot help wishing for the sake of our national  reputation, that his rise at court had been a little longer delayed:  It may easily be seen that allegory was brought to great perfection  before the appearance of Spencer, and if Mr. Sackville did not  surpass him, it was because he had the disadvantage of writing first.  Agreeable to what Tasso exclaimed on seeing Guarini's Pastor Fido; 'If  he had not seen my Aminta, he had not excelled it.'    Our author's great abilities being distinguished at court, he was  called to public affairs: In the 4th and 5th years of Queen Mary we  find him in parliament; in the 5th year of Elizabeth, when his  father was chosen for Sussex, he was returned one of the Knights of  Buckinghamshire to the parliament then held.

What was passing in his savage brain? Did he gloat  over the unenviable position of his recent tormentor? Did he long to  see Sheeta's great fangs sink into the soft throat of the ape-man? Or  did he realize the courageous unselfishness that had prompted Tarzan to  rush to the rescue and imperil his life for Teeka's balu--for Taug's  little balu? Is gratitude a possession of man only, or do the lower  orders know it also?    With the spilling of Tarzan's blood, Taug answered these questions.  With all the weight of his great body he leaped, hideously growling,  upon Sheeta.  His long fighting fangs buried themselves in the white  throat.  His powerful arms beat and clawed at the soft fur until it  flew upward in the jungle breeze.    And with Taug's example before them the other bulls charged, burying  Sheeta beneath rending fangs and filling all the forest with the wild  din of their battle cries.    Ah! but it was a wondrous and inspiring sight--this battle of the  primordial apes and the great, white ape-man with their ancestral foe,  Sheeta, the panther.    In frenzied excitement, Teeka fairly danced upon the limb which swayed  beneath her great weight as she urged on the males of her people, and  Thaka, and Mumga, and Kamma, with the other shes of the tribe of  Kerchak, added their shrill cries or fierce barkings to the pandemonium  which now reigned within the jungle.    Bitten and biting, tearing and torn, Sheeta battled for his life; but  the odds were against him.  Even Numa, the lion, would have hesitated  to have attacked an equal number of the great bulls of the tribe of  Kerchak, and now, a half mile away, hearing the sounds of the terrific  battle, the king of beasts rose uneasily from his midday slumber and  slunk off farther into the jungle.    Presently Sheeta's torn and bloody body ceased its titanic struggles.  It stiffened spasmodically, twitched and was still, yet the bulls  continued to lacerate it until the beautiful coat was torn to shreds.  At last they desisted from sheer physical weariness, and then from the  tangle of bloody bodies rose a crimson giant, straight as an arrow.    He placed a foot upon the dead body of the panther, and lifting his  blood-stained face to the blue of the equatorial heavens, gave voice to  the horrid victory cry of the bull ape.    One by one his hairy fellows of the tribe of Kerchak followed his  example.  The shes came down from their perches of safety and struck  and reviled the dead body of Sheeta.  The young apes refought the  battle in mimicry of their mighty elders.    Teeka was quite close to Tarzan.  He turned and saw her with the balu  hugged close to her hairy breast, and put out his hands to take the  little one, expecting that Teeka would bare her fangs and spring upon  him; but instead she placed the balu in his arms, and coming nearer,  licked his frightful wounds.    And presently Taug, who had escaped with only a few scratches, came and  squatted beside Tarzan and watched him as he played with the little  balu, and at last he too leaned over and helped Teeka with the  cleansing and the healing of the ape-man's hurts.                                     4                       The God of Tarzan    AMONG THE BOOKS of his dead father in the little cabin by the  land-locked harbor, Tarzan of the Apes found many things to puzzle his  young head.  By much labor and through the medium of infinite patience  as well, he had, without assistance, discovered the purpose of the  little bugs which ran riot upon the printed pages.  He had learned that  in the many combinations in which he found them they spoke in a silent  language, spoke in a strange tongue, spoke of wonderful things which a  little ape-boy could not by any chance fully understand, arousing his  curiosity, stimulating his imagination and filling his soul with a  mighty longing for further knowledge.    A dictionary had proven itself a wonderful storehouse of information,  when, after several years of tireless endeavor, he had solved the  mystery of its purpose and the manner of its use.  He had learned to  make a species of game out of it, following up the spoor of a new  thought through the mazes of the many definitions which each new word  required him to consult.  It was like following a quarry through the  jungle--it was hunting, and Tarzan of the Apes was an indefatigable  huntsman.    There were, of course, certain words which aroused his curiosity to a  greater extent than others, words which, for one reason or another,  excited his imagination.  There was one, for example, the meaning of  which was rather difficult to grasp.  It was the word GOD.  Tarzan  first had been attracted to it by the fact that it was very short and  that it commenced with a larger g-bug than those about it--a male g-bug  it was to Tarzan, the lower-case letters being females.  Another fact  which attracted him to this word was the number of he-bugs which  figured in its definition--Supreme Deity, Creator or Upholder of the  Universe.  This must be a very important word indeed, he would have to  look into it, and he did, though it still baffled him after many months  of thought and study.    However, Tarzan counted no time wasted which he devoted to these  strange hunting expeditions into the game preserves of knowledge, for  each word and each definition led on and on into strange places, into  new worlds where, with increasing frequency, he met old, familiar  faces.  And always he added to his store of knowledge.    But of the meaning of GOD he was yet in doubt.  Once he thought he had  grasped it--that God was a mighty chieftain, king of all the Mangani.  He was not quite sure, however, since that would mean that God was  mightier than Tarzan--a point which Tarzan of the Apes, who  acknowledged no equal in the jungle, was loath to concede.    But in all the books he had there was no picture of God, though he  found much to confirm his belief that God was a great, an all-powerful  individual.  He saw pictures of places where God was worshiped; but  never any sign of God.  Finally he began to wonder if God were not of a  different form than he, and at last he determined to set out in search  of Him.    He commenced by questioning Mumga, who was very old and had seen many  strange things in her long life; but Mumga, being an ape, had a faculty  for recalling the trivial.  That time when Gunto mistook a sting-bug  for an edible beetle had made more impression upon Mumga than all the  innumerable manifestations of the greatness of God which she had  witnessed, and which, of course, she had not understood.    Numgo, overhearing Tarzan's questions, managed to wrest his attention  long enough from the diversion of flea hunting to advance the theory  that the power which made the lightning and the rain and the thunder  came from Goro, the moon.  He knew this, he said, because the Dum-Dum  always was danced in the light of Goro.  This reasoning, though  entirely satisfactory to Numgo and Mumga, failed fully to convince  Tarzan.  However, it gave him a basis for further investigation along a  new line.  He would investigate the moon.    That night he clambered to the loftiest pinnacle of the tallest jungle  giant.  The moon was full, a great, glorious, equatorial moon.  The  ape-man, upright upon a slender, swaying limb, raised his bronzed face  to the silver orb.  Now that he had clambered to the highest point  within his reach, he discovered, to his surprise, that Goro was as far  away as when he viewed him from the ground.  He thought that Goro was  attempting to elude him.    \"Come, Goro!\" he cried, \"Tarzan of the Apes will not harm you!\" But  still the moon held aloof.    \"Tell me,\" he continued, \"if you be the great king who sends Ara, the  lightning; who makes the great noise and the mighty winds, and sends  the waters down upon the jungle people when the days are dark and it is  cold.  Tell me, Goro, are you God?\"    Of course he did not pronounce God as you or I would pronounce His  name, for Tarzan knew naught of the spoken language of his English  forbears; but he had a name of his own invention for each of the little  bugs which constituted the alphabet.  Unlike the apes he was not  satisfied merely to have a mental picture of the things he knew, he  must have a word descriptive of each.  In reading he grasped a word in  its entirety; but when he spoke the words he had learned from the books  of his father, he pronounced each according to the names he had given  the various little bugs which occurred in it, usually giving the gender  prefix for each.    Thus it was an imposing word which Tarzan made of GOD.  The masculine  prefix of the apes is BU, the feminine MU; g Tarzan had named LA, o he  pronounced TU, and d was MO. So the word God evolved itself into  BULAMUTUMUMO, or, in English, he-g-she-o-she-d.    Similarly he had arrived at a strange and wonderful spelling of his own  name.  Tarzan is derived from the two ape words TAR and ZAN, meaning  white skin.  It was given him by his foster mother, Kala, the great  she-ape. When Tarzan first put it into the written language of his own  people he had not yet chanced upon either WHITE or SKIN in the  dictionary; but in a primer he had seen the picture of a little white  boy and so he wrote his name BUMUDE-MUTOMURO, or he-boy.    To follow Tarzan's strange system of spelling would be laborious as  well as futile, and so we shall in the future, as we have in the past,  adhere to the more familiar forms of our grammar school copybooks.  It  would tire you to remember that DO meant b, TU o, and RO y, and that to  say he-boy you must prefix the ape masculine gender sound BU before the  entire word and the feminine gender sound MU before each of the  lower-case letters which go to make up boy--it would tire you and it  would"]]]
