Whose every dream is heaven, in whose fair joy  Experience yet has thrown no black alloy.\"    --THOUGHTS OF A RECLUSE          PREFACE      Some years have now elapsed since my little heroine \"ELSIE DINSMORE\"  made her debut into the great world. She was sent out with many an  anxious thought regarding the reception that might await her there.  But she was kindly welcomed, and such has been the favor shown her  ever since that Publishers and Author have felt encouraged to prepare  a new volume in which will be found the story of those years that have  carried Elsie on from childhood to womanhood--the years in which  her character was developing, and mind and body were growing and  strengthening for the real work and battle of life.    May my readers who have admired and loved her as a child find her  still more charming in her fresh young girlhood; may she prove to all  a pleasant companion and friend; and to those of them now treading the  same portion of life's pathway a useful example also, particularly in  her filial love and obedience.    M.F.          CHAPTER I.    It is a busy, talking world.    --ROWE.      \"I think I shall enjoy the fortnight we are to spend here, papa; it  seems such a very pleasant place,\" Elsie remarked, in a tone of great  satisfaction.    \"I am glad you are pleased with it, daughter,\" returned Mr. Dinsmore,  opening the morning paper, which John had just brought up.    They--Mr. Dinsmore and Elsie, Rose and Edward Allison--were occupying  very comfortable quarters in a large hotel at one of our fashionable  watering-places. A bedroom for each, and a private parlor for the  joint use of the party, had been secured in advance, and late the  night before they had arrived and taken possession.    It was now early in the morning, Elsie and her papa were in his room,  which was in the second story and opened upon a veranda, shaded by  tall trees, and overlooking a large grassy yard at the side of the  building. Beyond were green fields, woods, and hills.    \"Papa,\" said Elsie, gazing longingly upon them, as she stood by the  open window, \"can't we take a walk?\"    \"When Miss Rose is ready to go with us.\"    \"May I run to her door and ask if she is?--and if she isn't, may I  wait for her out here on the veranda?\"    \"Yes.\"    She skipped away, but was back again almost immediately. \"Papa, what  do you think? It's just too bad!\"    \"What is too bad, daughter? I think I never before saw so cross a look  on my little girl's face,\" he said, peering at her over the top of his  newspaper. \"Come here, and tell me what it is all about.\"    She obeyed, hanging her head and blushing. \"I think I have some reason  to be cross, papa,\" she said; \"I thought we were going to have such a  delightful time here, and now it is all spoiled. You could never guess  who has the rooms just opposite ours; on the other side of the hall.\"    \"Miss Stevens?\"    \"Why, papa; did you know she was here?\"    \"I knew she was in the house, because I saw her name in the hotel book  last night when I went to register ours.\"    \"And it just spoils all our pleasure.\"    \"I hope not, daughter. I think she will hardly annoy you when you are  close at my side; and that is pretty much all the time, isn't it?\"    \"Yes, papa, and I'll stick closer than ever to you if that will make  her let me alone,\" she cried, with a merry laugh, putting her arm  round his neck and kissing him two or three times.    \"Ah, now I have my own little girl again,\" he said, drawing her to his  knee and returning her caresses with interest: \"But there, I hear Miss  Rose's step in the hall. Run to mammy and have your hat put on.\"    Miss Stevens' presence proved scarcely less annoying to Elsie than the  child had anticipated. She tried to keep out of the lady's way, but it  was quite impossible. She could scarcely step out on the veranda, go  into the parlor, or take a turn in the garden by herself, but in  a moment Miss Stevens was at her side fawning upon and flattering  her--telling her how sweet and pretty and amiable she was, how dearly  she loved her, and how much she thought of her papa too: he was so  handsome and so good; everybody admired him and thought him such a  fine-looking gentleman, so polished in his manners, so agreeable and  entertaining in conversation.    Then she would press all sorts of dainties upon the little girl  in such a way that it was next to impossible to decline them, and  occasionally even went so far as to suggest improvements, or rather  alterations, in her dress, which she said was entirely too plain.    \"You ought to have more flounces on your skirts, my dear,\" she  remarked one day. \"Skirt flounced to the waist are so very pretty and  dressy, and you would look sweetly in them, but I notice you don't  wear them at all. Do ask your papa to let you get a new dress and have  it made so; I am sure he would consent, for any one can see that he is  very fond of you. He doesn't think of it; we can't expect gentlemen  to notice such little matters; you ought to have a mamma to attend  to such things for you. Ah! if you were my child, I would dress you  sweetly, you dear little thing!\"    \"Thank you, ma'am, I daresay you mean to be very kind,\" replied Elsie,  trying not to look annoyed, \"but I don't want a mamma, since my own  dear mother has gone to heaven; papa is enough for me, and I like the  way he dresses me. He always buys my dresses himself and says how they  are to be made. The dressmaker wanted to put more flounces on, but  papa didn't want them and neither did I. He says he doesn't like to  see little girls loaded with finery, and that my clothes shall be of  the best material and nicely made, but neat and simple.\"    \"Oh, yes; I know your dress is not cheap; I didn't mean that at all:  it is quite expensive enough, and some of your white dresses are  beautifully worked; but I would like a little more ornament. You wear  so little jewelry, and your father could afford to cover you with it  if he chose. A pair of gold bracelets, like mine for instance, would  be very pretty, and look charming on your lovely white arms: those  pearl ones you wear sometimes are very handsome--any one could tell  that they are the real thing--but you ought to have gold ones too,  with clasps set with diamonds. Couldn't you persuade your papa to buy  some for you?\"    \"Indeed, Miss Stevens, I don't want them! I don't want anything but  what papa chooses to buy for me of his own accord. Ah! there is Miss  Rose looking for me, I must go,\" and the little girl, glad of an  excuse to get away, ran joyfully to her friend who had come to the  veranda, where she and Miss Stevens had been standing, to tell her  that they were going out to walk, and her papa wished to take her  along.    Elsie went in to get her hat, and Miss Stevens came towards Rose,  saying, \"I think I heard you say you were going to walk; and I  believe, if you don't forbid me, I shall do myself the pleasure of  accompanying you. I have just been waiting for pleasant company. I  will be ready in one moment.\" And before Rose could recover from her  astonishment sufficiently to reply she had disappeared through the  hall door.    Elsie was out again in a moment, just as the gentlemen had joined  Rose, who excited their surprise and disgust by a repetition of Miss  Stevens' speech to her.    Mr. Dinsmore looked excessively annoyed, and Edward \"pshawed, and  wished her at the bottom of the sea.\"    \"No, brother,\" said Rose, smiling, \"you don't wish any such thing; on  the contrary, you would be the very first to fly to the rescue if you  saw her in danger of drowning.\"    But before there was time for anything more to be said Miss Stevens  had returned, and walking straight up to Mr. Dinsmore, she put her arm  through his, saying with a little laugh, and what was meant for a  very arch expression, \"You see I don't stand upon ceremony with old  friends, Mr. Dinsmore. It isn't my way.\"    \"No, Miss Stevens, I think it never was,\" he replied, offering the  other arm to Rose.    She was going to decline it on the plea that the path was too narrow  for three, but something in his look made her change her mind and  accept; and they moved on, while Elsie, almost ready to cry with  vexation, fell behind with Edward Allison for an escort.    Edward tried to entertain his young companion, but was too much  provoked at the turn things had taken to make himself very agreeable  to any one; and altogether it was quite an uncomfortable walk: no  one seeming to enjoy it but Miss Stevens, who laughed and talked  incessantly; addressing nearly all her conversation to Mr. Dinsmore,  he answering her with studied politeness, but nothing more.    Miss Stevens had, from the first, conceived a great antipathy to  Rose, whom she considered a dangerous rival, and generally avoided,  excepting when Mr. Dinsmore was with her; but she always interrupted  a tete-a-tete between them when it was in her power to do so without  being guilty of very great rudeness. This, and the covert sneers with  which she often addressed Miss Allison had not escaped Mr. Dinsmore's  notice, and it frequently cost him quite an effort to treat Miss  Stevens with the respectful politeness which he considered due to her  sex and to the daughter of his father's old friend.    \"Was it not too provoking, papa?\" exclaimed Elsie, as she followed him  into his room on their return from their walk.    \"What, my dear?\"    \"Why, papa, I thought we were going to have such a nice time, and she  just spoiled it all.\"    \"She? who, daughter?\"    \"Why, papa, surely you know I mean Miss Stevens!\"    \"Then why did you not mention her name, instead of speaking of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9966"],[0,"The Spartan Twins (#1)"],[1,"SPARTAN TWINS                              By Lucy Fitch Perkins                                      1918          CONTENTS           LIST OF CHARACTERS    I.

[Illustration: Plan of home of the Spartan Twins]          I    COMPANY AT THE FARM      One lovely spring morning long years ago in Hellas, Lydia, wife of  Melas the Spartan, sat upon a stool in the court of her house, with her  wool-basket beside her, spinning. She was a tall, strong-looking young  woman with golden hair and blue eyes, and as she twirled her distaff and  twisted the white wool between her fingers she sang a little song to  herself that sounded like the humming of bees in a garden.    The little court of the house where she sat was open to the sky, and the  afternoon sun came pouring over the wall which surrounded it, and made a  brilliant patch of light upon the earthen floor. The little stones which  were embedded in the earth to form a sort of pavement glistened in the  sun and seemed to play at hide and seek with the moving shadow of Lydia's  distaff as she spun. On the thatch which covered the arcade around  three sides of the court pigeons crooned and preened their feathers, and  from a room in the second story of the house, which opened upon a little  gallery enclosing the fourth side of the court, came the _clack clack_ of  a loom.    As she spun, the shadow of Lydia's distaff grew longer and longer across  the floor until at last the sunlight disappeared behind the wall, leaving  the whole court in gray shadow.    Under the gallery a large room opened into the court. The embers of a  fire glowed dully upon a stone hearth in the center of this room, and  beyond, through an open door, fowls could be seen wandering about the  farm-yard. Suddenly the quiet of the late afternoon was broken by a  medley of sounds. There were the bleating of sheep, and the tinkle of  their bells, the lowing of cattle and the barking of a dog, the soft  patter of bare feet and the voices of children.    Then there was a sudden squawking among the hens in the farm-yard,  and through the back door, past the glowing hearth and into the court,  rushed two children, followed by a huge shepherd dog. The children were  blue-eyed and golden-haired, like their Mother, and looked so big and  strong that they might easily have passed for twelve years of age, though  they really were but ten. They were so exactly alike that their Mother  herself could hardly tell which was Dion and which was Daphne, and, as  for their Father, he didn't even try. He simply said whichever name came  first to his lips, feeling quite sure that the children would always be  able to tell themselves apart, at any rate. Daphne, to be sure, wore  her chiton a little longer than Dion wore his, but when they were running  or playing games she often pulled it up shorter through her girdle, so  even that was not a sure sign.    Lydia looked from one of them to the other as the children came bounding  into the court, with Argos, the dog, barking and leaping about them, and  smiled with pride.    \"Where have you been, you wild creatures?\" she said to the twins, \"I  haven't seen you since noon,\" and \"Down, Argos, down,\" she cried to the  dog, who had put his great paws in her lap and was trying to kiss her on  the nose.    \"We've been down in the field by the spring with Father,\" Dion shouted,  \"and Father is bringing a man home to supper!\"    \"Company!\" gasped Lydia, throwing up her hands. \"Whoever can it be at  this time of the day and in such an out of the way place as this? And  nothing but black broth ready for supper! I might have had a roast  fowl at least if only I had known. Where are they now?\"    \"They are coming down the road,\" said Dion. \"They stopped to see the  sheep and cattle driven into the farm-yard. They'll be here soon.\"    Lydia thrust her distaff into the wool-basket by her side and rose  hastily from her stool. \"There's no time to lose,\" she said. \"The  Stranger will not wish to linger here if he expects to reach Ambelaca  to-night. It is a good two miles to the village, and he'll not find a  boat crossing to the mainland after dark. I am sure of that,  unlessperhaps he has one waiting for him there.\"    As she spoke, Lydia drew her skirt shorter through her girdle and started  for the hearth-fire in the room beyond. \"Shoo,\" she cried to the hens,  which had followed the children into the house and were searching  hopefully for something to eat among the ashes, \"you'll burn your toes as  like as not! Begone, unless you want to be put at once into the pot! Go  for them, Argos! Dion, you feed them. They'll be under foot until they've  had their supper, and it's time they were on the roost this minute!  Daphne, your face is dirty; go wash it, while I get the fire started and  see if I can't find something to eat more fitting to set before a guest.\"    While the children ran to carry out their Mother's orders, Lydia herself  seized the bellows and blew upon the embers of the fire. \"By all the  Gods!\" she cried, \"there's not a stick of wood in the house.\" She dropped  the bellows and ran into the court. From the room above still came the  _clack clack_ of the loom. Lydia looked up at the gallery of the second  story and clapped her hands.    \"Chloe, Chloe,\" she called. The clacking suddenly stopped, and a young  girl with black hair and eyes and red cheeks came out of the upper room  and leaned over the balcony rail.    \"Did you want me?\" she asked.    \"Indeed I want you!\" answered her mistress. \"Company is coming to supper  and there is nothing in the house fit to set before him! Hurry and bring  some wood. There's not even a fire!\"    There was a sound of hasty footsteps on the stair, and Chloe disappeared  into the farm-yard. In a moment she was back again with a basket of wood,  which she placed beside the hearth. Lydia knelt on the floor and laid the  wood upon the coals. Then she blew upon them energetically with the  bellows. Chloe knelt beside her and blew too, but not with bellows. The  ashes flew in every direction.    \"Mercy!\" cried Lydia, \"you've a breath like the blasts of winter! You  will blow the sparks clear across the court and set fire to the thatch if  you keep on! Come! Get out the oven and start a charcoal fire! We can  bake barley-cakes, at least, and there are sausages in the store-room.  See if there is fresh water in the water-jar.\"    \"There isn't a drop, I know,\" said Daphne. \"I took the last to wash my  face.\"    \"Was there ever anything like it?\" cried Lydia. \"Fresh water first of  all! Run at once to the spring, Chloe. I '11 get the oven myself. Daphne,  you take the small water-jar and go with Chloe.\"    As Chloe and Daphne, with their water-jars on their shoulders, started  out of the back door for the spring, the door at the front of the court  opened, and Melas entered with a tall, bearded man wearing a long cloak.    The moment she heard the door move on its hinges, Lydia stood up straight  and tall beside her hearth-fire, and, at a sign from her husband, came  forward to greet the Stranger.    \"You are welcome,\" she said, \"to such entertainment as our plain house  affords. I could wish it were better for your sake.\"    \"I shall be honored by your hospitality,\" said the Stranger politely,  \"and what is good enough for a farmer is surely good enough for a  philosopher, if I may call myself one.\"    \"Though you are a philosopher, you are also, no doubt, an Athenian,\"  replied Lydia, \"and it is known to all the world that the feast of the  Spartan is but common fare for those who live delicately as the Athenians  do.\"    \"I bring an appetite that would make a feast of bread alone,\" answered  the Stranger.    Melas, a tall brown-faced man with a brown beard, now spoke for the first  time.    \"There is no haste, wife,\" he said. \"The Stranger will spend the night  under our roof. It is not yet late. While you get supper, we will rest  beneath the olive trees and watch the sun go down behind the hills.\"    \"Until I can better serve you, then,\" Lydia replied; and the two men went  out again through the open door, and sat down upon a wooden bench which  commanded a view of the little valley and the hills beyond.    Meanwhile, within doors, Lydia dropped the stately dignity of her company  manners and became once more the busy housewife. When Chloe and Daphne  returned from the spring, she had barley-cakes baking in the oven, and  sausages were roasting before the hearth-fire. A kettle of broth steamed  beside it.    \"How good it smells!\" cried Dion, when he came in with Argos from the  farm-yard. \"I could eat a whole pig myself. Do cook a lot of sausages,  Mother. I am as hungry as a wolf.\"    \"And you a Spartan boy!\" said his Mother reprovingly. \"You should think  less of what you put in your stomach! Plain fare makes the strongest men.  It is only polite to give a guest the best you have, but that's no excuse  for"]]]
