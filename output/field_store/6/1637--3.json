[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12590"],[0,"The Shadow of the Rope (#10)"],[1,"of Rachel at sight of him; a delicious sense of safety filled her  heart instead. She was as one drowning, and here was a strong swimmer  come to her rescue in the nick of time. What did it matter who or what  he was? She felt that he was strong to save. Yet, as the nearly drowned  do struggle with their saviours, so Rachel must fence instinctively with  hers.    \"I never did pin my faith to him,\" said she.    \"Yet see the risk that you are running! If he turns round--if any one of  them turns round and recognizes you--listen to that!\"    It was only the second window, but a third and a fourth followed like  shots from the same revolver. Rachel winced.    \"For God's sake, come away!\" he whispered, sternly.    And Rachel did come a few yards before a flicker of her spirit called a  halt.    \"Why should I run away?\" she demanded, in sudden tears of mortification  and of weakness combined. \"I am innocent--so why should I?\"    \"Because they don't like innocent people; and there appear to be no  police in these parts; and if you fall into their hands--well, it would  be better for you if you had been found guilty and were safe and sound  in Newgate now!\"    That was exactly what Rachel had felt herself; she took a few steps  more, but still with reluctance and irresolution; and once round the  nearest corner, and out of that hateful street for ever, she turned to  her companion in unconcealed despair.    \"But what am I to do?\" she cried. \"But where am I to turn?\"    \"Mrs. Minchin,\" said Steel, \"can you not really trust me yet?\"    He stood before her under a street lamp, handsome still, upright for all  his years, strong as fate itself, and surely kinder than any fate which  Rachel Minchin had yet met with in the course of her short but  checkered life. And yet--and yet--she trusted and distrusted him too!    \"I can and I cannot,\" she sighed; and even with the words one reason  occurred to her. \"You have followed me, you see, after all!\"    \"I admit it,\" he replied, \"and without a particle of shame. My dear  lady, I was not going to lose sight of you to-night!\"    \"And why not?\"    \"Because I foresaw what might happen, and may happen still! Nay, madam,  it will, if you continue to let your pride sit upon your common sense.  Do you hear them now? That means the police, and when they're dispersed  they'll come this way to King's Road. Any moment they may be upon us.  And there's a hansom dropped from heaven!\"    He raised his umbrella, the bell tinkled, the two red eyes dilated and  widened in the night, then with a clatter the horse was pulled up beside  the curb, and Steel spread his hand before the muddy wheel.    \"Be sensible,\" he whispered, \"and jump in! In a hansom you can see where  you are going; in a hansom you can speak to the driver or attract the  attention of any decent person on the sidewalk. Ah! you will trust me  so far at last--I thank you from my heart!\"    \"Where to, sir?\" asked the cabman through the roof.    And Rachel listened with languid curiosity; but that was all. She had  put herself in this man's hands; resistance was at an end, and a  reckless indifference to her fate the new attitude of a soul as utterly  overtaxed and exhausted as its tired tenement of clay.    \"Brook Street,\" said Steel, after a moment's pause--\"and double-quick  for a double fare. We shall be there in a quarter of an hour,\" he added  reassuringly as the trap-door slammed, \"and you will find everything  ready for you, beginning with something to eat. I, at all events,  anticipated the verdict; if you don't believe me, you will when we get  there, for they have been ready for you all day. Do you know Claridge's  Hotel, by the way?\"    \"Only by name,\" said Rachel, wearily.    \"I'm glad to hear it,\" pursued Mr. Steel, \"for I think you will be  pleased. It is not like the ordinary run of hotels. Your rooms are your  castle--regular self-contained flat--and you needn't see another soul if  you don't like. I am staying in the hotel myself, for example, but you  shall not set eyes on me for a week unless you wish to.\"    \"But I don't understand,\" began Rachel, roused a little from her apathy.  She was not suffered to proceed.    \"Nor are you to attempt to do so,\" said her companion, \"until to-morrow  morning. If you feel equal to it then, I shall crave an audience, and  you shall hear what I have got to say. But first, let me beg of you, an  adequate supper and a good night's rest!\"    \"One thing is certain,\" said Rachel, half to herself: \"they can't know  who I am, or they never would have taken me in. And no luggage!\"    \"That they are prepared for,\" returned Steel; \"and in your rooms you  will find a maid who is also prepared and equipped for your emergency.  As to their not knowing who you are at the hotel, there you are right;  they do not know; it would have been inexpedient to tell them.\"    \"Then at least,\" said Rachel, \"I ought to know who I am supposed to be.\"    And she smiled, for interest and curiosity were awakened within her,  with the momentary effect of stimulants; but Mr. Steel sat silent at her  side. The cab was tinkling up Park Lane. The great park on the left, the  great houses on the right, the darkness on the one hand, the lights on  the other, had all the fascination of sharp contrasts--that very  fascination which was Mr. Steel's. Rachel already discovered it in his  face, and divined it in his character, without admitting to herself that  there was any fascination at all. Yet otherwise she would have dropped  rather than have done what she was doing now. The man had cast a spell  upon her; and for the present she did feel safe in his hands. But with  that unmistakable sense of immediate security there mingled a subtler  premonition of ultimate danger, to which Rachel had felt alive from the  first. And this was the keenest stimulus of all.    What was his intention, and what his object? To draw back was to find  out neither; and to say the truth, even if she had not been friendless  and forlorn, Rachel would have been very sorry to draw back now.    The raw air in her face had greatly revived her; the sights and lights  of the town were still new and dear to her; she had come back to the  world with a vengeance, to a world of incident and interest, with an  adventure ready waiting to take her out of her past self!    But it was only her companion's silence which enabled Rachel to realize  her strange fortune at this stage, and she had to put her question  point-blank before she obtained any answer at all.    \"If you insist upon hearing all the little details to-night,\" said  Steele, with a good-humored shrug, \"well, I suppose you must hear them;  but I hope you will not insist. I have had to make provisions which you  may very possibly resent, but I thought it would be time enough for us  to quarrel about them in the morning. To-night you need rest and  sustenance, but no excitement; of that God knows you have had enough! No  one will come near you but the maid of whom I spoke; no questions will  be put to you; everything is arranged. But to-morrow, if you feel equal  to it, you shall hear all about me, and form your own cool judgment of  my behavior towards you. Meanwhile won't you trust me--implicitly--until  then?\"    \"I do,\" said Rachel, \"and I will--until to-morrow.\"    \"Then there are one or two things that I can promise you,\" said Steel,  with the heartiness of a man who has gained his point. \"You will not be  compromised in any sort or kind of way; your self-respect shall not  suffer; nothing shall vex or trouble you, if I can help it, while you  remain at this hotel. And this I guarantee--whether you like it or  not--unless you tell them, not a single soul in the place shall have the  faintest inkling as to who you are. Now, only keep your why and  wherefore till to-morrow,\" he concluded cheerily, \"and I can promise you  almost every satisfaction. But here we are at the hotel.\"    He thrust his umbrella outside, pointing to a portico and courtyard on  the right; and in another moment Rachel was receiving the bows of  powdered footmen in crimson plush, while Steel, hat in hand, his white  hair gleaming in the electric light, led the way to the lift.    Rachel's recollection of that night was ever afterwards disjointed and  involved as that of any dream; but there were certain features that she  never forgot. There was the beautiful suite of rooms, filled with  flowers that must have cost a small fortune at that time of year, and in  one of them a table tastefully laid. Rachel remembered the dazzle of  silver and the glare of napery, the hot plates, the sparkling wine, the  hot-house fruit, and the deep embarrassment of sitting down to all this  in solitary state. Mr. Steel had but peeped in to see that all was in  accordance with his orders; thereafter not even a waiter was allowed to  enter, but only Rachel's attendant, to whose charge she had been  committed; a gentle and assiduous creature, quiet of foot and quick of  hand, who spoke seldom but in a soothing voice, and with the delicate  and pretty accent of the French-Swiss.    Rachel used to wonder whether she had shocked this mannerly young woman  by eating very ravenously; she remembered a nervous desire to be done  with that solitary repast, and to get to bed. Yet when she was there, in  the sweetest and whitest of fine linen, with a hot bottle at her feet,  and a fire burning so brightly in the room that the brass bedstead  seemed here and there red-hot, then the sound sleep that she sorely  needed seemed further off than ever, for always she dreamt she was in  prison and condemned to die, till at length she feared to close her  eyes. But nothing had been forgotten; and Rachel's last memory of that  eventful day, and not less eventful night, was of a mild, foreign face  bending over her with a medicine-glass and a gentle word.    And the same good face and the same soft voice were waiting for her when  she awoke after many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1261"],[0,"Betty Zane (#10)"],[1,"could have sent him for help.  She shouted several times, but the distance was too great for her  voice to carry to the fort. The mocking echo of her call came back  from the bluff that rose to her left. Betty now began to be alarmed  in earnest, and the tears started to roll down her cheeks. The  throbbing pain in her ankle, the dread of having to remain out in  that lonesome forest after dark, and the fear that she might not be  found for hours, caused Betty's usually brave spirit to falter; she  was weeping unreservedly.    In reality she had been there only a few minutes--although they  seemed hours to her--when she heard the light tread of moccasined  feet on the moss behind her. Starting up with a cry of joy she  turned and looked up into the astonished face of Alfred Clarke.    Returning from a hunt back in the woods he had walked up to her  before being aware of her presence. In a single glance he saw the  wildflowers scattered beside her, the little moccasin turned inside  out, the woebegone, tearstained face, and he knew Betty had come to  grief.    Confused and vexed, Betty sank back at the foot of the tree. It is  probable she would have encountered Girty or a member of his band of  redmen, rather than have this young man find her in this  predicament. It provoked her to think that of all the people at the  fort it should be the only one she could not welcome who should find  her in such a sad plight.    \"Why, Miss Zane!\" he exclaimed, after a moment of hesitation. \"What  in the world has happened? Have you been hurt? May I help you?\"    \"It is nothing,\" said Betty, bravely, as she gathered up her flowers  and the moccasin and rose slowly to her feet. \"Thank you, but you  need not wait.\"    The cold words nettled Alfred and he was in the act of turning away  from her when he caught, for the fleetest part of a second, the full  gaze of her eyes. He stopped short. A closer scrutiny of her face  convinced him that she was suffering and endeavoring with all her  strength to conceal it.    \"But I will wait. I think you have hurt yourself. Lean upon my arm,\"  he said, quietly.    \"Please let me help you,\" he continued, going nearer to her.    But Betty refused his assistance. She would not even allow him to  take the goldenrod from her arms. After a few hesitating steps she  paused and lifted her foot from the ground.    \"Here, you must not try to walk a step farther,\" he said,  resolutely, noting how white she had suddenly become. \"You have  sprained your ankle and are needlessly torturing yourself. Please  let me carry you?\"    \"Oh, no, no, no!\" cried Betty, in evident distress. \"I will manage.  It is not so--very--far.\"    She resumed the slow and painful walking, but she had taken only a  few steps when she stopped again and this time a low moan issued  from her lips. She swayed slightly backward and if Alfred had not  dropped his rifle and caught her she would have fallen.    \"Will you--please--for some one?\" she whispered faintly, at the same  time pushing him away.    \"How absurd!\" burst out Alfred, indignantly. \"Am I then, so  distasteful to you that you would rather wait here and suffer a half  hour longer while I go for assistance? It is only common courtesy on  my part. I do not want to carry you. I think you would be quite  heavy.\"    He said this in a hard, bitter tone, deeply hurt that she would not  accept even a little kindness from him. He looked away from her and  waited. Presently a soft, half-smothered sob came from Betty and it  expressed such utter wretchedness that his heart melted. After all  she was only a child. He turned to see the tears running down her  cheeks, and with a suppressed imprecation upon the wilfulness of  young women in general, and this one in particular, he stepped  forward and before she could offer any resistance, he had taken her  up in his arms, goldenrod and all, and had started off at a rapid  walk toward the fort.    Betty cried out in angry surprise, struggled violently for a moment,  and then, as suddenly, lay quietly in his arms. His anger changed to  self-reproach as he realized what a light burden she made. He looked  down at the dark head lying on his shoulder. Her face was hidden by  the dusky rippling hair, which tumbled over his breast, brushed  against his cheek, and blew across his lips. The touch of those  fragrant tresses was a soft caress. Almost unconsciously he pressed  her closer to his heart. And as a sweet mad longing grew upon him he  was blind to all save that he held her in his arms, that uncertainty  was gone forever, and that he loved her. With these thoughts running  riot in his brain he carried her down the hill to Colonel Zane's  house.    The negro, Sam, who came out of the kitchen, dropped the bucket he  had in his hand and ran into the house when he saw them. When Alfred  reached the gate Colonel Zane and Isaac were hurrying out to meet  him.    \"For Heaven's sake! What has happened? Is she badly hurt? I have  always looked for this,\" said the Colonel, excitedly.    \"You need not look so alarmed,\" answered Alfred. \"She has only  sprained her ankle, and trying to walk afterward hurt her so badly  that she became faint and I had to carry her.\"    \"Dear me, is that all?\" said Mrs. Zane, who had also come out. \"We  were terribly frightened. Sam came running into the house with some  kind of a wild story. Said he knew you would be the death of Betty.\"    \"How ridiculous! Colonel Zane, that servant of yours never fails to  say something against me,\" said Alfred, as he carried Betty into the  house.    \"He doesn't like you. But you need not mind Sam. He is getting old  and we humor him, perhaps too much. We are certainly indebted to  you,\" returned the Colonel.    Betty was laid on the couch and consigned to the skillful hands of  Mrs. Zane, who pronounced the injury a bad sprain.    \"Well, Betty, this will keep you quiet for a few days,\" said she,  with a touch of humor, as she gently felt the swollen ankle.    \"Alfred, you have been our good angel so often that I don't see how  we shall ever reward you,\" said Isaac to Alfred.    \"Oh, that time will come. Don't worry about that,\" said Alfred,  jestingly, and then, turning to the others he continued, earnestly.  \"I will apologize for the manner in which I disregarded Miss Zane's  wish not to help her. I am sure I could do no less. I believe my  rudeness has spared her considerable suffering.\"    \"What did he mean, Betts?\" asked Isaac, going back to his sister  after he had closed the door. \"Didn't you want him to help you?\"    Betty did not answer. She sat on the couch while Mrs. Zane held the  little bare foot and slowly poured the hot water over the swollen  and discolored ankle. Betty's lips were pale. She winced every time  Mrs. Zane touched her foot, but as yet she had not uttered even a  sigh.    \"Betty, does it hurt much?\" asked Isaac.    \"Hurt? Do you think I am made of wood? Of course it hurts,\" retorted  Betty. \"That water is so hot. Bessie, will not cold water do as  well?\"    \"I am sorry. I won't tease any more,\" said Isaac, taking his  sister's hand. \"I'll tell you what, Betty, we owe Alfred Clarke a  great deal, you and I. I am going to tell you something so you will  know how much more you owe him. Do you remember last month when that  red heifer of yours got away. Well, Clarke chased her away and  finally caught her in the woods. He asked me to say I had caught  her. Somehow or other he seems to be afraid of you. I wish you and  he would be good friends. He is a mighty fine fellow.\"    In spite of the pain Betty was suffering a bright blush suffused her  face at the words of her brother, who, blind as brothers are in  regard to their own sisters, went on praising his friend.    Betty was confined to the house a week or more and during this  enforced idleness she had ample time for reflection and opportunity  to inquire into the perplexed state of her mind.    The small room, which Betty called her own, faced the river and  fort. Most of the day she lay by the window trying to read her  favorite books, but often she gazed out on the quiet scene, the  rolling river, the everchanging trees and the pastures in which the  red and white cows grazed peacefully; or she would watch with idle,  dreamy eyes the flight of the crows over the hills, and the graceful  motion of the hawk as he sailed around and around in the azure sky,  looking like a white sail far out on a summer sea.    But Betty's mind was at variance with this peaceful scene. The  consciousness of a change, which she could not readily define, in  her feelings toward Alfred Clarke, vexed and irritated her. Why did  she think of him so often? True, he had saved her brother's life.  Still she was compelled to admit to herself that this was not the  reason. Try as she would, she could not banish the thought of him.  Over and over again, a thousand times, came the recollection of that  moment when he had taken her up in his arms as though she were a  child. Some vague feeling stirred in her heart as she remembered the  strong yet gentle clasp of his arms.    Several times from her window she had seen him coming across the  square between the fort and her brother's house, and womanlike,  unseen herself, she had watched him. How erect was his carriage. How  pleasant his deep voice sounded as she heard him talking to her  brother. Day by day, as her ankle grew stronger and she knew she  could not remain much longer in her room, she dreaded more and more  the thought of meeting him. She could not understand herself; she  had strange dreams; she cried seemingly without the slightest cause  and she was restless and unhappy. Finally she grew angry and scolded  herself. She said she was silly and sentimental. This had the effect  of making her bolder, but it did not quiet her unrest. Betty did not  know that the little blind God, who steals unawares on his victim,  had marked her for his own, and that all this sweet"]]]
