Being greatly alarmed at these things,  Caesar thought that he ought to use all despatch, lest, if this new band  of Suevi should unite with the old troops of Ariovistus, he [Ariovistus]  might be less easily withstood. Having, therefore, as quickly as he  could, provided a supply of corn, he hastened to Ariovistus by forced  marches.    XXXVIII.--When he had proceeded three days' journey, word was brought to  him that Ariovistus was hastening with all his forces to seize on  Vesontio, which is the largest town of the Sequani, and had advanced  three days' journey from his territories. Caesar thought that he ought  to take the greatest precautions lest this should happen, for there was  in that town a most ample supply of everything which was serviceable for  war; and so fortified was it by the nature of the ground as to afford a  great facility for protracting the war, inasmuch as the river Doubs  almost surrounds the whole town, as though it were traced round it with  a pair of compasses. A mountain of great height shuts in the remaining  space, which is not more than 600 feet, where the river leaves a gap, in  such a manner that the roots of that mountain extend to the river's bank  on either side. A wall thrown around it makes a citadel of this  [mountain], and connects it with the town. Hither Caesar hastens by  forced marches by night and day, and, after having seized the town,  stations a garrison there.    XXXIX.--Whilst he is tarrying a few days at Vesontio, on account of corn  and provisions; from the inquiries of our men and the reports of the  Gauls and traders (who asserted that the Germans were men of huge  stature, of incredible valour and practice in arms, that ofttimes they,  on encountering them, could not bear even their countenance, and the  fierceness of their eyes)--so great a panic on a sudden seized the whole  army, as to discompose the minds and spirits of all in no slight degree.  This first arose from the tribunes of the soldiers, the prefects and the  rest, who, having followed Caesar from the city [Rome] from motives of  friendship, had no great experience in military affairs. And alleging,  some of them one reason, some another, which they said made it necessary  for them to depart, they requested that by his consent they might be  allowed to withdraw; some, influenced by shame, stayed behind in order  that they might avoid the suspicion of cowardice. These could neither  compose their countenance, nor even sometimes check their tears: but  hidden in their tents, either bewailed their fate, or deplored with  their comrades the general danger. Wills were sealed universally  throughout the whole camp. By the expressions and cowardice of these  men, even those who possessed great experience in the camp, both  soldiers and centurions, and those [the decurions] who were in command  of the cavalry, were gradually disconcerted. Such of them as wished to  be considered less alarmed, said that they did not dread the enemy, but  feared the narrowness of the roads and the vastness of the forests which  lay between them and Ariovistus, or else that the supplies could not be  brought up readily enough. Some even declared to Caesar that when he  gave orders for the camp to be moved and the troops to advance, the  soldiers would not be obedient to the command, nor advance in  consequence of their fear.    XL.--When Caesar observed these things, having called a council, and  summoned to it the centurions of all the companies, he severely  reprimanded them, \"particularly for supposing that it belonged to them  to inquire or conjecture, either in what direction they were marching,  or with what object. That Ariovistus, during his [Caesar's] consulship,  had most anxiously sought after the friendship of the Roman people; why  should any one judge that he would so rashly depart from his duty? He  for his part was persuaded that, when his demands were known and the  fairness of the terms considered, he would reject neither his nor the  Roman people's favour. But even if, driven on by rage and madness, he  should make war upon them, what after all were they afraid of?--or why  should they despair either of their own valour or of his zeal? Of that  enemy a trial had been made within our fathers' recollection, when, on  the defeat of the Cimbri and Teutones by Caius Marius, the army was  regarded as having deserved no less praise than their commander himself.  It had been made lately, too, in Italy; during the rebellion of the  slaves, whom, however, the experience and training which they had  received from us, assisted in some respect. From which a judgment might  be formed of the advantages which resolution carries with it,--inasmuch  as those whom for some time they had groundlessly dreaded when unarmed,  they had afterwards vanquished, when well armed and flushed with  success. In short, that these were the same men whom the Helvetii, in  frequent encounters, not only in their own territories, but also in  theirs [the German], have generally vanquished, and yet cannot have been  a match for our army. If the unsuccessful battle and flight of the Gauls  disquieted any, these, if they made inquiries, might discover that, when  the Gauls had been tired out by the long duration of the war,  Ariovistus, after he had many months kept himself in his camp and in the  marshes, and had given no opportunity for an engagement, fell suddenly  upon them, by this time despairing of a battle and scattered in all  directions, and was victorious more through stratagem and cunning than  valour. But though there had been room for such stratagem against savage  and unskilled men, not even [Ariovistus] himself expected that thereby  our armies could be entrapped. That those who ascribed their fear to a  pretence about the [deficiency of] supplies and the narrowness of the  roads, acted presumptuously, as they seemed either to distrust their  general's discharge of his duty, or to dictate to him. That these things  were his concern; that the Sequani, the Leuci, and the Lingones were to  furnish the corn; and that it was already ripe in the fields; that as to  the road they would soon be able to judge for themselves. As to its  being reported that the soldiers would not be obedient to command, or  advance, he was not at all disturbed at that; for he knew that in the  case of all those whose army had not been obedient to command, either  upon some mismanagement of an affair, fortune had deserted them, or,  that upon some crime being discovered, covetousness had been clearly  proved [against them]. His integrity had been seen throughout his whole  life, his good fortune in the war with the Helvetii. That he would  therefore instantly set about what he had intended to put off till a  more distant day, and would break up his camp the next night, in the  fourth watch, that he might ascertain, as soon as possible, whether a  sense of honour and duty, or whether fear had more influence with them.  But that, if no one else should follow, yet he would go with only the  tenth legion, of which he had no misgivings, and it should be his  praetorian cohort.\"--This legion Caesar had both greatly favoured, and  in it, on account of its valour, placed the greatest confidence.    XLI.-Upon the delivery of this speech, the minds of all were changed in  a surprising, manner, and the highest ardour and eagerness for  prosecuting the war were engendered; and the tenth legion was the first  to return thanks to him, through their military tribunes, for his having  expressed this most favourable opinion of them; and assured him that  they were quite ready to prosecute the war. Then, the other legions  endeavoured, through their military tribunes and the centurions of the  principal companies, to excuse themselves to Caesar, [saying] that they  had never either doubted or feared, or supposed that the determination  of the conduct of the war was theirs and not their general's. Having  accepted their excuse, and having had the road carefully reconnoitred by  Divitiacus, because in him of all others he had the greatest faith, [he  found] that by a circuitous route of more than fifty miles he might lead  his army through open parts; he then set out in the fourth watch, as he  had said [he would]. On the seventh day, as he did not discontinue his  march, he was informed by scouts that the forces of Ariovistus were only  four and twenty miles distant from ours.    XLII.--Upon being apprised of Caesar's arrival, Ariovistus sends  ambassadors to him, [saying] that what he had before requested as to a  conference, might now, as far as his permission went, take place, since  he [Caesar] had approached nearer, and he considered that he might now  do it without danger. Caesar did not reject the proposal and began to  think that he was now returning to a rational state of mind, as he  spontaneously proffered that which he had previously refused to him when  requesting it; and was in great hopes that, in consideration of his own  and the Roman people's great favours towards him, the issue would be  that he would desist from his obstinacy upon his demands being made  known. The fifth day after that was appointed as the day of conference.  Meanwhile, as ambassadors were being often sent to and fro between them,  Ariovistus demanded that Caesar should not bring any foot-soldier with  him to the conference, [saying] that \"he was afraid of being ensnared by  him through treachery; that both should come accompanied by cavalry;  that he would not come on any other condition.\" Caesar, as he neither  wished that the conference should, by an excuse thrown in the way, be  set aside, nor durst trust his life to the cavalry of the Gauls, decided  that it would be most expedient to take away from the Gallic cavalry"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10661"],[0,"A Selection from the Discourses of Epictetus with the Encheiridion (#10)"],[1," of empty names.           *       *       *       *       *    HOW WE OUGHT TO USE DIVINATION.--Through an unreasonable regard to  divination many of us omit many duties. For what more can the diviner  see than death or danger or disease, or generally things of that kind?  If then I must expose myself to danger for a friend, and if it is my  duty even to die for him, what need have I then for divination? Have I  not within me a diviner who has told me the nature of good and of evil,  and has explained to me the signs (or marks) of both? What need have I  then to consult the viscera of victims or the flight of birds, and why  do I submit when he says, It is for your interest? For does he know what  is for my interest, does he know what is good; and as he has learned the  signs of the viscera, has he also learned the signs of good and evil?  For if he knows the signs of these, he knows the signs both of the  beautiful and of the ugly, and of the just and of the unjust. Do you  tell me, man, what is the thing which is signified for me: is it life or  death, poverty or wealth? But whether these things are for my interest  or whether they are not, I do not intend to ask you. Why don't you give  your opinion on matters of grammar, and why do you give it here about  things on which we are all in error and disputing with one another?    What then leads us to frequent use of divination? Cowardice, the dread  of what will happen. This is the reason why we flatter the diviners.  Pray, master, shall I succeed to the property of my father? Let us see:  let us sacrifice on the occasion. Yes, master, as fortune chooses. When  he has said, You shall succeed to the inheritance, we thank him as if we  received the inheritance from him. The consequence is that they play  upon us.    Will you not then seek the nature of good in the rational animal? for if  it is not there, you will not choose to say that it exists in any other  thing (plant or animal). What then? are not plants and animals also the  works of God? They are; but they are not superior things, nor yet parts  of the gods. But you are a superior thing; you are a portion separated  from the Deity; you have in yourself a certain portion of him. Why then  are you ignorant of your own noble descent? Why do you not know whence  you came? will you not remember when you are eating who you are who eat  and whom you feed? When you are in social intercourse, when you are  exercising yourself, when you are engaged in discussion, know you not  that you are nourishing a god, that you are exercising a god? Wretch,  you are carrying about a god with you, and you know it not. Do you think  that I mean some god of silver or of gold, and external? You carry him  within yourself, and you perceive not that you are polluting him by  impure thoughts and dirty deeds. And if an image of God were present,  you would not dare to do any of the things which you are doing; but when  God himself is present within and sees all and hears all, you are not  ashamed of thinking such things and doing such things, ignorant as you  are of your own nature and subject to the anger of God. Then why do we  fear when we are sending a young man from the school into active life,  lest he should do anything improperly, eat improperly, have improper  intercourse with women; and lest the rags in which he is wrapped should  debase him, lest fine garments should make him proud. This youth (if he  acts thus) does not know his own God; he knows not with whom he sets out  (into the world). But can we endure when he says, \"I wish I had you  (God) with me.\" Have you not God with you? and do you seek for any other  when you have him? or will God tell you anything else than this? If you  were a statue of Phidias, either Athena or Zeus, you would think both of  yourself and of the artist, and if you had any understanding (power of  perception) you would try to do nothing unworthy of him who made you or  of yourself, and try not to appear in an unbecoming dress (attitude) to  those who look upon you. But now because Zeus has made you, for this  reason do you care not how you shall appear? And yet is the artist (in  the one case) like the artist in the other? or the work in the one case  like the other? And what work of an artist, for instance, has in itself  the faculties, which the artist shows in making it? Is it not marble or  bronze, or gold or ivory? and the Athena of Phidias, when she has once  extended the hand and received in it the figure of Victory, stands in  that attitude for ever. But the works of God have power of motion, they  breathe, they have the faculty of using the appearances of things and  the power of examining them. Being the work of such an artist do you  dishonor him? And what shall I say, not only that he made you, but also  entrusted you to yourself and made you a deposit to yourself? Will you  not think of this too, but do you also dishonor your guardianship? But  if God had entrusted an orphan to you, would you thus neglect him? He  has delivered yourself to your own care, and says: \"I had no one fitter  to entrust him to than yourself; keep him for me such as he is by  nature, modest, faithful, erect, unterrified, free from passion and  perturbation.\" And then you do not keep him such.    But some will say, Whence has this fellow got the arrogance which he  displays and these supercilious looks? I have not yet so much gravity as  befits a philosopher; for I do not yet feel confidence in what I have  learned and in what I have assented to. I still fear my own weakness.  Let me get confidence and then you shall see a countenance such as I  ought to have and an attitude such as I ought to have; then I will show  to you the statue, when it is perfected, when it is polished. What do  you expect? a supercilious countenance? Does the Zeus at Olympia lift up  his brow? No, his look is fixed as becomes him who is ready to say:      Irrevocable is my word and shall not fail.--Iliad, i., 526.    Such will I show myself to you, faithful, modest, noble, free from  perturbation. What, and immortal, too, except from old age, and from  sickness? No, but dying as becomes a god, sickening as becomes a god.  This power I possess; this I can do. But the rest I do not possess, nor  can I do. I will show the nerves (strength) of a philosopher. What  nerves are these? A desire never disappointed, an aversion which never  falls on that which it would avoid, a proper pursuit ([Greek: hormaen]),  a diligent purpose, an assent which is not rash. These you shall see.           *       *       *       *       *    THAT WHEN WE CANNOT FULFIL THAT WHICH THE CHARACTER OF A MAN PROMISES,  WE ASSUME THE CHARACTER OF A PHILOSOPHER.--It is no common (easy) thing  to do this only, to fulfil the promise of a man's nature. For what is a  man? The answer is, A rational and mortal being. Then by the rational  faculty from whom are we separated? From wild beasts. And from what  others? From sheep and like animals. Take care then to do nothing like a  wild beast; but if you do, you have lost the character of a man; you  have not fulfilled your promise. See that you do nothing like a sheep;  but if you do, in this case also the man is lost. What then do we do as  sheep? When we act gluttonously, when we act lewdly, when we act rashly,  filthily, inconsiderately, to what have we declined? To sheep. What have  we lost? The rational faculty. When we act contentiously and harmfully  and passionately and violently, to what have we declined? To wild  beasts. Consequently some of us are great wild beasts, and others little  beasts, of a bad disposition and small, whence we may say, Let me be  eaten by a lion. But in all these ways the promise of a man acting as a  man is destroyed. For when is a conjunctive (complex) proposition  maintained? When it fulfils what its nature promises; so that the  preservation of a complex proposition is when it is a conjunction of  truths. When is a disjunctive maintained? When it fulfils what it  promises. When are flutes, a lyre, a horse, a dog, preserved? (When they  severally keep their promise.) What is the wonder then if man also in  like manner is preserved, and in like manner is lost? Each man is  improved and preserved by corresponding acts, the carpenter by acts of  carpentry, the grammarian by acts of grammar. But if a man accustoms  himself to write ungrammatically, of necessity his art will be corrupted  and destroyed. Thus modest actions preserve the modest man, and immodest  actions destroy him; and actions of fidelity preserve the faithful man,  and the contrary actions destroy him. And on the other hand contrary  actions strengthen contrary characters: shamelessness strengthens the  shameless man, faithlessness the faithless man, abusive words the  abusive man, anger the man of an angry temper, and unequal receiving and  giving make the avaricious man more avaricious.    For this reason philosophers admonish us not to be satisfied with  learning only, but also to add study, and then practice. For we have  long been accustomed to do contrary things, and we put in practice  opinions which are contrary to true opinions. If then we shall not also  put in practice right opinions, we shall be nothing more than the  expositors of the opinions of others. For now who among us is not able  to discourse according to the rules of art about good and evil things  (in this fashion)? That of things some are good, and some are bad, and  some are indifferent: the good then are virtues, and the things which  participate in virtues; and the bad are the contrary; and the  indifferent are wealth, health, reputation. Then, if in the midst of our  talk there should happen some greater noise than usual, or some of those  who are present should laugh at us, we are disturbed. Philosopher, where  are the things which you were talking about? Whence did you produce and  utter them? From the lips, and thence only. Why then"]]]
