Lives the man    Whom bounteous heaven has destined to espouse her?    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Make haste, then, to her aid; you have no time to lose, if you  don't wish this fruit of all the virtues to drop into the mouth  of some greasy-headed rustic of devout habits.    KING.    The lady is not her own mistress, and her foster-father is not at  home.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Well, but tell me, did she look at all kindly upon you?    KING.      Maidens brought up in a hermitage are naturally    shy and reserved; but for all that    She did look towards me, though she quick withdrew    Her stealthy glances when she met my gaze;    She smiled upon me sweetly, but disguised    With maiden grace the secret of her smiles.    Coy love was half unveiled; then, sudden checked    By modesty, left half to be divined.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Why, of course, my dear friend, you never could seriously expect  that at the very first sight she would fall over head ears in  love with you, and without more ado come and sit in your lap.    KING.      When we parted from each other, she betrayed    her liking for me by clearer indications, but still with the                                                 utmost modesty.    Scarce had the fair one from my presence passed,    When, suddenly, without apparent cause,    She stopped; and, counterfeiting pain, exclaimed,    'My foot is wounded by this prickly grass,'    Then, glancing at me tenderly, she feigned    Another charming pretext for delay,    Pretending that a bush had caught her robe    And turned as if to disentangle it.    MA[T.]HAVYA    I trust you have laid in a good stock of provisions,  for I see you intend making this consecrated grove your  game-preserve, and will be roaming here in quest of sport for  some time to come.    KING.    You must know, my good fellow, that I have been recognised by  some of the inmates of the hermitage. Now I want the assistance  of your fertile invention, in devising some excuse for going  there again.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    There is but one expedient that I can suggest. You are the King,  are you not?    KING.    What then?    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Say you have come for the sixth part of their grain [38], which  they owe you for tribute.    KING.    No, no, foolish man; those hermits pay me a very different kind  of tribute, which I value more than heaps of gold or jewels;  observe,      The tribute which my other subjects bring    Must moulder into dust, but holy men    Present me with a portion of the fruits    Of penitential services and prayers--    A precious and imperishable gift.    A VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.    We are fortunate; here is the object of our search.    KING.                                               [_Listening_.    Surely those must be the voices of hermits, to judge by their  deep tones.    WARDER.                                              [_Entering_.    Victory to the King! two young hermits are in waiting outside,  and solicit an audience of your Majesty.    KING.    Introduce them Immediately.    WARDER.    I will, my liege.    [_Goes out, and re-enters with_ TWO YOUNG HERMITS.]    This way, Sirs, this way.                               [_Both the_ HERMITS _look at the KING.    FIRST HERMIT.    How majestic is his mien, and yet what confidence it inspires!  But this might be expected in a king, whose character and habits  have earned for him a title only one degree removed from that of  a Sage [39].      In this secluded grove, whose sacred joys    All may participate, he deigns to dwell    Like one of us; and daily treasures up    A store of purest merit for himself,    By the protection of our holy rites.    In his own person wondrously are joined    Both majesty and saintlike holiness;    And often chanted by inspired bards [40],    His hallowed title of 'Imperial Sage'    Ascends in joyous accents to the skies.    SECOND HERMIT.    Bear in mind, Gautama, that this is the great Dushyanta, the  friend of Indra.    FIRST HERMIT.    What of that?    SECOND HERMIT.      Where is the wonder if his nervous arm,    Puissant and massive as the iron bar    That binds a castle-gateway, singly sways    The sceptre of the universal earth,    E'en to its dark-green boundary of waters?    Or if the gods, beholden to his aid    In their fierce warfare with the powers of hell [41],    Should blend his name with Indra's in their songs    Of victory, and gratefully accord    No lower meed of praise to his braced bow,    Than to the thunders of the god of heaven?    BOTH THE HERMITS.                                 [_Approaching_.    Victory to the King!    KING.                                    [_Rising from his seat_.    Hail to you both!    BOTH THE HERMITS.    Heaven bless your Majesty!                                                [_They offer fruits_.    KING.                     [_Respectfully receiving the offering_.    Tell me, I pray you, the object of your visit.    BOTH THE HERMITS.    The inhabitants of the hermitage, having heard of your Majesty's  sojourn in our neighbourhood, make this humble petition:--    KING.    What are their commands?    BOTH THE HERMITS.    In the absence of our Superior, the great sage Kanwa, evil demons  are disturbing our sacrificial rites [42]. Deign, therefore,  accompanied by your charioteer, to take up your abode in our  hermitage for a few days.    KING.    I am honoured by your invitation.    MA[T.]HAVYA.                                              [_Aside_.    Most opportune and convenient, certainly!    KING.                                                 [_Smiling_.    Ho, there, Raivatika! Tell the charioteer from me to bring round  the chariot with my bow.    WARDER.    I will, Sire.                                                             [_Exit_.    BOTH THE HERMITS.                                    [_Joyfully_.      Well it becomes the King by acts of grace    To emulate the virtues of his race.    Such acts thy lofty destiny attest;    Thy mission is to succour the distressed.    KING.                                   [_Bowing to the_ HERMITS.    Go first, reverend Sirs, I will follow you immediately.    BOTH THE HERMITS.    May victory attend you!                                                           [_Exeunt_.    KING.    My dear Ma[T.]Havya, are not you full of longing to see  [S']akoontala?    MA[T.]HAVYA.    To tell you the truth, though I was just now brimful of desire to  see her, I have not a drop left since this piece of news about  the demons.    KING.    Never fear; you shall keep close to me for protection.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Well, you must be my guardian-angel, and act the part of a very  Vishnu [43] to me.    WARDER.                                              [_Entering_.    Sire, the chariot is ready, and only waits to conduct you to  victory. But here is a messenger named Karabhaka, just arrived  from your capital, with a message from the Queen, your mother.    KING.                                            [_Respectfully_.    How say you? a messenger from the venerable Queen?    WARDER.    Even so.    KING.    Introduce him at once.    WARDER.    I will, Sire.    [_Goes out and re-enters with_ KARABHAKA.]    Behold the King. Approach.    KARABHAKA.    Victory to the King! The Queen-mother bids me say that in four  days from the present time she intends celebrating a solemn  ceremony for the advancement and preservation of her son. She  expects that your Majesty will honour her with your presence on  that occasion.    KING.    This places me in a dilemma. Here, on the one hand, is the  commission of these holy men to be executed; and, on the other,  the command of my revered parent to be obeyed. Both duties are  too sacred to be neglected. What is to be done?    MA[T.]HAVYA.    You will have to take up an intermediate position between the  two, like King Tri[s']anku [44], who was suspended between heaven  and earth, because the sage Vi[s']wamitra commanded him to mount up  to heaven, and the gods ordered him down again.    KING.    I am certainly very much perplexed. For here,      Two different duties are required of me    In widely distant places; how can I    In my own person satisfy them both?    Thus is my mind distracted, and impelled    In opposite directions like a stream    That, driven back by rocks, still rushes on,    Forming two currents in its eddying course.                                                      [_Reflecting_.]    Friend Ma[T.]Havya, as you were my playfellow in childhood, the  Queen has already received you like a second son; go you, then,  back to her, and tell her of my solemn engagement to assist these  holy men. You can supply my place in the ceremony, and act the  part of a son to the Queen.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    With the greatest pleasure in the world; but don't suppose that  I am really coward enough to have the slightest fear of those  trumpery demons.    KING.    Oh! of course not; a great Brahman like you could not possibly  give way to such weakness.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    You must let me travel in a manner suitable to the King's younger  brother.    KING.    Yes, I shall send my retinue with you, that there may be no  farther disturbance in this sacred forest.    MA[T.]HAVYA,                                       [_With a strut_.    Already I feel quite like a young prince.    KING.                                                   [_Aside_.    This is a giddy fellow, and in all probability he will let out  the truth about my present pursuit to the women of the palace.  What is to be done? I must say something to deceive him.    [_Aloud to_ MA[T.]HAVYA, _taking him by the hand_.]    Dear friend, I am going to the hermitage wholly and solely out of  respect for its pious inhabitants, and not because I have really  any liking for [S']akoontala, the hermit's daughter. Observe:--      What suitable communion could there be    Between a monarch and a rustic girl?    I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12187"],[0,"The Mystery of 31 New Inn (#10)"],[1,"now and attend to  some rather important business that I have had to leave unfinished. Mrs.  Schallibaum will be able to give you all the assistance that you  require, and will order the carriage when you think it safe to leave the  patient. In case I should not see you again I will say 'good night.' I  hope you won't think me very unceremonious.\"    He shook hands with me and went out of the room, leaving me, as I have  said, profoundly astonished that he should consider any business of more  moment than the condition of his friend, whose life, even now, was but  hanging by a thread. However, it was really no concern of mine. I could  do without him, and the resuscitation of this unfortunate half-dead man  gave me occupation enough to engross my whole attention.    The melancholy progress up and down the room re-commenced, and with it  the mumbled protests from the patient. As we walked, and especially as  we turned, I caught frequent glimpses of the housekeeper's face. But it  was nearly always in profile. She appeared to avoid looking me in the  face, though she did so once or twice; and on each of these occasions  her eyes were directed at me in a normal manner without any sign of a  squint. Nevertheless, I had the impression that when her face was turned  away from me she squinted. The \"swivel eye\"--the left--was towards me as  she held the patient's right arm, and it was almost continuously turned  in my direction, whereas I felt convinced that she was really looking  straight before her, though, of course, her right eye was invisible to  me. It struck me, even at the time, as an odd affair, but I was too much  concerned about my charge to give it much consideration.    Meanwhile the patient continued to revive apace. And the more he  revived, the more energetically did he protest against this wearisome  perambulation. But he was evidently a polite gentleman, for, muddled as  his faculties were, he managed to clothe his objections in courteous and  even gracious forms of speech singularly out of agreement with the  character that Mr. Weiss had given him.    \"I thangyou,\" he mumbled thickly. \"Ver' good take s'much trouble. Think  I will lie down now.\" He looked wistfully at the bed, but I wheeled him  about and marched him once more down the room. He submitted  unresistingly, but as we again approached the bed he reopened the  matter.    \"S'quite s'fficient, thang you. Gebback to bed now. Much 'bliged frall  your kindness\"--here I turned him round--\"no, really; m'feeling rather  tired. Sh'like to lie down now, f'you'd be s'good.\"    \"You must walk about a little longer, Mr. Graves,\" I said. \"It would be  very bad for you to go to sleep again.\"    He looked at me with a curious, dull surprise, and reflected awhile as  if in some perplexity. Then he looked at me again and said:    \"Thing, sir, you are mistake--mistaken me--mist--\"    Here Mrs. Schallibaum interrupted sharply:    \"The doctor thinks it's good for you to walk about. You've been sleeping  too much. He doesn't want you to sleep any more just now.\"    \"Don't wanter sleep; wanter lie down,\" said the patient.    \"But you mustn't lie down for a little while. You must walk about for a  few minutes more. And you'd better not talk. Just walk up and down.\"    \"There's no harm in his talking,\" said I; \"in fact it's good for him. It  will help to keep him awake.\"    \"I should think it would tire him,\" said Mrs. Schallibaum; \"and it  worries me to hear him asking to lie down when we can't let him.\"    She spoke sharply and in an unnecessarily high tone so that the patient  could not fail to hear. Apparently he took in the very broad hint  contained in the concluding sentence, for he trudged wearily and  unsteadily up and down the room for some time without speaking, though  he continued to look at me from time to time as if something in my  appearance puzzled him exceedingly. At length his intolerable longing  for repose overcame his politeness and he returned to the attack.    \"Surely v' walked enough now. Feeling very tired. Am really. Would you  be s'kind 's t'let me lie down few minutes?\"    \"Don't you think he might lie down for a little while?\" Mrs. Schallibaum  asked.    I felt his pulse, and decided that he was really becoming fatigued, and  that it would be wiser not to overdo the exercise while he was so weak.  Accordingly, I consented to his returning to bed, and turned him round  in that direction; whereupon he tottered gleefully towards his  resting-place like a tired horse heading for its stable.    As soon as he was tucked in, I gave him a full cup of coffee, which he  drank with some avidity as if thirsty. Then I sat down by the bedside,  and, with a view to keeping him awake, began once more to ply him with  questions.    \"Does your head ache, Mr. Graves?\" I asked.    \"The doctor says 'does your head ache?'\" Mrs. Schallibaum squalled, so  loudly that the patient started perceptibly.    \"I heard him, m'dear girl,\" he answered with a faint smile. \"Not deaf  you know. Yes. Head aches a good deal. But I thing this gennleman  mistakes--\"    \"He says you are to keep awake. You mustn't go to sleep again, and you  are not to close your eyes.\"    \"All ri' Pol'n. Keep'm open,\" and he proceeded forthwith to shut them  with an air of infinite peacefulness. I grasped his hand and shook it  gently, on which he opened his eyes and looked at me sleepily. The  housekeeper stroked his head, keeping her face half-turned from me--as  she had done almost constantly, to conceal the squinting eye, as I  assumed--and said:    \"Need we keep you any longer, doctor? It is getting very late and you  have a long way to go.\"    I looked doubtfully at the patient. I was loath to leave him,  distrusting these people as I did. But I had my work to do on the  morrow, with, perhaps, a night call or two in the interval, and the  endurance even of a general practitioner has its limits.    \"I think I heard the carriage some time ago,\" Mrs. Schallibaum added.    I rose hesitatingly and looked at my watch. It had turned half-past  eleven.    \"You understand,\" I said in a low voice, \"that the danger is not over?  If he is left now he will fall asleep, and in all human probability will  never wake. You clearly understand that?\"    \"Yes, quite clearly. I promise you he shall not be allowed to fall  asleep again.\"    As she spoke, she looked me full in the face for a few moments, and I  noted that her eyes had a perfectly normal appearance, without any trace  whatever of a squint.    \"Very well,\" I said. \"On that understanding I will go now; and I shall  hope to find our friend quite recovered at my next visit.\"    I turned to the patient, who was already dozing, and shook his hand  heartily.    \"Good-bye, Mr. Graves!\" I said. \"I am sorry to have to disturb your  repose so much; but you must keep awake, you know. Won't do to go to  sleep.\"    \"Ver' well,\" he replied drowsily. \"Sorry t' give you all this trouble.  L' keep awake. But I think you're mistak'n--\"    \"He says it's very important that you shouldn't go to sleep, and that I  am to see that you don't. Do you understand?\"    \"Yes, I un'stan'. But why does this gennlem'n--?\"    \"Now it's of no use for you to ask a lot of questions,\" Mrs. Schallibaum  said playfully; \"we'll talk to you to-morrow. Good night, doctor. I'll  light you down the stairs, but I won't come down with you, or the  patient will be falling asleep again.\"    Taking this definite dismissal, I retired, followed by a dreamily  surprised glance from the sick man. The housekeeper held the candle over  the balusters until I reached the bottom of the stairs, when I perceived  through the open door along the passage a glimmer of light from the  carriage lamps. The coachman was standing just outside, faintly  illuminated by the very dim lamplight, and as I stepped into the  carriage he remarked in his Scotch dialect that I \"seemed to have been  makin' a nicht of it.\" He did not wait for any reply--none being in fact  needed--but shut the door and locked it.    I lit my little pocket-lamp and hung it on the back cushion. I even drew  the board and notebook from my pocket. But it seemed rather unnecessary  to take a fresh set of notes, and, to tell the truth, I rather shirked  the labour, tired as I was after my late exertions; besides, I wanted  to think over the events of the evening, while they were fresh in my  memory. Accordingly I put away the notebook, filled and lighted my pipe,  and settled myself to review the incidents attending my second visit to  this rather uncanny house.    Considered in leisurely retrospect, that visit offered quite a number of  problems that called for elucidation. There was the patient's condition,  for instance. Any doubt as to the cause of his symptoms was set at rest  by the effect of the antidotes. Mr. Graves was certainly under the  influence of morphine, and the only doubtful question was how he had  become so. That he had taken the poison himself was incredible. No  morphinomaniac would take such a knock-down dose. It was practically  certain that the poison had been administered by someone else, and, on  Mr. Weiss's own showing, there was no one but himself and the  housekeeper who could have administered it. And to this conclusion all  the other very queer circumstances pointed.    What were these circumstances? They were, as I have said, numerous,  though many of them seemed trivial. To begin with, Mr. Weiss's habit of  appearing some time after my arrival and disappearing some time before  my departure was decidedly odd. But still more odd was his sudden  departure this evening on what looked like a mere pretext. That  departure coincided in time with the sick man's recovery of the power of  speech. Could it be that Mr. Weiss was afraid that the half-conscious  man might say something compromising to him in my presence? It looked  rather like it. And yet he had gone away and left me with the patient  and the"]]]
