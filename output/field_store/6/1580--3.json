When he was ready for the university he  wished to go to Goettingen to study the old humanities, but his father  was bent on making a lawyer of him. So it came about that some ten  years of his early life were devoted, first as a student and then as a  practitioner, to a reluctant and half-hearted grapple with the  intricacies of Holy Roman law.    At the age of sixteen Goethe entered the University of Leipzig, where  he remained about three years. The law lectures bored him and he soon  ceased to attend them. The other studies that he took up, especially  logic and philosophy, seemed to him arid and unprofitable--mere  conventional verbiage without any bed-rock of real knowledge. So he  presently fell into that mood of disgust with academic learning which  was afterwards to form the keynote of _Faust_. Outside the university  he found congenial work in Oeser's drawing-school. Oeser was an artist  of no great power with the brush, but a genial man, a friend of  Winckelmann, and an enthusiast for Greek art. Goethe learned to admire  and love him, and from this time on, for some twenty years, his  constant need of artistic expression found hardly less satisfaction in  drawing from nature than in poetry.    His poetic ambition received little encouragement in university  circles. Those to whom he read his ambitious verses made light of  them. The venerated Gellert, himself a poet of repute, advised the lad  to cultivate a good prose style and look to his handwriting. No wonder  that he despaired of his talent, concluded that he could never be a  poet, and burnt his effusions. A maddening love-affair with his  landlady's daughter, Anna Katharina Schoenkopf, revived the dying lyric  flame, and he began to write verses in the gallant erotic vein then  and there fashionable--verses that tell of love-lorn shepherds and  shepherdesses, give sage advice to girls about keeping their  innocence, and moralize on the ways of this wicked world. They show no  signs of lyric genius. His short-lived passion for Annette, as he  called her, whom he tormented with his jealousy until she lost  patience and broke off the intimacy, was also responsible for his  first play, _Die Laune des Verliebten_, or _The Lover's Wayward  Humor_. It is a pretty one-act pastoral in alexandrine verse, the  theme being the punishment of an over-jealous lover. What is mainly  significant in these Leipzig poetizings is the fact that they grew out  of genuine experience. Goethe had resolved to drop his ambitious  projects, such as _Belshazzar_, and coin his own real thoughts and  feelings into verse. Thus early he was led into the way of poetic  \"confession.\"    In the summer of 1768 he was suddenly prostrated by a grave  illness--an internal hemorrhage which was at first thought to portend  consumption. Pale and languid he returned to his father's house, and  for several months it was uncertain whether he was to live or die.  During this period of seclusion he became deeply interested in magic,  alchemy, astrology, cabalism, and all that sort of thing. He even set  up a kind of alchemist's laboratory to search experimentally for the  panacea. Out of these abstruse studies grew Faust's wonderful dream of  an ecstatic spirit-life to be attained by natural magic. Of course the  menace of impending death drew his thoughts in the direction of  religion. Among the intimate friends of the family was the devout  Susanna von Klettenberg, one of the leading spirits in a local  conventicle of the Moravian Brethren. This lady--afterwards  immortalized as the \"beautiful soul\" of _Wilhelm Meister_--tried to  have the sick youth make his peace with God in her way, that is, by  accepting Christ as an ever-present personal saviour. While he never  would admit a conviction of sin he envied the calm of the saintly  maiden and was so far converted that he attended the meetings of the  Brethren, took part in their communion service, and for a while spoke  the language of a devout pietist.    This religious experience of his youth bit deep into Goethe's  character. He soon drifted away from the pietists and their ways, he  came to have a poor opinion of priests and priestcraft, and in time  men called him a heathen. Nevertheless his nature had been so deeply  stirred in his youth by religion's mystic appeal that he never  afterwards lost his reverence for genuine religious feeling. To the  end of his days the aspiration of the human soul for communion with  God found in him a delicate and sympathetic interpreter.    During his convalescence Goethe retouched a score of his Leipzig songs  and published them anonymously, with music by his friend Breitkopf,  under the title of _New Songs_. He regarded them at the time as  trifles that had come into being without art or effort. \"Young, in  love, and full of feeling,\" he had sung them so, while \"playing the  old game of youth.\" To-day they seem to convey little forewarning of  the matchless lyric gift that was soon to awaken, being a shade too  intellectual and sententious. One hears more of the critic's comment  than of the poet's cry. It was at this time also that he rewrote an  earlier Leipzig play, expanding it from one act to three and giving it  the title _Die Mitschuldigen_, or _The Fellow-culprits_. It is a sort  of rogue's comedy in middle-class life, written in the alexandrine  verse, which was soon to be discarded along with other French  fashions. We have a quartet consisting of an inquisitive inn-keeper,  his mismated sentimental daughter, her worthless husband, and her  former lover. They tangle themselves up in a series of low intrigues  and are finally unmasked as one and all poor miserable sinners.  Technically it is a good play--lively, diverting, well put together.  But one can not call it very edifying.    In the spring of 1770 Goethe entered the University of Strassburg,  which was at that time in French territory. It was a part of his  general purpose to better his French, but the actual effect of his  sojourn in Alsatia was to put him out of humor with all French  standards, especially with the classic French drama, and to excite in  him a fervid enthusiasm for the things of the fatherland. This was due  partly to the influence of Herder, with whom he now came into close  personal relations. From Herder, who was six years his senior and  already known by his _Fragments_ and _Critical Forests_ as a trenchant  and original critic, he heard the gospel of a literary revolution.  Rules and conventions were to be thrown overboard; the new watchwords  were nature, power, originality, genius, fulness of expression. He  conceived a boundless admiration for Homer, Ossian, and Shakespeare,  in each of whom he saw the mirror of an epoch and a national life. He  became an enthusiastic collector of Alsatian folksongs and was  fascinated by the Strassburg minster--at a time when \"Gothic\" was  generally regarded as a synonym of barbarous. Withal his gift for  song-making came to a new stage of perfection under the inspiration of  his love for the village maid Friederike Brion. From this time forth  he was the prince of German lyrists.    In the summer of 1771 he returned to Frankfurt once more, this time  with the title of licentiate in law, and began to practise in a  perfunctory way, with his heart in his literary projects. By the end  of the year he had written out the first draft of a play which he  afterwards revised and published anonymously (in 1773) under the title  of _Goetz von Berlichingen_. By its exuberant fulness of life, its  bluff German heartiness, and the freshness and variety of its scenes,  it took the public by storm, notwithstanding its disregard of the  approved rules of play-writing.    [Illustration: JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE _From the Painting by J.   Stieler_]    The next year he published _The Sufferings of Young Werther_, a tragic  tale of a weak-willed sentimental youth of hyperesthetic tendencies,  who commits suicide because of disappointment in love. The story was  the greatest literary triumph that Germany had ever known, and in  point of sheer artistic power it remains to this day the best of  novels in the tragic-sentimental vein. These two works carried the  name of Goethe far and wide and made him the accepted leader of the  literary revolution which long afterwards came to be known, from the  title of a play by Klinger, as the Storm and Stress.    The years 1773-1775 were for Goethe a time of high emotional tension,  from which he sought relief in rapid, desultory, and multifarious  writing. Exquisite songs, musical comedies of a sentimental tinge,  humorous and satiric skits in dramatic form, prose tragedy of  passionate error, and poetic tragedy of titanic revolt--all these and  more welled up from a sub-conscious spring of feeling, taking little  counsel of the sober intellect. Several minor productions were left  unfinished and were afterwards published in fragmentary form. Such is  the case with _Prometheus_, a splendid fragment, in which we get a  glimpse of the Titan battling, as the friend of man, against the  ever-living gods. Of the works completed and published at this time,  aside from _Goetz_ and _Werther_, the most notable were _Clavigo_ and  _Stella_, prose tragedies in which a fickle lover meets with condign  punishment. Another prose tragedy, _Egmont_, with its hero conceived  as a \"demonic\" nature borne on to his doom by his own buoyancy of  spirit, was nearly finished. Most important of all, a considerable  portion of _Faust_, which was to be its author's great life-work, was  \"stormed out\" during these early years at Frankfurt.

We know what their trump card is and can  arrange our play accordingly, so long as we do not show our hand.\"    \"You speak of the police as your antagonists; I noticed that at the  'Yard' this morning, and was surprised to find that they accepted the  position. But surely their business is to discover the actual offender,  not to fix the crime on some particular person.\"    \"That would seem to be so,\" replied Thorndyke, \"but in practice it is  otherwise. When the police have made an arrest they work for a  conviction. If the man is innocent, that is his business, not theirs; it  is for him to prove it. The system is a pernicious one--especially since  the efficiency of a police officer is, in consequence, apt to be  estimated by the number of convictions he has secured, and an inducement  is thus held out to him to obtain a conviction, if possible; but it is  of a piece with legislative procedure in general. Lawyers are not  engaged in academic discussions or in the pursuit of truth, but each is  trying, by hook or by crook, to make out a particular case without  regard to its actual truth or even to the lawyer's own belief on the  subject. That is what produces so much friction between lawyers and  scientific witnesses; neither can understand the point of view of the  other. But we must not sit over the table chattering like this; it has  gone half-past seven, and Polton will be wanting to make this room  presentable.\"    \"I notice you don't use your office much,\" I remarked.    \"Hardly at all, excepting as a repository for documents and stationery.  It is very cheerless to talk in an office, and nearly all my business is  transacted with solicitors and counsel who are known to me, so there is  no need for such formalities. All right, Polton; we shall be ready for  you in five minutes.\"    The Temple bell was striking eight as, at Thorndyke's request, I threw  open the iron-bound \"oak\"; and even as I did so the sound of footsteps  came up from the stairs below. I waited on the landing for our two  visitors, and led them into the room.    \"I am so glad to make your acquaintance,\" said Mrs. Hornby, when I had  done the honours of introduction; \"I have heard so much about you from  Juliet--\"    \"Really, my dear aunt,\" protested Miss Gibson, as she caught my eye with  a look of comical alarm, \"you will give Dr. Thorndyke a most erroneous  impression. I merely mentioned that I had intruded on him without notice  and had been received with undeserved indulgence and consideration.\"    \"You didn't put it quite in that way, my dear,\" said Mrs. Hornby, \"but I  suppose it doesn't matter.\"    \"We are highly gratified by Miss Gibson's favourable report of us,  whatever may have been the actual form of expression,\" said Thorndyke,  with a momentary glance at the younger lady which covered her with  smiling confusion, \"and we are deeply indebted to you for taking so much  trouble to help us.\"    \"It is no trouble at all, but a great pleasure,\" replied Mrs. Hornby;  and she proceeded to enlarge on the matter until her remarks threatened,  like the rippling circles produced by a falling stone, to spread out  into infinity. In the midst of this discourse Thorndyke placed chairs  for the two ladies, and, leaning against the mantelpiece, fixed a stony  gaze upon the small handbag that hung from Mrs. Hornby's wrist.    \"Is the 'Thumbograph' in your bag?\" interrupted Miss Gibson, in response  to this mute appeal.    \"Of course it is, my dear Juliet,\" replied the elder lady. \"You saw me  put it in yourself. What an odd girl you are. Did you think I should  have taken it out and put it somewhere else? Not that these handbags are  really very secure, you know, although I daresay they are safer than  pockets, especially now that it is the fashion to have the pocket at the  back. Still, I have often thought how easy it would be for a thief or a  pickpocket or some other dreadful creature of that kind, don't you know,  to make a snatch and--in fact, the thing has actually happened. Why, I  knew a lady--Mrs. Moggridge, you know, Juliet--no, it wasn't Mrs.  Moggridge, that was another affair, it was Mrs.--Mrs.--dear me, how  silly of me!--now, what was her name? Can't you help me, Juliet? You  must surely remember the woman. She used to visit a good deal at the  Hawley-Johnsons'--I think it was the Hawley-Johnsons', or else it was  those people, you know--\"    \"Hadn't you better give Dr. Thorndyke the 'Thumbograph'?\" interrupted  Miss Gibson.    \"Why, of course, Juliet, dear. What else did we come here for?\" With a  slightly injured expression, Mrs. Hornby opened the little bag and  commenced, with the utmost deliberation, to turn out its contents on to  the table. These included a laced handkerchief, a purse, a card-case, a  visiting list, a packet of _papier poudre_, and when she had laid the  last-mentioned article on the table, she paused abruptly and gazed into  Miss Gibson's face with the air of one who has made a startling  discovery.    \"I remember the woman's name,\" she said in an impressive voice. \"It was  Gudge--Mrs. Gudge, the sister-in-law of--\"    Here Miss Gibson made an unceremonious dive into the open bag and fished  out a tiny parcel wrapped in notepaper and secured with a silk thread.    \"Thank you,\" said Thorndyke, taking it from her hand just as Mrs. Hornby  was reaching out to intercept it. He cut the thread and drew from its  wrappings a little book bound in red cloth, with the word \"Thumbograph\"  stamped upon the cover, and was beginning to inspect it when Mrs. Hornby  rose and stood beside him.    \"That,\" said she, as she opened the book at the first page, \"is the  thumb-mark of a Miss Colley. She is no connection of ours. You see it is  a little smeared--she said Reuben jogged her elbow, but I don't think he  did; at any rate he assured me he did not, and, you know--\"    \"Ah! Here is one we are looking for,\" interrupted Thorndyke, who had  been turning the leaves of the book regardless of Mrs. Hornby's rambling  comments; \"a very good impression, too, considering the rather rough  method of producing it.\"    He reached out for the reading lens that hung from its nail above the  mantelpiece, and I could tell by the eagerness with which he peered  through it at the thumb-print that he was looking for something. A  moment later I felt sure that he had found that something which he had  sought, for, though he replaced the lens upon its nail with a quiet and  composed air and made no remark, there was a sparkle of the eye and a  scarcely perceptible flush of suppressed excitement and triumph which I  had begun to recognise beneath the impassive mask that he presented to  the world.    \"I shall ask you to leave this little book with me, Mrs. Hornby,\" he  said, breaking in upon that lady's inconsequent babblings, \"and, as I  may possibly put it in evidence, it would be a wise precaution for you  and Miss Gibson to sign your names--as small as possible--on the page  which bears Mr. Reuben's thumb-mark. That will anticipate any suggestion  that the book has been tampered with after leaving your hands.\"    \"It would be a great impertinence for anyone to make any such  suggestion,\" Mrs. Hornby began; but on Thorndyke's placing his fountain  pen in her hand, she wrote her signature in the place indicated and  handed the pen to Miss Gibson, who signed underneath.    \"And now,\" said Thorndyke, \"we will take an enlarged photograph of this  page with the thumb-mark; not that it is necessary that it should be  done now, as you are leaving the book in my possession; but the  photograph will be wanted, and as my man is expecting us and has the  apparatus ready, we may as well despatch the business at once.\"    To this both the ladies readily agreed (being, in fact, devoured by  curiosity with regard to my colleague's premises), and we accordingly  proceeded to invade the set of rooms on the floor above, over which the  ingenious Polton was accustomed to reign in solitary grandeur.    It was my first visit to these mysterious regions, and I looked about me  with as much curiosity as did the two ladies. The first room that we  entered was apparently the workshop, for it contained a small  woodworker's bench, a lathe, a bench for metal work and a number of  mechanical appliances which I was not then able to examine; but I  noticed that the entire place presented to the eye a most unworkmanlike  neatness, a circumstance that did not escape Thorndyke's observation,  for his face relaxed into a grim smile as his eye travelled over the  bare benches and the clean-swept floor.    From this room we entered the laboratory, a large apartment, one side of  which was given up to chemical research, as was shown by the shelves of  reagents that covered the wall, and the flasks, retorts and other  apparatus that were arranged on the bench, like ornaments on a  drawing-room mantelpiece. On the opposite side of the room was a large,  massively-constructed copying camera, the front of which, carrying the  lens, was fixed, and an easel or copyholder travelled on parallel guides  towards, or away, from it, on a long stand.    This apparatus Thorndyke proceeded to explain to our visitors while  Polton was fixing the \"Thumbograph\" in a holder attached to the easel.    \"You see,\" he said, in answer to a"]]]
