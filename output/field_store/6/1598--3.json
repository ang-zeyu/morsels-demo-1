Caddagat  was twenty-four miles distant from Gool-Gool, and the latter part of the  road was very hilly. It was already past three o'clock, and, being  rainy, the short winter afternoon would dose in earlier; so I swallowed  my tea and cake with all expedition, so as not to delay Mr Hawden, who  was waiting to assist me into the buggy, where the groom was in charge  of the horses in the yard. He struck up a conversation with me  immediately.    \"Seeing your name on yer bags, an' knowin' you was belonging to the  Bossiers, I ask if yer might be a daughter of Dick Melvyn, of  Bruggabrong, out by Timlinbilly.\"    \"Yes, I am.\"    \"Well, miss, please remember me most kindly to yer pa; he was a good  boss was Dick Melvyn. I hope he's doin' well. I'm Billy Haizelip,  brother to Mary and Jane. You remember Jane, I s'pose, miss?\"    I hadn't time to say more than promise to send his remembrances to my  father, for Mr Hawden, saying we would be in the dark, had whipped his  horses and was bowling off at a great pace, in less than two minutes  covering a rise which put Gool-Gool out of sight. It was raining a  little, so I held over us the big umbrella, which grannie had sent,  while we discussed the weather, to the effect that rain was badly needed  and was a great novelty nowadays, and it was to be hoped it would  continue. There had been but little, but the soil here away was of that  rich loamy description which little water turns to mud. It clogged the  wheels and loaded the break-blocks; and the near side horse had a nasty  way of throwing his front feet, so that he deposited soft red lumps of  mud in our laps at every step. But, despite these trifling drawbacks, it  was delightful to be drawn without effort by a pair of fat horses in  splendid harness. It was a great contrast to our poor skinny old horse  at home, crawling along in much-broken harness, clumsily and much mended  with string and bits of hide.    Mr Hawden was not at all averse to talking. After emptying our tongues  of the weather, there was silence for some time, which he broke with,  \"So you are Mrs Bossier's grand-daughter, are you?\"    \"Not remembering my birth, I can't swear; but I believe myself to be  that same, as sure as eggs is eggs,\" I replied.    He laughed. \"Very good imitation of the coach-driver. But Mrs Bossier's  grand-daughter! Well, I should smile!\"    \"What at?\"    \"Your being Mrs Bossier's grand-daughter.\"    \"I fear, Mr Hawden, there is a suspicion reverse of complimentary in  your remark.\"    \"Well, I should smile! Would you like to have my opinion of you?\"    \"Nothing would please me more. I would value your opinion above all  things, and I'm sure--I feel certain--that you have formed a true  estimate of me.\"    At any other time his conceit would have brought upon himself a fine  snubbing, but today I was in high feather, and accordingly very  pleasant, and resolved to amuse myself by drawing him out.    \"Well, you are not a bit like Mrs Bossier or Mrs Bell; they are both so  good-looking,\" he continued.    \"Indeed!\"    \"I was disappointed when I saw you had no pretensions to prettiness, as  there's not a girl up these parts worth wasting a man's affections on,  and I was building great hopes on you. But I'm a great admirer of  beauty,\" he twaddled.    \"I am very sorry for you, Mr Hawden. I'm sure it would take quite a  paragon to be worthy of such affection as I'm sure yours would be,\" I  replied sympathetically.    \"Never mind. Don't worry about it. You're not a bad sort, and think a  fellow could have great fun with you.\"    \"I'm sure, Mr Hawden, you do me too much honour. It quite exhilarates me  to think that I meet with your approval in the smallest degree,\" I  replied with the utmost deference. \"You are so gentlemanly and nice that  I was alarmed at first lest you might despise me altogether.\"    \"No fear. You needn't be afraid of me; I'm not a bad sort of fellow,\" he  replied with the greatest encouragement.    By his accent and innocent style I detected he was not a colonial, so I  got him to relate his history. He was an Englishman by birth, but had  been to America, Spain, New Zealand, Tasmania, etc.; by his own make out  had ever been a man of note, and had played Old Harry everywhere.    I allowed him to gabble away full tilt for an hour on this subject,  unconscious that I had taken the measure of him, and was grinning  broadly to myself. Then I diverted him by inquiring how long since the  wire fence on our right had been put up. It bore evidence of recent  erection, and had replaced an old cockatoo fence which I remembered in  my childhood.    \"Fine fence, is it not? Eight wires, a top rail, and very stout posts.  Harry Beecham had that put up by contract this year. Twelve miles of it.  It cost him a lot: couldn't get any very low tenders, the ground being  so hard on account of the drought. Those trees are Five-Bob Downs--see,  away over against the range. But I suppose you know the places better  than I do.\"    We were now within an hour of our destination. How familiar were many  landmarks to me, although I had not seen them since I was eight years  old.    A river ran on our right, occasionally a glimmer of its noisy waters  visible through the shrubbery which profusely lined its banks. The short  evening was drawing to a close. The white mists brought by the rain were  crawling slowly down the hills, and settling in the hollows of the  ranges on our left. A V-shaped rift in them, known as Pheasant Gap, came  into view. Mr Hawden said it was well named, as it swarmed with  lyrebirds. Night was falling. The skreel of a hundred curlews arose from  the gullies--how I love their lonely wail!--and it was quite dark when  we pulled up before the front gate of Caddagat.    A score of dogs rushed yelping to meet us, the front door was thrown  open, lights and voices came streaming out.    I alighted from the buggy feeling rather nervous. I was a pauper with a  bad character. How would my grandmother receive me? Dear old soul, I had  nothing to fear. She folded me in a great warm-hearted hug, saying,  \"Dear me, child, your face is cold. I'm glad you've come. It has been a  terrible day, but we're glad to have the rain. You must be frozen. Get  in to the fire, child, as fast as you can. Get in to the fire, get in to  the fire. I hope you forgive me for not going to meet you.\" And there  was my mother's only sister, my tall graceful aunt, standing beside her,  giving me a kiss and cordial hand-clasp, and saying, \"Welcome, Sybylla.  We will be glad to have a young person to brighten up the old home once  more. I am sorry I was too unwell to meet you. You must be frozen; come  to the fire.\"      My aunt always spoke very little and very quietly, but there was  something in her high-bred style which went right home.    I could scarcely believe that they were addressing me. Surely they were  making a mistake. This reception was meant for some grand relative  honouring them with a visit, and not for the ugly, useless, bad little  pauper come to live upon their bounty.    Their welcome did more than all the sermons I had ever heard put  together towards thawing a little of the pitiless cynicism which  encrusted my heart.    \"Take the child inside, Helen, as fast as you can,\" said grannie, \"while  I see that the boy attends to the horses. The plaguey fellow can't be  trusted any further than the length of his nose. I told him to tie up  these dogs, and here they are yelp-yelping fit to deafen a person.\"    I left my wet umbrella on the veranda, and aunt Helen led me into the  dining-room, where a spruce maid was making a pleasant clatter in laying  the table. Caddagat was a very old style of house, and all the front  rooms opened onto the veranda without any such preliminary as a hall,  therefore it was necessary to pass through the dining-room to my  bedroom, which was a skillion at the back. While auntie paused for a  moment to give some orders to the maid, I noticed the heavy silver  serviette rings I remembered so well, and the old-fashioned  dinner-plates, and the big fire roaring in the broad white fireplace;  but more than all, the beautiful pictures on the walls and a table in a  corner strewn with papers, magazines, and several very new-looking  books. On the back of one of these I saw \"Corelli\", and on  another--great joy!--was _Trilby_. From the adjoining apartment, which  was the drawing-room, came the sweet full tones of a beautiful piano.  Here were three things for which I had been starving. An impulse to  revel in them immediately seized me. I felt like clearing the table at a  bound, seizing and beginning to read both books, and rushing in to the  piano and beginning to play upon it there and then, and examine the  pictures--all three things at once. Fortunately for the reputation of my  sanity, however, aunt Helen had by this time conducted me to a pretty  little bedroom, and saying it was to be mine, helped me to doff my cape  and hat.    While warming my fingers at the fire my eyes were arrested by a  beautiful portrait hanging above the mantelpiece. It represented a  lovely girl in the prime of youth and beauty, and attired in floating  white dinner draperies.    \"Oh, aunt Helen! isn't she lovely? It's you, isn't it?\"    \"No. Do you not recognize it as your mother? It was taken just before  her marriage. I must leave you now, but come out as soon as you arrange  yourself--your grandmother will be anxious to see you.\"    When aunt Helen left me I plastered my hair down in an instant without  even a glance in the mirror. I took not a particle of interest in my  attire, and would go about dressed anyhow. This was one symptom which  inclined my mother to the belief of my possible insanity, as to most  young girls dress is a great delight.

The fire-box is of copper, fitted with a fire brick arch  for coal burning, and the grate area is 15 square feet. The heating  surface is, in the tubes, 1,013 square feet; fire-box, 89 square feet;  total, 1,102 square feet. The wheel base is 15 ft. 8 in., and the tractive  power 88 lb. for each lb. of steam pressure in the cylinders. These  engines, working the fast passenger trains at a speed of about 45 miles  per hour, burn about 35 lb. of coal per mile, when taking trains weighing  about 230 tons gross. A variation from this type has been adopted on the  Northern and Welsh sections, known as the \"Precursor\" class. These engines  have 5 ft. 6 in. coupled wheels, and weigh 31 tons 8 cwt. in working  order, but in other respects are very similar to the standard engines just  described; with the Scotch express, averaging in total weight 187 tons,  between Crewe and Carlisle, over heavy gradients, they burn 33 lb. of coal  per mile. These engines, although much more powerful than the standard  type, are not nearly of so handsome an appearance, the drivers seeming  much too small for the boiler under which they are placed. But by far the  boldest innovation on existing practice is the new class of compound  locomotives now being introduced by Mr. Webb. It is a six wheel engine,  with leading wheels 4 ft. diameter, and two pairs of drivers, 6 ft. 6 in.  diameter. The trailing drivers are driven by a pair of outside cylinders,  18 in. diameter and 24 in. stroke; and the leading drivers by a single  low-pressure cylinder--which takes the exhaust steam from the  high-pressure cylinders--of 26 in. diameter and 24 in. stroke, placed  under the center of the smoke-box. The boiler is the same as that in the  standard type of engine, but the wheel base is 17 ft. 7 in., and in order  to allow it to traverse curves easily, the front axle is fitted with a  radial axle-box, which is in one casting from journal to journal, and  fitted at each end with brass steps for the bearings; the box is radial,  struck from the center of the rigid wheel base, and the horn plates are  curved to suit the box, the lateral motion being controlled by strong  springs. Another peculiarity of this engine is that, instead of the  ordinary link motion, it is fitted with Joy's valve gear, which is now  being more and more adopted. This gear--which is of a most ingenious  decription--dispenses altogether with eccentrics, and so allows the inside  bearings to be much increased, those on these engines being 131/2 in. long;  and it is also claimed for it that it is simpler and less costly, weighs  less, and is more correct in its action than the ordinary link motion; the  friction is less, the working parts are simplified, it takes less oil,  and is well under the driver's eye. It also allows larger cylinders to be  got in between the frames of inside cylinder engines, as, the slide valves  may be placed on the top or bottom of the cylinders. This latter advantage  is a great one, as, with the ordinary link motion, large cylinders are  exceedingly difficult to design so as to get the requisite clear exhaust.  The action of the gear is as follows: A rod, a, is fixed by a pin at b, on  which it is free to turn, and is attached to a rod, c, at d, the other end  of which link is fastened to the connecting rod at e. At the point, f, in  this rod another lever, g, is connected to it, the upper end of which is  coupled to the valve rod, h, at i, and just below this point a second  connection is made to a block at j, sliding in a short curved piece, k.  The inclination of the block, k, governs the travel of the valve. The  total weight of the engine in working order is: On the leading wheels, 10  tons 8 cwt.; front drivers, 14 tons 4 cwt.; rear drivers, 13 tons 10 cwt.;  total, 37.75 tons. The tender weighs 25 tons in full working order. The  boiler pressure is 150 lb., and the usual point of cut-off in the high  pressure cylinders, when running at speed, is half-stroke, while the  pressure of steam admitted to the large cylinder is never to exceed 75 lb.  per square inch. The average consumption of coal between London and Crewe  is 26.6 lb. per train mile, or about 8 lb. per mile less than the standard  coupled engine. In an experiment made in October, 1883, one of these  engines took the Scotch express from Euston to Carlisle at an average  speed, between stations, of 44 miles an hour, the engine, tender, and  train weighing 230 tons, with a consumption of 291/2 lb. of coal per mile,  and an evaporation of 8.5 lb. of water per pound of fuel.    Mr. Webb's object, in designing this engine was to secure in the first  place a greater economy of fuel, and secondly, to do away with coupling  rods, while at the same time obtaining greater adhesion, with the freedom  of a single engine. The cost is much more than an ordinary locomotive, but  the saving in fuel is said to be 20 per cent. over the other engines of  the North Western Rail way. These engines run very sweetly, and are said  to steam freely, although with only half the usual number of blasts; but  from the small size of the high pressure cylinders, they are liable to  slip when starting heavy trains, as the low pressure cylinders are not  then effective, while the consumption of coal does not seem to show the  saving that would have been expected, when compared with ordinary engines  doing similar duty on other lines; for instance, the Great Northern single  engine takes trains of the same weight with the same consumption of coal  and at a somewhat higher speed. But it must, of course, be borne in mind  in making such a comparison, that the fuel used may not be of the same  quality.    Mr. Stirling, of the Great Northern, has adopted an entirely different  type of engine to those last described. Holding strongly that single  engines are more economical not only in running, but in repairs, and that  cylinder power is generally inadequate to the adhesion, he has designed  his magnificent well-known class of express engines. They have single  driving wheels 8 ft. in diameter, with a four-wheel bogie in front and a  pair of trailing wheels, 4 ft. diameter, behind. The frames are single,  and inside of one solid piece; the cylinders are outside 18 in. diameter  and 28 in. stroke; and the valve gear is of the usual shifting link  description. The boiler is of Yorkshire plates, 11 ft. 5 in. long and 4  ft. diameter, and the steam pressure is 140 lb.; while the tractive power  per lb. of steam in the cylinders is 94 lb. The fire-box is of copper, and  the roof is stayed to the outer shell by wrought iron radiating stays  screwed into both; a sloping mid-feather is placed in the fire-box.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY.]    The tubes, 217 in number, are of brass, 1-9/16 in. diameter; and the  heating surface is in the tubes, 1,043 square feet; fire-box, 122 square  feet; total, 1,165 square feet. The fire-grate area is 17.6 square feet.  The wheel base from the center of the bogie pin to the trailing axle is 19  ft. 5 in., and the weight in working order is, on the bogie wheels, 15  tons; driving wheels, 15 tons; trailing wheels, 8 tons; total, 38 tons.  The tender weighs 27 tons. These engines are remarkable for their  efficiency; the traffic of the Great Northern Railway is exceedingly  heavy, and the trains run at a high rate, the average speed of the Flying  Scotchman being fifty miles an hour, and no train in the kingdom keeps  better time. \"Those who remember this express at York in the icy winter of  1879-80, when the few travelers who did not remain thawing themselves at  the waiting-room fires used to stamp up and down a sawdusted platform,  under a darkened roof, while day after day the train came gliding in from  Grantham with couplings like wool, icicles pendent from the carriage  eaves, and an air of punctual unconcern; or those who have known some of  our other equally sterling trains--these will hardly mind if friendship  does let them drift into exaggeration when speaking of expresses.\" The  author well remembers how, when living some years ago at  Newcastle-on-Tyne, it was often his custom to stroll on the platform of  the Central Station to watch the arrival of the Flying Scotchman, and as  the hands of the station clock marked seven minutes past four he would  turn around, and in nine cases out of ten the express was gliding into the  station, punctual to the minute after its run of 272 miles. Such results  speak for themselves, and for the power of the engines employed, and one  of the best runs on record was that of the special train, drawn by one of  these locomotives, which in 1880 took the Lord Mayor of London, to  Scarborough. The train consisted of six Great Northern coaches, and ran  the 188 miles to York in 217 minutes, including a stop of ten minutes at  Grantham, or at the average rate of 541/2 miles an hour. The speed from  Grantham to York, 821/2 miles, with three slowing downs at Retford,  Doncaster, and Selby, averaged 57 miles an hour, and the 59 miles from  Claypole, near Newark, to Selby, were run in 601/2 minutes, and for 221/2  consecutive miles the speed was 64 miles an hour. In ordinary working  these engines convey trains of sixteen to twenty-six coaches from  King's-Cross with ease, and often twenty-eight are taken and time kept.  Considering that the Great Northern main line rises almost continuously to  Potter's Bar, 13 miles, with gradients varying from 1 in 105 to 1 in 200,  this is a very high duty, while, with regard to speed, they have run with  sixteen coaches for 15 miles at the rate of 75 miles an hour. Their  consumption of coal with trains averaging sixteen ten ton carriages is 27  lb. per mile, or 8 lb. per mile less than the standard coupled engine of  the North-Western with similar loads.
