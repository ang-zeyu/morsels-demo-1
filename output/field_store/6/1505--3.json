JS        PREFACE    The history of the naval events of the War of 1812 has been repeatedly  presented both to the American and the English reader. Historical  writers have treated it either in connection with a general account of  the contest on land and sea, or as forming a part of the complete record  of the navies of the two nations. A few monographs, which confine  themselves strictly to the naval occurrences, have also appeared. But  none of these works can be regarded as giving a satisfactorily full or  impartial account of the war--some of them being of he \"popular\" and  loosely-constructed order, while others treat it from a purely partisan  standpoint. No single book can be quoted which would be accepted by the  modern reader as doing justice to both sides, or, indeed, as telling  the whole story. Any one specially interested in the subject must read  all; and then it will seem almost a hopeless task to reconcile the  many and widely contradictory statements he will meet with.    There appear to be three works which, taken in combination, give the  best satisfaction on the subject. First, in James' \"Naval History of  Great Britain\" (which supplies both the material and the opinions of  almost every subsequent English or Canadian historian) can be found  the British view of the case. It is an invaluable work, written with  fulness and care; on the other hand it is also a piece of special  pleading by a bitter and not over-scrupulous partisan. This, in the  second place, can be partially supplemented by Fenimore Cooper's  \"Naval History of the United States.\" The latter gives the American  view of the cruises and battles; but it is much less of an authority  than James', both because it is written without great regard for  exactness, and because all figures for the American side need to be  supplied from Lieutenant (now Admiral) George E. Emmons' statistical  \"History of the United States Navy,\" which is the third of the works  in question.    But even after comparing these three authors, many contradictions  remain unexplained, and the truth can only be reached in such cases  by a careful examination of the navy \"Records,\" the London \"Naval  Chronicle,\" \"Niles' Register,\" and other similar documentary  publications. Almost the only good criticisms on the actions are  those incidentally given in standard works on other subjects, such as  Lord Howard Douglass' \"Naval Gunnery,\" and Admiral Jurien de la  Gravière's \"Guerres Maritimes.\" Much of the material in our Navy  Department has never been touched at all. In short, no full, accurate,  and unprejudiced history of the war has ever been written.    The subject merits a closer scrutiny than it has received. At present  people are beginning to realize that it is folly for the great  English-speaking Republic to rely for defence upon a navy composed  partly of antiquated hulks, and partly of new vessels rather more  worthless than the old. It is worth while to study with some care  that period of our history during which our navy stood at the highest  pitch of its fame; and to learn any thing from the past it is necessary  to know, as near as may be, the exact truth. Accordingly the work  should be written impartially, if only from the narrowest motives.  Without abating a jot from one's devotion to his country and flag,  I think a history can be made just enough to warrant its being  received as an authority equally among Americans and Englishmen. I  have endeavored to supply such a work. It is impossible that errors,  both of fact and opinion, should not have crept into it; and  although I have sought to make it in character as non-partisan as  possible, these errors will probably be in favor of the American  side.    As my only object is to give an accurate narrative of events, I shall  esteem it a particular favor if any one will furnish me with the  means of rectifying such mistakes; and if I have done injustice to  any commander, or officer of any grade, whether American or British,  I shall consider myself under great obligations to those who will set  me right.    I have been unable to get access to the original reports of the  British commanders, the logs of the British ships, or their  muster-rolls, and so have been obliged to take them at second hand  from the \"Gazette,\" or \"Naval Chronicle,\" or some standard history.  The American official letters, log-books, original contracts,  muster-rolls, etc., however, being preserved in the Archives at  Washington, I have been able, thanks to the courtesy of the Hon.  Wm. H. Hunt, Secretary of the Navy, to look them over. The set of  letters from the officers is very complete, in three series,--\"Captains'  Letters,\" \"Masters' Commandant Letters,\" and \"Officers' Letters,\"  there being several volumes for each year. The books of contracts  contain valuable information as to the size and build of some of  the vessels. The log-books are rather exasperating, often being very  incomplete. Thus when I turned from Decatur's extremely vague  official letter describing the capture of the Macedonian to the  log-book of the Frigate _United States_, not a fact about the fight  could be gleaned. The last entry in the log on the day of the fight  is \"strange sail discovered to be a frigate under English colors,\"  and the next entry (on the following day) relates to the removal  of the prisoners. The log of the _Enterprise_ is very full indeed,  for most of the time, but is a perfect blank for the period during  which she was commanded by Lieutenant Burrows, and in which she  fought the Boxer. I have not been able to find the Peacock's log  at all, though there is a very full set of letters from her commander.  Probably the fire of 1837 destroyed a great deal of valuable material.  When ever it was possible I have referred to printed matter in  preference to manuscript, and my authorities can thus, in most cases,  be easily consulted. In conclusion I desire to express my sincerest  thanks to Captain James D. Bulloch, formerly of the United States  Navy, and Commander Adolf Mensing, formerly of the German Navy,  without whose advice and sympathy this work would probably never  have been written or even begun.    NEW YORK CITY, 1882.        PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION    I originally intended to write a companion volume to this, which  should deal with the operations on land. But a short examination  showed that these operations were hardly worth serious study.  They teach nothing new; it is the old, old lesson, that a miserly  economy in preparation may in the end involve a lavish outlay of  men and money, which, after all, comes too late to more than partially  offset the evils produced by the original short-sighted parsimony.  This might be a lesson worth dwelling on did it have any practical  bearing on the issues of the present day; but it has none, as far  as the army is concerned. It was criminal folly for Jefferson, and  his follower Madison, to neglect to give us a force either of regulars  or of well-trained volunteers during the twelve years they had in  which to prepare for the struggle that any one might see was  inevitable; but there is now far less need of an army than there was  then. Circumstances have altered widely since 1812. Instead of the  decaying might of Spain on our southern frontier, we have the still  weaker power of Mexico. Instead of the great Indian nations of the  interior, able to keep civilization at bay, to hold in check strong  armies, to ravage large stretches of territory, and needing  formidable military expeditions to overcome them, there are now only  left broken and scattered bands, which are sources of annoyance  merely. To the north we are still hemmed in by the Canadian  possessions of Great Britain; but since 1812 our strength has  increased so prodigiously, both absolutely and relatively, while  England's military power has remained almost stationary, that we  need now be under no apprehensions from her land-forces; for, even  if checked in the beginning, we could not help conquering in the  end by sheer weight of numbers, if by nothing else. So that there  is now no cause for our keeping up a large army; while, on the  contrary, the necessity for an efficient navy is so evident that  only our almost incredible short-sightedn"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/917"],[0,"Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty (#1)"],[1,"RUDGE    A TALE OF THE RIOTS OF 'EIGHTY      by Charles Dickens        Contibutor's Note:    I've left in archaic forms such as 'to-morrow' or 'to-day' as they  occured in my copy.

PREFACE      The late Mr Waterton having, some time ago, expressed his opinion that  ravens are gradually becoming extinct in England, I offered the few  following words about my experience of these birds.    The raven in this story is a compound of two great originals, of whom I  was, at different times, the proud possessor. The first was in the bloom  of his youth, when he was discovered in a modest retirement in London,  by a friend of mine, and given to me. He had from the first, as Sir Hugh  Evans says of Anne Page, 'good gifts', which he improved by study and  attention in a most exemplary manner. He slept in a stable--generally  on horseback--and so terrified a Newfoundland dog by his preternatural  sagacity, that he has been known, by the mere superiority of his genius,  to walk off unmolested with the dog's dinner, from before his face. He  was rapidly rising in acquirements and virtues, when, in an evil hour,  his stable was newly painted. He observed the workmen closely, saw that  they were careful of the paint, and immediately burned to possess it. On  their going to dinner, he ate up all they had left behind, consisting of  a pound or two of white lead; and this youthful indiscretion terminated  in death.    While I was yet inconsolable for his loss, another friend of mine  in Yorkshire discovered an older and more gifted raven at a village  public-house, which he prevailed upon the landlord to part with for a  consideration, and sent up to me. The first act of this Sage, was, to  administer to the effects of his predecessor, by disinterring all the  cheese and halfpence he had buried in the garden--a work of immense  labour and research, to which he devoted all the energies of his mind.  When he had achieved this task, he applied himself to the acquisition  of stable language, in which he soon became such an adept, that he would  perch outside my window and drive imaginary horses with great skill,  all day. Perhaps even I never saw him at his best, for his former master  sent his duty with him, 'and if I wished the bird to come out very  strong, would I be so good as to show him a drunken man'--which I never  did, having (unfortunately) none but sober people at hand.    But I could hardly have respected him more, whatever the stimulating  influences of this sight might have been. He had not the least respect,  I am sorry to say, for me in return, or for anybody but the cook; to  whom he was attached--but only, I fear, as a Policeman might have been.  Once, I met him unexpectedly, about half-a-mile from my house, walking  down the middle of a public street, attended by a pretty large crowd,  and spontaneously exhibiting the whole of his accomplishments. His  gravity under those trying circumstances, I can never forget, nor the  extraordinary gallantry with which, refusing to be brought home, he  defended himself behind a pump, until overpowered by numbers. It may  have been that he was too bright a genius to live long, or it may have  been that he took some pernicious substance into his bill, and thence  into his maw--which is not improbable, seeing that he new-pointed  the greater part of the garden-wall by digging out the mortar, broke  countless squares of glass by scraping away the putty all round the  frames, and tore up and swallowed, in splinters, the greater part of a  wooden staircase of six steps and a landing--but after some three years  he too was taken ill, and died before the kitchen fire. He kept his eye  to the last upon the meat as it roasted, and suddenly turned over  on his back with a sepulchral cry of 'Cuckoo!' Since then I have been  ravenless.    No account of the Gordon Riots having been to my knowledge introduced  into any Work of Fiction, and the subject presenting very extraordinary  and remarkable features, I was led to project this Tale.    It is unnecessary to say, that those shameful tumults, while they  reflect indelible disgrace upon the time in which they occurred, and all  who had act or part in them, teach a good lesson. That what we falsely  call a religious cry is easily raised by men who have no religion, and  who in their daily practice set at nought the commonest principles of  right and wrong; that it is begotten of intolerance and persecution;  that it is senseless, besotted, inveterate and unmerciful; all History  teaches us. But perhaps we do not know it in our hearts too well,  to profit by even so humble an example as the 'No Popery' riots of  Seventeen Hundred and Eighty.    However imperfectly those disturbances are set forth in the following  pages, they are impartially painted by one who has no sympathy with the  Romish Church, though he acknowledges, as most men do, some esteemed  friends among the followers of its creed.    In the description of the principal outrages, reference has been had to  the best authorities of that time, such as they are; the account given  in this Tale, of all the main features of the Riots, is substantially  correct.    Mr Dennis's allusions to the flourishing condition of his trade in those  days, have their foundation in Truth, and not in the Author's fancy. Any  file of old Newspapers, or odd volume of the Annual Register, will prove  this with terrible ease.    Even the case of Mary Jones, dwelt upon with so much pleasure by the  same character, is no effort of invention. The facts were stated,  exactly as they are stated here, in the House of Commons. Whether they  afforded as much entertainment to the merry gentlemen assembled there,  as some other most affecting circumstances of a similar nature mentioned  by Sir Samuel Romilly, is not recorded.    That the case of Mary Jones may speak the more emphatically for  itself, I subjoin it, as related by SIR WILLIAM MEREDITH in a speech in  Parliament, 'on Frequent Executions', made in 1777.    'Under this act,' the Shop-lifting Act, 'one Mary Jones was executed,  whose case I shall just mention; it was at the time when press warrants  were issued, on the alarm about Falkland Islands. The woman's husband  was pressed, their goods seized for some debts of his, and she, with two  small children, turned into the streets a-begging. It is a circumstance  not to be forgotten, that she was very young (under nineteen), and most  remarkably handsome. She went to a linen-draper's shop, took some coarse  linen off the counter, and slipped it under her cloak; the shopman saw  her, and she laid it down: for this she was hanged. Her defence was (I  have the trial in my pocket), \"that she had lived in credit, and wanted  for nothing, till a press-gang came and stole her husband from her; but  since then, she had no bed to lie on; nothing to give her children  to eat; and they were almost naked; and perhaps she might have done  something wrong, for she hardly knew what she did.\" The parish officers  testified the truth of this story; but it seems, there had been a good  deal of shop-lifting about Ludgate; an example was thought necessary;  and this woman was hanged for the comfort and satisfaction of  shopkeepers in Ludgate Street. When brought to receive sentence,  she behaved in such a frantic manner, as proved her mind to be in a  distracted and desponding state; and the child was sucking at her breast  when she set out for Tyburn.'        Chapter 1      In the year 1775, there stood upon the borders of Epping Forest, at a  distance of about twelve miles from London--measuring from the Standard  in Cornhill, or rather from the spot on or near to which the Standard  used to be in days of yore--a house of public entertainment called the  Maypole; which fact was demonstrated to all such travellers as  could neither read nor write (and at that time a vast number both of  travellers and stay-at-homes were in this condition) by the emblem  reared on the roadside over against the house, which, if not of those  goodly proportions that Maypoles were wont to present in olden times,  was a fair young ash, thirty feet in height, and straight as any arrow  that ever English yeoman drew.    The Maypole--by which term from henceforth is meant the house, and not  its sign--the Maypole was an old building, with more gable ends than a  lazy man would care to count on a sunny day; huge zig-zag chimneys, out  of which it seemed as though even smoke could not choose but come in  more than naturally fantastic shapes, imparted to it in its tortuous  progress; and vast stables, gloomy, ruinous, and empty. The place was  said to have been built in the days of King Henry the Eighth; and there  was a legend, not only that Queen Elizabeth had slept there one night  while upon a hunting excursion, to wit, in a certain oak-panelled room  with a deep bay window, but that next morning, while standing on a  mounting block before the door with one foot in the stirrup, the virgin  monarch had then and there boxed and cuffed an unlucky page for some  neglect of duty. The matter-of-fact and doubtful folks, of whom there  were a few among the Maypole customers, as unluckily there always are  in every little community, were inclined to look upon this tradition as  rather apocryphal; but, whenever the landlord of that ancient hostelry  appealed to the mounting block itself as evidence, and triumphantly  pointed out that there it stood in the same place to that very day, the  doubters never failed to be put down by a large majority, and all true  believers exulted as in a victory.    Whether these, and many other stories of the like nature, were true or  untrue, the Maypole was really an old house, a very old house, perhaps  as old as it claimed to be, and perhaps older, which"]]]
