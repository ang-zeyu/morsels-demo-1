James and family,          and    Miss Sarah E. Campbell,    this volume is affectionately inscribed          PREFACE      It has been the aim of the author: to combine a detailed narrative of her  trip by water to the White City with a faithful description of the ever  memorable Columbian Exposition as far as possible consistent with the  scope of this work. Every opportunity has been embraced by the writer to  incorporate the historical events, scientific facts, and natural phenomena  most appropriate to the subject.    The author also acknowledges her indebtedness to the Lake Shore & Michigan  Southern Railway Co. as well as her obligations to the Winters Art Litho  Co. in Chicago. She wishes to express her gratitude to the first-mentioned  corporation for having presented her with a map illustrative of the route;  thus enabling the reader to trace the numerous towns and cities--on the  Erie Canal and three Great Lakes--whose history and attractions have been  depicted in this book.    The Lake Shore Route--selected by the Government to run the famous Fast  Mail Trains--is the only double track line between Chicago, Cleveland,  Buffalo, New York, and Boston.--During the existence of the White City,  the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway Co. placed in service special  trains for the purpose of facilitating railway transportation between the  eastern cities and the \"Queen of the West.\" The \"Exposition Flyer,\" which  accomplished nearly 1,000 miles in twenty hours from Chicago to New York,  an average of about fifty miles per hour, was certainly one of the fastest  trains in the World.    To the aid of the Winters Art Litho Co. the author owes her capability of  furnishing this volume with a novel illustration of the World's Fair.--A  gold medal was awarded to this firm for the excellence in their water  color fac-simile reproductions and advancement in legitimate lithography.  The credit of improvements in materially reducing the number of printings,  and still maintaining excellence in results, was conceded to them by the  Judges.--This company kindly permitted the author to use their copyright  of the revised and most correct Bird's Eye View of the Exposition Grounds  extant, which gives the readers a very adequate conception of that  marvelous creation that--while existing only for such a brief period--has  accomplished its mission in the highest degree, and has opened a new era  in the annals of modern progress.

The  grandest scenes can be fully enjoyed and duly appreciated when viewed  through an atmosphere of physical comfort. Thus, in order to demonstrate  the accuracy of the assertion:        Voyaging with Mr. James and his family was      attractive and enjoyable to me in every respect,    I must make the reader acquainted with my amiable traveling companions, as  well as with their floating home, the beautiful steam yacht \"Marguerite.\"    Her owner, _Captain S. R. James_, is a stately, fine-looking, accomplished  gentleman, and quite a linguist. To me it was a source of unusual pleasure  to discuss French and German literature occasionally during our voyage  with one who has given so much attention to these languages.    Mr. James was styled by the Buffalo Courier \"a typical New Yorker;\" but he  impresses me more as a typified English gentleman of the thorough school,  and this impression is confirmed as I reflect upon his conduct to those  fortunate enough to be associated with him in any capacity.    I trust the reader will pardon me if I warmly eulogize MR. JAMES, his  lovely WIFE and their FOUR sweet CHILDREN, together with Miss SARAH E.  CAMPBELL, the very amiable sister of Mrs. James--who were my traveling  companions on this eventful trip; for, certainly, I was extremely  fortunate in my _compagnons de voyage_, whom I have thus introduced to the  reader. They abandoned their lovely home for the purpose of undertaking  the gigantic enterprise of making a canal and lake voyage to the White  City.    The reader may well judge that sailing on a yacht presents innumerable  novelties and advantages not attainable by any other conveyance. Since the  parties on board a pleasure-boat concentrate all their thoughts to the  expected enjoyments they cast aside all irksome forms and strait-laced  habitudes, delivering themselves up to the free air to live less  conventionally than at home. The preferableness of such an existence,  freed from all unnecessary ceremonies, is still more perceptible when the  trip is of long duration and having, moreover, for its terminus the  World's Columbian Exposition, a place where the wonders, beauties, and  evidences of nature's power and man's skill are gathered from all lands.    The great anticipations we had of our unique voyage were justified in  every respect. For it offered us the opportunity to store our memories  with that which will never die, and to adorn them with pictures whose  colors will never fade.    All this will be revealed subsequently to my courteous reader, who is  cordially invited to follow me now on board the steam yacht, which formed  our home for six eventful weeks.    What first strikes the observer on approaching the \"Marguerite,\" are the  graceful lines which run from the sharp, slightly bent stem to the  well-rounded stern. So beautiful is her form, and so majestically does she  rest upon the water, that you will have no difficulty to recognize her,  even at a great distance. You observe that she is painted with taste, and  all the mouldings are gilded; you also perceive that the railings are of  oak wood, surmounted by finely polished brass, and the deck of narrow deal  planks is as white as snow. There is nothing wanting to make her equipment  harmonize with the requirements of the present era. She has a length of a  hundred feet, a width of about fifteen, with a draught of five feet eight  inches; being fitted out for both steam and sail navigation.    Now, dear reader, let us go below. If you consent, we will first visit the  engine-room, since it contains the most essential part of the working  machinery.

Wallis Budge    London, 1912            [Editorial note: Throughout the text \"####\" represents images which                   cannot be transcribed.]          PREFACE      The welcome which has been accorded to the volumes of this Series, and  the fact that some of them have passed into second and third editions,  suggest that these little books have been found useful by beginners in  Egyptology and others.  Hitherto the object of them has been to supply  information about the Religion, Magic, Language, and History of the  ancient Egyptians, and to provide editions of the original texts from  which such information was derived.  There are, however, many branches  of Egyptology which need treatment in a similar manner in this Series,  and it has been suggested in many quarters that the time has now  arrived when the publication of a series of groups of texts  illustrating Egyptian Literature in general might well be begun.  Seeing that nothing is known about the authors of Egyptian works, not  even their names, it is impossible to write a History of Egyptian  Literature in the ordinary sense of the word.  The only thing to be  done is to print the actual works in the best and most complete form  possible, with translations, and then to put them in the hands of the  reader and leave them to his judgment.    With this object in view, it has been decided to publish in the Series  several volumes which shall be devoted to the reproduction in  hieroglyphic type of the best and most typical examples of the various  kinds of Egyptian Literature, with English translations, on a much  larger scale than was possible in my \"First Steps in Egyptian\" or in my  \"Egyptian Reading Book.\"  These volumes are intended to serve a double  purpose, i.e., to supply the beginner in Egyptian with new material and  a series of reading books, and to provide the general reader with  translations of Egyptian works in a handy form.    The Egyptian texts, whether the originals be written in hieroglyphic or  hieratic characters, are here printed in hieroglyphic type, and are  arranged with English translations, page for page.  They are printed as  they are written in the original documents, i.e., the words are not  divided.  The beginner will find the practice of dividing the words for  himself most useful in acquiring facility of reading and understanding  the language.  The translations are as literal as can reasonably be  expected, and, as a whole, I believe that they mean what the original  writers intended to say.  In the case of passages where the text is  corrupt, and readings are mixed, or where very rare words occur, or  where words are omitted, the renderings given claim to be nothing more  than suggestions as to their meanings.  It must be remembered that the  exact meanings of many Egyptian words have still to be ascertained, and  that the ancient Egyptian scribes were as much puzzled as we are by  some of the texts which they copied, and that owing to carelessness,  ignorance, or weariness, or all three, they made blunders which the  modern student is unable to correct.  In the Introduction will be found  brief descriptions of the contents of the Egyptian texts, in which  their general bearing and importance are indicated, and references  given to authoritative editions of texts and translations.

The text of the remarkable Legend of the Creation which forms the first  section of this volume is preserved in a well-written papyrus in the  British Museum, where it bears the number 10,188.  This papyrus was  acquired by the late Mr. A. H. Rhind in 1861 or 1862, when he was  excavating some tombs on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes.  He did  not himself find it in a tomb, but he received it from the British  Consul at Luxor, Mustafa Agha, during an interchange of gifts when Mr.  Rhind was leaving the country.  Mustafa Agha obtained the papyrus from  the famous hiding-place of the Royal Mummies at Der-al-Bahari, with the  situation of which he was well acquainted for many years before it  became known to the Egyptian Service of Antiquities.  When Mr. Rhind  came to England, the results of his excavations were examined by Dr.  Birch, who, recognising the great value of the papyrus, arranged to  publish it in a companion volume to Facsimiles of Two Papyri, but the  death of Mr. Rhind in 1865 caused the project to fall through.  Mr.  Rhind's collection passed into the hands of Mr. David Bremner, and the  papyrus, together with many other antiquities, was purchased by the  Trustees of the British Museum. In 1880 Dr. Birch suggested the  publication of the papyrus to Dr. Pleyte, the Director of the Egyptian  Museum at Leyden.  This savant transcribed and translated some passages  from the Festival Songs of Isis and Nephthys, which is the first text  in it, and these he published in Recueil de Travaux, Paris, tom. iii.,  pp. 57-64.  In 1886 by Dr. Birch's kindness I was allowed to work at  the papyrus, and I published transcripts of some important passages and  the account of the Creation in the Proceedings of the Society of  Biblical Archaeology, 1886-7, pp. 11-26.  The Legend of the Creation  was considered by Dr. H. Brugsch to be of considerable value for the  study of the Egyptian Religion, and encouraged by him[FN#1] I made a  full transcript of the papyrus, which was published in Archaeologia,  (vol. lii., London, 1891), with transliterations and translations.  In  1910 I edited for the Trustees of the British Museum the complete  hieratic text with a revised translation.[FN#2]        [FN#1]  Ein in moglichst wortgetreuer Uebersetzung vorglegter Papyrus-  text soll den Schlussstein meines Werkes bilden.  Er wird den Beweis  fur die Richtigkeit meiner eigenen Untersuchungen vollenden, indem er  das wichtigste Zeugniss altagyptischen Ursprungs den zahlreichen, von  mir angezogenen Stellen aus den Inschriften hinzufugt.  Trotz mancher  Schwierigkeit im Einzelnen ist der Gesammtinhalt des Textes, den zuerst  ein englischer Gelehrter der Wissenschaft zuganglich gemacht hat, such  nicht im geringsten misszuverstehen (Brugsch, Religion, p. 740).  He  gives a German translation of the Creation Legend on pp. 740, 741, and  a transliteration on p. 756.    [FN#2]  Egyptian Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum, London, 1910,  folio.        The papyrus is about 16 ft. 8 in. in length, and is 9 1/4 in. in width.  It contains 21 columns of hieratic text which are written in short  lines and are poetical in character, and 12 columns or pages of text  written in long lines; the total number of lines is between 930 and  940.  The text is written in a small, very black, but neat hand, and  may be assigned to a time between the XXVIth Dynasty and the Ptolemaic  Period.  The titles, catch-words, rubrics, names of Apep and his  fiends, and a few other words, are written in red ink.  There are two  colophons; in the one we have a date, namely, the \"first day of the  fourth month of the twelfth year of Pharaoh Alexander, the son of  Alexander,\" i.e., B.C. 311, and in the other the name of the priest who  either had the papyrus written, or appropriated it, namely, Nes-Menu,  or Nes-Amsu.    The Legend of the Creation is found in the third work which is given in  the papyrus, and which is called the \"Book of overthrowing Apep, the  Enemy of Ra, the Enemy of Un-Nefer\" (i.e., Osiris).  This work  contained a series of spells which were recited during the performance  of certain prescribed ceremonies, with the object of preventing storms,  and dispersing rain-clouds, and removing any obstacle, animate or  inanimate, which could prevent the rising of the sun in the morning, or  obscure his light during the day.  The Leader-in Chief of the hosts of  darkness was a fiend called Apep who appeared in the sky in the form of  a monster serpent, and, marshalling all the fiends of the Tuat,  attempted to keep the Sun-god imprisoned in the kingdom of darkness.  Right in the midst of the spells which were directed against Apep we  find inserted the legend of the Creation, which occurs in no other  known Egyptian document (Col. XXVI., l. 21, to Col. XXVII., l. 6).  Curiously enough a longer version of the legend is given a little  farther on (Col."]]]
