The priests of the temple, when they saw what had happened,  wondered greatly and were astonished at the loving faithfulness of  this beautiful girl, and taking compassion on her, they laid her side  by side with Gompachi in one grave, and over the grave they placed a  stone which remains to this day, bearing the inscription \"The Tomb of  the Shiyoku.\" And still the people of Yedo visit the place, and still  they praise the beauty of Gompachi and the filial piety and fidelity  of Komurasaki.    Let us linger for a moment longer in the old graveyard. The word which  I have translated a few lines above as \"loving faithfulness\" means  literally \"chastity.\" When Komurasaki sold herself to supply the wants  of her ruined parents, she was not, according to her lights,  forfeiting her claim to virtue. On the contrary, she could perform no  greater act of filial piety, and, so far from incurring reproach among  her people, her self-sacrifice would be worthy of all praise in their  eyes. This idea has led to grave misunderstanding abroad, and indeed  no phase of Japanese life has been so misrepresented as this. I have  heard it stated, and seen it printed, that it is no disgrace for a  respectable Japanese to sell his daughter, that men of position and  family often choose their wives from such places as \"The Three  Sea-coasts,\" and that up to the time of her marriage the conduct of a  young girl is a matter of no importance whatever. Nothing could be  more unjust or more untrue. It is only the neediest people that sell  their children to be waitresses, singers, or prostitutes. It does  occasionally happen that the daughter of a _Samurai_, or gentleman, is  found in a house of ill-fame, but such a case could only occur at the  death or utter ruin of the parents, and an official investigation of  the matter has proved it to be so exceptional, that the presence of a  young lady in such a place is an enormous attraction, her superior  education and accomplishments shedding a lustre over the house. As for  gentlemen marrying women of bad character, are not such things known  in Europe? Do ladies of the _demi-monde_ never make good marriages?  _Mesalliances_ are far rarer in Japan than with us. Certainly among  the lowest class of the population such, marriages may occasionally  occur, for it often happens that a woman can lay by a tempting dowry  out of her wretched earnings-, but amongst the gentry of the country  they are unknown.    And yet a girl is not disgraced if for her parents' sake she sells  herself to a life of misery so great, that, when a Japanese enters a  house of ill-fame, he is forced to leave his sword and dirk at the  door for two reasons--first, to prevent brawling; secondly, because it  is known that some of the women inside so loathe their existence that  they would put an end to it, could they get hold of a weapon.    It is a curious fact that in all the Daimio's castle-towns, with the  exception of some which are also seaports, open prostitution is  strictly forbidden, although, if report speaks truly, public morality  rather suffers than gains by the prohibition.    The misapprehension which exists upon the subject of prostitution in  Japan may be accounted for by the fact that foreign writers, basing  their judgment upon the vice of the open ports, have not hesitated to  pronounce the Japanese women unchaste. As fairly might a Japanese,  writing about England, argue from the street-walkers of Portsmouth or  Plymouth to the wives, sisters, and daughters of these very authors.  In some respects the gulf fixed between virtue and vice in Japan is  even greater than in England. The Eastern courtesan is confined to a  certain quarter of the town, and distinguished by a peculiarly gaudy  costume, and by a head-dress which consists of a forest of light  tortoiseshell hair-pins, stuck round her head like a saint's glory--a  glory of shame which a modest woman would sooner die than wear. Vice  jostling virtue in the public places; virtue imitating the fashions  set by vice, and buying trinkets or furniture at the sale of vice's  effects--these are social phenomena which the East knows not.    The custom prevalent among the lower orders of bathing in public  bath-houses without distinction of the sexes, is another circumstance  which has tended to spread abroad very false notions upon the subject  of the chastity of the Japanese women. Every traveller is shocked by  it, and every writer finds in it matter for a page of pungent  description. Yet it is only those who are so poor (and they must be  poor indeed) that they cannot afford a bath at home, who, at the end  of their day's work, go to the public bath-house to refresh themselves  before sitting down to their evening meal: having been used to the  scene from their childhood, they see no indelicacy in it; it is a  matter of course, and _honi soit qui mal y pense_: certainly there is  far less indecency and immorality resulting from this public bathing,  than from the promiscuous herding together of all sexes and ages which  disgraces our own lodging-houses in the great cities, and the hideous  hovels in which some of our labourers have to pass their lives; nor  can it be said that there is more confusion of sexes amongst the  lowest orders in Japan than in Europe. Speaking upon the subject once  with a Japanese gentleman, I observed that we considered it an act of  indecency for men and women to wash together. He shrugged his  shoulders as he answered, \"But then Westerns have such prurient  minds.\" Some time ago, at the open port of Yokohama, the Government,  out of deference to the prejudices of foreigners, forbade the men and  women to bathe together, and no doubt this was the first step towards  putting down the practice altogether: as for women tubbing in the open  streets of Yedo, I have read of such things in books written by  foreigners; but during a residence of three years and a half, in which  time I crossed and recrossed every part of the great city at all hours  of the day, I never once saw such a sight. I believe myself that it  can only be seen at certain hot mineral springs in remote country  districts.    The best answer to the general charge of immorality which has been  brought against the Japanese women during their period of unmarried  life, lies in the fact that every man who can afford to do so keeps  the maidens of his family closely guarded in the strictest seclusion.  The daughter of poverty, indeed, must work and go abroad, but not a  man is allowed to approach the daughter of a gentleman; and she is  taught that if by accident any insult should be offered to her, the  knife which she carries at her girdle is meant for use, and not  merely as a badge of her rank. Not long ago a tragedy took place in  the house of one of the chief nobles in Yedo. One of My Lady's  tire-women, herself a damsel of gentle blood, and gifted with rare  beauty, had attracted the attention of a retainer in the palace, who  fell desperately in love with her. For a long time the strict rules of  decorum by which she was hedged in prevented him from declaring his  passion; but at last he contrived to gain access to her presence, and  so far forgot himself, that she, drawing her poniard, stabbed him in  the eye, so that he was carried off fainting, and presently died. The  girl's declaration, that the dead man had attempted to insult her, was  held to be sufficient justification of her deed, and, instead of being  blamed, she was praised and extolled for her valour and chastity. As  the affair had taken place within the four walls of a powerful noble,  there was no official investigation into the matter, with which the  authorities of the palace were competent to deal. The truth of this  story was vouched for by two or three persons whose word I have no  reason to doubt, and who had themselves been mixed up in it; I can  bear witness that it is in complete harmony with Japanese ideas; and  certainly it seems more just that Lucretia should kill Tarquin than  herself.    The better the Japanese people come to be known and understood, the  more, I am certain, will it be felt that a great injustice has been  done them in the sweeping attacks which have been made upon their  women. Writers are agreed, I believe, that their matrons are, as a  rule, without reproach. If their maidens are chaste, as I contend that  from very force of circumstances they cannot help being, what becomes  of all these charges of vice and immodesty? Do they not rather recoil  upon the accusers, who would appear to have studied the Japanese woman  only in the harlot of Yokohama?    Having said so much, I will now try to give some account of the famous  Yoshiwara[13] of Yedo, to which frequent allusion will have to be made  in the course of these tales.    [Footnote 13: The name Yoshiwara, which is becoming generic for  \"Flower Districts,\"--_Anglice_, quarters occupied by brothels,--is  sometimes derived from the town Yoshiwara, in Sunshine, because it was  said that the women of that place furnished a large proportion of the  beauties of the Yedo Yoshiwara. The correct derivation is probably  that given below.]    At the end of the sixteenth century the courtesans of Yedo lived in  three special places: these were the street called Koji-machi, in  which dwelt the women who came from Kioto; the Kamakura Street, and a  spot opposite the great bridge, in which last two places lived women  brought from Suruga. Besides these there afterwards came women from  Fushimi and from Nara, who lodged scattered here and there throughout  the town. This appears to have scandalized a certain reformer, named  Shoji Jinyemon, who, in the year 1612, addressed a memorial to the  Government, petitioning that the women who lived in different parts of  the town should be collected in one \"Flower Quarter.\" His petition was  granted in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1302"],[0,"The Enemies of Books (#10)"],[1,"Tomicus, or the \"cutting  printer,\" is a sad enemy of (good) books. Upon this part of our subject,  however, I am debarred entering.    The following is from W. J. Westbrook, Mus. Doe., Cantab., and  represents ravages with which I am personally unacquainted:      \"Dear Blades,--I send you an example of the 'enemy'-mosity of an  ordinary housefly.

IN the first chapter I mentioned bookbinders among the Enemies of Books,  and I tremble to think what a stinging retort might be made if some  irate bibliopegist were to turn the scales on the printer, and place HIM  in the same category. On the sins of printers, and the unnatural neglect  which has often shortened the lives of their typographical progeny, it  is not for me to dilate. There is an old proverb, \"'Tis an ill bird  that befouls its own nest\"; a curious chapter thereupon, with many  modern examples, might nevertheless be written. This I will leave, and  will now only place on record some of the cruelties perpetrated upon  books by the ignorance or carelessness of binders.    Like men, books have a soul and body. With the soul, or literary  portion, we have nothing to do at present; the body, which is the outer  frame or covering, and without which the inner would be unusable, is the  special work of the binder. He, so to speak, begets it; he determines  its form and adornment, he doctors it in disease and decay, and, not  unseldom, dissects it after death. Here, too, as through all Nature, we  find the good and bad running side by side. What a treat it is to  handle a well-bound volume; the leaves lie open fully and freely, as  if tempting you to read on, and you handle them without fear of their  parting from the back. To look at the \"tooling,\" too, is a pleasure, for  careful thought, combined with artistic skill, is everywhere apparent.  You open the cover and find the same loving attention inside that has  been given to the outside, all the workmanship being true and thorough.  Indeed, so conservative is a good binding, that many a worthless book  has had an honoured old age, simply out of respect to its outward  aspect; and many a real treasure has come to a degraded end and  premature death through the unsightliness of its outward case and the  irreparable damage done to it in binding.    The weapon with which the binder deals the most deadly blows to books  is the \"plough,\" the effect of which is to cut away the margins, placing  the print in a false position relatively to the back and head, and often  denuding the work of portions of the very text. This reduction in size  not seldom brings down a handsome folio to the size of quarto, and a  quarto to an octavo.    With the old hand plough a binder required more care and caution to  produce an even edge throughout than with the new cutting machine. If a  careless workman found that he had not ploughed the margin quite square  with the text, he would put it in his press and take off \"another  shaving,\" and sometimes even a third.    Dante, in his \"Inferno,\" deals out to the lost souls various tortures  suited with dramatic fitness to the past crimes of the victims, and  had I to execute judgment on the criminal binders of certain precious  volumes I have seen, where the untouched maiden sheets entrusted to  their care have, by barbarous treatment, lost dignity, beauty and value,  I would collect the paper shavings so ruthlessly shorn off, and roast  the perpetrator of the outrage over their slow combustion. In olden  times, before men had learned to value the relics of our printers, there  was some excuse for the sins of a binder who erred from ignorance which  was general; but in these times, when the historical and antiquarian  value of old books is freely acknowledged, no quarter should be granted  to a careless culprit.    It may be supposed that, from the spread of information, all real danger  from ignorance is past. Not so, good reader; that is a consummation as  yet \"devoutly to be wished.\" Let me relate to you a true bibliographical  anecdote: In 1877, a certain lord, who had succeeded to a fine  collection of old books, promised to send some of the most valuable  (among which were several Caxtons) to the Exhibition at South  Kensington. Thinking their outward appearance too shabby, and not  knowing the danger of his conduct, he decided to have them rebound  in the neighbouring county town. The volumes were soon returned in a  resplendent state, and, it is said, quite to the satisfaction of his  lordship, whose pleasure, however, was sadly damped when a friend  pointed out to him that, although the discoloured edges had all been  ploughed off, and the time-stained blanks, with their fifteenth century  autographs, had been replaced by nice clean fly-leaves, yet, looking at  the result in its lowest aspect only--that of market value--the books  had been damaged to at least the amount of L500; and, moreover,  that caustic remarks would most certainly follow upon their public  exhibition. Those poor injured volumes were never sent.    Some years ago one of the most rare books printed by Machlinia--a thin  folio--was discovered bound in sheep by a country bookbinder, and cut  down to suit the size of some quarto tracts. But do not let us suppose  that country binders are the only culprits. It is not very long since  the discovery of a unique Caxton in one of our largest London libraries.  It was in boards, as originally issued by the fifteenth-century binder,  and a great fuss (very properly) was made over the treasure trove. Of  course, cries the reader, it was kept in its original covers, with  all the interesting associations of its early state untouched? No such  thing! Instead of making a suitable case, in which it could be preserved  just as it was, it was placed in the hands of a well-known London  binder, with the order, \"Whole bind in velvet.\" He did his best, and  the volume now glows luxuriously in its gilt edges and its inappropriate  covering, and, alas! with half-an-inch of its uncut margin taken off all  round. How do I know that? because the clever binder, seeing some MS.  remarks on one of the margins, turned the leaf down to avoid cutting  them off, and that stern witness will always testify, to the observant  reader, the original size of the book. This same binder, on another  occasion, placed a unique fifteenth century Indulgence in warm water,  to separate it from the cover upon which it was pasted, the result being  that, when dry, it was so distorted as to be useless. That man soon  after passed to another world, where, we may hope, his works have not  followed him, and that his merits as a good citizen and an honest man  counterbalanced his de-merits as a binder.    Other similar instances will occur to the memory of many a reader, and  doubtless the same sin will be committed from time to time by certain  binders, who seem to have an ingrained antipathy to rough edges and  large margins, which of course are, in their view, made by Nature as  food for the shaving tub.    De Rome, a celebrated bookbinder of the eighteenth century, who was  nicknamed by Dibdin \"The Great Cropper,\" was, although in private life  an estimable man, much addicted to the vice of reducing the margins of  all books sent to him to bind. So far did he go, that he even spared  not a fine copy of Froissart's Chronicles, on vellum, in which was the  autograph of the well-known book-lover, De Thou, but cropped it most  cruelly.    Owners, too, have occasionally diseased minds with regard to margins. A  friend writes: \"Your amusing anecdotes have brought to my memory several  biblioclasts whom I have known. One roughly cut the margins off his  books with a knife, hacking away very much like a hedger and ditcher.  Large paper volumes were his especial delight, as they gave more paper.  The slips thus obtained were used for index-making! Another, with the  bump of order unnaturally developed, had his folios and quartos all  reduced, in binding, to one size, so that they might look even on his  bookshelves.\"    This latter was, doubtless, cousin to him who deliberately cut down all  his books close to the text, because he had been several times annoyed  by readers who made marginal notes.    The indignities, too, suffered by some books in their lettering! Fancy  an early black-letter fifteenth-century quarto on Knighthood, labelled  \"Tracts\"; or a translation of Virgil, \"Sermons\"! The \"Histories of  Troy,\" printed by Caxton, still exists with \"Eracles\" on the back, as  its title, because that name occurs several times in the early chapters,  and the binder was too proud to seek advice. The words \"Miscellaneous,\"  or \"Old Pieces,\" were sometimes used when binders were at a loss for  lettering, and many other instances might be mentioned.    The rapid spread of printing throughout Europe in the latter part of  the fifteenth century caused a great fall in the value of plain  un-illuminated MSS., and the immediate consequence of this was the  destruction of numerous volumes written upon parchment, which were used  by the binders to strengthen the backs of their newly-printed rivals.  These slips of vellum or parchment are quite common in old books.  Sometimes whole sheets are used as fly-leaves, and often reveal the  existence of most valuable works, unknown before--proving, at the same  time, the small value formerly attached to them.    Many a bibliographer, while examining old books, has to his great  puzzlement come across short slips of parchment, nearly always from some  old manuscript, sticking out like \"guards\" from the midst of the leaves.  These suggest, at first, imperfections or"]]]
