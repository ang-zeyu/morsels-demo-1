It was now evident that  nothing short of water would stop the herd, and we rode aside and let  them pass. As the outfit turned back to the wagon, our foreman seemed  dazed by the sudden and unexpected turn of affairs, but rallied and  met the emergency.    \"There's but one thing left to do,\" said he, as we rode along, \"and  that is to hurry the outfit back to Indian Lakes. The herd will travel  day and night, and instinct can be depended on to carry them to the  only water they know. It's too late to be of any use now, but it's  plain why those last two herds turned off at the lakes; some one had  gone back and warned them of the very thing we've met. We must beat  them to the lakes, for water is the only thing that will check them  now. It's a good thing that they are strong, and five or six days  without water will hardly kill any. It was no vague statement of the  man who said if he owned hell and Texas, he'd rent Texas and live in  hell, for if this isn't Billy hell, I'd like to know what you call  it.\"    We spent an hour watering the horses from the wells of our camp of the  night before, and about two o'clock started back over the trail for  Indian Lakes. We overtook the abandoned herd during the afternoon.  They were strung out nearly five miles in length, and were walking  about a three-mile gait. Four men were given two extra horses apiece  and left to throw in the stragglers in the rear, with instructions to  follow them well into the night, and again in the morning as long as  their canteens lasted. The remainder of the outfit pushed on without a  halt, except to change mounts, and reached the lakes shortly after  midnight. There we secured the first good sleep of any consequence for  three days.    It was fortunate for us that there were no range cattle at these  lakes, and we had only to cover a front of about six miles to catch  the drifting herd. It was nearly noon the next day before the cattle  began to arrive at the water holes in squads of from twenty to fifty.  Pitiful objects as they were, it was a novelty to see them reach the  water and slack their thirst. Wading out into the lakes until their  sides were half covered, they would stand and low in a soft moaning  voice, often for half an hour before attempting to drink. Contrary to  our expectation, they drank very little at first, but stood in the  water for hours. After coming out, they would lie down and rest for  hours longer, and then drink again before attempting to graze, their  thirst overpowering hunger. That they were blind there was no  question, but with the causes that produced it once removed, it was  probable their eyesight would gradually return.    By early evening, the rear guard of our outfit returned and reported  the tail end of the herd some twenty miles behind when they left them.  During the day not over a thousand head reached the lakes, and towards  evening we put these under herd and easily held them during the night.  All four of the men who constituted the rear guard were sent back the  next morning to prod up the rear again, and during the night at least  a thousand more came into the lakes, which held them better than a  hundred men. With the recovery of the cattle our hopes grew, and with  the gradual accessions to the herd, confidence was again completely  restored. Our saddle stock, not having suffered as had the cattle,  were in a serviceable condition, and while a few men were all that  were necessary to hold the herd, the others scoured the country for  miles in search of any possible stragglers which might have missed the  water.    During the forenoon of the third day at the lakes, Nat Straw, the  foreman of Ellison's first herd on the trail, rode up to our camp. He  was scouting for water for his herd, and, when our situation was  explained and he had been interrogated regarding loose cattle, gave us  the good news that no stragglers in our road brand had been met by  their outfit. This was welcome news, for we had made no count yet, and  feared some of them, in their locoed condition, might have passed the  water during the night. Our misfortune was an ill wind by which Straw  profited, for he had fully expected to keep on by the old route, but  with our disaster staring him in the face, a similar experience was to  be avoided. His herd reached the lakes during the middle of the  afternoon, and after watering, turned and went westward over the new  route taken by the two herds which preceded us. He had a herd of about  three thousand steers, and was driving to the Dodge market. After the  experience we had just gone through, his herd and outfit were a  welcome sight. Flood made inquiries after Lovell's second herd, under  my brother Bob as foreman, but Straw had seen or heard nothing of  them, having come from Goliad County with his cattle.    After the Ellison herd had passed on and out of sight, our squad which  had been working the country to the northward, over the route by which  the abandoned herd had returned, came in with the information that  that section was clear of cattle, and that they had only found three  head dead from thirst. On the fourth morning, as the herd left the bed  ground, a count was ordered, and to our surprise we counted out  twenty-six head more than we had received on the banks of the Rio  Grande a month before. As there had been but one previous occasion to  count, the number of strays absorbed into our herd was easily  accounted for by Priest: \"If a steer herd could increase on the trail,  why shouldn't ours, that had over a thousand cows in it?\" The  observation was hardly borne out when the ages of our herd were taken  into consideration. But 1882 in Texas was a liberal day and  generation, and \"cattle stealing\" was too drastic a term to use for  the chance gain of a few cattle, when the foundations of princely  fortunes were being laid with a rope and a branding iron.    In order to give the Ellison herd a good start of us, we only moved  our wagon to the farthest lake and went into camp for the day. The  herd had recovered its normal condition by this time, and of the  troubles of the past week not a trace remained. Instead, our herd  grazed in leisurely content over a thousand acres, while with the  exception of a few men on herd, the outfit lounged around the wagon  and beguiled the time with cards.    We had undergone an experience which my bunkie, The Rebel, termed \"an  interesting incident in his checkered career,\" but which not even he  would have cared to repeat. That night while on night herd  together--the cattle resting in all contentment--we rode one round  together, and as he rolled a cigarette he gave me an old war story:--    \"They used to tell the story in the army, that during one of the  winter retreats, a cavalryman, riding along in the wake of the column  at night, saw a hat apparently floating in the mud and water. In the  hope that it might be a better hat than the one he was wearing, he  dismounted to get it. Feeling his way carefully through the ooze until  he reached the hat, he was surprised to find a man underneath and  wearing it. 'Hello, comrade,' he sang out, 'can I lend you a hand?'    \"'No, no,' replied the fellow, 'I'm all right; I've got a good mule  yet under me.'\"        CHAPTER VI    A REMINISCENT NIGHT    On the ninth morning we made our second start from the Indian Lakes.  An amusing incident occurred during the last night of our camp at  these water holes. Coyotes had been hanging around our camp for  several days, and during the quiet hours of the night these scavengers  of the plain had often ventured in near the wagon in search of scraps  of meat or anything edible. Rod Wheat and Ash Borrowstone had made  their beds down some distance from the wagon; the coyotes as they  circled round the camp came near their bed, and in sniffing about  awoke Borrowstone. There was no more danger of attack from these  cowards than from field mice, but their presence annoyed Ash, and as  he dared not shoot, he threw his boots at the varmints. Imagine his  chagrin the next morning to find that one boot had landed among the  banked embers of the camp-fire, and was burned to a crisp. It was  looked upon as a capital joke by the outfit, as there was no telling  when we would reach a store where he could secure another pair.    The new trail, after bearing to the westward for several days, turned  northward, paralleling the old one, and a week later we came into the  old trail over a hundred miles north of the Indian Lakes. With the  exception of one thirty-mile drive without water, no fault could be  found with the new trail. A few days after coming into the old trail,  we passed Mason, a point where trail herds usually put in for  supplies. As we passed during the middle of the afternoon, the wagon  and a number of the boys went into the burg. Quince Forrest and Billy  Honeyman were the only two in the outfit for whom there were any  letters, with the exception of a letter from Lovell, which was common  property. Never having been over the trail before, and not even  knowing that it was possible to hear from home, I wasn't expecting any  letter; but I felt a little twinge of homesickness that night when  Honeyman read us certain portions of his letter, which was from his  sister. Forrest's letter was from a sweetheart, and after reading it a  few times, he burnt it, and that was all we ever knew of its contents,  for he was too foxy to say anything, even if it had not been  unfavorable. Borrowstone swaggered around camp that evening in a new  pair of boots, which had the Lone Star set in filigree-work in their  red tops.    At our last camp at the lakes, The Rebel and I, as partners, had been  shamefully beaten in a game of seven-up by Bull Durham and John  Officer, and had demanded satisfaction in another trial around the  fire that night. We borrowed McCann's lantern, and by the aid of it  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12809"],[0,"Quiet Talks about Jesus (#10)"],[1," Spirit in these old prophetic  pages. This will be followed by a universal, voluntary coming to Israel  for religious instruction. She becomes the teacher of the nations  regarding God, until by and by the whole earth shall be filled with the  knowledge of the only God. Her influence upon them for good will be as the  heavy fertilizing eastern dews and the life-giving showers are to  vegetation.    But further yet, Israel is to be the _only_ medium of God's blessing upon  the nations--the only channel. Those refusing her leadership will, for  lack of vital sap, die of dry rot. The wondrous blessing enjoyed by this  central nation, the unhingeing of dungeon doors, the opening of blind  eyes, the mellowing of all the hard conditions of life, the reign of  simple, full justice to all, is to be shared with all the nations.  Israel's peace with all nations is to become a universal peace between and  among all nations.    But there's still more. There are to follow certain radical changes in  the realm of _nature_. Splendid rivers of water are to flow through  Jerusalem, necessitating changes in the formation of the land there. The  fortress capital of the Jews strongly entrenched among the Judean hills is  to become, as the world's metropolis, a mighty city, with rivers to float  the earth's commerce. The light of the sun and moon will be greatly  increased, and yet this greatly intensified light will become at Jerusalem  a shadow cast by the greater light of the presence of God. A devout Hebrew  would associate this back with the light of the Presence-cloud in the  Arabian barrens. While the devout Christian will likely, quickly think  forward from that to the light that was one time as the sun, and, again,  above the sun's brightness. Naturally, with this comes a renewed fertility  of the earth's soil, and the removal of the curse upon vegetation. Before  the healing light and heat the poisonous growth, the blight of drought and  of untempered heat disappear. There is to be a new earth and above it a  new heaven.    To complete the picture, the _animal_ creation is to undergo changes as  radical as these. Beasts dangerous because of ferocity and because of  treachery and poisonous qualities will be wholly changed. Meat-eating  beasts will change their habit of diet, and eat grain and herbs. There  will be a mutual cessation of cruelty to animals by man and of danger to  man from animals, for all violence will have ceased.    And then the climax is capped by repeated assurances that this marvellous  kingdom will be as extensive as the earth and absolutely unending.    The whole thing, be it keenly noticed, is simply a return to the original  condition. In the Eden garden was the presence of God, a masterful man in  the likeness of God, with full dominion over all creation. There was full  accord in all nature, and perfect fellowship between man and nature.    All this is to come to pass through the coming One. He is the key that  unlocks this wondrous future. Through all, above all, growing ever bigger,  is the shadowy majestic figure of _a Man coming._ His personal  characteristics make Him very attractive and winsome. He will be of  unusual mental keenness both in understanding and in wisdom, combined with  courage of a high order, and, above all, dominated by a deep reverential,  a keenly alert, love for God. He will be beautiful in person and, in sharp  contrast with earth's kings, while marked personally with that fine  dignity and majesty unconscious of itself, will be gentle and  unpretentious in His bearing. His relations with God are direct and very  intimate, being personally trained and taught by Him. Backed by all of His  omnipotence, He will be charged with the carrying out of His great plans  for the chosen people and through them for the world.    In a fine touch it is specially said that \"He will judge the _poor_.\" Poor  folk, who haven't money to employ lawyers to guard their interests, and  haven't time for much education to know better how to protect themselves  against those who would take advantage of them--the _poor_, that's the  overwhelming majority of the whole world--He will be _their_ judge. They  will have a friend on the bench. But He will have this enormous advantage  in judging all men, poor and otherwise, that He will not need to decide by  what folk tell Him, nor by outside things. He will be able to read down  into the motives and back into the life.    Such is the plan for the coming One outlined in these old pages. To many a  modern all this must seem like the wildest dream of an utterly unpractical  enthusiast. Yet, mark it keenly, this is the conception of this old Hebrew  book that has been, and is, the world's standard of morals and of wisdom.  The book revered above all others by the most thoughtful men, of all  shades of belief. It is striking how the parts of this stupendous  conception fit and hold together. There is a mature symmetry about the  whole scheme. For instance, the changes in the light of sun and moon run  parallel with the changes in growth and in the healthfulness and longer  lives of man. Increased light removes both disease and its cause, and  gives new life and lengthened life.    Surely these Hebrews are a great people _in their visions_. And a vision  is an essential of greatness. Yet this sublime conception of their future  is not regarded as a visionary dream, but calmly declared to be the  revealed plan of God for them, and through them for the earth. And that,  too, not by any one man, but successively through many generations of  men. The prophetic spirit of the nation in the midst of terrible disaster  and of moral degradation never loses faith in its ultimate greatness,  through the fulfilling of its mission to the nations of the earth.    Is it to be wondered at that the devout Israelite, who believed in his  book and its vision, pitched his tent on the hilltop, with his eye ever  scanning the eastern horizon, for the figure of the coming One? And when  eyes grown dim for the long looking believed that at last that figure was  seen, the heart breathed out its grateful relief in \"Now lettest thou thy  servant depart in peace, for my eyes have seen.\"        <u>Strange Dark Shadowings.</u>      But, too, there is in this vision of glory something very different, so  mixed in that it won't come out. There are dark shadows from the first  touch upon the canvas. Always there is a bitter, malignant enemy. There is  decisive victory, but it comes only after sharp, hard, long-continued  fighting. But in the latter parts, that is, in David's time, and  intensifying in the later pages, there is something darker yet. Through  these lines run forebodings, strange, weird, sad forebodings of evil.  There are dark gray threads, inky black threads, that do not harmonize  with the pattern being woven. And the weavers notice it, and wonder, and  yet are under a strange impulse to weave on without understanding.    Their coming One is to be a king, but there is the distinct consciousness  that there would be for Him terrible experiences through which He must  pass, and to which He would yield on His way to the throne. The very  conception seems to involve a contradiction which puzzles these men who  write them down. Like a lower minor strain running through some great  piece of music are the few indications of what God fore_knew_, though He  did not foreplan, would happen to Jesus. A sharp line must always be drawn  between what God plans and what He knows will happen. The soft sobbing of  what God could see ahead runs as a minor sad cadence through the story of  His plans.    Sometimes these forebodings are _acted out_. In the light of the Gospels  we can easily see very striking likenesses between the experiences in  which keen suffering precedes great victory, of such _national leaders_ as  Joseph and David, and the experiences of Jesus. Here is _God's_ plan of  atonement by blood, involving suffering, but with no such accompaniments  of hatred and cruelty as Jesus went through. Read backward, Jesus'  experience on the cross is seen to bear striking resemblances, in part, to  this old scheme of atonement; yet only in part: the parts concerning His  character and the results; but not the _manner_ of his death, nor the  _spirit_ of the actors.    Then there are the few direct specific passages predicting a stormy trip  for the king before the haven is reached. There is a vividness of detail  in the very language here, that catches us, familiar with after events,  as it could not those who first heard. There is the Twenty-second Psalm,  with its broken sentences, as though blurted out between heart-breaking  sobs; and then the wondrous change, in the latter part, to victory  _through_ this terrible experience. And the scanty but vivid lines in the  Sixty-ninth Psalm. There is that great throbbing fifty-third of Isaiah,  with its beginning back in the close of the fifty-second, and the striking  ahead of its key-note in the fiftieth chapter.    Daniel listens with awe deepening ever more as Gabriel tells him that the  coming Prince is to be \"_cut off_.\" To the returned exiles rebuilding the  temple Zechariah acts out a parable in which Jehovah is priced at thirty  pieces of silver, the cost of a common slave. And a bit later God speaks  of a time when \"they shall look upon Me (or Him) whom they _have  pierced_.\" And later yet, a still more significant phrase is used, as  identifying the divine character of the sufferer, where God speaks of a  sword being used \"against the man that is _My Fellow_,\" adding, \"Strike  the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.\" It is God's Fellow--one  on a par with Himself--against whom the opposition is directed.    Such is the great vision in these Hebrew pages of the plan for the coming  One. There is a throne on a high mountain peak bathed in wondrous sublime  glory, but the writers are puzzled at a dark valley of the"]]]
