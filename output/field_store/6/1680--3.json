[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13493"],[0,"The American Frugal Housewife (#10)"],[1," there  is usually two cents difference per pound. The neck of fat mutton  makes a good steak for broiling.    Lamb brings the same price, either fore-quarter or hind-quarter;  therefore it is more profitable to buy a hind-quarter than a  fore-quarter; especially as its own fat will cook it, and there is no  need of pork or butter in addition. Either part is good for roasting  or boiling. The loin of lamb is suitable for roasting, and is the most  profitable for a small family. The leg is more suitable for boiling  than for anything else; the shoulder and breast are peculiarly  suitable for broth.    The part that in lamb is called the loin, in mutton is called the  chop. Mutton chop is considered very good for broiling.    Pig's head is a profitable thing to buy. It is despised, because it is  cheap; but when well cooked it is delicious. Well cleaned, the tip of  the snout chopped off, and put in brine a week, it is very good for  boiling: the cheeks, in particular, are very sweet; they are better  than any other pieces of pork to bake with beans. The head is likewise  very good baked about an hour and a half. It tastes like roast pork,  and yields abundance of sweet fat, for shortening.           *       *       *       *       *          COMMON COOKING.      It is necessary to be very careful of fresh meat in the summer season.  The moment it is brought into the house, it should be carefully  covered from the flies, and put in the coldest place in the cellar.  If it consist of pieces, they should be spread out separate from each  other, on a large dish, and covered. If you are not to cook it soon,  it is well to sprinkle salt on it. The kidney, and fat flabby parts,  should be raised up above the lean, by a skewer, or stick, and a  little salt strewn in. If you have to keep it over night, it should be  looked to the last thing when you go to bed; and if there is danger,  it should be scalded.      VEAL.    Veal should boil about an hour, if a neck-piece; if the meat comes  from a thicker, more solid part, it should boil longer. No directions  about these things will supply the place of judgment and experience.  Both mutton and veal are better for being boiled with a small piece of  salt pork. Veal broth is very good.    Veal soup should be slowly stewed for two hours. Seasoned the same as  above. Some people like a little sifted summer-savory.    Six or seven pounds of veal will roast in an hour and a half.    Fried veal is better for being dipped in white of egg, and rolled in  nicely pounded crumbs of bread, before it is cooked. One egg is enough  for a common dinner.      CALF'S HEAD.    Calf's head should be cleansed with very great care; particularly  the lights. The head, the heart, and the lights should boil full two  hours; the liver should be boiled only one hour. It is better to leave  the wind-pipe on, for if it hangs out of the pot while the head is  cooking, all the froth will escape through it. The brains, after being  thoroughly washed, should be put in a little bag; with one pounded  cracker, or as much crumbled bread, seasoned with sifted sage, and  tied up and boiled one hour. After the brains are boiled, they should  be well broken up with a knife, and peppered, salted, and buttered.  They should be put upon the table in a bowl by themselves. Boiling  water, thickened with flour and water, with butter melted in it, is  the proper sauce; some people love vinegar and pepper mixed with the  melted butter; but all are not fond of it; and it is easy for each one  to add it for themselves.      BEEF.    Beef soup should be stewed four hours over a slow fire. Just water  enough to keep the meat covered. If you have any bones left of roast  meat, &c. it is a good plan to boil them with the meat, and take them  out half an hour before the soup is done. A pint of flour and water,  with salt, pepper, twelve or sixteen onions, should be put in twenty  minutes before the soup is done. Be careful and not throw in salt  and pepper too plentifully; it is easy to add to it, and not easy to  diminish. A lemon, cut up and put in half an hour before it is done,  adds to the flavor. If you have tomato catsup in the house, a cupful  will make soup rich. Some people put in crackers; some thin slices of  crust, made nearly as short as common shortcake; and some stir up two  or three eggs with milk and flour, and drop it in with a spoon.    A quarter of an hour to each pound of beef is considered a good rule  for roasting; but this is too much when the bone is large, and the  meal thin. Six pounds of the rump should roast six quarters of an  hour; but bony pieces less. It should be done before a quick fire.    The quicker beef-steak can be broiled the better. Seasoned after it is  taken from the gridiron.      ALAMODE BEEF.    Tie up a round of beef so as to keep it in shape; make a stuffing of  grated bread, suet, sweet herbs, quarter of an ounce of nutmeg, a few  cloves pounded, yolk of an egg. Cut holes in the beef, and put in the  stuffing, leaving about half the stuffing to be made into balls. Tie  the beef up in a cloth, just cover it with water, let it boil an hour  and a half; then turn it, and let it boil an hour and a half more;  then turn out the liquor, and put some skewers across the bottom of  the pot, and lay the beef upon it, to brown; turn it that it may brown  on both sides. Put a pint of claret, and some allspice and cloves,  into the liquor, and boil some balls made of the stuffing in it.      MUTTON AND LAMB.    Six or seven pounds of mutton will roast in an hour and a half. Lamb  one hour. Mutton is apt to taste strong; this may be helped by soaking  the meat in a little salt and water, for an hour before cooking.  However, unless meat is very sweet, it is best to corn it, and boil  it.    Fresh meat should never be put in to cook till the water boils; and it  should be boiled in as little water as possible; otherwise the flavor  is injured. Mutton enough for a family of five or six should boil an  hour and a half. A leg of lamb should boil an hour, or little more  than an hour, perhaps. Put a little thickening into boiling water;  strain it nicely; and put sweet butter in it for sauce. If your family  like broth, throw in some clear rice when you put in the meat. The  rice should be in proportion to the quantity of broth you mean to  make. A large table spoonful is enough for three pints of water.  Seasoned with a very little pepper and salt. Summer-savory, or sage,  rubbed through a sieve, thrown in.      PORK.    Fresh pork should be cooked more than any other meat. A thick shoulder  piece should be roasted full two hours and a half; and other pieces  less in proportion. The slight sickness occasioned by eating roasted  pork may be prevented by soaking it in salt and water the night before  you cook it. If called to prepare it on short notice, it will answer  to baste it with weak brine while roasting; and then turn the brine  off, and throw it away.      ROAST PIG.    Strew fine salt over it an hour before it is put down. It should not  be cut entirely open; fill it up plump with thick slices of buttered  bread, salt, sweet-marjoram and sage. Spit it with the head next the  point of the spit; take off the joints of the leg, and boil them with  the liver, with a little whole pepper, allspice, and salt, for gravy  sauce. The upper part of the legs must be braced down with skewers.  Shake on flour. Put a little water in the dripping-pan, and stir it  often. When the eyes drop out, the pig is half done. When it is nearly  done, baste it with butter. Cut off the head, split it open between  the eyes. Take out the brains, and chop them fine with the liver and  some sweet-marjoram and sage; put this into melted butter, and when  it has boiled a few minutes, add it to the gravy in the dripping-pan.  When your pig is cut open, lay it with the back to the edge of the  dish; half a head to be placed at each end. A good sized pig needs to  be roasted three hours.      SAUSAGES.    Three tea-spoons of powdered sage, one and a half of salt, and one of  pepper, to a pound of meat, is good seasoning for sausages.      MINCE MEAT.    There is a great difference in preparing mince meat. Some make it  a coarse, unsavory dish; and others make it nice and palatable. No  economical house-keeper will despise it; for broken bits of meat and  vegetables cannot so well be disposed of in any other way. If you  wish to have it nice, mash your vegetables fine, and chop your meat  very fine. Warm it with what remains of sweet gravy, or roast-meat  drippings, you may happen to have. Two or three apples, pared, cored,  sliced, and fried, to mix with it, is an improvement. Some like a  little sifted sage sprinkled in.    It is generally considered nicer to chop your meat fine, warm it in  gravy, season it, and lay it upon a large slice of toasted bread to be  brought upon the table without being mixed with potatoes; but if you  have cold vegetables, use them.      BEANS AND PEAS.    Baked beans are a very simple dish, yet few cook them well. They  should be put in cold water, and hung over the fire, the night before  they are baked. In the morning, they should be put in a colander, and  rinsed two or three times; then again placed in a kettle, with the  pork you intend to bake, covered with water, and kept scalding hot,  an hour or more. A pound of pork is quite enough for a quart of beans,  and that is a large dinner for a common family. The rind of the pork  should be slashed. Pieces of pork alternately fat and lean, are the  most suitable; the cheeks are the best. A little pepper sprinkled  among the beans, when they are placed in the bean-pot, will render  them less unhealthy. They should be just covered with water, when put  into the oven; and the pork should be sunk a little below the surface  of the beans. Bake three or four hours.    Stewed beans are prepared in the same way. The only difference is,  they are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13499"],[0,"Two Little Savages (#10)"],[1,"most part, who brought  with them the ancient feud that has so long divided Ireland--the  bitter quarrel between the Catholics or \"Dogans\" (why so called none  knew) and Protestants, more usually styled \"Prattisons.\" The colours  of the Catholics were green and white; of the Protestants orange  and blue; and hence another distinctive name of the latter was  \"Orangemen.\"    These two factions split the social structure in two vertically. There  were, in addition, several horizontal lines of cleavage which, like  geological seams, ran across both segments.    In those days, the early part of the nineteenth century, the British  Government used to assist desirable persons who wished to emigrate to  Canada from Ireland. This aid consisted of a free ocean passage. Many  who could not convince the Government of their desirability and yet  could raise the money, came with them, paying their regular steerage  rate of $15. These were alike to the outside world, but not to  themselves. Those who paid their way were \"passengers,\" and were, in  their own opinion, many social worlds above the assisted ones, who  were called \"Emmy Grants.\" This distinction was never forgotten among  the residents of Sanger.    Yet two other social grades existed. Every man and boy in Sanger was  an expert with the axe; was wonderfully adroit. The familiar phrase,  \"He's a good man,\" had two accepted meanings: If obviously applied to  a settler during the regular Saturday night Irish row in the little  town of Downey's Dump, it meant he was an able man with his fists;  but if to his home life on the farm, it implied that he was unusually  dexterous with the axe. A man who fell below standard was despised.  Since the houses of hewn logs were made by their owners, they  reflected the axemen's skill. There were two styles of log  architecture; the shanty with corners criss-cross, called hog-pen  finish, and the other, the house with the corners neatly finished,  called dovetail finish. In Sanger it was a social black eye to live in  a house of the first kind. The residents were considered \"scrubs\" or  \"riff-raff\" by those whose superior axemanship had provided the  more neatly finished dwelling. A later division crept in among the  \"dovetailers\" themselves when a brickyard was opened. The more  prosperous settlers put up neat little brick houses. To the surprise  of all, one Phil O'Leary, a poor but prolific Dogan, leaped at once  from a hog-pen log to a fine brick, and caused no end of perplexity  to the ruling society queens, simply paralyzing the social register,  since his nine fat daughters now had claims with the best. Many,  however, whose brick houses were but five years old, denounced the  O'Learys as upstarts and for long witheld all social recognition.  William Raften, as the most prosperous man in the community, was  first to appear in red bricks. His implacable enemy, Char-less (two  syllables) Boyle, egged on by his wife, now also took the red brick  plunge, though he dispensed with masons and laid the bricks himself,  with the help of his seventeen sons. These two men, though Orangemen  both, were deadly enemies, as the wives were social rivals. Raften was  the stronger and richer man, but Boyle, whose father had paid his own  steerage rate, knew all about Raften's father, and always wound up  any discussion by hurling in Raften's teeth: \"Don't talk to me, ye  upstart. Everybody knows ye are nothing but a Emmy Grant.\" This was  the one fly in the Raften ointment. No use denying it. His father  had accepted a free passage, true, and Boyle had received a free  homestead, but what of that--that counted for nothing. Old Boyle had  been a \"PASSENGER,\" old Raften an \"EMMY GRANT.\"    This was the new community that Yan had entered, and the words Dogan  and Prattison, \"green\" and \"orange and blue,\" began to loom large,  along with the ideas and animosities they stood for.    The accent of the Sangerite was mixed. First, there was a rich Irish  brogue with many Irish words; this belonged chiefly to the old folks.  The Irish of such men as Raften was quite evident in their speech, but  not strong enough to warrant the accepted Irish spelling of books,  except when the speaker was greatly excited. The young generation  had almost no Irish accent, but all had sifted down to the peculiar  burring nasal whine of the backwoods Canadian.    Mr. and Mrs. Raften met Yan at the station. They had supper together  at the tavern and drove him to their home, where they showed him into  the big dining-room--living-room--kitchen. Over behind the stove was  a tall, awkward boy with carroty hair and small, dark eyes set much  aslant in the saddest of faces. Mrs. Raften said, \"Come, Sam, and  shake hands with Yan.\" Sam came sheepishly forward, shook hands in a  flabby way, and said, in drawling tones, \"How-do,\" then retired behind  the stove to gaze with melancholy soberness at Yan, whenever he could  do so without being caught at it. Mr. and Mrs. Raften were attending  to various matters elsewhere, and Yan was left alone and miserable.  The idea of giving up college to go on a farm had been a hard one for  him to accept, but he had sullenly bowed to his father's command and  then at length learned to like the prospect of getting away from  Bonnerton into the country. After all, it was but for a year, and it  promised so much of joy. Sunday-school left behind. Church reduced to  a minimum. All his life outdoors, among fields and woods--surely this  spelled happiness; but now that he was really there, the abomination  of desolation seemed sitting on all things and the evening was one  of unalloyed misery. He had nothing to tell of, but a cloud of black  despair seemed to have settled for good on the world. His mouth was  pinching very hard and his eyes blinking to keep back the tears when  Mrs. Raften came into the room. She saw at a glance what was wrong.  \"He's homesick,\" she said to her husband. \"He'll be all right  to-morrow,\" and she took Yan by the hand and led him upstairs to bed.    Twenty minutes later she came to see if he was comfortable. She tucked  the clothes in around him, then, stooping down for a good-night kiss,  she found his face wet with tears. She put her arms about him for a  moment, kissed him several times, and said, \"Never mind, you will feel  all right to-morrow,\" then wisely left him alone.    Whence came that load of misery and horror, or whither it went, Yan  never knew. He saw it no more, and the next morning he began to  interest himself in his new world.    William Raften had a number of farms all in fine order and clear  of mortgages; and each year he added to his estates. He was sober,  shrewd, even cunning, hated by most of his neighbours because he was  too clever for them and kept on getting richer. His hard side was for  the world and his soft side for his family. Not that he was really  soft in any respect. He had had to fight his life-battle alone,  beginning with nothing, and the many hard knocks had hardened him, but  the few who knew him best could testify to the warm Irish heart that  continued unchanged within him, albeit it was each year farther  from the surface. His manners, even in the house, were abrupt and  masterful. There was no mistaking his orders, and no excuse for not  complying with them. To his children when infants, and to his wife  only, he was always tender, and those who saw him cold and grasping,  overreaching the sharpers of the grain market, would scarcely have  recognized the big, warm-hearted happy-looking father at home an hour  later when he was playing horse with his baby daughter or awkwardly  paying post-graduate court to his smiling wife.    He had little \"eddication,\" could hardly read, and was therefore  greatly impressed with the value of \"book larnin',\" and determined  that his own children should have the \"best that money could git in  that line,\" which probably meant that they should read fluently. His  own reading was done on Sunday mornings, when he painfully spelled out  the important items in a weekly paper; \"important\" meant referring  to the produce market or the prize ring, for he had been known and  respected as a boxer, and dearly loved the exquisite details of the  latest bouts. He used to go to church with his wife once a month to  please her, and thought it very unfair therefore that she should take  no interest in his favourite hobby--the manly art.    Although hard and even brutal in his dealings with men, he could not  bear to see an animal ill used. \"The men can holler when they're hurt,  but the poor dumb baste has no protection.\" He was the only farmer in  the country that would not sell or shoot a worn-out horse. \"The poor  brute has wurruked hard an' hez airned his kape for the rest av his  days.\" So Duncan, Jerry and several others were \"retired\" and lived  their latter days in idleness, in one case for more than ten years.    Raften had thrashed more than one neighbour for beating a horse, and  once, on interfering, was himself thrashed, for he had the ill-luck to  happen on a prizefighter. But that had no lasting effect on him. He  continued to champion the dumb brute in his own brutal way.    Among the neighbours the perquisites of the boys were the calfskins.  The cows' milk was needed and the calves of little value, so usually  they were killed when too young for food. The boys did the killing,  making more or less sport of it, and the skins, worth fifty cents  apiece green and twenty-five cents dry, at the tannery, were their  proper pay. Raften never allowed his son to kill the calves. \"Oi can't  kill a poor innocent calf mesilf an' I won't hev me boy doin' it,\" he  said. Thus Sam was done out of a perquisite, and did not forget the  grievance.    Mrs. Raften was a fine woman, a splendid manager, loving her home and  her family, her husband's loyal and ablest supporter, although she  thought that William was sometimes a \"leetle hard\" on the boys."]]]
