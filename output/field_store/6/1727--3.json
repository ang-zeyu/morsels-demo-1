In the history of music two men surpassed all others in what they  accomplished in counterpoint--that is, in polyphonic writing. The one  was Palestrina, an Italian; the other was Bach, a German. Palestrina  lived at a time when the music of the church was very poor, so poor,  indeed, that the clergy could no longer endure it. Palestrina,  however, devoted himself earnestly to composing music strictly adapted  to the church use. The parts were all melodic, and woven together with  such great skill that they yet remain masterpieces of contrapuntal  writing. Later Bach developed counterpoint very much more in the  modern way. He did with polyphony for the piano and organ much the  same as Palestrina did for the voice. There have never lived greater  masters than these in the art of polyphonic music.    There is still another form of writing which is neither strictly  harmonic, nor strictly contrapuntal,--it is a combination of both.  There is not the plain unadorned harmonic progress as in the simple  choral, nor is there the strict voice progression as in the works of  Bach. This form of writing which partakes of the beauties of both the  others has been called the free harmonic style. It has been followed  by all the great masters since the time of Bach,[48] even before,  indeed. If you can imagine a beautiful song-melody with an artistic  accompaniment, so arranged that all can be played upon the piano, you  will understand what the third style is. It is wonderfully free,  surely; sometimes proceeding in full free chords, as in the opening  measures of the B flat Sonata of Beethoven,[49] again running away  from all freedom back to the old style, until the picture looks as old  as a monkish costume among modern dress.    All of the great sonatas and symphonies are of this wonderfully varied  form of writing. How full it can be of expressiveness you know from  the Songs without Words by Mendelssohn, and the Nocturnes of Chopin;  how full of flickering humor you hear in the Scherzo of a Beethoven  symphony; how full of deep solemnity and grief one feels in the  funeral marches.[50]    This school of composition has been followed by both the greater and  the lesser masters. Every part is made to say something as naturally  and interestingly as possible, being neither too restricted nor too  free. Then, in playing, both hands must be equally intelligent, for  each has an important part assigned to it.    The great good of study in harmony and counterpoint is that it  increases one's appreciation. As soon as we begin to understand the  spirit of good writing we begin to play better, _because we see more_.  We begin, perhaps in a small way, to become real music-thinkers. By  all these means we learn to understand better and better what the  meaning of true writing is. It will be clear to us that a composer is  one who thinks pure thoughts in tone, and not one who is a weaver of  deceits.          CHAPTER XV.    MUSIC AND READING.        \"Truly it has been said, a loving heart is the beginning of all    knowledge.\"--_Thomas Carlyle._    A beautiful thing in life is the friendship for books. Every one who  loves books pays some day a tribute to them, expressing thankfulness  for the joy and comfort they have given. There are in them, for  everybody who will seek, wise words, good counsel, companies of great  people, fairies, friends for every day, besides wonders we never see  nor dream of in daily life.    Some of the great men have told us about their love for books; how  they have saved penny by penny slowly to buy one, or how after the  day's labor a good book and the firelight were prized above anything  else. All tell us how much they owe to books and what a blessing books  are. Imagine the number of heart-thoughts there must be in a shelf  full of good books! Thoughts in tones or thoughts in words may be of  the heart or not. But it is only when they are of the heart that they  are worthy of our time.    You will not only love books, but gain from them something of the  thoughts they contain. We might, had we time, talk of classic books,  but as we have already talked of classic music we know what the  principal thing is. It is that good thought, out of the heart, be  expressed in a scholarly way--\"Great thought needs great  expression.\"[51] This teaches us the necessity for choosing good books  for our instruction and for our entertainment. They present beautiful  pictures to us truthfully, or they present truth to us beautifully.  And these are the first test of a written thought--its truth and its  beauty.    If you read good books you will have in every volume you get something  well worth owning. You should bestow upon it as much care as you would  want any other good friend to receive. And if it has contributed help  or pleasure to you it is surely worth an abiding place. A fine  pleasure will come from a good book even after we are quite done with  it. As we see it in years after it has been read there comes back to  one a remembrance of all the old pleasures, and with it a sense of  thankfulness for so pleasant a friendship. Hence any book that has  given us joy or peace or comfort is well worth not only good care, but  a place _for always_; as a worthy bit of property.    In the early days of your music study, it will be a pleasure to you to  know that there are many and delightful books _about_ music written,  sometimes by music-lovers, sometimes by the composers. The written  word-thoughts of the composers are often full of great interest. They  not only reveal to us many secrets of the tone-art, but teach us much  about the kinds of things and of thoughts which lived in the minds of  the composers. We learn definitely not only the music-interests of the  composers, but the life-interest as well. It really seems as if we  were looking into their houses, seeing the way they lived and worked,  and listening to their words. Never afterward do we regard the great  names in music as uninteresting. The most charming and attractive  pictures cluster about them and it all gives us a new inspiration to  be true to music, loyal to the truth of music, and willing to do as we  see others have done, and to learn by doing. The lesson we get from  the life of every man is, that he must _do_ if he would learn.    I am sure you will spend many delightful minutes with the Letters of a  great composer. Every one is like a talk with the writer. They are so  friendly, and so full of the heart, and yet so filled with the man  himself. Especially the Letters of Mendelssohn and Schumann will  please you. In truth the Letters of all the composers are among the  most valuable music writings we have. In some way they seem to explain  the music itself: and the composer at once becomes a close friend. But  besides these read the biographies. Then it is as if we were  personally invited home to the composer and shown all his ways and his  life. And besides these, there are some friendly books full of the  very best advice as to making us thoughtful musicians; many and many  again are the writers who have so loved art--not the art of tone  alone, but all other arts as well--that they have told us of it in  good and earnest books which are friendly, because they are written  from the right place; and that you must know by this time is the  heart.    You will soon see when you have read about the composers that true  music comes out of true life. Then you will begin to love true life,  to be useful, and to help others. But all these things do not come at  once. Yet, as we go along step by step, we learn that art is  unselfish, and we must be so to enjoy it; art is truthful--we must be  so to express it; art is full of life--we must know and live truth in  order to appreciate it. And the study of pure thoughts in music, in  books, and in our own life will help to all this.          CHAPTER XVI.    THE HANDS.        \"The skill of their hands still lingers.\"--_John Ruskin._[52]    In one of our Talks, speaking about the thoughts in our hearts, we  said that they crept from the heart into our arms and hands, into the  music we play, and off to those who hear us, causing in them the  thoughts by which they judge us. Thus we see, that as Janus stands  sentinel at the doorway of the year, so the hands stand between the  secret world of thought within and the questioning world of curiosity  without.    If we were not in such a hurry usually, we might stop to think that  every one, all over the world, is training the hands for some purpose.  And such a variety of purposes! One strives to get skill with tools,  another is a conjurer, another spends his life among beautiful and  delicate plants, another reads with his fingers.[53] In any one of  these or of the countless other ways that the hands may be used, no  one may truly be said to have skill until delicacy has been gained.  Even in a forcible use of the hands there must be the greatest  delicacy in the guidance. You can readily see that when the hands are  working at the command of the heart they must be ever ready to make  evident the meaning of the heart, and that is expressed in truthful  delicacy. Not only are all the people in the world training their  hands, but they are, as we have already said, training them in  countless different ways.    Have you ever stopped to think of another matter: that all things  about us, except the things that live, have been made by hands? And of  the things that live very many are cared for by the hands. These  thoughts will suggest something to us. Those things which are good and  beautiful suggest noble use of the hands; while those which are of no  service, harmful and destructive, show an ignoble use. But noble and  ignoble use of the hands is only another evidence of thought. Thought  that is pure in the heart guides the hands to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14360"],[0,"The Dawn and the Day (#10)"],[1,"its rocky bed,    Bordered by giant trees with densest shade.    Here, day by day, the city bring their dead;    Here, day by day, they build the funeral-piles;    Here lamentations daily fill the air;    Here hissing flames each day taste human flesh,    And friendly watchmen guard the smoldering pile    Till friends can cull the relics from the dust.    And here, just finished, rose a noble pile    By stately Brahmans for a Brahman built    Of fragrant woods, and drenched with fragrant oils,    Loading the air with every sweet perfume    That India's forests or her fields can yield;    Above, a couch of sacred cusa-grass,    On which no dreams disturb the sleeper's rest.    And now the sound of music reaches them,    Far off at first, solemn and sad and slow,    Rising and swelling as it nearer comes,    Until a long procession comes in view.    Four Brahmans first, bearing in bowls the fire    No more to burn on one deserted hearth,    Then stately Brahmans on their shoulders bore    A noble brother of their sacred caste,    In manhood's bloom and early prime cut down.    Then Brahman youth, bearing a little child    Half hid in flowers, and as in seeming sleep.    Then other Brahmans in a litter bore    One young and fair, in early womanhood,    Her youthful beauty joined with matron grace,    In bridal dress adorned with costly gems--    The very face the prince had dreaming seen,    The very child she carried in her arms.    Then many more, uncovered, four by four,    The aged first, then those in manhood's prime,    And then the young with many acolytes    Chanting in unison their sacred hymns,    Accompanied by many instruments,    Both wind and string, in solemn symphony;    And at respectful distance other castes,    Afraid to touch a Brahman's sacred robes    Or even mingle with his grief their tears.    And when they reached the fragrant funeral-pile,    Weeping they placed their dead on their last couch,    The child within its father's nerveless arms;    And when all funeral rites had been performed,    The widow circled thrice the funeral-pile,    Distributing her gifts with lavish hand,    Bidding her friends a long and last farewell--    Then stopped, and raised her tearless eyes and said:    \"Farewell, a long farewell, to life and friends!    Farewell!  O earth and air and sacred sun!    Nanda, my lord, Udra, my child, I come!\"    Then pale but calm, with fixed ecstatic gaze    And steady steps she mounts the funeral-pile,    Crying, \"They beckon me!  I come! I come!\"    Then sunk as if the silver cord were loosed    As still as death upon her silent dead.    Instant the flames from the four corners leaped,    Mingling in one devouring, eager blaze.    No groan, no cry, only the crackling flames,    The wailing notes of many instruments,    And solemn chant by many voices raised,    \"Perfect is she who follows thus her lord.\"    O dark and cruel creeds, O perfect love,    Fitter for heaven than this sad world of ours!      More than enough the prince had seen and heard.    Bowed by the grievous burdens others bore,    Feeling for others' sorrows as his own,    Tears of divinest pity filled his eyes    And deep and all-embracing love his heart.    Home he returned, no more to find its rest.      But soon a light shines in that troubled house--    A son is born to sweet Yasodhara.    Their eyes saw not, neither do ours, that sun    Whose light is wisdom and whose heat is love,    Sending through nature waves of living light,    Giving its life to everything that lives,    Which through the innocence of little ones    As through wide-open windows sends his rays    To light the darkest, warm the coldest heart.    Sweet infancy! life's solace and its rest,    Driving away the loneliness of age,    Wreathing in smiles the wrinkled brow of care,    Nectar to joyful, balm to troubled hearts,    Joyful once more is King Suddhodana;    A placid joy beams from that mother's face;    Joy lit the palace, flew from street to street,    And from the city over hill and plain;      Joy filled the prince's agitated soul--    He felt a power, from whence he could not tell,    Drawing away, he knew not where it led.    He knew the dreaded separation near,    Yet half its pain and bitterness was passed.    He need not leave his loved ones comfortless--    His loving people still would have their prince,    The king in young Rahula have his son,    And sweet Yasodhara, his very life,    Would have that nearest, dearest comforter    To soothe her cares and drive away her tears.[1]      But now strange dreams disturb the good old king--    Dreams starting him in terror from his sleep,    Yet seeming prophecies of coming good.    He dreamed he saw the flag his fathers loved    In tatters torn and trailing in the dust,    But in its place another glorious flag,    Whose silken folds seemed woven thick with gems    That as it waved glittered with dazzling light.    He dreamed he saw proud embassies from far    Bringing the crowns and scepters of the earth,    Bowing in reverence before the prince,    Humbly entreating him to be their king--    From whom he fled in haste as if in fear.    Then dreamed he saw his son in tattered robes    Begging from Sudras for his daily bread.    Again, he dreamed he saw the ancient tower    Where he in worship had so often knelt,    Rising and shining clothed with living light,    And on its top the prince, beaming with love,    Scattering with lavish hand the richest gems    On eager crowds that caught them as they fell.    But soon it vanished, and he saw a hill,    Rugged and bleak, cliff crowned and bald and bare,    And there he saw the prince, kneeling alone,    Wasted with cruel fastings till his bones    Clave to his skin, and in his sunken eyes    With fitful flicker gleamed the lamp of life    Until they closed, and on the ground he sank,    As if in death or in a deadly swoon;    And then the hill sank to a spreading plain,    Stretching beyond the keenest vision's ken,    Covered with multitudes as numberless    As ocean's sands or autumn's forest leaves;    And mounted on a giant elephant,    White as the snows on Himalaya's peaks,    The prince rode through their midst in royal state,    And as he moved along he heard a shout,    Rising and swelling, like the mighty voice    Of many waters breaking on the shore:    \"All hail! great Chakravartin, king of kings!    Hail! king of righteousness!  Hail! prince of peace!\"      Strange dreams!  Where is their birthplace--where their home?    Lighter than foam upon the crested wave,    Fleeter than shadows of the passing cloud,    They are of such fantastic substance made    That quick as thought they change their fickle forms--    Now grander than the waking vision views,    Now stranger than the wildest fancy feigns,    And now so grim and terrible they start    The hardened conscience from its guilty sleep.    In troops they come, trooping they fly away,    Waved into being by the magic wand    Of some deep purpose of the inmost soul,    Some hidden joy or sorrow, guilt or fear--    Or better, as the wise of old believed,    Called into being by some heavenly guest    To soothe, to warn, instruct or terrify.      Strange dreams by night and troubled thoughts by day    Disturb the prince and banish quiet sleep.    He dreamed that darkness, visible and dense,    Shrouded the heavens and brooded o'er the earth,    Whose rayless, formless, vacant nothingness    Curdled his blood and made his eyeballs ache;    When suddenly from out this empty void    A cloud, shining with golden light, was borne    By gentle winds, loaded with sweet perfumes,    Sweeter than spring-time on this earth can yield.    The cloud passed just above him, and he saw    Myriads of cherub faces looking down,    Sweet as Rahula, freed from earthly stain;    Such faces mortal brush could never paint--    Enraptured Raphael ne'er such faces saw.    But still the outer darkness hovered near,    And ever and anon a bony hand    Darts out to snatch some cherub face away.    Then dreamed he saw a broad and pleasant land,    With cities, gardens, groves and fruitful fields,    Where bee-fed flowers half hide the ripening fruits.    And spicy breezes stir the trembling leaves,    And many birds make sweetest melody,    But bordered by a valley black as night,    That ever vomits from its sunless depths    Great whirling clouds of suffocating smoke,    Blacker than hide the burning Aetna's head,    Blacker than over Lake Avernus hung;    No bird could fly above its fatal fumes;    Eagles, on tireless pinions upward borne,    In widening circles rising toward the sun,    Venturing too near its exhalations, fall,    As sinks the plummet in the silent sea;    And lions, springing on their antlered prey,    Drop still and lifeless on its deadly brink;    Only the jackal's dismal howl is heard    To break its stillness and eternal sleep.    He was borne forward to the very verge    Of this dark valley, by some power unseen.    A wind that pierced his marrow parts the clouds,    And far within, below he saw a sight    That stood his hair on end, beaded his brow    With icy drops, and made his blood run cold;    He saw a lofty throne, blacker than jet,    But shining with a strange and baleful light    That made him shade his blinded, dazzled eyes,    And seated on that throne a ghastly form    That seemed a giant human skeleton,    But yet in motion terrible and quick    As lightning, killing ere the thunders roll;    His fleshless skull had on a seeming crown,    While from his sunken sockets glared his eyes    Like coals of fire or eyes of basilisk,    And from his bony hand each instant flew    Unerring darts that flew to pierce and kill,    Piercing the infant in its mother's arms,    The mother when she feels her first-born's breath,    Piercing the father in his happy home,    Piercing the lover tasting love's first kiss,    Piercing the vanquished when his"]]]
