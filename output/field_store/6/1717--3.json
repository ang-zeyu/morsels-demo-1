If this representative is what it purports on its face to be, each  and every one who receives it in exchange for services or commodities,  owns not merely a piece of paper, with designs, words and promises  printed or engraved thereon, but an interest or an undivided whole in  a farm, a block of buildings or a store well stocked with merchandise,  which, in his estimation, at least, is more desirable to him than the  labor or commodity for which he has voluntarily made the exchange;  but, if on the contrary, it is other than what it purports on its face  to be, he finds that he is the owner of a piece of paper whose value  is _nil_.    There is, at the present writing, 1884, nearly eight hundred million  dollars of paper currency in the United States, consisting of  greenbacks and national currency, a great portion of which is in  actual circulation, and it has been estimated by eminent authorities,  who occupy positions of trust in the various departments through  which the financial machinery of this vast sea of paper money is daily  circulated, that there is in circulation nearly one-fifth of this  amount in counterfeit money, or about one hundred and sixty million  dollars; and not one dollar of this counterfeit money owes its  circulation to any excellence of the work in its manufacture, but  wholly to the general ignorance of those who handle it, as to what  is required to constitute a genuine bill. The time will come when the  United States will redeem all of its issue of paper money, when those  who are holding any of this counterfeit money will have to stand the  loss to the extent of the sum in their possession. To all of those who  are willing to take a small portion of their time each day for a few  weeks in learning just what it takes to constitute a genuine bill,  there need be no necessity of ever losing anything by counterfeiters,  as it is impossible for them to make bills which will in any way  approach the beauty and exactness of the genuine ones. There is not at  the present time, nor has there ever been in the past, nor will there  ever be in the future, a counterfeit bill made that cannot be detected  at sight; and the positive knowledge of how to know at all times when  a bill is genuine and when not is within the reach of all those  who may have the privilege of reading the following information  or infallible rules with a genuine desire to be benefited thereby.      DEVICES AND FRAUDS.    Various devices are resorted to by a numerous gang or body of persons,  to get on in the world without turning their attention to legitimate  and useful employments. This class includes many that are not engaged  in the practice of counterfeiting and putting forth bad money, but who  make themselves felt in various ways through vain tricks and schemes,  which are, to all intents and purposes, frauds.    Business men are generally apt at detecting and turning off petty  schemes, but they find it best to have the means with which they  may deal successfully as against regular swindlers, forgers and  counterfeiters.      COUNTERFEIT AND GENUINE WORK.    [Illustration: DETECTING COUNTERFEIT MONEY]    As indicated above, counterfeit notes are issued and put into the  channels of circulation in abundance every year by those engaged  in the practice of counterfeiting. These notes are often such good  imitations of the genuine that it is quite difficult to discern the  difference.    That he may protect himself, each business man should have some  definite knowledge of a genuine bank-note.    The engraving of a genuine bank note, in most all of its parts, is  done by machinery, and it is more exact and perfect. On the contrary,  most all parts of counterfeit notes are done by hand.    Counterfeiters cannot afford to purchase machinery, such as is used  for the production of genuine notes. The cost of such machinery is  between $100,000, and $150,000, and if it were in wrong hands it would  be always liable to seizure and confiscation.    In order to prevent the forgery of bank-notes, a great deal of  ingenuity and art has been expended on their production. The principal  features of the manufacture are described as a peculiar kind of paper  and water mark; an elaborate design, printed with a peculiar kind of  ink, and certain private marks, known only by the bank officials.    The work of counterfeiters can never equal that of the makers of  genuine notes, whose skill and facilities for producing the highest  grade of work known to the art, are the best that the world affords.    Unless one is somewhat learned as to the quality of engraving, that he  may be able to distinguish a fine specimen of the art when he sees it,  he is likely to become a victim of the counterfeiter's operations.      LATHE WORK.    When the genuineness of a bank-note is doubted, the Lathe Work on  the note should first be closely scrutinized. The several letters  of denomination, circles, ovals, and shadings between and around the  letters in the words, etc., are composed of numberless extremely fine  lines--inclusive of lines straight, curved and network. These are all  regular and unbroken, never running into each other, and may be traced  throughout with a magnifying glass.    Without the skill or machinery, by which the genuine is produced, the  same quality of work cannot be done. Therefore, in a counterfeit, the  lines are imperfect, giving the paper a dull or hazy aspect, that may  be all the better appreciated by comparing it with the genuine. The  lines in the counterfeit will be found now and then irregular in size,  and broken: not uniform in course, sometimes heavy, sometimes light:  no two stamps or dies on the same note being exactly alike.    The fine, uniform, shade-lines, with which the letters on the genuine  are embellished, are wrought by a machine that cannot be reproduced  by counterfeiters, nor used for other than legitimate purposes, by  authority.      GEOMETRICAL LATHE.    The fine line is the characteristic of the various and beautiful  figures which are seen on a genuine note. This line is produced  by what is called the Geometrical Lathe. The patterns made by the  geometrical lathe are of every variety of form. They are not engraved  directly upon the bank-note plate, but on pieces of soft steel plate,  which are afterwards hardened. The impressions are then transferred  to a soft steel roller, which, in its turn, is also hardened, and the  impressions remain there, in relief. This roller is then capable of  transferring the same designs to the bank-note plate by means of the  transfer press.    In counterfeit engraving, the design is made directly upon the plate,  and not by transfer, as in the production of plates for genuine notes.  The essential difference between the two methods of production is, the  counterfeit is made by hand, and is inexact and imperfect, while the  genuine is made on geometrical principles, and is therefore exact,  artistic and beautiful.    In all the government issues the geometric lathe work is liberally  used. This should be studied carefully, as it constitutes the chief  test of genuineness.    Fine lines, of unerring exactness, never broken, are seen on the  genuine medallion heads, or shields, upon which the designation of  the note is sometimes stamped. This nicety cannot be given by hand, or  with the use of imperfect machinery. By close scrutiny the lines will  be found to break off in the pattern, or appear forked, irregular in  size, and not well defined throughout.    [Illustration]    On most counterfeits the vignettes are not well engraved, and the  portraits have a dull appearance; the letters are usually wanting in  clearness; the printing is sometimes faulty, by which some features of  the note are obscured.      RULING ENGINE WORK.    In Ruling Engine Work, as it is called, the fine line is present,  also. The engraving is produced and transferred in the same way as the  geometrical lathe work. In this they are parallel and not in circles.  Those which constitute the shading of letters are so fine that they  form a perfectly even gray shade. They may be printed so that the  shading will appear darker, but the aspect will be uniform. The spaces  between lines are exact, whether the lines be horizontal or diagonal.  The lines are also made crooked or wave-like, not absolutely parallel.  Ruling engine work is generally used for shading of names of banks,  and also for the names of town, state, etc.      VIGNETTES.    While lathe work and that of the ruling engine are invariably  machine work, and therefore cannot be successfully reproduced by  counterfeiters, the Vignettes are chiefly the work of the hands. In  all genuine work they are made by first class artists, who are well  paid for their services, and who therefore have no incentive to  exercise their skill for illegitimate purposes.    Sometimes water and sky are done with the ruling engine, and when they  are, no counterfeiter can successfully imitate them. Fine vignettes  are seldom seen on counterfeit notes. If the lathe and ruling engine  work be genuine, an ordinary vignette cannot make a note counterfeit,  and if that be counterfeit, no vignette can make the note genuine.    The vignettes on genuine notes are executed by men at the head of  their vocation, and are very life-like and beautiful. Counterfeit  vignettes usually have a sunken and lifeless appearance. Genuine  vignettes, as seen upon government issues, consist of out-door scenes,  portraits, historical pictures, and allegorical figures. They are all  exceedingly beautiful, and it is not likely that such work will ever  be successfully imitated.      SOLID PRINT.    The lettering, or solid "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14107"],[0,"The Lost Stradivarius (#10)"],[1,"ents, from the number and great  size of its reception-rooms. Though Elizabethan in date and external  appearance, succeeding generations had much modified and enlarged the  house; and an ancestor in the middle of the last century had built at  the back an enormous hall after the classic model, and covered it with a  dome or cupola. In this room the dancing went forward. Supper was served  in the older hall in the front, and it was while this was in progress  that a thunderstorm began. The rarity of such a phenomenon in the depth  of winter formed the subject of general remark; but though the lightning  was extremely brilliant, being seen distinctly through the curtained  windows, the storm appeared to be at some distance, and, except for one  peal, the thunder was not loud. After supper dancing was resumed, and  I was taking part in a polka (called, I remember, the \"_King Pippin_\"),  when my partner pointed out that one of the footmen wished to speak with  me. I begged him to lead me to one side, and the servant then informed  me that my brother was ill. Sir John, he said, had been seized with a  fainting fit, but had been got to bed, and was being attended by Dr.  Empson, a physician who chanced to be present among the visitors.    I at once left the hall and hurried to my brother's room. On the way  I met Mrs. Temple and Constance, the latter much agitated and in tears.  Mrs. Temple assured me that Dr. Empson reported favourably of my  brother's condition, attributing his faintness to over-exertion in the  dancing-room. The medical man had got him to bed with the assistance of  Sir John's valet, had given him a quieting draught, and ordered that he  should not be disturbed for the present. It was better that I should not  enter the room; she begged that I would kindly comfort and reassure  Constance, who was much upset, while she herself returned to her guests.    I led Constance to my bedroom, where there was a bright fire burning,  and calmed her as best I could. Her interest in my brother was evidently  very real and unaffected, and while not admitting her partiality for him  in words, she made no effort to conceal her sentiments from me. I kissed  her tenderly, and bade her narrate the circumstances of John's attack.    It seemed that after supper they had gone upstairs into the music-room,  and he had himself proposed that they should walk thence into the  picture-gallery, where they would better he able to see the lightning,  which was then particularly vivid. The picture-gallery at Royston is a  very long, narrow, and rather low room, running the whole length of the  south wing, and terminating in a large Tudor oriel or flat bay window  looking east. In this oriel they had sat for some time watching the  flashes, and the wintry landscape revealed for an instant and then  plunged into outer blackness. The gallery itself was not illuminated,  and the effect of the lightning was very fine.    There had been an unusually bright flash accompanied by that single  reverberating peal of thunder which I had previously noticed. Constance  had spoken to my brother, but he had not replied, and in a moment she  saw that he had swooned. She summoned aid without delay, but it was some  short time before consciousness had been restored to him.    She had concluded this narrative, and sat holding my hand in hers. We  were speculating on the cause of my brother's illness, thinking it might  be due to over-exertion, or to sitting in a chilly atmosphere as the  picture-gallery was not warmed, when Mrs. Temple knocked at the door and  said that John was now more composed and desired earnestly to see me.    On entering my brother's bedroom I found him sitting up in bed wearing a  dressing-gown. Parnham, his valet, who was arranging the fire, left the  room as I came in. A chair stood at the head of the bed and I sat down  by him. He took my hand in his and without a word burst into tears.  \"Sophy,\" he said, \"I am so unhappy, and I have sent for you to tell you  of my trouble, because I know you will be forbearing to me. An hour  ago all seemed so bright. I was sitting in the picture-gallery with  Constance, whom I love dearly. We had been watching the lightning, till  the thunder had grown fainter and the storm seemed past. I was just  about to ask her to become my wife when a brighter flash than all the  rest burst on us, and I saw--I saw, Sophy, standing in the gallery as  close to me as you are now--I saw--that man I told you about at Oxford;  and then this faintness came on me.\"    \"Whom do you mean?\" I said, not understanding what he spoke of, and  thinking for a moment he referred to someone else. \"Did you see Mr.  Gaskell?\"    \"No, it was not he; but that dead man whom I saw rising from my wicker  chair the night you went away from Oxford.\"    You will perhaps smile at my weakness, my dear Edward, and indeed I had  at that time no justification for it; but I assure you that I have not  yet forgotten, and never shall forget, the impression of overwhelming  horror which his words produced upon me. It seemed as though a fear  which had hitherto stood vague and shadowy in the background, began now  to advance towards me, gathering more distinctness as it approached.  There was to me something morbidly terrible about the apparition of this  man at such a momentous crisis in my brother's life, and I at once  recognised that unknown form as being the shadow which was gradually  stealing between John and myself. Though I feigned incredulity as best  I might, and employed those arguments or platitudes which will always be  used on such occasions, urging that such a phantom could only exist in a  mind disordered by physical weakness, my brother was not deceived by my  words, and perceived in a moment that I did not even believe in them  myself.    \"Dearest Sophy,\" he said, with a much calmer air, \"let us put aside all  dissimulation. I _know_ that what I have to-night seen, and that what I  saw last summer at Oxford, are _not_ phantoms of my brain; and I believe  that you too in your inmost soul are convinced of this truth. Do not,  therefore, endeavour to persuade me to the contrary. If I am not to  believe the evidence of my senses, it were better at once to admit my  madness--and I know that I am not mad. Let us rather consider what such  an appearance can portend, and who the man is who is thus presented.  I cannot explain to you why this appearance inspires me with so great  a revulsion. I can only say that in its presence I seem to be brought  face to face with some abysmal and repellent wickedness. It is not that  the form he wears is hideous. Last night I saw him exactly as I saw him  at Oxford--his face waxen pale, with a sneering mouth, the same lofty  forehead, and hair brushed straight up so as almost to appear standing  on end. He wore the same long coat of green cloth and white waistcoat.  He seemed as if he had been standing listening to what we said, though  we had not seen him till this bright flash of lightning made him  manifest. You will remember that when I saw him at Oxford his eyes were  always cast down, so that I never knew their colour. This time they were  wide open; indeed he was looking full at us, and they were a light brown  and very brilliant.\"    I saw that my brother was exciting himself, and was still weak from his  recent swoon. I knew, too, that any ordinary person of strong mind would  say at once that his brain wandered, and yet I had a dreadful conviction  all the while that what he told me was the truth. All I could do was to  beg him to calm himself, and to reflect how vain such fancies must be.  \"We must trust, dear John,\" I said, \"in God. I am sure that so long as  we are not living in conscious sin, we shall never be given over to any  evil power; and I know my brother too well to think that he is doing  anything he knows to be evil. If there be evil spirits, as we are taught  there are, we are taught also that there are good spirits stronger than  they, who will protect us.\"    So I spoke with him a little while, until he grew calmer; and then we  talked of Constance and of his love for her. He was deeply pleased to  hear from me how she had shown such obvious, signs of interest in his  illness, and sincere affection for him. In any case, he made me promise  that I would never mention to her either what he had seen this night or  last summer at Oxford.    It had grown late, and the undulating beat of the dances, which had  been distinctly sensible in his room--even though we could not hear  any definite noise--had now ceased. Mrs. Temple knocked at the door as  she went to bed and inquired how he did, giving him at the same time  a kind message of sympathy from Constance, which afforded him much  gratification. After she had left I prepared also to retire; but before  going he begged me to take a prayer-book lying on the table, and to read  aloud a collect which he pointed out. It was that for the second Sunday  in Lent, and evidently well known to him. As I read it the words seemed  to bear a new and deeper significance, and my heart repeated with  fervour the petition for protection from those \"evil thoughts which may  assault and hurt the soul.\" I bade him good night and went away very  sorrowful. Parnham, at John's request, had arranged to sleep on a sofa  in his master's bedroom.    I rose betimes the next morning and inquired at my brother's room how  he was. Parnham reported that he had passed a restless night, and on  entering a little later I found him in a high fever, slightly delirious,  and evidently not so well as when I saw him last. Mrs. Temple, with much  kindness and forethought, had begged Dr. Empson to remain at Royston for  the night, and he was soon in attendance on his patient. His verdict  was sufficiently grave: John was suffering from a sharp access of  brain-fever; his condition afforded cause for alarm; he could not answer  for any turn his sickness"]]]
