The author  has not now changed their character as such, for it seemed to him that to  convert them into formal essays would be to rob them of any little  attraction they may possess.    One of the addresses--that on \"Medieval Wayfaring\"--was originally spoken  in Hebrew, in Jerusalem. It was published, in part, in English in the  London _Jewish Chronicle_, and the author is indebted to the conductors of  that periodical for permission to include this, and other material, in the  present collection.    Some others of the chapters have been printed before, but a considerable  proportion of the volume is quite new, and even those addresses that are  reprinted are now given in a fuller and much revised text.    As several of the papers were intended for popular audiences, the author is  persuaded that it would ill accord with his original design to overload the  book with notes and references. These have been supplied only where  absolutely necessary, and a few additional notes are appended at the end of  the volume.    The author realizes that the book can have little permanent value. But as  these addresses seemed to give pleasure to those who heard them, he thought  it possible that they might provide passing entertainment also to those who  are good enough to read them.

Yet his \"Book of Delight,\" finished about the year 1200, is  more than a poetical romance. It is a golden link between folk-literature  and imaginative poetry. The style is original, and the framework of the  story is an altogether fresh adaptation of a famous legend. The anecdotes  and epigrams introduced incidentally also partake of this twofold quality.  The author has made them his own, yet they are mostly adapted rather than  invented. Hence, the poem is as valuable to the folklorist as to the  literary critic. For, though Zabara's compilation is similar to such  well-known models as the \"Book of Sindbad,\" the _Kalilah ve-Dimnah_, and  others of the same class, yet its appearance in Europe is half a century  earlier than the translations by which these other products of the East  became part of the popular literature of the Western world. At the least,  then, the \"Book of Delight\" is an important addition to the scanty store of  the folk-lore records of the early part of the thirteenth century. The  folk-lore interest of the book is, indeed, greater than was known formerly,  for it is now recognized as a variant of the Solomon-Marcolf legend. On  this more will be said below,    As a poet and as a writer of Hebrew, Joseph Zabara's place is equally  significant. He was one of the first to write extended narratives in Hebrew  rhymed prose with interspersed snatches of verse, the form invented by  Arabian poets, and much esteemed as the medium for story-telling and for  writing social satire. The best and best-known specimens of this form of  poetry in Hebrew are Charizi's _Tachkemoni_, and his translation of Hariri.  Zabara has less art than Charizi, and far less technical skill, yet in him  all the qualities are in the bud that Charizi's poems present in the  fullblown flower. The reader of Zabara feels that other poets will develop  his style and surpass him; the reader of Charizi knows of a surety that in  him the style has reached its climax.    Of Joseph Zabara little is known beyond what may be gleaned from a  discriminating study of the \"Book of Delight.\" That this romance is largely  autobiographical in fact, as it is in form, there can be no reasonable  doubt. The poet writes with so much indignant warmth of the dwellers in  certain cities, of their manner of life, their morals, and their culture,  that one can only infer that he is relating his personal experiences.  Zabara, like the hero of his romance, travelled much during the latter  portion of the twelfth century, as is known from the researches of Geiger.  He was born in Barcelona, and returned there to die. In the interval, we  find him an apt pupil of Joseph Kimchi, in Narbonne. Joseph Kimchi, the  founder of the famous Kimchi family, carried the culture of Spain to  Provence; and Joseph Zabara may have acquired from Kimchi his mastery over  Hebrew, which he writes with purity and simplicity. The difficulties  presented in some passages of the \"Book of Delight\" are entirely due to the  corrupt state of the text. Joseph Kimchi, who flourished in Provence from  1150 to 1170, quotes Joseph Zabara twice, with approval, in explaining  verses in Proverbs. It would thus seem that Zabara, even in his student  days, was devoted to the proverb-lore on which he draws so lavishly in his  maturer work.    Dr. Steinschneider, to whom belongs the credit of rediscovering Zabara in  modern times, infers that the poet was a physician. There is more than  probability in the case; there is certainty. The romance is built by a  doctor; there is more talk of medicine in it than of any other topic of  discussion. Moreover, the author, who denies that he is much of a  Talmudist, accepts the compliment paid to him by his visitor, Enan, that he  is \"skilled and well-informed in the science of medicine.\" There is, too, a  professional tone about many of the quips and gibes in which Zabara  indulges concerning doctors. Here, for instance, is an early form of a  witticism that has been attributed to many recent humorists. \"A  philosopher,\" says Zabara, \"was sick unto death, and his doctor gave him  up; yet the patient recovered. The convalescent was walking in the street  when the doctor met him. 'You come,' said he, 'from the other world.'  'Yes,' rejoined the patient, 'I come from there, and I saw there the awful  retribution that falls on doctors; for they kill their patients. Yet, do  not feel alarmed. You will not suffer. I told them on my oath that you are  no doctor.'\"    Again, in one of the poetical interludes (found only in the Constantinople  edition) occurs this very professional sneer, \"A doctor and the Angel of  Death both kill, but the former charges a fee.\" Who but a doctor would  enter into a scathing denunciation of the current system of diagnosis, as  Zabara does in a sarcastic passage, which Erter may have imitated  unconsciously? And if further proof be needed that Zabara was a man of  science, the evidence is forthcoming; for Zabara appeals several times to  experiment in proof of his assertions. And to make assurance doubly sure,  the author informs his readers in so many words of his extensive medical  practice in his native place.    If Zabara be the author of the other, shorter poems that accompany the  \"Book of Delight\" in the Constantinople edition, though they are not  incorporated into the main work, we have a further indication that Zabara  was a medical man. There is a satirical introduction against the doctors  that slay a man before his time. The author, with mock timidity, explains  that he withholds his name, lest the medical profession turn its attention  to him with fatal results. \"Never send for a doctor,\" says the satirist,  \"for one cannot expect a miracle to happen.\" It is important, for our  understanding of another feature in Zabara's work, to observe that his  invective, directed against the practitioners rather than the science of  medicine, is not more curious as coming from a medical man, than are the  attacks on women perpetrated by some Jewish poets (Zabara among them), who  themselves amply experienced, in their own and their community's life, the  tender and beautiful relations that subsist between Jewish mother and son,  Jewish wife and husband.    The life of Joseph ben Meir Zabara was not happy. He left Barcelona in  search of learning and comfort. He found the former, but the latter eluded  him. It is hard to say from the \"Book of Delight\" whether he was a  woman-hater, or not. On the one hand, he says many pretty things about  women. The moral of the first section of the romance is: Put your trust in  women; and the moral of the second section of the poem is: A good woman is  the best part of man. But, though this is so, Zabara does undoubtedly quote  a large number of stories full of point and sting, stories that tell of  women's wickedness and infidelity, of their weakness of intellect and  fickleness of will. His philogynist tags hardly compensate for his  misogynist satires. He runs with the hare, but hunts energetically with the  hounds.    It is this characteristic of Zabara's method that makes it open to doubt,  whether the additional stories referred to as printed with the  Constantinople edition did really emanate from our author's pen. These  additions are sharply misogynist; the poet does not even attempt to blunt  their point. They include \"The Widow's Vow\" (the widow, protesting undying  constancy to her first love, eagerly weds another) and \"Woman's  Contentions.\" In the latter, a wicked woman is denounced with the wildest  invective. She has demoniac traits; her touch is fatal.

The events which  have taken place within the limits of what is now the United States must  necessarily furnish the most of the content of the lessons. But the  Committee urge that enough other matter, of an introductory character,  be included to teach boys and girls of from twelve to fourteen years of  age that our civilization had its beginnings far back in the history of  the Old World. Such introductory study will enable them to think of our  country in its true historical setting. The Committee recommend that  about two-thirds of one year's work be devoted to this preliminary  matter, and that the remainder of the year be given to the period of  discovery and exploration.    The plan of the Committee of Eight emphasizes three or four lines of  development in the world's history leading up to American  history proper.    First, there was a movement of conquest or colonization by which the  ancient civilized world, originally made up of communities like the  Greeks and Phoenicians in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean Seas,  spread to southern Italy and adjacent lands. The Roman conquest of Italy  and of the barbarian tribes of western Europe expanded the civilized  world to the shores of the Atlantic. Within this greater Roman world new  nations grew up. The migration of Europeans to the American continent  was the final step.    Second, accompanying the growth of the civilized world in extent was a  growth of knowledge of the shape of the earth, or of what we call  geography. Columbus was a geographer as well as the herald of an  expanding world.    A third process was the creation and transmission of all that we mean by  civilization. Here, as the Committee remark, the effort should be to  \"show, in a very simple way, the civilization which formed the heritage  of those who were to go to America, that is, to explain what America  started with.\"    The Committee also suggest that it is necessary \"to associate the three  or four peoples of Europe which were to have a share in American  colonization with enough of their characteristic incidents to give the  child some feeling for the name 'England,' 'Spain,' 'Holland,' and  'France.'\"    No attempt is made in this book to give a connected history of Greece,  Rome, England, or any other country of Europe. Such an attempt would be  utterly destructive of the plan. Only those features of early  civilization and those incidents of history have been selected which  appear to have a vital relation to the subsequent fortunes of mankind in  America as well as in Europe. They are treated in all cases as  introductory. Opinions may differ upon the question of what topics best  illustrate the relation. The Committee leaves a wide margin of  opportunity for the exercise of judgment in selection. In the use of a  textbook based on the plan the teacher should use the same liberty of  selection. For example, we have chosen the story of Marathon to  illustrate the idea of the heroic memories of Greece. Others may prefer  Thermopylae, because this story seems to possess a simpler dramatic  development. In the same way teachers may desire to give more emphasis  to certain phases of ancient or mediaeval civilization or certain heroic  persons treated very briefly in this book. Exercises similar to those  inserted at the end of each chapter offer means of supplementing work  provided in the text.    The story of American discovery and exploration in the plan of the  Committee of Eight follows the introductory matter as a natural  culmination. In our textbook we have adhered to the same plan of  division. The work of the seventh grade will, therefore, open with the  study of the first permanent English settlements.    The discoveries and explorations are told in more detail than most of  the earlier incidents, but whatever is referred to is treated, we hope,  with such simplicity and definiteness of statement that it will be  comprehensible and instructive to pupils of the sixth grade.    At the close of the book will be found a list of references. From this  teachers may draw a rich variety of stories and descriptions to  illustrate any features of the subject which especially interest their  classes. In the index is given the pronunciation of difficult names.    We wish to express gratitude to those who have aided us with wise advice  and criticism.

The emigrant who lands    at New York, Boston, Philadelphia, or any other seaport, brings with    him something which we do not see. He may have in his hands only a    small bundle of clothing and enough money to pay his railroad fare to    his new home, but he is carrying another kind of baggage more valuable    than bundles or boxes or a pocket full of silver or gold. This other    baggage is the knowledge, the customs, and the memories he has brought    from the fatherland.      He has already learned in Europe how to do the work at which he hopes    to labor in America. In his native land he has been taught to obey the    laws and to do his duty as a citizen. This fits him to share in our    self-government. He also brings great memories, for he likes to think    of the brave and noble deeds done by men of his race. If he is a    religious man, he worships God just as his forefathers have for    hundreds of years. To understand how the emigrant happens to know what    he does and to be what he is, we must study the history of the country    from which he comes.    ALL AMERICANS ARE EMIGRANTS. If this is true of the newcomer, it is    equally true of the rest of us, for we are all emigrants. The Indians    are the only native Americans, and when we find out more about them we    may learn that they, too, are emigrants. If we follow the history of    our families far enough back, we shall come upon the names of our    forefathers who sailed from Europe. They may have come to America in    the early days when there were only a few settlements scattered along    our Atlantic coast, or they may have come since the Revolutionary War    changed the English colonies into the United States.      Like the Canadians, the South Americans, and the Australians, we are    simply Europeans who have moved away. The story of the Europe in which    our forefathers lived is, therefore, part of our story. In order to    understand our own history we must know something of the history of    England, France, Germany, Italy, and other European lands.    WHAT THE EARLY EMIGRANTS BROUGHT. If we read the story of our    forefathers before they left Europe, we shall find answers to several    important questions. Why, we ask, did Columbus seek for new lands or    for new ways to lands already known? How did the people of Europe live    at the time he discovered America? What did they know how to do? Were    they skilful in all sorts of work, or were they as rude and ignorant    as the Indians on the western shores of the Atlantic?      The answers which history will give to these questions will say that    the first emigrants who landed on our shores brought with them much of    the same knowledge and many of the same customs and memories which    emigrants bring nowadays and which we also have. It is true that since    the time the first settlers came men have found out how to make many    new things. The most important of these are the steam-engine, the    electric motor, the telegraph, and the telephone. But it is surprising    how many important things, which we still use, were made before    Columbus saw America.      [Illustration: A MODERN STEAMSHIP AND AN EARLY SAILING VESSEL    The early emigrants came in small sailing vessels and suffered great    hardships]      For one thing, men knew how to print books. This art had been    discovered during the boyhood of Columbus. Another thing, men could    make guns, while the Indians had only bows and arrows. The ships in    which Columbus sailed across the ocean seemed very large and wonderful    to the Indians, who used canoes. The ships were steered with the help    of a compass, an instrument which the Indians had never seen.      Some of the things which the early emigrants knew had been known    hundreds or thousands of years"]]]
