In religious circles far from courts and cities, as we might expect,  homosexuality was regarded with great horror, though even here we may  discover evidence of its wide prevalence. Thus in the remarkable  _Revelation_ of the Monk of Evesham, written in English in 1196, we find  that in the very worst part of Purgatory are confined an innumerable  company of sodomists (including a wealthy, witty, and learned divine, a  doctor of laws, personally known to the Monk), and whether these people  would ever be delivered from Purgatory was a matter of doubt; of the  salvation of no other sinners does the Monk of Evesham seem so dubious.    Sodomy had always been an ecclesiastical offense. The Statute of 1533 (25  Henry VIII, c. 6) made it a felony; and Pollock and Maitland consider that  this \"affords an almost sufficient proof that the temporal courts had not  punished it, and that no one had been put to death for it, for a very long  time past.\"[82] The temporal law has never, however, proved very  successful in repressing homosexuality. At this period the Renaissance  movement was reaching England, and here as elsewhere it brought with it,  if not an increase, at all events a rehabilitation and often an  idealization of homosexuality.[83]    An eminent humanist and notable pioneer in dramatic literature, Nicholas  Udall, to whom is attributed _Ralph Roister Doister_, the first English  comedy, stands out as unquestionably addicted to homosexual tastes,  although he has left no literary evidence of this tendency. He was an  early adherent of the Protestant movement, and when head-master of Eton he  was noted for his love of inflicting corporal punishment on the boys.  Tusser says he once received from Udall 53 stripes for \"fault but small or  none at all.\" Here there was evidently a sexual sadistic impulse, for in  1541 (the year of _Ralph Roister Doister_) Udall was charged with  unnatural crime and confessed his guilt before the Privy Council. He was  dismissed from the head-mastership and imprisoned, but only for a short  time, \"and his reputation,\" his modern biographer states, \"was not  permanently injured.\" He retained the vicarage of Braintree, and was much  favored by Edward VI, who nominated him to a prebend of Windsor. Queen  Mary was also favorable and he became head-master of Westminster  School.[84]    An Elizabethan lyrical poet of high quality, whose work has had the honor  of being confused with Shakespeare's, Richard Barnfield, appears to have  possessed the temperament, at least, of the invert. His poems to male  friends are of so impassioned a character that they aroused the protests  of a very tolerant age. Very little is known of Barnfield's life. Born in  1574 he published his first poem, _The Affectionate Shepherd_, at the age  of 20, while still at the University. It was issued anonymously, revealed  much fresh poetic feeling and literary skill, and is addressed to a youth  of whom the poet declares:--        \"If it be sin to love a lovely lad,      Oh then sin I.\"    In his subsequent volume, _Cynthia_ (1595), Barnfield disclaims any  intention in the earlier poem beyond that of imitating Virgil's second  eclogue. But the sonnets in this second volume are even more definitely  homosexual than the earlier poem, though he goes on to tell how at last he  found a lass whose beauty surpassed that              \"of the swain      Whom I never could obtain.\"    After the age of 31 Barnfield wrote no more, but, being in easy  circumstances, retired to his beautiful manor house and country estate in  Shropshire, lived there for twenty years and died leaving a wife and  son.[85] It seems probable that he was of bisexual temperament, and that,  as not infrequently happens in such cases, the homosexual element  developed early under the influence of a classical education and  university associations, while the normal heterosexual element developed  later and, as may happen in bisexual persons, was associated with the more  commonplace and prosaic side of life. Barnfield was only a genuine poet on  the homosexual side of his nature.    Greater men of that age than Barnfield may be suspected of homosexual  tendencies. Marlowe, whose most powerful drama, _Edward II_, is devoted to  a picture of the relations between that king and his minions, is himself  suspected of homosexuality. An ignorant informer brought certain charges  of freethought and criminality against him, and further accused him of  asserting that they are fools who love not boys. These charges have  doubtless been colored by the vulgar channel through which they passed,  but it seems absolutely impossible to regard them as the inventions of a  mere gallows-bird such as this informer was.[86] Moreover, Marlowe's  poetic work, while it shows him by no means insensitive to the beauty of  women, also reveals a special and peculiar sensitiveness to masculine  beauty. Marlowe clearly had a reckless delight in all things unlawful, and  it seems probable that he possessed the bisexual temperament. Shakespeare  has also been discussed from this point of view. All that can be said,  however, is that he addressed a long series of sonnets to a youthful male  friend. These sonnets are written in lover's language of a very tender and  noble order. They do not appear to imply any relationship that the writer  regarded as shameful or that would be so regarded by the world. Moreover,  they seem to represent but a single episode in the life of a very  sensitive, many-sided nature.[87] There is no other evidence in  Shakespeare's work of homosexual instinct such as we may trace throughout  Marlowe's, while there is abundant evidence of a constant preoccupation  with women.    While Shakespeare thus narrowly escapes inclusion in the list of  distinguished inverts, there is much better ground for the inclusion of  his great contemporary, Francis Bacon. Aubrey in his laboriously compiled  _Short Lives_, in which he shows a friendly and admiring attitude toward  Bacon, definitely states that he was a pederast. Aubrey was only a careful  gleaner of frequently authentic gossip, but a similar statement is made by  Sir Simonds D'Ewes in his _Autobiography_. D'Ewes, whose family belonged  to the same part of Suffolk as Bacon's sprang from, was not friendly to  Bacon, but that fact will not suffice to account for his statement. He was  an upright and honorable man of scholarly habits, and, moreover, a trained  lawyer, who had many opportunities of obtaining first-hand information,  for he had lived in the Chancery office from childhood. He is very precise  as to Bacon's homosexual practices with his own servants, both before and  after his fall, and even gives the name of a \"very effeminate-faced youth\"  who was his \"catamite and bedfellow\"; he states, further, that there had  been some question of bringing Bacon to trial for sodomy. These  allegations may be supported by a letter of Bacon's own mother (printed in  Spedding's _Life of Bacon_), reproving him on account of what she had  heard concerning his behavior with the young Welshmen in his service whom  he made his bedfellows. It is notable that Bacon seems to have been  specially attracted to Welshmen (one might even find evidence of this in  the life of the Welshman, Henry VII), a people of vivacious temperament  unlike his own; this is illustrated by his long and intimate friendship  with the mercurial Sir Toby Mathew, his \"alter ego,\" a man of dissipated  habits in early life, though we are not told that he was homosexual. Bacon  had many friendships with men, but there is no evidence that he was ever  in love or cherished any affectionate intimacy with a woman. Women play no  part at all in his life. His marriage, which was childless, took place at  the mature age of 46; it was effected in a business-like manner, and  though he always treated his wife with formal consideration it is probable  that he neglected her, and certain that he failed to secure her devotion;  it is clear that toward the end of Bacon's life she formed a relationship  with her gentleman usher, whom subsequently she married. Bacon's writings,  it may be added, equally with his letters, show no evidence of love or  attraction to women; in his _Essays_ he is brief and judicial on the  subject of Marriage, copious and eloquent on the subject of Friendship,  while the essay on Beauty deals exclusively with masculine beauty.    During the first half of the eighteenth century we have clear evidence  that homosexuality flourished in London with the features which it  presents today in all large cities everywhere. There was a generally known  name, \"Mollies,\" applied to homosexual persons, evidently having reference  to their frequently feminine characteristics; there were houses of private  resort for them (\"Molly houses\"), there were special public places of  rendezvous whither they went in search of adventure, exactly as there are  today. A walk in Upper Moorfields was especially frequented by the  homosexual about 1725. A detective employed by the police about that date  gave evidence as follows at the Old Bailey; \"I takes a turn that way and  leans over the wall. In a little time the prisoner passes by, and looks  hard at me, and at a small distance from me stands up against the wall as  if he was going to make water. Then by degrees he siddles nearer and  nearer to where I stood, till at last he was close to me. 'Tis a very fine  night,' says he. 'Aye,' say I, 'and so it is.' Then he takes me by the  hand, and after squeezing and playing with it a little, he conveys it to  his breeches,\" whereupon the detective seizes the man by his sexual organs  and holds him until the constable comes up and effects an arrest.    At the same period Margaret Clap, commonly called Mother Clap, kept a  house in Field Lane, Holborn, which was a noted resort of the homosexual.

I have preferred not to draw on any      of these easily accessible sources (except that in one or two      cases I have utilized references they supplied), but here simply      furnish illustrations met with in the course of my own reading.        Even in the hermaphroditic slugs (_Limax maximus_) the process of      courtship is slow and elaborate. It has been described by James      Bladon (\"The Loves of the Slug [_Limax cinereus_],\" _Zooelogist_,      vol. xv, 1857, p. 6272). It begins toward midnight on sultry      summer nights, one slug slowly following another, resting its      mouth on what may be called the tail of the first, and following      its every movement. Finally they stop and begin crawling around      each other, emitting large quantities of mucus. When this has      constituted a mass of sufficient size and consistence they      suspend themselves from it by a cord of mucus from nine to      fifteen inches in length, continuing to turn round each other      till their bodies form a cone. Then the organs of generation are      protruded from their orifice near the mouth and, hanging down a      short distance, touch each other. They also then begin again the      same spiral motion, twisting around each other, like a two-strand      cord, assuming various and beautiful forms, sometimes like an      inverted agaric, or a foliated murex, or a leaf of curled      parsley, the light falling on the ever-varying surface of the      generative organs sometimes producing iridescence. It is not      until after a considerable time that the organs untwist and are      withdrawn and the bodies separate, to crawl up the suspending      cord and depart.        Some snails have a special organ for creating sexual excitement.      A remarkable part of the reproductive system in many of the true      Helicidae is the so-called _dart, Liebespfeil_, or _telum      Veneris_. It consists of a straight or curved, sometimes      slightly twisted, tubular shaft of carbonate of lime, tapering to      a fine point above, and enlarging gradually, more often somewhat      abruptly, to the base. The sides of the shaft are sometimes      furnished with two or more blades; these are apparently not for      cutting purposes, but simply to brace the stem. The dart is      contained in a dart-sac, which is attached as a sort of pocket to      the vagina, at no great distance from its orifice. In _Helix      aspersa_ the dart is about five-sixteenths of an inch in length,      and one-eighth of an inch in breadth at its base. It appears most      probable that the dart is employed as an adjunct for the sexual      act. Besides the fact of the position of the dart-sac      anatomically, we find that the darts are extended and become      imbedded in the flesh, just before or during the act of      copulation. It may be regarded, then, as an organ whose functions      induce excitement preparatory to sexual union. It only occurs in      well-grown specimens. (Rev. L.H. Cooke, \"Molluscs,\" _Cambridge      Natural History_, vol. iii, p. 143.)        Racovitza has shown that in the octopus (_Octopus vulgaris_)      courtship is carried on with considerable delicacy, and not      brutally, as had previously been supposed. The male gently      stretches out his third arm on the right and caresses the female      with its extremity, eventually passing it into the chamber formed      by the mantle. The female contracts spasmodically, but does not      attempt to move. They remain thus about an hour or more, and      during this time the male shifts the arm from one oviduct to the      other. Finally he withdraws his arm, caresses her with it for a      few moments, and then replaces it with his other arm. (E.G.      Racovitza, in _Archives de Zooelogie Experimentale_, quoted in      _Natural Science_, November, 1894.)        The phenomena of courtship are very well illustrated by spiders.      Peckham, who has carefully studied them, tells us of _Saitis      pulex_: \"On May 24th we found a mature female, and placed her in      one of the larger boxes, and the next day we put a male in with      her. He saw her as she stood perfectly still, twelve inches away;      the glance seemed to excite him, and he at once moved toward her;      when some four inches from her he stood still, and then began the      most remarkable performances that an amorous male could offer to      an admiring female. She eyed him eagerly, changing her position      from time to time so that he might be always in view. He, raising      his whole body on one side by straightening out the legs, and      lowering it on the other by folding the first two pairs of legs      up and under, leaned so far over as to be in danger of losing his      balance, which he only maintained by sliding rapidly toward the      lowered side. The palpus, too, on this side was turned back to      correspond to the direction of the legs nearest it. He moved in a      semicircle for about two inches, and then instantly reversed the      position of the legs and circled in the opposite direction,      gradually approaching nearer and nearer to the female. Now she      dashes toward him, while he, raising his first pair of legs,      extends them upward and forward as if to hold her off, but withal      slowly retreats. Again and again he circles from side to side,      she gazing toward him in a softer mood, evidently admiring the      grace of his antics. This is repeated until we have counted one      hundred and eleven circles made by the ardent little male. Now he      approaches nearer and nearer, and when almost within reach whirls      madly around and around her, she joining and whirling with him in      a giddy maze. Again he falls back and resumes his semicircular      motions, with his body tilted over; she, all excitement, lowers      her head and raises her body so that it is almost vertical; both      draw nearer; she moves slowly under him, he crawling over her      head, and the mating is accomplished.\"        The same author thus describes the courtship of _Dendryphantes      elegans_: \"While from three to five inches distant from her, he      begins to wave his plumy first legs in a way that reminds one of      a windmill. She eyes him fiercely, and he keeps at a proper      distance for a long time. If he comes close she dashes at him,      and he quickly retreats. Sometimes he becomes bolder, and when      within an inch, pauses, with the first legs outstretched before      him, not raised as is common in other species; the palpi also are      held stiffly out in front with the points together. Again she      drives him off, and so the play continues. Now the male grows      excited as he approaches her, and while still several inches      away, whirls completely around and around; pausing, he runs      closer and begins to make his abdomen quiver as he stands on      tiptoe in front of her. Prancing from side to side, he grows      bolder and bolder, while she seems less fierce, and yielding to      the excitement, lifts up her magnificently iridescent abdomen,      holding it at one time vertical, and at another sideways to him.      She no longer rushes at him, but retreats a little as he      approaches. At last he comes close to her, lying flat, with his      first legs stretched out and quivering. With the tips of his      front legs he gently pats her; this seems to arouse the old demon      of resistance, and she drives him back. Again and again he pats      her with a caressing movement, gradually creeping nearer and      nearer, which she now permits without resistance, until he crawls      over her head to her abdomen, far enough to reach the epigynum      with his palpus.\" (G.W. Peckham, \"Sexual Selection of Spiders,\"      _Occasional Papers of the Natural History Society of Wisconsin_,      1889, quoted in _Nature_, August 21, 1890.)        The courtship of another spider, the _Agelena labyrinthica_, has      been studied by Lecaillon (\"Les Instincts et les Psychismes des      Araignees,\" _Revue Scientifique_, Sept. 15, 1906.) The male      enters the female's web and may be found there about the middle      of July. When courtship has begun it is not interrupted by the      closest observation, even under the magnifying glass. At first it      is the male which seeks to couple and he pursues the female over      her web till she consents. The pursuit may last some hours, the      male agitating his abdomen in a peculiar way, while the female      simply retreats a short distance without allowing herself to be      approached. At last the female holds herself completely      motionless, and then the male approaches, seizes her, places her      on her side, sometimes carrying her to a more suitable part of      the web. Then one of his copulative apparatus is applied to the      female genital opening, and copulation begins. When completed (on      an average in about two hours) the male withdraws his copulatory      palpus and turns over the female, who is still inert, on to her      other side, then brings his second copulatory apparatus to the      female opening and starts afresh. When the process is definitely      completed the male leaves the female, suddenly retiring to a      little distance. The female, who had remained completely      motionless for four hours, suddenly runs after the male. But she      only pursues him for a short distance, and the two spiders remain      together without any danger to either. Lecaillon disbelieves the      statement of Romanes (in his _Animal Intelligence_) that the      female eats the male after copulation. But this certainly seems      to occur sometimes among insects, as illustrated by the following      instance described by so careful an observer of insects as Fabre.        The _Mantis"]]]
