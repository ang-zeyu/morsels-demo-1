in discriminating accent where it is used to determine            the parts of speech.      224. _Do we ever have two sets of Antitheses in the same sentence?_    We do; as each member may contain an antithesis.      225. _Give an example._    John was hurt;

by pitching the voice first            a little higher than the natural, and mastering that            thoroughly, then still higher and higher.      242. _What is meant by Rotundity of the voice?_    That peculiar form of tone which the Romans called \"Ore rotundo,\"            which signifies \"Round mouth.\"      243. _In what kind of sentences is the Rotundity of the voice            exemplified?_    In the hailing of vessels, and is used especially by sailors and            officers.      244. _Which is the most difficult: to raise the voice to a higher            pitch, or to bring it to a lower?_    The lowering of the voice is more difficult, and requires great            care and practice.      245. _What is a common fault with most public speakers?_    To run the voice into too high a key, and thus weary the hearers.      246. _What is a good rule by which to govern the voice?_    To start on a key lower than the natural, and thus avoid running            too high.      247. _What are the principal styles of different reading            selections?_    Descriptive, Narrative, Senatorial, Moral, Didactic, Dramatic, and            Amusing.      248. _What tone of voice should be used in reading a Descriptive            selection?_    The ordinary, natural tone, with a careful use of emphasis.      249. _What tone of voice is best adapted to the reading of a            Narration?_    The conversational tone, with as little reference to the printed            page as possible.      250. _What style is the best adapted to Senatorial reading?_    An imitative style and tone, being careful in the use of the            emphatic pause.      251. _What tone is best adapted to the reading of Moral and            Religious selections?_    Low and moderate tone, expressing feeling and sentiment, being            careful not to read too fast.      252. _What style is best adapted to Didactic reading?_    That peculiar style which is best adapted to impart instruction,            laying special stress on the important idea.      253. _What style and tone are best adapted to the reading of            Dramatic selections?_    A style and tone which are entirely imitative in character.      254. _What tone or character of voice is best suited to the            rendering of Amusing selections?_    That which will bring out the mirthful sentiment, to the exclusion            of all rules for accent, emphasis, etc.      255. _Should all persons use the same tones of voice and style in            reading selections?_    They should not; as individuals are differently constituted,            so they have different ways of expressing their ideas and            sentiments.

I don't  know why,\" said Em plaintively, \"but she just put her books under her  arm and walked out; and she will never come to his school again, she  says, and she always does what she says. And now I must sit here every  day alone,\" said Em, the great tears dropping softly.    \"Perhaps Tant Sannie will send him away,\" said the boy, in his mumbling  way, trying to comfort her.    \"No,\" said Em, shaking her head; \"no. Last night when the little  Hottentot maid was washing her feet, he told her he liked such feet, and  that fat women were so nice to him; and she said I must always put pure  cream in his coffee now. No; he'll never go away,\" said Em dolorously.    The boy put down his skins and fumbled in his pocket, and produced a  small piece of paper containing something. He stuck it out toward her.    \"There, take it for you,\" he said. This was by way of comfort.    Em opened it and found a small bit of gum, a commodity prized by the  children; but the great tears dropped down slowly on to it.    Waldo was distressed. He had cried so much in his morsel of life that  tears in another seemed to burn him.    \"If,\" he said, stepping in awkwardly and standing by the table, \"if you  will not cry I will tell you something--a secret.\"    \"What is that?\" asked Em, instantly becoming decidedly better.    \"You will tell it to no human being?\"    \"No.\"    He bent nearer to her, and with deep solemnity said:    \"I have made a machine!\"    Em opened her eyes.    \"Yes; a machine for shearing sheep. It is almost done,\" said the boy.  \"There is only one thing that is not right yet; but it will be soon.  When you think, and think, and think, all night and all day, it comes at  last,\" he added mysteriously.    \"Where is it?\"    \"Here! I always carry it here,\" said the boy, putting his hand to his  breast, where a bulging-out was visible. \"This is a model. When it is  done they will have to make a large one.\"    \"Show it me.\"    The boy shook his head.    \"No, not till it is done. I cannot let any human being see it till  then.\"    \"It is a beautiful secret,\" said Em; and the boy shuffled out to pick up  his skins.    That evening father and son sat in the cabin eating their supper. The  father sighed deeply sometimes. Perhaps he thought how long a time it  was since Bonaparte had visited the cabin; but his son was in that land  in which sighs have no part. It is a question whether it were not better  to be the shabbiest of fools, and know the way up the little stair  of imagination to the land of dreams, than the wisest of men, who see  nothing that the eyes do not show, and feel nothing that the hands do  not touch. The boy chewed his brown bread and drank his coffee; but in  truth he saw only his machine finished--that last something found out  and added. He saw it as it worked with beautiful smoothness; and over  and above, as he chewed his bread and drank his coffee, there was that  delightful consciousness of something bending over him and loving him.  It would not have been better in one of the courts of heaven, where the  walls are set with rows of the King of Glory's amethysts and milk-white  pearls, than there, eating his supper in that little room.    As they sat in silence there was a knock at the door. When it was  opened the small woolly head of a little nigger showed itself. She was  a messenger from Tant Sannie: the German was wanted at once at the  homestead. Putting on his hat with both hands, he hurried off. The  kitchen was in darkness, but in the pantry beyond Tant Sannie and her  maids were assembled.    A Kaffer girl, who had been grinding pepper between two stones, knelt  on the floor, the lean Hottentot stood with a brass candlestick in her  hand, and Tant Sannie, near the shelf, with a hand on each hip, was  evidently listening intently, as were her companions.    \"What may be it?\" cried the old German in astonishment. The room beyond  the pantry was the storeroom. Through the thin wooden partition there  arose at that instant, evidently from some creature ensconced there, a  prolonged and prodigious howl, followed by a succession of violent blows  against the partition wall.    The German seized the churn-stick, and was about to rush round the  house, when the Boer-woman impressively laid her hand upon his arm.    \"That is his head,\" said Tant Sannie, \"that is his head.\"    \"But what might it be?\" asked the German, looking from one to the other,  churn-stick in hand.    A low hollow bellow prevented reply, and the voice of Bonaparte lifted  itself on high.    \"Mary-Ann! my angel! my wife!\"    \"Isn't it dreadful?\" said Tant Sannie, as the blows were repeated  fiercely. \"He has got a letter; his wife is dead. You must go and  comfort him,\" said Tant Sannie at last, \"and I will go with you. It  would not be the thing for me to go alone--me, who am only thirty-three,  and he an unmarried man now,\" said Tant Sannie, blushing and smoothing  out her apron.    Upon this they all trudged round the house in company--the Hottentot  maid carrying the light, Tant Sannie and the German following, and the  Kaffer girl bringing up the rear.    \"Oh,\" said Tant Sannie, \"I see now it wasn't wickedness made him do  without his wife so long--only necessity.\"    At the door she motioned to the German to enter, and followed him  closely. On the stretcher behind the sacks Bonaparte lay on his face,  his head pressed into a pillow, his legs kicking gently. The Boer-woman  sat down on a box at the foot of the bed. The German stood with folded  hands looking on.    \"We must all die,\" said Tant Sannie at last; \"it is the dear Lord's  will.\"    Hearing her voice, Bonaparte turned himself on to his back.    \"It's very hard,\" said Tant Sannie, \"I know, for I've lost two  husbands.\"    Bonaparte looked up into the German's face.    \"Oh, what does she say? Speak to me words of comfort!\"    The German repeated Tant Sannie's remark.    \"Ah, I--I also! Two dear, dear wives, whom I shall never see any more!\"  cried Bonaparte, flinging himself back upon the bed.    He howled, till the tarantulas, who lived between the rafters and the  zinc roof, felt the unusual vibration, and looked out with their wicked  bright eyes, to see what was going on.    Tant Sannie sighed, the Hottentot maid sighed, the Kaffer girl who  looked in at the door put her hand over her mouth and said \"Mow-wah!\"    \"You must trust in the Lord,\" said Tant Sannie. \"He can give you more  than you have lost.\"    \"I do, I do!\" he cried; \"but oh, I have no wife! I have no wife!\"    Tant Sannie was much affected, and came and stood near the bed.    \"Ask him if he won't have a little pap--nice, fine, flour pap. There is  some boiling on the kitchen fire.\"    The German made the proposal, but the widower waved his hand.    \"No, nothing shall pass my lips. I should be suffocated. No, no! Speak  not of food to me!\"    \"Pap, and a little brandy in,\" said Tant Sannie coaxingly.    Bonaparte caught the word.    \"Perhaps, perhaps--if I struggled with myself--for the sake of my duties  I might imbibe a few drops,\" he said, looking with quivering lip up into  the German's face. \"I must do my duty, must I not?\"    Tant Sannie gave the order, and the girl went for the pap.    \"I know how it was when my first husband died. They could do nothing  with me,\" the Boer-woman said, \"till I had eaten a sheep's trotter, and  honey, and a little roaster-cake. I know.\"    Bonaparte sat up on the bed with his legs stretched out in front of him,  and a hand on each knee, blubbering softly.    \"Oh, she was a woman! You are very kind to try and comfort me, but she  was my wife. For a woman that is my wife I could live; for the woman  that is my wife I could die! For a woman that is my wife I could--Ah!  that sweet word 'wife'; when will it rest upon my lips again?\"    When his feelings had subsided a little he raised the corners of his  turned-down mouth, and spoke to the German with flabby lips.    \"Do you think she understands me? Oh, tell her every word, that she may  know I thank her.\"    At that instant the girl reappeared with a basin of steaming gruel and a  black bottle.    Tant Sannie poured some of its contents into the basin, stirred it well,  and came to the bed.    \"Oh, I can't, I can't! I shall die! I shall die!\" said Bonaparte,  putting his hands to his side.    \"Come, just a little,\" said Tant Sannie coaxingly; \"just a drop.\"    \"It's too thick, it's too thick. I should choke.\"    Tant Sannie added from the contents of the bottle and held out a  spoonful; Bonaparte opened his mouth like a little bird waiting for a  worm, and held it open, as she dipped again and again into the pap.    \"Ah, this will do your heart good,\" said Tant Sannie, in whose mind the  relative functions of heart and stomach were exceedingly ill-defined.    When the basin was emptied the violence of his grief was much assuaged;  he looked at Tant Sannie with gentle tears.    \"Tell him,\" said the Boer-woman, \"that I hope he will sleep well, and  that the Lord will comfort him, as the Lord only can.\"    \"Bless you, dear friend, God bless you,\" said Bonaparte.    When the door was safely shut on the German, the Hottentot, and the  Dutchwoman, he got off the bed and washed away the soap he had rubbed on  his eyelids.    \"Bon,\" he said, slapping his leg, \"you're the cutest lad I ever came  across. If you don't turn out the old Hymns-and-prayers, and pummel  the Ragged coat, and get your arms round the fat one's waist and a  wedding-ring on her finger, then you are not Bonaparte. But you are  Bonaparte. Bon, you're a fine boy!\"    Making which pleasing reflection, he pulled off his trousers and got  into bed cheerfully.        Chapter 1.VII. He Sets His Trap.    \"May I come in? I hope I do not disturb you, my dear friend,\" said  Bonaparte, late one evening, putting his nose in at the cabin door,  where the"]]]
