In the course of the following production, the Reader will meet with  several references to a Plan of Paris, which it had been intended to  prefix to the work; but that intention having been frustrated by the  rupture between the two countries, in consequence of which the copies  for the whole of the Edition have been detained at Calais, it is  hoped that this apology will be accepted for the omission.

Her crew were lazily enjoying this respite  from the arduous labor of rowing up stream.  Three miles below them lay  the Marjorie W.  herself, quite ready to sail so soon as they should  have clambered aboard and swung the long boat to its davits.  Presently  the attention of every man was drawn from his dreaming or his gossiping  to the northern bank of the river.  There, screaming at them in a  cracked falsetto and with skinny arms outstretched, stood a strange  apparition of a man.    \"Wot the 'ell?\" ejaculated one of the crew.    \"A white man!\" muttered the mate, and then:  \"Man the oars, boys, and  we'll just pull over an' see what he wants.\"    When they came close to the shore they saw an emaciated creature with  scant white locks tangled and matted.  The thin, bent body was naked  but for a loin cloth.  Tears were rolling down the sunken pock-marked  cheeks.  The man jabbered at them in a strange tongue.    \"Rooshun,\" hazarded the mate.  \"Savvy English?\" he called to the man.    He did, and in that tongue, brokenly and haltingly, as though it had  been many years since he had used it, he begged them to take him with  them away from this awful country.  Once on board the Marjorie W. the  stranger told his rescuers a pitiful tale of privation, hardships, and  torture, extending over a period of ten years.  How he happened to have  come to Africa he did not tell them, leaving them to assume he had  forgotten the incidents of his life prior to the frightful ordeals that  had wrecked him mentally and physically.  He did not even tell them his  true name, and so they knew him only as Michael Sabrov, nor was there  any resemblance between this sorry wreck and the virile, though  unprincipled, Alexis Paulvitch of old.    It had been ten years since the Russian had escaped the fate of his  friend, the arch-fiend Rokoff, and not once, but many times during  those ten years had Paulvitch cursed the fate that had given to  Nicholas Rokoff death and immunity from suffering while it had meted to  him the hideous terrors of an existence infinitely worse than the death  that persistently refused to claim him.    Paulvitch had taken to the jungle when he had seen the beasts of Tarzan  and their savage lord swarm the deck of the Kincaid, and in his terror  lest Tarzan pursue and capture him he had stumbled on deep into the  jungle, only to fall at last into the hands of one of the savage  cannibal tribes that had felt the weight of Rokoff's evil temper and  cruel brutality.  Some strange whim of the chief of this tribe saved  Paulvitch from death only to plunge him into a life of misery and  torture.  For ten years he had been the butt of the village, beaten and  stoned by the women and children, cut and slashed and disfigured by the  warriors; a victim of often recurring fevers of the most malignant  variety.  Yet he did not die.  Smallpox laid its hideous clutches upon  him; leaving him unspeakably branded with its repulsive marks.  Between  it and the attentions of the tribe the countenance of Alexis Paulvitch  was so altered that his own mother could not have recognized in the  pitiful mask he called his face a single familiar feature.  A few  scraggly, yellow-white locks had supplanted the thick, dark hair that  had covered his head.  His limbs were bent and twisted, he walked with  a shuffling, unsteady gait, his body doubled forward.  His teeth were  gone--knocked out by his savage masters.  Even his mentality was but a  sorry mockery of what it once had been.    They took him aboard the Marjorie W., and there they fed and nursed  him.  He gained a little in strength; but his appearance never altered  for the better--a human derelict, battered and wrecked, they had found  him; a human derelict, battered and wrecked, he would remain until  death claimed him.  Though still in his thirties, Alexis Paulvitch  could easily have passed for eighty.  Inscrutable Nature had demanded  of the accomplice a greater penalty than his principal had paid.    In the mind of Alexis Paulvitch there lingered no thoughts of  revenge--only a dull hatred of the man whom he and Rokoff had tried to  break, and failed.  There was hatred, too, of the memory of Rokoff, for  Rokoff had led him into the horrors he had undergone.  There was hatred  of the police of a score of cities from which he had had to flee.  There was hatred of law, hatred of order, hatred of everything.  Every  moment of the man's waking life was filled with morbid thought of  hatred--he had become mentally as he was physically in outward  appearance, the personification of the blighting emotion of Hate.  He  had little or nothing to do with the men who had rescued him.  He was  too weak to work and too morose for company, and so they quickly left  him alone to his own devices.    The Marjorie W. had been chartered by a syndicate of wealthy  manufacturers, equipped with a laboratory and a staff of scientists,  and sent out to search for some natural product which the manufacturers  who footed the bills had been importing from South America at an  enormous cost.  What the product was none on board the Marjorie W. knew  except the scientists, nor is it of any moment to us, other than that  it led the ship to a certain island off the coast of Africa after  Alexis Paulvitch had been taken aboard.    The ship lay at anchor off the coast for several weeks.  The monotony  of life aboard her became trying for the crew.  They went often ashore,  and finally Paulvitch asked to accompany them--he too was tiring of the  blighting sameness of existence upon the ship.    The island was heavily timbered.  Dense jungle ran down almost to the  beach.  The scientists were far inland, prosecuting their search for  the valuable commodity that native rumor upon the mainland had led them  to believe might be found here in marketable quantity.  The ship's  company fished, hunted, and explored.  Paulvitch shuffled up and down  the beach, or lay in the shade of the great trees that skirted it.  One  day, as the men were gathered at a little distance inspecting the body  of a panther that had fallen to the gun of one of them who had been  hunting inland, Paulvitch lay sleeping beneath his tree.  He was  awakened by the touch of a hand upon his shoulder.  With a start he sat  up to see a huge, anthropoid ape squatting at his side, inspecting him  intently.  The Russian was thoroughly frightened.  He glanced toward  the sailors--they were a couple of hundred yards away.  Again the ape  plucked at his shoulder, jabbering plaintively.  Paulvitch saw no  menace in the inquiring gaze, or in the attitude of the beast.  He got  slowly to his feet.  The ape rose at his side.    Half doubled, the man shuffled cautiously away toward the sailors.  The  ape moved with him, taking one of his arms.  They had come almost to  the little knot of men before they were seen, and by this time  Paulvitch had become assured that the beast meant no harm.  The animal  evidently was accustomed to the association of human beings.  It  occurred to the Russian that the ape represented a certain considerable  money value, and before they reached the sailors he had decided he  should be the one to profit by it.    When the men looked up and saw the oddly paired couple shuffling toward  them they were filled with amazement, and started on a run toward the  two.  The ape showed no sign of fear.  Instead he grasped each sailor  by the shoulder and peered long and earnestly into his face.  Having  inspected them all he returned to Paulvitch's side, disappointment  written strongly upon his countenance and in his carriage.    The men were delighted with him.  They gathered about, asking Paulvitch  many questions, and examining his companion.  The Russian told them  that the ape was his--nothing further would he offer--but kept harping  continually upon the same theme, \"The ape is mine.  The ape is mine.\"  Tiring of Paulvitch, one of the men essayed a pleasantry.  Circling  about behind the ape he prodded the anthropoid in the back with a pin.  Like a flash the beast wheeled upon its tormentor, and, in the briefest  instant of turning, the placid, friendly animal was metamorphosed to a  frenzied demon of rage.  The broad grin that had sat upon the sailor's  face as he perpetrated his little joke froze to an expression of  terror.  He attempted to dodge the long arms that reached for him; but,  failing, drew a long knife that hung at his belt.  With a single wrench  the ape tore the weapon from the man's grasp and flung it to one side,  then his yellow fangs were buried in the sailor's shoulder.    With sticks and knives the man's companions fell upon the beast, while  Paulvitch danced around the cursing, snarling pack mumbling and  screaming pleas and threats.  He saw his visions of wealth rapidly  dissipating before the weapons of the sailors.    The ape, however, proved no easy victim to the superior numbers that  seemed fated to overwhelm him.  Rising from the sailor who had  precipitated the battle he shook his giant shoulders, freeing himself  from two of the men that were clinging to his back, and with mighty  blows of his open palms felled one after another of his attackers,  leaping hither and thither with the agility of a small monkey.    The fight had been witnessed by the captain and mate who were just  landing from the Marjorie W., and Paulvitch saw these two now running  forward with drawn revolvers while the two sailors who had brought them  ashore trailed at their heels.  The ape stood looking about him at the  havoc he had wrought, but whether he was awaiting a renewal of the  attack or was deliberating which of his foes he should exterminate  first Paulvitch could not guess.  What he could guess, however, was  that"]]]
