They are included  in a harmonic/logic way in the structure.    There are some models, which are not included in the normal structure of  models, or they have lost their normal connection to the structure. Such  models are called \"illegal models\" or XZM.    There are many situations which can produce illegal models. A case is when a  new model is not finished because the specific external reality, which  produced it, is no met anymore.    For instance, somebody has been involved in a car accident. A new model is  started, but because such situation will not be met again in the near future,  the model is not finished, because there is no external reality to finish it.  Such model could evolve as an illegal model.    Observation: there is an empirical method of the \"classical\" psychiatry to  stimulate or even to force a person (mainly children) to tell everything which  is associated with a traumatic situation. MDT says that such a method is very  good because, in this way, a possible illegal model will be forced to connect  to the normal structure of models and so, the long-range negative effects are  prevented. As we see, MDT can explain exactly why this psychiatric empirical  procedure is good, as MDT was not even created specifically for the  psychiatric field!    Another situation when an XZM could be created is when a model is too large.  Such a model could be fragmented and some components can lose the normal  connection with the structure. The fragments can evolve as illegal models.    The story-type models are also candidates to become XZM (at least some parts  of them).    A major cause of the occurrence of illegal models is technological problems.  As we know, a normal structure of models is made of many models, which are  connected together in a harmonic/logic way. The models communicate between  them but, if the communication is not good due to technological problems,  some models can become illegal.    Such process can also generate half-XZM models. Such models have little  communications with the other models, or the communication can be only in  association with some other models, or only in association with some specific  situations of the external reality.    Because such models are no controlled anymore by the normal structure of  models, they can contain anything. They can obtain information from the  external reality or from other models, or they can create and activate models  which can act on the external reality (ZAM and AZM).    XZM models could be dangerous, or even very dangerous, because a person can do  some things outside his/her consciousness. A person that has such models does  not know that such models exist in his/her brain. Some of these models can be  detected during hypnosis practice.    XZMs can explain somnambulist-effect, double-personality, and many illogical  or bizarre activities. They can also explain some crimes, including the  serial-killer phenomenon or terrorism-related crimes. Such a person is just  \"remote-controlled\" by the XZMs.    The illegal models can explain also some paranormal phenomena.        PARANORMAL PHENOMENA    Telepathy is considered as a direct communication between two brains. Even  more, this kind of communication is performed at great distance between the  two brains and through any kind of media.    Unfortunately, this kind of transmission of information is not possible, based  on the laws of the nature. In order to transmit information, it is necessary  to transmit energy at the distance. The known fields of forces (electric,  magnetic, electro-magnetic and gravitational) do not meet the requirements for  such a transmission. Even more, even if there is a field of forces which can  propagate at large distance through any kind of material, in order to transmit  information, modulation of the energy, depending on the information, is also  necessary. At the receiver it is necessary to demodulate the energy changes,  in order to get the message.    Some could say that the information could be transmitted by a 'shortcut',  without transmitting the energy at the distance. This interferes with the  basics of the sciences of nature.    Anyways, I believe in natural sciences, and the only conclusion is that, for  now and forever, telepathy, as a direct transmission of information from a  brain to another, does not exist.    MDT explains  \"telepathy\" in the frame of the laws of nature, without any kind  of transmission of information at the distance. The phenomenon is based on the  huge capacity of the brain to process information and on XZM models.    As we know, the basic function of any brain is to make models and to simulate  the possible evolution of them. A model, which is associated with an external  reality, is able to predict the evolution of that external reality. So, at any  moment, we make predictions associated with the external reality, and the  majority of them are good.    Now, let's suppose that a person has a special relation with another person,  as a mother and her child, for instance. The model associated with her child  could have been active for many years. Such a model could become a XZM model.  This XZM is active outside the control of the mother. Such  an XZM could  simulate the interaction between the child and different kinds of  environments. When a negative prediction occurs, such a model can transmit a  message to the local-ZM. The mother \"receives\" a message. The \"receiver\"  cannot find the source and the reason for that message, because an XZM-model,  not belonging to the normal structure of models, transmits the message. It is  very easy to consider that such a message is transmitted by \"telepathy\".    So, MDT considers that such messages are generated by simulation on an XZM-  model and so, they are just predictions. In some cases, such predictions could  be correct (the predictions which are not correct are forgotten !!!). Such  messages are not related with the external reality.    Some of such predictions could also be obtained during a hypnosis session,  because hypnosis is associated only with XZMs.    The same basic explanation is valid for the clairvoyance phenomenon. In such a  case, the XZM is associated with a specific external reality, or with an  illness.    Such predictions could be correct for many situations, but, because they are  just predictions, there is a limited guarantee on their correctness.    Example: a person was \"seen\" by a clairvoyance medium. This medium was asked  on the status of the heart of that person. The answer was that the heart is in  a good shape. The answer was correct. But there was a \"little\" problem: that  person was wearing a pacemaker, which was not \"seen\" by the medium, in  accordance with MDT.    MDT can be used to see how to develop such paranormal qualities. First of all,  for it, let's remember that XZM are image models and so, developing the  interaction with  external reality based on image models is strongly  recommended. Also, a natural tendency towards image models is mandatory.    Such persons must be well balanced, or able to obtain a stability status by  different methods, so that the normal structure of models has a reduced  activity. Such persons must have a reduced tendency to control the activity  associated with the problem (to reduce even more the activity of the normal  structure of models).    It is also very important to obtain as much as possible information by direct  interaction (based on image models) with the problem. The information based on  symbolic models could be useful too, after translation on image models.    MDT considers that XZM models are image models. But, there is a supposition  that some symbolic-models could be illegal too. If so, an XZM-symbolic model  could explain, e.g., how some persons can perform extremely complicated  arithmetical operations.        THE NORMAL HUMAN BRAIN    This section was intended to treat the subject declared, but instead, it is  just an evaluation of the problem. The reason is the inexistence of sufficient  data on XZM models.    To make a local model on the normal human brain, we take some conditions from  MDT, as follows:    C1: The PSM must act to protect the being and to ensure the unconditional  survival, forever, of that being. The PSM must also contain some models  associated with the society in which the being lives. The PSM must not contain  ordinary models.    C2: Any model of the brain must be stable (harmonic or logic).    C3: The whole structure of models must be stable. That is, any truth of any  model must be accepted (or at least not rejected) by any other model of the  brain.    Let's develop a little this local model.    The main condition of normality is that the person has to be accepted by the  society. That is, the person has to integrate in that society. For a cannibal-  type society, the person has to integrate in that society. Otherwise he will  be rejected by the society. The limits or normality are, as we see, very  broad.    For a democratic society of our time, some of the conditions of normality are  \"not to kill\", \"not to steal\" and so on. Such models must be in the PSM and  this goal is achieved by education since many generations.    Let's consider that a person makes a model to kill someone. If this model is  blocked by PSM, that person can be considered as a normal one.    However, if a person makes a model to kill someone and, in some conditions,  the PSM does not work properly, that model can be activated. Based on MDT,  such a situation is a hardware problem and so, that person is not a normal  one.    In \"classical\" psychiatry, they make a test to understand if the person was or  not responsible for his/her acts. Based on MDT, as I said, here we have a  hardware problem and so, the fact that the person was or not conscious of what  he was doing is not relevant.

FAUST    Canst thou, poor Devil, give me whatsoever?  When was a human soul, in its supreme endeavor,  E'er understood by such as thou?  Yet, hast thou food which never satiates, now,--  The restless, ruddy gold hast thou,  That runs, quicksilver-like, one's fingers through,--  A game whose winnings no man ever knew,--  A maid that, even from my breast,  Beckons my neighbor with her wanton glances,  And Honor's godlike zest,  The meteor that a moment dances,--  Show me the fruits that, ere they're gathered, rot,  And trees that daily with new leafage clothe them!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Such a demand alarms me not:  Such treasures have I, and can show them.  But still the time may reach us, good my friend.  When peace we crave and more luxurious diet.    FAUST    When on an idler's bed I stretch myself in quiet.  There let, at once, my record end!  Canst thou with lying flattery rule me,  Until, self-pleased, myself I see,--  Canst thou with rich enjoyment fool me,  Let that day be the last for me!  The bet I offer.    MEPHISTOPHELES                     Done!    FAUST                           And heartily!  When thus I hail the Moment flying:  \"Ah, still delay--thou art so fair!\"  Then bind me in thy bonds undying,  My final ruin then declare!  Then let the death-bell chime the token.  Then art thou from thy service free!  The clock may stop, the hand be broken,  Then Time be finished unto me!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Consider well: my memory good is rated.    FAUST    Thou hast a perfect right thereto.  My powers I have not rashly estimated:  A slave am I, whate'er I do--  If thine, or whose? 'tis needless to debate it.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Then at the Doctors'-banquet I, to-day,  Will as a servant wait behind thee.  But one thing more! Beyond all risk to bind thee,  Give me a line or two, I pray.    FAUST    Demand'st thou, Pedant, too, a document?  Hast never known a man, nor proved his word's intent?  Is't not enough, that what I speak to-day  Shall stand, with all my future days agreeing?  In all its tides sweeps not the world away,  And shall a promise bind my being?  Yet this delusion in our hearts we bear:  Who would himself therefrom deliver?  Blest he, whose bosom Truth makes pure and fair!  No sacrifice shall he repent of ever.  Nathless a parchment, writ and stamped with care,  A spectre is, which all to shun endeavor.  The word, alas! dies even in the pen,  And wax and leather keep the lordship then.  What wilt from me, Base Spirit, say?--  Brass, marble, parchment, paper, clay?  The terms with graver, quill, or chisel, stated?  I freely leave the choice to thee.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Why heat thyself, thus instantly,  With eloquence exaggerated?  Each leaf for such a pact is good;  And to subscribe thy name thou'lt take a drop of blood.    FAUST    If thou therewith art fully satisfied,  So let us by the farce abide.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Blood is a juice of rarest quality.    FAUST    Fear not that I this pact shall seek to sever?  The promise that I make to thee  Is just the sum of my endeavor.  I have myself inflated all too high;  My proper place is thy estate:  The Mighty Spirit deigns me no reply,  And Nature shuts on me her gate.  The thread of Thought at last is broken,  And knowledge brings disgust unspoken.  Let us the sensual deeps explore,  To quench the fervors of glowing passion!  Let every marvel take form and fashion  Through the impervious veil it wore!  Plunge we in Time's tumultuous dance,  In the rush and roll of Circumstance!  Then may delight and distress,  And worry and success,  Alternately follow, as best they can:  Restless activity proves the man!    MEPHISTOPHELES    For you no bound, no term is set.  Whether you everywhere be trying,  Or snatch a rapid bliss in flying,  May it agree with you, what you get!  Only fall to, and show no timid balking.    FAUST    But thou hast heard, 'tis not of joy we're talking.  I take the wildering whirl, enjoyment's keenest pain,  Enamored hate, exhilarant disdain.  My bosom, of its thirst for knowledge sated,  Shall not, henceforth, from any pang be wrested,  And all of life for all mankind created  Shall be within mine inmost being tested:  The highest, lowest forms my soul shall borrow,  Shall heap upon itself their bliss and sorrow,  And thus, my own sole self to all their selves expanded,  I too, at last, shall with them all be stranded!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Believe me, who for many a thousand year  The same tough meat have chewed and tested,  That from the cradle to the bier  No man the ancient leaven has digested!  Trust one of us, this Whole supernal  Is made but for a God's delight!  _He_ dwells in splendor single and eternal,  But _us_ he thrusts in darkness, out of sight,  And _you_ he dowers with Day and Night.    FAUST    Nay, but I will!    MEPHISTOPHELES    A good reply!  One only fear still needs repeating:  The art is long, the time is fleeting.  Then let thyself be taught, say I!  Go, league thyself with a poet,  Give the rein to his imagination,  Then wear the crown, and show it,  Of the qualities of his creation,--  The courage of the lion's breed,  The wild stag's speed,  The Italian's fiery blood,  The North's firm fortitude!  Let him find for thee the secret tether  That binds the Noble and Mean together.  And teach thy pulses of youth and pleasure  To love by rule, and hate by measure!  I'd like, myself, such a one to see:  Sir Microcosm his name should be.    FAUST    What am I, then, if 'tis denied my part  The crown of all humanity to win me,  Whereto yearns every sense within me?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Why, on the whole, thou'rt--what thou art.  Set wigs of million curls upon thy head, to raise thee,  Wear shoes an ell in height,--the truth betrays thee,  And thou remainest--what thou art.    FAUST    I feel, indeed, that I have made the treasure  Of human thought and knowledge mine, in vain;  And if I now sit down in restful leisure,  No fount of newer strength is in my brain:  I am no hair's-breadth more in height,  Nor nearer, to the Infinite,    MEPHISTOPHELES    Good Sir, you see the facts precisely  As they are seen by each and all.  We must arrange them now, more wisely,  Before the joys of life shall pall.  Why, Zounds! Both hands and feet are, truly--  And head and virile forces--thine:  Yet all that I indulge in newly,  Is't thence less wholly mine?  If I've six stallions in my stall,  Are not their forces also lent me?  I speed along, completest man of all,  As though my legs were four-and-twenty.  Take hold, then! let reflection rest,  And plunge into the world with zest!  I say to thee, a speculative wight  Is like a beast on moorlands lean,  That round and round some fiend misleads to evil plight,  While all about lie pastures fresh and green.    FAUST    Then how shall we begin?    MEPHISTOPHELES    We'll try a wider sphere.  What place of martyrdom is here!  Is't life, I ask, is't even prudence,  To bore thyself and bore the students?  Let Neighbor Paunch to that attend!  Why plague thyself with threshing straw forever?  The best thou learnest, in the end  Thou dar'st not tell the youngsters--never!  I hear one's footsteps, hither steering.    FAUST  To see him now I have no heart.    MEPHISTOPHELES    So long the poor boy waits a hearing,  He must not unconsoled depart.  Thy cap and mantle straightway lend me!  I'll play the comedy with art.    (_He disguises himself_.)    My wits, be certain, will befriend me.  But fifteen minutes' time is all I need;  For our fine trip, meanwhile, prepare thyself with speed!    [_Exit_ FAUST.    MEPHISTOPHELES    (_In_ FAUST'S _long mantle_.)    Reason and Knowledge only thou despise,  The highest strength in man that lies!  Let but the Lying Spirit bind thee  With magic works and shows that blind thee,  And I shall have thee fast and sure!--  Fate such a bold, untrammelled spirit gave him,  As forwards, onwards, ever must endure;  Whose over-hasty impulse drave him  Past earthly joys he might secure.  Dragged through the wildest life, will I enslave him,  Through flat and stale indifference;  With struggling, chilling, checking, so deprave him  That, to his hot, insatiate sense,  The dream of drink shall mock, but never lave him:  Refreshment shall his lips in vain implore--  Had he not made himself the Devil's, naught could save  him,  Still were he lost forevermore!    (_A_ STUDENT _enters_.)    STUDENT    A short time, only, am I here,  And come, devoted and sincere,  To greet and know the man of fame,  Whom men to me with reverence name.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Your courtesy doth flatter me:  You see a man, as others be.  Have you, perchance, elsewhere begun?    STUDENT    Receive me now, I pray, as one  Who comes to you with courage good,  Somewhat of cash, and healthy blood:  My mother was hardly willing to let me;  But knowledge worth having I fain would get me.

Tis all so cramped and close and mean;  One sees no tree, no glimpse of green,  And when the lecture-halls receive me,  Seeing, hearing, and thinking leave me.    MEPHISTOPHELES    All that depends on habitude.  So from its mother's breasts a child  At first, reluctant, takes its food,  But soon to seek them is beguiled.  Thus, at the breasts of Wisdom clinging,  Thou'lt find each day a greater rapture bringing.    STUDENT    I'll hang thereon with joy, and freely drain them;  But tell me, pray, the proper means to gain them.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Explain, before you further speak,  The special faculty you seek.    STUDENT    I crave the highest erudition;  And fain would make my acquisition  All that there is in Earth and Heaven,  In Nature and in Science too.
