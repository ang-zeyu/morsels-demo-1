If it is not an honor it's not a disgrace either; But I can  stay by myself.    BLUMENBERG. Have you money to get something to eat? Go to the  restaurant-keeper and order something charged to me. The committee  will pay for it.    SCHMOCK. I don't care to go and eat. I have no need to spend anything.  I have had my supper.    [_Blare of trumpets and march in the distance. Exit_ BLUMENBERG.  SCHMOCK _alone, coming forward, angrily_.]    I hate him! I'll tell him I hate him, that I despise him from the  bottom of my heart!    [_Turns to go, comes back._]    But I cannot tell him so, or he will cut out all I send in for the  special correspondence I write for his paper! I will try to swallow it  down!    _[Exit through centre door_.]    _Enter_ BOLZ, KAeMPE, BELLMAUS _by side door_.    BOLZ (_marching in_). Behold us in the house of the Capulets!  [_Pretends to thrust a sword into its scabbard._] Conceal your swords  under roses. Blow your little cheeks up, and look as silly and  innocent as possible. Above all, don't let me see you get into a row,  and if you meet this Tybaldus Senden be so good as to run round the  corner.    [_The procession is seen marching through the rear halls_.]    You, Romeo Bellmaus, look out for the little women. I see more  fluttering curls and waving kerchiefs there than are good for your  peace of mind.    KAeMPE. I bet a bottle of champagne that if one of us gets into a row  it will be you.    BOLZ. Possibly. But I promise you that you shall surely come in for  your share of it. Now listen to my plan of operations. You  Kaempe--[_Enter_ SCHMOCK.] Stop! Who is that? Thunder! The factotum of  the _Coriolanus_! Our _incognito_ has not lasted long.    SCHMOCK (_even before the last remark, has been seen looking in at the  door, coming forward_). I wish you good evening, Mr. Bolz.    BOLZ. I wish you the same and of even better quality, Mr. Schmock.    SCHMOCK. Might I have a couple of words with you?    BOLZ. A couple? Don't ask for too few, noble armor-bearer of the  _Coriolanus_! A couple of dozen words you shall have, but no more.    SCHMOCK. Could you not employ me on your paper.    BOLZ (_to_ KAeMPE _and_ BELLMAUS). Do you hear that? On our paper? H'm!  'Tis much you ask, noble Roman!    SCHMOCK. I am sick of the _Coriolanus_. I would do any kind of work  you needed done. I want to be with respectable people, where one can  earn something and be treated decently.    BOLZ. What are you asking of us, slave of Rome? We to entice you away  from your party--never! We do violence to your political convictions?  Make you a renegade? We bear the guilt of your joining our party? No,  sir! We have a tender conscience. It rises in arms against your  proposition!    SCHMOCK. Why do you let that trouble you? Under Blumenberg I have  learned to write whichever way the wind blows. I have written on the  left and again on the right. I can write in any direction.    BOLZ. I see you have character. You would be a sure success on our  paper. Your offer does us honor, but we cannot accept it now. So  momentous an affair as your defection needs deep consideration.  Meanwhile you will have confided in no unfeeling barbarian. (_Aside to  the others_.) We may be able to worm something out of him. Bellmaus,  you have the tenderest heart of us three; you must devote yourself to  him today.    BELLMAUS. But what shall I do with him?    BOLZ. Take him into the restaurant, sit down in a corner with him,  pour punch into every hollow of his poor head until his secrets jump  out like wet mice. Make him chatter, especially about the elections.  Go, little man, and take good care not to get overheated yourself and  babble.    BELLMAUS. In that case I shall not see much of the fete.    BOLZ. That's true, my son! But what does the fete mean to you? Heat,  dust, and stale dance-music. Besides, we will tell you all about it in  the morning; and then you are a poet, and can imagine the whole affair  to be much finer than it really was. So don't take it to heart. You  may think you have a thankless role, but it is the most important of  all, for it requires coolness and cleverness. Go, mousey, and look out  about getting overheated.    BELLMAUS. I'll look out, old tom-cat.--Come along Schmock!    [BELLMAUS _and_ SCHMOCK _leave_.]    BOLZ. We might as well separate, too.    KAeMPE. I'll go and see how people feel. If I need you I'll look you  up.    BOLZ. I had better not show myself much. I'll stay around here.    [_Exit_ KAeMPE.]    Alone at last!    [_Goes to centre door_.]    There stands the Colonel, closely surrounded. It is she! She is here,  and I have to lie in hiding like a fox under the leaves.--But she has  falcon eyes,--perhaps--the throng disperses--she is walking through  the hall arm-in-arm with Ida--(_Excitedly_.) They are drawing nearer!  (_Irritably_.) Oh, bother! There is Korb rushing toward me! And just  now!    _Enter_ KORB.    KORB. Mr. Conrad! I can't believe my eyes! You here, at this fete!    BOLZ (_hastily_). Hush, old chap! I'm not here without a reason. I can  trust you--you're one of us, you know.    KORB. Body and soul. Through all the talking and fiddling I've kept  saying to myself, \"Long live the _Union!\"_ Here she is!    [_Shows him a paper in his pocket_.]    BOLZ. Good, Korb, you can do me a great favor. In a corner of the  refreshment room Bellmaus is sitting with a stranger. He is to pump  the stranger, but cannot stand much himself and is likely to say  things he shouldn't. You'll do the party a great service if you will  hurry in and drink punch so as to keep Bellmaus up to the mark. You  have a strong head--I know it from of old.    KORB (_hastily_). I go! You are as full of tricks as ever, I see. You  may rely on me. The stranger shall succumb, and the _Union_ shall  triumph.    [_Exit quickly. The music ceases_.]    BOLZ. Poor Schmock! [_At the door_.]    Ah, they are still walking through the hall. Ida is being spoken to,  she stops, Adelaide goes on--(_Excitedly_.) she's coming, she's coming  alone!    ADELAIDE (_makes a motion as though to pass the door, but suddenly  enters_. BOLZ _bows_). Conrad! My dear doctor!    [_Holds out her hand_. BOLZ _bends low over it_.]    ADELAIDE (_in joyous emotion_). I knew you at once from a distance.  Let me see your faithful face. Yes, it has changed but little--a scar,  browner, and a small line about the mouth. I hope it is from laughing.    BOLZ. If at this moment I feel like anything but laughing it is only a  passing malignity of soul. I see myself double, like a melancholy  Highlander. In your presence my long happy childhood passes bodily  before my eyes. All the joy and pain it brought me I feel as vividly  again as though I were still the boy who went into the wood for you in  search of wild adventures and caught robin-red-breasts. And yet the  fine creature I see before me is so different from my playmate that I  realize I am only dreaming a beautiful dream. Your eyes shine as  kindly as ever, but--(_Bowing_.) I have scarcely the right still to  think of old dreams.    ADELAIDE. Possibly I, too, am not so changed as you think; and changed  though we both be, we have remained good friends, have we not?    BOLZ. Rather than give up one iota of my claim to your regard, I would  write and print and try to sell malicious articles against myself.    ADELAIDE. And yet you have been too proud all this time even to come  and see your friend in town. Why have you broken with the Colonel?    BOLZ. I have not broken with him. On the contrary, I have a very  estimable position in his house--one that I can best keep by going  there as seldom as possible. The Colonel, and occasionally Miss Ida,  too, like to assuage their anger against Oldendorf and the newspaper  by regarding me as the evil one with horns and hoofs. A relationship  so tender must be handled with care--a devil must not cheapen himself  by appearing every day.    ADELAIDE. Well, I hope you will now abandon this lofty viewpoint. I am  spending the winter in town, and I hope that for love of your  boyhood's friend you will call on my friends as a denizen of this  world.    BOLZ. In any role you apportion me.    ADELAIDE. Even in that of a peace-envoy between the Colonel and  Oldendorf?    BOLZ. If peace be at the cost of Oldendorf's withdrawal, then no.  Otherwise I am ready to serve you in all good works.    ADELAIDE. But I fear that this is the only price at which peace can be  purchased. You see, Mr. Conrad, we too have become opponents.    BOLZ. To do anything against your wishes is horrible to me, son of  perdition though I be. So my saint wills and commands that Oldendorf  do not become member of Parliament?    ADELAIDE. I will it and command it, Mr. Devil!    BOLZ. It is hard. Up in your heaven you have so many gentlemen to  bestow on Miss Ida; why must you carry off a poor devil's one and only  soul, the professor?    ADELAIDE. It is just the professor I want, and you must let me have  him.    BOLZ. I am in despair. I would tear my hair were the place not so  unsuitable. I dread your anger. The thought makes me tremble that you  might not like this election.    ADELAIDE. Well, try to stop the election, then.    BOLZ. That I cannot do. But so soon as it is over I am fated to mourn  and grow melancholy over your anger. I shall withdraw from the  world--far, far to the North Pole. There I shall end my days sadly,  playing dominoes with polar bears, or spreading the elements of  journalistic training among the seals. That will be easier to endure  than the scathing glance of your eyes.    ADELAIDE (_laughing_). Yes, that's the way you always were. You made  every possible promise and acted exactly as you pleased. But before  starting for the North Pole, perhaps you will make one more effort to  reconcile me here.    [KAeMPE _is seen at the door._]    Hush!--I shall look forward to your visit.

In  later days the Bracebridges became more intimately connected with this  town by the marriage in 1775 of Abraham Bracebridge, Esq., of  Atherstone, with Mary Elizabeth, the only child and heiress of Sir  Charles Holte, to whom the Aston estates ultimately reverted. Many  articles connected with the Holte family have been presented to  Birmingham by the descendants of this marriage.    ~Bradford Street~ takes its name from Henry Bradford, who, in 1767,  advertised that he would give a freehold site to any man who would build  the first house therein.    ~Breweries.~--In the days of old nearly every publican and innkeeper was  his own brewer, the fame of his house depending almost solely on the  quality of the \"stingo\" he could pour out to his customers. The first  local brewery on a large scale appears to have been that erected in  Moseley Street in 1782, which even down to late years retained its  cognomen of the Birmingham Old Brewery. In 1817 another company opened a  similar extensive establishment at St. Peter's Place, in Broad Street,  and since then a number of enterprising individuals have at times  started in the same track, but most have come grief, even in the case of  those whose capital was not classed under the modern term \"limited.\" The  principal local breweries now in existence are those of Messrs. Holder,  Mitchell, and Bates, in addition to the well-known Crosswells Brewery of  Messrs Walter Showell and Sons, noted in next paragraph. The principal  Vinegar Brewery in Birmingham is that of Messrs. Fardon and Co.  (Limited), in Glover Street, which was formed in 1860, and is well  worthy of the stranger's visit. The annual output is about 850,000  gallons, there being storage for nearly a million gallons, and 36,000  casks to send the vinegar out in.    ~Brewery at Crosswells.~--Though by far the most extensive brewery  supplying Birmingham, the Crosswells cannot claim to be more than in the  infancy of its establishment at present, as only twelve years ago the  many acres of ground now covered by its buildings formed but part of an  unenclosed piece of waste land. Nevertheless, the spot was well-known  and often visited in ancient times, on account of the wonderful and  miraculous cures said to have been effected by the free use of the water  gushing up from the depths of the springs to be found there, and which  the monks of old had christened \"The Wells of the Cross.\" Be its  medicinal qualities what they might in the days before Harry the Eighth  was king, the Cross Wells water retained its name and fame for centuries  after the monks were banished and the burly king who drove them out had  himself turned to dust. It has always been acknowledged as one of the  purest waters to be found in the kingdom; but its peculiar and special  adaptability to the brewing of \"good old English cheer\" was left to be  discovered by the founder of the firm of Messrs. Walter Showell and  Sons, who, as stated before, some twelve years back, erected the nucleus  of the present extensive brewery. Starting with the sale of only a few  hundred barrels per week, the call for their ales soon forced the  proprietors to extend their premises in order that supply should meet  demand. At first doubled, then quadrupled, the brewery is now at least  ten times its original size; and a slight notion of the business carried  on may be gathered from the fact that the firm's stock of barrels tots  up to nearly 60,000 and is being continually increased, extensive  cooperages, blacksmiths' shops, &c., being attached to the brewery, as  well as malthouses, offices, and storehouses of all kinds. The head  offices of the firm, which are connected by telephone with the brewery,  as well as with the stores at Kingston Buildings, Crescent Wharf, are  situated in Great Charles Street, and thus the Crosswells Brewery  (though really at Langley Green, some half-dozen miles away as the crow  flies) becomes entitled to rank as a Birmingham establishment, and  certainly not one of the least, inasmuch as the weekly sale of  Crosswells ales for this town alone is more than 80,000 gallons per  week.    ~Brickkiln Lane,~ now called the Horse Fair, gives its own derivation.    ~Bright.~--The Right Hon. John Bright, though not a Birmingham man, nor  connected with the town by any ties of personal interest or business,  has for the last quarter-century been the leading member returned to  Parliament as representing the borough, and must always rank foremost  among our men of note. Mr. Bright is the son of the late Jacob Bright,  of Greenbank, near Rochdale, and was born November 16, 1811. He and his  brother, Mr. Jacob Bright, M.P. for Manchester, began business as  partners in the affiliated firms of John Bright and Brothers, cotton  spinners and manufacturers, Rochdale, and Bright and Co., carpet  manufacturers, Rochdale and Manchester. At an early age Mr. Bright  showed a keen interest in politics, and took part in the Reform  agitation of 1831-32. In those days every householder was compelled by  law to pay the Church-rates levied in his parish, whatever his religious  creed might be, and it is said that Mr. Bright's first flights of  oratory were delivered from a tombstone in Rochdale church-yard in  indignant denunciation of a tax which to him, as a member of the Society  of Friends, appeared especially odious. It was not, however, till 1839,  when he joined the Anti-Corn Law League, that Mr. Bright's reputation  spread beyond his own immediate neighbourhood; and there can be no doubt  but that his fervid addresses, coupled with the calmer and more logical  speeches of Mr. Cobden, contributed in an appreciable degree to the  success of the movement. In July, 1843, he was returned as M.P. for the  city of Durham, which he represented until the general election of 1847,  when he was the chosen of Manchester. For ten years he was Manchester's  man in everything, but the side he took in regard to the Russian war was  so much at variance with the popular opinions of his constituents that  they at last turned on him, burnt his effigy in the streets, and threw  him out at the general election in March, 1857. At the death of Mr. G.F.  Muntz, in July following, Mr. Bright was almost unanimously selected to  fill his place as M.P. for this town, and for 25 years he has continued  to honour Birmingham by permitting us to call him _our_ member. (See  \"_Parliamentary Elections_.\") Mr. Bright has been twice married, but is  now a widower, and he has twice held office in the Cabinet, first as  President of the Board Of Trade, and more lately as Chancellor of the  Duchy of Lancaster.    ~Bristol Road.~--Trees were first planted in this road in the spring of  1853.    ~Britannia Metal.~--A mixed metal formed of 90 parts of tin, 2 copper,  and 8 antimony, brought into use about 1790, and long a favourite with  manufacturers and public alike. The introduction of electroplating did  much towards its extended make at first, but latterly it has been in  great measure, replaced by German silver and other alloys.    ~British Association~ for the Advancement, of Science first met in this  town Aug. 26, 1839. They were here again Oct. 12, 1857, and Sep. 6,  1865.    ~Brittle Street~ formerly ran from Livery Street to Snow Hill, about the  spot where now the entrance gates to the Station are.    ~Broad Street.~--150 years ago part of what is now known as Dale End was  called Broad Street, the present thoroughfare of that name then being  only a pathway through the fields.    ~Brunswick Buildings.~--Erected in New Street, by Mr. Samuel Haines in  1854. A funny tale has been told about the original lease, which  included a covenant that at the expiration of the term of 100 years for  which it was granted, the land was to be delivered up to the Grammar  School \"well cropped with potatoes.\" In 1760 New Street _was_ a new  street indeed, for there were but a few cottages with gardens there  then, and the potatoe proviso was no doubt thought a capital provision;  but fancy growing that choice edibie there in 1860!    ~Buck.~--Henry Buck, P.G.M., and Sec. of the Birmingham district of the  Manchester Order of Oddfellows for twenty-five years, died Jan. 22,  1876, aged 63. A granite obelisk to his memory in St. Philip's  churchyard was unveiled Sep. 17, 1877.    ~Building Societies~ took early root here, as we find there were several  in 1781.--See \"_Friendly Societies_.\"    ~Buckles~ were worn as shoe fasteners in the reign of Charles II.--See  \"_Trades_.\"    ~Buttons.~--Some interesting notes respecting the manufacture of buttons  will be found under the head of \"_Trades_.\"    ~Bulgarian Atrocities, 1876-7.~--A considerable amount of \"political  capital\" was made out of these occurrences, but only L1,400 was  subscribed here for the relief of the unfortunates; while merely L540  could be raised towards helping the thousands of poor Bosnian refugees  driven from their homes by the Russians in 1878, and of this sum L200  was given by one person.    ~Bullbaiting~ was prohibited in 1773 by Order in Council, and an Act was  passed in 1835, to put a stop to all baiting of bulls, badgers, and  bears. At Chapel Wake, 1798, some law-defying reprobates started a  bullbaiting on Snow Hill, but the Loyal Association of Volunteers turned  out, and with drums beating and colours flying soon put the rebels to  flight, pursuing them as far as Birmingham Heath, where the baiters got  a beating, the Loyals returning home in triumph with the bull as a  trophy. The last time this \"sport\" was indulged in in this neighbourhood  appears to "]]]
