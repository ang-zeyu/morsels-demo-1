In our description of these boats in No. 25, Vol. XXI., special mention  was made of the compactness of the engines.    It has frequently been urged as an objection against the twin screw  system that the double set of engines, four steam cylinders with  duplicates of all the working parts called for on this system, render  the whole too complicated and heavy for small vessels, preventing, at  the same time, the application of surface condensation. In the engines  of the Spanish gunboats, of which we annex an illustration from  _Engineering_, the designer, Captain Ericsson, has overcome these  objections by introducing a surface condenser, which, while it performs  the function of condensing the steam to be returned to the boiler in the  form of fresh water, serves as the principal support of the engines,  dispensing entirely with the usual framework. Besides this expedient,  each pair of cylinders have their slide frames for guiding the movements  of the piston rods cast in one piece. Altogether the combination, is  such that the total weight and space occupied by these novel twin screw  engines do not exceed the ordinary single screw engines of equal  power. Several improvements connected with the working gear have been  introduced.    [Illustration: ENGINES OF THE TWIN SCREW SPANISH GUNBOATS]    The outer bearings of the propeller shafts, always difficult to regulate  and keep in order on the twin screw system, are selfadjusting and  accommodate themselves to every change of the direction of the shafts.  This is effected by their being spherical externally, and resting in  corresponding cavities in the stern braces or hangers. The spring  bearings for supporting the middle of the shafts are also arranged on a  similar self-adjusting principle.    The thrust bearing is of peculiar construction, the arrangement being  such that the bearing surfaces remain in perfect contact however much  the shaft may be out of line. The reversing gear likewise is quite  peculiar, insuring complete control over the movement of the two  propellers under all circumstances. It is claimed that these engines are  the lightest and most compact yet constructed for twin screw vessels.           *       *       *       *       *          The Torpedo Boat Problem.      The _Army and Navy Journal_ thinks the problem of a torpedo boat  capable of firing rapidly and with certainty, has at length reached a  satisfactory solution. It says:    \"A boat has been completed which is proved by experiment to be faultless  in machinery and arrangement. On the 2d of December, Secretary Robeson,  Vice-Admiral Porter, and Commodore Case, Chief of the Bureau of  Ordnance, went to the Navy Yard at Washington, to witness the experiment  with this new engine of destruction. After examining the workings of the  machinery, and the manner of firing, one of the destructives was put in  the frame and the party proceeded to the shore to witness the result. A  torpedo of only thirty-six pounds was first run out with rapidity and  fired; but the result showed that this small amount of powder, even,  would have been sufficient to destroy any ship, by lifting her out of  the water and breaking her back, even if her bottom was not knocked out  altogether. Mud and water were thrown up together, and the concussion  was felt far up in the Navy Yard, the ground being shaken by the shock  of the powder against the bed of the river. The concussion felt on board  the torpedo-boat was not more than that caused by a wave striking a  vessel at sea.    \"Several torpedoes were fired from the vessel, the explosion of  which the party witnessed on board, as they desired to ascertain for  themselves the effect of the shock. The result seemed satisfactory,  as no change whatever is contemplated in the machinery, which is very  simple, and 'works to a charm.' The torpedo vessel is the _Nina_, a very  strong iron boat of three hundred and fifty tuns burden, capable of  crossing the ocean, and having a speed of seventeen knots an hour. She  is not impervious to heavy shot, but can be made so, and is capable of  resisting any ordinary projectile that could be brought to bear on her  from the decks of a ship of war. Her decks will be made torpedo and  shot-proof, and several arrangements will be applied, now that it is  known that the torpedo system is a success. Such a vessel as the _Nina_,  attacking an enemy's squadron on our coast some dark night, or entering  an enemy's port, could destroy half the vessels in the harbor, and  easily escape as few vessels could overtake her. Such a vessel could,  for instance, enter the harbor of Havana, and destroy every vessel of  war in the port, under cover of darkness. A squadron supplied with such  boats to be used to attack, after the fight began, and the ships were  enveloped in smoke, would have a most decided advantage against an enemy  not thus armed for torpedo warfare. It is reported that our torpedo navy  will consist of twenty vessels, none of which will have a less speed  than twelve knots, and the fastest of them will go seventeen knots.\"           *       *       *       *       *          SUGAR MAKING IN LOUISIANA.      The New Orleans _Times_ contains, in a late number, an account of the  manufacture of sugar as conducted on the Poychas estate, from which we  extract portions containing the essential particulars of cane sugar  making as conducted in the southern portions of the United States.    \"Reaching the Cane shed, the crop, dumped into piles, is received by a  crowd of feeders, who place it (eight or ten stalks at a time) on the  cane carrier. This is an elevator, on an endless band of wood and iron,  which carries them to the second story, where the stalks drop between  the rollers. An immense iron tank below, called a juice box, receives  the liquid portion, and another elevator bears the bruised and broken  fragments to the opposite side of the building, where they are dropped  into the bagasse burner.    \"This invention, at its introduction, caused more scientific inquiry  and dispute, probably, than any other of the age, and settled beyond  question the possibility of combustion, without the use of atmospheric  air. The process consists in dropping the wet, spongy mass into a fire  of wood or coal, and closing the furnace doors. The steam arising from  the drying matter passes to a chamber in the rear, where, by the intense  heat, it is decomposed. Oxygen and hydrogen (both strong combustibles)  unite with the carbon, reaching there in the form of smoke, and a white  heat is the result.    \"Cane juice, as it escapes from the mill, could scarcely be considered  inviting to either palate or vision. The sweet, slimy mass of fluid,  covered with foam, and filled with sticks, has more the appearance of  the water in a brewer's vat than anything which now suggests itself. A  small furnace, containing a quantity of burning sulphur, sends through a  tube a volume of its stifling fumes, and these, caught by jets of steam,  thoroughly impregnate the contents of the juice box.

Indeed, I know nothing  better to introduce the student into the reading of connected narrative,  and to bridge the great gulf between the beginner's book of the  prevailing type and the Latinity of Caesar or Nepos. They are adapted to  this use not merely by reason of their simplicity and interest, but more  particularly by the graduating of difficulties and the large use of  Caesarian words and phrases to which Mr. Ritchie calls attention in his  preface.    Doubtless many American teachers have become familiar with portions of  the _Fabulae_, for they have been freely drawn upon in several Latin  readers recently published in this country. I venture to hope that those  who have made the acquaintance of the work in this way will welcome a  complete edition.    In England the little book has had a large use. Its pedagogical  excellencies are well summed up in a letter addressed to Mr. Ritchie by  the Very Rev. E.C. Wickham, formerly Head-Master of Wellington College,  the well-known editor of Horace:--    \"It launches the student at once in ancient life. The old classical  stories, simply told, seem to me much the best material for early Latin  reading. They are abundantly interesting; they are taken for granted in  the real literature of the language; and they can be told without  starting the beginner on a wrong track by a barbarous mixture of ancient  and modern ideas.    \"It combines, if I may say so, very skilfully, the interest of a  continuous story, with the gradual and progressive introduction of  constructions and idioms. These seem to me to be introduced at the right  moment, and to be played upon long enough to make them thoroughly  familiar.\"    In revising Mr. Ritchie's book for the use of American schools it has  seemed best to make extensive changes. Long vowels have been marked  throughout, and the orthography of Latin words has been brought into  conformity with our practice. Many liberties have been taken with the  text itself, especially in the latter part, in the way of making it  approximate more closely to our rather strict notions of the standards of  model prose. A few words and uses of words not found in the prose writers  of the republic have been retained, but nothing, it is hoped, that will  seriously mislead the young student. I shall welcome any criticism that  may lead to further changes in the text in future editions.    The notes are entirely new, and are intended for students who have but  just finished the beginner's book or have not yet finished it. Some notes  may appear at first sight unnecessary or unnecessarily hard, but the  reason for their insertion should be evident when the student begins the  reading of classical Latin, the difficulties of which will be less likely  to appal the beginner if some of them have been already conquered. I  believe it a mistake to postpone all treatment of the uses of the  subjunctive, for instance, or of the constructions of indirect discourse  until the study of Nepos or Caesar is begun. Besides, it is easier to  neglect notes than to supply them, and the teacher who prefers to do the  first reading without much attention to the more difficult constructions  will only need to tell his students to disregard certain of my notes--or  all of them.    There are no references to the grammars, but syntax has been given such  treatment as seemed needed to supplement its treatment in the beginner's  book. Teachers will therefore be able to postpone the use of a formal  manual of grammar, if they so desire. Those who wish their classes to  begin the reading of Latin at the earliest possible moment will find it  feasible to use this book as soon as the inflections and the more  elementary principles of syntax have been mastered.    In the vocabulary, the derivation or composition and the original meaning  of words have been indicated wherever these seemed likely to prove  helpful. Principal parts and genitives have been given in such a way as  to prevent misunderstanding, and at the same time emphasize the  composition of the verb or the suffix of the noun: for example, _abscídó,  -cídere, -cídí, -císus; aetás, -tátis_.    The lists of works of English literature and of art in which the myths  are treated are only suggestive. Occasional readings from the one and  exhibitions of representations of the other, either in the form of  photographs or by the stereopticon, will not only stimulate interest in  the Latin text but aid also in creating in the student a taste for  literature and for art.    I planned at first to add some exercises for retranslation, but after  careful consideration it has seemed not worth while. Most teachers will  prefer not to base composition upon the Latin read at this stage, and  those who wish to do so will find it an easy matter to prepare their own  exercises, or can draw upon the copious exercises prepared by Mr. Ritchie  and published separately under the title _Imitative Exercises in Easy  Latin Prose_.    In the reading of proof I have had generous help from Dr. F.K. Ball of  The Phillips Exeter Academy, Mr. J.C. Flood of St. Mark's School, and Mr.  A.T. Dudley of Noble and Greenough's School, Boston. The proof-sheets  have been used with the beginner's class in this Academy, and I have thus  been able to profit by the criticism of my associate Mr. G.B. Rogers, and  to test the work myself. The assistance of my wife has greatly lightened  the labor of verifying the vocabulary.    JOHN C. KIRTLAND, Jr.    EXETER, N.H., 7 March, 1903.          CONTENTS    THE MYTHS IN ENGLISH LITERATURE.
