[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10743"],[0,"Moonfleet (#10)"],[1," rather what a fine, tall gentleman Colonel Mohune had once been,  and a good soldier no doubt besides, than that he had wasted a noble  estate and played traitor to the king. And then I reflected that it was  all for the bit of flashing stone, which lay as I hoped within the  locket, that he had sold his honour; and wished that the jewel might  bring me better fortune than had fallen to him, or at any rate, that it  might not lead me into such miry paths. Yet such thoughts did not delay  my purpose, and I possessed myself of the locket easily enough, finding a  hasp in the chain, and so drawing it out from the linen folds. I had  expected as I moved the locket to hear the jewel rattle in the inside,  but there was no sound, and then I thought that the diamond might cleave  to the side with damp, or perhaps be wrapped in wool. Scarcely was the  locket well in my hand before I had it undone, finding a thumb-nick  whereby, after a little persuasion, the back, though rusted, could be  opened on a hinge. My breath came very fast, and I shook so that I had a  difficulty to keep my thumbnail in the nick, yet hardly was it opened  before exalted expectation gave place to deepest disappointment.    For there lay all the secret of the locket disclosed, and there was no  diamond, no, nor any other jewel, and nothing at all except a little  piece of folded paper. Then I felt like a man who has played away all his  property and stakes his last crown--heavy-hearted, yet hoping against  hope that luck may turn, and that with this piece he may win back all his  money. So it was with me; for I hoped that this paper might have written  on it directions for the finding of the jewel, and that I might yet rise  from the table a winner. It was but a frail hope, and quickly dashed; for  when I had smoothed the creases and spread out the piece of paper in the  candle-light, there was nothing to be seen except a few verses from the  Psalms of David. The paper was yellow, and showed a lattice of folds  where it had been pressed into the locket; but the handwriting, though  small, was clear and neat, and there was no mistaking a word of what was  there set down. 'Twas so short, I could read it at once:    The days of our age are threescore years and ten;  And though men be so strong that they come  To fourscore years, yet is their strength then  But labour and sorrow, so soon passeth it  Away, and we are gone.  --Psalm 90, 21    And as for me, my feet are almost gone;  My treadings are wellnigh slipped.  --73, 6    But let not the waterflood drown me; neither let  The deep swallow me up.  --69, 11    So, going through the vale of misery, I shall  Use it for a well, till the pools are filled  With water.  --84, 14    For thou hast made the North and the South:  Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.  --89, 6    So here was an end to great hopes, and I was after all to leave the vault  no richer than I had entered it. For look at it as I might, I could not  see that these verses could ever lead to any diamond; and though I might  otherwise have thought of ciphers or secret writing, yet, remembering  what Mr. Glennie had said, that Blackbeard after his wicked life desired  to make a good end, and sent for a parson to confess him, I guessed that  such pious words had been hung round his neck as a charm to keep the  spirits of evil away from his tomb. I was disappointed enough, but before  I left picked up the beard from the floor, though it sent a shiver  through me to touch it, and put it back in its place on the dead man's  breast. I restored also such pieces of the coffin as I could get at, but  could not make much of it; so left things as they were, trusting that  those who came there next would think the wood had fallen to pieces by  natural decay. But the locket I kept, and hung about my neck under my  shirt; both as being a curious thing in itself, and because I thought  that if the good words inside it were strong enough to keep off bad  spirits from Blackbeard, they would be also strong enough to keep  Blackbeard from me.    When this was done the candle had burnt so low, that I could no longer  hold it in my fingers, and was forced to stick it on a piece of the  broken wood, and so carry it before me. But, after all, I was not to  escape from Blackbeard's clutches so easily; for when I came to the end  of the passage, and was prepared to climb up into the churchyard, I found  that the hole was stopped, and that there was no exit.    I understood now how it was that I had heard talking so long after the  company had left the vault; for it was clear that Ratsey had been as  good as his word, and that the falling in of the ground had been  repaired before the contraband-men went home that night. At first I made  light of the matter, thinking I should soon be able to dislodge this new  work, and so find a way out. But when I looked more narrowly into the  business, I did not feel so sure; for they had made a sound job of it,  putting one very heavy burial slab at the side to pile earth against  till the hole was full, and then covering it with another. These were  both of slate, and I knew whence they came; for there were a dozen or  more of such disused and weather-worn covers laid up against the north  side of the church, and every one of them a good burden for four men.  Yet I hoped by grouting at the earth below it to be able to dislodge the  stone at the side; but while I was considering how best to begin, the  candle flickered, the wick gave a sudden lurch to one side, and I was  left in darkness.    Thus my plight was evil indeed, for I had nothing now to burn to give me  light, and knew that 'twas no use setting to grout till I could see to go  about it. Moreover, the darkness was of that black kind that is never  found beneath the open sky, no, not even on the darkest night, but lurks  in close and covered places and strains the eyes in trying to see into  it. Yet I did not give way, but settled to wait for the dawn, which must,  I knew, be now at hand; for then I thought enough light would come  through the chinks of the tomb above to show me how to set to work. Nor  was I even much scared, as one who having been in peril of life from the  contraband-men for a spy, and in peril from evil ghosts for rifling  Blackbeard's tomb, deemed it a light thing to be left in the dark to wait  an hour till morning. So I sat down on the floor of the passage, which,  if damp, was at least soft, and being tired with what I had gone through,  and not used to miss a night's rest, fell straightway asleep.    How long I slept I cannot tell, for I had nothing to guide me to the  time, but woke at length, and found myself still in darkness. I stood up  and stretched my limbs, but did not feel as one refreshed by wholesome  sleep, but sick and tired with pains in back, arms, and legs, as if  beaten or bruised. I have said I was still in darkness, yet it was not  the blackness of the last night; and looking up into the inside of the  tomb above, I could see the faintest line of light at one corner, which  showed the sun was up. For this line of light was the sunlight, filtering  slowly through a crevice at the joining of the stones; but the sides of  the tomb had been fitted much closer than I reckoned for, and it was  plain there would never be light in the place enough to guide me to my  work. All this I considered as I rested on the ground, for I had sat down  again, feeling too tired to stand. But as I kept my eye on the narrow  streak of light I was much startled, for I looked at the south-west  corner of the tomb, and yet was looking towards the sun. This I gathered  from the tone of the light; and although there was no direct outlet to  the air, and only a glimmer came in, as I have said, yet I knew certainly  that the sun was low in the west and falling full upon this stone.    Here was a surprise, and a sad one for me, for I perceived that I had  slept away a day, and that the sun was setting for another night. And yet  it mattered little, for night or daytime there was no light to help me in  this horrible place; and though my eyes had grown accustomed to the  gloom, I could make out nothing to show me where to work. So I took out  my tinder-box, meaning to fan the match into a flame, and to get at least  one moment's look at the place, and then to set to digging with my hands.    But as I lay asleep the top had been pressed off the box, and the tinder  got loose in my pocket; and though I picked the tinder out easily enough,  and got it in the box again, yet the salt damps of the place had soddened  it in the night, and spark by spark fell idle from the flint.    And then it was that I first perceived the danger in which I stood; for  there was no hope of kindling a light, and I doubted now whether even in  the light I could ever have done much to dislodge the great slab of  slate. I began also to feel very hungry, as not having eaten for  twenty-four hours; and worse than that, there was a parching thirst and  dryness in my throat, and nothing with which to quench it. Yet there was  no time to be lost if I was ever to get out alive, and so I groped with  my hands against the side of the grave until I made out the bottom edge  of the slab, and then fell to grubbing beneath it with my fingers. But  the earth, which the day before had looked light and loamy to the eye,  was stiff and hard enough when one came to tackle it with naked hands,  and in an hour's time I had done little more than further weary myself  and bruise my fingers.    Then I was forced to rest; and, sitting down on the ground, saw that the  glimmering streak of light had faded, and that the awful blackness of  the previous night was creeping up again. And now I had no heart to face  it, being cowed with hunger, thirst, and weariness; and so flung myself  upon my face, that I might not see how dark it was, and groaned for very  lowness of spirit. Thus I lay for a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10745"],[0,"The Story of the Champions of the Round Table (#10)"],[1," of the room,  leaving Sir Launcelot much perturbed in spirit. For he knew how great were  the arts of Queen Morgana le Fay, and he could not tell what harm she might  seek to work upon him by those arts. But he ever bore in mind how that the  ring which he wore was sovereign against such malignant arts as she  practised, wherefore he took what comfort he could from that circumstance.    Nevertheless, he abode in that chamber in great uncertainty for all that  day, and when night came he was afraid to let himself slumber, lest they of  the castle should come whilst he slept and work him some secret ill;  wherefore he remained awake whilst all the rest of the castle slept. Now at  the middle of the night, and about the time of the first cock-crow, he was  aware of a sound without and a light that fell through the crack of the  door. Then, in a little, the door was opened and there entered that young  damsel who had served him with his supper the night before, and she bare a  lighted taper in her hand.    [Sidenote: The damsel cometh again to Sir Launcelot] When Sir Launcelot  perceived that damsel he said: \"Maiden, do you come hither with good intent  or with evil intent?\" \"Sir,\" she said, \"I come with good intent, for I take  great pity to see you in such a sorry case as this. I am a King's daughter  in attendance upon Queen Morgana le Fay, but she is so powerful an  enchantress that, in good sooth, I am in great fear lest she some time do  me an ill-hap. So to-morrow I leave her service and return unto my father's  castle. Meantime, I am of a mind to help you in your adversity. For Queen  Morgana trusts me, and I have knowledge of this castle and I have all the  keys thereof, wherefore I can set you free. And I will set you free if you  will, upon your part, serve me in a way that you can very easily do.\"    \"Well,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"provided I may serve you in a way fitting my  knightly honor, I shall be glad to do so under any condition. Now I pray  you tell me what it is you would have of me.\"    [Sidenote: The damsel speaketh to Sir Launcelot of her father, King  Bagdemagus] \"Sir,\" said the damsel, \"my father hath made a tournament  betwixt him and the King of North Wales upon Tuesday next, and that is just  a fortnight from this day. Now, already my father hath lost one such a  tournament, for he hath no very great array of knights upon his side, and  the King of North Wales hath three knights of King Arthur's Round Table to  aid his party. Because of the great help of these knights of the Round  Table, the King of North Wales won the last tournament and my father lost  it, and now he feareth to lose the tournament that is to be. Now if you  will enter upon my father's side upon the day of the tournament, I doubt  not that he shall win that tournament; for all men say that you are the  greatest knight in the world at this time. So if you will promise to help  my father and will seal that promise with your knightly word, then will I  set you free of this castle of enchantment.\"    \"Fair maiden,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"tell me your name and your father's  name, for I cannot give you my promise until I know who ye be.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot promises to aid King Bagdemagus] \"Sir,\" said the  demoiselle, \"I am called Elouise the Fair, and my father is King  Bagdemagus.\" \"Ha!\" quoth Sir Launcelot, \"I know your father, and I know  that he is a good king and a very worthy knight besides. If you did me no  service whatsoever, I would, at your simple asking, were I free of this  place, lend him such aid as it is in my power to give.\"    At this the damsel took great joy and gave Sir Launcelot thanks beyond  measure. So they spoke together as to how that matter might be brought  about so that Sir Launcelot should be brought to talk to King Bagdemagus.  And the damsel Elouise said: \"Let it be this way, Sir Launcelot.  Imprimis--thou art to know that somewhat of a long distance to the  westward of that place where thou didst fall asleep yesterday, there  standeth a very large, fair abbey known as the Abbey of Saint James the  Lesser. This abbey is surrounded by an exceedingly noble estate that lieth  all around about it so that no man that haps in that part of the country  can miss it if he make inquiry for it. Now I will go and take lodging at  that abbey a little while after I leave this place. So when it suits thee  to do so, come thou thither and thou wilt find me there and I will bring  thee to my father.\"    \"Very well,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"let it be that way. I will come to that  place in good time for the tournament. Meantime, I prithee, rest in the  assurance that I shall never forgot thy kindness to me this day, nor thy  gracious behavior and speech unto me. Wherefore I shall deem it not a duty  but a pleasure to serve thee.\"    [Sidenote: The damsel bringeth Sir Launcelot to freedom] So, having  arranged all these matters, the damsel Elouise opened the door of that room  and led Sir Launcelot out thence; and she led him through various passages  and down several long flights of steps, and so brought him at last unto a  certain chamber, where was his armor. Then the damsel helped Sir Launcelot  to encase him in his armor, so that in a little while he was altogether  armed as he had been when he fell asleep under that apple-tree. Thereafter  the damsel brought him out past the court-yard and unto the stable where  was Sir Launcelot's horse, and the horse knew him when he came. So he  saddled the horse by the light of a half-moon which sailed like a boat high  up in the sky through the silver, floating clouds, and therewith he was  ready to depart. Then the damsel opened the gate and he rode out into the  night, which was now drawing near the dawning of the day.    Thus Elouise the Fair aided Sir Launcelot to escape from that castle of  enchantment, where else great ill might have befallen him.           *       *       *       *       *    And now it shall be told how Sir Launcelot did battle with Sir Turquine and  of what happened thereat.    [Illustration: Sir Launcelot doeth battle with Sir Turquine]          Chapter Fourth      _How Sir Launcelot Sought Sir Lionel and How a Young Damsel Brought Him to  the Greatest Battle that Ever He Had in All His Life_.    So Sir Launcelot rode through the forest, and whilst he rode the day began  to break. About sunrise he came out into an open clearing where certain  charcoal-burners were plying their trade.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot breaks his fast in the forest] To these rude  fellows he appeared out of the dark forest like some bright and shining  vision; and they made him welcome and offered him to eat of their food, and  he dismounted and sat down with them and brake his fast with them. And when  he had satisfied his hunger, he gave them grammercy for their  entertainment, and took horse and rode away.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot cometh again to the place of the apple-tree] He  made forward until about the middle of the morning, what time he came  suddenly upon that place where, two days before, he had fallen asleep  beneath the blooming apple-tree. Here he drew rein and looked about him for  a considerable while; for he thought that haply he might find some trace of  Sir Lionel thereabouts. But there was no trace of him, and Sir Launcelot  wist not what had become of him.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot perceives a damsel upon a palfrey] Now whilst Sir  Launcelot was still there, not knowing what to do to find Sir Lionel, there  passed that way a damsel riding upon a white palfrey. Unto her Sir  Launcelot made salutation, and she made salutation to him and asked him  what cheer. \"Maiden,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"the cheer that I have is not  very good, seeing that I have lost my companion-at-arms and know not where  he is.\" Then he said: \"Did you haply meet anywhere with a knight with the  figure of a red gryphon upon his shield?\" whereunto the damsel answered:  \"Nay, I saw none such.\" Then Sir Launcelot said: \"Tell me, fair damsel,  dost thou know of any adventure hereabouts that I may undertake? For, as  thou seest, I am errant and in search of such.\"    Upon this the damsel fell a-laughing: \"Yea, Sir Knight,\" said she, \"I know  of an adventure not far away, but it is an adventure that no knight yet  that ever I heard tell of hath accomplished. I can take thee to that  adventure if thou hast a desire to pursue it.\"    \"Why should I not pursue it,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"seeing that I am here  for that very cause--to pursue adventure?\"    \"Well,\" said the damsel, \"then come with me, Sir Knight, I will take thee  to an adventure that shall satisfy thee.\"    [Sidenote: The damsel leads Sir Launcelot to an adventure] So Sir  Launcelot and that damsel rode away from that place together; he upon his  great war-horse and she upon her ambling palfrey beside him. And the sun  shone down upon them, very pleasant and warm, and all who passed them  turned to look after them; for the maiden was very fair and slender, and  Sir Launcelot was of so noble and stately a mien that few could behold him  even from a distance without looking twice or three times upon him. And as  they travelled in that way together they fell into converse, and the damsel  said to Sir Launcelot: \"Sir, thou appearest to be a very good knight, and  of such a sort as may well undertake any adventure with great hope of  success. Now I prithee to tell me thy name and what knight thou art.\"    \"Fair maiden,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"as for telling you my name, that I will  gladly do. I am called Sir Launcelot of the Lake, and I am a knight of King  Arthur's court and of his Round Table.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot and the maiden discourse together] At this the  damsel was very greatly astonished and filled with admiration. \"Hah!\" quoth  she, \"it is a great pleasure to me to fall in with you, Sir Launcelot, for  all the world now bespeaketh your fame. Little did I ever think to behold  your person, much"]]]
