My darling boys,    You are twelve and eight years old. Soon you will be grown up. You will  leave home and begin your own lives. I have been thinking about that  day, wondering what I could do to help you. At last, I have had an idea.  The best compass is a thorough understanding of the growth and the  experience of the human race. Why should I not write a special  history for you?    So I took my faithful Corona and five bottles of ink and a box of  matches and a bale of paper and began to work upon the first volume. If  all goes well there will be eight more and they will tell you what you  ought to know of the last six thousand years.    But before you start to read let me explain what I intend to do.    I am not going to present you with a textbook. Neither will it be a  volume of pictures. It will not even be a regular history in the  accepted sense of the word.    I shall just take both of you by the hand and together we shall wander  forth to explore the intricate wilderness of the bygone ages.    I shall show you mysterious rivers which seem to come from nowhere and  which are doomed to reach no ultimate destination.    I shall bring you close to dangerous abysses, hidden carefully beneath a  thick overgrowth of pleasant but deceiving romance.    Here and there we shall leave the beaten track to scale a solitary and  lonely peak, towering high above the surrounding country.    Unless we are very lucky we shall sometimes lose ourselves in a sudden  and dense fog of ignorance.    Wherever we go we must carry our warm cloak of human sympathy and  understanding for vast tracts of land will prove to be a sterile  desert--swept by icy storms of popular prejudice and personal greed and  unless we come well prepared we shall forsake our faith in humanity and  that, dear boys, would be the worst thing that could happen to any  of us.    I shall not pretend to be an infallible guide. Whenever you have a  chance, take counsel with other travelers who have passed along the same  route before. Compare their observations with mine and if this leads you  to different conclusions, I shall certainly not be angry with you.    I have never preached to you in times gone by.    I am not going to preach to you today.    You know what the world expects of you--that you shall do your share of  the common task and shall do it bravely and cheerfully.    If these books can help you, so much the better.    And with all my love I dedicate these histories to you and to the boys  and girls who shall keep you company on the voyage through life.

THE END OF THE ANCIENT WORLD        PREHISTORIC MAN    It took Columbus more than four weeks to sail from Spain to the West  Indian Islands. We on the other hand cross the ocean in sixteen hours in  a flying machine.    Five hundred years ago, three or four years were necessary to copy a  book by hand. We possess linotype machines and rotary presses and we can  print a new book in a couple of days.    We understand a great deal about anatomy and chemistry and mineralogy  and we are familiar with a thousand different branches of science of  which the very name was unknown to the people of the past.    In one respect, however, we are quite as ignorant as the most primitive  of men--we do not know where we came from. We do not know how or why or  when the human race began its career upon this Earth. With a million  facts at our disposal we are still obliged to follow the example of the  fairy-stories and begin in the old way:      \"Once upon a time there was a man.\"    This man lived hundreds of thousands of years ago.    What did he look like?    We do not know. We never saw his picture. Deep in the clay of an ancient  soil we have sometimes found a few pieces of his skeleton. They were  hidden amidst masses of bones of animals that have long since  disappeared from the face of the earth. We have taken these bones and  they allow us to reconstruct the strange creature who happens to be  our ancestor.    The great-great-grandfather of the human race was a very ugly and  unattractive mammal. He was quite small. The heat of the sun and the  biting wind of the cold winter had colored his skin a dark brown. His  head and most of his body were covered with long hair. He had very thin  but strong fingers which made his hands look like those of a monkey. His  forehead was low and his jaw was like the jaw of a wild animal which  uses its teeth both as fork and knife.    [Illustration: PREHISTORIC MAN.]    He wore no clothes. He had seen no fire except the flames of the  rumbling volcanoes which filled the earth with their smoke and  their lava.    He lived in the damp blackness of vast forests.    When he felt the pangs of hunger he ate raw leaves and the roots of  plants or he stole the eggs from the nest of an angry bird.    Once in a while, after a long and patient chase, he managed to catch a  sparrow or a small wild dog or perhaps a rabbit These he would eat raw,  for prehistoric man did not know that food could be cooked.    His teeth were large and looked like the teeth of many of our own  animals.    During the hours of day this primitive human being went about in search  of food for himself and his wife and his young.    At night, frightened by the noise of the beasts, who were in search of  prey, he would creep into a hollow tree or he would hide himself behind  a few big boulders, covered with moss and great, big spiders.    In summer he was exposed to the scorching rays of the sun.    During the winter he froze with cold.    When he hurt himself (and hunting animals are for ever breaking their  bones or spraining their ankles) he had no one to take care of him.    He had learned how to make certain sounds to warn his fellow-beings  whenever danger threatened. In this he resembled a dog who barks when a  stranger approaches. In many other respects he was far less attractive  than a well-bred house pet.    Altogether, early man was a miserable creature who lived in a world of  fright and hunger, who was surrounded by a thousand enemies and who was  for ever haunted by the vision of friends and relatives who had been  eaten up by wolves and bears and the terrible sabre-toothed tiger.    Of the earliest history of this man we know nothing. He had no tools and  he built no homes. He lived and died and left no traces of his  existence. We keep track of him through his bones and they tell us that  he lived more than two thousand centuries ago.    The rest is darkness.    Until we reach the time of the famous Stone Age, when man learned the  first rudimentary principles of what we call civilization.    Of this Stone Age I must tell you in some detail.        THE WORLD GROWS COLD    Something was the matter with the weather.    Early man did not know what \"time\" meant.    He kept no records of birthdays and wedding-anniversaries or the hour of  death.    He had no idea of days or weeks or years.    When the sun arose in the morning he did not say \"Behold another day.\"  He said \"It is Light\" and he used the rays of the early sun to gather  food for his family.    When it grew dark, he returned to his wife and children, gave them part  of the day's catch (some berries and a few birds), stuffed himself full  with raw meat and went to sleep.    In a very general way he kept track of the seasons. Long experience had  taught him that the cold Winter was invariably followed by the mild  Spring--that Spring grew into the hot Summer when fruits ripened and the  wild ears of corn were ready to be plucked and eaten. The Summer ended  when gusts of wind swept the leaves from the trees and when a number of  animals crept into their holes to make ready for the long  hibernal sleep.    [Illustration: THE GLACIAL PERIOD.]    It had always been that way. Early man accepted these useful changes of  cold and warm but asked no questions. He lived and that was enough to  satisfy him.    Suddenly, however, something happened that worried him greatly.    The warm days of Summer had come very late. The fruits had not ripened  at all. The tops of the mountains which used to be covered with grass  lay deeply hidden under a heavy burden of snow.    Then one morning quite a number of wild people, different from the other  inhabitants of his valley had approached from the region of the  high peaks.    They muttered sounds which no one could understand. They looked lean and  appeared to be starving. Hunger and cold seemed to have driven them from  their former homes.    There was not enough food in the valley for both the old inhabitants and  the newcomers. When they tried to stay more than a few days there was a  terrible fight and whole families were killed. The others fled into the  woods and were not seen again.    For a long time nothing occurred of any importance.    But all the while, the days grew shorter and the nights were colder than  they ought to have been.    Finally, in a gap between the two high hills, there appeared a tiny  speck of greenish ice. It increased in size as the years went by. Very  slowly a gigantic glacier was sliding down the slopes of the mountain  ridge. Huge stones were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10002"],[0,"The House on the Borderland (#10)"],[1,"irst, I went down to the basement, and, rummaging 'round,  found several pieces of heavy oak planking. With these, I returned to  the study, and, having removed the props, placed the planks up against  the door. Then, I nailed the heads of the struts to these, and, driving  them well home at the bottoms, nailed them again there.    Thus, I made the door stronger than ever; for now it was solid with the  backing of boards, and would, I felt convinced, stand a heavier pressure  than hitherto, without giving way.    After that, I lit the lamp which I had brought from the kitchen, and  went down to have a look at the lower windows.    Now that I had seen an instance of the strength the creatures  possessed, I felt considerable anxiety about the windows on the ground  floor--in spite of the fact that they were so strongly barred.    I went first to the buttery, having a vivid remembrance of my late  adventure there. The place was chilly, and the wind, soughing in through  the broken glass, produced an eerie note. Apart from the general air of  dismalness, the place was as I had left it the night before. Going up to  the window, I examined the bars, closely; noting, as I did so, their  comfortable thickness. Still, as I looked more intently, it seemed to  me, that the middle bar was bent slightly from the straight; yet it was  but trifling, and it might have been so for years. I had never, before,  noticed them particularly.    I put my hand through the broken window, and shook the bar. It was as  firm as a rock. Perhaps the creatures had tried to 'start' it, and,  finding it beyond their power, ceased from the effort. After that, I  went 'round to each of the windows, in turn; examining them with careful  attention; but nowhere else could I trace anything to show that there  had been any tampering. Having finished my survey, I went back to the  study, and poured myself out a little brandy. Then to the tower  to watch.        _VIII_    AFTER THE ATTACK    It was now about three a.m., and, presently, the Eastern sky began to  pale with the coming of dawn. Gradually, the day came, and, by its  light, I scanned the gardens, earnestly; but nowhere could I see any  signs of the brutes. I leant over, and glanced down to the foot of the  wall, to see whether the body of the Thing I had shot the night before  was still there. It was gone. I supposed that others of the monsters had  removed it during the night.    Then, I went down on to the roof, and crossed over to the gap from  which the coping stone had fallen. Reaching it, I looked over. Yes,  there was the stone, as I had seen it last; but there was no appearance  of anything beneath it; nor could I see the creatures I had killed,  after its fall. Evidently, they also had been taken away. I turned, and  went down to my study. There, I sat down, wearily. I was thoroughly  tired. It was quite light now; though the sun's rays were not, as yet,  perceptibly hot. A clock chimed the hour of four.    I awoke, with a start, and looked 'round, hurriedly. The clock in the  corner, indicated that it was three o'clock. It was already afternoon. I  must have slept for nearly eleven hours.    With a jerky movement, I sat forward in the chair, and listened. The  house was perfectly silent. Slowly, I stood up, and yawned. I felt  desperately tired, still, and sat down again; wondering what it was that  had waked me.    It must have been the clock striking, I concluded, presently; and was  commencing to doze off, when a sudden noise brought me back, once more,  to life. It was the sound of a step, as of a person moving cautiously  down the corridor, toward my study. In an instant, I was on my feet, and  grasping my rifle. Noiselessly, I waited. Had the creatures broken in,  whilst I slept? Even as I questioned, the steps reached my door, halted  momentarily, and then continued down the passage. Silently, I tiptoed to  the doorway, and peeped out. Then, I experienced such a feeling of  relief, as must a reprieved criminal--it was my sister. She was going  toward the stairs.    I stepped into the hall, and was about to call to her, when it occurred  to me, that it was very queer she should have crept past my door, in  that stealthy manner. I was puzzled, and, for one brief moment, the  thought occupied my mind, that it was not she, but some fresh mystery of  the house. Then, as I caught a glimpse of her old petticoat, the thought  passed as quickly as it had come, and I half laughed. There could be no  mistaking that ancient garment. Yet, I wondered what she was doing; and,  remembering her condition of mind, on the previous day, I felt that it  might be best to follow, quietly--taking care not to alarm her--and see  what she was going to do. If she behaved rationally, well and good; if  not, I should have to take steps to restrain her. I could run no  unnecessary risks, under the danger that threatened us.    Quickly, I reached the head of the stairs, and paused a moment. Then,  I heard a sound that sent me leaping down, at a mad rate--it was the  rattle of bolts being unshot. That foolish sister of mine was actually  unbarring the back door.    Just as her hand was on the last bolt, I reached her. She had not seen  me, and, the first thing she knew, I had hold of her arm. She glanced up  quickly, like a frightened animal, and screamed aloud.    'Come, Mary!' I said, sternly, 'what's the meaning of this nonsense? Do  you mean to tell me you don't understand the danger, that you try to  throw our two lives away in this fashion!'    To this, she replied nothing; only trembled, violently, gasping and  sobbing, as though in the last extremity of fear.    Through some minutes, I reasoned with her; pointing out the need for  caution, and asking her to be brave. There was little to be afraid of  now, I explained--and, I tried to believe that I spoke the truth--but  she must be sensible, and not attempt to leave the house for a few days.    At last, I ceased, in despair. It was no use talking to her; she was,  obviously, not quite herself for the time being. Finally, I told her she  had better go to her room, if she could not behave rationally.    Still, she took not any notice. So, without more ado, I picked her up  in my arms, and carried her there. At first, she screamed, wildly; but  had relapsed into silent trembling, by the time I reached the stairs.    Arriving at her room, I laid her upon the bed. She lay there quietly  enough, neither speaking nor sobbing--just shaking in a very ague of  fear. I took a rug from a chair near by, and spread it over her. I could  do nothing more for her, and so, crossed to where Pepper lay in a big  basket. My sister had taken charge of him since his wound, to nurse him,  for it had proved more severe than I had thought, and I was pleased to  note that, in spite of her state of mind, she had looked after the old  dog, carefully. Stooping, I spoke to him, and, in reply, he licked my  hand, feebly. He was too ill to do more.    Then, going to the bed, I bent over my sister, and asked her how she  felt; but she only shook the more, and, much as it pained me, I had to  admit that my presence seemed to make her worse.    And so, I left her--locking the door, and pocketing the key. It seemed  to be the only course to take.    The rest of the day, I spent between the tower and my study. For food,  I brought up a loaf from the pantry, and on this, and some claret, I  lived for that day.    What a long, weary day it was. If only I could have gone out into the  gardens, as is my wont, I should have been content enough; but to be  cooped in this silent house, with no companion, save a mad woman and a  sick dog, was enough to prey upon the nerves of the hardiest. And out in  the tangled shrubberies that surrounded the house, lurked--for all I  could tell--those infernal Swine-creatures waiting their chance. Was  ever a man in such straits?    Once, in the afternoon, and again, later, I went to visit my sister.  The second time, I found her tending Pepper; but, at my approach, she  slid over, unobtrusively, to the far corner, with a gesture that  saddened me beyond belief. Poor girl! her fear cut me intolerably, and I  would not intrude on her, unnecessarily. She would be better, I trusted,  in a few days; meanwhile, I could do nothing; and I judged it still  needful--hard as it seemed--to keep her confined to her room. One thing  there was that I took for encouragement: she had eaten some of the food  I had taken to her, on my first visit.    And so the day passed.    As the evening drew on, the air grew chilly, and I began to make  preparations for passing a second night in the tower--taking up two  additional rifles, and a heavy ulster. The rifles I loaded, and laid  alongside my other; as I intended to make things warm for any of the  creatures who might show, during the night. I had plenty of ammunition,  and I thought to give the brutes such a lesson, as should show them the  uselessness of attempting to force an entrance.    After that, I made the 'round of the house again; paying particular  attention to the props that supported the study door. Then, feeling that  I had done all that lay in my power to insure our safety, I returned to  the tower; calling in on my sister and Pepper, for a final visit, on the  way. Pepper was asleep; but woke, as I entered, and wagged his tail, in  recognition. I thought he seemed slightly better. My sister was lying on  the bed; though whether asleep or not, I was unable to tell; and thus I  left them.    Reaching the tower, I made myself as comfortable as circumstances would  permit, and settled down to watch through the night. Gradually, darkness  fell, and soon the details of the gardens were merged into shadows.  During the first few hours, I sat, alert, listening for any sound that  might help to tell me if anything were stirring down below. It was far  too dark for my eyes to be of much use.    Slowly, the hours passed; "]]]
