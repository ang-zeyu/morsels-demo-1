Says he,  'Smoot, did you vote for me?' I told him I did. 'Well,' says he, 'you  must loan me money to buy suitable clothing, for I want to make a decent  appearance in the Legislature.' I then loaned him two hundred dollars,  which he returned to me according to promise.\"    Lincoln's old friend W.G. Greene relates that while he was a student at  the Illinois College at Jacksonville he became acquainted with Richard  Yates, then also a student. One summer while Yates was his guest during  the vacation, Greene took him up to Salem and made him acquainted with  Lincoln. They found the latter flat on his back on a cellar door reading  a newspaper. Greene introduced the two, and thus began the acquaintance  between the future War-Governor of Illinois and the future President.    Lincoln was from boyhood an adept at expedients for avoiding any  unpleasant predicament, and one of his modes of getting rid of  troublesome friends, as well as troublesome enemies, was by telling a  story. He began these tactics early in life, and he grew to be  wonderfully adept in them. If a man broached a subject which he did not  wish to discuss, he told a story which changed the direction of the  conversation. If he was called upon to answer a question, he answered it  by telling a story. He had a story for everything; something had  occurred at some place where he used to live that illustrated every  possible phase of every possible subject with which he might have  connection. He acquired the habit of story-telling naturally, as we  learn from the following statement: \"At home, with his step-mother and  the children, he was the most agreeable fellow in the world. He was  always ready to do everything for everybody. When he was not doing some  special act of kindness, he told stories or 'cracked jokes.' He was as  full of his yarns in Indiana as ever he was in Illinois. Dennis Hanks  was a clever hand at the same business, and so was old Tom Lincoln.\" It  was while Lincoln was salesman for Offutt that he acquired the  _sobriquet_ of \"Honest Abe.\" Says Mr. Arnold: \"Of many incidents  illustrating his integrity, one or two may be mentioned. One evening he  found his cash overran a little, and he discovered that in making change  for his last customer, an old woman who had come in a little before  sundown, he had made a mistake, not having given her quite enough.  Although the amount was small, a few cents, he took the money,  immediately walked to her house, and corrected the error. At another  time, on his arrival at the store in the morning, he found on the scales  a weight which he remembered having used just before closing, but which  was not the one he had intended to use. He had sold a parcel of tea, and  in the hurry had placed the wrong weight on the scales, so that the  purchaser had a few ounces less of tea than had been paid for. He  immediately sent the quantity required to make up the deficiency. These  and many similar incidents are told regarding his scrupulous honesty in  the most trifling matters. It was for such things as these that people  gave him the name which clung to him as long as he lived.\"    It was in the summer of 1831 that Abraham Lincoln performed his first  official act. Minter Graham, the school-teacher, tells the story. \"On  the day of the election, in the month of August, Abe was seen loitering  about the polling place. It was but a few days after his arrival in New  Salem. They were 'short of a clerk' at the polls; and, after casting  about in vain for some one competent to fill the office, it occurred to  one of the judges that perhaps the tall stranger possessed the needful  qualifications. He thereupon accosted him, and asked if he could write.  He replied, 'Yes, a little.' 'Will you act as clerk of the election  to-day?' said the judge. 'I will try,' returned Abe, 'and do the best I  can, if you so request.'\" He did try accordingly, and, in the language  of the schoolmaster, \"performed the duties with great facility,  firmness, honesty, and impartiality. I clerked with him,\" says Mr.  Graham, \"on the same day and at the same polls. The election books are  now in the city of Springfield, where they can be seen and inspected any  day.\"    That the foregoing anecdotes bearing on the early life of Abraham  Lincoln are approximately correct is borne out by Lincoln himself. At  the urgent request of Hon. Jesse W. Fell, of Bloomington, Illinois,  Lincoln wrote a sketch of himself to be used during the campaign of  1860. In a note which accompanied the sketch he said: \"Herewith is a  little sketch, as you requested. There is not much to it, for the  reason, I suppose, that there is not much of me. If anything be made out  of it I wish it to be modest and not to go beyond the material.\" The  letter is as follows:         I was born Feb. 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. My parents       were both born in Virginia, of undistinguishable families--second       families, perhaps I should say. My mother, who died in my tenth       year, was of a family of the name of Hanks, some of whom now reside       in Adams, and others in Macon Counties, Illinois. My paternal       grandfather, Abraham Lincoln, emigrated from Rockingham County,       Virginia, to Kentucky, about 1781 or '2, where, a year or two       later, he was killed by Indians, not in battle, but by stealth,       when he was laboring to open a farm in the forest. His ancestors,       who were Quakers, went to Virginia from Berks County, Pennsylvania.       An effort to identify them with the New England family of the same       name, ended in nothing more than a similarity of Christian names in       both families, such as Enoch, Levi, Mordecai, Solomon, Abraham, and       the like.         My father, at the death of his father, was but six years of age,       and he grew up literally without education. He removed from       Kentucky to what is now Spencer County, Indiana, in my eighth year.       We reached our new home about the time the State came into the       Union. It was a wild region, with many bears and other wild animals       still in the woods. There I grew up. There were some schools, so       called, but no qualification was ever required of a teacher beyond       'readin', writin' and cipherin'' to the Rule of Three. If a       straggler, supposed to understand Latin, happened to sojourn in the       neighborhood, he was looked upon as a wizard. There was absolutely       nothing to excite ambition for education. Of course when I came of       age I did not know much. Still, somehow, I could read, write, and       cipher to the Rule of Three, but that was all. I have not been to       school since. The little advance I now have upon this store of       education, I have picked up from time to time under the pressure of       necessity.         I was raised to farm work, which I continued till I was twenty-two.       At twenty-one I came to Illinois, and passed the first year in       Macon County. Then I got to New Salem, at that time in Sangamon,       now in Menard County, where I remained a year as a sort of clerk in       a store. Then came the Black Hawk War, and I was elected a Captain       of Volunteers--a success which gave me more pleasure than any I       have had since. I went through the campaign, was elated, ran for       the Legislature the same year (1832), and was beaten--the only time       I have ever been beaten by the people. The next, and three       succeeding biennial elections, I was elected to the Legislature. I       was not a candidate afterwards. During this legislative period I       had studied law, and removed to Springfield to practice it. In       1846 I was once elected to the Lower House of Congress, but was not       a candidate for re-election. From 1849 to 1854, both inclusive,       practiced law more assiduously than ever before. Always a Whig in       politics, and generally on the Whig electoral tickets, making       active canvasses. I was losing interest in politics, when the       repeal of the Missouri Compromise aroused me again. What I have       done since then is pretty well known.         If any personal description of me is thought desirable, it may be       said, I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh,       weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark       complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes. No other marks       or brands recollected.         Yours very truly,       A. LINCOLN.

The spring of 1832 brought a new turn in Lincoln's career. The year had  been one of great advancement in many respects. He had made new and  valuable acquaintances, read many books, mastered the grammar of his own  tongue, won a multitude of friends. Those who could appreciate  intelligence and character respected him, and those whose highest ideas  of a man related to his physical prowess were devoted to him. Everyone  trusted him. He was judge, arbitrator, referee, authority in all  disputes, games, and matches whether of man-flesh or horse-flesh. He was  the peacemaker in all quarrels. He was everybody's friend--the  best-natured, most sensible, best-informed, most modest, unassuming,  kindest, gentlest, roughest, strongest, best young fellow in all New  Salem or the region about. But Mr. Offutt's trading enterprises ended  disastrously in the year 1832.

But the first  two have a nominative use, and _mine_ in the second has an objective  use.    They may be spoken of as possessive in form, but nominative or  objective in use, according as the modified word is in the nominative  or the objective.        III. The Objective.      [Sidenote: _The old_ dative _case._]    89. In Old English there was one case which survives in use, but not  in form. In such a sentence as this one from Thackeray, \"Pick _me_ out  a whip-cord thong with some dainty knots in it,\" the word _me_ is  evidently not the direct object of the verb, but expresses _for whom_,  _for whose benefit_, the thing is done. In pronouns, this dative  use, as it is called, was marked by a separate case.    [Sidenote: _Now the objective._]    In Modern English the same _use_ is frequently seen, but the _form_ is  the same as the objective. For this reason a word thus used is called  a dative-objective.    The following are examples of the dative-objective:--         Give _me_ neither poverty nor riches.--_Bible._         Curse _me_ this people.--_Id._         Both joined in making _him_ a present.--MACAULAY         Is it not enough that you have _burnt me_ down three houses with       your dog's tricks, and be hanged to you!--LAMB         I give _thee_ this to wear at the collar.--SCOTT      [Sidenote: _Other uses of the objective._]    90. Besides this use of the objective, there are others:--    (1) _As the direct object of a verb._         They all handled _it_.--LAMB    (2) _As the object of a preposition._         Time is behind _them_ and before _them_.--CARLYLE.    (3) _In apposition._         She sate all last summer by the bedside of the blind beggar,       _him_ that so often and so gladly I talked with.--DE QUINCEY.        SPECIAL USES OF PERSONAL PRONOUNS.      [Sidenote: _Indefinite use of_ you _and_ your.]    91. The word _you_, and its possessive case _yours_ are sometimes  used without reference to a particular person spoken to. They approach  the indefinite pronoun in use.         _Your_ mere puny stripling, that winced at the least flourish of       the rod, was passed by with indulgence.--IRVING         To empty here, _you_ must condense there.--EMERSON.         The peasants take off their hats as _you_ pass; _you_ sneeze, and       they cry, \"God bless you!\" The thrifty housewife shows _you_ into       her best chamber. _You_ have oaten cakes baked some months       before.--LONGFELLOW      [Sidenote: _Uses of_ it.]    92. The pronoun _it_ has a number of uses:--    (1) _To refer to some single word preceding_; as,--         Ferdinand ordered the _army_ to recommence _its_ march.--BULWER.         _Society_, in this century, has not made _its_ progress, like       Chinese skill, by a greater acuteness of ingenuity in       trifles.--D. WEBSTER.    (2) _To refer to a preceding word group_; thus,--         If any man should do wrong merely out of ill nature, why, yet       _it_ is but like the thorn or brier, which prick and scratch       because they can do no other.--BACON.    Here _it_ refers back to the whole sentence before it, or to the idea,  \"any man's doing wrong merely out of ill nature.\"    (3) _As a grammatical subject, to stand for the real, logical  subject, which follows the verb_; as in the sentences,--         _It_ is easy in the world _to live after the world's opinion_.       --EMERSON.         _It_ is this _haziness_ of intellectual vision which is the       malady of all classes of men by nature.--NEWMAN.         _It_ is a pity _that he has so much learning, or that he has not       a great deal more_.--ADDISON.    (4) _As an impersonal subject in certain expressions which need no  other subject_; as,--         _It_ is finger-cold, and prudent farmers get in their barreled       apples.--THOREAU.         And when I awoke, _it_ rained.--COLERIDGE.         For when _it_ dawned, they dropped their arms.--_Id._         _It_ was late and after midnight.--DE QUINCEY.    (5) _As an impersonal or indefinite object of a verb or a  preposition_; as in the following sentences:--         (_a_) Michael Paw, who _lorded it_ over the fair regions of       ancient Pavonia.--IRVING.         I made up my mind _to foot it_.--HAWTHORNE.         A sturdy lad ... who in turn tries all the professions, who       _teams it, farms it, peddles it_, keeps a school.--EMERSON.         (_b_) \"Thy mistress leads thee a dog's life _of it_.\"--IRVING.         There was nothing _for it_ but to return.--SCOTT.         An editor has only to say \"respectfully declined,\" and there is       an end _of it_.--HOLMES.         Poor Christian was hard put _to it_.--BUNYAN.      [Sidenote: _Reflexive use of the personal pronouns._]    93. The personal pronouns in the objective case are often used  _reflexively_; that is, referring to the same person as the subject of  the accompanying verb. For example, we use such expressions as, \"I  found _me_ a good book,\" \"He bought _him_ a horse,\" etc. This  reflexive use of the _dative_-objective is very common in spoken and  in literary English.    The personal pronouns are not often used reflexively, however, when  they are _direct_ objects. This occurs in poetry, but seldom in prose;  as,--         Now I lay _me_ down to sleep.--ANON.         I set _me_ down and sigh.--BURNS.         And millions in those solitudes, since first       The flight of years began, have laid _them_ down       In their last sleep.--BRYANT.        REFLEXIVE OR COMPOUND PERSONAL PRONOUNS.      [Sidenote: _Composed of the personal pronouns with_ -self, -selves.]    94. The REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS, or COMPOUND PERSONAL, as they are also  called, are formed from the personal pronouns by adding the word  _self_, and its plural _selves_.    They are _myself_, (_ourself_), _ourselves_, _yourself_, (_thyself_),  _yourselves_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, _themselves_.    Of the two forms in parentheses, the second is the old form of the  second person, used in poetry.    _Ourself_ is used to follow the word _we_ when this represents a  single person, especially in the speech of rulers; as,--         Methinks he seems no better than a girl;       As girls were once, as we _ourself_ have been.--TENNYSON.      [Sidenote: _Origin of these reflexives._]    95. The question might arise, Why are _himself_ and _themselves_ not  _hisself_ and _theirselves_, as in vulgar English, after the analogy  of _myself_, _ourselves_, etc.?    The history of these words shows they are made up of the  dative-objective forms, not the possessive forms, with _self_. In  Middle English the forms _meself_, _theself_, were changed into the  possessive _myself_, _thyself_, and the others were formed by analogy  with these. _Himself_ and _themselves_ are the only ones retaining a  distinct objective form.    In the forms _yourself_ and _yourselves_ we have the possessive _your_  marked as singular as well as plural.      [Sidenote: _Use of the reflexives._]    96. There are three uses of reflexive pronouns:--    (1) _As object of a verb or preposition, and referring to the same  person or thing as the subject_; as in these sentences from Emerson:--         He who offers _himself_ a candidate for that covenant comes up       like an Olympian.         I should hate _myself_ if then I made my other friends my asylum.         We fill _ourselves_ with ancient learning.         What do we know of nature or of _ourselves_?    (2) _To emphasize a noun or pronoun_; for example,--         The great globe _itself_ ... shall dissolve.--SHAKESPEARE.               Threats to all;       To _you yourself_, to us, to every one.--_Id._         Who would not sing for Lycidas! he knew       _Himself_ to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.--MILTON.    NOTE.--In such sentences the pronoun is sometimes omitted, and the  reflexive modifies the pronoun understood; for example,--         Only _itself_ can inspire whom it will.--EMERSON.         My hands are full of blossoms plucked before, Held dead within       them till _myself_ shall die.--E.B. BROWNING.         As if it were _thyself_ that's here, I shrink with       pain.--WORDSWORTH.    (3) _As the precise equivalent of a personal pronoun_; as,--         Lord Altamont designed to take his son and _myself_.--DE QUINCEY.         Victories that neither _myself_ nor my cause always deserved.--B.       FRANKLIN.         For what else have our forefathers and _ourselves_ been       taxed?--LANDOR.         Years ago, Arcturus and _myself_ met a gentleman from China who       knew the language.--THACKERAY.        Exercises on Personal Pronouns.      (_a_) Bring up sentences containing ten personal pronouns, some each  of masculine, feminine, and neuter.    (_b_) Bring up sentences containing five personal pronouns in the  possessive, some of them being double possessives.    (_c_) Tell which use each _it_ has in the following sentences:--    1. Come and trip it as we go,       On the light fantastic toe.    2. Infancy conforms to nobody; all conform to it.    3. It is an ill wind that blows nobody good.    4. Courage, father, fight it out.    5. And it grew wondrous cold.    6. To know what is best to do, and how to do it, is wisdom.    7. If any phenomenon remains brute and dark, it is because the  corresponding faculty in the observer is not yet active.    8. But if a man do not speak from within the veil, where the word is  one with that it tells of, let him lowly confess it.    9. It behooved him to keep on good terms with his pupils.    10. Biscuit is about the best thing I know; but it is the soonest  spoiled; and one would like to hear counsel on one point, why it is  that a touch of water utterly ruins it.
