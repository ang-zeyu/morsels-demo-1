The entire mucous membrane lining the digestive canal is  furnished with a rich supply of blood-vessels, by which the greater part  of the digestive food is absorbed.    \"_Liver Digestion._--The liver as well as the stomach is a digestive  organ, and in a double sense. It not only secretes a digestive fluid,  the bile, but it acts upon the food brought to it by the portal vein,  and regulates the supply of digested food to the general system. It  converts a large share of the grape-sugar and partially digested starch  brought to it into a kind of liver starch, termed glycogen, which it  stores up in its tissues. During the interval between the meals, the  liver gradually redigests the glycogen, reconverting it into sugar, and  thus supplying it to the blood in small quantities, instead of allowing  the entire amount formed in digestion to enter the circulation at once.  If too large an amount of sugar entered the system at once, it would be  unable to use it all, and would be compelled to get rid of a  considerable portion through the kidneys. The liver also completes the  digestion of albumen and other food elements.\"    TIME REQUIRED FOR DIGESTION.--The length of time required for  stomach digestion varies with different food substances. The following  table shows the time necessary for the stomach digestion of some of the  more commonly used foods:--                                   min      Rice                       1  00      Sago                       1  45      Tapioca                    2  00      Barley                     2  00      Beans, pod, boiled         2  30      Bread, wheaten             3  30      Bread, corn                3  15      Apples, sour and raw       2  00      Apples, sweet and raw      1  30      Parsnips, boiled           2  30      Beets, boiled              3  45      Potatoes, Irish, boiled    3  30      Potatoes, Irish, baked     2  30      Cabbage, raw               2  30      Cabbage, boiled            4  30      Milk, boiled               2  00      Milk, raw                  2  15      Eggs, hard boiled          3  30      Eggs, soft boiled          3  00      Eggs, fried                3  30      Eggs, raw                  2  00      Eggs, whipped              1  30      Salmon, salted, boiled     4  00      Oysters, raw               2  55      Oysters, stewed            3  30      Beef, lean, rare roasted   3  00      Beefsteak, boiled          3  00      Beef, lean, fried          4  00      Beef, salted, boiled       4  15      Pork, roasted              5  15      Pork, salted, fried        4  15      Mutton, roasted            3  15      Mutton, broiled            3  00      Veal, broiled              4  00      Veal, fried                4  30      Fowls, boiled              4  00      Duck, roasted              4  30      Butter, melted             3  30      Cheese                     3  30      Soup, marrowbone           4  15      Soup, bean                 3  00      Soup, mutton               3  30      Chicken, boiled            3  00    The time required for the digestion of food also depends upon the  condition under which the food is eaten. Healthy stomach digestion  requires at least five hours for its completion, and the stomach should  have an hour for rest before another meal. If fresh food is taken before  that which preceded it is digested, the portion of food remaining in the  stomach is likely to undergo fermentation, thus rendering the whole mass  of food unfit for the nutrition of the body, besides fostering various  disturbances of digestion. It has been shown by recent observations that  the length of time required for food to pass through the entire  digestive process to which it is subjected in the mouth, stomach, and  small intestines, is from twelve to fourteen hours.    HYGIENE OF DIGESTION.--With the stomach and other digestive organs  in a state of perfect health, one is entirely unconscious of their  existence, save when of feeling of hunger calls attention to the fact  that food is required, or satiety warns us that a sufficient amount or  too much has been eaten. Perfect digestion can only be maintained by  careful observance of the rules of health in regard to habits of eating.    On the subject of Hygiene of Digestion, we again quote a few paragraphs  from Dr. Kellogg's work on Physiology, in which is given a concise  summary of the more important points relating to this:--    \"The hygiene of digestion has to do with the quality and quantity of  food eaten, in the manner of eating it.    \"_Hasty Eating._--If the food is eaten too rapidly, it will not be  properly divided, and when swallowed in coarse lumps, the digestive  fluids cannot readily act upon it. On account of the insufficient  mastication, the saliva will be deficient in quantity, and, as a  consequence, the starch will not be well digested, and the stomach will  not secrete a sufficient amount of gastric juice. It is not well to eat  only soft or liquid food, as we are likely to swallow it without proper  chewing. A considerable proportion of hard food, which requires thorough  mastication, should be eaten at every meal.    \"_Drinking Freely at Meals_ is harmful, as it not only encourages hasty  eating, but dilutes the gastric juice, and thus lessens its activity.  The food should be chewed until sufficiently moistened by saliva to  allow it to be swallowed. When large quantities of fluid are taken into  the stomach, digestion does not begin until a considerable portion of  the fluid has been absorbed. If cold foods or drinks are taken with the  meal, such as ice-cream, ice-water, iced milk or tea, the stomach is  chilled, and a long delay in the digestive process is occasioned.    \"The Indians of Brazil carefully abstain from drinking when eating, and  the same custom prevails among many other savage tribes.    \"_Eating between Meals._--The habit of eating apples, nuts, fruits,  confectionery, etc., between meals is exceedingly harmful, and certain  to produce loss of appetite and indigestion. The stomach as well as the  muscles and other organs of the body requires rest. The frequency with  which meals should be taken depends somewhat upon the age and occupation  of an individual. Infants take their food at short intervals, and owing  to its simple character, are able to digest it very quickly. Adults  should not take food oftener than three times a day; and persons whose  employment is sedentary say, in many cases at least, adopt with  advantage the plan of the ancient Greeks, who ate but twice a day. The  latter custom is quite general among the higher classes in France and  Spain, and in several South American countries.    \"_Simplicity in Diet._--Taking too many kinds of food at a meal is a  common fault which is often a cause of disease of the digestive-organs.  Those nations are the most hardy and enduring whose dietary is most  simple. The Scotch peasantry live chiefly upon oatmeal, the Irish upon  potatoes, milk, and oatmeal, the Italian upon peas, beans, macaroni, and  chestnuts; yet all these are noted for remarkable health and endurance.  The natives of the Canary Islands, an exceedingly well-developed and  vigorous race, subsist almost chiefly upon a food which they call  gofio, consisting of parched grain, coarsely ground in a mortar and  mixed with water.    \"_Eating when Tired._--It is not well to eat when exhausted by violent  exercise, as the system is not prepared to do the work of digestion  well. Sleeping immediately after eating is also a harmful practice. The  process of digestion cannot well be performed during sleep, and sleep is  disturbed by the ineffective efforts of the digestive organs. Hence the  well-known evil effects of late suppers.    \"_Eating too Much._--Hasty eating is the greatest cause of over-eating.  When one eats too rapidly, the food is crowded into the stomach so fast  that nature has no time to cry, 'Enough,' by taking away the appetite  before too much has been eaten. When an excess of food is taken, it is  likely to ferment or sour before it can be digested. One who eats too  much usually feels dull after eating.    \"_How Much Food is Enough?_--The proper quantity for each person to take  is what he is able to digest and utilize. This amount of various with  each individual, at different times. The amount needed will vary with  the amount of work done, mental or muscular; with the weather or the  season of the year, more food being required in cold than in warm  weather: with the age of an individual, very old and very young persons  requiring less food than those of middle age. An unperverted appetite,  not artificially stimulated, is a safe guide. Drowsiness, dullness, and  heaviness at the stomach are indications of an excess of eating, and  naturally suggest a lessening of the quantity of food, unless the  symptoms are known to arise from some other cause.    \"_Excess of Certain Food Elements._--When sugar is too freely used,  either with food or in the form of sweetmeats or candies, indigestion,  and even more serious disease, is likely to result. Fats, when freely  used, give rise to indigestion and 'biliousness.' An excess of albumen  from the too free use of meat is harmful. Only a limited amount of this  element can be used; an excess is treated as waste matter, and must be  removed from the system by the liver and the kidneys. The majority of  persons would enjoy better health by using meat more moderately than is  customary in this country.    \"_Deficiency of Certain Food Elements._--A diet deficient in any  important food element is even more detrimental to health than a diet in  which certain elements are in excess.    \"The popular notion that beef-tea and meat extracts contain the  nourishing elements of meat in a concentrated form, is a dangerous  error. Undoubtedly many sick persons have been starved by being fed  exclusively upon these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],[0,"Poems (#10)"],[1,"the noon  With her cherubic quantity,  An April but begun.    The robin is the one  That speechless from her nest  Submits that home and certainty  And sanctity are best.            VII.    THE BUTTERFLY'S DAY.    From cocoon forth a butterfly  As lady from her door  Emerged -- a summer afternoon --  Repairing everywhere,    Without design, that I could trace,  Except to stray abroad  On miscellaneous enterprise  The clovers understood.    Her pretty parasol was seen  Contracting in a field  Where men made hay, then struggling hard  With an opposing cloud,    Where parties, phantom as herself,  To Nowhere seemed to go  In purposeless circumference,  As 't were a tropic show.    And notwithstanding bee that worked,  And flower that zealous blew,  This audience of idleness  Disdained them, from the sky,    Till sundown crept, a steady tide,  And men that made the hay,  And afternoon, and butterfly,  Extinguished in its sea.            VIII.    THE BLUEBIRD.    Before you thought of spring,  Except as a surmise,  You see, God bless his suddenness,  A fellow in the skies  Of independent hues,  A little weather-worn,  Inspiriting habiliments  Of indigo and brown.    With specimens of song,  As if for you to choose,  Discretion in the interval,  With gay delays he goes  To some superior tree  Without a single leaf,  And shouts for joy to nobody  But his seraphic self!            IX.    APRIL.    An altered look about the hills;  A Tyrian light the village fills;  A wider sunrise in the dawn;  A deeper twilight on the lawn;  A print of a vermilion foot;  A purple finger on the slope;  A flippant fly upon the pane;  A spider at his trade again;  An added strut in chanticleer;  A flower expected everywhere;  An axe shrill singing in the woods;  Fern-odors on untravelled roads, --  All this, and more I cannot tell,  A furtive look you know as well,  And Nicodemus' mystery  Receives its annual reply.            X.    THE SLEEPING FLOWERS.    \"Whose are the little beds,\" I asked,  \"Which in the valleys lie?\"  Some shook their heads, and others smiled,  And no one made reply.    \"Perhaps they did not hear,\" I said;  \"I will inquire again.  Whose are the beds, the tiny beds  So thick upon the plain?\"    \"'T is daisy in the shortest;  A little farther on,  Nearest the door to wake the first,  Little leontodon.    \"'T is iris, sir, and aster,  Anemone and bell,  Batschia in the blanket red,  And chubby daffodil.\"    Meanwhile at many cradles  Her busy foot she plied,  Humming the quaintest lullaby  That ever rocked a child.    \"Hush! Epigea wakens! --  The crocus stirs her lids,  Rhodora's cheek is crimson, --  She's dreaming of the woods.\"    Then, turning from them, reverent,  \"Their bed-time 't is,\" she said;  \"The bumble-bees will wake them  When April woods are red.\"            XI.    MY ROSE.    Pigmy seraphs gone astray,  Velvet people from Vevay,  Belles from some lost summer day,  Bees' exclusive coterie.  Paris could not lay the fold  Belted down with emerald;  Venice could not show a cheek  Of a tint so lustrous meek.  Never such an ambuscade  As of brier and leaf displayed  For my little damask maid.  I had rather wear her grace  Than an earl's distinguished face;  I had rather dwell like her  Than be Duke of Exeter  Royalty enough for me  To subdue the bumble-bee!            XII.    THE ORIOLE'S SECRET.    To hear an oriole sing  May be a common thing,  Or only a divine.    It is not of the bird  Who sings the same, unheard,  As unto crowd.    The fashion of the ear  Attireth that it hear  In dun or fair.    So whether it be rune,  Or whether it be none,  Is of within;    The \"tune is in the tree,\"  The sceptic showeth me;  \"No, sir! In thee!\"            XIII.    THE ORIOLE.    One of the ones that Midas touched,  Who failed to touch us all,  Was that confiding prodigal,  The blissful oriole.    So drunk, he disavows it  With badinage divine;  So dazzling, we mistake him  For an alighting mine.    A pleader, a dissembler,  An epicure, a thief, --  Betimes an oratorio,  An ecstasy in chief;    The Jesuit of orchards,  He cheats as he enchants  Of an entire attar  For his decamping wants.    The splendor of a Burmah,  The meteor of birds,  Departing like a pageant  Of ballads and of bards.    I never thought that Jason sought  For any golden fleece;  But then I am a rural man,  With thoughts that make for peace.    But if there were a Jason,  Tradition suffer me  Behold his lost emolument  Upon the apple-tree.            XIV.    IN SHADOW.    I dreaded that first robin so,  But he is mastered now,  And I 'm accustomed to him grown, --  He hurts a little, though.    I thought if I could only live  Till that first shout got by,  Not all pianos in the woods  Had power to mangle me.    I dared not meet the daffodils,  For fear their yellow gown  Would pierce me with a fashion  So foreign to my own.    I wished the grass would hurry,  So when 't was time to see,  He 'd be too tall, the tallest one  Could stretch to look at me.    I could not bear the bees should come,  I wished they 'd stay away  In those dim countries where they go:  What word had they for me?    They 're here, though; not a creature failed,  No blossom stayed away  In gentle deference to me,  The Queen of Calvary.    Each one salutes me as he goes,  And I my childish plumes  Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment  Of their unthinking drums.            XV.    THE HUMMING-BIRD.    A route of evanescence  With a revolving wheel;  A resonance of emerald,  A rush of cochineal;  And every blossom on the bush  Adjusts its tumbled head, --  The mail from Tunis, probably,  An easy morning's ride.            XVI.    SECRETS.    The skies can't keep their secret!  They tell it to the hills --  The hills just tell the orchards --  And they the daffodils!    A bird, by chance, that goes that way  Soft overheard the whole.  If I should bribe the little bird,  Who knows but she would tell?    I think I won't, however,  It's finer not to know;  If summer were an axiom,  What sorcery had snow?    So keep your secret, Father!  I would not, if I could,  Know what the sapphire fellows do,  In your new-fashioned world!            XVII.    Who robbed the woods,  The trusting woods?  The unsuspecting trees  Brought out their burrs and mosses  His fantasy to please.  He scanned their trinkets, curious,  He grasped, he bore away.  What will the solemn hemlock,  What will the fir-tree say?            XVIII.    TWO VOYAGERS.    Two butterflies went out at noon  And waltzed above a stream,  Then stepped straight through the firmament  And rested on a beam;    And then together bore away  Upon a shining sea, --  Though never yet, in any port,  Their coming mentioned be.    If spoken by the distant bird,  If met in ether sea  By frigate or by merchantman,  Report was not to me.            XIX.    BY THE SEA.    I started early, took my dog,  And visited the sea;  The mermaids in the basement  Came out to look at me,    And frigates in the upper floor  Extended hempen hands,  Presuming me to be a mouse  Aground, upon the sands.    But no man moved me till the tide  Went past my simple shoe,  And past my apron and my belt,  And past my bodice too,    And made as he would eat me up  As wholly as a dew  Upon a dandelion's sleeve --  And then I started too.    And he -- he followed close behind;  I felt his silver heel  Upon my ankle, -- then my shoes  Would overflow with pearl.    Until we met the solid town,  No man he seemed to know;  And bowing with a mighty look  At me, the sea withdrew.            XX.    OLD-FASHIONED.    Arcturus is his other name, --  I'd rather call him star!  It's so unkind of science  To go and interfere!    I pull a flower from the woods, --  A monster with a glass  Computes the stamens in a breath,  And has her in a class.    Whereas I took the butterfly  Aforetime in my hat,  He sits erect in cabinets,  The clover-bells forgot.    What once was heaven, is zenith now.  Where I proposed to go  When time's brief masquerade was done,  Is mapped, and charted too!    What if the poles should frisk about  And stand upon their heads!  I hope I 'm ready for the worst,  Whatever prank betides!    Perhaps the kingdom of Heaven 's changed!  I hope the children there  Won't be new-fashioned when I come,  And laugh at me, and stare!    I hope the father in the skies  Will lift his little girl, --  Old-fashioned, naughty, everything, --  Over the stile of pearl!            XXI.    A TEMPEST.    An awful tempest mashed the air,  The clouds were gaunt and few;  A black, as of a spectre's cloak,  Hid heaven and earth from view.    The creatures chuckled on the roofs  And whistled in the air,  And shook their fists and gnashed their teeth.  And swung their frenzied hair.    The morning lit, the birds arose;  The monster's faded eyes  Turned slowly to his native coast,  And peace was Paradise!            XXII.    THE SEA.    An everywhere of silver,  With ropes of sand  To keep it from effacing  The track called land.            XXIII.    IN THE GARDEN.    A bird came down the walk:  He did not know I saw;  He bit an angle-worm in halves  And ate the fellow, raw.    And then he drank a dew  From a convenient grass,  And then hopped sidewise to the wall  To let a beetle pass.    He glanced with rapid eyes  That hurried all abroad, --  They looked like frightened beads, I thought;  He stirred his velvet head    Like one in danger; cautious,  I offered him a crumb,  And he unrolled his feathers  And rowed him softer home    Than oars divide the ocean,  Too silver for a seam,  Or butterflies, off banks of noon,  Leap, splashless, as they swim.            XXIV.    THE SNAKE.    A narrow fellow in the grass  Occasionally rides;  You may have met him, -- did you not,  His notice sudden is.    The grass divides as with a comb,  A spotted shaft is seen;  And then it closes at your feet  And opens further on.    He likes a boggy acre,  A floor too cool for corn.  Yet when a child,"]]]
