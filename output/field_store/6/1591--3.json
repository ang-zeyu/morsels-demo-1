And I had come to know who would meet them when they returned to their  homes, and where they thought the meetings would take place, some in a  valley of the Acrotian hills where the road comes up from Yann, others  in the gateway of one or another of the three cities, and others by  the fireside in the home. And I thought of the danger that had menaced  us all alike outside Perdondaris, a danger that, as things have  happened, was very real.    And I thought too of the helmsman's cheery song in the cold and lonely  night, and how he had held our lives in his careful hands. And as I  thought of this the helmsman ceased to sing, and I looked up and saw a  pale light had appeared in the sky, and the lonely night had passed;  and the dawn widened, and the sailors awoke.    And soon we saw the tide of the Sea himself advancing resolute between  Yann's borders, and Yann sprang lithely at him and they struggled a  while; then Yann and all that was his were pushed back northwards, so  that the sailors had to hoist the sails, and the wind being  favourable, we still held onwards.    And we passed Gondara and Narl and Hoz. And we saw memorable, holy  Golnuz, and heard the pilgrims praying.    When we awoke after the midday rest we were coming near to Nen, the  last of the cities in the River Yann. And the jungle was all about us  once again, and about Nen; but the great Mloon ranges stood up over  all things, and watched the city from beyond the jungle.    Here we anchored, and the captain and I went up into the city and  found that the Wanderers had come into Nen.    And the Wanderers were a weird, dark, tribe, that once in every seven  years came down from the peaks of Mloon, having crossed by a pass that  is known to them from some fantastic land that lies beyond. And the  people of Nen were all outside their houses, and all stood wondering  at their own streets. For the men and women of the Wanderers had  crowded all the ways, and every one was doing some strange thing. Some  danced astounding dances that they had learned from the desert wind,  rapidly curving and swirling till the eye could follow no longer.  Others played upon instruments beautiful wailing tunes that were full  of horror, which souls had taught them lost by night in the desert,  that strange far desert from which the Wanderers came.    None of their instruments were such as were known in Nen nor in any  part of the region of the Yann; even the horns out of which some were  made were of beasts that none had seen along the river, for they were  barbed at the tips. And they sang, in the language of none, songs that  seemed to be akin to the mysteries of night and to the unreasoned fear  that haunts dark places.    Bitterly all the dogs of Nen distrusted them. And the Wanderers told  one another fearful tales, for though no one in Nen knew aught of  their language, yet they could see the fear on the listeners' faces,  and as the tale wound on, the whites of their eyes showed vividly in  terror as the eyes of some little beast whom the hawk has seized. Then  the teller of the tale would smile and stop, and another would tell  his story, and the teller of the first tale's lips would chatter with  fear. And if some deadly snake chanced to appear the Wanderers would  greet him like a brother, and the snake would seem to give his  greetings to them before he passed on again. Once that most fierce and  lethal of tropic snakes, the giant lythra, came out of the jungle and  all down the street, the central street of Nen, and none of the  Wanderers moved away from him, but they all played sonorously on  drums, as though he had been a person of much honour; and the snake  moved through the midst of them and smote none.    Even the Wanderers' children could do strange things, for if any one  of them met with a child of Nen the two would stare at each other in  silence with large grave eyes; then the Wanderers' child would slowly  draw from his turban a live fish or snake. And the children of Nen  could do nothing of that kind at all.    Much I should have wished to stay and hear the hymn with which they  greet the night, that is answered by the wolves on the heights of  Mloon, but it was now time to raise the anchor again that the captain  might return from Bar-Wul-Yann upon the landward tide. So we went on  board and continued down the Yann. And the captain and I spoke little,  for we were thinking of our parting, which should be for long, and we  watched instead the splendour of the westerning sun. For the sun was a  ruddy gold, but a faint mist cloaked the jungle, lying low, and into  it poured the smoke of the little jungle cities, and the smoke of them  met together in the mist and joined into one haze, which became  purple, and was lit by the sun, as the thoughts of men become hallowed  by some great and sacred thing. Sometimes one column from a lonely  house would rise up higher than the cities' smoke, and gleam by itself  in the sun.    And now as the sun's last rays were nearly level, we saw the sight  that I had come to see, for from two mountains that stood on either  shore two cliffs of pink marble came out into the river, all glowing  in the light of the low sun, and they were quite smooth and of  mountainous altitude, and they nearly met, and Yann went tumbling  between them and found the sea.    And this was Bar-Wul-Yann, the Gate of Yann, and in the distance  through that barrier's gap I saw the azure indescribable sea, where  little fishing-boats went gleaming by.    And the sunset and the brief twilight came, and the exultation of the  glory of Bar-Wul-Yann was gone, yet still the pink cliffs glowed, the  fairest marvel that the eye beheld-and this in a land of wonders. And  soon the twilight gave place to the coming out of stars, and the  colours of Bar-Wul-Yann went dwindling away. And the sight of those  cliffs was to me as some chord of music that a master's hand had  launched from the violin, and which carries to Heaven of Faery the  tremulous spirits of men.    And now by the shore they anchored and went no farther, for they were  sailors of the river and not of the sea, and knew the Yann but not the  tides beyond.    And the time was come when the captain and I must part, he to go back  again to his fair Belzoond in sight of the distant peaks of the Hian  Min, and I to find my way by strange means back to those hazy fields  that all poets know, wherein stand small mysterious cottages through  whose windows, looking westwards, you may see the fields of men, and  looking eastwards see glittering elfin mountains, tipped with snow,  going range on range into the region of Myth, and beyond it into the  kingdom of Fantasy, which pertain to the Lands of Dream. Long we  should meet no more, for my fancy is weakening as the years slip by,  and I go ever more seldom into the Lands of Dream. Then we clasped  hands, uncouthly on his part, for it is not the method of greeting in  his country, and he commended my soul to the care of his own gods, to  his little lesser gods, the humble ones, to the gods that bless  Belzoond.          A SHOP IN GO-BY STREET    I said I must go back to Yann again and see if _Bird of the River_  still plies up and down and whether her bearded captain commands her  still or whether he sits in the gate of fair Belzoond drinking at  evening the marvellous yellow wine that the mountaineer brings down  from the Hian Min.  And I wanted to see the sailors again who came  from Durl and Duz and to hear from their lips what befell Perdondaris  when its doom came up without warning from the hills and fell on that  famous city.  And I wanted to hear the sailors pray at night each to  his own god, and to feel the wind of the evening coolly arise when the  sun went flaming away from that exotic river.  For I thought never  again to see the tide of Yann, but when I gave up politics not long  ago the wings of my fancy strengthened, though they had erstwhile  drooped, and I had hopes of coming behind the East once more where  Yann like a proud white war-horse goes through the Lands of Dream.    Yet I had forgotten the way to those little cottages on the edge of  the fields we know whose upper windows, though dim with antique  cobwebs, look out on the fields we know not and are the starting-point  of all adventure in all the Lands of Dream.    I therefore made enquiries.  And so I came to be directed to the shop  of a dreamer who lives not far from the Embankment in the City. Among  so many streets as there are in the city it is little wonder that  there is one that has never been seen before; it is named Go-by Street  and runs out of the Strand if you look very closely.  Now when you  enter this man's shop you do not go straight to the point but you ask  him to sell you something, and if it is anything with which he can  supply you he hands it you and wishes you good-morning.  It is his  way.  And many have been deceived by asking for some unlikely thing,  such as the oyster-shell from which was taken one of those single  pearls that made the gates of Heaven in Revelations, and finding that  the old man had it in stock.    He was comatose when I went into the shop, his heavy lids almost  covered his little eyes; he sat, and his mouth was open.  I said, \"I  want some of Abama and Pharpah, rivers of Damascus.\"  \"How much?\" he  said.  \"Two and a half yards of each, to be delivered to my flat.\"  \"That is very tiresome,\" he muttered, \"very tiresome.  We do not stock  it in that quantity.\"  \"Then I will take all you have,\" I said.    He rose laboriously and looked among some bottles.  I saw one  labelled: Nilos, river of AEgyptos; and others Holy Ganges, Phlegethon,  Jordan; I was almost afraid he had it, when I heard him mutter again,  \"This is very tiresome,\" and presently he said, \"We are out of it.\"  \"Then,\" I said, \"I wish you to tell me the way to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11464"],[0,"Cuba, Old and New (#10)"],[1,"hree. The city within the wall  is today very much as it was a century and more ago. Its streets run,  generally but not accurately, at right angles, one set almost due east and  west, from the harbor front to the line of the old wall, and the other set  runs southward from the shore of the entrance channel to the shore of the  inner harbor. Several of these streets are practically continuous  from north to south or from east to west. But most of them are rather  passage-ways than streets. The houses come to their very edges, except  for a narrow strip hardly to be classed as a sidewalk, originally left,  presumably, only for the purpose of preventing the scraping of the front of  the building by the wheels of passing carts and carriages. It is a somewhat  inconvenient system nowadays, but one gets quite used to it after a little,  threads the narrow walk a part of his way, takes to the street the rest  of the way, and steps aside to avoid passing vehicles quite as did the  carriageless in the old days. One excellent way to avoid the trouble is to  take a carriage and let the other fellow step aside. Riding in the _coche_  is still one of the cheapest forms of convenience and entertainment in the  city, excepting the afternoon drive around the Prado and the Malecon. That  is not cheap. We used to pay a dollar an hour. My last experience cost me  three times that.    [Illustration: CUSTOM HOUSE, HAVANA _Formerly Franciscan Convent Begun_  1574, _finished_ 1591]    Much of the old city is now devoted to business purposes, wholesale,  retail, and professional. But there are also residences, old churches, and  old public buildings. On the immediate water-front, and for many years used  as the custom house, stands the old Franciscan convent, erected during the  last quarter of the 16th Century. It is a somewhat imposing pile, dominated  by a high tower. I have not visited it for a number of years and do not  know if its interior is available for visitors without some special  introduction, but there is much worth seeing inside its walls, the flying  buttresses of the super-structure, some old and interesting frescoes, and  a system of dome construction that is quite remarkable. To the latter, my  attention was first called by General Ludlow, a distinguished engineer  officer of the United States Army, then acting as governor of the city. To  him belongs, although it is very rarely given, the credit for the cleansing  of Havana during the First Intervention. He frequently visited the old  convent just to see and study that interior dome construction. Immediately  behind the Palace is the old convent of the Dominicans, less imposing but  of about the same period as the Franciscan structure. It is now used as  a high-school building. The Cathedral, a block to the northward of the  Dominican convent building, is of a much later date, having been begun as  recently as 1742. It was originally the convent of the Jesuits, but became  the Cathedral in 1789. Many have believed, on what seems to be acceptable  evidence, that here for more than a hundred years rested the bones of  Christopher Columbus. He died in Valladolid in 1506, and was buried there.  His remains were removed to the Carthusian Monastery, in Seville, in 1513.  From there they are said to have been taken, in 1536, to the city of Santo  Domingo, where they remained until 1796, when they were brought to Havana  and placed in a niche in the walls of the old Cathedral, there to remain  until they were taken back to Spain in 1898. There is still an active  dispute as to whether the bones removed from Santo Domingo to Havana were  or were not those of Columbus. At all events, the urn supposed to contain  them was in this building for a hundred years, below a marble slab showing  a carving of the voyager holding a globe, with a finger pointing to the  Caribbean. Beneath this was a legend that has been thus translated:      OH! REST THOU, IMAGE OF THE GREAT COLON,    THOUSAND CENTURIES REMAIN, GUARDED IN THE URN,    AND IN THE REMEMBRANCE OF OUR NATION.    In this neighborhood, to the east of the Plaza de Armas, on which the  Palace fronts, is a structure known as _El Templete_. It has the appearance  of the portico of an unfinished building, but it is a finished memorial,  erected in 1828. The tradition is that on this spot there stood, in 1519,  an old ceiba tree under which the newly arrived settlers celebrated their  first mass. The yellow Palace, for many years the official headquarters and  the residence of successive Governors-General, stands opposite, and speaks  for itself. In this building, somewhat devoid of architectural merit, much  of Cuba's history, for the last three-quarters of a century, has been  written. The best time to see all this and much more that is to be seen,  is the early morning, before the wheels begin to go around. The lights and  shadows are then the best, and the streets are quieter and less crowded.  The different points of interest are easily located by the various guide  books obtainable, and the distances are not great. A cup of _cafe con  leche_ should precede the excursion. If one feels lazy, as one is quite  apt to feel in the tropics and the sub-tropics, fairly comfortable open  carriages are at all times available. With them, of course, a greater  area can be covered and more places seen, though perhaps seen less  satisfactorily. There is much to be seen in the early morning that is best  seen in those hours, and much that is not seen later in the day. In all  cities there is an early morning life and Havana is no exception. I confess  to only a limited personal knowledge of it, but I have seen enough of it,  and heard enough about it, to know that the waking-up of cities, including  Havana, is an interesting process. I have, at least, had enough personal  experience to be sure that the early morning air is delicious, the best of  the day. I am not speaking of the unholy hours preceding daybreak, but  of six to eight o'clock, which for those of us who are inclined to long  evenings is also the best time to be in bed. The early morning church bells  are a disturbance to which visitors do not readily adjust their morning  naps. Mr. Samuel Hazard, who visited Cuba about the year 1870, and wrote  quite entertainingly about it, left the following description of his  experience in Havana:    \"Hardly has the day begun to break when the newly arrived traveller is  startled from his delightful morning doze by the alarming sound of bells  ringing from every part of the town. Without any particular concert of  action, and with very different sounds, they ring out on the still morning  air, as though for a general conflagration, and the unfortunate traveller  rushes frantically from his bed to inquire if there is any hope of safety  from the flames which he imagines, from the noise made, must threaten the  whole town. Imagine, O reader! in thy native town, every square with its  church, every church with its tower, or maybe two or three of them, and  in each particular tower a half-dozen large bells, no two of which sound  alike; place the bell-ropes in the hands of some frantic man who pulls  away, first with one hand and then the other, and you will get a very faint  idea of your first awakening in Havana. Without apparent rhyme or reason,  ding, dong, ding they go, every bell-ringer at each different church  striving to see how much noise he can make, under the plea of bringing the  faithful to their prayers at the early morning mass.\"    [Illustration: BALCONIES IN OLD HAVANA STREET IN HAVANA]    The only conceivable advantage of these early bells is the fact that they  turn out many a traveller at the hour when Havana is really at its best.  Yet, as I read the descriptive tales left by those who wrote forty, fifty,  and sixty years ago, I am struck by the fact, that, after all, the old  Havana has changed but little. There are trolley lines, electric lights,  and a few other so-called modern improvements, but there is still much of  the old custom, the old atmosphere. The old wall, with its soldier-guarded  gates, is gone, and there are a few modern buildings, but only a few, for  which fact I always feel thankful, but the old city is much what it was  when Mr. Ballou, and Mr. Dana, and Mr. Kimball, and numerous others wrote  about it soon after 1850, and when Mr. Hazard wrote about it in 1870. The  automobile is there now in large numbers, in place of the old volante, and  there are asphalted streets in place of cobble-stones. The band plays in  the evening in the Parque Central or at the Glorieta, instead of in the  Plaza de Armas, but the band plays. The restaurants are still a prominent  feature in Havana life, as they were then. The ladies wear hats instead  of _mantillas_, but they buy hats on Calle Obispo just as and where their  mothers and grandmothers bought _mantillas_. Bull-fighting is gone,  presumably forever, but crowds flock to the baseball grounds. The midday  suspension of business continues, generally, and the afternoon parade, on  foot and in carriages, remains one of the important functions of the day.  There are many who know Havana, and love it, who pray diligently that it  may be many years before the city is Americanized as, for instance, New  Orleans has been.    Most of the life of the city, as it is seen by most visitors, is outside  the old city, and probably few know that any distinction is made, yet the  line is drawn with fair clearness. There is a different appearance in both  streets and buildings. While there are shops on San Rafael and Galiano and  elsewhere, the principal shopping district is in the old city, with Calle  Obispo as its centre. They have tried officially, to change the name of the  street, but the old familiar name sticks and seems likely to stick for a  long time yet. Far be it from a mere man to attempt analysis or description  of such a place. He might tell another mere man"]]]
