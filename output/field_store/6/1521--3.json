IN PARTICULAR    This Work is Dedicated    By a Humble Native of Flatland    In the Hope that    Even as he was Initiated into the Mysteries    Of THREE DIMENSIONS    Having been previously conversant    With ONLY TWO    So the Citizens of that Celestial Region    May aspire yet higher and higher    To the Secrets of FOUR FIVE or EVEN SIX Dimensions    Thereby contributing    To the Enlargment of THE IMAGINATION    And the possible Development    Of that most and excellent Gift of MODESTY    Among the Superior Races    Of SOLID HUMANITY    ***        FLATLAND        PART 1    THIS WORLD        SECTION 1  Of the Nature of Flatland      I call our world Flatland, not because we call it so, but to make its  nature clearer to you, my happy readers, who are privileged to live in  Space.    Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, Triangles,  Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining  fixed in their places, move freely about, on or in the surface, but  without the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much like  shadows--only hard with luminous edges--and you will then have a pretty  correct notion of my country and countrymen.  Alas, a few years ago, I  should have said \"my universe:\"  but now my mind has been opened to  higher views of things.    In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is impossible that  there should be anything of what you call a \"solid\" kind; but I dare  say you will suppose that we could at least distinguish by sight the  Triangles, Squares, and other figures, moving about as I have described  them.  On the contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at least  so as to distinguish one figure from another.  Nothing was visible, nor  could be visible, to us, except Straight Lines; and the necessity of  this I will speedily demonstrate.    Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in Space; and leaning  over it, look down upon it.  It will appear a circle.    But now, drawing back to the edge of the table, gradually lower your  eye (thus bringing yourself more and more into the condition of the  inhabitants of Flatland), and you will find the penny becoming more and  more oval to your view, and at last when you have placed your eye  exactly on the edge of the table (so that you are, as it were, actually  a Flatlander) the penny will then have ceased to appear oval at all,  and will have become, so far as you can see, a straight line.    The same thing would happen if you were to treat in the same way a  Triangle, or a Square, or any other figure cut out from pasteboard.  As  soon as you look at it with your eye on the edge of the table, you will  find that it ceases to appear to you as a figure, and that it becomes  in appearance a straight line.  Take for example an equilateral  Triangle--who represents with us a Tradesman of the respectable class.  Figure 1 represents the Tradesman as you would see him while you were  bending over him from above; figures 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman,  as you would see him if your eye were close to the level, or all but on  the level of the table; and if your eye were quite on the level of the  table (and that is how we see him in Flatland) you would see nothing  but a straight line.    When I was in Spaceland I heard that your sailors have very similar  experiences while they traverse your seas and discern some distant  island or coast lying on the horizon.  The far-off land may have bays,  forelands, angles in and out to any number and extent; yet at a  distance you see none of these (unless indeed your sun shines bright  upon them revealing the projections and retirements by means of light  and shade), nothing but a grey unbroken line upon the water.    Well, that is just what we see when one of our triangular or other  acquaintances comes towards us in Flatland.  As there is neither sun  with us, nor any light of such a kind as to make shadows, we have none  of the helps to the sight that you have in Spaceland.  If our friend  comes closer to us we see his line becomes larger; if he leaves us it  becomes smaller; but still he looks like a straight line; be he a  Triangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle, what you will--a straight  Line he looks and nothing else.    You may perhaps ask how under these disadvantagous circumstances we are  able to distinguish our friends from one another: but the answer to  this very natural question will be more fitly and easily given when I  come to describe the inhabitants of Flatland.  For the present let me  defer this subject, and say a word or two about the climate and houses  in our country.          SECTION 2  Of the Climate and Houses in Flatland      As with you, so also with us, there are four points of the compass  North, South, East, and West.    There being no sun nor other heavenly bodies, it is impossible for us  to determine the North in the usual way; but we have a method of our  own.  By a Law of Nature with us, there is a constant attraction to the  South; and, although in temperate climates this is very slight--so that  even a Woman in reasonable health can journey several furlongs  northward without much difficulty--yet the hampering effort of the  southward attraction is quite sufficient to serve as a compass in most  parts of our earth.  Moreover, the rain (which falls at stated  intervals) coming always from the North, is an additional assistance;  and in the towns we have the guidance of the houses, which of course  have their side-walls running for the most part North and South, so  that the roofs may keep off the rain from the North.  In the country,  where there are no houses, the trunks of the trees serve as some sort  of guide.  Altogether, we have not so much difficulty as might be  expected in determining our bearings.    Yet in our more temperate regions, in which the southward attraction is  hardly felt, walking sometimes in a perfectly desolate plain where  there have been no houses nor trees to guide me, I have been  occasionally compelled to remain stationary for hours together, waiting  till the rain came before continuing my journey.  On the weak and aged,  and especially on delicate Females, the force of attraction tells much  more heavily than on the robust of the Male Sex, so that it is a point  of breeding, if you meet a Lady on the street, always to give her the  North side of the way--by no means an easy thing to do always at short  notice when you are in rude health and in a climate where it is  difficult to tell your North from your South.    Windows there are none in our houses:  for the light comes to us alike  in our homes and out of them, by day and by night, equally at all times  and in all places, whence we know not.  It was in old days, with our  learned men, an interesting and oft-investigate question, \"What is the  origin of light?\" and the solution of it has been repeatedly attempted,  with no other result than to crowd our lunatic asylums with the  would-be solvers.  Hence, after fruitless attempts to suppress such  investigations indirectly by making them liable to a heavy tax, the  Legislature, in comparatively recent times, absolutely prohibited them.  I--alas, I alone in Flatland--know now only too well the true solution  of this mysterious problem; but my knowledge cannot be made  intelligible to a single one of my countrymen; and I am mocked at--I,  the sole possessor of the truths of Space and of the theory of the  introduction of Light from the world of three Dimensions--as if I were  the maddest of the mad!  But a truce to these painful digressions:  let  me return to our homes.    The most common form for the construction of a house is five-sided or  pentagonal, as in the annexed figure.  The two Northern sides RO, OF,  constitute the roof, and for the most part have no doors; on the East  is a small door for the Women; on the West a much larger one for the  Men; the South side or floor is usually doorless.    Square and triangular houses are not allowed, and for this reason.  The  angles of a Square (and still more those of an equilateral Triangle,)  being much more pointed than those of a Pentagon, and the lines of  inanimate objects (such as houses) being dimmer than the lines of Men  and Women, it follows that there is no little danger lest the points of  a square or triangular house residence might do serious injury to an  inconsiderate or perhaps absentminded traveller suddenly running  against them: and therefore, as early as the eleventh century of our  era, triangular houses were universally forbidden by Law, the only  exceptions being fortifications, powder-magazines, barracks, and other  state buildings, which is not desirable that the general public should  approach without circumspection.    At this period, square houses were still everywhere permitted, though  discouraged by a special tax.  But, about three centuries afterwards,  the Law decided that in all towns containing a population above ten  thousand, the angle of a Pentagon was the smallest house-angle that  could be allowed consistently with the public safety.  The good sense  of the community has seconded the efforts of the Legislature; and now,  even in the country, the pentagonal construction has superseded every  other.  It is only now and then in some very remote and backward  agricultural district that an antiquarian may still discover a square  house.          SECTION 3  Concerning the Inhabitants of Flatland      The greatest length or breadth of a full grown inhabitant of Flatland  may be estimated at about eleven of your inches.  Twelve inches may be  regarded as a maximum.    Our Women are Straight Lines.    Our Soldiers and Lowest Class of Workmen are Triangles with two equal  sides, each about eleven inches long, and a base or third side so short  (often not exceeding half an inch) that they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9791"],[0,"Harrigan (#1)"],[1,"Proofreaders                  HARRIGAN    MAX BRAND    1918    Also by Max Brand: BLACK JACK; TROUBLE KID; CLUNG; THUNDER MOON;  THE STINGAREE; RIPPON RIDES DOUBLE; ON THE TRAIL OF FOUR;  STEVE TRAIN'S ORDEAL; LARRAMEE'S RANCH; RIDE THE WILD TRAIL;  THE GUNS OF DORKING HOLLOW; TORTURE TRAIL; THE GENTLE GUNMAN;  THE GARDEN OF EDEN; GOLDEN LIGHTNING; THE STRANGER; MIGHTY LOBO                  CHAPTER 1      \"That fellow with the red hair,\" said the police captain as he pointed.    \"I'll watch him,\" the sergeant answered.    The captain had raided two opium dens the day before, and the pride of  accomplishment puffed his chest. He would have given advice to the  sheriff of Oahu that evening.    He went on: \"I can pick some men out of the crowd by the way they walk,  and others by their eyes. That fellow has it written all over him.\"    The red-headed man came nearer through the crowd. Because of the  warmth, he had stuffed his soft hat into a back pocket, and now the  light from a window shone steadily on his hair and made a fire of it, a  danger signal. He encountered the searching glances of the two officers  and answered with cold, measuring eyes, like the gaze of a prize  fighter who waits for a blow. The sergeant turned to his superior with  a grunt.    \"You're right,\" he nodded.    \"Trail him,\" said the captain, \"and take a man with you. If that fellow  gets into trouble, you may need help.\"    He stepped into his automobile and the sergeant beckoned to a nearby  policeman.    \"Akana,\" he said, \"we have a man-sized job tonight. Are you feeling  fit?\"    The Kanaka smiled without enthusiasm.    \"The man of the red hair?\"    The sergeant nodded, and Akana tightened his belt. He had eaten fish  baked in ti leaves that evening.    He suggested: \"Morley has little to do. His beat is quiet. Shall I tell  him to come with us?\"    \"No,\" grinned the sergeant, and then looked up and watched the broad  shoulders of the red-haired man, who advanced through the crowd as the  prow of a ship lunges through the waves. \"Go get Morley,\" he said  abruptly.    But Harrigan went on his way without misgivings, not that he forgot the  policeman, but he was accustomed to stand under the suspicious eye of  the law. In all the course of his wanderings it had been upon him. His  coming was to the men in uniform like the sound of the battle trumpet  to the cavalry horse. This, however, was Harrigan's first night in  Honolulu, and there was much to see, much to do. He had rambled through  the streets; now he was headed for the Ivilei district. Instinct  brought him there, the still, small voice which had guided him from  trouble to trouble all his life.    At a corner he stopped to watch a group of Kanakas who passed him,  wreathed with leis and thrumming their ukuleles. They sang in their  soft, many-voweled language and the sound was to Harrigan like the rush  and lapse of water on a beach, infinitely soothing and as lazy as the  atmosphere of Honolulu. All things are subdued in the strange city  where East and West meet in the middle of the Pacific. The gayest  crowds cannot quite disturb the brooding peace which is like the  promise of sleep and rest at sunset. It was not pleasing to Harrigan.  He frowned and drew a quick, impatient breath, muttering: \"I'm not long  for this joint. I gotta be moving.\"    He joined a crowd which eddied toward the center of Ivilei. In there it  was better. Negro soldiers, marines from the _Maryland_, Kanakas,  Chinamen, Japanese, Portuguese, Americans; a score of nationalities and  complexions rubbed shoulders as they wandered aimlessly among the many  bright-painted cottages.    Yet even in that careless throng of pleasure-seekers no one rubbed  shoulders with Harrigan. The flame of his hair was like a red lamp  which warned them away. Or perhaps it was his eye, which seemed to  linger for a cold, incurious instant on every face that approached. He  picked out the prettiest of the girls who sat at the windows chatting  with all who passed. He did not have to shoulder to win a way through  the crowd of her admirers.    She was a _hap haoli_, with the fine features of the Caucasian and the  black of hair and eye which shows the islander. A rounded elbow rested  on the sill of the window; her chin was cupped in her hand.    \"Send these away,\" said Harrigan, and leaned an elbow beside hers.    \"Oh,\" she murmured; then: \"And if I send them away?\"    \"I'll reward you.\"    \"Reward?\"    For answer he dragged a crimson carnation from the buttonhole of a tall  man who stood at his side.    \"What in hell--\" began the victim, but Harrigan smiled and the other  drew slowly back through the crowd.    \"Now send them away.\"    She looked at him an instant longer with a light coming slowly up  behind her eyes. Then she leaned out and waved to the chuckling  semicircle.    \"Run away for a while,\" she said; \"I want to talk to my brother.\"    She patted the thick red hair to emphasize the relationship, and the  little crowd departed, laughing uproariously. Harrigan slipped the  carnation into the jetty hair. His hand lingered a moment against the  soft masses, and she drew it down, grown suddenly serious.    \"There are three policemen in the shadow of that cottage over there.  They're watching you.\"    \"Ah-h!\"    The sound was so soft that it was almost a sigh, but she shivered  perceptibly.    \"What have you been doing?\"    He answered regretfully: \"Nothing.\"    \"They're coming this way. The man who had the carnation is with them.  You better beat it.\"    \"Nope. I like it here.\"    She shook her head, but the flame was blowing high now  in her eyes. A hand fell on Harrigan's shoulder.    \"Hey!\" said the sergeant in a loud voice.    Harrigan turned slowly and the sergeant's hand fell away. The man of  the carnation was far in the background.    \"Well?\"    \"That flower. You can't get away with little tricks like that. You  better be starting on. Move along.\"    Harrigan glanced slowly from face to face. The three policemen drew  closer together as if for mutual protection.    \"Please--honey!\" urged the whisper of the girl.    The hand of Harrigan resting on the window sill had gathered to a  hard-bunched fist, white at the knuckles, but he nodded across the open  space between the cottages.    \"If you're looking for work,\" he said, \"seems as though you'd find a  handful over there.\"    A clatter of sharp, quick voices rose from a group of Negro soldiers  gathering around a white man. No one could tell the cause of the  quarrel. It might have been anything from an oath to a blow.    \"Watch him,\" said Harrigan. \"He looks like a man.\" He added  plaintively: \"But looks are deceivin'.\"    The center of the disturbance appeared to be a man indeed. He was even  taller than Harrigan and broader of shoulder, and, like the latter,  there was a suggestion of strength in him which could not be defined by  his size alone. At the distance they could guess his smile as he faced  the clamoring mob.    \"Break in there!\" ordered the sergeant to his companions, and started  toward the angry circle.    As he spoke, they heard one of the Negroes curse and the fist of the  tall man darted at the face of a soldier and drove him toppling back  among his comrades. They closed on the white man with a yell; a passing  group of their compatriots joined the affray; the whole mass surged in  around the tall fellow. Harrigan's head went back and his eyes half  closed like a critic listening to an exquisite symphony.    \"Ah-h!\" he whispered to himself. \"Watch him fight!\"    The policemen struck the outer edge of the circle with drawn clubs, but  there they stopped. They could not dent that compacted mass. The  soldiers struggled manfully, but they were held at bay. Harrigan could  see the heaving shoulders of the defender over the heads of the  assailants, and the crack of hard-driven fists. The attackers were  crushed together and had little room to swing their arms with full  force, while the big man stood with his back against the wall of the  cottage and made every smashing punch count.    As if by common assent, the soldiers suddenly desisted and gave back  from this deadly fighter. His bellow of triumph rang over the clamor.  His hat was off; his long black hair stood straight up in the wind; and  he leaped after them with flailing arms.    But now the police had managed to pry their way into the mass by dint  of indiscriminate battering. As the black-haired man came face to face  with the sergeant, the light gleamed on a high-swung club that thudded  home; and the big man dropped out of sight. He came up again almost at  once, but with men draped from every portion of his body. The soldiers  and police had joined forces, and once more a dozen men clutched him,  spilling over him like football players in a scrimmage. He was knocked  from his feet by the impact.    \"Coming!\" shouted Harrigan.    He raced with long strides, head lowered and back bowed until his long  arms nearly swept the ground. Gathering impetus at every stride, he  crushed into the floundering heap of arms and legs. The police sergeant  rose and whirled with lifted club. Harrigan grunted with joy as he dug  his left into the man's midsection. The sergeant collapsed upon the  ground, embracing his stomach with both arms. Harrigan jerked away the  upper layers of the attackers and dragged the black-haired man to his  feet.    \"Shoulder to shoulder!\" thundered Harrigan, and smote Officer Akana  upon the point of the chin.    The victory was not yet won. The black soldiers of Uncle Sam's regular  army need not take second place to any body of troops in the world.  These men had tasted their own blood and they came tearing in now for  revenge.    Harrigan, standing full in front of the rescued man until the latter  should have recovered his breath, found food for both fists, and his  love of battle was fed. The other man had fought stiffly erect,  standing with feet"]]]
