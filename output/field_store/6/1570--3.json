Take the disgust out of one's senses, O flower of true Christian wisdom  and charity, now beginning to fill the air with fragrance!    But it will be said that Dante did all this out of his hate of cruelty  itself, and of treachery itself. Partly no doubt he did; and entirely he  thought he did. But see how the notions of such retribution react upon  the judge, and produce in him the bad passions he punishes. It is true  the punishments are imaginary. Were a human being actually to see such  things, he must be dehumanised or he would cry out against them with  horror and detestation. But the poem draws them as truths; the writer's  creed threatened them; he himself contributed to maintain the belief;  and however we may suppose such a belief to have had its use in giving  alarm to ruffian passions and barbarously ignorant times, an age arrives  when a beneficent Providence permits itself to be better understood, and  dissipates the superfluous horror.    Many, indeed, of the absurdities of Dante's poem are too obvious  now-a-days to need remark. Even the composition of the poem,  egotistically said to be faultless by such critics as Alfieri, who  thought they resembled him, partakes, as every body's style does, of the  faults as well as good qualities of the man. It is nervous, concise,  full almost as it can hold, picturesque, mighty, primeval; but it is  often obscure, often harsh, and forced in its constructions, defective  in melody, and wilful and superfluous in the rhyme. Sometimes, also,  the writer is inconsistent in circumstance (probably from not having  corrected the poem); and he is not above being filthy. Even in the  episode of Paulo and Francesca, which has so often been pronounced  faultless, and which is unquestionably one of the most beautiful  pieces of writing in the world, some of these faults are observable,  particularly in the obscurity of the passage about _tolta forma_, the  cessation of the incessant tempest, and the non-adjuration of the two  lovers in the manner that Virgil prescribes.    But truly it is said, that when Dante is great, nobody surpasses him. I  doubt if anybody equals him, as to the constant intensity and incessant  variety of his pictures; and whatever he paints, he throws, as it were,  upon its own powers; as though an artist should draw figures that  started into life, and proceeded to action for themselves, frightening  their creator. Every motion, word, and look of these creatures becomes  full of sensibility and suggestions. The invisible is at the back of the  visible; darkness becomes palpable; silence describes a character, nay,  forms the most striking part of a story; a word acts as a flash of  lightning, which displays some gloomy neighbourhood, where a tower is  standing, with dreadful faces at the window; or where, at your feet,  full of eternal voices, one abyss is beheld dropping out of another in  the lurid light of torment. In the present volume a story will be found  which tells a long tragedy in half-a-dozen lines. Dante has the  minute probabilities of a Defoe in the midst of the loftiest and most  generalising poetry; and this feeling of matter-of-fact is impressed by  fictions the most improbable, nay, the most ridiculous and revolting.  You laugh at the absurdity; you are shocked at the detestable cruelty;  yet, for the moment, the thing almost seems as if it must be true. You  feel as you do in a dream, and after it;--you wake and laugh, but the  absurdity seemed true at the time; and while you laugh you shudder.    Enough of this crueller part of his genius has been exhibited; but it is  seldom you can have the genius without sadness. In the circle of hell,  soothsayers walk along weeping, with their faces turned the wrong way,  so that their tears fall between their shoulders. The picture is still  more dreadful. Warton thinks it ridiculous. But I cannot help feeling  with the poet, that it is dreadfully pathetic. It is the last mortifying  insult to human pretension. Warton, who has a grudge against Dante  natural to a man of happier piety, thinks him ridiculous also in  describing the monster Geryon lying upon the edge of one of the gulfs  of hell \"like a beaver\" (canto xvii.). He is of opinion that the writer  only does it to shew his knowledge of natural history. But surely the  idea of so strange and awful a creature (a huge mild-faced man ending in  a dragon's body) lying familiarly on the edge of the gulf, as a beaver  does by the water, combines the supernatural with the familiar in a very  impressive manner. It is this combination of extremes which is the life  and soul of the whole poem; you have this world in the next; the same  persons, passions, remembrances, intensified by superhuman despairs  or beatitudes; the speechless entrancements of bliss, the purgatorial  trials of hope and patience; the supports of hate and anger (such as  they are) in hell itself; nay, of loving despairs, and a self-pity made  unboundedly pathetic by endless suffering. Hence there it no love-story  so affecting as that of Paulo and Francesca thus told and perpetuated in  another world; no father's misery so enforced upon us as Ugolino's, who,  for hundreds of years, has not grown tired of the revenge to which it  wrought him. Dante even puts this weight and continuity of feeling into  passages of mere transient emotion or illustration, unconnected with the  next world; as in the famous instance of the verses about evening, and  many others which the reader will meet with in this volume. Indeed, if  pathos and the most impressive simplicity, and graceful beauty of all  kinds, and abundant grandeur, can pay (as the reader, I believe, will  think it does even in a prose abstract), for the pangs of moral discord  and absurdity inflicted by the perusal of Dante's poem, it may challenge  competition with any in point of interest. His Heaven, it is true,  though containing both sublime and lovely passages, is not so good as  his Earth. The more unearthly he tried to make it, the less heavenly  it became. When he is content with earth in heaven itself,-when he  literalises a metaphor, and with exquisite felicity finds himself  _arrived there_ in consequence of fixing his eyes on the eyes of  Beatrice, then he is most celestial. But his endeavours to express  degrees of beatitude and holiness by varieties of flame and light,--of  dancing lights, revolving lights, lights of smiles, of stars, of starry  crosses, of didactic letters and sentences, of animal figures made up of  stars full of blessed souls, with saints _forming an eagle's beak_ and  David in its _eye!_--such superhuman attempts become for the most part  tricks of theatrical machinery, on which we gaze with little curiosity  and no respect.    His angels, however, are another matter. Belief was prepared for those  winged human forms, and they furnished him with some of his most  beautiful combinations of the natural with the supernatural. Ginguene  has remarked the singular variety as well as beauty of Dante's angels.  Milton's, indeed, are commonplace in the comparison. In the eighth canto  of the _Inferno_, the devils insolently refuse the poet and his guide an  entrance into the city of Dis:--an angel comes sweeping over the Stygian  lake to enforce it; the noise of his wings makes the shores tremble, and  is like a crashing whirlwind such as beats down the trees and sends the  peasants and their herds flying before it. The heavenly messenger, after  rebuking the devils, touches the portals of the city with his wand; they  fly open; and he returns the way he came without uttering a word to the  two companions. His face was that of one occupied with other thoughts.  This angel is announced by a tempest. Another, who brings the souls of  the departed to Purgatory, is first discovered at a distance, gradually  disclosing white splendours, which are his wings and garments. He comes  in a boat, of which his wings are the sails; and as he approaches, it is  impossible to look him in the face for its brightness. Two other angels  have green wings and green garments, and the drapery is kept in motion  like a flag by the vehement action of the wings. A fifth has a face like  the morning star, casting forth quivering beams. A sixth is of a lustre  so oppressive, that the poet feels a weight on his eyes before he knows  what is coming. Another's presence affects the senses like the fragrance  of a May-morning; and another is in garments dark as cinders, but has  a sword in his hand too sparkling to be gazed at. Dante's occasional  pictures of the beauties of external nature are worthy of these angelic  creations, and to the last degree fresh and lovely. You long to bathe  your eyes, smarting with the fumes of hell, in his dews. You gaze  enchanted on his green fields and his celestial blue skies, the more so  from the pain and sorrow in midst of which the visions are created.    Dante's grandeur of every kind is proportionate to that of his angels,  almost to his ferocity; and that is saying every thing. It is not  always the spiritual grandeur of Milton, the subjection of the material  impression to the moral; but it is equally such when he chooses, and  far more abundant. His infernal precipices--his black whirlwinds--his  innumerable cries and claspings of hands--his very odours of huge  loathsomeness--his giants at twilight standing up to the middle in pits,  like towers, and causing earthquakes when they move--his earthquake of  the mountain in Purgatory, when a spirit is set free for heaven--his  dignified Mantuan Sordello, silently regarding him and his guide as they  go by, \"like a lion on his watch\"--his blasphemer, Capaneus, lying in  unconquered rage and sullenness under an eternal rain of flakes of fire  (human precursor of Milton's Satan)--his aspect of Paradise, \"as if the  universe had smiled\"--his inhabitants of the whole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10886"],[0,"The Untamed (#10)"],[1,"stallion.  Why had the others gone so soon? Breathless, she reached the door of  the saloon. It was very dim within. She could make out only formless  shades at first. Black Bart slid noiselessly across the floor. She  followed him with her eyes, and now she saw a figure stretched  straight out on the floor while another man kneeled at his side. She  ran forward with a cry.    Morgan rose, stammering. She pushed him aside and dropped beside Dan.  A broad white bandage circled his head. His face was almost as pale as  the cloth. Her touches went everywhere over that cold face, and she  moaned little syllables that had no meaning. He lived, but it seemed  to her that she had found him at the legended gates of death.    \"Miss Kate!\" said Morgan desperately.    \"You murderer!\"    \"You don't think that _I_ did that?\"    \"It happened in your place--you had given Dad your word!\"    Still she did not turn her head.    \"Won't you hear me explain? He's jest in a sort of a trance. He'll  wake up feelin' all right. Don't try to move him tonight. I'll go out  an' put his hoss up in the shed. In the mornin' he'll be as good as  new. Miss Kate, won't you listen to me?\"    She turned reluctantly towards him. Perhaps he was right and Dan would  waken from his swoon as if from a healthful sleep.    \"It was that big feller with them straight eyes that done it,\" began  Morgan.    \"The one who was sneering at Dan?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Weren't there enough boys here to string him up?\"    \"He had three friends with him. It would of taken a hundred men to lay  hands on one of those four. They were all bad ones. I'm goin' to tell  you how it was, because I'm leavin' in a few minutes and ridin' south,  an' I want to clear my trail before I start. This was the way it  happened--\"    His back was turned to the dim light which fell through the door. She  could barely make out the movement of his lips. All the rest of his  face was lost in shadow. As he spoke she sometimes lost his meaning  and the stir of his lips became a nameless gibbering. The grey gloom  settled more deeply round the room and over her heart while he talked.  He explained how the difference had risen between the tall stranger  and Whistling Dan. How Dan had been insulted time and again and borne  it with a sort of childish stupidity. How finally the blow had been  struck. How Dan had crouched on the floor, laughing, and how a yellow  light gathered in his eyes.    At that, her mind went blank. When her thoughts returned she stood  alone in the room. The clatter of Morgan's galloping horse died  swiftly away down the road. She turned to Dan. Black Bart was crouched  at watch beside him. She kneeled again--lowered her head--heard the  faint but steady breathing. He seemed infinitely young--infinitely  weak and helpless. The whiteness of the bandage stared up at her like  an eye through the deepening gloom. All the mother in her nature came  to her eyes in tears.          CHAPTER VIII      RED WRITING    He stirred.    \"Dan--dear!\"    \"My head,\" he muttered, \"it sort of aches, Kate, as if--\"    He was silent and she knew that he remembered.    \"You're all right now, honey. I've come here to take care of you--I  won't leave you. Poor Dan!\"    \"How did you know?\" he asked, the words trailing.    \"Black Bart came for me.\"    \"Good ol' Bart!\"    The great wolf slunk closer, and licked the outstretched hand.    \"Why, Kate, I'm on the floor and it's dark. Am I still in Morgan's  place? Yes, I begin to see clearer.\"    He made an effort to rise, but she pressed him back.    \"If you try to move right away you may get a fever. I'm going back  to the house, and I'll bring you down some blankets. Morgan says you  shouldn't attempt to move for several hours. He says you've lost a  great deal of blood and that you mustn't make any effort or ride a  horse till tomorrow.\"    Dan relaxed with a sigh.    \"Kate.\"    \"Yes, honey.\"    Her hand travelled lightly as blown snow across his forehead. He  caught it and pressed the coolness against his cheek.    \"I feel as if I'd sort of been through a fire. I seem to be still  seein' red.\"    \"Dan, it makes me feel as if I never knew you! Now you must forget all  that has happened. Promise me you will!\"    He was silent for a moment and then he sighed again.    \"Maybe I can, Kate. Which I feel, though, as if there was somethin'  inside me writ--writ in red letters--I got to try to read the writin'  before I can talk much.\"    She barely heard him. Her hand was still against his face. A deep awe  and content was creeping through her, so that she began to smile and  was glad that the dark covered her face. She felt abashed before him  for the first time in her life, and there was a singular sense of  shame. It was as if some door in her inner heart had opened so that  Dan was at liberty to look down into her soul. There was terror in  this feeling, but there was also gladness.    \"Kate.\"    \"Yes--honey!\"    \"What were you hummin'?\"    She started.    \"I didn't know I was humming, Dan.\"    \"You were, all right. It sounded sort of familiar, but I couldn't  figger out where I heard it.\"    \"I know now. It's one of your own tunes.\"    Now she felt a tremor so strong that she feared he would notice it.    \"I must go back to the house, Dan. Maybe Dad has returned. If he has,  perhaps he can arrange to have you carried back tonight.\"    \"I don't want to think of movin', Kate. I feel mighty comfortable.  I'm forgettin' all about that ache in my head. Ain't that queer? Why,  Kate, what in the world are you laughin' about?\"    \"I don't know, Dan. I'm just happy!\"    \"Kate.\"    \"Yes?\"    \"I like you pretty much.\"    \"I'm so glad!\"    \"You an' Black Bart, an' Satan--\"    \"Oh!\" Her tone changed.    \"Why are you tryin' to take your hand away, Kate?\"    \"Don't you care for me any more than for your horse--and your dog?\"    He drew a long breath, puzzled.    \"It's some different, I figger.\"    \"Tell me!\"    \"If Black Bart died--\"    The wolf-dog whined, hearing his name.    \"Good ol' Bart! Well, if Black Bart died maybe I'd some day have  another dog I'd like almost as much.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"An' if Satan died--even Satan!--maybe I could sometime like another  hoss pretty well--if he was a pile like Satan! But if you was to  die--it'd be different, a considerable pile different.\"    \"Why?\"    His pauses to consider these questions were maddening.    \"I don't know,\" he muttered at last.    Once more she was thankful for the dark to hide her smile.    \"Maybe you know the reason, Kate?\"    Her laughter was rich music. His hold on her hand relaxed. He was  thinking of a new theme. When he laughed in turn it startled her. She  had never heard that laugh before.    \"What is it, Dan?\"    \"He was pretty big, Kate. He was bigger'n almost any man I ever seen!  It was kind of funny. After he hit me I was almost glad. I didn't hate  him--\"    \"Dear Dan!\"    \"I didn't hate him--I jest nacherally wanted to kill him--and wantin'  to do that made me glad. Isn't that funny, Kate?\"    He spoke of it as a chance traveller might point out a striking  feature of the landscape to a companion.    \"Dan, if you really care for me you must drop the thought of him.\"    His hand slipped away.    \"How can I do that? That writin' I was tellin' you about--\"    \"Yes?\"    \"It's about him!\"    \"Ah!\"    \"When he hit me the first time--\"    \"I won't hear you tell of it!\"    \"The blood come down my chin--jest a little trickle of it. It was  warm, Kate. That was what made me hot all through.\"    Her hands fell limp, cold, lifeless.    \"It's as clear as the print in a book. I've got to finish him. That's  the only way I can forget the taste of my own blood.\"    \"Dan, listen to me!\"    He laughed again, in the new way. She remembered that her father had  dreaded the very thing that had come to Dan--this first taste of his  own powers--this first taste (she shuddered) of blood!    \"Dan, you've told me that you like me. You have to make a choice now,  between pursuing this man, and me.\"    \"You don't understand,\" he explained carefully. \"I _got_ to follow  him. I can't help it no more'n Black Bart can help howlin' when he  sees the moon.\"    He fell silent, listening. Far across the hills came the plaintive  wail of a coyote--that shrill bodiless sound. Kate trembled.    \"Dan!\"    Outside, Satan whinnied softly like a call. She leaned and her lips  touched his. He thrust her away almost roughly.    \"They's blood on my lips, Kate! I can't kiss you till they're clean.\"    He turned his head.    \"You must listen to me, Dan!\"    \"Kate, would you talk to the wind?\"    \"Yes, if I loved the wind!\"    He turned his head.    She pleaded: \"Here are my hands to cover your eyes and shut out the  thoughts of this man you hate. Here are my lips, dear, to tell you  that I love you unless this thirst for killing carries you away from  me. Stay with me! Give me your heart to keep gentle!\"    He said nothing, but even through the dark she was aware of a struggle  in his face, and then, through the gloom, she began to see his  eyes more clearly. They seemed to be illuminated by a light from  within--they changed--there was a hint of yellow in the brown. And she  spoke again, blindly, passionately.    \"Give me your promise! It is so easy to do. One little word will make  you safe. It will save you from yourself.\"    Still he answered nothing. Black Bart came and crouched at his head  and stared at her fixedly.    \"Speak to me!\"    Only the yellow light answered her. Cold fear fought in her heart, but  love still struggled against it.    \"For the last time--for God's sake, Dan!\"    Still that silence. She rose, shaking and weak. The changeless eyes  followed her. Only fear remained now. She backed towards the door,  slowly, then faster, and faster. At the threshold she whirled and  plunged into the night.    Up the road she raced. Once she stumbled and fell to her knees. She  cried out and glanced behind her, breathing again when "]]]
