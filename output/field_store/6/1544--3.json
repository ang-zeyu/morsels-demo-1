No--not perfect,  for Anderson's joy held a bitter drop, the absence of his only son!    \"Oh, dad, what-all did you fetch me?\" cried Kathleen, and she deserted  her father for the bundle-laden Jake.    \"And me!\" echoed Rose.    Even Lenore, in the happiness of her father's return, was not proof  against the wonder and promise of those many bundles.    They all went within, through a hall to a great, cozy living-room. Mrs.  Anderson's very first words, after her welcoming smile, were a  half-faltered:    \"Any--news of--Jim?\"    \"Why--yes,\" replied Anderson, hesitatingly.    Suddenly the three sisters were silent. How closely they resembled one  another then--Lenore, a budding woman; Rose, a budding girl; and  Kathleen, a rosy, radiant child! Lenore lost a little of her bloom.    \"What news, father?\" she asked.    \"Haven't you heard from him?\" returned Anderson.    \"Not for a whole week. He wrote the day he reached Spokane. But then he  hardly knew anything except that he'd enlisted.\"    \"I'm sure glad Jim didn't wait for the draft,\" replied the father.  \"Well, mother an' girls, Jim was gone when I got to Spokane. All I heard  was that he was well when he left for Frisco an' strong for the aviation  corps.\"    \"Then he means to--to be an aviator,\" said Lenore, with quivering lips.    \"Sure, if he can get in. An' he's wise. Jim knows engines. He has a  knack for machinery. An' nerve! No boy ever had more. He'll make a crack  flier.\"    \"But--the danger!\" whispered the boy's mother, with a shudder.    \"I reckon there'll be a little danger, mother,\" replied Anderson,  cheerfully. \"We've got to take our chance on Jim. There's one sure bet.  If he had stayed home he'd been fightin' I.W.W.'s!\"    That trying moment passed. Mrs. Anderson said that she would see to  supper being put on the table at once. The younger girls began untying  the bundles. Lenore studied her father's face a moment.    \"Jake, you run along,\" she said to the waiting cowboy. \"Wait till after  supper before you worry father.\"    \"I'll do thet, Miss Lenore,\" drawled Jake, \"an' if he wants worryin'  he'll hev to look me up.\"    \"Lass, I'm only tired, not worried,\" replied Anderson, as Jake shuffled  out with jingling spurs.    \"Did anything serious happen in Spokane?\" she asked anxiously.    \"No. But Spokane men are alive to serious trouble ahead,\" replied her  father. \"I spoke to the Chamber of Commerce--sure exploded a bomb in  that camp. Then I had conferences with a good many different men. Fact  is they ran me pretty hard. Couldn't have slept much, anyhow, in that  heat. Lass, this is the place to live!... I'd rather die here than live  in Spokane, in summer.\"    \"Did you see the Governor?\"    \"Yes, an' he wasn't as anxious about the Golden Valley as the Bend  country. He's right, too. We're old Westerners here. We can handle  trouble. But they're not Americans up there in the Bend.\"    \"Father, we met one American,\" said Lenore, dreamily.    \"By George! we did!... An' that reminds me. There was a government  official from Washington, come out to Spokane to investigate conditions.  I forget his name. He asked to meet me an' he was curious about the  Bend--its loyalty to the U.S. I told him all I knew an' what I thought.  An' then he said he was goin' to motor through that wheat-belt an' talk  to what Americans he could find, an' impress upon them that they could  do as much as soldiers to win the war. Wheat--bread--that's our great  gun in this war, Lenore!... I knew this, but I was made pretty blamed  sober by that government man. I told him by all means to go to Palmer  an' to have a talk with young Dorn. I sure gave that boy a good word.  Poor lad! He's true blue. An' to think of him with that old German  devil. Old Dorn has always had a hard name. An' this war has brought out  the German cussedness.\"    \"Father, I'm glad you spoke well of the young man,\" said Lenore, still  dreamily.    \"Hum! You never told me what you thought,\" replied her father, with a  quick glance of inquiry at her. Lenore was gazing out of the window,  away across the wheat-fields and the range. Anderson watched her a  moment, and then resumed: \"If I can get away I'm goin' to drive up to  see Dorn again pretty soon. Do you want to go?\"    Lenore gave a little start, as if the question had surprised her.    \"I--I hardly think so,\" she replied.    \"It's just as well,\" he said. \"That'll be a hard ride.... Guess I'll  clean up a little for supper.\"    Anderson left the room, and, while Kathleen and Rose gleefully squabbled  over the bundles, Lenore continued to gaze dreamily out of the window.           *       *       *       *       *    That night Lenore went early to her room, despite the presence of some  young people from a neighboring village. She locked her door and sat in  the dark beside her open window.    An early moon silvered the long slopes of wheat and made the alfalfa  squares seem black. A cool, faint, sweet breeze fanned her cheek. She  could smell the fragrance of apples, of new-mown hay, and she could hear  the low murmur of running water. A hound bayed off somewhere in the  fields. There was no other sound. It was a quiet, beautiful, pastoral  scene. But somehow it did not comfort Lenore.    She seemed to doubt the sincerity of what she saw there and loved so  well. Moon-blanched and serene, lonely and silent, beautiful and  promising, the wide acres of \"Many Waters,\" and the silver slopes and  dark mountains beyond, did not tell the truth. 'Way over the dark ranges  a hideous war had stretched out a red hand to her country. Her only  brother had left his home to fight, and there was no telling if he would  ever come back. Evil forces were at work out there in the moonlight.  There had come a time for her to be thoughtful.    Her father's asking her to ride to the Bend country had caused some  strange little shock of surprise. Lenore had dreamed without thinking.  Here in the darkness and silence, watching the crescent moon slowly  sink, she did think. And it was to learn that she remembered singularly  well the first time she had seen young Dorn, and still more vividly the  second time, but the third time seemed both clear and vague. Enough  young men had been smitten with Lenore to enable her to gauge the  symptoms of these easy-come, easy-go attractions. In fact, they rather  repelled her. But she had found Dorn's manner striking, confusing, and  unforgettable. And why that should be so interested her intelligence.    It was confusing to discover that she could not lay it to the sympathy  she had felt for an American boy in a difficult position, because she  had often thought of him long before she had any idea who he was or  where he lived.    In the very first place, he had been unforgettable for two  reasons--because he had been so struck at sight of her that he had gazed  unconsciously, with a glow on his face and a radiance in his eye, as of  a young poet spellbound at an inspiration; and because he seemed the  physical type of young man she had idealized--a strong, lithe-limbed,  blond giant, with a handsome, frank face, clear-cut and smooth,  ruddy-cheeked and blue-eyed.    Only after meeting him out there in the desert of wheat had she felt  sympathy for him. And now with intelligence and a woman's intuition,  barring the old, insidious, dreamy mood, Lenore went over in retrospect  all she could remember of that meeting. And the truth made her sharply  catch her breath. Dorn had fallen in love with her. Intuition declared  that, while her intelligence repudiated it. Stranger than all was the  thrill which began somewhere in the unknown depths of her and mounted,  to leave her tingling all over. She had told her father that she did not  want to ride to the Bend country. But she did want to go! And that  thought, flashing up, would not be denied. To want to meet a strange  young man again was absolutely a new and irritating discovery for  Lenore. It mystified her, because she had not had time to like Dorn.  Liking an acquaintance had nothing to do with the fact. And that stunned  her.    \"Could it be--love at first sight?\" she whispered, incredulously, as she  stared out over the shadowing fields.    \"For me? Why, how absurd--impossible!... I--I only remembered him--a big  handsome boy with blazing eyes.... And now I'm sorry for him!\"    To whisper her amaze and doubt and consternation only augmented the  instinctive recurring emotion. She felt something she could not explain.  And that something was scarcely owing to this young man's pitiful  position between duty to his father and love for his country. It had to  do with his blazing eyes; intangible, dreamlike perceptions of him as  not real, of vague sweet fancies that retreated before her introspective  questioning. What alarmed Lenore was a tendency of her mind to shirk  this revealing analysis. Never before had she been afraid to look into  herself. But now she was finding unplumbed wells of feeling, secret  chambers of dreams into which she had never let the light, strange  instinctive activities, more physical than mental. When in her life  before had she experienced a nameless palpitation of her heart?    Long she sat there, staring out into the night. And the change in the  aspect of the broad spaces, now dark and impenetrable and mysterious,  seemed like the change in the knowledge of herself. Once she had  flattered herself that she was an inch of crystal water; now she seemed  a complex, aloof, and contrary creature, almost on the verge of  tumultuous emotions.    She said her prayers that night, a girlish habit resumed since her  brother had declared his intention of enlisting in the army. And to that  old prayer, which her mother had prayed before her, she added an appeal  of her own.

Thus, and I believe thus only, can we explain the facts connected   with these boulder pebbles.  No agent known on earth can have stuck   them in the clay, save ice, which is known to do so still elsewhere.    No known agent can have scratched them as they are scratched, save   ice, which is known to do so still elsewhere.    No known agent--certainly not, in my opinion, the existing rivers--  can have accumulated the vast beds of boulders which lie along the   course of certain northern rivers; notably along the Dee about   Aboyne--save ice bearing them slowly down from the distant summits of   the Grampians.    No known agent, save ice, can have produced those rounded, and   polished, and scored, and fluted rochers moutonnes \"sheep-backed   rocks\"--so common in the Lake district; so common, too, in Snowdon,   especially between the two lakes of Llanberis; common in Kerry; to be   seen anywhere, as far as I have ascertained, around the Scotch   Highlands, where the turf is cleared away from an unweathered surface   of the rock, in the direction in which a glacier would have pressed   against it had one been there.  Where these polishings and scorings   are found in narrow glens, it is, no doubt, an open question whether   some of them may not be the work of water.  But nothing but the   action of ice can have produced what I have seen in land-locked and   quiet fords in Kerry--ice-flutings in polished rocks below high-water   mark, so large that I could lie down in one of them.  Nothing but the   action of ice could produce what may be seen in any of our mountains-  -whole sheets of rock ground down into rounded flats, irrespective of   the lie of the beds, not in valleys, but on the brows and summits of   mountains, often ending abruptly at the edge of some sudden cliff,   where the true work of water, in the shape of rain and frost, is   actually destroying the previous work of ice, and fulfilling the rule   laid down (I think by Professor Geikie in his delightful book on   Scotch scenery as influenced by its geology), that ice planes down   into flats, while water saws out into crags and gullies; and that the   rain and frost are even now restoring Scotch scenery to something of   that ruggedness and picturesqueness which it must have lost when it   lay, like Greenland, under the indiscriminating grinding of a heavy   sheet of ice.    Lastly; no known agent, save ice, will explain those perched   boulders, composed of ancient hard rocks, which may be seen in so   many parts of these islands and of the Continent.  No water power   could have lifted those stones, and tossed them up high and dry on   mountain ridges and promontories, upon rocks of a totally different   kind.  Some of my readers surely recollect Wordsworth's noble lines   about these mysterious wanderers, of which he had seen many a one   about his native hills:      As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie  Couched on the bald top of an eminence,  Wonder to all who do the same espy  By what means it could thither come, and whence;  So that it seems a thing endued with sense:  Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf  Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself.      Yes; but the next time you see such a stone, believe that the wonder   has been solved, and found to be, like most wonders in Nature, more   wonderful than we guessed it to be.  It is not a sea-beast which has   crawled forth, but an ice-beast which has been left behind; lifted up   thither by the ice, as surely as the famous Pierre-a-bot, forty feet   in diameter, and hundreds of boulders more, almost as large as   cottages, have been carried by ice from the distant Alps right across   the lake of Neufchatel, and stranded on the slopes of the Jura, nine   hundred feet above the lake. {4}    Thus, I think, we have accounted for facts enough to make it probable   that Britain was once covered partly by an ice-sheet, as Greenland is   now, and partly, perhaps, by an icy sea.  But, to make assurance more   sure, let us look for new facts, and try whether our ice-dream will   account for them also.  Let us investigate our case as a good medical   man does, by \"verifying his first induction.\"    He says:  At the first glance, I can see symptoms a, b, c.  It is   therefore probable that my patient has got complaint A.  But if he   has he ought to have symptom d also.  If I find that, my guess will   be yet more probable.  He ought also to have symptom e, and so forth;   and as I find successively each of these symptoms which are proper to   A, my first guess will become more and more probable, till it reaches   practical certainty.    Now let us do the same, and say--If this strange dream be true, and   the lowlands of the North were once under an icy sea, ought we not to   find sea-shells in their sands and clays?  Not abundantly, of course.    We can understand that the sea-animals would be too rapidly covered   up in mud, and too much disturbed by icebergs and boulders, to be   very abundant.  But still, some should surely be found here and   there.    Doubtless; and if my northern-town readers will search the boulder-  clay pits near them, they will most probably find a few shells, if   not in the clay itself, yet in sand-beds mixed with them, and   probably underlying them.  And this is a notable fact, that the more   species of shells they find, the more they will find--if they work   out their names from any good book of conchology--of a northern type;   of shells which notoriously, at this day, inhabit the colder seas.    It is impossible for me here to enter at length on a subject on which   a whole literature has been already written.  Those who wish to study   it may find all that they need know, and more, in Lyell's \"Student's   Elements of Geology,\" and in chapter xii. of his \"Antiquity of Man.\"    They will find that if the evidence of scientific conchologists be   worth anything, the period can be pointed out in the strata, though   not of course in time, at which these seas began to grow colder, and   southern and Mediterranean shells to disappear, their places being   taken by shells of a temperate, and at last of an Arctic climate;   which last have since retreated either toward their native North, or   into cold water at great depths.  From Essex across to Wales, from   Wales to the aestuary of the Clyde, this fact has been verified again   and again.  And in the search for these shells, a fresh fact, and a   most startling one, was discovered.  They are to be found not only in   the clay of the lowlands, but at considerable heights up the hills,   showing that, at some time or other, these hills have been submerged   beneath the sea.    Let me give one example, which any tourist into Wales may see for   himself.  Moel Tryfaen is a mountain over Carnarvon.  Now perched on   the side of that mountain, fourteen hundred feet above the present   sea-level, is an ancient sea-beach, five-and-thirty feet thick, lying   on great ice-scratched boulders, which again lie on the mountain   slates.  It was discovered by the late Mr. Trimmer, now, alas! lost   to Geology.  Out of that beach fifty-seven different species of   shells have been taken; eleven of them are now exclusively Arctic,   and not found in our seas; four of them are still common to the   Arctic seas and to our own; and almost all the rest are northern   shells.    Fourteen hundred feet above the present sea:  and that, it must be   understood, is not the greatest height at which such shells may be   found hereafter.  For, according to Professor Ramsay, drift of the   same kind as that on Moel Tryfaen is found at a height of two   thousand three hundred feet.    Now I ask my readers to use their common sense over this astounding   fact--which, after all, is only one among hundreds; to let (as Mr.   Matthew Arnold would well say) their \"thought play freely\" about it;   and consider for themselves what those shells must mean.  I say not   may, but must, unless we are to believe in a \"Deus quidam deceptor,\"   in a God who puts shells upon mountain-sides only to befool honest   human beings, and gives men intellects which are worthless for even   the simplest work.  Those shells must mean that that mountain, and   therefore the mountains round it, must have been once fourteen   hundred feet at least lower than they are now.  That the sea in which   they were sunk was far colder than now.  That icebergs brought and   dropped boulders round their flanks.  That upon those boulders a sea-  beach formed, and that dead shells were beaten into it from a sea-  bottom close by.  That, and no less, Moel Tryfaen must mean.    But it must mean, also, a length of time which has been well called   \"appalling.\"  A length of time sufficient to let the mountain sink   into the sea.  Then length of time enough to enable those Arctic   shells to crawl down from the northward, settle, and propagate   themselves generation after generation; then length of time enough to   uplift their dead remains, and the beach, and the boulders, and all   Snowdonia, fourteen hundred feet into the air.  And if anyone should   object that the last upheaval may have been effected suddenly by a   few tremendous earthquakes, we must answer--We have no proof of it.    Earthquakes upheave lands now only by slight and intermittent upward   pulses; nay, some lands we know to rise without any earthquake   pulses, but by simple, slow, upward swelling of a few feet in a   century; and we have no reason, and therefore no right, to suppose   that Snowdonia was upheaved by any means or at any rate which we do   not witness now; and therefore we are bound to allow, not only that   there was a past \"age of ice,\" but that that age was one of   altogether enormous duration.    But meanwhile some of you, I presume, will be ready to cry--Stop!  It   may be our own weakness; but you are really going on too fast and too   far for our small"]]]
