He has these, the  physical side and the spiritual side, under two names, the glowing  one, S[=u]rya, and the enlivener, Savitar;[4] but he is also the good  god who bestows benefits, and as such he was known, probably locally,  by the name of Bhaga. Again, as a herdsman's god, possibly at first  also a local deity, he is P[=u]shan (the meaning is almost the same  with that of Savitar). As the 'mighty one' he is Vishnu, who measures  heaven in three strides. In general, the conception of the sun as a  physical phenomenon will be found voiced chiefly in the family-books:  \"The sightly form rises on the slope of the sky as the swift-going  steed carries him ... seven sister steeds carry him.\"[5] This is the  prevailing utterance. Sometimes the sun is depicted under a medley of  metaphors: \"A bull, a flood, a red bird, he has entered his father's  place; a variegated stone he is set in the midst of the sky; he has  advanced and guards the two ends of space.\"[6] One after the other the  god appears to the poets as a bull, a bird,[7] a steed, a stone, a  jewel, a flood, a torch-holder,[8] or as a gleaming car set in heaven.  Nor is the sun independent. As in the last image of a chariot,[9] so,  without symbolism, the poet speaks of the sun as made to rise by  Varuna and Mitra: \"On their wonted path go Varuna and Mitra when in  the sky they cause to rise Surya, whom they made to avert darkness\";  where, also, the sun, under another image, is the \"support of the  sky.\"[10] Nay, in this simpler view, the sun is no more than the \"eye  of Mitra Varuna,\"[11] a conception formally retained even when the sun  in the same breath is spoken of as pursuing Dawn like a lover, and as  being the 'soul of the universe' (I. 115. 1-2). In the older passages  the later moral element is almost lacking, nor is there maintained the  same physical relation between Sun and Dawn. In the earlier hymns the  Dawn is the Sun's mother, from whom he proceeds.[12] It is the \"Dawns  produced the Sun,\" in still more natural language;[13] whereas, the  idea of the lover-Sun following the Dawn scarcely occurs in the  family-books.[14] Distinctly late, also, is the identification of the  sun with the all-spirit _([=a]tm[=a],_ I. 115. 1), and the following  prayer: \"Remove, O sun, all weakness, illness, and bad dreams.\" In  this hymn, X. 37. 14, S[=u]rya is the son of the sky, but he is  evidently one with Savitar, who in V. 82. 4, removes bad dreams, as in  X. 100. 8, he removes sickness. Men are rendered 'sinless' by the sun  (IV. 54. 3; X. 37. 9) exactly as they are by the other gods, Indra,  Varuna, etc. In a passage that refers to the important triad of sun,  wind and fire, X. 158. I ff., the sun is invoked to 'save from the  sky,' _i.e._ from all evils that may come from the upper regions;  while in the same book the sun, like Indra, is represented as the  slayer of demons _(asuras)_ and dragons; as the slayer, also, of the  poet's rivals; as giving long life to the worshipper, and as himself  drinking sweet _soma_. This is one of the poems that seem to be at  once late and of a forced and artificial character (X. 170).    Although S[=u]rya is differentiated explicitly from Savitar (V. 81. 4,  \"Savitar, thou joyest in S[=u]a's rays\"), yet do many of the hymns  make no distinction between them. The Enlivener is naturally extolled  in fitting phrase, to tally with his title: \"The shining-god, the  Enlivener, is ascended to enliven the world\"; \"He gives protection,  wealth and children\" (II. 38.1; IV. 53. 6-7). The later hymns seem, as  one might expect, to show greater confusion between the attributes of  the physical and spiritual sun. But what higher power under either  name is ascribed to the sun in the later hymns is not due to a higher  or more developed homage of the sun as such. On the contrary, as with  many other deities, the more the praise the less the individual  worship. It is as something more than the sun that the god later  receives more fulsome devotion. And, in fact, paradoxical as it seems,  it is a decline in sun-worship proper that is here registered. The  altar-fire becomes more important, and is revered in the sun, whose  hymns, at most, are few, and in part mechanical.    Bergaigne in his great work, _La Religion Vedique_, has laid much  stress on sexual antithesis as an element in Vedic worship. It seems  to us that this has been much exaggerated. The sun is masculine; the  dawn, feminine. But there is no indication of a primitive antithesis  of male and female in their relations. What occurs appears to be of  adventitious character. For though sun and dawn are often connected,  the latter is represented first as his mother and afterwards as his  'wife' or mistress. Even in the later hymns, where the marital  relation is recognized, it is not insisted upon. But Bergaigne[15] is  right in saying that in the Rig Veda the sun does not play the part of  an evil power, and it is a good illustration of the difference between  Rik and Atharvan, when Ehni cites, to prove that the sun is like  death, only passages from the Atharvan and the later Brahmanic  literature.[16]    When, later, the Hindus got into a region where the sun was deadly,  they said, \"Yon burning sun-god is death,\" but in the Rig Veda' they  said, \"Yon sun is the source of life,\"[17] and no other conception of  the sun is to be found in the Rig Veda.    There are about a dozen hymns to S[=u]rya, and as many to Savitar, in  the Rig Veda.[18] It is noteworthy that in the family-books the hymns  to Savitar largely prevail, while those to S[=u]rya are chiefly late  in position or content. Thus, in the family-books, where are found  eight or nine of the dozen hymns to Savitar, there are to S[=u]rya but  three or four, and of these the first is really to Savitar and the  Acvins; the second is an imitation of the first; the third appears to  be late; and the fourth is a fragment of somewhat doubtful antiquity.  The first runs as follows: \"The altar-fire has seen well-pleased the  dawns' beginning and the offering to the gleaming ones; come, O ye  horsemen (Acvins), to the house of the pious man; the sun (S[=u]rya),  the shining-god, rises with light. The shining-god Savitar has  elevated his beams, swinging his banner like a good (hero) raiding for  cattle. According to rule go Varuna and Mitra when they make rise in  the sky the sun (S[=u]rya) whom they have created to dissipate  darkness, being (gods) sure of their habitation and unswerving in  intent. Seven yellow swift-steeds bear this S[=u]rya, the seer of all  that moves. Thou comest with swiftest steeds unspinning the web,  separating, O shining-god, the black robe. The rays of S[=u]rya  swinging (his banner) have laid darkness like a skin in the waters.  Unconnected, unsupported, downward extending, why does not this (god)  fall down? With what nature goes he, who knows (literally, 'who has  seen')? As a support he touches and guards the vault of the sky\" (IV.  13).    There is here, no more than in the early hymn from the first book,  translated in the first chapter, any worship of material phenomena.  S[=u]rya is worshipped as Savitar, either expressly so called, or with  all the attributes of the spiritual. The hymn that follows this[19] is  a bald imitation. In V. 47 there are more or less certain signs of  lateness, _e.g.,_ in the fourth stanza (\"four carry him, ... and ten  give the child to drink that he may go,\" etc.) there is the juggling  with unexplained numbers, which is the delight of the later  priesthood. Moreover, this hymn is addressed formally to Mitra-Varuna  and Agni, and not to the sun-god, who is mentioned only in metaphor;  while the final words _namo dive_, 'obeisance to heaven,' show that  the sun is only indirectly addressed. One cannot regard hymns  addressed to Mitra-Varuna and S[=u]rya (with other gods) as primarily  intended for S[=u]rya, who in these hymns is looked upon as the  subject of Mitra and Varuna, as in VII. 62; or as the \"eye\" of the two  other gods, and 'like Savitar' in VII. 63. So in VII. 66. 14-16, a  mere fragment of a hymn is devoted exclusively to S[=u]rya as \"lord of  all that stands and goes.\" But in these hymns there are some very  interesting touches. Thus in VII. 60. 1, the sun does not make  sinless, but he announces to Mitra and Varuna that the mortal is  sinless. There are no other hymns than these addressed to S[=u]rya,  save those in the first and tenth books, of which nine stanzas of I.  50 (see above) may be reckoned early, while I. 115, where the sun is  the soul of the universe, and at the same time the eye of  Mitra-Varuna, is probably late; and I. 163 is certainly so, wherein  the sun is identified with Yama, Trita, etc.; is 'like Varuna'; and is  himself a steed, described as having three connections in the sky,  three in the waters, three in the sea. In one of the hymns in the  tenth book, also a mystical song, the sun is the 'bird' of the sky, a  metaphor which soon gives another figure to the pantheon in the form  of Garutman, the sun-bird, of whose exploits are told strange tales in  the epic, where he survives as Garuda. In other hymns S[=u]rya averts  carelessness at the sacrifice, guards the worshipper, and slays  demons. A mechanical little hymn describes him as measuring the  'thirty stations.' Not one of these hymns has literary freshness or  beauty of any kind. They all belong to the class of stereotyped  productions, which differ in origin and content from the hymns first  mentioned.[20]      SAVITAR.    Turning to Savitar one finds, of course, many of the same descriptive  traits as in the praise of S[=u]rya, his more material self. But with  the increased spirituality come new features. Savitar is not alone the  sun that rises; he is also the sun that sets; and is extolled as such.  There are other indications that most of the hymns composed for him  are to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14515"],[0,"The Nervous Child (#10)"],[1,"the delicious  flavour with such fervour that the child's suspicions are at once  aroused. Previous experience has made him connect these excessive  praises with articles which have aroused his distaste. If these fads  and fancies on the part of the child are to be avoided, it is  essential that we should do nothing to focus his attention on his  refusal. It is better that his dinner should be curtailed on one  occasion than that taste and appetite should be perverted perhaps for  years. Every nurse or mother should cultivate an off-hand, detached  manner of feeding the child, and should patiently continue to offer  the food without uncalled-for comments or exhortations. Let her always  remember the force of suggestion on the child's mind, and that a  confident manner which never questions the child's acceptance will  meet with acceptance, while a hesitating address, from fear of the  impending refusal, will be apt to meet with refusal. Sometimes a still  worse fault manifests itself, when nurse and mother speak before the  child of the smallness of his appetite, and of his persistent refusal  of this or that article of diet. The suggestion then acts still more  powerfully on his mind. He is aware that the whole household is  distressed by his peculiarity, and he grows to identify it with his  own individuality, and to regard himself with some satisfaction as  possessing this mark of distinction. If there is any difficulty of  this sort it is often directly curative to reverse the suggestion and  to speak before him of his improving appetite, and to say that he  begins every day to eat better and better, even if to do so we have to  break a good rule never to say to the child what is not strictly true.  Or once or twice we may take his plate away before he has finished,  saying positively that he has eaten so much that he must eat no more.  If in spite of every care antipathies to certain articles of food  appear and persist, we must be content to bide our time. When the  child grows of an age to reason, we should seize every opportunity to  make him feel that his persistent refusal is a little ridiculous and  childish. Little by little the seed is sown, and will germinate till  one day we shall note with surprise that he has taken of his own  accord that which he has neglected for so long and with such  obstinacy.    But the force which is acting most strongly in producing this refusal  of food is the force of which we have spoken in a previous  chapter--the force which results in negativism, the force which is in  reality the habit of opposition, the love of power, and the desire to  attract attention. Here again the refusal of food, if due to this  cause, is never the sole manifestation of the fault. Just as the delay  in learning to swallow and to chew properly and to feed himself is  part of a general want of dexterity and capacity manifested in all his  actions, so it will seldom happen that the child's anxiety to oppose  is only seen at meal-times. Watch a nervous child in the nursery  before the dinner hour. He is cross and restless and inclined to cry.  The nurse hands him a doll, and he throws it away saying, \"No, no  doll.\" At the same moment he may catch sight of his ball, and it too  is violently rejected, \"No, no ball.\" Everything in turn is treated in  the same way. Finally he falls upon his nurse, crying and beating her  with his hands, saying, \"No, no Nurse.\" If that long-suffering woman  at that moment summons him to dinner, it will be strange indeed if his  attitude is not \"No, no dinner,\" and \"No, no\" to every mouthful  offered him. How strong this love of opposition may be is illustrated  by the case of a little boy who was brought to me for refusal of food.  Three weeks before, he had been taken in a motor-car to his  grandfather's to midday dinner on Sunday, when his absolute refusal of  food had spoiled the day and had occupied the attention and the  efforts of the whole party. Doubtless he had enjoyed himself, for  three weeks later, when he caught sight of the car which was to bring  him to me, and which he had not seen in the interval, he at once said,  \"Not eat my dinner.\" This child's father told me that the sight or  sound of the preparation of a meal was enough to bring on a paroxysm  of opposition. Now this force of opposition, as we have seen, only  develops into a serious difficulty when the child's own will has been  opposed too much, when authority has been too freely exercised, and  when the child has been urged and entreated and reproved with too  great frequency. His opposition grows with all counter-opposition. And  he is not really naughty, only irritable and restless from the  thwarting of his natural impulses, and unable to express his thoughts  and desires. Negativism will not often confine itself to meal-times.  It will show clearly in all the actions of the child, and to get him  to eat well and freely we must so change our management of him that  negativism disappears or at least diminishes. There is no other way.  No entreaty, no force, no threats of force will ever succeed, but will  only make him worse, and, since negativism is due to mental unrest,  the struggles and crying will only perpetuate the cause. The one way  to banish negativism and overcome the opposition is to cease to  oppose, and to practise this aloofness not so much at meal-times, for  somehow by patience the child must be got to take his food, but in all  our conduct to him. Repression and reproof, and thwarting of the  child's will, and coaxing and entreaty must cease. There is no fear  that we shall thereby make the child unduly disobedient. We have  already, in another chapter, decided that negativism is not strength  of will on the part of the child which must be broken, but is the  result of constant attempts to oppose his nature, and the consequent  nervous unrest. If we cease to oppose, the symptoms will tend rapidly  to disappear, the child will become busy and contented and happy in  his play, and we shall hear no more of his refusal of food. If  sometimes it recurs for a week or two, we shall know how to deal with  it.    In children, as with us, periods of nervous unrest and unhappiness are  apt to recur in a sort of cycle. This cyclical character of mental  disturbance is often a marked feature. We see it in epilepsy and  in what the French have called Folie Circulaire. We see it in the  dipsomaniac, in the intermittency of his craving for drink and of his  periodical outbursts, and we see it in ourselves in those periods of  depression which recur so often, we know not why. Little children too  sometimes get out on the wrong side of their beds, and never get right  the whole long day. Their own experience of the vagaries of mental  states should lead mothers to be indulgent to the children in their  days of cloud and to be particularly careful not to goad them by  well-intentioned efforts into bursts of naughtiness and passion, each  one of which tends to perpetuate the condition and increase the  nervous unrest. We know how closely dependent is the sensation of  appetite upon emotional states, and we must do all in our power--and  the task is sometimes one of real difficulty--to keep the child's mind  sufficiently at rest to preserve the healthy desire for food  unimpaired. If there is no sign of appetite, but every sign of  restlessness and irritability, we must seek in the management of the  child until we find the fault.    If food is taken mechanically and without appetite, if the preliminary  changes in the stomach wall which are necessary for adequate digestion  do not take place, but are inhibited by the mental unrest, the meal is  apt to be followed by gastric pain and discomfort, or, more commonly  with children, the stomach may promptly reject its contents. At the  worst, nervous vomiting of this sort may follow almost every meal,  although, again, it is curious to note how little, comparatively  speaking, the nutrition of the child suffers. The vomiting too, as in  adults, comes very near being a voluntary act, and mothers and nurses  will often remark that they get the impression that it can be  controlled at will. If once the diagnosis is made that the want of  appetite or the vomiting is of nervous origin, the treatment of the  condition is clear. Sedative drugs directed towards quieting the  nervous excitability may be of service, but tonics, appetisers,  laxatives, and drugs with a direct action on the stomach will have but  little effect. Nor is there as a rule anything to be gained by  modifying the diet or by excluding this or that article of food. The  frequency of the vomiting is such that it is apt to have brought  discredit one after the other upon almost every article of food which  the child can take, with the result that many useful and necessary  foods have been abandoned for long on the ground that they are the  cause of the dyspepsia. A permanent cure will only be effected when  the faults of environment have been overcome, when the cause of the  nervous unrest has been removed, and when the child's mind is at  peace.    Nervous vomiting of this kind is not difficult to control, if those in  charge of the children can be made to understand that the cause lies  in the anxiety which they themselves show before the child, increasing  his own apprehension or adding to his sense of power or importance.  Once the child is convinced that his conduct excites no particular  interest, the vomiting soon ceases. In more than one instance,  vomiting which has persisted for many months has stopped at once after  the matter has been fully explained to the parents. In the most  inveterate case of this sort which has come under my notice, the child  was regularly sick as soon as he caught sight of a white cloth being  laid on the table for meals. Yet even this child never vomited when he  was under the charge of a particular nurse who had to return more than  once "]]]
