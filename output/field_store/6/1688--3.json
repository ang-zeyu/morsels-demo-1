As regards the attitude of the earliest Christian ascetics in      this matter I may refer the reader to an interesting passage in      Lecky's _History of European Morals_ (vol. ii, pp. 107-112), in      which are brought together a number of highly instructive      examples of the manner in which many of the most eminent of the      early saints deliberately cultivated personal filth.        In the middle ages, when the extreme excesses of the early      ascetics had died out, and monasticiam became regulated, monks      generally took two baths a year when in health; in illness they      could be taken as often as necessary. The rules of Cluny only      allowed three towels to the community: one for the novices, one      for the professed, and one for the lay brothers. At the end of      the seventeenth century Madame de Mazarin, having retired to a      convent of Visitandines, one day desired to wash her feet, but      the whole establishment was set in an uproar at such an idea, and      she received a direct refusal. In 1760 the Dominican Richard      wrote that in itself the bath is permissible, but it must be      taken solely for necessity, not for pleasure. The Church taught,      and this lesson is still inculcated in convent schools, that it      is wrong to expose the body even to one's own gaze, and it is not      surprising that many holy persons boasted that they had never      even washed their hands. (Most of these facts have been taken      from A. Franklin, _Les Soins de Toilette_, one of the _Vie Privee      d'Autrefois_ series, in which further details may be found.)        In sixteenth-century Italy, a land of supreme elegance and      fashion, superior even to France, the conditions were the same,      and how little water found favor even with aristocratic ladies we      may gather from the contemporary books on the toilet, which      abound with recipes against itch and similar diseases. It should      be added that Burckhardt (_Die Cultur der Renaissance in      Italien_, eighth edition, volume ii, p. 92) considers that in      spite of skin diseases the Italians of the Renaissance were the      first nation in Europe for cleanliness.        It is unnecessary to consider the state of things in other      European countries. The aristocratic conditions of former days      are the plebeian conditions of to-day. So far as England is      concerned, such documents as Chadwick's _Report on the Sanitary      Condition of the Laboring Population of Great Britain_ (1842)      sufficiently illustrate the ideas and the practices as regards      personal cleanliness which prevailed among the masses during the      nineteenth century and which to a large extent still prevail.    A considerable amount of opprobrium has been cast upon the Catholic Church  for its direct and indirect influence in promoting bodily uncleanliness.  Nietzsche sarcastically refers to the facts, and Mr. Frederick Harrison  asserts that \"the tone of the middle ages in the matter of dirt was a form  of mental disease.\" It would be easy to quote many other authors to the  same effect.    It is necessary to point out, however, that the writers who have committed  themselves to such utterances have not only done an injustice to  Christianity, but have shown a lack of historical insight. Christianity  was essentially and fundamentally a rebellion against the classic world,  against its vices, and against their concomitant virtues, against both its  practices and its ideals. It sprang up in a different part of the  Mediterranean basin, from a different level of culture; it found its  supporters in a new and lower social stratum. The cult of charity,  simplicity, and faith, while not primarily ascetic, became inevitably  allied with asceticism, because from its point of view: sexuality was the  very stronghold of the classic world. In the second century the genius of  Clement of Alexandria and of the great Christian thinkers who followed him  seized on all those elements in classic life and philosophy which could be  amalgamated with Christianity without, as they trusted, destroying its  essence, but in the matter of sexuality there could be no compromise, and  the condemnation of sexuality involved the condemnation of the bath. It  required very little insight and sagacity for the Christians to  see--though we are now apt to slur over the fact--that the cult of the  bath was in very truth the cult of the flesh.[22] However profound their  ignorance of anatomy, physiology, and psychology might be, they had  before them ample evidence to show that the skin is an outlying sexual  zone and that every application which promoted the purity, brilliance, and  healthfulness of the skin constituted a direct appeal, feeble or strong as  the case might be, to those passions against which they were warring. The  moral was evident: better let the temporary garment of your flesh be  soaked with dirt than risk staining the radiant purity of your immortal  soul. If Christianity had not drawn that moral with clear insight and  relentless logic Christianity would never have been a great force in the  world.        If any doubt is felt as to the really essential character of the      connection between cleanliness and the sexual impulse it may be      dispelled by the consideration that the association is by no      means confined to Christian Europe. If we go outside Europe and      even Christendom altogether, to the other side of the world, we      find it still well marked. The wantonness of the luxurious people      of Tahiti when first discovered by European voyagers is      notorious. The Areoi of Tahiti, a society largely constituted on      a basis of debauchery, is a unique institution so far as      primitive peoples are concerned. Cook, after giving one of the      earliest descriptions of this society and its objects at Tahiti      (Hawkesworth, _An Account of Voyages_, etc., 1775, vol. ii, p.      55), immediately goes on to describe the extreme and scrupulous      cleanliness of the people of Tahiti in every respect; they not      only bathed their bodies and clothes every day, but in all      respects they carried cleanliness to a higher point than even      \"the politest assembly in Europe.\" Another traveler bears similar      testimony: \"The inhabitants of the Society Isles are, among all      the nations of the South Seas, the most cleanly; and the better      sort of them carry cleanliness to a very great length\"; they      bathe morning and evening in the sea, he remarks, and afterward      in fresh water to remove the particles of salt, wash their hands      before and after meals, etc. (J.R. Forster, \"_Observations made      during a Voyage round the World_,\" 1798, p. 398.) And William      Ellis, in his detailed description of the people of Tahiti      (_Polynesian Researches_, 1832, vol. i, especially Chapters VI      and IX), while emphasizing their extreme cleanliness, every      person of every class bathing at least once or twice a day,      dwells on what he considers their unspeakable moral debasement;      \"notwithstanding the apparent mildness of their disposition and      the cheerful vivacity of their conversation, no portion of the      human race was ever perhaps sunk lower in brutal licentiousness      and moral degradation.\"        After leaving Tahiti Cook went on to New Zealand. Here he found      that the people were more virtuous than at Tahiti, and also, he      found, less clean.    It is, however, a mistake to suppose that physical uncleanliness ruled  supreme through mediaeval and later times. It is true that the eighteenth  century, which saw the birth of so much that marks our modern world,  witnessed a revival of the old ideal of bodily purity. But the struggle  between two opposing ideals had been carried on for a thousand years or  more before this. The Church, indeed, was in this matter founded on an  impregnable rock. But there never has been a time when influences outside  the Church have not found a shelter somewhere. Those traditions of the  classic world which Christianity threw aside as useless or worse quietly  reappeared. In no respect was this more notably the case than in regard to  the love of pure water and the cult of the bath. Islam adopted the  complete Roman bath, and made it an institution of daily life, a necessity  for all classes. Granada is the spot in Europe where to-day we find the  most exquisite remains of Mohammedan culture, and, though the fury of  Christian conquest dragged the harrow over the soil of Granada, even yet  streams and fountains spring up there and gush abundantly and one seldom  loses the sound of the plash of water. The flower of Christian chivalry  and Christian intelligence went to Palestine to wrest the Holy Sepulchre  from the hands of pagan Mohammedans. They found there many excellent  things which they had not gone out to seek, and the Crusaders produced a  kind of premature and abortive Renaissance, the shadow of lost classic  things reflected on Christian Europe from the mirror of Islam.        Yet it is worth while to point out, as bearing on the      associations of the bath here emphasized, that even in Islam we      may trace the existence of a religious attitude unfavorable to      the bath. Before the time of Mohammed there were no public baths      in Arabia, and it was and is believed that baths are specially      haunted by the djinn--the evil spirits. Mohammed himself was at      first so prejudiced against public baths that he forbade both men      and women to enter them. Afterward, however, he permitted men to      use them provided they wore a cloth round the loins, and women      also when they could not conveniently bathe at home. Among the      Prophet's sayings is found the assertion: \"Whatever woman enters      a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#10)"],[1,"on may be fundamentally an erotic  symbolism, closely approaching foot-fetichism, and such slight indications  of masochism as appear may be merely a parasitic growth on the symbolism,  a growth perhaps more suggested by the circumstances involved in the  gratification of the abnormal desire than inherent in the innate impulse  of the subject. This may be illustrated by the interesting case of a very  intelligent man with whom I am well acquainted.        C.P., aged 38. Heredity good. Parents both healthy and normal.      Several children of the marriage, all sexually normal so far as      is known. C.P. is the youngest of the family and separated from      the others by an interval of many years. He was a seven-months'      child. He has always enjoyed good health and is active and      vigorous, both mentally and physically.        From the age of 9 or 10 to 14 he masturbated occasionally for the      sake of physical relief, having discovered the act for himself.      He was, however, quite innocent and knew nothing of sexual      matters, never having been initiated either by servants or by      other boys.        \"When I encounter a woman who very strongly attracts me and whom      I very greatly admire,\" he writes, \"my desire is never that I may      have sexual connection with her in the ordinary sense, but that I      may lie down upon the floor on my back and be trampled upon by      her. This curious desire is seldom present unless the object of      my admiration is really a lady, and of fine proportions. She must      be richly dressed--preferably in an evening gown, and wear dainty      high-heeled slippers, either quite open so as to show the curve      of the instep, or with only one strap or 'bar' across. The skirts      should be raised sufficiently to afford me the pleasure of seeing      her feet and a liberal amount of ankle, but in no case above the      knee, or the effect is greatly reduced. Although I often greatly      admire a woman's intellect and even person, sexually no other      part of her has any serious attraction for me except the leg,      from the knee downwards, and the foot, and these must be      exquisitely clothed. Given this condition, my desire amounts to a      wish to gratify my sexual sense by contact with the (to me)      attractive part of the woman. Comparatively few women have a leg      or foot sufficiently beautiful to my mind to excite any serious      or compelling desire, but when this is so, or I suspect it, I am      willing to spend any time or trouble to get her to tread upon me      and am anxious to be trampled on with the greatest severity.        \"The treading should be inflicted for a few minutes all over the      chest, abdomen and groin, and lastly on the penis, which is, of      course, lying along the belly in a violent state of erection, and      consequently too hard for the treading to damage it. I also enjoy      being nearly strangled by a woman's foot.        \"If the lady finally stands facing my head and places her slipper      upon my penis so that the high heel falls about where the penis      leaves the scrotum, the sole covering most of the rest of it and      with the other foot upon the abdomen, into which I can _see_ as      well as feel it sink as she shifts her weight from one foot to      the other, orgasm takes place almost at once. Emission under      these conditions is to me an agony of delight, during which      practically the lady's whole weight should rest upon the penis.        \"One reason for my special pleasure in this method seems to be      that first the heel and afterwards the sole of the slipper as it      treads upon the penis greatly check the passage of the semen and      consequently the pleasure is considerably prolonged. There is      also a curious mental side to the affair. I love to imagine that      the lady who is treading upon me is my mistress and I her slave,      and that she is doing it to punish me for some fault, or to give      _herself_ (not me) pleasure.        \"It follows that the greater the contempt and severity with which      I am 'punished,' the greater becomes my pleasure. The idea of      'punishment' or 'slavery' is seldom aroused except when I have      great difficulty in accomplishing my desire and the treader is      more than usually handsome and heavy and the trampling      mercilessly inflicted. I have been trampled so long and so      mercilessly several times, that I have flinched each time the      slipper pressed its way into my aching body and have been black      and blue for days afterwards. I take the greatest interest in      leading ladies on to do this for me where I think I will not      offend, and have been surprisingly successful. I must have lain      beneath the feet of quite a hundred women, many of them of good      social position, who would never dream of permitting any ordinary      sexual intercourse, but who have been so interested or amused by      the idea as to do it for me--many of them over and over again. It      is perhaps needless to say that none of my own or the ladies'      clothing is ever removed, or disarranged, for the accomplishment      of orgasm in this manner. After a long and varied experience, I      may say that my favorite weight is 10 to 11 stone, and that      black, very high-heeled slippers, in combination with tan silk      stockings, seem to give me the greatest pleasure and create in me      the strongest desires.        \"Boots, or outdoor shoes, do not attract me to anything like the      same degree, although I have, upon several occasions, enjoyed      myself fairly well by their use. Nude women repel me, and I find      no pleasure in seeing a woman in tights. I am not averse to      normal sexual connection and occasionally employ it. To me,      however, the pleasure is far inferior to that of being trampled      upon. I also derive keen pleasure--and usually have a strong      erection--from seeing a woman, dressed as I have described, tread      upon anything which yields under her foot--such as the seat of a      carriage, the cushions of a punt, a footstool, etc., and I enjoy      seeing her crush flowers by treading upon them. I have often      strolled along in the wake of some handsome lady at a picnic or      garden party, for the pleasure of seeing the grass upon which she      has trodden rise slowly again after her foot has pressed it. I      delight also to see a carriage sway as a woman leaves or enters      it--anything which needs the pressure of the foot.        \"To pass now to the origin of this direction of my feelings.        \"Even in early childhood I admired pretty feminine foot-gear, and      in the contemplation of it experienced vague sensations which I      now recognize as sexual. When a lad of 14 or so, I stayed a good      deal at the house of some intimate friends of my parents, the      daughter of the house--an only child--a beautiful and powerful      girl, about six years my senior, being my special chum. This girl      was always daintily dressed, and having most lovely feet and      ankles not unnaturally knew it. Whenever possible she dressed so      as to show off their beauty to the best advantage--rather short      skirts and usually little high-heeled slippers--and was not      averse to showing them in a most distractingly coquettish manner.      She seemed to have a passion for treading upon things which would      scrunch or yield under her foot, such as flowers, little      windfallen apples and pears, acorns, etc., or heaps of hay, straw      or cut grass. As we wandered about the gardens--for we were left      to do exactly as we liked--I got quite accustomed to seeing her      hunt out and tread upon such things, and used to chaff her about      it. At that time I was--as I am still--fond of lying at full      length on a thick hearthrug before a good fire. One evening as I      was lying in this way and we were alone, A. crossed the room to      reach a bangle from the mantelpiece. Instead of reaching over me,      she playfully stepped upon my body, saying that she would show me      how the hay and straw felt. Naturally I fell in with the joke and      laughed. After standing upon me a few moments she raised her      skirt slightly and, holding on to the mantelpiece for support,      stretched out one dainty foot in its brown silk stocking and      high-heeled slipper to the blaze to warm, while looking down and      laughing at my scarlet, excited face. She was a perfectly frank      and charming girl, and I feel pretty certain that, although she      evidently enjoyed my excitement and the feeling of my body      yielding under her feet, she did not on this first occasion      clearly understand my condition; nor can I remember that, though      the desire for sexual gratification drove me nearly mad, it      appeared to awaken in her any reciprocal feeling. I took hold of      her raised foot and, after kissing it, guided it by an absolutely      irresistible impulse on to my penis, which was as hard as wood      and seemed almost bursting. Almost at the moment that her weight      was thrown upon it, orgasm took place for the first time in my      life thoroughly and effectively. No description can give any idea      of what I felt--I only know that from that moment my distorted      sexual focus was fixed forever. Numberless times, after that      evening, I felt the weight of her dainty slippers, and nothing      will ever cause the memory of the pleasure she thus gave me to      fade. I know that A. came to enjoy treading upon me, as much as I      enjoyed having her do it. She had a liberal dress allowance and,      seeing the pleasure they gave me, she was always buying pretty      stockings and ravishing slippers with the highest and most      slender Louis heels she could find and would show them to me with      the greatest glee, urging me to lie"]]]
