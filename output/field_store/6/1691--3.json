Also that the discussion is idle on the  shewing of the German case itself; for whether the Germans assumed us to  be unscrupulous Militarists or conscientious Democrats they were bound  to come to the same conclusion: namely, that we should attack them if  they attacked France; consequently their assumption that we would not  interfere must have been based on the belief that we are simply  \"contemptible,\" which is the sort of mistake people have to pay for in  this wicked world.    On the whole, we can hector our way in the Prussian manner out of that  discussion well enough, provided we hold our own in the field. But the  Prussian manner hardly satisfies the conscience. True, the fact that our  diplomatists were not able to discover the right course for Germany does  not excuse Germany for being unable to find it for herself. Not that it  was more her business than ours: it was a European question, and should  have been solved by the united counsels of all the ambassadors and  Foreign Offices and chanceries. Indeed it could not have been stably  solved without certain assurances from them. But it was, to say the  least, as much Germany's business as anyone else's, and terribly urgent  for her: \"a matter of life and death,\" the Imperial Chancellor thought.  Still, it is not for us to claim moral superiority to Germany. It was  for us a matter of the life and death of many Englishmen; and these  Englishmen are dead because our diplomatists were as blind as the  Prussians. The war is a failure for secret Junker diplomacy, ours no  less than the enemy's. Those of us who have still to die must be  inspired, not by devotion to the diplomatists, but, like the Socialist  hero of old on the barricade, by the vision of \"human solidarity.\" And  if he purchases victory for that holy cause with his blood, I submit  that we cannot decently allow the Foreign Office to hang up his martyr's  palm over the War Office Mantelpiece.      *The First Penalty of Disingenuousness.*    The Foreign Office, however, can at lease shift its ground, and declare  for the good cause instead of belittling it with quibbling excuses. For  see what the first effect of the nonsense about Belgium has been! It  carried with it the inevitable conclusion that when the last German was  cleared off Belgian soil, peace-loving England, her reluctant work in  this shocking war done, would calmly retire from the conflict, and leave  her Allies to finish the deal with Potsdam. Accordingly, after Mr.  Asquith's oration at the Mansion House, the Allies very properly  insisted on our signing a solemn treaty between the parties that they  must all stand together to the very end. A pitifully thin attempt has  been made to represent that the mistrusted party was France, and that  the Kaiser was trying to buy her off. All one can say to that is that  the people who believe that any French Government dare face the French  people now with anything less than Alsace and Lorraine as the price of  peace, or that an undefeated and indeed masterfully advancing German  Kaiser (as he seemed then) dare offer France such a price, would believe  anything. Of course we had to sign; but if the Prime Minister had not  been prevented by his own past from taking the popular line, we should  not have been suspected of a possible backing-out when the demands of  our sanctimoniousness were satisfied. He would have known that we are  not vindicating a treaty which by accident remains among the fragments  of treaties of Paris, of Prague, of Berlin, of all sorts of places and  dates, as the only European treaty that has hitherto escaped flat  violation: we are supporting the war as a war on war, on military  coercion, on domineering, on bullying, on brute force, on military law,  on caste insolence, on what Mrs. Fawcett called insensable deviltry  (only to find the papers explaining apologetically that she, as a lady,  had of course been alluding to war made by foreigners, not by England).  Some of us, remembering the things we have ourselves said and done, may  doubt whether Satan can cast out Satan; but as the job is not exactly  one for an unfallen angel, we may as well let him have a try.      *The Blank Cheque.*    In the meantime behold us again hopelessly outwitted by Eastern  diplomacy as a direct consequence of this ill-starred outburst of  hypocrisy about treaties! Everybody has said over and over again that  this war is the most tremendous war ever waged. Nobody has said that  this new treaty is the most tremendous blank cheque we have ever been  forced to sign by our Parliamentary party trick of striking moral  attitudes. It is true that Mr. J.A. Hobson realised the situation at  once, and was allowed to utter a little croak in a corner; but where was  the trumpet note of warning that should have rung throughout the whole  Press? Just consider what the blank cheque means. France's draft on it  may stop at the cost of recovering Alsace and Lorraine. We shall have to  be content with a few scraps of German colony and the heavy-weight  championship. But Russia? When will she say \"Hold! Enough!\" Suppose she  wants not only Poland, but Baltic Prussia? Suppose she wants  Constantinople as her port of access to the unfrozen seas, in addition  to the dismemberment of Austria? Suppose she has the brilliant idea of  annexing all Prussia, for which there is really something to be said by  ethnographical map-makers, Militarist madmen, and Pan-Slavist  megalomaniacs? It may be a reasonable order; but it is a large one; and  the fact that we should have been committed to it without the knowledge  of Parliament, without discussion, without warning, without any sort of  appeal to public opinion or democratic sanction, by a stroke of Sir  Edward Grey's pen within five weeks of his having committed us in the  same fashion to an appalling European war, shews how completely the  Foreign Office has thrown away all pretence of being any less absolute  than the Kaiser himself. It simply offers _carte blanche_ to the armies  of the Allies without a word to the nation until the cheque is signed.  The only limit there is to the obligation is the certainty that the  cheque will be dishonoured the moment the draft on it becomes too heavy.  And that may furnish a virtuous pretext for another war between the  Allies themselves. In any case no treaty can save each Ally from the  brute necessity of surrendering and paying up if beaten, whether the  defeat is shared by the others or not. Did I not say that the sooner we  made up our minds to the terms of the treaty of peace, so that we might  know what we were fighting for, and how far we were bound to go, the  better? Instead of which we sign a ridiculous \"scrap of paper\" to save  ourselves the intolerable fatigue of thought.      *Belgium Crucified Between the European Powers.*    And now, before I leave the subject of Belgium, what have we done for  Belgium? Have we saved her soil from invasion? Were we at her side with  half a million men when the avalanche fell on her? Or were we safe in  our own country praising her heroism in paragraphs which all contrived  to convey an idea that the Belgian soldier is about four feet high, but  immensely plucky for his size? Alas, when the Belgian soldier cried:  \"Where are the English?\" the reply was \"a mass of concrete as large as a  big room,\" blown into the air by a German siege gun, falling back and  crushing him into the earth we had not succeeded in saving from the  worst of the horrors of war. We have not protected Belgium: Belgium has  protected us at the cost of being conquered by Germany. It is now our  sacred duty to drive the Germans out of Belgium. Meanwhile we might at  least rescue her refugees by a generous grant of public money from the  caprices of private charity. We need not press our offer to lend her  money: German capitalists will do that for her with the greatest  pleasure when the war is over. I think the Government realizes that now;  for I note the after-thought that a loan from us need not bear interest.    Now that we begin to see where we really are, what practical morals can  we draw?      *Unpreparedness the Price of Secrecy.*    First, that our autocratic foreign policy, in which the Secretary for  Foreign Affairs is always a Junker, and makes war and concludes war  without consulting the nation, or confiding in it, or even refraining  from deceiving it as to his intentions, leads inevitably to a disastrous  combination of war and unpreparedness for war. Wars are planned which  require huge expeditionary armies trained and equipped for war. But as  such preparation could not be concealed from the public, it is simply  deferred until the war is actually declared and begun, at the most  frightful risk of such an annihilation of our little peace army as we  escaped by the skin of our teeth at Mons and Cambrai. The military  experts tell us that it takes four months to make an infantry and six to  make a cavalry soldier. And our way of getting an army able to fight the  German army is to declare war on Germany just as if we had such an army,  and then trust to the appalling resultant peril and disaster to drive us  into wholesale enlistment, voluntary or (better still from the Junker  point of view) compulsory. It seems to me that a nation which tolerates  such insensate methods and outrageous risks must shortly perish from  sheer lunacy. And it is all pure superstition: the retaining of the  methods of Edward the First in the reign of George the Fifth. I  therefore suggest that the first lesson of the war is that the Secretary  of State for Foreign Affairs be reduced to the level of a simple Prime  Minister, or even of a constitutional monarch, powerless to fire a  single shot or sign a treaty"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1364"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive; Or, Two Miles a Minute on the Rails (#10)"],[1,"see nothing up there at the bathroom window because  of the rain and the deep shadow, he knew that the snapping sound meant  the severing of the window lock that he had so recently closed. Some  instrument had been forced under the bottom of the lower sash and  pressure enough been brought to bear to break the thin steel lever.    On the heels of this sound came another. A muffled buzzing somewhere in  the house--again! again! And then, startlingly clear from the room over  the garage, the burglar alarm went off in Koku's chamber.    \"It's all off now!\" gasped Tom, and he ran to the foot of the  honeysuckle ladder up which he knew the enemy had climbed to get to the  roof of the porch. \"If he comes down I'll have him!\" muttered Tom,  staring up into the mist and gloom.    \"Fo' de lawsy's sake! 'Tain't mawnin', is it?\" Rad's sleepy voice was  heard to announce. \"No, it's da'k as--\" And the voice trailed off into  silence.    \"Tom! Tom!\" the young fellow heard his aroused father shouting.    Tom knew that his father was in no danger. In fact Mr. Swift's voice  did not even betray apprehension. It was to the garage Tom looked for  an explosion. But none came.    If Koku was up there the prolonged buzzing of the alarm did not awake  him. Therefore he could not be there. Tom realized that if the burglar  was to be taken the whole affair fell upon his shoulders.    \"And I've got my hands full, if it is the fellow with the big feet that  we saw on the Waterfield Road the other day,\" muttered the young  inventor.    Nothing stirred on the porch roof. Moment after moment slipped by. Tom  began to grow more than amazed. He was worried. What would happen next?    His father had not cried out again. Stepping around to the end of the  roofed porch, Tom saw a light in Mr. Swift's room. Rad had evidently  gone to sleep again. It would take more than an intermittent buzzer to  rouse fully that colored man.    \"When old Morpheus has a strangle hold on Rad, Gabriel's trump would  scarcely awaken him,\" Tom muttered.    What had become of the enemy? If it was an ordinary burglar he would  have feared the electric alarm instantly. The buzzers were still  working. But there was no sign of the man who had set them off at the  bathroom window.    Suddenly Tom heard a door slam. It was from the front of the house. Had  his father come downstairs to look around and see what the matter was?    The young fellow started around the house on a run. He heard heavy  bootsoles spurning the gravel of the path to the front gate. He arrived  at the far corner of the house in time to see a man dash through the  gateway and run down the street, disappearing finally into the  fast-driving rain.    \"Fooled me! He went in and right through and down the stairs!  Out the  front door!\" gasped Tom. \"Did he get anything? I wonder!\"    He sprang up to the front porch and tried the door. It was locked  again, of course. Should he ring the bell and get Rad or his father  down to the door?    And then, of a sudden, the principal mystery of all this affair bit  into Tom Swift's mind. The burglar had made his escape. He could  relieve his father's anxiety later. It was his own puzzlement of mind  that he first wished to ease.    Where was Koku?    Even had the giant been circling the stockade around the shops he  surely must have come up to the home premises by this time.  His keen  ears could not fail to hear the buzzers. They were still going and  would go until the switch was turned.    If the giant was in his room--Tom turned suddenly and started on a run  for the rear premises. He still carried the hand-lamp and it lit his  way into the garage door and up the narrow stairway. He shot the round  beam of the lamp into Koku's room.    He had been obliged to have an iron bedstead made to order for the  giant. It stood against one wall of the room. The buzzer was snarling  like a  huge bumblebee above the head of the couch.  Below it sprawled  the giant, eyes tightly closed and mouth slightly ajar. From the lips  of Koku were emitted sounds worthy of Rad Sampson in his deepest  slumbers!    \"Asleep?\" gasped Tom, stepping cat-like into the room.    And then he was suddenly aware of a sickish, heavy odor in the chamber.  The window had been closed. But it was something more than stale air  that Tom smelled.    A folded cloth lay on the floor beside the couch. The young fellow saw  at once that it had been originally placed over the giant's face, but  had slid off. And lucky for Koku that it had been dislodged!    \"Chloroform!\" muttered Tom. \"He's drugged. It is no wonder he did not  hear the burglar alarm.\"    In any event, the incident made one deep impression on Tom's mind. The  spies who he believed were working for the Hendrickton & Western  Railroad and its owner, Montagne Lewis, were desperate men. Tom could  not believe that the fellow with the big feet was alone in Shopton and  was unaided in his attempts to find out what Tom was doing.    This attempt to burglarize the house betrayed the caliber of the enemy.  In chloroforming Koku he had taken the risk of murdering the giant.  Only the fact that the pad of saturated cloth had fallen off Koku's  face had, perhaps, saved the man from suffocation.    Tom did not tell the giant when he aroused what the matter with him  was. Koku was ill enough! He was wrenched by interior spasms that  seemed almost to tear his huge body to pieces.    \"What done got into dat big lump o' bone an' grizzle?\" demanded  Eradicate. \"He looks like, he swallowed a volcano, and it just got to  wo'kin' right. My lawsy!\"    \"He is a sick man, all right,\" admitted Tom. \"Looks like he wouldn't  try to stab me to deaf wid no spear no mo',\" went on Rad, inclined to  approve of Koku's sufferings.    \"If he died you'd be mighty sorry, old man,\" declared Tom, sternly.    \"Sho' would. Be a mighty hard job to bury him,\" was the callous  response.    Just the same, the crotchety old colored man began to hop around in  lively fashion with hot water, and later with coffee and other  stimulants; and he nursed Koku all day as though he were a big baby.    Koku, who had never been ill before in his life, was inclined to lay  the trouble to an evil genius of some kind. Perhaps, in spite of his  half-civilized state, he was still a devil-worshiper.  At any rate, he  had a vital respect for the forces of evil.    Naturally he considered this unknown and unexpected misery he suffered  the result of malignant influences of some kind. Tom did not want him  to suspect that the man with the big feet had any possible part in the  mystery. Had Koku suspected this, and had he got his hands on the spy,  the latter could never have been successfully used in that sort of work  again. In all probability he would have said that he had had enough.    Meanwhile Tom made a point of considering each step he took alone  thereafter with particular care. He had a bodyguard--usually the giant  after the latter had recovered--between the works and the house. He did  not bring home any more the schedules or drawings connected with the  electric locomotive that he proposed to have built and to test inside  the stockade of the Swift Construction Company.    He even put a private detective to work on the matter of finding a man  named Andy O'Malley who might be lurking around Shopton. He had a  pretty clear description of the fellow, for he had not only seen him  once, face to face by daylight, but Tom had written to the president of  the H. & P. A. and had got from that gentleman a clear picture in words  of the spy whom Mr. Bartholomew believed was working in the interests  of Montagne Lewis.    \"If O'Malley appears in Shopton, look out. He is a bad character. He is  not only a notorious gunman, with several warrants out for him in these  parts, but he is a cruel and desperate man in any event. The minute you  mark him, have him arrested and telegraph me. We'll get him extradited  and put him through for ten years or more right in this county.\" The  private investigator, however, as the weeks went by, could not find any  man who filled O'Malley's description.    Meanwhile Tom Swift had got what he called \"a lead\" and was working day  and night upon the invention that he believed might make even the  Jandel people respectful, if not a bit envious.    First of all Tom had arranged to have built all around inside the  stockade a track of rails heavy enough to stand the wear and tear of  the heaviest locomotive built. Meanwhile the various parts of his  locomotive were being built in several shops, but would be shipped to  the Swift Construction Company and assembled in Tom's try-out shed.    Great secrecy was of course maintained. Aside from the fact that the  new invention had something to do with electric motive power, nobody  about the shops could say what the new industry portended. Save, of  course, the Swifts themselves, Ned Newton, and Mr. Damon, who was the  Swifts' closest friend and sometimes had furnished additional capital  for Tom's experiments.    There was a thing that Mr. Damon furnished Tom at this time that proved  in the end to be of much importance. Before Tom had seized upon this  idea of his eccentric friend, and had made proper use of it, something  happened that came near to wrecking utterly Tom's invention and  completely putting an end to Tom himself as an inventor.          Chapter X    A Strange Conversation      Mr. Wakefield Damon frequently came to the shops, for he was not alone  very friendly with the Swifts, but he was greatly interested in Tom's  new invention.    \"If it goes as good as what you did for my chicken run,\" he declared,  chuckling, \"bless my dampers! you'll beat all the electric locomotives  in the market.\"    \"That is easy, perhaps,\" said Tom smiling. \"There are not many in the  market at the present time. But I don't know what mine will be. This is  going to be some job.\"    \"Bless my flues and clinkers!\" cried Mr. Damon, \"you "]]]
