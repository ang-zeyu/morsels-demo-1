[PRICE 2d.               *       *       *       *       *          HADLEY CHURCH.    [Illustration]      Hadley, Mankin, or Monkton, Hadley, was formerly a hamlet to Edmonton.  It lies north-west of Enfield, and comprises 580 acres, including 240  allotted in lieu of the common enclosure of Enfield Chase. Its name is  compounded of two Saxon words--Head-leagh, or a high place; Mankin is  probably derived from the connexion of the place with the abbey of  Walden, to which it was given by Geoffrey de Mandeville, earl of Essex,  under the name of the Hermitage of Hadley. The village is situated on  the east side of the great north road, eleven miles from London.    The manor belonged to the Mandevilles, the founder of the Hermitage, and  was given by Geoffrey to the monks of Walden; in the ensuing two  centuries the manorial property underwent various transmissions, and was  purchased by the Pinney family, in the year 1791, by the present  proprietor, Peter Moore, Esq.    The house of the late David Garrow, father to the present judge of that  name in the court of exchequer, is supposed to have been connected with  a monastic establishment. Chimney-pieces remain in _alto-relievo_: on  one is sculptured the story of Sampson; the other represents many  passages in the life of our Saviour, from his birth in the stall to his  death on the cross.    The parish church, of which our engraving gives a correct view, is a  handsome structure, built at different periods. The chancel bears marks  of great antiquity, but the body has been built with bricks. At the west  end is a square tower, composed of flint, with quoins of freestone; on  one side is the date Anno Domini 1393, cut in stone--one side of the  stone bearing date in the sculptured device of a wing; the other that of  a rose. The figures denote the year 1494; the last, like the second  numerical, being the _half eight_, often used in ancient inscriptions.  The unique vestige of the middle ages, namely, a firepan, or pitchpot,  on the south-west tower of the church, was blown down in January, 1779  and carefully repaired, though now not required for the purpose of  giving an alarm at the approach of a foe, by lighting pitch within it.  The church has been supposed to have been erected by Edward IV. as a  chapel for religious service, to the memory of those who fell in the  battle of Barnet in 1471.    On the window of the north transcept are some remains of painted glass,  among which may be noticed the rebus of the Gooders, a family of  considerable consequence at Hadley in the fifteenth and sixteenth  centuries. This consists of a partridge with an ear of wheat in its  bill; on an annexed scroll is the word Gooder; on the capital of one of  the pillars are two partridges with ears of corn in the mouth, an  evident repetition of the same punning device, and it is probable the  Gooder's were considerable benefactors towards building the church.    The almshouses for six decayed housekeepers were founded by Sir Roger  Willbraham in 1616, but so slenderly endowed that they do not produce  more than 9l.6s. annually. Major Delafonte, in 1762, increased the  annuity, which expired in 1805; but Mr. Cottrell gained by subscription  2375l. in trust. The father of the late Mr. Whitbread, the statesman,  subscribed the sum of 1000l. for the support of the almshouses. The  charity-school for girls was established in 1773, and was enlarged and  converted into a school of industry in 1800. Twenty girls in the  establishment receive annually the sum of 1l. towards clothing; thirty  girls besides the above are admitted to the benefit of education, on  paying the weekly sum of 2d. and succeed to the vacancies which occur in  the class more largely assisted. This charity is in like manner  supported by contributions on the inhabitants. The boys' school,  supported in the same way, which in 1804 amounted to the sum of 103l.  10s., has about seventy day-scholars; twenty are allowed 1l. towards  clothing, and instructed without any charge; the remainder pay  2d. weekly.           *       *       *       *       *        THE SKETCH BOOK.    NO. XLIII.           *       *       *       *       *      THE BUTCHER.      Wolsey, they tell us, was a butcher. An alliterative couplet too was  made upon him to that import:--        \"By butchers born, by bishops bred,      How high his honour holds his haughty head.\"    Notwithstanding which, however, and other similar allusions, there have  arisen many disputes touching the veracity of the assertion; yet,  doubtless, those who first promulgated the idea, were keen observers of  men and manners; and, probably, in the critical examination of the  Cardinal's character, discovered a particular trait which indubitably  satisfied them of his origin.    Be this as it may, I am inclined to think there is certainly something  peculiarly characteristic in the butcher.    The pursuit of his calling appears to have an influence upon his  manners, speech, and dress. Of all the days in the week, Saturday is the  choicest for seeing him to the best advantage. His hatless head, shining  with grease, his cheeks as ruddy as his mutton-chops, his sky-blue frock  and dark-blue apron, his dangling steel and sharp-set knife, which ever  and anon play an accompaniment to his quick, short--\"Buy! buy!\" are all  in good keeping with the surrounding objects. And although this be not  _killing_ day with him, he is particularly winning and gracious with the  serving-maids; who (whirling the large street-door key about their right  thumb, and swinging their marketing basket in their left hand) view the  well-displayed joints, undecided which to select, until Mr. Butcher  recommends a leg or a loin; and then he so very politely cuts off the  fat, in which his skilful hand is guided by the high or low price of  mutton fat in the market. He is the very antipode of a fop, yet no man  knows how to show a handsome _leg_ off to better advantage, or is  prouder of his _calves_.    In his noviciate, when he shoulders the shallow tray, and whistles  cavalierly on his way in his sausage-meat-complexioned-jacket, there is  something marked as well in his character as his _habits_, he is never  _moved_ to stay, except by a brother butcher, or a fight of dogs or  boys, for such scenes fit his singular fancy. Then, in the discussion of  his bull-dog's beauties, he becomes extraordinarily eloquent. Hatiz, the  Persian, could not more warmly, or with choicer figure, describe his  mistress' charms, than he does Lion's, or Fowler's, or whatever the  brute's Christian name may be; and yet the surly, cynical, _dogged_  expression of the bepraised beast, would almost make one imagine he  understood the meaning of his master's words, and that his honest nature  despised the flattering encomiums he passes upon his pink belly and  legs, his broad chest, his ring-tail, and his tulip ears!--_Absurdities,  in Prose and Verse._           *       *       *       *       *      CONFIDENCE AND CREDIT.    (_For the Mirror._)          The day was dark, the markets dull,      The Change was thin, Gazettes were full,        And half the town was breaking;      The _counter-sign_ of Cash was \"_Stop_!\"      Bankers and bankrupts shut up shop,        And honest hearts were aching.        When near the Bench my fancy spied      A faded form, with hasty stride,        Beneath Grief's burden stooping:      Her name was CREDIT, and she said      Her father, TRADE, was lately dead,        Her mother, COMMERCE, drooping.        The smile that she was wont to wear      Was wither'd by the hand of care,        Her eyes had lost their lustre:      Her character was gone, she said,      For she had basely been betray'd,        And nobody would trust her.        For honest INDUSTRY had tried      To gain fair CREDIT for his bride,        And found the damsel willing,      But, ah! a _fortune-hunter_ came,      And SPECULATION was his name,        A rake not worth a shilling.        The villain came, on mischief bent,      And soon gain'd dad and mam's consent--        Ah! then poor CREDIT smarted;--      He filch'd her fortune and her fame,      He fix'd a blot upon her name,        And left her broken-hearted.        While thus poor CREDIT seem'd to sigh,      Her cousin, CONFIDENCE, came by--        (Methinks he must be clever)--      For, when he whisper'd in her ear,      She check'd the sigh, she dried the tear.        And smiled as sweet as ever!    JESSE HAMMOND.           *       *       *       *       *      CURIOUS SCRAPS RELATING TO CELEBRATED PERSONS.    (_For the Mirror._)      When the famous Cornelia, daughter of the great Scipio, was importuned  by a lady of her acquaintance to show her toilette, she deferred  satisfying her curiosity till her children, who were the famous Gracchi,  came from school, and then said, \"_En! haec ornamenta mea  sunt._\"--\"These are my ornaments.\"    Cyneas, the minister of Pyrrhus, asked the king (before their expedition  into Italy) what he proposed to do when he had subdued the Romans? He  answered, \"Pass into Sicily.\" \"What then?\" said the minister. \"Conquer  the Carthaginians,\" replied the king. \"And what follows that?\" says the  minister. \"Be sovereign of Greece, and then enjoy ourselves,\" said the  king. \"And why,\" replied the sensible minister, \"can we not do this  _last_ now?\"    The emperors Nerva, Trajan, Antoninous, and Aurelius sold their palaces,  their gold and silver plate, their valuable furniture, and other  superfluities, heaped up by their predecessors, and banished from their  tables all expensive delicacies. These princes, together with Vespasian,  Pertinax, Alexander, Severus, Claudius the Second, and Tacitus, who were  raised to the empire by their merit, and whom all ages have admired as  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9925"],[0,"Black Jack (#1)"],[1,"JACK    Max Brand    1922                CHAPTER 1      It was characteristic of the two that when the uproar broke out Vance  Cornish raised his eyes, but went on lighting his pipe. Then his sister  Elizabeth ran to the window with a swish of skirts around her long legs.  After the first shot there was a lull. The little cattle town was as  peaceful as ever with its storm-shaken houses staggering away down the  street.    A boy was stirring up the dust of the street, enjoying its heat with his  bare toes, and the same old man was bunched in his chair in front of the  store. During the two days Elizabeth had been in town on her cattle-  buying trip, she had never see him alter his position. But she was  accustomed to the West, and this advent of sleep in the town did not  satisfy her. A drowsy town, like a drowsy-looking cow-puncher, might be  capable of unexpected things.    \"Vance,\" she said, \"there's trouble starting.\"    \"Somebody shooting at a target,\" he answered.    As if to mock him, he had no sooner spoken than a dozen voices yelled  down the street in a wailing chorus cut short by the rapid chattering of  revolvers. Vance ran to the window. Just below the hotel the street made  an elbow-turn for no particular reason except that the original cattle-  trail had made exactly the same turn before Garrison City was built.  Toward the corner ran the hubbub at the pace of a running horse. Shouts,  shrill, trailing curses, and the muffled beat of hoofs in the dust. A  rider plunged into view now, his horse leaning far in to take the sharp  angle, and the dust skidding out and away from his sliding hoofs. The  rider gave easily and gracefully to the wrench of his mount.    And he seemed to have a perfect trust in his horse, for he rode with the  reins hanging over the horns of his saddle. His hands were occupied by a  pair of revolvers, and he was turned in the saddle.    The head of the pursuing crowd lurched around the elbow-turn; fire spat  twice from the mouth of each gun. Two men dropped, one rolling over and  over in the dust, and the other sitting down and clasping his leg in a  ludicrous fashion. But the crowd was checked and fell back.    By this time the racing horse of the fugitive had carried him close to  the hotel, and now he faced the front, a handsome fellow with long black  hair blowing about his face. He wore a black silk shirt which accentuated  the pallor of his face and the flaring crimson of his bandanna. And he  laughed joyously, and the watchers from the hotel window heard him call:  \"Go it, Mary. Feed 'em dust, girl!\"    The pursuers had apparently realized that it was useless to chase.  Another gust of revolver shots barked from the turning of the street, and  among them a different and more sinister sound like the striking of two  great hammers face on face, so that there was a cold ring of metal after  the explosion--at least one man had brought a rifle to bear. Now, as the  wild rider darted past the hotel, his hat was jerked from his head by an  invisible hand. He whirled again in the saddle and his guns raised. As he  turned, Elizabeth Cornish saw something glint across the street. It was  the gleam of light on the barrel of a rifle that was thrust out through  the window of the store.    That long line of light wobbled, steadied, and fire jetted from the mouth  of the gun. The black-haired rider spilled sidewise out of the saddle;  his feet came clear of the stirrups, and his right leg caught on the  cantle. He was flung rolling in the dust, his arms flying weirdly. The  rifle disappeared from the window and a boy's set face looked out. But  before the limp body of the fugitive had stopped rolling, Elizabeth  Cornish dropped into a chair, sick of face. Her brother turned his back  on the mob that closed over the dead man and looked at Elizabeth in  alarm.    It was not the first time he had seen the result of a gunplay, and for  that matter it was not the first time for Elizabeth. Her emotion upset  him more than the roar of a hundred guns. He managed to bring her a glass  of water, but she brushed it away so that half of the contents spilled on  the red carpet of the room.    \"He isn't dead, Vance. He isn't dead!\" she kept saying.    \"Dead before he left the saddle,\" replied Vance, with his usual calm.  \"And if the bullet hadn't finished him, the fall would have broken his  neck. But--what in the world! Did you know the fellow?\"    He blinked at her, his amazement growing. The capable hands of Elizabeth  were pressed to her breast, and out of the thirty-five years of  spinsterhood which had starved her face he became aware of eyes young and  dark, and full of spirit; by no means the keen, quiet eyes of Elizabeth  Cornish.    \"Do something,\" she cried. \"Go down, and--if they've murdered him--\"    He literally fled from the room.    All the time she was seeing nothing, but she would never forget what she  had seen, no matter how long she lived. Subconsciously she was fighting  to keep the street voices out of her mind. They were saying things she  did not wish to hear, things she would not hear. Finally, she recovered  enough to stand up and shut the window. That brought her a terrible  temptation to look down into the mass of men in the street--and women,  too!    But she resisted and looked up. The forms of the street remained  obscurely in the bottom of her vision, and made her think of something  she had seen in the woods--a colony of ants around a dead beetle.  Presently the door opened and Vance came back. He still seemed very  worried, but she forced herself to smile at him, and at once his concern  disappeared; it was plain that he had been troubled about her and not in  the slightest by the fate of the strange rider. She kept on smiling, but  for the first time in her life she really looked at Vance without  sisterly prejudice in his favor. She saw a good-natured face, handsome,  with the cheeks growing a bit blocky, though Vance was only twenty-five.  He had a glorious forehead and fine eyes, but one would never look twice  at Vance in a crowd. She knew suddenly that her brother was simply a  well-mannered mediocrity.    \"Thank the Lord you're yourself again, Elizabeth,\" her brother said first  of all. \"I thought for a moment--I don't know what!\"    \"Just the shock, Vance,\" she said. Ordinarily she was well-nigh brutally  frank. Now she found it easy to lie and keep on smiling. \"It was such a  horrible thing to see!\"    \"I suppose so. Caught you off balance. But I never knew you to lose your  grip so easily. Well, do you know what you've seen?\"    \"He's dead, then?\"    He locked sharply at her. It seemed to him that a tremor of unevenness  had come into her voice.    \"Oh, dead as a doornail, Elizabeth. Very neat shot. Youngster that  dropped him; boy named Joe Minter. Six thousand dollars for Joe. Nice  little nest egg to build a fortune on, eh?\"    \"Six thousand dollars! What do you mean, Vance?\"    \"The price on the head of Jack Hollis. That was Hollis, sis. The  celebrated Black Jack.\"    \"But--this is only a boy, Vance. He couldn't have been more than twenty-  five years old.\"    \"That's all.\"    \"But I've heard of him for ten years, very nearly. And always as a man-  killer. It can't be Black Jack.\"    \"I said the same thing, but it's Black Jack, well enough. He started out  when he was sixteen, they say, and he's been raising the devil ever  since. You should have seen them pick him up--as if he were asleep, and  not dead. What a body! Lithe as a panther. No larger than I am, but they  say he was a giant with his hands.\"    He was lighting his cigarette as he said this, and consequently he did  not see her eyes close tightly. A moment later she was able to make her  expression as calm as ever.    \"Came into town to see his baby,\" went on Vance through the smoke.  \"Little year-old beggar!\"    \"Think of the mother,\" murmured Elizabeth Cornish. \"I want to do  something for her.\"    \"You can't,\" replied her brother, with unnecessary brutality. \"Because  she's dead. A little after the youngster was born. I believe Black Jack  broke her heart, and a very pleasant sort of girl she was, they tell me.\"    \"What will become of the baby?\"    \"It will live and grow up,\" he said carelessly. \"They always do, somehow.  Make another like his father, I suppose. A few years of fame in the  mountain saloons, and then a knife in the back.\"    The meager body of Elizabeth stiffened. She was finding it less easy to  maintain her nonchalant smile.    \"Why?\"    \"Why? Blood will out, like murder, sis.\"    \"Nonsense! All a matter of environment.\"    \"Have you ever read the story of the Jukes family?\"    \"An accident. Take a son out of the best family in the world and raise  him like a thief--he'll be a thief. And the thief's son can be raised to  an honest manhood. I know it!\"    She was seeing Black Jack, as he had raced down the street with the black  hair blowing about his face. Of such stuff, she felt, the knights of  another age had been made. Vance was raising a forefinger in an  authoritative way he had.    \"My dear, before that baby is twenty-five--that was his father's  age--he'll have shot a man. Bet you on it!\"    \"I'll take your bet!\"    The retort came with such a ring of her voice that he was startled.  Before he could recover, she went on: \"Go out and get that baby for me,  Vance. I want it.\"    He tossed his cigarette out of the window.    \"Don't drop into one of your headstrong moods, sis. This is nonsense.\"    \"That's why I want to do it. I'm tired of playing the man. I've had  enough to fill my mind. I want something to fill my arms and my heart.\"    She drew up her hands with a peculiar gesture toward her shallow, barren  bosom, and then her brother found himself silenced. At the same time he  was a little irritated, for there was an imputation in her speech that  she had been carrying the burden which his own shoulders should have  supported. Which was so true "]]]
