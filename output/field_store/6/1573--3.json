All I have  got to say is that I have never shown myself anything else. My heart  is with them. What is bureaucracy to me? It is a great machine in  India, yes a splendid machine, for performing the most difficult task  that ever was committed to the charge of any nation. But show me where  it fails--that it is perfect in every respect no sensible man would  contend for a moment--but show me at any point, let any of my hon.  friends show me from day to day as this session passes, where this  bureaucracy, as they call it, has been at fault. Do they suppose it  possible that I will not show my recognition of that failure, and  do all that I can to remedy it? Although the Government of India is  complicated and intricate, they cannot suppose that I shall fail for  one moment in doing all in my power to demonstrate that we are moved  by a kindly, a sympathetic, a friendly, an energetic, and what I  will call a governing spirit, in the highest form and sense of that  sovereign and inspiring word.        IV      INDIAN CIVIL SERVICE    (LONDON. JULY 1908)    GENTLEMEN,--I have first of all to thank you for what I understand is  a rare honour--and an honour it assuredly is--of being invited to  be your guest to-night. The position of a Secretary of State in the  presence of the Indian Civil Service is not an entirely simple one.  You, Gentlemen, who are still in the Service, and the veterans I see  around me who have been in that great Service, naturally and properly  look first of all, and almost altogether, upon India. A Secretary of  State has to look also upon Great Britain and upon Parliament--and  that is not always a perfectly easy situation to adjust. I forget who  it was that said about the rulers of India in India:--\"It is no easy  thing for a man to keep his watch in two longitudes at once at the  same time.\" That is the case of the Secretary of State. It is not  the business of the Secretary of State to look exclusively at India,  though I will confess to you for myself that during the moderately  short time I have held my present office, I have kept my eye upon  India constantly, steadfastly, and with every desire to learn the  whole truth upon every situation as it arose.    But there must be a thorough comprehension in the mind of the  Secretary of State of two things--first of all, of the Indian point of  view; and, secondly, the point of view as it appears to those who are  the masters of me and of you. Do not forget that adjustment has to be  made. It would be impertinent of me to pay compliments to the Civil  Service, to whom I propose this toast--\"The Health of the Indian  Civil Service.\" You might think for a moment, that it was an amateur  proposing prosperity and success to experts. I have had in my days a  good deal to do with experts of one kind and another, and I assure  you that I do not think an expert is at all the worse when he gets a  candid-minded and reasonably well trained amateur.    Now, this year is a memorable anniversary. It is fifty years within a  month or two, since the Crown took over the Government of India from  the old East India Company. Whether that was a good move or a bad  move, it would not become me to discuss. The move was made. (A voice,  \"It was a good move.\") My veteran friend says that it was a good move.  I hope so. But at the end of fifty years we are at rather a critical  moment. I read in _The Times_ the other day that the present Viceroy  and Secretary of State had to deal with conditions such as the British  in India never before were called upon to face. (A voice, \"That is  so.\") Now, many of you sitting around me at this table are far better  able to test the weight of that statement, than I can pretend to be.  Is it true that at the end of fifty years since the transfer to the  Crown, we have to deal with conditions such as the British in India  never before were called upon to face? (\"Yes.\") I cannot undertake to  measure that; but what is clear is that decidedly heavy clouds have  suddenly risen in our horizon, and are darkly sailing over our Indian  skies. That cannot be denied. But, gentlemen, having paid the utmost  attention that a man can in office, with access to all the papers, and  seeing all the observers he is able to see, I do not feel for a moment  that this discovery of a secret society or a secret organisation  involves any question of an earthquake. I prefer to look upon it, to  revert to my own figure, as clouds sailing through the sky. I do not  say you will not have to take pretty strong measures of one sort and  another. Yes, but strong measures in the right direction, and with the  right qualifications. I think any man who lays down a firm proposition  that all is well, or any man who says that all is ill--either of those  two men is probably wrong. Now this room is filled, and genially  filled, with men who have had enormous experience, vast and wide  experience, and, not merely passive experience, but that splendid  active experience which is the real training and education of men  in responsibility. This room is full of gentlemen with these  qualifications. And I will venture to say that the theories and  explanations that could be heard in the palace of truth from all of  you gentlemen here, would be countless in their differences. I hear  explanations of the present state of things all day long. I like to  hear them. You think it may become monotonous. No: not at all; because  there is so much, I will not say of random variety, but there is so  much independent use of mind upon the facts that we have to deal with,  that I listen with endless edification and instruction. But, I think,  and I wish I could think otherwise with all my heart--that to sum up  all these theories and explanations of the state of things with which  we have to deal, you can hardly resist a painful impression that there  is now astir in some quarters a certain estrangement and alienation of  races. (\"No no.\") Gentlemen, bear with me patiently. It is our share  in the Asiatic question.      A DIFFICULT PROBLEM.    I am trying to feel my way through the most difficult problem, the  most difficult situation that a responsible Government can have to  face. Of course, I am dependent upon information. But as I read it,  as I listen to serious Indian experts with large experience, it all  sounds estrangement and alienation even though it be no worse than  superficial. Now that is the problem that we have to deal with.  Gentlemen, I should very badly repay your kindness in asking me to  come among you to-night, if I were to attempt for a minute to analyse  or to prove all the conditions that have led to this state of things.  It would need hours and days. This is not, I think, the occasion, nor  the moment. Our first duty--the first duty of any Government--is to  keep order. But just remember this. It would be idle to deny, and I am  not sure that any of you gentlemen would deny, that there is at this  moment, and there has been for some little time past, and very likely  there will be for some time to come, a living movement in the mind of  the peoples for whom you are responsible. A living movement, and a  movement for what? A movement for objects which we ourselves have all  taught them to think desirable objects. And unless we somehow or other  can reconcile order with satisfaction of those ideas and aspirations,  gentlemen, the fault will not be theirs. It will be ours. It will mark  the breakdown of what has never yet broken down in any part of the  world--the breakdown of British statesmanship. That is what it will  do. Now I do not believe anybody--either in this room or out of this  room--believes that we can now enter upon an era of pure repression.  You cannot enter at this date and with English public opinion, mind  you, watching you, upon an era of pure repression, and I do not  believe really that anybody desires any such thing. I do not believe  so. Gentlemen, we have seen attempts, in the lifetime of some of us  here to-night, attempts in Continental Europe, to govern by pure  repression. Has one of them really succeeded? They have all failed.  There may be now and again a spurious semblance of success, but in  truth they have all failed. Whether we with our enormous power and  resolution should fail, I do not know. But I do not believe anybody  in this room representing so powerfully as you do dominant sentiments  that are not always felt in England--that in this room there is  anybody who is for an era of pure repression. Gentlemen, I would just  digress for a moment if I am not tiring you. (\"Go on,\") About the same  time as the transfer, about fifty years ago, of the Government of  India from the old East India Company to the Crown, another very  important step was taken, a step which I have often thought since  I have been concerned with the Government of India was far more  momentous, one almost deeper than the transfer to the Crown. And what  do you think that was? That was the first establishment--I think I  am right in my date--of Universities. We in this country are so  accustomed to look upon political changes as the only important  changes, that we very often forget such a change as the establishment  of Universities. And if any of you are inclined to prophesy, I should  like to read to you something that was written by that great and  famous man, Lord Macaulay, in the year 1836, long before the  Universities were thought of. What did he say? What a warning it is,  gentlemen. He wrote, in the year 1836:--\"At the single town of Hooghly  1,400 boys are learning English. The effect of this education on the  Hindus is prodigious.... It "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10985"],[0,"The Infant System (#10)"],[1,"believed, were not  above ten years of age. Previously to this they had been convicted of  felony, and had suffered six months imprisonment at Bodmin; and it  appears that two years before, they started alone from Bristol on this  circuit of youthful depredation.    Having collected the foregoing instances of juvenile delinquency, and  presented them to the public, I cannot refrain from adducing a few  other cases which came under my own observation.    Whilst conducting the Spitalfields' Infant School, several instances  of dishonesty in the children occurred. On one occasion the mother  herself came to complain of a little boy, not more than four years  old, on the following grounds. She stated, that being obliged to  be out at work all day, as well as her husband, she was under the  necessity of leaving the children by themselves. She had three besides  the little boy of whom she was complaining. Having to pay her rent,  she put eighteen-pence for that purpose in a cup at the top of a  cupboard. On stepping home to give the children their dinners, she  found the boy at the cupboard, mounted on a chair, which again was  placed on the top of a table. On looking for the money, she found  four-pence already gone; one penny of this she found in his pocket,  the rest he had divided amongst the other children, that they might  not tell of him. After this relation I kept a strict watch on the  child, and three or four days afterwards the children detected him  opening my desk, and taking half-pence out of it. They informed me of  this, and while they were bringing him up to me the half-pence dropped  out of his hand. I detected him in many other very bad actions, but  have reason to hope, that, by suitable discipline and instruction, he  was effectually cured of his sad propensities.    About the same time, I observed two little children very near the  school-house in close conversation, and from their frequently looking  at a fruit-stall that was near, I felt inclined to watch them; having  previously heard from some of the pupils, that they had frequently  seen children in the neighbourhood steal oysters and other things. I  accordingly placed myself in a convenient situation, and had not long  to wait, for the moment they saw there was no one passing, they went  up to the stall, the eldest walking alongside the other, apparently to  prevent his being seen, whilst the little one snatched an orange,  and conveyed it under his pinafore, with all the dexterity of an  experienced thief. The youngest of these children was not four years  old, and the eldest, apparently, not above five. There was reason to  believe this was not the first time they had been guilty of stealing,  though, perhaps, unknown to their parents, as I have found to be the  case in other instances.    Another little boy in the school, whose mother kept a little shop,  frequently brought money with him,--as much as three-pence at a time.  On questioning the child how he came by it, he always said that his  mother gave it to him, and I thought there was no reason to doubt his  word, for there was something so prepossessing in his appearance,  that, at the time, I could not doubt the truth of his story. But  finding that the child spent a great deal of money in fruit, cakes,  &c., and still had some remaining, I found it advisable to see the  mother, and to my astonishment found it all a fiction, for she had not  given him any, and we were both at a loss to conceive how he obtained  it. The child told _me_ his mother gave it to him; and he told  his _mother_ that it was given to him at school; but when he was  confronted with us both, not a word would he say. It was evident,  therefore, that he had obtained it by some unfair means, and we both  determined to suspend our judgment, and to keep a strict eye on him in  future. Nothing, however, transpired for some time;--I followed him  home several times, but saw nothing amiss. At length I received notice  from the mother, that she had detected taking money out of the till,  in her little shop. It then came out that there was some boy in the  neighbourhood who acted as banker to him, and for every two pence  which he received, he was allowed one penny for taking care of it. It  seems that the child was afraid to bring any more money to school, on  account of being so closely questioned as to where he obtained it, and  this, probably, induced him to give more to the boy than he otherwise  would have done. Suffice it, however, to say, that both children  at length were found out, and the mother declared that the child  conducted her to some old boards in the wash-house, and underneath  them there was upwards of a shilling, which he had pilfered at various  times.    The reader may remember too, that during the autumn of 1833, a boy of  _fourteen committed suicide_, and that another of the same age was  convicted of the dreadful crime of _murder_.    It appears he knew a boy a little younger than himself, who was going  to a distance with some money, and having taken a pocket-knife with  him, he way-laid him and threatened to murder him. The poor little  victim kneeled down,--offered him his money, his knife, and all he  had, and said he would love him all the days of his life if he would  spare him, and never tell what had happened; but the pathetic and  forcible appeal, which would have melted many a ruffian-heart, was  vain:--the little monster stabbed him in the throat, and then robbed  him. On his trial he discovered no feeling, and he even heard his  sentence with the utmost indifference, and without a tear.    It would have been easy to multiply cases of juvenile delinquency,  both those which have been brought under the cognizance of the law,  and those which have come to my own knowledge, but I think enough has  been related to shew how early children may, and do become depraved.  I have purposely given most of them with as few remarks of my own as  possible, that they may plead their own cause with the reader, and  excite a desire in his bosom to enter with me, in the next chapter, on  an inquiry into the causes of such early depravity.    Since the above incidents and facts were observed, and reports from  the public prints were recorded, general attention has been drawn more  fully to the very great increase of ignorance, demoralization, and  crime, amongst the lower classes, both old and young. These things  call on us most loudly for active effort and exertion; and it becomes  the patriot and philanthropist, but especially the Christian, to look  around, to think and to consider what effectual means may be found,  and what efficient plans may be adopted to strike the evil fatally at  its roots, and cause it to wither away. If these things be not done,  the moral pestilence must increase, and eventually deprive us of all  that is dear to us as men, and citizens.          CHAPTER III.    CAUSES OF EARLY CRIME.    _Degraded condition of parents--Dreadful effects of  drunkenness--Neglect of children inevitable and wilful--The tutorship  of wicked companions--Tricks of pantomimes injurious--Mischiefs  arising from sending children to pawnbrokers--Fairs demoralizing--All  Kinds of begging to be repressed_.           *       *       *       *       *      \"Why thus surprised to see the infant race    Treading the paths of vice? Their eyes can trace    Their _parents_' footsteps in the way they go:    What shame, what fear, then, can their young hearts know?\"           *       *       *       *       *      Appalling as the _effects_ of juvenile delinquency are, I think we may  discover a principal cause of them in the present condition and habits  of the adult part of the labouring classes. We shall find, very  frequently, that infant crime is the only natural produce of evil,  by the infallible means of precept and example. I do not intend to  assert, that the majority of parents amongst the poor, actually  encourage their children in the commission of theft; we may, indeed,  fear that some do; as in the instance of the two little girls detected  in shop-lifting, whose case was detailed in the preceding chapter; but  still, I should hope that such facts are not frequent. If, however,  they do not give them positive encouragement in pilfering, the example  they set is often calculated to deprave the heart of the child, and,  amongst other evil consequences, to induce dishonesty; whilst in other  cases we find, that from peculiar circumstances the child is deprived,  during the whole day, of the controling presence of a parent, and is  exposed to all the poisonous contamination which the streets of large  cities afford; and hence appears another cause of evil. Here children  come in contact with maturer vice, and are often drawn by its  influence from the paths of innocence; as we have already seen in  many instances. What resistance can the infant make to the insidious  serpents, which thus, as it, were, steal into its cradle, and infuse  their poison into its soul? The guardians of its helplessness are  heedless or unconscious of its danger, and, alas! it has not the  fabled strength of the infant Hercules to crush its venomous  assailants. Surely such a view of the frequent origin of crime must  awaken our commiseration for its miserable victims, and excite in us a  desire to become the defenders of the unprotected.    It will, however, be said by some, \"Where are the natural guardians of  the child? Where are its parents? Are we to encourage their neglect  of duty, by becoming their substitutes? It is their business to look  after their children, and not ours.\" Frequently have I heard such  sentiments put forth, and sometimes by persons in whom I knew they  were rather owing to a want of reflection than of philanthropy. But a  want of thought, or of feeling, it must certainly be; because, on no  principle of reason or humanity can we make the unnatural conduct  of fathers and mothers, a plea "]]]
