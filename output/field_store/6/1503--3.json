HOW THE BLACK SHEEP CAME FORTH FROM THE FOLD.      The great bell of Beaulieu was ringing. Far away through the forest  might be heard its musical clangor and swell. Peat-cutters on Blackdown  and fishers upon the Exe heard the distant throbbing rising and falling  upon the sultry summer air. It was a common sound in those parts--as  common as the chatter of the jays and the booming of the bittern. Yet  the fishers and the peasants raised their heads and looked questions at  each other, for the angelus had already gone and vespers was still far  off. Why should the great bell of Beaulieu toll when the shadows were  neither short nor long?    All round the Abbey the monks were trooping in. Under the long  green-paved avenues of gnarled oaks and of lichened beeches the  white-robed brothers gathered to the sound. From the vine-yard and  the vine-press, from the bouvary or ox-farm, from the marl-pits and  salterns, even from the distant iron-works of Sowley and the outlying  grange of St. Leonard's, they had all turned their steps homewards. It  had been no sudden call. A swift messenger had the night before sped  round to the outlying dependencies of the Abbey, and had left the  summons for every monk to be back in the cloisters by the third hour  after noontide. So urgent a message had not been issued within the  memory of old lay-brother Athanasius, who had cleaned the Abbey knocker  since the year after the Battle of Bannockburn.    A stranger who knew nothing either of the Abbey or of its immense  resources might have gathered from the appearance of the brothers some  conception of the varied duties which they were called upon to perform,  and of the busy, wide-spread life which centred in the old monastery.  As they swept gravely in by twos and by threes, with bended heads and  muttering lips there were few who did not bear upon them some signs of  their daily toil. Here were two with wrists and sleeves all spotted  with the ruddy grape juice. There again was a bearded brother with  a broad-headed axe and a bundle of faggots upon his shoulders, while  beside him walked another with the shears under his arm and the white  wool still clinging to his whiter gown. A long, straggling troop bore  spades and mattocks while the two rearmost of all staggered along under  a huge basket o' fresh-caught carp, for the morrow was Friday, and there  were fifty platters to be filled and as many sturdy trenchermen behind  them. Of all the throng there was scarce one who was not labor-stained  and weary, for Abbot Berghersh was a hard man to himself and to others.    Meanwhile, in the broad and lofty chamber set apart for occasions of  import, the Abbot himself was pacing impatiently backwards and forwards,  with his long white nervous hands clasped in front of him. His thin,  thought-worn features and sunken, haggard cheeks bespoke one who had  indeed beaten down that inner foe whom every man must face, but had none  the less suffered sorely in the contest. In crushing his passions he had  well-nigh crushed himself. Yet, frail as was his person there gleamed  out ever and anon from under his drooping brows a flash of fierce  energy, which recalled to men's minds that he came of a fighting stock,  and that even now his twin-brother, Sir Bartholomew Berghersh, was one  of the most famous of those stern warriors who had planted the Cross of  St. George before the gates of Paris. With lips compressed and clouded  brow, he strode up and down the oaken floor, the very genius and  impersonation of asceticism, while the great bell still thundered and  clanged above his head. At last the uproar died away in three last,  measured throbs, and ere their echo had ceased the Abbot struck a small  gong which summoned a lay-brother to his presence.    \"Have the brethren come?\" he asked, in the Anglo-French dialect used in  religious houses.    \"They are here,\" the other answered, with his eyes cast down and his  hands crossed upon his chest.    \"All?\"    \"Two and thirty of the seniors and fifteen of the novices, most holy  father. Brother Mark of the Spicarium is sore smitten with a fever and  could not come. He said that--\"    \"It boots not what he said. Fever or no, he should have come at my call.  His spirit must be chastened, as must that of many more in this Abbey.  You yourself, brother Francis, have twice raised your voice, so it hath  come to my ears, when the reader in the refectory hath been dealing with  the lives of God's most blessed saints. What hast thou to say?\"    The lay-brother stood meek and silent, with his arms still crossed in  front of him.    \"One thousand Aves and as many Credos, said standing with arms  outstretched before the shrine of the Virgin, may help thee to remember  that the Creator hath given us two ears and but one mouth, as a token  that there is twice the work for the one as for the other. Where is the  master of the novices?\"    \"He is without, most holy father.\"    \"Send him hither.\"    The sandalled feet clattered over the wooden floor, and the iron-bound  door creaked upon its hinges. In a few moments it opened again to admit  a short square monk with a heavy, composed face and an authoritative  manner.    \"You have sent for me, holy father?\"    \"Yes, brother Jerome, I wish that this matter be disposed of with as  little scandal as may be, and yet it is needful that the example should  be a public one.\" The Abbot spoke in Latin now, as a language which was  more fitted by its age and solemnity to convey the thoughts of two high  dignitaries of the order.    \"It would, perchance, be best that the novices be not admitted,\"  suggested the master. \"This mention of a woman may turn their minds from  their pious meditations to worldly and evil thoughts.\"    \"Woman! woman!\" groaned the Abbot. \"Well has the holy Chrysostom termed  them _radix malorum_. From Eve downwards, what good hath come from any  of them? Who brings the plaint?\"    \"It is brother Ambrose.\"    \"A holy and devout young man.\"    \"A light and a pattern to every novice.\"    \"Let the matter be brought to an issue then according to our old-time  monastic habit. Bid the chancellor and the sub-chancellor lead in the  brothers according to age, together with brother John, the accused, and  brother Ambrose, the accuser.\"    \"And the novices?\"    \"Let them bide in the north alley of the cloisters. Stay! Bid the  sub-chancellor send out to them Thomas the lector to read unto them  from the 'Gesta beati Benedicti.' It may save them from foolish and  pernicious babbling.\"    The Abbot was left to himself once more, and bent his thin gray face  over his illuminated breviary. So he remained while the senior monks  filed slowly and sedately into the chamber seating themselves upon the  long oaken benches which lined the wall on either side. At the further  end, in two high chairs as large as that of the Abbot, though hardly as  elaborately carved, sat the master of the novices and the chancellor,  the latter a broad and portly priest, with dark mirthful eyes and a  thick outgrowth of crisp black hair all round his tonsured head. Between  them stood a lean, white-faced brother who appeared to be ill at ease,  shifting his feet from side to side and tapping his chin nervously with  the long parchment roll which he held in his hand. The Abbot, from his  point of vantage, looked down on the two long lines of faces, placid and  sun-browned for the most part, with the large bovine eyes and unlined  features which told of their easy, unchanging existence. Then he turned  his eager fiery gaze upon the pale-faced monk who faced him.    \"This plaint is thine, as I learn,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#1)"],[1,"Flis, and Distributed Proofreaders                        SAINT AUGUSTIN    BY    LOUIS BERTRAND      TRANSLATED BY VINCENT O'SULLIVAN          TRANSLATOR'S NOTE      The quotations from Saint Augustin's _Confessions_ are taken from Canon  Bigg's scholarly version, which seems to me the best in English. But there  are places where M. Bertrand's reading of the original text differs from  Dr. Bigg's, and in such cases I have felt myself obliged to follow the  author of this book. These differences never seriously affect the meaning  of a passage; sometimes it is a mere matter of choice, as with the word  _collactaneum_ (i, 7) which Dr. Bigg translates \"twin,\" and M. Bertrand,  like Pusey, _frere de lait_, or \"foster-brother.\" As a rule, Dr. Bigg  chooses the quietest terms, and M. Bertrand the most forcible. Those  curious in such matters may like to see an instance.    The original text runs:--        Avulsa a latere meo tanquam impedimento conjugii, cum qua cubare      solitus eram, cor ubi adhaerebat, concisum et vulneratum mihi erat, et      trahebat sanguinem.        (_Confessiones_, vi, 15.)    M. Bertrand translates:--        Quand on arracha de mes flancs, sous pretexte qu'elle empechait mon      mariage, celle avec qui j'avais coutume de dormir, depuis si longtemps,      la ou mon coeur etait attache au sien, il se dechira, et je trainais      mon sang avec ma blessure.    Canon Bigg's version is:--        My mistress was torn from my side as an obstacle to my marriage, and my      heart, which clung to her, was torn and wounded till it bled.    In this place, it will be observed that Dr. Bigg does not emphasize the  word _ubi_ which, as the reader will find on turning to page 185 of this  volume, M. Bertrand thinks so significant.    The remaining English versions of the writings of Saint Augustin and of the  other Latin authors quoted are my own, except the passages from _The City  of God_, including the verse translation of Persius, which are taken,  with some necessary alterations, from the Seventeenth century translation  ascribed to John Healey.

Saint Augustin is now little more than a celebrated name. Outside of  learned or theological circles people no longer read him. Such is true  renown: we admire the saints, as we do great men, on trust. Even his  _Confessions_ are generally spoken of only from hearsay. By this neglect,  is he atoning for the renewal of glory in which he shone during the  seventeenth century, when the Jansenists, in their inveterate obstinacy,  identified him with the defence of their cause? The reputation of sour  austerity and of argumentative and tiresome prolixity which attaches to  the remembrance of all the writers of Port-Royal, save Pascal--has that  affected too the work of Augustin, enlisted in spite of himself in the  ranks of these pious schismatics? And yet, if there have ever been any  beings who do not resemble Augustin, and whom probably he would have  attacked with all his eloquence and all the force of his dialectic, they  are the Jansenists. Doubtless he would have said with contempt: \"The party  of Jansen,\" even as in his own day, with his devotion to Catholic unity, he  said: \"The party of Donatus.\"    It must be acknowledged also that the very sight of his works is  terrifying, whether we take the enormous folios in two columns of the  Benedictine edition, or the volumes, almost as compact, and much more  numerous, of recent editions. Behind such a rampart of printed matter he is  well defended against profane curiosity. It needs courage and perseverance  to penetrate into this labyrinth of text, all bristling with theology and  exegesis and metaphysics. But only cross the threshold of the repellent  enclosure, grow used to the order and shape of the building, and it will  not be long ere you are overcome by a warm sympathy, and then by a steadily  increasing admiration for the host who dwells there. The hieratic face  of the old bishop lights up, becomes strangely living, almost modern, in  expression. You discover under the text one of the most passionate lives,  most busy and richest in instruction, that history has to shew. What it  teaches is applicable to ourselves, answers to our interests of yesterday  and to-day. This existence, and the century in which it was passed, recall  our own century and ourselves. The return of similar circumstances has  brought similar situations and characters; it is almost our portrait. And  we feel half ready to conclude that at the present moment there is no  subject more actual than St. Augustin.    At least he is one of the most interesting. What, indeed, is more romantic  than this wandering life of rhetorician and student that the youthful  Augustin led, from Thagaste to Carthage, from Carthage to Milan and to  Rome--begun in the pleasures and tumult of great cities, and ending in the  penitence, the silence, and recollection of a monastery? And again, what  drama is more full of colour and more profitable to consider than that last  agony of the Empire, of which Augustin was a spectator, and, with all his  heart faithful to Rome, would have prevented if he could? And then, what  tragedy more stirring and painful than the crisis of soul and conscience  which tore his life? Well may it be said that, regarded as a whole, the  life of Augustin was but a continual spiritual struggle, a battle of the  soul. It is the battle of every moment, the never-ceasing combat of body  and spirit, which the poets of that time dramatized, and which is the  history of the Christian of all times. The stake of the battle is a soul.  The upshot is the final triumph, the redemption of a soul.    What makes the life of Augustin so complete and so truly typical is that  he fought the good fight, not only against himself, but against all the  enemies of the Church and the Empire. If he was a doctor and a saint, so  was he too the type of the man of action in one of the most disheartened  periods. That he triumphed over his passions--this, in truth, concerns only  God and himself. That he preached, wrote, shook crowds, disturbed minds,  may seem without importance to those who reject his doctrine. But that  across the centuries his soul, afire with charity, continues to warm our  own; that without our knowledge he still shapes us; and that, in a way  more or less remote, he is still the master of our hearts, and, in certain  aspects, of our minds--there is what touches each and all of us, without  distinction. Not only has Augustin always his great place in the living  communion of all christened people, but the Western soul is marked with the  stamp of his soul.    First of all, his fate is confused with that of the dying Empire. He  witnessed, if not the utter disappearance, at least the gradual swooning  away of that admirable thing called the Roman Empire, image of Catholic  unity. Well, we are the wreckage of the Empire. Usually, we turn away with  contempt from those wretched centuries which underwent the descents of the  Barbarians. For us, that is the Lower-Empire, a time of shameful decadence  which deserves nothing but our scorn. However, it is out of this chaos  and this degradation that we have arisen. The wars of the Roman republic  concern us less than the outlawry of the Barbarian chiefs who separated our  Gaul from the Empire, and without knowing it, prepared the dawn of France.  After all, what are the rivalries of Marius and Sylla to us? The victory of  Aetius over the Huns in the plains of Chalons concerns us a good deal more.  Further, it is unfair to the Lower-Empire to view it only as a time of  feebleness and cowardice and corruption. It was also an epoch of immense  activity, prolific of daring and high-flying adventurers, some of them  heroic. Even the most degenerate of the last Emperors never lost the  conviction of Roman majesty and grandeur. Unto the very end, they employed  all the ruses of their diplomacy to prevent the Barbarian chiefs from  imagining themselves anything else but vassals of the Empire. Honorius, at  bay in Ravenna, persisted in refusing Alaric the title of commander of the  _Cohortes Urbanae_, even though his refusal were to lead to the sack of Rome  and imperil his own life.    Simply by his fidelity to the Empire, Augustin shews himself one like  ourselves--a Latin of Occitania. But still closer resemblances draw him  near to us. His time was very like our own time.
