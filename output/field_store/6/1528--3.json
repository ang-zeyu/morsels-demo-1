RABELAIS, _Prol. L_. 5           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER I      Nightmare Abbey, a venerable family-mansion, in a highly picturesque  state of semi-dilapidation, pleasantly situated on a strip of dry land  between the sea and the fens, at the verge of the county of Lincoln,  had the honour to be the seat of Christopher Glowry, Esquire. This  gentleman was naturally of an atrabilarious temperament, and much  troubled with those phantoms of indigestion which are commonly called  _blue devils_. He had been deceived in an early friendship: he had  been crossed in love; and had offered his hand, from pique, to a lady,  who accepted it from interest, and who, in so doing, violently tore  asunder the bonds of a tried and youthful attachment. Her vanity was  gratified by being the mistress of a very extensive, if not very  lively, establishment; but all the springs of her sympathies were  frozen. Riches she possessed, but that which enriches them, the  participation of affection, was wanting. All that they could purchase  for her became indifferent to her, because that which they could not  purchase, and which was more valuable than themselves, she had, for  their sake, thrown away. She discovered, when it was too late, that  she had mistaken the means for the end--that riches, rightly used, are  instruments of happiness, but are not in themselves happiness. In this  wilful blight of her affections, she found them valueless as means:  they had been the end to which she had immolated all her affections,  and were now the only end that remained to her. She did not confess  this to herself as a principle of action, but it operated through the  medium of unconscious self-deception, and terminated in inveterate  avarice. She laid on external things the blame of her mind's internal  disorder, and thus became by degrees an accomplished scold. She often  went her daily rounds through a series of deserted apartments, every  creature in the house vanishing at the creak of her shoe, much more  at the sound of her voice, to which the nature of things affords no  simile; for, as far as the voice of woman, when attuned by gentleness  and love, transcends all other sounds in harmony, so far does  it surpass all others in discord, when stretched into unnatural  shrillness by anger and impatience.    Mr Glowry used to say that his house was no better than a spacious  kennel, for every one in it led the life of a dog. Disappointed both  in love and in friendship, and looking upon human learning as vanity,  he had come to a conclusion that there was but one good thing in the  world, _videlicet_, a good dinner; and this his parsimonious lady  seldom suffered him to enjoy: but, one morning, like Sir Leoline in  Christabel, 'he woke and found his lady dead,' and remained a very  consolate widower, with one small child.    This only son and heir Mr Glowry had christened Scythrop, from the  name of a maternal ancestor, who had hanged himself one rainy day in a  fit of _toedium vitae_, and had been eulogised by a coroner's jury in  the comprehensive phrase of _felo de se_; on which account, Mr Glowry  held his memory in high honour, and made a punchbowl of his skull.    When Scythrop grew up, he was sent, as usual, to a public school,  where a little learning was painfully beaten into him, and from thence  to the university, where it was carefully taken out of him; and he was  sent home like a well-threshed ear of corn, with nothing in his head:  having finished his education to the high satisfaction of the  master and fellows of his college, who had, in testimony of their  approbation, presented him with a silver fish-slice, on which his name  figured at the head of a laudatory inscription in some semi-barbarous  dialect of Anglo-Saxonised Latin.    His fellow-students, however, who drove tandem and random in great  perfection, and were connoisseurs in good inns, had taught him to  drink deep ere he departed. He had passed much of his time with these  choice spirits, and had seen the rays of the midnight lamp tremble  on many a lengthening file of empty bottles. He passed his vacations  sometimes at Nightmare Abbey, sometimes in London, at the house of  his uncle, Mr Hilary, a very cheerful and elastic gentleman, who had  married the sister of the melancholy Mr Glowry. The company that  frequented his house was the gayest of the gay. Scythrop danced with  the ladies and drank with the gentlemen, and was pronounced by both a  very accomplished charming fellow, and an honour to the university.    At the house of Mr Hilary, Scythrop first saw the beautiful Miss Emily  Girouette. He fell in love; which is nothing new. He was favourably  received; which is nothing strange. Mr Glowry and Mr Girouette had  a meeting on the occasion, and quarrelled about the terms of the  bargain; which is neither new nor strange. The lovers were torn  asunder, weeping and vowing everlasting constancy; and, in three weeks  after this tragical event, the lady was led a smiling bride to the  altar, by the Honourable Mr Lackwit; which is neither strange nor new.    Scythrop received this intelligence at Nightmare Abbey, and was half  distracted on the occasion. It was his first disappointment, and  preyed deeply on his sensitive spirit. His father, to comfort him,  read him a Commentary on Ecclesiastes, which he had himself composed,  and which demonstrated incontrovertibly that all is vanity. He  insisted particularly on the text, 'One man among a thousand have I  found, but a woman amongst all those have I not found.'    'How could he expect it,' said Scythrop, 'when the whole thousand were  locked up in his seraglio? His experience is no precedent for a free  state of society like that in which we live.'    'Locked up or at large,' said Mr Glowry, 'the result is the same:  their minds are always locked up, and vanity and interest keep the  key. I speak feelingly, Scythrop.'    'I am sorry for it, sir,' said Scythrop. 'But how is it that their  minds are locked up? The fault is in their artificial education, which  studiously models them into mere musical dolls, to be set out for sale  in the great toy-shop of society.'    'To be sure,' said Mr Glowry, 'their education is not so well finished  as yours has been; and your idea of a musical doll is good. I bought  one myself, but it was confoundedly out of tune; but, whatever be the  cause, Scythrop, the effect is certainly this, that one is pretty  nearly as good as another, as far as any judgment can be formed of  them before marriage. It is only after marriage that they show  their true qualities, as I know by bitter experience. Marriage is,  therefore, a lottery, and the less choice and selection a man bestows  on his ticket the better; for, if he has incurred considerable pains  and expense to obtain a lucky number, and his lucky number proves a  blank, he experiences not a simple, but a complicated disappointment;  the loss of labour and money being superadded to the disappointment of  drawing a blank, which, constituting simply and entirely the grievance  of him who has chosen his ticket at random, is, from its simplicity,  the more endurable.' This very excellent reasoning was thrown away  upon Scythrop, who retired to his tower as dismal and disconsolate as  before.    The tower which Scythrop inhabited stood at the south-eastern angle of  the Abbey; and, on the southern side, the foot of the tower opened on  a terrace, which was called the garden, though nothing grew on it but  ivy, and a few amphibious weeds. The south-western tower, which was  ruinous and full of owls, might, with equal propriety, have been  called the aviary. This terrace or garden, or terrace-garden, or  garden-terrace (the reader may name it _ad libitum_), took in an  oblique view of the open sea, and fronted a long tract of level  sea-coast, and a fine monotony of fens and windmills.    The reader will judge, from what we have said, that this building was  a sort of castellated abbey; and it will, probably, occur to him to  inquire if it had been one of the strong-holds of the ancient church  militant. Whether this was the case, or how far it had been indebted  to the taste of Mr Glowry's ancestors for any transmutations from its  original state, are, unfortunately, circumstances not within the pale  of our knowledge.    The north-western tower contained the apartments of Mr Glowry. The  moat at its base, and the fens beyond, comprised the whole of his  prospect. This moat surrounded the Abbey, and was in immediate contact  with the walls on every side but the south.

The baked clay tablets and portions of tablets which describe the  views and beliefs of the Babylonians and Assyrians about the Creation  were discovered by Mr. (later Sir) A.H. Layard, Mormuzd Rassam and  George Smith, Assistant in the Department of Oriental Antiquities in  the British Museum. They were found among the ruins of the Palace and  Library of Ashur-bani-pal (B.C. 668-626) at Kuyunjik (Nineveh),  between the years 1848 and 1876. Between 1866 and 1870, the great  \"find\" of tablets and fragments, some 20,000 in number, which Rassam  made in 1852, was worked through by George Smith, who identified many  of the historical inscriptions of Shalmaneser II, Tiglath-Pileser III,  Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and other kings mentioned in the  Bible, and several literary compositions of a legendary character,  fables, etc. In the course of this work he discovered fragments of  various versions of the Babylonian Legend of the Deluge, and portions  of several texts belonging to a work which treated of the beginning of  things, and of the Creation. In 1870, Rawlinson and Smith noted  allusions to the Creation in the important tablet K.63, but the texts  of portions of tablets of the Creation Series at that time available  for study were so fragmentary that it was impossible for these  scholars to find their correct sequence. During the excavations which  Smith carried out at Kuyunjik in 1873 and 1874 for the proprietors of  the _Daily Telegraph_ and the Trustees of the British Museum, he  was, he tells us, fortunate enough to discover \"several fragments of  the Genesis Legends.\" In January, 1875, he made an exhaustive search  among the tablets in the British Museum, and in the following March he  published, in the _Daily Telegraph_ (March 4th), a summary of the  contents of about twenty fragments of the series of tablets describing  the creation of the heavens and the earth. In November of the same  year he communicated to the Society of Biblical Archaeology [1]  copies of:--(1) the texts on fragments of the First and Fifth Tablets  of Creation; (2) a text describing the fight between the \"Gods and  Chaos\"; and (3) a fragmentary text which, he believed, described the  Fall of Man. In the following year he published translations of all  the known fragments of the Babylonian Creation Legends in his  \"Chaldean Account of Genesis\" (London, 1876, 8vo, with photographs).  In this volume were included translations of the Exploits of Gizdubar  (Gilgamish), and some early Babylonian fables and legends of the gods.    [Footnote 1: See the _Transactions_, Vol. IV, Plates I-VI, London,  1876.]        PUBLICATION OF THE CREATION TABLETS.    The publication of the above-mentioned texts and translations proved  beyond all doubt the correctness of Rawlinson's assertion made in  1865, that \"certain portions of the Babylonian and Assyrian Legends of  the Creation resembled passages in the early chapters of the Book of  Genesis.\"  During the next twenty years, the Creation texts were  copied and recopied by many Assyriologists, but no publication  appeared in which all the material available for reconstructing the  Legend was given in a collected form. In 1898, the Trustees of the  British Museum ordered the publication of all the Creation texts  contained in the Babylonian and Assyrian Collections, and the late  Mr. L. W. King, Assistant in the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian  Antiquities, was directed to prepare an edition. The exhaustive  preparatory search which he made through the collections of tablets in  the British Museum resulted in the discovery of many unpublished  fragments of the Creation Legends, and in the identification of a  fragment which, although used by George Smith, had been lost sight of  for about twenty-five years. He ascertained also that, according to  the Ninevite scribes, the Tablets of the Creation Series were seven in  number, and what several versions of the Legend of the Creation, the  works of Babylonian and Assyrian editors of different periods, must  have existed in early Mesopotamian Libraries. King's edition of the  Creation Texts appeared in \"Cuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets in  the British Museum,\" Part XIII, London, 1901. As the scope of this  work did not permit the inclusion of his translations, and commentary  and notes, he published these in a private work entitled, \"The Seven  Tablets of Creation, or the Babylonian and Assyrian Legends concerning  the creation of the world and of mankind,\" London, 1902, 8vo. A  supplementary volume contained much new material which had been found  by him since the appearance of the official edition of the texts, and  in fact doubled the number of Creation Texts known hitherto.    [Illustration: Babylonian map of the world, showing the ocean  surrounding the world and making the position of Babylon on the  Euphrates as its centre. It shows also the mountains as the source of  the river, the land of Assyria, Bit-Iakinu, and the swamps at the  mouth of the Euphrates.  [No. 92,687.]]        THE OBJECT OF THE BABYLONIAN LEGEND OF THE CREATION.    A perusal of the texts of the Seven Tablets of Creation, which King  was enabled, through the information contained in them, to arrange for  the first time in their proper sequence, shows that the main object of  the Legend was the glorification of the god Marduk, the son of Ea  (Enki), as the conqueror of the dragon Tiamat, and not the narration  of the story of the creation of the heavens, and earth and man. The  Creation properly speaking, is only mentioned as an exploit of Marduk  in the Sixth Tablet, and the Seventh Tablet is devoted wholly to the  enumeration of the honorific titles of Marduk. It is probable that  every great city in Babylonia, whilst accepting the general form of  the Creation Legend, made the greatest of its local gods the hero of  it. It has long been surmised that the prominence of Marduk in the  Legend was due to the political importance of the city of Babylon. And  we now know from the fragments of tablets which have been excavated in  recent years by German Assyriologists at Kal'at Sharkat (or Shargat,  or Shar'at), that in the city of Ashur, the god Ashur, the national  god of Assyria, actually occupied in texts[1] of the Legend in use  there the position which Marduk held in four of the Legends current in  Babylonia. There is reason for thinking that the original hero of the  Legend was Enlil (Bel), the great god of Nippur (the Nafar, or Nufar  of the Arab writers), and that when Babylon rose into power under the  First Dynasty (about B.C. 2300), his position in the Legend was  usurped at Babylon by Marduk.    [Footnote 1: See the duplicate fragments described in the Index to  Ebeling, _Keilschrifttexte aus Assur_, Leipzig, 1919 fol.]    [Illustration: Excavations in Babylonia and Assyria.]        VARIANT FORMS OF THE BABYLONIAN LEGEND OF THE CREATION.    The views about the Creation which are described in the Seven Tablets  mentioned above were not the only ones current in Mesopotamia, and  certainly they were not necessarily the most orthodox. Though in the  version of the Legend already referred to the great god of creation  was Enlil, or Marduk, or Ashur, we know that in the Legend of  Gilgamish (Second Tablet) it was the goddess Aruru who created Enkidu  (Eabani) from a piece of clay moistened with her own spittle. And in  the so-called \"bilingual\" version[1] of the Legend, we find that this  goddess assisted Marduk as an equal in the work of creating the seed  of mankind. This version, although Marduk holds the position of  pre-eminence, differs in many particulars from that given by the Seven  Tablets, and as it is the most important of all the texts which deal  directly with the creation of the heavens and the earth, a rendering  of it is here given.    [Footnote 1: The text is found on a tablet from Abu Habbah, Brit.
