Tyler    Professor of the Greek and Latin Languages in Amherst College          PREFACE.      This edition of the Germania and Agricola of Tacitus is designed to meet  the following wants, which, it is believed, have been generally felt by  teachers and pupils in American Colleges.    1. A Latin text, approved and established by the essential concurrence of  all the more recent editors. The editions of Tacitus now in use in this  country abound in readings purely conjectural, adopted without due regard  to the peculiarities of the author, and in direct contravention of the  critical canon, that, other things being equal, the more difficult  reading is the more likely to be genuine. The recent German editions  labor to exhibit and explain, so far as possible, the reading of the best  MSS.    2. A more copious illustration of the grammatical constructions, also of  the rhetorical and poetical usages peculiar to Tacitus, without  translating, however, to such an extent as to supersede the proper  exertions of the student. Few books require so much illustration of this  kind, as the Germania and Agricola of Tacitus; few have received more in  Germany, yet few so little here. In a writer so concise and abrupt as  Tacitus, it has been deemed necessary to pay particular regard to the  connexion of thought, and to the particles, as the hinges of that  connexion.    3. A comparison of the writer and his cotemporaries with authors of the  Augustan age, so as to mark concisely the changes which had been already  wrought in the language and taste of the Roman people. It is chiefly with  a view to aid such a comparison, that it has been thought advisable to  prefix a Life of Tacitus, which is barren indeed of personal incidents,  but which it is hoped may serve to exhibit the author in his relation to  the history, and especially to the literature, of his age.    4. The department in which less remained to be done than any other, for  the elucidation of Tacitus, was that of Geography, History, and  Archaeology. The copious notes of Gordon and Murphy left little to be  desired in this line; and these notes are not only accessible to American  scholars in their original forms, but have been incorporated, more or  less, into all the college editions. If any peculiar merit attaches to  this edition, in this department, it will be found in the frequent  references to such classic authors as furnish collateral information, and  in the illustration of the private life of the Romans, by the help of  such recent works as Becker's Gallus. The editor has also been able to  avail himself of Sharon Turner's History of the Anglo Saxons, which sheds  not a little light on the manners of the Germans.    5. Many of the ablest commentaries on the Germania and Agricola have  appeared within a comparatively recent period, some of them remarkable  examples of critical acumen and exegetical tact, and others, models of  school and college editions. It has been the endeavor of the editor to  bring down the literature pertaining to Tacitus to the present time, and  to embody in small compass the most valuable results of the labors of  such recent German editors as Grimm, GÃ¼nther, Gruber, Kiessling, Dronke,  Roth, Ruperti, and Walther.    The text is, in the main, that of Walther, though the other editors just  named have been consulted; and in such minor differences as exist between  them, I have not hesitated to adopt the reading which seemed best to  accord with the usage and genius of Tacitus, especially when sanctioned  by a decided preponderance of critical suffrage. Other readings have been  referred to in the Notes, so far as they are of any considerable  importance, or supported by respectable authority. Partly for  convenience, but chiefly as a matter of taste, I have ventured to follow  the German editions in dispensing entirely with diacritical marks, and in  some peculiarities of less importance, which if not viewed with favor, it  is hoped, will not be judged with severity. The punctuation is the result  of a diligent comparison of the best editions, together with a careful  study of the connexion of language and of thought.    The German editions above mentioned, together with several French,  English, and American works, have not only been constantly before me, but  have been used with great freedom, and credit awarded to them  accordingly. Some may think their names should have appeared less  frequently; others that they should have received credit to a still  greater extent. Suffice it to say, I have never intended to quote the  language, or borrow the thoughts of an author, without giving his name;  and in matters of fact or opinion, I have cited authorities not only when  I have been indebted to them for the suggestion, but whenever, in a case  of coincidence of views, I thought the authorities would be of any  interest to the student.    I have not considered it needful, with German scrupulosity, to  distinguish between my own references and those of others. It may safely  be taken for granted, that the major, perhaps the better, part of them  have been derived from foreign sources. But no references have been  admitted on trust. They have been carefully verified, and it is hoped  that numerous as they are, they will be found pertinent and useful,  whether illustrative of things, or of mere verbal usage. Some, who use  the book, will doubtless find occasion to follow them out either in whole  or in part; and those who do not, will gain a general impression as to  the sources from which collateral information may be obtained, that will  be of no small value.    The frequent references to the Notes of Professor Kingsley, will show the  estimation in which I hold them. Perhaps I have used them too freely. My  only apology is, that so far as they go, they are just what is wanted;  and if I had avoided using them to a considerable extent, I must have  substituted something less perfect of my own. Had they been more copious,  and extended more to verbal and grammatical illustrations, these Notes  never would have appeared.    The editor is convinced, from his experience as a teacher, that the  student of Tacitus will not master the difficulties, or appreciate the  merits, of so peculiar an author, unless his peculiarities are distinctly  pointed out and explained. Indeed, the student, in reading any classic  author, needs, not to be carried along on the broad shoulders of an  indiscriminate translator, but to be guided at every step in learning his  lessons, by a judicious annotator, who will remove his difficulties, and  aid his progress; who will point out to him what is worthy of attention,  and guard him against the errors to which he is constantly exposed; for  first impressions are lively and permanent, and the errors of the study,  even though corrected in the recitation, not unfrequently leave an  impression on the mind which is never effaced.    Besides the aid derived from books, to which the merit of this edition,  if it have any merit, will be chiefly owing, the editor takes this  opportunity to acknowledge his many obligations to those professors and  other literary gentlemen, who have extended to him assistance and  encouragement. To Prof. H. B. Hackett, of Newton Theological Seminary,  especially, he is indebted for favors, which, numerous and invaluable in  themselves, as the results of a singularly zealous and successful  devotion to classical learning, are doubly grateful as the tokens of a  personal friendship, which began when we were members of the same class  in college. The work was commenced at his suggestion, and has been  carried forward with his constant advice and co-operation. His ample  private library, and, through his influence, the library of the Seminary,  have been placed at my disposal; and the notes passed under his eye and  were improved in not a few particulars, at his suggestion, though he is  in no way responsible for their remaining imperfections. I have also  received counsel and encouragement in all my labors from my esteemed  colleague, Prof. N. W. Fiske, whose instructions in the same department  which has since been committed to my charge, first taught me to love the  Greek and Latin classics. I have only to regret that his ill health and  absence from the country have prevented me from deriving still greater  advantages from his learning and taste. An unforeseen event has, in like  manner, deprived me of the expected cooperation of Prof. Lyman Coleman,  now of Nassau Hall College in N. J., in concert with whom this work was  planned, and was to have been executed, and on whose ripe scholarship,  and familiarity with the German language and literature, I chiefly relied  for its successful accomplishment.    I should not do justice to my feelings, were I to omit the expression of  my obligations to the printer and publishers for the unwearied patience  with which they have labored to perfect the work, under all the  disadvantages attending the superintendance of the press, at such a  distance. If there should still be found in it inaccuracies and  blemishes, it will not be because they have spared any pains to make it a  correct and beautiful book.    It is with unfeigned diffidence that I submit to the public this first  attempt at literary labor. I am fully sensible of its many imperfections,  at the same time I am conscious of an ability to make it better at some  future day, should it meet the favorable regard of the classical teachers  of our land, to whom it is dedicated as an humble contribution to that  cause in which they are now laboring, with such unprecedented zeal.  Should it contribute in any measure to a better understanding, or a  higher appreciation by our youthful countrymen of a classic author, from  whom, beyond almost any other, I have drawn instruction and delight, I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9097"],[0,"Robert's Rules of Order (#1)"],[1,"ROBERT'S RULES OF ORDER    === Page 1 =============================================================    Pocket Manual  of  Rules Of Order  For  Deliberative Assemblies    ---    Part I.

Robert,  Corps of Engineers, U.S.A.    Chicago:  S. C. Griggs & Company.  1876.    === Page 2 =============================================================    ---    Copyright, A.D. 1876,  by  H. M. Robert    ---    Printed by Burdick & Armitage, Milwaukee    === Page 3 =============================================================    PREFACE.    There appears to be much needed a work on parliamentary law, based, in  its general principles, upon the rules and practice of Congress, and  adapted, in its details, to the use of ordinary societies.  Such a work  should give, not only the methods of organizing and conducting the  meetings, the duties of the officers and the names of the ordinary  motions, but in addition, should state in a systematic manner, in  reference to each motion, its object and effect; whether it can be  amended or debated; if debatable, the extent to which it opens the main  question to debate; the circumstances under which it can be made, and  what other motions can be made while it is pending.  This Manual has  been prepared with a view to supplying the above information in a  condensed and systematic manner, each rule being either complete in  itself, or giving references to every section that in any way qualifies  it, so that a stranger to the work can refer to any special subject with  safety.    To aid in quickly referring to as many as possible of the rules relating  to each motion, there is placed immediately before the Index, a Table of  Rules, which enables one, without turning a page, to find the answers to  some two hundred questions.  The Table of Rules is so arranged as to  greatly assist the reader in systematizing his knowledge of  parliamentary law.    The second part is a simple explanation of the common methods of  conducting business in ordinary    === Page 4 =============================================================    meetings, in which the motions are classified according to their uses,  and those used for a similar purpose compared together.  This part is  expressly intended for that large class of the community, who are  unfamiliar with parliamentary usages and are unwilling to devote much  study to the subject, but would be glad with little labor to learn  enough to enable them to take part in meetings of deliberative  assemblies without fear of being out of order.  The object of Rules of  Order in deliberative assemblies, is to assist an assembly to accomplish  the work for which it was designed, in the best possible manner.  To do  this, it is necessary to somewhat restrain the individual, as the right  of an individual in any community to do what he pleases, is incompatible  with the best interests of the whole.  Where there is no law, but every  man does what is right in his own eyes, there is the least of real  liberty.  Experience has shown the importance of definiteness in the  law; and in this country, where customs are so slightly established and  the published manuals of parliamentary practice so conflicting, no  society should attempt to conduct business without having adopted some  work upon the subject, as the authority in all cases not covered by  their own rules.    It has been well said by one of the greatest of English writers on  parliamentary law:  \"Whether these forms be in all cases the most  rational or not is really not of so great importance.  It is much more  material that there should be a rule to go by, than what that rule is,  that there may be a uniformity of proceeding in business, not subject to  the caprice of the chairman, or captiousness of the members.  It is very  material that order, decency and regularity be preserved in a dignified  public body.\"    H. M. R.
