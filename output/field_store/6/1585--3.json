Folks just feeds 'em now and lets 'em grow up.    \"I looks at the young race now and they is as wise as rabbits.    \"I never went to school but three months, but I never will forget that  old blue back McGuffey's. Sam Porter was our teacher and I was scared of  him. I was so scared I couldn't learn nothin'.    \"As far as I can remember I have been treated nice everywhere I been.  Ain't none of the white folks ever mistreated me.    \"Lord, we had plenty to eat in slavery days--and freedom days too.    \"One time when my mother was cookin' for Colonel Morgan and my oldest  brother was workin' some land, my mother always sent me over with a  bucket of milk for him. So one day she say. 'Snooky, come carry your  brother's milk and hurry so he can have it for dinner.' I was goin'  across a field; that was a awful deer country. I had on a red dress and  was goin' on with my milk when I saw a old buck lookin' at me. All at  once he went 'whu-u-u', and then the whole drove come up. There was  mosely trees (I think she must have meant mimosa--ed.) in the field and  I run and climbed up in one of 'em. A mosely tree grows crooked; I don't  care how straight you put it in the ground, it's goin' to grow crooked.  So I climb up in the mosely tree and begin to yell. My brother heard me  and come 'cause he knowed what was up. He used to say, 'Now, Snipe, when  you come 'cross that mosely field, don't you wear that old red dress  'cause they'll get you down and tear that dress off you.' I liked the  dress 'cause he had give it to me. I had set the milk down at the foot  of the tree and it's a wonder they didn't knock it over, but when my  brother heard me yell he come a runnin', with a gun and shot one of the  deer. I got some of the venison and he give some to Colonel Morgan, his  boss man. Colonel Morgan had fought in the war.    \"The reason I can't tell you no more is, since I got old my mind goes  this and that a way.    \"But I can tell you all the doctors that doctored on me. They give me up  to die once. I had the chills from the first of one January to the next  We had Dr. Chester and Dr. McCray and Dr. Lewis--his name was Perry--and  Dr. Green and Dr. Smead. Took quinine till I couldn't hear, and finally  Dr. Green said, 'We'll just quit givin' her medicine, looks like she's  goin' to die anyway.' And then Dr. Lewis fed me for three weeks steady  on okra soup cooked with chicken. Just give me the broth. Then I  commenced gettin' better and here I am.    \"But I can't work like I used to. When I was young I could work right  along with the men but I can't do it now. I wish I could 'cause they's a  heap a things I'd like that my chillun and grandchillun can't get for  me.    \"Well, good-bye, come back again sometime.\"          Interviewer: Samuel S. Taylor  Person interviewed: Campbell Armstrong                      802 Schiller Street, Little Rock, Arkansas  Age: 86      [HW: Boys liked corn shuckings]    \"I couldn't tell you when I was born. I was born a good while before  freedom. I was a boy about ten years old in the time of the Civil War.  That would make me about eighty-five or six years old.    \"My father's name was Cy Armstrong. My mother's name was Gracie  Armstrong. I don't know the names of my grandparents. They was gone when  I got here. My sister died right there in the corner of the next room.      House and Furniture    \"I used to live in an old log house. Take dirt and dob the cracks. The  floors were these here planks. We had two windows and one door. That was  in Georgia, in Houston County, on old Dempsey Brown's place. I know  him--know who dug his grave.    \"They had beds nailed up to the side of the house. People had a terrible  time you know. White folks had it all. When I come along they had it and  they had it ever since I been here. You didn't have no chance like folks  have nowadays. Just made benches and stools to sit on. Made tables out  of planks. I never saw any cupboards and things like that. Them things  wasn't thought about then. The house was like a stable then. But them  log houses was better than these 'cause the wind couldn't get through  them.      Work as a Boy    \"I wasn't doin' nothin' but totin' water. I toted water for a whole year  when I was a boy about eight years old. I was the water boy for the  field hands. Later I worked out in the fields myself. They would make me  sit on my mammy's row to help keep her up.      Free Negroes    \"You better not say you were free them days. If you did, they'd tell you  to get out of there. You better not stop on this side of the Mason Dixie  Line either. You better stop on the other side. Whenever a nigger got so  he couldn't mind, they'd take him down and whip him. They'd whip the  free niggers just the same as they did the slaves.      Marriage    \"You see that broom there? They just lay that broom down and step over  it. That was all the marriage they knowed about.      Corn Shuckings    \"The boys used to just get down and raise a holler and shuck that corn.  Man, they had fun! They sure liked to go to those corn shuckings. They  danced and went on. They'd give 'em whiskey too. That's all I know about  it.      Rations    \"They'd weigh the stuff out and give it to you and you better not go  back. They'd give you three pounds of meat and a quart of meal and  molasses when they'd make it. Sometimes they would take a notion to give  you something like flour. But you had to take what they give you. They  give out the rations every Saturday. That was to last you a week.      Patrollers    \"I was at a ball one night. They had fence rails in the fire. Patroller  knocked at the door, stepped in and closed it behind him. Nigger pulled  a rail out of the fire and stuck it 'gainst the patroller and that  patroller stepped aside and let that nigger get by. Niggers used to tie  ropes across the road so that the patrollers' horses would trip up.      Mulattoes    \"I never seed any mulattoes then. That thing is something that just come  up. Old Dempsey Brown, if he seed a white man goin' 'round with the  nigger women on his place, he run him away from there. But that's gwine  on in the full now.    \"That ought not to be. If God had wanted them people to mix, he'd have  mixed 'em. God made 'em red and white and black. And I'm goin' to stay  black. I ain't climbed the fence yet and I won't climb it now. I don't  know. I don't believe in that. If you are white be white, and if you are  black be black. Children need to go out and play but these boys ought  not to be 'lowed to run after these girls.      Whippings    \"Your overseer carried their straps with them. They had 'em with 'em all  the time. Just like them white folks do down to the County Farm. Used to  use a man just like he was a beast. They'd make him lay down on the  ground and whip him. They'd had to shoot me down. That is the reason I  tend to my business. If he wouldn't lay down they'd call for help and  strap him down and stretch him out. Put one man on one arm and another  on the other. They'd pull his clothes down and whip the blood out of  him. Them people didn't care what they done since they didn't do right.      Freedom    \"When I first heard them talking about freedom, I didn't know what  freedom was. I was there standin' right up and looking at 'em when they  told us we was free. And master said, 'You all free now. You can go  where you want to.'    \"They never give you a thing when they freed you. They give you some  work to do. They never looked for nothin' only to go to work. The white  folks always had the best of it.    \"When Abe Lincoln first freed 'em, they all stood together. If this one  was ill the others went over and sit up with him. If he needed something  they'd carry it to him. They don't do that now. They done well then. As  soon as they quit standing together then they had trouble.      Wages Then    \"Fellow said to me, 'Campbell, I want you to split up them blocks and  pile 'em up for me.' I said, 'What you goin' to pay me?' He said, 'I'll  pay you what is right.' I said, 'That won't do; you have to tell me what  you goin' to give me before I start to work.' And he said to me, 'You  can git to hell out of here.'      Selling and Buying Slaves    \"They'd put you up on the block and sell you. That is just what they'd  do--sell you. These white folks will do anything,--anything they want to  do. They'd take your clothes off just like you was some kind of a beast.    \"You used to be worth a thousand dollars then, but you're not worth two  bits now. You ain't worth nothin' when you're free.      Refugees--Jeff Davis    \"They used to come to my place in droves. Wagons would start coming in  in the morning and they wouldn't stop coming in till two or three in the  evening. They'd just be travelin' to keep out the way of the Yankees.  They caught old Jeff Davis over in Twiggs County. That's in Georgia.  Caught him in Buzzard's Roost. That was only about four or five miles  from where I was. I was right down yonder in Houston County. Twigg  County and Houston County is adjoinin'. I never saw any of the soldiers  but they was following them though.      Voters    \"I have seen plenty of niggers voting. I wasn't old enough to vote in  Georgia. I come in Arkansas and I found out how the folks used  themselves and I come out that business. They was selling themselves  just like cattle and I wouldn't have nothing to do with that.    \"I knew Jerry Lawson, who was Justice of Peace. He was a nigger, a  low-down devil. Man, them niggers done more dirt in this city. The  Republicans had this city and state. I went to the polls and there was  very few white folks there. I knew several of them niggers--Mack  Armstrong, he was Justice of Peace. I can't call the rest of them.  Nothing but old thieves. If they had been people, they'd been honest.  Wouldn't sell their brother. It is bad yet. They still stealin' yet.      Ku Klux    \"That's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11277"],[0,"Egyptian Ideas of the Future Life (#10)"],[1,"Corinthians asked Saint Paul, \"How are the dead  raised up? and with what body do they come?\" But beyond doubt the belief  in the Resurrection was accepted by the dominant classes in Egypt. The  ceremonies which the Egyptians performed with the view of assisting the  deceased to pass the ordeal of the judgment, and to overcome his enemies  in the next world, will be described elsewhere, as also will be the form  in which the dead were raised up; we therefore return to the theological  history of Osiris.    The centre and home of the worship of Osiris in Egypt under the early  dynasties was Abydos, where the head of the god was said to be buried.  It spread north and south in the course of time, and several large  cities claimed to possess one or other of the limbs of his body. The  various episodes in the life of the god were made the subject of solemn  representations in the temple, and little by little the performance of  the obligatory and non-obligatory services in connection with them  occupied, in certain temples, the greater part of the time of the  priests. The original ideas concerning the god were forgotten and new  ones grew up; from being the _example_ of a man who had risen from the  dead and had attained unto life everlasting, he became the _cause_ of  the resurrection of the dead; and the power to bestow eternal life upon  mortals was transferred from the gods to him. The alleged dismemberment  of Osiris was forgotten in the fact that he dwelt in a perfect body in  the underworld, and that, whether dismembered or not, he had become  after his death the father of Horus by Isis. As early as the XIIth  dynasty, about B.C. 2500, the worship of this god had become almost  universal, and a thousand years later Osiris had become a sort of  national god. The attributes of the great cosmic gods were ascribed to  him, and he appeared to man not only as the god and judge of the dead,  but also as the creator of the world and of all things in it. He who was  the son of R[=a] became the equal of his father, and he took his place  side by side with him in heaven.    We have an interesting proof of the identification of Osiris with R[=a]  in Chapter XVII. of the Book of the Dead. It will be remembered that  this Chapter consists of a series of what might almost be called  articles of faith, each of which is followed by one or more explanations  which represent one or more quite different opinions; the Chapter also  is accompanied by a series of Vignettes. In line 110 it is said, \"I am  the soul which dwelleth in the two _tchafi_, [Footnote: _i.e._, the  souls of Osiris and R[=a].] What is this then? It is Osiris when he  goeth into Tattu (_i.e._, Busiris) and findeth there the soul of R[=a];  there the one god embraceth the other, and souls spring into being  within the two _tchafi_.\" In the Vignette which illustrates this passage  the souls of R[=a] and Osiris are seen in the forms of hawks standing on  a pylon, and facing each other in Tattu; the former has upon his head a  disk, and the latter, who is human-headed, the white crown. It is a  noticeable fact that even at his meeting with R[=a] the soul of Osiris  preserves the human face, the sign of his kinship with man.    Now Osiris became not only the equal of R[=a], but, in many respects, a  greater god than he. It is said, that from the nostrils of the head of  Osiris, which was buried at Abydos, came forth the scarabaeus [Footnote:  See von Berginaun in _Aeg Zeitschrift_, 1880, p. 88 ff.] which was at  once the emblem and type of the god Khepera, who caused all things to  come into being, and of the resurrection. In this manner Osiris became  the source and origin of gods, men, and things, and [Illustration: The  soul of R[=a] (1) meeting the soul of Osiris (2) in Tattu. The cat  (_i.e._, R[=a]) by the Persea tree (3) cutting off the head of the  serpent which typified night.] the manhood of the god was forgotten. The  next step was to ascribe to him the attributes of God, and in the  XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties he seems to have disputed the sovereignty of  the three companies of gods, that is to say of the trinity of trinities  of trinities, [Footnote: Each company of the gods contained three  trinities or triads.] with Amen-R[=a], who by this time was usually  called the \"king of the gods.\" The ideas held concerning Osiris at this  period will best be judged by the following extracts from contemporary  hymns:--      \"Glory [Footnote: See _Chapters of Coming Forth by Day_ (translation),    p. 11.] be to thee, O Osiris, Un-nefer, the great god within Abtu    (Abydos), king of eternity, lord of everlastingness, who passest    through millions of years in thy existence. The eldest son of the womb    of Nut, engendered by Seb the Ancestor [of the gods], lord of the    crowns of the South and of the North, lord of the lofty white crown;    as prince of gods and men he hath received the crook and the whip, and    the dignity of his divine fathers. Let thy heart, which dwelleth in    the mountain of Ament, be content, for thy son Horus is stablished    upon thy throne. Thou art crowned lord of Tattu (Busiris) and ruler in    Abydos.\"      \"Praise [Footnote: _Ibid._, p. 34.] be unto thee, O Osiris, lord of    eternity, Un-nefer, Heru-Khuti (Harmachis) whose forms are manifold,    and whose attributes are great, who art Ptah-Seker-Tem in Annu    (Heliopolis), the lord of the hidden place, and the creator of    Het-ka-Ptah (Memphis) and of the gods [therein], the guide of the    underworld, whom [the gods] glorify when thou settest in Nut. Isis    embraceth thee in peace, and she driveth away the fiends from the    mouth of thy paths. Thou turnest thy face upon Amentet, and thou    makest the earth to shine as with refined copper. The dead rise up to    see thee, they breathe the air and they look upon thy face when the    disk riseth on its horizon; their hearts are at peace, inasmuch as    they behold thee, O thou who art eternity and everlastingness.\"    In the latter extract Osiris is identified with the great gods of  Heliopolis and Memphis, where shrines of the Sun-god existed in almost  pre-dynastic times, and finally is himself declared to be \"eternity and  everlastingness\"; thus the ideas of resurrection and immortality are  united in the same divine being. In the following Litany the process of  identification with the gods is continued:--      1. \"Homage to thee, O thou who art the starry deities in Annu, and the    heavenly beings in Kher-aba; [Footnote: A district near Memphis.] thou    god Unti, [Footnote: A god who walks before the boat of the god, Af,    holding a star in each hand.] who art more glorious than the gods who    are hidden in Annu. O grant thou unto me a path whereon I may pass in    peace, for I am just and true; I have not spoken lies wittingly, nor    have I done aught with deceit.\"      2. \"Homage to thee, O An in Antes, Harmachis; thou stridest over    heaven with, long strides, O Harmachis. O grant thou unto me a path,\"    etc. [Footnote: This petition is only written once, but it is intended    to be repeated after each of the nine sections of the Litany.]      3. \"Homage to thee, O soul of everlastingness, thou Soul who dwellest    in Tattu, Un-nefer, son of Nut; thou art lord of Akert (_i.e._, the    underworld). O grant thou unto me a path,\" etc.      4. \"Homage to thee in thy dominion over Tattu; the Ureret crown is    stablished upon thy head; thou art the One who maketh the strength    which protecteth himself, and thou dwellest in peace in Tattu. O grant    thou unto me a path,\" etc.      5. \"Homage to thee, O lord of the Acacia [Footnote: This tree was in    Heliopolis, and the Cat, _i.e._, the Sun, sat near it. (See p. 63).]    tree, the Seker boat [Footnote: The ceremony of setting the Seker boat    on its sledge was performed at dawn.] is set upon its sledge; thou    turnest back the Fiend, the worker of Evil, and thou causest the    Utchat (_i.e._, the Eye of Horus or R[=a]), to rest upon its seat. O    grant thou unto me a path,\" etc.      6. \"Homage to thee, O thou who art mighty in thine hour, thou great    and mighty Prince, dweller in An-rut-f, [Footnote: The place where    nothing grows--the underworld.] lord of eternity and creator of    everlastingness, thou art the lord of Suten-henen _(_i.e._,    Heracleopolis Magna). O grant,\" etc.      7. \"Homage to thee, O thou who restest upon Right and Truth, thou art    lord of Abydos, and thy limbs are joined unto Ta-tchesert (_i.e._, the    Holy Land, the underworld); thou art he to whom fraud and guile are    hateful. O grant,\" etc.      8. \"Homage to thee, O thou who art within thy boat; thou bringest    H[=a]pi (_i.e._, the Nile) forth from his source; the light shineth    upon thy body, and thou art the dweller in Nekhen. O grant,\" etc.      9. \"Homage to thee, O creator of the gods, thou king of the South and    of the North, O Osiris, victorious one, ruler of the world in thy    gracious seasons; thou art the lord of the celestial world. O grant,\"    etc.    And, again: \"R[=a] setteth as Osiris with all the diadems of the divine  spirits and of the gods of Amentet. He is the one divine form, the  hidden one of the Tuat, the holy Soul at the head of Amentet, Un-nefer,  whose duration of life is for ever and ever.\" [Footnote: See _Chapters  of Coming Forth by Day_, p. 334.] We have already referred to the help  which Thoth gave to Isis when he provided her with the words which  caused her dead husband to live again, but the best summary of the good  deeds which this god wrought for Osiris is contained in a hymn in the  _Papyrus of Hunefer_, [Footnote: _Ibid_., p. 343.] where the deceased  is made to say:--      \"I have come unto thee, O son of Nut, Osiris, Prince of    everlastingness; I am, in the following of the god Thoth, and I have    rejoiced at everything which he hath done for thee.
