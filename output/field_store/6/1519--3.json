A Grateful People      On the 20th of August, 1672, the city of the Hague, always so lively,  so neat, and so trim that one might believe every day to be Sunday, with  its shady park, with its tall trees, spreading over its Gothic houses,  with its canals like large mirrors, in which its steeples and its almost  Eastern cupolas are reflected,--the city of the Hague, the capital of  the Seven United Provinces, was swelling in all its arteries with a  black and red stream of hurried, panting, and restless citizens, who,  with their knives in their girdles, muskets on their shoulders, or  sticks in their hands, were pushing on to the Buytenhof, a terrible  prison, the grated windows of which are still shown, where, on the  charge of attempted murder preferred against him by the surgeon  Tyckelaer, Cornelius de Witt, the brother of the Grand Pensionary of  Holland was confined.    If the history of that time, and especially that of the year in the  middle of which our narrative commences, were not indissolubly connected  with the two names just mentioned, the few explanatory pages which we  are about to add might appear quite supererogatory; but we will, from  the very first, apprise the reader--our old friend, to whom we are wont  on the first page to promise amusement, and with whom we always try to  keep our word as well as is in our power--that this explanation is as  indispensable to the right understanding of our story as to that of the  great event itself on which it is based.    Cornelius de Witt, Ruart de Pulten, that is to say, warden of the dikes,  ex-burgomaster of Dort, his native town, and member of the Assembly  of the States of Holland, was forty-nine years of age, when the Dutch  people, tired of the Republic such as John de Witt, the Grand Pensionary  of Holland, understood it, at once conceived a most violent affection  for the Stadtholderate, which had been abolished for ever in Holland by  the \"Perpetual Edict\" forced by John de Witt upon the United Provinces.    As it rarely happens that public opinion, in its whimsical flights,  does not identify a principle with a man, thus the people saw the  personification of the Republic in the two stern figures of the brothers  De Witt, those Romans of Holland, spurning to pander to the fancies  of the mob, and wedding themselves with unbending fidelity to liberty  without licentiousness, and prosperity without the waste of superfluity;  on the other hand, the Stadtholderate recalled to the popular mind the  grave and thoughtful image of the young Prince William of Orange.    The brothers De Witt humoured Louis XIV., whose moral influence was felt  by the whole of Europe, and the pressure of whose material power Holland  had been made to feel in that marvellous campaign on the Rhine, which,  in the space of three months, had laid the power of the United Provinces  prostrate.    Louis XIV. had long been the enemy of the Dutch, who insulted or  ridiculed him to their hearts' content, although it must be said that  they generally used French refugees for the mouthpiece of their spite.  Their national pride held him up as the Mithridates of the Republic.  The brothers De Witt, therefore, had to strive against a double  difficulty,--against the force of national antipathy, and, besides,  against the feeling of weariness which is natural to all vanquished  people, when they hope that a new chief will be able to save them from  ruin and shame.    This new chief, quite ready to appear on the political stage, and to  measure himself against Louis XIV., however gigantic the fortunes of the  Grand Monarch loomed in the future, was William, Prince of Orange, son  of William II., and grandson, by his mother Henrietta Stuart, of Charles  I. of England. We have mentioned him before as the person by whom the  people expected to see the office of Stadtholder restored.    This young man was, in 1672, twenty-two years of age. John de Witt, who  was his tutor, had brought him up with the view of making him a good  citizen. Loving his country better than he did his disciple, the master  had, by the Perpetual Edict, extinguished the hope which the young  Prince might have entertained of one day becoming Stadtholder. But God  laughs at the presumption of man, who wants to raise and prostrate the  powers on earth without consulting the King above; and the fickleness  and caprice of the Dutch combined with the terror inspired by Louis  XIV., in repealing the Perpetual Edict, and re-establishing the office  of Stadtholder in favour of William of Orange, for whom the hand of  Providence had traced out ulterior destinies on the hidden map of the  future.    The Grand Pensionary bowed before the will of his fellow citizens;  Cornelius de Witt, however, was more obstinate, and notwithstanding all  the threats of death from the Orangist rabble, who besieged him in his  house at Dort, he stoutly refused to sign the act by which the office of  Stadtholder was restored. Moved by the tears and entreaties of his wife,  he at last complied, only adding to his signature the two letters V. C.  (Vi Coactus), notifying thereby that he only yielded to force.    It was a real miracle that on that day he escaped from the doom intended  for him.    John de Witt derived no advantage from his ready compliance with the  wishes of his fellow citizens. Only a few days after, an attempt  was made to stab him, in which he was severely although not mortally  wounded.    This by no means suited the views of the Orange faction. The life of  the two brothers being a constant obstacle to their plans, they changed  their tactics, and tried to obtain by calumny what they had not been  able to effect by the aid of the poniard.    How rarely does it happen that, in the right moment, a great man is  found to head the execution of vast and noble designs; and for that  reason, when such a providential concurrence of circumstances does  occur, history is prompt to record the name of the chosen one, and to  hold him up to the admiration of posterity. But when Satan interposes  in human affairs to cast a shadow upon some happy existence, or to  overthrow a kingdom, it seldom happens that he does not find at his side  some miserable tool, in whose ear he has but to whisper a word to set  him at once about his task.    The wretched tool who was at hand to be the agent of this dastardly  plot was one Tyckelaer whom we have already mentioned, a surgeon by  profession.    He lodged an information against Cornelius de Witt, setting forth that  the warden--who, as he had shown by the letters added to his signature,  was fuming at the repeal of the Perpetual Edict--had, from hatred  against William of Orange, hired an assassin to deliver the new Republic  of its new Stadtholder; and he, Tyckelaer was the person thus chosen;  but that, horrified at the bare idea of the act which he was asked to  perpetrate, he had preferred rather to reveal the crime than to commit  it.    This disclosure was, indeed, well calculated to call forth a furious  outbreak among the Orange faction. The Attorney General caused, on the  16th of August, 1672, Cornelius de Witt to be arrested; and the noble  brother of John de Witt had, like the vilest criminal, to undergo, in  one of the apartments of the town prison, the preparatory degrees of  torture, by means of which his judges expected to force from him the  confession of his alleged plot against William of Orange.    But Cornelius was not only possessed of a great mind, but also of a  great heart. He belonged to that race of martyrs who, indissolubly  wedded to their political convictions as their ancestors were to their  faith, are able to smile on pain: while being stretched on the rack, he  recited with a firm voice, and scanning the lines according to measure,  the first strophe of the \"Justum ac tenacem\" of Horace, and, making no  confession, tired not only the strength, but even the fanaticism, of his  executioners.    The judges, notwithstanding, acquitted Tyckelaer from every charge; at  the same time sentencing Cornelius to be deposed from all his offices  and dignities; to pay all the costs of the trial; and to be banished  from the soil of the Republic for ever.    This judgment against not only an innocent, but also a great man,  was indeed some gratification to the passions of the people, to whose  interests Cornelius de Witt had always devoted himself: but, as we shall  soon see, it was not enough.    The Athenians, who indeed have left behind them a pretty tolerable  reputation for ingratitude, have in this respect to yield precedence to  the Dutch. They, at least in the case of Aristides, contented themselves  with banishing him.    John de Witt, at the first intimation of the charge brought against his  brother, had resigned his office of Grand Pensionary. He too received  a noble recompense for his devotedness to the best interests of his  country, taking with him into the retirement of private life the  hatred of a host of enemies, and the fresh scars of wounds inflicted by  assassins, only too often the sole guerdon obtained by honest people,  who are guilty of having worked for their country, and of having  forgotten their own private interests.    In the meanwhile William of Orange urged on the course of events by  every means in his power, eagerly waiting for the time when the people,  by whom he was idolised, should have made of the bodies of the brothers  the two steps over which he might ascend to the chair of Stadtholder.    Thus, then, on the 20th of August, 1672, as we have already stated in  the beginning of this chapter, the whole town was crowding towards the  Buytenhof, to witness the departure of Cornelius de Witt from prison,  as he was going to exile; and to see what traces the torture of the rack  had left on the noble frame of the man who knew his Horace so well.

Masaryk]        INDEPENDENT BOHEMIA    AN ACCOUNT OF THE CZECHO-SLOVAK STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY    By VLADIMIR NOSEK    Secretary to the Czecho-Slovak Legation in LONDON    1918        PREFACE    In the following pages I have attempted to outline the story of our  movement for independence. The manuscript of this book was completed over  four months ago. Since then many important changes have occurred in the  international situation. Chapters in which we dealt with the then still  existing Dual Monarchy must of course be read in the past tense, since  Austria exists no more. And again, many things which we anticipated and  hoped for in the future have already become accomplished facts. However, I  trust that the story itself has not only lost none of its value thereby,  but has acquired an additional interest from a historical point of view.  Our aim of national independence, only quite recently declared by our  adversaries to be \"an empty dream of moonstruck idealists,\" has become  to-day not only a practical proposition, but an accomplished fact. We have  our own army, which is by no means the smallest Allied army, and we also  have our own Provisional Government in Paris, recognised not only by the  Allies and by all Czecho-Slovaks abroad, but even by Czech leaders in  Bohemia, with whom we have since the beginning of the war worked in  complete harmony and understanding. The organisation of our independent  State is rapidly proceeding. Austria-Hungary, exhausted economically and  bankrupt politically, has fallen to pieces by the free-will of her own  subject peoples, who, in anticipation of their early victory, broke their  fetters and openly renounced their allegiance to the hated Habsburg and  Hohenzollern rule, even before Austria had actually surrendered to  the Allies.    Events have moved rapidly in Austria, especially since the momentous  British declaration of August 9, 1918, recognising the  Czecho-Slovaks--those resident in the Allied countries as much as those in  Bohemia--as an Allied nation, and the Czecho-Slovak National Council--in  Paris as well as in Prague--as the Provisional Government of Bohemia.  British statesmen already then foresaw the coming collapse of Austria and  acted accordingly. It is also no more a secret to-day that because of the  promulgation of the British and United States declarations our Council was  able to conclude special conventions with all the Allied Governments during  September last, whereby all the powers exercised by a real government have  been granted to it.    In the meantime Germany had been losing more and more control over her  allies, being herself hard pressed on the Western front, and the  consequence of this was a growing boldness on the part of the Austrian  Slavs. On October 2 deputy Stanek declared in the name of the whole Czech  deputation that the National Council in Paris were their true spokesmen and  representatives with whom Austria would have to negotiate. Soon afterwards  the Austrian Poles went to Warsaw, where they formed a new all-Polish  Government, and the Southern Slavs entrusted the government of their  territories to their National Council in Zagreb. Similar councils were  formed also by the Ruthenes and Rumanians. On October 14 the Czecho-Slovak  National Council in Paris constituted itself as a Government of which the  Council in Prague acts as an integral part. The latter took over the reins  of government in Bohemia a fortnight later. On October 19 the Czecho-Slovak  Council issued a Declaration of Independence which we publish in the  Appendix, and from which it will be seen that Bohemia will be progressive  and democratic both in her domestic and foreign policy. A glorious future  is no doubt awaiting her. She will be specially able to render an immense  service to the League of Nations as a bulwark of peace and conciliation  among the various peoples of Central Europe.    The break-up of Austria will, of course, affect enormously the constitution  of the future Europe, and in our last chapter we have tried to give an  outline of these impending changes of conditions and international  relations. The break-up of Austria was bound to come sooner or later,  whether some misinformed critics or prejudiced pro-Austrian politicians  liked it or not. We ourselves were always convinced, and we declared  openly, that Austria could not survive this war, because she was at war  with the majority of her own subjects, who wished for nothing more than for  her destruction. Unfortunately the fact that the sympathies of the thirty  million of Austrian Slavs and Latins were on the side of the Entente,  constituting such an incontestable moral asset for the Allies as it does,  has not always been fully appreciated by Allied public opinion. We  ourselves, however, never doubted for a moment that the Allied cause would  ultimately triumph and that we would achieve our independence, because we  knew that in struggling for this aim we were only carrying out the  unanimous will of our whole nation. Without waiting for any pledges,  without regard as to which side would be victorious, our nation has from  the beginning staked its all on the Allied victory and has contributed with  all its powers to hasten it. Despite all adverse circumstances, our people,  at first completely at the mercy of their enemies, ruthlessly persecuted  and tortured by them, nevertheless remained firm and resolute. Their  attitude was most outspoken and courageous at all times, and they have also  rendered the Allies active assistance, which is being duly appreciated by  them. It is chiefly due to the efforts of the subject peoples themselves,  of whom the Czechs have certainly been the most outspoken, that the  collapse of Austria has occurred, which finally sealed the fate of  Kaiserism and of the Pan-German plans of Mitteleuropa.    To-day our hopes for a better future are at last being fulfilled as a  result of the Allies' complete victory, assuring the creation of a new and  just international order. Our much-afflicted yet undaunted people already  consider themselves as independent. The Peace Conference, at which the  Czecho-Slovak Government will be represented, will only confirm the  existence of an independent Czecho-Slovak State.    In conclusion, we should like to express our deep gratitude to all our  English friends for their valuable assistance in our struggle for the  realisation of our ideals. We especially wish to thank once more the  British Government for the generous step taken by them in recognising us as  an Allied and belligerent nation. It was chiefly because of this  recognition and of the gallant deeds of our army that we achieved all our  subsequent diplomatic and political successes. We may assure Great Britain  that the Czecho-Slovaks will never forget what they owe to her, and that  they will endeavour to do their best to merit the trust so generously  placed in them.

The Habsburg Empire is built upon centuries-old traditions of reaction  and violence. Its present power is chiefly based on the alliance which  Bohemia and Hungary concluded with Austria against the Turkish peril in  1526. The Czechs freely elected the Habsburgs to the throne of Bohemia  which remained a fully independent state, its alliance with Austria and  Hungary being purely dynastic. But soon the Habsburgs began to violate the  liberties of Bohemia which they were bound by oath to observe, and this led  finally to the fateful Czech revolution of 1618. At the battle of the White  Mountain in 1620 the Czechs suffered a defeat and were cruelly punished for  their rebellion. All their nobility were either executed or sent into  exile, and their property confiscated. The country was devastated by the  imperial hordes, and its population was reduced from 3,000,000 to 800,000  during the Thirty Years' War.    In 1627 Ferdinand II. greatly curtailed the administrative rights of  Bohemia, yet he did not dare to deprive her entirely of her independence.  In his \"Renewed Ordinance of the Land\" Ferdinand declared the Bohemian  crown to be hereditary in the House of Habsburg, and reserved legislative  power to the sovereign. But otherwise the historical rights of Bohemia  remained valid, notwithstanding all subsequent arbitrary centralising  measures taken by the Habsburgs. Bohemia's rights were repeatedly  recognised by each succeeding Habsburg. Legally Bohemia is an"]]]
