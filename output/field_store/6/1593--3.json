Then King Helgi called to him the captain of his ships, who was  hight Leif, and asked him if he had told over the tale of his army.    \"A thing not easy to tell, lord,\" says he, \"on the ships that came out  of Norvi Sound are twelve thousand men, and otherwhere are half as many  again.\"    Then bade King Helgi turn into the firth, called Varin's firth, and they  did so: but now there fell on them so fierce a storm and so huge a sea,  that the beat of the waves on board and bow was to hearken to like as  the clashing together of high hills broken.    But Helgi bade men fear naught, nor take in any sail, but rather hoist  every rag higher than heretofore; but little did they miss of foundering  or ever they made land; then came Sigrun, daughter of King Hogni, down  on to the beach with a great army, and turned them away thence to a good  haven called Gnipalund; but the landsmen see what has befallen and  come down to the sea-shore. The brother of King Hodbrod, lord of a land  called Swarin's Cairn, cried out to them, and asked them who was captain  over that mighty army. Then up stands Sinfjotli, with a helm on his  head, bright shining as glass, and a byrny as white as snow; a spear  in his hand, and thereon a banner of renown, and a gold-rimmed shield  hanging before him; and well he knew with what words to speak to kings--    \"Go thou and say, when thou hast made an end of feeding thy swine and  thy dogs, and when thou beholdest thy wife again, that here are come  the Volsungs, and in this company may King Helgi be found, if Hodbrod  be fain of finding him, for his game and his joy it is to fight and win  fame, while thou art kissing the handmaids by the fire-side.\"    Then answered Granmar, \"In nowise knowest thou how to speak seemly  things, and to tell of matters remembered from of old, whereas thou  layest lies on chiefs and lords; most like it is that thou must have  long been nourished with wolf-meat abroad in the wild-woods, and has  slain thy brethren; and a marvel it is to behold that thou darest to  join thyself to the company of good men and true, thou, who hast sucked  the blood of many a cold corpse.\"    Sinfjotli answered, \"Dim belike is grown thy memory now, of how thou  wert a witch-wife on Varinsey, and wouldst fain have a man to thee, and  chose me to that same office of all the world; and how thereafter thou  wert a Valkyria (1) in Asgarth, and it well-nigh came to this, that for  thy sweet sake should all men fight; and nine wolf whelps I begat on thy  body in Lowness, and was the father to them all.\"    Granmar answers, \"Great skill of lying hast thou; yet belike the father  of naught at all mayst thou be, since thou wert gelded by the giant's  daughters of Thrasness; and lo thou art the stepson of King Siggeir, and  were wont to lie abroad in wilds and woods with the kin of wolves; and  unlucky was the hand wherewith thou slewest thy brethren, making for  thyself an exceeding evil name.\"    Said Sinfjotli, \"Mindest thou not then, when thou were stallion Grani's  mare, and how I rode thee an amble on Bravoll, and that afterwards thou  wert giant Golnir's goat-herd?\"    Granmar says, \"Rather would I feed fowls with the flesh of thee than  wrangle any longer with thee.\"    Then spake King Helgi, \"Better were it for ye, and a more manly deed, to  fight, rather than to speak such things as it is a shame even to hearken  to; Granmar's sons are no friends of me and of mine, yet are they hardy  men none the less.\"    So Granmar rode away to meet King Hodbrod, at a stead called Sunfells,  and the horses of the twain were named Sveipud and Sveggjud. The  brothers met in the castle-porch, and Granmar told Hodbrod of the  war-news. King Hodbrod was clad in a byrny, and had his helm on his  head; he asked--    \"What men are anigh, why look ye so wrathful?\"    Granmar says, \"Here are come the Volsungs, and twelve thousand men of  them are afloat off the coast, and seven thousand are at the island  called Sok, but at the stead called Grindur is the greatest company of  all, and now I deem withal that Helgi and his fellowship have good will  to give battle.\"    Then said the king, \"Let us send a message through all our realm, and go  against them, neither let any who is fain of fight sit idle at home; let  us send word to the sons of Ring, and to King Hogni, and to Alf the Old,  for they are mighty warriors.\"    So the hosts met at Wolfstone, and fierce fight befell there; Helgi  rushed forth through the host of his foes, and many a man fell there; at  last folk saw a great company of shield-maidens, like burning flames to  look on, and there was come Sigrun, the king's daughter. Then King Helgi  fell on King Hodbrod, and smote him, and slew him even under his very  banner; and Sigrun cried out--    \"Have thou thanks for thy so manly deed! now shall we share the land  between us, and a day of great good hap this is to me, and for this deed  shalt thou get honour and renown, in that thou hast felled to earth so  mighty a king.\"    So Helgi took to him that realm and dwelt there long, when he had wedded  Sigrun, and became a king of great honour and renown, though he has  naught more to do with this story.        ENDNOTES:    (1)  Valkyrja, \"Chooser of the elected.\"  The women were so         called whom Odin sent to choose those for death in battle         who were to join the \"Einherjar\" in the hall of the elected,         \"Val-holl.\"        CHAPTER X. The ending of Sinfjotli, Sigmund's Son.    Now the Volsungs fare back home, and have gained great renown by these  deeds. But Sinfjotli betook himself to warfare anew; and therewith he  had sight of an exceeding fair woman, and yearned above all things for  her; but that same woman was wooed also of the brother of Borghild, the  king's wife: and this matter they fought out betwixt them, and Sinfjotli  slew that king; and thereafter he harried far and wide, and had many  a battle and even gained the day; and he became hereby honoured and  renowned above all men; but in autumn tide he came home with many ships  and abundant wealth.    Then he told his tidings to the king his father, and he again to the  queen, and she for her part bids him get him gone from the realm, and  made as if she would in nowise see him. But Sigmund said he would not  drive him away, and offered her atonement of gold and great wealth for  her brother's life, albeit he said he had never erst given weregild  (1) to any for the slaying of a man, but no fame it was to uphold wrong  against a woman.    So seeing she might not get her own way herein, she said, \"Have thy will  in this matter, O my lord, for it is seemly so to be.\"    And now she holds the funeral feast for her brother by the aid and  counsel of the king, and makes ready all things therefor or in the best of  wise, and bade thither many great men.    At that feast, Borghild the queen bare the drink to folk, and she came  over against Sinfjofli with a great horn, and said--    \"Fall to now and drink, fair stepson!\"    Then he took the horn to him, and looked therein, and said--    \"Nay, for the drink is charmed drink\"    Then said Sigmund, \"Give it unto me then;\" and therewith he took the  horn and drank it off.    But the queen said to Sinfjotli, \"Why must other men needs drink thine  ale for thee?\" And she came again the second time with the horn, and  said, \"Come now and drink!\" and goaded him with many words.    And he took the horn, and said--    \"Guile is in the drink.\"    And thereon, Sigmund cried out--    \"Give it then unto me!\"    Again, the third time, she came to him, and bade him drink off his  drink, if he had the heart of a Volsung; then he laid hand on the horn,  but said--    \"Venom is therein.\"    \"Nay, let the lip strain it out then, O son,\" quoth Sigmund; and by then  was he exceeding drunk with drink, and therefore spake he in that wise.    So Sinfjotli drank, and straightway fell down dead to the ground.    Sigmund rose up, and sorrowed nigh to death over him; then he took the  corpse in his arms and fared away to the wood, and went till he came to  a certain firth; and there he saw a man in a little boat; and that man  asked if he would be wafted by him over the firth, and he said yea  thereto; but so little was the boat, that they might not all go in it  at once, so the corpse was first laid therein, while Sigmund went by  the firth-side. But therewith the boat and the man therein vanished away  from before Sigmund's eyes. (2)    So thereafter Sigmund turned back home, and drave away the queen, and a  little after she died. But Sigmund the king yet ruled his realm, and is  deemed ever the greatest champion and king of the old law.        ENDNOTES:    (1)  Weregild, fine for man-slaying (\"wer\", man, and \"gild\", a         payment).    (2)  The man in the boat is Odin, doubtless.        CHAPTER XI. Of King Sigmund's last Battle, and of how he must yield up his  Sword again.    There was a king called Eylimi, mighty and of great fame, and his  daughter was called Hjordis, the fairest and wisest of womankind; and  Sigmund hears it told of her that she was meet to be his wife, yea if  none else were. So he goes to the house of King Eylimi, who would make  a great feast for him, if so be he comes not thither in the guise of  a foe. So messages were sent from one to the other that this present  journey was a peaceful one, and not for war; so the feast was held in  the best of wise and with many a man thereat; fairs were in every place  established for King Sigmund, and all things else were done to the aid  and comfort of his journey: so he came to the feast, and both kings hold  their state in one hall; thither also was come King Lyngi, son of King  Hunding, and he also is a-wooing the daughter of King Eylimi.    Now"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11523"],[0,"Behind the News: Voices from Goa's Press (#10)"],[1,"ome.) That was among Rajan's first personal  impressions of his future employers!    Twenty years is a long enough span for perceptions to  change. But I believe my opinion carried the weight of  near finality with the Patrao. Rajan Narayan would edit  the to-be Herald.    Next morning, we met with the Fernandes, again to work  out a blueprint for the newspaper's editorial  requirements, right down to a list of furniture! From  the way bare essentials were being economized, Rajan  privately kept asking me whether these guys could  really run a newspaper. I kept assuring him they would.  We agreed that together we would keep prodding them if  they wavered. On the way back to the hotel (he was  returning to Mumbai that day), Rajan said I was the  only person he could trust and would I please mail him  on a weekly basis on the progress of implementation of  the agreed blueprint.    This was essential, he explained, because as discussed  and agreed, he would be asking some friends in Mumbai  to quit their secure jobs to join the Herald and he  didn't want to put people in trouble if the paper was,  after all, not going to take off. During the period to  the run up, I wrote and kept Rajan informed of the  progress and, in reply, he kept reminding me to press  the management on the tasks that remained unfulfilled.  Quite a balancing act, for me!    In the course of such weekly back and forth postal  exchanges, Rajan asked for my reiteration that I would  stand with them as one -- if ever the management acted  funny with any of them in future. I presumed he was  concerned with risking his Mumbai team's future. I had  mentioned to Rajan earlier in Goa how the entire  well-knit editorial team at WCT had quit en bloc in the  face of a stubborn management vis-a-vis the workers'  strike. Till now, I had no reason whatever to doubt the  man's integrity. I wrote back, naively in retrospect,  that I was committed to being one with the team and  should one be touched, all would go -- or something to  that effect.    Rajan obviously didn't throw away that letter, as I had  routinely done his.    In time, Rajan returned to Goa -- bag and baggage. His  Mumbai team was to follow once we were staffed and  ready to run dummies. At the wooden-floored 1st storey  Herald office opposite Panjim's Municipal Garden, work  was on at a feverish pace. Rajan and I conducted  interviews for 'subs', reporters and correspondents. We  bagged some gifted hands -- Frederick Noronha, Bosco  Souza Eremita.    On the field, Devika Sequeira was to assist me with  Mumbai's Sushil Silvano on the local crime beat,  together with school chum Nelson Fernandes to cover  sports and Lui Godinho on the camera. I roped in some  old field hands from my WCT days, down to the last  detail of Nandu Zambaulikar, to ferry newspaper bundles  south of the Zuari!    Ticker lines were installed, typewriters and telephones  put in place, and the Mumbai team arrived (I recall  only S. Vaidyanathan on the newsdesk, though). The  machine, finally, began to crank. It was decided we  give readers a preview. One Sunday (or was it another  public holiday?), a few weeks ahead of the formal  launch on October 10, 1983, a special edition was given  out gratis to English-language newspaper readers in  Goa. The edition was packed with features, and news of  the day. I wrote something on bus transport woes of the  Goan commuter, if I recall right.    Dummies began rolling. Agonizingly, I began to see the  penny-wise-pound-foolish dictum again at work (as I  had, in the later stages, of WCT's short life.)  Expensive computers had been brought in but A.C. Fernandes   cribbed on appointing experienced hands as  compositors. A daughter-in-law came in after her own  regular office hours to help at computer keyboards.  John's wife worked late into the nights.    Result was a delightful melange of howlers -- which  continued for a good while after launch of the  newspaper. Every expense, however trivial, had to get  Patrao's direct approval. If Rajan wanted a chair  cushion, he'd have to convince the old man why his  posterior ached! But the good news was, the rumble and  stumble continued without interruption. We were close  to D-day.    That was when one fine sunny morning, as I was about to  cross from the Panjim Municipal Garden pavement to the  Herald office across the street, Raul emerged from the  stationery shop, as if casually, and waved me to hold  back. He crossed the street and invited me for a cup of  tea at a nearby cafe at Jesuit House, Jasmal or Jesema.  Once seated, Raul developed an unusual countenance and  began vaguely referring to the salary that had been  offered to me (Rs.4,000 per mensem.) I imagined there  must have been a family council the previous night. I  reminded him that I had not asked the figure, that I  had merely accepted what was offered -- and that I was  with them in this not for the money, but for a dream to  break a monopoly. I suggested the figure could be revised.    That's when the bombshell broke. \"It's not about the  amount of salary,\" Raul stated, \"it's...\"    \"You mean I'm not wanted here anymore?\" I butted in, in  disbelief. \"You can take it as something like that,\"  Raul said. I was too shocked to even ask why. Having  known Rajan fairly well by now, I instinctively felt  his hand in this. Didn't even feel like meeting the  others at the office or the Patrao at the shop  downstairs. Over the previous several months, I had  worked to virtually midwife the Herald and however much  I may have been, I did not wish to upset the scene when  the baby's umbilical cord was about to go.    I just took the next bus home.    And on that very unpleasant note ended my brief  association with a newspaper that over the last 20  years, tottered, steadied and thrived -- even if in  large measure on the guile and brilliance of one crafty  man, Rajan Narayan.    Without doubt, the oHeraldo marked a new chapter in  English-language journalism in Goa. A lot of latent  young talent found expression. Investigative journalism  got its fair image. Above all, the average Goan reader  now had a choice, and the inherent benefits of  competition. Happily for Goa, the combination at the  right time of the Proprietors and of Rajan Narayan and  some excellent members in the editorial team, clicked.  Despite shoestring budgets and lack of official  advertising patronage in the initial years, the  newspaper survived, cracked a monopoly in a vital area,  and will now shortly enter its 21st year of publication.    I lived and worked in Goa (for myself, of course!)  during these 20 years and saw the manner in which this  one man notched circulation and endeared himself to the  average English-language newspaper reader, especially  of the minority community. Rajan, a crafty  non-practicing politico, in no time had comprehended  the Goan mindset, particularly of the Cristao, as he is  fond of referring.    And the brightest star in his horoscope also arrived in  good time, in the form of the Konkani official language issue.    While other editors dithered, Rajan lost no time in  recognizing the scope of the issue (he had the genuine  backing of his Patrao of course) and almost went  overboard with his undying love for Konkani, Goa and  Cristaos liberally splashed all over the place, for  months without end. With a 'sympathy and empathy' never  before seen, the Mai Bhas formula worked magic for  Rajan -- as it did, I must concede in fairness, to a  couple of other politicos, some with a degree of merit,  like Luizinho (my namesake) and Churchill Alemao. The  true heroes, however, have almost been forgotten!    In fairness, again, it must be conceded that to have  run a newspaper with all of Herald's infrastructural  deficiencies, was no mean feat. There must have been,  in the initial stages, a lot of pain and personal  sacrifice -- but let's also not forget that Rajan was,  those days, without the responsibilities of a family  and with only a pint of Old Monk for company, and the  option to return to Mumbai's drab world of advertising!  He slogged, manipulated, and was rewarded with success.    What, however, happened after such undreamt success hit  the head sooner than Old Monk did, is a story I must  leave best to be told by many a gifted journalist, who  worked with Rajan. At least one such is alas no more in  our midst -- Norman Dantas, son of a former  publisher-partner of Goa Today. Rajan marginalized many  a gifted Goan journo because he perceived them as  threats to his position!    Back to my 1983 story.    It was some seven or eight months after that  uncivilized Cafe Jesema or Jesmal episode that the  mutual friend who had introduced me to the Fernandes  revealed the truth. Rajan Narayan, my trusted senior  colleague, days before the oHeraldo could hit the  newsstands, showed my letter to him on the editorial  team standing as one -- and quitting as one if need  arose -- and convinced the Patrao that here was a snake  already scheming to kill the newspaper before it was  even born! How the intrinsic illogic of this premise --  since the Fernandeses were well aware of my commitment  to the newspaper -- did not strike them, I shall never  know. Rajan had successfully weeded out what he  imagined would be future threat to his position (in  this case, entirely imaginary, since he at the time  knew that I was sooner or later getting into my own  business).    That was the first case. Many were to follow.    Other than weeding out rivals -- real or imagined --  Rajan is believed to have done some pretty nasty things  on the side. He played his reporters one against the  other, to fetch desired coverage of stories that suited  him the most. He is alleged to have killed many a good  story. And all this from behind the mask of being the  self-appointed keeper of Goa's conscience and probity  in her public life. The powerful Stray Thoughts (which,  incidentally, started off"]]]
