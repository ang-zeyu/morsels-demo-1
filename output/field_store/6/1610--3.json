The question became a personal one  between the queen-mother and the minister; and commissioners were  appointed to decide the difference.  Chancellor Duprat was the docile  servant of Louise of Savoy and the enemy of Semblancay, whose authority  in financial matters he envied; and he chose the commissioners from  amongst the mushroom councillors he had lately brought into Parliament.  The question between the queen-mother and the superintendent led to  nothing less than the trial of Semblancay.  The trial lasted five years,  and, on the 9th of April, 1527, a decree of Parliament condemned  Semblancay to the punishment of death and confiscation of all his  property; not for the particular matter which had been the origin of the  quarrel, but \"as attained and convicted of larcenies, falsifications,  abuses, malversations, and maladministration of the king's finances,  without prejudice as to the debt claimed by the said my lady, the mother  of the king.\"  Semblancay, accordingly, was hanged on the gibbet of  Montfaucon, on the 12th of August.  In spite of certain ambiguities which  arose touching some acts of his administration and some details of his  trial, public feeling was generally and very strongly in his favor.  He  was an old and faithful servant of the crown; and Francis I. had for a  long time called him \"his father.\"  He was evidently the victim of the  queen-mother's greed and vengeance.  The firmness of his behavior, at the  time of his execution, became a popular theme in the verses of Clement  Marot:--              When Maillart, officer of hell, escorted            To Montfaucon Semblancay, doomed to die,            Which, to your thinking, of the twain supported            The better havior?  I will make reply:            Maillart was like the man to death proceeding;            And Semblancay so stout an ancient looked,            It seemed, forsooth, as if himself were leading            Lieutenant Maillard--to the gallows booked!    It is said that, at the very moment of execution, Semblancay, waiting on  the scaffold for at least a commutation of the penalty, said, \"Had I  served God as I have served the king, He would not have made me wait so  long.\"  Nearly two centuries later, in 1683, a more celebrated minister  than Semblancay, Colbert, in fact, as he was dying tranquilly in his bed,  after having for twenty years served Louis XIV., and in that service made  the fortune of his family as well as his own, said also, \"Had I done for  God what I have done for yonder man, I had been twice saved; and now I  know not what will become of me.\"  A striking similarity in language and  sentiment, in spite of such different ends, between two great councillors  of kings, both devoted during their lives to the affairs of the world,  and both passing, at their last hour, this severe judgment, as  Christians, upon the masters of the world and upon themselves.    About the same time the government of Francis I. was involved, through  his mother's evil passions, not in an act more morally shameful, but in  an event more politically serious, than the execution of Semblancay.  There remained in France one puissant prince, the last of the feudal  semi-sovereigns, and the head of that only one of the provincial  dynasties sprung from the dynasty of the Capetians which still held its  own against the kingly house.  There were no more Dukes of Burgundy,  Dukes of Anjou, Counts of Provence, and Dukes of Brittany; by good  fortune or by dexterous management the French kingship had absorbed all  those kindred and rival states.  Charles II., Duke of Bourbon, alone was  invested with such power and independence as could lead to rivalry.  He  was in possession of Bourbonness, of Auvergne, of Le Forez, of La Marche,  of Beaujolais, and a large number of domains and castles in different  parts of France.  Throughout all these possessions he levied taxes and  troops, convoked the local estates, appointed the officers of justice,  and regulated almost the whole social organism.  He was born on the 10th  of February, 1490, four years before Francis I.; he was the head of the  younger branch of the Bourbons-Montpensier; and he had married, in 1515,  his cousin, Suzanne of Bourbon, only daughter of Peter II., head of the  elder branch, and Anne of France, the able and for a long while puissant  daughter of Louis XI.  Louis XII. had taken great interest in this  marriage, and it had been stipulated in the contract \"that the pair  should make a mutual and general settlement of all their possessions in  favor of the survivor.\"  Thus the young duke, Charles, had united all the  possessions of the house of Bourbon; and he held at Moulins a brilliant  princely court, of which he was himself the most brilliant ornament.  Having been trained from his boyhood in all chivalrous qualities, he was  an accomplished knight before becoming a tried warrior; and he no sooner  appeared upon the field of battle than he won renown not only as a  valiant prince, but as an eminent soldier.  In 1509, at the battle of  Agnadello, under the eye of Louis XII. himself, he showed that he was a  worthy pupil of La Tremoille, of La Palice, and of Bayard; and in 1512,  at that of Ravenna, his reputation was already so well established in the  army that, when Gaston de Foix was killed, they clamored for Duke Charles  of Bourbon, then twenty-two years old, as his successor.  Louis XII.  gave him full credit for his bravery and his warlike abilities; but the  young prince's unexpansive character, haughty independence, and momentary  flashes of audacity, caused the veteran king some disquietude.  \"I wish,\"  said he, \"he had a more open, more gay, less taciturn spirit; stagnant  water affrights me.\"  In 1516, the year after Louis XII.'s death, Andrew  Trevisani, Venetian ambassador at Milan, wrote to the Venetian council,  \"This Duke of Bourbon handles a sword most gallantly and successfully; he  fears God, he is devout, humane, and very generous; he has a revenue of  one hundred and twenty thousand crowns, twenty thousand from his  mother-in-law, Anne of France, and two thousand a month as constable of  France; and, according to what is said by M. de Longueville, governor of  Paris, he might dispose of half the king's army for any enterprise he  pleased, even if the king did not please.\"    Scarcely had Francis I. ascended the throne, on the 12th of January,  1515, when he made the Duke of Bourbon's great position still greater by  creating him constable of France.  Was it solely to attach to himself the  greatest lord and one of the most distinguished soldiers of the kingdom,  or had, perhaps, as has already been hinted, the favor of the  queen-mother something to do with the duke's speedy elevation?  The whole  history of Charles of Bourbon tends to a belief that the feelings of  Louise of Savoy towards him, her love or her hate, had great influence  upon the decisive incidents of his life.  However that may be, the young  constable, from the moment of entering upon his office, fully justified  the king's choice.    [Illustration: The Constable de Bourbon----53]    He it was who, during the first campaign in Italy, examined in person,  with the shepherd who had pointed it out, an unknown passage across the  Alps; and, on the 13th and 14th of September, he contributed greatly to  the victory of Melegnano.  \"I can assure you,\" wrote Francis I. to his  mother, the regent, \"that my brother the constable and M. de St. Pol  splintered as many lances as any gentlemen of the company whosoever; and  I speak of this as one who saw; they spared themselves as little as if  they had been wild boars at bay.\"  On returning to France the king  appointed the constable governor of conquered Milaness; and to give him a  further mark of favor, \"he granted him the noble privilege of founding  trades in all the towns of the kingdom.  This, when the Parliament  enregistered the king's letters patent, was expressly stated to be in  consideration of Bourbon's extraordinary worth, combined with his quality  as a prince of the blood, and not because of his office of constable.\"  [_Histoire de la Maison de Bourbon,_ by M. Desormeaux, t. ii.  p. 437.]  The constable showed that he was as capable of governing as of  conquering.  He foiled all Emperor Maximilian's attempts to recover  Milaness; and, not receiving from the king money for the maintenance and  pay of his troops, he himself advanced one hundred thousand livres,  opened a loan-account in his own name, raised an army-working-corps of  six thousand men to repair the fortifications of Milan, and obtained from  the Swiss cantons permission to enlist twelve thousand recruits amongst  them.  His exercise of authority over the Lombard population was  sometimes harsh, but always judicious and efficient.  Nevertheless, in  the spring of 1516, eight months after the victory of Melegnano and but  two months after he had driven Emperor Maximilian from Milaness, the Duke  of Bourbon was suddenly recalled, and Marshal de Lautrec was appointed  governor in his place.  When the constable arrived at Lyons, where the  court then happened to be, \"the king,\" says Fleuranges in his Memoires,  \"gave him marvellously good welcome;\" but kings are too ready to imagine  that their gracious words suffice to hide or make up for their acts of  real disfavor; and the Duke of Bourbon was too proud to delude himself.  If he had any desire to do so, the way"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11956"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 6 (#10)"],[1,"he took the  glass; \"just as it shall please God.\"  The remedy appeared to act; the  king recovered a little strength.  The throng of courtiers, which, the  day before, had been crowding to suffocation in the rooms of the Duke of  Orleans, withdrew at once.  Louis XIV. did not delude himself about this  apparent rally.  \"Prayers are offered in all the churches for your  Majesty's life,\" said the parish priest of Versailles.  \"That is not the  question,\" said the king \"it is my salvation that much needs praying  for.\"    Madame de Maintenon had hitherto remained in the back rooms, though  constantly in the king's chamber when he was alone.  He said to her once,  \"What consoles me for leaving you, is that it will not be long before we  meet again.\"  She made no reply.  \"What will become of you?\" he added;  \"you have nothing.\"  \"Do not think of me,\" said she; \"I am nobody; think  only of God.\"  He said farewell to her; she still remained a little while  in his room, and went out when he was no longer conscious.  She had given  away here and there the few movables that belonged to her, and now took  the road to St. Cyr.  On the steps she met Marshal Villeroy.  \"Good by,  marshal,\" she said curtly, and covered up her face in her coifs.  He! it  was who sent her news of the king to the last moment.  The Duke of  Orleans, on becoming regent, went to see her, and took her the patent  (_brevet_) for a pension of sixty thousand livres, \"which her  disinterestedness had made necessary for her,\" said the preamble.  It was  paid her up to the last day of her life.  History makes no further  mention of her name; she never left St. Cyr.  Thither the czar Peter the  Great, when he visited Paris and France, went to see her; she was  confined to her bed; he sat a little while beside her.  \"What is your  malady?\" he asked her through his interpreter.  \"A great age,\" answered  Madame de Maintenon, smiling.  He looked at her a moment longer in  silence; then, closing the curtains, he went out abruptly.  The memory he  would have called up had vanished.  The woman on whom the great king had,  for thirty years, heaped confidence and affection, was old, forgotten,  dying; she expired at St. Cyr on the 15th of April, 1719, at the age of  eighty-three.    She had left the king to die alone.  He was in the agonies; the prayers  in extremity were being repeated around him; the ceremonial recalled him  to consciousness.  He joined his voice with the voices of those present,  repeating the prayers with them.  Already the court was hurrying to the  Duke of Orleans; some of the more confident had repaired to the Duke of  Maine's; the king's servants were left almost alone around his bed; the  tones of the dying man were distinctly heard above the great number of  priests.  He several times repeated, _Nunc et in hora mortis_.  Then he  said, quite loud, \"O, my God, come Thou to help me, haste Thee to succor  me.\"  Those were his last words.  He expired on Sunday, the 1st of  September, 1715, at eight A. M. Next day, he would have been seventy-  seven years of age, and he had reigned seventy-two of them.    In spite of his faults and his numerous and culpable errors, Louis XIV.  had lived and died like a king.  The slow and grievous agony of olden  France was about to begin.    [Illustration: Versailles at Night----52]          CHAPTER LI.----LOUIS XV., THE REGENCY, AND CARDINAL DUBOIS. 1715-1723.    At the very moment when the master's hand is missed from his work,  the narrative makes a sudden bound out of the simple times of history.  Under Henry IV., under Richelieu, under Louis XIV., events found quite  naturally their guiding hand and their centre; men as well as  circumstances formed a group around the head of the nation, whether king  or minister, to thence unfold themselves quite clearly before the eyes of  posterity.  Starting from the reign of Louis XV. the nation has no longer  a head, history no longer a centre; at the same time with a master of the  higher order, great servants also fail the French monarchy; it all at  once collapses, betraying thus the exhaustion of Louis XIV.'s latter  years; decadence is no longer veiled by the remnants of the splendor  which was still reflected from the great king and his great reign; the  glory of olden France descends slowly to its grave.  At the same time,  and in a future as yet obscured, intellectual progress begins to dawn;  new ideas of justice, of humanity, of generous equity towards the masses  germinate sparsely in certain minds; it is no longer Christianity alone  that inspires them, though the honor is reflected upon it in a general  way and as regards the principles with which it has silently permeated  modern society, but they who contribute to spread them, refuse with  indignation to acknowledge the source whence they have drawn them.  Intellectual movement no longer appertains exclusively to the higher  classes, to the ecclesiastics, or to the members of the Parliaments;  vaguely as yet, and retarded by apathy in the government as well as by  disorder in affairs, it propagates and extends itself imperceptibly  pending that signal and terrible explosion of good and evil which is to  characterize the close of the eighteenth century.  Decadence and progress  are going on confusedly in the minds as well as in the material condition  of the nation.  They must be distinguished and traced without any  pretence of separating them.    There we have the reign of Louis XV. in its entirety.    [Illustration: The Regent Orleans----54]    The regency of the Duke of Orleans and the ministry of Cardinal Dubois  showed certain traits of the general tendencies and to a certain extent  felt their influence; they formed, however, a distinct epoch, abounding  in original efforts and bold attempts, which remained without result, but  which testified to the lively reaction in men's minds against the courses  and fundamental principles of the reign which had just ended.    Louis XIV. had made no mistake about the respect which his last wishes  were destined to meet with after his death.  In spite of the most extreme  precautions, the secret of the will had transpired, giving occasion for  some days past to secret intrigues.  Scarcely had the king breathed his  last, when the Duke of Orleans was urged to get the regency conferred  upon him by the dukes and peers, simply making to Parliament an  announcement of what had been done.  The Duke of Orleans was a better  judge of the moral authority belonging to that important body; and it was  to the Palace of Justice that he repaired on the morning of September 2,  1715.  The crowd there was immense; the young king alone was not there,  in spite of his great-grandfather's express instructions.  The day was a  decisive one; the legitimatized princes were present, \"the Duke of Maine  bursting with joy,\" says St. Simon; \"a smiling, satisfied air overrippled  that of audacity, of confidence, which nevertheless peeped through, and  the politeness which seemed to struggle against it.  He bowed right and  left, piercing every one with his looks.  Towards the peers, the  earnestness, it is not too much to say the respectfulness, the slowness,  the profoundness of his bow was eloquent.  His head remained lowered even  on recovering himself.\"  The Duke of Orleans had just begun to speak; his  voice was not steady; he repeated the terms of which the king had made  use, he said, for the purpose of confiding the dauphin to his care.  \"To  you I commend him; serve him faithfully as you have served me, and labor  to preserve to him his kingdom.  I have made such dispositions as I  thought wisest; but one cannot foresee everything; if there is anything  that does not seem good, it will of course be altered.\"    The favor of the assembly was plainly with him, and the prince's accents  became more firm.  \"I shall never,\" said he, \"have any other purpose but  to relieve the people, to reestablish good order in the finances, to  maintain peace at home and abroad, and to restore unity and tranquillity  to the church; therein I shall be aided by the wise representations of  this august assembly, and I hereby ask for them in anticipation.\"  The  Parliament was completely won; the right of representation (or  remonstrance) was promised them; the will of Louis XIV. was as good as  annulled; it was opened, it was read, and so were the two codicils.  All  the authority was intrusted to a council of regency of which the Duke of  Orleans was to be the head, but without preponderating voice and without  power to supersede any of the members, all designated in advance by Louis  XIV.  The person and the education of the young king, as well as the  command of the household troops, were intrusted to the Duke of Maine.    \"It was listened to in dead silence, and with a sort of indignation,  which expressed itself in all countenances,\" says St.  Simon.  \"The king,  no doubt, did not comprehend the force of what he had been made to do,\"  said the Duke of Orleans; \"he assured me in the last days of his life  that I should find in his dispositions nothing that I was not sure to be  pleased with, and he himself referred the ministers to me on business,  with all the orders to be given.\"  He asked, therefore, to have his  regency declared such as it ought to be, \"full and independent, with free  formation of the council of regency.\"  The Duke of Maine wished to say a  word.  \"You shall speak in your turn, Sir,\" said the Duke of Orleans in a  dry tone.  The court immediately decided in his favor by acclamation, and  even without proceeding in the regular way to vote.  There remained the  codicils, which annulled in fact the Regent's authority.  A discussion  began between the Duke of Orleans and the Duke of Maine; it was causing  Philip of Orleans to lose the advantage he had just won; his friends  succeeded in making him perceive this, and he put off the session until  after dinner.
