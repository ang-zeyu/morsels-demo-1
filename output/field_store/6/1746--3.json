The name thus became generic for most goddesses, but all  alike were the lineal descendants of the primitive Earth-mother.[142]    Popular superstition has preserved the memory of these goddesses in the  three _bonnes dames_, _dames blanches_, and White Women, met by  wayfarers in forests, or in the three fairies or wise women of  folk-tales, who appear at the birth of children. But sometimes they have  become hateful hags. The _Matres_ and other goddesses probably survived  in the beneficent fairies of rocks and streams, in the fairy Abonde who  brought riches to houses, or Esterelle of Provence who made women  fruitful, or Aril who watched over meadows, or in beings like Melusine,  Viviane, and others.[143] In Gallo-Roman Britain the cult of the  _Matres_ is found, but how far it was indigenous there is uncertain. A  Welsh name for fairies, _Y Mamau_, \"the Mothers,\" and the phrase, \"the  blessing of the Mothers\" used of a fairy benediction, may be a  reminiscence of such goddesses.[144] The presence of similar goddesses  in Ireland will be considered later.[145] Images of the _Matres_ bearing  a child have sometimes been taken for those of the Virgin, when found  accidentally, and as they are of wood blackened with age, they are known  as _Vierges Noires_, and occupy an honoured place in Christian  sanctuaries. Many churches of Notre Dame have been built on sites where  an image of the Virgin is said to have been miraculously found--the  image probably being that of a pagan Mother. Similarly, an altar to the  _Matres_ at Vaison is now dedicated to the Virgin as the \"good  Mother.\"[146]    In inscriptions from Eastern and Cisalpine Gaul, and from the Rhine and  Danube region, the _Matronae_ are mentioned, and this name is probably  indicative of goddesses like the _Matres_.[147] It is akin to that of  many rivers, e.g. the Marne or Meyrone, and shows that the Mothers were  associated with rivers. The Mother river fertilised a large district,  and exhibited the characteristic of the whole group of goddesses.    Akin also to the _Matres_ are the _Suleviae_, guardian goddesses called  _Matres_ in a few inscriptions; the _Comedovae_, whose name perhaps  denotes guardianship or power; the _Dominae_, who watched over the home,  perhaps the _Dames_ of mediaeval folk-lore; and the _Virgines_, perhaps  an appellative of the _Matres_, and significant when we find that virgin  priestesses existed in Gaul and Ireland.[148] The _Proxumae_ were  worshipped in Southern Gaul, and the _Quadriviae_, goddesses of  cross-roads, at Cherbourg.[149]    Some Roman gods are found on inscriptions without being equated with  native deities. They may have been accepted by the Gauls as new gods, or  they had perhaps completely ousted similar native gods. Others, not  mentioned by Caesar, are equated with native deities, Juno with Clivana,  Saturn with Arvalus, and to a native Vulcan the Celts vowed spoils of  war.[150] Again, many native gods are not equated with Roman deities on  inscriptions. Apart from the divinities of Pyrenaean inscriptions, who  may not be Celtic, the names of over 400 native deities, whether equated  with Roman gods or not, are known. Some of these names are mere  epithets, and most of the gods are of a local character, known here by  one name, there by another. Only in a very few cases can it be asserted  that a god was worshipped over the whole Celtic area by one name, though  some gods in Gaul, Britain, and Ireland with different names have  certainly similar functions.[151]    The pantheon of the continental Celts was a varied one. Traces of the  primitive agricultural rites, and of the priority of goddesses to gods,  are found, and the vaguer aspects of primitive nature worship are seen  behind the cult of divinities of sky, sun, thunder, forests, rivers, or  in deities of animal origin. We come next to evidence of a higher stage,  in divinities of culture, healing, the chase, war, and the underworld.  We see divinities of Celtic groups--gods of individuals, the family, the  tribe. Sometimes war-gods assumed great prominence, in time of war, or  among the aristocracy, but with the development of commerce, gods  associated with trade and the arts of peace came to the front.[152] At  the same time the popular cults of agricultural districts must have  remained as of old. With the adoption of Roman civilisation, enlightened  Celts separated themselves from the lower aspects of their religion, but  this would have occurred with growing civilisation had no Roman ever  entered Gaul. In rural districts the more savage aspects of the cult  would still have remained, but that these were entirely due to an  aboriginal population is erroneous. The Celts must have brought such  cults with them or adopted cults similar to their own wherever they  came. The persistence of these cults is seen in the fact that though  Christianity modified them, it could not root them out, and in  out-of-the-way corners, survivals of the old ritual may still be found,  for everywhere the old religion of the soil dies hard.

He explains Nantosvelta as meaning \"She who is  brilliant in war.\" The goddess, however, has none of the attributes of a  war-goddess. M. D'Arbois also saw in a bas-relief of the hammer-god, a  female figure, and a child, the Gaulish equivalents of Balor, Ethne, and  Lug (_RC_ xv. 236). M. Reinach regards Sucellos, Nantosvelta, and a bird  which is figured with them, as the same trio, because pseudo-Plutarch  (_de Fluv._ vi. 4) says that _lougos_ means \"crow\" in Celtic. This is  more than doubtful. In any case Ethne has no warlike traits in Irish  story, and as Lug and Balor were deadly enemies, it remains to be  explained why they appear tranquilly side by side. See _RC_ xxvi. 129.  Perhaps Nantosvelta, like other Celtic goddesses, was a river nymph.  _Nanto_ Gaulish is \"valley,\" and _nant_ in old Breton is \"gorge\" or  \"brook.\" Her name might mean \"shining river.\" See Stokes, _US_ 193, 324.

"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14674"],[0,"Ten Great Religions: An Essay in Comparative Theology (#10)"],[1," in 1851,  thirteen were over forty years of age, and one under fourteen years; seven  were under twenty; and all, to succeed, must have known by heart the whole  of the Sacred Books, besides being well read in history.    Three sets of themes are given, each occupying two days and a night, and  until that time is expired no one is allowed to leave his apartment, which  is scarcely large enough to sleep in. The essays must not contain more  than seven hundred characters, and no erasure or correction is allowed. On  the first days the themes are taken from the Four Books; on the next, from  the older classics; on the last, miscellaneous questions are given. The  themes are such as these: \"Choo-tsze, in commenting on the Shoo-King, made  use of four authors, who sometimes say too much, at other times too  little; sometimes their explanations are forced, at other times too  ornamental. What have you to observe on them?\" \"Chinshow had great  abilities for historic writing. In his Three Kingdoms he has depreciated  Choo-ko-leang, and made very light of E and E, two other celebrated  characters. What is it that he says of them?\"    These public-service examinations are conducted with the greatest  impartiality. They were established about a thousand years ago, and have  been gradually improved during the intervening time. They form the basis  of the whole system of Chinese government. They make a good education  universally desirable, as the poorest man may see his son thus advanced to  the highest position. All of the hundreds of thousands who prepare to  compete are obliged to know the whole system of Confucius, to commit to  memory all his moral doctrines, and to become familiar with all the  traditional wisdom of the land. Thus a public opinion in favor of existing  institutions and the fundamental ideas of Chinese government is  continually created anew.    What an immense advantage it would be to our own country if we should  adopt this institution of China! Instead of making offices the prize of  impudence, political management, and party services, let them be competed  for by all who consider themselves qualified. Let all offices now given by  appointment be hereafter bestowed on those who show themselves best  qualified to perform the duties. Each class of offices would of course  require a different kind of examination. For some, physical culture as  well as mental might be required. Persons who wished diplomatic situations  should be prepared in a knowledge of foreign languages as well as of  international law. All should be examined on the Constitution and history  of the United States. Candidates for the Post-Office Department should be  good copyists, quick at arithmetic, and acquainted with book-keeping. It  is true that we cannot by an examination obtain a certain knowledge of  moral qualities; but industry, accuracy, fidelity in work would certainly  show themselves. A change from the present corrupt and corrupting system  of appointments to that of competitive examinations would do more just now  for our country than any other measure of reconstruction which can be  proposed. The permanence of Chinese institutions is believed, by those who  know best, to result from the influence of the literary class. Literature  is naturally conservative; the tone of the literature studied is eminently  conservative; and the most intelligent men in the empire are personally  interested in the continuance of the institutions under which they hope to  attain position and fortune.    The highest civil offices are seats at the great tribunals or boards, and  the positions of viceroys, or governors, of the eighteen provinces.    The boards are:--      Ly Pou, Board of Appointment of Mandarins.    Hou Pou, Board of Finance.    Lee Pou, Board of Ceremonies.    Ping Pou, Board of War.    Hing Pou, Board of Criminal Justice.    Kong Pou, Board of Works,--canals, bridges, &c.    The members of these boards, with their councillors and subordinates,  amount to twelve hundred officers. Then there is the Board of Doctors of  the Han Lin College, who have charge of the archives, history of the  empire, &c.; and the Board of Censors, who are the highest mandarins, and  have a peculiar office. Their duty is to stand between the people and the  mandarins, and between the people and the emperor, and even rebuke the  latter if they find him doing wrong. This is rather a perilous duty, but  it is often faithfully performed. A censor, who went to tell the emperor  of some faults, took his coffin with him, and left it at the door of the  palace. Two censors remonstrated with a late emperor on the expenses of  his palace, specifying the sums uselessly lavished for perfumes and  flowers for his concubines, and stating that a million of taels of silver  might be saved for the poor by reducing these expenses. Sung, the  commissioner who attended Lord Macartney, remonstrated with the Emperor  Kiaking on his attachment to play-actors and strong drink, which degraded  him in the eyes of the people. The emperor, highly irritated, asked him  what punishment he deserved for his insolence. \"Quartering,\" said Sung.  \"Choose another,\" said the emperor. \"Let me be beheaded.\" \"Choose again,\"  said the emperor; and Sung asked to be strangled. The next day the emperor  appointed him governor of a distant province,--afraid to punish him for  the faithful discharge of his duty, but glad to have him at a distance.  Many such anecdotes are related, showing that there is some moral courage  in China.    The governor of a province, or viceroy, has great power. He also is chosen  from among the mandarins in the way described. The only limitations of his  power are these: he is bound to make a full report every three years of  the affairs of the province, _and give in it an account of his own  faults,_ and if he omits any, and they are discovered in other ways, he is  punished by degradation, bambooing, or death. It is the right of any  subject, however humble, to complain to the emperor himself against any  officer, however high; and for this purpose a large drum is placed at one  of the palace gates. Whoever strikes it has his case examined under the  emperor's eye, and if he has been wronged, his wrongs are redressed, but  if he has complained unnecessarily, he is severely punished. Imperial  visitors, sent by the Board of Censors, may suddenly arrive at any time to  examine the concerns of a province; and a governor or other public officer  who is caught tripping is immediately reported and punished.    Thus the political institutions of China are built on literature.  Knowledge is the road to power and wealth. All the talent and knowledge of  the nation are interested in the support of institutions which give to  them either power or the hope of it. And these institutions work well. The  machinery is simple, but it produces a vast amount of happiness and  domestic virtue. While in most parts of Asia the people are oppressed by  petty tyrants, and ground down by taxes,--while they have no motive to  improve their condition, since every advance will only expose them to  greater extortion,--the people of China are industrious and happy. In no  part of the world has agriculture been carried to such perfection. Every  piece of ground in the cultivated parts of the empire, except those  portions devoted to ancestral monuments, is made to yield two or three  crops annually, by the careful tillage bestowed on it. The ceremony of  opening the soil at the beginning of the year, at which the emperor  officiates, originated two thousand years ago. Farms are small,--of one or  two acres,--and each family raises on its farm all that it consumes. Silk  and cotton are cultivated and manufactured in families, each man spinning,  weaving, and dyeing his own web. In the manufacture of porcelain, on the  contrary, the division of labor is carried very far. The best is made at  the village of Kiangsee, which contains a million of inhabitants. Seventy  hands are sometimes employed on a single cup. The Chinese are very  skilful in working horn and ivory. Large lanterns are made of horn,  transparent and without a flaw. At Birmingham men have tried with machines  to cut ivory in the same manner as the Chinese, and have failed.        Sec. 3. Life and Character of Confucius.      Of this nation the great teacher for twenty-three centuries has been  Confucius. He was born 551 B.C., and was contemporary with the Tarquins,  Pythagoras, and Cyrus. About his time occurred the return of the Jews from  Babylon and the invasion of Greece by Xerxes. His descendants have always  enjoyed high privileges, and there are now some forty thousand of them in  China, seventy generations and more removed from their great ancestor. His  is the oldest family in the world, unless we consider the Jews as a single  family descended from Abraham. His influence, through his writings, on the  minds of so many millions of human beings is greater than that of any man  who ever lived, excepting the writers of the Bible; and in saying this we  do not forget the names of Mohammed, Aristotle, St. Augustine, and Luther.  So far as we can see, it is the influence of Confucius which has  maintained, though probably not originated, in China, that profound  reverence for parents, that strong family affection, that love of order,  that regard for knowledge and deference for literary men, which are  fundamental principles underlying all the Chinese institutions. His minute  and practical system of morals, studied as it is by all the learned, and  constituting the sum of knowledge and the principle of government in  China, has exerted and exerts an influence on that innumerable people  which it is impossible to estimate, but which makes us admire the power  which can emanate from a single soul.    To exert such an influence requires greatness. If the tree is to be known  by its fruits, Confucius must have been one of"]]]
