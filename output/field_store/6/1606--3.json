He's the one who's kept her in that house. He's the  one that knew we were here watching all the time, that sent out the  girl with exact orders how she should act if you was to come out and  speak to her when you seen her! Bill, what that girl told you didn't  come out of her own head. It come out of the head of the gent across  the way. When you turned your back on her she looked like she'd run  after you and try to explain. But the fear of that fellow up in the  window was too much for her, and she didn't dare. Bill, to get at the  girl you got to get that gent I seen grinning from the window.\"    \"Grinning?\" asked Bill Gregg, grinding his teeth and starting from his  chair. \"Was the skunk laughing at me?\"    \"Sure! Every minute.\"    Bill Gregg groaned. \"I'll smash every bone in his ugly head.\"    \"Shake!\" said Ronicky Doone. \"That's the sort of talk I wanted to  hear, and I'll help, Bill. Unless I'm away wrong, it'll take the best  that you and me can do, working together, to put that gent down!\"          Chapter Nine      _A Bold Venture_    But how to reach that man of the smile and the sneer, how, above all,  to make sure that he was really the power controlling Caroline Smith,  were problems which could not be solved in a moment.    Bill Gregg contributed one helpful idea. \"We've waited a week to see  her; now that we've seen her let's keep on waiting,\" he said, and  Ronicky agreed.    They resumed the vigil, but it had already been prolonged for such a  length of time that it was impossible to keep it as strictly as it had  been observed before. Bill Gregg, outworn by the strain of the long  watching and the shock of the disappointment of that day, went  completely to pieces and in the early evening fell asleep. But Ronicky  Doone went out for a light dinner and came back after dark, refreshed  and eager for action, only to find that Bill Gregg was incapable of  being roused. He slept like a dead man.    Ronicky went to the window and sat alone. Few of the roomers were home  in the house opposite. They were out for the evening, or for dinner,  at least, and the face of the building was dark and cold, the light  from the street lamp glinting unevenly on the windowpanes. He had sat  there staring at the old house so many hours in the past that it was  beginning to be like a face to him, to be studied as one might study  a human being. And the people it sheltered, the old hag who kept the  door, the sneering man and Caroline Smith, were to the house like the  thoughts behind a man's face, an inscrutable face. But, if one cannot  pry behind the mask of the human, at least it is possible to enter a  house and find--    At this point in his thoughts Ronicky Doone rose with a quickening  pulse. Suppose he, alone, entered that house tonight by stealth, like  a burglar, and found what he could find?    He brushed the idea away. Instantly it returned to him. The danger of  the thing, and danger there certainly would be in the vicinity of  him of the sardonic profile, appealed to him more and more keenly.  Moreover, he must go alone. The heavy-footed Gregg would be a poor  helpmate on such an errand of stealth.    Ronicky turned away from the window, turned back to it and looked once  more at the tall front of the building opposite; then he started to  get ready for the expedition.    The preparations were simple. He put on a pair of low shoes, very  light and with rubber heels. In them he could move with the softness  and the speed of a cat. Next he dressed in a dark-gray suit, knowing  that this is the color hardest to see at night. His old felt hat he  had discarded long before in favor of the prevailing style of the  average New Yorker. For this night expedition he put on a cap which  drew easily over his ears and had a long visor, shadowing the upper  part of his face. Since it might be necessary to remain as invisible  as possible, he obscured the last bit of white that showed in his  costume, with a black neck scarf.    Then he looked in the glass. A lean face looked back at him, the eyes  obscured under the cap, a stern, resolute face, with a distinct threat  about it. He hardly recognized himself in the face in the glass.    He went to his suit case and brought out his favorite revolver. It was  a long and ponderous weapon to be hidden beneath his clothes, but to  Ronicky Doone that gun was a friend well tried in many an adventure.  His fingers went deftly over it. It literally fell to pieces at his  touch, and he examined it cautiously and carefully in all its parts,  looking to the cartridges before he assembled the weapon again. For,  if it became necessary to shoot this evening, it would be necessary to  shoot to kill.    He then strolled down the street, passing the house opposite, with a  close scrutiny. A narrow, paved sidewalk ran between it and the house  on its right, and all the windows opening on this small court were  dark. Moreover, the house which was his quarry was set back several  feet from the street, an indentation which would completely hide him  from anyone who looked from the street. Ronicky made up his mind at  once. He went to the end of the block, crossed over and, turning back  on the far side of the street, slipped into the opening between the  houses.    Instantly he was in a dense darkness. For five stories above him the  two buildings towered, shutting out the starlight. Looking straight up  he found only a faint reflection of the glow of the city lights in the  sky.    At last he found a cellar window. He tried it and found it locked, but  a little maneuvering with his knife enabled him to turn the catch at  the top of the lower sash. Then he raised it slowly and leaned into  the blackness. Something incredibly soft, tenuous, clinging, pressed  at once against his face. He started back with a shudder and brushed  away the remnants of a big spider web.    Then he leaned in again. It was an intense blackness. The moment his  head was in the opening the sense of listening, which is ever in a  house, came to him. There were the strange, musty, underground odors  which go with cellars and make men think of death.    However, he must not stay here indefinitely. To be seen leaning in at  this window was as bad as to be seen in the house itself. He slipped  through the opening at once, and beneath his feet there was a soft  crunching of coal. He had come directly into the bin. Turning, he  closed the window, for that would be a definite clue to any one who  might pass down the alley.    As he stood surrounded by that hostile silence, that evil darkness,  he grew somewhat accustomed to the dimness, and he could make out not  definite objects, but ghostly outlines. Presently he took out the  small electric torch which he carried and examined his surroundings.    The bin had not yet received the supply of winter coal and was almost  empty. He stepped out of it into a part of the basement which had been  used apparently for storing articles not worth keeping, but too good  to be thrown away--an American habit of thrift. Several decrepit  chairs and rickety cabinets and old console tables were piled together  in a tangled mass. Ronicky looked at them with an unaccountable  shudder, as if he read in them the history of the ruin and fall and  death of many an old inhabitant of this house. It seemed to his  excited imagination that the man with the sneer had been the cause of  all the destruction and would be the cause of more.    He passed back through the basement quickly, eager to be out of the  musty odors and his gloomy thoughts. He found the storerooms, reached  the kitchen stairs and ascended at once. Halfway up the stairs, the  door above him suddenly opened and light poured down at him. He saw  the flying figure of a cat, a broom behind it, a woman behind the  broom.    \"Whisht! Out of here, dirty beast!\"    The cat thudded against Ronicky's knee, screeched and disappeared  below; the woman of the broom shaded her eyes and peered down the  steps. \"A queer cat!\" she muttered, then slammed the door.    It seemed certain to Ronicky that she must have seen him, yet he  knew that the blackness of the cellar had probably half blinded her.  Besides, he had drawn as far as possible to one side of the steps, and  in this way she might easily have overlooked him.    In the meantime it seemed that this way of entering the house was  definitely blocked. He paused a moment to consider other plans, but,  while he stayed there in thought, he heard the rattle of pans. It  decided him to stay a while longer. Apparently she was washing the  cooking utensils, and that meant that she was near the close of her  work for the evening. In fact, the rim of light, which showed between  the door frame and the door, suddenly snapped out, and he heard her  footsteps retreating.    Still he delayed a moment or two, for fear she might return to take  something which she had forgotten. But the silence deepened above him,  and voices were faintly audible toward the front of the house.    That decided Ronicky. He opened the door, blessing the well-oiled  hinges which kept it from making any noise, and let a shaft from his  pocket lantern flicker across the kitchen floor. The light glimmered  on the newly scrubbed surface and showed him a door to his right,  opening into the main part of the house.    He passed through it at once and sighed with relief when his foot  touched the carpet on the hall beyond. He noted, too, that there was  no sign of a creak from the boards beneath his tread. However old  that house might be, he was a noble carpenter who laid the flooring,  Ronicky thought, as he slipped through the semi-gloom. For there was  a small hall light toward the front, and it gave him an uncertain  illumination, even at the rear of the passage.    Now that he was definitely committed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11894"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#10)"],[1,"ood, without  sustaining any injury, for, O best of men and mighty-armed one, Bhima's  days had not been ended! O Krishna, it is Duryodhana who at the house  standing by the banyan called _Pramana_ bound Bhima sleeping  unsuspectingly, and casting him into the Ganges returned to the city.  But the powerful Bhimasena the son of Kunti, possessed of mighty arms,  on waking from sleep, tore his bonds and rose from the water. It is  Duryodhana, who caused venomous black cobras to bite all over the body  of Bhimasena, but that slayer of foes died not. Awaking, the son of  Kunti smashed all the serpents and with his left hand killed (the agent,  _viz_.) the favourite charioteer of Duryodhana. Again, while the  children were asleep at Varanavata with their mother, it is he who set  fire to the house intending to burn them to death. Who is there capable  of doing such an act? It was then that the illustrious Kunti, overtaken  by this calamity, and surrounded by the flames, began to cry out in  terror, speaking to the children, \"Alas, I am undone! How shall we  escape from this fire today! Alas, I shall meet with destruction with my  little children!\" Then Bhima, possessed of mighty arms, and prowess like  unto the force of the wind, comforted his illustrious mother as also his  brothers, saying, \"Like that king of birds, Garuda, the son of Vinata, I  will spring up into the air. We have no fear from this fire.\" And then  taking his mother on his left flank, and the king in his right, and the  twins on each shoulder, and Vibhatsu on his back, the mighty Vrikodara,  thus taking all of them, at one leap cleared the fire and delivered his  mother and brother from the conflagration. Setting out that night with  their renowned mother, they came near the forest of Hidimva. And while  fatigued and distressed, they were sleeping fast with her, a Rakshasa  woman called Hidimva approached them. Beholding the Pandavas with their  mother asleep on the ground, influenced by desire she sought to have  Bhimasena for her lord. The weak one then took up Bhima's feet on her  lap to press them with her soft hands. The mighty Bhima of immeasurable  energy, of prowess that could not be baffled, then woke from sleep, and  asked her, saying, \"O thou of faultless features, what dost thou wish  here?\" Thus asked by him, the Rakshasa lady of faultless features,  capable, besides, of assuming any form at will, replied unto the  high-souled Bhima, saying, \"Do ye speedily fly from this place! My  brother gifted with strength will come to slay ye! Therefore speed and  tarry not!\" But Bhima haughtily said, \"I do not fear him! If he cometh  here, I will slay him!\" Hearing their converse, that vilest of cannibals  came to the spot. Of frightful form and dreadful to behold, uttering  loud cries as he came, the Rakshasa said, \"O Hidimva, with whom dost  thou converse? Bring him unto me, I will eat him up. It behoveth thee to  tarry not.\" But moved by compassion, the Rakshasa lady of faultless  features and pure heart said nothing out of pity. Then the man-eating  monster, uttering dreadful cries, rushed at Bhima with great force. And  approaching him furiously, the mighty cannibal, possessed with rage,  caught hold of Bhima's hand with his own and clenching fast his other  hand and making it hard as the thunder-bolt of Indra, suddenly struck  Bhima a blow that descended with the force of lightning. His hand having  been seized by the Rakshasa, Vrikodara, without being able to brook it,  flew into a rage. Then a dreadful combat took place between Bhimasena  and Hidimva, both skilled in all weapons and which was like unto the  encounter of Vasava with Vritra. And, O sinless one, after sporting with  the Rakshasa for a long while the powerful Bhima of mighty energy slew  the cannibal when the latter had become weak with exertion. Then having  slain Hidimva, and taking (his sister) Hidimva at their head, of whom  was (subsequently) born Ghatotkacha, Bhima and his brothers went away.  Then all those repressers of their foes, accompanied by their mother and  surrounded by many Brahmanas proceeded towards Ekachakra. In the matter  of this their journey, Vyasa ever engaged in their welfare had become  their counsellor. Then arriving at Ekachakra, the Pandavas of rigid vows  there also slew a mighty cannibal, Vaka by name, terrible as Hidimva  himself. And having slain that fierce cannibal, Bhima that foremost of  smiters, went with all his brothers to the capital of Drupada. And, O  Krishna, as thou hadst acquired Rukmim, the daughter of Bhishmaka, even  so Savyasachin, while residing there, obtained me! O slayer of Madhu,  Arjuna won me in the _Swayamvara_, having performed a feat difficult of  achievement by others and having fought also with the assembled kings!    \"'Thus, O Krishna, afflicted with numerous griefs, and in great  distress, am I living, with Dhaumya at our head, but deprived of the  company of the adorable Kunti! Why do these that are gifted with  strength and possessed of the prowess of the lion, sit indifferently,  beholding me thus afflicted by enemies so despicable? Suffering such  wrongs at the hands of wicked and evil-doing foes of small strength, am  I to burn in grief so long? Born I was in a great race, coming into the  world in an extraordinary way! I am also the beloved wife of the  Pandavas, and the daughter-in-law of the illustrious Pandu! The foremost  of women and devoted to my husbands, even I, O Krishna, was seized by  hair, O slayer of Madhu, in the sight of the Pandavas, each of whom is  like an Indra himself!'    \"Saying this the mild-speeched Krishna hid her face with her soft hands  like the buds of lotus, and began to weep. And the tears of Panchali  begot of grief washed her deep, plump and graceful breasts crowned with  auspicious marks. And wiping her eyes and sighing frequently she said  these words angrily and in a choked voice, 'Husbands, or sons, or  friends, or brothers, or father, have I none! Nor have I thee, O thou  slayer of Madhu, for ye all, beholding me treated so cruelly by inferior  foes, sit still unmoved! My grief at Karna's ridicule is incapable of  being assuaged! On these grounds I deserve to be ever protected by thee,  O Kesava, _viz_., our relationship, thy respect (for me), our  friendship, and thy lordship (over me).'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"In that assembly of heroes Vasudeva then spake  unto the weeping Draupadi as follows, 'O fair lady, the wives of those  with whom thou art angry, shall weep even like thee, beholding their  husbands dead on the ground, weltering in blood and their bodies covered  with the arrows of Vivatsu! Weep not, lady, for I will exert to the  utmost of my powers for the sons of Pandu! I promise thou shalt (once  more) be the queen of kings! The heavens might fall, or the Himavat  might split, the earth might be rent, or the waters of the ocean might  dry up, but my words shall never be futile!' Hearing those words of  Achyuta in reply, Draupadi looked obliquely at her third husband  (Arjuna). And, O mighty king, Arjuna said unto Draupadi, 'O thou of  beautiful coppery eyes, grieve not! O illustrious one, it shall be even  as the slayer of Madhu hath said! It can never be otherwise, O beautiful  one!'    \"Dhrishtadyumna said, 'I will slay Drona, Sikhandin will slay the  grandfather. And Bhimasena will slay Duryodhana, and Dhananjaya will  slay Karna. And, O sister, assisted by Rama and Krishna, we are  invincible in battle by even the slayer himself of Vritra--what are the  sons of Dhritarashtra?'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"After these words had been spoken, all the  heroes there turned their faces towards Vasudeva, who then in their  midst began to speak as follows.\"      SECTION XIII    \"Vasudeva said, 'O lord of earth, if I had been present at Dwaraka,  then, O king, this evil would not have befallen thee! And, O  irrepressible one, coming unto the gambling-match, even if uninvited by  the son of Amvika (Dhritarashtra), or Duryodhana, or by the other  Kauravas, I would have prevented the game from taking place, by showing  its many evils, summoning to my aid Bhishma and Drona and Kripa, and  Vahlika! O exalted one, for thy sake I would have told the son of  Vichitravirya--_O foremost of monarchs, let thy sons have nothing to do  with dice!_--I would have shown the many evils (of dice) through which  thou hast fallen into such distress and the son of Virasena was formerly  deprived of his kingdom! O king, unthought-of evils, befall a man from  dice! I would have described how a man once engaged in the game  continueth to play (from desire of victory). Women, dice, hunting and  drinking to which people become addicted in consequence of temptation,  have been regarded as the four evils that deprive a man of prosperity.  And those versed in the _Sastras_ are of opinion that evils attend upon  all these. They also that are addicted to dice know all its evils. O  thou of mighty arms, appearing before the son of Amvika, I would have  pointed out that through dice men in a day lose their possessions, and  fall into distress, and are deprived of their untasted wealth, and  exchange harsh words! O perpetuator of the Kuru race, I would have  pointed out these and other attendant evils! If he had accepted my words  thus addressed, the welfare of the Kurus as also virtue itself would  both have been secured! And, O foremost of kings, if he had rejected my  gentle counsels offered as medicine, then, O best of the Bharata race, I  would have compelled him by force! And, if those who wait at his court,  professing to be his friends but in reality his foes, had supported him,  then I would have slain them all, along with those gamblers, there  present! O Kauravya, it is owing to my absence from the _Anartta_  country at that time that thou hast fallen into such distress begot of  dice!
