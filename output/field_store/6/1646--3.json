Some of these, notably the hydroxide,  combine with acids and contribute to the total alkaline strength,  but it is customary to calculate this strength in terms of sodium  carbonate; i.e., as though no other alkali were present.    PROCEDURE.--In order to secure a sample which shall represent the  average value of the ash, it is well to take at least 5 grams. As this  is too large a quantity for convenient titration, an aliquot portion  of the solution is measured off, representing one fifth of the entire  quantity. This is accomplished as follows: Weigh out on an analytical  balance two samples of soda ash of about 5 grams each into beakers  of about 500 cc. capacity. (The weighings need be made to centigrams  only.) Dissolve the ash in 75 cc. of water, warming gently, and filter  off the insoluble residue; wash the filter by filling it at least  three times with distilled water, and allowing it to drain, adding the  washings to the main filtrate. Cool the filtrate to approximately the  standard temperature of the laboratory, and transfer it to a 250 cc.  measuring flask, washing out the beaker thoroughly. Add distilled  water of laboratory temperature until the lowest point of the meniscus  is level with the graduation on the neck of the flask and remove any  drops of water that may be on the neck above the graduation by means  of a strip of filter paper; make the solution thoroughly uniform by  pouring it out into a dry beaker and back into the flask several  times. Measure off 50 cc. of the solution in a measuring flask, or  pipette, either of which before use should, unless they are dry on the  inside, be rinsed out with at least two small portions of the soda ash  solution to displace any water.    If a flask is used, fill it to the graduation with the soda ash  solution and remove any liquid from the neck above the graduation with  filter paper. Empty it into a beaker, and wash out the small flask,  unless it is graduated for !delivery!, using small quantities of  water, which are added to the liquid in the beaker. A second 50 cc.  portion from the main solution should be measured off into a second  beaker. Dilute the solutions in each beaker to 100 cc., add two drops  of a solution of methyl orange (Note 1) and titrate for the alkali  with the standard hydrochloric acid solution, using the alkali  solution to complete the titration as already prescribed.    From the volumes of acid and alkali employed, corrected for burette  errors and temperature changes, and the data derived from the  standardization, calculate the percentage of alkali present, assuming  it all to be present as sodium carbonate (Note 2).    [Note 1: The hydrochloric acid sets free carbonic acid which is  unstable and breaks down into water and carbon dioxide, most of which  escapes from the solution. Carbonic acid is a weak acid and, as such,  does not yield a sufficient concentration of H^{+} ions to cause the  indicator to change to a pink (see page 32).    The chemical changes involved may be summarized as follows:    2H^{+}, 2Cl^{-} + 2Na^{+}, CO_{3}^{--} --> 2Na^{+}, 2Cl^{-} +  [H_{2}CO_{3}] --> H_{2}O + CO_{2}]    [Note 2: A determination of the alkali present as hydroxide in soda  ash may be determined by precipitating the carbonate by the addition  of barium chloride, removing the barium carbonate by filtration, and  titrating the alkali in the filtrate.    The caustic alkali may also be determined by first using  phenolphthalein as an indicator, which will show by its change from  pink to colorless the point at which the caustic alkali has been  neutralized and the carbonate has been converted to bicarbonate, and  then adding methyl orange and completing the titration. The amount of  acid necessary to change the methyl orange to pink is a measure of one  half of the carbonate present. The results of the double titration  furnish the data necessary for the determination of the caustic alkali  and of the carbonate in the sample.]          DETERMINATION OF THE ACID STRENGTH OF OXALIC ACID      PROCEDURE.--Weigh out two portions of the acid of about 1 gram  each. Dissolve these in 50 cc. of warm water. Add two drops of  phenolphthalein solution, and run in alkali from the burette until the  solution is pink; add acid from the other burette until the pink is  just destroyed, and then add 0.3 cc. (not more) in excess. Heat the  solution to boiling for three minutes. If the pink returns during the  boiling, discharge it with acid and again add 0.3 cc. in excess and  repeat the boiling (Note 1). If the color does not then reappear, add  alkali until it does, and a !drop or two! of acid in excess and boil  again for one minute (Note 2). If no color reappears during this time,  complete the titration in the hot solution. The end-point should be  the faintest visible shade of color (or its disappearance), as the  same difficulty would exist here as with methyl orange if an attempt  were made to match shades of pink.    From the corrected volume of alkali required to react with the  oxalic acid, calculate the percentage of the crystallized acid  (H_{2}C_{2}O_{4}.2H_{2}O) in the sample (Note 3).    [Note 1: All commercial caustic soda such as that from which the  standard solution was made contains some sodium carbonate. This reacts  with the oxalic acid, setting free carbonic acid, which, in turn,  forms sodium bicarbonate with the remaining carbonate:    H_{2}CO_{3} + Na_{2}CO_{3} --> 2HNaCO_{3}.    This compound does not hydrolyze sufficiently to furnish enough OH^{-}  ions to cause phenolphthalein to remain pink; hence, the color of  the indicator is discharged in cold solutions at the point at which  bicarbonate is formed. If, however, the solution is heated to boiling,  the bicarbonate loses carbon dioxide and water, and reverts to sodium  carbonate, which causes the indicator to become again pink:    2HNaCO_{3} --> H_{2}O + CO_{2} + Na_{2}CO_{3}.    By adding successive portions of hydrochloric acid and boiling, the  carbonate is ultimately all brought into reaction.    The student should make sure that the difference in behavior of the  two indicators, methyl orange and phenolphthalein, is understood.]    [Note 2: Hydrochloric acid is volatilized from aqueous solutions,  except such as are very dilute. If the directions in the procedure  are strictly followed, no loss of acid need be feared, but the amount  added in excess should not be greater than 0.3-0.4 cc.]    [Note 3: Attention has already been called to the fact that the color  changes in the different indicators occur at varying concentrations  of H^{+} or OH^{-} ions. They do not indicate exact theoretical  neutrality, but a particular indicator always shows its color change  at a particular concentration of H^{+} or OH^{-} ions. The results  of titration with a given indicator are, therefore, comparable. As a  matter of fact, a small error is involved in the procedure as outlined  above. The comparison of the acid and alkali solutions was made, using  methyl orange as an indicator, while the titration of the oxalic acid  is made with the use of phenolphthalein. For our present purposes the  small error may be neglected but, if time permits, the student is  recommended to standardize the alkali solution against one of the  substances named in Note 1, page 41, and also to ascertain  the comparative value of the acid and alkali solutions, using  phenolphthalein as indicator throughout, and conducting the titrations  as described above. This will insure complete accuracy.]          II. OXIDATION PROCESSES    GENERAL DISCUSSION      In the oxidation processes of volumetric analysis standard solutions  of oxidizing agents and of reducing agents take the place of the acid  and alkali solutions of the neutralization processes already studied.  Just as an acid solution was the principal reagent in alkalimetry, and  the alkali solution used only to make certain of the end-point, the  solution of the oxidizing agent is the principal reagent for the  titration of substances exerting a reducing action. It is, in general,  true that oxidizable substances are determined by !direct! titration,  while oxidizing substances are determined by !indirect! titration.    The important oxidizing agents employed in volumetric solutions are  potassium bichromate, potassium permangenate, potassium ferricyanide,  iodine, ferric chloride, and sodium hypochlorite.    The important reducing agents which are used in the form of standard  solutions are ferrous sulphate (or ferrous ammonium sulphate), oxalic  acid, sodium thiosulphate, stannous chloride, arsenious acid, and  potassium cyanide. Other reducing agents, as sulphurous acid,  sulphureted hydrogen, and zinc (nascent hydrogen), may take part in  the processes, but not as standard solutions.    The most important combinations among the foregoing are: Potassium  bichromate and ferrous salts; potassium permanganate and ferrous  salts; potassium permanganate and oxalic acid, or its derivatives;  iodine and sodium thiosulphate; hypochlorites and arsenious acid.          BICHROMATE PROCESS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF IRON      Ferrous salts may be promptly and completely oxidized to ferric salts,  even in cold solution, by the addition of potassium bichromate,  provided sufficient acid is present to hold in solution the ferric and  chromic compounds which are formed.    The acid may be either hydrochloric or sulphuric, but the former is  usually preferred, since it is by far the best solvent for iron and  its compounds. The reaction in the presence of hydrochloric acid is as  follows:    6FeCl_{2} + K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} + 14HCl --> 6FeCl_{3} + 2CrCl_{3} + 2KCl  + 7H_{2}O.

While frosty winds blaw in the drift,       Ben to the chimla lug,       I grudge a wee the great-folk's gift,       That live sae bien an' snug:       I tent less, and want less       Their roomy fire-side;       But hanker, and canker,       To see their cursed pride.

Think ye, that sic as you and I,       Wha drudge an' drive thro' wet and dry,       Wi' never-ceasing toil;       Think ye, are we less blest than they,       Wha scarcely tent us in their way,       As hardly worth their while?
