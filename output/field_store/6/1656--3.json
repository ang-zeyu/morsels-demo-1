Venters glanced at the drooping horse, there were no gun-sheaths on the  saddle.    \"A rustler who didn't pack guns!\" muttered Venters. \"He wears no belt.  He couldn't pack guns in that rig.... Strange!\"    A low, gasping intake of breath and a sudden twitching of body told  Venters the rider still lived.    \"He's alive!... I've got to stand here and watch him die. And I shot an  unarmed man.\"    Shrinkingly Venters removed the rider's wide sombrero and the black  cloth mask. This action disclosed bright chestnut hair, inclined to  curl, and a white, youthful face. Along the lower line of cheek and jaw  was a clear demarcation, where the brown of tanned skin met the white  that had been hidden from the sun.    \"Oh, he's only a boy!... What! Can he be Oldring's Masked Rider?\"    The boy showed signs of returning consciousness. He stirred; his lips  moved; a small brown hand clenched in his blouse.    Venters knelt with a gathering horror of his deed. His bullet had  entered the rider's right breast, high up to the shoulder. With hands  that shook, Venters untied a black scarf and ripped open the blood-wet  blouse.    First he saw a gaping hole, dark red against a whiteness of skin, from  which welled a slender red stream. Then the graceful, beautiful swell of  a woman's breast!    \"A woman!\" he cried. \"A girl!... I've killed a girl!\"    She suddenly opened eyes that transfixed Venters. They were fathomless  blue. Consciousness of death was there, a blended terror and pain, but  no consciousness of sight. She did not see Venters. She stared into the  unknown.    Then came a spasm of vitality. She writhed in a torture of reviving  strength, and in her convulsions she almost tore from Ventner's grasp.  Slowly she relaxed and sank partly back. The ungloved hand sought the  wound, and pressed so hard that her wrist half buried itself in her  bosom. Blood trickled between her spread fingers. And she looked at  Venters with eyes that saw him.    He cursed himself and the unerring aim of which he had been so proud. He  had seen that look in the eyes of a crippled antelope which he was  about to finish with his knife. But in her it had infinitely more--a  revelation of mortal spirit. The instinctive bringing to life was  there, and the divining helplessness and the terrible accusation of the  stricken.    \"Forgive me! I didn't know!\" burst out Venters.    \"You shot me--you've killed me!\" she whispered, in panting gasps. Upon  her lips appeared a fluttering, bloody froth. By that Venters knew  the air in her lungs was mixing with blood. \"Oh, I knew--it  would--come--some day!... Oh, the burn!... Hold me--I'm sinking--it's all  dark.... Ah, God!... Mercy--\"    Her rigidity loosened in one long quiver and she lay back limp, still,  white as snow, with closed eyes.    Venters thought then that she died. But the faint pulsation of her  breast assured him that life yet lingered. Death seemed only a matter  of moments, for the bullet had gone clear through her. Nevertheless, he  tore sageleaves from a bush, and, pressing them tightly over her wounds,  he bound the black scarf round her shoulder, tying it securely under  her arm. Then he closed the blouse, hiding from his sight that  blood-stained, accusing breast.    \"What--now?\" he questioned, with flying mind. \"I must get out of here.  She's dying--but I can't leave her.\"    He rapidly surveyed the sage to the north and made out no animate  object. Then he picked up the girl's sombrero and the mask. This time  the mask gave him as great a shock as when he first removed it from  her face. For in the woman he had forgotten the rustler, and this black  strip of felt-cloth established the identity of Oldring's Masked Rider.  Venters had solved the mystery. He slipped his rifle under her, and,  lifting her carefully upon it, he began to retrace his steps. The  dog trailed in his shadow. And the horse, that had stood drooping by,  followed without a call. Venters chose the deepest tufts of grass and  clumps of sage on his return. From time to time he glanced over his  shoulder. He did not rest. His concern was to avoid jarring the girl and  to hide his trail. Gaining the narrow canyon, he turned and held close  to the wall till he reached his hiding-place. When he entered the dense  thicket of oaks he was hard put to it to force a way through. But he  held his burden almost upright, and by slipping side wise and bending  the saplings he got in. Through sage and grass he hurried to the grove  of silver spruces.    He laid the girl down, almost fearing to look at her. Though marble pale  and cold, she was living. Venters then appreciated the tax that long  carry had been to his strength. He sat down to rest. Whitie sniffed at  the pale girl and whined and crept to Venters's feet. Ring lapped the  water in the runway of the spring.    Presently Venters went out to the opening, caught the horse and, leading  him through the thicket, unsaddled him and tied him with a long halter.  Wrangle left his browsing long enough to whinny and toss his head.  Venters felt that he could not rest easily till he had secured the other  rustler's horse; so, taking his rifle and calling for Ring, he set out.  Swiftly yet watchfully he made his way through the canyon to the oval  and out to the cattle trail. What few tracks might have betrayed him  he obliterated, so only an expert tracker could have trailed him. Then,  with many a wary backward glance across the sage, he started to round  up the rustler's horse. This was unexpectedly easy. He led the horse to  lower ground, out of sight from the opposite side of the oval along the  shadowy western wall, and so on into his canyon and secluded camp.    The girl's eyes were open; a feverish spot burned in her cheeks she  moaned something unintelligible to Venters, but he took the movement of  her lips to mean that she wanted water. Lifting her head, he tipped the  canteen to her lips. After that she again lapsed into unconsciousness or  a weakness which was its counterpart. Venters noted, however, that the  burning flush had faded into the former pallor.    The sun set behind the high canyon rim, and a cool shade darkened the  walls. Venters fed the dogs and put a halter on the dead rustlers horse.  He allowed Wrangle to browse free. This done, he cut spruce boughs and  made a lean-to for the girl. Then, gently lifting her upon a blanket,  he folded the sides over her. The other blanket he wrapped about his  shoulders and found a comfortable seat against a spruce-tree that upheld  the little shack. Ring and Whitie lay near at hand, one asleep, the  other watchful.    Venters dreaded the night's vigil. At night his mind was active, and  this time he had to watch and think and feel beside a dying girl whom  he had all but murdered. A thousand excuses he invented for himself, yet  not one made any difference in his act or his self-reproach.    It seemed to him that when night fell black he could see her white face  so much more plainly.    \"She'll go, presently,\" he said, \"and be out of agony--thank God!\"    Every little while certainty of her death came to him with a shock; and  then he would bend over and lay his ear on her breast. Her heart still  beat.    The early night blackness cleared to the cold starlight. The horses were  not moving, and no sound disturbed the deathly silence of the canyon.    \"I'll bury her here,\" thought Venters, \"and let her grave be as much a  mystery as her life was.\"    For the girl's few words, the look of her eyes, the prayer, had  strangely touched Venters.    \"She was only a girl,\" he soliloquized. \"What was she to Oldring?  Rustlers don't have wives nor sisters nor daughters. She was bad--that's  all. But somehow... well, she may not have willingly become the companion  of rustlers. That prayer of hers to God for mercy!... Life is strange  and cruel. I wonder if other members of Oldring's gang are women? Likely  enough. But what was his game? Oldring's Mask Rider! A name to make  villagers hide and lock their doors. A name credited with a dozen  murders, a hundred forays, and a thousand stealings of cattle. What  part did the girl have in this? It may have served Oldring to create  mystery.\"    Hours passed. The white stars moved across the narrow strip of dark-blue  sky above. The silence awoke to the low hum of insects. Venters watched  the immovable white face, and as he watched, hour by hour waiting for  death, the infamy of her passed from his mind. He thought only of the  sadness, the truth of the moment. Whoever she was--whatever she had  done--she was young and she was dying.    The after-part of the night wore on interminably. The starlight failed  and the gloom blackened to the darkest hour. \"She'll die at the gray  of dawn,\" muttered Venters, remembering some old woman's fancy. The  blackness paled to gray, and the gray lightened and day peeped over  the eastern rim. Venters listened at the breast of the girl. She  still lived. Did he only imagine that her heart beat stronger, ever so  slightly, but stronger? He pressed his ear closer to her breast. And he  rose with his own pulse quickening.    \"If she doesn't die soon--she's got a chance--the barest chance to  live,\" he said.    He wondered if the internal bleeding had ceased. There was no more film  of blood upon her lips. But no corpse could have been whiter. Opening  her blouse, he untied the scarf, and carefully picked away the sage  leaves from the wound in her shoulder. It had closed. Lifting her  lightly, he ascertained that the same was true of the hole where the  bullet had come out. He reflected on the fact that clean wounds closed  quickly in the healing upland air. He recalled instances of riders who  had been cut and shot apparently to fatal issues; yet the blood had  clotted, the wounds closed, and they had recovered.

Tadoussac was  at the mouth of an important river, called by the French the Saguenay,  a name which they also applied to the mysterious and wonderful country  through which it flowed in the far north; a country rich in copper and  possibly other precious metals. Champlain ascended the Saguenay River  for sixty miles as far as the rapids of Chicoutima. The Amerindians  whom he met here told him of Lake St. John, lying at a short distance  to the west, and that beyond this lake and the many streams which  entered it there lay a region of uplands strewn with other lakes and  pools; and farther away still began the sloping of the land to the  north till the traveller sighted a great arm of the salt sea, and  found himself amongst tribes (probably the Eskimo) who ate raw flesh,  and to the Indians appeared absolute savages.[4] This was probably  the first allusion, recorded by a European, to the existence of  Hudson's Bay, that huge inlet of the sea, which is one of the leading  features in the geography of British North America.    [Footnote 4: The real name for this remarkable people, the Eskimo, is,  in Alaska and Arctic North America, _Innuit_, and in Labrador and  Greenland, _Karalit_. Eskimo (in French, _Esquimaux_) is said to be a  corruption of the Montagnais-Indian word, Eskimantsik, meaning \"eaters  of raw flesh\".]    The Montagnais Indians round about Tadoussac received Champlain with  great protestations of friendship, and at the headquarters of their  principal chief or \"Sagamore\" celebrated this new friendship and  alliance with a feast in a very large hut. The banquet, as usual, was  preceded by a long address from the Sagamore in answer to the  description of France, given by one of the Indian interpreters. The  address was accompanied by the solemn smoking of tobacco, and at every  pause in this grave oration the natives present shouted with one  voice: \"Ho! ho! ho!\" The repast consisted of elk's meat (which struck  the Frenchmen as being like beef), also the flesh of bear, seal,  beaver, and wild fowl. There were eight or ten stone boilers or  cauldrons full of meats in the middle of the great hut, separated each  six feet from each other, and each one having its own fire. Every  native used a porringer or vessel made of birch bark. When the meat  was cooked a man in authority distributed it to each person. But  Champlain thought the Indians ate in a very filthy manner. When their  hands were covered with fat or grease they would rub them on their own  heads or on the hair of their dogs. Before the meat was cooked each  guest arose, took a dog, and hopped round the boilers from one end of  the great hut to the other. Arriving in front of the chief, the  Montagnais Indian feaster would throw his dog violently to the ground,  exclaiming: \"Ho! ho! ho!\" after which he returned to his place.    At the close of the banquet every one danced, with the skulls of  their Iroquois enemies slung over their backs. As they danced they  slapped their knees with their hands, and shouted: \"Ho! ho! ho!\" till  they were out of breath.    The huts of these Indians were low and made like tents, being covered  with the bark of the birch tree. An opening about a foot of the top  was left uncovered to admit light and to allow the smoke to escape.  Though low, the huts were sometimes quite large, and would accommodate  ten families. These slept higgledy-piggledy on skins, with their dogs  amongst them. The dogs in appearance were something like what we know  as Eskimo dogs, and also rather resembled the Chinese chow, with broad  heads and rather short muzzles, prick ears, and a tail inclined to  curl over the back. \"All these people have a very cheerful  disposition, laughing often, yet at the same time they are somewhat  phlegmatic. They talk very deliberately, as if desiring to make  themselves well understood, and, stopping suddenly, they reflect for a  long time, when they resume their discourse.\"    They were agile, well-proportioned people, who in the summertime went  about nearly naked, but in the winter were covered with good furs of  elk, otter, beaver, bear, seal, and deer. The colour of their skin was  usually a pale olive, but the women for some reason made themselves  much darker-skinned than the men by rubbing their bodies with pigments  which turned them to a dark brown. At times they suffered very much  from lack of food, being obliged then to frequent the shore of the  river or gulf to obtain shellfish. When pressed very hard by famine  they would eat their dogs (their only domestic animal) and even the  leather of the skins with which they clothed themselves. In the autumn  they were much given to fishing for eels, and they dried a good deal  of eel flesh, to last them through the winter. During the height of  the winter they hunted the beaver, and later on the elk. Though they  ate wild roots and fruits whenever they could obtain them, they do  not seem to have cultivated any grain or vegetables. In the early  spring they were sometimes dying of hunger, and looked so thin and  haggard that they were mere walking skeletons. They were then ready to  eat carrion that was putrid, so that it is little wonder that they  suffered much from scurvy.    Yet the rivers and the gulf abounded in fish, and as soon as the  waters were unlocked by the melting of the ice in April, the surviving  Indians rapidly grew fat and well, and of course the late summer and  the autumn brought them nuts (hickory and other kinds of walnut, and  hazel nuts), wild cherries, wild plums, raspberries, strawberries,  gooseberries, blackberries, currants,[5] cranberries, and grapes.    [Footnote 5: The wild currants so often mentioned by the early  explorers of Canada are often referred to as red, green, and blue. The  blue currants are really the black currant, now so familiar to our  kitchen gardens (_Ribes nigrum_). This, together with the red currant  (_Ribes rubrum_), grows throughout North America, Siberia, and eastern  Europe. The unripe fruit may have been the green currants alluded to  by Champlain, or these may have been the white variety of our gardens.  The two species of wild strawberry which figure so frequently in the  stories of these early explorers are _Fragaria vesca_ and _F.  virginiana_. From the last-named is derived the cultivated strawberry  of Europe. The wild strawberries of North America were larger than  those of Europe. Champlain does not himself allude to gooseberries  (unless they are his _groseilles vertes_), but later travellers do.  Three or more kinds of gooseberry grow wild in Canada, but they are  different from the European species. The blueberry so often Mentioned  by Champlain (bluets or blues) was _Vaccinium canadense_.]    Champlain observed amongst them for the first time the far-famed  Amerindian snowshoes, which he compares very aptly for shape to a  racquet used in tennis.    Champlain next visited the site of Stadacona, but there was no longer  any settlement of Europeans at that place, nor were the native  Amerindians the descendants of the Hurons that had received Jacques  Cartier. For the first time the name Quebec (pronounced Kebek) is  applied to this point where the great River St. Lawrence narrows  before dividing to encircle the Isle of Orleans. In fact, Quebec meant  in the Algonkin speech a place where a river narrows; for a tribe of  the great Algonkin family, _the_ Algonkins, allied to the tribes of  Maine and New Brunswick, had replaced the Hurons as the native  inhabitants of this region.    On the shore of Quebec he noticed \"diamonds\" in some slate rocks--no  doubt quartz crystals. Proceeding on up the River St. Lawrence he  observed the extensive woods of fir and cypress (some kind of _Thuja_  or _Juniper_), the undergrowth of vines, \"wild pears\", hazel nuts,  cherries, red currants and green currants, and \"certain little  radishes of the size of a small nut, resembling truffles in taste,  which are very good when roasted or boiled\". As they advanced towards  the interior the country became increasingly mountainous on the south  (the green mountains of New Hampshire), and was more and more  beautiful--\"the pleasantest land yet seen\". Landing on the south bank  of the St. Lawrence, west of the entrance of the river of the Iroquois  (the Richelieu), he found magnificent forests, which, besides the  trees already mentioned, included oaks, chestnuts, maples, pines,  walnut-like nut trees,[6] aspens, poplars, and beeches; with climbing  hops and vines, strawberries trailing over the ground, and raspberry  canes and currant bushes \"growing in the thick grass\". These splendid  woods on the islands and banks of the broad river were full of game:  elks,[7] wapiti deer, Virginian deer, bears, porcupines, hares, foxes,  beavers, otters, and musk rats, besides many animals he could not  recognize.    [Footnote 6: Of the genera _Juglans_ and _Carya_.]    [Footnote 7: The huge deer of the genus _Alces_. Elk is the old  Scandinavian name. _Moose_, derived from the Kri language, is the  Canadian term, \"Elk\" being misapplied to the wapiti (red) deer.  Champlain calls the elk _orignac_, its name in Algonkin.]    At last his little expedition in \"a skiff and canoe\" had to draw into  the bank, warned by the noise that they were approaching a great fall  of water--the La Chine or St. Louis Rapids. Champlain wrote: \"I saw,  to my astonishment, a torrent of water descending with an impetuosity  such as I have never before witnessed.... It descends as if in steps,  and at each descent there is a remarkable boiling, owing to the force  and swiftness with which the water traverses the fall, which is about  a league in length.... The territory on the side of the fall where we  went overland consists, so far as we saw it, of very open wood,"]]]
