Meeting Krishna  outside Brindaban, he falls at his feet, Krishna lifts him up, embraces  him and brings him into Nanda's house. Akrura tells Nanda and Krishna  how Kansa has oppressed the people of Mathura, imprisoned Vasudeva and  Devaki and has now sent him to invite them to attend the festival of  arms. Krishna listens and at once agrees to go, while Nanda sends out a  town-crier to announce by beat of drum that all the cowherds should get  ready to leave the next day. When morning comes, Krishna leaves in a  chariot, accompanied by the cowherds and their children.    The news of his sudden departure devastates the cowgirls. Since the  circular dance in which their love was consummated, they have been meeting  Krishna every evening and delighting in his company. And during the  daytime their passionate longings have centred solely on him. That he  should leave them so abruptly causes them complete dismay and they are  only comforted when Krishna assures them that he will return after a few  days.    On the way to Mathura Akrura bathes in the Jumna and is granted a vision  of Krishna as Vishnu himself.    Reaching Mathura, Nanda and the cowherds pitch their tents outside the  city walls[32] while Krishna with Balarama and the cowherd children go  inside the city for a walk. As they wander through the streets, the news  of their arrival precedes them and women, excited by Krishna's name,  throng the rooftops, balconies and windows. 'Some ran off in the middle of  their dinner: others while bathing and others while engaged in plaiting  their hair. They forgot all dalliance with their husbands and went to look  at Krishna.' As Krishna proceeds, he meets some of Kansa's washermen  carrying with them bundles of clothes. He asks them to give him some and  when they refuse, he attacks one of them and strikes off his head. The  others drop their bundles and run for their lives. The cowherd children  try to dress themselves up but not knowing how to wear the clothes, some  of them put their arms into trousers and their legs into coats. Krishna  laughs at their mistakes until a tailor, a servant of Kansa, repudiates  his master, glorifies Krishna and sets the clothes right. A little later,  a gardener takes them to his house and places garlands round their necks.  As they are leaving, they meet a young woman, a hunchback, carrying a pot  of scented ointment. Krishna cannot resist flirting with her and asks her  for whom she is carrying the ointment. The girl, Kubja, sees the amorous  look in his eyes and being greatly taken by his beauty answers 'Dear one,  do you not know that I am a servant of Raja Kansa and though a hunchback  am entrusted with making his perfumes?' 'Lovely one,' Krishna answers,  'Give us a little of this ointment, just enough to rub on our bodies.'  'Take some,' says Kubja, and giving it to Krishna and Balarama, she allows  them to rub it on their bodies. When they have finished, Krishna takes her  under the chin, lifts her head and at the same time, presses her feet down  with his toes. In this way he straightens her back, thereby changing her  into the loveliest of girls. Filled with love and gratitude, Kubja catches  Krishna by the dress and begs him to come and visit her. Krishna promises  to go later and smilingly dismisses her.    Krishna now reaches the gate where the bow of Siva 'as long as three palm  trees' and very heavy, is being guarded by soldiers. He picks it up, bends  it to the full and breaks it in pieces. When the guards attack him, he  kills them and presently slaughters all the reinforcements which Kansa  sends. When the battle is over, he strolls calmly back to the cowherds'  tents.[33]    Next day, Krishna and the cowherds enter Mathura to attend the sports.  Krishna is obstructed by a giant elephant, attacks it and after a great  fight kills it. He and Balarama then extract the tusks and parade with  them in the arena. It is now the turn of Kansa's wrestlers. Their leader,  Chanura, dares Krishna to give Kansa a little amusement by wrestling with  him. Krishna takes him at his word and again after a fierce combat leaves  the wrestler dead on the ground.[34] At the same time, Balarama attacks and  kills a second wrestler, Mustaka. When other wrestlers strive to kill  Krishna and Balarama, they also are dispatched. Seeing first one and then  another plan go astray, Kansa orders his remaining demons to fetch  Vasudeva, Devaki and Ugrasena, declaring that after he has killed them he  will put the two young men to death. This declaration seals his fate. In a  flash Krishna slays Kansa's demons and then, leaping on the dais where  Kansa is sitting, he seizes him by the hair and hurls him to the ground.  Kansa is killed and all Mathura rejoices. Kansa's eight demon brothers are  then slain and only when Krishna has dragged Kansa's body to the river  Jumna and is sure that not a single demon is left do he and Balarama  desist from fighting.    [Footnote 31: Note 7.]    [Footnote 32: Plate 16.]    [Footnote 33: Plate 16.]    [Footnote 34: Plate 17.]          IV    THE _BHAGAVATA PURANA_: THE PRINCE        (i) The Return to Court      The death of Kansa brings to a close the first phase of Krishna's career.  His primary aim has now been accomplished. The tyrant whose excesses have  for so long vexed the righteous is dead. Earth's prayer has been granted.  Krishna has reached, in fact, a turning-point in his life and on what he  now decides the rest of his career depends. If he holds that his earthly  mission is ended, he must quit his mortal body, resume his sublime  celestial state and once again become the Vishnu whose attributes have  been praised by Akrura when journeying to Brindaban. If, on the other  hand, he regards his mission as still unfulfilled, is he to return to  Brindaban or should he remain instead at Mathura? At Brindaban, his foster  parents, Nanda and Yasoda, his friends the cowherds and his loves the  cowgirls long for his return. He has spent idyllic days in their company.  He has saved them from the dangers inherent in forest life. He has kept a  host of demon marauders at bay. At the same time, his magnetic charms have  aroused the most intense devotion. If he returns, it will be to dwell with  people who have doted on him as a child, adored him as a youth and who  love him as a man. On the other hand, Mathura, it is clear, has also  strong claims. Although reared and bred among the cowherds, Krishna is, in  fact, a child of Mathura. Although smuggled from the prison immediately  afterwards, it was in Mathura that he left his mother's womb. His true  father is Vasudeva, a leader of the Yadava nobility and member of the  Mathura ruling caste. His true mother, Devaki, is related to the Mathura  royal family. If his youth and infancy have been passed among the  cowherds, this was due to special reasons. His father's substitution of  him at birth for Yasoda's baby daughter was dictated by the dire perils  which would have confronted him had he remained with his mother. It was,  at most, a desperate expedient for saving his life and although the  tyrant's unremitting search for the child who was to kill him prolonged  his stay in Brindaban, his transportation there was never intended as a  permanent arrangement. A deception has been practised. Nanda and Yasoda  regard and believe Krishna to be their son. None the less there has been  no formal adoption and it is Vasudeva and Devaki who are his parents.    It is this which decides the issue. As one who by birth and blood belongs  to Mathura, Krishna can hardly desert it now that the main obstacle to his  return--the tyrant Kansa--has been removed. His plain duty is to his  parents and his castemen. Painful therefore as the severance must be, he  decides to abandon the cowherds and see them no more. He is perhaps  fortified in his decision by the knowledge that even in his relations with  the cowgirls a climax has been reached. A return would merely repeat their  nightly ecstasies, not achieve a fresh experience. Finally although Kansa  himself has been killed, his demon allies are still at large. Mathura and  Krishna's kinsmen, the Yadavas, are far from safe. He can hardly desert  them until their interests have been permanently safeguarded and by then  he will have become a feudal princeling, the very reverse of the young  cowherd who night after night has thrilled the cowgirls with his flute.    Following the tyrant's death, then, a train of complicated adjustments are  set in motion. The first step is to re-establish Krishna with his true  parents who are still in jail where the tyrant has confined them. Krishna  accordingly goes to visit them, frees them from their shackles and stands  before them with folded hands. For an instant Vasudeva and Devaki know  that Krishna is God and that in order to destroy demons he has come on  earth. They are about to worship him when Krishna dispels this knowledge  and they look on him and Balarama as their sons. Then Krishna addresses  them. For all these long years Vasudeva and Devaki have known that Krishna  and Balarama were their children and have suffered accordingly. It was not  Krishna's fault that he and Balarama were placed in Nanda's charge. Yet  although parted from their mother, they have never forgotten her. It pains  them to think that they have done so little to make her happy, that they  have never had her society and have wasted their time with strangers. And  he reminds them that in the world only those who serve their fathers and  mothers obtain power. Vasudeva and Devaki are greatly touched by Krishna's  words. Their former woe vanishes and they embrace Krishna and Balarama  fondly.    Having acknowledged Vasudeva and Devaki as his true parents, Krishna has  now to adjust his social position. Since Nanda and the cowherds belong to  a lower caste than that of Vasudeva and the other Yadavas, Krishna and  Balarama, who have eaten and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11930"],[0,"More Fables (#10)"],[1,"awaiting her, and would  travel with an Elocutionist some day and have her Picture on the  Programme.    Lutie's Father did not warm up to the Suggestion. He was rather Near  when it came to frivoling away the National Bank Lithographs. But pshaw!  The Astute Reader knows what happens in a Family when Mother and the  Only Child put their Heads together to whipsaw the Producer. One Day  they shouldered him into a Corner and extorted a Promise. Next Day Lutie  started to Take.    She bought a red leather Cylinder marked \"Music,\" so that people would  not take it to be Lunch. Every Morning about 9 o'clock she would wave  the Housework to one side and tear for a Trolley.    Her Lessons cost the Family about twenty cents a Minute. She took them  in a large Building full of Vocal Studios. People who didn't know used  to stop in front of the Place and listen, and think it was a Surgical  Institute.    There were enough Soprani in this one Plant to keep Maurice Grau stocked  up for a Hundred Years. Every one thought she was the Particular One who  would sooner or later send Melba back to Australia and drive Sembrich  into the Continuous. Lutie was just about as Nifty as the Next One.    When she was at Home she would suck Lemons and complain about Draughts  and tell why she didn't like the Other Girls' Voices. She began to act  like a Prima Donna, and her Mother was encouraged a Lot. Lutie certainly  had the Artistic Temperament bigger than a Church Debt.    Now before Lutie started in to do Things to her Voice she occasionally  Held Hands with a Young Man in the Insurance Business, named Oliver.  This Young Man thought that Lutie was all the Merchandise, and she  regarded him as Permanent Car-Fare.    But when Lutie began to hang out at the Studios she took up with the  Musical Set that couldn't talk about anything but Technique and Shading  and the Motif and the Vibrato. She began to fill up the Parlor with her  new Friends, and the first thing Oliver knew he was in the Side Pocket  and out of the Game.    In his own Line this Oliver was as neat and easy-running as a Red Buggy,  but when you started him on the topic of Music he was about as light and  speedy as a Steam Roller. Ordinarily he knew how to behave himself in a  Flat, and with a good Feeder to work back at him he could talk about  Shows and Foot-Ball Games and Things to Eat, but when any one tried to  draw him out on the Classics, he was unable to Qualify.    [Illustration: LUTIE]    When Lutie and her Musical acquaintances told about Shopan and Batoven  he would sit back so quiet that often he got numb below the Hips. He was  afraid to move his Feet for fear some one would notice that he was still  in the Parlor and ask him how he liked Fugue No. II, by Bock. He had  never heard of any of these People, because they did not carry Tontine  Policies with his Company.    Oliver saw that he would have to Scratch the Musical Set or else begin  to Read Up, so he changed his Route. He canceled all Time with Lutie,  and made other Bookings.    Lutie then selected for her Steady a Young Man with Hair who played the  'Cello. He was so wrapped up in his Art that he acted Dopey most of the  time, and often forgot to send out the Laundry so as to get it back the  same Week. Furthermore, he didn't get to the Suds any too often. He  never Saw more than $3 at one time; but when he snuggled up alongside of  a 'Cello and began to tease the long, sad Notes out of it, you could  tell that he had a Soul for Music. Lutie thought he was Great, but what  Lutie's Father thought of him could never get past the Censor. Lutie's  Father regarded the whole Musical Set as a Fuzzy Bunch. He began to  think that in making any Outlay for Lutie's Vocal Training he had bought  a Gold Brick. When he first consented to her taking Lessons his Belief  was that after she had practiced for about one Term she would be able to  sit up to the Instrument along in the Dusk before the Lamps were lit,  and sing \"When the Corn is Waving, Annie Dear,\" \"One Sweetly Solemn  Thought,\" or else \"Juanita.\" These were the Songs linked in his Memory  with some Purple Evenings of the Happy Long Ago. He knew they were  Chestnuts, and had been called in, but they suited him, and he thought  that inasmuch as he had put up the Wherewith for Lutie's Lessons he  ought to have some kind of a Small Run for his Money.    Would Lutie sing such Trash? Not she. She was looking for Difficult  Arias from the Italian, and she found many a one that was Difficult to  sing, and probably a little more Difficult to Listen To.    The Voice began to be erratic, also. When father wanted to sit by the  Student's Lamp and read his Scribner's, she would decide to hammer the  Piano and do the whole Repertoire.    But when Mother had Callers and wanted Lutie to Show Off, then she would  hang back and have to be Coaxed. If she didn't have a Sore Throat, then  the Piano was out of Tune, or else she had left all of her Good Music at  the Studio, or maybe she just couldn't Sing without some one to  Accompany her. But after they had Pleaded hard enough, and everybody was  Embarrassed and sorry they had come, she would approach the Piano  timidly and sort of Trifle with it for a while, and say they would have  to make Allowances, and then she would Cut Loose and worry the whole  Block. The Company would sit there, every one showing the Parlor Face  and pretending to be entranced, and after she got through they would  Come To and tell her how Good she was.    She made so many of these Parlor Triumphs that there was no Holding her.  She had herself Billed as a Nightingale. Often she went to Soirees and  Club Entertainments, volunteering her Services, and nowhere did she meet  a Well-Wisher who took her aside and told her she was a Shine--in fact,  the Champion Pest.    [Illustration: CRITIC]    No, Lutie never got out of her Dream until she made a bold Sashay with a  Concert Company. It was her Professional Debut.    Father fixed it. The Idea of any one paying Real Money to hear Lutie  sing struck him as being almost Good enough to Print. But she wouldn't  be Happy until she got it, and so she Got It right where the Newport  Lady wears the Rope of Pearls.    On the First Night the mean old Critics, who didn't know her Father or  Mother, and had never been entertained at the House, came and got in the  Front Row, and defied Lutie to come on and Make Good. Next Morning they  said that Lutie had Blow-Holes in her Voice; that she hit the Key only  once during the Evening, and then fell off backward; that she was a Ham,  and her Dress didn't fit her, and she lacked Stage Presence. They  expressed Surprise that she should be attempting to Sing when any bright  Girl could learn to pound a Type-Writer in Four Weeks. They wanted to  know who was responsible for her Appearance, and said it was a Shame to  String these Jay Amateurs. Lutie read the Criticisms, and went into  Nervous Collapse. Her Mother was all Wrought Up, and said somebody ought  to go and kill the Editors. Father bore up grimly.    Before Lutie was Convalescent he had the Difficult Italian Arias carted  out of the house. The 'Cello Player came to call one Day, and he was  given Minutes to get out of the Ward.    By the time Oliver looked in again Lutie was more than ready to pay some  Attention to him. She is now doing a few quiet Vocalizations for her  Friends. When some one who hasn't Heard tells her that she is good  enough for Opera, they have to open the Windows and give her more Air.    MORAL: _When in Doubt, try it on the Box-office_.          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ COTILLON LEADER _FROM THE_ HUCKLEBERRY DISTRICT  _WITH THE_ INTERMITTENT MEMORY      A Young Man who had made a Sudden Winning, and was beginning to act as  Shawl-Holder and Emergency Errand-Boy for the Society Queens, seemed to  have a great deal of Trouble with his Memory. If he met Any One who had  started with him a few Years before, and who used to Stake him to a  Meal-Ticket now and then, or let him have a Scarf-Pin when he had to go  out and make a Front, he could not appear to remember the Man's Name or  tell where he had seen him before. When he was in a Loge at the  Play-House with Exclusive Ethel and her Friends, he might look down in  the Parquette and see the Landlady who had carried him through a Hard  Winter and accepted a Graceful Wave of the Hand when she really needed  the Board Money, but he found it impossible to Place her. Even the  People who came from his own Town, and who knew him when he was getting  Five a Week and wearing Celluloid Cuffs, and who could relate the Family  History if they wanted to Knock, they couldn't make him Remember, even  when they stopped him on the Street and recalled such Humiliations as  the Time he used to pick Cherries on the Shares, and how Odd he looked  in his Brother's Made-Over Clothes.
