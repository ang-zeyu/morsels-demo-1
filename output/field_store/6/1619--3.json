I parted from Vienna the middle of May, and took post for Great Glogau  in Silesia, as if I had purposed to pass into Poland, but designing  indeed to go down the Oder to Custrim in the marquisate of  Brandenburg, and so to Berlin. But when I came to the frontiers of  Silesia, though I had passes, I could go no farther, the guards on  all the frontiers were so strict, so I was obliged to come back into  Bohemia, and went to Prague. From hence I found I could easily pass  through the Imperial provinces to the lower Saxony, and accordingly  took passes for Hamburg, designing, however, to use them no farther  than I found occasion.    By virtue of these passes I got into the Imperial army, under Count  Tilly, then at the siege of Magdeburg, May the 2nd.    I confess I did not foresee the fate of this city, neither, I believe,  did Count Tilly himself expect to glut his fury with so entire a  desolation, much less did the people expect it. I did believe they  must capitulate, and I perceived by discourse in the army that Tilly  would give them but very indifferent conditions; but it fell out  otherwise. The treaty of surrender was, as it were, begun, nay, some  say concluded, when some of the out-guards of the Imperialists finding  the citizens had abandoned the guards of the works, and looked to  themselves with less diligence than usual, they broke in, carried an  half-moon, sword in hand, with little resistance; and though it was  a surprise on both sides, the citizens neither fearing, nor the army  expecting the occasion, the garrison, with as much resolution as could  be expected under such a fright, flew to the walls, twice beat the  Imperialists off, but fresh men coming up, and the administrator of  Magdeburg himself being wounded and taken, the enemy broke in, took  the city by storm, and entered with such terrible fury, that,  without respect to age or condition, they put all the garrison and  inhabitants, man, woman, and child, to the sword, plundered the city,  and when they had done this set it on fire.    This calamity sure was the dreadfulest sight that ever I saw; the  rage of the Imperial soldiers was most intolerable, and not to be  expressed. Of 25,000, some said 30,000 people, there was not a soul to  be seen alive, till the flames drove those that were hid in vaults and  secret places to seek death in the streets rather than perish in the  fire. Of these miserable creatures some were killed too by the furious  soldiers, but at last they saved the lives of such as came out of  their cellars and holes, and so about two thousand poor desperate  creatures were left. The exact number of those that perished in  this city could never be known, because those the soldiers had first  butchered the flames afterwards devoured.    I was on the outer side of the Elbe when this dreadful piece of  butchery was done. The city of Magdeburg had a sconce or fort over  against it called the toll-house, which joined to the city by a very  fine bridge of boats. This fort was taken by the Imperialists a few  days before, and having a mind to see it, and the rather because from  thence I could have a very good view of the city, I was going over  Tilley's bridge of boats to view this fort. About ten o'clock in the  morning I perceived they were storming by the firing, and immediately  all ran to the works; I little thought of the taking the city, but  imagined it might be some outwork attacked, for we all expected  the city would surrender that day, or next, and they might have  capitulated upon very good terms.    Being upon the works of the fort, on a sudden I heard the dreadfulest  cry raised in the city that can be imagined; 'tis not possible to  express the manner of it, and I could see the women and children  running about the streets in a most lamentable condition.    The city wall did not run along the side where the river was with  so great a height, but we could plainly see the market-place and the  several streets which run down to the river. In about an hour's time  after this first cry all was in confusion; there was little shooting,  the execution was all cutting of throats and mere house murders. The  resolute garrison, with the brave Baron Falkenberg, fought it out  to the last, and were cut in pieces, and by this time the Imperial  soldiers having broke open the gates and entered on all sides, the  slaughter was very dreadful. We could see the poor people in crowds  driven down the streets, flying from the fury of the soldiers, who  followed butchering them as fast as they could, and refused mercy to  anybody, till driving them to the river's edge, the desperate wretches  would throw themselves into the river, where thousands of them  perished, especially women and children. Several men that could swim  got over to our side, where the soldiers not heated with fight gave  them quarter, and took them up, and I cannot but do this justice to  the German officers in the fort: they had five small flat boats, and  they gave leave to the soldiers to go off in them, and get what booty  they could, but charged them not to kill anybody, but take them all  prisoners.    Nor was their humanity ill rewarded, for the soldiers, wisely avoiding  those places where their fellows were employed in butchering the  miserable people, rowed to other places, where crowds of people stood  crying out for help, and expecting to be every minute either drowned  or murdered; of these at sundry times they fetched over near six  hundred, but took care to take in none but such as offered them good  pay.    Never was money or jewels of greater service than now, for those that  had anything of that sort to offer were soonest helped.    There was a burgher of the town who, seeing a boat coming near him,  but out of his call, by the help of a speaking trumpet, told the  soldiers in it he would give them 20,000 dollars to fetch him off.  They rowed close to the shore, and got him with his wife and six  children into the boat, but such throngs of people got about the boat  that had like to have sunk her, so that the soldiers were fain to  drive a great many out again by main force, and while they were doing  this some of the enemies coming down the street desperately drove them  all into the water.    The boat, however, brought the burgher and his wife and children safe,  and though they had not all that wealth about them, yet in jewels and  money he gave them so much as made all the fellows very rich.    I cannot pretend to describe the cruelty of this day: the town by  five in the afternoon was all in a flame; the wealth consumed was  inestimable, and a loss to the very conqueror. I think there was  little or nothing left but the great church and about a hundred  houses.    This was a sad welcome into the army for me, and gave me a horror and  aversion to the emperor's people, as well as to his cause. I quitted  the camp the third day after this execution, while the fire was hardly  out in the city; and from thence getting safe-conduct to pass into the  Palatinate, I turned out of the road at a small village on the Elbe,  called Emerfield, and by ways and towns I can give but small account  of, having a boor for our guide, whom we could hardly understand, I  arrived at Leipsic on the 17th of May.    We found the elector intense upon the strengthening of his army, but  the people in the greatest terror imaginable, every day expecting  Tilly with the German army, who by his cruelty at Magdeburg was become  so dreadful to the Protestants that they expected no mercy wherever he  came.    The emperor's power was made so formidable to all the Protestants,  particularly since the Diet at Ratisbon left them in a worse case  than it found them, that they had not only formed the Conclusions of  Leipsic, which all men looked on as the effect of desperation rather  than any probable means of their deliverance, but had privately  implored the protection and assistance of foreign powers, and  particularly the King of Sweden, from whom they had promises of a  speedy and powerful assistance. And truly if the Swede had not with  a very strong hand rescued them, all their Conclusions at Leipsic had  served but to hasten their ruin. I remember very well when I was in  the Imperial army they discoursed with such contempt of the forces  of the Protestant, that not only the Imperialists but the Protestants  themselves gave them up as lost. The emperor had not less than 200,000  men in several armies on foot, who most of them were on the back of  the Protestants in every corner. If Tilly did but write a threatening  letter to any city or prince of the union, they presently submitted,  renounced the Conclusions of Leipsic, and received Imperial garrisons,  as the cities of Ulm and Memmingen, the duchy of Wirtemberg, and  several others, and almost all Suaben.    Only the Duke of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse upheld the drooping  courage of the Protestants, and refused all terms of peace, slighted  all the threatenings of the Imperial generals, and the Duke of  Brandenburg was brought in afterward almost by force.    The Duke of Saxony mustered his forces under the walls of Leipsic,  and I having returned to Leipsic, two days before, saw them pass the  review. The duke, gallantly mounted, rode through the ranks, attended  by his field-marshal Arnheim, and seemed mighty well pleased with  them, and indeed the troops made a very fine appearance; but I that  had seen Tilly's army and his old weather-beaten soldiers, whose  discipline and exercises were so exact, and their courage so often  tried, could not look on the Saxon army without some concern for them  when I considered who they had to deal with. Tilly's men were rugged  surly fellows, their faces had an air of hardy courage, mangled with  wounds and scars, their armour showed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1226"],[0,"The Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Volume 10 (#10)"],[1,"most boys, had a desire to become a fisherman or hunter, and my  brother had suspected that a little close acquaintance with the way a  fisherman lived would cure him of this desire; in this he was entirely  right, and after a few trips to visit the old fellow, he had expressed  himself as cured of any desire to live the beautiful, pleasant life of a  river fisherman.    Without going any further, it can easily be seen that a fisherman symbolizes  for me everything that is synonymous with failure. Thus, when I stepped out  into the muddy water and began fishing I symbolically became a failure, a  no-account, a man who had failed in the struggle and had not achieved  success.  The very fact that we came DOWN HILL to the place of fishing  shows, on the face of it, that a downhill career is symbolized.  My brother  was with me, and that is easily explained as a dramatization of the fact  that I was accompanying him on that downhill road to the state of the man in  the rickety wagon which he had prophesied as his future. The water in the  shallow pools was muddy, and I stepped into it just after experiencing a  fear that I would get my shoes wet. Remembering the fisherman's bare brown  feet, this can be interpreted as nothing but a very strong symbolization of  a drop from a cultured and successful circle to a low and unsuccessful one.  I grasp a fish bigger than myself and struggle with it, but am compelled to  give it up.  Another symbol:  my work is plainly too big for me; this  question is too much for me to handle, and this thesis will ultimately have  to be given up as the big fish is. In fact, I cannot say that I succeeded in  getting ANY fish out of the water and, therefore, I shall never succeed at  anything I undertake, but will land figuratively, if not actually, in the  fisherman's hut.    The Mr. N. who was with us, was cross-eyed which, in itself, seemed to have  no special meaning; but it immediately called up an image of a cross-eyed  man standing at the river's edge at Vevay, Indiana.  This fellow was the  picture of ignorance and want. He was telling another man about catching a  big fish a few days before and how he liked that kind of fish boiled so  well, but he could not wait for it to boil, but had fried part of it and  eaten it that way.  As I heard him relate this and watched his face, the  whole event seemed to me to be most disgusting. As I was watching him, some  one at my side told me that, because of a drunken spree, he had been  disfranchised. He was also a fisherman and another typical specimen of the  class. Mr. N., having the same facial defect, though in a much less  noticeable way, became identified with him, and I am again found walking  down the hill to oblivion in company with this brother in distress. This is  bad for Mr. N., but it cannot be helped.    The rainbows seem bright enough, but they bring in another disquieting group  of associations.  The rainbow is almost, if not quite, a universal symbol of  failure.  We all know the old story of going to the end of the rainbow for a  pot of gold, and if we want to belittle any effort we say that the  individual is chasing the rainbow. So here I am again on the downhill road  between two failures, following the rainbow to a hopeless condition of muddy  uselessness. And if it were not bad enough to be following one rainbow, I am  following a great number which must mean that I shall always end in failure  whatever I undertake.    But, besides this, the rainbow has special associations for me. The first of  these associations which came into consciousness was a little booklet made  by a Latin student and handed her professor. I had several years of Greek  and Latin under this teacher and at a certain place in the course, he asked  each student to make a little booklet of some kind, using as much  originality as possible, copy some favorite quotations from De Senectute and  hand in the finished product. Every year he gets these out and exhibits them  as a kind of inspiration. One of them had a rainbow and a pot of gold on the  cover. I spent a great deal of time and work on mine and made a more  elaborate booklet than any other that had been made, but I purposely left it  unfinished and inscribed a statement that this was to typify the kind of  work I did in that department.  Of course it was a joke, but I have often  thought that there was method in this madness, and that it really  approximated the true state of affairs. This seeming chance association,  then, is closely connected with my fear of making a failure which is so  clearly dramatized in this dream.    The fact that the dream is placed in Colorado is also important. Two years  ago, I spent the summer in Colorado and had a very delightful time, as was  natural, being on a wedding trip. But during this stay, I did make a total  failure at fishing. I had been a fairly successful trout fisher a few years  before, but I had forgotten the art and did not do enough fishing to  relearn. In other words, my dream gives me to understand that I cannot be  successful even in fishing.  One evening my bride and I witnessed a most  beautiful sunset, a rainbow figuring largely in the scene. At this time we  were debating whether or not to go on farther West as I had originally  planned; but circumstances prevented this and instead of going on farther,  we came back East or toward the rainbow. This is just one more place where  the dream so clearly symbolizes a failure to do what I undertake.  I will  not carry the analysis any further, though I could find associations by the  hundred which would strengthen the meaning given.    Of course I am not at all conscious of having any such fear as this. In fact  I am rather inclined to be over-confident; but this is, of course, due to  the repressing influence of the censor and only strengthens the analysis.    Examples could be given until the last trump is sounded and the world rolled  up like a scroll, but I do not want to keep any one so long. Whatever we  wish to make out of a dream--the dramatization of a fear, a joy, a joke  (really this is what the Freudians often do), a tragedy, anything that can  be suggested, the result can easily be accomplished if only we be allowed  the use of Freud's mechanisms and a moderate amount of symbolism.    I have tried to show:  First, that any situation or experience can be  analyzed with as good success as a dream, and second, that a dream may be  made to mean anything.  In other words, with Freud's method, one can  demonstrate anything to suit his taste or belief.  Long ago, the saying was  formulated that all roads lead to Rome.  This being true, it must also be  true that all roads lead everywhere else.  Freud employs a wonderful figure  of a mystical sphere, with its layers and cross veins and other  mineralogical characteristics, to represent the part of consciousness with  the repressed factor at the center well guarded. It would be far more to the  point if he should represent the whole of past experience as the surface of  a country, with its various roads connecting the different centers.  The  stations would then represent the experiences, and the roads the association  tracks between them. If one should travel at random over these roads, he  would in time pass through all kinds of towns and cities, but if he started  in quest of a certain type, say mountain villages, he would arrive at his  goal much more quickly than he would otherwise.  The Freudians themselves  acknowledge that they have difficulty in knowing when to stop the analysis.  Their plan seems to be to travel until the landscape suits them and then get  off and camp.    Thus, while I have made no attempt to give positive proof or argument that  Freud's theory, in its extreme form is at fault, I have tried to  substantiate my argument that there has been no real argument on the other  side.  And when a theory so spectacular and altogether out of the ordinary  is presented, the burden of the proof should very decidedly be thrown on the  positive side. We have no obligation or even excuse for accepting such a  theory on the mere presumption of the originator.    And that Freud's theory is weird and fantastic is a self-evident fact.  Perhaps the Clark University student who very carefully worked it up a few  years ago went a little too far when he said it was a chaotic inferno, but  at any rate, it is far removed from celestial harmony. Sidis takes about the  sanest attitude possible when he refers to certain Freudian writings as  being full of unconscious sexual humor. He observes further as does Prince  and others that the Freudian school is in reality a religious or  philosophical sect. He says that Freud's writings constitute the  psychoanalytic Bible and are quoted with reverence and awe.  Kronfeld, in a  most valuable criticism, says that in comparison with Freud's conception of  the vorconscious and its work, Henroth's Demonomania appears a modest  scientific theory.    The attitude of the Freudians is, itself, worth noticing. They are very  prone to consider any criticism as very personal, and fly to the rescue with  all the fervor of a religious fanatic. A work on dreams, because it does not  bear out Freud in all details, calls forth thunderbolts from two continents.  This over-anxious attitude indicates that the belief in the theory is based  on an emotional condition rather than logical reasoning. Bernard Hart, who  is one of those happy individuals who get the best out of Freudianism, shows  the difference between the two kinds of belief by comparing our belief that  the earth goes around the sun and that the man who abuses a woman is a cad.  The cold, indifferent attitude toward the former is in marked contrast to  our warm lively interest in the latter, and the reason is that the belief in  the one is founded on scientific demonstration and in the other on our  feeling in the matter.
