It may      be added that, while suckling is essential to the complete      well-being of the child, it is highly desirable for the sake of      the mother's health also. (Some important statistics are      summarized in a paper on \"Infantile Mortality\" in _British      Medical Journal_, Nov. 2, 1907), while the various aspects of      suckling have been thoroughly discussed by Bollinger, \"Ueber      Saeuglings-Sterblichkeit und die Erbliche functionelle Atrophie      der menschlichen Milchdruese\" (_Correspondenzblatt Deutschen      Gesellschaft Anthropologie_, Oct., 1899).        It appears that in Sweden, in the middle of the eighteenth      century, it was a punishable offense for a woman to give her baby      the bottle when she was able to suckle it. In recent years Prof.      Anton von Menger, of Vienna, has argued (in his _Burgerliche      Recht und die Besitzlosen Klassen_) that the future generation      has the right to make this claim, and he proposes that every      mother shall be legally bound to suckle her child unless her      inability to do so has been certified by a physician. E.A.      Schroeder (_Das Recht in der Geschlechtlichen Ordnung_, 1893, p.      346) also argued that a mother should be legally bound to suckle      her infant for at least nine months, unless solid grounds could      be shown to the contrary, and this demand, which seems reasonable      and natural, since it is a mother's privilege as well as her duty      to suckle her infant when able to do so, has been insistently      made by others also. It has been supported from the legal side by      Weinberg (_Mutterschutz_, Sept., 1907). In France the Loi Roussel      forbids a woman to act as a wet-nurse until her child is seven      months old, and this has had an excellent effect in lowering      infantile mortality (A. Allee, _Puericulture et la Loi Roussel_,      These de Paris, 1908). In some parts of Germany manufacturers are      compelled to set up a suckling-room in the factory, where mothers      can give the breast to the child in the intervals of work. The      control and upkeep of these rooms, with provision of doctors and      nurses, is undertaken by the municipality (_Sexual-Probleme_,      Sept., 1908, p. 573).    As things are to-day in modern industrial countries the righting of these  wrongs cannot be left to Nature, that is, to the ignorant and untrained  impulses of persons who live in a whirl of artificial life where the voice  of instinct is drowned. The mother, we are accustomed to think, may be  trusted to see to the welfare of her child, and it is unnecessary, or even  \"immoral,\" to come to her assistance. Yet there are few things, I think,  more pathetic than the sight of a young Lancashire mother who works in the  mills, when she has to stay at home to nurse her sick child. She is used  to rise before day-break to go to the mill; she has scarcely seen her  child by the light of the sun, she knows nothing of its necessities, the  hands that are so skilful to catch the loom cannot soothe the child. The  mother gazes down at it in vague, awkward, speechless misery. It is not a  sight one can ever forget.    It is France that is taking the lead in the initiation of the scientific  and practical movements for the care of the young child before and after  birth, and it is in France that we may find the germs of nearly all the  methods now becoming adopted for arresting infantile mortality. The  village system of Villiers-le-Duc, near Dijon in the Cote d'Or, has proved  a germ of this fruitful kind. Here every pregnant woman not able to secure  the right conditions for her own life and that of the child she is  bearing, is able to claim the assistance of the village authorities; she  is entitled, without payment, to the attendance of a doctor and midwife  and to one franc a day during her confinement. The measures adopted in  this village have practically abolished both maternal and infantile  mortality. A few years ago Dr. Samson Moore, the medical officer of health  for Huddersfield, heard of this village, and Mr. Benjamin Broadbent, the  Mayor of Huddersfield, visited Villiers-le-Duc. It was resolved to  initiate in Huddersfield a movement for combating infant mortality.  Henceforth arose what is known as the Huddersfield scheme, a scheme which  has been fruitful in splendid results. The points of the Huddersfield  scheme are: (1) compulsory notification of births within forty-eight  hours; (2) the appointment of lady assistant medical officers of help to  visit the home, inquire, advise, and assist; (3) the organized aid of  voluntary lady workers in subordination to the municipal part of the  scheme; (4) appeal to the medical officer of help when the baby, not being  under medical care, fails to thrive. The infantile mortality of  Huddersfield has been very greatly reduced by this scheme.[16]        The Huddersfield scheme may be said to be the origin of the      English Notification of Births Act, which came into operation in      1908. This Act represents, in England, the national inauguration      of a scheme for the betterment of the race, the ultimate results      of which it is impossible to foresee. When this Act comes into      universal action every baby of the land will be entitled--legally      and not by individual caprice or philanthropic condescension--to      medical attention from the day of birth, and every mother will      have at hand the counsel of an educated woman in touch with the      municipal authorities. There could be no greater triumph for      medical science, for national efficiency, and the cause of      humanity generally. Even on the lower financial plane, it is easy      to see that an enormous saving of public and private money will      thus be effected. The Act is adoptive, and not compulsory. This      was a wise precaution, for an Act of this kind cannot be      effectual unless it is carried out thoroughly by the community      adopting it, and it will not be adopted until a community has      clearly realized its advantages and the methods of attaining      them.        An important adjunct of this organization is the School for      Mothers. Such schools, which are now beginning to spring up      everywhere, may be said to have their origins in the      _Consultations de Nourrissons_ (with their offshoot the _Goutte      de Lait_), established by Professor Budin in 1892, which have      spread all over France and been widely influential for good. At      the _Consultations_ infants are examined and weighed weekly, and      the mothers advised and encouraged to suckle their children. The      _Gouttes_ are practically milk dispensaries where infants for      whom breast-feeding is impossible are fed with milk under medical      supervision. Schools for Mothers represent an enlargement of the      same scheme, covering a variety of subjects which it is necessary      for a mother to know. Some of the first of these schools were      established at Bonn, at the Bavarian town of Weissenberg, and in      Ghent. At some of the Schools for Mothers, and notably at Ghent      (described by Mrs. Bertrand Russell in the _Nineteenth Century_,      1906), the important step has been taken of giving training to      young girls from fourteen to eighteen; they receive instruction      in infant anatomy and physiology, in the preparation of      sterilized milk, in weighing children, in taking temperatures and      making charts, in managing creches, and after two years are able      to earn a salary. In various parts of England, schools for young      mothers and girls on these lines are now being established, first      in London, under the auspices of Dr. F.J. Sykes, Medical Officer      of Health for St. Pancreas (see, e.g., _A School For Mothers_,      1908, describing an establishment of this kind at Somers Town,      with a preface by Sir Thomas Barlow; an account of recent      attempts to improve the care of infants in London will also be      found in the _Lancet_, Sept. 26, 1908). It may be added that some      English municipalities have established depots for supplying      mothers cheaply with good milk. Such depots are, however, likely      to be more mischievous than beneficial if they promote the      substitution of hand-feeding for suckling. They should never be      established except in connection with Schools for Mothers, where      an educational influence may be exerted, and no mother should be      supplied with milk unless she presents a medical certificate      showing that she is unable to nourish her child (Byers, \"Medical      Women and Public Health Questions,\" _British Medical Journal_,      Oct. 6, 1906). It is noteworthy that in England the local      authorities will shortly be empowered by law to establish Schools      for Mothers.        The great benefits produced by these institutions in France, both      in diminishing the infant mortality and in promoting the      education of mothers and their pride and interest in their      children, have been set forth in two Paris theses by G. Chaignon      (_Organisation des Consultations de Nourrissons a la Campagne_,      1908), and Alcide Alexandre (_Consultation de Nourrissons et      Goutte de Lait d'Arques_, 1908).        The movement is now spreading throughout Europe, and an      International Union has been formed, including all the      institutions specially founded for the protection of child life      and the promotion of puericulture. The permanent committee is in      Brussels, and a Congress of Infant Protection (_Goutte de Lait_)      is held every two years.    It will be seen that all the movements now being set in action for the  improvement of the race through the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13618"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Peterborough (#10)"],[1,"tannia,\"  published 1724:--\"The western Front is very Noble and Majestick of  Columel Work, and supported by three such tall Arches, as England can  scarcely shew the like, which are adorned with a great Variety of  curious Imagery. The Form of Arches is by the modern Architects called,  The Bull's Eye, not Semicircular. The whole is one of the noblest pieces  of Gothick Building in England.\"    =The Bell-tower=, which rises from the western transept, immediately  behind the north gable of the front (p. 37), is a little later than the  front itself. It is of good workmanship, and quite in keeping with the  older part. There are rows of lancets in the belfry stage, and the four  corner pinnacles are very similar to the large pinnacles that are placed  between the gables of the front, but all the lancets are pointed, and  there are little gables above each. This tower was once surmounted by a  wooden spire. When this was erected does not seem to be known. It was  not of particularly graceful design, judging from views of the cathedral  taken when it was standing. It was removed in the early part of the last  century (see page 25).    [Illustration: The West Front, restored according to Gunton, 1780.]    Passing round to the north side of the cathedral we are at once struck  with the beauty of the termination of the western transept. The arcading  on the north side of the tower of the front is identical with that on  the west side; but to the east there is only arcading in the three upper  stages. Mr. Paley's remarks upon the great windows of the western  transept may be quoted. He says[24] they \"deserve particular  examination, not only because they are very early and fine specimens  of cusped and traceried windows--indeed, among the best in the  kingdom--but for a remarkable peculiarity in the jambs; whereof one side  is Norman, with the square capitals to the jamb-shafts both within and  without, and the other Early English, as are the arch-mouldings and  hoods round the whole arches, which were probably semicircular at first,  for at present the point cuts through a stringcourse inside. The frames  of the entire windows are later work, having no attachment or bonding to  the jambs, as is clearly manifested to the eye.\" These windows rise as  high as the top of those of the triforium. Above is a round-headed  window with a slightly smaller arch on each side, with cushion capitals.  The gable itself is designedly made to resemble one of the gables of the  west front. It is surmounted by a cross, and bordered by the wavy  ornament; it has a rose window; and beneath is an arcade of five  round-headed trefoiled arches supported by shafts, having at the inner  wall three lancet windows. The circular window is without tracery; it  has twelve cusps. At each side of the gable is a pinnacle, almost a copy  of those on the front, except that the lowest stage is here octagonal  instead of square.    On the north side of the nave is a single door, now called =the Dean's  door=, of good Norman work. On each side are three shafts with cushion  capitals slightly ornamented; and in the round arches above are  different mouldings of the style. The windows to the aisle, ten in  number, are very broad, of five lights each, under depressed arches. The  tracery and mouldings indicate that these were substituted for the  original windows towards the close of the thirteenth century. At the  same time it would seem that the walls above, in the triforium range,  were heightened, because the parapet at the top is of Early English  work, although the three-light windows beneath it are Decorated, and  were not inserted until the next century. At the foot of the triforium  range is the original Norman arcade of round-headed arches: below the  existing Decorated windows is now a blank space of wall, where at first  was the Norman window, rising somewhat higher than the arcade. What the  original arrangement was can be seen on the east side of the north  transept. The Norman clerestory range has been altered only by having  Perpendicular tracery put in the windows, and by the addition of a  Decorated parapet. The original corbel-table was allowed to remain.    [Illustration: The Dean's Door.]    =The Lantern-tower= has on each face two large windows with transoms, of  three lights. The tracery is that known as net-tracery. Between these  windows is a blank window, if the term may be allowed; the tracery  exists, but there never was a window; it is in four divisions; while  between the windows and the corner turrets are similar traceries of two  parts. The whole is surmounted by a parapet above a plain arcade. The  corner turrets are octangular. As at present finished at the top there  is undoubtedly an appearance of their being incomplete.    The west side of the =North Transept= is a very excellent specimen of  Norman work; and we find less change here than in any other part of the  cathedral that belongs to the same period. The tracery of the windows is  Perpendicular, but the windows themselves are otherwise unaltered: at  the top of all is a Decorated parapet, which is here composed of a  series of quatrefoils; and the parapet to the corner turrets is not  Norman. As there is no aisle on the west side of this transept, there  has been no alteration in the wall, as was the case with the nave  aisles.    The north end of the transept is similar; but the shallow buttresses  between the windows rise to a greater height, and there is another  arcade above the upper tier of windows, and a blank arch in the gable.  The gable has crockets, and a cross at the apex. The lower Norman window  in the aisle here is unlike any others on this side of the church, but  there are four others like it on the south. The upper aisle window here  is of three lights, with a large pointed trefoil above them instead of  tracery.    The east wall of this transept is specially worthy of note. We can trace  the lines of the roof of the Lady Chapel which formerly stood to the  east of the wall; and beneath this are two bays of the original  triforium range, showing two of the simple Norman windows. Between these  and the roof are six Early English lancets. Below are the upper parts of  the two great arches which were constructed as an entrance to the Lady  Chapel. When the Lady Chapel was pulled down in the seventeenth century  these were converted into windows filled with late tracery in imitation  of Perpendicular work, and the lower part was walled up, except that a  doorway was constructed. This was afterwards blocked up for many years,  and only reopened during the recent restoration works. The same  alteration has been effected in the western part of the choir aisle, the  arches towards the Lady Chapel having been in like manner made into  windows. The lower window nearest the tower is a very graceful geometric  window of three lights, exactly like the three in the south transept;  the window above is of the same period as all the other Decorated  windows of the triforium range.    Between the Lady Chapel and the north aisle of the choir was a passage  (to which the two great arches were open), and at the eastern end of it  was a small vaulted chapel, the remains of which are clearly to be seen,  including the broken piscina. Above this were chambers, concerning which  Gunton[25] has preserved a tradition that they were \"the habitation of a  devout Lady, called Agnes, or Dame Agnes, out of whose Lodging-Chamber  there was a hole made askew in the window walled up, having its prospect  just upon the altar of the Ladies Chappel, and no more. It seems she was  devout in her generation, that she chose this place for her retirement,  and was desirous that her eyes, as well as ears, might wait upon her  publick Devotions.\" He says also that little is known of her except that  she was a benefactress to the church, and that a wood she bestowed upon  it is still called by her name.    [Illustration: Apse and New Building, from the South-East.]    At the extreme east is the =New Building=. Its side walls are built in  continuation of the walls of the choir aisles, and it has a square end.  It is lit by thirteen large windows, all of the same design, of which  the five at the east end, and the two most western of the sides, are of  four lights each, the remaining four having three lights each. Between  each pair of the latter there is no buttress; there are thus in all  twelve buttresses, six being at the east end. These are massive, having  to support the heavy fan-tracery within. Each buttress has a seated  figure at the top, commonly believed to represent an Apostle; but the  outlines are much worn, and it is not possible to distinguish them by  any symbols they may bear. There is a very handsome open parapet,  adorned with ornaments and shields bearing letters or monograms.    The parapet of quatrefoils, which runs round the sides of the transepts  and choir, is not continued in the apse; an Early English parapet, with  five circular medallions cusped, having been erected previously. The  Decorated windows of the apse are particularly fine. The arcade beneath  the upper tier, unlike the arcade in similar positions in other parts of  the church, is here intersecting.    The three beautiful geometric windows in the east wall of the =South  Transept=, which have three circles in the heads with five cusps, are  most likely of exactly the same design as the windows in the demolished  Lady Chapel. At the south end of this transept is a Norman door, and  outside are the remains of a short covered passage which communicated  with the cloisters. These will be described hereafter.    The south side of the nave differs only from the north side in its  having two doorways from the cloisters, in the superior elegance of the  south-west spire, and in the unfinished state of the south-west tower.
