Within the second circle, and using the same  centre, was drawn a third circle, of five feet in radius, and in each  part of the sectors, between the circumferences of the second and  third circles, were written the names of the seven types of spirits  most antagonistic to man's moral progress.[17]    Hamar had brought with him a sack--the same he had used to transport  Satan's corpse--and from out of it he produced a half-starved tabby,  that obviously could harm no one, owing to the fact that its head was  tied up in a muslin bag and its four legs strapped together.    \"It's a good thing there is no member of the Society for the  Prevention of Cruelty to Animals anywhere near,\" Kelson exclaimed,  eyeing Hamar resentfully. \"Wouldn't a mouse or a rat have done as  well?\"    \"No!\" Hamar ejaculated, depositing the brute with a plump on the  ground; \"the conditions are that the animal sacrificed must be a cat.  I got the poorest specimen I could find, for I dislike butchering just  as much as you do.\"    \"How are you going to do it?\" Kelson asked.    Hamar pointed to a chopper. \"The conditions say with steel,\" he said;  \"only with steel, and I should bungle with a knife. You must look the  other way. Now help me with the fire.\"    Besides the cat, the sack contained a dozen or so bundles of faggots,  well steeped in paraffin, several blocks of wood, a tripod, and a big  tin saucepan.    With the wood, a fire was soon kindled in the centre of the circle;  and the tripod placed over it. Two pints of spring water were then  poured into the saucepan, and to this were added 1 ounce of oxalic  acid, 1 ounce of verdigris, 1-1/2 ounces of hemlock leaves, 1/2 ounce  of henbane, 3/4 ounce of saffron, 2 ounces of aloes, 3 drachms of  opium, 1 ounce of mandrake-root, 5 drachms of salanum, 7 drachms of  poppy-seed, 1/2 ounce of assafoetida, and 1/2 ounce of parsley. As  soon as the saucepan containing these ingredients began to boil Hamar  threw into it two adders' heads, three toads and a centipede.    \"Where on earth did you get all those horrors?\" Curtis asked,  shrinking away from the bag which had held them.    \"Here,\" Hamar said laconically. \"It's extraordinary what a lot of  nasty things there are amid so much apparent beauty. I say apparent,  because Nature is a champion faker. You have only to rake about in  these bushes and you'll find snakes galore, whilst under pretty nearly  every stone are centipedes. Like both of you, who never by any chance  poke your noses outside the city, I fancied snakes and centipedes were  confined to the prairies. But I know better now. Besides, where do you  think I found the toads? Why, in the cellars under Meidlers'!\"    \"What, our late governor's?\" Kelson cried.    Hamar nodded. \"Yes!\" he said; \"under the very spot where we used to  sit. The water's a foot deep in that cellar, and if there are as many  toads in the cellars of the other houses in the block, then Sacramento  Street has a corner in them. I'm going to be executioner now, so look  the other way, Matt!\"    Kelson needed no second bidding; and sticking his fingers in his ears,  walked to some little distance. When Hamar called him back, the deed  was accomplished--the conditions prescribed in the rites had been  observed--the tabby was in the saucepan on the fire, and its blood had  been besprinkled on each of the seven sectors of the circle.    \"We must now take our seats on the ground,\" Hamar said; \"I'd better be  in the centre--you, Matt, on the right, and you, Ed, on the  left--allowing three clear feet between us.\"    Hamar showed them how to sit--with legs crossed and arms folded.    For some minutes no one spoke. The wind rustled through the bushes and  an owl hooted. Kelson, feeling the night air cold, drew his overcoat  tightly around and the others followed suit. Then Curtis said--    \"Do you really think there's anything in it, Leon? Aren't we fools to  go on wasting our time like this?\"    To which Hamar replied: \"Shut up! You were frightened enough doing the  tests!\"    From afar off, away on the shimmering bosom of the bay came the faint  hooting of a steamer.    \"That's the _Oleander_!\" Kelson murmured.    \"Rot!\" Curtis snapped. \"How do you know? You can't tell from this  distance. It might be the _Daisy_, or the _San Marie_, or any other  ship.\"    Kelson made no reply; Hamar blew his nose, and once again there was  silence.    The effect of the moonlight had now become weird. From the trees and  bushes crept legions of tall, gaunt shadows, and whilst some of these  were explicable, there were others that certainly had no apparent  counterparts in any of the natural objects around them. Even Curtis,  in spite of his scoffing, showed no inclination to examine them too  closely; but kept his face resolutely turned to the more cheery light  of the fire. The soft, cool, sweet-scented air gradually acted as an  anaesthetic, and Kelson and Curtis were almost asleep, when Hamar's  voice recalled them sharply to themselves.    \"It's just two!\" he said. \"Sit tight and listen while I repeat the  incantation, and for goodness' sake keep cool if anything happens.  Remember we are here with an object--namely--to get everything we can  out of the Other World.\"    \"Trust you for that!\" Curtis sneered; \"but all the same nothing's  going to happen.\"    \"I am not sure of that,\" Hamar said, and after a brief pause began to  repeat these words[18]--        \"Morbas from the mountains,      Where flow malignant fountains.        We are ready for you--Come!      Vampires from the passes,      Where grow blood-sucking grasses,        We are ready for you--Come!      Vice Elementals pretty      Give ear unto our ditty        We are ready for you--Come!      Planetians, forms so fearful,      We inform you, eager, tearful,        We are ready for you--Come!      Clanogrians, things of sorrow.      Postpone not till to-morrow,        We are ready for you--Come!      Barrowvians, shades seclusive,      Be not to us exclusive,        We are ready for you--Come!      Earthbound spirits of the Dead      Approach with grim and noiseless tread--        We are ready for you--Come!\"    He then got up and, going to the fire, sprinkled over the flames six  drachms of belladonna, three drachms of drosera and one ounce of nux  vomica; using in each case his left hand. Returning to his former  position he drew with the forefinger of his left hand, on the ground,  the outline of a club-foot; a hand with the fingers clenched and a  long pointed thumb standing upright; and a bat. At his request Kelson  and Curtis carefully imitated the devices, each in the space allotted  to him.    Hamar then cried: \"Creastie havoonen balababoo!\"; which Hamar  explained was Atlantean for \"devil of the damned appear!\"    \"He won't!\" Curtis muttered, \"because he doesn't exist. There are  devils--Meidler Brothers were devils--but there is no one devil! It's  all----\" He suddenly stopped and an intense hush fell upon them all.    A cloud obscured the moon, the fire burned dim, and the gloom of the  amphitheatre thickened till the men lost sight of each other. A cold  air then rose from the ground and fanned their nostrils. Something  flew past their heads with an ominous wail; whilst from the direction  of the fire came a hollow groan.    \"The advent of the Unknown,\" Hamar murmured, \"shall be heralded in by  the shrieking of an owl, the groaning of the mandrake--there is  mandrake in the saucepan--the croaking of a toad--we haven't had that  yet!\"    \"Yes, there it is!\" Kelson whispered--and whilst he was speaking there  came a dismal croak, croak, and the swaying and crying of an  ash--\"Hush!\"    They listened--and all three distinctly heard the swishing of a  slender tree trunk as it hissed backwards and forwards. Then, a cry so  horrid, harsh and piercing that even the sceptical, sneering Curtis  gave vent to an expression of fear. Again a hush, and increasing  darkness and cold. Kelson called out--    \"Don't do that, Leon.\"    \"I'm not doing anything,\" Hamar said testily. \"Pull yourself  together.\" A moment later he said to Curtis, \"It's you, Curtis. Shut  up. This is no time for monkeying.\"    \"You are both either mad or dreaming,\" Curtis replied. \"I haven't  stirred from my seat. Hulloa! What's that? What's that, Leon?  There--over there! Look!\"    As Curtis spoke they all three became conscious of living things  around them--things that moved about, silently and surreptitiously and  conveyed the impression of mockery. The hills, the valley, the trees  were full of it--the whole place teemed with it--teemed with silent,  subtle, stealthy mockery. The senses of the three men were now keenly  alive, but a dead weight hung upon their limbs and rendered them  useless. And as they stared into the gloom, in sickly fear, the  firelight flickered and they saw shadows, such as the moon, when low  in the heaven, might fashion from the figure of a man; but yet they  were shadows neither of man, nor God, nor of any familiar thing. They  were dark, vague, formless and indefinite, and they quivered--quivered  with a quivering that suggested mockery.    Suddenly the shadows disappeared; the flickering of the flames ceased;  and in the place of the fire appeared a seething, writhing mass of  what looked like white luminous snakes. And in the midst of this mass  sprang up a cylindrical form, which grew and grew until it attained a  height of ten or twelve feet, when it remained stationary and threw  out branches. And the three men now saw it was a tree--a tree with a  sleek, pulpy, semi-transparent, perspiring trunk full of a thick,  white, vibrating, luminous fluid; and that it was laden with a fruit,  in shape resembling an apple, but of the same hue and material as the  trunk. Spread out on the ground around it, were its roots, twitching  and palpitating with repulsive life, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14328"],[0,"The Consolation of Philosophy (#10)"],[1,"since the sole end is also happiness, it       is plain that this good and happiness are in essence the same.--CH.       XI. Unity is another aspect of goodness. Now, all things subsist so       long only as they preserve the unity of their being; when they lose       this unity, they perish. But the bent of nature forces all things       (plants and inanimate things, as well as animals) to strive to       continue in life. Therefore, all things desire unity, for unity is       essential to life. But unity and goodness were shown to be the       same. Therefore, good is proved to be the end towards which the       whole universe tends.[E]--CH. XII. Boethius acknowledges that he is       but recollecting truths he once knew. Philosophy goes on to show       that it is goodness also by which the whole world is governed.[F]       Boethius professes compunction for his former folly. But the       paradox of evil is introduced, and he is once more perplexed.      FOOTNOTES:    [E] This solves the second of the points left in doubt at the end of bk.  i., ch. vi.    [F] This solves the third. No distinct account is given of the first,  but an answer may be gathered from the general argument of bks. ii.,  iii., and iv.          BOOK III.        I.      She ceased, but I stood fixed by the sweetness of the song in wonderment  and eager expectation, my ears still strained to listen. And then after  a little I said: 'Thou sovereign solace of the stricken soul, what  refreshment hast thou brought me, no less by the sweetness of thy  singing than by the weightiness of thy discourse! Verily, I think not  that I shall hereafter be unequal to the blows of Fortune. Wherefore, I  no longer dread the remedies which thou saidst were something too severe  for my strength; nay, rather, I am eager to hear of them and call for  them with all vehemence.'    Then said she: 'I marked thee fastening upon my words silently and  intently, and I expected, or--to speak more truly--I myself brought  about in thee, this state of mind. What now remains is of such sort that  to the taste indeed it is biting, but when received within it turns to  sweetness. But whereas thou dost profess thyself desirous of hearing,  with what ardour wouldst thou not burn didst thou but perceive whither  it is my task to lead thee!'    'Whither?' said I.    'To true felicity,' said she, 'which even now thy spirit sees in dreams,  but cannot behold in very truth, while thine eyes are engrossed with  semblances.'    Then said I: 'I beseech thee, do thou show to me her true shape without  a moment's loss.'    'Gladly will I, for thy sake,' said she. 'But first I will try to sketch  in words, and describe a cause which is more familiar to thee, that,  when thou hast viewed this carefully, thou mayst turn thy eyes the other  way, and recognise the beauty of true happiness.'        SONG I.    THE THORNS OF ERROR.          Who fain would sow the fallow field,        And see the growing corn,      Must first remove the useless weeds,        The bramble and the thorn.        After ill savour, honey's taste        Is to the mouth more sweet;      After the storm, the twinkling stars        The eyes more cheerly greet.        When night hath past, the bright dawn comes        In car of rosy hue;      So drive the false bliss from thy mind,        And thou shall see the true.        II.      For a little space she remained in a fixed gaze, withdrawn, as it were,  into the august chamber of her mind; then she thus began:    'All mortal creatures in those anxious aims which find employment in so  many varied pursuits, though they take many paths, yet strive to reach  one goal--the goal of happiness. Now, _the good_ is that which, when a  man hath got, he can lack nothing further. This it is which is the  supreme good of all, containing within itself all particular good; so  that if anything is still wanting thereto, this cannot be the supreme  good, since something would be left outside which might be desired. 'Tis  clear, then, that happiness is a state perfected by the assembling  together of all good things. To this state, as we have said, all men try  to attain, but by different paths. For the desire of the true good is  naturally implanted in the minds of men; only error leads them aside out  of the way in pursuit of the false. Some, deeming it the highest good to  want for nothing, spare no pains to attain affluence; others, judging  the good to be that to which respect is most worthily paid, strive to  win the reverence of their fellow-citizens by the attainment of official  dignity. Some there are who fix the chief good in supreme power; these  either wish themselves to enjoy sovereignty, or try to attach themselves  to those who have it. Those, again, who think renown to be something of  supreme excellence are in haste to spread abroad the glory of their name  either through the arts of war or of peace. A great many measure the  attainment of good by joy and gladness of heart; these think it the  height of happiness to give themselves over to pleasure. Others there  are, again, who interchange the ends and means one with the other in  their aims; for instance, some want riches for the sake of pleasure and  power, some covet power either for the sake of money or in order to  bring renown to their name. So it is on these ends, then, that the aim  of human acts and wishes is centred, and on others like to these--for  instance, noble birth and popularity, which seem to compass a certain  renown; wife and children, which are sought for the sweetness of their  possession; while as for friendship, the most sacred kind indeed is  counted in the category of virtue, not of fortune; but other kinds are  entered upon for the sake of power or of enjoyment. And as for bodily  excellences, it is obvious that they are to be ranged with the above.  For strength and stature surely manifest power; beauty and fleetness of  foot bring celebrity; health brings pleasure. It is plain, then, that  the only object sought for in all these ways is _happiness_. For that  which each seeks in preference to all else, that is in his judgment the  supreme good. And we have defined the supreme good to be happiness.  Therefore, that state which each wishes in preference to all others is  in his judgment happy.    'Thou hast, then, set before thine eyes something like a scheme of human  happiness--wealth, rank, power, glory, pleasure. Now Epicurus, from a  sole regard to these considerations, with some consistency concluded the  highest good to be pleasure, because all the other objects seem to bring  some delight to the soul. But to return to human pursuits and aims:  man's mind seeks to recover its proper good, in spite of the mistiness  of its recollection, but, like a drunken man, knows not by what path to  return home. Think you they are wrong who strive to escape want? Nay,  truly there is nothing which can so well complete happiness as a state  abounding in all good things, needing nothing from outside, but wholly  self-sufficing. Do they fall into error who deem that which is best to  be also best deserving to receive the homage of reverence? Not at all.  That cannot possibly be vile and contemptible, to attain which the  endeavours of nearly all mankind are directed. Then, is power not to be  reckoned in the category of good? Why, can that which is plainly more  efficacious than anything else be esteemed a thing feeble and void of  strength? Or is renown to be thought of no account? Nay, it cannot be  ignored that the highest renown is constantly associated with the  highest excellence. And what need is there to say that happiness is not  haunted by care and gloom, nor exposed to trouble and vexation, since  that is a condition we ask of the very least of things, from the  possession and enjoyment of which we expect delight? So, then, these are  the blessings men wish to win; they want riches, rank, sovereignty,  glory, pleasure, because they believe that by these means they will  secure independence, reverence, power, renown, and joy of heart.  Therefore, it is _the good_ which men seek by such divers courses; and  herein is easily shown the might of Nature's power, since, although  opinions are so various and discordant, yet they agree in cherishing  _good_ as the end.'        SONG II.    THE BENT OF NATURE.          How the might of Nature sways      All the world in ordered ways,      How resistless laws control      Each least portion of the whole--      Fain would I in sounding verse      On my pliant strings rehearse.        Lo, the lion captive ta'en      Meekly wears his gilded chain;      Yet though he by hand be fed,      Though a master's whip he dread,      If but once the taste of gore      Whet his cruel lips once more,      Straight his slumbering fierceness wakes,      With one roar his bonds he breaks,      And first wreaks his vengeful force      On his trainer's mangled corse.        And the woodland songster, pent      In forlorn imprisonment,      Though a mistress' lavish care      Store of honeyed sweets prepare;      Yet, if in his narrow cage,      As he hops from bar to bar,      He should spy the woods afar,      Cool with sheltering foliage,      All these dainties he will spurn,      To the woods his heart will turn;      Only for the woods he longs,      Pipes the woods in all his songs.        To rude force the sapling bends,      While the hand its pressure lends;      If the hand its pressure slack,      Straight the supple wood springs back.      Phoebus in the western main      Sinks; but swift his car again      By a secret path is borne      To the wonted gates of morn.        Thus are all things seen to yearn      In due time for due return;      And no order fixed may stay,      Save which in th' appointed way      Joins the end to the beginning      In a steady cycle spinning.
