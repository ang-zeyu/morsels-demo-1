After Jacob had blessed the sons of Joseph, he called  his other sons around his dying bed to predict the future of their  descendants. Reuben the oldest was told that he would not excel, because  he had loved his father's concubine and committed a grievous sin. Simeon  and Levi were the most active in seeking to compass the death of Joseph,  and a curse was sent upon them. Judah was exalted above them all, for he  had sought to save Joseph, and was eloquent in pleading for  Benjamin,--the most magnanimous of the sons. So from him it was  predicted that the sceptre should not depart from his house until Shiloh  should come,--the Messiah, to whose appearance all the patriarchs  looked. And all that Jacob predicted about his sons to their remote  descendants came to pass; but the highest blessing was accorded to  Joseph, as was realized in the future ascendency of Ephraim.    When Jacob had made an end of his blessings and predictions he gathered  up his feet into his bed and gave up the ghost, and Joseph caused him to  be embalmed, as was the custom in Egypt. When the days of public  mourning were over (seventy days), Joseph obtained leave from Pharaoh to  absent himself from the kingdom and his government, to bury his father  according to his wish. And he departed in great pomp, with chariots and  horses, together with his brothers and a great number, and deposited the  remains of Jacob in the cave of the field of Machpelah, where Abraham  himself was buried, and then returned to his duties in Egypt.    It is not mentioned in the Scriptures how long Joseph retained his power  as prime minister of Pharaoh, but probably until a new dynasty succeeded  the throne,--the eighteenth as it is supposed, for we are told that a  new king arose who knew not Joseph. He lived to be one hundred and ten  years of age, and when he died his body was embalmed and placed in a  sarcophagus, and ultimately was carried to Canaan and buried with his  fathers, according to the oath or promise he exacted of his brothers.  His last recorded words were a prediction that God would bring the  children of Israel out of Egypt to the land which he sware unto Abraham,  Isaac, and Jacob. On his deathbed he becomes, like his father, a  prophet. He had foretold his own future elevation when only a youth of  seventeen, though only in the form of a dream, the full purport of which  he did not comprehend; as an old man, about to die, he predicts the  greatest blessing which could happen to his kindred,--their restoration  to the land promised unto Abraham.    Joseph is one of the most interesting characters of the Bible, one of  the most fortunate, and one of the most faultless. He resisted the most  powerful temptations, and there is no recorded act which sullies his  memory. Although most of his life was spent among idolaters, and he  married a pagan woman, he retained his allegiance to the God of his  fathers. He ever felt that he was a stranger in a strange land, although  its supreme governor, and looked to Canaan as the future and beloved  home of his family and race. He regarded his residence in Egypt only as  a means of preserving the lives of his kindred, and himself as an  instrument to benefit both his family and the country which he ruled.  His life was one of extraordinary usefulness. He had great executive  talents, which he exercised for the good of others. Though stern and  even hard in his official duties, he had unquenchable natural  affections. His heart went out to his old father, his brother Benjamin,  and to all his kindred with inexpressible tenderness. He was as free  from guile as he was from false pride. In giving instructions to his  brothers how they should appear before the King, and what they should  say when questioned as to their occupations, he advised the utmost  frankness,--to say that they were shepherds, although the occupation of  a shepherd was an abomination to an Egyptian. He had exceeding tact in  confronting the prejudices of the King and the priesthood. He took no  pains to conceal his birth and lineage in the most aristocratic country  of the world. Considering that he was only second in power and dignity  to an absolute monarch, his life was unostentatious and his  habits simple.    If we seek a parallel to him among modern statesmen, he most resembles  Colbert as the minister of Louis XIV.; or Prince Metternich, who in  great simplicity ruled Continental Europe for a quarter of a century.    Nothing is said of his palaces, or pleasures, or wealth. He had not the  austere and unbending pride of Mordecai, whose career as an instrument  of Providence for the welfare of his countrymen was as remarkable as  Joseph's. He was more like Daniel in his private life than any of those  Jews who have arisen to great power in foreign lands, though he had not  Daniel's exalted piety or prophetic gifts. He was faithful to the  interests of his sovereign, and greatly increased the royal authority.  He got possession of the whole property of the nation for the benefit of  his master, but exacted only a fifth part of the produce of the land for  the support of the government. He was a priest of a grossly polytheistic  religion, but acknowledged only the One Supreme God, whose instrument he  felt himself to be. His services to the state were transcendent, but his  supremest mission was to preserve the Hebrew nation.    The condition of the Israelites in Egypt after the death of Joseph, and  during the period of their sojourn, it is difficult to determine. There  is a doubt among the critics as to the length of this sojourn,--the  Bible in several places asserting that it lasted four hundred and thirty  years, which, if true, would bring the Exodus to the end of the  nineteenth dynasty. Some suppose that the residence in Egypt was only  two hundred and fifteen years. The territory assigned to the Israelites  was a small one, and hence must have been densely populated, if, as it  is reckoned, two millions of people left the country under the  leadership of Moses and Aaron. It is supposed that the reigning  sovereign at that time was Menephtah, successor of Rameses II. It is,  then, the great Rameses, who was the king from whom Moses fled,--the  most distinguished of all the Egyptian monarchs as warrior and builder  of monuments. He was the second king of the eighteenth dynasty, and  reigned in conjunction with his father Seti for sixty years. Among his  principal works was the completion of the city of Rameses (Raamses, or  Tanis, or Zoan), one of the principal cities of Egypt, begun by his  father and made a royal residence. He also, it appears from the  monuments, built Pithon and other important towns, by the forced labor  of the Israelites. Rameses and Pithon were called treasure-cities, the  site of the latter having been lately discovered, to the east of Tanis.  They were located in the midst of a fertile country, now dreary and  desolate, which was the object of great panegyric. An Egyptian poet,  quoted by Dr. Charles S. Robinson, paints the vicinity of Zoan, where  Pharaoh resided at the time of the Exodus, as full of loveliness and  fertility. \"Her fields are verdant with excellent herbage; her bowers  bloom with garlands; her pools are prolific in fish; and in the ponds  are ducks. Each garden is perfumed with the smell of honey; the  granaries are full of wheat and barley; vegetables and reeds and herbs  are growing in the parks; flowers and nosegays are in the houses;  lemons, citrons, and figs are in the orchards.\" Such was the field of  Zoan in ancient times, near Rameses, which the Israelites had built  without straw to make their bricks, and from which place they set out  for the general rendezvous at Succoth, under Moses. It will be noted  that if Rameses, or Tanis, was the residence of the court when Moses  made his demands on Menephtah, it was in the midst of the settlements of  the Israelites, in the land of Goshen, which the last of the Shepherd  Kings had assigned to them.    It is impossible to tell what advance in civilization was made by the  Israelites in consequence of their sojourn in Egypt; but they must have  learned many useful arts, and many principles of jurisprudence, and  acquired a better knowledge of agriculture. They learned to be patient  under oppression and wrong, to be frugal and industrious in their  habits, and obedient to the voice of their leaders. But unfortunately  they acquired a love of idolatrous worship, which they did not lose  until their captivity in Babylon. The golden calves of the wilderness  were another form of the worship of the sacred bulls of Memphis. They  were easily led to worship the sun under the Egyptian and Canaanitish  names. Had the children of Israel remained in the promised land, in the  early part of their history, they would probably have perished by  famine, or have been absorbed by their powerful Canaanitish neighbors.  In Egypt they were well fed, rapidly increased in number, and became a  nation to be feared even while in bondage. In the land of Canaan they  would have been only a pastoral or nomadic people, unable to defend  themselves in war, and unacquainted with the use of military weapons.  They might have been exterminated, without constant miracles and  perpetual supernatural aid,--which is not the order of Providence.    In Egypt, it is true, the Israelites lost their political independence;  but even under slavery there is much to be learned from civilized  masters. How rapid and marvellous the progress of the African races in  the Southern States in their two hundred years of bondage! When before  in the history of the world has there been such a progress among mere  barbarians, with fetichism for their native religion?

People have a right to use water any  way so long as they don't throw it unfairly upon others or drown  themselves; and if three-fourths of the people who now laugh at  adult baptism would undergo a dipping next Sunday, and then stick to  water for the remainder of their lives, they would be better  citizens, whatever might become of their theology.    The Rev. J. O'Dell is the pastor of Fishergate Baptist Chapel, and  he is an exemplary man in his way, for be only receives a small  salary and yet contrives to keep out of debt--a thing which a good  deal of parsons, and which many of the ordinary children of grace,  can't accomplish. He is well liked by his congregation, and we have  heard of no fighting over either his virtues or defects. He has  quite a clerical look, and, if he hadn't, his voice would give the  cue to his profession. There is an earnest unctuous modulation about  it, which, as a rule, is acquired after men have flung overboard the  common idioms of secular life. The salary of Mr. O'Dell is about 160  pounds a year, and although he would like more, he can make himself  and Mrs. O'Dell, and the younger branches of the house of O'Dell,  comfortable on that sum. Some pastors gnash their teeth if their  purse strings are opened for less than 300 pounds a year; Mr. O'Dell  would purchase a pair of wings, and sing \"'Tis like a little heaven  below,\" if his stipend was raised to that figure. There is nothing  very extraordinary in the preaching style of Mr. O'Dell. It lacks  the cunning of that rare old Baptist bird, who once went by the name  of Birney, and it is devoid of that learned and masterly eloquence  so finely worked by the last minister of the chapel, who used to  read some of his sermons over to the deacons, before trying them  upon the other sinners in the chapel; still it is sincere, straight-  forward, and theologically sound. It never reaches a point of  raving, is never loudly pretentious, or ferocious in tone. Mr.  O'Dell will never be a brilliant man; but he is now what is often  much better--a good working minister. He will never occupy the  position of a commander, will never even be a lieutenant, but he  will always be a good soldier in the ranks. He has neither a lofty  imaginative capacity nor a dashing ratiocinative faculty, but he has  a clear sense of the importance of his pastoral duties, he goes  easily and earnestly to work, makes neither much fuss nor smoke, and  if he does now and then seem to pull queer faces in his sermons--  give odd twists to some of his muscles--that does not debar him from  preaching fair even-sounding sermons, soothing to his general  hearers and pleasing to those who have to pay him. There are a few  people whom Mr. O'Dell's sermons fail to keep awake; but as such  parties are probably better asleep than in a full state of  consciousness, no great harm is done. He has all sorts of folk to  deal with--men who are pious, and smooth creatures quietly given to  humbug; people who practice what they are taught, and a few so  wonderfully good that if they called a meeting of their creditors  they would begin the business by saying, \"Let us pray;\" individuals  who follow their duties calmly, and make no show about their work;  and respectable specimens of indifference, who go to chapel because  it is fashionable to do so. But they seem all complacent, and the  \"happy family\" element predominates. Mr. O'Dell suits them; they  suit Mr. O'Dell; and if he had only a fuller chapel--a better  salary, too, wouldn't be despised by him--he could send up his  orisons with more courage, and preach to the sinners around him with  the steam hammer force of a Gadsby.        No. VI.        ST. GEORGE'S CHURCH.        \"My respecks to St. George and the Dragoon,\" wrote the gay and  festive showman, at the conclusion of an epistle--penned under the  very shadow of \"moral wax statters\"--to the Prince of Wales. And  there was no evil in such a benevolent expression of feeling.  George, the particular party referred to, occupies a prominent  position in our national escutcheonry, ant the \"Dragoon\" is a unique  creature always in his company, which it would be wrong to entirely  forget. The name of the saint sounds essentially English, and it has  been woven into the country's history. The nation is fond of its  Georges. We had four kings--not all of a saintly disposition--who  rejoiced in that name; we sometimes swear by the name of George; and  it plays as good a part as any other cognomen in our universal  system of christening. Nobody can really tell who St. George was,  and nobody will ever be able to do so. Gibbon fancies he was at one  time an unscrupulous bacon dealer, and that he finally did  considerable business in religious gammon. Butler, the Romish  historian, thinks he was martyred by Diocletian for telling that  amiable being a little of his mind; ancient fabulists make it out  that be killed a dragon, saved a fair virgin's life, and then did  something better than either--married her; medieval men, with a  knightly turn of mind, transmuted him into the patron of chivalry;  Edward III made him the patron of the Order of the Garter; the  Eastern and Western churches venerate him yet; Britains have turned  him into their country's tutelary saint; and many places of worship  have been dedicated to this curiously mythologic individual. We have  a church in Preston in this category; and it is of such church--St.  George's--we shall speak now.    In 1723 it was erected. Up to that time the Parish Church was the  only place of worship we had in connection with what is termed \"the  Establishment;\" St. George's was brought into existence as a \"chapel  of ease\" for it; and it is still one of the easiest, quietest, best  behaved places in the town. It was a plain brick edifice at the  beginning, but in 1843-4 the face of the church was hardened--it was  turned into stone, and it continues to have a substantial petrified  appearance. In 1848 a new chancel was built; and afterwards a dash  of Christian patriotism resulted in a new pulpit and reading desk.  The general building, which is of cruciform shape, has a subdued,  solemn, half-genteel, half-quaint look. There is neither  architectural maze nor ornamental flash in its construction. It is  plain all round, and is characterised by a simplicity of style which  could not be well reduced unless a severe plainness were adopted.  Its position is not in a very imposing locality, and the roads to it  are bad and irregular. Baines, the historian, says that St. George's  Church is situated between Fishergate and Friargate--rather a wide  definition applicable to about 500 other places ranging from  billiard rooms to foundries, from brewing yards to bedstead  warehouses in the same region. That brightest of all our historical  blades, \"P. Whittle, F.A.S.,\" states that it is located on the  south-west side of Friargate--a better, but still very mystical,  exposition to all not actually acquainted with the place; whilst  Hardwicke comes up to the rescue in the panoply of modern exactness,  and tells us that it is on the south side of Fishergate. These  historians must have missed their way in trying to find the place,  and in their despair guessed at its real situation. There are many  ways to St. George's--you can get to it from Fishergate, Lune-  street, Friargate, or the Market place; but if each of those ways  was thrown into one complete whole, the road would still be  fifteenth rate. Tortuousness and dimness mark them, and a strong  backyard spirit of adventure must operate largely in the minds of  some who manage to reach the building.    The churchyard of St. George's has nothing interesting to the common  mind about it. The great bulk of the grave stones are put flat upon  the ground--arranged so that people can walk over them with ease and  comfort, whatever may become of the letters; and if it were not for  a few saplings which shoot out their bright foliage periodically,  and one very ancient little tree which has become quite tired of  that business, the yard would look very grave and monotonous. The  principal entrance can be reached by way of Lune-street or Chapel-  walks; but when you have got to it, there is nothing very peculiar  to be seen. It is plain, rather gloomy, and in no way interesting.    The interior of the church wears a somewhat similar complexion; but  it improves by observation, and in the end you like it for its  thorough simplicity. No place of worship can in its internal  arrangements be much plainer than St. George's. If it were not for  three stained windows in the chancel, which you can but faintly make  out at a distance, nothing which could by any possibility be termed  ornamental would at first sight strike you. On reaching the centre  of the place you get a moderately clear view of the pulpit which  somewhat edifies the mind; and, on turning right round, you see a  magnificent organ which compensates for multitudes of defects, and  below it--in front of the orchestra--a rather powerful  representation of the royal arms, a massive lion and unicorn,  \"fighting for the crown\" as usual, and got up in polished wood work.  We see no reason why there should not be something put up  contiguously, emblematic of St. George and the dragon. It is very  unfair to the saint and unjust to the dragon to ignore them  altogether--The Ten Commandments are put on one side in this church-  -not done away with, but erected in a lateral position, very near a  corner and somewhat out of the way. One of the historians previously  quoted says that St. George's used to be \"heated by what is commonly  called a cockle\"--some sort of a warmth radiating apparatus, which  he describes minutely"]]]
