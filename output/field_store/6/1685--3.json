In the second case the outer series  (calyx of sepals) is generally green and leaf-like, its function being  to protect the rest of the flower, especially in the bud; while  the inner series (corolla of petals) is generally white or brightly  coloured, and more delicate in structure, its function being to  attract the particular insect or bird by agency of which pollination  is effected. The insect, &c., is attracted by the colour and scent  of the flower, and frequently also by honey which is secreted in some  part of the flower. (For further details on the form and arrangement  of the flower and its parts, see FLOWER.)      _Stamen and pollen._    Each stamen generally bears four pollen-sacs (_microsporangia_)  which are associated to form the anther, and carried up on a stalk  or filament. The development of the microsporangia and the contained  spores (pollen-grains) is closely comparable with that of the  microsporangia in Gymnosperms or heterosporous ferns. The pollen is  set free by the opening (dehiscence) of the anther, generally by means  of longitudinal slits, but sometimes by pores, as in the heath family  (Ericaceae), or by valves, as in the barberry. It is then dropped  or carried by some external agent, wind, water or some member of the  animal kingdom, on to the receptive surface of the carpel of the same  or another flower. The carpel, or aggregate of carpels forming the  pistil or gynaeceum, comprises an ovary containing one or more ovules  and a receptive surface or stigma; the stigma is sometimes carried up  on a style. The mature pollen-grain is, like other spores, a single  cell; except in the case of some submerged aquatic plants, it has  a double wall, a thin delicate wall of unaltered cellulose, the  endospore or intine, and a tough outer cuticularized exospore or  extine. The exospore often bears spines or warts, or is variously  sculptured, and the character of the markings is often of value  for the distinction of genera or higher groups. Germination of the  microspore begins before it leaves the pollen-sac. In very few cases  has anything representing prothallial development been observed;  generally a small cell (the antheridial or generative cell) is cut  off, leaving a larger tube-cell. When placed on the stigma, under  favourable circumstances, the pollen-grain puts forth a pollen-tube  which grows down the tissue of the style to the ovary, and makes its  way along the placenta, guided by projections or hairs, to the mouth  of an ovule. The nucleus of the tube-cell has meanwhile passed into  the tube, as does also the generative nucleus which divides to  form two male- or sperm-cells. The male-cells are carried to their  destination in the tip of the pollen-tube.    [v.02 p.0011]      _Pistil and embryo-sac._    The ovary contains one or more ovules borne on a placenta, which is  generally some part of the ovary-wall. The development of the ovule,  which represents the macrosporangium, is very similar to the  process in Gymnosperms; when mature it consists of one or two coats  surrounding the central nucellus, except at the apex where an opening,  the micropyle, is left. The nucellus is a cellular tissue enveloping  one large cell, the embryo-sac or macrospore. The germination of the  macrospore consists in the repeated division of its nucleus to form  two groups of four, one group at each end of the embryo-sac. One  nucleus from each group, the polar nucleus, passes to the centre of  the sac, where the two fuse to form the so-called definitive nucleus.  Of the three cells at the micropylar end of the sac, all naked cells  (the so-called egg-apparatus), one is the egg-cell or oosphere, the  other two, which may be regarded as representing abortive egg-cells  (in rare cases capable of fertilization), are known as synergidae.  The three cells at the opposite end are known as antipodal cells  and become invested with a cell-wall. The gametophyte or prothallial  generation is thus extremely reduced, consisting of but little more  than the male and female sexual cells--the two sperm-cells in the  pollen-tube and the egg-cell (with the synergidae) in the embryo-sac.      _Fertilization._    At the period of fertilization the embryo-sac lies in close proximity  to the opening of the micropyle, into which the pollen-tube has  penetrated, the separating cell-wall becomes absorbed, and the male or  sperm-cells are ejected into the embryo-sac. Guided by the synergidae  one male-cell passes into the oosphere with which it fuses, the two  nuclei uniting, while the other fuses with the definitive nucleus, or,  as it is also called, the endosperm nucleus. This remarkable  double fertilization as it has been called, although only recently  discovered, has been proved to take place in widely-separated  families, and both in Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons, and there is  every probability that, perhaps with variations, it is the normal  process in Angiosperms. After impregnation the fertilized oosphere  immediately surrounds itself with a cell-wall and becomes the oospore  which by a process of growth forms the embryo of the new plant. The  endosperm-nucleus divides rapidly to produce a cellular tissue which  fills up the interior of the rapidly-growing embryo-sac, and forms a  tissue, known as endosperm, in which is stored a supply of nourishment  for the use later on of the embryo. It has long been known that after  fertilization of the egg has taken place, the formation of endosperm  begins from the endosperm nucleus, and this had come to be regarded as  the recommencement of the development of a prothallium after a pause  following the reinvigorating union of the polar nuclei. This view is  still maintained by those who differentiate two acts of fertilization  within the embryo-sac, and regard that of the egg by the first  male-cell, as the true or generative fertilization, and that of the  polar nuclei by the second male gamete as a vegetative fertilization  which gives a stimulus to development in correlation with the other.  If, on the other hand, the endosperm is the product of an act of  fertilization as definite as that giving rise to the embryo itself,  we have to recognize that twin-plants are produced within the  embryo-sac--one, the embryo, which becomes the angiospermous plant,  the other, the endosperm, a short-lived, undifferentiated nurse to  assist in the nutrition of the former, even as the subsidiary embryos  in a pluri-embryonic Gymnosperm may facilitate the nutrition of the  dominant one. If this is so, and the endosperm like the embryo is  normally the product of a sexual act, hybridization will give a hybrid  endosperm as it does a hybrid embryo, and herein (it is suggested) we  may have the explanation of the phenomenon of xenia observed in the  mixed endosperms of hybrid races of maize and other plants, regarding  which it has only been possible hitherto to assert that they were  indications of the extension of the influence of the pollen beyond the  egg and its product. This would not, however, explain the formation  of fruits intermediate in size and colour between those of crossed  parents. The signification of the coalescence of the polar nuclei is  not explained by these new facts, but it is noteworthy that the second  male-cell is said to unite sometimes with the apical polar nucleus,  the sister of the egg, before the union of this with the basal polar  one. The idea of the endosperm as a second subsidiary plant is no new  one; it was suggested long ago in explanation of the coalescence of  the polar nuclei, but it was then based on the assumption that these  represented male and female cells, an assumption for which there  was no evidence and which was inherently improbable. The proof of a  coalescence of the second male nucleus with the definitive nucleus  gives the conception a more stable basis. The antipodal cells aid more  or less in the process of nutrition of the developing embryo, and may  undergo multiplication, though they ultimately disintegrate, as do  also the synergidae. As in Gymnosperms and other groups an interesting  qualitative change is associated with the process of fertilization.  The number of chromosomes (see PLANTS: _Cytology_) in the nucleus of  the two spores, pollen-grain and embryo-sac, is only half the number  found in an ordinary vegetative nucleus; and this reduced number  persists in the cells derived from them. The full number is restored  in the fusion of the male and female nuclei in the process of  fertilization, and remains until the formation of the cells from which  the spores are derived in the new generation.    In several natural orders and genera departures from the course of  development just described have been noted. In the natural order  Rosaceae, the series Querciflorae, and the very anomalous genus  _Casuarina_ and others, instead of a single macrospore a more or less  extensive sporogenous tissue is formed, but only one cell proceeds to  the formation of a functional female cell. In _Casuarina_, _Juglans_  and the order Corylaceae, the pollen-tube does not enter by means  of the micropyle, but passing down the ovary wall and through the  placenta, enters at the chalazal end of the ovule. Such a method  of entrance is styled chalazogamic, in contrast to the porogamic or  ordinary method of approach by means of the micropyle.      _Embryology._    The result of fertilization is the development of the ovule into  the seed. By the segmentation of the fertilized egg, now invested by  cell-membrane, the embryo-plant arises. A varying number of transverse  segment-walls transform it into a pro-embryo--a cellular row of which  the cell nearest the micropyle becomes attached to the apex of the  embryo-sac, and thus fixes the position of the developing embryo,  while the terminal cell is projected into its cavity.

I kin still 'member Daddy comin' over to Marse Henry's plantation  to see us.    \"Marse Henry kept a lot of slaves to wuk his big old plantation whar he  growed jus' evvything us needed to eat and wear 'cept sugar and coffee  and de brass toes for our home-made, brogan shoes. Dere allus was  a-plenty t'eat and wear on dat place.    \"Slave quarters was log cabins built in long rows. Some had chimblies in  de middle, twixt two rooms, but de most of 'em was jus' one-room cabins  wid a stick and mud chimbly at de end. Dem chimblies was awful bad 'bout  ketchin' on fire. Didn't nobody have no glass windows. Dey jus' had  plain plank shutters for blinds and de doors was made de same way, out  of rough planks. All de beds was home-made and de best of 'em was  corded. Dey made holes in de sides and foots and haidpieces, and run  heavy home-made cords in dem holes. Dey wove 'em crossways in and out of  dem holes from one side to another 'til dey had 'em ready to lay de  mattress mat on. I'se helped to pull dem cords tight many a time. Our  mattress ticks was made of homespun cloth and was stuffed wid wheat  straw. 'Fore de mattress tick was put on de bed a stiff mat wove out of  white oak splits was laid on top of de cords to pertect de mattress and  make it lay smooth. Us was 'lowed to pick up all de old dirty cotton  'round de place to make our pillows out of.    \"Jus' a few of de slave famblies was 'lowed to do deir own cookin'  'cause Marster kept cooks up at de big house what never had nothin' else  to do but cook for de white folks and slaves. De big old fireplace in  dat kitchen at de big house was more dan eight feet wide and you could  pile whole sticks of cord-wood on it. It had racks acrost to hang de  pots on and big ovens and little ovens and big, thick, iron fryin' pans  wid long handles and hefty iron lids. Dey could cook for a hunderd  people at one time in dat big old kitchen easy. At one time dere was  tables acrost one end of de kitchen for de slaves t'eat at, and de slave  chillun et dar too.    \"Marster was mighty good to slave chillun. He never sont us out to wuk  in de fields 'til us was 'most growed-up, say 12 or 14 years old. A  Nigger 12 or 14 years old dem days was big as a white child 17 or 18  years old. Why Miss, Niggers growed so fast, dat most of de Nigger  nurses warn't no older dan de white chillun dey tuk keer of. Marster  said he warn't gwine to send no babies to de fields. When slave chillun  got to be 'bout 9 or 10 years old dey started 'em to fetchin' in wood  and water, cleanin' de yards, and drivin' up de cows at night. De  bigges' boys was 'lowed to measure out and fix de stock feed, but de  most of us chillun jus' played in de cricks and woods all de time.  Sometimes us played Injuns and made so much fuss dat old Aunt Nancy  would come out to de woods to see what was wrong, and den when she found  us was jus' a-havin' fun, she stropped us good for skeerin' her.    \"Mammy's job was to make all de cloth. Dat was what she done all de  time; jus' wove cloth. Some of de others cyarded de bats and spun  thread, but Mammy, she jus' wove on so reg'lar dat she made enough cloth  for clothes for all dem slaves on de plantation and, it's a fact, us did  have plenty of clothes. All de nigger babies wore dresses made jus' alak  for boys and gals. I was sho'ly mighty glad when dey 'lowed me to git  rid of dem dresses and wear shirts. I was 'bout 5 years old den, but dat  boys' shirt made me feel powerful mannish. Slave gals wore homespun  cotton dresses, and dey had plenty of dem dresses, so as dey could keep  nice and clean all de time. Dey knitted all de socks and stockin's for  winter. Dem gals wore shawls, and dere poke bonnets had ruffles 'round  'em. All de shoes was home-made too. Marster kept one man on de  plantation what didn't do nothin' but make shoes. Lordy, Missy! What  would gals say now if dey had to wear dem kind of clothes? Dey would  raise de roof plumb offen de house. But jus' let me tell you, a purty  young gal dressed in dem sort of clothes would look mighty sweet to me  right now.    \"Us never could eat all de meat in Marster's big old smokehouse.  Sometimes he tuk hams to de store and traded 'em for sugar and coffee.  Plenty of 'bacco was raised on dat plantation for all de white folks and  de growed-up Niggers. Slave chillun warn't sposen to have none, so us  had to swipe what 'bacco us got. If our Mammies found out 'bout us  gittin' 'bacco, dey stropped us 'til de skin was most off our backs, but  sometimes us got away wid a little. If us seed any of de old folks was  watchin' us, us slipped de 'bacco from one to another of us whilst dey  s'arched us, and it went mighty bad on us if dey found it.    \"Slaves went to de white folks' church and listened to de white  preachers. Dere warn't no colored preacher 'lowed to preach in dem  churches den. Dey preached to de white folks fust and den dey let de  colored folks come inside and hear some preachin' atter dey was through  wid de white folks. But on de big 'vival meetin' days dey 'lowed de  Niggers to come in and set in de gallery and listen at de same time dey  preached to de white folks. When de sermon was over dey had a big dinner  spread out on de grounds and dey had jus' evvything good t'eat lak  chickens, barbecued hogs and lambs, pies, and lots of watermelons. Us  kept de watermelons in de crick 'til dey was ready to cut 'em. A white  gentleman, what dey called Mr. Kilpatrick, done most of de preachin'. He  was from de White Plains neighborhood. He sho' did try mighty hard to  git evvybody to 'bey de Good Lord and keep his commandments.    \"Mr. Kilpatrick preached all de funerals too. It 'pears lak a heap more  folks is a-dyin' out dese days dan died den, and folks was a heap better  den to folks in trouble. Dey would go miles and miles den when dey  didn't have no auto'biles, to help folks what was in trouble. Now, dey  won't go next door when dere's death in de house. Den, when anybody died  de fust thing dey done was to shroud 'em and lay 'em out on de coolin'  board 'til Old Marster's cyarpenter could git de coffin made up. Dere  warn't no embalmers dem days and us had to bury folks de next day atter  dey died. De coffins was jus' de same for white folks and deir slaves.  On evvy plantation dere was a piece of ground fenced in for a graveyard  whar dey buried white folks and slaves too. My old Daddy is buried down  yonder on Marse Henry's plantation right now.    \"When a slave wanted to git married up wid a gal, he didn't ax de gal,  but he went and told Marster 'bout it. Marster would talk to de gal and  if she was willin', den Marster would tell all de other Niggers us was  a-goin' to have a weddin'. Dey would all come up to de big house and  Marster would tell de couple to jine hands and jump backwards over a  broomstick, and den he pernounced 'em man and wife. Dey didn't have to  have no licenses or nothin' lak dey does now. If a man married up wid  somebody on another place, he had to git a pass from his Marster, so as  he could go see his wife evvy Wednesday and Sadday nights. When de  patterollers cotched slaves out widout no passes, dey evermore did beat  'em up. Leastways dat's what Mammy told me.    \"Durin' de big war all de white folkses was off a-fightin' 'cept dem  what was too old to fight or what was too bad crippled and 'flicted. Dey  stayed home and looked atter de 'omans and chillun. Somebody sont  Mist'ess word dat dem yankees was on de way to our plantation and she  hid evvything she could, den had de hogs and hosses driv off to de  swamps and hid. Mammy was crazy 'bout a pet pig what Marster had done  give her, so Mist'ess told her to go on down to dat swamp quick, and  hide dat little pig. Jus' as she was a-runnin' back in de yard, dem  yankees rid in and she seed 'em a-laughin' fit to kill. She looked  'round to see what dey was tickled 'bout and dere followin' her lak a  baby was dat pig. Dem yankees was perlite lak, and dey never bothered  nothin' on our place, but dey jus' plumb ruint evvything on some of de  plantations right close to our'n. Dey tuk nigh evvything some of our  neighbors had t'eat, most all deir good hosses, and anything else dey  wanted. Us never did know why dey never bothered our white folkses'  things.    \"When dey give us our freedom us went right on over to Marse Billie  Battle's place and stayed dar wid Daddy 'bout a year; den Daddy come wid  us back to Marse Henry's, and dar us stayed 'til Old Marster died. Long  as he lived atter de war, he wukked most of his help on sheers, and seed  dat us was tuk keer of jus' lak he had done when us all b'longed to him.  Us never went to school much 'cause Mammy said white folks didn't lak  for Niggers to have no larnin', but atter de war was done over our Old  Mist'ess let colored chillun have some lessons in a little cabin what  was built in de back yard for de white chillun to go to school in.    \"Atter dey buried our Old Marster, us moved down to Hancock County and  farmed dar, 'cause dat was all us knowed how to do. Us got together and  raised money to buy ground enough for a churchyard and a graveyard for  colored folks. Dat graveyard filled up so fast dat dey had to buy more  land several times. Us holped 'em build de fust colored church in  Hancock County.    \"School for colored chillun was held den in our church house. Our  teacher was a white man, Mr. Tom Andrews, and he was a mighty good  teacher, but Lordy, how strick he was! Dese here chillun don't know  nothin' 'bout school. Us went early in de mornin', tuk our dinner in a  bucket, and never left 'til four o'clock, and sometimes dat was 'most  nigh sundown. All day us studied dat blue back speller, and dat white  teacher of ours"]]]
