ARNOLD,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9845"],[0,"The Spy (#1)"],[1,"ENGLISH CLASSICS    THE SPY    A TALE OF THE NEUTRAL GROUND    BY JAMES FENIMORE COOPER    EDITED BY    NATHANIEL WARING BARNES    PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH COMPOSITION  IN DE PAUW UNIVERSITY  GREENCASTLE, INDIANA          JAMES FENIMORE COOPER    \"I believe I could write a better story myself!\" With these words, since  become famous, James Fenimore Cooper laid aside the English novel which  he was reading aloud to his wife. A few days later he submitted several  pages of manuscript for her approval, and then settled down to the task  of making good his boast. In November, 1820, he gave the public a novel  in two volumes, entitled _Precaution_. But it was published anonymously,  and dealt with English society in so much the same way as the average  British novel of the time that its author was thought by many to be an  Englishman. It had no originality and no real merit of any kind. Yet it  was the means of inciting Cooper to another attempt. And this second  novel made him famous.    When _Precaution_ appeared, some of Cooper's friends protested against  his weak dependence on British models. Their arguments stirred his  patriotism, and he determined to write another novel, using thoroughly  American material. Accordingly he turned to Westchester County, where he  was then living, a county which had been the scene of much stirring  action during a good part of the Revolutionary War, and composed _The  Spy--A Tale of the Neutral Ground_. This novel was published in 1821,  and was immediately popular, both in this country and in England. Soon  it was translated into French, then into other foreign languages, until  it was read more widely than any other tale of the century. Cooper had  written the first American novel. He had also struck an original  literary vein, and he had gained confidence in himself as a writer.    Following this pronounced success in authorship, Cooper set to work on a  third book and continued for the remainder of his life to devote most of  his time to writing. Altogether he wrote over thirty novels and as many  more works of a miscellaneous character. But much of this writing has no  interest for us at the present time, especially that which was  occasioned by the many controversies in which the rather belligerent  Cooper involved himself. His work of permanent value after _The Spy_  falls into two groups, the tales of wilderness life and the sea tales.  Both these groups grew directly out of his experiences in early life.    Cooper was born on September 15, 1789, in Burlington, New Jersey, but  while still very young he was taken to Cooperstown, on the shores of  Otsego Lake, in central New York. His father owned many thousand acres  of primeval forest about this village, and so through the years of a  free boyhood the young Cooper came to love the wilderness and to know  the characters of border life. When the village school was no longer  adequate, he went to study privately in Albany and later entered Yale  College. But he was not interested in the study of books. When, as a  junior, he was expelled from college, he turned to a career in the navy.  Accordingly in the fall of 1806 he sailed on a merchant ship, the  _Sterling_, and for the next eleven months saw hard service before the  mast. Soon after this apprenticeship he received a commission as a  midshipman in the United States navy. Although it was a time of peace,  and he saw no actual fighting, he gained considerable knowledge from his  service on Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain that he put to good use  later. Shortly before his resignation in May, 1811, he had married, and  for several years thereafter he lived along in a pleasant, leisurely  fashion, part of the time in Cooperstown and part of the time in  Westchester County, until almost accidentally he broke into the writing  of his first novel. Aside from the publication of his books, Cooper's  later life was essentially uneventful. He died at Cooperstown, on  September 14, 1851.    The connection of Cooper's best writing with the life he knew at first  hand is thus perfectly plain. In his novels dealing with the wilderness,  popularly known as the Leatherstocking Tales, he drew directly on his  knowledge of the backwoods and backwoodsmen as he gained it about  Cooperstown. In _The Pioneers_ (1823) he dealt with the scenes of his  boyhood, scenes which lay very close to his heart; and in the other  volumes of this series, _The Last of the Mohicans_ (1826), _The Prairie_  (1827), _The Pathfinder_ (1840), and _The Deerslayer (1841), he  continued to write of the trappers and frontiersmen and outpost  garrisons and Indians who made up the forest life he knew so well.  Similarly, in the sea tales, which began with 'The Pilot'(1823) and  included 'The Red Rover'(1828), 'The Two Admirals' (1842) and 'The  Wing-and-Wing'(1842), he made full use of his experiences before the  mast and in the navy. The nautical accuracy of these tales of the sea  could scarcely have been attained by a \"landlubber\". It has much  practical significance, then, that Cooper chose material which he knew  intimately and which gripped his own interest. His success came like  Thackeray's and Stevenson's and Mark Twain's--without his having to  reach to the other side of the world after his material.    In considering Cooper's work as a novelist, nothing is more marked than  his originality. In these days we take novels based on American history  and novels of the sea for granted, but at the time when Cooper published  'The Spy' and 'The Pilot' neither an American novel nor a salt-water  novel had ever been written. So far as Americans before Cooper had  written fiction at all, Washington Irving had been the only one to cease  from a timid imitation of British models. But Irving's material was  local, rather than national. It was Cooper who first told the story of  the conquest of the American continent. He caught the poetry and the  romantic thrill of both the American forest and the sea; he dared to  break away from literary conventions. His reward was an immediate and  widespread success, together with a secure place in the history of his  country's literature.    There was probably a two-fold reason for the success which Cooper's  novels won at home and abroad. In the first place, Cooper could invent a  good story and tell it well. He was a master of rapid, stirring  narrative, and his tales were elemental, not deep or subtle. Secondly,  he created interesting characters who had the restless energy, the  passion for adventure, the rugged confidence, of our American pioneers.  First among these great characters came Harvey Birch in 'The Spy', but  Cooper's real triumph was Natty Bumppo, who appears in all five of the  Leatherstocking Tales. This skilled trapper, faithful guide, brave  fighter, and homely philosopher was \"the first real American in  fiction,\" an important contribution to the world's literature. In  addition, Cooper created the Indian of literature--perhaps a little too  noble to be entirely true to life--and various simple, strong seamen.  His Chingachgook and Uncas and Long Tom Coffin justly brought him added  fame. In these narrative gifts, as well as in the robustness of his own  character, Cooper was not unlike Sir Walter Scott. He once modestly  referred to himself as \"a chip from Scott's block\" and has frequently  been called \"the American Scott.\"    But, of course, Cooper had limitations and faults. When he stepped  outside the definite boundaries of the life he knew, he was unable to  handle character effectively. His women are practically failures, and  like his military officers essentially interchangeable. His humor is  almost invariably labored and tedious. He occasionally allowed long  passages of description or long speeches by some minor character to clog  the progress of his action. Now and then, in inventing his plots, he  strained his readers' credulity somewhat. Finally, as a result of his  rapid writing, his work is uneven and without style in the sense that a  careful craftsman or a sensitive artist achieves it. He is even guilty  of an occasional error in grammar or word use which the young pupil in  the schools can detect. Yet his literary powers easily outweigh all  these weaknesses. He is unquestionably one of America's great novelists  and one of the world's great romancers.    There is abundant reason, therefore, why Americans of the present day  should know James Fenimore Cooper. He has many a good story of the  wilderness and the sea to tell to those who enjoy tales of adventure. He  gives a vivid, but faithful picture of American frontier life for those  who can know its stirring events and its hardy characters only at second  hand. He holds a peculiarly important place in the history of American  literature, and has done much to extend the reputation of American  fiction among foreigners.          AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION    The author has often been asked if there were any foundation in real  life for the delineation of the principal character in this book. He can  give no clearer answer to the question than by laying before his readers  a simple statement of the facts connected with its original publication.    Many years since, the writer of this volume was at the residence of an  illustrious man, who had been employed in various situations of high  trust during the darkest days of the American Revolution. The discourse  turned upon the effects which great political excitement produces on  character, and the purifying consequences of a love of country, when  that sentiment is powerfully and generally awakened in a people. He who,  from his years, his services, and his knowledge of men, was best  qualified to take the lead in such a conversation, was the principal  speaker. After dwelling on the marked manner in which the great struggle  of the nation, during the war of 1775, had given a new and honorable  direction to the thoughts and practices of"]]]
