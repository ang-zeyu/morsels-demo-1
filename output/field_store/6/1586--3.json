On the other hand, Mr. Clare, though gentle and benevolent in  his remonstrances to a degree that made the taking offence impossible,  was by no means parsimonious of praise, or slow to make use of the  deference that was paid him, for the purpose of procuring justice to  merit.    It happened at one of those public meetings at which Mr. Falkland and  Mr. Tyrrel were present, that the conversation, in one of the most  numerous sets into which the company was broken, turned upon the  poetical talents of the former. A lady, who was present, and was  distinguished for the acuteness of her understanding, said, she had been  favoured with a sight of a poem he had just written, entitled _An Ode to  the Genius of Chivalry_, which appeared to her of exquisite merit. The  curiosity of the company was immediately excited, and the lady added,  she had a copy in her pocket, which was much at their service, provided  its being thus produced would not be disagreeable to the author. The  whole circle immediately entreated Mr. Falkland to comply with their  wishes, and Mr. Clare, who was one of the company, enforced their  petition. Nothing gave this gentleman so much pleasure as to have an  opportunity of witnessing and doing justice to the exhibition of  intellectual excellence. Mr. Falkland had no false modesty or  affectation, and therefore readily yielded his consent.    Mr. Tyrrel accidentally sat at the extremity of this circle. It cannot  be supposed that the turn the conversation had taken was by any means  agreeable to him. He appeared to wish to withdraw himself, but there  seemed to be some unknown power that, as it were by enchantment,  retained him in his place, and made him consent to drink to the dregs  the bitter potion which envy had prepared for him.    The poem was read to the rest of the company by Mr. Clare, whose  elocution was scarcely inferior to his other accomplishments.  Simplicity, discrimination, and energy constantly attended him in the  act of reading, and it is not easy to conceive a more refined delight  than fell to the lot of those who had the good fortune to be his  auditors. The beauties of Mr. Falkland's poem were accordingly exhibited  with every advantage. The successive passions of the author were  communicated to the hearer. What was impetuous, and what was solemn,  were delivered with a responsive feeling, and a flowing and unlaboured  tone. The pictures conjured up by the creative fancy of the poet were  placed full to view, at one time overwhelming the soul with  superstitious awe, and at another transporting it with luxuriant beauty.    The character of the hearers upon this occasion has already been  described. They were, for the most part, plain, unlettered, and of  little refinement. Poetry in general they read, when read at all, from  the mere force of imitation, and with few sensations of pleasure; but  this poem had a peculiar vein of glowing inspiration. This very poem  would probably have been seen by many of them with little effect; but  the accents of Mr. Clare carried it home to the heart. He ended: and, as  the countenances of his auditors had before sympathised with the  passions of the composition, so now they emulated each other in  declaring their approbation. Their sensations were of a sort to which  they were little accustomed. One spoke, and another followed by a sort  of uncontrollable impulse; and the rude and broken manner of their  commendations rendered them the more singular and remarkable. But what  was least to be endured was the behaviour of Mr. Clare. He returned the  manuscript to the lady from whom he had received it, and then,  addressing Mr. Falkland, said with emphasis and animation, \"Ha! this is  as it should be. It is of the right stamp. I have seen too many hard  essays strained from the labour of a pedant, and pastoral ditties  distressed in lack of a meaning. They are such as you sir, that we want.  Do not forget, however, that the Muse was not given to add refinements  to idleness, but for the highest and most invaluable purposes. Act up to  the magnitude of your destiny.\"    A moment after, Mr. Clare quitted his seat, and with Mr. Falkland and  two or three more withdrew. As soon as they were gone, Mr. Tyrrel edged  further into the circle. He had sat silent so long that he seemed ready  to burst with gall and indignation. \"Mighty pretty verses!\" said he,  half talking to himself, and not addressing any particular person: \"why,  ay, the verses are well enough. Damnation! I should like to know what a  ship-load of such stuff is good for.\"    \"Why, surely,\" said the lady who had introduced Mr. Falkland's Ode on  the present occasion, \"you must allow that poetry is an agreeable and  elegant amusement.\"    \"Elegant, quotha!--Why, look at this Falkland! A puny bit of a thing! In  the devil's name, madam, do you think he would write poetry if he could  do any thing better?\"    The conversation did not stop here. The lady expostulated. Several other  persons, fresh from the sensation they had felt, contributed their  share. Mr. Tyrrel grew more violent in his invectives, and found ease in  uttering them. The persons who were able in any degree to check his  vehemence were withdrawn. One speaker after another shrunk back into  silence, too timid to oppose, or too indolent to contend with, the  fierceness of his passion. He found the appearance of his old  ascendancy; but he felt its deceitfulness and uncertainty, and was  gloomily dissatisfied.    In his return from this assembly he was accompanied by a young man,  whom similitude of manners had rendered one of his principal confidents,  and whose road home was in part the same as his own. One might have  thought that Mr. Tyrrel had sufficiently vented his spleen in the  dialogue he had just been holding. But he was unable to dismiss from his  recollection the anguish he had endured. \"Damn Falkland!\" said he. \"What  a pitiful scoundrel is here to make all this bustle about! But women and  fools always will be fools; there is no help for that! Those that set  them on have most to answer for; and most of all, Mr. Clare. He is a man  that ought to know something of the world, and past being duped by  gewgaws and tinsel. He seemed, too, to have some notion of things: I  should not have suspected him of hallooing to a cry of mongrels without  honesty or reason. But the world is all alike. Those that seem better  than their neighbours, are only more artful. They mean the same thing,  though they take a different road. He deceived me for a while, but it is  all out now. They are the makers of the mischief. Fools might blunder,  but they would not persist, if people that ought to set them right did  not encourage them to go wrong.\"    A few days after this adventure Mr. Tyrrel was surprised to receive a  visit from Mr. Falkland. Mr. Falkland proceeded, without ceremony, to  explain the motive of his coming.    \"Mr. Tyrrel,\" said he, \"I am come to have an amicable explanation with  you.\"    \"Explanation! What is my offence?\"    \"None in the world, sir; and for that reason I conceive this the fittest  time to come to a right understanding.\"    \"You are in a devil of a hurry, sir. Are you clear that this haste will  not mar, instead of make an understanding?\"    \"I think I am, sir. I have great faith in the purity of my intentions,  and I will not doubt, when you perceive the view with which I come, that  you will willingly co-operate with it.\"    \"Mayhap, Mr. Falkland, we may not agree about that. One man thinks one  way, and another man thinks another. Mayhap I do not think I have any  great reason to be pleased with you already.\"    \"It may be so. I cannot, however, charge myself with having given you  reason to be displeased.\"    \"Well, sir, you have no right to put me out of humour with myself. If  you come to play upon me, and try what sort of a fellow you shall have  to deal with, damn me if you shall have any reason to hug yourself upon  the experiment.\"    \"Nothing, sir, is more easy for us than to quarrel. If you desire that,  there is no fear that you will find opportunities.\"    \"Damn me, sir, if I do not believe you are come to bully me.\"    \"Mr. Tyrrel! sir--have a care!\"    \"Of what, sir!--Do you threaten me? Damn my soul! who are you? what do  you come here for?\"    The fieriness of Mr. Tyrrel brought Mr. Falkland to his recollection.    \"I am wrong,\" said he. \"I confess it. I came for purposes of peace. With  that view I have taken the liberty to visit you. Whatever therefore  might be my feelings upon another occasion, I am bound to suppress them  now.\"    \"Ho!--Well, sir: and what have you further to offer?\"    \"Mr. Tyrrel,\" proceeded Mr. Falkland, \"you will readily imagine that  the cause that brought me was not a slight one. I would not have  troubled you with a visit, but for important reasons. My coming is a  pledge how deeply I am myself impressed with what I have to communicate.    \"We are in a critical situation. We are upon the brink of a whirlpool  which, if once it get hold of us, will render all further deliberation  impotent. An unfortunate jealousy seems to have insinuated itself  between us, which I would willingly remove; and I come to ask your  assistance. We are both of us nice of temper; we are both apt to kindle,  and warm of resentment. Precaution in this stage can be dishonourable to  neither; the time may come when we shall wish we had employed it, and  find it too late. Why should we be enemies? Our tastes are different;  our pursuits need not interfere. We both of us amply possess the means  of happiness; We may be respected by all, and spend a long life of  tranquillity and enjoyment. Will it be wise in us to exchange this  prospect for the fruits of strife? A strife between persons with our  peculiarities and our weaknesses, includes consequences that I shudder  to think of.

Professors Ayrton and Perry  have recently used a modification of this dynamometer, in which the part  of the cord nearest to P is larger and rougher than the part nearest to  Q. The effect of this is that when the coefficients of friction  increase, Q rises a little, and diminishes the amount of the rougher  cord in contact, and _vice versa_. Thus reducing the friction,  notwithstanding the increase of the coefficient. This is very ingenious,  and the only objection to it, if it is an objection, is that only a  purely empirical adjustment of the friction can be obtained, and that  the range of the adjustment cannot be very great. If in place of one of  the weights we use a spring balance, as in Figs. 2 and 3, we get a  dynamometer which automatically adjusts itself to changes in the  coefficient of friction.    [Illustration: FIG.2 FIG.3]    For any increase in the coefficient, the spring in Fig. 2 lengthens, Q  increases, and the frictional resistance on the surface of the pulley  increases, both in consequence of the increase of Q, which increases the  pressure on the pulley, and of the increase of the coefficient of  friction. Similarly for any increase of the coefficient of friction, the  spring in Fig. 3 shortens, P diminishes, and the friction on the surface  of the pulley diminishes so far as the diminution of P diminishes the  normal pressure, but on the whole increases in consequence of the  increase of the coefficient of friction. The value of the friction on  the surface of the pulley, however, is more constant for a given  variation of the frictional coefficient in Fig. 3 than in Fig. 2, and  the variation of the difference of tensions to be measured is less. Fig.  3, therefore, is the better form.    A numerical calculation here may be useful. Supposing the break set to a  given difference of tension, Q-P, and that in consequence of any cause  the coefficient of friction increases 20 per cent., the difference of  tensions for an ordinary value of the coefficient of friction would  increase from 1.5 P to 2 P in Fig. 2, and from 1.5 P to 1.67 P in Fig.  3. That is, the vibration of the spring, and the possible error of  measurement of the difference of tension would be much greater in Fig. 2  than in Fig. 3. It has recently occurred to the author that a further  change in the dynamometer would make the friction on the pulley still  more independent of changes in the coefficient of friction, and  consequently the measurement of the work absorbed still more accurate.  Suppose the cord taken twice over a pulley fixed on the shaft driven by  the motor and round a fixed pulley, C.    For clearness, the pulleys, A B, are shown of different sizes, but they  are more conveniently of the same size. Further, let the spring balance  be at the free end of the cord toward which the pulley runs. Then it  will be found that a variation of 20 per cent. in the friction produces  a somewhat greater variation of P than in Fig. 3. But P is now so much  smaller than before that Q-P is much less affected by any error in the  estimate of P. An alteration of 20 per cent. in the friction will only  alter the quantity Q-P from 5.25 P to 5.55 P, or an alteration of less  than 6 per cent.    [Illustration: FIG. 4]    To put it in another way, the errors in the use of dynamometer are due  to the vibration of the spring which measures P, and are caused by  variations of the coefficient of friction of the dynamometer. By making  P very much smaller than in the usual form of the dynamometer, any  errors in determining it have much less influence on the measurement of  the work absorbed. We may go further. The cord may be taken over four  pulleys; in that case a variation of 20 per cent. in the frictional  coefficient only alters the total friction on the pulleys 11/4 percent. P  is now so insignificant compared with Q that an error in determining it  is of comparatively little consequence.    [Illustration: FIG. 5]    The dynamometer is now more powerful in absorbing work than in the form  Fig. 3. As to the practical construction of the brake, the author thinks  that simple wires for the flexible bands, lying in V grooves in the  pulleys, of no great acuteness, would give the greatest resistance with  the least variation of the coefficient of friction; the heat developed  being in that case neutralized by a jet of water on the pulley. It would  be quite possible with a pulley of say 3 feet diameter, and running at  50 feet of surface velocity per second, to have a sufficiently flexible  wire, capable of carrying 100 lb. as the greater load, Q. Now with these  proportions a brake of the form in Fig. 3 would, with a probable value  of the coefficient of friction, absorb 6 horse power. With a brake in  the form Fig. 4, 8.2 horse power would be absorbed; and with a brake in  the form Fig. 5, 8.8 horse power would be absorbed. But since it would  be easy to have two, three, or more wires side by side, each carrying  its load of 100 lb., large amounts of horsepower could be conveniently  absorbed and measured.           *       *       *       *       *          SEE'S GAS STOVE.      This stove consists of two or more superposed pipes provided with  radiators. A gas burner is placed at the entrance of either the upper or  lower pipe, according to circumstances. The products of combustion are  discharged through a pipe of small diameter, which may be readily  inserted into an already existing chimney or be hidden behind the  wainscoting. The heat furnished by the gas flame is so well absorbed by  radiation from the radiator rings that the gases, on making their exit,  have no longer a temperature of more than from 35 to 40 degrees.    [Illustration: SEE'S GAS STOVE.]    The apparatus, which is simple, compact, and cheap, is surrounded on all  sides with an ornamented sheet iron casing. Being entirely of cast iron,  it will last for a long time. The joints, being of asbestos, are  absolutely tight, so as to prevent the escape of bad odors. The water  due to the condensation of the gases is led through a small pipe out of  doors or into a vessel from whence it may evaporate anew, so as not to  change the hygrometric state of the air. The consumption of gas is very  small, it taking but 250 liters per hour to heat a room of 80 cubic  meters to a temperature of 18 deg.

Some time ago, Mr. Laurent Naudin, it will be remembered,[1] devised a  method of converting the aldehydes that give a bad taste and odor to  impure spirits, into alcohol, through electrolytic hydrogen, the  apparatus first employed being a zinc-copper couple, and afterward  electrolyzers with platinum plates.    [Footnote 1: See SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT of July 29, 1882, p.  5472.]    His apparatus had been in operation for several months, in the  distillery of Mr. Boulet, at Bapeaume-les-Rouen, when a fire in  December, 1881, completely destroyed that establishment. In  reconstructing his apparatus, Mr. Naudin has availed himself of the  experience already acquired, and has necessarily had to introduce  important modifications and simplifications into the process. In the  zinc-copper couple, he had in the very first place proposed to employ  zinc in the form of clippings; but the metal in this state presents  grave inconveniences, since the subsidence of the lower part, under the  influence of the zinc's weight, soon proves an obstacle to the free  circulation of the liquids, and, besides this, the cleaning presents  insurmountable difficulties. This is why he substituted for the  clippings zinc in straight and corrugated plates such as may be easily  found in commerce. The management and cleaning of the pile thus became  very simple.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--APPARATUS FOR HYDROGENIZING IMPURE SPIRITS.]    The apparatus that contains the zinc-copper couple now has the form  shown in Fig. 1. It may be cylindrical, as here represented, or, what is  better, rectangular, because of the square form under which the sheets  of zinc are found in commerce.    In this vessel of wood or iron plate, P, the corrugated zinc plates, b,  b', b\", are placed one above the other, each alternating with a flat  one, a, a', a\". These plates have previously been scoured, first with a  weak solution of caustic soda in order to remove every trace of fatty  matter derived from rolling, and then with very dilute hydrochloric  acid, and finally are washed with common water. In order to facilitate  the disengagement of hydrogen during the reaction, care must be taken to  form apertures in the zinc plates, and to incline the first lower row  with respect to the bottom of the vessel. A cubical pile of 150  hectoliters contains 105 rows of No. 16 flat and corrugated zinc plates,  whose total weight is 6,200 kilogrammes. We obtain thus a hydrogenizing  surface of 1,800 square meters, or 12 square meters per hectoliter of  impure spirits of 50 deg. to 60 deg. Gay-Lussac. The raw impure spirits enter  the apparatus through the upper pipe, E, and, after a sufficient stay  therein, are drawn off through the lower pipe, H, into a reservoir, R,  from whence, by means of a pump, they"]]]
