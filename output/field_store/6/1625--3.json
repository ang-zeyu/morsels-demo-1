ALEXANDER II., emperor of Russia, son and successor of Nicholas I.,  fell heir to the throne while the siege of Sebastopol was going on; on  the conclusion of a peace applied himself to reforms in the state and the  consolidation and extension of the empire. His reign is distinguished by  a ukase decreeing in 1861 the emancipation of the serfs numbering 23  millions, by the extension of the empire in the Caucasus and Central  Asia, and by the war with Turkey in the interest of the Slavs in 1877-78,  which was ended by the peace of San Stephano, revised by the treaty of  Berlin. His later years were clouded with great anxiety, owing to the  spread of Nihilism, and he was killed by a bomb thrown at him by a  Nihilist (1818-1881).      ALEXANDER III., emperor of Russia, son of the preceding, followed in  the footsteps of his father, and showed a marked disposition to live on  terms of peace with the other Powers; his reign not distinguished by any  very remarkable event. The present Czar is his son and successor  (1845-1894).      ALEXANDER I., king of Servia, _b_. 1876.

ALEXAN`DRIA (230), a world-famous city, the chief port of Egypt,  founded by Alexander the Great in 332 B.C., at one time a great centre  of learning, and in possession of the largest library of antique  literature in the world, which was burned by the Caliph Omar in 640; at  one time a place of great commerce, but that has very materially decayed  since the opening of the Suez Canal. Alexandria, from its intimate  connection with both East and West, gave birth in early times to a  speculative philosophy which drew its principles from eastern as well as  western sources, which was at its height on the first encounter of these  elements.      ALEXANDRIA (14), a town on the Potomac, 7 m. S. of Washington,  accessible to vessels of the largest size; also a thriving town (7) on  the river Leven, 3 m. N. of Dumbarton.

ALEXIS PETROVITCH, son of Peter the Great, conspired against his  father as he had broken the heart of his mother, was condemned to death;  after his trial by secret judges he was found dead in prison (1695-1718).      ALEXIUS COMNE`NUS, emperor of the East, began life as a soldier, was  a great favourite with the soldiers, who, in a period of anarchy, raised  him to the throne at the period of the first crusade, when the empire was  infested by Turks on the one hand and Normans on the other, while the  crusaders who passed through his territory proved more troublesome than  either. He managed to hold the empire together in spite of these  troubles, and to stave off the doom that impended all through his reign  of thirty-seven years (1048-1118).      ALFA, an esparto grass valuable for making paper.      AL`FADUR, the All-Father or uncreated supreme in the Norse  mythology.      ALFARA`BI, an Arabian philosopher of the 10th century, had Avicenna  for a disciple, wrote on various subjects, and was the first to attempt  an encyclopedic work.      ALFIE`RI, an Italian dramatist, spent his youth in dissipation  before he devoted himself to the dramatic art; on the success of his  first drama \"Cleopatra,\" met at Florence with the Countess of Albany, the  wife of Charles Edward Stuart, on whose death he married her; was at  Paris when the Revolution broke out, and returned to Florence, where he  died and was buried. Tragedy was his _forte_ as a dramatist (1749-1803).      ALFONSINE TABLES, astronomical tables drawn up at Toledo by order of  Alfonso X. in 1252 to correct the anomalies in the Ptolemaic tables; they  divided the year into 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, 16 seconds.      ALFONSO I., the \"Conqueror,\" founder of the kingdom of Portugal, was  the first king, originally only count, as his father before him; in that  capacity took up arms against the Moors, and defeating them had himself  proclaimed king on the field of battle, a title confirmed to him by the  Pope and made good by his practically subjecting all Portugal to his sway  (1110-1185).      ALFONSO X., the Wise, or the Astronomer, king of Castile and Leon,  celebrated as an astronomer and a philosopher; after various successes  over the Moors, first one son and then another rose against him and drove  him from the throne; died of chagrin at Seville two years later. His fame  connects itself with the preparation of the Alfonsine Tables, and the  remark that \"the universe seemed a crank machine, and it was a pity the  Creator had not taken advice.\" It was a saying of his, \"old wood to burn,  old books to read, old wine to drink, and old friends to converse with\"  (1226-1284).      ALFONSO III., surnamed the Great, king of Asturias, ascended the  throne in 866, fought against and gained numerous victories over the  Moors; the members of his family rose against him and compelled him to  abdicate, but on a fresh incursion of the Moors he came forth from his  retreat and triumphantly beat them back; died in Zamora, 910.      ALFORD, HENRY, vicar of Wymeswold and afterwards Dean of Canterbury;  his works and writings were numerous, and included poems and hymns.

ALFORD, MICHAEL, a learned English Jesuit, left two great works,  \"Britannia Illustrata\" and \"Annales Ecclesiastici et Civiles  Britannorum.\"      ALFRED, DUKE OF SAXE-COBURG AND GOTHA, son of Prince Albert and  Queen Victoria; _b_. 1844.      ALFRED THE GREAT, king of the West Saxons, and the most celebrated  and greatest of all the Saxon kings. His troubles were with the Danes,  who at the time of his accession infested the whole country north of the  Thames; with these he fought nine battles with varied success, till after  a lull of some years he was surprised by Gunthrum, then king, in 878, and  driven to seek refuge on the island of Athelney. Not long after this he  left his retreat and engaged Gunthrum at Edington, and after defeating  him formed a treaty with him, which he never showed any disposition to  break. After this Alfred devoted himself to legislation, the  administration of government, and the encouragement of learning, being a  man of letters himself. England owes much to him both as a man and a  ruler, and it was he who in the creation of a fleet laid the first  foundation of her greatness as monarch of the deep. His literary works  were translations of the \"General History\" of Orosius, the  \"Ecclesiastical History\" of Bede, Boethius's \"Consolations of  Philosophy,\" and the \"Cura Pastoralis\" of Pope Gregory, all executed for  the edification of his subjects (849-901).

ALGARO`TTI, FRANCESCO, a clever Italian author, born at Venice,  whom, for his wit, Frederick the Great was attached to and patronised,  \"one of the first _beaux esprits_ of the age,\" according to Wilhelmina,  Frederick's sister. Except his wit, it does not appear Frederick got much  good out of him, for the want of the due practical faculty, all the  faculty he had having evaporated in talk (1712-1764).      ALGAR`VE (240), the southernmost province of Portugal, hilly, but  traversed with rich valleys, which yield olives, vines, oranges, &c.      ALGEBRA, a universal arithmetic of Arabian origin or Arabian  transmission, in which symbols are employed to denote operations, and  letters to represent number and quantity.

Boil two eggs, and while they are boiling, blanch about a dozen or  more almonds and stick them into the fish, points up; cover the eggs  with cold water, peel them, separate the whites from the yolks, chop  each separately; garnish the fish, first with a row of chopped yolks,  then whites, until all is used: lay chopped parsley all around the  platter.    Fresh cod and striped bass may be cooked in this way.      FISH PIQUANT    Cook any large fish in salt water--salmon is particularly nice prepared  in this style--add one cup of vinegar, onions, celery root and parsley.  When the fish is cooked enough, remove it from the fire, kettle and  all--letting the fish remain in its sauce until the following sauce is  prepared:--    Take the yolks of two eggs, one-half teaspoon of Colman's mustard (dry),  salt, pepper, a tablespoon of butter, a tablespoon of vinegar, one-half  glass water and some fish gravy. Boil in double boiler until thick. Take  some parsley, green onions, capers, shallots and one large vinegar  pickle and some astragon, chop all up very fine; chop up the hard-boiled  whites separately and then add the sauce; mix all this together  thoroughly, then taste to see if seasoned to suit.      SALMON CUTLETS    Take the remains of some boiled salmon or a small can of salmon, three  tablespoons of mashed potatoes, one of bread crumbs, one of chopped  parsley, a little flour, mace, an egg, pepper and salt.    Mix the ingredients well together, bind with the egg, let stand an hour,  then form into little flat cutlets, roll in bread crumbs and fry in hot  oil, drain on paper and send to table garnished with parsley.      PAPRIKA CARP    Slice and salt three pounds of carp. Steam four sliced onions with one  cup of water, to which has been added one teaspoon of paprika, add the  sliced carp and cook very slowly until the fish is done.      REDSNAPPER WITH TOMATO SAUCE    Scale thoroughly, salt and pepper inside and out, and lay upon ice,  wrapped in a clean cloth overnight. When ready to cook cut up the celery  or parsley root, or both, two large onions, a carrot or two, and let  this come to a boil in about one quart of water, then lay in the fish,  whole or in pieces; let the water almost cover the fish; add a lump of  fresh butter and three or four tomatoes (out of season you may use  canned tomatoes, say three or four large spoonfuls); let the fish boil  half an hour, turning it occasionally. Try it by taking hold of the  fins, if they come out readily, the fish is done. Take it up carefully;  lay on a large platter and strain the sauce; let it boil, thicken it  with the well-beaten yolks of two eggs, adding the sauce gradually to  the eggs and stirring constantly. Garnish the fish with chopped parsley,  letting a quantity mix with the sauce.    Redsnapper is also very good fried.      BONED SMELTS, SAUTED    Take a dozen raw smelts; split them from the back lengthwise, leaving  the head and tail intact; take out the large center bone without opening  the stomach and season with salt. Put four ounces of butter into a  saucepan, and when quite hot place the smelts in it, so that the side  which was cut open is underneath. When they have attained a nice color,  turn them over and finish cooking. When ready, arrange them on a very  hot dish, pour the butter in which they were cooked over them, squeeze a  little lemon on them, then add over all some finely chopped green  parsley. Serve.      FISH WITH HORSERADISH SAUCE    Clean three pounds of fresh salmon, bone, salt and let stand several  hours. Place in fish kettle with boiling salt water (one teaspoon of  salt to one quart of water), and let boil one-half hour or until well  cooked. Lift out carefully, place on hot platter and pour over  one-fourth cup of melted butter and sprinkle well with one tablespoon of  parsley. Serve in a separate bowl the following sauce; a large spoonful  with each portion of fish: Peel one-half pound of horseradish root,  grate and mix well with one pint of cream beaten stiff. The fish must  be hot and the sauce cold.      FISH WITH SAUERKRAUT    Fry an onion in butter (or vegetable oil), add sauerkraut and cook. Boil  the fish in salt water, then bone and shred.

Cover them with  acidulated warm water--a slice of lemon in the water is all that is  wanted, and add a slice of onion, a sprig of parsley and a bit of bay  leaf. Simmer for ten minutes and drain. Put the minced spinach into the  bottom of the buttered baking-dish, arrange the fillets on it, cover  with a cream sauce to which a tablespoon of grated cheese has been  added, and brown in the oven.

Let this sauce simmer for a  couple of hours (this need not be strained); put the fillets in a  casserole, and pour some of this sauce over them, and put in the oven  for about fifteen minutes. Then pour over the rest of the tomato sauce,  sprinkle a little chopped parsley and serve. One can add a few mushrooms  to the sauce. The mushrooms must be fried in butter before being added  to the sauce.      BAKED BLACK BASS    After having carefully cleaned, salt well and lay it in the baking-pan  with a small cup of water, and strew flakes of butter on top, also salt,  pepper and a little chopped parsley.
