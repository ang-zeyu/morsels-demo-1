He was allowed the best ropers and a number of shotguns, to  be stationed at the cattle trails leading down to the water at the  river's bend. The remainder, about two hundred and fifty men under  Lynch, formed a long scattering line from the left entrance of the  horseshoe, extending back until it met the advancing line of Reese's  pickets.    With the river on one side and this cordon of foot and horsemen on the  other, it seemed that nothing could possibly escape. The location of  the quarry was almost assured. This chaparral had been the breeding  refuge of wolves ever since the Cimarron was a cattle country.  Every rider on that range for the past ten years knew it to be the  rendezvous of El Lobo, while the ravages of his nightly raids were in  evidence for forty miles in every direction. It was a common sight,  early in the morning during the winter months, to see twenty and  upward in a band, leisurely returning to their retreat, logy and  insolent after a night's raid. To make doubly sure that they would be  at home to callers, the promoters of this drive gathered a number of  worthless lump-jawed cattle two days in advance, and driving them to  the edge of the grove, shot one occasionally along its borders, thus,  to be hoped, spreading the last feast of the wolves.           *       *       *       *       *    By half past ten, Encampment Butte was deserted with the exception of  a few old cowmen, two ladies, wife and sister of a popular cowman, and  the captain, who from this point of vantage surveyed the field with  a glass. Usually a languid and indifferent man, Miller had so set his  heart on making this drive a success that this morning he appeared  alert and aggressive as he rode forward and back across the plateau of  the Butte. The dull, heavy reports of several shotguns caused him to  wheel his horse and cover the beef ford with his glass, and a moment  later Edwards and his squad were seen with the naked eye to scale the  bank and strike up the river at a gallop. It was known that the ford  was saddle-skirt deep, and some few of the men were strangers to it;  but with that passed safely he felt easier, though his blood coursed  quicker. It lacked but a few minutes to eleven, and Cave and his  detachment of beaters were due to move on the stroke of the hour. They  had been given one hundred rounds of six-shooter ammunition to the  man and were expected to use it. Edwards and his cavalcade were  approaching the horseshoe, the cordon seemed perfect, though  scattering, when the first faint sound of the beaters was heard, and  the next moment the barking of two hundred six-shooters was reechoing  up and down the valley of the Salt Fork.    The drive-hunt was on; the long yell passed from the upper end of  the grove to the mouth of the horseshoe and back, punctuated with an  occasional shot by irrepressibles. The mounts of the day were the pick  of over five thousand cow-horses, and corn-fed for winter use, in  the pink of condition and as impatient for the coming fray as their  riders.    Everything was moving like clockwork. Miller forsook the Butte and  rode to the upper end of the grove; the beaters were making slow but  steady progress, while the saddled loose horses would be at hand for  their riders without any loss of time. Before the beaters were one  third over the ground, a buck and doe came out about halfway down the  grove, sighted the horsemen, and turned back for shelter. Once more  the long yell went down the line. Game had been sighted. When about  one half the grove had been beat, a flock of wild turkeys came out at  the lower end, and taking flight, sailed over the line. Pandemonium  broke out. Good resolutions of an hour's existence were converted into  paving material in the excitement of the moment, as every carbine or  six-shooter in or out of range rained its leaden hail at the flying  covey. One fine bird was accidentally winged, and half a dozen men  broke from the line to run it down, one of whom was Reese himself.  The line was not dangerously broken nor did harm result, and on their  return Miller was present and addressed this query to Reese: \"Who is  the captain of this flank line?\"    \"He'll weigh twenty pounds,\" said Reese, ignoring the question and  holding the gobbler up for inspection.    \"If you were a vealy tow-headed kid, I'd have something to say to you,  but you're old enough to be my father, and that silences me. But  try and remember that this is a wolf hunt, and that there are enough  wolves in that brush this minute to kill ten thousand dollars' worth  of cattle this winter and spring, and some of them will be your own.  That turkey might eat a few grasshoppers, but you're cowman enough to  know that a wolf just loves to kill a cow while she's calving.\"    This lecture was interrupted by a long cheer coming up the line from  below, and Miller galloped away to ascertain its cause. He met Lynch  coming up, who reported that several wolves had been sighted, while at  the lower end of the line some of the boys had been trying their guns  up and down the river to see how far they would carry. What caused the  recent shouting was only a few fool cowboys spurting their horses  in short races. He further expressed the opinion that the line would  hold, and at the close with the cordon thickened, everything would be  forced into the pocket. Miller rode back down the line with him  until he met a man from his own camp, and the two changing horses, he  hurried back to oversee personally the mounting of the beaters when  the grove had been passed.    Reese, after the captain's reproof, turned his trophy over to some  of the men, and was bringing his line down and closing up with the  forward movement of the drive. On Miller's return, no fault could be  found, as the line was condensed to about a mile in length, while the  beaters on the points were just beginning to emerge from the chaparral  and anxious for their horses. Once clear of the grove, the beaters  halted, maintaining their line, while from either end the horse  wranglers were distributing to them their mounts. Again secure in  their saddles, the long yell circled through the plum thickets and  reechoed down the line, and the drive moved forward at a quicker  pace. \"If you have any doubts about hell,\" said Cave to Miller, as the  latter rode by, \"just take a little _pasear_ through that thicket once  and you'll come out a defender of the faith.\"    The buck and doe came out within sight of the line once more, lower  down opposite the sand dunes, and again turned back, and a half hour  later all ears were strained listening to the rapid shooting from the  farther bank of the river. Rebuffed in their several attempts to force  the line, they had taken to the water and were swimming the river.  From several sand dunes their landing on the opposite bank near the  ending of the salt plain could be distinctly seen. As they came out  of the river, half a dozen six-shooters were paying them a salute in  lead; but the excitability of the horses made aim uncertain, and they  rounded the cut-bank at the upper end and escaped.    While the deer were making their escape, a band of antelope were  sighted sunning themselves amongst the sand dunes a mile below;  attracted by the shooting, they were standing at attention. Now when  an antelope scents danger, he has an unreasonable and unexplainable  desire to reach high ground, where he can observe and be observed--at  a distance. Once this conclusion has been reached, he allows nothing  to stop him, not even recently built wire fences or man himself, and  like the cat despises water except for drinking purposes. So when  this band of antelope decided to adjourn their _siesta_ from the warm,  sunny slope of a sand dune, they made an effort and did break the  cordon, but not without a protest.    As they came out of the sand dunes, heading straight for the line,  all semblance of control was lost in the men. Nothing daunted by the  yelling that greeted the antelope, once they came within range fifty  men were shooting at them without bringing one to grass. With guns  empty they loosened their ropes and met them. A dozen men made casts,  and Juan Mesa, a Mexican from the Eagle Chief, lassoed a fine buck,  while \"Pard\" Sevenoaks, from the J+H, fastened to the smallest one  in the band. He was so disgusted with his catch that he dismounted,  ear-marked the kid, and let it go. Mesa had made his cast with so  large a loop that one fore leg of the antelope had gone through, and  it was struggling so desperately that he was compelled to tie the rope  in a hard knot to the pommel of his saddle. His horse was a wheeler on  the rope, so Juan dismounted to pet his buck. While he held on to the  rope assisting his horse, an Eagle Chief man slipped up and cut the  rope through the knot, and the next moment a Mexican was burning the  grass, calling on saints and others to come and help him turn the  antelope loose. When the rope had burned its way through his gloved  hands, he looked at them in astonishment, saying, \"That was one bravo  buck. How come thees rope untie?\" But there was none to explain,  and an antelope was dragging thirty-five feet of rope in a frantic  endeavor to overtake his band.    The line had been closing gradually until at this juncture it had  been condensed to about five miles, or a horseman to every fifty feet.  Wolves had been sighted numerous times running from covert to covert,  but few had shown themselves to the flank line, being contented with  such shelter as the scraggy plum brush afforded. Whenever the beaters  would rout or sight a wolf, the yelling would continue up and down the  line for several minutes. Cave and his well-formed circle of beaters  were making good time; Reese on the left flank was closing and  moving forward, while the line under Lynch was as impatient as it was  hilarious.

It came into the thoughts of the said John Graves  that the said John Harrison and Katherine his wife being rumored to be  suspicious of witchcraft, therefore he would graze his cattle on the  rowing of the land of goodman Harrison, thinking that if the said  Harrisons were witches then something would disturb the quiet feeding of  the cattle. He thereupon adventured and tied his oxen to his cart rope,  one to one end and the other to the other end, making the oxen surely  fast as he could, tieing 3 or 4 fast knots at each end, and tying his  yoke to the cartrope about the middle of the rope between the oxen; and  himself went about 10 or 12 pole distant, to see if the cattle would  quietly feed as in other places. The cattle stood staring and fed not,  and looking stedfastly on them he saw the cartrope of its own accord  untie and fall to the ground; thereupon he went and tied the rope more  fast and more knots in it and stood apart as before to see the issue.  In a little time the oxen as affrighted fell to running, and ran with  such violence that he judgeth that the force and speed of their running  made the yoke so tied fly above six foot high to his best discerning.

Then appeared an ugly shaped thing like a dog, having a  head such that I clearly and distinctly knew to be the head of Katherine  Harrison, who was lately imprisoned upon suspicion of witchcraft. Mary  saw it walk to & fro in the chamber and went to her father's bedside  then came back and disappeared. That day seven night next after, lying  in her bed something came upon her in like manner as is formerly  related, first on her legs & feet & then on her stomach, crushing &  oppressing her very sore. She put forth her hand to feel (because there  was no light in the room so as clearly to discern). Mary aforesaid felt  a face, which she judged to be a woman's face, presently then she had a  great blow on her fingers which pained her 2 days after, which she  complained of to her father & mother, & made her fingers black and blue.  During the former passages Mary called to her father & mother but could  not wake them till it was gone. After this, the day of December in the  night, (the night being very windy) something came again and spoke thus  to her, saying to Mary aforesaid, You said that I would not come again,  but are you not afraid of me. Mary said, No. The voice replied I will  make you afraid before I have done with you; and then presently Mary was  crushed & oppressed very much. Then Mary called often to her father and  mother, they lying very near. Then the voice said, Though you do call  they shall not hear till I am gone. Then the voice said, You said that I  preserved my cart to carry me to the gallows, but I will make it a dear  cart to you (which said words Mary remembered she had only spoke in  private to her sister a little before & to no other.) Mary replied she  feared her not, because God had kept her & would keep her still. The  voice said she had a commission to kill her. Mary asked, Who gave you  the commission? The voice replied God gave me the commission. Mary  replied, The Devil is a liar from the beginning for God will not give  commission to murder, therefore it must be from the devil. Then Mary was  again pressed very much. Then the voice said, You will make known these  things abroad when I am gone, but if you will promise me to keep these  aforesaid matters secret I will come no more to afflict you. Mary  replied I will tell it abroad. Whereas the said Mary mentions divers  times in this former writing that she heard a voice, this said Mary  affirmeth that she did & doth know that it was the voice of Katherine  Harrison aforesaid; and Mary aforesaid affirmeth that the substance of  the whole relation is truth.\" Sworn in Court May 25, 1669.
