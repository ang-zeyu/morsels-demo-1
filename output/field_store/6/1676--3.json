They ate rough brown  bread, vegetable and grain broth, ale from barley, bacon, beans,  milk, cabbage, onion, apples, plums, cherries, and honey for  sweetening or mead. Vegetables grown in the country included  onions, leeks, celery, lettuce, radish, carrots, garlic, shallots,  parsnip, dill, chervil, marigold, coriander, and poppy. In the  summer, they ate boiled or raw veal and wild fowl such as ducks,  geese, or pigeons, and game snared in the forest. Poultry was a  luxury food, but recognized as therapeutic for invalids,  especially in broth form [chicken soup]. Venison was highly  prized. There were still some wild boar, which were hunted with  long spears, a greyhound dog, and hunting horns. They sometimes  mated with the domestic pigs which roamed the woodlands. In  September, the old and infirm pigs were slaughtered and their  sides of bacon smoked in the rafters for about a month. Their  intestines provided skin for sausages. In the fall, cattle were  slaughtered and salted for food during the winter because there  was no more pasture for them. However, some cows and breed animals  were kept through the winter.    For their meals, people used wooden platters, sometimes  earthenware plates, drinking horns, drinking cups from ash or  alderwood turned on a foot-peddled pole lathe, and bottles made of  leather. Their bowls, pans, and pitchers were made by the potter's  wheel. Water could be boiled in pots made of iron, brass, lead, or  clay. Water could be carried in leather bags because leather  working preservative techniques improved so that tanning prevented  stretching or decaying. At the back of each hut was a hole in the  ground used as a latrine, which flies frequented. Moss was used  for toilet paper. Parasitical worms in the stool were ubiquitous.    Most of the simple people lived in villages of about 20 homes  circling a village green or lining a single winding lane. There  were only first names, and these were usually passed down family  lines. To grind their grain, the villagers used hand mills with  crank and gear, or a communal mill, usually built of oak, driven  by power transmitted through a solid oak shaft, banded with iron  as reinforcement, to internal gear wheels of elm. Almost every  village had a watermill. It might be run by water shooting over or  flowing under the wheel.    Clothing for men and women was made from coarse wool, silk, and  linen and was usually brown in color. Only the wealthy could  afford to wear linen or silk. Men also wore leather clothing, such  as neckpieces, breeches, ankle leathers, shoes, and boots. Boots  were worn when fighting. They carried knives or axes under metal  belts. They could carry items by tying leather pouches onto their  belts with their drawstrings. They wore leather gloves for warmth  and for heavy working with their hands.    People were as tall, strong and healthy as in the late 1900s, not  having yet endured the later malnourishment and overcrowding that  was its worst in the 1700s and 1800s. Their teeth were very  healthy. Most adults died in their 40s, after becoming arthritic  from hard labor. People in their 50s were deemed venerable. Boys  of twelve were considered old enough to swear an oath of  allegiance to the king. Girls married in their early teens, often  to men significantly older.    The lands of the large landholding lords were administered by  freemen. They had wheat, barley, oats, and rye fields, orchards,  vineyards for wine, and beekeeping areas for honey. On this land  lived not only farm laborers, cattle herders, shepherds,  goatherds, and pigherds, but craftsmen such as goldsmiths,  hawkkeepers, dogkeepers, horsekeepers, huntsmen, foresters,  builders, weaponsmiths, embroiders, bronze smiths, blacksmiths,  watermill wrights, wheelwrights, wagon wrights, iron nail makers,  potters, soap makers (made from wood ashes reacting chemically  with fats or oils), tailors, shoemakers, salters (made salt at  the \"wyches\", which later became towns ending with '-wich'),  bakers, cooks, and gardeners. Most men did carpentry work. Master  carpenters worked with ax, hammer, and saw to make houses, doors,  bridges, milk buckets, washtubs, and trunks. Blacksmiths made  gates, huge door hinges, locks, latches, bolts, and horseshoes.  The lord loaned these people land on which to live for their life,  called a \"life estate\", in return for their services. The loan  could continue to their widows or children who took up the craft.  Mills were usually powered by water. Candles were made from  beeswax, which exuded a bright and steady light and pleasant  smell, or from mutton fat, which had an unpleasant odor. The  wheeled plough and iron-bladed plough made the furrows. One man  held the plough and another walked with the oxen, coaxing them  forward with a stick and shouts. Seeds were held in an apron for  seeding. Farm implements included spades, shovels, rakes, hoes,  buckets, barrels, flails, and sieves. Plants were pruned to direct  their growth and to increase their yield. Everyone got together  for feasts at key stages of the farming, such as the harvest.  Easter was the biggest feast. When the lord was in the field, his  lady held their estate. There were common lands of these estates  as well as of communities. Any proposed new settler had to be  admitted at the court of this estate.    The land of some lords included fishing villages along the coasts.  >From the sea were caught herrings, salmon, porpoises, sturgeon,  oysters, crabs, mussels, cockles, winkles, plaice, flounder, and  lobsters. Sometimes whales were driven into an inlet by many  boats. River fish included eels, pike, minnows, burbot, trout, and  lampreys. They were caught by brushwood weirs, net, bait, hooks,  and baskets. Oysters were so numerous that they were eaten by the  poor. The king's peace extended over the waterways. If mills,  fisheries, weirs, or other structures were set up to block them,  they were to be destroyed and a penalty paid to the king.    Other lords had land with iron mining industries. Ore was dug from  the ground and combined with wood charcoal in a shaft furnace to  be smelted into liquid form. Wood charcoal was derived from  controlled charring of the wood at high temperatures without using  oxygen. This burned impurities from it and left a purer carbon,  which burned better than wood. The pure iron was extracted from  this liquid and formed into bars. To keep the fire hot, the  furnaces were frequently placed at windswept crossings of valleys  or on the tops of hills.    Some lords had markets on their land, for which they charged a  toll [like a sales tax] for participation. There were about  fifty markets in the nation. Cattle and slaves (from the word  \"slav\") were the usual medium of exchange. An ox still was worth  about 30d. Shaking hands was symbolic of an agreement for a  sale, which had to be carried out in front of witnesses at the  market for any property worth over 20d. The higher the value of  the property, the more witnesses were required. Witnesses were  also required for the exchange of property and to vouch for  cattle having being born on the property of a person claiming  them. People traveled to markets on deep, sunken roads and  narrow bridges kept in repair by certain men who did this work  as their service to the King. The king's peace extended to a  couple of high roads, i.e. highways, running the length of the  country and a couple running its width.    Salt was used throughout the nation to preserve meat over the  winter. Inland saltworks had an elaborate and specialized  organization. The chief one used saltpans and furnaces to extract  salt from natural brine springs. They formed little manufacturing  enclaves in the midst of agricultural land, and they were  considered to be neither large private estates headed by a lord  nor appurtenant to such. They belonged jointly to the king and the  local earl, who shared, at a proportion of two to one, the  proceeds of the tolls upon the sale of salt and methods of  carriage on the ancient salt ways according to cartload, horse  load, or man load. Sometimes there were investors in a portion of  the works who lived quite at distance away. The sales of salt were  mostly retail, but some bought to resell. Peddlers carried salt to  sell from village to village.    Some smiths traveled for their work, for instance, stonewrights  building arches and windows in churches, and lead workers putting  lead roofs on churches.    An example of a grant of hides of land is: \"[God has endowed King  Edred with England], wherefore he enriches and honors men, both  ecclesiastic and lay, who can justly deserve it. The truth of this  can be acknowledged by the thegn AElfsige Hunlafing through his  acquisition of the estate of 5 hides at Alwalton for himself and  his heirs, free from every burden except the repair of  fortifications, the building of bridges and military service; a  prudent landowner church dues, burial fees and tithes. [This land]  is to be held for all time and granted along with the things both  great and small belonging to it.\"    A Bishop gave land to a faithful attendant for his life and two  other lives as follows: \"In 904 A.D., I, Bishop Werfrith, with the  permission and leave of my honorable community in Worcester, grant  to Wulfsige, my reeve, for his loyal efficiency and humble  obedience, one hide of land at Aston as Herred held it, that is,  surrounded by a dyke, for three lives and then after three lives  the estate shall be given back without any controversy to  Worcester.\"    At seaports on the coast, goods were loaded onto vessels owned by  English merchants to be transported to other English seaports.  London was a market town on the north side of the Thames River and  the primary port and trading center for foreign merchants. Streets  that probably date from this time include Milk, Bread, and Wood  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13402"],[0,"The Hindu-Yogi Science of Breath (#10)"],[1,"l, and in  the same way he can direct an increased current of nerve force to any  part or organ, strengthening and stimulating it.    In the same way the Yogi by rhythmic breathing \"catches the swing,\" as  it were, and is able to absorb and control a greatly increased amount  of prana, which is then at the disposal of his will. He can and does  use it as a vehicle for sending forth thoughts to others and for  attracting to him all those whose thoughts are keyed in the same  vibration. The phenomena of telepathy, thought transference, mental  healing, mesmerism, etc., which subjects are creating such an interest  in the Western world at the present time, but which have been known to  the Yogis for centuries, can be greatly increased and augmented If the  person sending forth the thoughts will do so after rhythmic breathing.  Rhythmic breathing will increase the value of mental healing, magnetic  healing, etc., several hundred per cent.    In rhythmic breathing the main thing to be acquired is the mental idea  of rhythm. To those who know anything of music, the idea of measured  counting is familiar. To others, the rhythmic step of the soldier:  \"Left, right; left, right; left, right; one, two, three, four; one,  two, three, four,\" will convey the idea.    The Yogi bases his rhythmic time upon a unit corresponding with the  beat of his heart. The heart beat varies in different persons, but the  heart beat unit of each person is the proper rhythmic standard for  that particular individual in his rhythmic breathing. Ascertain your  normal heart beat by placing your fingers over your pulse, and then  count: \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\" etc., until the rhythm  becomes firmly fixed in your mind. A little practice will fix the  rhythm, so that you will be able to easily reproduce it. The beginner  usually inhales in about six pulse units, but he will be able to  greatly increase this by practice.    The Yogi rule for rhythmic breathing is that the units of inhalation  and exhalation should be the same, while the units for retention and  between breaths should be one-half the number of those of inhalation  and exhalation.    The following exercise in Rhythmic Breathing should be thoroughly  mastered, as it forms the basis of numerous other exercises, to which  reference will be made later.         (1) Sit erect, in an easy posture, being sure to hold the       chest, neck and head as nearly in a straight line as       possible, with shoulders slightly thrown back and hands       resting easily on the lap. In this position the weight of       the body is largely supported by the ribs and the position       may be easily maintained. The Yogi has found that one cannot       get the best effect of rhythmic breathing with the chest       drawn in and the abdomen protruding.         (2) Inhale slowly a Complete Breath, counting six pulse       units.         (3) Retain, counting three pulse units.         (4) Exhale slowly through the nostrils, counting six pulse       units.         (5) Count three pulse beats between breaths.         (6) Repeat a number of times, but avoid fatiguing yourself       at the start.         (7) When you are ready to close the exercise, practice the       cleansing breath, which will rest you and cleanse the lungs.    After a little practice you will be able to increase the duration of  the inhalations and exhalations, until about fifteen pulse units are  consumed. In this increase, remember that the units for retention and  between breaths is one-half the units for inhalation and exhalation.    Do not overdo yourself in your effort to increase the duration of the  breath, but pay as much attention as possible to acquiring the  \"rhythm,\" as that is more important than the length of the breath.  Practice and try until you get the measured \"swing\" of the movement,  and until you can almost \"feel\" the rhythm of the vibratory motion  throughout your whole body. It will require a little practice and  perseverance, but your pleasure at your improvement will make the task  an easy one. The Yogi is a most patient and persevering man, and his  great attainments are due largely to the possession of these  qualities.          CHAPTER XIV.      PHENOMENA OF YOGI PSYCHIC BREATHING.    With the exception of the instructions in the Yogi Rhythmic Breathing,  the majority of the exercises heretofore given in this book relate to  the physical plane of effort, which, while highly important in itself,  is also regarded by the Yogis as in the nature of affording a  substantial basis for efforts on the psychic and spiritual plane. Do  not, however, discard or think lightly of the physical phase of the  subject, for remember that it needs a sound body to support a sound  mind, and also that the body is the temple of the Ego, the lamp in  which burns the light of the Spirit. Everything is good in its place,  and everything has its place. The developed man is the \"all-around  man,\" who recognizes body, mind and spirit and renders to each its  due. Neglect of either is a mistake which must be rectified sooner or  later; a debt which must be repaid with interest.    We will now take up the Psychic phase of the Yogi Science of Breath in  the shape of a series of exercises, each exercise carrying with it its  explanation.    You will notice that in each exercise rhythmic breathing is  accompanied with the instructions to \"carry the thought\" of certain  desired results. This mental attitude gives the Will a cleared track  upon which to exercise its force. We cannot, in this work, go into the  subject of the power of the Will, and must assume that you have some  knowledge of the subject. If you have no acquaintance with the  subject, you will find that the actual practice of the exercises  themselves will give you a much clearer knowledge than any amount of  theoretical teaching, for as the old Hindu proverb says, \"He who  tastes a grain of mustard seed knows more of its flavor than he who  sees an elephant load of it.\"    (1) GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR YOGI PSYCHIC BREATHING.    The basis of all Yogi Psychic Breathing is the Yogi Rhythmic Breath,  instruction regarding which we gave in our last chapter. In the  following exercises, in order to avoid useless repetition, we will say  merely, \"Breathe Rhythmically,\" and then give the instruction for the  exercise of the psychic force, or directed Will power working in  connection with the rhythmic breath vibrations. After a little  practice you will find that you will not need to count after the first  rhythmic breath, as the mind will grasp the idea of time and rhythm  and you will be able to breathe rhythmically at pleasure, almost  automatically. This will leave the mind clear for the sending of the  psychic vibrations under the direction of the Will. (See the following  first exercise for directions in using the Will.)    (2) PRANA DISTRIBUTING.    Lying flat on the floor or bed, completely relaxed, with hands resting  lightly over the Solar Plexus (over the pit of the stomach, where the  ribs begin to separate), breathe rhythmically. After the rhythm is  fully established _will_ that each inhalation will draw in an  increased supply of prana or vital energy from the Universal supply,  which will be taken up by the nervous system and stored in the Solar  Plexus. At each exhalation will that the prana or vital energy is  being distributed all over the body, to every organ and part; to every  muscle, cell and atom; to nerve, artery and vein; from the top of your  head to the soles of your feet; invigorating, strengthening and  stimulating every nerve; recharging every nerve center; sending  energy, force and strength all over the system. While exercising the  will, try to form a mental picture of the inrushing prana, coming in  through the lungs and being taken up at once by the Solar Plexus, then  with the exhaling effort, being sent to all parts of the system, down  to the finger tips and down to the toes. It is not necessary to use  the Will with an effort. Simply commanding that which you wish to  produce and then making the mental picture of it is all that is  necessary. Calm command with the mental picture is far better than  forcible willing, which only dissipates force needlessly. The above  exercise is most helpful and greatly refreshes and strengthens the  nervous system and produces a restful feeling all over the body. It is  especially beneficial In cases where one is tired or feels a lack of  energy.    (3) INHIBITING PAIN.    Lying down or sitting erect, breath rhythmically, holding the thought  that you are inhaling prana. Then when you exhale, send the prana to  the painful part to re-establish the circulation and nerve current.  Then inhale more prana for the purpose of driving out the painful  condition; then exhale, holding the thought that you are driving out  the pain. Alternate the two above mental commands, and with one  exhalation stimulate the part and with the next drive out the pain.  Keep this up for seven breaths, then practice the Cleansing Breath and  rest a while. Then try it again until relief comes, which will be  before long. Many pains will be found to be relieved before the seven  breaths are finished. If the hand is placed over the painful part, you  may get quicker results. Send the current of prana down the arm and  into the painful part.    (4) DIRECTING THE CIRCULATION.    Lying down or sitting erect, breathe rhythmically, and with the  exhalations direct the circulation to any part you wish, which may be  suffering from imperfect circulation. This is effective in cases of  cold feet or in cases of headache, the blood being sent downward in  both cases, in the first case warming the feet, and in the latter,  relieving the brain from too great pressure. In the case of headache,  try the Pain Inhibiting first, then follow with sending the blood  downward. You will often feel a warm feeling in the legs as the  circulation moves"]]]
