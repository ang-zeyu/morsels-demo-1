The subject being both common and universal,  needs no arguments to introduce it, and being so necessary for the  gratification of the appetite, stands in need of no encomiums  to allure persons to the practice of it; since there are but few  now-a-days who love not good eating and drinking. Therefore I entirely  quit those two topicks; but having three or four pages to be filled  up previous to the subject it self, I shall employ them on a subject I  think new, and not yet handled by any of the pretenders to the art of  cookery; and that is, the antiquity of it; which if it either instruct  or divert, I shall be satisfied, if you are so.    \"Cookrey, confectionary, &c., like all other sciences and arts, had  their infancy, and did not arrive at a state of maturity but by slow  degrees, various experiments, and a long tract of time: for in the  infant-age of the world, when the new inhabitants contented themselves  with the simple provision of nature, viz. the vegetable diet, the  fruits and production of the teeming ground, as they succeeded one  another in their several peculiar seasons, the art of cookery was  unknown; apples, nuts, and herbs, were both meat and sauce, and  mankind stood in no need of any additional sauces, ragoes, &c., but a  good appetite; which a healthful and vigorous constitution, a clear,  wholesome, odoriferous air, moderate exercise, and an exemption from  anxious cares, always supplied them with.    \"We read of no palled appetites, but such as proceeded from the decays  of nature by reason of an advanced old age; but on the contrary a  craving stomach, even upon a death-bed, as in Isaac: nor no sicknesses  but those that were both the first and the last, which proceeded from  the struggles of nature, which abhorred the dissolution of soul and  body; no physicians to prescribe for the sick, nor no apothecaries  to compound medicines for two thousand years and upwards. Food and  physick were then one and the same thing.    \"But when men began to pass from a vegetable to an animal diet, and  feed on flesh, fowls, and fish, then seasonings grew necessary, both  to render it more palatable and savoury, and also to preserve that  part which was not immediately spent from stinking and corruption: and  probably salt was the first seasoning discover'd; for of salt we read,  Gen. xiv.    \"And this seems to be necessary, especially for those who were  advanced in age, whose palates, with their bodies, had lost their  vigour as to taste, whose digestive faculty grew weak and impotent;  and thence proceeded the use of soops and savoury messes; so that  cookery then began to become a science, though luxury had not brought  it to the height of an art. Thus we read, that Jacob made such  palatable pottage, that Esau purchased a mess of it at the extravagant  price of his birthright. And Isaac, before by his last will and  testament he bequeathed his blessing to his son Esau, required him  to make some savoury meat, such as his soul loved, i.e., such as was  relishable to his blunted palate.    \"So that seasonings of some sort were then in use; though whether  they were salt, savoury herbs, or roots only; or spices, the fruits  of trees, such as pepper, cloves, nutmeg; bark, as cinnamon; roots, as  ginger, &c., I shall not determine.    \"As for the methods of the cookery of those times, boiling or stewing  seems to have been the principal; broiling or roasting the next;  besides which, I presume scarce any other were used for two thousand  years and more; for I remember no other in the history of Genesis.    \"That Esau was the first cook, I shall not presume to assert; for  Abraham gave order to dress a fatted calf; but Esau is the first  person mentioned that made any advances beyond plain dressing, as  boiling, roasting, &c. For though we find indeed, that Rebecca his  mother was accomplished with the skill of making savoury meat as  well as he, yet whether he learned it from her, or she from him, is a  question too knotty for me to determine.    \"But cookery did not long remain a simple science, or a bare piece  of housewifry or family ceconomy, but in process of time, when luxury  entered the world, it grew to an art, nay a trade; for in I Sam. viii.  13. when the Israelites grew fashionists, and would have a king, that  they might be like the rest of their neighbours, we read of cooks,  confectioners, &c.    \"This art being of universal use, and in constant practice, has been  ever since upon the improvement; and we may, I think, with good reason  believe, is arrived at its greatest height and perfection, if it  is not got beyond it, even to its declension; for whatsoever new,  upstart, out-of-the-way messes some humourists have invented, such as  stuffing a roasted leg of mutton with pickled herring, and the like,  are only the sallies of a capricious appetite, and debauching rather  than improving the art itself.    \"The art of cookery, &c., is indeed diversified according to the  diversity of nations or countries; and to treat of it in that latitude  would fill an unportable volume; and rather confound than improve  those that would accomplish themselves with it. I shall therefore  confine what I have to communicate within the limits of practicalness  and usefulness, and so within the compass of a manual, that shall  neither burthen the hands to hold, the eyes in reading, nor the mind  in conceiving.    \"What you will find in the following sheets, are directions generally  for dressing after the best, most natural, and wholesome manner, such  provisions as are the product of our own country, and in such a manner  as is most agreeable to English palates: saving that I have so far  temporized, as, since we have to our disgrace so fondly admired the  French tongue, French modes, and also French messes, to present you  now and then with such receipts of French cookery, as I think may not  be disagreeable to English palates.    \"There are indeed already in the world various books that treat on  this subject, and which bear great names, as cooks to kings, princes,  and noblemen, and from which one might justly expect something more  than many, if not most of these I have read, perform, but found  my self deceived in my expectations; for many of them to us are  impracticable, others whimsical, others unpalatable, unless to  depraved palates; some unwholesome, many things copied from old  authors, and recommended without (as I am persuaded) the copiers ever  having had any experience of the palatableness, or had any regard to  the wholesomness of them; which two things ought to be the standing  rules, that no pretenders to cookery ought to deviate from. And I  cannot but believe, that those celebrated performers, notwithstanding  all their professions of having ingenuously communicated their art,  industriously concealed their best receipts from the publick.    \"But what I here present the world with is the product of my own  experience, and that for the space of thirty years and upwards; during  which time I have been constantly employed in fashionable and noble  families, in which the provisions ordered according to the following  directions, have had the general approbation of such as have been at  many noble entertainments.    \"These receipts are all suitable to English constitutions and  English palates, wholesome, toothsome, all practicable and easy to  be performed. Here are those proper for a frugal, and also for a  sumptuous table, and if rightly observed, will prevent the spoiling  of many a good dish of meat, the waste of many good materials, the  vexation that frequently attends such mismanagements, and the curses  not unfrequently bestowed on cooks with the usual reflection, that  whereas God sends good meat, the devil sends cooks.    \"As to those parts that treat of confectionary, pickles, cordials,  English wines, &c., what I have said in relation to cookery is equally  applicable to them also.    \"It is true, I have not been so numerous in receipts as some who have  gone before me, but I think I have made amends in giving none but what  are approved and practicable, and fit either for a genteel or a noble  Table; and altho' I have omitted odd and fantastical messes, yet I  have set down a considerable number of receipts.    \"The treatise is divided into ten parts: cookery contains above an  hundred receipts, pickles fifty, puddings above fifty, pastry above  forty, cakes forty, creams and jellies above forty, preserving an  hundred, made wines forty, cordial waters and powders above seventy,  medicines and salves above two hundred; in all near eight hundred.    \"I have likewise presented you with schemes engraven on copper-plates  for the regular disposition or placing the dishes of provision on the  table according to the best manner, both for summer and winter, first  and second courses, &c.    \"As for the receipts for medicines, salves, ointments, good in several  diseases, wounds, hurts, bruises, aches, pains, &c., which amount to  above two hundred, they are generally family receipts, that have never  been made publick; excellent in their kind, and approved remedies,  which have not been obtained by me without much difficulty; and of  such efficacy in distempers, &c., to which they are appropriated, that  they have cured when all other means have failed; and a few of them  which I have communicated to a friend, have procured a very handsome  livelihood.    \"They are very proper for those generous, charitable, and Christian  gentlewomen that have a disposition to be serviceable to their poor  country neighbours, labouring under any of the afflicted circumstances  mentioned; who by making the medicines, and generously contributing  as occasions offer, may help the poor in their afflictions, gain  their good-will and wishes, entitle themselves to their blessings and  prayers, and also have the pleasure of seeing the good they do in this  world, and have good reason to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12296"],[0,"Camps and Trails in China (#10)"],[1,"ay.    \"There is probably no creature in the wilds which shows such a combination  of daring strategy and slinking cowardice as the tiger. Often courage fails  him after he has secured his victim, and he releases it to dash off into  the nearest wood.    \"I knew of two Chinese who were deer hunting on a mountain-side when a  large tiger was routed from his bed. The beast made a rushing attack on the  man standing nearest to the path of his retreat, and seizing him by the leg  dragged him into the ravine below. Luckily the man succeeded in grasping a  small tree whereupon the tiger released his hold, leaving his victim lying  upon the ground almost paralyzed with pain and fear.    \"A group of men were gathering fuel on the hills near Futsing when a tiger  which had been sleeping in the high grass was disturbed. The enraged beast  turned upon the peasants, killing two of them instantly and striking  another a ripping blow with his paw which sent him lifeless to the terrace  below. The beast did not attempt to drag either of its victims into the  bush or to attack the other persons near by.    \"The strength and vitality of a full grown tiger are amazing. I had  occasion to spend the night a short time ago in a place where a tiger had  performed some remarkable feats. Just at dusk one of these marauders  visited the village and discovered a cow and her six-months-old calf in a  pen which had been excavated in the side of a hill and adjoined a house.  There was no possible way to enter the enclosure except by a door opening  from the main part of the dwelling or to descend from above. The tiger  jumped from the roof upon the neck of the heifer, killing it instantly, and  the inmates of the house opened the door just in time to see the animal  throw the calf out bodily and leap after it himself. I measured the  embankment and found that the exact height was twelve and a half feet.    \"The same tiger one noon on a foggy day attacked a hog, just back of the  village and carried it into the hills. The villagers pursued the beast and  overtook it within half a mile. When the hog, which dressed weighed more  than two hundred pounds, was found, it had no marks or bruises upon it  other than the deep fang wounds in the neck. This is another instance where  courage failed a tiger after he had made off with his kill to a safe  distance. The Chinese declare that when carrying such a load a tiger never  attempts to drag its prey, but throws it across its back and races off at  top speed.    \"The finest trophy taken from Fukien Province in years I shot in May,  1910. Two days previous to my hunt this tiger had killed and eaten a  sixteen-year-old boy. I happened to be in the locality and decided to make  an attempt to dispose of the troublesome beast. Obtaining a mother goat  with two small kids, I led them into a ravine near where the boy had been  killed. The goat was tied to a tree a short distance from the lair, and the  kids were concealed in the tall grass well in toward the place where the  tiger would probably be. I selected a suitable spot and kneeled down behind  a bank of ferns and grass. The fact that one may be stalked by the very  beast which one is hunting adds to the excitement and keeps one's nerves on  edge. I expected that the tiger would approach stealthily as long as he  could not see the goat, as the usual plan of attack, so far as my  observation goes, is to creep up under cover as far as possible before  rushing into the open. In any case the tiger would be within twenty yards  of me before it could be seen.    \"For more than two hours I sat perfectly still, alert and waiting, behind  the little blind of ferns and grass. There was nothing to break the silence  other than the incessant bleating of the goats and the unpleasant rasping  call of the mountain jay. I had about given up hope of a shot when suddenly  the huge head of the man-eater emerged from the bush, exactly where I had  expected he would appear and within fifteen feet of the kids. The back,  neck, and head of the beast were in almost the same plane as he moved  noiselessly forward.    \"I had implicit confidence in the killing power of the gun in my hand, and  at the crack of the rifle the huge brute settled forward with hardly a  quiver not ten feet from the kids upon which he was about to spring. A  second shot was not necessary but was fired as a matter of precaution as  the tiger had fallen behind rank grass, and the bullet passed through the  shoulder blade lodging in the spine. The beast measured more than nine feet  and weighed almost four hundred pounds.    \"Upon hearing the shots the villagers swarmed into the ravine, each eager  not so much to see their slain tormentor as to gather up the blood. But  little attention was paid to the tiger until every available drop was  sopped up with rags torn from their clothing, whilst men and children even  pulled up the blood-soaked grass. I learned that the blood of a tiger is  used for two purposes. A bit of blood-stained cloth is tied about the neck  of a child as a preventive against either measles or smallpox, and tiger  flesh is eaten for the same purpose. It is also said that if a handkerchief  stained with tiger blood is waved in front of an attacking dog the animal  will slink away cowed and terrified.    \"From the Chinese point of view the skin is not the most valuable part of a  tiger. Almost always before a hunt is made, or a trap is built, the  villagers burn incense before the temple god, and an agreement is made to  the effect that if the enterprise be successful the skin of the beast taken  becomes the property of the gods. Thus it happens that in many of the  temples handsome tiger-skin robes may be found spread in the chair occupied  by the noted 'Duai Uong,' or the god of the land. When a hunt is  successful, the flesh and bones are considered of greatest value, and it  often happens that a number of cows are killed and their flesh mixed with  that of the tiger to be sold at the exorbitant price cheerfully paid for  tiger meat. The bones are boiled for a number of days until a gelatine-like  product results, and this is believed to be exceptionally efficacious  medicine.    \"Notwithstanding the danger of still-hunting a tiger in the tangle of its  lair, one cannot but feel richly rewarded for the risk when one begins to  sum up one's observations. The most interesting result of investigating an  oft-frequented lair is concerning the animal's food. That a tiger always  devours its prey upon the spot where it is taken or in the adjacent bush is  an erroneous idea. This is often true when the kill is too heavy to be  carried for a long distance, but it is by no means universally so. Not long  ago the remains of a young boy were found in a grave adjacent to a tiger's  lair a few miles from Futsing city. No child had been reported missing in  the immediate neighborhood and everything indicated that the boy had been  brought alive to this spot from a considerable distance. The sides of the  grave were besmeared with the blood of the unfortunate victim, indicating  that the tiger had tortured it just as a cat plays with a mouse as long as  it remains alive.    \"In the lair of a tiger there are certain terraces, or places under  overhanging trees, which are covered with bones, and are evidently spots to  which the animal brings its prey to be devoured. On such a terrace one will  find the remains of deer, wild hog, dog, pig, porcupine, pangolin, and  other animals both domestic and wild. A fresh kill shows that with its  rasp-like tongue the tiger licks off all the hair of its prey before  devouring it and the hair will be found in a circle around what remains of  the kill. The Chinese often raid a lair in order to gather up the quills of  the porcupine and the bony scales of the pangolin which are esteemed for  medicinal purposes.    \"In addition to the larger animals, tigers feed upon reptiles and frogs  which they find among the rice fields. On the night of April 22, 1914, a  party of frog catchers were returning from a hunt when the man carrying the  load of frogs was attacked by a tiger and killed. The animal made no  attempt to drag the man away and it would appear that it was attracted by  the croaking of the frogs.\"    \"One often finds trees 'marked' by tigers beside some trail or path in, or  adjacent to, a lair. Catlike, the tiger measures its full length upon a  tree, standing in a convenient place, and with its powerful claws rips  deeply through the bark. This sign is doubly interesting to the sportsman  as it not only indicates the presence of a tiger in the immediate vicinity  but serves to give an accurate idea as to the size of the beast. The trails  leading into a lair often are marked in a different way. In doing this the  animal rakes away the grass with a forepaw and gathers it into a pile, but  claw prints never appear.\"          CHAPTER VII      THE BLUE TIGER    After one has traveled in a Chinese _sampan_ for several days the prospect  of a river journey is not very alluring but we had a most agreeable  surprise when we sailed out of Foochow in a chartered house boat to hunt  the \"blue tiger\" at Futsing. In fact, we had all the luxury of a private  yacht, for our boat contained a large central cabin with a table and chairs  and two staterooms and was manned by a captain and crew of six men--all for  $1.50 per day!    In the evening we talked of the blue tiger for a long time before we spread  our beds on the roof of the boat and went to sleep under the stars. We left  the boat shortly after daylight at Daing-nei for the six-mile walk to  Lung-tao. To my great surprise the coolies were considerably distressed at  the lightness of our loads. In this region they are paid by weight and some  of the bearers carry almost incredible burdens. As an example, one of our  men came into camp swinging a 125-pound trunk on each end of his pole,  laughing and chatting as"]]]
