All surprise had vanished, the Mussulmans measured at a glance the  numbers of the Christians, and attacked them in full assurance of  success, whatever heroism they might display; and the crusaders  themselves indulged in no more self-illusion, and thought only of  defending themselves.  Lack of provisions and sickness soon rendered  defence almost as impossible as attack; every day saw the Christian camp  more and more encumbered with the famine-stricken, the dying, and the  dead; and the necessity for retreating became evident.  Louis made to the  Sultan Malek-Moaddam an offer to evacuate Egypt, and give up Damietta,  provided that the kingdom of Jerusalem were restored to the Christians,  and the army permitted to accomplish its retreat without obstruction.  The sultan, without accepting or rejecting the proposition, asked what  guarantees would be given him for the surrender of Damietta.  Louis  offered as hostage one of his brothers, the Count of Anjou, or the Count  of Poitiers.  \"We must have the king himself,\" said the Mussulmans.  A  unanimous cry of indignation arose amongst the crusaders.  \"We would  rather,\" said Geoffrey de Sargines, \"that we had been all slain, or taken  prisoners by the Saracens, than be reproached with having left our king  in pawn.\"  All negotiation was broken off; and on the 5th of April, 1250,  the crusaders decided upon retreating.    This was the most deplorable scene of a deplorable drama; and at the same  time it was, for the king, an occasion for displaying, in their most  sublime and most attractive traits, all the virtues of the Christian.  Whilst sickness and famine were devastating the camp, Louis made himself  visitor, physician, and comforter; and his presence and his words  exercised upon the worst cases a searching influence.  He had one day  sent his chaplain, William de Chartres, to visit one of his household  servants, a modest man of some means, named Gaugelme, who was at the  point of death.  When the chaplain was retiring, \"I am waiting for my  lord, our saintly king, to come,\" said the dying man; \"I will not depart  this life until I have seen him and spoken to him: and then I will die.\"  The king came, and addressed to him the most affectionate words of  consolation; and when he had left him, and before he had re-entered his  tent, he was told that Gaugelme had expired.  When the 5th of April, the  day fixed for the retreat, had come, Louis himself was ill and much  enfeebled.  He was urged to go aboard one of the vessels which were to  descend the Nile, carrying the wounded and the most suffering; but he  refused absolutely, saying, \"I don't separate from my people in the hour  of danger.\"  He remained on land, and when he had to move forward he  fainted twice.  When he came to himself, he was amongst the last to leave  the camp, got himself helped on to the back of a little Arab horse,  covered with silken housings, and marched at a slow pace with the  rear-guard, having beside him Geoffrey de Sargines, who watched over him,  \"and protected me against the Saracens,\" said Louis himself to Joinville,  \"as a good servant protects his lord's tankard against the flies.\"    Neither the king's courage nor his servants' devotion was enough to  insure success, even to the retreat.  At four leagues' distance from the  camp it had just left, the rear-guard of the crusaders, harassed by  clouds of Saracens, was obliged to halt.  Louis could no longer keep on  his horse.  He was put up at a house,\" says Joinville, \"and laid, almost  dead, upon the lap of a tradeswoman from Paris; and it was believed that  he would not last till evening.\"  With his consent, one of his lieges  entered into parley with one of the Mussulman chiefs; a truce was about  to be concluded, and the Mussulman was taking off his ring from his  finger as a pledge that he would observe it.  \"But during this,\" says  Joinville, \"there took place a great mishap.  A traitor of a sergeant,  whose name was Marcel, began calling to our people, 'Sirs knights,  surrender, for such is the king's command: cause not the king's death.'  All thought that it was the king's command; and they gave up their swords  to the Saracens.\"  Being forthwith declared prisoners, the king and all  the rear-guard were removed to Mansourah; the king by boat; and his two  brothers, the Counts of Anjou and Poitiers, and all the other crusaders,  drawn up in a body and shackled, followed on foot on the river bank.  The  advance-guard, and all the rest of the army, soon met the same fate.    Ten thousand prisoners--this was all that remained of the crusade that  had started eighteen months before from Aigues-Mortes.  Nevertheless the  lofty bearing and the piety of the king still inspired the Mussulmans  with great respect.  A negotiation was opened between him and the Sultan  Malek-Moaddam, who, having previously freed him from his chains, had him  treated with a certain magnificence.  As the price of a truce and of his  liberty, Louis received a demand for the immediate surrender of Damietta,  a heavy ransom, and the restitution of several places which the  Christians still held in Palestine.  \"I cannot dispose of those places,\"  said Louis, \"for they do not belong to me; the princes and the Christian  orders, in whose hands they are, can alone keep or surrender them.\"  The  sultan, in anger, threatened to have the king put to the torture, or sent  to the Grand Khalif of Bagdad, who would detain him in prison for the  rest of his days.  \"I am your prisoner,\" said Louis; \"you can do with me  what you will.\"  \"You call yourself our prisoner,\" said the Mussulman  negotiators, \"and so, we believe you are; but you treat us as if you had  us in prison.\"  The sultan perceived that he had to do with an  indomitable spirit; and he did not insist any longer upon more than the  surrender of Damietta, and on a ransom of five hundred thousand livres  (that is, about ten million one hundred and thirty-two thousand francs,  or four hundred and five thousand two hundred and eighty pounds, of  modern money, according to M. de Wailly, supposing, as is probable, that  livres of Tours are meant).  \"I will pay willingly five hundred thousand  livres for the deliverance of my people,\" said Louis, and I will give up  Damietta for the deliverance of my own person, for I am not a man who  ought to be bought and sold for money.\"  \"By my faith,\" said the sultan,  the Frank is liberal not to have haggled about so large a sum.  Go tell  him that I will give him one hundred thousand livres to help towards  paying the ransom.\"  The negotiation was concluded on this basis; and  victors and vanquished quitted Mansourah, and arrived, partly by land and  partly by the Nile, within a few leagues of Damietta, the surrender of  which was fixed for the 7th of May.  But five days previously a tragic  event took place.  Several emirs of the Mamelukes suddenly entered  Louis's tent.  They had just slain the Sultan Malek-Moaddam, against whom  they had for some time been conspiring.  \"Fear nought, sir,\" said they to  the king; \"this was to be.  Do what concerns you in respect of the  stipulated conditions, and you shall be free.\"  Of these emirs one, who  had slain the sultan with his own hand, asked the king, brusquely, \"What  wilt thou give me?  I have slain thine enemy, who would have put thee to  death, had he lived;\" and he asked to be made knight.  Louis answered not  a word.  Some of the crusaders present urged him to satisfy the desire of  the emir, who had in his power the decision of their fate.  \"I will never  confer knighthood on an infidel,\" said Louis; \"let the emir turn  Christian; I will take him away to France, enrich him, and make him  knight.\"  It is said that, in their admiration for this piety and this  indomitable firmness, the emirs had at one time a notion of taking Louis  himself for sultan in the place of him whom they had just slain; and this  report was probably not altogether devoid of foundation, for, some time  afterwards, in the intimacy of the conversations between them, Louis one  day said to Joinville, \"Think you that I would have taken the kingdom of  Babylon, if they had offered it to me?\"  \"Whereupon I told him,\" adds  Joinville, \"that he would have done a mad act, seeing that they had slain  their lord; and he said to me that of a truth he would not have refused.\"  However that may be, the conditions agreed upon with the late Sultan  Malek-Moaddam were carried out; on the 7th of May, 1250, Geoffrey  de Sargines gave up to the emirs the keys of Damietta; and the Mussulmans  entered in tumultuously.  The king was waiting aboard his ship for the  payment which his people were to make for the release of his brother, the  Count of Poitiers; and, when he saw approaching a bark on which he  recognized his brother, \"Light up! light up!\" he cried instantly to his  sailors; which was the signal agreed upon for setting out.  And leaving  forthwith the coast of Egypt, the fleet which bore the remains of the  Christian army made sail for the shores of Palestine.    The king, having arrived at  St. Jean d'Acre on the 14th of May, 1250,  accepted without shrinking the trial imposed upon him by his unfortunate  situation.  He saw his forces considerably reduced; and the majority of  the crusaders left to him, even his brothers themselves, did not hide  their ardent desire to return to France.  He had that virtue, so rare  amongst kings, of taking into consideration the wishes of his comrades,  and of desiring their free assent to the burden he asked them to bear  with him.  He assembled the chief of them, and put the question plainly  before them.  \"The queen, my mother,\" he said, \"biddeth me and prayeth me  to get me hence to France, for that my kingdom hath neither peace nor  truce with the king of England.  The folk here tell me that, if I get me  hence, this land is lost, for none of those that be there will dare to  abide"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11953"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 3 (#10)"],[1,"without much belief in  the duke's firmness.  He himself, full of courage as he was, durst not  yet declare himself openly.  The thought of all this occupied his mind  incessantly, sleeping and waking.  One night, when he had fallen asleep  towards morning, it seemed to him that a voice kept saying, _Surgite cum  sederitis, qui manducatis panem doloris_ (Rise up from your sitting, ye  who eat the bread of sorrow).  When he awoke, his wife, a good and pious  woman, said to him, \"My dear, this morning I heard some one saying to  you, or you pronouncing in a dream, some words that I have often read in  my Hours;\" and she repeated them to him.  \"My dear,\" answered Juvenal,  \"we have eleven children, and consequently great cause to pray God to  grant us peace; let us hope in Him, and He will help us.\"  He often saw  the Duke of Berry.  \"Well, Juvenal,\" the old prince would say to him,  \"shall this last forever?  Shall we be forever under the sway of these  lewd fellows?\"  \"My lord,\" Juvenal would answer, \"hope we in God; yet a  little while and we shall see them confounded and destroyed.\"    Nor was Juvenal mistaken.  The opposition to the yoke of the Burgundians  was daily becoming more and more earnest and general.  The butchers  attempted to stein the current; but the carpenters took sides against  them, saying, \"We will see which are the stronger in Paris, the hewers of  wood or the fellers of oxen.\"  The parliament, the exchequer-chamber, and  the Hotel-de-Ville demanded peace; and the shouts of Peace! peace!  resounded in the streets.  A great crowd of people assembled on the  Greve; and thither the butchers came with their company of about twelve  hundred persons, it is said.  They began to speak against peace, but  could not get a hearing.  \"Let those who are for it go to the right,\"  shouted a voice, \"and those who are against it to the left!\" But the  adversaries of peace durst not risk this test.  The Duke of Burgundy  could not help seeing that he was declining rapidly; he was no longer  summoned to the king's council; a watch was kept upon his house; and he  determined to go away.  On the 23d of August, 1413, without a word said,  even to his household, he went away to the wood of Vincennes, prevailing  on the king to go hawking with him.  There was a suspicion that the duke  meant to carry off the king.  Juvenal des Ursins, with a company of armed  burgesses, hurried off to Vincennes, and going straight to the king,  said, \"Sir, come away to Paris; it is too hot to be out.\"  The king  turned to go back to the city.  The Duke of Burgundy was angry, saying  that the king was going a-hawking.  \"You would take him too far,\"  rejoined Juvenal; \"your people are in travelling dress, and you have  your trumpeters with you.\"    [Illustration: John the Fearless----51]    The duke took leave of the king, said business required his presence in  Flanders, and went off as fast as he could.    When it was known that he had gone, there was a feeling of regret and  disquietude amongst the sensible and sober burgesses at Paris.  What they  wanted was peace; and in order to have it the adherence of the Duke of  Burgundy was indispensable.  Whilst he was present, there might be hope  of winning him or forcing him over to it; but, whilst he was absent,  headstrong as he was known to be, a renewal of war was the most probable  contingency.  And this result appeared certain when it was seen how the  princes hostile to the Duke of Burgundy, above all, Duke Charles of  Orleans, the Count of Armagnac and their partisans hastened back to  Paris, and resumed their ascendency with the king and in his council.  The _dauphin_, Louis Duke of Aquitaine, united himself by the ties of  close friendship with the Duke of Orleans, and prevailed upon him to give  up the mourning he had worn since his father's murder; the two princes  appeared everywhere dressed alike; the scarf of Armagnac re-placed that  of Burgundy; the feelings of the populace changed as the fashion of the  court; and when children sang in the streets the song but lately in  vogue, \"Burgundy's duke, God give thee joy!\" they were struck and hurled  to the ground.  Facts were before long in accordance with appearances.  After a few pretences of arrangement the Duke of Burgundy took up arms  and marched on Paris.  Charles VI., on his side, annulled, in the  presence of Parliament, all acts adverse to the Duke of Orleans and his  adherents; and the king, the queen, and the _dauphin_ bound themselves by  oath not to treat with the duke of Burgundy until they had destroyed his  power.  At the end of March, 1414, the king's army was set in motion;  Compiegne, Soissons, and Bapaume, which held out for the Duke of  Burgundy, were successively taken by assault or surrendered; the royal  troops treated the people as vanquished rebels; and the four great  communes of Flanders sent a deputation to the king to make protestations  of their respect and an attempt to arrange matters between their lord and  his suzerain.  Animosity was still too lively and too recent in the  king's camp to admit of satisfaction with a victory as yet incomplete.  On the 28th of July began the siege of Arras; but after five weeks the  besiegers had made no impression; an epidemic came upon them; the Duke of  Bavaria and the constable, Charles d'Albret, were attacked by it;  weariness set in on both sides; the Duke of Burgundy' himself began to be  anxious about his position; and he sent the Duke of Brabant, his brother,  and the Countess of Hainault, his sister, to the king and the _dauphin_,  with more submissive words than he had hitherto deigned to utter.  The  Countess of Hainault, pleading the ties of family and royal interests,  managed to give the _dauphin_ a bias towards peace; and the _dauphin_ in  his turn worked upon the mind of the king, who was becoming more and more  feeble and accessible to the most opposite impressions.  It was in vain  that the most intimate friends of the Duke of Orleans tried to keep the  king steadfast in his wrath from night to morning.  One day, when he was  still in bed, one of them softly approaching and putting his hand under  the coverlet, said, plucking him by the foot, \"My lord, are you asleep?\"  \"No, cousin,\" answered the king; \"you are quite welcome; is there  anything new?\"  \"No, sir; only that your people report that if you would  assault Arras there would be good hope of effecting an entry.\"  \"But if  my cousin of Burgundy listens to reason, and puts the town into my hands  without assault, we will make peace.\"  \"What! sir; you would make peace  with this wicked, this disloyal man who so cruelly had your brother  slain?\"  \"But all was forgiven him with the consent of my nephew of  Orleans,\" said the king mournfully.  \"Alas! sir, you will never see that  brother again.\"  \"Let me be, cousin,\" said the king, impatiently; \"I  shall see him again on the day of judgment.\"    Notwithstanding this stubborn way of working up the irreconcilable  enmities which caused divisions in the royal family, peace was decided  upon and concluded at Arras, on the 4th of September, 1414, on conditions  as vague as ever, which really put no end to the causes of civil war, but  permitted the king on the one hand and the Duke of Burgundy on the other,  to call themselves and to wear an appearance of being reconciled.  A  serious event which happened abroad at that time was heavily felt in  France, reawakened the spirit of nationality, and opened the eyes of all  parties a little to the necessity of suspending their own selfish  disagreements.  Henry IV., King of England, died on the 20th of March,  1413.  Having been chiefly occupied with the difficulties of his own  government at home, he, without renouncing the war with France, had not  prosecuted it vigorously, and had kept it in suspense or adjournment by a  repetition of truces.  Henry V., his son and successor, a young prince of  five and twenty, active, ambitious, able, and popular, gave, from the  very moment of his accession, signs of having bolder views, which were  not long coming to maturity, in respect of his relations with France.  The Duke of Burgundy had undoubtedly anticipated them, for, as soon as he  was cognizant of Henry IV.'s death, he made overtures in London for the  marriage of his daughter Catherine with the new King of England, and he  received at Bruges an English embassy on the subject.  When this was  known at Paris, the council of Charles VI. sent to the Duke of Burgundy  Sire de Dampierre and the Bishop of Evreux bearing letters to him from  the king \"which forbade him, on pain of forfeiture and treason, to enter  into any treaty with the King of England, either for his daughter's  marriage or for any other cause.\"  But the views of Henry V. soared  higher than a marriage with a daughter of the Duke of Burgundy.  It was  to the hand of the King of France's daughter, herself also named  Catherine, that he made pretension, flattering himself that he would find  in this union aid in support of his pretences to the crown of France.  These pretences he put forward, hardly a year after his accession to the  throne, basing them, as Edward III. had done, on the alleged right of  Isabel of France, wife of Edward II., to succeed King John.  No reply was  vouchsafed from Paris to this demand.  Only the Princess Catherine, who  was but thirteen, was presented to the envoys of the King of England, and  she struck them as being tall and beautiful.  A month later, in August,  1414, Henry V. gave Charles VI. to understand that he would be content  with a strict execution of the treaty of Bretigny, with the addition of  Normandy, Anjou, and Maine, and the hand of the Princess Catherine with a  dowry of two million crowns.  The war between Charles VI. and John the  Fearless caused a suspension of all negotiations on this subject; but,  after the peace of Arras, in January, 1415, a new and solemn embassy from"]]]
