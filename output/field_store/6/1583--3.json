IV    THE EMPIRE OF INDIA    India is a great triangle, 1,900 miles across its greatest length  and an equal distance across its greatest breadth. It extends  from a region of perpetual snow in the Himalayas, almost to the  equator. The superficial area is 1,766,642 square miles, and  you can understand better what that means when I tell you that  the United States has an area of 2,970,230 square miles, without  counting Alaska or Hawaii. India is about as large as that portion  of the United States lying east of a line drawn southward along  the western boundary of the Dakotas, Kansas and Texas.    The population of India in 1901 was 294,361,056 or about one-fifth  of the human race, and it comprises more than 100 distinct nations  and peoples in every grade of civilization from absolute savages to  the most complete and complex commercial and social organizations.  It has every variety of climate from the tropical humidity along  the southern coast to the frigid cold of the mountains; peaks of  ice, reefs of coral, impenetrable jungles and bleak, treeless  plains. One portion of its territory records the greatest rainfall  of any spot on earth; another, of several hundred thousand square  miles, is seldom watered with a drop of rain and is entirely  dependent for moisture upon the melting snows of the mountains.  Twelve thousands different kinds of animals are enumerated in  its fauna, 28,000 plants in its flora, and the statistical survey  prepared by the government fills 128 volumes of the size of our  census reports. One hundred and eighteen distinct languages are  spoken in various parts of India and fifty-nine of these languages  are spoken by more than 100,000 people each. A large number of  other languages and dialects are spoken by different tribes and  clans of less than 100,000 population. The British Bible Society  has published the whole or parts of the Holy Scriptures in forty-two  languages which reach 220,000,000 people, but leave 74,000,000  without the Holy Word. In order to give the Bible to the remainder  of the population of India it would be necessary to publish 108  additional translations, which the society has no money and no  men to prepare. From this little statement some conception of  the variety of the people of India may be obtained, because each  of the tribes and clans has its own distinct organization and  individuality, and each is practically a separate nation.

The Province of Rajputana is even larger, and has a  population of 74,744,886, almost as great as that of the entire  United States. Madras has a population of 38,000,000, and the  central provinces 47,000,000, while several of the 160 different  states into which India is divided have more than 10,000,000  each.    The population is divided according to religions as follows:      Hindus        207,146,422   Sikhs           2,195,268    Mohammedans    62,458,061   Jains           1,334,148    Buddhists       9,476,750   Parsees            94,190    Animistic       8,711,300   Jews               18,228    Christians      2,923,241    It will be interesting to know that of the Christians enumerated  at the last census 1,202,039 were Roman Catholics, 453,612 belonged  to the established Church of England, 322,586 were orthodox Greeks,  220,863 were Baptists, 155,455 Lutherans, 53,829 Presbyterians  and 157,847 put themselves down as Protestants without giving  the sect to which they adhere.    The foreign population of India is very small. The British-born  number only 96,653; 104,583 were born on the continent of Europe,  and only 641,854 out of nearly 300,000,000 were born outside  the boundaries of India.    India consists of four separate and well-defined regions: the  jungles of the coast and the vast tract of country known as the  Deccan, which make up the southern half of the Empire; the great  plain which stretches southward from the Himalayas and constitutes  what was formerly known as Hindustan; and a three-sided tableland  which lies between, in the center of the empire, and is drained  by a thousand rivers, which carry the water off as fast as it  falls and leave but little to refresh the earth. This is the  scene of periodical famine, but the government is pushing the  irrigation system so rapidly that before many years the danger  from that source will be much diminished.    The whole of southern India, according to the geologists, was once  covered by a great forest, and indeed there are still 66,305,506  acres in trees which are carefully protected. The black soil of  that region is proverbial for its fertility and produces cotton,  sugar cane, rice and other tropical and semi-tropical plants with  an abundance surpassed by no other region. The fruit-bearing  palms require a chapter to themselves in the botanies, and are a  source of surprising wealth. According to the latest census the  enormous area of 546,224,964 acres is under cultivation, which  is an average of nearly two acres per capita of population, and  probably two-thirds of it is actually cropped. About one-fourth  of this area is under irrigation and more than 22,000,000 acres  produce two crops a year.    Most of the population is scattered in villages, and the number  of people who are not supported by farms is much smaller than would  be supposed from the figures of the census. A large proportion of  the inhabitants returned as engaged in trade and other employments  really belong to the agricultural community, because they are the  agents of middlemen through whose hands the produce of the farms  passes. These people live in villages among the farming community.  In all the Empire there are only eight towns with more than 200,000  inhabitants; only three with more than 500,000, and only one with  a million, which is Calcutta. The other seven in order of size are  Bombay, Madras, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Rangoon, Benares and Delhi.  There are only twenty-nine towns with more than 100,000 inhabitants;  forty-nine with more than 50,000; 471 with more than 10,000; 877  with more than 5,000, and 2,134 organized municipalities with  a population of 1,000 or more. These municipalities represent an  aggregate population of 29,244,221 out of a total of 294,361,056,  leaving 265,134,722 inhabitants scattered upon farms and in 729,752  villages. The city population, however, is growing more rapidly  than that of the country, because of the efforts of the government  to divert labor from the farms to the factories. In Germany,  France, England and other countries of Europe and in the United  States the reverse policy is pursued. Their rural population is  drifting too rapidly to the cities, and the cities are growing  faster than is considered healthful. In India, during the ten  years from= 1891 to 1901 the city population has increased only  2,452,083, while the rural population has increased only 4,567,032.

This opinion is not, in the smallest degree, a departure from the  Happiness principle. The ingredients of happiness are very various, and  each of them is desirable in itself, and not merely when considered as  swelling an aggregate. The principle of utility does not mean that any  given pleasure, as music, for instance, or any given exemption from  pain, as for example health, are to be looked upon as means to a  collective something termed happiness, and to be desired on that  account. They are desired and desirable in and for themselves; besides  being means, they are a part of the end. Virtue, according to the  utilitarian doctrine, is not naturally and originally part of the end,  but it is capable of becoming so; and in those who love it  disinterestedly it has become so, and is desired and cherished, not as a  means to happiness, but as a part of their happiness.    To illustrate this farther, we may remember that virtue is not the only  thing, originally a means, and which if it were not a means to anything  else, would be and remain indifferent, but which by association with  what it is a means to, comes to be desired for itself, and that too with  the utmost intensity. What, for example, shall we say of the love of  money? There is nothing originally more desirable about money than about  any heap of glittering pebbles. Its worth is solely that of the things  which it will buy; the desires for other things than itself, which it is  a means of gratifying. Yet the love of money is not only one of the  strongest moving forces of human life, but money is, in many cases,  desired in and for itself; the desire to possess it is often stronger  than the desire to use it, and goes on increasing when all the desires  which point to ends beyond it, to be compassed by it, are falling off.  It may be then said truly, that money is desired not for the sake of an  end, but as part of the end. From being a means to happiness, it has  come to be itself a principal ingredient of the individual's conception  of happiness. The same may be said of the majority of the great objects  of human life--power, for example, or fame; except that to each of these  there is a certain amount of immediate pleasure annexed, which has at  least the semblance of being naturally inherent in them; a thing which  cannot be said of money. Still, however, the strongest natural  attraction, both of power and of fame, is the immense aid they give to  the attainment of our other wishes; and it is the strong association  thus generated between them and all our objects of desire, which gives  to the direct desire of them the intensity it often assumes, so as in  some characters to surpass in strength all other desires. In these cases  the means have become a part of the end, and a more important part of it  than any of the things which they are means to. What was once desired as  an instrument for the attainment of happiness, has come to be desired  for its own sake. In being desired for its own sake it is, however,  desired as part of happiness. The person is made, or thinks he would be  made, happy by its mere possession; and is made unhappy by failure to  obtain it. The desire of it is not a different thing from the desire of  happiness, any more than the love of music, or the desire of health.  They are included in happiness. They are some of the elements of which  the desire of happiness is made up. Happiness is not an abstract idea,  but a concrete whole; and these are some of its parts. And the  utilitarian standard sanctions and approves their being so. Life would  be a poor thing, very ill provided with sources of happiness, if there  were not this provision of nature, by which things originally  indifferent, but conducive to, or otherwise associated with, the  satisfaction of our primitive desires, become in themselves sources of  pleasure more valuable than the primitive pleasures, both in permanency,  in the space of human existence that they are capable of covering, and  even in intensity. Virtue, according to the utilitarian conception, is a  good of this description. There was no original desire of it, or motive  to it, save its conduciveness to pleasure, and especially to protection  from pain. But through the association thus formed, it may be felt a  good in itself, and desired as such with as great intensity as any other  good; and with this difference between it and the love of money, of  power, or of fame, that all of these may, and often do, render the  individual noxious to the other members of the society to which he  belongs, whereas there is nothing which makes him so much a blessing to  them as the cultivation of the disinterested, love of virtue. And  consequently, the utilitarian standard, while it tolerates and approves  those other acquired desires, up to the point beyond which they would be  more injurious to the general happiness than promotive of it, enjoins  and requires the cultivation of the love of virtue up to the greatest  strength possible, as being above all things important to the general  happiness.    It results from the preceding considerations, that there is in reality  nothing desired except happiness. Whatever is desired otherwise than as  a means to some end beyond itself, and ultimately to happiness, is  desired as itself a part of happiness, and is not desired for itself  until it has become so. Those who desire virtue for its own sake, desire  it either because the consciousness of it is a pleasure, or because the  consciousness of being without it is a pain, or for both reasons united;  as in truth the pleasure and pain seldom exist separately, but almost  always together, the same person feeling pleasure in the degree of  virtue attained, and pain in not having attained more. If one of these  gave him no pleasure, and the other no pain, he would not love or desire  virtue, or would desire it only for the other benefits which it might  produce to himself or to persons whom he cared for.    We have now, then, an answer to the question, of what sort of proof the  principle of utility is susceptible. If the opinion which I have now  stated is psychologically true--if human nature is so constituted as to  desire nothing which is not either a part of happiness or a means of  happiness, we can have no other proof, and we require no other, that  these are the only things desirable. If so, happiness is the sole end of  human action, and the promotion of it the test by which to judge of all  human conduct; from whence it necessarily follows that it must be the  criterion of morality, since a part is included in the whole.    And now to decide whether this is really so; whether mankind do desire  nothing for itself but that which is a pleasure to them, or of which the  absence is a pain; we have evidently arrived at a question of fact and  experience, dependent, like all similar questions, upon evidence. It can  only be determined by practised self-consciousness and self-observation,  assisted by observation of others. I believe that these sources of  evidence, impartially consulted, will declare that desiring a thing and  finding it pleasant, aversion to it and thinking of it as painful, are  phenomena entirely inseparable, or rather two parts of the same  phenomenon; in strictness of language, two different modes of naming the  same psychological fact: that to think of an object as desirable (unless  for the sake of its consequences), and to think of it as pleasant, are  one and the same thing; and that to desire anything, except in  proportion as the idea of it is pleasant, is a physical and metaphysical  impossibility.    So obvious does this appear to me, that I expect it will hardly be  disputed: and the objection made will be, not that desire can possibly  be directed to anything ultimately except pleasure and exemption from  pain, but that the will is a different thing from desire; that a person  of confirmed virtue, or any other person whose purposes are fixed,  carries out his purposes without any thought of the pleasure he has in  contemplating them, or expects to derive from their fulfilment; and  persists in acting on them, even though these pleasures are much  diminished, by changes in his character or decay of his passive  sensibilities, or are outweighed by the pains which the pursuit of the  purposes may bring upon him. All this I fully admit, and have stated it  elsewhere, as positively and emphatically as any one. Will, the active  phenomenon, is a different thing from desire, the state of passive  sensibility, and though originally an offshoot from it, may in time take  root and detach itself from the parent stock; so much so, that in the  case of an habitual purpose, instead of willing the thing because we  desire it, we often desire it only because we will it. This, however, is  but an instance of that familiar fact, the power of habit, and is nowise  confined to the case of virtuous actions. Many indifferent things, which  men originally did from a motive of some sort, they continue to do from  habit. Sometimes this is done unconsciously, the consciousness coming  only after the action: at other times with conscious volition, but  volition which has become habitual, and is put into operation by the  force of habit, in opposition perhaps to the deliberate preference, as  often happens with those who have contracted habits of vicious or  hurtful indulgence. Third and last comes the case in which the habitual "]]]
