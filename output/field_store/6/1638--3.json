[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1262"],[0,"The Heritage of the Desert: A Novel (#10)"],[1," he loved this man.    As the days passed Hare learned many other things. For a while illness  confined him to his bed on the porch. At night he lay listening to the  roar of the river, and watching the stars. Twice he heard a distant  crash and rumble, heavy as thunder, and he knew that somewhere along the  cliffs avalanches were slipping. By day he watched the cotton snow down  upon him, and listened to the many birds, and waited for the merry show  at recess-time. After a short time the children grew less shy and came  readily to him. They were the most wholesome children he had ever known.  Hare wondered about it, and decided it was not so much Mormon teaching  as isolation from the world. These children had never been out of their  cliff-walled home, and civilization was for them as if it were not. He  told them stories, and after school hours they would race to him and  climb on his bed, and beg for more.    He exhausted his supply of fairy-stories and animal stories; and had  begun to tell about the places and cities which he had visited when the  eager-eyed children were peremptorily called within by Mother Mary. This  pained him and he was at a loss to understand it. Enlightenment came,  however, in the way of an argument between Naab and Mother Mary which he  overheard. The elder wife said that the stranger was welcome to the  children, but she insisted that they hear nothing of the outside world,  and that they be kept to the teachings of the Mormon geography--which  made all the world outside Utah an untrodden wilderness. August Naab did  not hold to the letter of the Mormon law; he argued that if the children  could not be raised as Mormons with a full knowledge of the world, they  would only be lost in the end to the Church.    Other developments surprised Hare. The house of this good Mormon was  divided against itself. Precedence was given to the first and elder  wife--Mother Mary; Mother Ruth's life was not without pain. The men were  out on the ranges all day, usually two or more of them for several days  at a time, and this left the women alone. One daughter taught the  school, the other daughters did all the chores about the house, from  feeding the stock to chopping wood. The work was hard, and the girls  would rather have been in White Sage or Lund. They disliked Mescal, and  said things inspired by jealousy. Snap Naab's wife was vindictive, and  called Mescal \"that Indian!\"    It struck him on hearing this gossip that he had missed Mescal. What had  become of her? Curiosity prompting him, he asked little Billy about her.    \"Mescal's with the sheep,\" piped Billy.    That she was a shepherdess pleased Hare, and he thought of her as free  on the open range, with the wind blowing her hair.    One day when Hare felt stronger he took his walk round the farm with new  zest. Upon his return to the house he saw Snap's cream pinto in the  yard, and Dave's mustang cropping the grass near by. A dusty pack lay on  the ground. Hare walked down the avenue of cottonwoods and was about to  turn the corner of the old forge when he stopped short.    \"Now mind you, I'll take a bead on this white-faced spy if you send him  up there.\"    It was Snap Naab's voice, and his speech concluded with the click of  teeth characteristic of him in anger.    \"Stand there!\" August Naab exclaimed in wrath. \"Listen. You have been  drinking again or you wouldn't talk of killing a man. I warned you. I  won't do this thing you ask of me till I have your promise. Why won't  you leave the bottle alone?\"    \"I'll promise,\" came the sullen reply.    \"Very well. Then pack and go across to Bitter Seeps.\"    \"That job'll take all summer,\" growled Snap.    \"So much the better. When you come home I'll keep my promise.\"    Hare moved away silently; the shock of Snap's first words had kept him  fast in his tracks long enough to hear the conversation. Why did Snap  threaten him? Where was August Naab going to send him? Hare had no means  of coming to an understanding of either question. He was disturbed in  mind and resolved to keep out of Snap's way. He went to the orchard, but  his stay of an hour availed nothing, for on his return, after threading  the maze of cottonwoods, he came face to face with the man he wanted to  avoid.    Snap Naab, at the moment of meeting, had a black bottle tipped high  above his lips.    With a curse he threw the bottle at Hare, missing him narrowly. He was  drunk. His eyes were bloodshot.    \"If you tell father you saw me drinking I'll kill you!\" he hissed, and  rattling his Colt in its holster, he walked away.    Hare walked back to his bed, where he lay for a long time with his whole  inner being in a state of strife. It gradually wore off as he strove for  calm. The playground was deserted; no one had seen Snap's action, and  for that he was glad. Then his attention was diverted by a clatter of  ringing hoofs on the road; a mustang and a cloud of dust were  approaching.    \"Mescal and Black Bolly!\" he exclaimed, and sat up quickly. The mustang  turned in the gate, slid to a stop, and stood quivering, restive,  tossing its thoroughbred head, black as a coal, with freedom and fire in  every line. Mescal leaped off lightly. A gray form flashed in at the  gate, fell at her feet and rose to leap about her. It was a splendid  dog, huge in frame, almost white, wild as the mustang.    This was the Mescal whom he remembered, yet somehow different. The  sombre homespun garments had given place to fringed and beaded buckskin.    \"I've come for you,\" she said.    \"For me?\" he asked, wonderingly, as she approached with the bridle of  the black over her arm.    \"Down, Wolf!\" she cried to the leaping dog. \"Yes. Didn't you know?  Father Naab says you're to help me tend the sheep. Are you better? I  hope so-- You're quite pale.\"    \"I--I'm not so well,\" said Hare.    He looked up at her, at the black sweep of her hair under the white  band, at her eyes, like jet; and suddenly realized, with a gladness new  and strange to him, that he liked to look at her, that she was  beautiful.              V. BLACK SAGE AND JUNIPER    AUGUST NAAB appeared on the path leading from his fields.    \"Mescal, here you are,\" he greeted. \"How about the sheep?\"    \"Piute's driving them down to the lower range. There are a thousand  coyotes hanging about the flock.\"    \"That's bad,\" rejoined August. \"Jack, there's evidently some real  shooting in store for you. We'll pack to-day and get an early start to-  morrow. I'll put you on Noddle; he's slow, but the easiest climber I  ever owned. He's like riding... What's the matter with you? What's  happened to make you angry?\"    One of his long strides spanned the distance between them.    \"Oh, nothing,\" said Hare, flushing.    \"Lad, I know of few circumstances that justify a lie. You've met Snap.\"    Hare might still have tried to dissimulate; but one glance at August's  stern face showed the uselessness of it. He kept silent.    \"Drink makes my son unnatural,\" said Naab. He breathed heavily as one in  conflict with wrath. \"We'll not wait till to-morrow to go up on the  plateau; we'll go at once.\"    Then quick surprise awakened for Hare in the meaning in Mescal's eyes;  he caught only a fleeting glimpse, a dark flash, and it left him with a  glow of an emotion half pleasure, half pain.    \"Mescal,\" went on August, \"go into the house, and keep out of Snap's  way. Jack, watch me pack. You need to learn these things. I could put  all this outfit on two burros, but the trail is narrow, and a wide pack  might bump a burro off. Let's see, I've got all your stuff but the  saddle; that we'll leave till we get a horse for you. Well, all's  ready.\"    Mescal came at his call and, mounting Black Bolly, rode out toward the  cliff wall, with Wolf trotting before her. Hare bestrode Noddle. August,  waving good-bye to his women-folk, started the train of burros after  Mescal.    How they would be able to climb the face of that steep cliff puzzled  Hare. Upon nearer view he discovered the yard-wide trail curving upward  in cork-screw fashion round a projecting corner of cliff. The stone was  a soft red shale, and the trail had been cut in it at a steep angle. It  was so steep that the burros appeared to be climbing straight up. Noddle  pattered into it, dropped his head and his long ears and slackened his  pace to patient plodding. August walked in the rear.    The first thing that struck Hare was the way the burros in front of him  stopped at the curves in the trail, and turned in a space so small that  their four feet were close together; yet as they swung their packs they  scarcely scraped the wall. At every turn they were higher than he was,  going in the opposite direction, yet he could reach out and touch them.  He glanced up to see Mescal right above him, leaning forward with her  brown hands clasping the pommel. Then he looked out and down; already  the green cluster of cottonwoods lay far below. After that sensations  pressed upon him. Round and round, up and up, steadily, surely, the  beautiful mustang led the train; there were sounds of rattling stones,  and click of hoofs, and scrape of pack. On one side towered the iron-  stained cliff, not smooth or glistening at close range, but of dull,  dead, rotting rock. The trail changed to a zigzag along a seamed and  cracked buttress where ledges leaned outward waiting to fall. Then a  steeper incline, where the burros crept upward warily, led to a level  ledge heading to the left.    Mescal halted on a promontory. She, with her windblown hair, the gleam  of white band about her head, and a dash of red along the fringed  leggings, gave inexpressible life and beauty to that wild, jagged point  of rock, sharp against the glaring sky.    \"This is Lookout Point,\" said Naab. \"I keep an Indian here all the time  during daylight. He's a peon, a Navajo slave. He can't talk, as he was  born without a tongue, or it was cut out, but he has the best eyes of  any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12625"],[0,"Architecture and Democracy (#10)"],[1,"e; by so doing he will prove himself to be in relation  to the _anima mundi_. It is only by the establishment of such a  relation that new beauty comes to birth in the world.    [Illustration: Figure 11.]    Ornament in its primitive manifestations is geometrical rather than  naturalistic. This is in a manner strange, that the abstract and  metaphysical thing should precede the concrete and sensuous. It would  be natural to suppose that man would first imitate the things which  surround him, but the most cursory acquaintance with primitive art  shows that he is much more apt to crudely geometrize. Now it is  not necessary to assume that we are to revert to the conditions of  savagery in order to believe that in this matter of a sound aesthetic  we must begin where art has always begun--with number and geometry.  Nevertheless there is a subtly ironic view which one is justified in  holding in regard to quite obvious aspects of American life, in the  light of which that life appears to have rather more in common with  savagery than with culture.    [Illustration: Figure 12.]    [Illustration: Figure 13.]    The submersion of scholarship by athletics in our colleges is a case  in point, the contest of muscles exciting much more interest and  enthusiasm than any contest of wits. We persist in the savage habit of  devouring the corpses of slain animals long after the necessity for it  is past, and some even murder innocent wild creatures, giving to their  ferocity the name of sport. Our women bedeck themselves with furs and  feathers, the fruit of mercenary and systematic slaughter; we perform  orgiastic dances to the music of horns and drums and cymbals--in  short, we have the savage psychology without its vital religious  instinct and its sure decorative sense for color and form.    But this is of course true only of the surface and sunlit shadows of  the great democratic tide. Its depths conceal every kind of subtlety  and sophistication, high endeavour, and a response to beauty and  wisdom of a sort far removed from the amoeba stage of development  above sketched. Of this latter stage the simple figures of Euclidian  plane and solid geometry--figures which any child can understand--are  the appropriate symbols, but for that other more developed state of  consciousness--less apparent but more important--these will not do.  Something more sophisticated and recondite must be sought for if we  are to have an ornamental mode capable of expressing not only the  simplicity but the complexity of present-day psychology. This need not  be sought for outside the field of geometry, but within it, and by  an extension of the methods already described. There is an altogether  modern development of the science of mathematics: the geometry of  four dimensions. This represents the emancipation of the mind from  the tyranny of mere appearances; the turning of consciousness in a  new direction. It has therefore a high symbolical significance as  typifying that movement away from materialism which is so marked a  phenomenon of the times.    Of course to those whose notion of the fourth dimension is akin to  that of a friend of the author who described it as \"a wagon-load  of bung-holes,\" the idea of getting from it any practical advantage  cannot seem anything but absurd. There is something about this form  of words \"the fourth dimension\" which seems to produce a sort of  mental-phobia in certain minds, rendering them incapable of perception  or reason. Such people, because they cannot stick their cane into it  contend that the fourth dimension has no mathematical or philosophical  validity. As ignorance on this subject is very general, the following  essay will be devoted to a consideration of the fourth dimension and  its relation to a new ornamental mode.    [Illustration]          II    THE FOURTH DIMENSION      The subject of the fourth dimension is not an easy one to understand.  Fortunately the artist in design does not need to penetrate far into  these fascinating halls of thought in order to reap the advantage  which he seeks. Nevertheless an intention of mind upon this  \"fairy-tale of mathematics\" cannot fail to enlarge his intellectual  and spiritual horizons, and develop his imagination--that finest  instrument in all his chest of tools.    By way of introduction to the subject Prof. James Byrnie Shaw, in an  article in the _Scientific Monthly_, has this to say:        Up to the period of the Reformation algebraic equations of      more than the third degree were frowned upon as having no      real meaning, since there is no fourth power or dimension.      But about one hundred years ago this chimera became an actual      existence, and today it is furnishing a new world to physics,      in which mechanics may become geometry, time be co-ordinated      with space, and every geometric theorem in the world is a      physical theorem in the experimental world in study in the      laboratory. Startling indeed it is to the scientist to be told      that an artificial dream-world of the mathematician is      more real than that he sees with his galvanometers,      ultra-microscopes, and spectroscopes. It matters little that      he replies, \"Your four-dimensional world is only an analytic      explanation of my phenomena,\" for the fact remains a fact,      that in the mathematician's four-dimensional space there is      a space not derived in any sense of the term as a residue of      experience, however powerful a distillation of sensations or      perceptions be resorted to, for it is not contained at all in      the fluid that experience furnishes. It is a product of the      creative power of the mathematical mind, and its objects are      real in exactly the same way that the cube, the square, the      circle, the sphere or the straight line. We are enabled to see      with the penetrating vision of the mathematical insight that      no less real and no more real are these fantastic forms of the      world of relativity than those supposed to be uncreatable or      indestructible in the play of the forces of nature.    These \"fantastic forms\" alone need concern the artist. If by some  potent magic he can precipitate them into the world of sensuous images  so that they make music to the eye, he need not even enter into the  question of their reality, but in order to achieve this transmutation  he should know something, at least, of the strange laws of their  being, should lend ear to a fairy-tale in which each theorem is a  paradox, and each paradox a mathematical fact.    He must conceive of a space of four mutually independent directions; a  space, that is, having a direction at right angles to every direction  that we know. We cannot point to this, we cannot picture it, but we  can reason about it with a precision that is all but absolute. In such  a space it would of course be possible to establish four axial lines,  all intersecting at a point, and all mutually at right angles with one  another. Every hyper-solid of four-dimensional space has these four  axes.    The regular hyper-solids (analogous to the Platonic solids of  three-dimensional space) are the \"fantastic forms\" which will prove  useful to the artist. He should learn to lure them forth along them  axis lines. That is, let him build up his figures, space by space,  developing them from lower spaces to higher. But since he cannot enter  the fourth dimension, and build them there, nor even the third--if he  confines himself to a sheet of paper--he must seek out some form of  _representation_ of the higher in the lower. This is a process with  which he is already acquainted, for he employs it every time he makes  a perspective drawing, which is the representation of a solid on  a plane. All that is required is an extension of the method: a  hyper-solid can be represented in a figure of three dimensions, and  this in turn can be projected on a plane. The achieved result will  constitute a perspective of a perspective--the representation of a  representation.    This may sound obscure to the uninitiated, and it is true that the  plane projection of some of the regular hyper-solids are staggeringly  intricate affairs, but the author is so sure that this matter lies so  well within the compass of the average non-mathematical mind that he  is willing to put his confidence to a practical test.    It is proposed to develop a representation of the tesseract or  hyper-cube on the paper of this page, that is, on a space of two  dimensions. Let us start as far back as we can: with a point.  This point, a, [Figure 14] is conceived to move in a direction w,  developing the line a b. This line next moves in a direction at right  angles to w, namely, x, a distance equal to its length, forming  the square a b c d. Now for the square to develop into a cube by a  movement into the third dimension it would have to move in a direction  at right angles to both w and x, that is, out of the plane of the  paper--away from it altogether, either up or down. This is not  possible, of course, but the third direction can be _represented_ on  the plane of the paper.    [Illustration: Figure 14. TWO PROJECTIONS OF THE HYPERCUBE OR  TESSERACT, AND THEIR TRANSLATION INTO ORNAMENT.]      Let us represent it as diagonally downward toward the right, namely,  y. In the y direction, then, and at a distance equal to the length  of one of the sides of the square, another square is drawn, a'b'c'd',  representing the original square at the end of its movement into the  third dimension; and because in that movement the bounding points of  the square have traced out lines (edges), it is necessary to connect  the corresponding corners of the two squares by means of lines. This  completes the figure and achieves the representation of a cube on a  plane by a perfectly simple and familiar process. Its six faces  are easily identified by the eye, though only two of them appear as  squares owing to the"]]]
