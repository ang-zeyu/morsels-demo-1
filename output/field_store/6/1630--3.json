If, when you enter a drawing-room, your name has been wrongly  announced, or has passed unheard in the buzz of conversation, make  your way at once to the mistress of the house, if you are a stranger,  and introduce yourself by name. This should be done with the greatest  simplicity, and your professional or titular rank made as little of as  possible.    An introduction given at a ball for the mere purpose of conducting a  lady through a dance does not give the gentleman any right to bow to  her on a future occasion. If he commits this error, he must remember  that she is not bound to see, or return, his salutation.           *       *       *       *       *    II.--LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION.      Do not lightly give or promise letters of introduction. Always  remember that when you give a letter of introduction you lay yourself  under an obligation to the friend to whom it is addressed. If he lives  in a great city, such as Paris or London, you in a measure compel  him to undergo the penalty of escorting the stranger to some of those  places of public entertainment in which the capital abounds. In any  case, you put him to the expense of inviting the stranger to his  table. We cannot be too cautious how we tax the time and purse of a  friend, or weigh too seriously the question of mutual advantage in the  introduction. Always ask yourself whether the person introduced will  be an acceptable acquaintance to the one to whom you present him; and  whether the pleasure of knowing him will compensate for the time or  money which it costs to entertain him. If the stranger is in any way  unsuitable in habits or temperament, you inflict an annoyance on  your friend instead of a pleasure. In questions of introduction never  oblige one friend to the discomfort of another.    Those to whom letters of introduction have been given should send them  to the person to whom they are addressed, and enclose a card. Never  deliver a letter of introduction in person. It places you in the most  undignified position imaginable, and compels you to wait while it is  being read, like a footman who has been told to wait for an answer.  There is also another reason why you should not be yourself the bearer  of your introduction; i.e., you compel the other person to receive  you, whether he chooses or not. It may be that he is sufficiently  ill-bred to take no notice of the letter when sent, and in such case,  if you presented yourself with it, he would most probably receive you  with rudeness. It is, at all events, more polite on your part to give  him the option, and perhaps more pleasant. If the receiver of the  letter be a really well-bred person, he will call upon you or leave  his card the next day, and you should return his attentions within the  week.    If, on the other hand, a stranger sends you a letter of introduction  and his card, you are bound by the laws of politeness and hospitality,  not only to call upon him the next day, but to follow up that  attention with others. If you are in a position to do so, the most  correct proceeding is to invite him to dine with you. Should this not  be within your power, you have probably the _entree_ to some private  collections, clubhouses, theatres, or reading-rooms, and could devote  a few hours to showing him these places. If you are but a clerk in  a bank, remember that only to go over the Bank of England would be  interesting to a foreigner or provincial visitor. In short, etiquette  demands that you shall exert yourself to show kindness to the  stranger, if only out of compliment to the friend who introduced him  to you.    If you invite him to dine with you, it is a better compliment to ask  some others to meet him, than to dine with him _tete-a-tete_. You are  thereby giving him an opportunity of making other acquaintances, and  are assisting your friend in still further promoting the purpose for  which he gave him the introduction to yourself.    Be careful at the same time only to ask such persons as he will feel  are at least his own social equals.    A letter of introduction should be given unsealed, not alone because  your friend may wish to know what you have said of him, but also as  a guarantee of your own good faith. As you should never give such  a letter unless you can speak highly of the bearer, this rule of  etiquette is easy to observe. By requesting your friend to fasten the  envelope before forwarding the letter to its destination, you tacitly  give him permission to inspect its contents.    Let your note paper be of the best quality and the proper size. Albert  or Queen's size is the best for these purposes.    It has been well said that \"attention to the punctilios of politeness  is a proof at once of self-respect, and of respect for your friend.\"  Though irksome at first, these trifles soon cease to be matters for  memory, and become things of mere habit. To the thoroughly well-bred,  they are a second nature. Let no one neglect them who is desirous of  pleasing in society; and, above all, let no one deem them unworthy of  a wise man's attention. They are precisely the trifles which do  most to make social intercourse agreeable, and a knowledge of which  distinguishes the gentleman from the boor.           *       *       *       *       *    III.--VISITING.--MORNING CALLS.--CARDS.      A morning visit should be paid between the hours of two and four p.m.,  in winter, and two and five in summer. By observing this rule  you avoid intruding before the luncheon is removed, and leave in  sufficient time to allow the lady of the house an hour or two of  leisure for her dinner toilette.    Be careful always to avoid luncheon hours when you pay morning  visits. Some ladies dine with their children at half-past one, and are  consequently unprepared for the early reception of visitors. When you  have once ascertained this to be the case, be careful never again to  intrude at the same hour.    A good memory for these trifles is one of the hall-marks of good  breeding.    Visits of ceremony should be short. If even the conversation  should have become animated, beware of letting your call exceed  half-an-hour's length. It is always better to let your friends regret  than desire your withdrawal.    On returning visits of ceremony you may, without impoliteness, leave  your card at the door without going in. Do not fail, however, to  inquire if the family be well.    Should there be daughters or sisters residing with the lady upon whom  you call, you may turn down a corner of your card, to signify that the  visit is paid to all. It is in better taste, however, to leave cards  for each.    Unless when returning thanks for \"kind inquiries,\" or announcing your  arrival in, or departure from, town, it is not considered respectful  to send round cards by a servant.    Leave-taking cards have P.P.C. _(pour prendre conge)_ written in the  corner. Some use P.D.A. _(pour dire adieu)_.    It is not the fashion on the Continent for gentlemen to affix  _Monsieur_ to their cards, _Jules Achard_, or _Paolo Beni_, looks more  simple and elegant than if preceded by _Monsieur_, or _Monsieur le  Comte_. Some English gentlemen have adopted this good custom, and it  would be well if it became general.    Autographic facsimiles for visiting cards are affectations in any  persons but those who are personally remarkable for talent and whose  autographs, or facsimiles of them, would be prized as curiosities. A  card bearing the autographic signature of Charles Dickens or George  Cruikshank, though only a lithographic facsimile, would have a certain  interest; whereas the signature of John Smith would be not only  valueless, but would make the owner ridiculous.    The visiting cards of gentlemen are half the size of those used by  ladies.    Visits of condolence are paid within the week after the event which  occasions them. Personal visits of this kind are made by relations  and very intimate friends only. Acquaintances should leave cards with  narrow mourning borders.    On the first occasion when you are received by the family after the  death of one of its members, it is etiquette to wear slight mourning.    When a gentleman makes a morning call, he should never leave his hat  or riding-whip in the hall, but should take both into the room. To do  otherwise would be to make himself too much at home. The hat, however,  must never be laid on a table, piano, or any article of furniture; it  should be held gracefully in the hand. If you are compelled to lay it  aside, put it on the floor.    Umbrellas should invariably be left in the hall.    Never take favourite dogs into a drawing-room when you make a morning  call. Their feet may be dusty, or they may bark at the sight of  strangers, or, being of too friendly a disposition, may take the  liberty of lying on a lady's gown, or jumping on the sofas and easy  chairs. Where your friend has a favourite cat already established  before the fire, a battle may ensue, and one or other of the pets be  seriously hurt. Besides, many persons have a constitutional  antipathy to dogs, and others never allow their own to be seen in the  sitting-rooms. For all or any of these reasons, a visitor has no  right to inflict upon his friend the society of his dog as well as of  himself.    If, when you call upon a lady, you meet a lady visitor in her  drawing-room, you should rise when that lady takes her leave, and  escort her to her carriage, taking care, however, to return again to  the drawing-room, though it be only for a few minutes, before taking  your own leave. Not to do this would give you the appearance of  accompanying the lady visitor; or might, at all events, look as if the  society of your hostess were insufficient to entertain you when her  friend had departed.    If other visitors are announced, and you have already remained as long  as courtesy requires, wait till they are seated, and then rise from  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12428"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#10)"],[1," Then let me speak, nor take that freedom ill.    E'en from _my_ tongue some heart-felt truths may fall,    And outrag'd Nature claims the care of all.    My tale in _any_ place would force a tear,    But calls for stronger, deeper feelings here;    For whilst I tread the free-born British land,    Whilst now before me crowded Britons stand,--    Vain, vain that glorious privilege to me,    I am a slave, where all things else are free.      \"Yet was I born, as you are, no man's slave,    An heir to all that lib'ral Nature gave;    My mind can reason, and my limbs can move    The same as yours; like yours my heart can love;    Alike my body food and sleep sustain;    And e'en like yours--feels pleasure, want, and pain.    One sun rolls o'er us, common skies surround;    One globe supports us, and one grave must bound.      \"Why then am I devoid of all to live    That manly comforts to a man can give?    To live--untaught religion's soothing balm,    Or life's choice arts; to live--unknown the calm    Of soft domestic ease; those sweets of life,    The duteous offspring, and th' endearing wife?      \"To live--to property and rights unknown,    Not e'en the common benefits my own!    No arm to guard me from Oppression's rod,    My will subservient to a tyrant's nod!    No gentle hand, when life is in decay,    To soothe my pains, and charm my cares away;    But helpless left to quit the horrid stage,    Harass'd in youth, and desolate in age!      \"But I was born in Afric's tawny strand,    And you in fair Britannia's fairer land.    Comes freedom, then, from colour?--Blush with shame!    And let strong Nature's crimson mark your blame.    I speak to Britons.--Britons, then, behold    A man by Britons _snar'd_, and _seiz'd_, and _sold_!    And yet no British statute damns the deed,    Nor do the more than murd'rous villains bleed.      \"O sons of freedom! equalize your laws,    Be all consistent, plead the Negro's cause;    That all the nations in your code may see    The British Negro, like the Briton, free.    But, should he supplicate your laws in vain,    To break, for ever, this disgraceful chain,    At least, let gentle usage so abate    The galling terrors of its passing state,    That he may share kind Heav'n's all social plan;    For, though no Briton, Mungo is--a man.\"    I may now add, that few theatrical pieces had a greater run than the  Padlock; and that this epilogue, which was attached to it soon after it  came out, procured a good deal of feeling for the unfortunate sufferers,  whose cause it was intended to serve.    Another coadjutor, to whom these cruel and wicked practices gave birth, was  Thomas Day, the celebrated author of Sandford and Merton, and whose virtues  were well known among those who had the happiness of his friendship. In the  year 1773 he published a poem, which he wrote expressly in behalf of the  oppressed Africans. He gave it the name of The Dying Negro. The preface to  it was written in an able manner by his friend counsellor Bicknell, who is  therefore to be ranked among the coadjutors in this great cause. The poem  was founded on a simple fact, which had taken place a year or two before. A  poor Negro had been seized in London, and forcibly put on board a ship,  where he destroyed himself, rather than return to the land of slavery. To  the poem is affixed a frontispiece, in which the Negro is represented. He  is made to stand in an attitude of the most earnest address to Heaven, in  the course of which, with the fatal dagger in his hand, he breaks forth in  the following words:      \"To you this unpolluted blood I poor,    To you that spirit, which ye gave, restore.\"    This poem, which was the first ever written expressly on the subject, was  read extensively; and it added to the sympathy in favour of suffering  humanity, which was now beginning to show itself in the kingdom.    About this time the first edition of the Essay on Truth made its appearance  in the world. Dr. Beattie took an opportunity, in this work, of vindicating  the intellectual powers of the Africans from the aspersions of Hume, and of  condemning their slavery as a barbarous piece of policy, and as  inconsistent with the free and generous spirit of the British nation.    In the year 1774, John Wesley, the celebrated divine, to whose pious  labours the religious world will be long indebted, undertook the cause of  the poor Africans. He had been in America, and had seen and pitied their  hard condition. The work which he gave to the world in consequence, was  entitled Thoughts on Slavery. Mr. Wesley had this great cause much at  heart, and frequently recommended it to the support of those who attended  his useful ministry.    In the year 1776, the abbe Proyart brought out, at Paris, his History of  Loango, and other kingdoms in Africa, in which he did ample justice to the  moral and intellectual character of the natives there.    The same year produced two new friends in England, in the same cause, but  in a line in which no one had yet moved. David Hartley, then a member of  parliament for Hull, and the son of Dr. Hartley who wrote the Essay on Man,  found it impossible any longer to pass over without notice the case of the  oppressed Africans. He had long felt for their wretched condition, and,  availing himself of his legislative situation, he made a motion in the  house of commons, \"That the Slave-trade was contrary to the laws of God,  and the rights of men.\" In order that he might interest the members as much  as possible in his motion, he had previously obtained some of the chains in  use in this cruel traffic, and had laid them upon the table of the house of  commons. His motion was seconded by that great patriot and philanthropist,  sir George Saville. But though I am now to state that it failed, I cannot  but consider it as a matter of pleasing reflection, that this great subject  was first introduced into parliament by those who were worthy of it; by  those who had clean hands and irreproachable characters, and to whom no  motive of party or faction could be imputed, but only such as must have  arisen from a love of justice, a true feeling of humanity, and a proper  sense of religion.    About this time two others, men of great talents and learning, promoted the  cause of the injured Africans, by the manner in which they introduced them  to notice in their respective works.    Dr. Adam Smith, in his Theory of Moral Sentiments, had, so early as the  year 1759, held them up in an honourable, and their tyrants in a degrading  light. \"There is not a Negro from the coast of Africa, who does not, in  this respect, possess a degree of magnanimity, which the soul of his sordid  master is too often scarce capable of conceiving. Fortune never exerted  more cruelly her empire over mankind, than when she subjected those nations  of heroes to the refuse of the gaols of Europe, to wretches who possess the  virtue neither of the countries they came from, nor of those they go to,  and whose levity, brutality, and baseness so justly expose them to the  contempt of the vanquished.\" And now, in 1770, in his Wealth of Nations, he  showed in a forcible manner (for he appealed to the interest of those  concerned) the dearness of African labour, or the impolicy of employing  slaves.    Professor Millar, in his Origin of Ranks, followed Dr. Smith on the same  ground. He explained the impolicy of slavery in general, by its bad effects  upon industry, population, and morals. These effects he attached to the  system of agriculture as followed in our islands. He showed, besides, how  little pains were taken, or how few contrivances were thought of, to ease  the labourers there. He contended, that the Africans ought to be better  treated, and to be raised to a better condition; and he ridiculed the  inconsistency of those who held them in bondage. \"It affords,\" says he, \"a  curious spectacle to observe that the same people, who talk in a high  strain of political liberty, and who consider the privilege of imposing  their own taxes as one of the unalienable rights of mankind, should make no  scruple of reducing a great proportion of their fellow-creatures into  circumstances, by which they are not only deprived of property, but almost  of every species of right. Fortune perhaps never produced a situation more  calculated to ridicule a liberal hypothesis, or to show how little the  conduct of men is at the bottom directed by any philosophical principles.\"  It is a great honour to the university of Glasgow, that it should have  produced, before any public agitation of this question, three  professors[A], all of whom bore their public testimony against the  continuance of the cruel trade.    [Footnote A: The other was professor Hutcheson, before mentioned in p. 49.]    From this time, or from about the year 1776, to about the year 1782, I am  to put down three other coadjutors, whose labours seem to have come in a  right season for the promotion of the cause.    The first of these was Dr. Robertson. In his History of America, he laid  open many facts relative to this subject. He showed himself a warm friend  both of the Indians and Africans. He lost no opportunity of condemning that  trade which brought the latter into bondage: \"a trade,\" says he, \"which is  no less repugnant to the feelings of humanity than to the principles of  religion.\" And in his Charles the Fifth, he showed in a manner that was  clear, and never to be controverted, that Christianity was the great cause  in the twelfth century of extirpating slavery from the West of Europe. By  the establishment of this fact, he rendered important services to the  oppressed Africans. For if Christianity, when it began to be felt in the  heart, dictated the abolition of slavery, it certainly became those who  lived in a Christian country, and who professed the Christian religion, to  put an end to this cruel trade.    The second was the abbe Raynal. This author gave an "]]]
