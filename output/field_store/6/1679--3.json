[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13482"],[0,"What the Schools Teach and Might Teach (#10)"],[1," trend of relating the science  teaching to practical labors. What is needed is a wider expansion of  this phase of the work without losing sight of the need at the same  time for a systematic and general teaching of the sciences. It is a  difficult task to make the science teaching vital and modern for  the academic high schools, since they have so few contacts with the  practical labors of the world. Cleveland needs to see its schools  more as a part of the world of affairs, and not so much as a hothouse  nursery isolated from the world and its vital interests.          PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE      Teaching in matters pertaining to health is given but a meagre amount  of time in the elementary schools. While the school program shows one  15-minute period each week in the first four grades, and one 30-minute  period each week in the four upper grades, it appears that in actual  practice the subject receives even less time than this. In the attempt  to observe the class work in physiology and hygiene, a member of the  Survey staff went on one day to four different classrooms at the hour  scheduled on the program. In two cases the time was given over to  grammar, in one to arithmetic, and in one to music. This represents  practice that is not unusual. The subject gets pushed off the program  by one of the so-called \"essentials.\" It is difficult to see why  health-training is not an essential. In a letter to the School Board,  February 8, 1915, Superintendent Frederick wrote:    \"The teaching of physiology and hygiene should become a matter  of serious moment in our course of study. At present it is not  systematically presented in the elementary schools: and in the high  schools it is an elective study only in the senior year. My judgment  is that it should become a definite part of the program, as a required  study in the seventh and eighth grades.\"    The small nominal amount of time as compared with the time usually  expended is partially shown in Table 12. Professor Holmes' figures for  the 50 cities include elementary science along with the physiology and  hygiene.

In his report to the Board, 1913, Dr. Peterson writes:    \"Health instruction is given by doctors and nurses in personal talks  to pupils, talks to whole schools, tooth-brush drills conducted in  many schools, and in visits into the homes by the nurses. Conscious  effort is continually made by all doctors and nurses to inspire to  right living all of the children with whom they come in contact.\"    Looking somewhat to the future, it can be affirmed that the school  physicians and nurses are the ones who ought to give the teaching in  this subject. After giving the preliminary ideas in the classrooms,  they alone are in position to follow up the various matters and see  that the ideas are assimilated through being put into practice both at  school and at home. At present, however, 16 physicians and 27 nurses  have 75,000 children to inspect, of whom more than half have defects  that require following up. It is a physical impossibility for them  to do much teaching until the force of school nurses is greatly  increased.    For the present certain things may well be done:    1. A course in hygiene and sanitation, based upon an abundance of  reading, should be drawn up and taught by the regular teachers in the  grammar school grades. This course should be looked upon as merely  preliminary to the more substantial portions of education in this  field. The physicians and nurses should select the readings  and supervise the course to see that the materials are covered  conscientiously and not slighted.    2. The schools should arrange for practical applications of the  preparatory knowledge in as many ways as possible. Children in relays  can look after the ventilation, temperature, humidity, dust, light,  and other sanitary conditions of school-rooms and grounds. They can  make sanitary surveys of their home district; engage in anti-fly,  anti-mosquito, anti-dirt, and other campaigns; and report--for credit  possibly--practical sanitary and hygienic activities carried on  outside of school. Only as knowledge is put to work is it assimilated  and the prime purpose of education accomplished.    3. The corps of school nurses should be gradually enlarged, and after  a time they can be given any needed training for teaching that will  enable them, as the work is departmentalized in the grammar grades,  to become departmental teachers in this subject for a portion of  their time. Their \"follow-up\" work will always give them their chief  educational opportunity; but to prepare for this the classwork must  give some systematized preparatory ideas.    In the high schools, training of boys in hygiene and sanitation is  little developed. The only thing offered them is an elective half-year  course in physiology in the senior year of the scientific and English  courses in the academic high schools. In the classical course, and  in the technical and commercial schools, they have not even this.  Physiology is required of girls in the technical schools, and is  elective in all but the classical course in the others. While in one  or two of the high schools there is training in actual hygiene  and sanitation, in most cases it is physiology and anatomy of a  superficial preliminary type which is not put to use and which  therefore mostly fails of normal assimilation.    The things recommended for the elementary schools need to be carried  out in the high schools also.          PHYSICAL TRAINING      The city gives slightly more than the usual amount of time to physical  training in the elementary schools. Except for first and second  grades, where a slightly larger amount is set aside for the purpose,  pupils are expected to receive one hour per week.

A week consists of 168 hours. After deducting  12 hours a day for sleep, meals, etc., there remain 84 hours per week  to be used. In a state of nature this was largely used for physical  play. Under the artificial conditions of modern city life, the nature  of children is not changed. They still need huge amounts of active  physical play for wholesome development. Most of this they will get  away from the school, but as urban conditions take away proper  play opportunities, the loss in large degree has to be made good  by systematic community effort in establishing and maintaining  playgrounds and playrooms for 12 months in the year. The school and  its immediate environment is the logical place for this development.    The course of study lays out a series of obsolescent Swedish  gymnastics for each of the years. The work observed was mechanical,  perfunctory, and lacking in vitality. Sandwiched in between exhausting  intellectual drill, it has the value of giving a little relief and  rest. This is good, but it is not sufficiently positive to be called  physical training.    Very desirable improvements in the course are being advocated by the  directors and supervisors of the work. They are recommending, and  introducing where conditions will permit, the use of games, athletics,  folk dances, etc. The movements should be promoted by the city in  every possible way. At present the regular teachers as a rule have not  the necessary point of view and do not sufficiently value the work.  Special teachers and play leaders need to be employed. Material  facilities should be extended and improved. Some of the school grounds  are too small; the surfacing is not always well adapted to play;  often apparatus is not supplied; indoor playrooms are insufficient  in number, etc. These various things need to be supplied before the  physical training curriculum can be modernized.    In the high schools two periods of physical training per week in  academic and commercial schools, and three or four periods per week"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13486"],[0,"The Story of Sigurd the Volsung (#10)"],[1,"said, \"I am ready; and what is the deed to win?\"    He said: \"We shall drive the horses adown to the water-side,    That cometh forth from the mountains, and note what next shall betide.\"      Then the twain sped on together, and they drave the horses on    Till they came to a rushing river, a water wide and wan;    And the white mews hovered o'er it; but none might hear their cry    For the rush and the rattle of waters, as the downlong flood swept by.    So the whole herd took the river and strove the stream to stem,    And many a brave steed was there; but the flood o'ermastered them:    And some, it swept them down-ward, and some won back to bank,    Some, caught by the net of the eddies, in the swirling hubbub sank;    But one of all swam over, and they saw his mane of grey    Toss over the flowery meadows, a bright thing far away:    Wide then he wheeled about them, then took the stream again    And with the waves' white horses mingled his cloudy mane.      Then spake the elder of days: \"Hearken now, Sigurd, and hear;    Time was when I gave thy father a gift thou shalt yet deem dear,    And this horse is a gift of my giving:--heed nought where thou mayst ride:    For I have seen thy fathers in a shining house abide,    And on earth they thought of its threshold, and the gifts I had to give;    Nor prayed for a little longer, and a little longer to live.\"      Then forth he strode to the mountains, and fain was Sigurd now.    To ask him many a matter: but dim did his bright shape grow,    As a man from the litten doorway fades into the dusk of night;    And the sun in the high-noon shone, and the world was exceeding bright.      So Sigurd turned to the river and stood by the wave-wet strand,    And the grey horse swims to his feet and lightly leaps aland,    And the youngling looks upon him, and deems none beside him good.    And indeed, as tells the story, he was come of Sleipnir's blood,    The tireless horse of Odin: cloud-grey he was of hue,    And it seemed as Sigurd backed him that Sigmund's son he knew,    So glad he went beneath him. Then the youngling's song arose    As he brushed through the noontide blossoms of Gripir's mighty close,    Then he singeth the song of Greyfell, the horse that Odin gave,    Who swam through the sweeping river, and back through the toppling wave.      _Regin telleth Sigurd of his kindred, and of the Gold that was  accursed from ancient days._      Now yet the days pass over, and more than words may tell    Grows Sigurd strong and lovely, and all children love him well.    But oft he looks on the mountains and many a time is fain    To know of what lies beyond them, and learn of the wide world's gain.           *       *       *       *       *      Now again it happed on a day that he sat in Regin's hall    And hearkened many tidings of what had chanced to fall,    And of kings that sought their kingdoms o'er many a waste and wild,    And at last saith the crafty master:                                       \"Thou art King Sigmund's child:    Wilt thou wait till these kings of the carles shall die in a little land,    Or wilt thou serve their sons and carry the cup to their hand;    Or abide in vain for the day that never shall come about,    When their banners shall dance in the wind and shake to the war-gods'         shout?\"      Then Sigurd answered and said: \"Nought such do I look to be.    But thou, a deedless man, too much thou eggest me:    And these folk are good and trusty, and the land is lovely and sweet,    And in rest and in peace it lieth as the floor of Odin's feet:    Yet I know that the world is wide, and filled with deeds unwrought;    And for e'en such work was I fashioned, lest the songcraft come to nought.\"           *       *       *       *       *      Then answered Regin the guileful: \"The deed is ready to hand,    Yet holding my peace is the best, for well thou lovest the land;    And thou lovest thy life moreover, and the peace of thy youthful days,    And why should the full-fed feaster his hand to the rye-bread raise?    Yet they say that Sigmund begat thee and he looked to fashion a man.    Fear nought; he lieth quiet in his mound by the sea-waves wan.\"      So shone the eyes of Sigurd, that the shield against him hung    Cast back their light as the sunbeams; but his voice to the roof-tree rung:    \"Tell me, thou Master of Masters, what deed is the deed I shall do?    Nor mock thou the son of Sigmund lest the day of his birth thou rue.\"      Then answered the Master of Sleight: \"The deed is the righting of wrong,    And the quelling a bale and a sorrow that the world hath endured o'erlong,    And the winning a treasure untold, that shall make thee more than the kings;    Thereof is the Helm of Aweing, the wonder of earthly things,    And thereof is its very fellow, the War-Coat all of gold,    That has not its like in the heavens, nor has earth of its fellow told.\"      Then answered Sigurd the Volsung: \"How long hereof hast thou known?    And what unto thee is this treasure, that thou seemest to give as thine         own?\"      \"Alas!\" quoth the smithying master, \"it is mine, yet none of mine,    Since my heart herein avails not, and my hand is frail and fine--    It is long since I first came hither to seek a man for my need;    For I saw by a glimmering light that hence would spring the deed,    And many a deed of the world: but the generations passed,    And the first of the days was as near to the end that I sought as the last;    Till I looked on thine eyes in the cradle: and now I deem through thee,    That the end of my days of waiting, and the end of my woes shall be.\"      Then Sigurd awhile was silent; but at last he answered and said:    \"Thou shalt have thy will and the treasure, and shalt take the curse on         thine head    If a curse the gold enwrappeth: but the deed will I surely do,    For today the dreams of my childhood hath bloomed in my heart anew:    And I long to look on the world and the glory of the earth    And to deal in the dealings of men, and garner the harvest of worth.    But tell me, thou Master of Masters, where lieth this measureless wealth;    Is it guarded by swords of the earl-folk, or kept by cunning and stealth?    Is it over the main sea's darkness, or beyond the mountain wall?    Or e'en in these peaceful acres anigh to the hands of all?\"      Then Regin answered sweetly: \"Hereof must a tale be told:    Bide sitting, thou son of Sigmund, on the heap of unwrought gold,    And hearken of wondrous matters, and of things unheard, unsaid,    And deeds of my beholding ere the first of Kings was made.      \"And first ye shall know of a sooth, that I never was born of the race    Which the masters of God-home have made to cover the fair earth's face;    But I come of the Dwarfs departed; and fair was the earth whileome    Ere the short-lived thralls of the Gods amidst its dales were come.           *       *       *       *       *      \"It was Reidmar the Ancient begat me; and now was he waxen old,    And a covetous man and a king; and he bade, and I built him a hall,    And a golden glorious house; and thereto his sons did he call,    And he bade them be evil and wise, that his will through them might be         wrought.    Then he gave unto Fafnir my brother the soul that feareth nought,    And the brow of the hardened iron, and the hand that may never fail,    And the greedy heart of a king, and the ear that hears no wail.      \"But next unto Otter my brother he gave the snare and the net,    And the longing to wend through the wild-wood, and wade the highways wet:    And the foot that never resteth, while aught be left alive    That hath cunning to match man's cunning or might with his might to strive.      \"And to me, the least and the youngest, what gift for the slaying of ease?    Save the grief that remembers the past, and the fear that the future sees;    And the hammer and fashioning-iron, and the living coal of fire;    And the craft that createth a semblance, and fails of the heart's desire;    And the toil that each dawning quickens and the task that is never done;    And the heart that longeth ever, nor will look to the deed that is won.      \"Thus gave my father the gifts that might never be taken again;    Far worse were we now than the Gods, and but little better than men.    But yet of our ancient might one thing had we left us still:    We had craft to change our semblance, and could shift us at our will    Into bodies of the beast-kind, or fowl, or fishes cold;           *       *       *       *       *      \"So dwelt we, brethren and father; and Fafnir my brother fared    As the scourge and compeller of all things, and left no wrong undared;    But for me, I toiled and I toiled; and fair grew my father's house;    But writhen and foul were the hands that had made it glorious;           *       *       *       *       *      \"And myself a little fragment amidst it all I saw,    Grim, cold-hearted, and unmighty as the tempest-driven straw.    --Let be.--For Otter my brother saw seldom field or fold,    And he oftenest used that custom, whereof e'en now I told,    And would shift his shape with the wood-beasts and the things of land and         sea;    And he knew what joy their hearts had, and what they longed to be,    And their dim-eyed understanding, and his wood-craft waxed so great,    That he seemed the king of the creatures and their very mortal fate.      \"Now as the years won over three folk of the heavenly halls    Grew aweary of sleepless sloth, and the day that nought befalls;    And they fain would look on the earth, and their latest handiwork,    And turn the fine gold over, lest a flaw therein should lurk.
