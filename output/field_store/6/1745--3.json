Yet,  though all was thus in order, the bird did not eat nor drink, nor did  he bathe. With his back to Battersea, and his head sunk deep between  his little sloping shoulders, he watched the fire. The windows had for  a while been opened, as usual, to air the room for him; and the fire  had not yet mitigated the chill. It was not his custom to bathe at so  inclement an hour; and his appetite for food and drink, less keen than  it had once been, required to be whetted by example--he never broke  his fast before his master and mistress broke theirs. Time had been  when, for sheer joy in life, he fluttered from perch to perch, though  there were none to watch him, and even sang roulades, though there  were none to hear. He would not do these things nowadays save at  the fond instigation of Mr. and Mrs. Adrian Berridge. The housemaid  who ministered to his cage, the parlourmaid who laid the Berridges'  breakfast table, sometimes tried to incite him to perform for their  own pleasure. But the sense of caste, strong in his protuberant little  bosom, steeled him against these advances.    While the breakfast-table was being laid, he heard a faint tap against  the window-pane. Turning round, he perceived on the sill a creature  like to himself, but very different--a creature who, despite the  pretensions of a red waistcoat in the worst possible taste, belonged  evidently to the ranks of the outcast and the disinherited. In  previous winters the sill had been strewn every morning with  bread-crumbs. This winter, no bread-crumbs had been vouchsafed; and  the canary, though he did not exactly understand why this was so,  was glad that so it was. He had felt that his poor relations took  advantage of the Berridges' kindness. Two or three of them, as  pensioners, might not have been amiss. But they came in swarms,  and they gobbled their food in a disgusting fashion, not trifling  coquettishly with it as birds should. The reason for this, the canary  knew, was that they were hungry; and of that he was sorry. He hated  to think how much destitution there was in the world; and he could  not help thinking about it when samples of it were thrust under  his notice. That was the principal reason why he was glad that the  window-sill was strewn no more and seldom visited.    He would much rather not have seen this solitary applicant. The two  eyes fixed on his made him feel very uncomfortable. And yet, for fear  of seeming to be outfaced, he did not like to look away.    The subdued clangour of the gong, sounded for breakfast, gave him an  excuse for turning suddenly round and watching the door of the room.    A few moments later there came to him a faint odour of Harris tweed,  followed immediately by the short, somewhat stout figure of his  master--a man whose mild, fresh, pink, round face seemed to find  salvation, as it were, at the last moment, in a neatly-pointed auburn  beard.    Adrian Berridge paused on the threshold, as was his wont, with closed  eyes and dilated nostrils, enjoying the aroma of complex freshness  which the dining-room had at this hour. Pathetically a creature of  habit, he liked to savour the various scents, sweet or acrid, that  went to symbolise for him the time and the place. Here were the  immediate scents of dry toast, of China tea of napery fresh from  the wash, together with that vague, super-subtle scent which boiled  eggs give out through their unbroken shells. And as a permanent base  to these there was the scent of much-polished Chippendale, and of  bees'-waxed parquet, and of Persian rugs. To-day, moreover, crowning  the composition, there was the delicate pungency of the holly that  topped the Queen Anne mirror and the Mantegna prints.    Coming forward into the room, Mr. Berridge greeted the canary.  \"Well, Amber, old fellow,\" he said, \"a happy Christmas to you!\"  Affectionately he pushed the tip of a plump white finger between the  bars. \"Tweet!\" he added.    \"Tweet!\" answered the bird, hopping to and fro along his perch.    \"Quite an old-fashioned Christmas, Amber!\" said Mr. Berridge, turning  to scan the weather. At sight of the robin, a little spasm of pain  contracted his face. A shine of tears came to his prominent pale eyes,  and he turned quickly away. Just at that moment, heralded by a slight  fragrance of old lace and of that peculiar, almost unseizable odour  that uncut turquoises have, Mrs. Berridge appeared.    \"What is the matter, Adrian?\" she asked quickly. She glanced sideways  into the Queen Anne mirror, her hand fluttering, like a pale moth, to  her hair, which she always wore braided in a fashion she had derived  from Pollaiuolo's St. Ursula.    \"Nothing, Jacynth--nothing,\" he answered with a lightness that carried  no conviction; and he made behind his back a gesture to frighten away  the robin.    \"Amber isn't unwell, is he?\" She came quickly to the cage. Amber  executed for her a roulade of great sweetness. His voice had not  perhaps the fullness for which it had been noted in earlier years;  but the art with which he managed it was as exquisite as ever. It was  clear to his audience that the veteran artist was hale and hearty.    But Jacynth, relieved on one point, had a misgiving on another. \"This  groundsel doesn't look very fresh, does it?\" she murmured, withdrawing  the sprig from the bars. She rang the bell, and when the servant came  in answer to it said, \"Oh Jenny, will you please bring up another  piece of groundsel for Master Amber? I don't think this one is quite  fresh.\"    This formal way of naming the canary to the servants always jarred on  her principles and on those of her husband. They tried to regard their  servants as essentially equals of themselves, and lately had given  Jenny strict orders to leave off calling them \"Sir\" and \"Ma'am,\" and  to call them simply \"Adrian\" and \"Jacynth.\" But Jenny, after one or  two efforts that ended in faint giggles, had reverted to the crude  old nomenclature--as much to the relief as to the mortification of the  Berridges. They did, it is true, discuss the possibility of redressing  the balance by calling the parlourmaid \"Miss.\" But, when it came to  the point, their lips refused this office. And conversely their lips  persisted in the social prefix to the bird's name.    Somehow that anomaly seemed to them symbolic of their lives. Both of  them yearned so wistfully to live always in accordance to the nature  of things. And this, they felt, ought surely to be the line of least  resistance. In the immense difficulties it presented, and in their  constant failures to surmount these difficulties, they often wondered  whether the nature of things might not be, after all, something other  than what they thought it. Again and again it seemed to be in as  direct conflict with duty as with inclination; so that they were  driven to wonder also whether what they conceived to be duty were  not also a mirage--a marsh-light leading them on to disaster.    The fresh groundsel was brought in while Jacynth was pouring out the  tea. She rose and took it to the cage; and it was then that she too  saw the robin, still fluttering on the sill. With a quick instinct she  knew that Adrian had seen it--knew what had brought that look to his  face. She went and, bending over him, laid a hand on his shoulder.  The disturbance of her touch caused the tweed to give out a tremendous  volume of scent, making her feel a little dizzy.    \"Adrian,\" she faltered, \"mightn't we for once--it is Christmas  Day--mightn't we, just to-day, sprinkle some bread-crumbs?\"    He rose from the table, and leaned against the mantelpiece, looking  down at the fire. She watched him tensely. At length, \"Oh Jacynth,\" he  groaned, \"don't--don't tempt me.\"    \"But surely, dear, surely--\"    \"Jacynth, don't you remember that long talk we had last winter, after  the annual meeting of the Feathered Friends' League, and how we agreed  that those sporadic doles could do no real good--must even degrade the  birds who received them--and that we had no right to meddle in what  ought to be done by collective action of the State?\"    \"Yes, and--oh my dear, I do still agree, with all my heart. But if the  State will do nothing--nothing--\"    \"It won't, it daren't, go on doing nothing, unless we encourage it to  do so. Don't you see, Jacynth, it is just because so many people take  it on themselves to feed a few birds here and there that the State  feels it can afford to shirk the responsibility?\"    \"All that is fearfully true. But just now--Adrian, the look in that  robin's eyes--\"    Berridge covered his own eyes, as though to blot out from his mind the  memory of that look. But Jacynth was not silenced. She felt herself  dragged on by her sense of duty to savour, and to make her husband  savour, the full bitterness that the situation could yield for  them both. \"Adrian,\" she said, \"a fearful thought came to me.  Suppose--suppose it had been Amber!\"    Even before he shuddered at the thought, he raised his finger to his  lips, glancing round at the cage. It was clear that Amber had not  overheard Jacynth's remark, for he threw back his head and uttered one  of his blithest trills. Adrian, thus relieved, was free to shudder at  the thought just suggested.    \"Sometimes,\" murmured Jacynth, \"I wonder if we, holding the views we  hold, are justified in keeping Amber.\"    \"Ah, dear, we took him in our individualistic days. We cannot  repudiate him now. It wouldn't be fair. Besides, you see, he isn't  here on a basis of mere charity. He's not a parasite, but an artist.  He gives us of his art.\"    \"Yes, dear, I know. But you remember our doubts about the position of  artists in the community--whether the State ought to sanction them at  all.\"    \"True. But we cannot visit those doubts on our old friend yonder, can  we, dear? At the same time, I admit that when--when--Jacynth, if  ever anything happens to Amber, we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14668"],[0,"McGuffey's Second Eclectic Reader (#10)"],[1,"hill, to the field where the horse was grazing.    10. The moment Fanny heard the rustle of Jenny's dress, she pricked up her  ears, snorted, and, with head erect, seemed ready to bound away again.    [Illustration: Girl leading horse.]    11. \"Fanny! O Fanny!\" called Jenny, and the beautiful creature turned her  head. That gentle tone she well knew, and, glad to see her friend, she  carne directly to the fence, and rubbed her head on the girl's shoulder.  As soon as the gate was opened, she followed Jenny to the barn.    12. The men had treated her roughly, and she remembered it. But she knew  and loved the voice that was always kind, and the hand that often fed and  caressed her. She gave love for love, and willing service for kindness.

The bell had rung, and the  children had run out into the bright sunshine, wild with laughter and fun.      2. All but poor Davy. He came out last and very slowly, but he did not  laugh. He was in trouble, and the bright, golden sunlight did not make him  glad.    3. He walked across the yard, and sat down on a stone behind the old  maple. A little bird on the highest branch sang just to make him laugh.    4. But Davy did not notice it. He was thinking of the cruel words that had  been said about his ragged clothes. The tears stole out of his eyes, and  ran down his cheeks.    [Illustration: Boy sitting alone under tree in schoolyard. Other children  playing in background.]    5. Poor Davy had no father, and his mother had to work hard to keep him at  school.    6. That night, he went home by the path that led across the fields and  through the woods. He still felt sad.    7. Davy did not wish to trouble his mother; so he lingered a while among  the trees, and at last threw himself on the green moss under them.    [Illustration: Woman talking to boy.]    8. Just then his teacher came along. She saw who it was, and stopped,  saying kindly, \"What is the matter, Davy?\"    9. He did not speak, but the tears began again to start.    10. \"Won't you tell me? Perhaps I can help you.\"    11. Then he told her all his trouble.  When he ended, she said, cheerily,  \"I have a plan, Davy, that I think will help you.\"    12. \"Oh, what is it?\" he said, sitting up with a look of hope, while a  tear fell upon a blue violet.    l3. \"Well, how would you like to be a little flower merchant?\"    14. \"And earn money?\" said Davy. \"That would be jolly. But where shall I  get my flowers?\"    15. \"Right in these woods, and in the fields,\" said his teacher. \" Here  are lovely blue violets, down by the brook are white ones, and among the  rocks are ferns and mosses. Bring them all to my house, and I will help  you arrange them.\"    16. So, day after day, Davy hunted the woods for the prettiest flowers,  and the most dainty ferns and mosses. After his teacher had helped to  arrange them, he took them to the city that was near, and sold them.    17. He soon earned money enough to buy new clothes. Now the sunshine and  the bird's songs make him glad.        LESSON LXVI.    deep    flour     dough      mill'er     wheth'er    cook    a far'    dust'y     cra'dles    grind'ing    glow    doth      val'ley    reap'ers    a-knead'ing      ALICE'S SUPPER.                     1.  Far down in the valley the wheat grows deep,  And the reapers are making the cradles sweep;  And this is the song that I hear them sing,  While cheery and loud their voices ring:  \"'Tis the finest wheat that ever did grow!  And it is for Alice's supper--ho! ho!\"                       2.  Far down by the river the old mill stands,  And the miller is rubbing his dusty hands;  And these are the words of the miller's lay,  As he watches the millstones grinding away:  \"'Tis the finest flour that money can buy,  And it is for Alice's supper--hi! hi!\"                       3.  Downstairs in the kitchen the fire doth glow,  And cook is a-kneading the soft, white dough;  And this is the song she is singing to-day,  As merry and busy she's working away:  \"'Tis the finest dough, whether near or afar,  And it is for Alice's supper--ha! ha!\"    [Illustration: Mother serving supper to small girl seated at table.]                       4.  To the nursery now comes mother, at last,  And what in her hand is she bringing so fast?  'Tis a plateful of something, all yellow and white,  And she sings as she comes, with her smile so bright:  \"'Tis the best bread and butter I ever did see,  And it is for Alice's supper--he! he!\"        LESSON LXVII.    tall    hung      storm       pick'et    firs    north     gowns       spar'ked    roof    flakes    fair'ies    cap'tains      A SNOWSTORM.    1. Last night, the cold north wind blew great snow clouds over the sky.  Not a star, not a bit of blue sky could be seen.    2. Soon the tiny flakes floated softly down, like flocks of little white  birds. Faster and faster they came, till they filled the air. They made no  noise, but they were busy all night long.    3. They covered all the ground with a soft, white carpet. They hung  beautiful plumes on the tall, green firs. The little bushes, they put to  sleep in warm nightgowns and caps.    [Illustration: Snow covering house, shed, and road. Children playing.]    4. They hid the paths so that the boys might have the fun of digging new  ones. They turned the old picket fence into a row of soldiers, and the  gate posts into captains, with tall white hats on.    5. The old corn basket that was left out by the barn, upside down, they  made into a cunning little snow house with a round roof.    6. When the busy little flakes had done their work, the sun came up to see  what they had been about.    7. He must have been pleased with what he saw, for he smiled such a  bright, sweet smile, that the whole white world sparkled as if it were  made of little stars.    8. Who would have thought that the black clouds could hide the little  fairies that made the earth so beautiful!    LESSON LXVIII.    dug      roots     thump       of fense'    toad     spool     heaped      smoothed    forth    a'pron    clos'ets    dan'de li ons      BESSIE.    1. One day, Bessie thought how nice it would be to have a garden with only  wild flowers in it. So into the house she ran to find her Aunt Annie, and  ask her leave to go over on the shady hillside, across the brook, where  the wild flowers grew thickest.    [Illustration: Girl planting small garden. Toad sitting in garden.]    2. \" Yes, indeed, you may go,\" said Aunt Annie; \"but what will you put the  roots and earth in while you are making the garden?\"    3. \"Oh,\" said Bessie, \"I can take my apron.\"    4. Her aunt laughed, and said, \"A basket will be better, I think.\" So they  looked in the closets and the attic, everywhere; but some of the baskets  were full, and some broken; not one could they find that would do.    5. Then Aunt Annie turned out the spools and the bags from a nice large  workbasket, and gave that to Bessie. \"You may have this for your own,\" she  said, \"to fill with earth, or flowers, or anything you like.\"    6. \"Oh I thank you,\" said Bessie, and she danced away through the garden.  She slipped through the gate, out into the field all starred with  dandelions, down in the hollow by the brook, then up on the hillside out  of sight among the shady trees.    7. How she worked that afternoon! She heaped up the dark, rich earth, and  smoothed it over with her hands. Then she dug up violets, and  spring-beauties, and other flowers,--running back and forth, singing all  the while.    8. The squirrels peeped out of their holes at Bessie. The birds sang in  the branches overhead. Thump, came something all at once into the middle  of the bed. Bessie jumped and upset the basket, and away it rolled down  the hill.    9. How Bessie laughed when she saw a big, brown toad winking his bright  eyes at her, as if he would say, \"No offense, I hope.\"    10. Just then Bessie heard a bell ringing loudly. She knew it was calling  her home; but how could she leave her basket? She must look for that  first.    11. \"Waiting, waiting, waiting,\" all at once sang a bird out of sight  among the branches; \"waiting, Bessie.\"    12. \"Sure enough,\" said Bessie; \"perhaps I'm making dear mother or auntie  wait; and they are so good to me. I'd better let the basket wait. Take  care of it, birdie; and don't jump on my flowers, Mr. Toad.\"        LESSON LXIX.    visit    soaked    o be'di ent    ru'ined    [Illustration: Girl on couch looking out window.]      BESSIE.  (CONCLUDED.)    1. She was back at the house in a few minutes, calling, \"Mother! mother!  auntie! Who wants me?\"    2. \"I, dear,\" said her mother. \"I am going away for a long visit, and if  you had not come at once, I could not have said good-by to my little  girl.\"    3. Then Bessie's mother kissed her, and told her to obey her kind aunt  while she was gone.    4. The next morning, Bessie waked to find it raining hard. She went into  her aunt's room with a very sad face. \"O auntie! this old rain!\"    5, \"This new, fresh, beautiful rain, Bessie! How it will make our flowers  grow, and what a good time we can have together in the house!\"    6. \"I know it, auntie; but you will think me so careless!\"    7. \"To let it rain?\"    8. \"No; don't laugh, Aunt Annie; to leave your nice basket out of doors  all night; and now it will be soaked and ruined in this--this--beautiful  rain.\" Bessie did not look as if the beautiful rain made her very happy.    9. \"You must be more careful, dear, another time,\" said her aunt, gently.  \"But come, tell me all about it.\"    10. So Bessie crept very close to her auntie's side, and told her of her  happy time the day before; of the squirrel, and the toad, and how the  basket rolled away down the hill; and then how the bell rang, and she  could not stop to find the basket.
