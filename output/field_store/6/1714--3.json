On this side the women  forced them back as far as the temple of the Eumenides, but on the other  side those who assailed them from the temple of Pallas, Ardettus, and  the Lyceum, drove their right wing in confusion back to their camp with  great slaughter. In the fourth month of the war a peace was brought  about by Hippolyte; for this writer names the wife of Theseus Hippolyte,  not Antiope. Some relate that she was slain fighting by the side of  Theseus by a javelin hurled by one Molpadia, and that the column which  stands beside the temple of Olympian Earth is sacred to her memory. It  is not to be wondered at that history should be at fault when dealing  with such ancient events as these, for there is another story at  variance with this, to the effect that Antiope caused the wounded  Amazons to be secretly transported to Chalkis, where they were taken  care of, and some of them were buried there, at what is now called the  Amazoneum. However, it is a proof of the war having ended in a treaty of  peace, that the place near the temple of Theseus where they swore to  observe it, is still called Horeomosium, and that the sacrifice to the  Amazons always has taken place before the festival of Theseus. The  people of Megara also show a burying-place of the Amazons, as one goes  from the market-place to what they call Rhus, where the lozenge-shaped  building stands. It is said that some others died at Chaeronea, and were  buried by the little stream which it seems was anciently called  Thermodon, but now is called Haemon, about which we have treated in the  life of Demosthenes. It would appear that the Amazons did not even get  across Thessaly without trouble, for graves of them are shown to this  day at Skotussa and Kynoskephalae.    XXVIII. The above is all that is worthy of mention about the Amazons;  for, as to the story which the author of the 'Theseid' relates about  this attack of the Amazons being brought about by Antiope to revenge  herself upon Theseus for his marriage with Phaedra, and how she and her  Amazons fought, and how Herakles slew them, all this is clearly  fabulous. After the death of Antiope, Theseus married Phaedra, having a  son by Antiope named Hippolytus, or Demophoon, according to Pindar. As  for his misfortunes with this wife and son, as the account given by  historians does not differ from that which appears in the plays of the  tragic poets, we must believe them to have happened as all these writers  say.    XXIX. However, there are certain other legends about Theseus' marriage  which have never appeared on the stage, which have neither a creditable  beginning nor a prosperous termination: for it is said that he carried  off one Anaxo, a Troezenian girl, and after slaying Sinis and Kerkyon he  forced their daughters, and that he married Periboea the mother of Ajax  and also Phereboea and Iope the daughter of Iphikles: and, as has been  told already, it was on account of his love for Aegle the daughter of  Panopeus that he deserted Ariadne, which was a shameful and  discreditable action. And in addition to all this he is charged with  carrying off Helen, which brought war upon Attica, and exile and  destruction on himself; about which we shall speak presently. But,  though many adventures were undertaken by the heroes of those times,  Herodorus is of opinion that Theseus took no part in any of them, except  with the Lapithae in their fight with the Centaurs; though other writers  say that he went to Kolchis with Jason and took part with Meleager in  the hunt of the Kalydonian boar.    From these legends arises the proverb, \"Not without Theseus;\" also he by  himself without any comrades performed many glorious deeds, from which  the saying came into vogue, \"This is another Herakles.\"    Theseus, together with Adrastus, effected the recovery of the bodies of  those who fell under the walls of the Cadmea at Thebes, not after  conquering the Thebans, as Euripides puts it in his play, but by a truce  and convention, according to most writers. Philochorus even states that  this was the first occasion on which a truce was made for the recovery  of those slain in battle. But we have shown in our 'Life of Herakles'  that he was the first to restore the corpses of the slain to the enemy.  The tombs of the rank and file are to be seen at Eleutherae, but those  of the chiefs at Eleusis, by favour of Theseus to Adrastus. Euripides's  play of the 'Suppliants' is contradicted by that of Aeschylus, the  'Eleusinians,' in which Theseus is introduced giving orders for this to  be done.    XXX. His friendship for Peirithous is said to have arisen in the  following manner: He had a great reputation for strength and courage;  Peirithous, wishing to make trial of these, drove his cattle away from  the plain of Marathon, and when he learned that Theseus was pursuing  them, armed, he did not retire, but turned and faced him. Each man then  admiring the beauty and courage of his opponent, refrained from battle,  and first Peirithous holding out his hand bade Theseus himself assess  the damages of his raid upon the cattle, saying that he himself would  willingly submit to whatever penalty the other might inflict. Theseus  thought no more of their quarrel, and invited him to become his friend  and comrade; and they ratified their compact of friendship by an oath.  Hereupon, Peirithous, who was about to marry Deidameia, begged Theseus  to come and visit his country and meet the Lapithae. He also had invited  the Centaurs to the banquet; and as they in their drunken insolence laid  hands upon the women, the Lapithae attacked them. Some of them they  slew, and the rest they overcame, and afterwards, with the assistance of  Theseus, banished from their country. Herodorus, however, says that this  is not how these events took place, but that the war was going on, and  that Theseus went to help the Lapithae and while on his way thither  first beheld Herakles, whom he made a point of visiting at Trachis,  where he was resting after his labours and wanderings; and that they met  with many compliments and much good feeling on both sides. But one would  more incline to those writers who tell us that they often met, and that  Herakles was initiated by Theseus's desire, and was also purified before  initiation at his instance, which ceremony was necessary because of some  reckless action.    XXXI. Theseus was fifty years old, according to Hellanikus, when he  carried off Helen, who was a mere child. For this reason some who wish  to clear him of this, the heaviest of all the charges against him, say  that it was not he who carried off Helen, but that Idas and Lynkeus  carried her off and deposited her in his keeping. Afterwards the Twin  Brethren came and demanded her back, but he would not give her up; or  even it is said that Tyndareus himself handed her over to him, because  he feared that Enarsphorus the son of Hippocoon would take her by force,  she being only a child at the time. But the most probable story and that  which most writers agree in is the following: The two friends, Theseus  and Peirithous, came to Sparta, seized the maiden, who was dancing in  the temple of Artemis Orthia, and carried her off. As the pursuers  followed no farther than Tegea, they felt no alarm, but leisurely  travelled through Peloponnesus, and made a compact that whichever of  them should win Helen by lot was to have her to wife, but must help the  other to a marriage. They cast lots on this understanding, and Theseus  won. As the maiden was not yet ripe for marriage he took her with him to  Aphidnae, and there placing his mother with her gave her into the charge  of his friend Aphidnus, bidding him watch over her and keep her presence  secret. He himself in order to repay his obligation to Peirithous went  on a journey with him to Epirus to obtain the daughter of Aidoneus the  king of the Molossians, who called his wife Persephone, his daughter  Kore, and his dog Cerberus. All the suitors of his daughter were bidden  by him to fight this dog, and the victor was to receive her hand.  However, as he learned that Peirithous and his friend were come, not as  wooers, but as ravishers, he cast them into prison. He put an end to  Peirithous at once, by means of his dog, but only guarded Theseus  strictly.    XXXII. Now at this period Mnestheus, the son of Peteus, who was the son  of Orneus, who was the son of Erechtheus, first of all mankind they say  took to the arts of a demagogue, and to currying favour with the people.  This man formed a league of the nobles, who had long borne Theseus a  grudge for having destroyed the local jurisdiction and privileges of  each of the Eupatrids by collecting them all together into the capital,  where they were no more than his subjects and slaves; and he also  excited the common people by telling them that although they were  enjoying a fancied freedom they really had been deprived of their  ancestral privileges and sacred rites, and made to endure the rule of  one foreign despot, instead of that of many good kings of their own  blood.    While he was thus busily employed, the invasion of Attica by the sons of  Tyndareus greatly assisted his revolutionary scheme; so that some say  that it was he who invited them to come. At first they abstained from  violence, and confined themselves to asking that their sister Helen  should be given up to them; but when they were told by the citizens that  she was not in their hands, and that they knew not where she was, they  proceeded to warlike measures. Akademus, who had by some means  discovered that she was concealed at Aphidnae, now told them where she  was; for which cause he was honoured by the sons of Tyndareus during his  life, and also the Lacedaemonians, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14056"],[0,"The French Impressionists (1860-1900) (#10)"],[1,"style; it  states profoundly the facts of life, it condenses a little the human  soul: and this will suffice to secure for Degas an important place in  his epoch, a little apart from Impressionism. Without noise, and through  the sheer charm of his originality, he has contributed his share towards  undermining the false doctrines of academic art before the painters, as  Manet has undermined them before the public.    [Illustration: CLAUDE MONET    AN INTERIOR, AFTER DINNER]          V    CLAUDE MONET: HIS WORK, HIS INFLUENCE      With Claude Monet we enter upon Impressionism in its most significant  technical expression, and touch upon the principal points referred to in  the second chapter of this book.    Claude Monet, the artistic descendant of Claude Lorrain, Turner, and  Monticelli, has had the merit and the originality of opening a new road  to landscape painting by deducing scientific statements from the study  of the laws of light. His work is a magnificent verification of the  optical discoveries made by Helmholtz and Chevreul. It is born  spontaneously from the artist's vision, and happens to be a rigorous  demonstration of principles which the painter has probably never cared  to know. Through the power of his faculties the artist has happened to  join hands with the scientist. His work supplies not only the very  basis of the Impressionist movement proper, but of all that has followed  it and will follow it in the study of the so-called chromatic laws. It  will serve to give, so to say, a mathematic necessity to the happy finds  met by the artists hitherto, and it will also serve to endow decorative  art and mural painting with a process, the applications of which are  manyfold and splendid.    I have already summed up the ideas which follow from Claude Monet's  painting more clearly even than from Manet's. Suppression of local  colour, study of reflections by means of complementary colours and  division of tones by the process of touches of pure, juxtaposed  colours--these are the essential principles of _chromatism_ (for this  word should be used instead of the very vague term \"Impressionism\").  Claude Monet has applied them systematically, especially in landscape  painting.    There are a few portraits of his, which show that he might have made an  excellent figure painter, if landscape had not absorbed him entirely.  One of these portraits, a large full-length of a lady with a fur-lined  jacket and a satin dress with green and black stripes, would in itself  be sufficient to save from oblivion the man who has painted it. But the  study of light upon the figure has been the special preoccupation of  Manet, Renoir, and Pissarro, and, after the Impressionists, of the great  lyricist, Albert Besnard, who has concentrated the Impressionist  qualities by placing them at the service of a very personal conception  of symbolistic art. Monet commenced with trying to find his way by  painting figures, then landscapes and principally sea pictures and boats  in harbours, with a somewhat sombre robustness and very broad and solid  draughtsmanship. His first luminous studies date back to about 1885.  Obedient to the same ideas as Degas he had to avoid the Salons and only  show his pictures gradually in private galleries. For years he remained  unknown. It is only giving M. Durand-Ruel his due, to state that he was  one of the first to anticipate the Impressionist school and to buy the  first works of these painters, who were treated as madmen and  charlatans. He has become great with them, and has made his fortune and  theirs through having had confidence in them, and no fortune has been  better deserved. Thirty years ago nobody would have bought pictures by  Degas or Monet, which are sold to-day for a thousand pounds. This detail  is only mentioned to show the evolution of Impressionism as regards  public opinion.    [Illustration: CLAUDE MONET    THE HARBOUR, HONFLEUR]    So much has Monet been attracted by the analysis of the laws of light  that he has made light the real subject of all his pictures, and to show  clearly his intention he has treated one and the same site in a series  of pictures painted from nature at all hours of the day. This is the  principle whose results are the great divisions of his work which might  be called \"Investigation of the variations of sunlight.\" The most famous  of these series are the _Hay-ricks_, the _Poplars_, the _Cliffs of  Etretat_, the _Golfe Juan_, the _Coins de Riviere_, the _Cathedrals_,  the _Water-lilies_, and finally the _Thames_ series which Monet is at  present engaged upon. They are like great poems, and the splendour of  the chosen theme, the orchestration of the shivers of brightness, the  symphonic _parti-pris_ of the colours, make their realism, the minute  contemplation of reality, approach idealism and lyric dreaming.    Monet paints these series from nature. He is said to take with him in a  carriage at sunrise some twenty canvases which he changes from hour to  hour, taking them up again the next day. He notes, for example, from  nine to ten o'clock the most subtle effects of sunlight upon a hay-rick;  at ten o'clock he passes on to another canvas and recommences the study  until eleven o'clock. Thus he follows step by step the modifications of  the atmosphere until nightfall, and finishes simultaneously the works of  the whole series. He has painted a hay-stack in a field twenty times  over, and the twenty hay-stacks are all different. He exhibits them  together, and one can follow, led by the magic of his brush, the history  of light playing upon one and the same object. It is a dazzling display  of luminous atoms, a kind of pantheistic evocation. Light is certainly  the essential personage who devours the outlines of the objects, and is  thrown like a translucent veil between our eyes and matter. One can see  the vibrations of the waves of the solar spectrum, drawn by the  arabesque of the spots of the seven prismatic hues juxtaposed with  infinite subtlety; and this vibration is that of heat, of atmospheric  vitality. The silhouettes melt into the sky; the shadows are lights  where certain tones, the blue, the purple, the green and the orange,  predominate, and it is the proportional quantity of the spots that  differentiates in our eyes the shadows from what we call the lights,  just as it actually happens in optic science. There are some midday  scenes by Claude Monet, where every material silhouette--tree, hay-rick,  or rock--is annihilated, volatilised in the fiery vibration of the dust  of sunlight, and before which the beholder gets really blinded, just as  he would in actual sunlight. Sometimes even there are no more shadows at  all, nothing that could serve to indicate the values and to create  contrasts of colours. Everything is light, and the painter seems easily  to overcome those terrible difficulties, lights upon lights, thanks to a  gift of marvellous subtlety of sight.    [Illustration: CLAUDE MONET    THE CHURCH AT VARENGEVILLE]    Generally he finds a very simple _motif_ sufficient; a hay-rick, some  slender trunks rising skywards, or a cluster of shrubs. But he also  proves himself as powerful draughtsman when he attacks themes of greater  complexity. Nobody knows as he does how to place a rock amidst  tumultuous waves, how to make one understand the enormous construction  of a cliff which fills the whole canvas, how to give the sensation of a  cluster of pines bent by the wind, how to throw a bridge across a river,  or how to express the massiveness of the soil under a summer sun. All  this is constructed with breadth, truth and force under the delicious or  fiery symphony of the luminous atoms. The most unexpected tones play in  the foliage. On close inspection we are astonished to find it striped  with orange, red, blue and yellow touches, but seen at a certain  distance the freshness of the green foliage appears to be represented  with infallible truth. The eye recomposes what the brush has  dissociated, and one finds oneself perplexed at all the science, all the  secret order which has presided over this accumulation of spots which  seem projected in a furious shower. It is a veritable orchestral piece,  where every colour is an instrument with a distinct part, and where the  hours with their different tints represent the successive themes. Monet  is the equal of the greatest landscape painters as regards the  comprehension of the true character of every soil he has studied, which  is the supreme quality of his art. Though absorbed beyond all by study  of the sunlight, he has thought it useless to go to Morocco or Algeria.  He has found Brittany, Holland, the _Ile de France_, the _Cote d'Azur_  and England sufficient sources of inspiration for his symphonies, which  cover from end to end the scale of perceptible colours. He has  expressed, for instance, the mild and vaporous softness of the  Mediterranean, the luxuriant vegetation of the gardens of Cannes and  Antibes, with a truthfulness and knowledge of the psychology of land and  water which can only be properly appreciated by those who live in this  enchanted region. This has not prevented him from understanding better  than anybody the wildness, the grand austereness of the rocks of  _Belle-Isle en mer_, to express it in pictures in which one really feels  the wind, the spray, and the roaring of the heavy waters breaking  against the impassibility of the granite rocks. His recent series of  _Water-lilies_ expressed all the melancholic and fresh charm of quiet  basins, of sweet bits of water blocked by rushes and calyxes. He has  painted underwoods in the autumn, where the most subtle shades of  bronze and gold are at play, chrysanthemums, pheasants, roofs at  twilight, dazzling sunflowers, gardens, tulip-fields in Holland,  bouquets, effects of snow and hoar frost of exquisite softness, and  sailing boats passing in the sun. He has painted some views of the"]]]
