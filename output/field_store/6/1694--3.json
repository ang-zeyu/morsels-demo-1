There are great oceans of each surrounding the \"I\" as it  moves along.    It is well for you also to bear in mind the Universality of Life. All of  the Universe is alive, vibrating and pulsating with life and energy and  motion. There is nothing dead in the Universe. Life is everywhere, and  always accompanied by intelligence. There is no such thing as a dead,  unintelligent Universe. _Instead of being atoms of Life floating in a sea  of death, we are atoms of Life surrounded by an ocean of Life, pulsating,  moving, thinking, living._ Every atom of what we call Matter is alive. It  has energy or force with it, and is always accompanied by intelligence  and life. Look around us as we will--at the animal world--at the plant  world--yes, even at the world of minerals and we see life, life,  life--all alive and having intelligence. When we are able to bring this  conception into the realm of actual consciousness--when we are able not  only to intellectually accept this fact, but to even go still further and  _feel_ and be conscious of this Universal Life on all sides, then are we  well on the road to attaining the Cosmic Consciousness.    But all these things are but steps leading up to the realization of  the Oneness in Spirit, on the part of the Individual. Gradually there  dawns upon him the realization that there is a Unity in the manifestation  of Spirit from the Absolute--a unity with itself, and a Union with the  Absolute. All this manifestation of Spirit on the part of the  Absolute--all this begetting of Divine Children--was in the nature of a  single act rather than as a series of acts, if we may be permitted  to speak of the manifestation as an _act_. Each Ego is a Centre of  Consciousness in this great ocean of Spirit--each is a Real Self,  apparently separate from the others and from its source, but the  separation is only apparent in both cases, for there is the closest  bond of union between the Egos of the Universe of Universes--each is knit  to the other in the closest bond of union, and each is still attached to  the Absolute by spiritual filaments, if we may use the term. In time we  shall grow more conscious of this mutual relationship, as the sheaths are  outgrown and cast aside, and in the end we will be withdrawn into the  Absolute--shall return to the Mansion of the Father.    It is of the highest importance to the developing soul to unfold into a  realization of this relationship and unity, _for when this conception is  once fully established the soul is enabled to rise above certain of the  lower planes, and is free from the operation of certain laws that bind  the undeveloped soul_. Therefore the Yogi teachers are constantly leading  the Candidates toward this goal. First by this path, and then by that  one, giving them different glimpses of the desired point, until finally  the student finds a path best fitted for his feet, and he moves along  straight to the mark, and throwing aside the confining bonds that have  proved so irksome, he cries aloud for joy at his new found Freedom.    The following exercises and Mental Drills are intended to aid the  Candidate in his work of growing into a realization of his relationship  with the Whole of Life and Being.      MENTAL DRILL.    (1) Read over what we have said in the \"Advanced Course\" regarding  the principle known as Matter. Realize that all Matter is One at the  last--that the real underlying substance of Matter is _Akasa_ or  Ether, and that all the varying forms evident to our senses are but  modifications and grosser forms of that underlying principle. Realize  that by known chemical processes all forms of Matter known to us, or  rather all combinations resulting in \"forms,\" may be resolved into their  original elements, and that these elements are merely _Akasa_ in  different states of vibration. Let the idea of the Oneness of the visible  Universe sink deeply into your mind, until it becomes fixed there. The  erroneous conception of diversity in the material world must be replaced  by the consciousness of Unity--Oneness, at the last, in spite of the  appearance of variety and manifold forms. You must grow to see behind the  world of forms of Matter, and see the great principle of Matter (_Akasa_  or Ether) back of, within, and under it all. You must grow to _feel_  this, as well as to intellectually see it.    (2) Meditate over the last mentioned truths, and then follow the matter  still further. Read what we have said in the \"Advanced Course\" (Lesson  XI) about the last analysis of Matter showing it fading away into Force  or Energy until the dividing line is lost, and Matter merges into Energy  or Force, showing them both to be but the same thing, Matter being a  grosser form of Energy or Force. This idea should be impressed upon the  understanding, in order that the complete edifice of the Knowing of the  Oneness may be complete in all of its parts.    (3) Then read in the \"Advanced Lessons\" about Energy or Force, in the  oneness underlying its various manifestations. Consider how one form of  Energy may be transformed into another, and so on around the circle, the  one principle producing the entire chain of appearances. Realize that the  energy within you by which you move and act, is but one of the forms of  this great Principle of Energy with which the Universe is filled, and  that you may draw to you the required Energy from the great Universal  supply. But above all endeavor to grasp the idea of the Oneness pervading  the world of Energy or Force, or Motion. See it in its entirety, rather  than in its apparent separateness. These steps may appear somewhat  tedious and useless, but take our word for it, they are all helps in  fitting the mind to grasp the idea of the Oneness of All. Each step is  important, and renders the next higher one more easily attained. In this  mental drill, it will be well to mentally picture the Universe in  perpetual motion--everything is in motion--all matter is moving and  changing its forms, and manifesting the Energy within it. Suns and worlds  rush through space, their particles constantly changing and moving.  Chemical composition and decomposition is constant and unceasing,  everywhere the work of building up and breaking down is going on. New  combinations of atoms and worlds are constantly being formed and  dissolved. And after considering this Oneness of the principle of Energy,  reflect that through all these changes of form the Ego--the Real  Self--YOU--stand unchanged and unharmed--Eternal, Invincible,  Indestructible, Invulnerable, _Real_ and Constant among this changing  world of forms and force. You are above it all, and it revolves around  and about you--Spirit.    (4) Read what we have said in the \"Advanced Course\" about Force or  Energy, shading into Mind-substance which is its parent. Realize that  Mind is back of all this great exhibition of Energy and Force that you  have been considering. Then will you be ready to consider the Oneness of  Mind.    (5) Read what we have said in the \"Advanced Lessons\" about  Mind-substance. Realize that there is a great world of Mind-substance,  or an Universal Mind, which is at the disposal of the Ego. All Thought is  the product of the Ego's use of this Mind-substance, its tool and  instrument. Realize that this Ocean of Mind is entire and Whole, and that  the Ego may draw freely from it. Realize that _You_ have this great ocean  of Mind at your command, when you unfold sufficiently to use it. Realize  that Mind is back of and underneath all of the world of form and names  and action, and that in that sense: \"All is Mind,\" although still higher  in the scale than even Mind are _You_, the Real Self, the Ego, the  Manifestation of the Absolute.    (6) Realize your identity with and relationship to All of Life. Look  around you at Life in all its forms, from the lowest to the highest, all  being exhibitions of the great principle of Life in operation along  different stages of The Path. Scorn not the humblest forms, but look  behind the form and see the reality--Life. Feel yourself a part of the  great Universal Life. Let your thought sink to the depths of the ocean,  and realize your kinship with the Life back of the forms dwelling there.  Do not confound the forms (often hideous from your personal point of  view) with the principle behind them. Look at the plant-life, and the  animal life, and seek to see behind the veil of form into the real Life  behind and underneath the form. Learn to feel your Life throbbing and  thrilling with the Life Principle in these other forms, and in the forms  of those of your own race. Gaze into the starry skies and see there the  numerous suns and worlds, all peopled with life in some of its myriad  forms, and feel your kinship to it. If you can grasp this thought and  consciousness, you will find yourself at-one-ment with those whirling  worlds, and, instead of feeling small and insignificant by comparison,  you will be conscious of an expansion of Self, until you feel that in  those circling worlds is a part of yourself--that You are there also,  while standing upon the Earth--that you are akin to all parts of the  Universe--nay, more, that they are as much your home as is the spot upon  which you are standing. You will find sweeping upon you a sense of  consciousness that the Universe is your home--not merely a part of it, as  you had previously thought. You will experience a sense of greatness, and  broadness and grandness such as you have never dreamed of. You will begin  to realize at least a part of your Divine inheritance, and to know indeed  that you are a Child of the Infinite, the very essence of your Divine  Parent being in the fibres of your being, At such times of realization  one becomes conscious of what lies before the soul in its upward path,  and how"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1366"],[0,"The Cloister and the Hearth (#10)"],[1,"the village and tell my father here  is a friend of his.\"    \"And not of yours?\"    \"My father's friends are mine.\"    \"That is doubtful. It was not like a friend to promise to wait for me,  and then make off the moment my back was turned. Cruel Margaret you  little know how I searched the town for you; how for want of you nothing  was pleasant to me.\"    \"These are idle words; if you had desired my father's company, or mine,  you would have come back. There I had a bed laid for you, sir, at my  cousin's, and he would have made much of you, and, who knows, I might  have made much of you too. I was in the humour that day. You will  not catch me in the same mind again, neither you nor any young man, I  warrant me.\"    \"Margaret, I came back the moment the Countess let me go; but you were  not there.\"    \"Nay, you did not, or you had seen Hans Cloterman at our table; we left  him to bring you on.\"    \"I saw no one there, but only a drunken man, that had just tumbled  down.\"    \"At our table? How was he clad?\"    \"Nay, I took little heed: in sad-coloured garb.\"    At this Margaret's face gradually warmed; but presently, assuming  incredulity and severity, she put many shrewd questions, all of which  Gerard answered most loyally. Finally, the clouds cleared, and they  guessed how the misunderstanding had come about. Then came a revulsion  of tenderness, all the more powerful that they had done each other  wrong; and then, more dangerous still, came mutual confessions. Neither  had been happy since; neither ever would have been happy but for this  fortunate meeting.    And Gerard found a MS. Vulgate lying open on the table, and pounced upon  it like a hawk. MSS. were his delight; but before he could get to it two  white hands quickly came flat upon the page, and a red face over them.    \"Nay, take away your hands, Margaret, that I may see where you are  reading, and I will read there too at home; so shall my soul meet yours  in the sacred page. You will not? Nay, then I must kiss them away.\" And  he kissed them so often, that for very shame they were fain to withdraw,  and, lo! the sacred book lay open at,    \"An apple of gold in a network of silver.\"    \"There, now,\" said she, \"I had been hunting for it ever so long,  and found it but even now--and to be caught!\" and with a touch of  inconsistency she pointed it out to Gerard with her white finger.    \"Ay,\" said he, \"but to-day it is all hidden in that great cap.\"    \"It is a comely cap, I'm told by some.\"    \"Maybe; but what it hides is beautiful.\"    \"It is not: it is hideous.\"    \"Well, it was beautiful at Rotterdam.\"    \"Ay, everything was beautiful that day\" (with a little sigh).    And now Peter came in, and welcomed Gerard cordially, and would have him  to stay supper. And Margaret disappeared; and Gerard had a nice learned  chat with Peter; and Margaret reappeared with her hair in her silver  net, and shot a glance half arch, half coy, and glided about them, and  spread supper, and beamed bright with gaiety and happiness. And in  the cool evening Gerard coaxed her out, and she objected and came; and  coaxed her on to the road to Tergou, and she declined, and came; and  there they strolled up and down, hand in hand; and when he must go, they  pledged each other never to quarrel or misunderstand one another again;  and they sealed the promise with a long loving kiss, and Gerard went  home on wings.    From that day Gerard spent most of his evenings with Margaret, and the  attachment deepened and deepened on both sides, till the hours they  spent together were the hours they lived; the rest they counted and  underwent. And at the outset of this deep attachment all went smoothly.  Obstacles there were, but they seemed distant and small to the eyes of  hope, youth, and love. The feelings and passions of so many persons,  that this attachment would thwart, gave no warning smoke to show  their volcanic nature and power. The course of true love ran smoothly,  placidly, until it had drawn these two young hearts into its current for  ever.    And then--        CHAPTER VII    One bright morning unwonted velvet shone, unwonted feathers waved, and  horses' hoofs glinted and ran through the streets of Tergou, and the  windows and balconies were studded with wondering faces. The French  ambassador was riding through to sport in the neighbouring forest.    Besides his own suite, he was attended by several servants of the Duke  of Burgundy, lent to do him honour and minister to his pleasure. The  Duke's tumbler rode before him with a grave, sedate majesty, that made  his more noble companions seem light, frivolous persons. But ever and  anon, when respect and awe neared the oppressive, he rolled off his  horse so ignobly and funnily, that even the ambassador was fain' to  burst out laughing. He also climbed up again by the tail in a way  provocative of mirth, and so he played his part. Towards the rear of the  pageant rode one that excited more attention still--the Duke's leopard.  A huntsman, mounted on a Flemish horse of giant prodigious size and  power, carried a long box fastened to the rider's loins by straps  curiously contrived, and on this box sat a bright leopard crouching.  She was chained to the huntsman. The people admired her glossy hide  and spots, and pressed near, and one or two were for feeling her,  and pulling her tail; then the huntsman shouted in a terrible voice,  \"Beware! At Antwerp one did but throw a handful of dust at her, and the  Duke made dust of him.\"    \"Gramercy!\"    \"I speak sooth. The good Duke shut him up in prison, in a cell under  ground, and the rats cleaned the flesh off his bones in a night. Served  him right for molesting the poor thing.\"    There was a murmur of fear, and the Tergovians shrank from tickling the  leopard of their sovereign.    But an incident followed that raised their spirits again. The Duke's  giant, a Hungarian seven feet four inches high, brought up the rear.  This enormous creature had, like some other giants, a treble, fluty  voice of little power. He was a vain fellow, and not conscious of this  nor any defect. Now it happened he caught sight of Giles sitting on the  top of the balcony; so he stopped and began to make fun of him.    \"Hallo! brother!\" squeaked he, \"I had nearly passed without seeing  thee.\"    \"You are plain enough to see,\" bellowed Giles in his bass tones.    \"Come on my shoulder, brother,\" squeaked Titan, and held out a shoulder  of mutton fist to help him down.    \"If I do I'll cuff your ears,\" roared the dwarf.    The giant saw the homuncule was irascible, and played upon him, being  encouraged thereto by the shouts of laughter. For he did not see  that the people were laughing not at his wit, but at the ridiculous  incongruity of the two voices--the gigantic feeble fife, and the petty  deep, loud drum, the mountain delivered of a squeak, and the mole-hill  belching thunder.    The singular duet came to as singular an end. Giles lost all patience  and self-command, and being a creature devoid of fear, and in a rage to  boot, he actually dropped upon the giant's neck, seized his hair with  one hand, and punched his head with the other. The giant's first impulse  was to laugh, but the weight and rapidity of the blows soon corrected  that inclination.    \"He! he! Ah! ha! hallo! oh! oh! Holy saints! here! help! or I must  throttle the imp. I can't! I'll split your skull against the--\" and he  made a wild run backwards at the balcony. Giles saw his danger, seized  the balcony in time with both hands, and whipped over it just as the  giant's head came against it with a stunning crack. The people roared  with laughter and exultation at the address of their little champion.  The indignant giant seized two of the laughers, knocked them together  like dumb-bells, shook them and strewed them flat--Catherine shrieked  and threw her apron over Giles--then strode wrathfully away after the  party. This incident had consequences no one then present foresaw. Its  immediate results were agreeable. The Tergovians turned proud of Giles,  and listened with more affability to his prayers for parchment. For  he drove a regular trade with his brother Gerard in this article. Went  about and begged it gratis, and Gerard gave him coppers for it.    On the afternoon of the same day, Catherine and her daughter were  chatting together about their favourite theme, Gerard, his goodness, his  benefice, and the brightened prospects of the whole family.    Their good luck had come to them in the very shape they would have  chosen; besides the advantages of a benefice such as the Countess  Charolois would not disdain to give, there was the feminine delight  at having a priest, a holy man, in their own family. \"He will marry  Cornelis and Sybrandt: for they can wed (good housewives), now, if they  will. Gerard will take care of you and Giles, when we are gone.\"    \"Yes, mother, and we can confess to him instead of to a stranger,\" said  Kate.    \"Ay, girl! and he can give the sacred oil to your father and me, and  close our eyes when our time comes.\"    \"Oh, mother! not for many, many years, I do pray Heaven. Pray speak not  of that, it always makes me sad. I hope to go before you, mother dear.  No; let us be gay to-day. I am out of pain, mother, quite out of  all pain; it does seem so strange; and I feel so bright and happy,  that--mother, Can you keep a secret?\"    \"Nobody better, child. Why, you know I can.\"    \"Then I will show you something so beautiful. You never saw the like, I  trow. Only Gerard must never know; for sure he means to surprise us with  it; he covers it up so, and sometimes he carries it away altogether.\"    Kate took her crutches, and moved slowly away, leaving her mother in an  exalted state of curiosity. She soon returned with something in a cloth,  uncovered it, and there was a lovely picture of the Virgin, with all her  insignia, and wearing her tiara over a wealth of beautiful hair, which"]]]
