[PRICE 2d.               *       *       *       *       *        HIS MAJESTY'S PONEY PHAETON.    [Illustration]      We commence our tenth volume of the MIRROR with an embellishment quite  novel in design from the generality of our graphic illustrations, but  one which, we flatter ourselves, will excite interest among our friends,  especially after so recently, presenting them with a Portrait and Memoir  of his Majesty in the Supplement, which last week completed our ninth  volume. His Majesty, when residing at his cottage in Windsor Forest, the  weather being favourable, seldom allows a day to pass without taking his  favourite drive by the Long Walk, and Virginia Water, in his poney  phaeton, as represented in the above engraving. Windsor Park being  situated on the south side of the town, and 14 miles in circumference,  is admirably calculated for the enjoyment of a rural ride. The entrance  to the park is by a road called the _Long Walk_, near three miles in  length, through a double plantation of trees on each side, leading to the  Ranger's Lodge: on the north east side of the Castle is the _Little Park_,  about four miles in circumference: _Queen Elizabeth's Walk_ herein is  much frequented. At the entrance of this park is the _Queen's Lodge_,  a modern erection. This building stands on an easy ascent opposite the  upper court, on the south side, and commands a beautiful view of the  surrounding country. The gardens are elegant, and have been much  enlarged by the addition of the gardens and house of the duke of St.  Albans, purchased by his late majesty. The beautiful _Cottage Ornee_, an  engraving of which graces one of our early volumes, is also in the park,  and to which place of retirement his present Majesty resorts, and passes  much of his time in preference to the bustle and splendour of a royal  town life.    Having now given as much description of the engraving as the subject  requires, we shall proceed to lay before our readers some further  anecdotes connected with the life of his Majesty; for our present  purpose, the following interesting article being adapted to our limits,  we shall introduce an        _Original Letter of his present Majesty, when Prince of Wales, to      Alexander Davison, Esq., on the death of Lord Nelson._        I am extremely obliged to you, my dear sir, for your confidential      letter, which I received this morning. You may be well assured,      that, did it depend upon me, there would not be a wish, a desire of      our-ever-to-be-lamented and much-loved friend, as well as adored      hero, that I should not consider as a solemn obligation upon his      friends and his country to fulfil; it is a duty they owe his memory,      and his matchless and unrivalled excellence: such are my sentiments,      and I should hope that there is still in this country sufficient      honour, virtue, and gratitude to prompt us to ratify and to carry      into effect the last dying request of our Nelson, and by that means      proving not only to the whole world, but to future ages, that we      were worthy of having such a man belonging to us. It must be      needless, my dear sir, to discuss over with you in particular the      irreparable loss dear Nelson ever must be, not merely to his friends      but to his country, especially at the present crisis--and during the      present most awful contest, his very name was a host of itself;      Nelson and Victory were one and the same to us, and it carried      dismay and terror to the hearts of our enemies. But the subject is      too painful a one to dwell longer upon; as to myself, all that I can      do, either publicly or privately, to testify the reverence, the      respect I entertain for his memory as a Hero, and as the greatest      public character that ever embellished the page of history,      independent of what I can with the greatest truth term, the      enthusiastic attachment I felt for him as a friend, I consider it as      my duty to fulfil, and therefore, though I may be prevented from      taking that ostensible and prominent situation at his funeral which      I think my birth and high rank entitled me to claim, still nothing      shall prevent me in a private character following his remains to      their last resting place; for though the station and the character      may be less ostensible, less prominent, yet the feelings of the      heart will not therefore be the less poignant, or the less acute.        I am, my dear sir, with the greatest truth,        Ever very sincerely your's,        G. P.[1]        _Brighton, Dec, 18th, 1805_.

(_For the Mirror._)      There is a natural stimulus in man to offer adoration at the shrine of  departed genius.--        \"There is a tear for all that die.\"    But, when a transcendant genius is checked in its early age--when its  spring-shoots had only began to open--when it had just engaged in a new  feature devoted to man, and man to it, we cannot rest        \"In silent admiration, mixed with grief.\"    Too often has splendid genius been suffered to live almost unobserved;  and have only been valued as their lives have been lost. Could the  divine Milton, or the great Shakspeare, while living, have shared that  profound veneration which their after generations have bestowed on their  high talents, happier would they have lived, and died more  extensively beloved.    True, a Byron has but lately paid a universal debt. His concentrated  powers--his breathings for the happiness and liberty of mankind--his  splendid intellectual flowers, culled from a mind stored with the  choicest exotics, and cultivated with the most refined taste are all  still fresh in recollection. As the value of precious stones and metals  have become estimated by their scarcity, so will the fame of Byron live.    A mind like Lord Byron's,        \"----born, not only to surprise, but cheer      With warmth and lustre all within its sphere,\"    was one of Nature's brightest gems, whose splendour (even when  uncompared) dazzled and attracted all who passed within its sight.        \"So let him stand, through ages yet unborn.\"    As comparison is a medium through which we are enabled to obtain most  accurate judgment, let us use it in the present instance, and compare  Lord Byron with the greatest poets that have preceded him, by which  means the world of letters will see what they have _really_ lost in Lord  Byron. To commence with the great Shakspeare himself, to whom universal  admiration continues to be paid. Had Shakspeare been cut off at the same  early period as Byron, _The Tempest, King Lear, Othello, Macbeth, Julius  Caesar, Coriolanus_, and several others of an equal character, would  never have been written. The high reputation of Dryden would also have  been limited--his fame, perhaps, unknown. The _Absalom_ and _Achitophel_  is the earliest of his best productions, which was written about his  fiftieth year; his principal production, at the age of Byron, was his  _Annus Mirabilis_; for nearly the whole of his dramatic works were  written at the latter part of his life. Pope is the like situated; that  which displayed most the power of his mind--which claims for him the  greatest praise--his _Essay on Man_, &c. appeared after his fortieth  year. _Windsor Forest_ was published in his twenty-second or  twenty-third year, both were the labour of some _years_; and the  immortal Milton, who published some few things before his thirtieth  year, sent not his great work, _Paradise Lost_, to the world until he  verged on sixty.    With the poets, and the knowledge of what Byron _was_, we may ask what  he would have been had it pleased the Great Author of all things to  suffer the summer of his consummate mental powers to shine upon us? Take  the works of any of the abovenamed distinguished individuals previous to  their thirty-eighth year, and shall we perceive that flexibility of the  English language to the extent that Byron has left behind him? His  versatility was, indeed, astonishing and triumphant. His _Childe  Harold_, the _Bride of Abydos_, the _Corsair_, and _Don Juan_, (though  somewhat too freely written,) are established proofs of his unequalled  energy of mind. His power was unlimited; not only eloquent, but the  sublime, grave and gay, were all equally familiar to his muse.    Few words are wanted to show that Byron was not depraved at heart; no  man possessed a more ready sympathy, a more generous mind to the  distressed, or was a more enthusiastic admirer of noble actions. These  feelings all strongly delineated in his character, would never admit, as  Sir Walter Scott has observed, \"an imperfect moral sense, nor feeling,  dead to virtue.\" Severe as the        \"Combined usurpers on the throne of taste\"    have been, his character is marked by some of the best principles in  many parts of his writings.        \"The records there of friendships, held like rocks,      And enmities like sun-touch'd snow resign'd,\"    are frequently visible. His glorious attachment to the Grecian cause is  a sufficient recompense for _previous_ follies exaggerated and  propagated by calumny's poisonous tongue. In a word, \"there is scarce a  passion or a situation which has escaped his pen; and he might be drawn,  like Garrick, between the weeping and the laughing muses.\"    A. B.

[PRICE 2d.               *       *       *       *       *        SIR WALTER SCOTT'S LIFE OF NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.    (_Continued from page 5._ [Note: see Mirror 262])      Robespierre was a coward, who signed death-warrants with a hand that  shook, though his heart was relentless. He possessed no passions on  which to charge his crimes; they were perpetrated in cold blood, and  upon mature deliberation.    Marat, the third of this infernal triumvirate, had attracted the  attention of the lower orders, by the violence of his sentiments in the  journal which he conducted from the commencement of the revolution, upon  such principles that it took the lead in forwarding its successive  changes. His political exhortations began and ended like the howl of a  blood-hound for murder; or, if a wolf could have written a journal, the  gaunt and famished wretch could not have ravened more eagerly for  slaughter. It was blood which was Marat's constant demand, not in drops  from the breast of an individual, not in puny streams from the slaughter  of families, but blood in the profusion of an ocean. His usual  calculation of the heads which he demanded amounted to two hundred and  sixty thousand; and though he sometimes raised it as high as three  hundred thousand, it never fell beneath the smaller number. It may be  hoped, and for the honour of human nature we are inclined to believe,  there was a touch of insanity in this unnatural strain of ferocity; and  the wild and squalid features of the wretch appear to have intimated a  degree of alienation of mind. Marat was, like Robespierre, a coward.  Repeatedly denounced in the assembly, he skulked instead of defending  himself, and lay concealed in some obscure garret or cellar among his  cut-throats, until a storm appeared, when, like a bird of ill omen, his  death-screech was again heard. Such was the strange and fatal  triumvirate, in which the same degree of cannibal cruelty existed under  different aspects. Danton murdered to glut his rage; Robespierre to  avenge his injured vanity, or to remove a rival whom he envied; Marat,  from the same instinctive love of blood, which induces a wolf to  continue his ravage of the flocks long after his hunger is appeased.    Passing by the horrors of the reign of terror, we shall close the second  volume with a vivid and powerful picture, which we cannot refrain  quoting--      THE DEATH OF ROBESPIERRE.    Meantime the convention continued to maintain the bold and commanding  front which they had so suddenly and critically assumed. Upon learning  the escape of the arrested deputies, and hearing of the insurrection at  the Hotel de Ville, they instantly passed a decree outlawing Robespierre  and his associates, inflicting a similar doom upon the mayor of Paris,  the procureur and other members of the commune, and charging twelve of  their members, the boldest who could be selected, to proceed with the  armed force to the execution of the sentence. The drums of the National  Guards now beat to arms in all the sections under authority of the  convention, while the tocsin continued to summon assistance with its  iron voice to Robespierre and the civic magistrates. Every thing  appeared to threaten a violent catastrophe, until it was seen clearly  that the public voice, and especially amongst the National Guards, was  declaring itself generally against the Terrorists.    The Hotel de Ville was surrounded by about fifteen hundred men, and  cannon turned upon the doors. The force of the assailants was weakest in  point of number, but their leaders were men of spirit, and night  concealed their inferiority of force.    The deputies commissioned for the purpose read the decree of the  assembly to those whom they found assembled in front of the city-hall,  and they shrunk from the attempt of defending it, some joining the  assailants, others laying down their arms and dispersing. Meantime the  deserted group of Terrorists within conducted themselves like scorpions,  which, when surrounded by a circle of fire, are said to turn their  stings on each other, and on themselves. Mutual and ferocious upbraiding  took place among these miserable men. \"Wretch, were these the means you  promised to furnish?\" said Payan to Henriot, whom he found intoxicated  and incapable of resolution or exertion; and seizing on him as he spoke,  he precipitated the revolutionary general from a window. Henriot  survived the fall only to drag himself into a drain, in which he was  afterwards discovered and brought out to execution. The younger  Robespierre threw himself from the window, but had not the good fortune  to perish on the spot. It seemed as if even the melancholy fate of  suicide, the last refuge of guilt and despair, was denied to men who had  so long refused every species of mercy to their fellow-creatures. Le Bas  alone had calmness enough to despatch himself with a pistol-shot. Saint  Just, after imploring his comrades to kill him, attempted his own life  with an irresolute hand, and failed, Couthon lay beneath the table  brandishing a knife, with which he repeatedly wounded his bosom, without  daring to add force enough to reach his heart. Their chief, Robespierre,  in an unsuccessful attempt to shoot himself, had only inflicted a  horrible fracture on his under-jaw.    In this situation they were found like wolves in their lair, foul with  blood, mutilated, despairing, and yet not able to die. Robespierre lay  on a table in an anti-room, his head supported by a deal-box, and his  hideous countenance half-hidden by a bloody and dirty cloth bound round  the shattered chin.[1]        [1] It did not escape the minute observers of this scene, that      he still held in his hand the bag which had contained the fatal      pistol, and which was inscribed with the words, _Au grand      monarque_, alluding to the sign, doubtless, of the gunsmith who      sold the weapon, but singularly applicable to the high      pretensions of the purchaser.    The captives were carried in triumph to the convention, who, without  admitting them to the bar, ordered them, as outlaws, for instant  execution. As the fatal cars passed to the guillotine, those who filled  them, but especially Robespierre, were overwhelmed with execrations from  the friends and relatives of victims whom he had sent on the same  melancholy road. The nature of his previous wound, from which the cloth  had never been removed till the executioner tore it off, added to the  torture of the sufferer. The shattered jaw dropped, and the wretch  yelled aloud, to the horror of the spectators.[2] A mask taken from that  dreadful head was long exhibited in different nations of Europe, and  appalled the spectator by its ugliness, and the mixture of fiendish  expression with that of bodily agony.        [2] The fate of no tyrant in history was so hideous at the      conclusion, excepting perhaps that of Jugurtha.    Thus fell Maximilian Robespierre, after having been the first person in  the French republic for nearly two years, during which time he governed  it upon the principles of Nero or Caligula. His elevation to the  situation which he held involved more contradictions than perhaps  attach to any similar event in history. A low-born and low-minded  tyrant was permitted to rule with the rod of the most frightful  despotism a people, whose anxiety for liberty had shortly before  rendered them unable to endure the rule of a humane and lawful  sovereign. A dastardly coward arose to the command of one of the bravest  nations in the world; and it was under the auspices of a man who dared  scarce fire a pistol, that the greatest generals in France began their  careers of conquest. He had neither eloquence nor imagination; but  substituted in their stead a miserable, affected, bombastic style,  which, until other circumstances gave him consequence, drew on him  general ridicule. Yet against so poor an orator, all the eloquence of  the philosophical Girondists, all the terrible powers of his associate  Danton, employed in a popular assembly, could not enable them to make an  effectual resistance. It may seem trifling to mention, that in a nation  where a good deal of prepossession is excited by amiable manners and  beauty of external appearance, the person who ascended to the highest  power was not only ill-looking, but singularly mean in person, awkward  and constrained in his address, ignorant how to set about pleasing even  when he most desired to give pleasure, and as tiresome nearly as he was  odious and heartless.    To compensate all these deficiencies, Robespierre had but an insatiable  ambition, founded on a vanity which made him think himself capable of  filling the highest situation; and therefore gave him daring, when to  dare is frequently to achieve. He mixed a false and over-strained, but  rather fluent species of bombastic composition, with the grossest  flattery to the lowest classes of the people; in consideration of which,  they could not but receive as genuine the praises which he always  bestowed on himself. His prudent resolution to be satisfied with  possessing the essence of power, without seeming to desire its rank and  trappings, formed another art of cajoling the multitude. His watchful  envy, his long-protracted but sure revenge, his craft, which to vulgar  minds supplies the place of wisdom, were his only means of competing  with his distinguished antagonists. And it seems to have been a merited  punishment of the extravagances and abuses of the French revolution,  that it engaged the country in a state of anarchy which permitted a  wretch such as we have described, to be for a long period master of her  destiny. Blood was his element, like that of the other Terrorists, and  he never fastened with so much pleasure on a new victim, as when he was"]]]
