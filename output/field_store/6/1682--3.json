I guess I know I milk the  cows, wash dishes, scrub floors, and do the washin' and ir'nin' every  week, but I'm no 'servant,' I'm just as good any day as that  good-fer-nothin' Perfesser's son,\" continued Sibylla, growing red in  the face with indignation. \"Didn't I hear that worthless scamp, Fritz  Schmidt, a-referrin' to me and a-sayin' to Miss Midleton fer the  'servant' to bring over the butter? Betch yer life this here 'servant'  ain't a-goin' to allow eddicated people to make a fool of her. First  chance I get I'll give that Perfesser a piece of my mind.\"    Sibylla's opportunity came rather unexpectedly. The gentle,  mild-mannered Professor was on good terms with his sturdy, energetic  neighbor, John Landis, and frequently visited him for a neighborly  chat. On this particular day he called as usual and found Sibvlla in  the mood described.    \"Good afternoon, Sibylla,\" said the Professor, good-naturedly. \"How  are you today?\"    \"I'd be a whole lot better if some people weren't so smart,\" replied  Sibylla, venting her feelings on the broom. \"Should think a Perfesser  would feel himself too big to talk to a 'servant'.\"    \"On the contrary, my dear girl, I feel honored. I presume you are not  feeling as well as usual. What makes you think it is condescension for  me to address you?\" asked the genial old man, kindly.    \"Well, since you ask me, I don't mind a-tellin' you. Yesterday your  son insulted me, I won't take no insult from nobody, I am just as good  as what you are, even if I hain't got much book larnin'.\"    With this deliverance, Sibylla felt she had done full justice to the  occasion and would have closed the interview abruptly had not the  Professor, with a restraining hand, detained her.    \"We must get to the bottom of this grievance, Sibylla. I am sure there  is some mistake somewhere. What did my son say?\"    \"Well, if you want to know,\" replied the irate domestic, 'I'll tell  you. He called me a 'servant.' I know I'm only a working girl, but  your son nor nobody else ain't got no right to abuse me by callin' me  a 'servant'.\"    \"Ah! I see. You object to the term 'servant' being applied to you,\"  said the Professor, comprehendingly. \"The word 'servant' is  distasteful to you. You feel it is a disgrace to be called a servant.  I see! I see!\" In a fatherly way, the old man resumed: \"In a certain  sense we are all servants. The history of human achievements is a  record of service. The men and women who have helped the world most  were all servants--servants to humanity. The happiest man is he who  serves. God calls some men to sow and some to reap; some to work in  wood and stone; to sing and speak. Work is honorable in all,  regardless of the capacity in which we serve. There is no great  difference, after all, between the ordinary laborer and the railroad  president; both are servants, and the standard of measurement to be  applied to each man is the same. It is not so much a question of  station in life as it is the question of efficiency. Best of all, work  is education. There is culture that comes without college and  university. He who graduates from the college of hard work is as  honorable as he who takes a degree at Yale or Harvard; for wisdom can  be found in shop and foundry, field and factory, in the kitchen amid  pots and kettles, as well as in office and school. The truly educated  man is the man who has learned the duty and responsibility of doing  something useful, something helpful, something to make this old world  of ours better and a happier place in which to live. The word  'servant,' Sibylla, is a beautiful one, rightly understood. The  greatest man who ever lived was a servant. All His earthly ministry  was filled with worthy deeds. When man pleaded with Him to rest, He  answered: 'My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.' When one of  Christ's followers desired to express the true nature of his work and  office, he called himself a servant. He used a word, 'doulos,' which  means, in the Greek language, a slave or a bond-servant. By the word  'doulos' he meant to say that his mission in life was to work, to do  good, to serve. This man was a great preacher, but it is possible for  any one to become a 'doulos' in so far as he is willing to serve God  and his fellowman. You see, Sibylla, the spirit of Christian work and  brotherly love is the spirit of 'doulos.' The word has been  transformed by service and unselfish devotion to duty. Great men who  have blessed the world, and good and noble women who have helped to  uplift humanity, have done it through service. It is just as honorable  to bake well, and cook well, and to do the humblest daily tasks  efficiently, as it is to play well on the piano and talk fluently  about the latest books.\"    At the conclusion of the Professor's little talk on the dignity of  labor, a new light shone in Sibylla's eyes and a new thought gripped  her soul. The spirit of \"doulos\" had displaced her antipathy toward  the word servant.    \"I'll take that butter over to the Professer's home right away,\" she  said, to herself.    Before leaving Sibylla, the Professor quoted from the \"Toiling of  Felix,\" by Henry Vandyke:         \"Hewing wood and drawing water, splitting stones and cleaving       sod, All the dusty ranks of labour, in the regiment of God, March       together toward His triumph, do the task His hands prepare;       Honest toil is holy service, faithful work is praise and prayer.\"         They who work without complaining, do the holy will of God.         Heaven is blest with perfect rest, but the blessing of earth is       toil.    Sibylla Linsabigler was a healthy, large-boned, solidly-built, typical  \"Pennsylvania German\" girl. Her clear, pinkish complexion looked as if  freshly scrubbed with soap and water. A few large, brown freckles  adorned the bridge of her rather broad, flat nose. She possessed red  hair and laughing, red-brown eyes, a large mouth, which disclosed  beautiful even, white teeth when she smiled, extraordinary large feet  and hands, strong, willing and usually good-natured, although  possessed of a quick temper, as her red hair indicated. Kind-hearted  to a fault, she was of great assistance to Aunt Sarah, although she  preferred any other work to that of cooking or baking. She kept the  kitchen as well as other parts of the house, to quote Aunt Sarah,  \"neat as a pin,\" and did not object to any work, however hard or  laborious, as long as she was not expected to do the thinking and  planning. She was greatly attached to both Aunt Sarah and Mary, but  stood rather in awe of John Landis, who had never spoken a cross word  to her in the three years she had lived at the farm.    Sarah Landis, knowing Sibylla to be an honest, industrious girl,  appreciated her good qualities, thought almost as much of Sibylla as  if she had been her daughter, and treated her in like manner, and for  this reason, if for no other, she received willing service from the  girl.    Sibylla, a swift worker at all times, never finished work so quickly  as on Wednesday and Saturday evenings, when she \"kept company\" with  Jake Crouthamel. \"Chake,\" as Sibylla called him, was a sturdy,  red-faced young farmer, all legs and arms. He appeared to be put  together loosely at the joints, like a jumping-jack, and never  appeared at ease in his ill-fitting \"store clothes.\" He usually wore  gray corduroy trousers and big cowhide boots, a pink and white striped  shirt and red necktie.    Sibylla did not notice his imperfections, and thought him handsome as  a Greek god.    Jake, an honest, industrious young fellow, worked on a near-by farm,  owned his own carriage, and had the privilege of using one of the farm  horses when he wished, so he and Sibylla frequently took \"choy rides,\"  as Sibylla called them.    Jake Crouthamel was usually called \"Boller-Yockel,\" this name having  been accorded him on account of his having delivered to a purchaser a  load of hay largely composed of rag-weed. The man called him an old  \"Boller-Yockel,\" and the name had clung to Jake for years.          CHAPTER XI.    \"NEW COLONIAL\" RAG RUGS.      Several days had elapsed since that on which Mary's Aunt had planned  to use the contents of her trunk to such good advantage, when Mary,  coming into the room where her Aunt was busily engaged sewing,  exclaimed: \"Don't forget, Auntie, you promised to teach me to crochet  rag rugs!\"    [Illustration: A \"HIT-AND-MISS\" RUG]    \"Indeed, I've not forgotten, and will make my promise good at once,\"  said Aunt Sarah. \"We shall need quantities of carpet rags cut about  one-half inch in width, the same as those used for making rag carpet.  Of course, you are aware, Mary, that heavier materials should be cut  in narrower strips than those of thinner materials. You will also  require a long, wooden crochet needle, about as thick as an ordinary  wooden lead pencil, having a hook at one end, similar to a common bone  crochet needle, only larger. For a circular rug, crochet about twelve  stitches (single crochet) over one end of a piece of candle wick or  cable cord; or, lacking either of these, use a carpet rag of firm  material; then draw the crocheted strip into as small a circle as  possible, fasten and crochet round and round continuously until  finished. The centre of a circular or oblong rug may be a plain color,  with border of colored light and dark rags, sewed together  promiscuously, called 'Hit and Miss.'    [Illustration: A BROWN AND TAN RUG]    \"Or you might have a design similar to a 'Pin-wheel' in centre of the  circular rug, with alternate stripes, composed of dark and  light-colored rags.\"    \"I'd like one made"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13559"],[0,"The Backwoods of Canada (#10)"],[1,"of this a very few weeks'  acquaintance with the _bush_, as we term all unbroken forest land, will  prove. At the end of five years you may begin to talk of these pretty  improvements and elegancies, and you will then be able to see a little  what you are about.\"    \"I thought,\" said I, \"every thing in this country was done with so much  expedition. I am sure I have heard and read of houses being built in a  day.\" The old gentleman laughed.    \"Yes, yes,\" he replied, \"travellers find no difficulty in putting up a  house in twelve or twenty-four hours, and so the log-walls can be raised  in that time or even less; but the house is not completed when the outer  walls are up, as your husband will find to his cost.\"    \"But all the works on emigration that I leave read,\" replied I, \"give a  fair and flattering picture of a settler's life; for, according to their  statements, the difficulties are easily removed.\"    \"Never mind books,\" said my companion, \"use your own reason. Look on  those interminable forests, through which the eye can only penetrate a  few yards, and tell me how those vast timbers are to be removed, utterly  extirpated, I may say, from the face of the earth, the ground cleared  and burnt, a crop sown and fenced, and a house to shelter you raised,  without difficulty, without expense, and without great labour. Never  tell me of what is said in books, written very frequently by tarry-at-  home travellers. Give me facts. One honest, candid emigrant's experience  is worth all that has been written on the subject. Besides, that which  may be a true picture of one part of the country will hardly suit  another. The advantages and disadvantages arising from soil, situation,  and progress of civilization, are very different in different districts:  even the prices of goods and of produce, stock and labour, vary  exceedingly, according as you are near to, or distant from, towns and  markets.\"    I began to think my fellow-traveller spoke sensibly on the subject, with  which the experience of thirteen years had made him perfectly  conversant. I began to apprehend that we also had taken too flattering a  view of a settler's life as it must be in the backwoods. Time and our  own personal knowledge will be the surest test, and to that we must bow.  We are ever prone to believe that which we wish.    About halfway between Cobourg and the Rice Lake there is a pretty valley  between two steep hills. Here there is a good deal of cleared land and a  tavern: the place is called \"Cold Springs.\" Who knows but some century  or two hence this spot may become a fashionable place of resort to drink  the waters. A Canadian Bath or Cheltenham may spring up where now Nature  revels in her wilderness of forest trees.    We now ascended the plains--a fine elevation of land--for many miles  scantily clothed with oaks, and here and there bushy pines, with other  trees and shrubs. The soil is in some places sandy, but varies, I am  told, considerably in different parts, and is covered in large tracks  with rich herbage, affording abundance of the finest pasture for cattle.  A number of exquisite flowers and shrubs adorn these plains, which rival  any garden in beauty during the spring and summer months. Many of these  plants are peculiar to the plains, and are rarely met with in any other  situation. The trees, too, though inferior in size to those in the  forests, are more picturesque, growing in groups or singly, at  considerable intervals, giving a sort of park-like appearance to this  portion of the country. The prevailing opinion seems to be, that the  plains laid out in grazing or dairy farms would answer the purpose of  settlers well; as there is plenty of land that will grow wheat and other  corn-crops, and can be improved at a small expense, besides abundance of  natural pasture for cattle. One great advantage seems to be, that the  plough can be introduced directly, and the labour of preparing the  ground is necessarily much less than where it is wholly covered with  wood.    [Illustration: Rice Grounds]    There are several settlers on these plains possessing considerable  farms. The situation, I should think, must be healthy and agreeable,  from the elevation and dryness of the land, and the pleasant prospect  they command of the country below them, especially where the Rice Lake,  with its various islands and picturesque shores, is visible. The ground  itself is pleasingly broken into hill and valley, sometimes gently  sloping, at other times abrupt and almost precipitous.    An American farmer, who formed one of our party at breakfast the  following morning, told me that these plains were formerly famous  hunting grounds of the Indians, who, to prevent the growth of the  timbers, burned them year after year; this, in process of time,  destroyed the young trees, so as to prevent them again from accumulating  to the extent they formerly did. Sufficient only was left to form  coverts; for the deer resort hither in great herds for the sake of a  peculiar tall sort of grass with which these plains abound, called deer-  grass, on which they become exceedingly fat at certain seasons of the  year.    Evening closed in before we reached the tavern on the shores of the Rice  Lake, where we were to pass the night; so that I lost something of the  beautiful scenery which this fine expanse of water presents as you  descend the plains towards its shores. The glimpses I caught of it were  by the faint but frequent flashes of lightning that illumined the  horizon to the north, which just revealed enough to make me regret I  could see no more that night. The Rice Lake is prettily diversified with  small wooded islets: the north bank rises gently from the water's edge.  Within sight of Sully, the tavern from which the steam-boat starts that  goes up the Otanabee, you see several well-cultivated settlements; and  beyond the Indian village the missionaries have a school for the  education and instruction of the Indian children. Many of them can both  read and write fluently, and are greatly improved in their moral and  religious conduct. They are well and comfortably clothed, and have  houses to live in. But they are still too much attached to their  wandering habits to become good and industrious settlers. During certain  seasons they leave the village, and encamp themselves in the woods along  the borders of those lakes and rivers that present the most advantageous  hunting and fishing grounds.    The Rice Lake and Mud Lake Indians belong, I am told, to the Chippewas;  but the traits of cunning and warlike ferocity that formerly marked this  singular people seem to have disappeared beneath the milder influence of  Christianity.    Certain it is that the introduction of the Christian religion is the  first greatest step towards civilization and improvement; its very  tendency being to break down the strong-holds of prejudice and  ignorance, and unite mankind in one bond of social brotherhood. I have  been told that for some time drunkenness was unknown, and even the  moderate use of spirits was religiously abstained from by all the  converts. This abstinence is still practised by some families; but of  late the love of ardent spirits has again crept in among them, bringing  discredit upon their faith. It is indeed hardly to be wondered at, when  the Indian sees those around him that call themselves Christians, and  who are better educated, and enjoy the advantages of civilized society,  indulging to excess in this degrading vice, that he should suffer his  natural inclination to overcome his Christian duty, which might in some  have taken no deep root. I have been surprised and disgusted by the  censures passed on the erring Indian by persons who were foremost in  indulgence at the table and the tavern; as if the crime of drunkenness  were more excusable in the man of education than in the half-reclaimed  savage.    There are some fine settlements on the Rice Lake, but I am told the  shores are not considered healthy, the inhabitants being subject to  lake-fevers and ague, especially where the ground is low and swampy.  These fevers and agues are supposed by some people to originate in the  extensive rice-beds which cause a stagnation in the water; the constant  evaporation from the surface acting on a mass of decaying vegetation  must tend to have a bad effect on the constitution of those that are  immediately exposed to its pernicious influence.    Besides numerous small streams, here called _creeks_, two considerable  rivers, the Otanabee and the Trent, find an outlet for their waters in  the Rice Lake. These rivers are connected by a chain of small lakes,  which you may trace on any good map of the province. I send you a  diagram, which has been published at Cobourg, which will give you the  geography of this portion of the country. It is on one of these small  lakes we purpose purchasing land, which, should the navigation of these  waters be carried into effect, as is generally supposed to be in  contemplation, will render the lands on their shores very advantageous  to the settlers; at present they are interrupted by large blocks of  granite and limestone, rapids, and falls, which prevent any but canoes  or flat-bottomed boats from passing on them, and even these are limited  to certain parts, on account of the above-named obstacles. By deepening  the bed of the river and lakes, and forming locks in some parts and  canals, the whole sweep of these waters might be thrown open to the Bay  of Quinte. The expense, however, would necessarily be great; and till  the townships of this portion of the district be fully settled, it is  hardly to be expected that so vast an undertaking should be effected,  however desirable it may be.    [Illustration: Sleigh driving]    We left the tavern at Rice Lake, after an unusual delay, at nine  o'clock. The morning was damp, and a cold wind blew over the lake, which  appeared to little"]]]
