But this and  other structures did not possess that unity of design which marked the  Grecian temples. Alleys of colossal sphinxes formed the approach. At  Karnak the alley was six thousand feet long, and before the main body  of the edifice stood two obelisks commemorative of the dedication. The  principal structures of Egyptian temples do not follow the straight  line, but begin with pyramidal towers which flank the gateways; then  follow, usually, a court surrounded with colonnades, subordinate  temples, and houses for the priests. A second pylon, or pyramidal tower,  leads to the interior and most considerable part of the temple,--a  portico inclosed with walls, which receives light only through the  entablature or openings in the roof. Adjoining this is the cella of the  temple, without columns, enclosed by several walls, often divided into  various small chambers with monolithic receptacles for idols or mummies  or animals. The columns stand within the walls. The colonnade is not, as  among the Greeks, an expansion of the temple; it is merely the wall with  apertures. The walls, composed of square blocks, are perpendicular only  on the inside, and bevelled externally, so that the thickness at the  bottom sometimes amounts to twenty-four feet; thus the whole building  assumes a pyramidal form, the fundamental principle of Egyptian  architecture. The columns are more slender than the early Doric, are  placed close together, and have bases of circular plinths; the shaft  diminishes upward, and is ornamented with perpendicular or oblique  furrows, but not fluted like Grecian columns. The capitals are of the  bell form, ornamented with all kinds of foliage, and have a narrow but  high abacus. They abound with sculptured decorations, the designs of  which were borrowed from the vegetation of the country. The highest of  the columns of the temple of Luxor is five and a quarter times the  greatest diameter.    But no monuments have ever excited so much curiosity and wonder as the  Pyramids, not in consequence of any particular beauty or ingenuity in  their construction, but because of their immense size and unknown age.  None but sacerdotal monarchs would ever have erected them; none but a  fanatical people would ever have toiled upon them. We do not know for  what purpose they were raised, unless as sepulchres for kings. They are  supposed to have been built at a remote antiquity, between two thousand  and three thousand years before Christ. Lepsius thought that the oldest  of these Pyramids were built more than three thousand years before  Christ. The Pyramid of Cheops, at Memphis, covers a square whose side is  seven hundred and sixty-eight feet, and rises into the air nearly five  hundred feet. It is a solid mass of stone, which has suffered less from  time than the mountains near it. Possibly it stands over an immense  substructure, in which may yet be found the lore of ancient Egypt; it  may even prove to be the famous labyrinth of which Herodotus speaks,  built by the twelve kings of Egypt. According to this author, one  hundred thousand men worked on this monument for forty years.    The palaces of the kings are mere imitations of the temples, their only  difference of architecture being that their rooms are larger and in  greater numbers. Some think that the famous labyrinth was a collective  palace of many rulers.    Of Babylonian architecture we know little beyond what the Hebrew  Scriptures and ancient authors tell us. But though nothing survives of  ancient magnificence, we know that a city whose walls, according to  Herodotus, were eighty-seven feet in thickness, three hundred and  thirty-seven in height, and sixty miles in circumference, and in which  were one hundred gates of brass, must have had considerable  architectural splendor. This account of Babylon, however, is probably  exaggerated, especially as to the height of the walls. The tower of  Belus, the Palace of Nebuchadnezzar, and the Obelisk of Semiramis were  probably wonderful structures, certainly in size, which is one of the  conditions of architectural effect.    The Tyrians must have carried architecture to considerable perfection,  since the Temple of Solomon, one of the most magnificent in the ancient  world, was probably built by artists from Tyre. It was not remarkable  for size,--it was, indeed, very small,--but it had great splendor of  decoration. It was of quadrangular outline, erected upon a solid  platform of stone, and bearing a striking resemblance to the oldest  Greek temples, like those of Aegina and Paestum. The portico of the  Temple as rebuilt by Herod was one hundred and eighty feet high, and the  Temple itself was entered by nine gates, thickly coated with silver and  gold. The inner sanctuary was covered on all sides with plates of gold,  and was dazzling to the eye. The various courts and porticos and palaces  with which it was surrounded gave to it a very imposing effect.    Architectural art in India was not so impressive and grand as in Egypt,  and was directed chiefly to the erection of temples. Nor is it of very  ancient date. There is no stone architecture now remaining in India,  according to Sir James Fergusson, older than two and a half centuries  before Christ; and this is in the form of Buddhist temples, generally  traced to the great Asoka, who reigned from 272 B.C. to 236 B.C., and  who established Buddhism as a state religion. There were doubtless  magnificent buildings before his time, but they were of wood, and have  all perished. We know, however, nothing about them.    The Buddhist temples were generally excavated out of the solid rock, and  only the facades were ornamented. These were not larger than ordinary  modern parochial churches, and do not give the impression of  extraordinary magnificence. Besides these rock-hewn temples in India  there remain many examples of a kind of memorial monument called  _stupas_, or _topes_. The earliest of these are single columns; but the  later and more numerous are in the shape of cones or circular mounds,  resembling domes, rarely exceeding one hundred feet in diameter. Around  the apex of each was a balustrade, or some ornamental work, about six  feet in diameter. These topes remind one of the Pantheon at Rome in  general form, but were of much smaller size. They were built on a stone  basement less than fifty feet in height, above which was the brickwork.  In process of time they came to resemble pyramidal towers rather than  rounded domes, and were profusely ornamented with carvings. The great  peculiarity of all Indian architectural monuments is excessive  ornamentation rather than beauty of proportion or grand effect.    In course of time, however, Indian temples became more and more  magnificent; and a Chinese traveller in the year 400 A.D. describes one  in Gaudhava as four hundred and seventy feet high, decorated with every  sort of precious substance. Its dome, as it appears in a bas-relief,  must have rivalled that of St. Peter's at Rome; but no trace of it now  remains. The topes of India, which were numerous, indicate that the  Hindus were acquainted with the arch, both pointed and circular, which  was not known to the Egyptians or the Greeks. The most important of  these buildings, in which are preserved valuable relics, are found in  the Punjab. They were erected about twenty years before Christ. In size,  they are about one hundred and twenty-seven feet in diameter. Connected  with the circular topes are found what are called _rails_, surrounding  the topes, built in the form of rectangles, with heavy pillars. One of  the most interesting of these was found to be two hundred and  seventy-five feet long, having square pillars twenty-two feet in height,  profusely carved with scenes from the life of Buddha, topped by capitals  in the shape of elephants supporting a succession of horizontal stone  beams, all decorated with a richness of carving unknown in any other  country. The Amravati rail, one of the finest of the ancient monuments  of India, is found to be one hundred and ninety-five by one hundred and  sixty-five feet, having octagonal pillars ornamented with the most  elaborate carvings.    From an architectural point of view, the rails were surpassed by the  _chaityas_, or temple-caves, in western India. These were cut in the  solid rock. Some one thousand different specimens are to be found. The  facades of these caves are perfect, generally in the form of an arch,  executed in the rock with every variety of detail, and therefore  imperishable without violence. The process of excavation extended  through ten centuries from the time of Asoka; and the interiors as well  as the facades were highly ornamented with sculptures. The temple-caves  are seldom more than one hundred and fifty feet deep and fifty feet in  width, and the roofs are supported by pillars like the interior of  Gothic cathedrals, some of which are of beautiful proportions with  elaborated capitals. Though these rock-hewn temples are no larger than  ordinary Christian churches, they are very impressive from the richly  decorated carvings; they were lighted from a single opening in the  facade, sometimes in the shape of a horseshoe.    Besides these chaityas, or temples, there are still more numerous  _viharas_, or monasteries, found in India, of different dates, but none  older than the third century before Christ. They show a central hall,  surrounded on three sides by cells for the monks. On the fourth side is  an open verandah; facing this is generally a shrine with an image of  Buddha. These edifices are not imposing unless surrounded by galleries,  as some were, supported by highly decorated pillars. The halls are  constructed in several stories with heavy masonry, in the shape of  pyramids adorned"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10523"],[0,"Alcestis (#10)"],[1,"she vanished. The story is told  with overpowering beauty in Vergil's fourth Georgic.    P. 21, l. 367, Oh, not in death from thee Divided.]--Parodied in  Aristophanes' _Archarnians_ 894, where it is addressed to an eel, and  the second line ends \"in a beet-root fricassee.\" See on l. 182.    P. 23, l. 393 ff., The Little Boy's speech.]--Classical Greek sculpture  and vase-painting tended to represent children not like children but like  diminutive men; and something of the sort is true of Greek tragedy.  The stately tragic convention has in the main to be maintained; the child  must speak a language suited for heroes, or at least for high poetry.  The quality of childishness has to be indicated by a word or so of  child-language delicately admitted amid the stateliness. Here we have  [Greek: maia], something like \"mummy,\" at the beginning, and [Greek:  neossos], \"chicken\" or \"little bird,\" at the end. Otherwise most of the  language is in the regular tragic diction, and some of it doubtless seems  to us unsuitable for a child. If Milton had had to make a child speak in  _Paradise Lost_, what sort of diction would he have given it?    The success or ill-success of such an attempt as this to combine the two  styles, the heroic and the childlike, depends on questions of linguistic  tact, and can hardly be judged with any confidence by foreigners. But I  think we can see Euripides here, as in other places, reaching out at an  effect which was really beyond the resources of his art, and attaining a  result which, though clearly imperfect, is strangely moving. He gets great  effects from the use of children in several tragedies, though he seldom  lets them speak. They speak in the _Medea_, the _Andromache_,  and _Suppliants_, and are mute figures in the _Trojan Women,  Hecuba, Heracles_, and _Iphigenia in Aulis_. We may notice that  where his children do speak, they speak only in lyrics, never in ordinary  dialogue. This is very significant, and clearly right.    The breaking-down of the child seems to string Admetus to self-control  again.    P. 25, l. 428, Ye chariot-lords.]--The plain of Thessaly was famous for  its cavalry.    P. 25, l. 436 ff., Chorus.]--The \"King black-browed\" is, of course, Hades;  the \"grey hand at the helm and oar,\" Charon; the \"Tears that Well,\" the  more that spreads out from Acheron, the River of _Ache_ or Sorrows.    P. 25, l. 445 ff. Alcestis shall be celebrated--and no doubt worshipped--  at certain full-moon feasts in Athens and Sparta, especially at the  Carneia, a great Spartan festival held at the full moon in the month  Carneios (August-September). Who the ancient hero Carnos or Carneios was  is not very clearly stated by the tradition; but at any rate he was  killed, and the feast was meant to placate and perhaps to revive him.  Resurrection is apt to be a feature of both moon-goddesses and vegetation  spirits.    P. 27, l. 476, Entrance of Heracles.]--Generally, in the tragic  convention, each character that enters either announces himself or is  announced by some one on the stage; but the figure of Heracles with his  club and lion-skin was so well known that his identity could be taken for  granted. The Leader at once addresses him by name.    P. 27, l. 481, The Argive King.]--It was the doom of Heracles, from before  his birth, to be the servant of a worser man. His master proved to be  Eurystheus, King of Tiryns or Argos, who was his kinsman, and older by a  day. See _Iliad_ T 95 ff. Note the heroic quality of Heracles's  answer in l. 491. It does not occur to him to think of reward for himself.    P. 27, l. 483, Diomede of Thrace.]--This man, distinguished in legend from  the Diomede of the _Iliad_, was a savage king who threw wayfarers to  his man-eating horses. Such horses are not mere myths; horses have often  been trained to fight with their teeth, like carnivora, for war purposes.  Diomedes was a son of Ares, the War-god or Slayer, as were the other wild  tyrants mentioned just below, Lycaon, the Wolf-hero, and Cycnus, the Swan.    P. 30, l. 511, Right welcome were she: _i.e._ Joy.]--\"Joy would be a  strange visitor to me, but I know you mean kindly.\"    P. 30, l. 518 ff., Not thy wife? 'Tis not Alcestis?]--The rather elaborate  misleading of Heracles, without any direct lie, depends partly on the fact  that the Greek word [Greek: gynae]; means both \"woman\" and \"wife.\"--The  woman, not of kin with Admetus but much loved in the house, who has lived  there since her father's death left her an orphan, is of course Alcestis,  but Heracles, misled by Admetus's first answers, supposes it is some  dependant to whom the King happens to be attached. He naturally proposes  to go away, but, with much reluctance, allows himself to be over-persuaded  by Admetus. He had other friends in Thessaly, but the next castle would  probably be several miles off. The guest-chambers of the castle are  apparently in a separate building with a connecting passage.    As to Admetus's motive, we must remember that the entertaining of Heracles  is a datum of the story in its simplest form. See Preface, pp. xiv, xv. In  Euripides, Admetus is perhaps actuated by a mixture of motives, real  kindness, pride in his ancestral hospitality, and a little vanity. He  likes having the great Son of Zeus for a friend, and he has never yet  turned any one from his doors.    Euripides passes no distinct judgment on this act of Admetus. The Leader  in the dialogue blames him (\"Art thou mad?\") and so does Heracles  hereafter, p. 56. But the Chorus glorifies his deed in a very delightful  lyric. Perhaps this indicates the judgment we are meant to pass upon it.  On the plane of common sense it was doubtless all wrong, but on that of  imaginative poetry it was magnificent.    P. 35, 11. 569-605, Chorus.]--Apollo, worshipped as a shepherd god and a  singer, harper, piper, etc. (\"song-changer\"), had been himself a stranger  in this \"House that loved the stranger\": hence its great reward. Othrys is  the end of the mountain range to the south of Pherae; Lake Boibeis was  just across the narrow end of the plain to the north-east, beyond it came  Mt. Pelion and the steep harbourless coast. Up to the north-west the plain  of Thessaly stretched far away towards the Molossian mountains. The wild  beasts gathered round Apollo as they did round Orpheus (\"There where  Orpheus harped of old, And the trees awoke and knew him, And the wild  things gathered to him, As he piped amid the broken Glens his music  manifold.\"--_Bacchae_, p. 35).    P. 37, l. 614, Scene with Pheres.]--Pheres is in tradition the \"eponymous  hero\" of Pherae, _i.e._ the mythical person who is supposed to have  given his name to the town. It is only in this play that he has any  particular character. The scene gives the reader a shock, but is a  brilliant piece of satirical comedy, with a good deal of pathos in it,  too. The line (691) [Greek: chaireis horon phos, patera d' ou chairein  dokeis]; (\"Thou lovest the light, thinkest thou thy father loves it not?\")  seems to me one of the most characteristic in Euripides. It has a peculiar  mordant beauty in its absolutely simple language, and one cannot measure  the intensity of feeling that may be behind it. Pheres shows great power  of fight, yet one feels his age and physical weakness. See Preface, p.  xvi.    P. 40, l. 713 ff. The quick thrust and parry are sometimes hard to follow  in reading, though in acting the sense would be plain enough. Admetus  cries angrily, \"Oh, live a longer life than Zeus!\" \"Is that a curse?\" says  Pheres; \"are you cursing because nobody does you any harm?\" (_i.e_.  since you clearly have nothing else to curse for). Admetus: \"On the  contrary I blessed you; I knew you were greedy of life.\" Pheres: \"_I_  greedy? It is _you_, I believe, that Alcestis is dying for.\"    P. 42, l. 732. Acastus was Alcestis's brother, son of Pelias.    P. 43, l. 747. It is rare in Greek tragedy for the Chorus to leave the  stage altogether in the middle of a play. But they do so, for example, in  the _Ajax_ of Sophocles. Ajax is lost, and the Sailors who form the  Chorus go out to look for him; when they are gone the scene is supposed to  shift and Ajax enters alone, arranging his own death. This very effective  scene of the revelling Heracles is to be explained, I think, by the  Satyr-play tradition. See Preface.    P. 45, ll. 782-785. There are four lines rhyming in the Greek here; an odd  and slightly drunken effect.    P. 46, l. 805 ff., A woman dead, of no one's kin: why grieve so much?]--  Heracles is somewhat \"shameless,\" as a Greek would say; he had much more  delicacy when he was sober.    P. 48, l. 837 ff. A fine speech, leaving one in doubt whether it is the  outburst of a real hero or the vapouring of a half-drunken man. Just the  effect intended. Electryon was a chieftain of Tiryns. His daughter,  Alcmene, the Tirynthian _Kore_ or Earth-maiden, was beloved of Zeus,  or, as others put it, was chosen by Zeus to be the mother of the Deliverer  of mankind whom he was resolved to beget. She was married to Amphitryon of  Thebes.    P. 49, l. 860 ff. If Heracles set out straight to the grave and Admetus  with the procession was returning from the grave, how was it they did not  meet? The answer is that Attic drama seldom asked such questions.    Pp. 49-54, ll. 861-961. This Threnos, or lamentation scene, seems to our  minds a little long. We must remember (1) that a Tragedy _is_ a  Threnos--a _Trauerspiel_--and, however much it develops in the  direction of a mere entertainment, the Threnos-element is of primary  importance. (2) This scene has two purposes to serve; first to illustrate  the helpless loneliness of Admetus when he returns to his empty house, and  secondly the way in which remorse works in his mind, till in ll. 935-961  he makes public confession that he has done wrong. For both purposes one  needs the illusion of a long lapse of time.    P. 53, l. 945 ff., The floor unswept.]--Prob"]]]
