Behold thy sire and I  Sorrowing have sought thee;\" and so held her peace,  And straight the vision fled.  A female next  Appear'd before me, down whose visage cours'd  Those waters, that grief forces out from one  By deep resentment stung, who seem'd to say:  \"If thou, Pisistratus, be lord indeed  Over this city, nam'd with such debate  Of adverse gods, and whence each science sparkles,  Avenge thee of those arms, whose bold embrace  Hath clasp'd our daughter; \"and to fuel, meseem'd,  Benign and meek, with visage undisturb'd,  Her sovran spake: \"How shall we those requite,  Who wish us evil, if we thus condemn  The man that loves us?\"  After that I saw  A multitude, in fury burning, slay  With stones a stripling youth, and shout amain  \"Destroy, destroy:\" and him I saw, who bow'd  Heavy with death unto the ground, yet made  His eyes, unfolded upward, gates to heav'n,    Praying forgiveness of th' Almighty Sire,  Amidst that cruel conflict, on his foes,  With looks, that With compassion to their aim.    Soon as my spirit, from her airy flight  Returning, sought again the things, whose truth  Depends not on her shaping, I observ'd  How she had rov'd to no unreal scenes    Meanwhile the leader, who might see I mov'd,  As one, who struggles to shake off his sleep,  Exclaim'd: \"What ails thee, that thou canst not hold  Thy footing firm, but more than half a league  Hast travel'd with clos'd eyes and tott'ring gait,  Like to a man by wine or sleep o'ercharg'd?\"    \"Beloved father! so thou deign,\" said I,  \"To listen, I will tell thee what appear'd  Before me, when so fail'd my sinking steps.\"    He thus: \"Not if thy Countenance were mask'd  With hundred vizards, could a thought of thine  How small soe'er, elude me.  What thou saw'st  Was shown, that freely thou mightst ope thy heart  To the waters of peace, that flow diffus'd  From their eternal fountain.  I not ask'd,  What ails theeor such cause as he doth, who  Looks only with that eye which sees no more,  When spiritless the body lies; but ask'd,  To give fresh vigour to thy foot.  Such goads  The slow and loit'ring need; that they be found  Not wanting, when their hour of watch returns.\"    So on we journey'd through the evening sky  Gazing intent, far onward, as our eyes  With level view could stretch against the bright  Vespertine ray: and lo! by slow degrees  Gath'ring, a fog made tow'rds us, dark as night.  There was no room for 'scaping; and that mist  Bereft us, both of sight and the pure air.          CANTO XVI    Hell's dunnest gloom, or night unlustrous, dark,  Of every planes 'reft, and pall'd in clouds,  Did never spread before the sight a veil  In thickness like that fog, nor to the sense  So palpable and gross.  Ent'ring its shade,  Mine eye endured not with unclosed lids;  Which marking, near me drew the faithful guide,  Offering me his shoulder for a stay.    As the blind man behind his leader walks,  Lest he should err, or stumble unawares  On what might harm him, or perhaps destroy,  I journey'd through that bitter air and foul,  Still list'ning to my escort's warning voice,  \"Look that from me thou part not.\"  Straight I heard  Voices, and each one seem'd to pray for peace,  And for compassion, to the Lamb of God  That taketh sins away.  Their prelude still  Was \"Agnus Dei,\" and through all the choir,  One voice, one measure ran, that perfect seem'd  The concord of their song.  \"Are these I hear  Spirits, O master?\"  I exclaim'd; and he:  \"Thou aim'st aright: these loose the bonds of wrath.\"    \"Now who art thou, that through our smoke dost cleave?  And speak'st of us, as thou thyself e'en yet  Dividest time by calends?\"  So one voice  Bespake me; whence my master said: \"Reply;  And ask, if upward hence the passage lead.\"    \"O being! who dost make thee pure, to stand  Beautiful once more in thy Maker's sight!  Along with me: and thou shalt hear and wonder.\"  Thus I, whereto the spirit answering spake:    \"Long as 't is lawful for me, shall my steps  Follow on thine; and since the cloudy smoke  Forbids the seeing, hearing in its stead  Shall keep us join'd.\"  I then forthwith began  \"Yet in my mortal swathing, I ascend  To higher regions, and am hither come  Through the fearful agony of hell.  And, if so largely God hath doled his grace,  That, clean beside all modern precedent,  He wills me to behold his kingly state,  From me conceal not who thou wast, ere death  Had loos'd thee; but instruct me: and instruct  If rightly to the pass I tend; thy words  The way directing as a safe escort.\"    \"I was of Lombardy, and Marco call'd:  Not inexperienc'd of the world, that worth  I still affected, from which all have turn'd  The nerveless bow aside.  Thy course tends right  Unto the summit:\" and, replying thus,  He added, \"I beseech thee pray for me,  When thou shalt come aloft.\"  And I to him:  \"Accept my faith for pledge I will perform  What thou requirest.  Yet one doubt remains,  That wrings me sorely, if I solve it not,  Singly before it urg'd me, doubled now  By thine opinion, when I couple that  With one elsewhere declar'd, each strength'ning other.  The world indeed is even so forlorn  Of all good as thou speak'st it and so swarms  With every evil.  Yet, beseech thee, point  The cause out to me, that myself may see,  And unto others show it: for in heaven  One places it, and one on earth below.\"    Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh,  \"Brother!\" he thus began, \"the world is blind;  And thou in truth com'st from it.  Ye, who live,  Do so each cause refer to heav'n above,  E'en as its motion of necessity  Drew with it all that moves.  If this were so,  Free choice in you were none; nor justice would  There should be joy for virtue, woe for ill.  Your movements have their primal bent from heaven;  Not all; yet said I all; what then ensues?  Light have ye still to follow evil or good,  And of the will free power, which, if it stand  Firm and unwearied in Heav'n's first assay,  Conquers at last, so it be cherish'd well,  Triumphant over all.  To mightier force,  To better nature subject, ye abide  Free, not constrain'd by that, which forms in you  The reasoning mind uninfluenc'd of the stars.  If then the present race of mankind err,  Seek in yourselves the cause, and find it there.  Herein thou shalt confess me no false spy.    \"Forth from his plastic hand, who charm'd beholds  Her image ere she yet exist, the soul  Comes like a babe, that wantons sportively  Weeping and laughing in its wayward moods,  As artless and as ignorant of aught,  Save that her Maker being one who dwells  With gladness ever, willingly she turns  To whate'er yields her joy.  Of some slight good  The flavour soon she tastes; and, snar'd by that,  With fondness she pursues it, if no guide  Recall, no rein direct her wand'ring course.  Hence it behov'd, the law should be a curb;  A sovereign hence behov'd, whose piercing view  Might mark at least the fortress and main tower  Of the true city.  Laws indeed there are:  But who is he observes them?  None; not he,  Who goes before, the shepherd of the flock,  Who chews the cud but doth not cleave the hoof.  Therefore the multitude, who see their guide  Strike at the very good they covet most,  Feed there and look no further.  Thus the cause  Is not corrupted nature in yourselves,  But ill-conducting, that hath turn'd the world  To evil.  Rome, that turn'd it unto good,  Was wont to boast two suns, whose several beams  Cast light on either way, the world's and God's.  One since hath quench'd the other; and the sword  Is grafted on the crook; and so conjoin'd  Each must perforce decline to worse, unaw'd  By fear of other.  If thou doubt me, mark  The blade: each herb is judg'd of by its seed.  That land, through which Adice and the Po  Their waters roll, was once the residence  Of courtesy and velour, ere the day,  That frown'd on Frederick; now secure may pass  Those limits, whosoe'er hath left, for shame,  To talk with good men, or come near their haunts.  Three aged ones are still found there, in whom  The old time chides the new: these deem it long  Ere God restore them to a better world:  The good Gherardo, of Palazzo he  Conrad, and Guido of Castello, nam'd  In Gallic phrase more fitly the plain Lombard.  On this at last conclude.  The church of Rome,  Mixing two governments that ill assort,  Hath miss'd her footing, fall'n into the mire,  And there herself and burden much defil'd.\"    \"O Marco!\" I replied, shine arguments  Convince me: and the cause I now discern  Why of the heritage no portion came  To Levi's offspring.  But resolve me this  Who that Gherardo is, that as thou sayst  Is left a sample of the perish'd race,  And for rebuke to this untoward age?\"    \"Either thy words,\" said he, \"deceive; or else  Are meant to try me; that thou, speaking Tuscan,  Appear'st not to have heard of good Gherado;  The sole addition that, by which I know him;  Unless I borrow'd from his daughter Gaia  Another name to grace him.  God be with you.  I bear you company no more.  Behold  The dawn with white ray glimm'ring through the mist.  I must away--the angel comes--ere he  Appear.\"  He said, and would not hear me more.

Various suggestions were made to base representation  upon wealth or taxation and not upon population. For several days the  debate lasted during very heated weather, but on the night of July 12  the temperature dropped and with it the emotional temperature of the  delegates.    Some days previous, namely, June 28, when the debates were becoming so  bitter that it seemed unlikely that the convention could continue,  Doctor Franklin, erroneously supposed by many to be an atheist, made  the following solemn and beautiful appeal to their better natures. He  said:        \"The small progress we have made after four or five weeks' close      attendance and continual reasonings with each other--our different      sentiments on almost every question, several of the last producing      as many noes as ayes, is, methinks, a melancholy proof of the      imperfection of the human understanding. We indeed seem to feel our      own want of political wisdom, since we have been running about in      search of it. We have gone back to ancient history for models of      government, and examined the different forms of those Republics      which, having been formed with the seeds of their own dissolution,      now no longer exist. And we have viewed modern States all around      Europe, but find none of their constitutions suitable to our      circumstances.        \"In this situation of this Assembly, groping as it were in the dark      to find political truth, and scarce able to distinguish it when      presented to us, how has it happened, sir, that we have not hitherto      once thought of humbly applying to the Father of Lights to      illuminate our understandings?... And have we now forgotten that      powerful Friend or do we imagine that we no longer need His      assistance? I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live,      the more convincing proofs I see of this truth: That _God governs in      the affairs of men_. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground      without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without      His aid? We have been assured, sir, in the sacred writings, that      'except the Lord build the House they labour in vain that build it.'      I firmly believe this; and I also believe that without His      concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better      than the builders of Babel. We shall be divided by our little      partial local interests; our projects will be confounded, and we      ourselves shall become a reproach and byword down to future ages.      And what is worse, mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate      instance, despair of establishing governments by human wisdom and      leave it to chance, war, and conquest.        \"I therefore beg leave to move that henceforth prayers imploring the      assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be      held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business,      and that one or more of the clergy of this city be requested to      officiate in that service.\"    It may surprise my audience to know the sequel. The resolution was voted  down, partly on the ground that if it became known to the public that  the convention had finally resorted to prayers it might cause undue  alarm, but also because the convention was by that time so low in funds  that, as one of the members said, it did not have enough money to pay a  clergyman his fees for the service. I suspect that their controlling  reason was their indisposition to break their self-imposed rule of  secrecy by contact with the outer world until their work was completed.  Perhaps they thought that \"God helps those who help themselves.\"    On July 16 the compromise was finally adopted of recognizing the claims  of the larger States to proportionate representation in the House of  Representatives, and recognizing the claims of the smaller States by  according to them equal representation in the Senate. This great result  was not effected without the first break in the convention, for the  delegates from New York left in disgust and never returned, with the  exception of Hamilton, who occasionally attended subsequent sessions.  Such was the great concession that was made to secure the Constitution;  and the only respect in which the Constitution to-day cannot be amended  is that by express provision the equality of representation in the  Senate shall never be disturbed. Thus it is that to-day some States,  which have less population than some of the wards in the city of New  York, have as many votes in the Senate as the great State of New York.  It is unquestionably a palpable negation of majority rule, for as no  measure can become a law without the concurrence of the Senate--now  numbering ninety-six Senators--a combination of the little States, whoso  aggregate population is not a fifth of the American people, can defeat  the will of the remaining four-fifths. Pennsylvania and New York, with  nearly one-sixth of the entire population of the United States, have  only four votes in ninety-six votes in the Senate.    Fortunately, political alignments have rarely been between the greater  and the smaller States exclusively. Their equality in the Senate was a  big price to pay for the Union, but, as the event has shown, not too  great.    The convention next turned its attention to the Executive and the manner  of its selection, and upon this point there was the widest contrariety  of view, but, fortunately, without the acute feeling that the relative  power of the States had occasioned.    Then the judiciary article was taken up, and there was much earnest  discussion as to whether the new Constitution should embody the French  idea of giving to the judiciary, in conjunction with the Executive, a  revisory power over legislation. Three times the convention voted upon  this dangerous proposition, and on one occasion it was only defeated by  a single vote. Fortunately, the good sense of the convention rejected a  proposition, that had caused in France constant conflicts between the  Executive and the Judiciary, by substituting the right of the President  to veto congressional legislation, with the right of Congress, by a  two-thirds vote of each House, to override the veto, and secondly by an  implied power in the Judiciary to annul Congressional or State  legislation, not on the grounds of policy, but on the sole ground of  inconsistency with the paramount law of the Constitution. In this  adjustment, the influence of Montesquieu was evident.    These and many practical details had resulted in an expansion of the  fifteen proposals of the Virginia plan to twenty-three.    Having thus determined the general principles that should guide them in  their labours, the convention, on July 26 appointed a Committee on  Detail to embody these propositions in the formal draft of a  Constitution and adjourned until August 6 to await its report. That  report, when finally completed, covered seven folio pages, and was found  to consist of a Preamble and twenty-three Articles, embodying  forty-three sections. The draft did not slavishly follow the Virginia  propositions, for the committee embodied some valuable suggestions which  had occurred to them in their deliberations. Nevertheless, it  substantially put the Virginia plan into a workable plan which proved to  be the Constitution of the United States in embryo.    When the committee on detail had made its report on August 6, the  convention proceeded for over a month to debate it with the most minute  care. Every day for five weeks, for five hours each day, the members  studied and debated with meticulous care every sentence of the proposed  Constitution. Time does not suffice even for the barest statement of the  many interesting questions which were thus discussed, but they nearly  ran the whole gamut of constitutional government. Many fanciful ideas  were suggested but with unvarying good sense they were rejected. Some of  the results were, under the circumstances, curious. For example,  although it was a convention of comparatively young men, and although  the convention could have taken into account the many successful young  men in public life in Europe--as, for example, William Pitt--they put a  disqualification upon age by providing that a Representative must be  twenty-five years of age, a Senator thirty years of age, and a President  thirty-five years of age. When it was suggested that young men could  learn by admission to public life, the sententious reply was made that,  while they could, they ought not to have their education at the public  expense.    The debates proceeded, however, in better temper, and almost the only  question that again gave rise to passionate argument was that of  slavery. The extreme Southern States declared that they would never  accept the new plan \"except the right to import slaves be untouched.\"  This question was finally compromised by agreeing that the importation  of slaves should end after the year 1808. It however left the slave  population then existing in a state of bondage, and for this necessary  compromise the nation seventy-five years later was to pay dearly by one  of the most destructive civil wars in the annals of mankind.    August was now drawing to a close. The convention had been in session  for more than three months. Of its work the public knew nothing, and  this notwithstanding the acute interest which the American people, not  merely facing the peril of anarchy, but actually suffering from it, must  have taken in the convention. Its vital importance was not  under-estimated. While its builders, like all master builders, did  \"build better than they knew,\" yet it cannot be said that they  under-estimated the importance of their labours.
