All feeling hearts must feel for him    Who felt this picture. Presage dim--  Dim inklings from the shadowy sphere    Fixed him and fascinated here.    A demon-cloud like the mountain one    Burst on a spirit as mild  As this urned lake, the home of shades.    But Shakspeare's pensive child    Never the lines had lightly scanned,    Steeped in fable, steeped in fate;  The Hamlet in his heart was 'ware,    Such hearts can antedate.    No utter surprise can come to him    Who reaches Shakspeare's core;  That which we seek and shun is there--      Man's final lore.        Rebel Color-bearers at Shiloh:[16]  A plea against the vindictive cry raised by civilians shortly  after the surrender at Appomattox.      The color-bearers facing death  White in the whirling sulphurous wreath,    Stand boldly out before the line  Right and left their glances go,  Proud of each other, glorying in their show;  Their battle-flags about them blow,    And fold them as in flame divine:  Such living robes are only seen  Round martyrs burning on the green--  And martyrs for the Wrong have been.    Perish their Cause! but mark the men--  Mark the planted statues, then  Draw trigger on them if you can.    The leader of a patriot-band  Even so could view rebels who so could stand;    And this when peril pressed him sore,  Left aidless in the shivered front of war--    Skulkers behind, defiant foes before,  And fighting with a broken brand.  The challenge in that courage rare--  Courage defenseless, proudly bare--  Never could tempt him; he could dare  Strike up the leveled rifle there.    Sunday at Shiloh, and the day  When Stonewall charged--McClellan's crimson May,  And Chickamauga's wave of death,  And of the Wilderness the cypress wreath--      All these have passed away.  The life in the veins of Treason lags,  Her daring color-bearers drop their flags,    And yield. _Now_ shall we fire?      Can poor spite be?  Shall nobleness in victory less aspire  Than in reverse? Spare Spleen her ire,    And think how Grant met Lee.        The Muster:[17]  Suggested by the Two Days' Review at Washington  (May, 1865.)      The Abrahamic river--    Patriarch of floods,  Calls the roll of all his streams    And watery mutitudes:        Torrent cries to torrent,          The rapids hail the fall;        With shouts the inland freshets          Gather to the call.        The quotas of the Nation,        Like the water-shed of waves,      Muster into union--        Eastern warriors, Western braves.        Martial strains are mingling,        Though distant far the bands,      And the wheeling of the squadrons        Is like surf upon the sands.        The bladed guns are gleaming--        Drift in lengthened trim,      Files on files for hazy miles--        Nebulously dim.        O Milky Way of armies--        Star rising after star,      New banners of the Commonwealths,        And eagles of the War.    The Abrahamic river    To sea-wide fullness fed,  Pouring from the thaw-lands    By the God of floods is led:        His deep enforcing current          The streams of ocean own,        And Europe's marge is evened          By rills from Kansas lone.        Aurora-Borealis.  Commemorative of the Dissolution of Armies at the Peace.  (May, 1865.)      What power disbands the Northern Lights    After their steely play?  The lonely watcher feels an awe    Of Nature's sway,      As when appearing,      He marked their flashed uprearing  In the cold gloom--    Retreatings and advancings,  (Like dallyings of doom),    Transitions and enhancings,      And bloody ray.    The phantom-host has faded quite,    Splendor and Terror gone--  Portent or promise--and gives way    To pale, meek Dawn;      The coming, going,      Alike in wonder showing--  Alike the God,    Decreeing and commanding  The million blades that glowed,    The muster and disbanding--      Midnight and Morn.        The Released Rebel Prisoner.[18]  (June, 1865.)      Armies he's seen--the herds of war,    But never such swarms of men  As now in the Nineveh of the North--    How mad the Rebellion then!    And yet but dimly he divines    The depth of that deceit,  And superstition of vast pride    Humbled to such defeat.    Seductive shone the Chiefs in arms--    His steel the nearest magnet drew;  Wreathed with its kind, the Gulf-weed drives--    'Tis Nature's wrong they rue.    His face is hidden in his beard,    But his heart peers out at eye--  And such a heart! like mountain-pool    Where no man passes by.    He thinks of Hill--a brave soul gone;    And Ashby dead in pale disdain;  And Stuart with the Rupert-plume,    Whose blue eye never shall laugh again.    He hears the drum; he sees our boys    From his wasted fields return;  Ladies feast them on strawberries,    And even to kiss them yearn.    He marks them bronzed, in soldier-trim,    The rifle proudly borne;  They bear it for an heir-loom home,    And he--disarmed--jail-worn.    Home, home--his heart is full of it;    But home he never shall see,  Even should he stand upon the spot;    'Tis gone!--where his brothers be.    The cypress-moss from tree to tree    Hangs in his Southern land;  As weird, from thought to thought of his    Run memories hand in hand.    And so he lingers--lingers on    In the City of the Foe--  His cousins and his countrymen    Who see him listless go.        A Grave near Petersburg, Virginia.[19]      Head-board and foot-board duly placed--    Grassed in the mound between;  Daniel Drouth is the slumberer's name--    Long may his grave be green!    Quick was his way--a flash and a blow,    Full of his fire was he--  A fire of hell--'tis burnt out now--    Green may his grave long be!    May his grave be green, though he    Was a rebel of iron mould;  Many a true heart--true to the Cause,    Through the blaze of his wrath lies cold.    May his grave be green--still green    While happy years shall run;  May none come nigh to disinter    The--_Buried Gun_.        \"Formerly a Slave.\"  An idealized Portrait, by E. Vedder, in the Spring  Exhibition of the National Academy, 1865.      The sufferance of her race is shown,    And retrospect of life,  Which now too late deliverance dawns upon;    Yet is she not at strife.    Her children's children they shall know    The good withheld from her;  And so her reverie takes prophetic cheer--    In spirit she sees the stir    Far down the depth of thousand years,    And marks the revel shine;  Her dusky face is lit with sober light,    Sibylline, yet benign.        The Apparition.  (A Retrospect.)      Convulsions came; and, where the field    Long slept in pastoral green,  A goblin-mountain was upheaved  (Sure the scared sense was all deceived),    Marl-glen and slag-ravine.    The unreserve of Ill was there,    The clinkers in her last retreat;  But, ere the eye could take it in,  Or mind could comprehension win,    It sunk!--and at our feet.    So, then, Solidity's a crust--    The core of fire below;  All may go well for many a year,  But who can think without a fear    Of horrors that happen so?        Magnanimity Baffled.      \"Sharp words we had before the fight;      But--now the fight is done--  Look, here's my hand,\" said the Victor bold,      \"Take it--an honest one!  What, holding back? I mean you well;    Though worsted, you strove stoutly, man;  The odds were great; I honor you;      Man honors man.    \"Still silent, friend? can grudges be?      Yet am I held a foe?--  Turned to the wall, on his cot he lies--      Never I'll leave him so!  Brave one! I here implore your hand;    Dumb still? all fellowship fled?  Nay, then, I'll have this stubborn hand\"    He snatched it--it was dead.        On the Slain Collegians.[20]      Youth is the time when hearts are large,      And stirring wars  Appeal to the spirit which appeals in turn      To the blade it draws.  If woman incite, and duty show    (Though made the mask of Cain),  Or whether it be Truth's sacred cause,      Who can aloof remain  That shares youth's ardor, uncooled by the snow      Of wisdom or sordid gain?    The liberal arts and nurture sweet  Which give his gentleness to man--    Train him to honor, lend him grace  Through bright examples meet--  That culture which makes never wan  With underminings deep, but holds    The surface still, its fitting place,    And so gives sunniness to the face  And bravery to the heart; what troops    Of generous boys in happiness thus bred--    Saturnians through life's Tempe led,  Went from the North and came from the South,  With golden mottoes in the mouth,    To lie down midway on a bloody bed.    Woe for the homes of the North,  And woe for the seats of the South;  All who felt life's spring in prime,  And were swept by the wind of their place and time--    All lavish hearts, on whichever side,  Of birth urbane or courage high,  Armed them for the stirring wars--  Armed them--some to die.      Apollo-like in pride,  Each would slay his Python--caught  The maxims in his temple taught--    Aflame with sympathies whose blaze  Perforce enwrapped him--social laws,    Friendship and kin, and by-gone days--  Vows, kisses--every heart unmoors,  And launches into the seas of wars.

So be it; but they both were young--  Each grape to his cluster clung,  All their elegies are sung.    The anguish of maternal hearts    Must search for balm divine;  But well the striplings bore their fated parts    (The heavens all parts assign)--  Never felt life's care or cloy.

The dark hand which held the tomahawk trembled so that little glints  of moonlight glanced from the bright steel.    From far back in the forest-deeps came that same low moaning:    \"Um-m-mm-woo-o-o-o!\"    It rose from a faint murmur and swelled to a deep moan, soft but  clear, and ended in a wail like that of a lost soul.    The break it made in that dead silence was awful. Joe's blood seemed  to have curdled and frozen; a cold sweat oozed from his skin, and it  was as if a clammy hand clutched at his heart. He tried to persuade  himself that the fear displayed by the savage was only superstition,  and that that moan was but the sigh of the night wind.    The Indian sentinel stood as if paralyzed an instant after that  weird cry, and then, swift as a flash, and as noiseless, he was gone  into the gloomy forest. He had fled without awakening his  companions.    Once more the moaning cry arose and swelled mournfully on the still  night air. It was close at hand!    \"The Wind of Death,\" whispered Joe.    He was shaken and unnerved by the events of the past two days, and  dazed from his wound. His strength deserted him, and he lost  consciousness.        Chapter VI.    One evening, several day previous to the capture of the brothers, a  solitary hunter stopped before a deserted log cabin which stood on  the bank of a stream fifty miles or more inland from the Ohio River.  It was rapidly growing dark; a fine, drizzling rain had set in, and  a rising wind gave promise of a stormy night.    Although the hunter seemed familiar with his surroundings, he moved  cautiously, and hesitated as if debating whether he should seek the  protection of this lonely hut, or remain all night under dripping  trees. Feeling of his hunting frock, he found that it was damp and  slippery. This fact evidently decided him in favor of the cabin, for  he stooped his tall figure and went in. It was pitch dark inside;  but having been there before, the absence of a light did not trouble  him. He readily found the ladder leading to the loft, ascended it,  and lay down to sleep.    During the night a noise awakened him. For a moment he heard nothing  except the fall of the rain. Then came the hum of voices, followed  by the soft tread of moccasined feet. He knew there was an Indian  town ten miles across the country, and believed some warriors,  belated on a hunting trip, had sought the cabin for shelter.    The hunter lay perfectly quiet, awaiting developments. If the  Indians had flint and steel, and struck a light, he was almost  certain to be discovered. He listened to their low conversation, and  understood from the language that they were Delawares.    A moment later he heard the rustling of leaves and twigs,  accompanied by the metallic click of steel against some hard  substance. The noise was repeated, and then followed by a hissing  sound, which he knew to be the burning of a powder on a piece of dry  wood, after which rays of light filtered through cracks of the  unstable floor of the loft.    The man placed his eye to one of these crevices, and counted eleven  Indians, all young braves, with the exception of the chief. The  Indians had been hunting; they had haunches of deer and buffalo  tongues, together with several packs of hides. Some of them busied  themselves drying their weapons; others sat down listlessly, plainly  showing their weariness, and two worked over the smouldering fire.  The damp leaves and twigs burned faintly, yet there was enough to  cause the hunter fear that he might be discovered. He believed he  had not much to worry about from the young braves, but the hawk-eyed  chief was dangerous.    And he was right. Presently the stalwart chief heard, or saw, a drop  of water fall from the loft. It came from the hunter's wet coat.  Almost any one save an Indian scout would have fancied this came  from the roof. As the chief's gaze roamed everywhere over the  interior of the cabin his expression was plainly distrustful. His  eye searched the wet clay floor, but hardly could have discovered  anything there, because the hunter's moccasined tracks had been  obliterated by the footprints of the Indians. The chief's suspicions  seemed to be allayed.    But in truth this chief, with the wonderful sagacity natural to  Indians, had observed matters which totally escaped the young  braves, and, like a wily old fox, he waited to see which cub would  prove the keenest. Not one of them, however, noted anything unusual.  They sat around the fire, ate their meat and parched corn, and  chatted volubly.    The chief arose and, walking to the ladder, ran his hand along one  of the rungs.    \"Ugh!\" he exclaimed.    Instantly he was surrounded by ten eager, bright-eyed braves. He  extended his open palm; it was smeared with wet clay like that under  his feet. Simultaneously with their muttered exclamations the braves  grasped their weapons. They knew there was a foe above them. It was  a paleface, for an Indian would have revealed himself.    The hunter, seeing he was discovered, acted with the unerring  judgment and lightning-like rapidity of one long accustomed to  perilous situations. Drawing his tomahawk and noiselessly stepping  to the hole in the loft, he leaped into the midst of the astounded  Indians.    Rising from the floor like the rebound of a rubber ball, his long  arm with the glittering hatchet made a wide sweep, and the young  braves scattered like frightened sheep.    He made a dash for the door and, incredible as it may seem, his  movements were so quick he would have escaped from their very midst  without a scratch but for one unforeseen circumstance. The clay  floor was wet and slippery; his feet were hardly in motion before  they slipped from under him and he fell headlong.    With loud yells of triumph the band jumped upon him. There was a  convulsive, heaving motion of the struggling mass, one frightful cry  of agony, and then hoarse commands. Three of the braves ran to their  packs, from which they took cords of buckskin. So exceedingly  powerful was the hunter that six Indians were required to hold him  while the others tied his hands and feet. Then, with grunts and  chuckles of satisfaction, they threw him into a corner of the cabin.    Two of the braves had been hurt in the brief struggle, one having a  badly wrenched shoulder and the other a broken arm. So much for the  hunter's power in that single moment of action.    The loft was searched, and found to be empty. Then the excitement  died away, and the braves settled themselves down for the night. The  injured ones bore their hurts with characteristic stoicism; if they  did not sleep, both remained quiet and not a sigh escaped them.    The wind changed during the night, the storm abated, and when  daylight came the sky was cloudless. The first rays of the sun shone  in the open door, lighting up the interior of the cabin.    A sleepy Indian who had acted as guard stretched his limbs and  yawned. He looked for the prisoner, and saw him sitting up in the  corner. One arm was free, and the other nearly so. He had almost  untied the thongs which bound him; a few moments more and he would  have been free.    \"Ugh!\" exclaimed the young brave, awakening his chief and pointing  to the hunter.    The chief glanced at his prisoner; then looked more closely, and  with one spring was on his feet, a drawn tomahawk in his hand. A  short, shrill yell issued from his lips. Roused by that clarion  call, the young braves jumped up, trembling in eager excitement. The  chief's summons had been the sharp war-cry of the Delawares.    He manifested as intense emotion as could possibly have been  betrayed by a matured, experienced chieftain, and pointing to the  hunter, he spoke a single word.                    *       *       *    At noonday the Indians entered the fields of corn which marked the  outskirts of the Delaware encampment.    \"Kol-loo--kol-loo--kol-loo.\"    The long signal, heralding the return of the party with important  news, pealed throughout the quiet valley; and scarcely had the  echoes died away when from the village came answering shouts.    Once beyond the aisles of waving corn the hunter saw over the  shoulders of his captors the home of the redmen. A grassy plain,  sloping gradually from the woody hill to a winding stream, was  brightly beautiful with chestnut trees and long, well-formed lines  of lodges. Many-hued blankets hung fluttering in the sun, and rising  lazily were curling columns of blue smoke. The scene was picturesque  and reposeful; the vivid hues suggesting the Indians love of color  and ornament; the absence of life and stir, his languorous habit of  sleeping away the hot noonday hours.    The loud whoops, however, changed the quiet encampment into a scene  of animation. Children ran from the wigwams, maidens and braves  dashed here and there, squaws awakened from their slumber, and many  a doughty warrior rose from his rest in the shade. French fur  traders came curiously from their lodges, and renegades hurriedly  left their blankets, roused to instant action by the well-known  summons.    The hunter, led down the lane toward the approaching crowd,  presented a calm and fearless demeanor. When the Indians surrounded  him one prolonged, furious yell rent the air, and then followed an  extraordinary demonstration of fierce delight. The young brave's  staccato yell, the maiden's scream, the old squaw's screech, and the  deep war-cry of the warriors intermingled in a fearful discordance.    Often had this hunter heard the name which the Indian called him; he  had been there before, a prisoner; he had run the gauntlet down the  lane; he had been bound to a stake in front of the lodge where his  captors were now leading him. He knew the chief, Wingenund, sachem  of the Delawares. Since that time, now five years ago, when  Wingenund"]]]
