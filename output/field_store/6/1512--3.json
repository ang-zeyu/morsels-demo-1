No, it's another prize I'm thinking about.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Well, I see by this paper that the Touring Club of America has offered  three thousand dollars for the speediest electric car.  The tests are  to come off this fall, on a new and specially built track on Long  Island, and it's to be an endurance contest for twenty-four hours, or a  race for distance, they haven't yet decided. But I'm going to have a  try for it, dad, and, besides winning the prize, I think I'll take Andy  Foger down a peg.    \"What's Andy been doing now?\"    \"Oh, nothing more than usual. He's always mean, and looking for a  chance to make trouble for me, but I didn't refer to anything special.  He has a new auto, you know, and he boasts that it's the fastest one in  this country. I'll show him that it isn't, for I'm going to win this  prize with the speediest car on the road.\"    \"But, Tom, you haven't any automobile, you know,\" and Mr. Swift looked  anxiously at his son, who was smiling confidently. \"You can't be going  to make your motor-cycle into an auto; are you?\"    \"No, dad.\"    \"Then how are you going to take part in the prize contest?  Besides,  electric cars, as far as I know, aren't specially speedy.\"    \"I know it, and one reason why this club has arranged the contest is to  improve the quality of electric automobiles. I'm going to build an  electric runabout, dad.\"    \"An electric runabout?  But it will have to be operated with a storage  battery, Tom, and you haven't--\"    \"I guess you're going to say I haven't any storage battery, dad,\"  interrupted Mr. Swift's son. \"Well, I haven't yet, but I'm going to  have one. I've been working on--\"    \"Oh, ho!\" exclaimed the aged inventor with a laugh. \"So that's what  you've been tinkering over these last few weeks, eh, Tom?  I suspected  it was some new invention, but I didn't suppose it was that. Well, how  are you coming on with it?\"    \"Pretty good, I think. I've got a new idea for a battery, and I made an  experimental one. I gave it some pretty severe tests, and it worked  fine.\"    \"But you haven't tried it out in a car yet, over rough roads, and under  severe conditions have you?\"    \"No, I haven't had a chance. In fact, when I invented the battery I had  no idea of using it on a car I thought it might answer for commercial  purposes, or for storing a current generated by windmills. But when I  read that account in the papers of the Touring Club, offering a prize  for the best electric car, it occurred to me that I might put my  battery into an auto, and win.\"    \"Hum,\" remarked Mr. Swift musingly. \"I don't take much stock in  electric autos, Tom. Gasolene seems to be the best, or perhaps steam,  generated by gasolene. I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.  All the  electric runabouts I ever saw, while they were very nice cars, didn't  seem able to go so very fast, or very far.\"    \"That's true, but it's because they didn't have the right kind of a  battery. You know an electric locomotive can make pretty good speed,  Dad. Over a hundred miles an hour in tests.\"    \"Yes, but they don't run by storage batteries. They have a third rail,  and powerful motors,\" and Mr. Swift looked quizzically at his son. He  loved to argue with him, for he said it made Tom think, and often the  two would thus thresh out some knotty point of an invention, to the  interests of both.    \"Of course, Dad, there is a good deal of theory in what I'm thinking  of,\" the lad admitted. \"But it does seem to me that if you put the  right kind of a battery into an automobile, it could scoot along pretty  lively. Look what speed a trolley car can make.\"    \"Yes, Tom, but there again they get their power from an overhead wire.\"    \"Some of them don't. There's a new storage battery been invented by a  New Jersey man, which does as well as the third rail or the overhead  wire. It was after reading about his battery that I thought of a plan  for mine. It isn't anything like his; perhaps not as good in some ways,  but, for what I want, it is better in some respects, I think. For one  thing it can be recharged very quickly.\"    \"Now Tom, look here,\" said Mr. Swift earnestly, laying aside his  papers, and coming over to where his son sat. \"You know I never  interfere with your inventions. In fact, the more you think of the  better I like it. The airship you helped build certainly did all that  could be desired, and--\"    \"That reminds me. Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon are out in it now,\"  interrupted Tom. \"They ought to be back soon. Yes, Dad, the airship Red  Cloud certainly scooted along.\"    \"And the submarine, too,\" continued the aged inventor. \"Your ideas  regarding that were of service to me, and helped in our task of  recovering the treasure, but I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed  in the storage battery. You may get it to work, but I don't believe you  can make it powerful enough to attain any great speed. Why don't you  confine yourself to making a battery for stationary work?\"    \"Because, Dad, I believe I can build a speedy car, and I'm going to try  it. Besides I want to race Andy Foger, and beat him, even if I don't  win the prize. I'm going to build that car, and it will make fast time.\"    \"Well, go ahead, Tom,\" responded his father, after a pause. \"Of course  you can use the shops here as much as you want, and Mr. Sharp, Mr.  Jackson, and I will help you all we can. Only don't be disappointed,  that's all.\"    \"I won't, Dad. Suppose you come out to my shop and I'll show you a  sample battery I've been testing for the last week. I have it geared to  a small motor, and it's been running steadily for some time. I want to  see what sort of a record it's made.\"    Father and son crossed the yard, and entered a shop which the lad  considered exclusively his own. There he had made many machines, and  pieces of apparatus, and had invented a number of articles which had  been patented, and yielded him considerable of an income.    \"There's the battery, Dad,\" he said, pointing to a complicated  mechanism in one corner.    \"What's that buzzing noise?\" asked Mr. Swift. \"That's the little motor  I run from the new cells. Look here,\" and Tom switched on an electric  light above the experimental battery, from which he hoped so much. It  consisted of a steel can, about the size of the square gallon tin in  which maple syrup comes, and from it ran two wires which were attached  to a small motor that was industriously whirring away.    Tom looked at a registering gauge connected with it.    \"That's pretty good,\" remarked the young inventor.    \"What is it, Tom?\" and his father peered about the shop.    \"Why this motor has run an equivalent of two hundred miles on one  charging of the battery! That's much better than I expected.  I thought  if I got a hundred out of it I'd be doing well. Dad, I believe, after I  improve my battery a bit, that I'll have the very thing I want!  I'll  install a set of them in a car, and it will go like the wind. I'll--\"  Tom's enthusiastic remarks were suddenly interrupted by a low, rumbling  sound.    \"Thunder!\" exclaimed Mr. Swift. \"The storm is coming, and Mr. Sharp and  Mr. Damon in the airship--\"    Hardly had he spoken than there sounded a crash on the roof of the  Swift house, not far away. At the same time there came cries of  distress, and the crash was repeated.    \"Come on, Dad!  Something has happened!\" yelled Tom, dashing from the  shop, followed by his parent. They found themselves in the midst of a  rain storm, as they raced toward the house, on the roof of which the  smashing noise was again heard.          CHAPTER II    MR. DAMON'S STEERING      Tom Swift was a lad of action, and his quickness in hurrying out to  investigate what had happened when he was explaining about his new  battery, was characteristic of him. Those of my readers who know him,  through having read the previous books of this series, need not be told  this, but you who, perhaps, are just making his acquaintance, may care  to know a little more about him.    As told in my first book, \"Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle\" the young  inventor lived with his father, Barton Swift, a widower, in the town of  Shopton, New York. Mr. Swift was also an inventor of note.    In my initial volume of this series, Tom became possessed of a  motor-cycle in a peculiar way. It was sold to him by a Mr. Wakefield  Damon, a wealthy gentleman who was unfortunate in riding it. On his  speedy machine, which Tom improved by several inventions, he had a  number of adventures.

So emphatic, in fact, was the  summons that the door trembled, and Tom started to his feet in some  alarm.    \"Hello there!\" he cried. \"Don't break the door, Koku!\" and then he  laughed. \"No one but my giant would knock like that,\" he said to  himself. \"He never does seem able to do things gently. But I wonder why  he is knocking. I told him to get the engine out of the airship, and  Eradicate said he'd be around to answer the telephone and bell. I  wonder if anything has happened?\"    Tom shoved back his chair, pushed aside the mass of papers over which  he had been puzzling, and strode to the door.  Flinging it open he  confronted a veritable giant of a man, nearly eight feet tall, and big  in proportion. The giant, Koku, for that was his name, smiled in a  good-natured way, reminding one of an overgrown boy.    \"Master hear my knock?\" the giant asked cheerfully.    \"Hear you, Koku? Say, I couldn't hear anything else!\" exclaimed Tom.  \"Did you think you had to arouse the whole neighborhood just to let me  know you were at the door? Jove!  I thought you'd have it off the  hinges.\"    \"If me break, me fix,\" said Koku, who, from his appearance and from his  imperfect command of English, was evidently a foreigner.    \"Yes, I know you can fix lots of things, Koku,\" Tom went on, kindly  enough. \"But you musn't forget what enormous strength you have. That's  the reason I sent you to take the engine out of the airship. You can  lift it without using the chain hoist, and I can't get the chain hoist  fast unless I remove all the superstructure. I don't want to do that.  Did you get the engine out?\"    \"Not quite. Almost, Master.\"    \"Then why are you here? Has anything gone wrong?\"    \"No, everything all right, Master.  But man come to machine shop and  say he must have talk with you. I no let him come past the gate, but I  say I come and call you.\"    \"That's right, Koku. Don't let any strangers past the gate. But why  didn't Eradicate come and call me. He isn't doing anything, is he?  Unless, indeed, he has gone to feed his mule, Boomerang.\"    \"Eradicate, he come to call you, but that black man no good!\" and Koku  chuckled so heartily that he shook the floor of the office.    \"What's the matter with Eradicate?\" asked Tom, somewhat anxiously. \"I  hope you and he haven't had another row?\" Eradicate had served Tom and  his father long before Koku, the giant, had been brought back from one  of the young inventor's many strange trips, and ever since then there  had been a jealous rivalry between the twain as to who should best  serve Tom.    \"No trouble, Master,\" said Koku. \"Eradicate he start to come and tell  you strange man want to have talk, but Eradicate he no come fast  enough. So I pick him up, and I set him down by gate to stand on guard,  and I come to tell you. Koku come quick!\"    \"Oh, I knew it must be something like that!\" exclaimed Tom in some  vexation. \"Now I'll have Eradicate complaining to me that you mauled  him. Picked him up and set him down again.\"    \"Sure. One hand!\" boasted the giant. \"Eradicate him not be heavy. More  as a sack of flour now.\"    \"No, poor Eradicate is getting pretty old and thin,\" commented Tom. \"He  can't move very quickly. But you should have let him come, Koku. It  makes him feel badly when he thinks he can't be of service to me any  more.\"    \"Man say he in hurry.\" The giant spoke softly, as though he felt the  gentle rebuke Tom administered. \"Koku run quick tell you--bang on door.\"    \"Yes, you banged all right, Koku. Well, it can't be helped, I reckon.  Where is this strange man? Who is he? Did you ever see him before?\"    \"Me no can tell, Master. Not sure. But him now be at the outer gate.  Eradicate watch.\"    \"All right. I'll go and see who it is. I don't want any strangers  poking around here, especially with the plans of my new gyroscope lying  in plain view.\"    Before he left the laboratory Tom swept into a desk drawer the mass of  papers and blue prints, and locked the receptacle.    \"No use taking any chances,\" he remarked. \"I've had too much trouble  with people trying to get inside information about dad's and my  patents. Now, Koku, I'll go and see this man.\"    The buildings composing the plant of Tom Swift and his father at  Shopton were enclosed by a high, board fence, and at one of the  entrances was a sort of gate-house, where some one was always on guard.  Only those who could give a good account of themselves, workmen in the  plant, or those known to the sentinel were admitted.    It happened that the colored man, Eradicate, was on guard at the gates  this day when the stranger asked to see Tom.  Koku, working on the  airship engine not far away, saw the stranger. Hearing the man say he  was in a hurry and noting the slow progress of the aged Eradicate, who  was troubled with rheumatism, the giant took matters into his own hands.    Tom Swift entered the gate-house and saw, seated in a chair, a man who  was impatiently tapping the floor with his thick-soled shoe.    \"Looks like a detective or a policeman in disguise,\" thought Tom, for,  almost invariably, members of this profession wear very thick-soled  shoes. Opposite the stranger sat Eradicate, a much-injured look on his  honest, black face.    \"Oh, Massa Tom!\" exclaimed Eradicate, as soon as the young inventor  entered. \"Dat Koku he--he--he done gone and cotch me by de collar ob  mah coat, an' den he lif' me up, an' he sot me down so hard--so  hard--dat he jar loose all mah back teef!\" and Eradicate opened his  mouth wide to display his gleaming ivories.    \"Eradicate, he no can come quick. He walk like so fashion!\" and Koku,  who had followed the young inventor, imitated the limping gait of the  colored man with such a queer effect that Tom could not help laughing,  and the stranger smiled.    \"Ef I gits holt on yo'--ef I does, yo' great, big, overgrown lummox,  Ah'll--Ah'll--\" began the colored man, stammeringly.    \"There. That will do now!\" interrupted Tom. \"Don't quarrel in here.  Koku, get back to that engine and lift out the motor. Eradicate, didn't  father tell you to whitewash the chicken coops to-day?\"    \"Dat's what he done, Massa Tom.\"    \"Well, go and see about that. I'll stay here for a while, and when I  leave I'll call one of you, or some one else, to be on guard. Skip now!\"    Having thus disposed of the warring factions, Tom turned to the  stranger and after apologizing for the little interruption, asked:    \"You wished to see me?\"    \"If you're Tom Swift; yes.\"    \"Well, I'm Tom Swift,\" and the young owner of the name smiled.    \"I hope you will pardon a stranger for calling on you,\" resumed the  man, \"but I'm in a lot of trouble, and I think you are the only one who  can help me out.\"    \"What sort of trouble?\" Tom inquired.    \"Contracting trouble--tunnel blasting, to be exact. But if you have a  few minutes to spare perhaps you will listen to my story. You will then  be better able to understand my difficulty.\"    Tom Swift considered a moment. He was used to having appeals for help  made to him, and usually they were of a begging nature. He was often  asked for money to help some struggling inventor complete his machine.    In many cases the machines would have been of absolutely no use if  perfected. In other cases the inventions were of the utterly hopeless  class, incapable of perfection, like some perpetual motion apparatus.  In these cases Tom turned a deaf ear, though if the inventor were in  want our hero relieved him.    But this case did not seem to be like anything Tom had ever met with  before.    \"Contracting trouble--blasting,\" repeated the youth, as he mused over  what he had heard.    \"That's it,\" the man went on. \"Permit me to introduce myself\" and he  held out a card, on which was the name    MR. JOB TITUS      Down in the lower left-hand corner was a line:    \"Titus Brothers, Contractors.\"    \"I am glad to meet you, Mr. Titus,\" Tom said warmly, offering his hand.  \"I don't know anything about the contracting business, but if you do  blasting I suppose you use explosives, and I know a little about them.\"    \"So I have heard, and that's why I came to you,\" the contractor went  on. \"Now if you'll give me a few minutes of your time--\"    \"You had better come up to the house,\" interrupted Tom.  \"We can talk  more quietly there.\"    Calling a young fellow who was at work near by to occupy the  gate-house, Tom led Mr. Titus toward the Swift homestead, and, a little  later, ushered him into the library.    \"Now I'll listen to you,\" the youth said, \"though I can't promise to  aid you.\"    \"I realize that,\" returned Mr. Titus. \"This is a sort of last chance  I'm taking. My brother and I have heard a lot about you, and when he  wrote to me that he was unable to proceed with his contract of  tunneling the Andes Mountains for the Peruvian government, I made up my  mind you were the one who could help us if you would.\"    \"Tunneling the Andes Mountains!\" exclaimed Tom.    \"Yes.
