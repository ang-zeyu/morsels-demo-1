A peculiar feature of this storm was that it was not at all general; at  the neighbouring \"estancias\" it was not felt at all, and some of the  \"peons,\" who were riding in the camp at the time, said they could see  this whirlwind coming a long way off at a tremendous rate and that it  looked like a column of red smoke; they could not feel the effects of  the wind either, although they were not more than half a mile away.    This storm was followed by very heavy rains which lasted for about ten  days, during which our house was flooded, as the wind had lifted the  tiles and the rain was driven in through every possible place.    Another time, when driving home from the town of Vernado Tuerto, we were  caught in a very bad dust storm. Things became so black that we could  not see where we were going, so we had to halt. The wind was so strong  that the men had to get out of the carriage, which was a heavy  covered-in waggonette, and hold the wheels down to prevent it from being  overturned. We all looked like seaside niggers, as the dust and rain  falling at once came down like mud on us all. One gets quite hardened to  these severe storms. On one occasion a very rough wind began to blow,  but, as it was a steady gale, no one took particular notice of it. It  was after dinner, and everybody was busy playing cards. The wind made  such a deafening noise that you could hardly hear yourself speak;  presently some of the occupants of the house thought they would have a  look outside to see if things were all right; when they were surprised  to see an outer building, used for stores and machinery, roofless, and  the roof nowhere to be seen; it was discovered afterwards on the top of  their own house, and they had never heard it happen.    The climate in the Argentine is very variable; we have great extremes of  heat and cold. It is healthy as a rule, except in the swampy districts  or during a very wet season, when a great many residents suffer from  rheumatism.    People talk about the sudden changes of English weather, but we are  treated just the same; one day it will be brilliantly hot and fine, and  another day cold and miserable.    One part of the country or another is generally suffering from drought,  when in another part they are being flooded out.    In the winter there is much more sunshine than there is in England; in  the early morning it is bitterly cold, at noon on a fine day it is  blazing hot, and then, as soon as the sun goes in, it freezes hard.    In the summer, of course, the heat is very great, but, as it is  generally dry, it is quite healthy.          SOME EXPERIENCES OF WORKING ON ESTANCIAS.    I came out with my brother on a tramp steamer from Penarth. We took  thirty-one days. However, time passed fairly quickly, chipping off rust  and painting the decks, after we got over our sickness.    Rain fell heavily as we landed at Buenos Aires, two typical _gringos_  (greenhorns), not knowing a word of Spanish. I went to a first-class  hotel, whose proprietor I had met in England. My first attempt to speak  Spanish was in a tram. I asked the conductor to stop; getting out I  said, \"Mucha grasa\" (much fat), instead of \"muchas gracias\" (many  thanks)--then called the man a fool for laughing.    We stopped in Buenos Aires a week and our bill came into hundreds of  dollars, which took a big slice off our small means.    We then went to an estancia (farm) in the Province of Cordoba. The  estancia was fifty-one miles square, owned by an Argentine family. The  manager was a North-American, well known in camp life.    The estancia consisted of three sections, one where I went, another  where my brother was, and the other the headquarters.    I was under a young Scotchman. The camp was fifteen miles, with 3,000  cows, 2,000 steers, and 500 mares. There was my companion, one peon  (man), a boy, and myself. My house was made of mud walls and floor, a  zinc roof, with a little straw. It was cool in summer, but very cold in  winter. There was one room for ourselves, where we slept and ate, one  for the cook (when we had one), and a kitchen. Under my bed I had a  snake's hole; a long black snake came out in the night, and, on hearing  a sound, would go back. I did everything to kill it, but with no  success. Also I had two kittens which slept in my bed. One night I felt  something soft by my feet. I thought it was the kittens, but, putting my  hand down, I found my feet covered with blood. I jumped out of bed, and  found a young hare half eaten and my sheets covered with blood.    The first thing I had to do was to skin a cow, and it made me feel very  uncomfortable to look at the horrid sight. The next day I was sent to  fetch the fat from a dead cow. When I got there I could not see any fat  and wondered what it was. I saw the intestines and carried them bodily  on my new recado (native saddle). My horse got excited and I arrived  dead beat. I told my companion I had the fat: then he burst out laughing  and said I had got the intestines. Needless to say my recado was the  worse for wear.    The food was different from what I was used to, and I felt ill for a  time.    In the summer I was up at between three and four, having \"mate-cocido\"  (cooked Paraguayan tea--the native drink) with a hard biscuit; at  eleven, breakfast of puchero (big pieces of meat boiled in a pot), then  maize with milk and a biscuit. Sometimes tea at four, but very seldom;  supper consisted of an asado and mate at seven or eight o'clock.    I had charge of two valuable stallions--they had a stable of mud and  straw.    At branding time the capataz (foreman) came up with his men for a week.  Up before three o'clock, quite dark, we branded 6,000 calves, and I  enjoyed it.    The Boss seldom came; when he did, his trap would be sure to run over a  piece of wire, and then we heard of it; nothing missed him.    Then our cook began stealing provisions from the store box. We changed  the locks three times, and each time she bought a key to the same. One  night I asked her for some coffee. She said there was none. I could see  she had some in a small bag, and I went to fetch it. She took up a knife  and threatened me. I soon twisted the knife from her. Our food was bad,  my companion was careless, and frightened of her. One day he had a row,  and she got the sack, using strong language. We then did our own cooking  for eight months: the first one home from camp had to begin cooking.    The meat we got was often green and bitter. All the time we had puchero  and asado, and an occasional ostrich egg.    Ostriches swarmed everywhere, and it was good sport lassoing them. I  found one nest with fifty eggs, laid by different birds. My cooking was  rather a failure at first, the smoke was so thick we could not see each  other. I was told to cook maize for dinner. I made a big fire, and  cooked for three hours, and was then told I had the stallions' maize.  Another time it was very dark; our candles, made of old clothes and  grease, had run out. I had made some good soup, and put the pot near the  table, then, walking by, put my foot in it: the hot grease made me hop,  and took the skin off my foot. Our table was an old greasy box; we had  no plates, nor forks, just a big knife. Sometimes, coming in very tired  from a hard day, we had no strength to chop wood and make a fire; we  just went to bed. Many days we only had an asado and mate. Mate I am  very fond of--it is so refreshing and sustaining.    My brother was only eight miles away: his section was under alfalfa, and  he had a comfortable house. One dark night, going home from his place, I  followed a fence until I came to a cross fence. I was going slowly,  when, all of a sudden, my horse stopped dead, and I shot over the fence,  the bridle and halter came off, and away went my horse, leaving me to  continue five miles on foot.    Bizcachas (like a big badger) were numerous. One day we dug a two-metre  hole, and next day found eight live ones. They have teeth one and a-half  inches long.    Our nearest village was eighteen miles away, where I met some English  friends, and played tennis or had some other amusement. I used to start  back at 2.30 a.m. to be in time for work. One night I had to cross a big  field, without a path or fence for a guide. It was dark, and lightning  hard. I made for a light, which I thought was the house. Going for some  time, I came to a fence--I was lost. I unsaddled and lay down to sleep,  the rain was pouring hard, when I heard a donkey braying, so I shouted,  and was answered by a man in a puesto (out-station). The light I saw was  a village twelve miles away.    My companion was very slack, and the patrons came up and sacked him.    Then I went to the estancia house for a month, breaking in colts for  driving. I felt rather sad at leaving my rough work. It was hard work,  but I never had better health.    My Boss then earned $15 per month, and his wife cooked for the men. Now  he is one of the richest men in the country.    There was no opening there, so the Boss sent me to a New Zealander who  had half a league of camp, all fine stock, good alfalfa and splendid  water. He had a big house and I expected I would live well. My first  work was to dig up locusts' eggs for a week under a hot sun, with the  ground very hard. The Boss was a man of forty-two, very red-faced and  extremely rich, but as mean as possible.    Our meals took about six to eight minutes, fast eating; he would watch  every mouthful. At tea he would take a lot of milk and give me a little;  he finished soon, while I burnt my throat. He allowed me a slice of  biscuit for each meal. His cook only got $10 a month.    In the winter we were in bed by six to seven.    His clothes were a disgrace to any peon. He had native trousers that  button at the foot, with top boots, no socks, his heel and big toe were  sticking out, no vest, only a shirt and an old hat, where the grease of  many years was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14368"],[0,"Hebraic Literature; Translations from the Talmud, Midrashim and Kabbala (#10)"],[1,"person twice; as it is written (Gen. xli. 32), \"And for that  the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice.\"    Ibid., fol. 55, col. 2.    Three things tranquilize the mind of man:--Melody, scenery, and sweet  odor. Three things develop the mind of man:--A fine house, a handsome  wife, and elegant furniture.    Ibid., fol. 57, col. 2.    The Rabbis have taught that there are three sorts of dropsy:--Thick,  resulting from sin; bloated, in consequence of insufficient food; and  thin, due to sorcery.    _Shabbath_, fol. 33, col. 1.    These three grow stronger as they grow older:--The fish, the serpent,  and the pig.    Ibid., fol. 77, col. 2.    It were better to cut the hands off than to touch the eye, or the nose,  or the mouth, or the ear, etc., with them without having first washed  them. Unwashed hands may cause blindness, deafness, foulness of breath,  or a polypus. It is taught that Rabbi Nathan has said, \"The evil spirit  Bath Chorin, which rests upon the hands at night, is very strict; he  will not depart till water is poured upon the hands three times over.\"    Ibid. fol. 109, col. 1.        The great importance of this ceremonial washing of the hands      will appear from the following anecdote, which we quote      _verbatim_ from another part of the Talmud:--\"It happened once,      as the Rabbis teach, that Rabbi Akiva was immured in a prison,      and Yehoshua Hagarsi was his attendant. One day the gaoler said      to the latter as he entered, 'What a lot of water thou hast      brought to-day! Dost thou need it to sap the walls of the      prison?' So saying, he seized the vessel and poured out half of      the water. When Yehoshua brought in what was left of the water      to Rabbi Akiva, the latter, who was weary of waiting, for he was      faint and thirsty, reproachfully said to him, 'Yehoshua, dost      thou forget that I am old, and my very life depends upon thee?'      When the servant related what had happened, the Rabbi asked for      the water to wash his hands, 'Why, master,' said Yehoshua,      'there's not enough for thee to drink, much less to cleanse thy      hands with.' To which the Rabbi replied, 'What am I to do? They      who neglect to wash their hands are judged worthy of death; 'tis      better that I should die by my own act from thirst than act      against the rules of my associates.' And accordingly it is      related that he abstained from tasting anything till they      brought him water to wash his hands.\" (_Eiruvin_, fol. 21, col.      2. See also _Maimonides, Hilc. Berach._, vi. 19.)        From the context of the passage just quoted we cull the      following, which proves that the Talmud itself bases the precept      concerning the washing of hands on oral tradition and not on the      written law:--\"Rav Yehudah ascribes this saying to Shemuel, that      when Solomon gave to the traditional rules that regulated the      washing of hands and other ceremonial rites the form and      sanction of law, a Bath Kol came forth and said (Prov. xxiii.      15), 'My son, if thy heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even      mine;' and again it said (Prov. xxvii, 11), 'My son, be wise,      and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth      me.'\" (See Prov. xxx. 5, 6.)        There is a great deal in the Talmud about washing the hands, in      addition to what is said in the treatise Yadaim, which is      entirely devoted to the subject. But this topic is subordinate      to another, namely, the alleged inferiority of the precepts of      the Bible to the prescriptions of the Rabbis, of which the      punctilious rules regulative of hand washing form only a small      fraction. This is illustrated by an anecdote from the Talmudic      leaflet entitled Callah, respecting Rabbi Akiva, whose fame      extends from one end of the world to the other. (See _Yevamoth_,      fol. 16, col. 2).        Once upon a time, as the Elders were sitting together, two lads      passed by them, one with his head covered and the other      bareheaded. Of the latter boy as he passed Rabbi Elazar said,      \"He is a Mamzer,\" and Rabbi Yehoshua, \"He is a Ben Haniddah,\"      but Rabbi Akiva contended, \"He is both a Mamzer and a Ben      Haniddah.\" Upon which the Elders said to Rabbi Akiva, \"How      darest thou be so bold as dispute the assertion of thy masters?\"      \"Because I can substantiate what I say,\" was his answer. He then      went to the mother of the lad, and found her selling pease in      the market place. \"Daughter,\" said he to her, \"if thou wilt      answer all that I ask of thee, I will ensure thee a portion in      the life to come.\" She replied, \"Let me have thy oath and I will      do so.\" Then taking the oath with his lips but nullifying it in      his heart, he asked her, \"What sort of a son is thy lad?\" She      replied, \"When I entered my bridal chamber I was a Niddah, and      consequently my husband kept away from me.\" Thus it was found      out that the boy was a Mamzer and a Ben Haniddah; upon which the      sages exclaimed, \"Great is Rabbi Akiva, for he has overcome his      masters;\" and as they congratulated him they said, \"Blessed be      the Lord God of Israel, who hath revealed His secret unto Akiva      the son of Joseph.\" Thus did the Rabbi forswear himself, and      thus did his companions compliment him on the success of his      perjury; yet the Bible says, \"Thou shalt not take the name of      the Lord thy God in vain\" (Exod. xx. 7), and \"Keep thou far from      a falsehood\" (Exod. xxiii. 7).        Here is a companion picture from Yoma, fol. 84, col. 1.--\"Rabbi      Yochanan was suffering from scurvy, and he applied to a Gentile      woman, who prepared a remedy for the fifth and then the sixth      day of the week. 'But what shall I do to-morrow?' said he; 'I      must not walk so far on the Sabbath.' 'Thou wilt not require any      more,' she answered. 'But suppose I do,' he replied. 'Take an      oath,' she answered, 'that thou wilt not reveal it, and I will      tell thee how to compound the remedy.' This he did in the      following words: 'By the God of Israel, I swear I will not      divulge it.' Nevertheless, when he learned the secret, he went      and revealed it. 'But was not that profaning the name of God?'      asks one. 'No,' pleads another Rabbi, 'for, as he told her      afterward, that what he meant was that he would not tell it to      the God of Israel.' The remedy was yeast, water, oil, and salt.\"        The anecdote that follows is from Sanhedrin, fol. 97, col      1:--\"In reference to the remark of Ravina, who said, 'I used to      think that there was no truth in the world,' one of the Rabbis,      Toviah (or Tavyoomah, as some say), would protest and say, 'If      all the riches of the world were offered me, I would not tell a      falsehood.' And he used to clench his protestation with the      following apologue: 'I once went to a place called Kushta, where      the people never swerve from the truth, and where (as a reward      for their integrity) they do not die until old age; and there I      married and settled down, and had two sons born unto me. One day      as my wife was sitting and combing her hair, a woman who dwelt      close by came to the door and asked to see her. Thinking that it      was a breach of etiquette (that any one should see her at her      toilet), I said she was not in. Soon after this my two children      died, and the people came to inquire into the cause of their      premature decease. When I told them of my evasive reply to the      woman, they asked me to leave the town, lest by my misconduct I      might involve the whole community in a like calamity, and death      might be enticed to their place.\"    Food remains for three days in the stomach of the dog, because God knew  that his food would be scanty.    _Shabbath_, fol. 155, col. 1.    He who is born on the third day of the week will be rich and amorous.    Ibid., fol. 156, col. 1.    Rabbi Abba, in the name of Shemuel, says, \"The schools of Shammai and  Hillel were at variance three years, the one party contending and  saying, 'The Halacha is according to us;' and the other, 'The Halacha is  according to us.' Then came a voice from the Lord and said, 'Both these  and those are the words of the living God, but yet the Halacha is  according to the school of Hillel.' What was the merit of the school of  Hillel that the Halacha should be pronounced to be according to it? Its  disciples were gentle and forbearing, for while they stood by their own  decisions, they also stated those maintained by the school of Shammai,  and often even mentioned the tenets of the school of Shammai first and  their own afterward. This teaches us that him who humbles himself, God  will exalt; and him who exalts himself, God will abase. Whoso pursueth  greatness, greatness will flee from him; and whoso fleeth from  greatness, greatness will pursue him.\"    _Eiruvin_, fol. 13, col. 2.    There are three entrances to hell:--One in the desert, one in the sea,  and one in Jerusalem.    Ibid., fol. 19, col. i.    These three will never see hell:--He who is purified by poverty; he who  is purged by a painful flux; and he who is harassed by importunate  creditors; and some say, he also who is plagued with a termagant wife.    _Eiruvin_, fol. 41, col. 2.    Three effects are ascribed to Babylonian broth (which was made of moldy  bread, sour milk, and salt):--It retards the action of the heart, it  affects the eyesight, and emaciates the body.    _P'sachim_, fol. 42, col 1.    These three are not permitted to come between two men, nor is a man  allowed to pass between any two of these three:--A dog, a palm tree, or  a woman; to which some add the pig, and others the serpent as well.    Ibid., fol. 111, col. 1.        One part of this regulation is rather hard and should surely be      abolished; that, viz, which ordains a woman shall not come      between two"]]]
