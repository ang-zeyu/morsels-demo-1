He was employed by his  guardian, Farmer Rodel, in the capacity of scarecrow, an occupation  which required him to swing a rattle in the farmer's orchard all day  long, for the purpose of frightening the sparrows away from the early  cherries and vegetable-beds. At first this duty appealed to him as  sport, but he soon grew tired of it and gave it up.    It was a pleasant, but at the same time a laborious office that Amrei  had undertaken. And it often seemed especially hard to her that she  could do nothing to attach the creatures to her; indeed, they were  hardly to be distinguished from one another. And it was not at all an  idle remark that Black Marianne made to her one day when she returned  from Mossbrook Wood:    \"Animals that live in flocks and herds,\" she said, \"if you take each one  separately, are always stupid.\"    \"I think so, too,\" replied Amrei. \"These geese are stupid because they  know how to do too many different things. They can swim, and run, and  fly, but they are not really at home either in the water, or on land, or  in the air. That's what makes them stupid.\"    \"I still maintain,\" replied Marianne, \"that there's the making of an old  hermit in you.\"    The Holderwasen was not one of those lonely, sequestered spots which the  world of fiction seems to select for its gleaming, glittering legends.  Through the centre of the Holderwasen ran a road to Endringen, and not  far from it stood the many-colored boundary-stakes with the  coats-of-arms of the two sovereign princes whose dominions came together  here. In rustic vehicles of all kinds the peasants used to drive past,  and men, women, and children kept passing to and fro with hoe, scythe,  and sickle. The _gardes-champetres_ of the two dominions also used to  pass by often, the barrels of their muskets shining as they approached  and gleaming long after they had passed. Amrei was almost always  accosted by the _garde-champetre_ of Endringen as she sat by the  roadside, and he often made inquiries of her as to whether this or that  person had passed by. But she was never able to give the desired  information--or perhaps she kept it from him on purpose, on account of  the instinctive aversion the people, and especially the children, of a  village have for these men, whom they invariably look upon as the armed  enemies of the human race, going to and fro in search of some one to  devour.    Theisles Manz, who used to sit by the road breaking stones, hardly spoke  a word to Amrei; he would go sulkily from stone-heap to stone-heap, and  his knocking was more incessant than the tapping of the woodpecker in  Mossbrook Wood, and more regular than the piping and chirping of the  grasshoppers in the neighboring meadows and cloverfields.    [And so Amrei spent day after day at Holderwasen, watching the geese and  the passers-by, studying the birds and the flowers and the trees,  dreaming of her father and mother, and wondering what was in store for  Damie and herself. There was a trough of clear, fresh water by the  roadside, and Amrei used to bring a jug with her in order to offer it to  thirsty people who had nothing to drink out of.]    One day a little Bernese wagon, drawn by two handsome white horses, came  rattling along the road; a stout, upland farmer took up almost the  entire seat, which was meant for two. He drew up by the roadside and  asked:    \"Girlie, have you anything one can drink out of?\"    \"Yes, certainly--I'll get it for you.\" And she went off briskly to fetch  her pitcher, which she filled with water.    \"Ah!\" said the farmer, stopping to take breath after a long draught; and  with the water running down his chin, he continued, talking half into  the jug: \"There's after all no water like this in all the world.\" And  again he raised the jug to his lips, and motioned to Amrei to keep still  while he took a second long, thirsty draught. For it is extremely  disagreeable to be addressed when you are drinking; you swallow  hurriedly and feel an oppression afterward.    The child seemed to realize this, for not until the farmer had handed  back the jug did she say:    \"Yes, this is good, wholesome water; and if you would like to water your  horses, it is especially good for them--it won't give them cramps.\"    \"My horses are warm and must not drink now. Do you come from  Haldenbrunn, my girl?\"    \"Yes indeed.\"    \"And what is your name?\"    \"Amrei.\"    \"And to whom do you belong?\"    [Illustration: AMREI BRISKLY BROUGHT HER PITCHER FILLED WITH WATER]    \"To nobody now--my father was Josenhans.\"    \"What! Josenhans, who served at Farmer Rodel's?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I knew him well. It was too bad that he died so soon. Wait, child--I'll  give you something.\" He drew a large leather bag out of his pocket,  groped about in it for a long time, and said at last: \"There, take  this.\"    \"No, thank you--I don't accept presents--I'll take nothing.\"    \"Take it--you can accept it from me all right. Is Farmer Rodel your  guardian?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"He might have done something better than make a goose-girl of you.  Well, God keep you.\"    Away rolled the wagon, and Amrei found herself alone with a coin in her  hand.    \"'You can accept it from me all right.'--Who was he that he could say  that? And why didn't he make himself known? Why, it's a groschen, and  there's a bird on it. Well, it won't make him poor, nor me rich.\"    The rest of that day Amrei did not offer her pitcher to any one else;  she was afraid of having something given to her again. When she got home  in the evening, Black Marianne told her that Farmer Rodel had sent for  her, and that she was to go over to him directly.    Amrei hastened to his house, and as she entered, Farmer Rodel called out  to her:    \"What have you been saying to Farmer Landfried?\"    \"I don't know any Farmer Landfried.\"    \"He was with you at the Holderwasen today, and gave you something.\"    \"I did not know who he was--and here's his money still.\"    \"I've nothing to do with that. Now, say frankly and honestly, you  tiresome child, did I persuade you to be a goose-keeper? If you don't  give it up this very day, I'm no guardian of yours. I won't have such  things said of me!\"    \"I'll let everybody know that it was not your fault--but give it up is  something I can't do. I must stick to it, at any rate for the rest of  the summer--I must finish what I have begun.\"    \"You're a crabbed creature,\" said the farmer; and he walked out of the  room. But his wife, who was lying ill in bed, called out:    \"You're quite right--stay just as you are. I prophesy that it will go  well with you. A hundred years from now they will be saying in this  village of one who has done well: 'He has the fortune of Brosi's Severin  and of Josenhans' Amrei.' Your dry bread will fall into the honey-pot  yet.\"    Farmer Rodel's sick wife was looked upon as crazy; and, as if frightened  by a specter, Amrei hurried away without a word of reply.    Amrei told Black Marianne that a wonder had happened to her; Farmer  Landfried, whose wife she so often thought about, had spoken to her and  had taken her part in a talk with Farmer Rodel, and had given her  something. She then displayed the piece of money, and Marianne called  out, laughing:    \"Yes, I might have guessed myself that it was Farmer Landfried. That's  just like him--to give a poor child a bad groschen!\"    \"Why is it bad?\" asked Amrei; and the tears came into her eyes.    \"Why, that's a bird groschen--they're not worth full value--they're  worth only a kreutzer and a half.\"    \"Then he intended to give me only a kreutzer and a half,\" said Amrei  decidedly.    And here for the first time an inward contrast showed itself between  Amrei and Black Marianne. The latter almost rejoiced at every bad thing  she heard about people, whereas Amrei put a good construction on  everything. She was always happy, and no matter how frequently in her  solitude she burst into tears, she never expected anything, and hence  everything that she received was a surprise to her, and she was all the  more thankful for it.    [Amrei hoped that her meeting with Farmer Landfried would result in his  coming to take her to live with him, but she hoped in vain, for she  watched the geese all summer long, and did not see or hear of him  again.]          CHAPTER VI    THE WOMAN WHO BAKED HER OWN BREAD      A woman who leads a solitary, isolated life and bakes bread for herself  quite alone, is called an \"Eigenbroetlerin\" (a woman who bakes her own  bread), and such a woman, as a rule, has all kinds of peculiarities. No  one had more right or more inclination to be an \"Eigenbroetlerin\" than  did Black Marianne, although she never had anything to bake; for oatmeal  and potatoes and potatoes and oatmeal were the only things she ever ate.  She always lived by herself, and did not like to associate with other  people. Only along toward autumn did she become restless and impatient;  about that time of the year she would talk to herself a great deal, and  would often accost people of her own accord, especially strangers who  happened to be passing through the village. For she was anxious to find  out whether the masons from this or that place had yet returned home for  the winter, and whether they had brought news of her John. While she was  once more boiling and washing the linen she had been bleaching all  summer long, for which purpose she remained up all night, she would  always be muttering to herself. No one could understand exactly what she  said, but the burden of it was intelligible, for it was always: \"That is  for me, and that is for thee.\" She was in the habit of saying twelve  Paternosters daily for her John, but on this particular washing-night  they became innumerable. When the first snow fell she was always  especially cheerful; for then there could be no more outdoor work, and  then he would be most likely to come home. At these times she would  often talk"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259"],[0,"Twenty Years After (#10)"],[1,"sundry  superb exploits in the last reign.\"    \"Your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor. It is  true I fought with tolerable success.\"    \"I don't speak of your warlike exploits, monsieur,\" said Mazarin;  \"although they gained you much reputation, they were surpassed by  others.\"    D'Artagnan pretended astonishment.    \"Well, you do not reply?\" resumed Mazarin.    \"I am waiting, my lord, till you tell me of what exploits you speak.\"    \"I speak of the adventure--Eh, you know well what I mean.\"    \"Alas, no, my lord!\" replied D'Artagnan, surprised.    \"You are discreet--so much the better. I speak of that adventure in  behalf of the queen, of the ornaments, of the journey you made with  three of your friends.\"    \"Aha!\" thought the Gascon; \"is this a snare or not? Let me be on my  guard.\"    And he assumed a look of stupidity which Mendori or Bellerose, two of  the first actors of the day, might have envied.    \"Bravo!\" cried Mazarin; \"they told me that you were the man I wanted.  Come, let us see what you will do for me.\"    \"Everything that your eminence may please to command me,\" was the reply.    \"You will do for me what you have done for the queen?\"    \"Certainly,\" D'Artagnan said to himself, \"he wishes to make me speak  out. He's not more cunning than De Richelieu was! Devil take him!\" Then  he said aloud:    \"The queen, my lord? I don't comprehend.\"    \"You don't comprehend that I want you and your three friends to be of  use to me?\"    \"Which of my friends, my lord?\"    \"Your three friends--the friends of former days.\"    \"Of former days, my lord! In former days I had not only three friends, I  had thirty; at two-and-twenty one calls every man one's friend.\"    \"Well, sir,\" returned Mazarin, \"prudence is a fine thing, but to-day you  might regret having been too prudent.\"    \"My lord, Pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that  they might learn to hold their tongues.\"    \"But you have been silent for twenty years, sir. Speak, now the queen  herself releases you from your promise.\"    \"The queen!\" said D'Artagnan, with an astonishment which this time was  not pretended.    \"Yes, the queen! And as a proof of what I say she commanded me to show  you this diamond, which she thinks you know.\"    And so saying, Mazarin extended his hand to the officer, who sighed as  he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the  night of the ball at the Hotel de Ville and which she had repurchased  from Monsieur des Essarts.    \"'Tis true. I remember well that diamond, which belonged to the queen.\"    \"You see, then, that I speak to you in the queen's name. Answer me  without acting as if you were on the stage; your interests are concerned  in your so doing.\"    \"Faith, my lord, it is very necessary for me to make my fortune, your  eminence has so long forgotten me.\"    \"We need only a week to amend all that. Come, you are accounted for, you  are here, but where are your friends?\"    \"I do not know, my lord. We have parted company this long time; all  three have left the service.\"    \"Where can you find them, then?\"    \"Wherever they are, that's my business.\"    \"Well, now, what are your conditions, if I employ you?\"    \"Money, my lord, as much money as what you wish me to undertake will  require. I remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of  money, and but for that diamond, which I was obliged to sell, we should  have remained on the road.\"    \"The devil he does! Money! and a large sum!\" said Mazarin. \"Pray, are  you aware that the king has no money in his treasury?\"    \"Do then as I did, my lord. Sell the crown diamonds. Trust me, don't let  us try to do things cheaply. Great undertakings come poorly off with  paltry means.\"    \"Well,\" returned Mazarin, \"we will satisfy you.\"    \"Richelieu,\" thought D'Artagnan, \"would have given me five hundred  pistoles in advance.\"    \"You will then be at my service?\" asked Mazarin.    \"Yes, if my friends agree.\"    \"But if they refuse can I count on you?\"    \"I have never accomplished anything alone,\" said D'Artagnan, shaking his  head.    \"Go, then, and find them.\"    \"What shall I say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence?\"    \"You know them better than I. Adapt your promises to their respective  characters.\"    \"What shall I promise?\"    \"That if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude  shall be magnificent.\"    \"But what are we to do?\"    \"Make your mind easy; when the time for action comes you shall be put in  full possession of what I require from you; wait till that time arrives  and find out your friends.\"    \"My lord, perhaps they are not in Paris. It is even probable that I  shall have to make a journey. I am only a lieutenant of musketeers, very  poor, and journeys cost money.    \"My intention,\" said Mazarin, \"is not that you go with a great  following; my plans require secrecy, and would be jeopardized by a too  extravagant equipment.\"    \"Still, my lord, I can't travel on my pay, for it is now three months  behind; and I can't travel on my savings, for in my twenty-two years of  service I have accumulated nothing but debts.\"    Mazarin remained some moments in deep thought, as if he were fighting  with himself; then, going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock,  he took from it a bag of silver, and weighing it twice in his hands  before he gave it to D'Artagnan:    \"Take this,\" he said with a sigh, \"'tis merely for your journey.\"    \"If these are Spanish doubloons, or even gold crowns,\" thought  D'Artagnan, \"we shall yet be able to do business together.\" He saluted  the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket.    \"Well, then, all is settled; you are to set off,\" said the cardinal.    \"Yes, my lord.\"    \"Apropos, what are the names of your friends?\"    \"The Count de la Fere, formerly styled Athos; Monsieur du Vallon, whom  we used to call Porthos; the Chevalier d'Herblay, now the Abbe  d'Herblay, whom we styled Aramis----\"    The cardinal smiled.    \"Younger sons,\" he said, \"who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned  names in order not to lower their family names. Long swords but light  purses. Was that it?\"    \"If, God willing, these swords should be devoted to the service of your  eminence,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I shall venture to express a wish, which  is, that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and  theirs heavy--for with these three men your eminence may rouse all  Europe if you like.\"    \"These Gascons,\" said the cardinal, laughing, \"almost beat the Italians  in effrontery.\"    \"At all events,\" answered D'Artagnan, with a smile almost as crafty as  the cardinal's, \"they beat them when they draw their swords.\"    He then withdrew, and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a  lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money.    \"Crown pieces only--silver pieces! I suspected it. Ah! Mazarin! Mazarin!  thou hast no confidence in me! so much the worse for thee, for harm may  come of it!\"    Meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction.    \"A hundred pistoles! a hundred pistoles! for a hundred pistoles I have  discovered a secret for which Richelieu would have paid twenty thousand  crowns; without reckoning the value of that diamond\"--he cast a  complacent look at the ring, which he had kept, instead of restoring to  D'Artagnan--\"which is worth, at least, ten thousand francs.\"    He returned to his room, and after depositing the ring in a casket  filled with brilliants of every sort, for the cardinal was a connoisseur  in precious stones, he called to Bernouin to undress him, regardless of  the noises of gun-fire that, though it was now near midnight, continued  to resound through Paris.    In the meantime D'Artagnan took his way toward the Rue Tiquetonne, where  he lived at the Hotel de la Chevrette.    We will explain in a few words how D'Artagnan had been led to choose  that place of residence.          6. D'Artagnan in his Fortieth Year.      Years have elapsed, many events have happened, alas! since, in our  romance of \"The Three Musketeers,\" we took leave of D'Artagnan at No. 12  Rue des Fossoyeurs. D'Artagnan had not failed in his career, but  circumstances had been adverse to him. So long as he was surrounded by  his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character. He  was one of those fine, ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves  easily to the dispositions of others. Athos imparted to him his  greatness of soul, Porthos his enthusiasm, Aramis his elegance. Had  D'Artagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have  become a superior character. Athos was the first to leave him, in order  that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near Blois;  Porthos, the second, to marry an attorney's wife; and lastly, Aramis,  the third, to take orders and become an abbe. From that day D'Artagnan  felt lonely and powerless, without courage to pursue a career in which  he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three  companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from  Heaven.    Notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers, D'Artagnan felt  completely solitary. For a time the delightful remembrance of Madame  Bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge, perishable  indeed; for like all other recollections in this world, these  impressions were, by degrees, effaced. A garrison life is fatal even to  the most aristocratic organization; and imperceptibly, D'Artagnan,  always in the camp, always on horseback, always in garrison, became (I  know not how in the present age one would express it) a typical trooper.  His early refinement of character was not only not lost, it grew even  greater than ever; but it was now applied to the little, instead of to  the great things of life--to the martial condition of the  soldier--comprised under the head of a good lodging, a rich"]]]
