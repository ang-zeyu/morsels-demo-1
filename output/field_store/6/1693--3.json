ROBERT ARMITAGE, a rector in Shropshire, is the author of  \"Dr. Hookwell,\" and \"Dr. Johnson, his Religious Life and his Death.\"  In this last work, the _Quarterly Review_ observes, \"Johnson's name is  made the peg on which to hang up--or rather the line on which to hang  out--much hackneyed sentimentality, and some borrowed learning, with  an awful and overpowering quantity of twaddle and rigmarole.\" The  writer concludes his reviewal: \"We are sorry to have had to make such  an exposure of a man, who, apart from the morbid excess of vanity  which has evidently led him into this scrape, may be, for aught we  know, worthy and amiable. His exposure, however, is on his own  head: he has ostentatiously and pertinaciously forced his ignorance,  conceit, and effrontery on public notice.\" We quite agree with the  _Quarterly_.           *       *       *       *       *    JOHN MILLS--\"John St. Hugh Mills,\" it was written then--was familiarly  known in the printing offices of Ann street in this city a dozen  years ago; he assisted General Morris in editing the Mirror, and wrote  paragraphs of foreign gossip for other journals. A good-natured aunt  died in England, leaving him a few thousand a year, and he returned  to spend his income upon a stud and pack and printing office, sending  from the latter two or three volumes of pleasant-enough mediocrity  every season. His last work, with the imprint of Colburn, is called  \"Our Country.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. PRESCOTT, the historian, who is now in England, has received the  degree of Doctor of Civil Law from the University of Oxford. Two or  three years ago he was elected into the Institute of France.           *       *       *       *       *    DR. MAGINN's \"Homeric Ballads,\" which gave so much attraction  during several years to _Fraser's Magazine_, have been collected and  republished in a small octavo.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. KENDALL, of the _Picayune_, has sailed once more for Paris, to  superintend there the completion of his great work on the late war  in Mexico upon which he has been engaged for the last two years. The  highest talent has been employed in the embellishment of this book,  and the care and expense incurred may be estimated from the fact that  sixty men, coloring and preparing the plates, can finish only one  hundred and twenty copies in a month. The original sketches were  taken by a German, Carl Nebel, who accompanied Mr. Kendall in Mexico,  and drew his battle scenes at the very time of their occurrence. He  has engaged in the prosecution of the whole enterprise with as much  zeal and interest as Mr. Kendall himself, and has spared no pains to  procure the assistance of the most skillful operatives. The book is  folio in size, and will be published early in the fall. The letter  press has long been finished, and only waiting for the completion of  the plates. These are twelve, and their subjects are Palo Alto, the  Capture of Monterey, Buena Vista: the Landing at Vera Cruz, Cerro  Gordo, Contreras, Cherubusco, Molino del Rey, two views of the  Storming of Chapultepec, and Gen. Scott's entrance into the city of  Mexico. The lithographs are said to be unsurpassed in felicity of  design, perfection of coloring, and in the animation and expression  of all the figures and groups. No such finished specimens of colored  lithography were ever exhibited in this country. The plates will have  unusual value, not only on account of their intrinsic superiority,  but because of their rare historical merit, since they are exact  delineations of the topography of the scenes they represent and  faithful representations in every particular of the military positions  and movements at the moment chosen for illustration.           *       *       *       *       *    MRS. TROLLOPPE is as busy as she has ever been since the failure of  her shop at Cincinnati--trading in fiction, with the capital won  by her first adventure in this way, \"The Domestic Manners of the  Americans.\" Her last novel, which is just out, has in its title the  odor of her customary vulgarity; it is called \"Petticoat Government.\"  Her son, Mr. A. Trolloppe, his just given the world a new book also,  \"La Vendee\" a historical romance which is well spoken of.           *       *       *       *       *    THE REV. DR. WILLIAM R.

The Providence _Journal_ states that the  entire subscription to the fund of Brown University has reached  $110,000, which is within $15,000 of the sum originally proposed.  The subscription having advanced so far, and with good assurances of  further aid, the committee have reported to the President, that the  success of the plan, so far as the money is concerned, may be regarded  as assured, and that consequently it will be safe to go on with the  new organization as rapidly as may he deemed advisable. Of the sum  raised, about $96,000 have come from Providence. A meeting of the  Corporation of the University will soon be called, when the entire  plan will be decided upon, and carried into effect as rapidly as so  important a change can be made with prudence.           *       *       *       *       *    SIR JAMES EMERSON TENNANT has in the press of Mr. Murray a work  which will probably be read with much interest in this country,  upon Christianity in Ceylon, its introduction and progress under the  Portuguese, the Dutch, the British, and the American missions, with a  Historical View of the Brahminical and Buddhist superstitions.           *       *       *       *       *    CHARLES EAMES, formerly one of the editors of the Washington _Union_,  and more recently United States Commissioner to the Sandwich Islands,  is to be the orator of the societies of Columbia College, at the  commencement, on the evening of the 6th of October.

The materials for the following tale were furnished to the writer  while traveling last year near the spot on which the events it  narrates took place. It is intended to convey a notion of some of the  phases of Polish, or rather Russian serfdom (for, as truly explained  by one of the characters in a succeeding page, it is Russian), and of  the catastrophes it has occasioned, not only in Catherine's time,  but occasionally at the present. The Polish nobles--themselves in  slavery--earnestly desire the emancipation of their serfs, which  Russian domination forbids.    The small town of Pobereze stands at the foot of a stony mountain,  watered by numerous springs in the district of Podolia, in Poland. It  consists of a mass of miserable Cabins, with a Catholic chapel and two  Greek churches in the midst, the latter distinguished by their gilded  towers. On one side of the market-place stands the only inn, and on  the opposite side are several shops, from whose doors and windows  look out several dirtily dressed Jews. At a little distance, on a hill  covered with vines and fruit-trees, stands the Palace, which does not,  perhaps, exactly merit such an appellation, but who would dare to call  otherwise the dwelling of the lord of the domain?    On the morning when our tale opens, there had issued from this palace  the common enough command to the superintendent of the estate, to  furnish the master with a couple of strong boys, for service in the  stables, and a young girl to be employed in the wardrobe. Accordingly,  a number of the best-looking young peasants of Olgogrod assembled  in the avenue leading to the palace. Some were accompanied by their  sorrowful and weeping parents, in all of whose hearts, however, rose  the faint whispered hope, \"Perhaps it will not be _my_ child they will  choose!\"    Being brought into the court-yard of the palace, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13650"],[0,"Nonsense Books (#10)"],[1,"who incessantly alighted on the head of the Rhinoceros for the  purpose of gathering the seeds of the rhododendron-plants which grew  there; and these creatures they cooked in the most translucent and  satisfactory manner by means of a fire lighted on the end of the  Rhinoceros's back. A crowd of Kangaroos and gigantic Cranes accompanied  them, from feelings of curiosity and complacency; so that they were never  at a loss for company, and went onward, as it were, in a sort of profuse  and triumphant procession.    Thus in less than eighteen weeks they all arrived safely at home, where  they were received by their admiring relatives with joy tempered with  contempt, and where they finally resolved to carry out the rest of their  travelling-plans at some more favorable opportunity.    As for the Rhinoceros, in token of their grateful adherence, they had him  killed and stuffed directly, and then set him up outside the door of their  father's house as a diaphanous doorscraper.    [Illustration]          THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN FAMILIES OF  THE LAKE PIPPLE-POPPLE.      CHAPTER I.    INTRODUCTORY.    In former days,--that is to say, once upon a time,--there lived in the Land  of Gramble-Blamble seven families. They lived by the side of the great Lake  Pipple-Popple (one of the seven families, indeed, lived _in_ the lake), and  on the outskirts of the city of Tosh, which, excepting when it was quite  dark, they could see plainly. The names of all these places you have  probably heard of; and you have only not to look in your geography-books to  find out all about them.    Now, the seven families who lived on the borders of the great Lake  Pipple-Popple were as follows in the next chapter.      CHAPTER II.    THE SEVEN FAMILIES.    There was a family of two old Parrots and seven young Parrots.    [Illustration]    There was a family of two old Storks and seven young Storks.    [Illustration]    There was a family of two old Geese and seven young Geese.    [Illustration]    There was a family of two old Owls and seven young Owls.    [Illustration]    There was a family of two old Guinea Pigs and seven young Guinea Pigs.    [Illustration]    There was a family of two old Cats and seven young Cats.    [Illustration]    And there was a family of two old Fishes and seven young Fishes.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER III.    THE HABITS OF THE SEVEN FAMILIES.    The Parrots lived upon the Soffsky-Poffsky trees, which were beautiful to  behold, and covered with blue leaves; and they fed upon fruit, artichokes,  and striped beetles.    The Storks walked in and out of the Lake Pipple-Popple, and ate frogs for  breakfast, and buttered toast for tea; but on account of the extreme length  of their legs they could not sit down, and so they walked about  continually.    The Geese, having webs to their feet, caught quantities of flies, which  they ate for dinner.    The Owls anxiously looked after mice, which they caught, and made into  sago-puddings.    The Guinea Pigs toddled about the gardens, and ate lettuces and Cheshire  cheese.    The Cats sate still in the sunshine, and fed upon sponge biscuits.    The Fishes lived in the lake, and fed chiefly on boiled periwinkles.    And all these seven families lived together in the utmost fun and felicity.      CHAPTER IV.    THE CHILDREN OF THE SEVEN FAMILIES ARE SENT AWAY.    One day all the seven fathers and the seven mothers of the seven families  agreed that they would send their children out to see the world.    So they called them all together, and gave them each eight shillings and  some good advice, some chocolate-drops, and a small green morocco  pocket-book to set down their expenses in.    They then particularly entreated them not to quarrel; and all the parents  sent off their children with a parting injunction.    \"If,\" said the old Parrots, \"you find a cherry, do not fight about who  should have it.\"    \"And,\" said the old Storks, \"if you find a frog, divide it carefully into  seven bits, but on no account quarrel about it.\"    And the old Geese said to the seven young Geese, \"Whatever you do, be sure  you do not touch a plum-pudding flea.\"    And the old Owls said, \"If you find a mouse, tear him up into seven slices,  and eat him cheerfully, but without quarrelling.\"    And the old Guinea Pigs said, \"Have a care that you eat your lettuces,  should you find any, not greedily, but calmly.\"    And the old Cats said, \"Be particularly careful not to meddle with a  clangle-wangle if you should see one.\"    And the old Fishes said, \"Above all things, avoid eating a blue boss-woss;  for they do not agree with fishes, and give them a pain in their toes.\"    So all the children of each family thanked their parents; and, making in  all forty-nine polite bows, they went into the wide world.        CHAPTER V.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG PARROTS.    The seven young Parrots had not gone far, when they saw a tree with a  single cherry on it, which the oldest Parrot picked instantly; but the  other six, being extremely hungry, tried to get it also. On which all the  seven began to fight; and they  scuffled,       and huffled,         and ruffled,           and shuffled,             and puffled,               and muffled,                 and buffled,                   and duffled,                     and fluffled,                       and guffled,                         and bruffled,                           and screamed, and shrieked, and squealed,  and squeaked, and clawed, and snapped, and bit, and bumped, and thumped,  and dumped, and flumped each other, till they were all torn into little  bits; and at last there was nothing left to record this painful incident  except the cherry and seven small green feathers.    And that was the vicious and voluble end of the seven young Parrots.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER VI.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG STORKS.    When the seven young Storks set out, they walked or flew for fourteen weeks  in a straight line, and for six weeks more in a crooked one; and after that  they ran as hard as they could for one hundred and eight miles; and after  that they stood still, and made a himmeltanious chatter-clatter-blattery  noise with their bills.    About the same time they perceived a large frog, spotted with green, and  with a sky-blue stripe under each ear.    So, being hungry, they immediately flew at him, and were going to divide  him into seven pieces, when they began to quarrel as to which of his legs  should be taken off first. One said this, and another said that; and while  they were all quarrelling, the frog hopped away. And when they saw that he  was gone, they began to    chatter-clatter,        blatter-platter,            patter-blatter,                matter-clatter,                    flatter-quatter,  more violently than ever; and after they  had fought for a week, they pecked each other all to little pieces, so that  at last nothing was left of any of them except their bills.    And that was the end of the seven young Storks.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER VII.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG GEESE.    When the seven young Geese began to travel, they went over a large plain,  on which there was but one tree, and that was, a very bad one.    So four of them went up to the top of it, and looked about them; while the  other three waddled up and down, and repeated poetry, and their last six  lessons in arithmetic, geography, and cookery.    Presently they perceived, a long way off, an object of the most interesting  and obese appearance, having a perfectly round body exactly resembling a  boiled plum-pudding, with two little wings, and a beak, and three feathers  growing out of his head, and only one leg.    So, after a time, all the seven young Geese said to each other, \"Beyond all  doubt this beast must be a Plum-pudding Flea!\"    On which they incautiously began to sing aloud,           \"Plum-pudding Flea,          Plum-pudding Flea,          Wherever you be,          Oh! come to our tree,      And listen, oh! listen, oh! listen to me!\"    And no sooner had they sung this verse than the Plum-pudding Flea began to  hop and skip on his one leg with the most dreadful velocity, and came  straight to the tree, where he stopped, and looked about him in a vacant  and voluminous manner.    On which the seven young Geese were greatly alarmed, and all of a  tremble-bemble: so one of them put out his long neck, and just touched him  with the tip of his bill; but no sooner had he done this than the  Plum-pudding Flea skipped and hopped about more and more, and higher and  higher; after which he opened his mouth, and, to the great surprise and  indignation of the seven Geese, began to bark so loudly and furiously and  terribly, that they were totally unable to bear the noise; and by degrees  every one of them suddenly tumbled down quite dead.    So that was the end of the seven young Geese.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER VIII.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG OWLS.    When the seven young Owls set out, they sate every now and then on the  branches of old trees, and never went far at one time.    And one night, when it was quite dark, they thought they heard a mouse;  but, as the gas-lamps were not lighted, they could not see him.    So they called out, \"Is that a mouse?\"    On which a mouse answered, \"Squeaky-peeky-weeky! yes, it is!\"    And immediately all the young Owls threw themselves off the tree, meaning  to alight on the ground; but they did not perceive that there was a large  well below them, into which they all fell superficially, and were every one  of them drowned in less than half a minute.    So that was the end of the seven young Owls.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER IX.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG GUINEA PIGS.    The seven young Guinea Pigs went into a garden full of goose-berry-bushes  and tiggory-trees, under one of which they fell asleep. When they awoke,  they saw a large lettuce, which had grown out of "]]]
