In the case of  coal mines, paper mills, cow houses with permanent lines, etc., fixed  plates are employed. Such plates need only be applied where the line is  always wet, or in workshops where the use of turntables is not of  frequent occurrence. This fixed plate is most useful in farmers'  stables, as it does not present any projection which might hurt the feet  of the cattle, and is easy to clean.    The only accident that can happen to the track is the breaking of a  fish-plate. It happens often that the fish-plates get twisted, owing to  rough handling on the part of the workmen, and break in the act of being  straightened. In order to facilitate as much as possible the repairs in  such cases, the fish-plates are not riveted by machinery, but by hand;  and it is only necessary to cut the rivets with which the fish-plate is  fastened, and remove it if broken: A drill passed through the two holes  of the rail removes all burrs that may be in the way of the new rivet.  No vises are required for this operation; the track to be repaired is  held by two workmen at a height of about 28 in. above the ground, care  being taken to let the end under repair rest on a portable anvil, which  is supplied with the necessary appliances. The two fish-plates are put  in their place at the same time, the second rivet being held in place  with one finger, while the first is being riveted with a hammer; if it  is not kept in its place in this manner it may be impossible to put it  in afterward, as the blows of the hammer often cause the fish-plate to  shift, and the holes in the rail are pierced with great precision to  prevent there being too much clearance. No other accident need be feared  with this line, and the breakage described above can easily be repaired  in a few minutes without requiring any skilled workman.    The narrow-gauge system, which has recently received so great a  development on the Continent, since its usefulness has been  demonstrated, and the facility with which it can be applied to the most  varied purposes, has not yet met in England with the same universal  acceptance; and those members of this Institution who crossed the sea to  go to Belgium were, perhaps, surprised to see so large a number of  portable railways employed for agricultural and building purposes and  for contractors' works. But in the hands of so practical a people it may  be expected that the portable narrow gauge railway will soon be applied  even to a larger number of purposes than is the case elsewhere.           *       *       *       *       *          GERARD'S ALTERNATING CURRENT MACHINE.      The machine represented in the annexed engravings consists of a movable  inductor, whose alternate poles pass in front of an armature composed of  a double number of oblong and flat bobbins, that are affixed to a circle  firmly connected with the frame. There is a similar circle on each side  of the inductor. The armature is stationary, and the wires that start  from the bobbins are connected with terminals placed upon a wooden  support that surmounts the machine.    [Illustration: GERARD'S ALTERNATING ELECTRIC MACHINE.]    This arrangement allows of every possible grouping of the currents  according to requirements. Thus, the armature may be divided into two  currents, so as to allow of carbons 30 mm. in diameter being burned, or  else so as to have four, eight, twelve, twenty-four, or even forty-eight  distinct circuits capable of being used altogether or in part.    This machine has been studied with a view of rendering the lamps  independent; and there may be produced with it, for example, a voltaic  arc of an intensity of from 250 to 600 carcels for the lighting of a  courtyard, or it may be used for producing arcs of less intensity for  shops, or for supplying incandescent lamps. As each of the circuits is  independent, it becomes easy to light or extinguish any one of the lamps  at will. Since the conductors are formed of ordinary simple wires, the  cost attending the installation of 12 or 24 lamps amounts to just about  the same as it would in the case of a single cable.

According to the inventor, this machine is capable of  supplying 1,000 lamps of a special kind, called \"slide lamps,\" and a  larger number of incandescent ones.--_Revue Industrielle_.           *       *       *       *       *          AUTOMATIC FAST SPEED TELEGRAPHY.    By THEO. F. TAYLOR.      Since 1838 much has been done toward increasing the carrying capacity of  a single wire. In response to your invitation I will relate my  experience upon the Postal's large coppered wire, in an effort to  transmit 800 words per minute over a 1,000 mile circuit, and add my mite  to the vast sum of knowledge already possessed by electricians.    As an introduction, I shall mention a few historical facts, but do not  propose to write in this article even a short account of the different  automatic systems, and I must assume that my readers are familiar with  modern automatic machines and appliances.    In 1870, upon the completion of the Automatic Company's 7 ohm wire  between New York and Washington, it happened that Prof. Moses G. Farmer  was in the Washington office when the first message was about to be  sent, and upon being requested, he turned the \"crank\" and transmitted  the message to New York, at the rate of 217 words per minute.    Upon his return to New York he co-operated with Mr. Prescott in  experiments on W.U. wires, their object being to determine what could be  done on iron wires with the Bain system. A good No. 8 wire running from  New York to Boston was selected, reinsulated, well trimmed, and put in  first-class electrical condition, previous to the test. The \"Little\"  chemical paper was used.    The maximum speed attained on this wire was 65 words per minute.    About the same time George H. Grace used an electro magnet on the  automatic line with such good effect that the speed on the New  York-Washington circuit was increased to 450 words per minute.    Then a platina stylus or pen was substituted for the iron pen in  connection with iodide paper, and the speed increased to 900 words per  minute.    In 1880, upon the completion of the Rapid Company's 6 ohm wire, between  New York and Boston, 1,200 words per minute were transmitted between the  cities above named.    In 1882, I was employed by the Postal Telegraph Company to put the Leggo  automatic system into practical shape, and, if possible, transmit 800  words per minute between New York and Chicago.    It was proposed to string a steel-copper wire, the copper on which was  to weigh 500 lb. to the mile.    When complete, the wire was rather larger than No. 3, English gauge, but  varied in diameter, some being as large as No. 1, and it averaged 525  lb. of copper per mile and = 1.5 ohms. The surface of this wire was,  however, large.    Dr. Muirhead estimated its static capacity at about 10 M.F., which  subsequent tests proved to be nearly correct.    It will be understood that this static capacity stood in the way of fast  transmission.    Resistance and static capacity are the two factors that determine speed  of signaling.    The duration of the variable state is in proportion to the square of the  length of the conductor, so that the difficulties increase very greatly  as the wire is extended beyond ordinary limits. According to Prescott,  \"The duration of the variable condition in a wire of 500 miles is  250,000 times as long as in a wire of 1 mile.\"    In other words, a long line _retains a charge_, and time must be allowed  for at least a falling off of the charge to a point indicated by the  receiving instrument as zero.    In the construction of the line care was taken to insure the _lowest  possible resistance_ through the circuit, even to the furnishing of the  river cables with conductors weighing 500 lb. per mile.    Ground wires were placed on every tenth pole.    When the first 100 miles of wire had been strung, I was much encouraged  to find that we could telegraph without any difficulty past the average  provincial \"ground,\" provided the terminal grounds were good.    When the western end of this remarkable wire reached Olean, N.Y., 400  miles from New York, my assistant, Mr. S.K. Dingle, proceeded to that  town with a receiving instrument, and we made the first test.    I found that 800 words, or 20,000 impulses, per minute, could be  transmitted in Morse characters over that circuit _without compensation_  for static.    In other words, the old Bain method was competent to telegraph 800 words  per minute on the 400 miles of 1.5 ohm wire.    The trouble began, however, when the wire reached Cleveland, O., about  700 miles from New York.    Upon making a test at Cleveland, I found the signals made a continuous  black line upon the chemical paper. I then placed both ends of the wire  to earth through 3,000 ohms resistance, and introduced a small auxiliary  battery between the chemical paper and earth.    The auxiliary or opposing battery was placed in the same circuit with  the transmitting battery, and the currents which were transmitted from  the latter through the receiving instrument reached the earth by passing  directly through the opposing battery.    The circuit of the opposing battery was permanently completed,  independently of the transmitting apparatus, through both branch  conductors and artificial resistances.    The auxiliary battery at the receiving station normally maintained upon  the main line a continuous electric current of a negative polarity,  which did not produce a mark upon the chemical paper.    When the transmitting battery was applied"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11414"],[0,"In the Claws of the German Eagle (#10)"],[1,"times in far greater danger. I do not know these things. All I know  is that this is a true and faithful transcript of the feelings and sights  that came crowding in upon me in that most eventful day and  night.            PART II  On Foot With The German Army          Chapter V    The Gray Hordes Out Of The North        The outbreak of the Great War found me in Europe as a general  tourist, and not in the capacity of war-correspondent. Hitherto I had  essayed a much less romantic role in life, belonging rather to the  crowd of uplifters who conduct the drab and dreary battle with the  slums. The futility of most of these schemes for badgering the poor  makes one feel at times that these battles are shams and  unavailing. This is depressing. It is thrilling, then, suddenly to  acquire the glamorous title of war-correspondent, and to have  before one the prospect of real and actual battles.    Commissioned thus and desiring to live up to the code and  requirement of the office, I naturally opined that war-  correspondents rushed immediately into the thick of the fight. Later  I discovered what a mistake that was. Only very young and green  ones do so. The seasoned correspondent is inclined to view the  whole affair more dispassionately and with a larger perspective.  But being of the verdant variety, I naturally figured that if the  Germans were smashing down through Belgium onto Liege that  that was where I should be. By entering gingerly through the back  door of Holland, I planned to join them in their march down the  Meuse River.    To The Hague came descriptions of the hordes pressing down out  of the north through the fire-swept, blood-drenched plain of  northern Belgium. This could be seen from the Dutch frontier at  Maastricht. But passage thereto was interdicted by the military  authorities. Ambassador Van Dyke's efforts were unavailing.  Possessing a red-card, I enlisted the help of Troelstra, the socialist  leader of the Netherlands.    He had just returned from an audience with the Queen. The  government, seeking to rally all classes to face a grave crisis, was  paying court to the labor leaders. Accordingly, the war department,  at Troelstra's behest, received me with a handsome show of  deference. I was escorted from one gold-laced officer to another.  Each one smiled kindly, listened attentively and regretted  exceedingly that the granting of the desired permission lay outside  his own particular jurisdiction. They were polite, ingratiating,  obsequious even, but quite unanimous. At the end I came out by  the same door wherein I went--minus a permission.    Up till now my progress through the fringes of the war zone had  been in defiance of all orders and advice. Having failed here  officially, I took the matter in my own hands. Finding a seat in a  military train, I stuck steadfastly by it so long as our general  direction was south. At Eindhoven hunger compelled me to alight.  As I was stepping up to the hotel-bar, I felt a tap on my shoulder  and some one in excellent English said:    \"You are under suspicion, sir. Follow me. Don't look around. Don't  get excited. If you are all right you don't need to get excited; if you  aren't it won't do you any good to get excited.\"    With this running fire of comment he led me into a side-room  where a half-hour's examination satisfied him of my good intent.  Without further untoward incident I came to Maastricht in  Limbourg. Limbourg is the name of the narrow strip of Dutch  territory which runs down between Germany and Belgium. At one  place this tongue of land is but a few miles wide. If the Germans  could have marched their troops directly across this they might  have been spared the two weeks' slaughter at the forts of Liege  and Paris, in all probability, would have fallen before them. It was a  great temptation to the Germans. That's the reason the Dutch  troops had been massed here by the tens of thousands--to  prevent Germany succumbing to that temptation.    At our approach to the great Meuse bridge an officer shouted into  each compartment:    \"Every window closed. All cigars and pipes extinguished.\"    \"Why?\" we asked.    \"The bridge is mined with explosives and a stray spark might set  them off,\" a soldier informed us.    The first German attempt to set foot on the bridge would be the  signal for sending the great structure crashing skywards.    The end of the run was Maastricht, now become a town of crucial  interest. It was like a city besieged. Barricades of barbed wire and  paving stones ripped from street ran everywhere. Iron rails and  ties blocked the exits and the small cannon disconcertingly thrust  their nozzles down upon one out of the windows.    I lingered here long enough to secure a carriage and with it made  quick time across the harvest fields. We were soon up on the little  hill back of Meuse. The sun was sinking and for the first time war,  in all its terrible spectacular splendor, smote me hard. From the hill  at my feet there stretched away a great plain filled with a dense  mass of German soldiery. One could scarcely believe that there  were men there so well did their gray-green coats blend with the  landscape. One would think that they were indeed a part of it,  could he not feel the atmosphere vibrant with the mass personality  of the myriad warriors tramping down the crops of the peasants. In  the rear the commissariat vans and artillery still came lumbering  up, while in the very front pranced the horses of the dreaded  Uhlans, who looked with contempt, I imagined, on the Dutch  soldiers as they stood there with the warning that here was  Netherlands soil.    In the fighting German and Belgian troops had already been  pushed up against this line. Here they were greeted with the  challenge: \"Lay down your arms. This is the neutral soil of  Holland.\" Thus many were interned until the end of the war.    As even darkened into night, the endless plain became stippled  over with points of flame from countless campfires. There were  beauty and mystery in this vast menace sweeping the soul of the  onlooker now with horror, and now with admiration. There was a  terrible background to the spectacle--glowing red and luminous. It  was made of the still blazing towns of Mouland and Vise, burned to  the ground by order of the invaders. The fire had been set as a  warning to the inhabitants round about. They were taking the  warning and hastening by the thousands across the border into  Holland, their only haven of safety.    When we drove down from the hill into Eysden, we were in the  midst of these peasants, fleeing before the red wrath rolling up into  the sky. They came shambling in with a few possessions on which  they had hurriedly laid their hands, singly or in families, a pitiful  procession of the disinherited.    Some of the men were moaning as they marched along, but most  of them were taking it with the tragic oxlike resignation of the  peasant, stupefied more than terrified, puzzled why these soldiers  were coming down into their quiet little villages to fight out their  quarrels. The women were crying out to Mary and all the saints.  Indeed all the little crosses along the waysides or in the walls were  decked with flowers in gratitude for what had been spared them. In  most cases it was little more than their lives, their brood of  children, and their dogs that followed on.    My driver finally landed me in a shack on the outskirts of Eysden,  which boasted the name of a hotel. It had the worst bed I ever  slept in, and the only window was a hole in the roof.    I wandered out among the unfortunates, now herded in halls and  schools and packed in the homes of the friendly villagers. They  were full of the weirdest tales of loot and murder. And while there  were no tears in their eyes there was tragedy in their voices.    \"It would be worth while getting over to the sources and verifying  the truth of these stories,\" I remarked.    \"A sheer impossibility, and only a fool would want to go,\" was one  laconic commentary.    I kept up my plaint and was overheard by Souten, head of the  Limbourg police.    \"American, aren't you?\" he interjected. \"Well, I have done more  work here in the last five days than I did in the five years that I lived  in New York. Had the best time in my life there. If you want to go  sight-seeing in Belgium, take this paper and get it countersigned at  the German consulate. It's the only one I've given out to-day.\"    I hurried off to the consul who, in return for six marks, duly  impressed it with the German seal. Later on I would gladly have  given six hundred marks to disown it.    \"Of course you understand that this is simply a paper issued by  the civil authorities,\" said the consul, as he passed it out. \"Use it at  your own risk. If you go ahead and get shot by the military  authorities, don't come back and blame us.\"    I promised that I wouldn't and was off again to my hotel.    As darkness deepened, with two Hollanders come to view the  havoc of war, I sat on the stoop of our little inn. A great rumbling of  cannon came from the direction of Tongres. A sentry shot rang out  on the frontier just across the river which flowed not ten rods away.  This was the Meuse, which ran red with the blood of the  combatants, and from which the natives drew the floating corpses  to the shore. Now its gentle lapping on the stones mingled with the  subdued murmur of our talk. In such surroundings my new friends  regaled me with stories of pillage and murder which the refugees  had been bringing in from across the border. All this produced a  distinct depreciation in the value that I had hitherto attached to my  permit to go visiting across that border. Souten's declarations of  friendship for America had been most voluble. It began dawning  on me that his apparently generous and impulsive action might  bear a different interpretation than unadulterated kindness.    At this juncture, I"]]]
