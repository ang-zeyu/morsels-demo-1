With this object he passed it backward inch by inch, hardly daring to  breathe lest that act somehow defeat his intent, and more than ever  unable to remove his eyes from the rifle, which might perhaps now hasten  to improve its waning opportunity. Something at least had been gained:  in the occupation of his mind in this attempt at self-defense he was  less sensible of the pain in his head and had ceased to wince. But he  was still dreadfully frightened and his teeth rattled like castanets.    The strip of board ceased to move to the suasion of his hand. He tugged  at it with all his strength, changed the direction of its length all he  could, but it had met some extended obstruction behind him and the end  in front was still too far away to clear the pile of debris and reach  the muzzle of the gun. It extended, indeed, nearly as far as the trigger  guard, which, uncovered by the rubbish, he could imperfectly see with  his right eye. He tried to break the strip with his hand, but had no  leverage. In his defeat, all his terror returned, augmented tenfold. The  black aperture of the rifle appeared to threaten a sharper and more  imminent death in punishment of his rebellion. The track of the bullet  through his head ached with an intenser anguish. He began to tremble  again.    Suddenly he became composed. His tremor subsided. He clenched his teeth  and drew down his eyebrows. He had not exhausted his means of defense; a  new design had shaped itself in his mind--another plan of battle.  Raising the front end of the strip of board, he carefully pushed it  forward through the wreckage at the side of the rifle until it pressed  against the trigger guard. Then he moved the end slowly outward until he  could feel that it had cleared it, then, closing his eyes, thrust it  against the trigger with all his strength! There was no explosion; the  rifle had been discharged as it dropped from his hand when the building  fell. But it did its work.           *       *       *       *       *    Lieutenant Adrian Searing, in command of the picket-guard on that part  of the line through which his brother Jerome had passed on his mission,  sat with attentive ears in his breastwork behind the line. Not the  faintest sound escaped him; the cry of a bird, the barking of a  squirrel, the noise of the wind among the pines--all were anxiously  noted by his overstrained sense. Suddenly, directly in front of his  line, he heard a faint, confused rumble, like the clatter of a falling  building translated by distance. The lieutenant mechanically looked at  his watch. Six o'clock and eighteen minutes. At the same moment an  officer approached him on foot from the rear and saluted.    \"Lieutenant,\" said the officer, \"the colonel directs you to move forward  your line and feel the enemy if you find him. If not, continue the  advance until directed to halt. There is reason to think that the enemy  has retreated.\"    The lieutenant nodded and said nothing; the other officer retired. In a  moment the men, apprised of their duty by the non-commissioned officers  in low tones, had deployed from their rifle-pits and were moving forward  in skirmishing order, with set teeth and beating hearts.    This line of skirmishers sweeps across the plantation toward the  mountain. They pass on both sides of the wrecked building, observing  nothing. At a short distance in their rear their commander comes. He  casts his eyes curiously upon the ruin and sees a dead body half buried  in boards and timbers. It is so covered with dust that its clothing is  Confederate gray. Its face is yellowish white; the cheeks are fallen in,  the temples sunken, too, with sharp ridges about them, making the  forehead forbiddingly narrow; the upper lip, slightly lifted, shows the  white teeth, rigidly clenched. The hair is heavy with moisture, the face  as wet as the dewy grass all about. From his point of view the officer  does not observe the rifle; the man was apparently killed by the fall of  the building.    \"Dead a week,\" said the officer curtly, moving on and absently pulling  out his watch as if to verify his estimate of time. Six o'clock and  forty minutes.          KILLED AT RESACA    The best soldier of our staff was Lieutenant Herman Brayle, one of the  two aides-de-camp. I don't remember where the general picked him up;  from some Ohio regiment, I think; none of us had previously known him,  and it would have been strange if we had, for no two of us came from the  same State, nor even from adjoining States. The general seemed to think  that a position on his staff was a distinction that should be so  judiciously conferred as not to beget any sectional jealousies and  imperil the integrity of that part of the country which was still an  integer. He would not even choose officers from his own command, but by  some jugglery at department headquarters obtained them from other  brigades. Under such circumstances, a man's services had to be very  distinguished indeed to be heard of by his family and the friends of his  youth; and \"the speaking trump of fame\" was a trifle hoarse from  loquacity, anyhow.    Lieutenant Brayle was more than six feet in height and of splendid  proportions, with the light hair and gray-blue eyes which men so gifted  usually find associated with a high order of courage. As he was commonly  in full uniform, especially in action, when most officers are content to  be less flamboyantly attired, he was a very striking and conspicuous  figure. As to the rest, he had a gentleman's manners, a scholar's head,  and a lion's heart. His age was about thirty.    We all soon came to like Brayle as much as we admired him, and it was  with sincere concern that in the engagement at Stone's River--our first  action after he joined us--we observed that he had one most  objectionable and unsoldierly quality: he was vain of his courage.  During all the vicissitudes and mutations of that hideous encounter,  whether our troops were fighting in the open cotton fields, in the cedar  thickets, or behind the railway embankment, he did not once take cover,  except when sternly commanded to do so by the general, who usually had  other things to think of than the lives of his staff officers--or those  of his men, for that matter.    In every later engagement while Brayle was with us it was the same way.  He would sit his horse like an equestrian statue, in a storm of bullets  and grape, in the most exposed places--wherever, in fact, duty,  requiring him to go, permitted him to remain--when, without trouble and  with distinct advantage to his reputation for common sense, he might  have been in such security as is possible on a battlefield in the brief  intervals of personal inaction.    On foot, from necessity or in deference to his dismounted commander or  associates, his conduct was the same. He would stand like a rock in the  open when officers and men alike had taken to cover; while men older in  service and years, higher in rank and of unquestionable intrepidity,  were loyally preserving behind the crest of a hill lives infinitely  precious to their country, this fellow would stand, equally idle, on the  ridge, facing in the direction of the sharpest fire.    When battles are going on in open ground it frequently occurs that the  opposing lines, confronting each other within a stone's throw for hours,  hug the earth as closely as if they loved it. The line officers in their  proper places flatten themselves no less, and the field officers, their  horses all killed or sent to the rear, crouch beneath the infernal  canopy of hissing lead and screaming iron without a thought of personal  dignity.    In such circumstances the life of a staff officer of a brigade is  distinctly \"not a happy one,\" mainly because of its precarious tenure  and the unnerving alternations of emotion to which he is exposed. From a  position of that comparative security from which a civilian would  ascribe his escape to a \"miracle,\" he may be despatched with an order to  some commander of a prone regiment in the front line--a person for the  moment inconspicuous and not always easy to find without a deal of  search among men somewhat preoccupied, and in a din in which question  and answer alike must be imparted in the sign language. It is customary  in such cases to duck the head and scuttle away on a keen run, an object  of lively interest to some thousands of admiring marksmen. In returning  --well, it is not customary to return.    Brayle's practice was different. He would consign his horse to the care  of an orderly,--he loved his horse,--and walk quietly away on his  perilous errand with never a stoop of the back, his splendid figure,  accentuated by his uniform, holding the eye with a strange fascination.  We watched him with suspended breath, our hearts in our mouths. On one  occasion of this kind, indeed, one of our number, an impetuous  stammerer, was so possessed by his emotion that he shouted at me:    \"I'll b-b-bet you t-two d-d-dollars they d-drop him b-b-before he g-gets  to that d-d-ditch!\"    I did not accept the brutal wager; I thought they would.    Let me do justice to a brave man's memory; in all these needless  exposures of life there was no visible bravado nor subsequent narration.  In the few instances when some of us had ventured to remonstrate, Brayle  had smiled pleasantly and made some light reply, which, however, had not  encouraged a further pursuit of the subject. Once he said:    \"Captain, if ever I come to grief by forgetting your advice, I hope my  last moments will be cheered by the sound of your beloved voice  breathing into my ear the blessed words, 'I told you so.'\"    We laughed at the captain--just why we could probably not have  explained--and that afternoon when he was shot to rags from an ambuscade  Brayle remained by the body for some time,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13341"],[0,"Hymns and Spiritual Songs (#10)"],[1,"upon our eyes,  Till Christ with his reviving light,  Over our souls arise!    2 Our guilty spirits dread  To meet the wrath of heaven  But, in his righteousness array'd,  We see our sins forgiven.    3 Unholy and impure  Are all our thoughts and ways;  His hands infected nature cure  With sanctifying grace.    4 The powers of hell agree  To hold our souls in vain;  He sets the sons of bondage free,  And breaks the cursed chain.    5 Lord, we adore thy ways  To bring us near to God,  Thy sovereign power, thy healing grace,  And thine atoning blood.      Hymn 1:99.  Stones made children of Abraham; or, Grace not  conveyed by religious parents, Matt. 3. 9.    1 Vain are the hopes that rebels place  Upon their birth and blood,  Descended from a pious race;  (Their fathers now with God.)    2 He from the caves of earth and hell  Can take the hardest stones,  And fill the house of Abra'm well  With new-created sons.    3 Such wondrous power doth he possess  Who form'd our mortal frame,  Who call'd the world from emptiness,  The world obey'd and came.      Hymn 1:100.  Believe and be saved, John 3. 16 17 18.    1 Not to condemn the sons of men  Did Christ, the Son of God, appear;  No weapons in his hands are seen,  No flaming sword, nor thunder there.    2 Such was the pity of our God,  He lov'd the race of man so well,  He sent his Son to bear our load  Of sins, and save our souls from hell.    3 Sinners, believe the Saviour's word,  Trust in his mighty name and live;  A thousand joys his lips afford,  His hands a thousand blessings give.    4 But vengeance and damnation lies  On rebels who refuse the grace;  Who God's eternal Son despise  The hottest hell shall be their place.      Hymn 1:101.  Joy in heaven for a repenting sinner, Luke 15. 7-10.    1 Who can describe the joys that rise  Thro' all the courts of Paradise  To see a prodigal return,  To see an heir of glory born?    2 With joy the Father doth approve  The fruit of his eternal love;  The Son with joy looks down and sees  The purchase of his agonies.    3 The Spirit takes delight to view  The holy soul he form'd anew;  And saints and angels join to sing  The growing empire of their King.      Hymn 1:102.  The beatitudes, Matt. 5. 3-12.    1 [Bless'd are the humble souls that see  Their emptiness and poverty;  Treasures of grace to them are given,  And crowns of joy laid up in heaven.]    2 [Bless'd are the men of broken heart,  Who mourn for sin with inward smart;  The blood of Christ divinely flows,  A healing balm for all their woes.]    3 [Bless'd are the meek, who stand afar  From rage and passion, noise and war;  God will secure their happy state,  And plead their cause against the great.]    4 [Bless'd are the souls that thirst for grace,  Hunger and long for righteousness,  They shall be well supply'd and fed,  With living streams and living bread.]    5 [Bless'd are the men whose bowels move  And melt with sympathy and love;  From Christ the Lord shall they obtain  Like sympathy and love again.]    6 [Bless'd are the pure, whose hearts are clean  From the defiling powers of sin,  With endless pleasure they shall see  A God of spotless purity.]    7 [Bless'd are the men of peaceful life  Who quench the coals of growing strife,  They shall be call'd the heirs of bliss,  The sons of God, the God of peace.]    8 [Bless'd are the sufferers who partake  Of pain and shame for Jesus' sake;  Their souls shall triumph in the Lord,  Glory and joy are their reward.]      Hymn 1:103.  Not ashamed of the gospel, C Tim. 1. 12.    1 I'm not asham'd to own my Lord,  Or to defend his cause,  Maintain the honour of his word,  The glory of his cross.    2 Jesus, my God, I know his Name,  His Name is all my trust,  Nor will he put my soul to shame,  Nor let my hope be lost.    3 Firm as his throne his promise stands,  And he can well secure  What I've committed to his hands  Till the decisive hour.    4 Then will he own my worthless name  Before his Father's face,  And in the new Jerusalem  Appoint my soul a place.      Hymn 1:104.  A state of nature and of grace, 1 Cor. 6. 10 11.    1 Not the malicious or profane,  The wanton or the proud,  Nor thieves, nor slanderers shall obtain  The kingdom of our God.    2 Surprising grace! and such were we  By nature and by sin,  Heirs of immortal misery,  Unholy and unclean.    3 But we are wash'd in Jesus' blood,  We're pardon'd thro' his Name;  And the good Spirit of our God  Has sanctify'd our frame.    4 O for a persevering power  To keep thy just commands!  We would defile our hearts no more,  No more pollute our hands.      Hymn 1:105.  Heaven invisible and holy, 1 Cor. 2. 9 10. Rev. 21. 27.    1 Nor eye has seen, nor ear has heard,  Nor sense nor reason known  What joys the Father hath prepar'd  For those that love the Son.    2 But the good Spirit of the Lord  Reveals a heaven to come:  The beams of glory in his word  Allure and guide us home.    3 Pure are the joys above the sky,  And all the region peace;  No wanton lips, nor envious eye  Can see or taste the bliss.    4 Those holy gates for ever bar  Pollution, sin, and shame;  None shall obtain admittance there  But followers of the Lamb.    5 He keeps the Father's book of life,  There all their names are found;  The hypocrite in vain shall strive  To tread the heavenly ground.      Hymn 1:106.  Dead to sin by the cross of Christ, Rom. 6. 1 2 6.    1 Shall we go on to sin  Because thy grace abounds,  Or crucify the Lord again,  And open all his wounds?    2 Forbid it, mighty God,  Nor let it e'er be said  That we whose sins are crucify'd  Should raise them from the dead.    3 We will be slaves no more,  Since Christ has made us free,  Has nail'd our tyrants to his cross,  And bought our liberty.      Hymn 1:107.  The fall and recovery of man; or, Christ and Satan  at enmity, Gen. 3 1 15 17 Gal. 4. 4. Col. 2. 15.    1 Deceiv'd by subtle snares of hell  Adam our head, our father fell,  When Satan in the serpent hid  Propos'd the fruit that God forbid.    2 Death was the threatening; death began  To take possession of the man;  His unborn race receiv'd the wound,  And heavy curses smote the ground.    3 But Satan found a worse reward;  Thus saith the vengeance of the Lord,  \"Let everlasting hatred be  \"Betwixt the woman's seed and thee.    4 \"The woman's seed shall be my Son,  He shall destroy what thou hast done,  \"Shall break thy head, and only feel  \"Thy malice raging at his heel.\"    5 [He spake; and bid four thousand years  Roll on;--at length his Son appears;  Angels with joy descend to earth,  And sing the young Redeemer's birth.    6 Lo, by the sons of hell he dies;  But, as he hung 'twixt earth and skies,  He gave their prince a fatal blow,  And triumph'd o'er the powers below.]      Hymn 1:108.  Christ unseen and beloved, 1 Pet. 1. 8.    1 Not with our mortal eyes  Have we beheld the Lord,  Yet we rejoice to hear his Name,  And love him in his word.    2 On earth we want the sight  Of our Redeemer's face,  Yet, Lord, our inmost thoughts delight  To dwell upon thy grace.    3 And when we taste thy love,  Our joys divinely grow  Unspeakable, like those above,  And heaven begins below.      Hymn 1:109.  The value of Christ and his righteousness, Phil. 3. 7 8 9.    1 No more, my God, I boast no more  Of all the duties I have done;  I quit the hopes I held before  To trust the merits of thy Son.    2 Now for the love I bear his Name,  What was my gain I count my loss,  My former pride I call my shame,  And nail my glory to his cross.    3 Yes, and I must and will esteem  All things but loss for Jesus' sake  O may my soul be found in him,  And of his righteousness partake.    4 The best obedience of my hands  Dares not appear before thy throne;  But faith can answer thy demands  By pleading what my Lord has done.      Hymn 1:110.  Death and immediate glory, 2 Cor. 5. 1 5-8.    1 There is a house not made with hands,  Eternal and on high:  And here my spirit waiting stands  Till God shall bid it fly.    2 Shortly this prison of my clay  Must be dissolv'd and fall,  Then, O my soul, with joy obey  Thy heavenly Father's call.    3 'Tis he by his almighty grace  That forms thee fit for heaven,  And as an earnest of the place,  Has his own Spirit given.    4 We walk by faith of joys to come,  Faith lives upon his word;  But while the body is our home  We're absent from the Lord.    5 'Tis pleasant to believe thy grace,  But we had rather see;  We would be absent from the flesh,  And present, Lord, with thee.      Hymn 1:111.  Salvation by grace, Titus 3. 3-7.    1 [Lord, we confess our numerous faults,  How great our guilt has been!  Foolish and vain were all our thoughts,  And all our lives were sin.    2 But O, my soul, for ever praise,  For ever love his Name,  Who turns thy feet from dangerous ways  Of folly, sin, and shame.]    3 ['Tis not by works of righteousness  Which our own hands have done;  But we are sav'd by sovereign grace  Abounding thro' his Son.]    4 'Tis from the mercy of our God  That all our hopes begin;  'Tis by the water and the blood  Our souls are wash'd from sin.    5 'Tis thro' the purchase of his death,  Who hung upon the tree,  The Spirit is sent down to breathe  On such dry bones as we.    6 Rais'd from the dead we live anew;  And justify'd by grace  We shall appear in glory too,  And see our Father's face.      Hymn 1:112.  The brazen serpent; or, Looking to Jesus,  John 3. 14 15 16.    1 So did the Hebrew prophet raise  The brazen serpent high,  The wounded felt immediate ease,  The camp forbore to die.    2 \"Look upward in the dying hour,  And live,\" the prophet cries;  But Christ performs a nobler cure,  When Faith lifts up her eyes.    3 High on the cross the Saviour hung,  High in the heavens he reigns:  Here sinners by th' old serpent stung  Look, and forget their pains.    4 When God's own Son is lifted up,  A dying world revives,  The Jew beholds the glorious hope,  Th' expiring Gentile lives.
