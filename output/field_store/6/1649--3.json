I'll send Bower to you.\"    Tom rather liked the new workman, who seemed quiet and efficient. He  did not ask questions, either, about the machine on which he was  engaged, but did as he was told. As Tom had said, he kept his plans and  drawing under lock and key--in a safe to be exact--and he did not think  they were in any danger from his new helper.    But Tom Swift held into altogether too slight regard the powers of  those who were opposed to him. He did not appreciate the depths to  which they would stoop to gain their ends.    He had been working hard on his new device, and had reached a point  further along than when the other motor had exploded. He began to see  success ahead of him, and he was jubilant. Whether this made him  careless does not matter, but the fact was that he left Bower more to  himself, and alone in the experimental shop several times.    And it was on one of these occasions, when Tom had been for some time  in one of the other shops, where he and Jackson were in consultation  over a new machine, that as he came back to the test room unexpectedly,  he saw Bower move hastily away from in front of the safe. Moreover, Tom  was almost certain he had heard the steel door clang shut as he  approached the building.    And then, before he could ask his helper a question, Tom looked from a  window and saw a stranger running hastily along the side of the  building where his trial motor was being set up.    \"Who's that? Who is that man? Did he come in here? Was he tampering  with my safe?\" cried Tom. He saw Bower hesitate and change color, and  Tom knew it was time to act.    The window was open, and with one bound the young inventor was out and  running after the stranger he had seen departing in such a hurry. The  man was but a short distance ahead of him, and Tom saw he was stuffing  some papers into his pocket.    \"Here! Come back! Stop!\" ordered Tom, but the man ran on the faster.    \"That's a spy as sure as guns!\" reflected Tom Swift. \"And Bower is in  with him!\" he added. \"I've got to catch that fellow!\" and he speeded  his pace as he ran after the fellow.          CHAPTER X    A BIG SPLASH      There was no question in the mind of Tom Swift but that the man he was  running after was guilty of some wrong-doing. In the first place he was  a stranger, and had no right inside the big fence that surrounded the  Swift machine plant. Then, too, the very fact that he ran away was  suspicious.    And this, coupled with the confusion on the part of Bower, and his  proximity to the safe, made Tom fear that some of his plans had been  stolen. These he was very anxious to recover if this strange man had  them, and so he raced after him with all speed.    \"Stop! Stop!\" called Tom, but the on-racing stranger did not heed.    The cries of the young inventor soon attracted the attention of his  men, and Jackson and some of the others came running from their various  shops to give whatever aid was needed. But they were all too far away  to give effective chase.    \"Bower might have come with me if he had wanted to help,\" thought Tom.  But a backward glance over his shoulder did not show that the new  helper was engaging in the pursuit, and he could have started almost on  the same terms as Tom himself.    The runaway, looking back to see how near the young inventor was to  him, suddenly changed his course, and, noting this, Tom Swift thought:    \"I've got him now! He'll be bogged if he runs that way,\" for the way  led to a piece of swampy land that, after the recent rains, was a  veritable bog which was dangerous for cattle at least; and more than  one man had been caught there.    \"He can't run across the swamp, that's sure,\" reflected Tom with some  satisfaction. \"I'll get him all right!\"    But he wanted to capture the man, if possible, before he reached the  bog, and, to this end, Tom increased his speed to such good end that  presently, on the firm ground that bordered the swamp, Tom was almost  within reaching distance of the stranger.    But the latter kept up running, and dodged and turned so that Tom could  not lay hands on him. Suddenly, turning around a clump of trees the  fleeing man headed straight for a veritable mud hole that lay directly  in his path. It was part of the swamp--the most liquid part of the bog  and a home of frogs and lizards.    Too late, the man, who was evidently unaware of the proximity of the  swamp, saw his danger. His further flight was cut off by the mud hole,  but it was too late to turn back. Tom Swift was at his heels now, and  seeing that it was impossible to grab the man, Tom did the next best  thing. He stuck out his foot and tripped him, and tripped him right on  the edge of the mud hole, so that the man fell in with a big splash,  the muddy water flying all around, some even over the young inventor.    For a moment the man disappeared completely beneath the surface, for  the mud hole was rather deep just where Tom had thrown him. Then there  was another violent agitation of the surface, and a very woebegone and  muddy face was raised from the slough, followed by the rest of the  figure of the man. Slowly he got to his feet, mud and water dripping  from him. He cleared his face by rubbing his hands over it, not that it  made his countenance clean, but it removed masses of mud from his eyes,  nose, and mouth, so that he could see and speak, though his first  operation was to gasp for breath.    \"What--what are you doin'?\" he demanded of Tom, and as the man opened  his mouth to speak Tom was aware of a glitter, which disclosed the  'fact that the man had a large front tooth of gold.    \"What am I doing?\" repeated Tom. \"I think it's up to you to answer that  question, not me. What are you doing?\"    \"You--you tripped me into this mud hole!\" declared the man.    \"I did, yes; because you were trespassing on my property, and ran away  instead of stopping when I told you to,\" went on Tom.  \"Who are you and  what are you doing? What were you doing with Bower at my shop?\"    \"Nothin'! I wasn't doin' nothin'!\"    \"Well, we'll inquire into that. I want to see what you have in your  pockets before I believe you. Come on out!\"    \"You haven't any right to go through my pockets!\" blustered the  stranger.    \"Oh, haven't I? Well, I'm going to take the right. Jackson--Koku--just  see that he doesn't get away. We'll take him back and search him,\" and  Tom motioned to his chief machinist and the giant, who had reached the  scene, to take charge of the man. But Koku was sufficient for this  purpose, and the mud-bespattered stranger seemed to shrink as he saw  the big creature approach him. There was no question of running away  after that.    \"Bring him along,\" ordered Tom, and Koku, taking a tight grip on the  man by the slack of his garments behind, walked him along toward the  office, the mud and water splashing and oozing from his shoes at every  step.    \"Now you look here!\" the gold-toothed man cried, as he was forced  along, \"you ain't got any right to detain me. I ain't done nothin'!\"  And each time he spoke the bright tooth in his mouth glittered in the  sun.    \"I don't know whether you've done anything or not,\" said Tom.  \"I'm  going to take you back and see what you and Bower have to say. He may  know something about this.\"    \"If he does I don't believe he'll tell,\" said Jackson.    \"Why not?\" asked Tom, quickly.    \"Because he's gone.\"    \"Gone! Bower gone?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Jackson. \"I saw him running out of the experiment shop  as we raced along to help you. I didn't think, at the time, that he was  doing more than go for aid, perhaps. But I see the game now.\"    \"Oh, you mean--him?\" and Tom pointed to the dripping figure.    \"Yes,\" said Jackson in a low voice, as Koku went on ahead with his  prisoner. \"If, as you say, this man was in league with Bower, the  latter has smelled a rat and skipped. He has run away, and I only hope  he hasn't done any damage or got hold of any of your plans.\"    \"We'll soon know about that,\" said Tom. \"I wonder who is at the bottom  of this?\"    \"Maybe those men you wouldn't work for,\" suggested the machinist.    \"You mean Gale and Ware of the Universal Flying Machine Company?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Oh, I don't believe they'd stoop to any such measures as this--sending  spies around,\" replied Tom. \"But I can't be too careful.  We'll  investigate.\"    The first result of the investigation was to disclose the fact that  Bower was gone. He had taken his few possessions and left the Swift  plant while Tom was racing after the stranger. A hasty examination of  the safe did not reveal anything missing, as Tom's plans and papers  were intact. But they showed evidences of having been looked over, for  they were out of the regular order in which the young inventor kept  them.    \"I begin to see it,\" said Tom, musingly. \"Bower must have managed to  open the safe while I was gone, and he must have made a hasty copy of  some of the drawings of the silent motor, and passed them out of the  window to this gold-tooth man, who tried to make off with them. Did you  find anything on him?\" he asked, as one of the men who had been  instructed to search the stranger came into the office just then.    \"Not a thing, Mr. Swift! Not a thing!\" was the answer. \"We took off  every bit of his clothes and wrapped him in a blanket. He's in the  engine room getting dry now. But there isn't a thing in any of his  pockets.\"    \"But I saw him stuffing some papers in as he ran away from me,\" said  Tom. \"We must be sure about this. And don't let the fellow get away  until I question him.\"    \"Oh, he's safe enough,\" answered the man. \"Koku is guarding him. He  won't get away.\"    \"Then I'll have a look at his clothes,\" decided Tom. \"He may have a  secret pocket.\"    But nothing like this was disclosed, and the most careful search did  not reveal anything incriminating in the man's garments.    \"He might have thrown away any papers Bower gave "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12855"],[0,"Elizabethan Sea-Dogs: A Chronicle of Drake and His Companions (#10)"],[1,"its,  is particularly interesting as being the first account of America ever  written by an English eyewitness.    Hawkins made for Teneriffe in the Canaries, off the west of Africa.  There, to everybody's great 'amaze,' the Spaniards 'appeared levelling  of bases [small portable cannon] and arquebuses, with divers others, to  the number of fourscore, with halberds, pikes, swords, and targets.' But  when it was found that Hawkins had been taken for a privateer, and when  it is remembered that four hundred privateering vessels--English and  Huguenot--had captured seven hundred Spanish prizes during the previous  summer of 1563, there was and is less cause for 'amaze.' Once  explanations had been made, 'Peter de Ponte gave Master Hawkins as  gentle entertainment as if he had been his own brother.' Peter was a  trader with a great eye for the main chance.    Sparke was lost in wonder over the famous Arbol Santo tree of Ferro, 'by  the dropping whereof the inhabitants and cattle are satisfied with  water, for other water they have none on the island.' This is not quite  the traveller's tale it appears to be. There are three springs on the  island of Teneriffe. But water is scarce, and the Arbol Santo, a sort of  gigantic laurel standing alone on a rocky ledge, did actually supply two  cisterns, one for men and the other for cattle. The morning mist  condensing on the innumerable smooth leaves ran off and was caught in  suitable conduits.    In Africa Hawkins took many 'Sapies which do inhabit about Rio Grande  [now the Jeba River] which do jag their flesh, both legs, arms, and  bodies as workmanlike as a jerkin-maker with us pinketh a jerkin.' It is  a nice question whether these Sapies gained or lost by becoming slaves  to white men; for they were already slaves to black conquerors who used  them as meat with the vegetables they forced them to raise. The Sapies  were sleek pacifists who found too late that the warlike Samboses, who  inhabited the neighboring desert, were not to be denied.    'In the island of Sambula we found almadies or canoas, which are made of  one piece of wood, digged out like a trough, but of a good proportion,  being about eight yards long and one in breadth, having a beak-head and  a stern very proportionably made, and on the outside artificially  carved, and painted red and blue.' Neither _almadie_ nor canoa is, of  course, an African word. One is Arabic for a cradle (_el-mahd_); the  other, from which we get _canoe_, is what the natives told Columbus they  called their dugouts; and dugout canoes are very like primitive cradles.  Thus Sparke was the first man to record in English, from actual  experience, the aboriginal craft whose name, both East and West, was  suggested to primeval man by the idea of his being literally 'rocked in  the cradle of the deep.'    Hawkins did not have it all his own way with the negroes, by whom he  once lost seven of his own men killed and twenty-seven wounded. 'But the  captain in a singular wise manner carried himself with countenance very  cheerful outwardly, although inwardly his heart was broken in pieces for  it; done to this end, that the Portugais, being with him, should not  presume to resist against him.' After losing five more men, who were  eaten by sharks, Hawkins shaped his course westward with a good cargo of  negroes and 'other merchandises.' 'Contrary winds and some tornados  happened to us very ill. But the Almighty God, who never suffereth His  elect to perish, sent us the ordinary Breeze, which never left us till  we came to an island of the Cannibals' (Caribs of Dominica), who, by the  by, had just eaten a shipload of Spaniards.    Hawkins found the Spanish officials determined to make a show of  resisting unauthorized trade. But when 'he prepared 100 men well armed  with bows, arrows, arquebuses, and pikes, with which he marched  townwards,' the officials let the sale of blacks go on. Hawkins was  particularly anxious to get rid of his 'lean negroes,' who might die in  his hands and become a dead loss; so he used the 'gunboat argument' to  good effect. Sparke kept his eyes open for side-shows and was delighted  with the alligators, which he called crocodiles, perhaps for the sake of  the crocodile tears. 'His nature is to cry and sob like a Christian to  provoke his prey to come to him; and thereupon came this proverb, that  is applied unto women when they weep, _lachrymoe crocodili_.'    From the West Indies Hawkins made for Florida, which was then an object  of exceptional desire among adventurous Englishmen. De Soto, one of  Pizarro's lieutenants, had annexed it to Spain and, in 1539, had started  off inland to discover the supposed Peru of North America. Three years  later he had died while descending the valley of the Mississippi. Six  years later again, the first Spanish missionary in Florida 'taking upon  him to persuade the people to subjection, was by them taken, and his  skin cruelly pulled over his ears, and his flesh eaten.' Hawkins's men  had fair warning on the way; for 'they, being ashore, found a dead man,  dried in a manner whole, with other heads and bodies of men,'  apparently smoked like hams. 'But to return to our purpose,' adds the  indefatigable Sparke, 'the captain in the ship's pinnace sailed along  the shore and went into every creek, speaking with divers of the  _Floridians_, because he would understand where the Frenchmen  inhabited.' Finally he found them 'in the river of _May_ [now St. John's  River] and standing in 30 degrees and better.' There was 'great store of  maize and mill, and grapes of great bigness. Also deer great plenty,  which came upon the sands before them.'    So here were the three rivals overlapping again--the annexing Spaniards,  the would-be colonizing French, and the persistently trading English.  There were, however, no Spaniards about at that time. This was the  second Huguenot colony in Florida. Rene de Laudonniere had founded it in  1564. The first one, founded two years earlier by Jean Ribaut, had  failed and Ribaut's men had deserted the place. They had started for  home in 1563, had suffered terrible hardships, had been picked up by an  English vessel, and taken, some to France and some to England, where the  court was all agog about the wealth of Florida. People said there were  mines so bright with jewels that they had to be approached at night  lest the flashing light should strike men blind. Florida became  proverbial; and Elizabethan wits made endless fun of it. _Stolida_, or  the land of fools, and _Sordida_, or the land of muck-worms, were some  of their _jeux d'esprit_. Everyone was 'bound for Florida,' whether he  meant to go there or not, despite Spanish spheres of influence, the  native cannibals, and pirates by the way.    Hawkins, on the contrary, did not profess to be bound for Florida.  Nevertheless he arrived there, and probably had intended to do so from  the first, for he took with him a Frenchman who had been in Ribaut's  colony two years before, and Sparke significantly says that 'the land is  more than any [one] king Christian is able to inhabit.' However this may  be, Hawkins found the second French colony as well as 'a French ship of  fourscore ton, and two pinnaces of fifteen ton apiece by her ... and a  fort, in which their captain Monsieur Laudonniere was, with certain  soldiers therein.' The colony had not been a success. Nor is this to be  wondered at when we remember that most of the 'certain soldiers' were  ex-pirates, who wanted gold, and 'who would not take the pains so much  as to fish in the river before their doors, but would have all things  put in their mouths.' Eighty of the original two hundred 'went a-roving'  to the West Indies, 'where they spoiled the Spaniards ... and were of  such haughty stomachs that they thought their force to be such that no  man durst meddle with them.... But God ... did indurate their hearts in  such sort that they lingered so long that a [Spanish] ship and galliasse  being made out of St. Domingo ... took twenty of them, whereof the most  part were hanged ... and twenty-five escaped ... to Florida, where ...  they were put into prison [by Laudonniere, against whom they had  mutinied] and ... four of the chiefest being condemned, at the request  of the soldiers did pass the arquebusers, and then were hanged upon a  gibbet.' Sparke got the delightful expression 'at the request of the  soldiers did pass the arquebusers' from a 'very polite' Frenchman. Could  any one tell you more politely, in mistranslated language, how to stand  up and be shot?    Sparke was greatly taken with the unknown art of smoking. 'The  Floridians ... have an herb dried, who, with a cane and an earthen cup  in the end, with fire and the dried herbs put together, do suck through  the cane the smoke thereof, which smoke satisfieth their hunger, and  therewith they live four or five days without meat or drink. And this  all the Frenchmen used for this purpose; yet do they hold opinion withal  that it causeth water and steam to void from their stomachs.' The other  'commodities of the land' were 'more than are yet known to any man.' But  Hawkins was bent on trade, not colonizing. He sold the _Tiger_, a barque  of fifty tons, to Laudonniere for seven hundred crowns and sailed north  on the first voyage ever made along the coast of the United States by an  all-English crew. Turning east off Newfoundland 'with a good large wind,  the 20 September [1565] we came to Padstow, in Cornwall, God be thanked!  in safety, with the loss of twenty persons in all the voyage, and with  great profit to the venturers, as also to the whole realm, in bringing  home both gold, silver, pearls, and other jewels great store. His name,  therefore, be praised for evermore. Amen.'    Hawkins was now a rich man, a favorite at court, and quite the rage in  London. The Queen was very gracious and granted him the well-known coat  of arms with the crest of 'a demi-Moor,"]]]
