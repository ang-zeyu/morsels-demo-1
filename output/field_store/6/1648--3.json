At night the men rolled up in their blankets and lay down under a  tree to sleep; but while the one in the striped blanket was still  awake two spirits came near and saw him.    \"Oh,\" he heard one spirit say to the other, \"here we have something  to eat, for here is a little wild pig.\"    Then the man quickly took the blanket off one of his sleeping  companions and put his own in its place. Very soon the spirits came  and ate the man under the striped blanket.    Since that time the Tinguian never sleep under that kind of a blanket  if they are where the spirits can get them.        The Alan and the Hunters    _Tinguian_      Two men once went to hunt wild pig in the mountains, and after some  time they speared and killed one, but they had no fire over which to  singe it.    One man climbed a tree to see if there was a fire near by, and  discovering smoke at some distance, he started toward it. When he  reached the place, he found that the fire was in the house of an Alan,  [82] and he was very much afraid; but creeping up into the house,  he found that the Alan and her baby were fast asleep.    He stepped on tip-toe, but nevertheless the Alan was awakened and  called out:    \"Epogow, [83] what do you want?\"    \"I should like to get some fire,\" said the man, \"for we have killed  a wild pig.\"    The Alan gave him the fire, and then taking her basket she went with  him to the place where the pig was.    After they had singed the animal, the Alan cut it up with her long  nails and handed the liver to the man, telling him to take it to her  house to feed the baby.    The man started, and on the way he ate the liver. When he reached  the Alan's house he did not know what to do. For some time he looked  around, and then seeing a large caldron of hot water on the fire,  he threw the baby into it and went back.    \"Did the baby eat well?\" asked the Alan.    \"Very well,\" said the man.    Then she put most of the meat into her basket and started home. As  soon as she had gone, the man told his companion what he had done,  and they were so frightened that they ran to hide.    When the Alan reached home and found the baby dead in the hot water,  she was very angry and started back immediately to find the men, who,  in the meantime, had climbed a high tree that stood near the water.    The Alan looked down into the water, and seeing the reflection of  the men, she reached in her long hand with the fingers that pointed  backward, but when she could not touch them, she looked up and saw  them in the tall tree.    \"How did you get up there?\" she cried angrily.    \"We climbed up feet first,\" called down the men.    The Alan, determined to get them, caught hold of a vine and started  up the tree feet first, but before she quite reached them, they cut  the vine and she fell to the ground and was killed. [84]    Then the men came down and went to the Alan's house, where they found  a jar full of beads and another of gold, and these they brought with  them when they returned home.        Man and the Alan    _Tinguian_      A Tinguian was once walking along a trail in the wood when he heard a  strange sound in a large tree near him, and looking up he was startled  to see that it was the home of the Alan--spirits who live in the wood.    He stopped and gazed for a moment at the horrible creatures, large  as people, hanging from the limbs of the tree with their heads down  like bats. They had wings to fly, and their toes were at the back  of their feet, while their long fingers, which pointed backward,  were fastened at the wrist.    \"Surely,\" thought the man, \"these terrible beings will eat me if  they can catch me. I will run away as fast as I can while they are  asleep.\" He tried to run but he was too frightened, and after a few  steps he fell face down on the ground.    At this the Alan began to wail loudly, for they saw him fall and  believed him dead And they came down out of the tree with gold and  beads which they laid on him.    After a while the man gathered courage and, jumping up, he cried as  loudly as he could, \"Go away!\"    The Alan did not move, but they looked at him and said: \"Give us the  one bead _nagaba_ [a peculiar bead of double effect], and you may  have the rest.\" When the man refused to do this, they were angry and  turned away, crying, \"Then we are going to burn your house, for you  are a bad man.\"    Thereupon the man went home as fast as he could go, but very soon  after that his house burned, for the Alan kept their word.        Sogsogot    _Tinguian_      One day, a long time ago, some men went to the mountains to hunt deer  and wild pig, and among them was one named Sogsogot.    They all went into the thick forest to look for game, but after a  while Sogsogot called his dog and withdrew to an open spot near by,  where he waited for the deer to come out.    While he stood there eagerly watching, a big bird [85] swooped down,  caught him in its claws, and carried him away. Far off over the  mountains the bird soared, until finally it came to a big tree where  it had its nest, and here it left the man and flew away.    Sogsogot's first thought was to make his escape, but he found that  the tree was so tall that he could not get down, and after a time he  ceased his attempts to get away and began to look over his companions  in the nest--two young birds and three little pigs.    By and by he became hungry, so he cut up the three little pigs, and  after he had eaten all he wished he fed the two birds. When this meat  was gone the mother bird brought more pigs and deer, and the man had  all he could eat. Then he fed the little birds, which grew very fast  and soon were able to fly. One day when they were standing on the  edge of the nest Sogsogot caught hold of the birds' legs, and they  fluttered down and carried him safely to the ground.    He hastened home as fast as he could go and told the people of his  wonderful trip. They made a ceremony for the spirits, and all the  people rejoiced that the lost man had returned.    Some time after this Sogsogot went to a hostile town to fight, and  while he was gone his wife died. On the way back to his town he met  the spirit of his wife driving a cow and two pigs, and not knowing  that she was a spirit he asked her where she was going.    \"I am not a person any more,\" she answered him; \"I am dead.\" And when  he wanted to touch her hand, she gave him only her shortest finger. He  begged to go with her so she said, \"Go first to our home and get a  white chicken; then follow the footmarks of the cow and pigs.\"    He did as she commanded him, and after a while he came to a place  where she was bathing in the river. She said to him:    \"Now you may come with me to our spirit town. [86] I shall hide you  in the rice-bin and shall bring food to you every day. But at night  the people in the town will want to eat you, and when they come to  the bin you must take some of the feathers of the white chicken and  throw at them.\"    The man went with her, and when they arrived at the spirit town she  hid him in the rice-bin. At night the people came to eat him, as she  had said they would; but when he threw the chicken feathers at them  they were frightened away.    For two weeks Sogsogot lived in this place, but when the feathers  were nearly gone he was afraid to stay any longer, for every night  the spirits came to eat him. He begged his wife to allow him to go,  and finally she showed him the way home, giving him rice to eat on  his journey.    As soon as the man arrived home and inquired for his wife, the  people told him that she had died and they had buried her under the  house. Then he knew that it was her spirit that had taken him to the  strange town.        The Mistaken Gifts    _Tinguian_      When Siagon was about eight years old his parents began looking for  a girl who would make a suitable wife. At last when they had decided  on a beautiful maiden, who lived some distance from them, they sent  a man to her parents to ask if they would like Siagon for a son-in-law.    Now when the man arrived at the girl's house the people were all  sitting on the floor eating periwinkle, and as they sucked the meat  out of the shell, they nodded their heads. The man, looking in at  the door, saw them nod, and he thought they were nodding at him. So  he did not tell them his errand, but returned quickly to the boy's  parents and told them that all the people at the girl's house were  favorable to the union.    Siagon's parents were very much pleased that their proposal had been  so kindly received, and immediately prepared to go to the girl's  house to arrange for the wedding.    Finally all was ready and they started for her house, carrying with  them as presents for her parents two carabao, two horses, two cows,  four iron kettles, sixteen jars of basi, two blankets, and two  little pigs.    The surprise of the girl's people knew no bounds when they saw all  this coming to their house, for they had not even thought of Siagon  marrying their daughter. [87]        The Boy who Became a Stone    _Tinguian_      One day a little boy named Elonen sat out in the yard making a bird  snare, and as he worked, a little bird called to him: \"Tik-tik-lo-den\"  (come and catch me).    \"I am making a snare for you,\" said the boy; but the bird continued  to call until the snare was finished.    Then Elonen ran and threw the snare over the bird and caught it, and he  put it in a jar in his house while he went with the other boys to swim.    While he was away, his grandmother grew hungry, so she ate the bird,  and when Elonen returned and found that his bird was gone, he was so  sad that he wished he might go away and never come back. He went out  into the forest and walked a long distance, until finally he came to  a big stone and said: \"Stone, open your mouth and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12829"],[0,"Abélard, Tome I (#10)"],[1,"le. Plus de resistance,  plus meme de rivalite. Abelard allait regner sans partage dans l'ecole,  lorsqu'il fut encore oblige de quitter la France. Son pere s'etait,  comme on disait alors, converti. Il venait d'embrasser la vie  religieuse, et Lucie, sa femme, se disposait, suivant la regle, a imiter  cet exemple. Tendrement aimee de son fils, elle l'appela pres d'elle.  Tous deux avaient leurs adieux a se faire dans le siecle. Il partit,  il revit la Bretagne et sa mere, et quand apres une courte absence il  revint a Paris; il trouva l'ecole silencieuse et libre. Guillaume de  Champeaux, abandonnant a la fois la retraite et l'enseignement,  s'etait refugie dans les dignites ecclesiastiques. Il etait eveque de  Chalons-sur-Marne.    C'avait ete un professeur tres-habile, un logicien tres-ingenieux, et  sa reputation etait grande; mais elle avait vieilli. Il n'avait su ni  souffrir la contradiction ni repousser l'attaque. Son caractere manquait  a la fois de generosite et d'energie, et, dans le combat, son esprit lui  fit faute. Mais il fut un prelat pieux et respecte, place a la tete de  l'episcopat des Gaules pour la science de l'Ecriture sainte. On comprend  que celui qui avait regi si longtemps les _Ecoles sublimes_ (tel etait  le nom donne aux cours de haute science) devait faire un grand eveque:  aussi en a-t-il recu le titre[33]. Il administra son diocese pendant  sept annees et mourut regrette de saint Bernard dont il etait l'ami et a  qui, le premier peut-etre, il fit connaitre Abelard[34].    [Note 33: \"Magnum Wuillelmum episcopum, qui sublimes scholas  rexerat.\" (_Ex Chron. mauriniae. Recueil des Histor._, t. XII,  p.76.--Saint Bern. _Op_., t. I, p. 13.)]    [Note 34: La date de l'election de Guillaume de Champeaux, comme  celle de sa mort, est controversee. Les uns veulent qu'il ait ete eveque  en 1112 et soit mort en 1119 (Duchesne, _Ab. Op_.; Not., p. 1147 et  1163.--Gervaise, _Vie d'Ab._, t. I, p. 23); les autres, que la promotion  soit de 1113 et le deces de 1121, le 22 mars. (Mabillon, saint Bern.,  _Op_., t. I, p. 13, 61 et 302.--Durand et Martene, _Thes. nov. anecd._,  t. V, p.877.--_Gallia Christ._, t. IX, p. 878.--D. Brial, _Rec. des  Hist._, t. XIV, p. 279.--_Hist. litt. de la Fr._, t. XII, p. 476, et  t. X, p. 310 et 311.) Des deux cotes on invoque des textes. Les tables  manuscrites de l'eveche de Chalons portaient qu'il avait administre  pendant sept ans.]    On etait en 1113; Abelard, dans la force de l'age et du talent, avait  constitue son enseignement, son autorite, presque sa gloire. Il dominait  l'ecole de Paris; c'etait etre dictateur dans la republique des lettres.    Ses doctrines avaient pris leur caractere definitif. A l'exception de la  theologie, dans laquelle il lui restait encore des progres a faire, il  avait a peu pres ferme le cercle de ses etudes. Ses contemporains ont  vante son savoir et l'ont dit egal a la science humaine, eloge quelque  peu hyperbolique[35]. Nous avons vu qu'il n'etait point verse dans  l'arithmetique, ni probablement dans aucune des sciences du calcul.  Ceux qui veulent qu'il n'ait rien ignore, meme le droit, chose plus que  douteuse, citent en preuve une anecdote qui indiquerait seulement  qu'il ne comprenait pas une loi des empereurs Valentinien, Theodose et  Arcadius sur les limites[36]. Il ne possedait bien d'autre langue que le  latin; le grec, dont l'etude etait d'ailleurs alors difficile et rare,  ne lui etait, je crois, connu que par quelques mots de la langue  philosophique. Il avoue qu'il ne lisait les auteurs grecs que dans la  traduction, et l'on n'a nulle preuve qu'il entendit l'hebreu[37]. Mais  son instruction litteraire etait fort etendue; elle embrassait a peu  pres tous les auteurs de l'antiquite latine connus de son temps, et le  nombre en etait plus grand qu'on ne pense. Le XIIe siecle etait plus  lettre que le XVe ne l'a laisse croire, et il n'est pas sur que l'esprit  humain ait tout gagne a cesser de se developper suivant la direction que  le moyen age lui avait donnee, et a subir cette revolution qu'on appelle  la renaissance.    [Note 35: Il est dit de lui dans une epitaphe: \"Ille sciens quicquid  fuit ulli scibile;\" et a la fin: \"cui soli patui; scibile quicquid  erat.\" C'est aussi de lui qu'on a dit: \"Non homini, sed scientiae dees;  quod nescivit.\" (_Ab. Op_., pref. _in fin_.--Gervaise, t. II, p. 150.)]    [Note 36: C'est la loi _quinque pedum Praescriptione, C. fin.  regund._, l. III, tit. XXXIX. Sur cette loi, qui n'est pas fort claire  en effet, Accurse dit que Pierre Baylard (_Petrus Baylardus_), qui se  vantait de donner un sens raisonnable a tout texte, quoique difficile  qu'il fut, a dit: Je ne sais pas. Or, cela ne signifie point que  Baylardus sut le droit; de plus, on conteste que ce Baylardus soit  Abelard, et l'on dit que ce pourrait etre un Johannes Bajolardes,  professeur de droit dont parle Crinitus. Enfin il n'est rien moins  qu'etabli que le _Codex repetitae proelectionis_, d'ou cette loi est  extraite, et meme les textes du droit romain en general fussent connus  en France avant la mort d'Abelard. On dit que l'enseignement du droit  commenca a Bologne vers 1180, et a Paris vingt ans apres. La question me  parait bien discutee dans Bayle. (Cf. _Ab. Op._, pref. apolog.--Accurs.  _v deg. Praescript._--Alciat. _Lib. de quinq. ped. Praescr._--Crinitus, _De  Honest. Discip._. l. XXV, c. IV.--Pasquier, _Recherches de la Fr._, l.  VI, c. xvii, et l. IX, c. xxviii.--Bayle, art. _Abelard._--Duboulai,  _Hist. Univ._, t. II, p. 577-680.)]    [Note 37: Ouvr. ined., Introd. xliii, xliv, et _Dialec._, p. 200 et  206. Je parle de l'hebreu, parce qu'on avait alors la pretention de le  savoir. Tous les historiens et meme Abelard disent qu'Heloise le savait,  et d'Amboise a montre que les juifs, qui en general ont conserve la  connaissance de leur langue, participaient au mouvement des etudes a  Paris. (_Ab. Op._, pref. _in fin._) Abelard ne me semble savoir de cette  langue que les mots cites par les interpretes des bibles latines (Voyez  son _Hexameron_, passim, et du present ouvrage, le liv. III, c. viii.)]    Toutefois la veritable science d'Abelard etait la philosophie. C'est lui  qui a fixe la forme, sinon le fond de la scolastique. Rien, s'il faut en  croire ses auditeurs, ne peut donner idee de l'effet qu'il produisait en  l'enseignant, et jamais aucune science ne parait avoir eu de propagateur  plus puissant. Comme chef d'ecole, il rappelle, s'il n'efface, pour  l'eclat et l'ascendant, les succes des grands philosophes de la Grece.  Cependant cet enseignement etait plus original par le talent que par  les idees, et supposait plus de sagacite critique que d'invention.  Non content d'expliquer avec une facilite et une subtilite que ses  contemporains declaraient sans egales, les secrets de la logique  peripateticienne et de promener les esprits attaches au fil du sien  dans les detours de ce labyrinthe dont il trouvait toujours l'issue, il  melait, autant qu'il etait en lui, a l'interpretation de la brievete  profonde de ce qu'il connaissait du texte l'analyse intelligente et  libre des commentaires et des additions de Boece et de Porphyre;  il completait ses exposes par des citations, bien comprises et  lumineusement developpees, de Ciceron qui, lui aussi, a traite, dans ses  Topiques et dans quelques passages de la Rhetorique a Herennius, des  parties de la logique; de Themiste, qui a laisse des paraphrases  d'Aristote; de Priscien, qui a touche a la logique par la grammaire;  enfin de saint Augustin, qui passait pour l'auteur d'un traite alors  etudie sur les categories, et qui a du peut-etre a son role dans la  scolastique quelque chose de son influence dominante sur la theologie  francaise. Le caractere eminent de l'enseignement d'Abelard etait,  suivant un de ses auditeurs, une clarte elementaire. On trouvait qu'il  fuyait l'appareil pedantesque, et qu'il mettait la science a la portee  des enfants[38].    [Note 38: Johan. Saresb. _Metal._, l. III, c. i.--Il serait  interessant de fixer la liste des ouvrages anciens que les philosophes  avaient dans les mains aux differents ages de la scolastique. Jourdain a  bien avance ce travail pour les ecrits d'Aristote. Themiste, qui est du  IVe siecle, avait laisse des commentaires sur Aristote, dont il reste  quelques-uns, comme ceux sur les Derniers Analytiques, la Physique, le  Traite de l'Ame; Priscien, du VIe siecle, a ecrit sur toutes les parties  de la Grammaire. La Rhetorique a Herennius a fourni plusieurs passages  aux livres d'Abelard, et avant comme apres lui on a longtemps attribue a  saint Augustin deux traite sur les principes de la dialectique, et sur  les dix categories. Abelard avait certainement sous les yeux la  version des deux premiers traites qui composent l'Organon, celle  de l'Introduction de Porphyre et quatre ouvrages de Boece. Quant a  Priscien, Themiste, etc., on ne sait s'il les connait autrement que par  des citations. (Cf. ci-apres, l. II, c. i et iii.--_Recherches sur les  traductions d'Aristote_, par A. Jourdain.--Ouvr. ined. d'Ab., Introd.  p. xlix et 1; _Dialect._, p. 229.--Saint Augustin, _Op._, t. I,  append.--Tennemann, _Man. de l'Hist. de la Phil._, t. I, sec. 233.)]    A cet enseignement purement philosophique et qui n'etait ni sans  austerite ni sans secheresse, se melaient quelques digressions  litteraires, et meme, au dire de ses contemporains, il ne s'interdisait  pas les plaisanteries et le badinage[39]. Autant que le lui permettait  la rigueur de son esprit passionnement raisonneur, il temperait les  apretes de la logique par quelques souvenirs des poetes qu'il aimait.  Virgile et Horace, Ovide et Lucian, toujours presents a sa memoire, lui  fournissaient des citations ou des allusions souvent heureuses; eux  aussi, il les invoquait comme une autorite; de ce qu'ils avaient chante,  il dit quelquefois: _Il est ecrit. (_Scribitur, scriptum est._)    [Note 39: \"Plurimum in inventionum subtilitate, non solum ad"]]]
