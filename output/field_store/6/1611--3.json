There was formerly an estate in the family of her  father, but being a Dissenter, and a zealous parliamentarian, he was  so very much persecuted at the restoration, that he was laid under a  necessity to fly into Ireland, and his estate was confiscated; nor was  the family of our authoress's mother free from the severity of those  times, they being likewise parliamentarians. Her education was in the  country, and her father dying when she was but three years of age,  and her mother not living 'till she was twelve, the improvements our  poetess made were merely by her own industry and application. She was  married before the age of fifteen, to a nephew of Sir Stephen Fox.  This gentleman living with her but a year, she afterwards married Mr.  Carrol, an officer in the army, and survived him likewise in the space  of a year and a half. She afterwards married Mr. Joseph Centlivre,  yeoman of the mouth to his late Majesty. She gave early discoveries of  a genius for poetry, and Mr. Jacob in his Lives of the Poets tells us,  that she composed a song before she was seven years old. She is  the author of fifteen plays; her talent is comedy, particularly the  contrivance of the plots, and incidents. Sir Richard Steele, in one of  his Tatlers, speaking of the Busy Body, thus recommends it. 'The plot,  and incidents of the play, are laid with that subtilty, and spirit,  which is peculiar to females of wit, and is very seldom well performed  by those of the other sex, in whom craft in love is an act of  invention, and not as with women, the effect of nature, and instinct'.    She died December 1, 1723; the author of the Political State thus  characterizes her. 'Mrs. Centlivre, from a mean parentage and  education, after several gay adventures (over which we shall draw  a veil) she had, at last, so well improved her natural genius by  reading, and good conversation, as to attempt to write for the stage,  in which sh had as good success as any of her sex before her. Her  first dramatic performance was a Tragi-Comedy, called The Perjured  Husband, but the plays which gained her most reputation were, two  Comedies, the Gamester, and the Busy Body. She wrote also several  copies of verses on divers subjects, and occasions, and many ingenious  letters, entitled Letters of Wit, Politics, and Morality, which I  collected, and published about 21 years ago[A].'    Her dramatic works are,    1. The Perjured Husband, a Comedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal 1702,  dedicated to the late Duke of Bedford. Scene Venice.    2. The Beau's Duel, or a Soldier for the Ladies, a Comedy; acted at  the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, 1703; a Criticism was written  upon this play in the Post-Angel for August. 3. The Stolen Heiress, or  The Salamancha Doctor Out-plotted; a Comedy; acted at the Theatre in  Lincolns-Inn-Fields 1704. The scene Palermo.    4. The Gamester, a Comedy; acted at the Theatre in Lincolns-Inn-Fields  1704, dedicated to George Earl of Huntingdon. This play is an improved  translation of one of the same title in French. The prologue was  written by Mr. Rowe.    5. The Basset Table, a Comedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal in  Drury-Lane, dedicated to Arthur Lord Altham, 4to. 1706.    6. Love's Contrivance, or Le Medicin Malgre lui; a Comedy; acted  at Drury-Lane 1705, dedicated to the Earl of Dorset. This is a  translation from Moliere.    7. Love at a Venture, a Comedy; acted at Bath, 4to. 1706, dedicated to  the Duke of Beaufort.    8. The Busy Body, acted at the Theatre-Royal 1708, dedicated to Lord  Somers. This play was acted with very great applause.    9. Marplot, or the Second Part of the Busy Body; acted at the  Theatre-Royal 1709, dedicated to the Earl of Portland.    10. The Perplex'd Lovers, a Comedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal 1710,  dedicated to Sir Henry Furnace.    11. The Platonic Lady, a Comedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal 1711. 12.  The Man's Bewitch'd, or The Devil to do about Her; a Comedy; acted  at the Theatre in the Haymarket 1712, dedicated to the Duke of  Devonshire.    13. The Wonder, a Woman keeps a Secret, a Comedy; acted at the  Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane. This play was acted with success.    14. The Cruel Gift, or The Royal Resentment; a Tragedy; acted at the  Theatre-Royal 1716, for the story of this play consult Sigismonda and  Guiscarda, a Novel of Boccace.    15. A Bold Stroke for a Wife, a Comedy; acted at the Theatre in  Lincoln's-Inn-Fields 1717, dedicated to the Duke of Wharton. Besides  these plays Mrs. Centlivre has written three Farces; Bickerstaff's  Burying, or Work for the Upholders. The Gotham Election. A Wife well  Managed.      [Footnote A: See Bayer's Political State, vol. xxvi. p.670.]           *       *       *       *       *          Dr. NICHOLAS BRADY,      This revd. gentleman was son of Nicholas Brady, an officer in the  King's army, in the rebellion 1641, being lineally descended from Hugh  Brady, the first Protestant bishop of Mieath[A]. He was born at Bandon  in the county of Cork, on the 28th of October 1659, and educated  in that county till he was 12 years of age, when he was removed  to Westminster school, and from thence elected student of Christ's  Church, Oxford. After continuing there about four years, he went to  Dublin, where his father resided, at which university he immediately  commenced bachelor of arts. When he was of due standing, his Diploma  for the degree of doctor of divinity was, on account of his uncommon  merit, presented to him from that university, while he was in  England, and brought over by Dr. Pratt, then senior travelling-fellow,  afterwards provost of that college. His first ecclesiastical  preferment was to a prebend, in the Cathedral of St. Barry's in the  city of Cork, to which he was collared by bishop Wettenhal, to whom  he was domestic chaplain. He was a zealous promoter of the revolution,  and suffered for it in consequence of his zeal. In 1690, when the  troubles broke out in Ireland, by his interest with King James's  general, Mac Carty, he thrice prevented the burning of Bandon town,  after three several orders given by that Prince to destroy it. The  same year, having been deputed by the people of Bandon, he went  over to England to petition the Parliament, for a redress of some  grievances they had suffered, while King James was in Ireland. During  his stay here, and to the time of his death, he was in the highest  esteem among all ranks of persons in this kingdom, for his eminent  attachment to the true interest of his country. Having quitted  his preferments in Ireland, he settled in London, where he, being  celebrated for his abilities in the pulpit, was elected minister of  St. Catherine-Cree Church, and lecturer of St. Michael's Woodstreet.  He afterwards became minister of Richmond in Surry, and Stratford upon  Avon in Warwickshire, and at length, rector of Clapham in the county  above-mentioned; which last, together with Richmond, he held to the  time of his death. He was also chaplain to the duke of Ormond's troop  of Horse-guards, as he was to their Majesties King William, and Queen  Anne. He died on the 20th of May 1726, in the 67th year of his age,  leaving behind him the reputation of a good man; he was of a most  obliging, sweet, affable temper, a polite gentleman, an excellent  preacher, and no inconsiderable poet.    His compositions in poetry are chiefly these,    1. A New Version of the Psalms of David, performed by him, in  conjunction with Mr. Tate, soon after he settled in London; now sung  in most churches of England, and Ireland, instead of that obsolete  and ridiculous Version made by Sternhold, and Hopkins, in the reign of  King Edward VI. As the 104th Psalm is esteemed one of the most sublime  in the whole book, we shall present the reader with the two first  Parts of his Version of that Psalm as a specimen. There have not been  less than forty different Versions, and Paraphrases of this Psalm, by  poets of very considerable eminence, who seem to have vied with one  another for the superiority. Of all these attempts, if we may trust  our own judgment, none have succeeded so happily as Mr. Blackclock, a  young gentleman now resident at Dumfries in Scotland. This Paraphrase  is the more extraordinary, as the author of it has been blind from  his cradle, and now labours under that calamity; it carries in it such  elevated strains of poetry, such picturesque descriptions, and such a  mellifluent flow of numbers, that we are persuaded, the reader cannot  be displeased at finding it inserted here.    Dr. Brady also translated the AEneid of Virgil, which were published  by subscription in four volumes octavo, the last of which came out in  1726, a little before the author's death.

With them, too, were arrayed the merchants and artisans, the bankers,  the business-men, the property-owners, all of whom wanted to see the  republic at least established upon a more moderate and quiet foundation,  in order to have confidence in its durability and substantial character,  and to commence the works of peace with a better assurance of success.  And at the head of these moderate republicans stood Bonaparte.    The 18th Brumaire of the year 1798 was the decisive day. It was a  fearful struggle that then began afresh--a struggle, however, in which  little blood was spilt, and not men but principles were slaughtered.    The Council of Elders, the Council of the Five Hundred, the Directory,  and the Constitution of the year III., fell together, and from the ruins  of the bloody and ferocious democratic republic arose the moderate,  rational republic of the year 1798. At its head were the three consuls,  Bonaparte, Cambaceres, and Lebrun.    On the day following, the 18th Brumaire, these three consuls entered the  Luxembourg, amid the plaudits of the people, and slept, as conquerors,  in the beds of the Directory of yesterday.    From that day forward a new world began to take shape, and the forms of  etiquette which, during the ascendency of the democratic republic, had  slunk away out of sight into the darkest recesses of the Luxembourg and  the Tuileries, began to reappear, slowly and circumspectly, 'tis true,  in broad daylight. People were no longer required, in accordance with  the spirit of equality, to ignore all distinctions of condition and  culture, by the use of the words \"citizen\" and \"citizeness;\" or, in the  name of brotherhood, to endure the close familiarities of every brawling  street ruffian; or, in the name of liberty, to let all his own personal  liberty and inclination be trampled under foot.    Etiquette, as I have said, crept forth from the dark corners again; and  the three consuls, who had taken possession of the Luxembourg, whispered  the word \"monsieur\" in each other's ears, and greeted Josephine and her  daughter, who were installed in the apartments prepared for them in the  palace on the next day, with the title of \"madame.\" Yet, only a year  earlier, the two words \"monsieur\" and \"madame\" had occasioned revolt in  Paris, and brought about bloodshed. A year earlier General Augereau had  promulged the stern order of the day in his division, that, \"whoever  should use the word 'monsieur' or 'madame,' orally or in writing, on  pretext whatever, should be deprived of his rank, and declared incapable  of ever again serving in the army of the republic[7].\"    [Footnote 7: Bourrienne, vol. i., p. 229.]    Now, these two proscribed words made their triumphant entry, along with  the three consuls, into the palace of the Luxembourg, which had been  delivered from its democratic tyrants.    Josephine was now, at least, \"Madame\" Bonaparte, and Hortense was  \"Mademoiselle\" Beauharnais. The wife of Consul Bonaparte now required a  larger retinue of servants, and a more showy establishment. Indeed,  temerity could not yet go so far as to speak of the _court_ of Madame  Bonaparte and the _court ladies_ of Mademoiselle Hortense; they had  still to be content with the limited space of the diminutive Luxembourg,  but they were soon to be compensated for all this, and, if they still  had to call each other _monsieur_ and _madame_, they could, a few years  later, say \"your highness,\" \"your majesty,\" and \"monseigneur,\" in the  Tuileries.    The Luxembourg Palace was soon found to be too small for the joint  residence of the three consuls, and too confined for the ambition of  Bonaparte, who could not brook the near approach of the other two men  who shared the supreme control of France with him. Too it was also for  the longings that now spoke with ever louder and stronger accents in  his breast, and pushed him farther and farther onward in this path of  splendor and renown which, at first, had seemed to him but as the magic  mirage of his dreams, but which now appeared as the glittering truth and  reality of his waking hours. The Luxembourg was then too small for the  three consuls, but they had to go very circumspectly and carefully to  work to prepare the way to the old royal palace of the Bourbons. It  would not do to oust the representatives of the people, who held their  sessions there, too suddenly; the distrustful republicans must not be  made to apprehend that there was any scheme on foot to revolutionize  France back into monarchy, and to again stifle the many-headed monster  of the republic under a crown and a sceptre. It was necessary, before  entering the Tuileries, to give the French people proof that men might  still be very good republicans, even although they might wish to be  housed in the bedchamber of a king.    Hence, before the three consuls transferred their quarters to the  Tuileries, the royal palace had to be transformed to a residence worthy  of the representatives of the republic. So, the first move made was to  set up a handsome bust of the elder Brutus--a war-trophy of Bonaparte's,  which he had brought with him from Italy--in one of the galleries of the  Tuileries; and then David had to carve out some other statues of the  republican heroes of Greece and Rome and place them in the saloons. A  number of democratic republicans, who were defeated and exiled on the  13th Vendemiaire, were permitted to return to France, and news of the  death of WASHINGTON, the noblest and wisest of all republicans, arriving  just at that time, Bonaparte ordered that the whole army should wear the  badge of mourning for ten days. Black bands were worn on the arm, and  sable streamers waved from the standards, in honor of the deceased  republican hero.    However, when these ten days were past, and France and her army had  sufficiently expressed their regret, the three consuls entered the  Tuileries through the grand portal, on the two sides of which towered  aloft two liberty-poles that still bore the old inscription of the  republic of 1792. On the tree to the right was the legend \"August 10,  1792,\" and on the one to the left, \"Royalty in France is overthrown and  will never rise again.\" It was between these two significant symbols  that Bonaparte first strode into the Tuileries. It was a very long and  imposing procession of carriages which moved that day toward the palace,  through the streets of the capital. They only lacked the outward pomp  and magnificence which rendered the latter _fetes_ of the empire so  remarkable. With the exception of the splendid vehicle in which the  three consuls rode, and which was drawn by the six grays presented by  the Emperor of Austria, there were but few good equipages to be seen.  France of the new day had not had the opportunity to build any  state-coaches, and those of old France had been too shamefully misused  to admit of their ever serving again; for it would be out of the  question to employ, in this solemn procession of the three consuls, the  state-carriages of the old aristocracy, that had served as the vehicles  in which the democratic republic had transported dead dogs to their  place of deposit. Such had been the fact in the September days of the  year 1793.    The unclaimed dogs of the fugitive or slaughtered aristocracy at that  time wandered without masters, by thousands, through the streets and  slaked their thirst with the blood which flowed down from the guillotine  and dyed the ground with the purple of the new system of  popular liberty.    The smell of the fresh blood and the ghastly sustenance which the  guillotine yielded them had restored the animals to their original  savage propensities, and hence those who had been so fortunate as to  escape the murderous axe of the _sans-culottes_ had now to apprehend the  danger of falling a victim to the sharp teeth of these wild  blood-hounds; and as the ferocious brutes knew no difference between  aristocrats and republicans, but fell upon both with equal fury, it  became necessary, at last, to annihilate these new foes of the republic.  So, the Champs Elysees were surrounded with troops, and the dogs were  driven into the Rue Royale and the Place Royale, where they were mowed  down by musketry. On that one day the dead carcasses of more than three  thousand dogs lay about in the streets of Paris, and there they  continued to fester for three days longer, because a dispute had arisen  among the city officials as to whose duty it was to remove them. At  length the Convention undertook that task, and intrusted the work to  representative Gasparin, who was shrewd enough to convert the removal of  the dead animals into a republican ceremony. These were the dogs of the  _ci-devants_ and aristocrats that were to be buried, and it was quite  proper, therefore, that they should receive aristocratic honors.    Gasparin, acting upon this idea, caused all the coaches of the fugitive  and massacred aristocracy to be brought from their stables, and the  carcasses of the dogs were flung into these emblazoned and escutcheoned  vehicles of old France. Six grand coaches that had belonged to the king  opened the procession, and the tails, heads, bodies and legs of the  luckless quadrupeds could be seen behind the glittering glass panels  heaped together in wild disorder[8].    [Footnote 8: Memoires of the Marchioness de Crequi, vol. viii, p. 10.]    After this public canine funeral celebration of the one and indivisible  republic, the gilded state-coaches could not be consistently used for  any human and less mournful occasion, and hence it was that the consular  procession to the Tuileries was so deficient in carriages, and that  public hacks on which the numbers were defaced had to be employed.    With the entry of Bonaparte into the Tuileries the revolution was at an  end. He laid his"]]]
