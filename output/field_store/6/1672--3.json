When he takes off his gold anklet, and lays it on  the stone, do thou bring it in thy beak to the hollow of the tree, and  drop it in there.\" Shortly after the Prince came, as was his wont, and  taking off his dress and ornaments, the Hen-Crow did as had been  determined; and while the servants of the Prince were searching in the  hollow, there they found the Black Snake, which they at once dispatched.    'Said I not well,' continued Damanaka, 'that stratagem excels force?'    'It was well said,' replied Karataka; 'go! and may thy path be  prosperous!    'With that Damanaka repaired to the King, and having done homage, thus  addressed him:--    \"Your Majesty, there is a dreadful thing on my mind, and I am come to  disclose it.\"    'Speak!' said the King, with much graciousness.    'Your Majesty,' said the Jackal, 'this Bull has been detected of  treason. To my face he has spoken contemptuously of the three  prerogatives of the throne,[14] unto which he aspires.'    \"At these words King Tawny-hide stood aghast.    'Your Majesty,' continued Damanaka, 'has placed him above us all in the  Court. Sire! he must be displaced!--        'Teeth grown loose, and wicked-hearted ministers, and poison-trees,      Pluck them by the roots together; 'Tis the thing that giveth ease,'    'Good Jackal,' said the King, after some silence; 'this is indeed  dreadful; but my regard for the Bull is very great, and it is said--        'Long-tried friends are friends to cleave to--never leave thou these              i' the lurch:--      What man shuns the fire as sinful for that once it burned a church?'    'That is written of discarding old servants, may it please your  Majesty,' observed Damanaka; 'and this Bull is quite a stranger,'    'Wondrous strange!' replied the Lion; 'when I have advanced and  protected him that he should plot against me!'    'Your Majesty,' said the Jackal, 'knows what has been written--        'Raise an evil soul to honor, and his evil bents remain;      Bind a cur's tail ne'er so straightly, yet it curleth up again.'        'How, in sooth, should Trust and Honor change the evil nature's root?      Though one watered them with nectar, poison-trees bear deadly fruit.'    I have now at least warned your Majesty: if evil comes, the fault is not  mine,'    'It will not do to condemn the Bull without inquiry,' mused the King;  then he said aloud, 'shall we admonish him, think you, Damanaka?'    'No, no, Sire!' exclaimed the Jackal, eagerly; 'that would spoil all our  precautions--        'Safe within the husk of silence guard the seed of counsel so      That it break not--being broken, then the seedling will not grow,'    What is to be done must be done with despatch. After censuring his  treason, would your Majesty still trust the traitor?--        'Whoso unto ancient fondness takes again a faithless friend,      Like she-mules that die conceiving, in his folly finds his end,'    'But wherein can the Bull injure me?' asked Tawny-hide; 'tell me that!'    'Sire,' replied the Jackal, how can I tell it?--        'Ask who his friends are, ere you scorn your foe;      The Wagtail foiled the sea, that did not so,'    'How could that be?' demanded King Tawny-hide.    'The Jackal related:--      THE STORY OF THE WAGTAIL AND THE SEA    \"On the shore of the Southern Sea there dwelt a pair of Wagtails. The  Hen-bird was about to lay, and thus addressed her mate:--    'Husband, we must look about for a fit place to lay my eggs.'    'My dear,' replied the Cock-bird, 'will not this spot do?'    'This spot!' exclaimed the Hen; 'why, the tide overflows it.'    'Good dame,' said the Cock, 'am I so pitiful a fellow that the Sea will  venture to wash the eggs out of my nest?'    'You are my very good Lord,' replied the Hen, with a laugh; 'but still  there is a great difference between you and the Sea.'    \"Afterwards, however, at the desire of her mate, she consented to lay  her eggs on the sea-beach. Now the Ocean had overheard all this, and,  bent upon displaying its strength, it rose and washed away the nest and  eggs. Overwhelmed with grief, the Hen-bird flew to her mate, and  cried:--    'Husband, the terrible disaster has occurred! My eggs arc gone!'    'Be of good heart! my Life,' answered he.    \"And therewith he called a meeting of fowls, and went with them into the  presence of Gurud, the Lord of the birds. When the Master of the Mighty  Wing had listened to their complaint, he conveyed it to the knowledge of  the God Narayen, who keeps, and kills, and makes alive the world. The  almighty mandate given, Gurud bound it upon his forehead, and bore it to  the Ocean, which, so soon as it heard the will of Narayen, at once gave  back the eggs.    'How, indeed,' concluded Damanaka, 'should I judge of the Bull's power,  not knowing who supports him?'    'By what signs, then,' asked the King, 'may I conclude him a traitor?'    'If he comes into the presence with his horns lowered for goring, as one  that expects the fight. That,' replied the Jackal, 'will convince your  Majesty,'    'Thereupon Damanaka the Jackal withdrew, and betook himself towards the  Bull, upon perceiving whom he approached slowly, with all the air of one  greatly distressed.    'Good master Jackal,' said Lusty-life, 'what goes amiss with thee?'    'All goes amiss with such as serve wicked masters,' replied the Jackal.    'But what ails thee?' asked the Bull.    'Alas!' answered the Jackal, 'what can I say in such a strait!--        'Even as one who grasps a serpent, drowning in the bitter sea,      Death to hold and death to loosen--such is life's perplexity.'    'And therewithal the Jackal heaved a deep sigh, and squatted down.    'But, good friend,' said the Bull, 'at least tell me what is in thy  mind.'    'Bull,' began Damanaka, 'it is a King's secret, and should not be  spoken; but thou didst come here upon my safeguard, and as I hope for  the life to come, I will tell thee of what touches thee so nearly.  Listen!--the heart of the King is turned against thee! he hath sworn  secretly that he will kill thee and feast upon thy flesh.'    'Then Lusty-life the Bull was sorely troubled, and he fell a-musing  thus--        \"Woman's love rewards the worthless--kings of knaves exalters be;      Wealth attends the selfish niggard, and the cloud rains on the sea.\"    'Can this be the Jackal's doing?' he reflected. Going with honest folk  will not make one honest--        'Many a knave wins fair opinions standing in fair company,      As the sooty soorma pleases, lighted by a brilliant eye.'    Then he said aloud, 'wherein can I have angered the King? Do kings hate  without cause? I can tell nothing, except that there is no happiness  which abides long--        'Where the azure lotus[15] blossoms, there the alligators hide;      In the sandal-tree are serpents. Pain and pleasure live allied.'    I thought his Majesty noble as the sandal-tree; but that, indeed, is not  wholly noble--        'Rich the sandal--yet no part is but a vile thing habits there;      Snake and wasp haunt root and blossom; on the boughs sit ape and bear.'    'Bull,' said Damanaka, 'I knew the King of old for one whose tongue was  honey and whose heart was poison.'    'But how very hard!' said the Bull, 'that he, being a lion, should  attack me, an innocent eater of grass!'    'It is very hard!' said the Jackal.    'Who can have set him against me?' asked the Bull.    'Being so, it cannot be bettered,' replied the Jackal, 'whoever did it--        'As a bracelet of crystal, once broke, is not mended;      So the favor of princes, once altered, is ended.'    'Yes,' said the Bull, 'and a king incensed is terrible--        'Wrath of kings, and rage of lightning--both be very full of dread;      But one falls on one man only--one strikes many victims dead,'    Still, I can but die--and I will die fighting! When death is certain,  and no hope left but in battle, that is the time for war,'    'It is so,' said the Jackal.    'Having weighed all this, Lusty-life inquired of the Jackal by what  signs he might conclude the King's hostile intentions.    'If he glowers upon thee,' answered Damanaka, 'and awaits thee with ears  pricked, tail stiffened, paw upraised, and muzzle agape, then thou  mayest get thee to thy weapons like a Bull of spirit, for        'All men scorn the soulless coward who his manhood doth forget:--      On a lifeless heap of ashes fearlessly the foot is set,'    'Then Damanaka the Jackal returned to the Lion, and said to him:--    'If it please your Majesty, the traitor is now coming; let your Majesty  be on your guard, with ears pricked and paw upraised.'    'The Bull meanwhile approached, and observing the hostile attitude of  King Tawny-hide, he also lowered his horns, and prepared for the combat.  A terrible battle ensued, and at the last King Tawny-hide slew  Lusty-life the Bull. Now when the Bull was dead, the Lion was very  sorrowful, and as he sat on his throne lamenting, he said--    'I repent me of this deed!--        'As when an Elephant's life-blood is spilt,      Another hath the spoils--mine is the guilt.'    'Sire,' replied the Jackal, 'a King over-merciful is like a Brahman  that eats all things equally. May all your Majesty's enemies perish as  did this Bull.'    \"Thus endeth,\" said the Sage Vishnu-Sarman, \"the 'Parting of Friends.'\"    \"We are gratified exceedingly thereby,\" replied the Sons of the King.    \"Let me then close it thus,\" said their Preceptor--          'So be friendship never parted,        But among the evil-hearted;        Time's sure step drag, soon or later,        To his judgment, such a Traitor;        Lady Lukshmi, of her grace,        Grant good fortune to this place;      And you, Royal boys! and boys of times to be      In this fair fable-garden wander free.'

I have therefore declared in due form to the Honorable Magistracy that I am  myself willing to undertake the expenses of his present school, and also to  provide the various masters required. Being rather deaf, which is an  impediment to conversation, I have requested the aid of a colleague, and  suggested for this purpose Herr Peters, Councillor of Prince Lobkowitz, in  order that a person may forthwith be appointed to superintend the education  and progress of my nephew, that his moral character may one day command  esteem, and whose acquirements may be a sure guaranty to all those who feel  an interest in the youth's welfare, that he will undoubtedly receive the  education and culture necessary to develop his abilities.    My efforts and wishes have no other aim than to give the boy the best  possible education,--his abilities justifying the brightest hopes,--and to  fulfil the trust placed in my brotherly love by his father. The shoot is  still flexible; but if longer neglected it will become crooked, and outgrow  the gardener's training hand, and upright bearing, intellect, and  character, be destroyed forever.    I know no duty more sacred than the education and training of a child. The  chief duties of a guardian consist in knowing how to appreciate what is  good, and in adopting a right course; then alone has proper attention been  devoted to the welfare of his ward, whereas in opposing what is good he  neglects his duty.    Indeed, keeping in view what is most for the benefit of the boy, I do not  object to the mother in so far sharing in the duties of a guardian that she  may visit her son, and see him, and be apprised of all the measures adopted  for his education; but to intrust her with the sole guardianship of the boy  without a strict guardian by her side, would cause the irrevocable ruin of  her son.    On these cogent grounds I reiterate my well-founded solicitation, and feel  the more confident of a favorable answer, as the welfare of my nephew alone  guides my steps in this affair.[2]    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Schindler states that during these law proceedings the widow  of Beethoven's brother had another child.]    [Footnote 2: The Court excluded Carl's mother from all share in his  education, and from all direct influence over her son, and again restored  to Beethoven the full authority of a guardian.]      288.

V. BEETHOVEN.    Jan. 12, 1820.      289.    TESTIMONIAL IN FAVOR OF HERR V. KANDELER.    It is certainly the duty of every musical composer to become acquainted  with all the earlier as well as more modern poets, in order to select what  is most suitable to his purpose for songs. Such, however, not being  invariably the case, this present collection of Herr v. Kandeler's cannot  fail to be useful and commendable to many who wish to write songs, and also  tend to induce more able poets to contribute something in the same  direction.    LUDWIG V. BEETHOVEN.--M.P.    I entirely agree with Herr v. Beethoven.    JOS. WEIGEL.      290.    TO THEODORE AMADEUS HOFFMANN.[1]    Vienna, March 23, 1820.    I seize the opportunity through Herr N. of approaching a man so gifted as  yourself. You have also written of my humble self, and Herr N.N. showed me  some lines of yours about me in his album; I have, therefore, every reason  to believe that you feel some interest in me. Permit me to say that, on the  part of so talented a man as yourself, this is truly gratifying to me. I  wish you all possible good and happiness, and remain,    Sir, with esteem, your obedient    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: It is well known that Hoffmann, in the years 1809 to 1812,  wrote the first really important articles on Beethoven's works for the  _Leipzig A.M. Zeitung_ on his instrumental music, his trios, and masses,  &c., &c.]      291.    TO HERR HASLINGER,--ADJUTANTERL.    I request the Adjutant to lend me the score of the Overture in E flat,  which I will return as soon as the performance is over. I also beg he will  be so good as to send me Kirnberger's work to supply the place of mine, as  I am at this moment giving lessons in counterpoint, and have been unable to  find my own manuscript amid my confused mass of papers. Yours,    MI CONTRA FA.      292.    TO TOBIAS,--ADJUTANT.    MOST WORTHY ADJUTANT,--    I have made a bet of ten florins, W.W., against the truth of your having  been obliged to pay a compensation of 2000 florins to Artaria for the new  edition of Mozart's works, which have been again and again engraved and  sold everywhere. I really wish to know the truth on this subject, for I  cannot possibly believe what is said. If it be the fact that you have been  so unhandsomely treated, then _Ah, dolce contento_ must pay the ten  florins. Send me a true report. Farewell; be a good Christian. Your    BEETHOVEN.      293.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Vienna, April 3, 1820.    YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,--    So far as I can recollect, when I was about to wait on you, I was told that  Y.R.H. was indisposed; I called on Sunday evening to inquire, having been  assured that Y.R.H. did not intend to set off on Monday. In accordance with  my usual custom, not to remain long in an anteroom, I hurried away after  receiving this information, though I observed that the gentleman in waiting  wished to say something to me. Unhappily I did not hear till Monday  afternoon that Y.R.H. had really gone to Olmuetz. I must confess that this  caused me a very painful feeling, but my consciousness of never having  neglected my duty in any respect, induced me to suppose that the same may  have been the case on this occasion, as it often is in human life,--for I  can easily conceive that Y.R.H., immersed in ceremonies and novel  impressions, had very little time to spare in Olmuetz for other things. I  should otherwise certainly have anticipated Y.R.H. in writing. May I ask  you graciously to inform me what length of stay you intend to make in  Olmuetz? It was reported that Y.R.H. intended to return here towards the end  of May; but a few days ago I heard that you were to remain a year and a  half in Olmuetz; owing to this I may perhaps have adopted wrong measures,  not with regard to Y.R.H., but myself. As soon as I receive information  from you on the subject, I will enter into further explanations. May I also  beg that in the mean time Y.R.H. will not listen to certain reports about  me? I have heard a great deal of what may be termed gossip here, which  people seem to think may be acceptable to Y.R.H. As Y.R.H. is pleased to  say that I am one of those whom you esteem, I can confidently declare that  Y.R.H. is the person whom I value most in the universe. Although no  courtier, I believe that Y.R.H. knows me too thoroughly to believe that  mere selfish interest has ever attached or attracted me towards Y.R.H.,  but, on the contrary, true and heartfelt affection alone. I can with truth  say that a second Blondel has long since set forth on his pilgrimage, and  if no Richard can be found in this world for me, God shall be my Sovereign!    It seems to me that my idea of giving a quartet is the best; even though  some works have been already performed on a grand scale at Olmuetz, still  something might thus be introduced into Moravia to attract the attention of  the musical world, and for the benefit of Art.    If, according to the above reports, Y.R.H. should return here in May, I  advise Y.R.H. to reserve your _spiritual children_ for me [see No. 279]  till then, because it would be better that I should hear them performed by  yourself. But if your stay in Olmuetz is really to be of such long duration,  I will receive them now with the greatest pleasure, and strive to accompany  Y.R.H. to the summit of Parnassus. May God preserve Y.R.H. in health for  the good of humanity, and also for that of all your warm admirers. I beg  you will be graciously pleased soon to write to me. Y.R.H. cannot fail to  be convinced of my readiness at all times to fulfil your wishes.    I am Y.R.H.'s humble and faithful servant,    LUDWIG V. BEETHOVEN      294.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Moedling, Aug. 3, 1820.    I have this moment received the letter in which Y.R.H. informs me yourself  of your journey hither, and I sincerely thank Y.R.H. for such a mark of  attention. I intended to have hastened to town to-morrow to wait on Y.R.H.,  but no carriage is to be had; I expect however to get one before next  Saturday, when I shall lose no time, and set off at an early hour to  inquire for Y.R.H. With regard to the sacrifice Y.R.H. intends to offer up  to the Muses, I will make a proposal verbally on the subject. I heartily  rejoice in knowing that Y.R.H. is once more so near me. May I in all  respects be enabled to assist in fulfilling your wishes! May Heaven bless  Y.R.H., and mature all your plans!    [K.]      295.    TO HERR ARTARIA, FALSTAFF, & CO.    Vienna, Oct. 26, 1820.    I politely request that you will hand over to Herr Oliva the sum of 300  florins, which has no doubt already been received by you in full. Having  been entirely occupied by removing to my new lodgings, I could not do  myself the honor of expressing my thanks to you and Sir John Falstaff in  person.    Your obedient servant,    LUDWIG V. BEETHOVEN.      296.    TO BOLDERINI.
