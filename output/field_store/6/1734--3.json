We made  friends with many of them, communicating by laughter and by signs, while  our guide stood unobtrusively in the middle distance waiting for us to  come on. Just at sunset he led us out to a great open space, with a tall  palm in the centre of it and the gathering of a multitude of people. A  mollah was clambering into a high scaffold built of poles, whence  shortly he began to intone a long-drawn-out \"Allah! Allah! il Allah!\"  The cocoanut palms cut the sunset, and the boabab trees--the fat, lazy  boababs--looked more monstrous than ever. We called our guide and  conferred on him the munificent sum of sixteen and a half cents; with  which, apparently much pleased, he departed. Then slowly we wandered  back to the hotel.          PART II.    THE SHIMBA HILLS.              IX.    A TROPICAL JUNGLE.      Many months later, and after adventures elsewhere described,[3] besides  others not relevant for the moment, F., an Englishman, and I returned to  Mombasa. We came from some hundred odd miles in the interior where we  had been exploring the sources and the course of the Tsavo River. Now  our purpose was to penetrate into the low, hot, wooded country along the  coast known as the Shimba Hills in quest of a rare beast called the  sable antelope.    These hills could be approached in one of two ways--by crossing the  harbour, and then marching two days afoot; or by voyaging up to the very  end of one of the long arms of the sea that extend many miles inland.  The latter involved dhows, dependence on uncertain winds, favourable  tides, and a heap of good luck. It was less laborious but most  uncertain. At this stage of the plan the hotel manager came forward with  the offer of a gasoline launch, which we gladly accepted.    We embarked about noon, storing our native carriers and effects aboard a  dhow hired for the occasion. This we purposed towing. A very neatly  uniformed Swahili bearing on his stomach a highly-polished brass label  as big as a door plate--\"Harbour Police\"--threw duck fists over what he  called overloading the boat. He knew very little about boats, but threw  very competent duck fists. As we did know something about boats, we  braved unknown consequences by disregarding him utterly. No consequences  ensued--unless perhaps to his own health. When everything was aboard,  that dhow was pretty well down, but still well afloat. Then we white men  took our places in the launch.    This was a long narrow affair with a four-cylinder thirty-horsepower  engine. As she possessed no speed gears, she had either to plunge ahead  full speed or come to a stop; there were no compromises. Her steering  was managed by a tiller instead of a wheel, so that a mere touch  sufficed to swerve her ten feet from her course. As the dhow was in no  respects built on such nervous lines, she did occasionally some fancy  and splashing curves.    The pilot of the launch turned out to be a sandy-haired Yankee who had  been catching wild animals for Barnum and Bailey's circus. While waiting  for his ship, he, being a proverbial handy Yankee, had taken on this  job. He became quite interested in telling us this, and at times forgot  his duties at the tiller. Then that racing-launch would take a wild  swoop; the clumsy old dhow astern would try vainly, with much spray and  dangerous careening, to follow; the compromise course would all but  upset her; the spray would fly; the safari boys would take their  ducking; the boat boys would yell and dance and lean frantically against  the two long sweeps with which they tried to steer. In this wild and  untrammelled fashion we careered up the bay, too interested in our own  performances to pay much attention to the scenery. The low shores, with  their cocoanut groves gracefully rising above the mangrove tangle,  slipped by, and the distant blue Shimba Hills came nearer.    After a while we turned into a narrower channel with a good many curves  and a quite unknown depth of water. Down this we whooped at the full  speed of our thirty-horsepower engine. Occasional natives, waist deep  and fishing, stared after us open-eyed. The Yankee ventured a guess as  to how hard she would hit on a mudbank. She promptly proved his guess a  rank underestimate by doing so. We fell in a heap on the bottom. The  dhow bore down on us with majestic momentum. The boat boys leaned  frantically on their sweeps, and managed just to avoid us. The dhow also  rammed the mudbank. A dozen reluctant boys hopped overboard and pushed  us off. We pursued our merry way again. On either hand now appeared fish  weirs of plaited coco fibre; which, being planted in the shallows,  helped us materially to guess at the channel. Naked men, up to their  shoulders in the water, attended to some mysterious need of the nets, or  emerged dripping and sparkling from the water with baskets of fish atop  their heads. The channel grew even narrower, and the mudbanks more  frequent. We dodged a dozen in our headlong course. Our local guide, a  Swahili in tarboosh and a beautiful saffron robe, showed signs of strong  excitement. We were to stop, he said, around the next bend; and at this  rate we never could stop. The Yankee remarked, superfluously, that it  would be handy if this dod-blistered engine had a clutch; adding, as an  afterthought, that no matter how long he stayed in the tropics his nose  peeled. We asked what we should do if we over-carried our prospective  landing-place. He replied that the dod-blistered thing did have a  reverse. While thus conversing we shot around a corner into a complete  cul-de-sac! Everything was shut off hastily, and an instant later we and  the dhow smashed up high and dry on a cozy mud beach! We drew a deep  breath and looked around us.    Mangrove thicket to the edge of the slimy ooze; trees behind--that was  all we could see. We gave our attention to the business of getting our  men, our effects, and ourselves ashore. The ooze proved to be just above  knee deep. The porters had a fearful and floundering time, and received  much obvious comment from us perched in the bow of the launch. Finally  everything was debarked. F. and I took off our boots; but our gunbearers  expressed such horror at the mere thought of our plunging into the mud,  that we dutifully climbed them pick-a-back and were carried. The hard  shell beach was a hundred feet away, occupying a little recess where the  persistent tough mangroves drew back. From it led a narrow path through  the thicket. We waved and shouted a farewell to the crews of the launch  and the dhow.    The path for a hundred feet was walled in by the mangroves through which  scuttled and rattled the big land crabs. Then suddenly we found  ourselves in a story-book tropical paradise. The tall coco palms rose  tufted above everything; the fans of the younger palms waved below;  bananas thrust the banners of their broad leaves wherever they could  find space; creepers and vines flung the lush luxuriance of their  greenery over all the earth and into the depths of all the half-guessed  shadows. In no direction could one see unobstructed farther than twenty  feet, except straight up; and there one could see just as far as the  tops of the palms. It was like being in a room--a green, hot, steamy,  lovely room. Very bright-coloured birds that ought really to have been  at home in their cages fluttered about.    We had much vigorous clearing to do to make room for our tents. By the  time the job was finished we were all pretty hot. Several of the boys  made vain attempts to climb for nuts, but without success. We had  brought them with us from the interior, where cocoanuts do not grow; and  they did not understand the method. They could swarm up the tall slim  stems all right, but could not manage to get through the  downward-pointing spikes of the dead leaves. F. tried and failed, to the  great amusement of the men, but to the greater amusement of myself. I  was a wise person, and lay on my back on a canvas cot, so it was not  much bother to look up and enjoy life. Not to earn absolutely the stigma  of laziness, I tried to shoot some nuts down. This did not work either,  for the soft, spongy stems closed around the bullet holes. Then a little  wizened monkey of a Swahili porter, having watched our futile  performances with interest, nonchalantly swarmed up; in some mysterious  manner he wriggled through the defences, and perched in the top, whence  he dropped to us a dozen big green nuts. Our men may not have been much  of a success at climbing for nuts; but they were passed masters at the  art of opening them. Three or four clips from their awkward swordlike  pangas, and we were each presented with a clean, beautiful, natural  goblet brimming full of a refreshing drink.    About this time a fine figure of a man drifted into camp. He was very  smooth-skinned, very dignified, very venerable. He was pure Swahili,  though of the savage branch of that race, and had none of the negro  type of countenance. In fact, so like was he in face, hair, short square  beard and genial dignity to a certain great-uncle of mine that it was  very hard to remember that he had on only a small strip of cloth, that  he was cherishing as a great treasure a piece of soap box he had  salvaged from the shore, and that his skin was red chocolate. I felt  inclined to talk to him as to an intellectual equal, especially as he  had a fine resonant bass voice that in itself lent his remarks some  importance. However, I gave him two ordinary wood screws, showed him how  they screwed in and out, and left him happy.    After supper the moon rose, casting shadows of new and unknown shapes  through this strangely new and unknown forest.

Better success will shortly attend you,  When you learn to analyze all creation  And give it a proper classification.    _Scholar_. I feel as confused by all you've said,  As if 'twere a mill-wheel going round in my head!    _Mephistopheles_. The next thing most important to mention,  Metaphysics will claim your attention!  There see that you can clearly explain  What fits not into the human brain:  For that which will not go into the head,  A pompous word will stand you in stead.  But, this half-year, at least, observe  From regularity never to swerve.  You'll have five lectures every day;  Be in at the stroke of the bell I pray!  And well prepared in every part;  Study each paragraph by heart,  So that you scarce may need to look  To see that he says no more than's in the book;  And when he dictates, be at your post,  As if you wrote for the Holy Ghost!    _Scholar_. That caution is unnecessary!  I know it profits one to write,  For what one has in black and white,  He to his home can safely carry.    _Mephistopheles_. But choose some faculty, I pray!    _Scholar_. I feel a strong dislike to try the legal college.    _Mephistopheles_. I cannot blame you much, I must acknowledge.  I know how this profession stands to-day.  Statutes and laws through all the ages  Like a transmitted malady you trace;  In every generation still it rages  And softly creeps from place to place.  Reason is nonsense, right an impudent suggestion;  Alas for thee, that thou a grandson art!  Of inborn law in which each man has part,  Of that, unfortunately, there's no question.    _Scholar_. My loathing grows beneath your speech.  O happy he whom you shall teach!  To try theology I'm almost minded.    _Mephistopheles_. I must not let you by zeal be blinded.  This is a science through whose field  Nine out of ten in the wrong road will blunder,  And in it so much poison lies concealed,  That mould you this mistake for physic, no great wonder.  Here also it were best, if only one you heard  And swore to that one master's word.  Upon the whole--words only heed you!  These through the temple door will lead you  Safe to the shrine of certainty.    _Scholar_. Yet in the word a thought must surely be.    _Mephistopheles_. All right! But one must not perplex himself about it;  For just where one must go without it,  The word comes in, a friend in need, to thee.  With words can one dispute most featly,  With words build up a system neatly,  In words thy faith may stand unshaken,  From words there can be no iota taken.    _Scholar_. Forgive my keeping you with many questions,  Yet must I trouble you once more,  Will you not give me, on the score  Of medicine, some brief suggestions?  Three years are a short time, O God!  And then the field is quite too broad.  If one had only before his nose  Something else as a hint to follow!--    _Mephistopheles_ [_aside_].

[_Aloud_.]  The healing art is quickly comprehended;  Through great and little world you look abroad,  And let it wag, when all is ended,  As pleases God.  Vain is it that your science sweeps the skies,  Each, after all, learns only what he can;  Who grasps the moment as it flies  He is the real man.  Your person somewhat takes the eye,  Boldness you'll find an easy science,  And if you on yourself rely,  Others on you will place reliance.  In the women's good graces seek first to be seated;  Their oh's and ah's, well known of old,  So thousand-fold,  Are all from a single point to be treated;  Be decently modest and then with ease  You may get the blind side of them when you please.  A title, first, their confidence must waken,  That _your_ art many another art transcends,  Then may you, lucky man, on all those trifles reckon  For which another years of groping spends:  Know how to press the little pulse that dances,  And fearlessly, with sly and fiery glances,  Clasp the dear creatures round the waist  To see how tightly they are laced.    _Scholar_. This promises!  One loves the How and Where to see!    _Mephistopheles_. Gray, worthy friend, is all your theory  And green the golden tree of life.    _Scholar_. I seem,  I swear to you, like one who walks in dream.  Might I another time, without encroaching,  Hear you the deepest things of wisdom broaching?    _Mephistopheles_. So far as I have power, you may.    _Scholar_. I cannot tear myself away,  Till I to you my album have presented.  Grant me one line and I'm contented!    _Mephistopheles_. With pleasure.

I fear the easy life and free  With my long beard will scarce agree.  'Tis vain for me to think of succeeding,  I never could learn what is called good-breeding.  In the presence of others I feel so small;  I never can be at my ease at all.    _Mephistopheles_. Dear friend, vain trouble to yourself you're giving;  Whence once you trust yourself, you know the art of living.    _Faust_. But how are we to start, I pray?  Where are thy servants, coach and horses?    _Mephistopheles_. We spread the mantle, and away  It bears us on our airy courses.  But, on this bold excursion, thou  Must take no great portmanteau now.  A little oxygen, which I will soon make ready,  From earth uplifts us, quick and steady.
