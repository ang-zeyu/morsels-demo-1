Their  argument was that this practice which had been introduced in other  countries must be adopted also in Prussia. It was just one of those  arguments which above all offended Bismarck's Prussian patriotism. Why  should Prussia imitate other countries? Why should it not have its own  Constitution in its own way? Constitution, as he said, was the _mot  d'ordre_ of the day, the word which men used when they were in want of  an argument. \"In Prussia that only is constitutional which arises from  the Prussian Constitution; whatever be constitutional in Belgium, or in  France, in Anhalt Dessau, or there where the morning red of Mecklenburg  freedom shines, here that alone is constitutional which rests on the  Prussian Constitution.\" If he defended the prerogative of the Crown he  defended the Constitution of his country. A constitution is the  collection of rules and laws by which the action of the king is  governed; a state without a constitution is a mere Oriental despotism  where each arbitrary whim of the king is transmuted into action; this  was not what Bismarck desired or defended; there was no danger of this  in Prussia. He did not even oppose changes in the law and practice of  the Constitution; what he did oppose was the particular change which  would transfer the sovereignty to an elected House of Parliament. \"It  has been maintained,\" he once said, \"that a constitutional king cannot  be a king by the Grace of God; on the contrary he is it above all  others.\"    The references to foreign customs were indeed one of the most curious  practices of the time; the matter was once being discussed whether the  Crown had the power to declare a state of siege without the assent of  the Chambers; most speakers attempted to interpret the text of the  Prussian Constitution by precedents derived from the practice in France  and England; we find the Minister of Justice defending his action on the  ground of an event in the French Revolution, and Lothar Bucher, one of  the ablest of the Opposition, complained that not enough attention had  been paid to the procedure adopted in England for repealing the _Habeas  Corpus Act_, entirely ignoring the fact that there was no Habeas Corpus  Act in Prussia. We can easily understand how repulsive this was to a man  who, like Bismarck, wished nothing more than that his countrymen should  copy, not the details of the English Constitution, but the proud  self-reliance which would regard as impertinent an application of  foreign notions.    The chief cause for this peculiarity was the desire of the Liberal party  to attain that degree of independence and personal liberty which was  enjoyed in England or France; the easiest way to do this seemed to be to  copy their institutions. There was, however, another reason: the study  of Roman law in Germany in which they had been educated had accustomed  them to look for absolute principles of jurisprudence which might be  applied to the legislation of all countries; when, therefore, they  turned their minds to questions of politics, they looked for absolute  principles of constitutional government, on which, as on a law of  nature, their own institutions might be built up. To find these they  analysed the English Constitution, for England was the classical land of  representative government; they read its rules as they would the  institutions of a Roman Jurisconsult and used them to cast light on the  dark places of their own law. Bismarck did not share this type of  thought; his mind was rather of the English cast; he believed the old  Prussian Constitution was as much a natural growth as that of England,  and decided dark points by reference to older practice as an Englishman  would search for precedents in the history of his own country.    At that time the absolute excellence of a democratic constitution was a  dogma which few cared to dispute; it appeared to his hearers as a mere  paradox when Bismarck pointed out how little evidence there was that a  great country could prosper under the government of a Parliament elected  by an extended franchise. Strictly speaking, there was no evidence from  experience; France, as he said, was the parent of all these theories,  but the example of France was certainly not seductive. \"I see in the  present circumstances of France nothing to encourage us to put the  _Nessus_ robe of French political teaching over our healthy body.\" (This  was in September, 1849, when the struggle between the Prince President  and the Assembly was already impending.) The Liberals appealed to  Belgium; it had, at least, stood the storm of the last year, but so had  Russia, and, after all, the Belgian Constitution was only eighteen years  old, \"an admirable age for ladies but not for constitutions.\" And then  there was England.      \"England governs itself, although the Lower House has the right    of refusing taxes. The references to England are our misfortune;    give us all that is English which we have not, give us English    fear of God and English reverence before the law, the whole    English Constitution, but above all the complete independence of    English landed property, English wealth and English common-sense,    especially an English Lower House, in short everything which we    have not got, then I will say, you can govern us after the    English fashion.\"    But this was not all. How could they appeal to England as a proof that a  democratic Parliament was desirable? England had not grown great under a  democratic but under an aristocratic constitution.      \"English reform is younger than the Belgian Constitution; we have    still to wait and see whether this reformed Constitution will    maintain itself for centuries as did the earlier rule of the    English aristocracy.\"    That, in Bismarck's opinion, it was not likely to do so, we see a few  years later; with most Continental critics of English institutions, he  believed that the Reform Bill had destroyed the backbone of the English  Constitution. In 1857 he wrote:      \"They have lost the 'inherited wisdom' since the Reform Bill;    they maintain a coarse and violent selfishness and the ignorance    of Continental relations.\"    It was not merely aristocratic prejudice; it was a wise caution to bid  his countrymen pause before they adopted from foreign theorists a form  of government so new and untried, and risked for the sake of an  experiment the whole future of Prussia.    In later years Bismarck apologised for many of the speeches which he  made at this period: \"I was a terrible Junker in those days,\" he said;  and biographers generally speak of them as though they required  justification or apology. There seems no reason for this. It would have  been impossible for him, had he at that time been entrusted with the  government of the State, entirely to put into practice what he had said  from his place in the Chamber. But he was not minister; he was only a  party leader; his speeches were, as they were intended to be, party  speeches; they had something of the exaggeration which conflict always  produces. They were, moreover, opposition speeches, for he was  addressing not so much the Government as the Chamber and the country,  and in them the party to which he belonged was a very small minority.  But why was there not to be a Conservative party in Prussia?    It was necessary for the proper development of constitutional life that  the dominant Liberal doctrines should be opposed by this bold criticism.  Bismarck was only doing what in England was done by the young Disraeli,  by Carlyle, and by Ruskin; the world would not be saved by  constitutional formulae.    There were some of his party whose aims went indeed beyond what may be  considered morally legitimate and politically practicable. The Gerlachs  and many of their friends, and the purely military party which was  headed by Prince Charles Frederick, the King's youngest brother, desired  to do away with the Constitution, to dismiss the Parliament, and to  restore the absolute monarchy in a form which would have been more  extreme than that which it had had since 1815. The King himself  sympathised with their wishes and he probably would have acted according  to them were it not that he had sworn to maintain the Constitution. He  was a religious man and he respected his oath. There does not appear any  evidence that Bismarck wished for extreme action of this kind. Even in  his private correspondence, at least in that part of it which has been  published, one finds no desire to see Prussia entirely without a  Parliament. It was a very different thing to wish as he did that the  duties of the Parliament should be strictly limited and that they should  not be allowed completely to govern the State. We must always remember  how much he owed to representative assemblies. Had the Estates General  never been summoned, had the Revolution never taken place, he would  probably have passed his life as a country gentleman, often discontented  with the Government of the country but entirely without influence. He  owed to Parliament his personal reputation, but he owed to it something  more than that. Up to 1847 the only public career open to a Prussian  subject was the Civil Service; it was from them that not only the  subordinate officials but the Ministers of the State were selected. Now  we have seen that Bismarck had tried the Civil Service and deliberately  retired from it. The hatred of bureaucracy he never overcame, even when  he was at the head of the Prussian State. It arose partly from the  natural opposition between the nobleman and the clerk. Bismarck felt in  this like Stein, the greatest of his predecessors, who though he had  taken service under the Prussian Crown never overcame his hatred of  \"_the animal with a pen_\" as he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12406"],[0,"Kepler (#10)"],[1,"that the discovery was not made early  enough to save him a vast amount of labour in computations, but he  managed to find time to compute some logarithm tables for himself,  though he does not seem to have understood quite what Napier had done,  and though with his usual honesty he gave full credit to the Scottish  baron for his invention.    Though Eugenists may find a difficulty in reconciling Napier's  brilliancy with the extreme youth of his parents, they may at any rate  attribute Kepler's occasional fits of bad temper to heredity. His  cantankerous mother, Catherine Kepler, had for some years been carrying  on an action for slander against a woman who had accused her of  administering a poisonous potion. Dame Kepler employed a young advocate  who for reasons of his own \"nursed\" the case so long that after five  years had elapsed without any conclusion being reached another judge was  appointed, who had himself suffered from the caustic tongue of the  prosecutrix, and so was already prejudiced against her. The defendant,  knowing this, turned the tables on her opponent by bringing an  accusation of witchcraft against her, and Catherine Kepler was  imprisoned and condemned to the torture in July, 1620. Kepler, hearing  of the sentence, hurried back from Linz, and succeeded in stopping the  completion of the sentence, securing his mother's release the following  year, as it was made clear that the only support for the case against  her was her own intemperate language. Kepler returned to Linz, and his  mother at once brought another action for costs and damages against her  late opponent, but died before the case could be tried.    A few months before this Sir Henry Wotton, English Ambassador to Venice,  visited Kepler, and finding him as usual, almost penniless, urged him to  go to England, promising him a warm welcome there. Kepler, however,  would not at that time leave Germany, giving several reasons, one of  which was that he dreaded the confinement of an island. Later on he  expressed his willingness to go as soon as his Rudolphine Tables were  published, and lecture on them, even in England, if he could not do it  in Germany, and if a good enough salary were forthcoming.    In 1624 he went to Vienna, and managed to extract from the Treasury 6000  florins on account of expenses connected with the Tables, but, instead  of a further grant, was given letters to the States of Swabia, which  owed money to the Imperial treasury. Some of this he succeeded in  collecting, but the Tables were still further delayed by the religious  disturbances then becoming violent. The Jesuits contrived to have  Kepler's library sealed up, and, but for the Imperial protection, would  have imprisoned him also; moreover the peasants revolted and blockaded  Linz. In 1627, however, the long promised Tables, the first to discard  the conventional circular motion, were at last published at Ulm in four  parts. Two of these parts consisted of subsidiary Tables, of logarithms  and other computing devices, another contained Tables of the elements of  the sun, moon, and planets, and the fourth gave the places of a thousand  stars as determined by Tycho, with Tycho's refraction Tables, which had  the peculiarity of using different values for the refraction of the sun,  moon, and stars. From a map prefixed to some copies of the Tables, we  may infer that Kepler was one of the first, if not actually the first,  to suggest the method of determining differences of longitude by  occultations of stars at the moon's limb. In an Appendix, he showed how  his Tables could be used by astrologers for their predictions, saying  \"Astronomy is the daughter of Astrology, and this modern Astrology again  is the daughter of Astronomy, bearing something of the lineaments of her  grandmother; and, as I have already said, this foolish daughter,  Astrology, supports her wise but needy mother, Astronomy, from the  profits of a profession not generally considered creditable\". There is  no doubt that Kepler strongly resented having to depend so much for his  income on such methods which he certainly did not consider creditable.    It was probably Galileo whose praise of the new Tables induced the Grand  Duke of Tuscany to send Kepler a gold chain soon after their  publication, and we may perhaps regard it as a mark of favour from the  Emperor Ferdinand that he permitted Kepler to attach himself to the  great Wallenstein, now Duke of Friedland, and a firm believer in  Astrology. The Duke was a better paymaster than either of the three  successive Emperors. He furnished Kepler with an assistant and a  printing press; and obtained for him the Professorship of Astronomy at  the University of Rostock in Mecklenburg. Apparently, however, the  Emperor could not induce Wallenstein to take over the responsibility of  the 8000 crowns, still owing from the Imperial treasury on account of  the Rudolphine Tables. Kepler made a last attempt to secure payment at  Ratisbon, but his journey thither brought disappointment and fatigue and  left him in such a condition that he rapidly succumbed to an attack of  fever, dying in November, 1630, in his fifty-ninth year. His body was  buried at Ratisbon, but the tombstone was destroyed during the war then  raging. His daughter, Susanna, the wife of Jacob Bartsch, a physician  who had helped Kepler with his Ephemeris, lost her husband soon after  her father's death, and succeeded in obtaining part of Kepler's arrears  of salary by threatening to keep Tycho's manuscripts, but her  stepmother was left almost penniless with five young children. For their  benefit Louis Kepler printed a \"Dream of Lunar Astronomy,\" which first  his father and then his brother-in-law had been preparing for  publication at the time of their respective deaths. It is a curious  mixture of saga and fairy tale with a little science in the way of  astronomy studied from the moon, and cast in the form of a dream to  overcome the practical difficulties of the hypothesis of visiting the  moon. Other writings in large numbers were left unpublished. No attempt  at a complete edition of Kepler's works was made for a long time. One  was projected in 1714 by his biographer, Hantsch, but all that appeared  was one volume of letters. After various learned bodies had declined to  move in the matter the manuscripts were purchased for the Imperial  Russian library. An edition was at length brought out at Frankfort by C.  Frisch, in eight volumes, appearing at intervals from 1858-1870.    Kepler's fame does not rest upon his voluminous works. With his peculiar  method of approaching problems there was bound to be an inordinate  amount of chaff mixed with the grain, and he used no winnowing machine.  His simplicity and transparent honesty induced him to include  everything, in fact he seemed to glory in the number of false trails he  laboriously followed. He was one who might be expected to find the  proverbial \"needle in a haystack,\" but unfortunately the needle was not  always there. Delambre says, \"Ardent, restless, burning to distinguish  himself by his discoveries he attempted everything, and having once  obtained a glimpse of one, no labour was too hard for him in following  or verifying it. All his attempts had not the same success, and in fact  that was impossible. Those which have failed seem to us only fanciful;  those which have been more fortunate appear sublime. When in search of  that which really existed, he has sometimes found it; when he devoted  himself to the pursuit of a chimera, he could not but fail, but even  then he unfolded the same qualities, and that obstinate perseverance  that must triumph over all difficulties but those which are  insurmountable.\" Berry, in his \"Short History of Astronomy,\" says \"as  one reads chapter after chapter without a lucid, still less a correct  idea, it is impossible to refrain from regrets that the intelligence of  Kepler should have been so wasted, and it is difficult not to suspect at  times that some of the valuable results which lie embedded in this great  mass of tedious speculation were arrived at by a mere accident. On the  other hand it must not be forgotten that such accidents have a habit of  happening only to great men, and that if Kepler loved to give reins to  his imagination he was equally impressed with the necessity of  scrupulously comparing speculative results with observed facts, and of  surrendering without demur the most beloved of his fancies if it was  unable to stand this test. If Kepler had burnt three-quarters of what he  printed, we should in all probability have formed a higher opinion of  his intellectual grasp and sobriety of judgment, but we should have lost  to a great extent the impression of extraordinary enthusiasm and  industry, and of almost unequalled intellectual honesty which we now get  from a study of his works.\"    Professor Forbes is more enthusiastic. In his \"History of Astronomy,\" he  refers to Kepler as \"the man whose place, as is generally agreed, would  have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have  contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge,\" and again _a  propos_ of Kepler's great book, \"it must be obvious that he had at that  time some inkling of the meaning of his laws--universal gravitation.  From that moment the idea of universal gravitation was in the air, and  hints and guesses were thrown out by many; and in time the law of  gravitation would doubtless have been discovered, though probably not by  the work of one man, even if Newton had not lived. But, if Kepler had  not lived, who else could have discovered his Laws?\"                APPENDIX I.    LIST OF DATES.
