Heaven itself does not seem brighter or more beautiful to the  imagination, than these surpassing pageants of fiery rays, and piled-up  beds of orange, golden clouds, with edges too bright to look on, scattered  wreaths of faintest rosy bloom, amber streaks and pale green lakes  between, and amid sky all mingled blue and rose tints, a spectacle to make  one fall over the boat's side, with one's head broken off, with looking  adoringly upwards, but which, on paper, means nothing.    At six o'clock our little canoe grazed the steps at the landing. These  were covered with young women, and boys, and girls, drawing water for  their various household purposes. A very small cedar pail--a piggin, as  they termed it--serves to scoop up the river water, and having, by this  means, filled a large bucket, they transfer this to their heads, and thus  laden, march home with the purifying element--what to do with it, I cannot  imagine, for evidence of its ever having been introduced into their  dwellings, I saw none. As I ascended the stairs, they surrounded me with  shrieks and yells of joy, uttering exclamations of delight and amazement  at my rowing. Considering that they dig, delve, carry burthens, and  perform many more athletic exercises than pulling a light oar, I was  rather amused at this; but it was the singular fact of seeing a white  woman stretch her sinews in any toilsome exercise which astounded them,  accustomed as they are to see both men and women of the privileged skin  eschew the slightest shadow of labour, as a thing not only painful but  degrading. They will learn another lesson from me, however, whose idea of  Heaven was pronounced by a friend of mine, to whom I once communicated it,  to be 'devilish hard work'! It was only just six o'clock, and these women  had all done their tasks. I exhorted them to go home and wash their  children, and clean their houses and themselves, which they professed  themselves ready to do, but said they had no soap. Then began a chorus of  mingled requests for soap, for summer clothing, and a variety of things,  which, if 'Missis only give we, we be so clean for ever!'    This request for summer clothing, by the by, I think a very reasonable  one. The allowance of clothes made yearly to each slave by the present  regulations of the estate, is a certain number of yards of flannel, and as  much more of what they call plains--an extremely stout, thick, heavy  woollen cloth, of a dark grey or blue colour, which resembles the species  of carpet we call drugget. This, and two pair of shoes, is the regular  ration of clothing; but these plains would be intolerable to any but  negroes, even in winter, in this climate, and are intolerable to them in  the summer. A far better arrangement, in my opinion, would be to increase  their allowance of flannel and under clothing, and give them dark chintzes  instead of these thick carpets, which are very often the only covering  they wear at all. I did not impart all this to my petitioners, but  disengaging myself from them, for they held my hands and clothes, I  conjured them to offer us some encouragement to better their condition, by  bettering it as much as they could themselves,--enforced the virtue of  washing themselves and all belonging to them, and at length made good my  retreat. As there is no particular reason why such a letter as this should  ever come to an end, I had better spare you for the present. You shall  have a faithful journal, I promise you, henceforward, as hitherto, from  your's ever.           *       *       *       *       *      Dear E----. We had a species of fish this morning for our breakfast, which  deserves more glory than I can bestow upon it. Had I been the ingenious  man who wrote a poem upon fish, the white mullet of the Altamaha should  have been at least my heroine's cousin. 'Tis the heavenliest creature that  goes upon fins. I took a long walk this morning to Settlement No. 3, the  third village on the island. My way lay along the side of the canal,  beyond which, and only divided from it by a raised narrow causeway, rolled  the brimming river with its girdle of glittering evergreens, while on my  other hand a deep trench marked the line of the rice fields. It really  seemed as if the increase of merely a shower of rain might join all these  waters together, and lay the island under its original covering again. I  visited the people and houses here. I found nothing in any respect  different from what I have described to you at Settlement No. 1. During  the course of my walk, I startled from its repose in one of the  rice-fields, a huge blue heron. You must have seen, as I often have, these  creatures stuffed in museums; but 't is another matter, and far more  curious, to meet them stalking on their stilts of legs over a rice-field,  and then on your near approach, see them spread their wide heavy wings,  and throw themselves upon the air, with their long shanks flying after  them in a most grotesque and laughable manner. They fly as if they did not  know how to do it very well; but standing still, their height (between  four and five feet) and peculiar colour, a dusky, greyish blue, with black  about the head, render their appearance very beautiful and striking.    In the afternoon, I and Jack rowed ourselves over to Darien. It is  Saturday--the day of the week on which the slaves from the island are  permitted to come over to the town, to purchase such things as they may  require and can afford, and to dispose, to the best advantage, of their  poultry, moss, and eggs. I met many of them paddling themselves singly  in their slight canoes, scooped out of the trunk of a tree, and parties  of three and four rowing boats of their own building, laden with their  purchases, singing, laughing, talking, and apparently enjoying their  holiday to the utmost. They all hailed me with shouts of delight, as I  pulled past them, and many were the injunctions bawled after Jack, to  'mind and take good care of Missis!' We returned home through the glory  of a sunset all amber-coloured and rosy, and found that one of the  slaves, a young lad for whom Mr. ---- has a particular regard, was  dangerously ill. Dr. H---- was sent for; and there is every probability  that he, Mr. ----and Mr. O---- will be up all night with the poor  fellow. I shall write more to-morrow. To-day being Sunday, dear E----, a  large boat full of Mr. ----'s people from Hampton came up, to go to  church at Darien, and to pay their respects to their master, and see  their new 'Missis.' The same scene was acted over again that occurred on  our first arrival. A crowd clustered round the house door, to whom I and  my babies were produced, and with every individual of whom we had to  shake hands some half-a-dozen times. They brought us up presents of eggs  (their only wealth), beseeching us to take them, and one young lad, the  son of head-man Frank, had a beautiful pair of chickens, which he  offered most earnestly to S----. We took one of them, not to mortify the  poor fellow, and a green ribbon being tied round its leg, it became a  sacred fowl, 'little missis's chicken.' By the by, this young man had so  light a complexion, and such regular straight features, that, had I seen  him anywhere else, I should have taken him for a southern European, or,  perhaps, in favour of his tatters, a gipsy; but certainly it never would  have occurred to me that he was the son of negro parents. I observed  this to Mr. ----, who merely replied, 'He is the son of head-man Frank  and his wife Betty, and they are both black enough, as you see.' The  expressions of devotion and delight of these poor people are the most  fervent you can imagine. One of them, speaking to me of Mr. ----, and  saying that they had heard that he had not been well, added, 'Oh! we  hear so, missis, and we not know what to do. Oh! missis, massa sick, all  him people _broken_!'    Dr. H---- came again to-day to see the poor sick boy, who is doing much  better, and bidding fair to recover. He entertained me with an account of  the Darien society, its aristocracies and democracies, its little  grandeurs and smaller pettinesses, its circles higher and lower, its  social jealousies, fine invisible lines of demarcation, imperceptible  shades of different respectability, and delicate divisions of genteel,  genteeler, genteelest. 'For me,' added the worthy doctor, 'I cannot well  enter into the spirit of these nice distinctions; it suits neither my  taste nor my interest, and my house is, perhaps, the only one in Darien,  where you would find all these opposite and contending elements  combined.' The doctor is connected with the aristocracy of the place, and,  like a wise man, remembers, notwithstanding, that those who are not, are  quite as liable to be ill, and call in medical assistance, as those who  are. He is a shrewd, intelligent man, with an excellent knowledge of his  profession, much kindness of heart, and apparent cheerful good temper. I  have already severely tried the latter, by the unequivocal expression of  my opinions on the subject of slavery, and, though I perceived that it  required all his self-command to listen with anything like patience to my  highly incendiary and inflammatory doctrines, he yet did so, and though he  was, I have no doubt, perfectly horror-stricken at the discovery, lost  nothing of his courtesy or good-humour. By the by, I must tell you, that  at an early period of the conversation, upon my saying, 'I put all other  considerations out of the question, and first propose to you the injustice  of the system alone,' 'Oh!' replied my friend, the Doctor, 'if you put it  upon that ground, you _stump_ the question at once; I have nothing to say  to that whatever, but,' and then followed the usual train of  pleadings--happiness, tenderness, care, indulgence, &c., &c., &c.--all the  substitutes that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12423"],[0,"A Short History of the United States for School Use (#10)"],[1,"charter, 1691.]    84. The New Arrangements.--For a year or two William was very busy  in Ireland and on the continent. At length he had time to attend to  colonial affairs. He appointed royal governors for both Pennsylvania and  Maryland. William Penn soon had his colony given back to him; but the  Baltimores had to wait many years before they recovered Maryland. In New  York there was a dreadful tragedy. For the new governor, Slaughter, was  persuaded to order the execution of the leaders in the rising against  Andros. Massachusetts did not get her old charter back, but she got  another charter. This provided that the king should appoint the  governor, but the people should elect a House of Representatives. The  most important result of this new arrangement was a series of disputes  between the king's governor and the people's representatives. Maine and  New Plymouth were included in Massachusetts under the new charter. But  New Hampshire remained a royal province.    [Sidenote: Prosperity of the colonies, 1700-60.]    85. The Colonies, 1700-60.--During these years immigrants thronged  to America, and the colonies became constantly stronger. Commerce  everywhere developed, and many manufactures were established.  Throughout the colonies the people everywhere gained power, and had it  not been for the French and Indian wars they would have been happy.  Aside from these wars the most important events of these years were the  overthrow of the Carolina proprietors and the founding of Georgia.    [Illustration: Carolina Rice Fields.]    [Sidenote: Bad government of the Carolina proprietors.]    [Sidenote: Rebellion in Carolina, 1719.]    [Sidenote: North and South Carolina.]    86. North and South Carolina.--The Carolina proprietors and their  colonists had never got on well together. They now got on worse than  ever. The greater part of the colonists were not members of the  Established Church; but the proprietors tried to take away the right to  vote from all persons who were not of that faith. They also interfered  in elections, and tried to prevent the formation of a true  representative assembly. They could not protect the people against the  pirates who blockaded Charleston for weeks at a time. In 1719 the people  of Charleston rebelled. The king then interfered, and appointed a royal  governor. Later he bought out the rights of the proprietors. In this way  Carolina became a royal province. It was soon divided into two  provinces, North Carolina and South Carolina. But there had always been  two separate colonies in Carolina (p. 52).    [Sidenote: General Oglethorpe.]    [Sidenote: Grant of Georgia, 1732.]    87. Founding of Georgia, 1732.--In those days it was the custom in  England to send persons who could not pay their debts to prison. Of  course many of these poor debtors were really industrious persons whom  misfortune or sickness had driven into debt. General Oglethorpe, a  member of Parliament, looked into the prison management. He was greatly  affected by the sad fate of these poor debtors, and determined to do  something for them. With a number of charitable persons he obtained a  part of South Carolina for a colony, and named it Georgia for George II,  who gave the land. Parliament also gave money. For the government  thought it very desirable to have a colony between the rich plantations  of Carolina and the Spanish settlements in Florida.    [Sidenote: Settlement of Georgia, 1733. _Higginson_, 127-130;  _Eggleston_, 62-65; _Source-Book_, 71-73.]    [Sidenote: Progress of the colony.]    88. Georgia, 1733-52.--Naturally Oglethorpe had no difficulty in  getting colonists. For the poor debtors and other oppressed persons were  very glad to have a new start in life. Savannah was founded in 1733. The  Spaniards, however, were not at all glad to have an English colony  planted so near Florida. They attacked the Georgians, and Oglethorpe  spent years in fighting them. The Georgia colonists found it very  difficult to compete with the Carolina planters. For the Carolinians had  slaves to work for them, and the proprietors of Georgia would not let  the Georgians own slaves. Finally they gave way and permitted the  colonists to own slaves. But this so disheartened the Georgia  proprietors that they gave up the enterprise and handed the colony over  to the king. In this way Georgia became a royal province.          CHAPTER 10      EXPULSION OF THE FRENCH    [Sidenote: Louis of France and William of Orange.]    89. Causes of the French Wars.--At the time of the \"Glorious  Revolution\" (p. 58) James II found refuge with Louis XIV, King of  France. William and Louis had already been fighting, and it was easy  enough to see that if William became King of England he would be very  much more powerful than he was when he was only Prince of Orange. So  Louis took up the cause of James and made war on the English and the  Dutch. The conflict soon spread across the Atlantic.    [Sidenote: Disadvantages of the English colonists.]    [Sidenote: Advantages of the French colonists.]    90. Strength of the Combatants.--At first sight it might seem as if  the English colonists were much stronger than the French colonists. They  greatly outnumbered the French. They were much more prosperous and  well-to-do. But their settlements were scattered over a great extent of  seacoast from the Kennebec to the Savannah. Their governments were more  or less free. But this very freedom weakened them for war. The French  colonial government was a despotism directed from France. Whatever  resources the French had in America were certain to be well used.    [Illustration: A \"GARRISON HOUSE\" AT YORK, MAINE, BUILT IN 1676.]    [Sidenote: King William's War, 1689-97. _Eggleston_, 122-123.]    91. King William's War, 1689-97.--The Iroquois began this war by  destroying Montreal. The next winter the French invaded New York. They  captured Schenectady and killed nearly all the inhabitants. Other bands  destroyed New England towns and killed or drove away their inhabitants.  The English, on their part, seized Port Royal in Acadia, but they failed  in an attempt against Quebec. In 1697 this war came to an end. Acadia  was given back to the French, and nothing was gained by all the  bloodshed and suffering.    [Sidenote: Queen Anne's War, 1701-13. _Higginson_, 143-147;  _Source-Book_, 98-100.]    92. Queen Anne's War, 1701-13.--In 1701 the conflict began again.  It lasted for twelve years, until 1713. It was in this war that the Duke  of Marlborough won the battle of Blenheim and made for himself a great  reputation. In America the French and Indians made long expeditions to  New England. The English colonists again attacked Quebec and again  failed. In one thing, however, they were successful. They again seized  Port Royal. This time the English kept Port Royal and all Acadia. Port  Royal they called Annapolis, and the name of Acadia was changed to  Nova Scotia.    [Sidenote: King George's War, 1744-48.]    93. King George's War, 1744-48.--From 1713 until 1744 there was no  war between the English and the French. But in 1744 fighting began again  in earnest. The French and Indians attacked the New England frontier  towns and killed many people. But the New Englanders, on their part, won  a great success. After the French lost Acadia they built a strong  fortress on the island of Cape Breton. To this they gave the name of  Louisburg. The New Englanders fitted out a great expedition and captured  Louisburg without much help from the English. But at the close of the  war (1748) the fortress was given back to the French, to the disgust of  the New Englanders.    [Sidenote: La Salle on the Mississippi, 1681.]    [Sidenote: _McMaster_, 62-65; _Source-book_, 96-98.]    94. The French in the Mississippi Valley.--The Spaniards had  discovered the Mississippi and had explored its lower valley. But they  had found no gold there and had abandoned the country. It was left for  French explorers more than one hundred years later to rediscover the  great river and to explore it from its upper waters to the Gulf of  Mexico. The first Frenchman to sail down the river to its mouth was La  Salle. In 1681, with three canoes, he floated down the Mississippi,  until he reached a place where the great river divided into three large  branches. He sent one canoe down each branch. Returning, they all  reported that they had reached the open sea.    [Sidenote: La Salle attempts to found a colony. _McMaster_, 79-80.]    [Sidenote: Louisiana settled, 1699.]    95. Founding of Louisiana.--La Salle named this immense region  Louisiana in honor of the French king. He soon led an expedition to  plant a colony on the banks of the Mississippi. Sailing into the Gulf of  Mexico, he missed the mouth of the Mississippi and landed on the coast  of Texas. Misfortune after misfortune now fell on the unhappy  expedition. La Salle was murdered, the stores were destroyed, the  Spaniards and Indians came and killed or captured nearly all the  colonists. A few only gained the Mississippi and made their way to  Canada. In 1699, another French expedition appeared in the Gulf of  Mexico. This time the mouth of the Mississippi was easily discovered.  But the colonists settled on the shores of Mobile Bay. It was not until  1718 that New Orleans was founded.    [Sidenote: The French on the Ohio, 1749. _McMaster_, 82-86.]    [Sidenote: The English Ohio Company, 1750.]    96. Struggle for the Ohio Valley.--At the close of King George's  War the French set to work to connect the settlements in Louisiana with  those on the St. Lawrence. In 1749 French explorers gained the Alleghany  River from Lake Erie and went down the Ohio as far as the Miami. The  next year (1750) King George gave a great tract of land on the Ohio  River to an association of Virginians, who formed the Ohio Company. The  struggle for the Ohio Valley had fairly begun. Governor Dinwiddie of  Virginia learned that the French "]]]
