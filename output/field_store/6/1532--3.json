[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/994"],[0,"Riders to the Sea (#1)"],[1,"TO THE SEA    A PLAY IN ONE ACT    By J. M. Synge          INTRODUCTION    It must have been on Synge's second visit to the Aran Islands that he  had the experience out of which was wrought what many believe to be his  greatest play. The scene of \"Riders to the Sea\" is laid in a cottage  on Inishmaan, the middle and most interesting island of the Aran group.  While Synge was on Inishmaan, the story came to him of a man whose body  had been washed up on the far away coast of Donegal, and who, by reason  of certain peculiarities of dress, was suspected to be from the island.  In due course, he was recognised as a native of Inishmaan, in exactly  the manner described in the play, and perhaps one of the most poignantly  vivid passages in Synge's book on \"The Aran Islands\" relates the  incident of his burial.    The other element in the story which Synge introduces into the play is  equally true. Many tales of \"second sight\" are to be heard among Celtic  races. In fact, they are so common as to arouse little or no wonder in  the minds of the people. It is just such a tale, which there seems no  valid reason for doubting, that Synge heard, and that gave the title,  \"Riders to the Sea\", to his play.    It is the dramatist's high distinction that he has simply taken the  materials which lay ready to his hand, and by the power of sympathy  woven them, with little modification, into a tragedy which, for dramatic  irony and noble pity, has no equal among its contemporaries. Great  tragedy, it is frequently claimed with some show of justice, has  perforce departed with the advance of modern life and its complicated  tangle of interests and creature comforts. A highly developed  civilisation, with its attendant specialisation of culture, tends ever  to lose sight of those elemental forces, those primal emotions, naked to  wind and sky, which are the stuff from which great drama is wrought by  the artist, but which, as it would seem, are rapidly departing from us.  It is only in the far places, where solitary communion may be had with  the elements, that this dynamic life is still to be found continuously,  and it is accordingly thither that the dramatist, who would deal with  spiritual life disengaged from the environment of an intellectual maze,  must go for that experience which will beget in him inspiration for  his art. The Aran Islands from which Synge gained his inspiration are  rapidly losing that sense of isolation and self-dependence, which has  hitherto been their rare distinction, and which furnished the motivation  for Synge's masterpiece. Whether or not Synge finds a successor, it is  none the less true that in English dramatic literature \"Riders to the  Sea\" has an historic value which it would be difficult to over-estimate  in its accomplishment and its possibilities. A writer in The Manchester  Guardian shortly after Synge's death phrased it rightly when he wrote  that it is \"the tragic masterpiece of our language in our time; wherever  it has been played in Europe from Galway to Prague, it has made the word  tragedy mean something more profoundly stirring and cleansing to the  spirit than it did.\"    The secret of the play's power is its capacity for standing afar off,  and mingling, if we may say so, sympathy with relentlessness. There is a  wonderful beauty of speech in the words of every character, wherein the  latent power of suggestion is almost unlimited. \"In the big world the  old people do be leaving things after them for their sons and children,  but in this place it is the young men do be leaving things behind for  them that do be old.\" In the quavering rhythm of these words, there is  poignantly present that quality of strangeness and remoteness in beauty  which, as we are coming to realise, is the touchstone of Celtic  literary art. However, the very asceticism of the play has begotten a  corresponding power which lifts Synge's work far out of the current of  the Irish literary revival, and sets it high in a timeless atmosphere of  universal action.    Its characters live and die. It is their virtue in life to be lonely,  and none but the lonely man in tragedy may be great. He dies, and then  it is the virtue in life of the women mothers and wives and sisters to  be great in their loneliness, great as Maurya, the stricken mother, is  great in her final word.    \"Michael has a clean burial in the far north, by the grace of the  Almighty God. Bartley will have a fine coffin out of the white boards,  and a deep grave surely. What more can we want than that? No man at  all can be living for ever, and we must be satisfied.\" The pity and  the terror of it all have brought a great peace, the peace that passeth  understanding, and it is because the play holds this timeless peace  after the storm which has bowed down every character, that \"Riders to  the Sea\" may rightly take its place as the greatest modern tragedy in  the English tongue.

PERSONS         MAURYA (an old woman)......  Honor Lavelle         BARTLEY (her son)..........  W. G. Fay         CATHLEEN (her daughter)....  Sarah Allgood         NORA (a younger daughter)..  Emma Vernon         MEN AND WOMEN            SCENE.    --An Island off the West of Ireland. (Cottage kitchen, with nets,  oil-skins, spinning wheel, some new boards standing by the wall, etc.  Cathleen, a girl of about twenty, finishes kneading cake, and puts it  down in the pot-oven by the fire; then wipes her hands, and begins to  spin at the wheel. NORA, a young girl, puts her head in at the door.)      NORA [In a low voice.]    Where is she?    CATHLEEN She's lying down, God help her, and may be sleeping, if she's  able.    [Nora comes in softly, and takes a bundle from under her shawl.]    CATHLEEN [Spinning the wheel rapidly.]    What is it you have?    NORA The young priest is after bringing them. It's a shirt and a plain  stocking were got off a drowned man in Donegal.    [Cathleen stops her wheel with a sudden movement, and leans out to  listen.]    NORA We're to find out if it's Michael's they are, some time herself  will be down looking by the sea.    CATHLEEN How would they be Michael's, Nora. How would he go the length  of that way to the far north?    NORA The young priest says he's known the like of it. \"If it's Michael's  they are,\" says he, \"you can tell herself he's got a clean burial by the  grace of God, and if they're not his, let no one say a word about them,  for she'll be getting her death,\" says he, \"with crying and lamenting.\"    [The door which Nora half closed is blown open by a gust of wind.]    CATHLEEN [Looking out anxiously.]    Did you ask him would he stop Bartley going this day with the horses to  the Galway fair?    NORA \"I won't stop him,\" says he, \"but let you not be afraid. Herself  does be saying prayers half through the night, and the Almighty God  won't leave her destitute,\" says he, \"with no son living.\"    CATHLEEN Is the sea bad by the white rocks, Nora?    NORA Middling bad, God help us. There's a great roaring in the west, and  it's worse it'll be getting when the tide's turned to the wind.    [She goes over to the table with the bundle.]    Shall I open it now?    CATHLEEN Maybe she'd wake up on us, and come in before we'd done.    [Coming to the table.]    It's a long time we'll be, and the two of us crying.    NORA [Goes to the inner door and listens.]    She's moving about on the bed. She'll be coming in a minute.    CATHLEEN Give me the ladder, and I'll put them up in the turf-loft, the  way she won't know of them at all, and maybe when the tide turns she'll  be going down to see would he be floating from the east.    [They put the ladder against the gable of the chimney; Cathleen goes up  a few steps and hides the bundle in the turf-loft. Maurya comes from the  inner room.]    MAURYA [Looking up at Cathleen and speaking querulously.]    Isn't it turf enough you have for this day and evening?    CATHLEEN There's a cake baking at the fire for a short space. [Throwing  down the turf] and Bartley will want it when the tide turns if he goes  to Connemara.    [Nora picks up the turf and puts it round the pot-oven.]    MAURYA [Sitting down on a stool at the fire.]    He won't go this day with the wind rising from the south and west. He  won't go this day, for the young priest will stop him surely.    NORA He'll not stop him, mother, and I heard Eamon Simon and Stephen  Pheety and Colum Shawn saying he would go.    MAURYA Where is he itself?    NORA He went down to see would there be another boat sailing in the  week, and I'm thinking it won't be long till he's here now, for the  tide's turning at the green head, and the hooker' tacking from the east.    CATHLEEN I hear some one passing the big stones.    NORA [Looking out.]    He's coming now, and he's in a hurry.    BARTLEY [Comes in and looks round the room. Speaking sadly and quietly.]    Where is the bit of new rope, Cathleen, was bought in Connemara?    CATHLEEN [Coming down.]    Give it to him, Nora; it's on a nail by the white boards. I hung it up  this morning, for the pig with the black feet was eating it.    NORA [Giving him a rope.]    Is that it, Bartley?    MAURYA You'd do right to leave that rope, Bartley, hanging by the boards  [Bartley takes the rope]. It will be wanting in this place, I'm telling  you, if Michael is washed up to-morrow morning, or the next morning,  or any morning in the week, for it's a deep grave we'll make him by the  grace of God.    BARTLEY [Beginning to work with the rope.]    I've no halter the way I can ride down on the mare, and I must go now  quickly. This is the one boat going for two weeks or beyond it, and the  fair will be a good fair for horses I heard them saying below.

Col. Sir Thomas Livingstone Mitchell Kt. D.C.L.

L. MITCHELL            PREFACE.        \"Admiring Nature in her wildest grace,\"[* Burns.] it has ever been the  most attractive of the author's duties to explore the interior of  Australia. There the philosopher may look for facts; the painter and the  poet for original studies and ideas; the naturalist for additional  knowledge; and the historian might begin at a beginning. The traveller  there seeks in vain for the remains of cities, temples, or towers; but he  is amply compensated by objects that tell not of decay but of healthful  progress and hope;--of a wonderful past, and of a promising future.  Curiosity alone may attract us into the mysterious recesses of regions  still unknown; but a still deeper interest attaches to those regions, now  that the rapid increase of the most industrious and, may we add most  deserving people on earth, suggests that the land there has been reserved  by the Almighty for their use.    In Australia, the great family of civilized man seems still at that early  period between history and fable, upon which, even in \"the world as known  to the ancients,\" the Roman poet had to look very far back:--    \"Communemque prius, ceu lumina solis et auras, Cautus humum longo  signavit limite mensor.\" [* Ovid, Met. lib. i.]    The Journey narrated in this work was undertaken for the extension of  arrangements depending on physical geography. It completes a series of  internal surveys, radiating from Sydney towards the west, the south, and  the north, which have occupied the author's chief attention during the  last twenty years; and, as on former occasions, it has enabled him to  bring under the notice of men of science some of the earth's productions  hitherto unknown. He cannot sufficiently express his sense of obligation  in this respect, to Mr. Bentham, Sir William Hooker, Dr. Lindley, and  Professor De Vriese, for supplying the botanical matter and notes  contained in this volume, and thus contributing to the general stock of  human knowledge. It is also his pleasing duty to state, that during the  long journey of upwards of a year, Captain P. P. King, R. N., kept a  register of the state of the barometer at the sea side; and, in the midst  of his important avocations, determined, by a very elaborate comparison  of minute details, all the heights of localities herein mentioned.    The new geographical matter is presented to the public with confidence in  its accuracy, derived as it is from careful and frequent observations of  latitude; trigonometrical surveying with the theodolite, whereever  heights were available; and, by actual measurement of the line of route.  This route was connected, at its commencement and termination, with the  trigonometrical survey of the colony; and, in closing on Mount Riddell, a  survey extending two degrees within the tropics, the near coincidence of  his intersections with that summit, as fixed by his survey of 1830, could  not but be very satisfactory to the author.    The geological specimens collected during this journey have been  deposited in the British Museum, and their original locality is shown on  the maps by the numbers marked upon the specimens, so that they may be  available to geologists; hence, in the progress of geological science,  the fossils now brought from these remote regions will be accessible at  any future time, and something known of the geology as well as of the  geography of the interior. As Professor Forbes most readily undertook to  describe the freshwater shells after the work had passed through the  press, that portion of the collection also has thus been brought under  the notice of geologists.
