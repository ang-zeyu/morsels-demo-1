However, if  we are going to the expense of laying in cement, it would be much  preferable to use cement lined pipe, which is not only cheaper than iron  pipe, but makes the most perfect cable conduit, as it affords a  perfectly smooth surface to draw the cable over and give a good duct  edge.    It is not necessary, however, in small installations of cable,  especially where additional connections will not be of frequent  occurrence, to go to the expense of subways, for cable may be safely  laid in the ground in trenches filled in with earth, or can be inclosed  in a plain wooden box or a wooden box filled with pitch.    There are, of course, many localities where, if the cable is laid in  contact with the earth, a chemical action would take place which might  result in the destruction of the cable.    Underground cables are of the following classes: 1. Rubber insulated  cables, insulated with rubber or other homogeneous material. 2. Fibrous  cables, so called from the conductors being covered with some fibrous  material, as cotton or paper, which is saturated with the insulating  material, paraffine, resin oil, or some special compound. Under this  latter head is also included the dry core paper cables.    The first thing to do is to get the cable drawn into the ducts, and on  the proper accomplishment of this depends to a great extent the success  or failure of the whole installation. Probably the ducts have been wired  when the subway was constructed, but if not a wire must be run through  as a means of pulling in the draw rope. There are several kinds of  apparatus for getting a wire through a duct--rods, flexible tapes,  mechanical \"creepers,\" etc.; but probably the best is the sectional rod.  This simply consists of three or four foot lengths of hard wood rods,  having metal tips that screw into each other. A rod is placed in a duct  at a manhole, one screwed to that, both are pushed forward, another one  added and pushed forward, and so on until they extend the entire length  of the duct. Then the wire is attached and the rods are pulled out and  detached one at a time and with the last rod the wire is through. At  least No. 14 galvanized iron or steel wire should be used, for any  smaller size cannot be used a second time, as a rule. In starting to  pull in the draw rope a wire brush should be attached to the wire and to  this again the rope, and when the brush arrives at the distant end of  the duct it very likely will bring with it a miscellaneous collection of  material which for the good of the cable had better be in the manhole  than in the duct.    The reel or drum carrying the cable should be mounted on wheels or jacks  and placed on the same side of the manhole as the duct into which the  cable is to be drawn, and must always be so placed that the cable will  run off the top of the reel.    There are several methods of attaching the draw rope to the cable. As  simple and strong a method as any is to punch two of these holes through  the cable, lead and all, and attach the rope by means of an iron  wire--some of the draw wire will do--run through these holes. Depending  on the length and weight of cable to be pulled it can be drawn either by  hand or by a multiplying winch. The rope should run through a block  fastened in the manhole in such a position that the rope shall have a  good straightaway lead from the mouth of the duct.    The strain on the cable should be perfectly uniform and steady; if the  power is applied by a series of jerks either the lead covering may be  pulled apart or some of the conductors broken. At the reel there must  always be a large enough number of men to turn it and keep the cable  from rubbing on anything, and in the manhole one or more men to see that  the cable feeds into the duct straight and to guide it if necessary. If  the ducts are of iron and are not perfectly smooth at the ends, these  should be made so with a file, and in addition a protector of some sort  should be placed in the mouths of the duct, both above and below the  cable. Six inches of lead pipe, split lengthwise and bent over at one  end to prevent being drawn into the duct with the cable, makes a very  good protector. The cable should be reeled off the drum just fast enough  to prevent any of the power used in pulling the cable through the duct  being utilized in unreeling it. If this latter is allowed to occur the  cable will be bent too short and the lead covering buckled or broken,  and also the cable may be jammed against the upper edge of the duct and  perhaps cut through.    If the reel is allowed to turn faster than the cable is drawn in, the  first three or four turns on the reel will slacken up, and the lead  covering may either be dented or cut through by scraping on the ground.  If the cable end when pulled through up to the block is not long enough  to bend around the hole more than half way, the rope should be  unfastened from its end, a length of rope with a well frayed out end  should be run through the block, and by fastening to the cable close to  the duct, with a series of half hitches, as much slack as necessary can  be pulled in. If this is properly manipulated there need not be a  scratch on the cable, but unless great care is taken the lead may be  pressed up into ridges and the core itself damaged.    Immediately after the cable is drawn in, if the joint is not to be at  once made, the open end or ends should be cut off and the cable soldered  up, as most cables are very susceptible to moisture and readily absorb  water even from the atmosphere. Where practicable it is always a good  plan to pull the cable through as many manholes as possible without  cutting the cable; for the joint is, especially in telephone or  telegraph cables, the weak point. To do this the rope should be pulled  through the proper duct in the next section without unfastening it from  the cable; the winch should be moved to the next manhole, and pulling  through then done as before. There should always be a man in every hole  through which the cable is running to see that it does not bind anywhere  and to keep protectors around the cable.    It is not advisable to pull more than one cable into a duct, and never  advisable to pull a cable into a duct containing another cable, but if  two or more cables have to go into the same duct, they should always be  drawn in together. Lead covered cables and those with no lead on the  outside should never be pulled into the same duct, for if they bind  anywhere the soft cable will suffer where two lead covered cables would  get through all right. Some manufacturers are now putting on their  cables a tape or braid covering, which saves the lead many bad bruises  and cuts, and is a valuable addition to a cable at very little  additional expense.    Practically all electric light and power cables are either single or  double conductors, and the jointing of these is comparatively a simple  matter, although requiring considerable care. The lead is cut back from  each end about four or five inches, and the conductors bared of  insulation for two or three inches. The bare conductors should be  thoroughly tinned by dipping in the metal pot or pouring the melted  solder over them. A sperm candle is better than resin or acid for any  part of the operations where solder is used. A lead sleeve is here  slipped back over the cable, out of the way, and the ends of the  conductors brought together in a copper sleeve which is then sweated to  a firm joint. This part must be as good a piece of work mechanically as  electrically. The bare splice is then wrapped tightly with cotton or  silk tape to a thickness slightly greater than that of the insulation of  the cable, and is thoroughly saturated with the insulating compound  until all moisture previously absorbed by the tape is driven off.    The lead sleeve is then brought over the splice and wiped to the cable.  The joint is then filled with the insulating compound poured through  holes in the top of the sleeve; these holes are then closed and the  joint is complete, and there is no reason why, in light and power  cables, that joint should not be as perfect as any other part of the  cable. When the cable ends are prepared for jointing they should be hung  up in such a position that they are in the same plane, both horizontal  and vertically, and firmly secured there, so that when the lead sleeve  is wiped on the conductor may be in its exact center, and great care  must be taken not to move the cables again until the sleeve is filled  and the insulation sufficiently cooled to hold the conductor in  position.    It is also very important to see that there are no sharp points on the  conductors themselves, on the copper sleeve, on the edges of the lead  covering or on the lead sleeve. All these should be made perfectly  smooth, for points facilitate disruptive discharges. Branch joints had  better be made as T-joints rather than as Y-joints, for they are better  electrically and mechanically, although they occupy more room in the  manholes. They are of course made in the same way as straight joints, a  lead T-sleeve being used, however. For multiple arc circuits copper  T-sleeves and for series circuits copper L-sleeves are used.    Telephone and telegraph cables are made of any required gauge of wire  and with from 1 to 150 conductors in a cable. In jointing these the  splices are never soldered, the conductors being joined either with a  twist joint or with the so-called Western Union splice. Each splice is  covered with a cotton or silk sleeve or a wrapping of tape, the latter  being preferable, although considerably increasing the time necessary  for making the joint. Great care must be taken that no ends of wire are  left sticking up, for they will surely work their way through the tape  and grounds, and crosses will be the result. The wires should always be  joined layer to layer and each splice very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13642"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 1, January 1916 (#10)"],[1,"ind. The work is especially valuable  for the unconscious light which it throws upon the life, manners,  politics, and literature of the country. It presents a vivid picture of  the character of the men with whom it deals. It is sometimes called the  Epic of the Sudan.    From this brief sketch which I have given of the African in ancient and  medieval times it is clear that Negroes should not despise the rock from  which they were hewn. As a race they have a past which is full of interest.  It is worthy of serious study. From it we can draw inspiration; for it  appears that not all black men everywhere throughout the ages have been  \"hewers of wood and drawers of water.\" On the contrary, through long  periods of time there were powerful black nations which have left the  records of their achievements and of which we are just now beginning to  learn a little. This little, however, which we have learned teaches us that  the Negroes of today should work and strive. Along their own special line  and in their own peculiar way they should endeavor to make contributions to  civilization. Their achievements can be such that once more black will be  dignified and the fame of Ethiopia again spread throughout the world.    MONROE N. WORK          THE MIND OF THE AFRICAN NEGRO AS REFLECTED IN HIS PROVERBS        As a study of folk literature of different races offers one way of  understanding their mental attitude toward life and its problems, the  folk literature of the Negro will reveal to us his inherent moral and  intellectual bias and the natural trend of his philosophy. Let us therefore  examine some phases of this subject, paying particular attention to that  part which relates especially to the proverbs. The sources of such  literature are abundant. A little research in a well-equipped library  brings one into a curious and informing mass of knowledge, ever increasing  in bulk, in the French, German and English languages, as well as in many  strange and highly inflected African tongues.    A cursory reading of this literature discloses at once that our general  knowledge of Africa has been based in the past mainly on those external  facts that strike the sense of sight, such as the physical appearance of  the population, native dress and handiwork, musical instruments, implements  of warfare, and customs peculiar to the social and religious life of the  people. Only through the folk literature, however, can we get a glimpse of  the working of the mind of the African Negro. Professor Henry Drummond,  although he had traveled in Africa and had written at length about it,  still exhibited a longing for this insight when he observed: \"I have often  wished that I could get inside of an African for an afternoon and just see  how he looked at things.\" At that time much of the folk literature of that  continent was not as now available. A deeper and more extensive reading of  it at present strengthens our belief in the ancient saying \"Out of Africa  there is always something new,\" a rather disquieting thought, if we have  reached the conclusion that native culture on that continent has never  risen above the zero point.    A critical examination of the content of this folk literature will result  in a division somewhat similar to that found in the same type of literature  of other races. Such a division discloses stories, poetry, riddles and  proverbs. The African folk literature is especially rich in proverbs. So  numerous are these proverbs that it has been said that there is scarcely an  object presented to the eye, scarcely an idea excited in the mind, but it  is accompanied by some sententious aphorism, founded on close observation  of man and animals and in many cases of a decidedly moral tendency. Lord  Bacon remarked many years ago that \"the genius, wit and spirit of a nation  are discovered in its proverbs.\" Cervantes in _Don Quixote_ says \"Methinks,  Sancho, that there is no proverb that is not true, because they are all  judgments drawn from the same experience which is the mother of all  knowledge.\" If these sayings be true, then the proverbs of the African  Negro should be examined in order to see if they approach these  observations.    For convenience of the reader an effort has been made to arrange these  sententious sayings under general subjects. These selected by no means  exhaust the mine of African proverbial lore but are only a few nuggets that  suggest the Negro's power to infer and generalize and to express himself in  a graphic and concise way relative to life as he observed and experienced  it.[1]    _Anger_      Anger does nobody good, but patience is the father of kindness.    _Assistance_      Not to aid one in distress is to kill him in your heart.    _Birth_      Birth does not differ from birth; as the free man was born so was      the slave.      In the beginning our Lord created all. With him there is neither      slave nor free man, but every one is free.    _Boasting_      Boasting is not courage. He who boasts much cannot do much. Much      gesticulation does not prove courage.    _Borrowing_      Borrowing is easy but the day of payment is hard.    _Chance_      He who waits for chance may wait for a year.    _Character_      Wherever a man goes to dwell his character goes with him. Every      man's character is good in his own eyes.    _Charity_      Charity is the father of sacrifice.    _Children_      There is no wealth without children. It is the duty of children to      wait on elders, not elders on children.    _Condemnation_      You condemn on hearsay evidence alone, your sins increase.    _Contempt_      Men despise what they do not understand.    _Covetousness_      If thou seeketh to obtain by force what our Lord did not give thee,      thou wilt not get it.    _Danger of Beauty_      He who marries a beauty, marries trouble.    _Danger of Poverty_      Beg help and you will meet with refusals; ask for alms and you will      meet with misers.    _Danger of Wealth_      It is better to be poor and live long than rich and die young.    _Disposition_      A man's disposition is like a mark in a stone, no one can efface it.    _Doing Good_      If one does good, God will interpret it to him for good.    _Duty to One's Self_      Do not repair another man's fence until you have seen to your own.    _Effort_      You cannot kill game by looking at it.    _Evil Doer_      The evil doer is ever anxious.    _Experience_      We begin by being foolish and we become wise by experience.    _Familiarity_      Familiarity induces contempt, but distance secures respect.    _Faults_      Faults are like a hill, you stand on your own and you talk about      those of other people.    _Faults of the Rich_      If thou art poor, do not make a rich man thy friend.      If thou goest to a foreign country, do not alight at a rich man's      house.    _Favor of the Great_      To love the king is not bad, but a king who loves you is better.    _Folly_      After a foolish action comes remorse.    _Forethought_      A person prepared beforehand is better than after reflection.      The day on which one starts is not the time to commence one's      preparation.    _Forgiveness_      He who forgives ends the quarrel.    _Friends_      There are three friends in this world--courage, sense, and insight.    _Friendship_      Hold a true friend with both of your hands.    _Future_      Thou knowest the past but not the future.      As to what is future, even a bird with a long neck can not see it,      but God only.    _Gossip_      Gossip is unbecoming an elder.    _Gentleness_      A matter dealt with gently is sure to prosper, but a matter dealt      with violently causes vexation.    _Hate_      There is no medicine for hate.    _Heart_      It is the heart that carries one to heaven.    _Heathen_      He is a heathen who bears malice.    _Hope_      Hope is the pillar of the world.    _Ignorance_      Lack of knowledge is darker than night.      An ignorant man is always a slave.      Whoever works without knowledge works uselessly.    _Immortality_      Since thou hast no benefactor in this world, thy having one in the      next world will be all the more pleasant.    _Injury_      He who injures another brings injury upon himself.    _Laziness_      Laziness lends assistance to fatigue.      A lazy man looks for light employment.    _Love_      One does not love another if one does not accept anything from him.      If you love the children of others, you will love your own even      better.    _Meekness_      If one knows thee not or a blind man scolds thee, do not become      angry.    _Mother_      Him whose mother is no more, distress carries off.    _Necessity of Effort_      The sieve never sifts meal by itself.    _Old Age_      There are no charms or medicine against old age.    _Opportunity_      The dawn does not come twice to wake a man.    _Patience_      At the bottom of patience there is heaven.      Patience is the best of qualities; he who possesses it possesses      all things.    _People_      Ordinary people are as common as grass, but good people are dearer      than the eye.    _Politeness_      Bowing to a dwarf will not prevent your standing erect again.      \"I have forgotten thy name\" is better than \"I know thee not.\"    _Poverty_      A poor man has no friends.      He who has no house has no word in society.    _Riches_      Property is the prop of life.      A wealthy man always has followers.    _Sleep_      Sleep has no favorites.    _Strife_      Strife begets a gentle child.    _Sun_      The sun is the king of torches.    _Trade_      Trade is not something imaginary or descriptive, but something real      and profitable.    _Truth_      Lies, however numerous, will be caught by truth when it rises up.      The voice of truth is easily known.    _Unselfishness_      If you love yourself others will hate you, if you humble yourself      others will love you."]]]
