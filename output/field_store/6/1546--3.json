We all heard about Pete Reeve, off and on, as about  the slickest gunman that the ranges ever turned out. So he looks Pete  over and wonders at finding such a little man.\"    The proprietor drew himself up to his full height. \"He didn't know  that size don't make the man! Well, Armstrong trotted out some chuck  for Reeve, and after Pete had eaten, Johnny Strange suggested a game.  They sat in at three-handed stud poker.    \"Things went along pretty good for Johnny. He made a considerable  winning. Then it come late in the afternoon, and he seen he'd have to  be getting back home. He offered to bet everything he'd won, or double  or nothing, and when the boys didn't want to do that, it give him a  clean hand to stand up and get out. He got up and said good-bye and  hung around a while to see how the next hands went. So far as he could  make out, Pete Reeve was losing pretty steady. Then he come on in.    \"Well, when Johnny Strange told about Pete being out there, Sheriff  Anderson was in the room and he rises up.    \"'Don't look good to me,' he says. 'If a gunfighter is losing money,  most like he'll fight to win it back. Maybe I'll go out and look that  game over.'    \"And saying that he slopes out of the room.    \"Well, none of us took much stock in the sheriff going out to take  care of Armstrong. You see Armstrong was the old sheriff, and he give  Anderson a pretty stiff run for his money last election. They both  been spending most of their time and energy the last few years hating  each other. When one of 'em is in office the other goes around saying  that the gent that has the plum is a crook; and then Anderson goes  out, and Armstrong comes in, and Anderson says the same thing about  Armstrong. Take 'em general and they always had the boys worried when  they was together, for fear of a gunfight and bullets flying. And so,  when Anderson stands up and says he's going out to see that Reeve  don't do no harm to Armstrong, we all sat back and kind of laughed.    \"But we laughed at the wrong thing. Long about an hour or so after  dark we hear two men come walking up on the veranda, and one of 'em we  knowed by the sound was the sheriff.\"    \"How could you tell by the sound?\" asked Bull innocently.    \"Well, you see the sheriff always wears steel rims on his heels like  he was a horse. He's kind of close with his money is old Anderson,  I'll tell a man! We hear the ring of them heels on the porch, and  pretty soon in comes the sheriff, herding a gent in ahead of him. And  who d'you think that gent was? It was Reeve! Yes, sir, the old sheriff  had stepped out and grabbed his man. He wasn't there quick enough to  stop the killing of Armstrong, but he got there fast enough to nab  Reeve. Seems that when he was riding up to the house he heard a shot  fired, and then he seen a man run out of the house and jump on his  hoss, and the sheriff didn't stop to ask no questions. He just out  with his gat and drills the gent's hoss. And while Reeve was  struggling on the ground, with the hoss flopping around and dying, the  sheriff runs up and sticks the irons on Reeve. Then he goes into the  house and finds Armstrong lying shot through the heart. Clear as day!  Reeve loses a lot of money, and when it comes to a pinch he hates to  see that money gone when he could get it back for the price of one  slug. So he outs with his gun and shoots Armstrong. And the worst part  of it was that Armstrong didn't have no gun on at the time. The  sheriff found Armstrong's gun hanging on the wall along with his  cartridge belt. Yep, it was plain murder, and Pete Reeve'll hang as  high as the sky--and a good thing, too!\"    This story was a shock to Bull for a reason that would not have  affected most men. That a man who had had the courage to stand up and  face Uncle Bill in a fair duel should have been so cowardly, so  venomous as to take a mean advantage of a gambling companion seemed to  Bull altogether too strange to be reasonable. Certainly, if he had had  a difference with this fellow, thought Bull, Pete Reeve was the man to  let the other use his own weapons before he fought. But to shoot him  down across a table, unwarned--this was too much to believe! And yet  it was the truth, and Pete Reeve was to hang for it.    The big man sat shaking his head. \"And they found the money on Pete  Reeve?\" he asked gloomily. \"They found the money he took off this  Armstrong?\"    \"There's the funny part of the yarn,\" said the proprietor glibly.  \"Pete had the nerve to shoot the gent down in cold blood, but when he  seen him fall he lost his nerve. He didn't wait to grab the money, but  ran out and jumped on his hoss and tried to get away. So there you  are. But it pretty often happens that way! Take the oldest gunfighter  in the world, and, if his stomach ain't resting just right, it sort of  upsets him to see a crimson stain. I seen it happen that way with the  worst of 'em, and in the old days they used to be a rough crowd in my  barroom. They don't turn out that style of gent no more!\" He sighed as  his mind flickered back into the heroic past.    \"And Reeve--he admits he done the killing?\" Bull asked hopelessly.    \"Him? Nope, he's too foxy for that. But the only story he told was so  foolish that we laughed at him, and he ain't had the nerve to try to  bluff us ever since. He says that he was sitting peaceable with  Armstrong when all at once without no warning they was a shot from the  window--the east window, I remember he was particular to say--and  Armstrong dropped forward on the table, shot through the heart.    \"Reeve says that he didn't wait to ask no questions. He blew the  candle out, and having got the darkness on his side, he made a jump  through the door and got onto his hoss. He says that he wanted to  break away to the trees and try to get a shot at the murderer from  cover, but the minute he got onto his hoss, he had his hoss shot from  under him.\"    \"Was they any shots fired then?\"    \"Yep. Reeve says that he fired a couple of times when he fell. But the  sheriff says that Reeve only fired once, as his hoss was falling, and  that the other shot that was found fired out of Reeve's gun was fired  into the heart of Armstrong. Oh, they ain't any doubt about it. All  Reeve has got is a cock-and-bull yarn that would make a fool laugh!\"    Although Bull had been many times assured by his uncle and his cousins  that he was a fool of the first magnitude, he was in no mood for  laughter. Somewhere in the tale there was something wrong, for his  mind refused to conjure up the picture of Reeve pulling his gun and  shooting across the table into the breast of a helpless, unwarned man.  That would not be the method of a man who could stand up to Uncle  Bill. That would not be the method of the man who had sat up on his  bunk and looked so calmly into the face of the sheriff.    Bull stood up and dragged his hat firmly over his eyes. \"I'd kind of  like to see the place where that shooting was done,\" he declared.    \"You got lots of time before night,\" said the proprietor. \"Ain't  more'n a mile and a half out the north trail. Take that path right out  there, and you can ride out inside of five minutes.\"    There was no horse for Bull Hunter to ride. But, having thanked his  host, he stepped out into the cooler sunshine of the late afternoon.    The trail led through scattering groves of cottonwood most of the way,  for it was bottom land, partially flooded in the winter season of  rain, and, even in the driest and hottest part of the summer, marshy  in places. He followed the twisting little trail through spots of  shadow and stretches of open sky until he reached the shack which was  obviously that of the dead Armstrong.    The moment he entered the little cabin he received proof positive.    The furniture had not apparently been disturbed since the shooting.  The table still leaned crazily, as though it had not recovered from a  violent shock on one side. One chair was overturned. A box had been  smashed to splinters, probably by having someone put a foot  through it.    Bull examined the deal table. Across the center of it there was a dark  stain, and on the farther side, two hands were printed distinctly into  the wood, in the same dull color. The whole scene rose revoltingly  distinct in the mind of Bull.    Here sat Dan Armstrong playing his cheerful game, laughing and  jesting, because forsooth he was the winner. And there, on the  opposite side of the table, sat Pete Reeve, the guest in the house of  his host, growing darker and darker as the money was transferred from  his pocket to the pocket of the jovial Armstrong. Then, a sudden  taking of offense at some harmless jest, the cold flash of steel as  Reeve leaned and jumped to his feet, and then the explosion of the  revolver, with Armstrong settling slowly, limply forward on the table.  There he lay with a stream pouring across the table from the death  wound, his helpless arms outstretched on the wood.    Then Reeve, panic-stricken, perhaps with a sudden stirring of remorse,  started for the door, struck the box on his way, smashing it to bits,  and as soon as he got outside, leaped for his horse. Luckily  retribution had overtaken the murderer in the very moment of escape.  Bull Hunter sighed. Never had the strength of the arm of the law been  so vividly brought home to him as by this incident. Suppose that he  had fulfilled his purpose and killed Reeve? Would not the law have  reached for him in the same fashion and taken and crushed him?    He shuddered, and looking up from his broodings, he glanced through  the opposite window and saw that the woods were growing dark in that  direction. Night was approaching, and, with the feeling of night,  there was a ghostly sense of death, as though the spirit of the dead  man were returning to his old home. On the other side of the house, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10338"],[0,"With the Turks in Palestine (#10)"],[1,"me.    Evidently this plan was not feasible. All that night I racked my brain  for a solution. Finally I decided to stake everything on what appeared  to be my only chance. The Tennessee was due on the next day but one,  early in the morning. I gave my friend the name of a boatman who was  under obligations to me and had sworn to be my friend for life or death.  Even under the circumstances I hesitated to trust a Mohammedan, but it  seemed the only thing to do; I had no choice left. My friend brought the  boatman, and I put my plan before him, appealing to his daring and his  sense of honor. I wanted him to take me at midnight in his fishing-boat  from an isolated part of the coast and wait for the appearance of the  Tennessee; then, on her arrival, amid the scramble of boats full of  refugees, I was to jump aboard, while he would return with the other  boats. The poor fellow tried to remonstrate, pointing out the dangers  and what he called--rightly enough, doubtless--the folly of the plan. I  stuck to it, however, making it clear that his part would be well paid  for, and at last he consented and we arranged a meeting-place behind the  sand-dunes by the shore.    I put a few personal belongings into a little suit-case and had my  friend give it to one of the refugees who was to sail on the Tennessee.  If I succeeded, I was to recover it when we reached Egypt. The only  thing I took with me was the paper which declared my \"intention of  becoming an American citizen,\" the \"first paper.\" From this document I  was determined not to part. I shall not tell how I kept it on me, as the  means I used may still be used by others in concealing such papers and a  disclosure of the secret might bring disaster to them. Suffice it to say  that I had the paper with me and that no search would have brought it to  light.    Arrived next morning at the appointed place, I gave the signal agreed  upon, the whine of a jackal, and, after repeating it again and again, I  heard a very low and muffled answer. My boatman was there! I had some  fear that he might have betrayed me and that I should presently see a  soldier or policeman leap out of the little boat, but my fears proved  groundless, the man was faithful.    [ILLUSTRATION: STORMY SEA BREAKING OVER ROCKS OFF JAFFA]    We rowed out quietly, our boat a little nutshell on the tossing waves.  But I was relieved; the elements did not frighten me; on the contrary, I  felt secure and refreshed in the midst of the sea. When morning began to  dawn, scores of little boats came out of the harbor and circled about  waiting for the cruiser. This was our chance. I crouched in the bottom  of our boat and to all appearances my boatman was engaged merely in  fishing. After I had lain there over an hour with my heart beating like  a drum and with small hopes for the success of my undertaking, I heard  at last the whistle of the approaching cruiser followed by a Babel of  mad shouting and cursing among the boatmen. In the confusion I felt it  safe to sit up. No one paid the slightest attention to me. All were  engaged in a wild race to reach and mount the Tennessee's ladder. I  scrambled up with the rest, and when, on the deck, an officer demanded  my passport, I put on a bold front and asked him to tell Captain Decker  that Mr. Aaronsohn wished to see him.    Ten minutes later I stood in the captain's cabin. There I unfolded my  story, and wound up by asking him if, under the circumstances, my \"first  papers\" might not entitle me to protection. As I spoke I could see the  struggle that was going on within him. When he answered it was to  explain, with the utmost kindness, that if he took me aboard his ship it  would be to forfeit his word of honor to the Turkish Government, his  pledge to take only citizens of neutral countries; that he could not  consider me an American on the strength of my first papers; and that any  such evasion might lead to serious complications for him and for his  Government. Well, there was nothing for me to do but to withdraw and go  back to Jaffa to face trial for an attempt to escape.    When I reached the deck again I found it swarming with refugees, many of  whom knew me and came up to congratulate me on getting away. I could  only shake my head and with death in my heart descend the Tennessee's  ladder. It did not matter now what boat I took. Any boatman was eager  enough to take me for a few cents. As I sat in the boat, every stroke of  the oars bringing me nearer to the shore and to what I felt was  inevitable captivity, a great bitterness swelled my heart. I was tired,  utterly tired of all the dangers and trials I had been going through for  the last months. From depression I sank into despair and out of despair  came, strange to say, a great serenity, the serenity of despair.    On the quay I ran into Hassan Bey, commandant of the police, who was  superintending the embarkation of refugees. I knew him and he knew me.  Half an hour later I was in police headquarters under examination by  Hassan Bey. I was desperate, and answered him recklessly. A seasick man  is indifferent to shipwreck. This was the substance of our  conversation:--    \"How did you get aboard the ship?\"    \"In a boat with some refugees. A woman hid me with her skirts.\"    \"So you were trying to escape, were you?\"    \"If I had been, I shouldn't have come back.\"    \"Then what did you do on the cruiser?\"    \"I went to talk to the captain, who is a friend of mine. My life is in  danger. Fewzi Bey is after me, and I wanted _my friends in America_ to  know how justice is done in Palestine.\"    \"Who are your friends in America?\"    \"Men who could break you in a minute.\"    \"Do you know to whom you are speaking?\"    \"Yes, Hassan Bey. I am sick of persecution. I wish you would hang me  with your own hands as you hanged the young Christian; my friends would  have your life for mine.\"    I wonder now how I dared to speak to him in this manner. But the bluff  carried. Hassan Bey looked at me curiously for a moment--then smiled  and offered me a cigarette, assuring me that he believed me a loyal  citizen, and declaring he felt deeply hurt that I had not come to him  for permission to visit the cruiser. We parted with a profusion of  Eastern compliments, and that evening I started back to Zicron-Jacob.    [ILLUSTRATION: THE AUTHOR'S SISTER ON HER HORSE TAYAR]          CHAPTER XI    ESCAPE      The failure of my attempt to leave the country only sharpened my desire  to make another trial. The danger of the enterprise tended to reconcile  me to deserting my family and comrades and seeking safety for myself. As  I racked my brain for a promising plan, a letter came from my sister in  Beirut with two pieces of news which were responsible for my final  escape. The American College was shortly to close for the summer, and  the U.S.S. Chester was to sail for Alexandria with refugees aboard.  Beirut is a four days' trip from our village, and roads are unsafe. It  was out of the question to permit my sister to come home alone, and it  was impossible for any of us to get leave to go after her; nor did we  want to have her at home in the unsettled condition of the country. I  began wondering if I could not possibly get to Beirut and get my sister  aboard the Chester, which offered, perhaps, the last opportunity to go  out with the refugees. It would be a difficult undertaking but it might  be our only chance and I quickly made up my mind to carry it out if it  were a possible thing. I had to act immediately; no time was to be  lost, for no one could tell how soon the Chester might sail.    My last adventure had been entered upon with forebodings, but now I felt  that I should succeed. To us Orientals intuition speaks in very audible  tones and we are trained from childhood to listen to its voice. It was  with a feeling of confidence in the outcome, therefore, that I bade this  second good-bye to my family and dearest friends. Solemn hours they  were, these hours of farewell, hours that needed few words. Then once  more I slipped out into the night to make my secret way to Beirut.    It was about midnight when I left home, dressed in a soldier's uniform  and driving a donkey before me. I traveled only by night and spent each  day in hiding in some cave or narrow valley where I could sleep with  some measure of security. For food I had brought bread, dried figs, and  chocolate, and water was always to be found in little springs and pools.  In these clear, warm nights I used to think of David, a fugitive and  pursued by his enemies. How well I could now understand his despairing  cry: \"How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever?... How long shall  mine enemy be exalted over me?\"    Five nights I journeyed, and at last one morning beautiful Beirut  appeared in the distance and I found myself in the forest of pines that  leads into the city. The fresh dawn was filled with the balmy breath of  the pines and all the odors of the Lebanon. Driving my donkey before me,  I boldly approached the first picket-house and saluted the  non-commissioned officer in military fashion. He stopped me and asked  whence I came and where I was going. I smiled sweetly and replied that I  was the orderly of a German officer who was surveying the country a few  hours to the south and that I was going to Beirut for provisions. Then I  lighted a cigarette and sat down for a chat. After discussing politics  and the war for a few minutes, I jumped up, exclaiming that if I didn't  hurry I should be late, and so took my departure. It was all so simple,  and it brought me safely to Beirut. My donkey, having served the purpose  for which I had brought him, was speedily abandoned, and I hurried to a  friend's house, where I exchanged my uniform for the garb of a civilian.    My sister was the most surprised person on earth when she saw me walking  into her room, and, when I told her that I wanted her to go with me on  the Chester, she thought "]]]
