There are systems of dyeing  and bleaching yarns in cop, roll or beam form, but these are not  employed much in the jute industry. Large quantities of jute yarns  intended for export are reeled, partly because bundles form suitable  bales for transport, and partly because of the varied operations and  sizes of apparatus which obtain in foreign countries.            YARN TABLE FOR JUTE YARNS        90 inches,  or     2-1/2 yards    = 1 thread, or                                           the circumference of the reel     120 threads  or     300   yards    = 1 cut (or lea)       2 cuts     or     600   yards    = 1 heer      12 cuts     or   3,600   yards    = 1 standard hank      48 cuts     or  14,400   yards    = 1 spyndle    Since jute yarns are comparatively thick, it is only the very finest  yarns which contain 12 cuts per hank. The bulk of the yarn is made  up into 6-cut hanks. If the yarn should be extra thick, even 6 cuts  are too many to be combined, and one finds groups of 4 cuts, 3 cuts,  2 cuts, and even 1 cut. A convenient name for any group less than 12  cuts is a \"mill-hank,\" because the number used is simply one of  convenience to enable the mill-hank to be satisfactorily placed on  the swift in the winding frame.    The reeling operation is useful in that it enables one to measure  the length of the yarn; indeed, the operation of reeling, or forming  the yarn into cuts and hanks, has always been used as the method of  designating the count, grist or number of the yarn. We have already  seen that the count of jute yarn is determined by the weight in lbs.  of one spyndle (14,400 yds.).    For 8 lb. per spyndle yarn, and for other yarns of about the same  count, it is usual to have provision for 24 spinning bobbins on the  reel. As the reel rotates, the yarn from these 24 bobbins is wound  round, say,    6 in. apart, and when the reel has made 120 revolutions, or 120  threads at each place from each bobbin, there will be 24 separate  cuts of yarn on the reel. When 120 threads have been reeled as  mentioned, a bell rings to warn the attendant that the cuts are  complete; the reel is then stopped, and a \"lease-band\" is tied round  each group of 120 threads.    A guide rod moves the thread guide laterally and slowly as the  reeling operation is proceeding so that each thread or round may be  in close proximity to its neighbour without riding on it, and this  movement of the thread extends to approximately 6 in., to accommodate  the 6 cuts which are to form the mill-hank.    Each time the reel has made 120 revolutions and the bell rings, the  reeler ties up the several cuts in the width, so that when the  mill-hank is complete, each individual cut will be distinct. In some  case, the two threads of the lease-band instead of being tied, are  simply crossed and recrossed at each cut, without of course breaking  the yarn which is being reeled, although effectively separating the  cuts. At the end of the operation (when the quantity of cuts for the  mill-hank has been reeled) the ends of the lease-band are tied.    The object of the lease-band is for facilitating the operation of  winding, and for enabling the length to be checked with approximate  correctness.    When the reel has been filled with, say, twenty-four 6-cut hanks,  there will evidently be 3 spyndles of yarn on the reel. The 24  mill-hanks are then slipped off the end of the reel, and the hanks  taken to the bundling stool or frame. Here they, along with others  of the same count, are made up into bundles which weigh from 54 lb.  to 60 lb. according to the count of the yarn. Each bundle contains a  number of complete hanks, and it is unusual to split a hank for the  purpose of maintaining an absolutely standard weight bundle. Indeed,  the bundles contain an even number of hanks, so that while there  would be exactly 56 lb. per bundle of 7 lb. yarn, or 8 lb. yarn,  there would be 60 lb in a bundle of 7-1/2 lb. yarn, and 54 lb.  in a bundle of 9 lb. yarn.    The chief point in reeling is to ensure that the correct number of  threads is in each cut, i.e. to obtain a \"correct tell\"; this ideal  condition may be impracticable in actual work, but it is wise to  approach it as closely as possible. Careless workers allow the reel  to run on after one or more spinning bobbins are empty, and this  yields what is known as \"short tell.\" It is not uncommon to  introduce a bell wheel with, say, 123 or 124 teeth, instead of the  nominal 120 teeth, to compensate for this defect in reeling.          CHAPTER XII.  WINDING: ROLLS AND COPS    The actual spinning and twisting operations being thus completed,  the yarns are ready to be combined either for more elaborate types  of twist, or for the processes of cloth manufacture. In its simplest  definition, a fabric consists of two series of threads interlaced in  such way as to form a more or less solid and compact structure. The  two series of threads which are interlaced receive the technical  terms of warp and weft--in poetical language, warp and woof. The  threads which form the length of the cloth constitute the warp,  while the transverse threads are the weft.    The warp threads have ultimately to be wound or \"beamed\" on to a  large roller, termed a weaver's beam, while the weft yarn has to be  prepared in suitable shape for the shuttle. These two distinct  conditions necessitate two general types of winding:    (_a_) Spool winding or bobbin winding for the warp yarns.    (_b_) Cop winding or pirn winding for the weft yarns.    For the jute trade, the bulk of the warp yarn is wound from the  spinning bobbin on to large rolls or spools which contain from 7 to  8 lb. of yarn; the weft is wound from the spinning bobbin into cops  which weigh approximately 4 to 8 ounces.    Originally all jute yarns for warp were wound on to flanged bobbins  very similar to, but larger than, those which are at present used  for the linen trade. The advent of the roll-winding machine marked a  great advance in the method of winding warp yarns as compared with  the bobbin winding method; indeed, in the jute trade, the latter are  used only for winding from hank those yarns which have been bleached,  dyed or similarly treated. Fig. 22 illustrates one of the modern  bobbin winding machines for jute made by Messrs. Charles Parker,  Sons & Co., Dundee. The finished product is illustrated by two full  bobbins on the stand and close to a single empty bobbin. There are  also two full bobbins in the winding position, and several hanks of  yarn on the swifts. Each bobbin is driven by means of two discs, and  since the drive is by surface contact between the discs and the  bobbin, an almost constant speed is imparted to the yarn throughout  the process. An automatic stop motion is provided for each bobbin;  this apparatus lifts the bobbin clear of the discs when the bobbin  is filled as exemplified in the illustration.    The distance between the flanges of the bobbin is, obviously, a  fixed one in any one machine, and the diameter over the yarn is  limited. On the other hand, rolls may be made of varying widths and  any suitable diameter. And while a bobbin holds about 2 lb. of yarn,  a common size of roll weighs, as already stated, from 7 to 8 lb.  Such a roll measures, about 9 in. long and 8 in. diameter; hence for  8 lb. yarn, the roll capacity is 14,400 yards.    Rolls very much larger than the above are made on special machines  adopted to wind about six rolls as shown in Fig. 23. It is built  specially for winding heavy or thick yarns into rolls of 15 in.  diameter and 14 in. length, and this particular machine is used  mostly by rope makers and carpet manufacturers. One roll only is  shown in the illustration, and it is winding the material from a 10  in. x 5 in. rove bobbin. The rove is drawn forward by surface or  frictional contact between the roll itself and a rapidly rotating  drum. The yarn guide is moved rapidly from side to side by means of  the grooved cam on the left, the upright lever fulcrumed near the  floor, and the horizontal rod which passes in front of the rolls and  upon which are fixed the actual yarn guides. This rapid traverse,  combined with the rotation of the rolls, enables the yarn to be  securely built upon a paper or wooden tube; no flanges are required,  and hence the initial cost as well as the upkeep of the foundations  for rolls is much below that for bobbins.    [Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co_.  FIG. 22 BOBBIN WINDING MACHINE WITH HANKS]    Precisely the same principles are adopted for winding the ordinary 9  in. x 8 in. or 8 in. x 7 in. rolls for the warping and dressing  departments. These rolls are made direct from the yarn on spinning  bobbins, but the machines are usually double-sided, each side having  two tiers; a common number of spools for one machine is 80.    The double tier on each side is practicable because of the small  space required for the spinning bobbins. When, however, rolls are  wound from hank, as is illustrated in Fig. 24, and as practised in  several foreign countries even for grey yarn, one row only at each  side is possible. Both types are made by each machine maker, the one  illustrated in Fig. 24 being the product of Messrs. Charles Parker,  Sons & Co., Dundee.    In all cases, the yarns are built upon tubes as mentioned, the  wooden ones weighing only a few ounces and being practically  indestructible, besides being very convenient for transit; indeed it  looks highly probable that the use of these articles will still  further reduce the amount of yarn exported in bundle form.

Above the coffin by my head there grew      A flower for a symbol sweet and tragic,    Violet and sulphur-yellow was its hue,      It seemed to throb with love's mysterious magic.      Tradition says, when Christ was crucified      On Calvary, that in that very hour    These petals with the Savior's blood were dyed,      And therefore is it named the passion-flower.      The hue of blood, they say, its blossom wears,      And all the instruments of human malice    Used at the crucifixion still it bears      In miniature within its tiny chalice.      Whatever to the Passion's rite belongs,      Each tool of torture here is represented    The crown of thorns, cup, nails and hammer, thongs,      The cross on which our Master was tormented.      'Twas such a flower at my tomb did stand,      Above my lifeless form in sorrow bending,    And, like a mourning woman, kissed my hand,       My brow and eyes, with silent grief contending.      And then--O witchery of dreams most strange!--      By some occult and sudden transformation    This flower to a woman's shape did change--      'Twas she I loved with soul-deep adoration!      'Twas thou in truth, my dearest, only thou;      I knew thee by thy kisses warm and tender.    No flower-lips thus softly touched my brow,      Such burning tears no flower's cup might render!    Mine eyes were shut, and yet my soul could see      Thy steadfast countenance divinely beaming,    As, calm with rapture, thou didst gaze on me,      Thy features in the spectral moonlight gleaming.      We did not speak, and yet my heart could tell      The hidden thoughts that thrilled within thy bosom.    No chaste reserve in spoken words may dwell--      With silence Love puts forth its purest blossom.      A voiceless dialogue! one scarce might deem,      While mute we thus communed in tender fashion,    How time slipped by like some seraphic dream      Of night, all woven of joy and fear-sweet passion.      Ah, never ask of us what then we said;      Ask what the glow-worm glimmers to the grasses,    Or what the wavelet murmurs in its bed,      Or what the west wind whispers as it passes.      Ask what rich lights from carbuncles outstream,      What perfumed thoughts o'er rose and violet hover--    But never ask what, in the moonlight's beam,      The sacred flower breathed to her dead lover.      I cannot tell how long a time I lay,      Dreaming the ecstasy of joys Elysian,    Within my marble shrine. It fled away--      The rapture of that calm untroubled vision.      Death, with thy grave-deep stillness, thou art best,      Delight's full cup thy hand alone can proffer;    The war of passions, pleasure without rest--      Such boons are all that vulgar life can offer.      Alas! a sudden clamor put to flight      My bliss, and all my comfort rudely banished;    'Twas such a screaming, ramping, raging fight      That mid the uproar straight my flower vanished.      Then on all sides began a savage war      Of argument, with scolding and with jangling.    Some voices surely I had heard before--      Why, 'twas my bas-reliefs had fall'n a-wrangling!      Do old delusions haunt these marbles here,      And urge them on to frantic disputations?    The terror-striking shout of Pan rings clear,      While Moses hurls his stern denunciations.      Alack! the wordy strife will have no end,      Beauty and Truth will ever be at variance,    A schism still the ranks of man will rend      Into two camps, the Hellenes and Barbarians.      Both parties thus reviled and cursed away,      And none who heard could tell the why or whether,    Till Balaam's ass at last began to bray      And soon outbawled both gods and saints together.      With strident-sobbing hee-haw, hee-haw there--      His unremitting discords without number--    That beast so nearly brought me to despair      That I cried out--and wakened from my slumber.           *       *       *       *       *          THE JOURNEY TO THE HARZ[49] (1824)    BY HEINRICH HEINE    TRANSLATED BY CHARLES GODFREY LELAND    \"Nothing is permanent but change, nothing constant but death.

The town of Goettingen, celebrated for its sausages and its University,  belongs to the King of Hanover, and contains nine hundred and  ninety-nine dwellings, divers churches, a lying-in hospital, an  observatory, a prison for students, a library, and a \"Ratskeller,\" where  the beer is excellent. The stream which flows by the town is called the  Leine, and is used in summer for bathing, its waters being very cold,  and in more than one place it is so broad that Lueder was obliged to take  quite a run ere he could leap across. The town itself is beautiful, and  pleases most when one's back is turned to it. It must be very ancient,  for I well remember that five years ago, when I matriculated there (and  shortly after received notice to quit), it had already the same gray,  prim look, and was fully furnished with catch-polls, beadles,  dissertations, _thes dansants_, washerwomen, compendiums, roasted  pigeons, Guelphic orders, graduation coaches, pipe-heads,  court-councilors, law-councilors, expelling councilors, professors  ordinary and extraordinary. Many even assert that, at the time of the  Great Migrations, every German tribe left behind in the town a loosely  bound copy of itself in the person of one of its members, and that from  these descended all the Vandals, Frisians, Suabians, Teutons, Saxons,  Thuringians,[50] and others, who at the present day still abound in  Goettingen, where, separately distinguished by the color of their caps  and pipe-tassels, they may be seen straying singly or in hordes along  the Weender Street. They still fight their battles on the bloody arena  of the _Rasenmill, Ritschenkrug_, and _Bovden_, still preserve the mode  of life peculiar to their savage ancestors, and still, as at the time of  the migrations, are governed partly by their _Duces_, whom they call  \"chief cocks,\" and partly by their primevally ancient law-book, known as  the _Comment_, which fully deserves a place among the _leges  barbarorum_.    The inhabitants of Goettingen are generally divided into Students,  Professors, Philistines, and Cattle, the points of difference between  these castes being by no means strictly defined. The \"Cattle\" class is  the most important. I might be accused of prolixity should I here  enumerate the names of all the students and of all the regular and  irregular professors; besides, I do not just at present distinctly  remember the appellations of all the former gentlemen; while among the  professors are many who as yet have no name at all. The number of the  Goettingen \"Philistines\" must be as numerous as the sands (or, more  correctly speaking, as the mud) of the seashore; indeed, when I beheld  them of a morning, with their dirty faces and clean bills, planted  before the gate of the collegiate court of justice, I wondered greatly  that such an innumerable pack of rascals should ever have been created  by the Almighty.    [Illustration: MARKET PLACE GOeTTINGEN]           *       *       *       *       *    It was as yet very early in the morning when I left Goettingen, and the  learned ----, beyond doubt, still lay in bed, dreaming as usual that he  wandered in a fair garden, amid the beds of which grew innumerable white  papers written over with citations. On these the sun shone cheerily, and  he plucked up several here and there and laboriously planted them in new  beds, while the sweetest songs of the nightingales rejoiced his old  heart.    Before the Weender Gate I met two small native schoolboys, one of whom  was saying to the other, \"I don't intend to keep company any more with  Theodore; he is a low blackguard, for yesterday he didn't even know the  genitive of _Mensa_.\" Insignificant as these words may appear, I still  regard them as entitled to be recorded--nay, I would even write them as  town-motto on the gate of Goettingen, for the young birds pipe as the old  ones sing, and the expression accurately indicates the narrow, petty  academic pride so characteristic of the \"highly learned\" Georgia  Augusta.[51]  The fresh morning air blew over the highroad, the birds  sang cheerily, and, little by little, with the breeze and the birds, my  mind also became fresh and cheerful. Such refreshment was sorely needed  by one who had long been confined in the Pandect stable. Roman casuists  had covered my soul with gray cobwebs; my heart was as though jammed  between the iron paragraphs of selfish systems of jurisprudence; there  was an endless ringing in my ears of such sounds as \"Tribonian,  Justinian, Hermogenian, and Blockheadian,\" and a sentimental brace of  lovers seated under a tree appeared to me like an edition of the _Corpus  Juris_ with closed clasps.
