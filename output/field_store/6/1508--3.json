Welsh Fairy Tales    By    WILLIAM ELLIOT GRIFFIS    1921        A PREFACE-LETTER TO MY GRANDFATHER    DEAR CAPTAIN JOHN GRIFFIS:    Although I never saw you, since you died in 1804, I am glad you were  one of those Welshmen who opposed the policy of King George III and  that you, after coming to America in 1783, were among the first sea  captains to carry the American flag around the world. That you knew  many of the Free Quakers and other patriots of the Revolution and that  they buried you among them, near Benjamin Franklin, is a matter of  pride to your descendants. That you were born in Wales and spoke  Welsh, as did also those three great prophets of spiritual liberty,  Roger Williams, William Penn, and Thomas Jefferson, is still further  ground for pride in one's ancestry. Now, in the perspective of history  we see that our Washington and his compeers and Wilkes, Barre, Burke  and the friends of America in Parliament were fighting the same battle  of Freedom. Though our debt to Wales for many things is great, we  count not least those inheritances from the world of imagination, for  which the Cymric Land was famous, even before the days of either  Anglo-Saxon or Norman.

THE SWORD OF AVALON          I      WELSH RABBIT AND HUNTED HARES      Long, long ago, there was a good saint named David, who taught the  early Cymric or Welsh people better manners and many good things to  eat and ways of enjoying themselves.    Now the Welsh folks in speaking of their good teacher pronounced his  name Tafid and affectionately Taffy, and this came to be the usual  name for a person born in Wales. In our nurseries we all learned that  \"Taffy was a Welshman,\" but it was their enemies who made a bad rhyme  about Taffy.    Wherever there were cows or goats, people could get milk. So they  always had what was necessary for a good meal, whether it were  breakfast, dinner or supper. Milk, cream, curds, whey and cheese  enriched the family table. Were not these enough?    But Saint David taught the people how to make a still more delicious  food out of cheese, and that this could be done without taking the  life of any creature.    Saint David showed the girls how to take cheese, slice and toast it  over the coals, or melt it in a skillet and pour it hot over toast or  biscuit. This gave the cheese a new and sweeter flavor. When spread on  bread, either plain, or browned over the fire, the result, in  combination, was a delicacy fit for a king, and equal to anything  known.    The fame of this new addition to the British bill of fare spread near  and far. The English people, who had always been fond of rabbit pie,  and still eat thousands of Molly Cotton Tails every day, named it  \"Welsh Rabbit,\" and thought it one of the best things to eat. In fact,  there are many people, who do not easily see a joke, who misunderstand  the fun, or who suppose the name to be either slang, or vulgar, or a  mistake, and who call it \"rarebit.\" It is like \"Cape Cod turkey\"  (codfish), or \"Bombay ducks\" (dried fish), or \"Irish plums\" (potatoes)  and such funny cookery with fancy names.    Now up to this time, the rabbits and hares had been so hunted with the  aid of dogs, that there was hardly a chance of any of them surviving  the cruel slaughter.    In the year 604, the Prince of Powys was out hunting. The dogs started  a hare, and pursued it into a dense thicket. When the hunter with the  horn came up, a strange sight met his eyes. There he saw a lovely  maiden. She was kneeling on the ground and devoutly praying. Though  surprised at this, the prince was anxious to secure his game. He  hissed on the hounds and ordered the horn to be blown, for the dogs to  charge on their prey, expecting them to bring him the game at once.  Instead of this, though they were trained dogs and would fight even a  wolf, they slunk away howling, and frightened, as if in pain, while  the horn stuck fast to the lips of the blower and he was silent.  Meanwhile, the hare nestled under the maiden's dress and seemed not in  the least disturbed.    Amazed at this, the prince turned to the fair lady and asked:    \"Who are you?\"    She answered, \"My mother named me Monacella. I have fled from Ireland,  where my father wished to marry me to one of his chief men, whom I did  not love. Under God's guidance, I came to this secret desert place,  where I have lived for fifteen years, without seeing the face of man.\"    To this, the prince in admiration replied: \"O most worthy Melangell  [which is the way the Welsh pronounce Monacella], because, on account  of thy merits, it has pleased God to shelter and save this little,  wild hare, I, on my part, herewith present thee with this land, to be  for the service of God and an asylum for all men and women, who seek  thy protection. So long as they do not pollute this sanctuary, let  none, not even prince or chieftain, drag them forth.\"    The beautiful saint passed the rest of her life in this place. At  night, she slept on the bare rock. Many were the wonders wrought for  those who with pure hearts sought her refuge. The little wild hares  were under her special protection, and they are still called  \"Melangell's Lambs.\"          II      THE MIGHTY MONSTER AFANG      After the Cymric folk, that is, the people we call Welsh, had come up  from Cornwall into their new land, they began to cut down the trees,  to build towns, and to have fields and gardens. Soon they made the  landscape smile with pleasant homes, rich farms and playing children.    They trained vines and made flowers grow. The young folks made pets of  the wild animals' cubs, which their fathers and big brothers brought  home from hunting. Old men took rushes and reeds and wove them into  cages for song birds to live in.    While they were draining the swamps and bogs, they drove out the  monsters, that had made their lair in these wet places. These terrible  creatures liked to poison people with their bad breath, and even ate  up very little boys and girls, when they strayed away from home.    So all the face of the open country between the forests became very  pretty to look at. The whole of Cymric land, which then extended from  the northern Grampian Hills to Cornwall, and from the Irish Sea, past  their big fort, afterward called London, even to the edge of the  German Ocean, became a delightful place to live in.    The lowlands and the rivers, in which the tide rose and fell daily,  were especially attractive. This was chiefly because of the many  bright flowers growing there; while the yellow gorse and the pink  heather made the hills look as lovely as a young girl's face. Besides  this, the Cymric maidens were the prettiest ever, and the lads were  all brave and healthy; while both of these knew how to sing often and  well.    Now there was a great monster named the Afang, that lived in a big  bog, hidden among the high hills and inside of a dark, rough forest.    This ugly creature had an iron-clad back and a long tail that could  wrap itself around a mountain. It had four front legs, with big knees  that were bent up like a grasshopper's, but were covered with scales  like armor. These were as hard as steel, and bulged out at the thighs.  Along its back, was a ridge of horns, like spines, and higher than an  alligator's. Against such a tough hide, when the hunters shot their  darts and hurled their javelins, these weapons fell down to the  ground, like harmless pins.    On this monster's head, were big ears, half way between those of a  jackass and an elephant. Its eyes were as green as leeks, and were  round, but scalloped on the edges, like squashes, while they were as  big as pumpkins.    The Afang's face was much like a monkey's, or a gorilla's, with long  straggling gray hairs around its cheeks like those of a walrus. It  always looked as if a napkin, as big as a bath towel, would be  necessary to keep its mouth clean. Yet even then, it slobbered a good  deal, so that no nice fairy liked to be near the monster.    When the Afang growled, the bushes shook and the oak leaves trembled  on the branches, as if a strong wind was blowing.    But after its dinner, when it had swallowed down a man, or two calves,  or four sheep, or a fat heifer, or three goats, its body swelled up  like a balloon. Then it usually rolled over, lay along the ground, or  in the soft mud, and felt very stupid and sleepy, for a long while.    All around its lair, lay wagon loads of bones of the creatures, girls,  women, men, boys, cows, and occasionally a donkey, which it had  devoured.    But when the Afang was ravenously hungry and could not get these  animals and when fat girls and careless boys were scarce, it would  live on birds, beasts and fishes. Although it was very fond of cows  and sheep, yet the wool and hair of these animals stuck in its big  teeth, it often felt very miserable and its usually bad temper grew  worse.    Then, like a beaver, it would cut down a tree, sharpen it to a point  and pick its teeth until its mouth was clean. Yet it seemed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9380"],[0,"A Nonsense Anthology (#1)"],[1,"must be a fool indeed who cannot at    times play the fool; and he who does not    enjoy nonsense must be lacking in sense_.                      _WILLIAM J.
