[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13117"],[0,"The Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds, Volume 1 (#10)"],[1," observed any in  the lower ranges. The nest is not a difficult one to find, being large  and of loose construction; from 15 to 30 feet up a medium-sized tree  close to the trunk or sometimes in a large fork. They never seem to  build in the spruce firs which abound about Murree. They are by no  means shy birds, and hop about the trees close by while their nest is  being examined. Five is the ordinary number of eggs, which differ very  much in appearance and size: the longest I have measures 1.25 and the  shortest 1.1. Some are paler, some darker; some are of a uniform pale  greenish-ash colour with a darker ring, while others are thickly  speckled and freckled with a darker shade of the same colour. Some  lack the odd ink-scratch which is so often to be seen on the larger  end, and is the most peculiar feature of the egg, while a few have it  at the thinner end.    \"I should describe the average type as a long egg for its breadth;  ground-colour greenish ashy with very thick sprinklings of spots of a  darker and more greenish shade of the same colour, a ring of a darker  dull olive round the large end, on which are one or two lines that  look like a haphazard scratch from a fine steel pen.\"    From Dhurmsala Captain Cock wrote to me that this was \"a most common  bird at Dhurmsala; appears in large flocks during the winter, and  often mixes with _Garrulus bispecularis_ and _Urocissa flavirostris_.  Pairs off about the end of April, when nidification begins. Builds a  rather rough nest of sticks, generally placed on a tall sapling oak  near the top; sometimes among the thicker branches of a pollard oak:  outer nest small twigs roughly put together; inner nest dry roots and  fibres, rather deep cup-shaped. Eggs number from four to five and vary  in shape. I have found them sometimes nearly round, but more generally  the usual shape. They vary in their colour, too, some being much  lighter than others, but most of them have a few hair-like streaks on  the larger end.\"    From Mussoorie Captain Hutton tells us that \"the Black-throated Jay  breeds in May and June, placing the nest sometimes on the branch of a  tall oak tree (_Quercus incana_), at other times in a thick bush. It  is composed of a foundation of twigs, and lined with fine roots of  grass &c. mixed with the long black fibres of ferns and mosses, which  hang upon the forest trees, and have much the appearance of black  horse-hair. The nest is cup-shaped, rather shallow, loosely put  together, circular, and about 41/2 inches in diameter. The eggs are  sometimes three, sometimes four in number, of a greenish stone-grey,  freckled, chiefly at the larger end, with dusky and a few black  hair-like streaks, which are not always present; they vary also in  the amount of dusky freckling at the larger end. The nestling bird is  devoid of the lanceolate markings on the throat.\"    From Nynee Tal Colonel G.F.L. Marshall writes:--\"The Black-throated  Jay builds a very small cup-shaped nest of black hair-like creepers  and roots, intertwined and placed in a rough irregular casing of  twigs. A nest found on the 2nd June containing three hard-set eggs was  placed conspicuously on the top of a young oak sapling about 7 feet  high, standing alone in an open glade, in the forest on Aya Pata,  which is about 7000 feet above the sea. Another nest, found at an  elevation of about 4500 feet on the 9th June, contained two eggs; it  was placed about 10 feet from the ground in a small tree in a hedgerow  amongst cultivated fields.\"    Mr. Hodgson notes from Jaha Powah:--\"Found five nests of this species  between 18th and 30th May. Builds near the tops of moderate-sized  trees in open districts, making a very shallow nest of thin elastic  grasses sparingly used and without lining. The nest is placed on some  horizontal branch against some upright twig, or at some horizontal  fork. It is nearly round and has a diameter of about 6 inches. They  lay three or four eggs of a sordid vernal green clouded with obscure  brown.\"    The eggs are somewhat lengthened ovals, very much smaller than, though  so far as coloration goes very similar to, those of _G. glandarius_.  The ground-colour in some is a brown stone colour, in others pale  greenish white, and intermediate shades occur, and they are very  minutely and feebly freckled and mottled over the whole surface with a  somewhat pale sepia-brown. This mottling differs much in intensity; in  some few eggs indeed it is absolutely wanting, while in others, though  feeble elsewhere, it forms a distinct, though undefined, brownish cap  or zone at the large end. The eggs generally have little or no gloss.  It is not uncommon to find a few hair-like dark brown lines, more or  less zigzag, about the larger end.    In length they vary from 1.03 to 1.23, and in breadth from 0.78 to  0.88; but the average of twenty-four eggs is 1.12 by 0.85.      25. Garrulus leucotis, Hume. _The Burmese Jay_.    Garrulus leucotis, _Hume, Hume, Cat._ no. 669 bis.    The nest of this Jay has not yet been found, but Capt. Bingham  writes:--    \"Like Mr. Davison I have found this very handsome Jay affecting only  the dry _Dillenia_ and pine-forests so common in the Thoungyeen  valley. I have seen it feeding on the ground in such places with  _Gecinus nigrigenys, Upupa longirostris_, and other birds. I shot one  specimen, a female, in April, near the Meplay river, that must have  had a nest somewhere, which, however, I failed to find, for she had a  full-formed but shell-less egg inside her.\"      26. Garrulus bispecularis, Vigors. _The Himalayan Jay_.    Garrulus bispecularis, _Vig., Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 307; _Hume, Rough  Draft N. & E._ no. 669.    The Himalayan Jay breeds pretty well throughout the lower ranges of  the Himalayas. It is nowhere, that I have seen, numerically very  abundant, but it is to be met with everywhere. It lays in March and  April, and, though I have never taken the nest myself, I have now  repeatedly had it sent me. It builds at moderate heights, rarely above  25 feet from the ground, in trees or thick shrubs, at elevations of  from 3000 to 7000 feet. The nest is a moderate-sized one, 6 to 8  inches in external diameter, composed of fine twigs and grass, and  lined with finer grass and roots.    The nest is usually placed in a fork.    The eggs are four to six in number.    Mr. Hodgson notes that he \"found a nest\" of this species \"on the 20th  April, in the forest of Shewpoori, at an elevation of 7000 feet. The  nest was placed in the midst of a large tree in a fork. The nest was  very shallow, but regularly formed and compact. It was composed of  long seeding grasses wound round and round, and lined with finer  and more elastic grass-stems. The nest measured about 61/2 inches in  diameter, but the cavity was only about half an inch deep.\"    Colonel C.H.T. Marshall remarks:--\"I only took one authenticated set  of eggs of this species (I found several with young), as it is an  early breeder--I say authenticated eggs, because I _think_ we may have  attributed some to _Garrulus lanceolatus_, as the nests and eggs are  very similar, and having a large number of the eggs of the latter, I  took some from my shikaree without verifying them.    \"The nest I took on the 6th May, 1873, at Murree, was at an elevation,  I should say, of between 6500 and 7000 feet (as it was near the top  of the hill), in the forest. The tree selected was a horse-chestnut,  about 25 feet high. The nest was near the top, which is the case with  nearly all the Crows' and Magpies' nests that I have taken. It was  of loose construction, made of twigs and fibres, and contained five  partially incubated eggs.    \"The eggs are similar to those of _G. lanceolatus_. I have carefully  compared the five of the species which I am now describing with twenty  of the other, and find that the following differences exist. The egg  of _G. bispecularis_ is more obtuse and broader, there is a brighter  gloss on it, and the speckling is more marked; but with a large series  of each I think the only perceptible difference would be its  greater breadth, which makes the egg look larger than that of the  Black-throated Jay. My four eggs measure 1.15 by 0.85 each.    \"This species only breeds once in a year, and from my observations  lays in April, all the young being hatched by the 15th May. Captain  Cock and myself carefully hunted up all the forests round Murree,  where the birds were constantly to be seen, commencing our work after  the 10th May, and we found nothing but young ones.\"    Colonel G.F.L. Marshall writes:--\"I have found nests of this species  for the first time this year; the first on the 22nd of May, by which  time, as all recorded evidence shows it to be an early breeder, I had  given up all hopes of getting eggs. The first nest contained two fresh  eggs; it was on a horizontal limb of a large oak, at a bifurcation  about eight feet from the trunk and about the same from the ground.  The nest was more substantial than that of _G. lanceolatus_, much more  moss having been used in the outer casing, but the lining was similar;  it was a misshapen nest, and appeared, in the distance, like an old  deserted one; the bird was sitting at the time; I took one egg, hoping  more would be laid, but the other was deserted and destroyed by  vermin. Another nest I found on the 2nd June; it contained three eggs  just so much incubated that it is probable no more would be laid; this  nest was much neater in construction and better concealed than the  former one; it was in a rhododendron tree, in a bend about ten feet  from the ground, between two branches upwards of a foot each in  diameter, and covered with moss and dead fern; the tree grew out of  a precipitous bank just below a road, and though the nest was on the  level of the edge it was almost impossible to detect it; it was a very  compact thick cup of roots covered with moss outside. The eggs were  larger, more elongated, and much"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13119"],[0,"Jean François Millet (#10)"],[1,"   \"God made the country, and man made the town.    What wonder, then, that health and virtue, gifts    That can alone make sweet the bitter draught    That life holds out to all, should most abound    And least be threatened in the fields and groves.\"[2]    A study of the lines of the picture will show the artistic beauty of  the composition. You may trace a long beautiful curve beginning at the  girl's finger tip and extending along the cord across the top of the  milk jar. Starting from the same point another good line follows the  arm and shoulder across the face and along the edge of the jar. At the  base of the composition we find corresponding lines which may be drawn  from the toe of the right foot. One follows the diagonal of the path  and the other runs along the edge of the lifted skirt.    There are other fine lines in the drawing of the bodice and the folds  of the skirt. Altogether they are as few in number and as strongly  emphasized, though not so grand, as those of the Sower.      [Footnote 1: The title of Water-Carrier has been incorrectly attached  to this picture, though the sketch on which it is based is properly  known as the Milkmaid.]    [Footnote 2: From Cowper's _Task_.]          XIV    THE WOMAN CHURNING      Again we are in the picturesque province of Normandy, and are shown  the interior of a dairy where a woman is busy churning. It is a  quaint place, with raftered ceiling and stone-paved floor, and the  furnishings are only such as are required by the work in hand. On some  wooden shelves against the farther wall are vessels of earthenware and  metal, to hold cream, cheese, butter, and the like. The churn is one  of the old-fashioned upright sort, not unlike those used in early New  England households, and large enough to contain a good many quarts of  cream. The woman stands beside it, grasping with both hands the handle  of the dasher, or plunger, which is worked up and down to keep the  cream in motion and so change it into butter.    In the beginning of the churning process the movement of the dasher  is slow, so that the cream may be thoroughly mixed. Then it goes more  rapidly for a time, till, just as the arms grow weary, the butter  begins to \"come,\" when the speed slackens to the end, the entire  process occupying thirty or forty minutes. The butter collects in  yellow lumps, which are at length taken from the churn, washed and  kneaded to press out the buttermilk, and then moulded into pats. The  pleasure of the finishing touches makes up for the fatiguing monotony  of the churning. George Eliot, in the novel of \"Adam Bede,\" gives a  charming description of Hetty Sorrel's butter-making, with all  the pretty attitudes and movements of patting and rolling the  sweet-scented butter into moulds.    We can hardly tell, from the attitude of the woman in our picture, how  far her work has progressed, but her expression of satisfaction seems  to show that the butter is \"coming\" well. The work of butter-making  varies curiously at different times. Sometimes the butter comes  quickly and easily, and again, only after long and laborious delays.  There seems, indeed, no rule about the process; it appears to be all  a matter of \"luck.\" Country people have always been very superstitious  in regard to it; and not understanding the true reasons for a  successful or an unsuccessful churning, they attribute any remarkable  effects to supernatural agencies.    In the old days of witchcraft superstitions, they used to think that  when the cream did not readily turn to butter, the churn had been  tampered with by some witch, like Mabel Martin's mother in Whittier's  poem. Witches were sometimes supposed to work a baleful charm on the  milk by putting under the doorsill some magical object, such as a  picture of a toad or a lizard.    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co. John Andrew  & Son, Sc. THE WOMAN CHURNING]    In Scotland, when churning was easy it was because of the secret help  of the \"brownie.\" He was a tiny, elf-like creature who lived in the  barn and was never seen of men; but his presence was made known by  his many deeds of helpfulness in kitchen and dairy, for which he  was rewarded by a daily bowl of milk. Those who have read George  MacDonald's story of Sir Gibbie remember how the little waif from  the city was mistaken for a brownie because he secretly helped in the  churning.    In France a pious class of peasants pray to St. Blaise for a blessing  on their various farm occupations, including the dairy work. A hymn  written to the saint contains this petition:--      \"In our dairies, curds and cream    And fair cheeses may we see:    Great St. Blaise, oh, grant our plea.\"[1]    Some such prayer as this may be running through the mind of the woman  in our picture. She has the earnest and simple character which belongs  to the Norman peasant. Hers is a kindly nature, too, and the cat rubs  familiarly against her as if sure of a friend who has often set a  saucer of milk in his way. With sleeves rolled up and skirts tucked  about her, she attacks her work in a strong, capable way which shows  that it is a pleasure. The light comes from some high window at the  left, and, gleaming on her arms, shows how firm and hard the flesh is.    We know that this is a Norman peasant woman from her tall cap. There  are many styles of caps peculiar to different parts of France, but  those worn in Normandy are remarkable for their height. When some of  the people of this province emigrated to the western continent and  settled in Acadia, the land of Evangeline, the women brought their  caps with them and continued to wear them many years, as we read in  Longfellow's \"Evangeline.\"    Our previous studies of the other pictures of this collection help us  to see at once the good points of composition in the Woman Churning.  The main lines of the group in the foreground form a tall pyramid. The  shape of the churn gives us the line at the right side, and the figure  of the cat carries the line of the woman's skirt into a corresponding  slant on the left. The lines of the tiled floor add to the pyramidal  effect by converging in perspective. Even the broom leaning against  the shelf near the door takes the same diagonal direction as the tiles  of the right side.    We have here also a new illustration of the art of treating inclosed  spaces.[2] An outlet is given to the room through the door opening  into the farmyard. Across the yard stands a low cow-shed, in which  a woman is seated milking a cow. This building, however, does not  altogether block up the view from the dairy door. Above the roof is a  strip of sky, and through a square window at the back is seen a bit of  the meadow.      [Footnote 1: From Ronsard's \"Hymn to St. Blaise,\" translated by Henry  Naegely in _J.F. Millet and Rustic Art_.]    [Footnote 2: See chapters ii. and vi.]          XV    THE MAN WITH THE HOE      To the peasant farmer every month of the year brings its own labors.  From seed time to harvest there is a constant succession of different  tasks, and hardly is the harvest gathered in before it is time to  prepare again for planting. Before ploughing can be begun the fields  must first be cleared of stubble and weeds. Now in Millet's village of  Barbizon, this clearing of the fields was done, in his day, by means  of an implement called in French a _houe_. Although we translate the  word as hoe, the tool is quite unlike the American article of that  name. It looks a little like a carpenter's adze, though much larger  and heavier, the blade being as broad as that of a shovel. The handle  is short and the implement is very clumsy and fatiguing to use. Even  the stoutest peasant finds the work wearisome.    The man in our picture has paused for a moment's rest in this toilsome  labor, and leans panting on his hoe. In the heat of his toil he has  thrown off his hat and blouse, which now lie together on the ground  behind him. His damp hair is matted together on his forehead, his  brawny chest is exposed by the open shirt, his horny hands are clasped  over the hoe handle. Some distant object catches his eye. It may be a  farm wagon moving across the plain, or perhaps a bird flying through  the clear air. To follow the course of such an object a moment is a  welcome change from the monotonous rise and fall of the hoe.    It is a rough and uneven field in which the laborer works, rising here  and there in small hillocks, and thickly overgrown with brambles and  coarse tufts of herbage. When these weeds are loosened from the soil,  they are raked in little heaps and burned. In the field just back of  this is a circle of these bonfires, sending up their columns of smoke  towards the sky. A young woman is busy raking together the piles. In  the distance she looks like a priestess of ancient times presiding  at some mystic rites of fire worship. Far beyond, a shapely tree is  outlined against the horizon.    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co. John Andrew  & Son, Sc. THE MAN WITH THE HOE]    To study this picture profitably, we must consider separately the  subject and the artistic qualities. These two elements in a work  of art are often confused, but are in reality quite distinct. Very  unpleasant subjects have sometimes been employed in pictures of great  artistic merit, and again beautiful subjects have sometimes been  treated very indifferently. When great art is united with a great  subject, we have ideal perfection; but poor art and a poor subject  together are intolerable. Now some people think only of the subject  when they look at a picture, and others, more critical, look only at  the qualities of art it contains. The best way of all is to try to  understand something of both.    In the first glance at this picture we do not find the subject very  attractive. The laborer is awkward, he is stupid looking, and he  is very weary. If we are to look at laborers, we like to"]]]
