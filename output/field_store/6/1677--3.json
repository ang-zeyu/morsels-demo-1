The Monera are but tiny bits of slimy,  jelly-like substances--mere specks of glue without organs of any kind,  and yet they exercise the organic phenomena of life, such as nutrition,  reproduction, sensation and movement, all of which are usually  associated with an organized structure. These creatures are incapable  of thought in themselves, and the phenomenon is due to the action of  the Will through them. This Instinctive impulse and action is seen  everywhere, manifesting upon Higher and still higher lines, as higher  forms of organisms are built up.    Scientists have used the term, \"Appetency,\" defining it as, \"the  instinctive tendency of living organisms to perform certain actions;  the tendency of an unorganized body to seek that which satisfies the  wants of its organism.\" Now what is this tendency? It cannot be an  effort of reason, for the low form of life has nothing with which to  reason. And it is impossible to think of \"purposive tendency\" without  assuming the existence of mental power of some kind. And where can such  a power be located if not in the form itself? When we consider that the  Will is acting in and through all forms of Life, from highest to  lowest--from Moneron to Man--we can at once recognize the source of the  power and activity. It is the Great Life Principle--the Creative Will,  manifesting itself.    We can perhaps better form an idea of the Creative Will, by reference  to its outward and visible forms of activity. We cannot see the Will  itself--the Pressure and the Urge--but we can see its action through  living forms. Just as we cannot see a man behind a curtain, and yet may  practically see him by watching the movements of his form as he presses  up against the curtain, so may we see the Will by watching it as it  presses up against the living curtain of the forms of life. There was a  play presented on the American stage a few years ago, in which one of  the scenes pictured the place of departed spirits according to the  Japanese belief. The audience could not see the actors representing the  spirits, but they could see their movements as they pressed up close to  a thin silky curtain stretched across the stage, and their motions as  they moved to and fro behind the curtain were plainly recognized. The  deception was perfect, and the effect was startling. One almost  believed that he saw the forms of formless creatures. And this is what  we may do in viewing the operation of the Creative Will--we may take a  look at the moving form of the Will behind the curtain of the forms of  the manifestation of life. We may see it pressing and urging here, and  bending there--building up here, and changing there--always acting,  always moving, striving, doing, in response to that insatiable urge and  craving, and longing of its inner desire. Let us take a few peeps at  the Will moving behind the curtain!    Commencing with the cases of the forming of the crystals, as spoken of  in our last lesson, we may pass on to plant life. But before doing so,  it may be well for us to take a parting look at the Will manifesting  crystal forms. One of the latest scientific works makes mention of the  experiments of a scientist who has been devoting much attention to the  formation of crystals, and reports that he has noticed that certain  crystals of organic compounds, instead of being built up symmetrically,  as is usual with crystals, were \"enation-morphic,\" that is, opposed to  each other, in rights and lefts, like hands or gloves, or shoes, etc.  These crystals are never found alone, but always form in pairs. Can you  not see the Will behind the curtain here?    Let us look for the Will in plant-life. Passing rapidly over the  wonderful evidences in the cases of the fertilization of plants by  insects, the plant shaping its blossom so as to admit the entrance of  the particular insect that acts as the carrier of its pollen, think for  a moment how the distribution of the seed is provided for. Fruit trees  and plants surround the seed with a sweet covering, that it may be  eaten by insect and animal, and the seed distributed. Others have a  hard covering to protect the seed or nut from the winter frosts, but  which covering rots with the spring rains and allows the germ to  sprout. Others surround the seed with a fleecy substance, so that the  wind may carry it here and there and give it a chance to find a home  where it is not so crowded. Another tree has a little pop-gun  arrangement, by means of which it pops its seed to a distance of  several feet.    Other plants have seeds that are covered with a burr or \"sticky\"  bristles, which enables them to attach themselves to the wool of sheep  and other animals, and thus be carried about and finally dropped in  some spot far away from the parent plant, and thus the scattering of  the species be accomplished. Some plants show the most wonderful plans  and arrangements for this scattering of the seed in new homes where  there is a better opportunity for growth and development, the  arrangements for this purpose displaying something very much akin to  what we would call \"ingenuity\" if it were the work of a reasoning mind.  There are plants called cockle-burs whose seed-pods are provided with  stickers in every direction, so that anything brushing against them is  sure to pick them up. At the end of each sticker is a very tiny hook,  and these hooks fasten themselves tightly into anything that brushes  against it, animal wool, hair, or clothing, etc. Some of these seeds  have been known to have been carried to other quarters of the globe in  wool, etc., there to find new homes and a wider field.    Other plants, like the thistle, provide their seed with downy wings, by  which the wind carries them afar to other fields. Other seeds have a  faculty of tumbling and rolling along the ground to great distances,  owing to their peculiar shape and formation. The maple provides its  seed with a peculiar arrangement something like a propeller screw,  which when the wind strikes the trees and looses the seed, whirls the  latter through the air to a distance of a hundred yards or more. Other  seeds are provided with floating apparatus, which enables them to  travel many miles by stream or river, or rain washes. Some of these not  only float, but actually swim, having spider-like filaments, which  wriggle like legs, and actually propel the tiny seed along to its new  home. A recent writer says of these seeds that \"so curiously lifelike  are their movements that it is almost impossible to believe that these  tiny objects, making good progress through the water, are really seeds,  and not insects.\"    The leaves of the Venus' Fly-trap fold upon each other and enclose the  insect which is attracted by the sweet juice on the leaf, three  extremely sensitive bristles or hairs giving the plant notice that the  insect is touching them. A recent writer gives the following  description of a peculiar plant. He says: \"On the shores of Lake  Nicaragua is to be found an uncanny product of the vegetable kingdom  known among the natives by the expressive name of 'the Devil's Noose.'  Dunstan, the naturalist, discovered it long ago while wandering on the  shores of the lake. Attracted by the cries of pain and terror from his  dog, he found the animal held by black sticky bands which had chafed  the skin to bleeding point. These bands were branches of a  newly-discovered carnivorous plant which had been aptly named the 'land  octopus.' The branches are flexible, black, polished and without  leaves, and secrete a viscid fluid.\"    You have seen flowers that closed when you touched them. You remember  the Golden Poppy that closes when the sun goes down. Another plant, a  variety of orchid, has a long, slender, flat stem, or tube, about  one-eighth of an inch thick, with an opening at the extreme end, and a  series of fine tubes where it joins the plant. Ordinarily this tube  remains coiled up into a spiral, but when the plant needs water (it  usually grows upon the trunks of trees overhanging swampy places) it  slowly uncoils the little tube and bends it over until it dips into the  water, when it proceeds to suck up the water until it is filled, when  it slowly coils around and discharges the water directly upon the  plant, or its roots. Then it repeats the process until the plant is  satisfied. When the water is absent from under the plant the tube moves  this way and that way until it finds what it wants--just like the trunk  of an elephant. If one touches the tube or trunk of the plant while it  is extended for water, it shows a great sensitiveness and rapidly coils  itself up. Now what causes this life action? The plant has no brains,  and cannot have reasoned out this process, nor even have acted upon  them by reasoning processes. It has nothing to think with to such a  high degree. It is the Will behind the curtain, moving this way and  that way, and doing things.    There was once a French scientist named Duhamel. He planted some beans  in a cylinder--something like a long tomato can lying on its side. He  waited until the beans began to sprout, and send forth roots downward,  and shoots upward, according to nature's invariable rule. Then he moved  the cylinder a little--rolled it over an inch or two. The next day he  rolled it over a little more. And so on each day, rolling it over a  little each time. Well, after a time Duhamel shook the dirt and growing  beans out of the cylinder, and what did he find? This, that the beans  in their endeavor to grow their roots downward had kept on bending each  day downward; and in their endeavor to send shoots upward, had kept on  bending upward a little each day, until at last there had been formed  two complete spirals--the one spiral being the roots ever turning  downward, and the other the shoots ever bending upward. How did the  plant know direction? What was the moving power. The Creative Will  behind the curtain again, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13444"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: The Science of Eugenics (#10)"],[1," not resent the  bitterness of flirtation. No lady or gentleman will flirt. Remember  ever that painful prediscovery is better than later disappointment.  Let such experience spur you to higher exertion.    18. Discretion should be exercised in introducing persons. Of two  gentlemen who are introduced, if one is superior in rank or age, he is  the one to whom the introduction should be made. Of two social equals,  if one be a stranger in the place his name should be mentioned first.    19. In general the simpler the introduction the better.    20. Before introducing a gentleman to a lady, remember that she is  entitled to hold you responsible for the acquaintance. The lady is the  one to whom the gentleman is presented, which may be done thus: \"Miss  A, permit me to introduce to you my friend, Mr. B.\"; or, \"Miss A.,  allow me to introduce Mr. B.\" If mutual and near friends of yours, say  simply, \"Miss A. Mr. B.\"    21. Receive the introduction with a slight bow and the acknowledgment,  \"Miss A., I am happy to make your acquaintance\"; or, \"Mr. B., I  am pleased to meet you.\" There is no reason why such stereotyped  expressions should always be used, but something similar is expected.  Do not extend the hand usually.    22. A true lady will avoid familiarity in her deportment towards  gentlemen. A young lady should not permit her gentlemen friends to  address her by her home name, and the reverse is true. Use the title  Miss and Mr. respectively.    23. Ladies should be frank and cordial towards their lady friends, but  never gushing.    24. Should you meet a friend twice or oftener, at short intervals, it  is polite to bow slightly each time after the first.    25. A lady on meeting a gentleman with whom she has slight  acquaintance will make a medium bow--neither too decided nor too  slight or stiff.    26. For a gentleman to take a young lady's arm, is to intimate that  she is feeble, and young ladies resent the mode.    27. If a young lady desires to visit any public place where she  expects to meet a gentleman acquaintance, she should have a chaperon  to accompany her, a person of mature years When possible, and never a  giddy girl.    28. A lady should not ask a gentleman to walk with her.    [Illustration]             *       *       *       *       *    A COMPLETE ETIQUETTE IN A FEW PRACTICAL RULES.      _1. If you desire to be respected, keep clean. The finest attire and  decorations will add nothing to the appearance or beauty of an untidy  person._    _2. Clean clothing, clean skin, clean hands, including the nails, and  clean, white teeth, are a requisite passport for good society._    _3. A bad breath should be carefully remedied, whether it proceeds  from the stomach or from decayed teeth._    _4. To pick the nose, finger about the ears, or scratch the head or  any other part of the person, in company, is decidedly vulgar._    _5. When you call at any private residence, do not neglect to clean  your shoes thoroughly._    _6. A gentleman should always remove his hat in the presence of  ladies, except out of doors, and then he should lift or touch his hat  in salutation. On meeting a lady a well-bred gentleman will always  lift his hat._    _7. An invitation to a lecture, concert, or other entertainment,  may be either verbal or written, but should always be made at least  twenty-four hours before the time._    _8. On entering a hall or church the gentleman should precede the lady  in walking up the aisle, or walk by her side, if the aisle is broad  enough._    _9. A gentleman should always precede a lady upstairs, and follow her  downstairs._    _10. Visitors should always observe the customs of the church with  reference to standing, sitting, or kneeling during the services._    _11. On leaving a hall or church at the close of entertainment or  services, the gentleman should precede the lady._    _12. A gentleman walking with a lady should carry the parcels, and  never allow the lady to be burdened with anything of the kind._    _13. A gentleman meeting a lady on the street and wishing to speak to  her, should never detain her, but may turn around and walk in the same  direction she is going, until the conversation is completed._    _14. If a lady is traveling with a gentleman, simply as a friend, she  should place the amount of her expenses in his hands, or insist on  paying the bills herself._    _15. Never offer a lady costly gifts unless you are engaged to her,  for it looks as if you were trying to purchase her good-will; and when  you make a present to a lady use no ceremony whatever._    _16. Never carry on a private conversation in company. If secrecy is  necessary, withdraw from the company._    _17. Never sit with your back to another without asking to be  excused._    _18. It is as unbecoming for a gentleman to sit with legs crossed as  it is for a lady._    _19. Never thrum with your fingers, rub your hands, yawn or sigh aloud  in company._    _20. Loud laughter, loud talking, or other boisterous manifestations  should be checked in the society of others, especially on the street  and in public places._    _21. When you are asked to sing or play in company, do so without  being urged, or refuse in a way that shall be final; and when music is  being rendered in company, show politeness to the musician by giving  attention. It is very impolite to keep up a conversation. If you do  not enjoy the music keep silent._    _22. Contentions, contradictions, etc. in society should be carefully  avoided._    _23. Pulling out your watch in company, unless asked the time of  day, is a mark of the demi-bred. It looks as if you were tired of the  company and the time dragged heavily._    _24. You should never decline to be introduced to any one or all of  the guests present at a party to which you have been invited._    _25. A gentleman who escorts a lady to a party, or who has a lady  placed under his care, is under particular obligations to attend to  her wants and see that she has proper attention. He should introduce  her to others, and endeavor to make the evening pleasant. He should  escort her to the supper table and provide for her wants._    _26. To take small children or dogs with you on a visit of ceremony is  altogether vulgar, though in visiting familiar friends, children are  not objectionable._    [Illustration: Children should early be taught the lesson of Propriety  and Good Manners.]    [Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN BRIDE'S WEDDING OUTFIT.]    [Illustration]             *       *       *       *       *    ETIQUETTE OF CALLS.      In the matter of making calls it is the correct thing:    For the caller who arrived first to leave first.    To return a first call within a week and in person.    To call promptly and in person after a first invitation.    For the mother or chaperon to invite a gentleman to call.    To call within a week after any entertainment to which one has been  invited.    You should call upon an acquaintance who has recently returned from a  prolonged absence.    It as proper to make the first call upon people in a higher social  position, if one is asked to do so.    It is proper to call, after an engagement has been announced, or a  marriage has taken place, in the family.    For the older residents in the city or street to call upon the  newcomers to their neighborhood is a long recognized custom.    It is proper, after a removal from one part of the city to another, to  send out cards with one's new address upon them.    To ascertain what are the prescribed hours for calling in the place  where one is living, or making a visit, and to adhere to those hours  is a duty that must not be overlooked.    A gentleman should ask for the lady of the house as well as the young  ladies, and leave cards for her as well as for the head of the family.
