VII    Michelangelo's good friend, Jacopo Gallo, was again helpful to him in  the last and greatest work which he produced during this Roman  residence. The Cardinal Jean de la Groslaye de Villiers Francois,  Abbot of S. Denys, and commonly called by Italians the Cardinal di San  Dionigi, wished to have a specimen of the young sculptor's handiwork.  Accordingly articles were drawn up to the following effect on August  26, 1498: \"Let it be known and manifest to whoso shall read the  ensuing document, that the most Rev. Cardinal of S. Dionigi has thus  agreed with the master Michelangelo, sculptor of Florence, to wit,  that the said master shall make a Pieta of marble at his own cost;  that is to say, a Virgin Mary clothed, with the dead Christ in her  arms, of the size of a proper man, for the price of 450 golden ducats  of the Papal mint, within the term of one year from the day of the  commencement of the work.\" Next follow clauses regarding the payment  of the money, whereby the Cardinal agrees to disburse sums in advance.  The contract concludes with a guarantee and surety given by Jacopo  Gallo. \"And I, Jacopo Gallo, pledge my word to his most Rev. Lordship  that the said Michelangelo will finish the said work within one year,  and that it shall be the finest work in marble which Rome to-day can  show, and that no master of our days shall be able to produce a  better. And, in like manner, on the other side, I pledge my word to  the said Michelangelo that the most Rev. Card. will disburse the  payments according to the articles above engrossed. To witness which,  I, Jacopo Gallo, have made this present writing with my own hand,  according to the date of year, month, and day as above.\"    The Pieta raised Michelangelo at once to the highest place among the  artists of his time, and it still remains unrivalled for the union of  sublime aesthetic beauty with profound religious feeling. The mother  of the dead Christ is seated on a stone at the foot of the cross,  supporting the body of her son upon her knees, gazing sadly at his  wounded side, and gently lifting her left hand, as though to say,  \"Behold and see!\" She has the small head and heroic torso used by  Michelangelo to suggest immense physical force. We feel that such a  woman has no difficulty in holding a man's corpse upon her ample lap  and in her powerful arms. Her face, which differs from the female type  he afterwards preferred, resembles that of a young woman. For this he  was rebuked by critics who thought that her age should correspond more  naturally to that of her adult son. Condivi reports that Michelangelo  explained his meaning in the following words: \"Do you not know that  chaste women maintain their freshness far longer than the unchaste?  How much more would this be the case with a virgin, into whose breast  there never crept the least lascivious desire which could affect the  body? Nay, I will go further, and hazard the belief that this  unsullied bloom of youth, besides being maintained in her by natural  causes, may have been miraculously wrought to convince the world of  the virginity and perpetual purity of the Mother. This was not  necessary for the Son. On the contrary, in order to prove that the Son  of God took upon himself, as in very truth he did take, a human body,  and became subject to all that an ordinary man is subject to, with the  exception of sin; the human nature of Christ, instead of being  superseded by the divine, was left to the operation of natural laws,  so that his person revealed the exact age to which he had attained.  You need not, therefore, marvel if, having regard to these  considerations, I made the most Holy Virgin, Mother of God, much  younger relatively to her Son than women of her years usually appear,  and left the Son such as his time of life demanded.\" \"This reasoning,\"  adds Condivi, \"was worthy of some learned theologian, and would have  been little short of marvellous in most men, but not in him, whom God  and Nature fashioned, not merely to be peerless in his handiwork, but  also capable of the divinest concepts, as innumerable discourses and  writings which we have of his make clearly manifest.\"    The Christ is also somewhat youthful, and modelled with the utmost  delicacy; suggesting no lack of strength, but subordinating the idea  of physical power to that of a refined and spiritual nature. Nothing  can be more lovely than the hands, the feet, the arms, relaxed in  slumber. Death becomes immortally beautiful in that recumbent figure,  from which the insults of the scourge, the cross, the brutal lance  have been erased. Michelangelo did not seek to excite pity or to stir  devotion by having recourse to those mediaeval ideas which were so  passionately expressed in S. Bernard's hymn to the Crucified. The  aesthetic tone of his dead Christ is rather that of some sweet solemn  strain of cathedral music, some motive from a mass of Palestrina or a  Passion of Sebastian Bach. Almost involuntarily there rises to the  memory that line composed by Bion for the genius of earthly loveliness  bewailed by everlasting beauty--      _E'en as a corpse he is fair, fair corpse as fallen aslumber._    It is said that certain Lombards passing by and admiring the Pieta  ascribed it to Christoforo Solari of Milan, surnamed Il Gobbo.  Michelangelo, having happened to overhear them, shut himself up in the  chapel, and engraved the belt upon the Madonna's breast with his own  name. This he never did with any other of his works.    This masterpiece of highest art combined with pure religious feeling  was placed in the old Basilica of S. Peter's, in a chapel dedicated to  Our Lady of the Fever, Madonna della Febbre. Here, on the night of  August 19, 1503, it witnessed one of those horrid spectacles which in  Italy at that period so often intervened to interrupt the rhythm of  romance and beauty and artistic melody. The dead body of Roderigo  Borgia, Alexander VI., lay in state from noon onwards in front of the  high altar; but since \"it was the most repulsive, monstrous, and  deformed corpse which had ever yet been seen, without any form or  figure of humanity, shame compelled them to partly cover it.\" \"Late in  the evening it was transferred to the chapel of Our Lady of the Fever,  and deposited in a corner by six hinds or porters and two carpenters,  who had made the coffin too narrow and too short. Joking and jeering,  they stripped the tiara and the robes of office from the body, wrapped  it up in an old carpet, and then with force of fists and feet rammed  it down into the box, without torches, without a ministering priest,  without a single person to attend and bear a consecrated candle.\" Of  such sort was the vigil kept by this solemn statue, so dignified in  grief and sweet in death, at the ignoble obsequies of him who,  occupying the loftiest throne of Christendom, incarnated the least  erected spirit of his age. The ivory-smooth white corpse of Christ in  marble, set over against that festering corpse of his Vicar on earth,  \"black as a piece of cloth or the blackest mulberry,\" what a hideous  contrast!      VIII    It may not be inappropriate to discuss the question of the Bruges  Madonna here. This is a marble statue, well placed in a chapel of  Notre Dame, relieved against a black marble niche, with excellent  illumination from the side. The style is undoubtedly Michelangelesque,  the execution careful, the surface-finish exquisite, and the type of  the Madonna extremely similar to that of the Pieta at S. Peter's. She  is seated in an attitude of almost haughty dignity, with the left foot  raised upon a block of stone. The expression of her features is marked  by something of sternness, which seems inherent in the model. Between  her knees stands, half reclining, half as though wishing to step  downwards from the throne, her infant Son. One arm rests upon his  mother's knee; the right hand is thrown round to clasp her left. This  attitude gives grace of rhythm to the lines of his nude body. True to  the realism which controlled Michelangelo at the commencement of his  art career, the head of Christ, who is but a child, slightly overloads  his slender figure. Physically he resembles the Infant Christ of our  National Gallery picture, but has more of charm and sweetness. All  these indications point to a genuine product of Michelangelo's first  Roman manner; and the position of the statue in a chapel ornamented by  the Bruges family of Mouscron renders the attribution almost certain.  However, we have only two authentic records of the work among the  documents at our disposal. Condivi, describing the period of  Michelangelo's residence in Florence (1501-1504), says: \"He also cast  in bronze a Madonna with the Infant Christ, which certain Flemish  merchants of the house of Mouscron, a most noble family in their own  land, bought for two hundred ducats, and sent to Flanders.\" A letter  addressed under date August 4, 1506, by Giovanni Balducci in Rome to  Michelangelo at Florence, proves that some statue which was destined  for Flanders remained among the sculptor's property at Florence.  Balducci uses the feminine gender in writing about this work, which  justifies us in thinking that it may have been a Madonna. He says that  he has found a trustworthy agent to convey it to Viareggio, and to  ship it thence to Bruges, where it will be delivered into the hands of  the heir of John and Alexander Mouscron and Co., \"as being their  property.\" This statue, in all probability, is the \"Madonna in marble\"  about which Michelangelo wrote to his father from Rome on the 31st of  January 1507, and which he begged his father to keep hidden in their  dwelling. It is difficult to reconcile Condivi's statement with  Balducci's letter. The former says that the Madonna bought by the  Mouscron family was cast in bronze at Florence.

He couldn't have got through the house without being seen, and  there was no other way--let alone the evidence of the unbolted gate.  Therefore, as the footprints ceased where they did, and were not repeated  anywhere in the lane, I knew that he had taken his spiked shoes  off--probably changed them for something else, because a runner anxious as  to his chances would never risk walking on bare feet, with a chance of  cutting them. Ordinary, broad, smooth-soled slippers would leave no  impression on the coarse cinders bordering the track, and nothing short of  spiked shoes would leave a mark on the hard path in the lane behind. The  spike-tracks were leading, not directly toward the door, but in the  direction of the fence, when they stopped; somebody had handed, or thrown,  the slippers over the fence, and he had changed them on the spot. The  enemy had calculated upon the spikes leaving a track in the lane that  might lead us in our search, and had arranged accordingly.    \"So far so good. I could see no footprints near the gate in the lane. You  will remember that I sent Steggles off to watch at the Cop before I went  out to the back--merely, of course, to get him out of the way. I went out  into the lane, leaving you behind, and walked its whole length, first  toward the Old Kilns and then back toward the road. I found nothing to  help me except these small pieces of paper--which are here in my  pocket-book, by the by. Of course this 'mmy' might have meant 'Jimmy' or  'Tommy' as possibly as 'Sammy,' but they were not to be rejected on that  account. Certainly Crockett had been decoyed out of your ground, not taken  by force, or there would have been marks of a scuffle in the cinders. And  as his request for a sweater was probably an excuse--because it was not at  all a cold afternoon--he must have previously designed going out.  Inference, a letter received; and here were pieces of a letter. Now, in  the light of what I have said, look at these pieces. First, there is the  'mmy'--that I have dealt with. Then see this 'throw them ov'--clearly a  part of 'throw them over'; exactly what had probably been done with the  slippers. Then the 'poor f,' coming just on the line before, and seen, by  joining up with this other piece, might easily be a reference to 'poor  feet.' These coincidences, one on the other, went far to establish the  identity of the letter, and to confirm my previous impressions. But then  there is something else. Two other pieces evidently mean 'left him,' and  'right away,' perhaps; but there is another, containing almost all of the  words 'hate his,' with the word 'hate' underlined. Now, who writes 'hate'  with the emphasis of underscoring--who but a woman? The writing is large  and not very regular; it might easily be that of a half-educated woman.  Here was something more--Sammy had been enticed away by a woman.    \"Now, I remembered that, when we went into the tap-room on Wednesday, some  of his companions were chaffing Crockett about a certain Nancy Webb, and  the chaff went home, as was plain to see. The woman, then, who could most  easily entice Sammy Crockett away was Nancy Webb. I resolved to find who  Nancy Webb was and learn more of her.    \"Meantime, I took a look at the road at the end of the lane. It was damper  than the lane, being lower, and overhung by trees. There were many  wheel-tracks, but only one set that turned in the road and went back the  way it came, toward the town; and they were narrow wheels--carriage  wheels. Crockett tells me now that they drove him about for a long time  before shutting him up; probably the inconvenience of taking him straight  to the hiding-place didn't strike them when they first drove off.    \"A few inquiries soon set me in the direction of the Plough and Miss Nancy  Webb. I had the curiosity to look around the place as I approached, and  there, in the garden behind the house, were Steggles and the young lady in  earnest confabulation!    \"Every conjecture became a certainty. Steggles was the lover of whom  Crockett was jealous, and he had employed the girl to bring Sammy out. I  watched Steggles home, and gave you a hint to keep him there.    \"But the thing that remained was to find Steggles' employer in this  business. I was glad to be in when Danby called. He came, of course, to  hear if you would blurt out anything, and to learn, if possible, what  steps you were taking. He failed. By way of making assurance doubly sure I  took a short walk this morning in the character of a deaf gentleman, and  got Miss Webb to write me a direction that comprised three of the words on  these scraps of paper--'left,' 'right,' and 'lane'; see, they correspond,  the peculiar 'f's,' 't's,' and all.    \"Now, I felt perfectly sure that Steggles would go for his pay to-day. In  the first place, I knew that people mixed up with shady transactions in  professional pedestrianism are not apt to trust one another far--they know  better. Therefore Steggles wouldn't have had his bribe first. But he would  take care to get it before the Saturday heats were run, because once they  were over the thing was done, and the principal conspirator might have  refused to pay up, and Steggles couldn't have helped himself. Again I  hinted he should not go out till I could follow him, and this afternoon,  when he went, follow him I did. I saw him go into Danby's house by the  side way and come away again. Danby it was, then, who had arranged the  business; and nobody was more likely, considering his large pecuniary  stake against Crockett's winning this race.    \"But now how to find Crockett? I made up my mind he wouldn't be in Danby's  own house. That would be a deal too risky, with servants about and so on.  I saw that Danby was a builder, and had three shops to let--it was on a  paper before his house. What more likely prison than an empty house? I  knocked at Danby's door and asked for the keys of those shops. I couldn't  have them. The servant told me Danby was out (a manifest lie, for I had  just seen him), and that nobody could see the shops till Monday. But I got  out of her the address of the shops, and that was all I wanted at the  time.    \"Now, why was nobody to see those shops till Monday? The interval was  suspicious--just enough to enable Crockett to be sent away again and cast  loose after the Saturday racing, supposing him to be kept in one of the  empty buildings. I went off at once and looked at the shops, forming my  conclusions as to which would be the most likely for Danby's purpose. Here  I had another confirmation of my ideas. A poor, half-bankrupt baker in one  of the shops had, by the bills, the custody of a set of keys; but he, too,  told me I couldn't have them; Danby had taken them away--and on Thursday,  the very day--with some trivial excuse, and hadn't brought them back. That  was all I wanted or could expect in the way of guidance. The whole thing  was plain. The rest you know all about.\"    \"Well, you're certainly as smart as they give you credit for, I must say.  But suppose Danby had taken down his 'To Let' notice, what would you have  done, then?\"    \"We had our course, even then. We should have gone to Danby, astounded him  by telling him all about his little games, terrorized him with threats of  the law, and made him throw up his hand and send Crockett back. But, as it  is, you see, he doesn't know at this moment--probably won't know till  to-morrow afternoon--that the lad is safe and sound here. You will  probably use the interval to make him pay for losing the game--by some of  the ingenious financial devices you are no doubt familiar with.\"    \"Ay, that I will. He'll give any price against Crockett now, so long as  the bet don't come direct from me.\"    \"But about Crockett, now,\" Hewitt went on. \"Won't this confinement be  likely to have damaged his speed for a day or two?\"    \"Ah, perhaps,\" the landlord replied; \"but, bless ye, that won't matter.  There's four more in his heat to-morrow. Two I know aren't tryers, and the  other two I can hold in at a couple of quid apiece any day. The third  round and final won't be till to-morrow week, and he'll be as fit as ever  by then. It's as safe as ever it was. How much are you going to have on?  I'll lump it on for you safe enough. This is a chance not to be missed;  it's picking money up.\"    \"Thank you; I don't think I'll have anything to do with it. This  professional pedestrian business doesn't seem a pretty one at all. I don't  call myself a moralist, but, if you'll excuse my saying so, the thing is  scarcely the game I care to pick tap money at in any way.\"    \"Oh, very well! if you think so, I won't persuade ye, though I don't think  so much of your smartness as I did, after that. Still, we won't quarrel;  you've done me a mighty good turn, that I must say, and I only feel I  aren't level without doing something to pay the debt. Come, now, you've  got your trade as I've got mine. Let me have the bill, and I'll pay it  like a lord, and feel a deal more pleased than if you made a favor of  it--not that I'm above a favor, of course. But I'd prefer paying, and  that's a fact.\"    \"My dear sir, you have paid,\" Hewitt said, with a smile. \"You paid in  advance. It was a bargain, wasn't it, that I should do your business if  you would help me in mine? Very well; a bargain's a bargain, and we've  both performed our parts. And you mustn't be offended at what I said just  now.\"    \"That I won't! But as to that Raggy Steggles, once those heats are over  to-morrow, I'll--well----\"    It was on the following Sunday week that Martin Hewitt, in his rooms in  London, turned over his paper and read, under the head \"Padfield Annual  135 Yards Handicap,\" this announcement: \"Final heat: Crockett, first;  Willis, second; Trewby, third; Owen, 0; Howell, 0. A runaway win by nearly  three yards.\"          "]]]
