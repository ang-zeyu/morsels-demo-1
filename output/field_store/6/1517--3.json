TENTH EDITION, WITH IMPROVEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS.      1840.          PREFACE    The success of her little book entitled \"Seventy-five Receipts in  Cakes, Pastry, and Sweetmeats.\" has encouraged the author to  attempt a larger and more miscellaneous work on the subject of  cookery, comprising as far as practicable whatever is most useful  in its various departments; and particularly adapted to the  domestic economy of her own country. Designing it as a manual of  American housewifery, she has avoided the insertion of any dishes  whose ingredients cannot be procured on our side of the Atlantic,  and which require for their preparation utensils that are rarely  found except in Europe. Also, she has omitted every thing which  may not, by the generality of tastes, be considered good of its  kind, and well worth the trouble and cost of preparing.    The author has spared no pains in collecting and arranging,  perhaps the greatest number of practical and original receipts  that have ever appeared in a similar work; flattering herself that  she has rendered them so explicit as to be easily understood, and  followed, even by inexperienced cooks. The directions are given as  minutely as if each receipt was \"to stand alone by itself,\" all  references to others being avoided; except in some few instances  to the one immediately preceding; it being a just cause of  complaint that in some of the late cookery books, the reader,  before finishing the article, is desired to search out pages and  numbers in remote parts of the volume.    In the hope that her system of cookery may be consulted with equal  advantage by families in town and in country, by those whose  condition makes it expedient to practise economy, and by others  whose circumstances authorize a liberal expenditure, the author  sends it to take its chance among the multitude of similar  publications, satisfied that it will meet with as much success as  it may be found to deserve,--more she has no right to expect.    _Philadelphia, April 15th, 1837_.          INTRODUCTORY HINTS.      WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.    We recommend to all families that they should keep in the house: a  pair of scales, (one of the scales deep enough to hold flour,  sugar, &c., conveniently,) and a set of tin measures: as accuracy  in proportioning the ingredients is indispensable to success in  cookery. It is best to have the scales permanently fixed to a  small beam projecting (for instance) from one of the shelves of  the store-room. This will preclude the frequent inconvenience of  their getting twisted, unlinked, and otherwise out of order; a  common consequence of putting them in and out of their box, and  carrying them from place to place. The weights (of which there  should be a set from two pounds to a quarter of an ounce) ought  carefully to be kept in the box, that none of them may be lost or  mislaid.    A set of tin measures (with small spouts or lips) from a gallon  down to half a jill, will be found very convenient in every  kitchen; though common pitchers, bowls, glasses, &c. may be  substituted. It is also well to have a set of wooden measures from  a bushel to a quarter of a peck.      Let it be remembered, that of liquid measure--    Two jills are half a pint.  Two pints--one quart.  Four quarts--one gallon.    Of dry measure--    Half a gallon is a quarter of a peck.    One gallon--half a peck.  Two gallons--one peck.  Four gallons--half a bushel.  Eight gallons--one bushel.    About twenty-five drops of any thin liquid will fill a common  sized tea-spoon.    Four table-spoonfuls or half a jill, will fill a common wine  glass.    Four wine glasses will fill a half-pint or common tumbler, or a  large coffee-cup.    A quart black bottle holds in reality about a pint and a half.    Of flour, butter, sugar, and most articles used in cakes and  pastry, a quart is generally about equal in quantity to a pound  avoirdupois, (sixteen ounces.) Avoirdupois is the weight  designated throughout this book.    Ten eggs generally weigh one pound before they are broken.    A table-spoonful of salt is generally about one ounce.

GENERAL REMARKS.    Always use soft water for making soup, and be careful to  proportion the quantity of water to that of the meat. Somewhat  less than a quart of water to a pound of meat, is a good rule for  common soups. Rich soups, intended for company, may have a still  smaller allowance of water.    Soup should always be made entirely of fresh meat that has not  been previously cooked. An exception to this rule may sometimes be  made in favour of the remains of a piece of roast beef that has  been _very much_ under-done in roasting. This may be  _added_ to a good piece of raw meat. Cold ham, also, may be  occasionally put into white soups.    Soup made of cold meat has always a vapid, disagreeable taste,  very perceptible through all the seasoning, and which nothing  indeed can disguise. Also, it will be of a bad, dingy colour. The  juices of the meat having been exhausted by the first cooking, the  undue proportion of watery liquid renders it, for soup,  indigestible and unwholesome, as well as unpalatable. As there is  little or no nutriment to be derived from soup made with cold  meat, it is better to refrain from using it for this purpose, and  to devote the leavings of the table to some other object. No  person accustomed to really good soup, made from fresh meat, can  ever be deceived in the taste, even when flavoured with wine and  spices. It is not true that French cooks have the art of producing  _excellent_ soups from cold scraps. There is much _bad_  soup to be found in France, at inferior houses; but _good_  French cooks are not, as is generally supposed, really in the  practice of concocting any dishes out of the refuse of the table.  And we repeat, that cold meat, even when perfectly good, and used  in a large quantity, has not sufficient substance to flavour soup,  or to render it wholesome.    Soup, however, that has been originally made of raw meat entirely,  is frequently better the second day than the first; provided that  it is re-boiled only for a very short time, and that no additional  water is added to it.    Unless it has been allowed to boil too hard, so as to exhaust the  water, the soup-pot will not require replenishing. When it is  found absolutely necessary to do so, the additional water must be  boiling hot when poured in; if lukewarm or cold, it will entirely  spoil the soup.    Every particle of fat should be carefully skimmed from the  surface. Greasy soup is disgusting and unwholesome. The lean of  meat is much better for soup than the fat.    Long and slow boiling is necessary to extract the strength from  the meat. If boiled fast over a large fire, the meat becomes hard  and tough, and will not give out its juices.    Potatoes, if boiled in the soup, are thought by some to render it  unwholesome, from the opinion that the water in which potatoes  have been cooked is almost a poison. As potatoes are a part of  every dinner, it is very easy to take a few out of the pot in  which they have been boiled by themselves, and to cut them up and  add them to the soup just before it goes to table.    The cook should season the soup but very slightly with salt and  pepper. If she puts in too much, it may spoil it for the taste of  most of those that are to eat it; but if too little, it is easy to  add more to your own plate.    The practice of thickening soup by stirring flour into it is not a  good one, as it spoils both the appearance and the taste. If made  with a sufficient quantity of good fresh meat, and not too much  water, and if boiled long and slowly, it will have substance  enough without flour.      FAMILY SOUP.    Take a shin or leg of beef that has been newly killed; the fore  leg is best, as there is the most meat on it. Have it cut into  three pieces, and wash it well. To each pound allow somewhat less  than a quart of water; for instance, to ten pounds of leg of beef,  nine quarts of water is a good proportion. Put it into a large  pot, and add half a table-spoonful of salt. Hang it over a good  fire, as early as six o'clock in the morning, if you dine at two.  When it has come to a hard boil, and the scum has risen, (which it  will do as soon as it has boiled,) skim it well. Do not remove the  lid more frequently than is absolutely necessary, as uncovering  the pot causes the flavour to evaporate. Then set it on hot coals  in the corner, and keep it simmering steadily, adding fresh coals  so as to continue a regular heat.    About nine o'clock, put in four carrots, one parsnip, and a large  onion cut into slices, and four small turnips, and eight tomatas,  also cut up; add a head of celery cut small. Put in a very small  head of cabbage, cut into little pieces.

FOREWORD: TO BOYS AND GIRLS    Do you like to dig for hidden treasure? Have you ever found Indian  arrowheads or Indian pottery? I knew a boy who was digging a cave in  a sandy place, and he found an Indian grave. With his own hands he  uncovered the bones and skull of some brave warrior. That brown skull  was more precious to him than a mint of money. Another boy I knew was  making a cave of his own. Suddenly he dug into an older one made years  before. He crawled into it with a leaping heart and began to explore. He  found an old carpet and a bit of burned candle. They proved that some  one had lived there. What kind of a man had he been and what kind  of life had he lived--black or white or red, robber or beggar or  adventurer? Some of us were walking in the woods one day when we saw a  bone sticking out of the ground. Luckily we had a spade, and we set to  work digging. Not one moment was the tool idle. First one bone and then  another came to light and among them a perfect horse's skull. We felt as  though we had rescued Captain Kidd's treasure, and we went home draped  in bones.    Suppose that instead of finding the bones of a horse we had uncovered a  gold-wrapped king. Suppose that instead of a deserted cave that boy  had dug into a whole buried city with theaters and mills and shops and  beautiful houses. Suppose that instead of picking up an Indian arrowhead  you could find old golden vases and crowns and bronze swords lying in  the earth. If you could be a digger and a finder and could choose your  find, would you choose a marble statue or a buried bakeshop with bread  two thousand years old still in the oven or a king's grave filled with  golden gifts? It is of such digging and such finding that this book  tells.        CONTENTS      FOREWORD: To BOYS AND GIRLS        POMPEII      1. The Greek Slave and the Little Roman Boy      2. Vesuvius      3.

These lamps gave a  dim and smoky light.]          THE GREEK SLATE AND THE LITTLE ROMAN BOY    Ariston, the Greek slave, was busily painting. He stood in a little room  with three smooth walls. The fourth side was open upon a court. A little  fountain splashed there. Above stretched the brilliant sky of Italy. The  August sun shone hotly down. It cut sharp shadows of the columns on the  cement floor. This was the master's room. The artist was painting the  walls. Two were already gay with pictures. They showed the mighty deeds  of warlike Herakles. Here was Herakles strangling the lion, Herakles  killing the hideous hydra, Herakles carrying the wild boar on his  shoulders, Herakles training the mad horses. But now the boy was  painting the best deed of all--Herakles saving Alcestis from death. He  had made the hero big and beautiful. The strong muscles lay smooth in  the great body. One hand trailed the club. On the other arm hung the  famous lion skin. With that hand the god led Alcestis. He turned his  head toward her and smiled. On the ground lay Death, bruised and  bleeding. One batlike black wing hung broken. He scowled after the hero  and the woman. In the sky above him stood Apollo, the lord of life,  looking down. But the picture of the god was only half finished. The  figure was sketched in outline. Ariston was rapidly laying on paint with  his little brushes. His eyes glowed with Apollo's own fire. His lips  were open, and his breath came through them pantingly.    \"O god of beauty, god of Hellas, god of freedom, help me!\" he half  whispered while his brush worked.    For he had a great plan in his mind. Here he was, a slave in this rich  Roman's house. Yet he was a free-born son of Athens, from a family of  painters. Pirates had brought him here to Pompeii, and had sold him as a  slave. His artist's skill had helped him, even in this cruel land. For  his master, Tetreius, loved beauty. The Roman had soon found that his  young Greek slave was a painter. He had said to his steward:    \"Let this boy work at the mill no longer. He shall paint the walls of my  private room.\"    So he had talked to Ariston about what the pictures should be. The Greek  had found that this solemn, frowning Roman was really a kind man. Then  hope had sprung up in his breast and had sung of freedom.    \"I will do my best to please him,\" he had thought. \"When all the walls  are beautiful, perhaps he will smile at my work. Then I will clasp his  knees. I will tell him of my father, of Athens, of how I was stolen.  Perhaps he will send me home.\"    Now the painting was almost done. As he worked, a thousand pictures were  flashing through his mind. He saw his beloved old home in lovely Athens.  He felt his father's hand on his, teaching him to paint. He gazed again  at the Parthenon, more beautiful than a dream. Then he saw himself  playing on the fishing boat on that terrible holiday. He saw the pirate  ship sail swiftly from behind a rocky point and pounce upon them. He saw  himself and his friends dragged aboard. He felt the tight rope on his  wrists as they bound him and threw him under the deck. He saw himself  standing here in the market place of Pompeii. He heard himself sold for  a slave. At that thought he threw down his brush and groaned.    But soon he grew calmer. Perhaps the sweet drip of the fountain cooled  his hot thoughts. Perhaps the soft touch of the sun soothed his heart.  He took up his brushes again and set to work.    \"The last figure shall be the most beautiful of all,\" he said to  himself. \"It is my own god, Apollo.\"    So he worked tenderly on the face. With a few little strokes he made the  mouth smile kindly. He made the blue eyes deep and gentle. He lifted the  golden curls with a little breeze from Olympos. The god's smile cheered  him. The beautiful colors filled his mind. He forgot his sorrows. He  forgot everything but his picture. Minute by minute it grew under his  moving brush. He smiled into the god's eyes.    Meantime a great noise arose in the house. There were cries of fear.  There was running of feet.    \"A great cloud!\" \"Earthquake!\" \"Fire and hail!\" \"Smoke from hell!\" \"The  end of the world!\" \"Run! Run!\"    And men and women, all slaves, ran screaming through the house and out  of the front door. But the painter only half heard the cries. His ears,  his eyes, his thoughts were full of Apollo.    For a little the house was still. Only the fountain and the shadows and  the artist's brush moved there. Then came a great noise as though the  sky had split open. The low, sturdy house trembled. Ariston's brush was  shaken and blotted Apollo's eye. Then there was a clattering on the  cement floor as of a million arrows. Ariston ran into the court. From  the heavens showered a hail of gray, soft little pebbles like beans.  They burned his upturned face. They stung his bare arms. He gave a cry  and ran back under the porch roof. Then he heard a shrill call above all  the clattering. It came from the far end of the house. Ariston ran back  into the private court. There lay Caius, his master's little sick son.  His couch was under the open sky, and the gray hail was pelting down  upon him. He was covering his head with his arms and wailing.    \"Little master!\" called Ariston. \"What is it? What has happened to us?\"  \"Oh, take me!\" cried the little boy.    \"Where are the others?\" asked Ariston.    \"They ran away,\" answered Caius. \"They were afraid, Look! O-o-h!\"    He pointed to the sky and screamed with terror.    Ariston looked. Behind the city lay a beautiful hill, green with trees.  But now from the flat top towered a huge, black cloud. It rose straight"]]]
