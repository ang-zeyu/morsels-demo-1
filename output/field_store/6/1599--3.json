Mr. John Darlington, of England, gives the following particulars of a  modern air compressor of European type:    \"Engine, two vertical cylinders, steam jacketed, with Meyer's expansion  gear. Cylinders, 16.9 inches diameter, stroke 39.4 inches; compressor,  two cylinders, diameter of piston, 23.0 inches; stroke 39.4 inches;  revolutions per minute, 30 to 40; piston speed 39 to 52 inches per  second, capacity of cylinder per revolution, 20 cubic feet: diameter of  valves, viz., four inlet and four outlet, 51/2 inches; weight of each  inlet valve, 8 lb.; outlet, 10 lb.; pressure of air, 4 to 5 atmospheres.  The diagrams taken of the engine and compressor show that the work  expended in compressing one cubic meter of air to 4.21 effective  atmospheres was 38,128 lb. According to Boyle and Mariotte's law it  would be 37,534 lb., the difference being 594 lb., or a loss of 1.6 per  cent. Or if compressed without abstraction of heat, the work expended  would in that case have been 48,158. The volume of air compressed per  revolution was 0.5654 cubic meter. For obtaining this measure of  compressed air, the work expended was 21,557 pounds. The work done in  the steam cylinders, from indicator diagrams, is shown to have been  25,205 pounds, the useful effect being 851/2 per cent. of the power  expended. The temperature of air on entering the cylinder was 50 degrees  Fah., on leaving 62 degrees Fah., or an increase of 12 degrees Fah.  Without the water jacket and water injection for cooling the temperature  it would have been 302 degrees Fah. The water injected into the  cylinders per revolution was 0.81 gallon.\"    We have in the foregoing a remarkable isothermal result. The heat of  compression is so thoroughly absorbed that the thermal loss is only 1.6  per cent.; but the loss _by friction of the engine_ is 14.5 per cent.,  and the net economy of the whole system is no greater than that of the  best American dry compressor, which loses about one-half the theoretical  loss due to heat of compression, but which makes up the difference by a  low friction loss.    The wet compressor of the second class is the water piston compressor,  Fig. 18.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--HYDRAULIC AIR COMPRESSOR.]    The illustration shows the general type of this compressor, though it  has been subject to much modification in different places. In America, a  plunger is used instead of a piston, and as it always moves in water the  result is more satisfactory. The piston, or plunger, moves horizontally  in the lower part of a U shaped cylinder. Water at all times surrounds  the piston, and fills alternately the upper chambers. The free air is  admitted through a valve on the side of each column and is discharged  through the top. The movement of the piston causes the water to rise on  one side and fall on the other. As the water falls the space is occupied  by free air, which is compressed when the motion of the piston is  reversed, and the water column raised. The discharge valve is so  proportioned that some of the water is carried out after the air has  been discharged. Hence there are no clearance losses.    This hydraulic compressor seems to have a certain charm about it, which  has resulted in its adoption in Germany, France and Belgium, and by one  of the largest mines in the United States. Its advantages are _purely  theoretical_, and without certain adjuncts which have been in some cases  applied to it, even the _theory_ is a very bad one.    The chief claim for this water piston compressor is that its piston is  also its cooling device, and that the heat of compression is absorbed by  the water. So much confidence seems to be placed in the isothermal  features of this machine that usually no water jacket or spray pump is  applied. Mr. Darlington, who is one of the stanch defenders of this  class of compressors, has found it necessary to introduce \"spray jets of  water immediately under the outlet valves,\" the object of which is to  absorb a larger amount of heat than would otherwise be effected by the  simple contact of the air with the water-compressing column. Without  such spray connections, it is safe to say that this compressor has  scarcely any cooling advantages at all, so far as air cooling is  concerned. Water is not a good conductor of heat. In this case only one  side of a large body of air is exposed to a water surface, and as water  is a bad conductor, the result is that a thin film of water gets hot in  the early stage of the stroke and little or no cooling takes place  thereafter. The compressed air is doubtless cooled before it gets even  as far as the receiver, because so much water is tumbled over into the  pipes with it, but to produce economical results the cooling should take  place _during compression_.    Water and cast iron have about the same relative capacity for heat at  equal volumes. In this water piston compressor we have only one cooling  surface, which soon gets hot, while with a dry compressor, with water  jacketed cylinders and heads, there are several cold metallic surfaces  exposed on one side to the heat of compression, and on the other to a  moving body of cold water.    But the water piston fraternity promptly brings forward the question of  speed. They say that, admitting that the cooling surfaces are equal, we  have in one case _more time_ to absorb the heat than in the other. This  is true, and here we come to an important class division in air  compressing machinery--_high speed and short stroke_ as against _slow  speed and long stroke_. Hydraulic piston compressors are subject to the  laws that govern piston pumps, and are, therefore, limited to a piston  speed of about 100 feet per minute. It is quite out of the question to  run them at much higher speed than this without shock to the engine and  fluctuations of air pressure due to agitation of the water piston. The  quantity of heat produced, that is, the degree of temperature reached,  depends entirely upon the conditions in the air itself, as to density,  temperature and moisture, and is entirely independent of speed. We have  seen that it is possible to lose 21.3 per cent. of work when compressing  air to five atmospheres without any cooling arrangements. With the best  compressors of the dry system one-half of this loss is saved by water  jacket absorption, so that we are left with about 11 per cent., which  the slow moving compressor seeks to erase. We are quite safe in saying  that the element of _time alone_ in the stroke of an air compressor  could not possibly effect a saving of more than half of this, or 51/2 per  cent. Now, in order to get this 51/2 per cent. saving, we reduce the speed  of an air-compressing engine from 350 feet per minute to 100 feet per  minute. We must, therefore, in one case have a piston area _three and  one-half_ times that of the other in order to get the _same capacity of  air_, and in doing this we build an engine of enormous proportions with  heavy moving parts. We load it down with a large mass of water, which it  must move back and forth during its work, and thus we produce a  percentage of friction loss alone equal to twice or even three times the  51/2 per cent. heat loss which is responsible for all this expense in  first cost and in maintenance, but which really is not saved after all  unless water injection in the form of spray also forms a part of the  system.    It is obvious that cost of construction and maintenance have much to do  with the commercial value of an air compressor. The hydraulic piston  machine not only costs a great deal more in proportion to the power it  produces, but it costs more to maintain it, and it costs more to run it.  It is not an uncommon thing to hear engineers speak of the hydraulic  piston compressor as the \"most economical\" machine for the purpose, but  that it is so \"expensive\" and takes up so much room, and requires such  expensive foundations that, unless persons are \"willing to spend so much  money,\" they had better take the next best thing, a high speed machine.  We hear of \"magnificent air-compressing engines, the largest in the  country,\" and pilgrimages are made to see these artificial wonders when,  not unlike the old pyramids, they represent a pile of inert matter--a  monument to moneyed kings.    The hydraulic piston compressor has one solitary advantage, and that is,  it has no dead spaces. It was conceived at a time when dead spaces were  very serious conditions--were positive specters! Valves and other  mechanism connected with the cylinder of an air compressor were once of  such crude construction that it was impossible to reduce the clearance  spaces to a reasonable point, and, furthermore, the valves were heavy  and so complicated that anything like a high speed would either break  them or wear them out rapidly, or derange them so that leakages would  occur. But we have now reduced inlet and discharge valves and all other  moving parts connected with an air cylinder to a point of extreme  simplicity. Clearance space is in some cases destroyed altogether by  what is, as it were, an elastic air head which is brought into direct  contact with the piston. All this reduces clearance to so small a point  that it has no influence of any consequence. The moving parts are made  extremely simple, even arriving at a point where inlet valves are opened  and closed by their natural inertia. Mr. Sturgeon, of England, has  applied a most ingenious and successful inlet valve, which is opened and  closed by the friction of the air piston rod through the gland. We have,  therefore, reached a point at which high speed is made possible.    Long-stroke air compressors are evidently objectionable on the basis of  greater expense"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11662"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 598, June 18, 1887 (#10)"],[1,"of the millions of sewing  machines now manufactured annually.    _High Arm Construction_.--Sewing machines, as now constructed, exhibit a  rather short and very high arm, a form of framework that has been found to  contribute in no small degree to the light running capabilities of fast  speed machines. While it reduces the length of the various parts concerned  in the transference of the motive power, it adds to their rigidity and  diminishes their weight, maintaining at the same time the capacity of the  machine to accommodate the largest garments beneath the arm.    But the specific improvements in plain sewing machines, to which I have had  the honor of drawing your attention, do not exhaust the list, and, time  permitting, it might be considerably augmented. Nor must it be inferred  that advancement has taken place exclusively in those systems of sewing  machinery now before us.    _Accessories to Sewing Machines_.--The number of special attachments that  have been successfully adapted to plain sewing machines has multiplied so  rapidly of late, that only one or two of the more notable can be spoken of  on this occasion. Perhaps the most generally useful of these is the  trimmer, an arrangement consisting of a vibrating knife, which trims off  the superfluous edge of a seam as the machine stitches it. These are in  extensive use in the factories at Leicester, Nottingham, and elsewhere,  while Northampton and Norwich use the same device for paring the seams in  boot upper manufacture. The chisel-like knife is usually actuated by a cam  rotating with the main shaft, and one or two of the usual forms of this  attachment are to be seen here this evening on both lock and loop stitch  machines.    When machines are moved by the foot, there are many objections to running  the whole machine while winding the shuttle reels. We have, therefore,  several useful devices for releasing the balance wheel of the machine from  the main shaft, while winding. These are to be found both on Wheeler &  Wilson's manufacturing machine and upon Singer's highly finished \"Family\"  machine, which also carries a most ingenious automatic reel winder, capable  of doing all the work itself, and ceasing to act as soon as the bobbin is  filled.    The setting of the needle in a sewing machine was once quite a task.  Ofttimes it had to be adjusted by chance, in other instances by certain  guiding marks upon the needle bar. It is gratifying to know that all this  has been done away with, and that the needle has only to be inserted into  the bar, and fastened by turning a small screw. These are styled  self-setting needles, and are usually so arranged that they cannot be  adjusted wrongly as to the position of the eye.    In the Willcox & Gibbs machine, and in Singer's single thread machine,  shown here, we have an intermittent tension arrangement, which clamps the  thread at the right moment, and differs from ordinary tension devices,  inasmuch as it may be said to be automatic. The feeder, too, on these  machines is of excellent design, while the arrangements that have been  introduced into the Willcox & Gibbs straw hat sewing machine are  surprisingly effective in spinning up a hat from a loose roll of braid.  Speaking of straw hat machines, mention should be made of Wiseman's hand  stitch apparatus, as improved by Messrs. Willcox & Gibbs, and shown here  this evening. This machine employs two needles, and makes a stitch  resembling hand work at intervals, producing a short stitch at the center  of the hat, and automatically widening the space between the stitches as  the distance from the center increases. The machine itself is of wonderful  ingenuity, and must be examined to be understood.    The stitch making itself is, I believe, quite new, and is also of much  interest. A pair of needles, the width of a stitch apart, rise from beneath  through the material. One of these is an ordinary machine needle, threaded;  the other is a barbed needle. After rising above the surface, the loop of  the threaded needle is seized by a \"threader,\" and thrown into the barb of  the barbed needle. The needles then descend, and the feed occurs, being the  length between stitches. Upon the ascent of the needles again against the  material, the loop is both given off the barb and is entered by the  threaded needle, completing the stitch.    _Of Button Hole Machines_.--The mechanism of button hole machines is so  intricate, that I can only attempt on this occasion to partially elucidate  the construction of one of them, recently introduced, namely, Singer's,  which automatically cuts, guides, and stitches the work.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.]    Fig. 9 exhibits the stitching made by this machine upon the edge of the  button hole. Fig. 10 represents the right and left hand loopers and loop  spreaders, and for the stitch making. They rock from right to left with an  intermittent motion obtained from a cam. The left hand looper carries the  under thread and interweaves it with the upper, forming the stitch,  originally invented, I believe, by Mr. George Fisher, of Nottingham, and  reinvented for the button holing machine by D.W.G. Humphreys, of  Massachusetts, U.S.A., in 1862. The loop spreaders are moved by a roller  carried upon the looper frame. Fig. 11 exhibits the feeding arrangement,  both sides of the feed wheel, the driving lever, and the shape of the path  given to the carrying clamp by the heart cam cut in the upper surface of  the feed wheel. The picture on the screen represents the upper portions of  the machine, exhibiting the conveying clamp, the to and fro dipping motions  of the needle bar, and the parts conveying motion to the arrangements  beneath the bed plate. These are shown in Fig. 12, and represent the feed  and looper cams, the feeding and looper levers, and the stitch forming  mechanism already shown. A most ingenious device in this machine is the  arrangement for automatically lengthening the throw of the feed while  stitching around the eye of the button hole. It is effected by means of a  cam, which imparts more or less leverage to the feed arm by the  intervention of a \"shipper\" lever, hinged to the feed lever itself. The  space of time at my disposal obliges me to recommend a personal examination  of the machine itself, to fully understand its various motions and its  action in working a button hole.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.]    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]    Mention may be made of Singer's special button hole machine for making the  straight holes used in linen work, and in which a shuttle is employed. Of  Wheeler & Wilson's ingenious button hole machine for the same purpose, I am  enabled to show a diagram, in which it will be observed that the feeding  arrangements are placed above the bed plate, and are no doubt thereby  rendered easily accessible.    _Application of Power to Sewing Machines_.--There was a time when a cry  arose to the effect that the introduction of mechanical sewing would lead  to divers calamities, physical and mental. The ladies were to become  crooked in the spine, and regular operators were to become regular  cripples. It is scarcely necessary to ask, Has this been so? The operators  of to-day are, I think, superior in physical attainments to their sisters  of the needle and thread fifty years ago.    Within the past few years a revolution has taken place in the moving of  sewing machines. Domestic machines will probably always be driven by foot  power, spring, electric, and water motors notwithstanding. But the age of  treadles in the great manufacturing trades is a thing of the past. It was  not necessary for Parliament to step in and protect the workers, as was  frequently suggested by alarmists. The commercial interests of  manufacturers themselves were at stake. Machines driven by power could do  25 per cent. more work than those moved by foot. The operators, relieved of  the treadling, maintained a much better working condition; and altogether  the introduction of power driving, once well tested, became a necessity.  Power sewing machinery was speedily devised and introduced by several of  the first manufacturers, controllers of the speed of the machines followed,  and two or three splendid systems of stitching by steam power were soon  widely known.    By the kindness of three of the best manufacturers of power sewing  machinery, I am enabled to show to you, this evening, the best known  systems, arranged just as they are fitted in many large factories, as also  a sketch of the arrangements of Wheeler & Wilson's system. We have in the  first place a light shafting carrying a band wheel opposite to each  machine. By the use of a powerful electromotor, the shafting is caused to  rotate at the rate of 400 revolutions per minute by electricity. The  current is generated by the Society's dynamo machine, and is conveyed here  by copper cable. I do not know of any instance of sewing machinery in a  factory being driven by an electromotor, but such means of conveying motive  power appears admirably adapted for that purpose, when the stitching room  happens to be far removed from the main shafting or engine. But with regard  to motors for sewing machines, when special power has to be fitted down for  that purpose, my own experience leads me to speak in favor of the admirably  governed \"Otto\" gas engines made by Crossley Bros. These are especially  steady, a feature of no small moment in moving stitching machinery of  various kinds.    Much attention has been devoted to the invention of controllers of the  motive power supplied to sewing machines. The principle of the friction  disk has found most favor. In many cases two of these plates, fast and  loose, are placed upon the main shaft, and their separation and contact  controlled by the treadle. The great sensitiveness of the friction  attachment employed by the Singer company is due chiefly to the  transference of the"]]]
