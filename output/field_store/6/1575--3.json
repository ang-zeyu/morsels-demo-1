One day the rich man wished to send a magic ring to his daughter, so he  called the dog and the cat to him. To the cat he said: \"You are very  cunning and prudent. You may carry this magic ring to my daughter,  but be sure to take very great care of it.\" To the dog he said:  \"You are to go with the cat to take a magic ring to my daughter. Take  care not to lose the way, and see that no one molests the cat.\" Both  animals promised to do their best and set out immediately.    On the way they were obliged to cross a wide and deep river, over  which there was no bridge, and as they were unable to find a boat,  they determined to swim across it. The dog said to the cat: \"Give  me the magic ring.\" \"Oh, no,\" replied the cat. \"Did you not hear the  master say just what each of us had to do?\"    \"Yes, but you are not very good at swimming, and may lose the ring,  while I am strong and can take good care of it,\" answered the dog. The  cat continued to refuse to disobey its master, until at last the dog  threatened to kill it, and it was obliged to intrust the ring to the  dog's keeping.    Then they began to swim across the river, which was so strong that they  were about an hour in getting over, so that both became very tired and  weak. Just before they came to the other side, the dog dropped the ring  into the water, and it was impossible to find it. \"Now,\" said the cat,  \"we had better go back home and tell our master that we have lost the  ring.\" \"Yes,\" answered the dog, \"but I am very much afraid.\" So they  turned back toward home, but as they drew near the house his fear so  overcame him that he ran away and was never seen again.    The master was very much surprised to see the cat back so soon, and  asked him, \"Where is your companion?\" The cat was at first afraid to  answer. \"Where is the dog?\" asked the master again. \"Oh, he ran away,\"  replied the cat. \"Ran away?\" said the master. \"What do you mean? Where  is the ring?\" \"Oh, pardon me, my master,\" answered the cat. \"Do not be  angry, and I will tell you what has happened. When we reached the bank  of the river, the dog asked me to give him the ring. This I refused  many times, until at last he threatened to kill me if I did not give it  to him, and I was obliged to do so. The river was very hard to cross,  and on the way the dog dropped the ring into the water and we could  not find it. I persuaded the dog to come back with me to tell you  about it, but on the way he became so frightened that he ran away.\"    Then the master made a proclamation to the people, offering a reward to  the one who should find his old dog and bring him to him. They could  recognize the dog by his being old and having no teeth. The master  also declared that when he had found the delinquent he would punish  him by cutting off his tail. He ordered that the dogs all around the  world should take part in the search, and so ever since that time,  when one dog meets another he always asks: \"Are you the old dog who  lost the magic ring? If you are, your tail must be cut off.\" Then  instantly both show their teeth and wag their tails to mean no. Since  that time, also, cats have been afraid of water, and will never swim  across a river if it can be avoided.      CHAPTER 14    The Eagle and the Hen.    One day the eagle declared his love for the hen. He flew down to search  for her, and when he had found her he said: \"I wish you to be my mate.\"    The hen answered: \"I am willing, but let me first grow wings like  yours, so I can fly as high as you.\" The eagle replied: \"I will do so,  and as a sign of our betrothal I will give you this ring. Take good  care of it until I come again.\"    The hen promised to do so, and the eagle flew away.    The next day the cock met the hen. When he saw the ring around her neck  he was very much surprised and said: \"Where did you get that ring? I  think you are not true to me. Do you not remember your promise to be  my mate? Throw away that ring.\" So she did.    At the end of a week the eagle came with beautiful feathers to dress  the hen. When she saw him she became frightened and hid behind the  door. The eagle entered, crying: \"How are you, my dear hen? I am  bringing you a beautiful dress,\" and he showed it to the hen. \"But  where is your ring? Why do you not wear it?\" The hen could not at  first answer, but after a little she tried to deceive the eagle, and  said: \"Oh, pardon me, sir! Yesterday as I was walking in the garden  I met a large snake, and I was so frightened that I ran towards the  house. When I reached it I found that I had lost the ring, and I  looked everywhere for it; but alas! I have not yet found it.\"    The eagle looked keenly at the hen and said: \"I would never have  believed that you would behave so badly. I promise you that, whenever  you have found my ring, I will come down again and take you for my  mate. As a punishment for breaking your promise you shall always  scratch the ground and look for the ring, and all your chickens that  I find I will snatch away from you. That is all. Good-by.\" Then he  flew away.    And ever since, all the hens all over the world have been scratching  to find the eagle's ring.            Note.--The bird of whom this story is told is the dapay, or brahman  kite. It is larger than most of our hawks and is more like the eagle  in appearance, although not very large.        CHAPTER 15    The Spider and the Fly.    Mr. Spider was once in love with Miss Fly. Several times he declared  his love, but was always repelled, for Miss Fly disliked his business.    One day, when she saw him coming, she closed the doors and windows  of her house and made ready a pot of boiling water.    Mr. Spider called to be allowed to enter the house, but Miss Fly's  only answer was to throw the boiling water at him.    \"Well!\" cried Mr. Spider, \"I and my descendants shall be avenged upon  you and yours. We will never give you a moment's peace.\"    Mr. Spider did not break his word, for to this day we see his hatred  of the fly.      CHAPTER 16    The Battle of the Crabs.    One day the land crabs had a meeting. One of them said: \"What shall  we do with the waves? They sing all the time so loudly that we cannot  possibly sleep well at night.\" \"Do you not think it would be well  for all of us males to go down and fight them?\" asked the eldest of  the crabs. \"Yes,\" all replied. \"Well, to-morrow all the males must  get ready to go.\"    The next day they started to go down to the sea. On the way they met  the shrimp. \"Where are you going, my friends?\" asked the shrimp. The  crabs answered: \"We are going to fight the waves, because they will  not let us sleep at night.\"    \"I don't think you will win the battle,\" said the shrimp. \"The waves  are very strong, while your legs are so weak that your bodies bend  almost to the ground when you walk,\" and he laughed. The crabs were  so angry at his scorn that they ran at the shrimp and pinched him  until he promised to help them in the battle.    When they reached the shore, the crabs looked at the shrimp and said:  \"Your face is turned the wrong way, friend shrimp,\" and they laughed  at him, for crabs are much like other people, and think they are the  only ones who are right. \"Are you ready to fight with the waves? What  weapon have you?\"    \"My weapon,\" replied the shrimp, \"is a spear on my head.\" Just then  he saw a large wave coming, and ran away; but the crabs, who were  all looking towards the shore, did not see it, and were killed.    The wives of the dead crabs wondered why their husbands did not come  home. They thought the battle must be a long one, and decided to go  down and help their husbands. As they reached the shore and entered  the water to look for their husbands, the waves killed them.    A short time afterwards, thousands of little crabs, such as are now  called fiddlers, were found near the shore. When these children were  old enough to walk, the shrimp often visited them and related to them  the sad fate of their parents. And so, if you will watch carefully  the fiddlers, you will notice that they always seem ready to run back  to the land, where their forefathers lived, and then, as they regain  their courage, they rush down, as if about to fight the waves. But  they always lack the courage to do so, and continually run back and  forth. They live neither on dry land, as their ancestors did, nor in  the sea, like the other crabs, but up on the beach, where the waves  wash over them at high tide and try to dash them to pieces.      CHAPTER 17    The Meeting of the Plants.    Once upon a time plants were able to talk as well as people, and to  walk from place to place. One day King Molave, the strongest tree,  who lived on a high mountain, called his subjects together for a  general meeting.    Then every tree put itself in motion towards the designated spot, each  doing its best to reach it first. But the buri palm was several days  late, which made the king angry, and he cursed it in these terms:--    \"You must be punished for your negligence, and as king I pass upon  you this sentence: You shall never see your descendants, for you  shall die just as your seeds are ready to grow.\"    And from that day the buri palms have always died without seeing  their descendants.      CHAPTER 18    Who Brings the Cholera?    The Filipinos, being for the most part ignorant of the laws of hygiene,  attribute the cholera to any cause rather than the right one. In  general, they believe it to be caused by some evil-minded men, who  poison the wells, or, sometimes, by evil spirits, as the following  story will show.    Tanag was a poor man who lived in a town in the interior of one of  the Philippine Islands. He had nothing to eat, nor could he find  any work by which he might earn his food, and so he determined to  emigrate. At that time the cholera was at its height.    As Tanag was rather old, he walked so slowly that in a day he had  gone but three miles. At"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11029"],[0,"American Hero-Myths: A Study in the Native Religions of the Western Continent (#10)"],[1,"alli_, means literally a large, handsome green  feather, such as were very highly prized by the natives. Hence it came to  mean, in an adjective sense, precious, beautiful, beloved, admirable. The  bird from which these feathers were obtained was the _quetzal-tototl_  (_tototl_, bird) and is called by ornithologists _Trogon splendens_.    The latter part of the name, _coatl_, has in Aztec three entirely  different meanings. It means a guest, also twins, and lastly, as a  syncopated form of _cohuatl_, a serpent. Metaphorically, _cohuatl_ meant  something mysterious, and hence a supernatural being, a god. Thus  Montezuma, when he built a temple in the city of Mexico dedicated to the  whole body of divinities, a regular Pantheon, named it _Coatecalli_, the  House of the Serpent.[1]    [Footnote 1: \"Coatecalli, que quiere decir el _templo de la culebra_, que  sin metafora quiere decir _templo de diversos dioses_.\" Duran, _Historia  de las Indias de Nueva Espana_, cap. LVIII.]    Through these various meanings a good defence can be made of several  different translations of the name, and probably it bore even to the  natives different meanings at different times. I am inclined to believe  that the original sense was that advocated by Becerra in the seventeenth  century, and adopted by Veitia in the eighteenth, both competent Aztec  scholars.[1] They translate Quetzalcoatl as \"the admirable twin,\" and  though their notion that this refers to Thomas Didymus, the Apostle, does  not meet my views, I believe they were right in their etymology. The  reference is to the duplicate nature of the Light-God as seen in the  setting and rising sun, the sun of to-day and yesterday, the same yet  different. This has its parallels in many other mythologies.[2]    [Footnote 1: Becerra, _Felicidad de Mejico_, 1685, quoted in Veitia,  _Historia del Origen de las Gentes que poblaron la America Septentrional_,  cap. XIX.]    [Footnote 2: In the Egyptian \"Book of the Dead,\" Ra, the Sun-God, says, \"I  am a soul and its twins,\" or, \"My soul is becoming two twins.\" \"This means  that the soul of the sun-god is one, but, now that it is born again, it  divides into two principal forms. Ra was worshipped at An, under his two  prominent manifestations, as Tum the primal god, or more definitely, god  of the sun at evening, and as Harmachis, god of the new sun, the sun at  dawn.\" Tiele, _History of the Egyptian Religion_, p. 80.]    The correctness of this supposition seems to be shown by a prevailing  superstition among the Aztecs about twins, and which strikingly  illustrates the uniformity of mythological conceptions throughout the  world. All readers are familiar with the twins Romulus and Remus in Roman  story, one of whom was fated to destroy their grandfather Amulius; with  Edipus and Telephos, whose father Laios, was warned that his death would  be by one of his children; with Theseus and Peirithoos, the former  destined to cause the suicide of his father Aigeus; and with many more  such myths. They can be traced, without room for doubt, back to simple  expressions of the fact that the morning and the evening of the one day  can only come when the previous day is past and gone; expressed  figuratively by the statement that any one day must destroy its  predecessor. This led to the stories of \"the fatal children,\" which we  find so frequent in Aryan mythology.[1]    [Footnote 1: Sir George W. Cox, _The Science of Comparative Mythology and  Folk Lore_, pp. 14, 83, 130, etc.]    The Aztecs were a coarse and bloody race, and carried out their  superstitions without remorse. Based, no doubt, on this mythical  expression of a natural occurrence, they had the belief that if twins were  allowed to live, one or the other of them would kill and eat his father or  mother; therefore, it was their custom when such were brought into the  world to destroy one of them.[1]    [Footnote 1: Geronimo de Mendieta, _Historia Eclesiastica Indiana_. Lib.  II, cap. XIX.]    We shall see that, as in Algonkin story Michabo strove to slay his father,  the West Wind, so Quetzalcoatl was in constant warfare with his father,  Tezcatlipoca-Camaxtli, the Spirit of Darkness. The effect of this  oft-repeated myth on the minds of the superstitious natives was to lead  them to the brutal child murder I have mentioned.    It was, however, natural that the more ordinary meaning, \"the feathered or  bird-serpent,\" should become popular, and in the picture writing some  combination of the serpent with feathers or other part of a bird was often  employed as the rebus of the name Quetzalcoatl.    He was also known by other names, as, like all the prominent gods in early  mythologies, he had various titles according to the special attribute or  function which was uppermost in the mind of the worshipper. One of these  was _Papachtic_, He of the Flowing Locks, a word which the Spaniards  shortened to Papa, and thought was akin to their title of the Pope. It is,  however, a pure Nahuatl word,[1] and refers to the abundant hair with  which he was always credited, and which, like his ample beard, was, in  fact, the symbol of the sun's rays, the aureole or glory of light which  surrounded his face.    [Footnote 1: \"_Papachtic_, guedejudo; _Papachtli_, guedeja o vedija de  capellos, o de otra cosa assi.\" Molina, _Vocabulario de la Lengua  Mexicana_. sub voce. Juan de Tobar, in Kingsborough, Vol. viii, p. 259,  note.]    His fair complexion was, as usual, significant of light. This association  of ideas was so familiar among the Mexicans that at the time of an eclipse  of the sun they sought out the whitest men and women they could find, and  sacrificed them, in order to pacify the sun.[1]    [Footnote 1: Mendieta, _Historia Eclesiastica Indiana_, Lib. ii, cap.  xvi.]    His opponent, Tezcatlipoca, was the most sublime figure in the Aztec  Pantheon. He towered above all other gods, as did Jove in Olympus. He was  appealed to as the creator of heaven and earth, as present in every place,  as the sole ruler of the world, as invisible and omniscient.    The numerous titles by which he was addressed illustrate the veneration in  which he was held. His most common name in prayers was _Titlacauan_, We  are his Slaves. As believed to be eternally young, he was Telpochtli, the  Youth; as potent and unpersuadable, he was _Moyocoyatzin_, the Determined  Doer;[1] as exacting in worship, _Monenegui_, He who Demands Prayers; as  the master of the race, _Teyocoyani_, Creator of Men, and _Teimatini_,  Disposer of Men. As he was jealous and terrible, the god who visited on  men plagues, and famines, and loathsome diseases, the dreadful deity who  incited wars and fomented discord, he was named _Yaotzin_, the Arch Enemy,  _Yaotl necoc_, the Enemy of both Sides, _Moquequeloa_, the Mocker,  _Nezaualpilli_, the Lord who Fasts, _Tlamatzincatl_, He who Enforces  Penitence; and as dark, invisible and inscrutable, he was _Yoalli  ehecatl_, the Night Wind.[2]    [Footnote 1: _Moyocoyatzin_, is the third person singular of _yocoya_, to  do, to make, with the reverential termination _tzin_. Sahagun says this  title was given him because he could do what he pleased, on earth or in  heaven, and no one could prevent him. (Historia de Nueva Espana, Lib. III.  cap. II.) It seems to me that it would rather refer to his demiurgic,  creative power.]    [Footnote 2: All these titles are to be found in Sahagun, _Historia de  Nueva Espana_.]    He was said to be formed of thin air and darkness; and when he was seen of  men it was as a shadow without substance. He alone of all the gods defied  the assaults of time, was ever young and strong, and grew not old with  years.[1] Against such an enemy who could hope for victory?    [Footnote 1: The description of Clavigero is worth quoting: \"TEZCATLIPOCA:  Questo era il maggior Dio, che in que paesi si adorava, dopo il Dio  invisible, o Supremo Essere. Era il Dio della Providenza, l' anima del  Mondo, il Creator del Cielo e della Terra, ed il Signor di tutle le cose.  Rappresentavanlo tuttora giovane per significare, che non s' invecchiava  mai, ne s' indeboliva cogli anni.\" _Storia Antica di Messico_, Lib. vi, p.  7.]    The name \"Tezcatlipoca\" is one of odd significance. It means The Smoking  Mirror. This strange metaphor has received various explanations. The  mirrors in use among the Aztecs were polished plates of obsidian, trimmed  to a circular form. There was a variety of this black stone called  _tezcapoctli_, smoky mirror stone, and from this his images were at times  made.[1] This, however, seems too trivial an explanation.    [Footnote 1: Sahagun, _Historia_, Lib. ii, cap. xxxvii.]    Others have contended that Tezcatlipoca, as undoubtedly the spirit of  darkness and the night, refers, in its meaning, to the moon, which hangs  like a bright round mirror in the sky, though partly dulled by what the  natives thought a smoke.[1]    [Footnote 1: _Anales del Museo Nacional_, Tom. ii, p. 257.]    I am inclined to believe, however, that the mirror referred to is that  first and most familiar of all, the surface of water: and that the smoke  is the mist which at night rises from lake and river, as actual smoke does  in the still air.    As presiding over the darkness and the night, dreams and the phantoms of  the gloom were supposed to be sent by Tezcatlipoca, and to him were sacred  those animals which prowl about at night, as the skunk and the coyote.[1]    [Footnote 1: Sahagun, _Historia_. Lib. vi, caps. ix, xi, xii.]    Thus his names, his various attributes, his sacred animals and his myths  unite in identifying this deity as a primitive personification of the  Darkness, whether that of the storm or of the night.[1]    [Footnote 1: Senor Alfredo Chavero believes Tezcatlipoca to have been  originally the moon, and there is little doubt at times this was one of  his symbols, as the ruler of the darkness. M. Girard de Rialle, on the  other hand, claims him as a solar deity. \"Il "]]]
