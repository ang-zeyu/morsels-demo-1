Some communication between the spiritual world, by the union of those  termed in Scripture \"sons of God\" and the daughters of Adam, still  continued after the Fall, though their inter-alliance was not approved  of by the Ruler of mankind. We are given to understand--darkly, indeed,  but with as much certainty as we can be entitled to require--that the  mixture between the two species of created beings was sinful on the part  of both, and displeasing to the Almighty. It is probable, also, that the  extreme longevity of the antediluvian mortals prevented their feeling  sufficiently that they had brought themselves under the banner of  Azrael, the angel of death, and removed to too great a distance the  period between their crime and its punishment. The date of the avenging  Flood gave birth to a race whose life was gradually shortened, and who,  being admitted to slighter and rarer intimacy with beings who possessed  a higher rank in creation, assumed, as of course, a lower position in  the scale. Accordingly, after this period we hear no more of those  unnatural alliances which preceded the Flood, and are given to  understand that mankind, dispersing into different parts of the world,  separated from each other, and began, in various places, and under  separate auspices, to pursue the work of replenishing the world, which  had been imposed upon them as an end of their creation. In the meantime,  while the Deity was pleased to continue his manifestations to those who  were destined to be the fathers of his elect people, we are made to  understand that wicked men--it may be by the assistance of fallen  angels--were enabled to assert rank with, and attempt to match, the  prophets of the God of Israel. The matter must remain uncertain whether  it was by sorcery or legerdemain that the wizards of Pharaoh, King of  Egypt, contended with Moses, in the face of the prince and people,  changed their rods into serpents, and imitated several of the plagues  denounced against the devoted kingdom. Those powers of the Magi,  however, whether obtained by supernatural communications, or arising  from knowledge of legerdemain and its kindred accomplishments, were  openly exhibited; and who can doubt that--though we may be left in some  darkness both respecting the extent of their skill and the source from  which it was drawn--we are told all which it can be important for us to  know? We arrive here at the period when the Almighty chose to take upon  himself directly to legislate for his chosen people, without having  obtained any accurate knowledge whether the crime of witchcraft, or the  intercourse between the spiritual world and embodied beings, for evil  purposes, either existed after the Flood, or was visited with any open  marks of Divine displeasure.    But in the law of Moses, dictated by the Divinity himself, was announced  a text, which, as interpreted literally, having been inserted into the  criminal code of all Christian nations, has occasioned much cruelty and  bloodshed, either from its tenor being misunderstood, or that, being  exclusively calculated for the Israelites, it made part of the judicial  Mosaic dispensation, and was abrogated, like the greater part of that  law, by the more benign and clement dispensation of the Gospel.    The text alluded to is that verse of the twenty-second chapter of Exodus  bearing, \"men shall not suffer a witch to live.\" Many learned men have  affirmed that in this remarkable passage the Hebrew word CHASAPH means  nothing more than poisoner, although, like the word _veneficus_, by  which it is rendered in the Latin version of the Septuagint, other  learned men contend that it hath the meaning of a witch also, and may be  understood as denoting a person who pretended to hurt his or her  neighbours in life, limb, or goods, either by noxious potions, by  charms, or similar mystical means. In this particular the witches of  Scripture had probably some resemblance to those of ancient Europe, who,  although their skill and power might be safely despised, as long as they  confined themselves to their charms and spells, were very apt to eke out  their capacity of mischief by the use of actual poison, so that the  epithet of sorceress and poisoner were almost synonymous. This is known  to have been the case in many of those darker iniquities which bear as  their characteristic something connected with hidden and prohibited  arts. Such was the statement in the indictment of those concerned in the  famous murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, when the arts of Forman and other  sorcerers having been found insufficient to touch the victim's life,  practice by poison was at length successfully resorted to; and numerous  similar instances might be quoted. But supposing that the Hebrew witch  proceeded only by charms, invocations, or such means as might be  innoxious, save for the assistance of demons or familiars, the connexion  between the conjurer and the demon must have been of a very different  character under the law of Moses, from that which was conceived in  latter days to constitute witchcraft. There was no contract of  subjection to a diabolic power, no infernal stamp or sign of such a  fatal league, no revellings of Satan and his hags, and no infliction of  disease or misfortune upon good men. At least there is not a word in  Scripture authorizing us to believe that such a system existed. On the  contrary, we are told (how far literally, how far metaphorically, it is  not for us to determine) that, when the Enemy of mankind desired to  probe the virtue of Job to the bottom, he applied for permission to the  Supreme Governor of the world, who granted him liberty to try his  faithful servant with a storm of disasters, for the more brilliant  exhibition of the faith which he reposed in his Maker. In all this, had  the scene occurred after the manner of the like events in latter days,  witchcraft, sorceries, and charms would have been introduced, and the  Devil, instead of his own permitted agency, would have employed his  servant the witch as the necessary instrument of the Man of Uzz's  afflictions. In like manner, Satan desired to have Peter, that he might  sift him like wheat. But neither is there here the agency of any  sorcerer or witch. Luke xxii. 31.    Supposing the powers of the witch to be limited, in the time of Moses,  to enquiries at some pretended deity or real evil spirit concerning  future events, in what respect, may it be said, did such a crime deserve  the severe punishment of death? To answer this question, we must reflect  that the object of the Mosaic dispensation being to preserve the  knowledge of the True Deity within the breasts of a selected and  separated people, the God of Jacob necessarily showed himself a jealous  God to all who, straying from the path of direct worship of Jehovah, had  recourse to other deities, whether idols or evil spirits, the gods of  the neighbouring heathen. The swerving from their allegiance to the true  Divinity, to the extent of praying to senseless stocks and stones which  could return them no answer, was, by the Jewish law, an act of rebellion  to their own Lord God, and as such most fit to be punished capitally.  Thus the prophets of Baal were deservedly put to death, not on account  of any success which they might obtain by their intercessions and  invocations (which, though enhanced with all their vehemence, to the  extent of cutting and wounding themselves, proved so utterly unavailing  as to incur the ridicule of the prophet), but because they were guilty  of apostasy from the real Deity, while they worshipped, and encouraged  others to worship, the false divinity Baal. The Hebrew witch, therefore,  or she who communicated, or attempted to communicate, with an evil  spirit, was justly punished with death, though her communication with  the spiritual world might either not exist at all, or be of a nature  much less intimate than has been ascribed to the witches of later days;  nor does the existence of this law, against the witches of the Old  Testament sanction, in any respect, the severity of similar enactments  subsequent to the Christian revelation, against a different class of  persons, accused of a very different species of crime.    In another passage, the practices of those persons termed witches in the  Holy Scriptures are again alluded to; and again it is made manifest that  the sorcery or witchcraft of the Old Testament resolves itself into a  trafficking with idols, and asking counsel of false deities; in other  words, into idolatry, which, notwithstanding repeated prohibitions,  examples, and judgments, was still the prevailing crime of the  Israelites. The passage alluded to is in Deuteronomy xviii. 10,  ii--\"There shall not be found among you anyone that maketh his son or  his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an  observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a  consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.\" Similar  denunciations occur in the nineteenth and twentieth chapters of  Leviticus. In like manner, it is a charge against Manasses (2 Chronicles  xxxviii.) that he caused his children to pass through the fire, observed  times, used enchantments and witchcraft, and dealt with familiar spirits  and with wizards. These passages seem to concur with the former, in  classing witchcraft among other desertions of the prophets of the Deity,  in order to obtain responses by the superstitious practices of the pagan  nations around them. To understand the texts otherwise seems to confound  the modern system of witchcraft, with all its unnatural and improbable  outrages on common sense, with the crime of the person who, in classical  days, consulted the oracle of Apollo--a capital offence in a Jew,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14466"],[0,"South African Memories (#10)"],[1,"king. He would wander through the rooms, enjoying the pleasure of  looking at his many beautiful pieces of furniture and curiosities of  all sorts, nearly all of which had a history. Occasionally shifting a  piece of rare old glass or blue Delft china, he would the while talk to  anyone who chanced to come in, greeting heartily his old friends, and  remembering every detail of their circumstances, opinions, and conduct.  Concerning the latter, he did not fail to remind them of any failings he  had taken note of. Those who were frauds, incompetent, or lazy, he never  spared, and often such conversations were a source of much amusement to  me. On the other hand, those who had been true to him, and had not  veered round with the tide of public opinion after 1896, were ever  remembered and rewarded. It was remarkable to note the various Dutch  members of the Assembly who dropped in, sometimes stealthily in the  early morning hours, or, like Nicodemus, by night. One such gentleman  came to breakfast one day, bringing as a gift two curious antique pipes  and a pouch of Boer tobacco. The pipes were awarded a place in a glass  cabinet, and the giver most heartily thanked; he finally departed, well  pleased with himself. Now comes a curious trait in the man's character.  Before leaving he whispered to a friend the request that the fact of his  visit should not be mentioned in Cape Town circles. This request was  naturally repeated at once to Mr. Rhodes, much to the latter's  amusement. As ill-luck would have it, the cautious gentleman left his  umbrella behind, with his name in full on the handle; this remained a  prominent object on the hall table till, when evening fell, a trusted  emissary came to recover it.    I often used to visit the House of Assembly or Lower House during that  session, and it was instructive to note the faces of the Opposition when  Rhodesia and its undoubted progress were subjects of discussion, and  especially when Mr. Rhodes was on his feet, claiming the undivided  attention of the House. It was not his eloquence that kept people so  attentive, for no one could call him eloquent; it was the singularly  expressive voice, the (at times) persuasive manner, and, above all, the  interesting things his big ideas gave him to say, that preserved that  complete silence. But, as I said before, the faces of his then  antagonists--albeit quondam friends--hardly disguised their thoughts  sufficiently. They were forced to consider the country of the man they  feared--the country to which he had given his name--as a factor in their  colony; they had to admit it to their financial calculations, and all  the time they would fain have crushed the great pioneer under their  feet. They had, indeed, hoped to see him humbled and abashed after his  one fatal mistake, instead of which he had gone calmly on his way--a  Colossus indeed--with the set purpose, as a guiding star ever before his  eyes, to retrieve the error which they had fondly imagined would have  delivered him into their hands. Truly an impressive and curious study  was that House of Assembly in the session of 1899.    The number of people, more or less interesting, whom we met at Groot  Schuurr, seemed to pass as actors on a stage, sometimes almost too  rapidly to distinguish or individualize. But one or two stand out  specially in my recollection. Among them, a type of a fine old  gentleman, was Colonel Schermbrucker. A German by birth, and over  seventy years of age, he had served originally in the Papal Guard, and  had accompanied Pio Nono on the occasion of his famous flight from Rome.  Somewhere in the fifties, at the time of the arrival of the German  Legion, he had settled at the Cape, and had been a figure in politics  ever since. His opinions were distinctly English and progressive, but it  was more as an almost extinct type of the courtly old gentleman that he  impressed me. His extreme activity for his years, his old-world manners,  and his bright intelligence, were combinations one does not often meet,  and would have made him an interesting figure in any assembly or  country. Another day came Judge Coetzee, erstwhile Kruger's confidant  and right hand, but then of a very different way of thinking to his old  master. His remark on the warlike situation was as follows: \"Kruger is  only a white Kaffir chief, and as such respects force, and force only.  Send sufficient soldiers, and there will be no fighting.\" This was also  Mr. Rhodes's view, but, as it turned out, both were wrong. In the  meantime the sands were running out, and the troops were almost on the  water, and yet the old man remained obdurate.    Outside the hospitable haven of Groot Schuurr I one day met Mr. Merriman  at lunch as the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Richard Solomon.[14] Considerably  above the average height, with a slight stoop and grey hair, Mr.  Merriman was a man whose appearance from the first claimed interest. It  was a few days after his Budget speech, which, from various innovations,  had aroused a storm of criticism, as Budgets are wont to do. Whatever  his private feelings were about the English, to me the Finance Minister  was very pleasant and friendly. We talked of fruit-farming, in which he  takes a great interest, of England, and even of his Budget, and never  did he show any excitement or irritation till someone happened to  mention the word \"Imperialist.\" Then he burst out with, \"That word and  'Empire' have been so done to death by every wretched little Jew  stockbroker in this country that I am fairly sick of them.\" \"But surely  you are not a Little Englander, Mr. Merriman,\" I said, \"or a follower  of Mr. Labouchere?\" To this he gave an evasive reply, and the topic  dropped. I must relate another incident of our sojourn at Cape Town.  Introduced by Mr. Rhodes's architect, Mr. Baker, we went one day to see  a Mrs. Koopman, then a well-known personage in Cape Town Dutch society,  but who, I believe, is now dead. Her collection of Delft china was  supposed to be very remarkable. She lived in a quaint old house with  diamond-paned windows, in one of the back streets, the whole edifice  looking as if it had not been touched for a hundred years. Mrs. Koopman  was an elderly lady, most suitably dressed in black, with a widow's cap,  and she greeted us very kindly and showed us all her treasured  possessions. I was disappointed in the contents of the rooms, which were  certainly mixed, some very beautiful things rubbing shoulders with  modern specimens of clumsy early Victorian furniture. A room at the back  was given up to the Delft china, but even this was spoilt by ordinary  yellow arabesque wall-paper, on which were hung the rare plates and  dishes, and by some gaudy window curtains, evidently recently added. The  collection itself, made by Mrs. Koopman at very moderate prices, before  experts bought up all the Dutch relics, was then supposed to be of great  value. Our hostess conversed in good English with a foreign accent, and  was evidently a person of much intelligence and culture. She had been,  and still was, a factor in Cape politics, formerly as a great admirer of  Mr. Rhodes, but after 1896 as one of his bitterest opponents, who used  all her considerable influence--her house being a meeting-place for the  Bond party--against him and his schemes. We had, in fact, been told she  held a sort of political salon, though hardly in the same way we think  of it in England as connected with Lady Palmerston, her guests being  entirely confined to one party--viz., the Dutch. This accounted for a  blunder on my part. Having heard that Mrs. Koopman had been greatly  perturbed by the young Queen of Holland's representations to President  Kruger in favour of the Uitlanders, and seeing many photographs of this  charming-looking girl in the room, I thought I should be right in  alluding to her as \"your little Queen.\" \"She is not my Queen,\" was the  indignant reply; \"Queen Victoria is my Queen.\" And then, quickly turning  to Mr. Baker, she continued: \"What have you been telling Lady Sarah to  make her think I am not loyal?\" Of course I had to disclaim and  apologize, but, in view of her well-known political opinions and  sympathies, I could not help thinking her extreme indignation a little  unnecessary.

In August we left Cape Town, and I went to Bulawayo, where I spent two  months. Gordon[15] had been appointed A.D.C. to Colonel Baden-Powell,  and during this time was with his chief on the western borders. The  latter was engaged in raising two regiments of irregular horse, which  were later known as the Protectorate Regiments, and were recruited  principally from the district between Mafeking and Bulawayo. At the  latter town was also another English lady, Mrs. Godley, whose husband  was second in command of one of these regiments. It can easily be  imagined that there was little else discussed then but warlike subjects,  and these were two dreary and anxious months. We had little reliable  news; the local newspapers had no special cables, and only published  rumours that were current in the town. Mr. Rochfort Maguire, who was  then staying with Mr. Rhodes at Cape Town, used frequently to telegraph  us news from there. One day he would report "]]]
