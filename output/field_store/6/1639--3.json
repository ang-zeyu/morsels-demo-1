It may be safely said that the total  number of possible sounds is greatly in excess of those actually in  use. Indeed, an experienced phonetician should have no difficulty in  inventing sounds that are unknown to objective investigation. One reason  why we find it difficult to believe that the range of possible speech  sounds is indefinitely large is our habit of conceiving the sound as a  simple, unanalyzable impression instead of as the resultant of a number  of distinct muscular adjustments that take place simultaneously. A  slight change in any one of these adjustments gives us a new sound which  is akin to the old one, because of the continuance of the other  adjustments, but which is acoustically distinct from it, so sensitive  has the human ear become to the nuanced play of the vocal mechanism.  Another reason for our lack of phonetic imagination is the fact that,  while our ear is delicately responsive to the sounds of speech, the  muscles of our speech organs have early in life become exclusively  accustomed to the particular adjustments and systems of adjustment that  are required to produce the traditional sounds of the language. All or  nearly all other adjustments have become permanently inhibited, whether  through inexperience or through gradual elimination. Of course the power  to produce these inhibited adjustments is not entirely lost, but the  extreme difficulty we experience in learning the new sounds of foreign  languages is sufficient evidence of the strange rigidity that has set in  for most people in the voluntary control of the speech organs. The point  may be brought home by contrasting the comparative lack of freedom of  voluntary speech movements with the all but perfect freedom of voluntary  gesture.[10] Our rigidity in articulation is the price we have had to  pay for easy mastery of a highly necessary symbolism. One cannot be both  splendidly free in the random choice of movements and selective with  deadly certainty.[11]    [Footnote 10: Observe the \"voluntary.\" When we shout or grunt or  otherwise allow our voices to take care of themselves, as we are likely  to do when alone in the country on a fine spring day, we are no longer  fixing vocal adjustments by voluntary control. Under these circumstances  we are almost certain to hit on speech sounds that we could never learn  to control in actual speech.]    [Footnote 11: If speech, in its acoustic and articulatory aspect, is  indeed a rigid system, how comes it, one may plausibly object, that no  two people speak alike? The answer is simple. All that part of speech  which falls out of the rigid articulatory framework is not speech in  idea, but is merely a superadded, more or less instinctively determined  vocal complication inseparable from speech in practice. All the  individual color of speech--personal emphasis, speed, personal cadence,  personal pitch--is a non-linguistic fact, just as the incidental  expression of desire and emotion are, for the most part, alien to  linguistic expression. Speech, like all elements of culture, demands  conceptual selection, inhibition of the randomness of instinctive  behavior. That its \"idea\" is never realized as such in practice, its  carriers being instinctively animated organisms, is of course true of  each and every aspect of culture.]    There are, then, an indefinitely large number of articulated sounds  available for the mechanics of speech; any given language makes use of  an explicit, rigidly economical selection of these rich resources; and  each of the many possible sounds of speech is conditioned by a number of  independent muscular adjustments that work together simultaneously  towards its production. A full account of the activity of each of the  organs of speech--in so far as its activity has a bearing on  language--is impossible here, nor can we concern ourselves in a  systematic way with the classification of sounds on the basis of their  mechanics.[12] A few bold outlines are all that we can attempt. The  organs of speech are the lungs and bronchial tubes; the throat,  particularly that part of it which is known as the larynx or, in popular  parlance, the \"Adam's apple\"; the nose; the uvula, which is the soft,  pointed, and easily movable organ that depends from the rear of the  palate; the palate, which is divided into a posterior, movable \"soft  palate\" or velum and a \"hard palate\"; the tongue; the teeth; and the  lips. The palate, lower palate, tongue, teeth, and lips may be looked  upon as a combined resonance chamber, whose constantly varying shape,  chiefly due to the extreme mobility of the tongue, is the main factor in  giving the outgoing breath its precise quality[13] of sound.    [Footnote 12: Purely acoustic classifications, such as more easily  suggest themselves to a first attempt at analysis, are now in less favor  among students of phonetics than organic classifications. The latter  have the advantage of being more objective. Moreover, the acoustic  quality of a sound is dependent on the articulation, even though in  linguistic consciousness this quality is the primary, not the secondary,  fact.]    [Footnote 13: By \"quality\" is here meant the inherent nature and  resonance of the sound as such. The general \"quality\" of the  individual's voice is another matter altogether. This is chiefly  determined by the individual anatomical characteristics of the larynx  and is of no linguistic interest whatever.]    The lungs and bronchial tubes are organs of speech only in so far as  they supply and conduct the current of outgoing air without which  audible articulation is impossible. They are not responsible for any  specific sound or acoustic feature of sounds except, possibly, accent or  stress. It may be that differences of stress are due to slight  differences in the contracting force of the lung muscles, but even this  influence of the lungs is denied by some students, who explain the  fluctuations of stress that do so much to color speech by reference to  the more delicate activity of the glottal cords. These glottal cords are  two small, nearly horizontal, and highly sensitive membranes within the  larynx, which consists, for the most part, of two large and several  smaller cartilages and of a number of small muscles that control the  action of the cords.    The cords, which are attached to the cartilages, are to the human speech  organs what the two vibrating reeds are to a clarinet or the strings to  a violin. They are capable of at least three distinct types of movement,  each of which is of the greatest importance for speech. They may be  drawn towards or away from each other, they may vibrate like reeds or  strings, and they may become lax or tense in the direction of their  length. The last class of these movements allows the cords to vibrate at  different \"lengths\" or degrees of tenseness and is responsible for the  variations in pitch which are present not only in song but in the more  elusive modulations of ordinary speech. The two other types of glottal  action determine the nature of the voice, \"voice\" being a convenient  term for breath as utilized in speech. If the cords are well apart,  allowing the breath to escape in unmodified form, we have the condition  technically known as \"voicelessness.\" All sounds produced under these  circumstances are \"voiceless\" sounds. Such are the simple, unmodified  breath as it passes into the mouth, which is, at least approximately,  the same as the sound that we write _h_, also a large number of special  articulations in the mouth chamber, like _p_ and _s_. On the other hand,  the glottal cords may be brought tight together, without vibrating. When  this happens, the current of breath is checked for the time being. The  slight choke or \"arrested cough\" that is thus made audible is not  recognized in English as a definite sound but occurs nevertheless not  infrequently.[14] This momentary check, technically known as a \"glottal  stop,\" is an integral element of speech in many languages, as Danish,  Lettish, certain Chinese dialects, and nearly all American Indian  languages. Between the two extremes of voicelessness, that of  completely open breath and that of checked breath, lies the position of  true voice. In this position the cords are close together, but not so  tightly as to prevent the air from streaming through; the cords are set  vibrating and a musical tone of varying pitch results. A tone so  produced is known as a \"voiced sound.\" It may have an indefinite number  of qualities according to the precise position of the upper organs of  speech. Our vowels, nasals (such as _m_ and _n_), and such sounds as  _b_, _z_, and _l_ are all voiced sounds. The most convenient test of a  voiced sound is the possibility of pronouncing it on any given pitch, in  other words, of singing on it.[15] The voiced sounds are the most  clearly audible elements of speech. As such they are the carriers of  practically all significant differences in stress, pitch, and  syllabification. The voiceless sounds are articulated noises that break  up the stream of voice with fleeting moments of silence. Acoustically  intermediate between the freely unvoiced and the voiced sounds are a  number of other characteristic types of voicing, such as murmuring and  whisper.[16] These and still other types of voice are relatively  unimportant in English and most other European languages, but there are  languages in which they rise to some prominence in the normal flow of  speech.    [Footnote 14: As at the end of the snappily pronounced _no!_ (sometimes  written _nope!_) or in the over-carefully pronounced _at all_, where one  may hear a slight check between the _t_ and the _a_.]    [Footnote 15: \"Singing\" is here used in a wide sense. One cannot sing  continuously on such a sound as _b_ or _d_, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12648"],[0,"The Beautiful Necessity (#10)"],[1," idea is susceptible of almost infinite development.  That the ancients proportioned their temples from the human figure  is no new idea, nor is it at all surprising. The sculpture of the  Egyptians and the Greeks reveals the fact that they studied the body  abstractly, in its exterior presentment. It is clear that the rules  of its proportions must have been established for sculpture, and it is  not unreasonable to suppose that they became canonical in architecture  also. Vitruvius and Alberti both lay stress on the fact that all  sacred buildings should be founded on the proportions of the human  body.    [Illustration 43: A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL THE SYMBOL OF THE BODY OF JESUS  CHRIST]    [Illustration 44: THE SYMBOLISM OF A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL FROM THE  ROSICRUCIANS: HARGRAVE JENNINGS]    In France, during the Middle Ages, a Gothic cathedral became, at the  hands of the secret masonic guilds, a glorified symbol of the body  of Christ. To practical-minded students of architectural history,  familiar with the slow and halting evolution of a Gothic cathedral  from a Roman basilica, such an idea may seem to be only the  maunderings of a mystical imagination, a theory evolved from the inner  consciousness, entitled to no more consideration than the familiar  fallacy that vaulted nave of a Gothic church was an attempt to imitate  the green aisles of a forest. It should be remembered however that the  habit of the thought of that time was mystical, as that of our own age  is utilitarian and scientific; and the chosen language of mysticism is  always an elaborate and involved symbolism. What could be more natural  than that a building devoted to the worship of a crucified Savior  should be made a symbol, not of the cross only, but of the body  crucified?    [Illustration 45: THE GEOMETRICAL BASIS OF THE HUMAN FIGURE]    [Illustration 46]    The _vesica piscis_ (a figure formed by the developing arcs of two  equilateral triangles having a common side) which in so many cases  seems to have determined the main proportion of a cathedral plan--the  interior length and width across the transepts--appears as an aureole  around the figure of Christ in early representations, a fact which  certainly points to a relation between the two (Illustrations 42,  43). A curious little book, _The Rosicrucians_, by Hargrave Jennings,  contains an interesting diagram which well illustrates this conception  of the symbolism of a cathedral. A copy of it is here given. The apse  is seen to correspond to the head of Christ, the north transept to his  right hand, the south transept to the left hand, the nave to the body,  and the north and south towers to the right and left feet respectively  (Illustration 44).    [Illustration 47]    The cathedral builders excelled all others in the artfulness with  which they established and maintained a relation between their  architecture and the stature of a man. This is perhaps one reason why  the French and English cathedrals, even those of moderate dimensions  are more truly impressive than even the largest of the great  Renaissance structures, such as St. Peter's in Rome. A gigantic order  furnishes no true measure for the eye: its vastness is revealed  only by the accident of some human presence which forms a basis  of comparison. That architecture is not necessarily the most  awe-inspiring which gives the impression of having been built by  giants for the abode of pigmies; like the other arts, architecture is  highest when it is most human. The mediaeval builders, true to this  dictum, employed stones of a size proportionate to the strength of  a man working without unusual mechanical aids; the great piers and  columns, built up of many such stones, were commonly subdivided  into clusters, and the circumference of each shaft of such a cluster  approximated the girth of a man; by this device the moulding of the  base and the foliation of the caps were easily kept in scale. Wherever  a balustrade occurred it was proportioned not with relation to the  height of the wall or the column below, as in classic architecture,  but with relation to a man's stature.    [Illustration 48: FIGURE DIVIDED ACCORDING TO THE EGYPTIAN CANON]    It may be stated as a general rule that every work of architecture,  of whatever style, should have somewhere about it something fixed and  enduring to relate it to the human figure, if it be only a flight of  steps in which each one is the measure of a stride. In the Farnese,  the Riccardi, the Strozzi, and many another Italian palace, the stone  seat about the base gives scale to the building because the beholder  knows instinctively that the height of such a seat must have some  relation to the length of a man's leg. In the Pitti palace the  balustrade which crowns each story answers a similar purpose: it  stands in no intimate relation to the gigantic arches below, but is  of a height convenient for lounging elbows. The door to Giotto's  campanile reveals the true size of the tower as nothing else could,  because it is so evidently related to the human figure and not to the  great windows higher up in the shaft.    [Illustration 49: THE MEDIAEVAL METHOD OF DRAWING THE FIGURE]    The geometrical plane figures which play the most important part in  architectural proportion are the square, the circle and the triangle;  and the human figure is intimately related to these elementary forms.  If a man stand with heels together, and arms outstretched horizontally  in opposite directions, he will be inscribed, as it were, within a  square; and his arms will mark, with fair accuracy, the base of an  inverted equilateral triangle, the apex of which will touch the ground  at his feet. If the arms be extended upward at an angle, and the  legs correspondingly separated, the extremities will touch  the circumferences of a circle having its center in the navel  (Illustrations 45, 46).    [Illustration 50]    The figure has been variously analyzed with a view to establishing  numerical ratios between its parts (Illustrations 47, 48, 49). Some  of these are so simple and easily remembered that they have obtained  a certain popular currency; such as that the length of the hand equals  the length of the face; that the span of the horizontally extended  arms equals the height; and the well known rule that twice around  the wrist is once around the neck, and twice around the neck is once  around the waist. The Roman architect Vitruvius, writing in the age of  Augustus Caesar, formulated the important proportions of the statues  of classical antiquity, and except that he makes the head smaller than  the normal (as it should be in heroic statuary), the ratios which  he gives are those to which the ideally perfect male figure should  conform. Among the ancients the foot was probably the standard of all  large measurements, being a more determinate length than that of the  head or face, and the height was six lengths of the foot. If the head  be taken as a unit, the ratio becomes 1:8, and if the face--1:10.    Doctor Rimmer, in his _Art Anatomy_, divides the figure into four  parts, three of which are equal, and correspond to the lengths of  the leg, the thigh and the trunk; while the fourth part, which is  two-thirds of one of these thirds, extends from the sternum to the  crown of the head. One excellence of such a division aside from its  simplicity, consists in the fact that it may be applied to the face as  well. The lowest of the three major divisions extends from the tip of  the chin to the base of the nose, the next coincides with the height  of the nose (its top being level with the eyebrows), and the last with  the height of the forehead, while the remaining two-thirds of one of  these thirds represents the horizontal projection from the beginning  of the hair on the forehead to the crown of the head. The middle of  the three larger divisions locates the ears, which are the same height  as the nose (Illustrations 45, 47).    Such analyses of the figure, however conducted, reveals an  all-pervasive harmony of parts, between which definite numerical  relations are traceable, and an apprehension of these should assist  the architectural designer to arrive at beauty of proportion by  methods of his own, not perhaps in the shape of rigid formulae, but  present in the consciousness as a restraining influence, acting and  reacting upon the mind with a conscious intention toward rhythm and  harmony. By means of such exercises, he will approach nearer to an  understanding of that great mystery, the beauty and significance of  numbers, of which mystery music, architecture, and the human figure  are equally presentments--considered, that is, from the standpoint of  the occultist.          V    LATENT GEOMETRY      [Illustration 51: THE HEXAGRAM AND EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE IN NATURE]    It is a well known fact that in the microscopically minute of nature,  units everywhere tend to arrange themselves with relation to certain  simple geometrical solids, among which are the tetrahedron, the cube,  and the sphere. This process gives rise to harmony, which may be  defined as the relation between parts and unity, the simplicity latent  in the infinitely complex, the potential complexity of that which is  simple. Proceeding to things visible and tangible, this indwelling  harmony, rhythm, proportion, which has its basis in geometry and  number, is seen to exist in crystals, flower forms, leaf groups, and  the like, where it is obvious; and in the more highly organized world  of the animal kingdom also; though here the geometry is latent rather  than patent, eluding though not quite defying analysis, and thus  augmenting beauty, which like a woman is alluring in proportion as she  eludes (Illustrations 51, 52, 53).    [Illustration 52: PROPORTIONS OF THE HORSE]    [Illustration 53]    By the true artist, in the crystal mirror of whose mind the universal  harmony is focused and reflected, this secret of the cause and "]]]
