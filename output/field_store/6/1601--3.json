[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11716"],[0,"The Balkans: A History of Bulgaria—Serbia—Greece—Rumania—Turkey (#10)"],[1,"urope, the connexion between Bulgaria and Russia is  infinitesimal. Politically, both Russia and Bulgaria aiming at the same  thing, the possession of Constantinople and the hegemony of the Balkan  peninsula, their relations were bound to be difficult.    The first Bulgarian Parliament met in 1879 under trying conditions. Both  Russian and Bulgarian hopes had been dashed by the Treaty of Berlin.  Russian influence was still paramount, however, and the viceroy controlled  the organization of the administration. An ultra-democratic constitution  was arranged for, a fact obviously not conducive to the successful  government of their country by the quite inexperienced Bulgarians. For a  ruler recourse had inevitably to be had to the rabbit-warren of Germanic  princes, who were still ingenuously considered neutral both in religion  and in politics. The choice fell on Prince Alexander of Battenberg, nephew  of the Empress of Russia, who had taken part in the campaign of the  Russian army. Prince Alexander was conscientious, energetic, and  enthusiastic, but he was no diplomat, and from the outset his honesty  precluded his success. From the very first he failed to keep on good terms  with Russia or its representatives, who at that time were still numerous  in Bulgaria, while he was helpless to stem the ravages of parliamentary  government. The Emperor Alexander III, who succeeded his father Alexander  II in 1881, recommended him to insist on being made dictator, which he  successfully did. But when he found that this only meant an increase of  Russian influence he reverted to parliamentary government (in September  1883); this procedure discomfited the representatives of Russia,  discredited him with the Emperor, and threw him back into the vortex of  party warfare, from which he never extricated himself.    Meanwhile the question of eastern Rumelia, or rather southern Bulgaria,  still a Turkish province, began to loom. A vigorous agitation for the  reunion of the two parts of the country had been going on for some time,  and on September 18, 1885, the inhabitants of Philippopolis suddenly  proclaimed the union under Prince Alexander, who solemnly announced his  approval at Tirnovo and triumphantly entered their city on September 21.  Russia frowned on this independence of spirit. Serbia, under King Milan,  and instigated by Austria, inaugurated the policy which has so often been  followed since, and claimed territorial compensation for Bulgaria's  aggrandisement; it must be remembered that it was Bismarck who, by the  Treaty of Berlin, had arbitrarily confined Serbia to its inadequate limits  of those day.    On November 13 King Milan declared war, and began to march on Sofia, which  is not far from the Serbo-Bulgarian frontier. Prince Alexander, the bulk  of whose army was on the Turkish frontier, boldly took up the challenge.  On November 18 took place the battle of Slivnitsa, a small town about  twenty miles north-west of Sofia, in which the Bulgarians were completely  victorious. Prince Alexander, after hard fighting, took Pirot in Serbia on  November 27, having refused King Milan's request for an armistice, and was  marching on Nish, when Austria intervened, and threatened to send troops  into Serbia unless fighting ceased. Bulgaria had to obey, and on March 3,  1886, a barren treaty of peace was imposed on the belligerents at  Bucarest. Prince Alexander's position did not improve after this, indeed  it would have needed a much more skilful navigator to steer through the  many currents which eddied round him. A strong Russophile party formed  itself in the army; on the night of August 21, 1886, some officers of this  party, who were the most capable in the Bulgarian army, appeared at Sofia,  forced Alexander to resign, and abducted him; they put him on board his  yacht on the Danube and escorted him to the Russian town of Reni, in  Bessarabia; telegraphic orders came from St. Petersburg, in answer to  inquiries, that he could proceed with haste to western Europe, and on  August 26 he found himself at Lemberg. But those who had carried out this  _coup d'etat_ found that it was not at all popular in the country. A  counter-revolution, headed by the statesman Stambulov, was immediately  initiated, and on September 3 Prince Alexander reappeared in Sofia amidst  tumultuous applause. Nevertheless his position was hopeless; the Emperor  Alexander III forced him to abdicate, and on September 7, 1886, he left  Bulgaria for good, to the regret of the majority of the people. He died in  Austria, in 1893, in his thirty-seventh year. At his departure a regency  was constituted, at the head of which was Stambulov.        12    _The Regeneration under Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg,_ 1886-1908      Stambulov was born at Tirnovo in 1854 and was of humble origin. He took  part in the insurrection of 1876 and in the war of liberation, and in 1884  became president of the Sobraniye (Parliament). From 1886 till 1894 he was  virtually dictator of Bulgaria. He was intensely patriotic and also  personally ambitious, determined, energetic, ruthlessly cruel and  unscrupulous, but incapable of deceit; these qualities were apparent in  his powerful and grim expression of face, while his manner inspired the  weak with terror and the strongest with respect. His policy in general was  directed against Russia. At the general election held in October 1886 he  had all his important opponents imprisoned beforehand, while armed  sentries discouraged ill-disposed voters from approaching the  ballot-boxes. Out of 522 elected deputies, there were 470 supporters of  Stambulov. This implied the complete suppression of the Russophile party  and led to a rupture with St. Petersburg.    Whatever were Stambulov's methods, and few would deny that they were  harsh, there is no doubt that something of the sort was necessary to  restore order in the country. But once having started on this path he  found it difficult to stop, and his tyrannical bearing, combined with the  delay in finding a prince, soon made him unpopular. There were several  revolutionary outbreaks directed against him, but these were all crushed.  At length the, at that time not particularly alluring, throne of Bulgaria  was filled by Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg, who was born in 1861 and  was the son of the gifted Princess Clementine of Bourbon-Orleans, daughter  of Louis-Philippe. This young man combined great ambition and tenacity of  purpose with extreme prudence, astuteness, and patience; he was a  consummate diplomat. The election of this prince was viewed with great  disfavour by Russia, and for fear of offending the Emperor Alexander III  none of the European powers recognized him.    Ferdinand, unabashed, cheerfully installed himself in Sofia with his  mother in July 1886, and took care to make the peace with his suzerain,  the Sultan Abdul Hamid. He wisely left all power in the hands of the  unattractive and to him, unsympathetic prime minister, Stambulov, till he  himself felt secure in his position, and till the dictator should have  made himself thoroughly hated. Ferdinand's clever and wealthy mother cast  a beneficent and civilizing glow around him, smoothing away many  difficulties by her womanly tact and philanthropic activity, and, thanks  to his influential connexions in the courts of Europe and his attitude of  calm expectancy, his prestige in his own country rapidly increased. In  1893 he married Princess Marie-Louise of Bourbon-Parma. In May 1894, as a  result of a social misadventure in which he became involved, Stambulov  sent in his resignation, confidently expecting a refusal. To his  mortification it was accepted; thereupon he initiated a violent press  campaign, but his halo had faded, and on July 15 he was savagely attacked  in the street by unknown men, who afterwards escaped, and he died three  days later. So intense were the emotions of the people that his grave had  to be guarded by the military for two months. In November 1894 followed  the death of the Emperor Alexander III, and as a result of this double  event the road to a reconciliation with Russia was opened. Meanwhile the  German Emperor, who was on good terms with Princess Clementine, had paved  the way for Ferdinand at Vienna, and when, in March 1896, the Sultan  recognized him as Prince of Bulgaria and Governor-General of eastern  Rumelia, his international position was assured. Relations with Russia  were still further improved by the rebaptism of the infant Crown Prince  Boris according to the rites of the eastern Church, in February 1896, and  a couple of years later Ferdinand and his wife and child paid a highly  successful state visit to Peterhof. In September 1902 a memorial church  was erected by the Emperor Nicholas II at the Shipka Pass, and later an  equestrian statue of the Tsar-Liberator Alexander II was placed opposite  the House of Parliament in Sofia.    Bulgaria meanwhile had been making rapid and astonishing material  progress. Railways were built, exports increased, and the general  condition of the country greatly improved. It is the fashion to compare  the wonderful advance made by Bulgaria during the thirty-five years of its  new existence with the very much slower progress made by Serbia during a  much longer period. This is insisted on especially by publicists in  Austria-Hungary and Germany, but it is forgotten that even before the last  Balkan war the geographical position of Bulgaria with its seaboard was  much more favourable to its economic development than that of Serbia,  which the Treaty of Berlin had hemmed in by Turkish and Austro-Hungarian  territory; moreover, Bulgaria being double the size of the Serbia of those  days, had far greater resources upon which to draw.    From 1894 onwards Ferdinand's power in his own country and his influence  abroad had been steadily growing. He always appreciated the value of  railways, and became almost as great a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11718"],[0,"The Camp Fire Girls at School; Or, The Wohelo Weavers (#10)"],[1,"the first lady.    \"Possibly I had better not ask Mrs. Evans for any subscription at all.  It might embarrass her, poor thing.\" The voices trailed off and Mrs.  Evans was left feeling decidedly annoyed. She was the kind of woman who  rarely discussed other people's affairs, and likewise disliked having  her own discussed by other people. The thought that some folks might  misconstrue Gladys's entering the public school to mean that her father  was about to fail in business, first amused, and then irritated her.  Nothing like that could be farther from correct, but the thought came to  her that such rumors floating around might have some effect on Mr.  Evans's standing in the business world. She began to wonder if after all  it had not been a mistake to take Gladys out of Miss Russell's school in  the middle of her course.    Thinking cynical thoughts about the gossiping abilities of most people,  she drove up the long driveway and entered the house. The long hall with  its wide staircase and large, splendidly furnished rooms opening on  either side, struck her as being cold and gloomy. The polished chairs  and tables shone dully in the fast waning light of the December  afternoon, cheerless and unfriendly looking. The house suddenly seemed  to her to be less a home than a collection of furniture. For the moment  she almost hated the wealth which made it necessary to maintain this  vast and magnificent display. The women she had played cards with that  afternoon seemed shallow and artificial. Life was decidedly  uninteresting just then. She went upstairs and took off her wraps and  came down again, aimlessly. Gladys was nowhere in sight, which made the  house seem lonelier than ever, for with Gladys around there would have  been somebody to talk to. At the foot of the stairs she paused. She  could hear some one singing in a distant part of the house. \"Katy's  happy, anyway,\" she said with a sigh, \"if she feels like singing in that  hot kitchen,\" A desire for company led her out to the kitchen. It was  not Katy, however, who greeted her when she opened the door. It was  Gladys--Gladys with a big apron on and her sleeves rolled up, just  taking from the oven a pan of golden brown muffins. The room was filled  with the delicious odor of freshly baked dough.    Gladys looked up with a smile when she saw her mother in the doorway.  \"How do you like the new cook?\" she asked. \"Katy went home sick this  afternoon and I thought I would get supper myself.\" The kitchen looked  so cheerful and inviting that Mrs. Evans came in and sat down. Gladys  began mixing up potatoes for croquettes.    \"Can't I do something?\" asked her mother.    \"Why, yes,\" said Gladys, bringing out another apron and tying it around  her waist, \"you heat the fat to fry these in.\" Mrs. Evans and Gladys had  never had such a good time together. Gladys had planned the entire menu  and her mother meekly followed her directions as to what to do next. She  and Gladys frolicked around the kitchen with increasing hilarity as the  supper progressed. Never before had there existed such a comradeship  between them.    \"Do you think this is seasoned right?\" asked Mrs. Evans, holding out a  spoonful of white sauce for Gladys to taste.    \"A little more salt,\" said Gladys judicially. Mrs. Evans had forgotten  her irritation of the afternoon. The conversation which had aroused her  ire before now struck her as humorous.    \"If Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Jones could only see me now,\" she thought with  an inward chuckle, \"doing my own cooking!\" The half-formed plan of  sending Gladys back to Miss Russell's the first of the year faded from  her mind. Send Gladys away? Why, she was just beginning to enjoy her  company! Another plan presented itself to her mind. In the Christmas  vacation Gladys should give a party which would forever dispel any  doubts about the soundness of their financial standing. Her brain was  already at work on the details. Gladys should have a dress from Madame  Charmant's in New York. They would have Waldstein, from the Symphony  Orchestra, with a half dozen of his best players, furnish the music.  There would be expensive prizes and favors for the games. Mrs. Davis and  Mrs. Jones would have a chance to alter their opinions when their  daughters brought home accounts of the affair. She planned the whole  thing while she was eating her supper.    After supper Gladys washed the dishes and her mother wiped them, and  they put them away together. Then Gladys began to get ready to go to  Camp Fire meeting and Mrs. Evans reluctantly prepared to go out for the  evening. The nearer ready she was the more disinclined she felt to go.  \"Those Jamieson musicales are always such a bore,\" she said to herself  wearily. \"They never have good singers--my Gladys could do better than  any of them--and they are interminable. Father looks tired to death, and  I know he would rather stay at home. Gladys,\" she called, looking into  her daughter's room, \"where is your Camp Fire meeting to-night?\"    \"At the Brewsters',\" answered Gladys.    \"Do you ever have visitors?\" continued her mother.    \"Why, yes,\" answered Gladys, \"we often do.\"    \"Do you mind if you have one to-night?\" asked Mrs. Evans.    \"Certainly not,\" replied Gladys.    \"Well, then, I'm coming along,\" said her mother.    \"Will you?\" cried Gladys. \"Oh goody!\" The Winnebagos were surprised and  delighted when Mrs. Evans appeared with Gladys. Since that Saturday's  outing she had held a very warm place in their affections.    \"Come in, mother,\" called Sahwah; \"you might as well join the group too,  we have one guest. This is Mrs. Evans, Gladys's mother,\" she said, when  her mother appeared after hastily brushing back her hair and putting on  a white apron. The two women held out their hands in formal greeting,  and then changed their minds and fell on each other's necks.    \"Why, Molly Richards!\" exclaimed Mrs. Evans.    \"Why, Helen Adamson!\" gasped Mrs. Brewster. The Winnebagos looked on,  mystified.    \"You can't introduce me to your mother,\" said Mrs. Evans to Sahwah,  laughing at her look of surprise. \"We were good friends when we were  younger than you. Do you remember the time,\" she said, turning back to  Mrs. Brewster, \"when you drew a picture of Miss Scully in your history  and she found it and made you stand up in front of the room and hold it  up so the whole class could see it?\"    \"Do you remember the time,\" returned Mrs. Brewster, \"when we ran away  from school to see the Lilliputian bazaar and your mother was there and  walked you out by the ear?\" Thus the flow of reminiscences went on.    \"How little I thought,\" said Mrs. Evans, \"when I first saw Sarah Ann  going around with Gladys, that she was your daughter!\"    \"How little I thought,\" said Mrs. Brewster, \"when Gladys began coming  here, that she was _your_ daughter!\"    \"How many more of these girls' mothers are our old schoolmates, I  wonder?\" said Mrs. Evans.    \"Let's meet them and find out,\" said Mrs. Brewster. \"Here, you girls,\"  she said, \"every one of you go home and get your mother.\" Delightedly  the girls obeyed, and the mothers came, a little backward, some of them,  a little shy, pathetically eager, and decidedly breathless. Migwan's  mother, Mrs. Gardiner, had known Mrs. Brewster in her girlhood, and  Nakwisi's mother had known Mrs. Evans, and Chapa's and Medmangi's  mothers had known each other. What a happy reunion that was, and what a  chorus of \"Don't you remembers\" rose on every side! Tears mingled with  the laughter when they spoke of the death of Mrs. Bradford, whom most of  them had known in their school days.    \"Do you remember,\" said one of the mothers, \"how we used to go coasting  down the reservoir hill? You girls have never seen the old reservoir. It  was levelled off years ago.\"    \"I'd enjoy going coasting yet,\" said Mrs. Brewster.    \"Let's!\" said Mrs. Evans. \"The snow is just right.\"    Girls and mothers hurried into their coats and out into the frosty air.  The street sloped down sharply, and the middle of the road was filled  with flying bobsleds, as the young people of the neighborhood took  advantage of the snowy crust. Sahwah brought out her brother's bob,  which he was not using this evening, and piled the whole company on  behind her. She could steer as well as a boy. Down the long street they  shot, from one patch of light into another as they passed the lamp  posts. The mothers shrieked with excitement and held on for dear life.  \"Oh,\" panted Mrs. Brewster when they came to a standstill at the bottom  of the slope, \"is there anything in the world half so exciting and  delightful as coasting?\" Down they went, again and again, laughing all  the way, and causing many another bobload to look around and wonder who  the jolly ladies were. Most of the mothers lost their breath in the  swift rush and had to be helped up the hill to the starting point. Once  Sahwah turned too short at the bottom of the street and upset the whole  sledful into a deep pile of snow, from which they emerged looking like  snowmen. \"Oh-h-h,\" sputtered Mrs. Brewster, \"the snow is all going down  inside of my collar! Sarah Ann, you wretch, you deserve to have your  face washed for that!\" She picked up a great lump of snow and hurled it  deftly at Sahwah's head. It struck its mark and flew all to pieces, much  of it going down the back of her neck.    \"This coasting is all right,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"but, oh, that walk up  hill!\"    Mrs. Evans spied her machine standing in front of the Brewster house,  and it gave her an idea. \"Why not tie the bob to the machine,\" she said,  \"and go for a regular ride?\" This suggestion was hailed with great joy,  and carried out with alacrity.    \"Would you like to drive, mother?\" asked Gladys.    \"No, indeed!\" said her mother. \"I'm out sleigh-riding to-night. You get  in and drive it yourself!\" Gladys complied, with Migwan up beside her  for company, and away they flew up one street and down another "]]]
