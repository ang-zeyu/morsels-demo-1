That is why Maracci and  Reland could understand Jews and Christians yielding to the temptation  of joining Islam, and that also explains why Catholic and Protestant  dogmatists could accuse each other of Crypto-mohammedanism.    Not until the beginning of the tenth century A.D. did the orthodox  Mohammedan dogma begin to emerge from the clash of opinions into its  definite shape. The Mu'tazilites had advocated man's free will; had given  prominence to justice and holiness in their conception of God, had denied  distinct qualities in God and the eternity of God's Word; had accepted a  place for the neutral between Paradise and Hell; and for some time the  favour of the powers in authority seemed to assure the victory of their  system. Al-Ash'ari contradicted all these points, and his system has in the  end been adopted by the great majority. The Mu'tazilite doctrines for a  long time still enthralled many minds, but they ended by taking refuge  in the political heresy of Shi'itism. In the most conservative circles,  opponents to all speculation were never wanting; but they were obliged  unconsciously to make large concessions to systematic thought; for in the  Moslim world as elsewhere religious belief without dogma had become as  impossible as breathing is without air.    Thus, in Islam, a whole system, which could not even pretend to draw its  authority from the Sunnah, had come to be accepted. It was not difficult  to justify this deviation from the orthodox abhorrence against novelties.  Islam has always looked at the world in a pessimistic way, a view expressed  in numberless prophetic sayings. The world is bad and will become worse and  worse. Religion and morality will have to wage an ever more hopeless war  against unbelief, against heresy and ungodly ways of living. While this  is surely no reason for entering into any compromise with doctrines which  depart but a hair's breadth from Qoran and Sunnah, it necessitates methods  of defence against heresy as unknown in Mohammed's time as heresy itself.  \"Necessity knows no law\" is a principle fully accepted in Islam; and heresy  is an enemy of the faith that can only be defeated with dialectic weapons.  So the religious truths preached by Mohammed have not been altered in  any way; but under the stress of necessity they have been clad in modern  armour, which has somewhat changed their aspect.    Moreover, Islam has a theory, which alone is sufficient to justify the  whole later development of doctrine as well as of law. This theory,  whose importance for the system can hardly be overestimated, and which,  nevertheless, has until very recent times constantly been overlooked by  Western students of Islam, finds its classical expression in the following  words, put into the mouth of Mohammed: \"My community will never agree in an  error.\" In terms more familiar to us, this means that the Mohammedan Church  taken as a whole is infallible; that all the decisions on matters practical  or theoretical, on which it is agreed, are binding upon its members.  Nowhere else is the catholic instinct of Islam more clearly expressed.    A faithful Mohammedan student, after having struggled through a handbook of  law, may be vexed by a doubt as to whether these endless casuistic precepts  have been rightly deduced from the Qoran and the Sacred Tradition. His  doubt, however, will at once be silenced, if he bears in mind that Allah  speaks more plainly to him by this infallible Agreement (_Ijma'_) of the  Community than through Qoran and Tradition; nay, that the contents of both  those sacred sources, without this perfect intermediary, would be to a  great extent unintelligible to him. Even the differences between the  schools of law may be based on this theory of the Ijma'; for, does not the  infallible Agreement of the Community teach us that a certain diversity  of opinion is a merciful gift of God? It was through the Agreement that  dogmatic speculations as well as minute discussions about points of law  became legitimate. The stamp of Ijma' was essential to every rule of faith  and life, to all manners and customs.    All sorts of religious ideas and practices, which could not possibly be  deduced from Mohammed's message, entered the Moslim world by the permission  of Ijma'. Here we need think only of mysticism and of the cult of saints.    Some passages of the Qoran may perhaps be interpreted in such a way that we  hear the subtler strings of religious emotion vibrating in them. The chief  impression that Mohammed's Allah makes before the Hijrah is that of awful  majesty, at which men tremble from afar; they fear His punishment, dare  hardly be sure of His reward, and hope much from His mercy. This impression  is a lasting one; but, after the Hijrah, Allah is also heard quietly  reasoning with His obedient servants, giving them advice and commands,  which they have to follow in order to frustrate all resistance to His  authority and to deserve His satisfaction. He is always the Lord, the King  of the world, who speaks to His humble servants. But the lamp which Allah  had caused Mohammed to hold up to guide mankind with its light, was raised  higher and higher after the Prophet's death, in order to shed its light  over an ever increasing part of humanity. This was not possible, however,  without its reservoir being replenished with all the different kinds of oil  that had from time immemorial given light to those different nations. The  oil of mysticism came from Christian circles, and its Neo-Platonic origin  was quite unmistakable; Persia and India also contributed to it. There were  those who, by asceticism, by different methods of mortifying the flesh,  liberated the spirit that it might rise and become united with the origin  of all being; to such an extent, that with some the profession of faith  was reduced to the blasphemous exclamation: \"I am Allah.\" Others tried to  become free from the sphere of the material and the temporal by certain  methods of thought, combined or not combined with asceticism. Here the  necessity of guidance was felt, and congregations came into existence,  whose purpose it was to permit large groups of people under the leadership  of their sheikhs, to participate simultaneously in the mystic union. The  influence which spread most widely was that of leaders like Ghazali, the  Father of the later Mohammedan Church, who recommended moral purification  of the soul as the only way by which men should come nearer to God. His  mysticism wished to avoid the danger of pantheism, to which so many others  were led by their contemplations, and which so often engendered disregard  of the revealed law, or even of morality. Some wanted to pass over the gap  between the Creator and the created along a bridge of contemplation; and  so, driven by the fire of sublime passion, precipitate themselves towards  the object of their love, in a kind of rapture, which poets compare with  intoxication. The evil world said that the impossibility to accomplish this  heavenly union often induced those people to imitate it for the time being  with the earthly means of wine and the indulgence in sensual love.    Characteristic of all these sorts of mysticism is their esoteric pride.  All those emotions are meant only for a small number of chosen ones. Even  Ghazali's ethical mysticism is not for the multitude. The development of  Islam as a whole, from the Hijrah on, has always been greater in breadth  than in depth; and, consequently, its pedagogics have remained defective.  Even some of the noblest minds in Islam restrict true religious life to an  aristocracy, and accept the ignorance of the multitude as an irremediable  evil.    Throughout the centuries pantheistic and animistic forms of mysticism have  found many adherents among the Mohammedans; but the infallible Agreement  has persisted in calling that heresy. Ethical mysticism, since Ghazali, has  been fully recognized; and, with law and dogma, it forms the sacred trio of  sciences of Islam, to the study of which the Arabic humanistic arts  serve as preparatory instruments. All other sciences, however useful and  necessary, are of this world and have no value for the world to come. The  unfaithful appreciate and study them as well as do the Mohammedans; but,  on Mohammedan soil they must be coloured with a Mohammedan hue, and their  results may never clash with the three religious sciences. Physics,  astronomy, and philosophy have often found it difficult to observe this  restriction, and therefore they used to be at least slightly suspected in  pious circles.    Mysticism did not only owe to Ijma' its place in the sacred trio, but it  succeeded, better than dogmatics, in confirming its right with words of  Allah and His Prophet. In Islam mysticism and allegory are allied in the  usual way; for the _illuminati_ the words had quite a different meaning  than for common, every-day people. So the Qoran was made to speak the  language of mysticism; and mystic commentaries of the Holy Book exist,  which, with total disregard for philological and historical objections,  explain the verses of the Revelation as expressions of the profoundest soul  experiences. Clear utterances in this spirit were put into the Prophet's  mouth; and, like the canonists, the leaders on the mystic Way to God  boasted of a spiritual genealogy which went back to Mohammed. Thus the  Prophet is said to have declared void all knowledge and fulfillment of the  law which lacks mystic experience.    Of course only \"true\" mysticism is justified by Ijma' and confirmed by the  evidence of Qoran and Sunnah; but, about the bounds between \"true\" and  \"false\" or heretical mysticism, there exists in a large measure the  well-known diversity of opinion allowed by God's grace. The ethical  mysticism of al-Ghazali is generally recognized as orthodox; and the  possibility of attaining to a higher spiritual sphere by means"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10166"],[0,"What Germany Thinks; Or, The War as Germans see it (#10)"],[1,"move in a crisis which would disturb the balance of power in  the Balkans and in Europe. It was merely these rights which Russia  throughout the crisis endeavoured to establish; if they had been  recognized there would have been no war.    In order to prove what the Austro-German standpoint was, and that from  first to last never changed, reference must be made to the Austrian Red  Book.[27] On page 24: Sir Edward Grey was informed by Count Mensdorf on  July 24th, \"and I (Mensdorf) repeated to him (Grey) many times, that we  should stick to that view.\"    [Footnote 27: Oesterreichisch-ungarisches Rotbuch. Vienna, 1915.]    Page 25. Count Czecsen in Paris informed French Minister: \"It is a  question which can only be settled between Serbia and ourselves,\" on  July 24th.    On the same day the Austrian Ambassador emphasized the same point in an  interview with the Russian Foreign Minister--pp. 27-8.    During the evening Monsieur Sasonow had interviews with both the German  and Austrian Ambassadors. The latter telegraphed to Vienna: \"My German  colleague at once pointed out to M. Sasonow that Austria would not  accept any interference in her differences with Serbia and that Germany  would also not permit it.\"--p. 29.    That gives the situation in its simplest form, and without making  further quotations, it will suffice to cite the dates on which it was  re-emphasized:      July 25th  in St. Petersburg,   p. 89      \"  27th  \"  \"       \"         p. 101      \"  28th  \" Berlin by Germany, p. 116      \"   \"    \" London by Austria, p. 123      \"  29th  \" St. Petersburg, \"  p. 128      \"  30th  \" Berlin,         \"  p. 130      \"  30th  \" St. Petersburg, \"  p. 131      \"  31st  \" Vienna,         \"  p. 133    August 1st \" St. Petersburg, \"  p. 136    Moreover, no less a personage than the Kaiser's brother confirmed this  view. In Prince Heinrich's telegram to the King of England, July 30th,  the following passage occurs: \"If you really and sincerely wish to  prevent this terrible misfortune (a European war), may I propose that  you should exercise your influence on France and Russia to keep them  both neutral (in the Austro-Serbian quarrel). In my opinion this would  be of the greatest service. I consider this a certain means and perhaps  _the only possibility of preserving European peace_.\"    Prince Heinrich expressed no hope that Austria could be persuaded to  make any concession, but merely requested King George to exercise his  influence to get Russia to accept a position impossible to herself and  incompatible with the balance of power in Europe.    The rock of Germanic obstinacy was seated in Vienna, whether Germany was  the prime mover in erecting it remains to be proved. Germany knew full  well that European peace would be shattered on that rock, yet there is  no fragment of evidence to show that she tried to remove it; but there  is overwhelming proof that she encouraged Austria to stand by it, thus  causing a European conflagration.    And as if the above were insufficient to prove that the German Imperial  Chancellor was guilty of conscious falsification, Austria put one more  nail in the coffin of European peace on September 24th, 1914, when it  issued an official communication to the Press, reiterating that Austria  had never dreamed of departing from the attitude which she first took  up.[28]    [Footnote 28: \"Die Schuld am Weltkriege\" (\"The Guilt for the World  War\"), by an Austrian. Vienna, 1915, p. 59.]    Germany's aim was to employ the Serajewo crime as a lever to put Russia,  as a vital force, out of the domain of European politics. In spite of  denials, there is reason to believe that Austria was inclined to listen  to reason, but Germany forestalled and prevented this by despatching an  ultimatum to Russia and then declaring war.    A few other points in Bethmann-Hollweg's speech deserve brief notice. He  quotes Germany's threats, but not one word from the peaceful overtures  which were so often mentioned. He fails to cite any single point which  Austria had yielded at Germany's advice. Further, no proof of Germany's  vaunted \"mediatory action\" is discoverable either in the speech or the  diplomatic documents published by the Central Powers.    In regard to his justification of the violation of Belgian neutrality,  the civilized world has already passed judgment, and in this place it  only remains to point out that the four hundred members of the Reichstag  cheered the Chancellor's announcement. This alone is a sufficiently  severe comment on the conceptions of right and justice which direct the  proceedings of Germany's highest legislative body.    It evidently did not occur to the Reichstag or Germany's Imperial  Chancellor that, if necessity knows no law which respects a neutrality  guaranteed by Germany, then at a later date necessity would also  recognize no law which protected Belgian territory after Germany had  conquered it. A lamb in the jaws of a lion is in a truly dangerous  position, and although the outlook may be black, it is still wiser for  the lamb to try and avoid the lion's jaws.    Bethmann-Hollweg saw the mote of Greater-Serbianism in Serbia's eye, but  he was peculiarly anxious not to perceive the beam of Pan-Germanism  which has blinded Germany's vision for a generation, and is the one and  only cause for the rapid increase in European armaments.    Before consigning the German Chancellor's Pecksniffian oration to  well-deserved oblivion, there is one other fact to state, because it is  of immediate interest to Great Britain. In the person of  Bethmann-Hollweg the German Government stood before the world on August  4th, 1914, and endeavoured to prove that Germany was attacked, and that  her conscience was clear. There are even Britons who have got stuck in  Bethmann-Hollweg's peace-lime. Yet it would be interesting if the German  Government would explain why the civilian population was ordered to  leave Heligoland on the afternoon of Friday, July 31st. They were  allowed twenty-four hours within which to leave the island, and one who  was in the exodus describes the scene in the _Leipziger Neueste  Nachrichten_ for August 12th. Early on Saturday morning the civilians  proceeded on to the landing-stage, where several steamers were waiting.  \"Suddenly the _Koenigin Luise_ started off without taking any passengers  on board, and soon disappeared under full steam.\"    This was the boat which laid mines round the mouth of the Thames.  Although the German Chancellor protested his desire for peace with  England as late as August 4th, it seems quite evident from the events in  Heligoland that war with this country had been decided upon on July  31st.          CHAPTER IV    MOBILIZATION      \"Munich.--Evening after evening masses of people thronged the streets.  The heavy, oppressive atmosphere weighed upon the spirit--a leaden  pressure which increased with every hour. Then came the stirring events  on the evening of July 3ist, when the drums beat 'general march' on the  Marienplatz, and a commissioner read the articles of war to a crowd  numbered by thousands. Thirty drummers and commissioners in motors  rushed through the streets of the city.    \"On Saturday evening, August 1st, the general order for mobilization was  proclaimed from the offices of the _Muenchener Neuesten Nachrichten_. A  deep solemnity fell upon the masses of spectators and the crowd fell  into rank to march to the Royal Palace, from a window of which King  Ludwig spoke words of comfort and inspiration. Still singing the 'Wacht  am Rhein,' this river of humanity flowed on to the 'Englischen Garten,'  at the corner of which stands the Austrian Legation. A gentleman  addressed the representative of our beloved ally, who sounded in his  reply the note of 'faithfulness unto death.'    \"And now from out the stifling depression of the leaden weight of the  previous days there arose a terrible, united will, a single mighty  thought. The whole of a great and powerful people was aroused, fired by  one solemn resolve--to act; advance on the enemy, and smash him to the  earth!    \"Dresden.--I was sitting in the garden of a suburban restaurant; above  me were the dark masses of chestnut trees, while before us, above the  railway, was a long strip of bright, summer-night sky. There seemed to  be something gloomy and uncanny in the air; the lamps blinked  maliciously; a spirit of still expectation rested on the people; furtive  glances were cast from time to time at the near embankment. Military  trains were expected, and we listened nervously to the noises of the  night. The first troop-transports; where were they going--against Russia  or to the French frontier? It was whispered that the troops would only  be transported by night.    \"At last a pounding thud came through the stillness of the night, and  soon two colossal engines were silhouetted against the sky, like  fire-spitting monsters. Their roar seemed more sinister than usual.  Heavy forebodings rumbled out in the rocking and rolling of the endless  coaches--the clang of a future, pregnant with death and pain. Suddenly  the tables were empty; everyone rushed towards the lighted compartments  of the train, and a scene of indescribable jubilation followed as train  after train of armed men rushed by into the night.    \"Sometimes a troubled father was heard to exclaim: 'If only the first  battles were fought and won!' Yet calm confidence prevailed from the  very beginning. But the sight of the quiet, machine-like completion of  the mobilization strengthened our trust, even though a justifiable  indignation and rage filled our hearts at Europe's dastardly attack on  the Central States. Hate flamed highest, however, when England declared  war against us.    \"There are several reasons for this. In the north of Germany, the  Englishman is looked upon as the European who stands nearest the German,  and with whom we have the most sympathy. His personal reliability and "]]]
