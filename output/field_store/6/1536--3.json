Footmen in boots and breeches sit as stiffly as  though they were toys grown large and had metal spikes below to hold them  to their boxes. They look like the iron firemen that ride on nursery  fire-engines. For all these sights the bus top is the best place.    And although we sit on a modest roof, the shopkeepers cater to us. For in  many of the stores, is there not an upper tier of windows for our use? The  commodities of this second story are quite as fine as those below. And the  waxen beauties who display the frocks greet us in true democracy with as  sweet a simper.    My friend G---- while riding recently on a bus top met with an experience  for which he still blushes.    There was a young woman sitting directly in front of him, and when he came  to leave, a sudden lurch threw him against her. When he recovered his  footing, which was a business of some difficulty, for the bus pitched upon  a broken pavement, what was his chagrin to find that a front button of  his coat had hooked in her back hair! Luckily G---- was not seized with a  panic. Rather, he labored cautiously--but without result. Nor could  she help in the disentanglement. Their embarrassment might have been  indefinitely prolonged--indeed, G---- was several blocks already down the  street--when he bethought him of his knife and so cut off the button. As he  pleasantly expressed it to the young woman, he would give her the choice of  the button or the coat entire.    Reader, are you inclined toward ferry boats? I cannot include those persons  who journey on them night and morning perfunctorily. These persons keep  their noses in their papers or sit snugly in the cabin. If the market is  up, they can hardly be conscious even that they are crossing a river.  Nor do I entirely blame them. If one kept shop on a breezy tip of the  Delectable Mountains with all the regions of the world laid out below,  he could not be expected to climb up for the hundredth time with a first  exhilaration, or to swing his alpenstock as though he were on a rare  holiday. If one had business across the Styx too often--although the  scenery on its banks is reputed to be unusual--he might in time sit below  and take to yawning. Father Charon might have to jog his shoulder to rouse  him when the boat came between the further piers.    But are you one of those persons who, not being under a daily compulsion,  rides upon a ferry boat for the love of the trip? Being in this class  myself, I laid my case the other night before the gateman, and asked  his advice regarding routes. He at once entered sympathetically into my  distemper and gave me a plan whereby with but a single change of piers  I might at an expense of fourteen cents cross the river four times at  different angles.    It was at the end of day and a light fog rested on the water. Nothing was  entirely lost, yet a gray mystery wrapped the ships and buildings. If New  Jersey still existed it was dim and shadowy as though its real life had  gone and but a ghost remained. Ferry boats were lighted in defiance of the  murk, and darted here and there at reckless angles. An ocean liner was  putting out, and several tugs had rammed their noses against her sides.  There is something engaging about a tug. It snorts with eagerness. It kicks  and splashes. It bursts itself to lend a hand. And how it butts with its  nose! Surely its forward cartilages are of triple strength, else in its  zest it would jam its nasal passages.    Presently we came opposite lower New York. Although the fog concealed the  outlines of the buildings, their lights showed through. This first hour of  dark is best, before the day's work is done and while as yet all of the  windows are lighted. The Woolworth Tower was suffused in a soft and shadowy  light. The other buildings showed like mountains of magic pin-pricks. It  was as though all the constellations of heaven on a general bidding had met  for conference.    The man of Grub Street, having by this time somewhat dispelled the fumes of  dullness from his head, descends from his ferry boat and walks to his quiet  park. There is a dull roar from the elevated railway on Third Avenue where  the last of the day's crowd goes home. The sidewalks are becoming empty.  There is a sheen of water on the pavement. In the winter murk there is a  look of Thackeray about the place as though the Sedleys or the Osbornes  might be his neighbors. If there were a crest above his bell-pull he might  even expect Becky Sharp in for tea.          Now that Spring is here      When the sun set last night it was still winter. The persons who passed  northward in the dusk from the city's tumult thrust their hands deep into  their pockets and walked to a sharp measure. But a change came in the  night. The north wind fell off and a breeze blew up from the south. Such  stars as were abroad at dawn left off their shrill winter piping--if it be  true that stars really sing in their courses--and pitched their voices to  April tunes. One star in particular that hung low in the west until the day  was up, knew surely that the Spring had come and sang in concert with the  earliest birds. There is a dull belief that these early birds shake off  their sleep to get the worm. Rather, they come forth at this hour to cock  their ears upon the general heavens for such new tunes as the unfaded  stars still sing. If an ear is turned down to the rummage of worms in the  earth--for to the superficial, so does the attitude attest--it is only that  the other ear may be turned upward to catch the celestial harmonies; for  birds know that if there is an untried melody in heaven it will sound first  across the clear pastures of the dawn. All the chirping and whistling  from the fields and trees are then but the practice of the hour. When the  meadowlark sings on a fence-rail she but cons her lesson from the stars.    It is on such a bright Spring morning that the housewife, duster in hand,  throws open her parlor window and looks upon the street. A pleasant park is  below, of the size of a city square, and already it stirs with the day's  activity. The housewife beats her cloth upon the sill and as the dust flies  off, she hears the cries and noises of the place. In a clear tenor she  is admonished that there is an expert hereabouts to grind her knives. A  swarthy baritone on a wagon lifts up his voice in praise of radishes and  carrots. His eye roves along the windows. The crook of a hungry finger will  bring him to a stand. Or a junkman is below upon his business. Yesterday  the bells upon his cart would have sounded sour, but this morning they  rattle agreeably, as though a brisker cow than common, springtime in her  hoofs, were jangling to her pasture. At the sound--if you are of country  training--you see yourself, somewhat misty through the years, barefoot in a  grassy lane, with stick in hand, urging the gentle beast. There is a subtle  persuasion in the junkman's call. In these tones did the magician, bawling  for old lamps, beguile Aladdin. If there were this morning in my lodging an  unrubbed lamp, I would toss it from the window for such magic as he might  extract from it. And if a fair Princess should be missing at the noon and  her palace be skipped from sight, it will follow on the rubbing of it.    The call of red cherries in the park--as you might guess from its Italian  source--is set to an amorous tune. What lady, smocked in morning cambric,  would not be wooed by such a voice? The gay fellow tempts her to a  purchase. It is but a decent caution--now that Spring is here--that the  rascal does not call his wares by moonlight. As for early peas this  morning, it is Pan himself who peddles them--disguised and smirched lest  he be caught in the deception--Pan who stamps his foot and shakes the  thicket--whose habit is to sing with reedy voice of the green willows that  dip in sunny waters. Although he now clatters his tins and baskets and  cries out like a merchant, his thoughts run to the black earth and the  shady hollows and the sound of little streams.    I have wondered as I have observed the housewives lingering at their  windows--for my window also looks upon the park--I have wondered that these  melodious street cries are not used generally for calling the wares of  wider sale. If a radish can be so proclaimed, there might be a lilt devised  in praise of other pleasing merceries--a tripping pizzicato for laces and  frippery--a brave trumpeting for some newest cereal. And should not the  latest book--if it be a tale of love, for these I am told are best offered  to the public in the Spring (sad tales are best for winter)--should not a  tale of love be heralded through the city by the singing of a ballad, with  a melting tenor in the part? In old days a gaudy rogue cried out upon the  broader streets that jugglers had stretched their rope in the market-place,  but when the bears came to town, the news was piped even to the narrowest  lanes that house-folk might bring their pennies.    With my thoughts set on the Spring I chanced to walk recently where the  theatres are thickest. It was on a Saturday afternoon and the walk was  crowded with amusement seekers. Presently in the press I observed a queer  old fellow carrying on his back a monstrous pack of umbrellas. He rang  a bell monotonously and professed himself a mender of umbrellas. He can  hardly have expected to find a customer in the crowd. Even a blinking  eye--and these street merchants are shrewd in these matters--must have told  him that in all this hurrying mass of people, the thoughts of no one ran  toward umbrellas. Rather, I think that he was taking an hour from the  routine of the day. He had trod the profitable side streets until truantry  had taken him. But he still made a pretext of working at his job and called  his wares to ease his conscience from idleness. Once when an unusually  bright beam of sunlight fell from"]]]
