Thus musing, in a wood I sat me down    Alone, continuing there to muse: the slopes    And heights meanwhile were slowly overspread    With darkness, and before a rippling breeze    The long lake lengthened out its hoary line,    And in the sheltered coppice where I sat,    Around me from among the hazel leaves,    Now here, now there, moved by the straggling wind,    Came ever and anon a breath-like sound,    Quick as the pantings of the faithful dog,    The off and on companion of my work;    And such, at times, believing them to be,    I turned my head to look if he were there;    Then into solemn thought I passed once more.      A freshness also found I at this time    In human Life, the daily life of those    Whose occupations really I loved;    The peaceful scene oft filled me with surprise,    Changed like a garden in the heat of spring    After an eight days' absence. For (to omit    The things which were the same and yet appeared    Far otherwise) amid this rural solitude.    A narrow Vale where each was known to all,    'Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind    To mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook,    Where an old man had used to sit alone,    Now vacant; pale-faced babes whom I had left    In arms, now rosy prattlers at the feet    Of a pleased grandame tottering up and down;    And growing girls whose beauty, filched away    With all its pleasant promises, was gone    To deck some slighted playmate's homely cheek.      Yes, I had something of a subtler sense,    And often looking round was moved to smiles    Such as a delicate work of humor breeds;    I read, without design, the opinions, thoughts,    Of those plain-living people now observed    With clearer knowledge; with another eye    I saw the quiet woodman in the woods,    The shepherd roam the hills. With new delight,    This chiefly, did I note my gray-haired Dame;    Saw her go forth to church or other work    Of state, equipped in monumental trim;    Short velvet cloak, (her bonnet of the like,)    A mantle such as Spanish Cavaliers    Wore in old time. Her smooth domestic life,    Affectionate without disquietude,    Her talk, her business, pleased me; and no less    Her clear though sallow stream of piety    That ran on Sabbath days a fresher course;    With thoughts unfelt till now I saw her read    Her Bible on hot Sunday afternoons,    And loved the book, when she had dropped asleep    And made of it a pillow for her head.      Nor less do I remember to have felt,    Distinctly manifested at this time,    A human-heartedness about my love    For objects hitherto the absolute wealth    Of my own private being and no more:    Which I had loved even as a blessed spirit    Or Angel, if he were to dwell on earth,    Might love in individual happiness.    But now there opened on me other thoughts    Of change, congratulation or regret,    A pensive feeling! It spread far and wide;    The trees, the mountains shared it, and the brooks,    The stars of heaven, now seen in their old haunts--    White Sirius glittering o'er the southern crags,    Orion with his belt, and those fair Seven,    Acquaintances of every little child,    And Jupiter, my own beloved star!    Whatever shadings of mortality,    Whatever imports from the world of death    Had come among these objects heretofore,    Were, in the main, of mood less tender: strong,    Deep, gloomy were they, and severe: the scatterings    Of awe or tremulous dread, that had given way    In latter youth to yearnings of a love    Enthusiastic, to delight and hope.      As one who hangs down-bending from the side    Of a slow-moving boat, upon the breast    Of a still water, solacing himself    With such discoveries as his eye can make    Beneath him in the bottom of the deep,    Sees many beauteous sights--weeds, fishes, flowers,    Grots, pebbles, roots of trees, and fancies more,    Yet often is perplexed and cannot part    The shadow from the substance, rocks and sky    Mountains and clouds, reflected in the depth    Of the clear flood, from things which there abide    In their true dwelling; now is crossed by gleam    Of his own image, by a sunbeam now,    And wavering motions sent he knows not whence,    Impediments that make his task more sweet;    Such pleasant office have we long pursued    Incumbent o'er the surface of past time    With like success, nor often have appeared    Shapes fairer or less doubtfully discerned    Than those to which the Tale, indulgent Friend!    Would now direct thy notice. Yet in spite    Of pleasure won, and knowledge not withheld,    There was an inner falling off--I loved,    Loved deeply all that had been loved before    More deeply even than ever: but a swarm    Of heady schemes jostling each other, gawds,    And feast and dance, and public revelry,    And sports and games (too grateful in themselves,    Yet in themselves less grateful, I believe,    Than as they were a badge glossy and fresh    Of manliness and freedom) all conspired    To lure my mind from firm habitual quest    Of feeding pleasures, to depress the zeal    And damp those yearnings which had once been mine--    A wild, unworldly-minded youth, given up    To his own eager thoughts. It would demand    Some skill, and longer time than may be spared,    To paint these vanities, and how they wrought    In haunts where they, till now, had been unknown.    It seemed the very garments that they wore    Preyed on my strength, and stopped the quiet stream    Of self-forgetfulness.              Yes, that heartless chase    Of trivial pleasures was a poor exchange    For books and nature at that early age.    'Tis true, some casual knowledge might be gained    Of character or life; but at that time,    Of manners put to school I took small note,    And all my deeper passions lay elsewhere.    Far better had it been to exalt the mind    By solitary study, to uphold    Intense desire through meditative peace;    And yet, for chastisement of these regrets,    The memory of one particular hour    Doth here rise up against me. 'Mid a throng    Of maids and youths, old men, and matrons staid,    A medley of all tempers, I had passed    The night in dancing, gayety, and mirth,    With din of instruments and shuffling feet,    And glancing forms, and tapers glittering,    And unaimed prattle flying up and down;    Spirits upon the stretch, and here and there    Slight shocks of young love-liking interspersed,    Whose transient pleasure mounted to the head,    And tingled through the veins. Ere we retired    The cock had crowed, and now the eastern sky    Was kindling, not unseen, from humble copse    And open field, through which the pathway wound,    And homeward led my steps. Magnificent    The morning rose, in memorable pomp,    Glorious as e'er I had beheld--in front,    The sea lay laughing at a distance; near,    The solid mountains shone, bright as the clouds,    Grain-tinctured, drenched in Empyrean light;    And in the meadows and the lower grounds    Was all the sweetness of a common dawn--    Dews, vapors, and the melody of birds,    And laborers going forth to till the fields.      Ah! need I say, dear Friend! that to the brim    My heart was full; I made no vows, but vows    Were then made for me; bond unknown to me    Was given, that I should be, else sinning greatly,    A dedicated Spirit. On I walked    In thankful blessedness, which yet survives.      Strange rendezvous! My mind was at that time    A parti-colored show of grave and gay,    Solid and light, short-sighted and profound;    Of inconsiderate habits and sedate,    Consorting in one mansion unreproved.    The worth I knew of powers that I possessed,    Though slighted and too oft misused. Besides,    That summer, swarming as it did with thoughts    Transient and idle, lacked not intervals    When Folly from the frown of fleeting Time    Shrunk, and the mind experienced in herself    Conformity as just as that of old    To the end and written spirit of God's works,    Whether held forth in Nature or in Man,    Through pregnant vision, separate or conjoined.      When from our better selves we have too long    Been parted by the hurrying world, and droop,    Sick of its business, of its pleasure tired,    How gracious, how benign, is Solitude;    How potent a mere image of her sway;    Most potent when impressed upon the mind    With an appropriate human centre--hermit,    Deep in the bosom of the wilderness;    Votary (in vast cathedral, where no foot    Is treading, where no other face is seen)    Kneeling at prayers; or watchman on the top    Of lighthouse, beaten by Atlantic waves;    Or as the soul of that great Power is met    Sometimes embodied on a public road,    When, for the night deserted, it assumes    A character of quiet more profound    Than pathless wastes.              Once, when those summer months,    Where flown, and autumn brought its annual show    Of oars with oars contending, sails with sails,    Upon Windander's spacious breast, it chanced    That--after I had left a flower-decked room    (Whose in-door pastime, lighted up, survived    To a late hour), and spirits overwrought    Were making night do penance for a day    Spent in a round of strenuous idleness--    My homeward course led up a long ascent,    Where the road's watery surface, to the top    Of that sharp rising, glittered to the moon    And bore the semblance of another stream    Stealing with silent lapse to join the brook    That murmured in the vale. All else was still;    No living thing appeared in earth or air,    And, save the flowing water's peaceful voice,    Sound there was none--but, lo! an uncouth shape,    Shown by a sudden turning of the road,    So near that, slipping back into the shade    Of a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well,    Myself unseen.

In one of the worst cases I have known the  information was given to a boy by another boy--an entire stranger to  him--whom he happened to meet on a country road when cycling. Since  boys meet one another very much more at school than elsewhere and  spend three-fourths of their lives there, of course information is  more often obtained at school than at home. My own experience leads me  to think that in this respect the day-school--probably on account of  its mixed social conditions--is worse than the boarding-school.    Before passing from matters of personal experience, it may interest  the reader if I give particulars of a few typical cases to illustrate  some points on which I have insisted.    _Case A._--The father and mother of a boy close on thirteen came to  see me before entering the lad. They had no idea that I was specially  interested in purity-teaching; but they were anxious to ascertain what  precautions we took against the corruption of small boys. They struck  me as very good parents. I was specially pleased that they were alive  to the dangers of impurity, and that the mother could advert openly to  the matter without embarrassment. I advised them to give the boy  explicit warning; but they said that they were anxious to preserve his  innocence as long as possible. He was at present absolutely simple,  and they hoped that he would long remain so. It was a comfort to them  that I was interested in the subject, and they would leave the boy  with confidence in my care. As soon as I saw the boy, I found it  difficult to believe in his innocence; and I soon discovered that he  was thoroughly corrupt. Not merely did he begin almost at once to  corrupt other boys, but he actually gave them his views on brothels!  In a private interview with me he admitted all this, and told me that  he was corrupted at ten years of age, when he was sent, after  convalescence from scarlet fever, to a country village for three  months. There he seems to have associated with a group of street boys,  who gave him such information as they had, and initiated him into  self-abuse. Since then he had been greedily seeking further  information and passing it on.    _Case B._--A delicate, gentle boy of eleven, an only son, was sent to  me by an intellectual father, who had been his constant companion. The  lad was very amiable and well-intentioned. A year later he gave me  particulars of his corruption by a cousin, who was three years older  than he. Since that time--particularly of late--he had practised  masturbation. He had not the least idea that it was hurtful or even  unrefined, and thought that it was peculiar to himself and his  cousin. He knew from his cousin the chief facts of maternity and  paternity, but had not spoken to other boys about them. He was  intensely anxious to cleanse himself entirely, and promised to let me  know of any lapse, should it occur. In the following vacation he  developed pneumonia. For some days his life hung in the balance, and  then flickered out. His father wrote me a letter of noble resignation.  Terribly as he felt his loss, he was greatly consoled, he said, by the  knowledge that his boy had died while his mind was innocent and before  he could know even what temptation was. It is needless to add that I  never hinted the real facts to the father; and--without altering any  material detail--I am disguising the case lest it should possibly be  recognised by him. I have often wondered whether, when the lad's life  hung in the balance, it might not have been saved if Death's scale had  not been weighted by the child's lowered vitality.    _Case C._--A boy of fourteen came to me. He was a miserable specimen  in every way--pale, lethargic, stupid almost beyond belief. He had no  mother; and the father, though a man of leisure, evidently found it  difficult to make the lad much of a companion. I felt certain from the  first that the boy was an exceptionally bad victim of self-abuse; And  this I told his father, advising him to investigate the matter. He was  horrified at my diagnosis, and committed the great indiscretion of  taxing the boy with self-abuse as though it were a conscious and  grave fault. The father wrote during the vacation saying that he  found I was entirely mistaken: not, content with the lad's assurance,  he had watched him with the utmost care. As soon as the boy returned  to school I interviewed him. He admitted readily that he had long  masturbated himself daily--sometimes oftener. He had first--as far as  he could remember, at about six--had his private parts excited by his  nurse, who apparently did this to put an irritable child into a good  temper! My warning had little effect upon him, as he had become a  hopeless victim. He was too delicate a boy for us to desire to keep;  and after a brief stay at school, during which we nursed him through a  critical illness, he left to finish his education under private  tuition at home.    _Case D._--This boy came to me at thirteen. He was always a  conscientious and amiable boy, but was nervous and dull. By fifteen  his dullness had increased, and he complained of brain-strain and  poorness of memory. Finally he began to develop St. Vitus's dance. I  sent him to our school doctor, who returned him with a note saying  that his condition was serious--that he must stop all work, &c. &c. I  was in my study when the lad came back, and I at once told him what  was the matter. He frankly admitted frequent self-abuse, which he had  learned from an elder brother. He had not the least suspicion that the  habit was injurious; but was very apprehensive about his future until  I reassured him. He wanted me to write at once and warn a younger  brother who had fallen into the habit. By great effort he got himself  rapidly under control. His nervous twitchings disappeared, his  vitality improved, the brain-fag gradually ceased; and when he left,  eighteen months later, he was fairly normal. His improvement continued  afterwards, and he is now a successful man of business and a married  man.    _Case E._--This boy entered at twelve. He was very weak physically and  highly nervous--owing, his people thought, to severe bullying at a  previous school. He was an able boy, of literary and artistic tastes,  and almost painfully conscientious. He was very shy; always thought  that he was despised by other boys; and was a duffer at games, which  he avoided to the utmost. With my present experience I should have  known him to be a victim of self-abuse. Then, I did not suspect him;  and it was not until he was leaving at eighteen for the University  that we talked the matter over, on his initiative. Then I found that  he had been bullied into impurity at eleven, and was now a helpless  victim. After two years at the University he wrote me that, though the  temptation now came less frequently, he seemed absolutely powerless  when it did come; that he despised himself so much that the impulse to  suicide often haunted him; but that the cowardice which had kept him  from games at school would probably prevent his taking his life. With  the assistance of an intense and devoted religious life he gradually  began to gain self-mastery. It is some years now since he has  mentioned the subject to me.    These are merely specimen cases. Cases A, B, and C illustrate my  assertions that parents are wonderfully blind; Cases B and E, that  quite exceptional refinement in a boy gives no protection from  temptation to impurity; Case D, that a boy, even in an extreme case,  does not know that the habit is injurious. In respect of their  severity, C, D, and E are not normal but extreme cases. The reader  must not imagine that boys ordinarily suffer as much as these did.          CHAPTER II.    PREVALENCE OF IMPURITY AMONG BOYS: THE OPINIONS OF CANON LYTTELTON,  DR. DUKES, AND OTHERS.      I propose now to make clear to the reader the fact that the  conclusions I have reached as to the existence of sexual knowledge  among boys, and as to the prevalence of self-abuse, are entirely borne  out by the opinion of the most distinguished teachers and medical men.    Canon Lyttelton writes with an authority which no one will question.  Educated at Eton, he was for two years an assistant master at  Wellington College; then, for fifteen years, headmaster of Haileybury  College, and has now been headmaster of Eton for over six years. He  has intimate knowledge of boys, derived, as regards the question of  purity, from confidential talks with them. The quotations which follow  are from his work _Training of the Young in Laws of Sex_. Canon  Lyttelton does not think it needful to make statements as to the  prevalence of impurity among boys. He rather assumes that this  prevalence is obvious and, under present conditions, inevitable. I  have already quoted one passage which involves this assumption, and  now invite the reader to consider two others. \"In the school life of  boys, in spite of very great improvements, it is _impossible_ that  sexual subjects should be wholly avoided in common talk.... Though, in  preparatory schools of little boys under fourteen, the increasing  vigilance of masters, and constant supervision, combined with constant  employment, reduce the evil of prurient talk to a minimum, yet these  subjects _will_ crop up.... It should be remembered that the boys who  are talkative about such subjects are just those whose ideas are most  distorted and vicious. In the public school, owing not only to freer  talk and more mixed company but to the boy's own wider range of  vision, sexual questions, and also those connected with the structure  of the body, come to the fore and begin to occupy more or less of the  thoughts of all but a peculiarly constituted minority of the whole  number.    \"Men, as I have shown, have been severely dealt with by Nature in this  respect: she has forced them, at a time of life when their minds are  ill"]]]
