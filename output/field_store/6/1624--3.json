Take the best end of a neck of mutton, or a fillet taken from the leg  or shoulder, place it in a stewpan with just enough water to cover  it, throw in a carrot and turnip, and season, but not too highly; when  nearly done remove the meat and strain off the gravy, then return both  to the stewpan with forcemeat balls and some fine celery cut in small  pieces; let all stew gently till perfectly done, then stir in the  yolks of two eggs, a little flour, and the juice of half a lemon,  which must be mixed with a little of the gravy before pouring in the  stewpan, and care must be taken to prevent curdling.           *       *       *       *       *    A SIMPLE WAY OF DRESSING MUTTON.    Take the fillet off a small leg or shoulder of mutton, rub it well  over with egg and seasoning, and partly roast it, then place it in a  stewpan with a little strong gravy, and stew gently till thoroughly  done; this dish is simple, but exceedingly nice; a few balls or  fritters to garnish will improve it.           *       *       *       *       *    MAINTENON CUTLETS.    This is merely broiling or frying cutlets in a greased paper, after  having spread on them a seasoning prepared as follows: make a paste  of bread crumbs, chopped parsley, nutmeg, pepper, salt, grated lemon  peel, and thyme, with a couple of beaten eggs; a piquante sauce should  be served in a tureen.           *       *       *       *       *    A HARRICOT.    Cut off the best end of a neck of mutton into chops, flour and partly  fry them, then lay them in a stewpan with carrots, sliced turnips cut  in small round balls, some button onions, and cover with water; skim  frequently, season with pepper and salt to taste, color the gravy with  a little browning and a spoonful of mushroom powder.           *       *       *       *       *    IRISH STEW.    Is the same as above, excepting that the meat is not previously fried,  and that potatoes are used instead of turnips and carrots.           *       *       *       *       *    MUTTON A L'HISPANIOLA.    Take a small piece of mutton, either part of a shoulder or a fillet  of the leg, partly roast it, then put it in a stewpan with beef gravy  enough to cover it, previously seasoned with herbs, a carrot and  turnip; cut in quarters three large Spanish onions, and place in the  stewpan round the meat; a stuffing will improve it, and care must be  taken to free the gravy from every particle of fat.           *       *       *       *       *    MUTTON COLLOPS.    Take from a fine knuckle a couple of slices, cut and trim them in  collops the size of a tea cup, flatten them and spread over each side  a forcemeat for cutlets, and fry them; potatoe or Jerusalem artichokes  cut in slices of the same size and thickness, or pieces of bread  cut with a fluted cutter, prepared as the collops and fried, must be  placed alternately in the dish with them; they may be served with a  pure simple gravy, or very hot and dry on a napkin, garnished with  fried parsley and slices of lemon.    The knuckle may be used in the following manner: put it on with  sufficient water to cover it, season it and simmer till thoroughly  done, thicken the gravy with prepared barley, and flavor it with lemon  pickle, or capers; it should be slightly colored with saffron, and  celery sauce may be served as an accompaniment, or the mutton may be  served on a fine _puree_ of turnips.           *       *       *       *       *    MUTTON CUTLETS.    Have a neck of mutton, cut the bones short, and remove the chine  bone completely; cut chops off so thin that every other one shall be  without bone, trim them carefully, that all the chops shall bear the  same appearance, then flatten them well; cover them with a cutlet  preparation, and fry of a delicate brown; a fine _puree_ of any  vegetable that may be approved, or any sauce that may be selected,  should be served with them; they may be arranged in various ways in  the dish, either round the dish or in a circle in the centre, so that  the small part of the cutlets shall almost meet; if the latter, the  _puree_ should garnish round them instead of being in the centre of  the dish.           *       *       *       *       *    MUTTON HAM.    Choose a fine leg of mutton, rub it in daily with a mixture of three  ounces of brown sugar, two ounces of common salt, and half an ounce of  saltpetre, continue this process for a fortnight, then hang it to dry  in wood smoke for ten days longer.           *       *       *       *       *    LAMB AND SPREW.    Take a fine neck or breast of lamb, put it in stewpan with as much  water as will cover it, add to it a bundle of sprew cut in pieces of  two inches in length, a small head of celery cut small, and one onion,  pepper, salt, and a sprig of parsley, let it simmer gently till the  meat and sprew are tender; a couple of lumps of sugar improves the  flavor; there should not be too much liquor, and all fat must be  removed; the sprew should surround the meat when served, and also be  thickly laid over it.           *       *       *       *       *    LAMB AND PEAS.    Take the best end of a neck of lamb, either keep it whole or divide it  into chops as may be preferred, put it into a saucepan with a little  chopped onion, pepper, salt, and a small quantity of water; when half  done add half a peck of peas, half a lettuce cut fine, a little mint,  and a few lumps of sugar, and let it stew thoroughly; when done,  there must not be too much liquor; cutlets of veal or beef are also  excellent dressed as above. Although this is a spring dish it may be  almost equally well dressed in winter, by substituting small mutton  cutlets and preserved peas, which may be met with at any of the best  Italian warehouses; a breast or neck of lamb may also be stewed whole  in the same manner.           *       *       *       *       *    LAMB CUTLETS WITH CUCUMBERS.    Take two fine cucumbers, peel and cut them lengthways, lay them in  vinegar for an hour, then stew them in good stock till tender, when  stir in the yolks of two or three eggs, a little flour and essence of  lemon, which must all be first mixed up together with a little of  the stock, have ready some cutlets trimmed and fried a light brown,  arrange them round the dish and pour the cucumbers in the centre.           *       *       *       *       *    A NICE RECEIPT FOR SHOULDER OF LAMB.    Half boil it, score it and squeeze over lemon juice, and cover with  grated bread crumbs, egg and parsley, broil it over a clear fire  and put it to brown in a Dutch oven, or grill and serve with a sauce  seasoned with lemon pickle and chopped mint.           *       *       *       *       *    A CASSEREET, AN EAST INDIA DISH.    Take two pounds of lamb chops, or mutton may be substituted, place  them in a stewpan, cover with water or gravy, season only with pepper  and salt, when the chops are half done, carefully skim off the fat  and add two table spoonsful of cassereet, stir it in the gravy which  should not be thickened, and finish stewing gently till done enough;  rice should accompany this dish.           *       *       *       *       *    TURKEY BONED AND FORCED.    A turkey thus prepared may be either boiled or roasted; there are  directions for boning poultry which might be given, but it is always  better to let the poulterer do it; when boned it must be filled with a  fine forcemeat, which may be varied in several ways, the basis should  be according to the receipt given for veal stuffings, forcemeats,  sausage meat, tongue, and mushrooms added as approved. When boiled it  is served with any fine white sauce, French cooks use the veloute or  bechamel. When roasted, a cradle spit is very convenient, but if there  is not one the turkey must be carefully tied to the spit.           *       *       *       *       *    FOWLS BONED AND FORCED.    The above directions serve also for fowls.           *       *       *       *       *    A SAVOURY WAY OF ROASTING A FOWL.    Fill it with a fine seasoning, and just before it is ready for  serving, baste it well with clarified veal suet, and sprinkle it  thickly with very dry crumbs of bread, repeat this two or three times;  then place it in the dish, and serve with a fine brown gravy well  flavored with lemon juice; delicate forcemeat fritters should be also  served in the dish.           *       *       *       *       *    BOILED FOWLS.    Are served with a fine white sauce, and are often garnished with  pieces of white cauliflower, or vegetable marrow, the chief object  is to keep them white; it is best to select white legged poultry for  boiling, as they prove whiter when dressed.           *       *       *       *       *    AMNASTICH.    Stew gently one pint of rice in one quart of strong gravy till it  begins to swell, then add an onion stuck with cloves, a bunch of sweet  herbs, and a chicken stuffed with forcemeat, let it stew with the rice  till thoroughly done, then take it up and stir in the rice, the yolks  of four eggs, and the juice of a lemon; serve the fowl in the same  dish with the rice, which should be colored to a fine yellow with  saffron.           *       *       *       *       *    FOWLS STEWED WITH RICE AND CHORISA.    Boil a fowl in sufficient water or gravy to cover it, when boiling for  ten minutes, skim off the fat and add half a pound of rice, and one  pound of _chorisa_ cut in about four pieces, season with a little  white pepper, salt, and a pinch of saffron to color it, and then stew  till the rice is thoroughly tender; there should be no gravy when  served, but the rice ought to be perfectly moist.           *       *       *       *       *    CURRIED CHICKEN.    See curried veal. Undressed chicken is considered best for a curry,  it must be cut in small joints, the directions for curried veal are  equally"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1233"],[0,"The Origin and Nature of the Emotions; Miscellaneous Papers (#10)"],[1,"animals--  wide-spread changes were seen (Fig. 13). The principal clinical phenomena  expressed by the rabbit were rapid heart, accelerated respiration,  prostration, tremors, and a rise in temperature.  The dog showed  similar phenomena, excepting that, instead of such muscular relaxation  as was shown by the rabbit, it exhibited aggressive muscular action.  Both the dog and the rabbit were exhausted but, although the dog  exerted himself actively and the rabbit remained physically passive,  the rabbit was much more exhausted.    Further observations were made upon the brain of a fox  which had been chased for two hours by members of a hunt club,  and had been finally overtaken by the hounds and killed.  Most of the brain-cells of this fox, as compared with those of a  normal fox, showed extensive physical changes (Fig. 4).    The next line of evidence is offered with some reservation,  but it has seemed to me to be more than mere idle speculation.  It relates to the phenomena of one of the most interesting diseases  in the entire category of human ailments--I refer to exophthalmic goiter,  or Graves' disease, a disease primarily involving the emotions.  This disease is frequently the direct sequence of severe  mental shock or of a long and intensely worrying strain.  The following case is typical:  A broker was in his usual health up  to the panic of 1907; during this panic his fortune and that of others  were for almost a year in jeopardy, failure finally occurring.  During this heavy strain he became increasingly nervous and by  imperceptible degrees there developed a pulsating enlargement of  the thyroid gland, an increased prominence of the eyes, marked increase  in perspiration--profuse sweating even--palpitation of the heart,  increased respiration with frequent sighing, increase in blood-pressure;  there were tremor of many muscles, rapid loss of weight and strength,  frequent gastro-intestinal disturbances, loss of normal control  of his emotions, and marked impairment of his mental faculties.  He was as completely broken in health as in fortune.  These phenomena resembled closely those of fear and followed  in the wake of a strain which was due to fear.    In young women exophthalmic goiter often follows in the wake  of a disappointment in love; in women, too, it frequently follows  the illnesses of children or parents during which they have had  to endure the double strain of worry and of constant care.  Since such strains usually fall most heavily upon women, they are  the most frequent victims of this disease.  Now, whatever the exciting  cause of exophthalmic goiter, whether it be unusual business worry,  disappointment in love, a tragedy, or the illness of a loved one,  the symptoms are alike and closely resemble the phenomena of one  of the great primitive emotions.  How could disappointment in love  play a role in the causation of Graves' disease?  If the hypothesis  which has been presented as an explanation of the genesis and  the phenomena of fear be correct, then that hypothesis explains  also the emotion of love.  If fear be a phylogenetic physical  defense or escape which does not result in muscular action,  then love is a phylogenetic conjugation without physical action.  The quickened pulse, the leaping heart, the accelerated respiration,  the sighing, the glowing eye, the crimson cheek, and many other  phenomena are merely phylogenetic recapitulations of ancestral acts.  The thyroid gland is believed to participate in such physical activities.  Hence it may well follow that the disappointed maiden who is intensely  integrated for a youth will, at every thought of him, be subjected  by phylogenetic association to a specific stimulation analogous  to that which attended the ancestral consummation.  Moreover, a happy  marriage has many times been followed by a cure of the exophthalmic  goiter which appeared in the wake of such an experience.    The victims of Graves' disease present a counterpart of  emotional exhaustion.  That the emotions in Graves' disease are  abnormally acute is illustrated by my personal observation  of the death of a subject of this disease from fear alone.  Whatever the exciting cause of this disease, the symptoms are the same;  just as in fear, the phenomena are the same whatever the exciting cause.    Figures 12 and 16 show the resemblance between the outward appearances  of a patient with Graves' disease and of a person obsessed by fear.  Fear and Graves' disease have the following phenomena in common:  Increased heart-beat, increased respiration, rising temperature,  muscular tremors, protruding eyes, loss in weight; Cannon has found  an increased amount of adrenalin in the blood in fear and Frankel  in Graves' disease; increased blood-pressure; muscular weakness;  digestive disturbances; impaired nervous control; hypersusceptibility  to stimuli; in protracted intense fear the brain-cells show marked  physical changes, and in Graves' disease analogous changes are seen  (Figs. 13 C and 15). In Graves' disease there seems to be a composite  picture of an intense expression of the great primitive emotions.  If Graves' disease be a disease of the great primitive emotions,  or rather of the whole motor mechanism, how is the constant flow  of stimulation of this complicated mechanism supplied?  It would  seem that there must be secreted in excessive amount some substance  that activates the motor mechanism.  The nervous system in Graves'  disease is hypersusceptible to stimuli and to thyroid extract.  It might follow that even a normal amount of thyroid secretion would  lead to excessive stimulation of the hypersusceptible motor mechanism.    This condition of excessive motor activity and hyperexcitability may  endure for years.  What is the source of this pathologic excitation?  The following facts may give a clue.  In suitable cases of Graves'  disease, if the thyroid secretion is sufficiently diminished by a removal  of a part of the gland or by interrupting the nerve and the blood supply,  the phenomena of the disease are diminished immediately, and in favorable  cases the patient is restored to approximately the normal condition.  The heart action slows, the respiratory rate falls, the restlessness  diminishes, digestive disturbances disappear, tremors decrease,  there is a rapid increase in the body weight, and the patient gradually  resumes his normal state.  On the other hand, if for a period  of time extract of the thyroid gland is administered to a normal  individual in excessive dosage, there will develop nervousness,  palpitation of the heart, sweating, loss of weight, slight protrusion  of the eyes, indigestion; in short, most of the phenomena of Graves'  disease and of the strong emotions will be produced artificially  (Figs. 15 and 23). When the administration of the thyroid extract  is discontinued, these phenomena may disappear.  On the other hand,  when there is too little or no thyroid gland, the individual  becomes dull, stupid, and emotionless, though he may be irritable;  while if a sufficient amount of thyroid extract be given to such  a patient he may be brought back to his normal condition.    Hence we see that the phenomena of the emotions may within certain  limits be increased, diminished, or abolished by increasing,  diminishing, or totally excluding the secretion of the thyroid gland.    Graves' disease may be increased by giving thyroid extract and by fear.  It may be diminished by removing a part of the gland, or by  interrupting the blood and nerve supply, or by complete rest.  In addition, at some stage of Graves' disease there is an  increase in the size and in the number of the secreting cells.  These facts regarding the normal and the pathologic supply of thyroid  secretion point to this gland as one of the sources of the energizing  substance or substances, by means of which the motor phenomena  of animals are executed and their emotions expressed.    Anger is similar to fear in origin and, like fear, is an integration  and stimulation of the motor mechanism and its accessories.  Animals which have no natural weapons for attack experience neither  fear nor anger, while the animals which have weapons for attack  express anger principally by energizing the muscles used in attack.  Although, as has already been stated, the efficiency of the hands  of man has largely supplanted the use of the teeth, he still shows  his teeth in anger and so gives support to the theory that this  emotion is of remote ancestral origin and proves the great persistence  of phylogenetic association.  On this conception we can understand  why it is that a patient consumed by worry--which to me signifies  interrupted stimulation, a state of alternation between hope  and fear--suffers so many bodily impairments and diseases even.  This hypothesis explains the slow dying of animals in captivity.  It explains the grave digestive and metabolic disturbances which  appear under any nerve strain, especially under the strain of fear,  and the great benefits of confidence and hope; it explains the nervousness,  loss of weight, indigestion--in short, the comprehensive physical  changes that are wrought by fear and by sexual love and hate.  On this hypothesis we can understand the physical influence  of one individual over the body and personality of another;  and of the infinite factors in environment that, through phylogenetic  association, play a role in the functions of many of our organs.  It is because under the uncompromising law of survival of the fittest  we were evolved as motor beings that we do not possess any organs or  faculties which have not served our progenitors in accomplishing their  survival in the relentless struggle of organic forms with one another.  We are now, as we were then, essentially motor beings, and the only way in  which we can meet the dangers in our environment is by a motor response.  Such a motor response implies the"]]]
