PREFACE    This volume, the fourth of the Woman's Institute Library of Cookery,  deals with salads, sandwiches, cold desserts, cakes, both large and  small, puddings, pastry, and pies. Such foods constitute some of the  niceties of the diet, but skill in their preparation signifies at once a  housewife's mastery of the science of cookery.    In _Salads and Sandwiches_ are presented so simply the secrets of  appetizing salads that they can be grasped by even a novice, and  sandwiches of numerous varieties, from those appropriate for afternoon  teas to those suitable for the main dish in the meal, are so treated  that they appear to rise above the ordinary place usually accorded them.  One need never hesitate to prepare a menu for an afternoon or evening  social affair or the salad course in a luncheon or dinner after a study  of this part of the volume.    A glance through _Cold and Frozen Desserts_ will convince one very  quickly that a large number of the desserts that complete our meals are  served cold. The mere mention of custards, gelatine desserts, and such  frozen mixtures as ice creams, ices, frappes, sherbets, mousses,  parfaits, and biscuits, all of which are explained here, is sufficient  to indicate that this is an extremely delightful part of the subject of  cookery. Entertaining takes on a new and simplified meaning when one  knows how to make and serve such dishes.    To be able to make cakes and puddings well is one of the ambitions of  the modern housewife, and she has an opportunity to realize it in a  study of _Cakes, Cookies, and Puddings_, Parts 1 and 2. Sweet food in  excess is undesirable, but in a moderate quantity it is required in each  person's diet and may be obtained in this form without harm if it is  properly prepared.    The two classes of cakes--butter and sponge--are treated in detail both  as to the methods of making and the required ingredients, and numerous  recipes are given which will enable the housewife to provide both plain  and fancy cakes for ordinary and special occasions. Puddings that are  prepared by boiling, steaming, and baking, and the sauces that make them  appetizing, receive a goodly share of attention.    _Pastries and Pies_ completes this volume, rounding out, as it were, the  housewife's understanding of dessert making. To many persons, pastry  making is an intricate matter, but with the principles thoroughly  explained and each step clearly illustrated, delicious pies of every  variety, as well as puff-paste dainties, may be had with very  little effort.    Upon the completion of a study of this volume, the housewife will find  herself equipped with a knowledge of the way to prepare many delicacies  for her meals. While these are probably not so important in the diet as  the more fundamental foods, they have a definite place and should  receive the attention they deserve.

So much variety exists among salads that it is somewhat difficult to  give a comprehensive definition of this class of foods. In general,  however, salads may be considered as a dish of green herbs or  vegetables, sometimes cooked, and usually chopped or sliced, sometimes  mixed with fruit or with cooked and chopped cold meat, fish, etc., and  generally served with a dressing. For the most part, salads take their  name from their chief ingredient, as, for instance, chicken salad,  tomato salad, pineapple salad, etc. Just what place salads have in the  meal depends on the salad itself. A high-protein salad, such as lobster  salad, should take the place of the meat course, whereas, a light salad  of vegetables or fruits may be used as an additional course.    2. IMPORTANCE OF SALADS. Salads are often considered to be a dish of  little importance; that is, something that may be left out or added to a  meal without affecting it to any great extent. While this may be the  case in a meal that is composed of a sufficient variety of foods, salads  have a definite place in meals as they are planned in the majority of  households. Often there is a tendency to limit green vegetables or fresh  fruits in the diet, but if the members of a family are to be fed an  ideal diet it is extremely important that some of these foods enter into  each day's meals, a fact that is often overlooked. There is no more  effective nor appetizing way in which to include them in a meal than in  the serving of salads. In addition, salads make a strong appeal to the  appetite and at the same time are beneficial so far as the health of the  family is concerned.    3. PURPOSES OF SALADS.--Because of the wide variety of salads and the  large number of ingredients from which a selection may be made in their  preparation, salads can be used for various purposes. The housewife who  gives much attention to the artistic side of the serving of food in her  home will often use a salad to carry out a color scheme in her meal.  This is, of course, the least valuable use that salads have, but it is a  point that should not be overlooked. The chief purpose of salads in a  meal is to provide something that the rest of the foods served in the  meal lack.    Even though it is not desired to use the salad to carry out a color  scheme, it should always be made an attractive dish. As is well known,  nothing is so unappetizing as a salad in which the ingredients have not  been properly prepared, the garnish is not fresh and crisp, or the  dressing and salad ingredients have been combined in such a way as to  appear messy or stale looking. There is no excuse for such conditions,  and they need not exist if proper attention is given to the preparation  of the salad.    4. SELECTION OF SALADS.--Although salads, through their variety, offer  the housewife an opportunity to vary her meals, they require a little  attention as to their selection if a properly balanced meal is to be the  result. Salads that are high in food value or contain ingredients  similar to those found in the other dishes served in the meal, should be  avoided with dinners or with other heavy meals. For instance, a fish or  a meat salad should not be served with a dinner, for it would supply a  quantity of protein to a meal that is already sufficiently high in this  food substance because of the fact that meat also is included. Such a  salad, however, has a place in a very light luncheon or a supper, for it  helps to balance such a meal. The correct salad to serve with a dinner  that contains a number of heavy dishes is a vegetable salad, if enough  vegetables are not already included, or a fruit salad, if the dessert  does not consist of fruit. In case a fruit salad is selected, it is  often made to serve for both the salad and the dessert course.    5. SALAD ACCOMPANIMENTS.--In addition to the ingredients used in the  preparation of salads, dressings usually form an important part. These  vary greatly as to ingredients and consequently as to composition, but  most of them contain considerable fat and therefore increase the food  value of the salad. Then, too, an accompaniment of some kind is  generally served with salads to make them more attractive and more  pleasing to the taste. This may be a wafer or a cracker of some  description or a small sandwich made of bread cut into thin slices and  merely buttered or buttered and then spread with a filling of some sort.  Such accompaniments, of course, are not a necessity, but they add enough  to the salad to warrant their use.      COMPOSITION OF SALADS    6.

PREFACE    This volume, the fifth of the Woman's Institute Library of Cookery,  deals with the varieties of fruits and the desserts that can be made  from them, the canning and preserving of foods, the making of  confections of every description, beverages and their place in the diet,  and every phase of the planning of meals.    With fruits becoming less seasonal and more a daily food, an  understanding of them is of great value to the housewife. In _Fruit and  Fruit Desserts_, she first learns their place in the diet, their nature,  composition, and food value. Then she proceeds with the preparation and  serving of every variety of fruit. Included in this section also are  fruit cocktails, those refreshing appetizers often used to introduce a  special meal.    To understand how to preserve perishable foods in the seasons of plenty  for the times when they are not obtainable is a valuable part of a  housewife's knowledge. _Canning and Drying_ deals with two ways of  preserving foodstuffs, treating carefully the equipment needed and all  the methods that can be employed and showing by means of excellent  illustrations, one of them in natural colors, every part of the  procedure followed. The fruits and vegetables that permit of canning, as  well as certain meats and fish, are taken up in a systematic manner.    _Jelly Making, Preserving, and Pickling_ continues a discussion of the  home preservation of foods, showing how they can be kept for long  periods of time not by sterilization, but with the aid of preservatives.  Each one of these methods is treated as to its principles, equipment,  and the procedure to be followed. After trying the numerous recipes  given, the housewife will be able to show with pride the results of her  efforts, for nothing adds more to the attractiveness and palatability of  a meal than a choice jelly, conserve, marmalade, or jam.    _Confections_ deals with that very delightful and fascinating part of  cookery--confection making. Not only are home-made confections cheaper  than commercially made ones, but they usually contain more wholesome  materials, so it is to the housewife's advantage to familiarize herself  with the making of this food. Recipes are given for all varieties of  confections, including taffies, caramels, cream candies, and the  confections related to them. Fondant making is treated in detail with  illustrations showing every step and directions for making many  unusual kinds.    Though beverages often receive only slight consideration, they are so  necessary that the body cannot exist very long without them. In  _Beverages_ is discussed the relation of beverages to meals, the classes  of beverages, and the preparation of those required by the human system,  as well as the proper way to serve them. In addition to coffee, tea,  cocoa, chocolate, and cereal beverages, fruit, soft, and nourishing  drinks receive their share of attention.    To be a successful home maker, it is not enough for a housewife to know  how to prepare food; she must also understand how to buy it, how to look  after the household accounts, what constitutes correct diet for each  member of her family, how to plan menus for her regular meals and for  special occasions, and the essentials of good table service. All these  things, and many more, she learns in _The Planning of Meals_, which  completes this volume.

FRUIT, as is generally understood, is the fleshy, juicy product of  some plant or tree which, when ripe, is suitable for use as food.  Although some fruits are seedless, they generally contain the seeds of  the plants or trees that produce them. Many fruits require cooking to  make them palatable, others are never cooked, and still others may be  cooked or eaten raw, as desired.    Fruits, because they are wholesome, appetizing, and attractive, occupy a  valuable place in the diet. In fact, it is these qualities rather than  their food value that accounts for the popularity of fruits among all  people. In addition to causing fruits to appeal to the esthetic sense,  their attractiveness serves another important purpose. It is said that  Nature made them attractive in color, odor, and flavor in order that  birds might be allured to attack them for food and, by spreading the  seeds, assist in their propagation.    2. Fruits are gradually growing to be less seasonal and more a daily  food, and are thus constantly becoming more prevalent in the diet. This  condition may be attributed to the present rapid means of transportation  and the excellent methods of cold storage that exist. Through these  agencies it is possible to ship more or less perishable fruits long  distances from their native localities and at times of the year other  than the particular season in which they are at their best in the places  where they are grown. Thus, fruits that were formerly considered a  luxury may now be served regularly, even on the tables of persons having  only moderate means.    The fact that fruits are being more extensively used every day is as it  should be, for this food is entitled to an important place in the diet  of all persons. So important is fruit in the diet that it must be looked  on not as one of the things that may be taken or omitted as a person  wishes without making any difference either way, but as a food to  include in one form or another in nearly every meal. The child who is so  young that it cannot take any solid food may have fruit juices included  in its diet to decided advantage; but children who are slightly older  and adults may take the fruits cooked or raw instead of in the form  of juices.    3. As far as the composition of fruits is concerned, it is such that  most fresh fruits are not particularly high in food value. However, they  are characterized by other qualities that make up for what they lack in  this respect; then, too, what they contain in the way of heat-producing  or tissue-building material is easily digestible. Most fruits contain  considerable acid, and this food substance makes them stimulating to the  appetite. Advantage of this fact is taken when fruits are served at the  beginning of a breakfast or when several of them are combined in a fruit  cocktail and served before luncheon or dinner. This acid produces real  stimulation in the stomach, resulting in a flow of gastric juice from  the glands of the stomach walls. In addition, the delightful color, the  fragrant odor, or the pleasant taste of fruit, "]]]
