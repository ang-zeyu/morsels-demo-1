[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13707"],[0,"Twice Told Tales (#10)"],[1,"the lowest green bough of the Maypole had been twined for  them, and would be thrown over both their heads in symbol of their  flowery union. When the priest had spoken, therefore, a riotous uproar  burst from the rout of monstrous figures.    \"Begin you the stave, reverend sir,\" cried they all, \"and never did  the woods ring to such a merry peal as we of the Maypole shall send  up.\"    Immediately a prelude of pipe, cittern and viol, touched with  practised minstrelsy, began to play from a neighboring thicket in such  a mirthful cadence that the boughs of the Maypole quivered to the  sound. But the May-lord--he of the gilded staff--chancing to look into  his lady's eyes, was wonder-struck at the almost pensive glance that  met his own.    \"Edith, sweet Lady of the May,\" whispered he, reproachfully, \"is yon  wreath of roses a garland to hang above our graves that you look so  sad? Oh, Edith, this is our golden time. Tarnish it not by any pensive  shadow of the mind, for it may be that nothing of futurity will be  brighter than the mere remembrance of what is now passing.\"    \"That was the very thought that saddened me. How came it in your mind  too?\" said Edith, in a still lower tone than he; for it was high  treason to be sad at Merry Mount. \"Therefore do I sigh amid this  festive music. And besides, dear Edgar, I struggle as with a dream,  and fancy that these shapes of our jovial friends are visionary and  their mirth unreal, and that we are no true lord and lady of the May.  What is the mystery in my heart?\"    Just then, as if a spell had loosened them, down came a little shower  of withering rose-leaves from the Maypole. Alas for the young lovers!  No sooner had their hearts glowed with real passion than they were  sensible of something vague and unsubstantial in their former  pleasures, and felt a dreary presentiment of inevitable change. From  the moment that they truly loved they had subjected themselves to  earth's doom of care and sorrow and troubled joy, and had no more a  home at Merry Mount. That was Edith's mystery. Now leave we the priest  to marry them, and the masquers to sport round the Maypole till the  last sunbeam be withdrawn from its summit and the shadows of the  forest mingle gloomily in the dance. Meanwhile, we may discover who  these gay people were.    Two hundred years ago, and more, the Old World and its inhabitants  became mutually weary of each other. Men voyaged by thousands to the  West--some to barter glass and such like jewels for the furs of the  Indian hunter, some to conquer virgin empires, and one stern band to  pray. But none of these motives had much weight with the colonists of  Merry Mount. Their leaders were men who had sported so long with life,  that when Thought and Wisdom came, even these unwelcome guests were led  astray by the crowd of vanities which they should have put to flight.  Erring Thought and perverted Wisdom were made to put on masques, and  play the fool. The men of whom we speak, after losing the heart's fresh  gayety, imagined a wild philosophy of pleasure, and came hither to act  out their latest day-dream. They gathered followers from all that giddy  tribe whose whole life is like the festal days of soberer men. In their  train were minstrels, not unknown in London streets; wandering players,  whose theatres had been the halls of noblemen; mummers, rope-dancers,  and mountebanks, who would long be missed at wakes, church ales, and  fairs; in a word, mirth makers of every sort, such as abounded in that  age, but now began to be discountenanced by the rapid growth of  Puritanism. Light had their footsteps been on land, and as lightly they  came across the sea. Many had been maddened by their previous troubles  into a gay despair; others were as madly gay in the flush of youth, like  the May Lord and his Lady; but whatever might be the quality of their  mirth, old and young were gay at Merry Mount. The young deemed  themselves happy. The elder spirits, if they knew that mirth was but the  counterfeit of happiness, yet followed the false shadow wilfully,  because at least her garments glittered brightest. Sworn triflers of a  lifetime, they would not venture among the sober truths of life not even  to be truly blest.    All the hereditary pastimes of Old England were transplanted  hither. The King of Christmas was duly crowned, and the Lord of  Misrule bore potent sway. On the Eve of St. John, they felled  whole acres of the forest to make bonfires, and danced by the  blaze all night, crowned with garlands, and throwing flowers into  the flame. At harvest time, though their crop was of the  smallest, they made an image with the sheaves of Indian corn, and  wreathed it with autumnal garlands, and bore it home  triumphantly. But what chiefly characterized the colonists of  Merry Mount was their veneration for the Maypole. It has made  their true history a poet's tale. Spring decked the hallowed  emblem with young blossoms and fresh green boughs; Summer brought  roses of the deepest blush, and the perfected foliage of the  forest; Autumn enriched it with that red and yellow gorgeousness  which converts each wildwood leaf into a painted flower; and  Winter silvered it with sleet, and hung it round with icicles,  till it flashed in the cold sunshine, itself a frozen sunbeam.  Thus each alternate season did homage to the Maypole, and paid it  a tribute of its own richest splendor. Its votaries danced round  it, once, at least, in every month; sometimes they called it  their religion, or their altar; but always, it was the banner  staff of Merry Mount.    Unfortunately, there were men in the new world of a sterner faith  than those Maypole worshippers. Not far from Merry Mount was a  settlement of Puritans, most dismal wretches, who said their  prayers before daylight, and then wrought in the forest or the  cornfield till evening made it prayer time again. Their weapons  were always at hand to shoot down the straggling savage. When  they met in conclave, it was never to keep up the old English  mirth, but to hear sermons three hours long, or to proclaim  bounties on the heads of wolves and the scalps of Indians. Their  festivals were fast days, and their chief pastime the singing of  psalms. Woe to the youth or maiden who did but dream of a dance!  The selectman nodded to the constable; and there sat the  light-heeled reprobate in the stocks; or if he danced, it was  round the whipping-post, which might be termed the Puritan  Maypole.    A party of these grim Puritans, toiling through the difficult  woods, each with a horseload of iron armor to burden his  footsteps, would sometimes draw near the sunny precincts of Merry  Mount. There were the silken colonists, sporting round their  Maypole; perhaps teaching a bear to dance, or striving to  communicate their mirth to the grave Indian, or masquerading in the  skins of deer and wolves which they had hunted for that especial  purpose. Often the whole colony were playing at Blindman's Buff,  magistrates and all with their eyes bandaged, except a single  scapegoat, whom the blinded sinners pursued by the tinkling of the  bells at his garments. Once, it is said, they were seen following a  flower-decked corpse with merriment and festive music to his grave.  But did the dead man laugh? In their quietest times they sang ballads  and told tales for the edification of their pious visitors, or  perplexed them with juggling tricks, or grinned at them through  horse-collars; and when sport itself grew wearisome, they made game of  their own stupidity and began a yawning-match. At the very least of  these enormities the men of iron shook their heads and frowned so  darkly that the revellers looked up, imagining that a momentary cloud  had overcast the sunshine which was to be perpetual there. On the  other hand, the Puritans affirmed that when a psalm was pealing from  their place of worship the echo which the forest sent them back seemed  often like the chorus of a jolly catch, closing with a roar of  laughter. Who but the fiend and his bond-slaves the crew of Merry  Mount had thus disturbed them? In due time a feud arose, stern and  bitter on one side, and as serious on the other as anything could be  among such light spirits as had sworn allegiance to the Maypole. The  future complexion of New England was involved in this important  quarrel. Should the grisly saints establish their jurisdiction over  the gay sinners, then would their spirits darken all the clime and  make it a land of clouded visages, of hard toil, of sermon and psalm  for ever; but should the banner-staff of Merry Mount be fortunate,  sunshine would break upon the hills, and flowers would beautify the  forest and late posterity do homage to the Maypole.    After these authentic passages from history we return to the nuptials  of the Lord and Lady of the May. Alas! we have delayed too long, and  must darken our tale too suddenly. As we glance again at the Maypole a  solitary sunbeam is fading from the summit, and leaves only a faint  golden tinge blended with the hues of the rainbow banner. Even that  dim light is now withdrawn, relinquishing the whole domain of Merry  Mount to the evening gloom which has rushed so instantaneously from  the black surrounding woods. But some of these black shadows have  rushed forth in human shape.    Yes, with the setting sun the last day of mirth had passed from Merry  Mount. The ring of gay masquers was disordered and broken; the stag  lowered his antlers in dismay; the wolf grew weaker than a lamb; the  bells of the morrice-dancers tinkled with tremulous affright. The  Puritans had played a characteristic part in the Maypole mummeries.  Their darksome figures were intermixed with the wild shapes of their  foes, and made the scene a picture of the moment when waking thoughts  start up amid the scattered fantasies of a dream. The leader of the  hostile party stood in the centre of the circle, while the rout"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1371"],[0,"Astoria; Or, Anecdotes of an Enterprise Beyond the Rocky Mountains (#10)"],[1,"of Easter Island.\"    To all these resolves, the captain opposed his peremptory veto, as  \"contrary to instructions.\" Then would break forth an unavailing  explosion of wrath on the part of certain of the partners, in the course  of which they did not even spare Mr. Astor for his act of supererogation  in furnishing orders for the control of the ship while they were on  board, instead of leaving them to be the judges where it would be best  for her to touch, and how long to remain. The choleric M'Dougal took the  lead in these railings, being, as has been observed, a little puffed up  with the idea of being Mr. Astor's proxy.    The captain, however, became only so much the more crusty and dogged in  his adherence to his orders, and touchy and harsh in his dealings with  the passengers, and frequent altercations ensued. He may in some measure  have been influenced by his seamanlike impatience of the interference  of landsmen, and his high notions of naval etiquette and quarter-deck  authority; but he evidently had an honest, trusty concern for the  interests of his employer. He pictured to himself the anxious projector  of the enterprise, who had disbursed so munificently in its outfit,  calculating on the zeal, fidelity, and singleness of purpose of his  associates and agents; while they, on the other hand, having a good ship  at their disposal and a deep pocket at home to bear them out, seemed  ready to loiter on every coast, and amuse themselves in every port.    On the fourth of December they came in sight of the Falkland Islands.  Having been for some time on an allowance of water, it was resolved to  anchor here and obtain a supply. A boat was sent into a small bay to  take soundings. Mr. M'Dougal and Mr. M'Kay took this occasion to go on  shore, but with a request from the captain that they would not detain  the ship. Once on shore, however, they were in no haste to obey his  orders, but rambled about in search of curiosities. The anchorage  proving unsafe, and water difficult to be procured, the captain stood  out to sea, and made repeated signals for those on shore to rejoin the  ship, but it was not until nine at night that they came on board.    The wind being adverse, the boat was again sent on shore on the  following morning, and the same gentlemen again landed, but promised to  come off at a moment's warning; they again forgot their promise in their  eager pursuit of wild geese and seawolves. After a time the wind hauled  fair, and signals were made for the boat. Half an hour elapsed but no  boat put off. The captain reconnoitered the shore with his glass, and,  to his infinite vexation, saw the loiterers in the full enjoyment of  their \"wildgoose-chase.\" Nettled to the quick, he immediately made sail.  When those on shore saw the ship actually under way, they embarked with  all speed, but had a hard pull of eight miles before they got on board,  and then experienced but a grim reception, notwithstanding that they  came well laden with the spoils of the chase.    Two days afterwards, on the seventh of December, they anchored at Fort  Egmont, in the same island, where they remained four days taking in  water and making repairs. This was a joyous time for the landsmen. They  pitched a tent on shore, had a boat at their command, and passed their  time merrily in rambling about the island, and coasting along the  shores, shooting sealions, seals, foxes, geese, ducks, and penguins.  None were keener in pursuit of this kind of game than M'Dougal and  David Stuart; the latter was reminded of aquatic sports on the coast of  Labrador, and his hunting exploits in the Northwest.    In the meantime the captain addressed himself steadily to the business  of his ship, scorning the holiday spirit and useless pursuits of his  emancipated messmates, and warning them, from time to time, not to  wander away nor be out of hail. They promised, as usual, that the ship  should never experience a moment's detention on their account, but, as  usual, forgot their promise.    On the morning of the 11th, the repairs being all finished, and the  water casks replenished, the signal was given to embark, and the ship  began to weigh anchor. At this time several of the passengers were  dispersed about the island, amusing themselves in various ways. Some of  the young men had found two inscriptions, in English, over a place where  two unfortunate mariners had been buried in this desert island. As the  inscriptions were worn out by the time and weather, they were playing  the part of \"Old Mortality,\" and piously renewing them. The signal from  the ship summoned them from their labors; they saw the sails unfurled,  and that she was getting under way. The two sporting partners, however,  Mr. M'Dougal and David Stuart, had strolled away to the south of the  island in pursuit of penguins. It would never do to put off without  them, as there was but one boat to convey the whole.    While this delay took place on shore, the captain was storming on board.  This was the third time his orders had been treated with contempt, and  the ship wantonly detained, and it should be the last; so he spread all  sail and put to sea, swearing he would leave the laggards to shift for  themselves. It was in vain that those on board made remonstrances and  entreaties, and represented the horrors of abandoning men upon a sterile  and uninhabited island; the sturdy captain was inflexible.    In the meantime the penguin hunters had joined the engravers of  tombstones, but not before the ship was already out at sea. They all, to  the number of eight, threw themselves into their boat, which was about  twenty feet in length, and rowed with might and main. For three hours  and a half did they tug anxiously and severely at the oar, swashed  occasionally by the surging waves of the open sea, while the ship  inexorably kept on her course, and seemed determined to leave them  behind.    On board the ship was the nephew of David Stuart, a young man of spirit  and resolution. Seeing, as he thought, the captain obstinately bent  upon abandoning his uncle and the others, he seized a pistol, and in a  paroxysm of wrath swore he would blow out the captain's brains, unless  he put about or shortened sail.    Fortunately for all parties, the wind just then came ahead, and the boat  was enabled to reach the ship; otherwise, disastrous circumstances might  have ensued. We can hardly believe that the captain really intended to  carry his threat into full effect, and rather think he meant to let the  laggards off for a long pull and a hearty fright. He declared, however,  in his letter to Mr. Astor, that he was serious in his threats, and  there is no knowing how far such an iron man may push his notions of  authority.    \"Had the wind,\" writes he, \"(unfortunately) not hauled ahead soon after  leaving the harbor's mouth, I should positively have left them; and,  indeed, I cannot but think it an unfortunate circumstance for you  that it so happened, for the first loss in this instance would, in my  opinion, have proved the best, as they seem to have no idea of the  value of property, nor any apparent regard for your interest, although  interwoven with their own.\"    This, it must be confessed, was acting with a high hand, and carrying  a regard to the owner's property to a dangerous length. Various petty  feuds occurred also between him and the partners in respect to the goods  on board ship, some articles of which they wished to distribute  for clothing among the men, or for other purposes which they deemed  essential. The captain, however, kept a mastiff watch upon the cargo,  and growled and snapped if they but offered to touch box or bale. \"It  was contrary to orders; it would forfeit his insurance; it was out of  all rule.\" It was in vain they insisted upon their right to do so, as  part owners, and as acting for the good of the enterprise; the captain  only stuck to his point the more stanchly. They consoled themselves,  therefore, by declaring, that as soon as they made land, they would  assert their rights, and do with ship and cargo as they pleased.    Beside these feuds between the captain and the partners, there were  feuds between the partners themselves, occasioned, in some measure, by  jealousy of rank. M'Dougal and M'Kay began to draw plans for the fort,  and other buildings of the intended establishment. They agreed very well  as to the outline and dimensions, which were on a sufficiently grand  scale; but when they came to arrange the details, fierce disputes arose,  and they would quarrel by the hour about the distribution of the doors  and windows. Many were the hard words and hard names bandied between  them on these occasions, according to the captain's account. Each  accused the other of endeavoring to assume unwarrantable power, and take  the lead; upon which Mr. M'Dougal would vauntingly lay down Mr. Astor's  letter, constituting him his representative and proxy, a document not to  be disputed.    These wordy contests, though violent, were brief; \"and within fifteen  minutes,\" says the captain, \"they would be caressing each other like  children.\"    While all this petty anarchy was agitating the little world within the  Tonquin, the good ship prosperously pursued her course, doubled Cape  Horn on the 25th of December, careered across the bosom of the Pacific,  until, on the 11th of February, the snowy peaks of Owyhee were seen  brightening above the horizon.
