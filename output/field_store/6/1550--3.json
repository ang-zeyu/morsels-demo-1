The rights and obligations of one member of the League are  no more and no less than those of every other member. It is based on  international democracy and denies international aristocracy.    Equality in the exercise of sovereign rights in times of peace, an  equality which is imposed by the very nature of sovereignty, seemed to  me fundamental to a world organization affecting in any way a nation's  independence of action or its exercise of supreme authority over its  external or domestic affairs. In my judgment any departure from that  principle would be a serious error fraught with danger to the general  peace of the world and to the recognized law of nations, since it could  mean nothing less than the primacy of the Great Powers and the  acknowledgment that because they possessed the physical might they had a  right to control the affairs of the world in times of peace as well as  in times of war. For the United States to admit that such primacy ought  to be formed would be bad enough, but to suggest it indirectly by  proposing an international organization based on that idea would be  far worse.    On January 22, 1917, the President in an address to the Senate had made  the following declaration:       \"The equality of nations upon which peace must be founded if it is to     last must be an equality of rights; the guarantees exchanged must     neither recognize nor imply a difference between big nations or     small, between those that are powerful and those that are weak. Right     must be based upon the common strength, not the individual strength,     of the nations upon whose concert peace will depend. Equality of     territory or of resources there of course cannot be; nor any other     sort of equality not gained in the ordinary peaceful and legitimate     development of the peoples themselves. But no one asks or expects     anything more than an equality of rights.\"    In view of this sound declaration of principle it seemed hardly possible  that the President, after careful consideration of the consequences of  his plan of a guaranty requiring force to make it practical, would not  perceive the fundamental error of creating a primacy of the  Great Powers.    It was in order to prevent, if possible, the United States from becoming  sponsor for an undemocratic principle that I determined to lay my  partial plan of organization before the President at the earliest moment  that I believed it would receive consideration.    To my letter of December 23 with its enclosed memoranda I never received  a reply or even an acknowledgment. It is true that the day following its  delivery the President went to Chaumont to spend Christmas at the  headquarters of General Pershing and that almost immediately thereafter  he visited London and two or three days after his return to Paris he set  out for Rome. It is possible that Mr. Wilson in the midst of these  crowded days had no time to digest or even to read my letter and its  enclosed memoranda. It is possible that he was unable or unwilling to  form an opinion as to their merits without time for meditation. I do not  wish to be unjustly critical or to blame the President for a neglect  which was the result of circumstance rather than of intention.    At the time I assumed that his failure to mention my letter in any way  was because his visits to royalty exacted from him so much of his time  that there was no opportunity to give the matter consideration. While  some doubt was thrown on this assumption by the fact that the President  held an hour's conference with the American Commissioners on January 1,  just before departing for Italy, during which he discussed the favorable  attitude of Mr. Lloyd George toward his (the President's) ideas as to a  League of Nations, but never made any reference to my proposed  substitute for the guaranty, I was still disposed to believe that there  was a reasonable explanation for his silence and that upon his return  from Rome he would discuss it.    Having this expectation I continued the preparation of tentative  provisions to be included in the charter of a League of Nations in the  event one was negotiated, and which would in any event constitute a  guide for the preparation of declarations to be included in the Treaty  of Peace in case the negotiation as to a League was postponed until  after peace had been restored. As has been said, it was my hope that  there would be a separate convention organizing the League, but I was  not as sanguine of this as many who believed this course would  be followed.    It later developed that the President never had any other purpose than  to include the detailed plan of organization in the peace treaty,  whether the treaty was preliminary or definitive. When he departed for  Italy he had not declared this purpose to the Commissioners, but from  some source, which I failed to note at the time and cannot now  recollect, I gained the impression that he intended to pursue this  policy, for on December 29 I wrote in my book of notes:       \"It is evident that the President is determined to incorporate in the     peace treaty an elaborate scheme for the League of Nations which will     excite all sorts of opposition at home and abroad and invite much     discussion.       \"The articles relating to the League ought to be few and brief. They     will not be. They will be many and long. If we wait till they are     accepted, it will be four or five months before peace is signed, and     I fear to say how much longer it will take to have it ratified.       \"It is perhaps foolish to prophesy, but I will take the chance. Two     months from now we will still be haggling over the League of Nations     and an exasperated world will be cursing us for not having made     peace. I hope that I am a false prophet, but I fear my prophecy will     come true. We are riding a hobby, and riding to a fall.\"    By the time the President returned from his triumphal journey to Rome I  had completed the articles upon which I had been working; at least they  were in form for discussion. At a conference at the Hotel Crillon  between President Wilson and the American Commissioners on January 7, I  handed to him the draft articles saying that they were supplemental to  my letter of December 23. He took them without comment and without  making any reference to my unanswered letter.    The first two articles of the \"International Agreement,\" as I termed the  document, were identical in language with the memoranda dealing with a  mutual covenant and with an international council which I had enclosed  in my letter of December 23. It is needless, therefore, to repeat  them here.    Article III of the so-called \"Agreement\" was entitled \"Peaceful  Settlements of International Disputes,\" and read as follows:       \"_Clause_ 1       \"In the event that there is a controversy between two or more members     of the League of Nations which fails of settlement through diplomatic     channels, one of the following means of settlement shall be employed:       \"1. The parties to the controversy shall constitute a joint     commission to investigate and report jointly or severally to their     Governments the facts and make recommendations as to settlement.     After such report a further effort shall be made to reach a     diplomatic settlement of the controversy.       \"2. The parties shall by agreement arrange for the submission of the     controversy to arbitration mutually agreed upon, or to the Arbitral     Tribunal hereinafter referred to.       \"3. Any party may, unless the second means of settlement is mutually     adopted, submit the controversy to the Supervisory Committee of the     International Council; and the Committee shall forthwith (a) name and     direct a special commission to investigate and report upon the     subject; (b) name and direct a commission to mediate between the     parties to the controversy; or (c) direct the parties to submit the     controversy to the Arbitral Tribunal for judicial settlement, it     being understood that the direction to arbitrate may be made at any     time in the event that investigation and mediation fail to result in     a settlement of the controversy.       \"_Clause 2_       \"No party to a controversy shall assume any authority or perform any     acts based upon disputed rights without authorization of the     Supervisory Committee, such authorization being limited in all cases     to the pendency of the controversy and its final settlement and being     in no way prejudicial to the rights of the parties. An authorization     thus granted by the Supervisory Committee may be modified or     superseded by mutual agreement of the parties, by order of an     arbitrator or arbitrators selected by the parties, or by order of the     Arbitral Tribunal if the controversy is submitted to it.       \"_Clause 3_       \"The foregoing clause shall not apply to cases in which the     constituted authorities of a power are unable or fail to give     protection to the lives and property of nationals of another power.     In the event that it becomes necessary for a power to use its     military or naval forces to safeguard the lives or property of its     nationals within the territorial jurisdiction of another power, the     facts and reasons for such action shall be forthwith reported to the     Supervisory Committee, which shall determine the course of action to     be adopted in order to protect the rights of all parties, and shall     notify the same to the governments involved which shall comply with     such notification. In the event that a government fails to comply     therewith it shall be deemed to have violated the covenant and     guaranty hereinbefore set forth.\"    The other articles follow:       \"ARTICLE IV       \"_Revision of Arbitral Tribunal and Codification of International     Law_       \"_Clause 1_       \"The International Council, within one year"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10477"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 01: The Old Pagan Civilizations (#10)"],[1,"boy, as he grew up, all knowledge of the wickedness and  misery of the world. He was therefore carefully educated within the  walls of the palace, and surrounded with every luxury, but not allowed  even to walk or drive in the royal gardens for fear he might see misery  and sorrow. A beautiful girl was given to him in marriage, full of  dignity and grace, with whom he lived in supreme happiness.    At length, as his mind developed and his curiosity increased to see and  know things and people beyond the narrow circle to which he was  confined, he obtained permission to see the gardens which surrounded the  palace. His father took care to remove everything in his way which could  suggest misery and sorrow; but a _deva_, or angel, assumed the form of  an aged man, and stood beside his path, apparently struggling for life,  weak and oppressed. This was a new sight to the prince, who inquired of  his charioteer what kind of a man it was. Forced to reply, the  charioteer told him that this infirm old man had once been young,  sportive, beautiful, and full of every enjoyment.    On hearing this, the prince sank into profound meditation, and returned  to the palace sad and reflective; for he had learned that the common lot  of man is sad,--that no matter how beautiful, strong, and sportive a boy  is, the time will come, in the course of Nature, when this boy will be  wrinkled, infirm, and helpless. He became so miserable and dejected on  this discovery that his father, to divert his mind, arranged other  excursions for him; but on each occasion a _deva_ contrived to appear  before him in the form of some disease or misery. At last he saw a dead  man carried to his grave, which still more deeply agitated him, for he  had not known that this calamity was the common lot of all men. The same  painful impression was made on him by the death of animals, and by the  hard labors and privations of poor people. The more he saw of life as it  was, the more he was overcome by the sight of sorrow and hardship on  every side. He became aware that youth, vigor, and strength of life in  the end fulfilled the law of ultimate destruction. While meditating on  this sad reality beneath a flowering Jambu tree, where he was seated in  the profoundest contemplation, a _deva_, transformed into a religious  ascetic, came to him and said, \"I am a Shaman. Depressed and sad at the  thought of age, disease, and death, I have left my home to seek some way  of rescue; yet everywhere I find these evils,--all things hasten to  decay. Therefore I seek that happiness which is only to be found in that  which never perishes, that never knew a beginning, that looks with equal  mind on enemy and friend, that heeds not wealth nor beauty,--the  happiness to be found in solitude, in some dell free from molestation,  all thought about the world destroyed.\"    This embodies the soul of Buddhism, its elemental principle,--to escape  from a world of misery and death; to hide oneself in contemplation in  some lonely spot, where indifference to passing events is gradually  acquired, where life becomes one grand negation, and where the thoughts  are fixed on what is eternal and imperishable, instead of on the mortal  and transient.    The prince, who was now about thirty years of age, after this interview  with the supposed ascetic, firmly resolved himself to become a hermit,  and thus attain to a higher life, and rise above the misery which he saw  around him on every hand. So he clandestinely and secretly escapes from  his guarded palace; lays aside his princely habits and ornaments;  dismisses all attendants, and even his horse; seeks the companionship of  Brahmans, and learns all their penances and tortures. Finding a patient  trial of this of no avail for his purpose, he leaves the Brahmans, and  repairs to a quiet spot by the banks of a river, and for six years  practises the most severe fasting and profound meditation. This was the  form which piety had assumed in India from time immemorial, under the  guidance of the Brahmans; for Siddartha as yet is not the  \"enlightened,\"--he is only an inquirer after that saving knowledge which  will open the door of a divine felicity, and raise him above a world of  disease and death.    Siddartha's rigorous austerities, however, do not open this door of  saving truth. His body is wasted, and his strength fails; he is near  unto death. The conviction fastens on his lofty and inquiring mind that  to arrive at the end he seeks he must enter by some other door than  that of painful and useless austerities, and hence that the teachings of  the Brahmans are fundamentally wrong. He discovers that no amount of  austerities will extinguish desire, or produce ecstatic contemplation.  In consequence of these reflections a great change comes over him, which  is the turning-point of his history. He resolves to quit his  self-inflicted torments as of no avail. He meets a shepherd's daughter,  who offers him food out of compassion for his emaciated and miserable  condition. The rich rice milk, sweet and perfumed, restores his  strength. He renounces asceticism, and wanders to a spot more congenial  to his changed views and condition.    Siddartha's full enlightenment, however, has not yet come. Under the  shade of the Bodhi tree he devotes himself again to religious  contemplation, and falls into rapt ecstasies. He remains a while in  peaceful quiet; the morning sunbeams, the dispersing mists, and lovely  flowers seem to pay tribute to him. He passes through successive stages  of ecstasy, and suddenly upon his opened mind bursts the knowledge of  his previous births in different forms; of the causes of  re-birth,--ignorance (the root of evil) and unsatisfied desires; and of  the way to extinguish desires by right thinking, speaking, and living,  not by outward observance of forms and ceremonies. He is emancipated  from the thraldom of those austerities which have formed the basis of  religious life for generations unknown, and he resolves to teach.    Buddha travels slowly to the sacred city of Benares, converting by the  way even Brahmans themselves. He claims to have reached perfect wisdom.  He is followed by disciples, for there was something attractive and  extraordinary about him; his person was beautiful and commanding. While  he shows that painful austerities will not produce wisdom, he also  teaches that wisdom is not reached by self-indulgence; that there is a  middle path between penance and pleasures, even _temperance_,---the use,  but not abuse, of the good things of earth. In his first sermon he  declares that sorrow is in self; therefore to get rid of sorrow is to  get rid of self. The means to this end is to forget self in deeds of  mercy and kindness to others; to crucify demoralizing desires; to live  in the realm of devout contemplation.    The active life of Buddha now begins, and for fifty years he travels  from place to place as a teacher, gathers around him disciples, frames  rules for his society, and brings within his community both the rich and  poor. He even allows women to enter it. He thus matures his system,  which is destined to be embraced by so large a part of the human race,  and finally dies at the age of eighty, surrounded by reverential  followers, who see in him an incarnation of the Deity.    Thus Buddha devoted his life to the welfare of men, moved by an  exceeding tenderness and pity for the objects of misery which he beheld  on every side. He attempted to point out a higher life, by which sorrow  would be forgotten. He could not prevent sorrow culminating in old age,  disease, and death; but he hoped to make men ignore their miseries, and  thus rise above them to a beatific state of devout contemplation and the  practice of virtues, for which he laid down certain rules and  regulations.    It is astonishing how the new doctrines spread,--from India to China,  from China to Japan and Ceylon, until Eastern Asia was filled with  pagodas, temples, and monasteries to attest his influence; some  eighty-five thousand existed in China alone. Buddha probably had as many  converts in China as Confucius himself. The Buddhists from time to time  were subjected to great persecution from the emperors of China, in which  their sacred books were destroyed; and in India the Brahmans at last  regained their power, and expelled Buddhism from the country. In the  year 845 A.D. two hundred and sixty thousand monks and nuns were made to  return to secular life in China, being regarded as mere drones,--lazy  and useless members of the community. But the policy of persecution was  reversed by succeeding emperors. In the thirteenth century there were in  China nearly fifty thousand Buddhist temples and two hundred and  thirteen thousand monks; and these represented but a fraction of the  professed adherents of the religion. Under the present dynasty the  Buddhists are proscribed, but still they flourish.    Now, what has given to the religion of Buddha such an extraordinary  attraction for the people of Eastern Asia?    Buddhism has a twofold aspect,--_practical_ and _speculative_. In its  most definite form it was a moral and philanthropic movement,--the  reaction against Brahmanism, which had no humanity, and which was as  repulsive and oppressive as Roman Catholicism was when loaded down with  ritualism and sacerdotal rites, when Europe was governed by priests,  when churches were damp, gloomy crypts, before the tall cathedrals arose  in their artistic beauty.    From a religious and philosophical point of view, Buddhism at first did  not materially differ from Brahmanism. The same dreamy pietism, the same  belief in the transmigration of souls, the same pantheistic ideas of God  and Nature, the same desire for rest and final absorption in the divine  essence characterized both. In both there was a certain principle of  faith, which was a feeling of reverence rather than the recognition of  the unity and"]]]
