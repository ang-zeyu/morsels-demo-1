As soon as he  finds a foe near, no matter what he is doing, a well-trained Cottontail  keeps just as he is and stops all movement, for the creatures of the  woods are of the same color as the things in the woods and catch the eye  only while moving. So when enemies chance together, the one who first  sees the other can keep himself unseen by 'freezing' and thus have all  the advantage of choosing the time for attack or escape. Only those who  live in the woods know the importance of this; every wild creature and  every hunter must learn it; all learn to do it well, but not one of them  can beat Molly Cottontail in the doing. Rag's mother taught him this  trick by example. When the white cotton cushion that she always carried  to sit on went bobbing away through the woods, of course Rag ran his  hardest to keep up. But when Molly stopped and 'froze,' the natural wish  to copy made him do the same.           *       *       *       *       *    But the best lesson of all that Rag learned from his mother was the  secret of the Brierbrush. It is a very old secret now, and to make it  plain you must first hear why the Brierbrush quarrelled with the beasts.         _Long ago the Roses used to grow on bushes that had no thorns. But       the Squirrels and Mice used to climb after them, the cattle used to       knock them off with their horns, the Possum would twitch them off       with his long tail, and the Deer, with his sharp hoofs, would break       them down. So the Brierbrush armed itself with spikes to protect       its roses and declared eternal war on all creatures that climbed       trees, or had horns, or hoofs, or long tails. This left the       Brierbrush at peace with none but Molly Cottontail, who could not       climb, was hornless, hoof-less and had scarcely any tail at all.         In truth the Cottontail had never harmed a Brierrose, and having       now so many enemies the Rose took the Rabbit into especial       friendship, and when dangers are threatening poor Bunny he flies to       the nearest Brierbrush, certain that it is ready, with a million       keen and poisoned daggers, to defend him._    So the secret that Rag learned from his mother was, 'The Brierbrush is  your best friend.'    Much of the time that season was spent in learning the lay of the land,  and the bramble and brier mazes. And Rag learned them so well that he  could go all around the swamp by two different ways and never leave the  friendly briers at any place for more than five hops.    It is not long since the foes of the Cottontails were disgusted to find  that man had brought a new kind of bramble and planted it in long lines  throughout the country. It was so strong that no creatures could break  it down, and so sharp that the toughest skin was torn by it. Each year  there was more of it and each year it became a more serious matter to  the wild creatures. But Molly Cottontail had no fear of it. She was not  brought up in the briers for nothing. Dogs and foxes, cattle and sheep,  and even man himself might be torn by those fearful spikes: but Molly  understands it and lives and thrives under it. And the further it  spreads the more safe country there is for the Cottontail. And the name  of this new and dreaded bramble is--_the barbed-wire fence_.          III      Molly had no other children to look after now, so Rag had all her care.  He was unusually quick and bright as well as strong, and he had  uncommonly good chances; so he got on remarkably well.    All the season she kept him busy learning the tricks of the trail, and  what to eat and drink and what not to touch. Day by day she worked to  train him; little by little she taught him, putting into his mind  hundreds of ideas that her own life or early training had stored in  hers, and so equipped him with the knowledge that makes life possible to  their kind.    Close by her side in the clover-field or the thicket he would sit and  copy her when she wobbled her nose 'to keep her smeller clear,' and  pull the bite from her mouth or taste her lips to make sure he was  getting the same kind of fodder. Still copying her, he learned to comb  his ears with his claws and to dress his coat and to bite the burrs out  of his vest and socks. He learned, too, that nothing but clear dewdrops  from the briers were fit for a rabbit to drink, as water which has once  touched the earth must surely bear some taint. Thus he began the study  of woodcraft, the oldest of all sciences.    As soon as Rag was big enough to go out alone, his mother taught him the  signal code. Rabbits telegraph each other by thumping on the ground with  their hind feet. Along the ground sound carries far; a thump that at six  feet from the earth is not heard at twenty yards will, near the ground,  be heard at least one hundred yards. Rabbits have very keen hearing, and  so might hear this same thump at two hundred yards, and that would reach  from end to end of Olifant's Swamp. A single _thump_ means 'look out' or  'freeze.' A slow _thump thump_ means 'come.' A fast _thump thump_ means  'danger;' and a very fast _thump thump thump_ means 'run for dear life.'    At another time, when the weather was fine and the bluejays were  quarrelling among themselves, a sure sign that no dangerous foe was  about, Rag began a new study. Molly, by flattening her ears, gave the  sign to squat. Then she ran far away in the thicket and gave the  thumping signal for 'come.' Rag set out at a run to the place but could  not find Molly. He thumped, but got no reply. Setting carefully about  his search he found her foot-scent, and following this strange guide,  that the beasts all know so well and man does not know at all, he worked  out the trail and found her where she was hidden. Thus he got his first  lesson in trailing, and thus it was that the games of hide and seek they  played became the schooling for the serious chase of which there was so  much in his after-life.    Before that first season of schooling was over he had learnt all the  principal tricks by which a rabbit lives, and in not a few problems  showed himself a veritable genius.    He was an adept at 'tree,' 'dodge,' and 'squat;' he could play  'log-lump' with 'wind,' and 'baulk' with 'back-track' so well that he  scarcely needed any other tricks. He had not yet tried it, but he knew  just how to play 'barb-wire,' which is a new trick of the brilliant  order; he had made a special study of 'sand,' which burns up all scent,  and he was deeply versed in 'change-off,' 'fence,' and 'double,' as  well as 'hole-up,' which is a trick requiring longer notice, and yet he  never forgot that 'lay-low' is the beginning of all wisdom and  'brierbrush' the only trick that is always safe.    He was taught the signs by which to know all his foes and then the way  to baffle them. For hawks, owls, foxes, hounds, curs, minks, weasels,  cats, skunks, coons, and men, each have a different plan of pursuit, and  for each and all of these evils he was taught a remedy.    And for knowledge of the enemy's approach he learnt to depend first on  himself and his mother, and then on the bluejay. \"Never neglect the  bluejay's warning,\" said Molly; \"he is a mischief-maker, a marplot, and  a thief all the time, but nothing escapes him. He wouldn't mind harming  us, but he cannot, thanks to the briers, and his enemies are ours, so it  is well to heed him. If the woodpecker cries a warning you can trust  him, he is honest; but he is a fool beside the bluejay, and though the  bluejay often tells lies for mischief you are safe to believe him when  he brings ill news.\"    The barbed-wire trick takes a deal of nerve and the best of legs. It was  long before Rag ventured to play it, but as he came to his full powers  it became one of his favorites.    \"It's fine play for those who can do it,\" said Molly. \"First you lead  off your dog on a straightaway and warm him up a bit by nearly letting  him catch you. Then keeping just one hop ahead, you lead him at a long  slant full tilt into a breast-high barb-wire. I've seen many a dog and  fox crippled, and one big hound killed outright this way. But I've also  seen more than one rabbit lose his life in trying it.\"    Rag early learnt what some rabbits never learn at all, that 'hole-up' is  not such a fine ruse as it seems; it may be the certain safety of a wise  rabbit, but soon or late is a sure death-trap to a fool. A young rabbit  always thinks of it first, an old rabbit never tries it till all others  fail. It means escape from a man or dog, a fox or a bird of prey, but it  means sudden death if the foe is a ferret, mink, skunk, or weasel.    There were but two ground-holes in the Swamp. One on the Sunning Bank,  which was a dry sheltered knoll in the South-end. It was open and  sloping to the sun, and here on fine days the Cottontails took their  sunbaths. They stretched out among the fragrant pine needles and  winter-green in odd, cat-like positions, and turned slowly over as  though roasting and wishing all sides well done. And they blinked and  panted, and squirmed as if in dreadful pain; yet this was one of the  keenest enjoyments they knew.    Just over the brow of the knoll was a large pine stump. Its grotesque  roots wriggled out above the yellow sand-bank like dragons, and under  their protecting claws a sulky old woodchuck had digged a den long ago.  He became more sour and ill-tempered as weeks went by, and one day  waited to quarrel with Olifant's dog instead of going in, so that Molly  Cottontail was able to take possession of the den an hour later.    This, the pine-root hole, was afterward very coolly taken by a  self-sufficient young skunk, who with less valor might have enjoyed  greater longevity, for he imagined that even man with a gun would fly  from him. Instead of keeping Molly from the den for good, therefore, his  reign, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14241"],[0,"More English Fairy Tales (#10)"],[1," of  his sincerity, to come that night at twelve to the King's ball, just as  she was, with the herdboy and his geese, and in her torn petticoat and  bare feet, and he would dance with her before the King and the lords and  ladies, and present her to them all, as his dear and honoured bride.    So when night came, and the hall in the castle was full of light and  music, and the lords and ladies were dancing before the King, just as  the clock struck twelve, Tattercoats and the herdboy, followed by his  flock of noisy geese, entered at the great doors, and walked straight up  the ball-room, while on either side the ladies whispered, the lords  laughed, and the King seated at the far end stared in amazement.    But as they came in front of the throne, Tattercoats' lover rose from  beside the King, and came to meet her. Taking her by the hand, he kissed  her thrice before them all, and turned to the King.    [Illustration: TATTERCOATS.]    \"Father!\" he said, for it was the Prince himself, \"I have made my  choice, and here is my bride, the loveliest girl in all the land, and  the sweetest as well!\"    Before he had finished speaking, the herdboy put his pipe to his lips  and played a few low notes that sounded like a bird singing far off in  the woods; and as he played, Tattercoats' rags were changed to shining  robes sewn with glittering jewels, a golden crown lay upon her golden  hair, and the flock of geese behind her, became a crowd of dainty pages,  bearing her long train.    And as the King rose to greet her as his daughter, the trumpets sounded  loudly in honour of the new Princess, and the people outside in the  street said to each other:    \"Ah! now the Prince has chosen for his wife the loveliest girl in all  the land!\"    But the gooseherd was never seen again, and no one knew what became of  him; while the old lord went home once more to his Palace by the sea,  for he could not stay at Court, when he had sworn never to look on his  granddaughter's face.    So there he still sits by his window, if you could only see him, as you  some day may, weeping more bitterly than ever, as he looks out over the  sea.          The Wee Bannock           _\"Grannie, grannie, come tell us the story of the wee bannock.\"_         _\"Hout, childer, ye've heard it a hundred times afore. I needn't       tell it over again.\"_         _\"Ah! but, grannie, it's such a fine one. You must tell it. Just       once.\"_         _\"Well, well, if ye'll all promise to be good, I'll tell it ye       again.\"_    There lived an old man and an old woman at the side of a burn. They had  two cows, five hens, and a cock, a cat and two kittens. The old man  looked after the cows, and the old wife span on the distaff. The kittens  oft gripped at the old wife's spindle, as it tussled over the  hearthstone. \"Sho, sho,\" she would say, \"go away;\" and so it tussled  about.    One day, after breakfast, she thought she would have a bannock. So she  baked two oatmeal bannocks, and set them on to the fire to harden. After  a while, the old man came in, and sat down beside the fire, and takes  one of the bannocks, and snaps it through the middle. When the other one  sees this, it runs off as fast as it could, and the old wife after it,  with the spindle in the one hand, and the distaff in the other. But the  wee bannock ran away and out of sight, and ran till it came to a pretty  large thatched house, and it ran boldly up inside to the fireside; and  there were three tailors sitting on a big bench. When they saw the wee  bannock come in, they jumped up, and got behind the goodwife, that was  carding tow by the fire. \"Hout,\" quoth she, \"be no afeard; it's but a  wee bannock. Grip it, and I'll give ye a sup of milk with it.\" Up she  gets with the tow-cards and the tailor with the goose, and the two  'prentices, the one with the big shears, and the other with the lawbrod;  but it dodged them, and ran round about the fire; and one of the  'prentices, thinking to snap it with the shears, fell into the ashes.  The tailor cast the goose, and the goodwife the tow-cards; but it  wouldn't do. The bannock ran away, and ran till it came to a wee house  at the roadside; and in it runs and there was a weaver sitting at the  loom, and the wife winding a clue of yarn.    \"Tibby,\" quoth he, \"what's that?\"    \"Oh,\" quoth she, \"it's a wee bannock.\"    \"It's well come,\" quoth he, \"for our porrage were but thin to-day. Grip  it, my woman; grip it.\"    \"Ay,\" quoth she; \"what recks! That's a clever bannock. Catch it, Willie;  catch it, man.\"    \"Hout,\" quoth Willie, \"cast the clue at it.\"    But the bannock dodged round about, and off it went, and over the hill,  like a new-tarred sheep or a mad cow. And forward it runs to the  neat-house, to the fireside; and there was the goodwife churning.    \"Come away, wee bannock,\" quoth she; \"I'll have cream and bread to-day.\"  But the wee bannock dodged round about the churn, and the wife after it,  and in the hurry she had near-hand overturned the churn. And before she  got it set right again, the wee bannock was off and down the brae to the  mill; and in it ran.    The miller was sifting meal in the trough; but, looking up: \"Ay,\" quoth  he, \"it's a sign of plenty when ye're running about, and nobody to look  after ye. But I like a bannock and cheese. Come your way hither, and  I'll give ye a night's quarters.\" But the bannock wouldn't trust itself  with the miller and his cheese. So it turned and ran its way out; but  the miller didn't fash his head with it.    So it toddled away and ran till it came to the smithy; and in it runs,  and up to the anvil. The smith was making horse-nails. Quoth he: \"I like  a glass of good ale and a well-toasted bannock. Come your way in by  here.\" But the bannock was frightened when it heard about the ale, and  turned and was off as hard as it could, and the smith after it, and cast  the hammer. But it missed, and the bannock was out of sight in a crack,  and ran till it came to a farmhouse with a good peat-stack at the end of  it. Inside it runs to the fireside. The goodman was cloving lint, and  the goodwife heckling. \"O Janet,\" quoth he, \"there's a wee bannock; I'll  have the half of it.\"    \"Well, John, I'll have the other half. Hit it over the back with the  clove.\" But the bannock played dodgings. \"Hout, tout,\" quoth the wife,  and made the heckle flee at it. But it was too clever for her.    And off and up the burn it ran to the next house, and rolled its way to  the fireside. The goodwife was stirring the soup, and the goodman  plaiting sprit-binnings for the cows. \"Ho, Jock,\" quoth the goodwife,  \"here come. You're always crying about a wee bannock. Here's one. Come  in, haste ye, and I'll help ye to grip it.\"    \"Ay, mother, where is it?\"    \"See there. Run over on that side.\"    But the bannock ran in behind the goodman's chair. Jock fell among the  sprits. The goodman cast a binning, and the goodwife the spurtle. But it  was too clever for Jock and her both. It was off and out of sight in a  crack, and through among the whins, and down the road to the next house,  and in and snug by the fireside. The folk were just sitting down to  their soup, and the goodwife scraping the pot. \"Look,\" quoth she,  \"there's a wee bannock come in to warm itself at our fireside.\"    \"Shut the door,\" quoth the goodman, \"and we'll try to get a grip of it.\"    When the bannock heard that, it ran out of the house and they after it  with their spoons, and the goodman shied his hat. But it rolled away and  ran, and ran, till it came to another house; and when it went in the  folk were just going to their beds. The goodman was taking off his  breeches, and the goodwife raking the fire.    \"What's that?\" quoth he.    \"Oh,\" quoth she, \"it's a wee bannock.\"    Quoth he, \"I could eat the half of it.\"    \"Grip it,\" quoth the wife, \"and I'll have a bit too.\"    \"Cast your breeches at it!\" The goodman shied his breeches, and had  nearly smothered it. But it wriggled out and ran, and the goodman after  it without his breeches; and there was a clean chase over the craft  park, and in among the whins; and the goodman lost it, and had to come  away, trotting home half naked. But now it was grown dark, and the wee  bannock couldn't see; but it went into the side of a big whin bush, and  into a fox's hole. The fox had had no meat for two days. \"O welcome,  welcome,\" quoth the fox, and snapped it in two in the middle. And that  was the end of the wee bannock.          Johnny Gloke      Johnny Gloke was a tailor by trade, but like a man of spirit he grew  tired of his tailoring, and wished to follow some other path that would  lead to honour and fame. But he did not know what to do at first to gain  fame and fortune, so for a time he was fonder of basking idly in the sun  than in plying the needle and scissors. One warm day as he was enjoying  his ease, he was annoyed by the flies alighting on his bare ankles. He  brought his hand down on them with force and killed a goodly number of  them. On counting the victims of his valour, he was overjoyed at his  success; his heart rose to the doing of great deeds, and he gave vent to  his feelings in the saying:--         \"Well done! Johnny Gloke,        Kilt fifty flies at one stroke.\"    His resolution was now taken to cut out his path to fortune and honour.  So he took down from its resting-place a rusty old sword that had  belonged to some of his forebears, and set out in search of adventures.  After travelling a long way, he came to a country that was much troubled  by two giants, whom no one was bold enough to meet, and strong enough to  overcome. He was soon told of the giants, and learned that the King of  the country had offered a great reward and the hand of his daughter in  marriage to the man who should rid his land of this scourge. John's  heart rose to the deed, and he offered himself for the service. The  great haunt of the giants was a wood, and John set out with his old"]]]
