I take it for granted that the existence  of these evils is acknowledged, if not rightly understood. My object is  to define and enforce our duty, as Christians and philanthropists.\"    This was, by way of exordium, the powerful skirmish line of the address.  Assuming the existence of the evil, he advanced boldly to his theme,  viz., the duty of abolishing it. To this end he laid down four  propositions, as a skillful general plants his cannon on the heights  overlooking and commanding his enemies' works. The first, broadly  stated, asserted the kinship of the slave to the free population of the  republic. They were men; they were natives of the country; they were in  dire need. They were ignorant, degraded, morally and socially. They were  the heathen at home, whose claims far outranked those in foreign lands;  they were higher than those of the \"Turks or Chinese, for they have the  privileges of instruction; higher than the Pagans, for they are not  dwellers in a Gospel land; higher than our red men of the forest, for we  do not bind them with gyves, nor treat them as chattels.\"    Then he turned hotly upon the Church, exclaiming: \"What has Christianity  done by direct effort for our slave population? Comparatively nothing.  She has explored the isles of the ocean for objects of commiseration;  but, amazing stupidity! she can gaze without emotion on a multitude of  miserable beings at home, large enough to constitute a nation of  freemen, whom tyranny has heathenized by law. In her public services  they are seldom remembered, and in her private donations they are  forgotten. From one end of the country to the other her charitable  societies form golden links of benevolence, and scatter their  contributions like rain drops over a parched heath; but they bring no  sustenance to the perishing slave. The blood of souls is upon her  garments, yet she heeds not the stain. The clanking of the prisoner's  chains strike upon her ear, but they cannot penetrate her heart.\"    Then, with holy wrath upon the nation, thus:    \"Every Fourth of July our Declaration of Independence is produced, with  a sublime indignation, to set forth the tyranny of the mother country,  and to challenge the admiration of the world. But what a pitiful detail  of grievances does this document present, in comparison with the wrongs  which our slaves endure? In the one case it is hardly the plucking of a  hair from the head; in the other, it is the crushing of a live body on  the wheel--the stings of the wasp contrasted with the tortures of the  Inquisition. Before God I must say that such a glaring contradiction as  exists between our creed and practice the annals of six thousand years  cannot parallel. In view of it I am ashamed of my country. I am sick of  our unmeaning declamation in praise of liberty and equality; of our  hypocritical cant about the inalienable rights of man. I would not for  my right hand stand up before a European assembly, and exult that I am  an American citizen, and denounce the usurpations of a kingly government  as wicked and unjust; or, should I make the attempt, the recollection of  my country's barbarity and despotism would blister my lips, and cover my  cheeks with burning blushes of shame.\"    Passing to his second proposition, which affirmed the right of the free  States to be in at the death of slavery, he pointed out that slavery was  not sectional but national in its influence. If the consequences of  slave-holding did not flow beyond the limits of the slave section, the  right would still exist, on the principle that what affected injuriously  one part must ultimately hurt the whole body politic. But it was not  true that slavery concerned only the States where it existed--the parts  where it did not exist were involved by their constitutional liability  to be called on for aid in case of a slave insurrection, as they were in  the slave representation clause of the national compact, through which  the North was deprived of its \"just influence in the councils of the  nation.\" And, furthermore, the right of the free States to agitate the  question inhered in the principle of majority rule--the white population  of the free States being almost double that of the slave States, \"and  the voice of this overwhelming majority should be potential.\" He  repelled in strong language the wrongfulness of allowing the South to  multiply the votes of those freemen by the master's right to count three  for every five slaves, \"because it is absurd and anti-republican to  suffer property to be represented as men, and _vice versa_, because it  gives the South an unjust ascendancy over other portions of territory,  and a power which may be perverted on every occasion.\"    He looked without shrinking upon the possibility of disunion even then.    \"Now I say that, on the broad system of equal rights,\" he declared,  \"this inequality should no longer be tolerated. If it cannot be speedily  put down--not by force but by fair persuasion--if we are always to  remain shackled by unjust, constitutional provisions, when the emergency  that imposed them has long since passed away; if we must share in the  guilt and danger of destroying the bodies and souls of men _as the price  of our Union_; if the slave States will haughtily spurn our assistance,  and refuse to consult the general welfare, then the fault is not ours if  a separation eventually takes place.\"    Considering that he was in his twenty-fourth year, and that the  Abolition movement had then no actual existence, the orator evinced  surprising prescience in his forecast of the future, and of the strife  and hostility which the agitation was destined to engender.    \"But the plea is prevalent,\" he said, \"that any interference by the free  States, however benevolent or cautious it might be, would only irritate  and inflame the jealousies of the South, and retard the cause of  emancipation. If any man believes that slavery can be abolished without  a struggle with the worst passions of human nature, quietly,  harmoniously, he cherishes a delusion. It can never be done, unless the  age of miracles returns. No; we must expect a collision, full of sharp  asperities and bitterness. We shall have to contend with the insolence,  and pride, and selfishness of many a heartless being.    \"Sirs, the prejudices of the North are stronger than those of the South;  they bristle like so many bayonets around the slaves; they forge and  rivet the chains of the nation. Conquer them and the victory is won. The  enemies of emancipation take courage from our criminal timidity.... We  are ... afraid of our own shadows, who have been driven back to the wall  again and again; who stand trembling under their whips; who turn pale,  retreat, and surrender at a talismanic threat to dissolve the Union....\"  But the difficulties did not daunt him, nor the dangers cow him. He did  not doubt, but was assured, that truth was mighty and would prevail.  \"Moral influence when in vigorous exercise,\" he said, \"is irresistible.  It has an immortal essence. It can no more be trod out of existence by  the iron foot of time, or by the ponderous march of iniquity, than  matter can be annihilated. It may disappear for a time; but it lives in  some shape or other, in some place or other, and will rise with  renovated strength. Let us then be up and doing. In the simple and  stirring language of the stout-hearted Lundy, all the friends of the  cause must go to work, keep to work, hold on, and never give up.\" The  closing paragraph is this powerful peroration: \"I will say, finally,  that I despair of the republic while slavery exists therein. If I look  up to God for success, no smile of mercy or forgiveness dispels the  gloom of futurity; if to our own resources, they are daily diminishing;  if to all history our destruction is not only possible but almost  certain. Why should we slumber at this momentous crisis? If our hearts  were dead to every thought of humanity; if it were lawful to oppress,  where power is ample; still, if we had any regard for our safety and  happiness, we should strive to crush the vampire which is feeding upon  our life-blood. All the selfishness of our nature cries aloud for a  better security. Our own vices are too strong for us, and keep us in  perpetual alarm; how, in addition to these, shall we be able to contend  successfully with millions of armed and desperate men, as we must,  eventually, if slavery do not cease?\" Exit the apprentice, enter the  master. The period of preparation is ended, the time of action begun.  The address was the fiery cry of the young prophet ere he plunged into  the unsubdued wilderness of American slavery.            CHAPTER III.        THE MAN BEGINS HIS MINISTRY.      Some time in August, 1829, Garrison landed in Baltimore, and began with  Lundy the editorship of _The Genius of Universal Emancipation_. Radical  as the Park Street Church address was, it had, nevertheless, ceased to  represent in one essential matter his anti-slavery convictions and  principles. The moral impetus and ground-swell of the address had  carried him beyond the position where its first flood of feeling had for  the moment left him. During the composition of the address he was  transported with grief and indignation at the monstrous wrong which  slavery did the slaves and the nation. He had not thought out for  himself any means to rid both of the curse. The white heat of the  address destroyed for the instant all capacity for such thinking. \"Who  can be amazed, temperate, and furious--in a moment? No man. The  expedition of his violent love outran the pauser reason\" He had accepted  the colonization scheme as an instrument for removing the evil, and  called on all good citizens \"to assist in establishing auxiliary  colonization societies in every State, county, and town\"; and implored  \"their direct and liberal patronage to the parent society."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14558"],[0,"Darwinism (1889) (#10)"],[1,"cky, about five years  ago, there was one of these breeding-places, which stretched through the  woods in nearly a north and south direction, was several miles in  breadth, and was said to be upwards of 40 miles in extent. In this tract  almost every tree was furnished with nests wherever the branches could  accommodate them. The pigeons made their first appearance there about  the 10th of April, and left it altogether with their young before the  25th of May. As soon as the young were fully grown and before they left  the nests, numerous parties of the inhabitants from all parts of the  adjacent country came with waggons, axes, beds, cooking utensils, many  of them accompanied by the greater part of their families, and encamped  for several days at this immense nursery. Several of them informed me  that the noise was so great as to terrify their horses, and that it was  difficult for one person to hear another without bawling in his ear. The  ground was strewed with broken limbs of trees, eggs, and young squab  pigeons, which had been precipitated from above, and on which herds of  hogs were fattening. Hawks, buzzards, and eagles were sailing about in  great numbers, and seizing the squabs from the nests at pleasure; while,  from 20 feet upwards to the top of the trees, the view through the woods  presented a perpetual tumult of crowding and fluttering multitudes of  pigeons, their wings roaring like thunder, mingled with the frequent  crash of falling timber; for now the axemen were at work cutting down  those trees that seemed most crowded with nests, and contrived to fell  them in such a manner, that in their descent they might bring down  several others; by which means the falling of one large tree sometimes  produced 200 squabs little inferior in size to the old birds, and almost  one heap of fat. On some single trees upwards of a hundred nests were  found, each containing one squab only; a circumstance in the history of  the bird not generally known to naturalists.[11] It was dangerous to  walk under these flying and fluttering millions, from the frequent fall  of large branches, broken down by the weight of the multitudes above,  and which in their descent often destroyed numbers of the birds  themselves; while the clothes of those engaged in traversing the woods  were completely covered with the excrements of the pigeons.    \"These circumstances were related to me by many of the most respectable  part of the community in that quarter, and were confirmed in part by  what I myself witnessed. I passed for several miles through this same  breeding-place, where every tree was spotted with nests, the remains of  those above described. In many instances I counted upwards of ninety  nests on a single tree; but the pigeons had abandoned this place for  another, 60 or 80 miles off, towards Green River, where they were said  at that time to be equally numerous. From the great numbers that were  constantly passing over our heads to or from that quarter, I had no  doubt of the truth of this statement. The mast had been chiefly consumed  in Kentucky; and the pigeons, every morning a little before sunrise, set  out for the Indiana territory, the nearest part of which was about sixty  miles distant. Many of these returned before ten o'clock, and the great  body generally appeared on their return a little after noon. I had left  the public road to visit the remains of the breeding-place near  Shelbyville, and was traversing the woods with my gun, on my way to  Frankfort, when about ten o'clock the pigeons which I had observed  flying the greater part of the morning northerly, began to return in  such immense numbers as I never before had witnessed. Coming to an  opening by the side of a creek, where I had a more uninterrupted view, I  was astonished at their appearance: they were flying with great  steadiness and rapidity, at a height beyond gunshot, in several strata  deep, and so close together that, could shot have reached them, one  discharge could not have failed to bring down several individuals. From  right to left, as far as the eye could reach, the breadth of this vast  procession extended, seeming everywhere equally crowded. Curious to  determine how long this appearance would continue, I took out my watch  to note the time, and sat down to observe them. It was then half-past  one; I sat for more than an hour, but instead of a diminution of this  prodigious procession, it seemed rather to increase, both in numbers and  rapidity; and anxious to reach Frankfort before night, I rose and went  on. About four o'clock in the afternoon I crossed Kentucky River, at the  town of Frankfort, at which time the living torrent above my head seemed  as numerous and as extensive as ever. Long after this I observed them in  large bodies that continued to pass for six or eight minutes, and these  again were followed by other detached bodies, all moving in the same  south-east direction, till after six o'clock in the evening. The great  breadth of front which this mighty multitude preserved would seem to  intimate a corresponding breadth of their breeding-place, which, by  several gentlemen who had lately passed through part of it, was stated  to me at several miles.\"    From these various observations, Wilson calculated that the number of  birds contained in the mass of pigeons which he saw on this occasion was  at least two thousand millions, while this was only one of many similar  aggregations known to exist in various parts of the United States. The  picture here given of these defenceless birds, and their still more  defenceless young, exposed to the attacks of numerous rapacious enemies,  brings vividly before us one of the phases of the unceasing struggle for  existence ever going on; but when we consider the slow rate of increase  of these birds, and the enormous population they are nevertheless able  to maintain, we must be convinced that in the case of the majority of  birds which multiply far more rapidly, and yet are never able to attain  such numbers, the struggle against their numerous enemies and against  the adverse forces of nature must be even more severe or more  continuous.      _Struggle for Life between, closely allied Animals and Plants often the  most severe._    The struggle we have hitherto been considering has been mainly that  between an animal or plant and its direct enemies, whether these enemies  are other animals which devour it, or the forces of nature which destroy  it. But there is another kind of struggle often going on at the same  time between closely related species, which almost always terminates in  the destruction of one of them. As an example of what is meant, Darwin  states that the recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of  Scotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush.[12] The black rat  (Mus rattus) was the common rat of Europe till, in the beginning of the  eighteenth century, the large brown rat (Mus decumanus) appeared on the  Lower Volga, and thence spread more or less rapidly till it overran all  Europe, and generally drove out the black rat, which in most parts is  now comparatively rare or quite extinct. This invading rat has now been  carried by commerce all over the world, and in New Zealand has  completely extirpated a native rat, which the Maoris allege they brought  with them from their home in the Pacific; and in the same country a  native fly is being supplanted by the European house-fly. In Russia the  small Asiatic cockroach has driven away a larger native species; and in  Australia the imported hive-bee is exterminating the small stingless  native bee.    The reason why this kind of struggle goes on is apparent if we consider  that the allied species fill nearly the same place in the economy of  nature. They require nearly the same kind of food, are exposed to the  same enemies and the same dangers. Hence, if one has ever so slight an  advantage over the other in procuring food or in avoiding danger, in its  rapidity of multiplication or its tenacity of life, it will increase  more rapidly, and by that very fact will cause the other to decrease and  often become altogether extinct. In some cases, no doubt, there is  actual war between the two, the stronger killing the weaker; but this is  by no means necessary, and there may be cases in which the weaker  species, physically, may prevail, by its power of more rapid  multiplication, its better withstanding vicissitudes of climates, or its  greater cunning in escaping the attacks of the common enemies. The same  principle is seen at work in the fact that certain mountain varieties of  sheep will starve out other mountain varieties, so that the two cannot  be kept together. In plants the same thing occurs. If several distinct  varieties of wheat are sown together, and the mixed seed resown, some of  the varieties which best suit the soil and climate, or are naturally the  most fertile, will beat the others and so yield more seed, and will  consequently in a few years supplant the other varieties.    As an effect of this principle, we seldom find closely allied species  of animals or plants living together, but often in distinct though  adjacent districts where the conditions of life are somewhat different.  Thus we may find cowslips (Primula veris) growing in a meadow, and  primroses (P. vulgaris) in an adjoining wood, each in abundance, but not  often intermingled. And for the same reason the old turf of a pasture or  heath consists of a great variety of plants matted together, so much so  that in a patch little more than a yard square Mr. Darwin found twenty  distinct species, belonging to eighteen distinct genera and to eight  natural orders, thus showing their extreme diversity of organisation.  For the same reason a number of distinct grasses and clovers are sown in  order to make a good lawn instead of any one species; and the quantity  of hay produced has been found to be greater from a variety"]]]
