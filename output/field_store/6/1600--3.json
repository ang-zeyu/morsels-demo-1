Instantly their already pale faces  grew paler.    \"Why,\" cried one, a boy, \"don't you know? That is where the two wicked  men lived who stole the money out of the Rutland bank. They were put in  prison, but they got away and--\"    Here, the other, a little girl, plucked him by the sleeve with such  affright, that he himself took alarm and just giving me one quick stare  out of his wide eyes, grasped his companion by the hand and took to his  heels. As for myself I stood rooted to the ground in my astonishment.  This blank, sleepy old house the home of the notorious Schoenmakers  after whom half of the detectives of the country were searching? I could  scarcely credit my own ears. True I now remembered they had come from  these parts, still--    Turning round I eyed the house once more. How altered it looked to me!  What a murderous aspect it wore, and how dismally secret were the tight  shut windows and closely fastened doors, on one of which a rude cross  scrawled in red chalk met the eye with a mysterious significance. Even  the old pine had acquired the villainous air of the uncanny repositor of  secrets too dreadful to reveal, as it groaned and murmured to itself in  the keen east wind. Dark deeds and foul wrong seemed written all over  the fearful place, from the long strings of black moss that clung to  the worm-eaten eaves, to the worn stone with its great blotch of  something,--could it have been blood?--that served as a threshold to  the door. Suddenly with the quickness of lightning the thought flashed  across me, what could Mr. Blake, the aristocratic representative of New  York's oldest family, have wanted in this nest of infamy? What errand  of hope, fear, despair, avarice or revenge, could have brought this  superior gentleman with his refined tastes and proudly reticent manners,  so many miles from home, to the forsaken den of a brace of hardy  villains whose name for two years now, had stood as the type of all that  was bold, bad and lawless, and for whom during the last six weeks the  prison had yawned, and the gallows hungered. Contemplation brought  no reply, and shocked at my own thoughts, I put the question by for  steadier brains than mine; and instead of trying further to solve it,  cast about how I was to gain entrance into this deserted building; for  to enter it I was more than ever determined, now that I had heard to  whom it had once belonged.    Examining with a glance the several roads that branched off in every  direction from where I stood, I found them all equally deserted. Even  the school children had disappeared in some one of the four or five  houses scattered in the remote distance.    If I was willing to enter upon any daring exploit, there was no one to  observe or interrupt. I resolved to make the attempt with which my mind  was full. This was to climb the old tree, and from one of the two or  three branches that brushed against the house, gain entrance at an  open garret window that stared at me from amid the pine's dark needles.  Taking off my coat with a sigh over the immaculate condition of my new  cassimere trousers, I bent my energies to the task. A difficult one you  will say for a city lad, but thanks to fortune I was not brought up in  New York, and know how to climb trees with the best. With little more  than a scratch or so, I reached the window of which I have spoken,  and after a moment spent in regaining my breath, gave one spring and  accomplished my purpose. I alighted upon a heap of broken glass in a  large bare room. An ominous chill at once struck to my heart. Though  I am anything but a sensitive man as far as physical impressions are  concerned, there was something in the hollow echo that arose from the  four blank walls about me as my feet alighted on that rough, uncarpeted  floor, that struck a vague chill through my blood, and I actually  hesitated for the moment whether to pursue the investigations I had  promised myself, or beat a hasty retreat. A glance at the huge distorted  limbs swaying across the square of the open window decided me. It  was easy to enter by means of that unsteady support, but it would be  extremely unsafe to venture forth in that way. If I prized life and limb  I must seek some other method of egress. I at once put my apprehensions  in my pocket and entered upon my self imposed task.    A single glance was sufficient to exhaust the resources of the empty  garret in which I found myself. Two or three old chairs piled in one  corner, a rusty stove or so, a heap of tattered and decaying clothing,  were all that met my gaze. Taking my way, then, at once to the ladder,  whose narrow ends projecting above a hole in the garret floor, seemed  to proffer the means of reaching the rooms below, I proceeded to descend  into what to my excited imagination looked like a gulf of darkness. It  proved, however, to be nothing more nor less than an unlighted hall of  small dimensions, with a stair-case at one end and a door at the other,  which, upon opening I found myself in a large, square room whose immense  four-post bedstead entirely denuded of its usual accompaniments of bed  and bolster at once struck my eye and for a moment held it enchained.  There were other articles in the room; a disused bureau, a rocking  chair, even a table, but nothing had such a ghostly look as that antique  bedstead with its curtains of calico tied back over its naked framework,  like rags draped from the bare bones of a skeleton. Passing hurriedly  by, I tried a closet door or so, finding little, however, to reward my  search; and eager to be done with what was every moment becoming more  and more drearisome, I hastened across the floor to the front of the  house where I found another hall and a row of rooms that, while not  entirely stripped of furniture, were yet sufficiently barren to  offer little encouragement to my curiosity. One only, a small but not  uncomfortable apartment, showed any signs of having been occupied within  a reasonable length of time; and as I paused before its hastily spread  bed, thrown together as only a man would do it, and wondering why the  room was so dark, looked up and saw that the window was entirely covered  by an old shawl and a couple of heavy coats that had been hastily nailed  across it, I own I felt my hand go to my breast pocket almost as if I  expected to see the wild faces of the dreaded Schoenmakers start up all  aglare from one of the dim corners before me. Rushing to the window, I  tore down with one sweep of my arm both coat and shawl, and with a start  discovered that the window still possessed its draperies in the shape of  a pair of discolored and tattered curtains tied with ribbons that must  once have been brilliant and cheery of color.    Nor was this the only sign in the room of a bygone presence that had  possessed a taste for something beyond the mere necessities of life.  On the grim coarsely papered wall hung more than one picture; cut from  pictorial newspapers to be sure, but each and every one, if I may be  called a judge of such matters, possessing some quality of expression to  commend it to a certain order of taste. They were all strong pictures.  Vivid faces of men and women in daring positions; a hunter holding back  a jaguar from his throat; a soldier protecting his comrade from the  stroke; and most striking of all, a woman lissome as she was powerful,  starting aghast and horror stricken from--what? I could not tell; a  rough hand had stripped the remainder of the picture from the wall.    A bit of candle and a half sheet of a newspaper lay on the floor. I  picked up the paper. It was a Rutland Herald and bore the date of two  days before. As I read I realized what I had done. If these daring  robbers were not at this very moment in the house, they had been there,  and that within two or three days. The broken panes of glass in the  garret above were now explained. I was not the first one who had climbed  that creaking pine tree this fall.    Something like a sensible dread of a very possible danger now seized  hold of me. If I had stumbled upon these strangely subtile, yet  devilishly bold creatures in their secret lair, the pistol I carried was  not going to save me. Shut in like a fox in a hole, I had little to hope  for, if they once made their appearance at the stairhead or came upon me  from any of the dim halls of the crazy old dwelling, which I now began  to find altogether too large for my comfort. Stealing cautiously forth  from the room in which I had found so much to disconcert me, I crept  towards the front staircase and listened. All was deathly quiet. The  old pine tree moaned and twisted without, and from time to time the wind  came sweeping down the chimney with an unearthly shrieking sound that  was weirdly in keeping with the place. But within and below all was  still as the tomb, and though in no ways reassured, I determined to  descend and have the suspense over at once. I did so, pistol in hand  and ears stretched to their utmost to catch the slightest rustle, but no  sound came to disturb me, nor did I meet on this lower floor the sign of  any other presence in the house but my own. Passing hastily through what  appeared to be a sort of rude parlor, I stepped into the kitchen and  tried one of the windows. Finding I could easily lift it from the  inside, I drew my breath with ease for the first time since I had  alighted among the broken glass above, and turning back, deliberately  opened the door of the kitchen stove, and looked in. As I half expected,  I found a pile of partly charred rags, showing where the wretches had  burned their prison clothing, and proceeding further, picked up from  the ashes a ring which whether or not they were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11692"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 03 (#10)"],[1," whitening lips--behold!     The secret have already told.     Into their Judgment Court sublime       The Scene is changed;--their doom is seal'd!     Behold the dark unwitness'd Crime,       Struck by the lightning that reveal'd!           *       *       *       *       *        THE WORDS OF BELIEF (1797)        Three Words will I name thee--around and about,      From the lip to the lip, full of meaning, they flee;    But they had not their birth in the being without,      And the heart, not the lip, must their oracle be!    And all worth in the man shall for ever be o'er    When in those Three Words he believes no more.      Man is made FREE!--Man, by birthright, is free,      Though the tyrant may deem him but born for his tool.    Whatever the shout of the rabble may be--      Whatever the ranting misuse of the fool--    Still fear not the Slave, when he breaks from his chain,    For the Man made a Freeman grows safe in his gain.      And Virtue is more than a shade or a sound,      And Man may her voice, in this being, obey;    And though ever he slip on the stony ground,      Yet, ever again to the godlike way,    To the _science_ of Good though the Wise may be blind,    Yet the _practice_ is plain to the childlike mind.      And a God there is--over Space, over Time;      While the Human Will rocks, like a reed, to and fro,    Lives the Will of the Holy--A Purpose Sublime,      A Thought woven over creation below;    Changing and shifting the All we inherit,    But changeless through all One Immutable Spirit!      Hold fast the Three Words of Belief--though about      From the lip to the lip, full of meaning, they flee;    Yet they take not their birth from the being without--      But a voice from within must their oracle be;    And never all worth in the Man can be o'er,    Till in those Three Words he believes no more.           *       *       *       *       *        THE WORDS OF ERROR (1799)        Three Errors there are, that for ever are found      On the lips of the good, on the lips of the best;    But empty their meaning and hollow their sound--      And slight is the comfort they bring to the breast.      The fruits of existence escape from the clasp    Of the seeker who strives but those shadows to grasp--    So long as Man dreams of some Age in _this_ life      When the Right and the Good will all evil subdue;    For the Right and the Good lead us ever to strife,      And wherever they lead us, the Fiend will pursue.      And (till from the earth borne, and stifled at length)    The earth that he touches still gifts him with strength![10]    So long as Man fancies that Fortune will live,      Like a bride with her lover, united with Worth;    For her favors, alas! to the mean she will give--      And Virtue possesses no title to earth!    That Foreigner wanders to regions afar,    Where the lands of her birthright immortally are!      So long as Man dreams that, to mortals a gift,      The Truth in her fulness of splendor will shine;    The veil of the goddess no earth-born may lift,      And all we can learn is--to guess and divine I    Dost thou seek, in a dogma, to prison her form?    The spirit flies forth on the wings of the storm!    O, Noble Soul! fly from delusions like these,      More heavenly belief be it thine to adore;    Where the Ear never hearkens, the Eye never sees,      Meet the rivers of Beauty and Truth evermore!    Not _without_ thee the streams--there the Dull seek them;--No!    Look _within_ thee--behold both the fount and the flow!           *       *       *       *       *      [Illustration: THE LAY OF THE BELL JULIUS BENEZUR]    THE LAY OF THE BELL[11] (1799)        \"_Vivos voco--Mortuos plango--Fulgura frango_.\" [12]      I        Fast in its prison-walls of earth,        Awaits the mold of baked clay.      Up, comrades, up, and aid the birth--        THE BELL that shall be born today!          Who would honor obtain,          With the sweat and the pain,    The praise that Man gives to the Master must buy!--    But the blessing withal must descend from on high!        And well an earnest word beseems          The work the earnest hand prepares;        Its load more light the labor deems,          When sweet discourse the labor shares.        So let us ponder--nor in vain--          What strength can work when labor wills;        For who would not the fool disdain          Who ne'er designs what he fulfils?        And well it stamps our Human Race,          And hence the gift To UNDERSTAND,        That Man within the heart should trace          Whate'er he fashions with the hand.      II          From the fir the faggot take,          Keep it, heap it hard and dry,        That the gathered flame may break          Through the furnace, wroth and high.            When the copper within            Seethes and simmers--the tin    Pour quick, that the fluid that feeds the Bell    May flow in the right course glib and well.        Deep hid within this nether cell,            What force with Fire is molding thus        In yonder airy tower shall dwell,          And witness wide and far of us!        It shall, in later days, unfailing,          Rouse many an ear to rapt emotion;        Its solemn voice with Sorrow wailing,          Or choral chiming to Devotion.        Whatever Fate to Man may bring,          Whatever weal or woe befall,        That metal tongue shall backward ring          The warning moral drawn from all.      III          See the silvery bubbles spring!          Good! the mass is melting now!        Let the salts we duly bring          Purge the flood, and speed the flow.            From the dross and the scum,            Pure, the fusion must come;    For perfect and pure we the metal must keep,    That its voice may be perfect, and pure, and deep.          That voice, with merry music rife,            The cherished child shall welcome in,          What time the rosy dreams of life            In the first slumber's arms begin;         As yet in Time's dark womb unwarning,            Repose the days, or foul or fair,         And watchful o'er that golden morning,            The Mother-Love's untiring care!         And swift the years like arrows fly--            No more with girls content to play,    Fast in its prison-walls of earth,      Awaits the mold of baked clay.    Up, comrades, up, and aid the birth--      The BELL that shall be born to-day!      Bounds the proud Boy upon his way,        Storms through loud life's tumultuous pleasures,        With pilgrim staff the wide world measures;        And, wearied with the wish to roam,        Again seeks, stranger-like, the Father-Home.        And, lo, as some sweet vision breaks          Out from its native morning skies,        With rosy shame on downcast cheeks,          The Virgin stands before his eyes.        A nameless longing seizes him!          From all his wild companions flown;        Tears, strange till then, his eyes bedim;          He wanders all alone.        Blushing, he glides where'er she move;          Her greeting can transport him;        To every mead to deck his love,          The happy wild flowers court him!        Sweet Hope--and tender Longing--ye          The growth of Life's first Age of Gold,        When the heart, swelling, seems to see          The gates of heaven unfold!    O Love, the beautiful and brief! O prime,    Glory, and verdure, of life's summertime!      IV            Browning o'er, the pipes are simmering,          Dip this wand of clay[13] within;          If like glass the wand be glimmering,            Then the casting may begin.              Brisk, brisk now, and see              If the fusion flow free;      If--(happy and welcome indeed were the sign!)      If the hard and the ductile united combine.    For still where the strong is betrothed to the weak,    And the stern in sweet marriage is blent with the meek,      Rings the concord harmonious, both tender and strong:    So be it with thee, if forever united,    The heart to the heart flows in one, love-delighted;      Illusion is brief, but Repentance is long.        Lovely, thither are they bringing,          With her virgin wreath, the Bride!        To the love-feast clearly ringing,          Tolls the church-bell far and wide!        With that sweetest holyday,          Must the May of Life depart;        With the cestus loosed--away          Flies ILLUSION from the heart!            Yet love lingers lonely,              When Passion is mute,            And the blossoms may only              Give way to the fruit.            The Husband must enter              The hostile life;              With struggle and strife,              To plant or to watch,              To snare or to snatch,              To pray and importune,            Must wager and venture              And hunt down his fortune!    Then flows in a current the gear and the gain,    And the garners are filled with the gold of the grain,    Now a yard to the court, now a wing to the centre!      Within sits Another,        The thrifty Housewife;      The mild one, the mother--        Her home is her life.      In its circle she rules,      And the daughters she schools,        And she cautions the boys,      With a bustling command,      And a diligent hand        Employed she employs;          Gives order to store,          And the much makes the more;    Locks the chest and the wardrobe, with lavender smelling,    And the hum of the spindle goes quick through the dwelling,    And she hoards in the presses, well polished and full,    The snow of the linen, the shine of the wool;    Blends the sweet with the good, and from care and endeavor    Rests never!          Blithe the Master (where the while          From his roof he sees them smile)            Eyes the lands, and counts the gain;          There, the beams projecting far,          And the laden store-house are,          And the granaries bowed beneath            The "]]]
