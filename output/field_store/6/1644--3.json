And as they tore and strove and tumbled, the king ever and anon smote at  the giant with his dagger, till his arms stiffened in death around King  Arthur's body, and groaning horribly, he died. So presently the two  knights came and found the king locked fast in the giant's arms, and very  faint and weary, and loosed him from their hold.    Then the king bade Sir Key to \"smite off the giant's head and set it on  the truncheon of a spear, and bear it to Sir Hoel, and tell him that his  enemy is slain; and afterwards let it be fastened to the castle gate, that  all the people may behold it. And go ye two up on the mountain and fetch  me my shield and sword, and also the great club of iron ye will see there;  and as for the treasure, ye shall find there wealth beyond counting, but  take as much as ye will, for if I have his kirtle and the club, I desire  no more.\"    Then the knights fetched the club and kirtle, as the king had ordered, and  took the treasure to themselves, as much as they could carry, and returned  to the army. But when this deed was noised abroad, all the people came in  multitudes to thank the king, who told them \"to give thanks to God, and to  divide the giant's spoils amongst them equally.\" And King Arthur desired  Sir Hoel to build a church upon the mount, and dedicate it to the  Archangel Michael.    On the morrow, all the host moved onwards into the country of Champagne,  and Flollo, the Roman tribune, retired before them into Paris. But while  he was preparing to collect more forces from the neighbouring countries,  King Arthur came upon him unawares, and besieged him in the town.    And when a month had passed, Flollo--full of grief at the starvation of  his people, who died in hundreds day by day--sent to King Arthur, and  desired that they two might fight together; for he was a man of mighty  stature and courage, and thought himself sure of the victory. This  challenge, King Arthur, full weary the siege, accepted with great joy, and  sent back word to Flollo that he would meet him whensoever he appointed.    And a truce being made on both sides, they met together the next day on  the island without the city, where all the people also were gathered to  see the issue. And as the king and Flollo rode up to the lists, each was  so nobly armed and horsed, and sat so mightily upon his saddle, that no  man could tell which way the battle would end.    When they had saluted one another, and presented themselves against each  other with their lances aloft, they put spurs to their horses and began a  fierce encounter. But King Arthur, carrying his spear more warily, struck  it on the upper part of Flollo's breast, and flung him from his saddle to  the earth. Then drawing his sword, he cried to him to rise, and rushed  upon him; but Flollo, starting up, met him with his spear couched, and  pierced the breast of King Arthur's horse, and overthrew both horse and  man.    The Britons, when they saw their king upon the ground, could scarcely keep  themselves from breaking up the truce and falling on the Gauls. But as  they were about to burst the barriers, and rush upon the lists, King  Arthur hastily arose, and, guarding himself with his shield, ran with  speed on Flollo. And now they renewed the assault with great rage, being  sorely bent upon each other's death.    At length, Flollo, seizing his advantage, gave King Arthur a huge stroke  upon the helm, which nigh overthrew him, and drew forth his blood in  streams.    But when King Arthur saw his armour and shield red with blood, he was  inflamed with fury, and lifting up Excalibur on high, with all his might,  he struck straight through the helmet into Flollo's head, and smote it  into halves; and Flollo falling backwards, and tearing up the ground with  his spurs, expired.    As soon as this news spread, the citizens all ran together, and, opening  the gates, surrendered the city to the conqueror.    And when he had overrun the whole province with his arms, and reduced it  everywhere to subjection, he returned again to Britain, and held his court  at Caerleon, with greater state than ever.    Anon he invited thereto all the kings, dukes, earls, and barons, who owed  him homage, that he might treat them royally, and reconcile them to each  other, and to his rule.    And never was there a city more fit and pleasant for such festivals. For  on one side it was washed by a noble river, so that the kings and princes  from the countries beyond sea might conveniently sail up to it; and on the  other side, the beauty of the groves and meadows, and the stateliness and  magnificence of the royal palaces, with lofty gilded roofs, made it even  rival the grandeur of Rome. It was famous also for two great and noble  churches, whereof one was built in honour of the martyr Julius, and  adorned with a choir of virgins who had devoted themselves wholly to the  service of God; and the other, founded in memory of St. Aaron, his  companion, maintained a convent of canons, and was the third metropolitan  church of Britain. Besides, there was a college of two hundred  philosophers, learned in astronomy, and all the other sciences and arts.    In this place, therefore, full of such delights, King Arthur held his  court, with many jousts and tournaments, and royal huntings, and rested  for a season after all his wars.    And on a certain day there came into the court a messenger from Ryence,  King of North Wales, bearing this message from his master: That King  Ryence had discomfited eleven kings, and had compelled each one of them to  cut off his beard; that he had trimmed a mantle with these beards, and  lacked but one more beard to finish it; and that he therefore now sent for  King Arthur's beard, which he required of him forthwith, or else he would  enter his lands and burn and slay, and never leave them till he had taken  by force not his beard only, but his head also.    When King Arthur heard these words he flushed all scarlet, and rising in  great anger said, \"Well is it for thee that thou speakest another man's  words with thy lips, and not thine own. Thou hast said thy message, which  is the most insolent and villainous that ever man heard sent to any king:  now hear my reply. My beard is yet too young to trim that mantle of thy  master's with; yet, young although I be, I owe no homage either to him or  any man--nor will ever owe. But, young although I be, I will have thy  master's homage upon both his knees before this year be past, or else he  shall lose his head, by the faith of my body, for this message is the  shamefullest I ever heard speak of. I see well thy king hath never yet met  with a worshipful man; but tell that King Arthur will have his head or his  worship right soon.\"    Then the messenger departed, and Arthur, looking round upon his knights,  demanded of them if any there knew this King Ryence. \"Yea,\" answered Sir  Noran, \"I know him well, and there be few better or stronger knights upon  a field than he; and he is passing proud and haughty in his heart;  wherefore I doubt not, Lord, he will make war on thee with mighty power.\"    \"Well,\" said King Arthur, \"I shall be ready for him, and that shall he  find.\"    While the king thus spoke, there came into the hall a damsel having on a  mantle richly furred, which she let fall and showed herself to be girded  with a noble sword. The king being surprised at this, said, \"Damsel,  wherefore art thou girt with that sword, for it beseemeth thee not?\"  \"Sir,\" said she, \"I will tell thee. This sword wherewith I am thus girt  gives me great sorrow and encumbrance, for I may not be delivered from it  till I find a knight faithful and pure and true, strong of body and of  valiant deeds, without guile or treachery, who shall be able to draw it  from its scabbard, which no man else can do. And I have but just now come  from the court of King Ryence, for there they told me many great and good  knights were to be ever found; but he and all his knights have tried to  draw it forth in vain--for none of them can move it.\"    \"This is a great marvel,\" said King Arthur; \"I will myself try to draw  forth this sword, not thinking in my heart that I am the best knight, but  rather to begin and give example that all may try after me.\" Saying this,  he took the sword and pulled at it with all his might, but could not shake  or move it.    \"Thou needest not strive so hard, Lord,\" said the damsel, \"for whoever may  be able to pull it forth shall do so very easily.\" \"Thou sayest well,\"  replied the king, remembering how he had himself drawn forth the sword  from the stone before St. Paul's. \"Now try ye, all my barons; but beware  ye be not stained with shame, or any treachery, or guile.\" And turning  away his face from them, King Arthur mused full heavily of sins within his  breast he knew of, and which his failure brought to mind right sadly.    Then all the barons present tried each after other, but could none of them  succeed; whereat the damsel greatly wept, and said, \"Alas, alas! I thought  in this court to have found the best knight, without shame or treachery or  treason.\"    Now by chance there was at that time a poor knight with King Arthur, who  had been prisoner at his court for half a year and more, charged with  slaying unawares a knight who was a cousin of the king's. He was named  Balin le Savage, and had been by the good offices of the barons delivered  from prison, for he was of good and valiant address and gentle blood. He  being secretly present at the court saw this adventure, and felt his heart  rise high within him, and longed to try the sword as did the others; but  being poor and poorly clad, he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12758"],[0,"Library of the World's Best Mystery and Detective Stories (#10)"],[1,"spirits, of fairies, of gnomes, ghosts, I might  even say the legend of God, for our conceptions of the workman-creator,  from whatever religion they may have come down to us, are certainly the  most mediocre, the stupidest and the most unacceptable inventions that  ever sprang from the frightened brain of any human creatures. Nothing  is truer than what Voltaire says: 'God made man in His own image, but  man has certainly paid Him back again.'    \"But for rather more than a century, men seem to have had a  presentiment of something new. Mesmer and some others have put us on an  unexpected track, and especially within the last two or three years, we  have arrived at really surprising results.\"    My cousin, who is also very incredulous, smiled, and Dr. Parent said to  her: \"Would you like me to try and send you to sleep, Madame?\" \"Yes,  certainly.\"    She sat down in an easy-chair, and he began to look at her fixedly, so  as to fascinate her. I suddenly felt myself somewhat uncomfortable,  with a beating heart and a choking feeling in my throat. I saw that  Madame Sable's eyes were growing heavy, her mouth twitched and her  bosom heaved, and at the end of ten minutes she was asleep.    \"Stand behind her,\" the doctor said to me, and so I took a seat behind  her. He put a visiting card into her hands, and said to her: \"This is a  looking-glass; what do you see in it?\" And she replied: \"I see my  cousin.\" \"What is he doing?\" \"He is twisting his mustache.\" \"And now?\"  \"He is taking a photograph out of his pocket.\" \"Whose photograph is  it?\" \"His own.\"    That was true, and that photograph had been given me that same evening  at the hotel.    \"What is his attitude in this portrait?\" \"He is standing up with his  hat in his hand.\"    So she saw on that card, on that piece of white pasteboard, as if she  had seen it in a looking glass.    The young women were frightened, and exclaimed: \"That is quite enough!  Quite, quite enough!\"    But the doctor said to her authoritatively: \"You will get up at eight  o'clock to-morrow morning; then you will go and call on your cousin at  his hotel and ask him to lend you five thousand francs which your  husband demands of you, and which he will ask for when he sets out on  his coming journey.\"    Then he woke her up.    On returning to my hotel, I thought over this curious _seance_ and I  was assailed by doubts, not as to my cousin's absolute and undoubted  good faith, for I had known her as well as if she had been my own  sister ever since she was a child, but as to a possible trick on the  doctor's part. Had not he, perhaps, kept a glass hidden in his hand,  which he showed to the young woman in her sleep, at the same time as he  did the card? Professional conjurers do things which are just as  singular.    So I went home and to bed, and this morning, at about half-past eight,  I was awakened by my footman, who said to me: \"Madame Sable has asked  to see you immediately, Monsieur,\" so I dressed hastily and went to  her.    She sat down in some agitation, with her eyes on the floor, and without  raising her veil she said to me: \"My dear cousin, I am going to ask a  great favor of you.\" \"What is it, cousin?\" \"I do not like to tell you,  and yet I must. I am in absolute want of five thousand francs.\" \"What,  you?\" \"Yes, I, or rather my husband, who has asked me to procure them  for him.\"    I was so stupefied that I stammered out my answers. I asked myself  whether she had not really been making fun of me with Doctor Parent,  if it were not merely a very well-acted farce which had been got up  beforehand. On looking at her attentively, however, my doubts  disappeared. She was trembling with grief, so painful was this step  to her, and I was sure that her throat was full of sobs.    I knew that she was very rich and so I continued: \"What! Has not your  husband five thousand francs at his disposal! Come, think. Are you sure  that he commissioned you to ask me for them?\"    She hesitated for a few seconds, as if she were making a great effort  to search her memory, and then she replied: \"Yes ... yes, I am quite  sure of it.\" \"He has written to you?\"    She hesitated again and reflected, and I guessed the torture of her  thoughts. She did not know. She only knew that she was to borrow five  thousand francs of me for her husband. So she told a lie. \"Yes, he has  written to me.\" \"When, pray? You did not mention it to me yesterday.\"  \"I received his letter this morning.\" \"Can you show it me?\" \"No; no ...  no ... it contained private matters ... things too personal to  ourselves.... I burnt it.\" \"So your husband runs into debt?\"    She hesitated again, and then murmured: \"I do not know.\" Thereupon I  said bluntly: \"I have not five thousand francs at my disposal at this  moment, my dear cousin.\"    She uttered a kind of cry as if she were in pain and said: \"Oh! oh! I  beseech you, I beseech you to get them for me....\"    She got excited and clasped her hands as if she were praying to me! I  heard her voice change its tone; she wept and stammered, harassed and  dominated by the irresistible order that she had received.    \"Oh! oh! I beg you to ... if you knew what I am suffering.... I want  them to-day.\"    I had pity on her: \"You shall have them by and by, I swear to you.\"  \"Oh! thank you! thank you! How kind you are!\"    I continued: \"Do you remember what took place at your house last  night?\" \"Yes.\" \"Do you remember that Doctor Parent sent you to sleep?\"  \"Yes.\" \"Oh! Very well then; he ordered you to come to me this morning  to borrow five thousand francs, and at this moment you are obeying that  suggestion.\"    She considered for a few moments, and then replied:    \"But as it is my husband who wants them....\"    For a whole hour I tried to convince her, but could not succeed, and  when she had gone I went to the doctor. He was just going out, and he  listened to me with a smile, and said: \"Do you believe now?\" \"Yes, I  cannot help it.\" \"Let us go to your cousin's.\"    She was already dozing on a couch, overcome with fatigue. The doctor  felt her pulse, looked at her for some time with one hand raised toward  her eyes which she closed by degrees under the irresistible power of  this magnetic influence, and when she was asleep, he said:    \"Your husband does not require the five thousand francs any longer! You  must, therefore, forget that you asked your cousin to lend them to you,  and, if he speaks to you about it, you will not understand him.\"    Then he woke her up, and I took out a pocketbook and said: \"Here is  what you asked me for this morning, my dear cousin.\" But she was so  surprised that I did not venture to persist; nevertheless, I tried to  recall the circumstance to her, but she denied it vigorously, thought  that I was making fun of her, and in the end very nearly lost her  temper.           *       *       *       *       *    There! I have just come back, and I have not been able to eat any  lunch, for this experiment has altogether upset me.    _July 19th._ Many people to whom I have told the adventure have laughed  at me. I no longer know what to think. The wise man says: Perhaps?    _July 21st._ I dined at Bougival, and then I spent the evening at  a boatmen's ball. Decidedly everything depends on place and  surroundings. It would be the height of folly to believe in the  supernatural on the _ile de la Grenouilliere_[1] ... but on the top  of Mont Saint-Michel? ... and in India? We are terribly under the  influence of our surroundings. I shall return home next week.      [1] Frog-island.    _July 30th._ I came back to my own house yesterday. Everything is going  on well.    _August 2d._ Nothing fresh; it is splendid weather, and I spend my days  in watching the Seine flow past.    _August 4th._ Quarrels among my servants. They declare that the glasses  are broken in the cupboards at night. The footman accuses the cook, who  accuses the needlewoman, who accuses the other two. Who is the culprit?  A clever person, to be able to tell.    _August 6th._ This time I am not mad. I have seen ... I have seen ... I  have seen!... I can doubt no longer ... I have seen it!...    I was walking at two o'clock among my rose trees, in the full sunlight ...  in the walk bordered by autumn roses which are beginning to fall. As I  stopped to look at a _Geant de Bataille_, which had three splendid  blooms, I distinctly saw the stalk of one of the roses bend, close to  me, as if an invisible hand had bent it, and then break, as if that  hand had picked it! Then the flower raised itself, following the curve  which a hand would have described in carrying it toward a mouth, and it  remained suspended in the transparent air, all alone and motionless, a  terrible red spot, three yards from my eyes. In desperation I rushed at  it to take it! I found nothing; it had disappeared. Then I was seized  with furious rage against myself, for it is not allowable for a  reasonable and serious man to have such hallucinations.    But was it a hallucination? I turned round to look for the stalk, and I  found it immediately under the bush, freshly broken, between two other  roses which remained on the branch, and I returned home then, with a  much disturbed mind; for I am certain now, as certain as I am of the  alternation of day and night, that there exists close to me an  invisible being that lives on milk and on water, which can touch  objects, take them and change their places; which is, consequently,  endowed with a material nature, although it is imperceptible to our  senses, and which lives as I do, under my roof....    _August 7th_. I slept tranquilly. He drank the water out of my  decanter, but did not disturb my sleep.    I ask myself whether I am mad. As I was walking just now in the sun by  the riverside, doubts as to my own sanity arose in me; not vague doubts  such as I have had hitherto, but precise and absolute doubts. I have  seen mad people, and I have known some who have been quite"]]]
