Oh, the nights and days of toil, the  hopes and fears which have agitated me, for the last three years:  these will account to you for the paleness of my cheek, and my vacant  look. Well, I have this day completed the test by which the accuracy  of my work is proved, and now I hold I shall be great.\"    He spoke so loud that his voice echoed through the peristyle; it  disturbed one not the least interested in the conversation, Frederick  Asprecht. He lent an attentive ear to all that fell from the speaker's  lips, and then he learned that not only had he been robbed of an  affection which he had striven to win, but that the same man who  had married Marguerite was about to take from him the possibility of  obtaining a prize he sought for. In the vanity of his pretensions  he could not believe it possible that Dumiger really was not at  the moment speaking extravagantly; it was not until he listened  attentively, and heard him give a detailed account of the nature  of his mechanism, that he saw (for he was not wanting in scientific  knowledge) that Dumiger's confidence was far from misplaced.  Frederick, when he had heard sufficient, left the place with a heavy  heart, and with melancholy step retired to his chambers of luxury.    He entered the Grand Master's palace, and through the vast marble  hall, where the banners hung against the walls, and devices and  armorial bearings testified to the antiquity and gallantry of his  race. The lofty roof, supported by vast ashen beams, echoed to each  step as it rang on the pavement. Sculpture and painting decorated  the several galleries; but he passed by all unnoticed, for he had  one object in view which absorbed all others, and rendered him now  indifferent to the luxuries and grandeur by which he was surrounded.  To his surprise when he entered a colonnade full of the choicest  flowers, which united the extreme wings of the vast building, he found  his father walking there with an anxious, timid step, his manner was  nervous and uneasy.    \"Frederick,\" said the old man, one of those dignified, astute, tall,  gray-bearded, and keen-eyed men, whom we find in the picture galleries  of the middle ages, dressed in a suit of stately black, with the  golden chain of his order, and riband of the Fleece, \"I was very  anxious to see you, my son. The influence of our house is deserting  us; you have not attended the council lately--there is a majority  organizing against us. You should be at your post my son. The first  element of success in life is industry--patient, untiring industry; it  is to this we owe the fortunes of our house the very decorations which  I wear, the consideration with which I am treated,\" and the old man  curled the long, tapering moustache, partly in pride, partly in anger.    \"But, my father, you forget that I am wholly occupied in my  studies--that you yourself urged me to contend for the prize which the  city gives--that you considered this would be the readiest means of  extending your family influence.\"    \"Forget!\" exclaimed the old man indignantly. \"Forget!\" and his  spurs clanged upon the pavement. \"I am not quite so old as to forget  thus--neither do I forget that you wasted three months in making love  to that jungfrau Marguerite, and three more months in lamenting her  loss, even after she had spurned you, you son of the chief citizen of  Dantzic. You succeed in nothing, sir; unstable as water, you trifle  away all existence. Now tell me, you solitary student, where have you  been to-night? Of course not wasting every moment in the holiday with  your boon companions, and making love to all the peasants? Speak,  sir.\"    \"It is true, my father; I was at the fair,\" replied Frederick,  submissively.    \"You tell the truth at any rate,\" continued the Count, somewhat  touched by his frankness. \"Well, then, we won't say anything more  about the past and Marguerite; but tell me as frankly what prospect  you have of success in the competition for this famous clock, for  on that will greatly depend the power of sustaining our family  influence.\"    So appealed to, Frederick thought it wise at once to prepare his  father for the truth. He told him that until that evening he had  imagined that he possessed every prospect of obtaining the prize, and  then he repeated all that he had overheard Dumiger asserting. In the  bitterness of his spirit he inveighed against him as a personal enemy,  and as he spoke vehemently and earnestly, his father's eyes glistened  with vengeance and pleasure, for he saw that the dignity of the father  had passed into his son; he had never seen the youth so excited, he  now felt that he was worthy of the old time-honored race.    \"Ah,\" he said, \"Dumiger again; and his scheme and plan seem well  founded. However, neither the man nor his production will find great  favor in the council while I have influence there; he may exaggerate  his merits.\"    \"I think not,\" said Frederick. \"But there is one way to get rid of  his competition,\" said Frederick, laying his hand on the hilt of his  sword.    \"No, no, young man; take your hand from your sword: I will have no  brawling, no bloodshed, like those common burghers, whose sons are  even now rustling through the market-place. But wait a little; night  gives counsel. I think I have a way far more practical and less  hazardous than that which you propose--leave the matter in my hands,  Frederick. I am glad to find you have some spirit, that it has not  all been dissipated on that foolish girl; there is always hope in man  where there is energy. What I feared was that you might become a mere  dreamer, and struggle through an idle, vaporing existence: now I hold  that you are worthy of your name, although the conviction has reached  me in an unpleasant form. But leave this to me, all will be right; you  have only one thing to do, to send Hoffman to me to-morrow morning.\"    \"Hoffman the silversmith, who lives at the corner near the senate  house?\" asked Frederick.    \"Precisely,\" replied the Count, and soon his firm unbroken step was  heard ringing in the distance.    Frederick went out on the balcony to meditate on what possible steps  his father proposed taking to overrule the opposition of Dumiger.  With all his frivolity and dissipation he was greatly ambitious, and  most anxious to sustain a reputation he had long enjoyed of having it  in his power to command success in any pursuit to which he chose to  direct his attention--that Alcibiades and Admirable Crichton character  which is the principal source of failure to many men in life. With the  exception of the hours wasted in the useless pursuit of Marguerite,  he certainly had not in the present instance been wanting in exertion,  and he also had, like many other chief burghers in Dantzic, turned his  attention to mechanical pursuits; it was the first time, he now felt  convinced, that those exertions would be all thrown away. As he looked  down from the lofty gallery in which he was standing on the dense  circle of happy dancers, who were whirling round and round in the  center of the square; as he heard the joyous laugh from the numerous  groups who thronged the coffee-houses; as the plumes of the guards  waved in the moonlight, and the light flashed on the bright uniforms  and brighter checks which reposed upon them, he began to think how  idle was a life of ambition, how far happier he was when as a boy he  joined in the merry supper; when the clear, bright, sparkling wine  represented the free spirits of those who drank it; when maidens, with  gay hearts and light golden hair, sought his love. \"Give me back these  joys,\" he exclaimed in agony; \"give me that youth which graced the  pursuits of love, and which dignified every enjoyment: take from  me that ambition, which only leads to misery in its failure and to  disappointment in its fulfillment.\"      CHAPTER III.    Hoffman, the silversmith, whom the count desired to see, was one  of those men who have existed at all times and in all countries,  who trade on the exertions of those who possess more energy and  perseverance than themselves, and who really do seem essential to  the great mechanism of society. He had from time to time rendered  assistance to Dumiger, who, unfortunately at the present moment  owed him a large sum of money, which it would take a long time to  liquidate. The count also had dealings with the silversmith; for  in the _quartier Juif_ all classes meet and jostle each other. But  Hoffman was a superior man of his order, he knew the secret history  of most of the important burghers, was consulted on many very delicate  subjects, and could have published more scandal than any Sunday  Chronicle of these more modern days. The count was like all other  counts, incessantly in debt; so, when Hoffman was ordered to attend on  the Grand Master, he did not doubt that the mandate originated in the  ordinary necessity, and he prepared himself accordingly to evade or  concede. Some time previously the count had found it necessary to part  with a great portion of his old family plate, and as it was during the  passion of his son for Marguerite, and after Dumiger had carried off  the prize, he had discovered from the loquacious goldsmith all the  particulars relative to Dumiger, and amongst others the account of  his pecuniary obligations, and that Hoffman had a bond from him for a  very large sum in his possession. The object of the count's present  interview with Hoffman was to know on what terms he could purchase the  bond; and when the jeweler arrived, the bargain was soon concluded.  Hoffman thought the bond would never be paid, and so the count  purchased it for three times its apparent value.    On the previous evening Dumiger returned "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1298"],[0,"The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains (#10)"],[1,"all gone to work and done a lot of things so that mother might keep  on living in the old house. Yes, the salary would be a temptation. But,  my dear, isn't Wyoming bad for the complexion? And could I sue them if  mine got damaged? It is still admired. I could bring one male witness AT  LEAST to prove that!\" Then the writer became businesslike again. Even if  she came to feel that she could leave home, she did not at all know that  she could teach school. Nor did she think it right to accept a  position in which one had had no experience. \"I do love children, boys  especially,\" she went on. \"My small nephew and I get on famously. But  imagine if a whole benchful of boys began asking me questions that I  couldn't answer! What should I do? For one could not spank them all,  you know! And mother says that I ought not to teach anybody spelling,  because I leave the U out of HONOR.\"    Altogether it was a letter which I could assure Mr. Taylor \"sized up\"  very well with the letters written in my part of the United States. And  it was signed, \"Your very sincere spinster, Molly Stark Wood.\"    \"I never seen HONOR spelled with a U,\" said Mr. Taylor, over whose not  highly civilized head certain portions of the letter had lightly passed.    I told him that some old-fashioned people still wrote the word so.    \"Either way would satisfy Bear Creek,\" said Mr. Taylor, \"if she's  otherwise up to requirements.\"    The Virginian was now looking over the letter musingly, and with  awakened attention.    \"'Your very sincere spinster,'\" he read aloud slowly.    \"I guess that means she's forty,\" said Taylor.    \"I reckon she is about twenty,\" said the Virginian. And again he fell to  musing over the paper that he held.    \"Her handwriting ain't like any I've saw,\" pursued Mr. Taylor. \"But Bear  Creek would not object to that, provided she knows 'rithmetic and George  Washington, and them kind of things.\"    \"I expect she is not an awful sincere spinster,\" surmised the Virginian,  still looking at the letter, still holding it as if it were some token.    Has any botanist set down what the seed of love is? Has it anywhere been  set down in how many ways this seed may be sown? In what various vessels  of gossamer it can float across wide spaces? Or upon what different  soils it can fall, and live unknown, and bide its time for blooming?    The Virginian handed back to Taylor the sheet of note paper where a girl  had talked as the women he had known did not talk. If his eyes had  ever seen such maidens, there had been no meeting of eyes; and if such  maidens had ever spoken to him, the speech was from an established  distance. But here was a free language, altogether new to him. It  proved, however, not alien to his understanding, as it was alien to Mr.  Taylor's.    We drove onward, a mile perhaps, and then two. He had lately been full  of words, but now he barely answered me, so that a silence fell upon  both of us. It must have been all of ten miles that we had driven when  he spoke of his own accord.    \"Your real spinster don't speak of her lot that easy,\" he remarked. And  presently he quoted a phrase about the complexion, \"'Could I sue them  if mine got damaged?'\" and he smiled over this to himself, shaking  his head. \"What would she be doing on Bear Creek?\" he next said. And  finally: \"I reckon that witness will detain her in Vermont. And her  mother'll keep livin' at the old house.\"    Thus did the cow-puncher deliver himself, not knowing at all that the  seed had floated across wide spaces, and was biding its time in his  heart.    On the morrow we reached Sunk Creek. Judge Henry's welcome and his  wife's would have obliterated any hardships that I had endured, and I  had endured none at all.    For a while I saw little of the Virginian. He lapsed into his native way  of addressing me occasionally as \"seh\"--a habit entirely repudiated by  this land of equality. I was sorry. Our common peril during the runaway  of Buck and Muggins had brought us to a familiarity that I hoped was  destined to last. But I think that it would not have gone farther,  save for a certain personage--I must call her a personage. And as I am  indebted to her for gaining me a friend whose prejudice against me might  never have been otherwise overcome, I shall tell you her little story,  and how her misadventures and her fate came to bring the Virginian and  me to an appreciation of one another. Without her, it is likely I should  also not have heard so much of the story of the schoolmarm, and how that  lady at last came to Bear Creek.          VI. EM'LY      My personage was a hen, and she lived at the Sunk Creek Ranch.    Judge Henry's ranch was notable for several luxuries. He had milk, for  example. In those days his brother ranchmen had thousands of cattle very  often, but not a drop of milk, save the condensed variety. Therefore  they had no butter. The Judge had plenty. Next rarest to butter and milk  in the cattle country were eggs. But my host had chickens. Whether this  was because he had followed cock-fighting in his early days, or whether  it was due to Mrs. Henry, I cannot say. I only know that when I took a  meal elsewhere, I was likely to find nothing but the eternal \"sowbelly,\"  beans, and coffee; while at Sunk Creek the omelet and the custard were  frequent. The passing traveller was glad to tie his horse to the fence  here, and sit down to the Judge's table. For its fame was as wide as  Wyoming. It was an oasis in the Territory's desolate bill-of-fare.    The long fences of Judge Henry's home ranch began upon Sunk Creek soon  after that stream emerged from its canyon through the Bow Leg. It was  a place always well cared for by the owner, even in the days of his  bachelorhood. The placid regiments of cattle lay in the cool of the  cottonwoods by the water, or slowly moved among the sage-brush, feeding  upon the grass that in those forever departed years was plentiful and  tall. The steers came fat off his unenclosed range and fattened still  more in his large pasture; while his small pasture, a field some eight  miles square, was for several seasons given to the Judge's horses, and  over this ample space there played and prospered the good colts which  he raised from Paladin, his imported stallion. After he married, I have  been assured that his wife's influence became visible in and about the  house at once. Shade trees were planted, flowers attempted, and to the  chickens was added the much more troublesome turkey. I, the visitor, was  pressed into service when I arrived, green from the East. I took hold of  the farmyard and began building a better chicken house, while the Judge  was off creating meadow land in his gray and yellow wilderness. When  any cow-boy was unoccupied, he would lounge over to my neighborhood, and  silently regard my carpentering.    Those cow-punchers bore names of various denominations. There was Honey  Wiggin; there was Nebrasky, and Dollar Bill, and Chalkeye. And they came  from farms and cities, from Maine and from California. But the romance  of American adventure had drawn them all alike to this great playground  of young men, and in their courage, their generosity, and their  amusement at me they bore a close resemblance to each other. Each one  would silently observe my achievements with the hammer and the chisel.  Then he would retire to the bunk-house, and presently I would overhear  laughter. But this was only in the morning. In the afternoon on many  days of the summer which I spent at the Sunk Creek Ranch I would go  shooting, or ride up toward the entrance of the canyon and watch the men  working on the irrigation ditches. Pleasant systems of water running  in channels were being led through the soil, and there was a sound of  rippling here and there among the yellow grain; the green thick alfalfa  grass waved almost, it seemed, of its own accord, for the wind never  blew; and when at evening the sun lay against the plain, the rift of the  canyon was filled with a violet light, and the Bow Leg Mountains became  transfigured with hues of floating and unimaginable color. The sun shone  in a sky where never a cloud came, and noon was not too warm nor the  dark too cool. And so for two months I went through these pleasant  uneventful days, improving the chickens, an object of mirth, living in  the open air, and basking in the perfection of content.    I was justly styled a tenderfoot. Mrs. Henry had in the beginning  endeavored to shield me from this humiliation; but when she found that I  was inveterate in laying my inexperience of Western matters bare to all  the world, begging to be enlightened upon rattlesnakes, prairie-dogs,  owls, blue and willow grouse, sage-hens, how to rope a horse or tighten  the front cinch of my saddle, and that my spirit soared into enthusiasm  at the mere sight of so ordinary an animal as a white-tailed deer, she  let me rush about with my firearms and made no further effort to stave  off the ridicule that my blunders perpetually earned from the ranch  hands, her own humorous husband, and any chance visitor who stopped for  a meal or stayed the night.    I was not called by my name after the first feeble etiquette due to a  stranger in his first few hours had died away. I was known simply as  \"the tenderfoot.\" I was introduced to the neighborhood (a circle  of eighty miles) as \"the tenderfoot.\" It was thus that Balaam, the  maltreater of horses, learned to address me when he came a two  days' journey to pay a visit. And it was this name and my notorious  helplessness that bid fair to end what relations I had with the  Virginian. For when Judge Henry ascertained that nothing could prevent  me from losing myself, that it was not uncommon for me to saunter out  after breakfast with a gun and in thirty minutes cease to know north  from south, he arranged for my protection. He detailed an escort for me;  and the escort was once more the trustworthy man! The poor"]]]
