It was  great fun for Black Pussy to slip a paw under Grandfather Frog and toss  him up in the air. It was still more fun to pretend to go away, but to  hide instead, and the instant Grandfather Frog started off, to pounce  upon him and cuff him and roll him about. But there wasn't any fun in it  for Grandfather Frog. In the first place, he didn't know whether or not  Black Pussy liked Frogs to eat, and he was terribly frightened. In the  second place, Black Pussy didn't always cover up her claws, and they  pricked right through Grandfather Frog's white and yellow waistcoat and  hurt, for he is very tender there.    At last Black Pussy grew tired of playing, so catching up Grandfather  Frog in her mouth, she started along the little path from the spring to  the Long Lane. Grandfather Frog didn't even kick, which was just as  well, because if he had, Black Pussy would have held him tighter, and  that would have been very uncomfortable indeed.    \"It's all over, and this is the end,\" moaned Grandfather Frog. \"I'm  going to be eaten now. Oh, why, why did I ever leave the Smiling Pool?\"    Just as Black Pussy slipped into the Long Lane, Grandfather Frog heard a  familiar sound. It was a whistle, a merry whistle. It was the whistle of  Farmer Brown's boy. It was coming nearer and nearer. A little bit of  hope began to stir in the heart of Grandfather Frog.    He didn't know just why, but it did. Always he had been in the greatest  fear of Farmer Brown's boy, but now--well, if Farmer Brown's boy should  take him, he might get away from him as he did before, but he was very  sure that he never, never could get away from Black Pussy.    The whistle drew nearer. Black Pussy stopped. Then she began to make a  queer whirring sound deep down in her throat.    \"Hello, Black Pussy! Have you been hunting? Come here and show me what  you've got,\" cried a voice.    Black Pussy arched up her back and began to rub against the legs of  Farmer Brown's boy, and all the time the whir, ring sound in her throat  grew louder and louder. Farmer Brown's boy stooped down to see what she  had in her mouth.    \"Why,\" he exclaimed, \"I do believe this is the very same old frog that  got away from me! You don't want him, Puss. I'll just put him in my  pocket and take him up to the house by and by.\"    With that he took Grandfather Frog from Black Pussy and dropped him in  his pocket. He patted Black Pussy, called her a smart cat, and then  started on his way, whistling merrily. It was dark and rather close in  that pocket, but Grandfather Frog didn't mind this. It was a lot better  than feeling sharp teeth and claws all the time. He wondered how soon  they would reach the house and what would happen to him then. After what  seemed like a long, long time, he felt himself swung through the air,  and then he landed on the ground with a thump that made him grunt.  Farmer Brown's boy had taken off his coat and thrown it down.    The whistling stopped. Everything was quiet. Grandfather Frog waited  and listened, but not a sound could he hear. Then he saw a little ray of  light creeping into his prison. He squirmed and pushed, and all of a  sudden he was out of the pocket. The bright light made him blink. As  soon as he could see, he looked to see where he was. Then he rubbed his  eyes with both hands and looked again. He wasn't at Farmer Brown's house  at all. Where do you think he was? Why, right on the bank of the Smiling  Pool, and a little way off was Farmer Brown's boy fishing!    \"Chugarum!\" cried Grandfather Frog, and it was the loudest, gladdest  chugarum that the Smiling Pool ever had heard. \"Chugarum!\" he cried  again, and with a great leap he dived with a splash into the dear old  Smiling Pool, which smiled more than ever.    And never again has Grandfather Frog tried to see the Great World. He  is quite content to leave it to those who like to dwell there. And since  his own wonderful adventures, he has been ready to believe anything he  is told about what happens there. Nothing can surprise him, not even the  astonishing things that happened to Chatterer the Red Squirrel, about  which it takes a whole book to tell."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14378"],[0,"Five Years of Theosophy (#10)"],[1,"the Chela makes no difference whatever as to the  result:  his good thought, words and deeds will bear their fruits, his  evil ones, theirs.  To boast of Lay Chelaship or make a parade of it, is  the surest way to reduce the relationship with the Guru to a mere empty  name, for it would be prima facie evidence of vanity and unfitness for  farther progress.  And for years we have been teaching everywhere the  maxim \"First deserve, then desire\" intimacy with the Mahatmas.    Now there is a terrible law operative in Nature, one which cannot be  altered, and whose operation clears up the apparent mystery of the  selection of certain \"Chelas\" who have turned out sorry specimens of  morality, these few years past.  Does the reader recall the old proverb,  \"Let sleeping dogs lie?\"  There is a world of occult meaning in it.  No  man or woman knows his or her moral strength until it is tried.  Thousands go through life very respectably, because they were never put  to the test.  This is a truism doubtless, but it is most pertinent to  the present case. One who undertakes to try for Chelaship by that very  act rouses and lashes to desperation every sleeping passion of his  animal nature.  For this is the commencement of a struggle for mastery  in which quarter is neither to be given nor taken.  It is, once for all,  \"To be, or Not to be;\"  to conquer, means Adept-ship: to fail, an  ignoble Martyrdom;  for to fall victim to lust, pride, avarice, vanity,  selfishness, cowardice, or any other of the lower propensities, is  indeed ignoble, if measured by the standard of true manhood.  The Chela  is not only called to face all the latent evil propensities of his  nature, but, in addition, the momentum of maleficent forces accumulated  by the community and nation to which he belongs.  For he is an integral  part of those aggregates, and what affects either the individual man or  the group (town or nation), reacts the one upon the other.  And in this  instance his struggle for goodness jars upon the whole body of badness  in his environment, and draws its fury upon him. If he is content to go  along with his neighbours and be almost as they are--perhaps a little  better or somewhat worse than the average--no one may give him a  thought.  But let it be known that he has been able to detect the hollow  mockery of social life, its hypocrisy, selfishness, sensuality, cupidity  and other bad features, and has determined to lift himself up to a  higher level, at once he is hated, and every bad, bigotted, or malicious  nature sends at him a current of opposing will-power.  If he is innately  strong he shakes it off, as the powerful swimmer dashes through the  current that would bear a weaker one away.  But in this moral battle, if  the Chela has one single hidden blemish--do what he may, it shall and  will be brought to light.  The varnish of conventionalities which  \"civilization\" overlays us all with must come off to the last coat, and  the inner self, naked and without the slightest veil to conceal its  reality, is exposed. The habits of society which hold men to a certain  degree under moral restraint, and compel them to pay tribute to virtue  by seeming to be good whether they are so or not--these habits are apt  to be all forgotten, these restraints to be all broken through under the  strain of Chelaship.  He is now in an atmosphere of illusions--Maya.  Vice puts on its most alluring face, and the tempting passions attract  the inexperienced aspirant to the depths of psychic debasement.  This is  not a case like that depicted by a great artist, where Satan is seen  playing a game of chess with a man upon the stake of his soul, while the  latter's good angel stands beside him to counsel and assist.  For the  strife is in this instance between the Chela's will and his carnal  nature, and Karma forbids that any angel or Guru should interfere until  the result is known.  With the vividness of poetic fancy Bulwer Lytton  has idealized it for us in his \"Zanoni,\" a work which will ever be  prized by the occultist while in his \"Strange Story\" he has with equal  power shown the black side of occult research and its deadly perils.  Chelaship was defined, the other day, by a Mahatma as a \"psychic  resolvent, which eats away all dross and leaves only the pure gold  behind.\" If the candidate has the latent lust for money, or political  chicanery, or materialistic scepticism, or vain display, or false  speaking, or cruelty, or sensual gratification of any kind the germ is  almost sure to sprout;  and so, on the other hand, as regards the noble  qualities of human nature.  The real man comes out.  Is it not the  height of folly, then, for any one to leave the smooth path of  commonplace life to scale the crags of Chelaship without some reasonable  feeling of certainty that he has the right stuff in him?  Well says the  Bible:  \"Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall\"--a text that  would-be Chelas should consider well before they rush headlong into the  fray!  It would have been well for some of our Lay Chelas if they had  thought twice before defying the tests.  We call to mind several sad  failures within a twelve-month.  One went wrong in the head, recanted  noble sentiments uttered but a few weeks previously, and became a member  of a religion he had just scornfully and unanswerably proven false.  A  second became a defaulter and absconded with his employer's money--the  latter also a Theosophist.  A third gave himself up to gross debauchery,  and confessed it, with ineffectual sobs and tears, to his chosen Guru.  A fourth got entangled with a person of the other sex and fell out with  his dearest and truest friends.  A fifth showed signs of mental  aberration and was brought into Court upon charges of discreditable  conduct.  A sixth shot himself to escape the consequences of  criminality, on the verge of detection!  And so we might go on and on.  All these were apparently sincere searchers after truth, and passed in  the world for respectable persons.  Externally, they were fairly  eligible as candidates for Chelaship, as appearances go;  but \"within  all was rottenness and dead men's bones.\"  The world's varnish was so  thick as to hide the absence of the true gold underneath;  and the  \"resolvent\" doing its work, the candidate proved in each instance but a  gilded figure of moral dross, from circumference to core.    In what precedes we have, of course, dealt but with the failures among  Lay Chelas;  there have been partial successes too, and these are  passing gradually through the first stages of their probation.  Some are  making themselves useful to the Society and to the world in general by  good example and precept.  If they persist, well for them, well for us  all:  the odds are fearfully against them, but still \"there is no  impossibility to him who Wills.\"  The difficulties in Chelaship will  never be less until human nature changes and a new order is evolved.  St. Paul (Rom. vii. 18,19) might have had a Chela in mind when he said  \"to will is present with me;  but how to perform that which is good I  find not.  For the good I would I do not;  but the evil which I would  not, that I do.\"  And in the wise Kiratarjuniyam of Bharavi it is  written:--         The enemies which rise within the body,       Hard to be overcome--the evil passions--       Should manfully be fought; who conquers these       Is equal to the conqueror of worlds. (XI. 32.)    (--H.P. Blavatsky)          Ancient Opinions Upon Psychic Bodies      It must be confessed that modern Spiritualism falls very short of the  ideas formerly suggested by the sublime designation which it has  assumed.  Chiefly intent upon recognizing and putting forward the  phenomenal proofs of a future existence, it concerns itself little with  speculations on the distinction between matter and spirit, and rather  prides itself on having demolished Materialism without the aid of  metaphysics.  Perhaps a Platonist might say that the recognition of a  future existence is consistent with a very practical and even dogmatic  materialism, but it is rather to be feared that such a materialism as  this would not greatly disturb the spiritual or intellectual repose of  our modern phenomenalists.*  Given the consciousness with its  sensibilities safely housed in the psychic body which demonstrably  survives the physical carcase, and we are like men saved from shipwreck,  who are for the moment thankful and content, not giving thought whether  they are landed on a hospitable shore, or on a barren rock, or on an  island of cannibals.  It is not of course intended that this \"hand to  mouth\" immortality is sufficient for the many thoughtful minds whose  activity gives life and progress to the movement, but that it affords  the relief which most people feel when in an age of doubt they make the  discovery that they are undoubtedly to live again.  To the question \"how  are the dead raised up, and with what body do they come?\" modern  Spiritualism, with its empirical methods, is not adequate to reply.  Yet  long before Paul suggested it, it had the attention of the most  celebrated schools of philosophy, whose speculations on the subject,  however little they may seem to be verified, ought not to be without  interest to us, who, after all, are still in the infancy of a  spiritualist revival.    ---------  * \"I am afraid,\" says Thomas Taylor in his Introduction to the Phaedo,  \"there are scarcely any at the present day who know that it is one thing  for the soul to be separated from the body, and another for the body to  be separated from the soul, and that the former is by no means a  necessary consequence of the latter.\"  -----------    It would not be necessary to premise, but for the frequency with which  the phrase occurs, that the \"spiritual body\" is a contradiction in  terms.  The office of body is to relate spirit to an objective world.  By Platonic writers it is usually termed okhema-"]]]
