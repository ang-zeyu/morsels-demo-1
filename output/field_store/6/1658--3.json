That is the reason one-reel masterpieces  seldom appear now. The producer in a mood to make a special effort wants  to feel that he has the entire evening, and that nothing before or after  is going to be a bore or destroy the impression. So at present the  painstaking films are apt to be five or six reels of twenty minutes each.  These have the advantage that if they please at all, one can see them  again at once without sitting through irrelevant slapstick work put there  to fill out the time. But now, having the whole evening to work in, the  producer takes too much time for his good ideas. I shall reiterate  throughout this work the necessity for restraint. A one hour programme is  long enough for any one. If the observer is pleased, he will sit it  through again and take another hour. There is not a good film in the  world but is the better for being seen in immediate succession to itself.  Six-reel programmes are a weariness to the flesh. The best of the old  one-reel Biographs of Griffith contained more in twenty minutes than  these ambitious incontinent six-reel displays give us in two hours. It  would pay a manager to hang out a sign: \"This show is only twenty minutes  long, but it is Griffith's great film 'The Battle.'\"    But I am digressing. To continue the contrast between private passion in  the theatre and crowd-passion in the photoplay, let us turn to Shaw  again. Consider his illustration of Iago, Othello, and Lear. These parts,  as he implies, would fall flat in motion pictures. The minor situations  of dramatic intensity might in many cases be built up. The crisis would  inevitably fail. Iago and Othello and Lear, whatever their offices in  their governments, are essentially private persons, individuals _in  extremis_. If you go to a motion picture and feel yourself suddenly  gripped by the highest dramatic tension, as on the old stage, and reflect  afterward that it was a fight between only two or three men in a room  otherwise empty, stop to analyze what they stood for. They were probably  representatives of groups or races that had been pursuing each other  earlier in the film. Otherwise the conflict, however violent, appealed  mainly to the sense of speed.    So, in The Birth of a Nation, which could better be called The Overthrow  of Negro Rule, the Ku Klux Klan dashes down the road as powerfully as  Niagara pours over the cliff. Finally the white girl Elsie Stoneman  (impersonated by Lillian Gish) is rescued by the Ku Klux Klan from the  mulatto politician, Silas Lynch (impersonated by George Seigmann). The  lady is brought forward as a typical helpless white maiden. The white  leader, Col. Ben Cameron (impersonated by Henry B. Walthall), enters not  as an individual, but as representing the whole Anglo-Saxon Niagara. He  has the mask of the Ku Klux Klan on his face till the crisis has passed.  The wrath of the Southerner against the blacks and their Northern  organizers has been piled up through many previous scenes. As a result  this rescue is a real climax, something the photoplays that trace  strictly personal hatreds cannot achieve.    The Birth of a Nation is a Crowd Picture in a triple sense. On the films,  as in the audience, it turns the crowd into a mob that is either for or  against the Reverend Thomas Dixon's poisonous hatred of the negro.    Griffith is a chameleon in interpreting his authors. Wherever the  scenario shows traces of The Clansman, the original book, by Thomas  Dixon, it is bad. Wherever it is unadulterated Griffith, which is half  the time, it is good. The Reverend Thomas Dixon is a rather stagy Simon  Legree: in his avowed views a deal like the gentleman with the spiritual  hydrophobia in the latter end of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Unconsciously Mr.  Dixon has done his best to prove that Legree was not a fictitious  character.           *       *       *       *       *    Joel Chandler Harris, Harry Stillwell Edwards, George W. Cable, Thomas  Nelson Page, James Lane Allen, and Mark Twain are Southern men in Mr.  Griffith's class. I recommend their works to him as a better basis for  future Southern scenarios.    The Birth of a Nation has been very properly denounced for its Simon  Legree qualities by Francis Hackett, Jane Addams, and others. But it is  still true that it is a wonder in its Griffith sections. In its handling  of masses of men it further illustrates the principles that made notable  the old one-reel Battle film described in the beginning of this chapter.  The Battle in the end is greater, because of its self-possession and  concentration: all packed into twenty minutes.    When, in The Birth of a Nation, Lincoln (impersonated by Joseph Henabery)  goes down before the assassin, it is a master-scene. He falls as the  representative of the government and a thousand high and noble crowd  aspirations. The mimic audience in the restored Ford's Theatre rises in  panic. This crowd is interpreted in especial for us by the two young  people in the seats nearest, and the freezing horror of the treason  sweeps from the Ford's Theatre audience to the real audience beyond them.  The real crowd touched with terror beholds its natural face in the glass.    Later come the pictures of the rioting negroes in the streets of the  Southern town, mobs splendidly handled, tossing wildly and rhythmically  like the sea. Then is delineated the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, of which  we have already spoken. For comment on the musical accompaniment to The  Birth of a Nation, read the fourteenth chapter entitled \"The Orchestra,  Conversation and the Censorship.\"    In the future development of motion pictures mob-movements of anger and  joy will go through fanatical and provincial whirlwinds into great  national movements of anger and joy.    A book by Gerald Stanley Lee that has a score of future scenarios in it,  a book that might well be dipped into by the reader before he goes to  such a play as The Italian or The Battle, is the work which bears the  title of this chapter: \"Crowds.\"    Mr. Lee is far from infallible in his remedies for factory and industrial  relations. But in sensitiveness to the flowing street of humanity he is  indeed a man. Listen to the names of some of the divisions of his book:  \"Crowds and Machines; Letting the Crowds be Good; Letting the Crowds be  Beautiful; Crowds and Heroes; Where are we Going? The Crowd Scare; The  Strike, an Invention for making Crowds Think; The Crowd's Imagination  about People; Speaking as One of the Crowd; Touching the Imagination of  Crowds.\" Films in the spirit of these titles would help to make  world-voters of us all.    The World State is indeed far away. But as we peer into the Mirror Screen  some of us dare to look forward to the time when the pouring streets of  men will become sacred in each other's eyes, in pictures and in fact.    A further discussion of this theme on other planes will be found in the  eleventh chapter, entitled \"Architecture-in-Motion,\" and the fifteenth  chapter, entitled \"The Substitute for the Saloon.\"          CHAPTER VI    PATRIOTIC SPLENDOR      The Patriotic Picture need not necessarily be in terms of splendor. It  generally is. Beginning the chronicle is one that waves no banners.    The Typhoon, a film produced by Thomas H. Ince, is a story of the  Japanese love of Nippon in which a very little of the landscape of the  nation is shown, and that in the beginning. The hero (acted by Sessue  Hayakawa), living in the heart of Paris, represents the far-off Empire.  He is making a secret military report. He is a responsible member of a  colony of Japanese gentlemen. The bevy of them appear before or after his  every important action. He still represents this crowd when alone.    The unfortunate Parisian heroine, unable to fathom the mystery of the  fanatical hearts of the colony, ventures to think that her love for the  Japanese hero and his equally great devotion to her is the important  human relation on the horizon. She flouts his obscure work, pits her  charms against it. In the end there is a quarrel. The irresistible meets  the immovable, and in madness or half by accident, he kills the girl.    The youth is protected by the colony, for he alone can make the report.  He is the machine-like representative of the Japanese patriotic formula,  till the document is complete. A new arrival in the colony, who obviously  cannot write the book, confesses the murder and is executed. The other  high fanatic dies soon after, of a broken heart, with the completed  manuscript volume in his hand. The one impression of the play is that  Japanese patriotism is a peculiar and fearful thing. The particular  quality of the private romance is but vaguely given, for such things in  their rise and culmination can only be traced by the novelist, or by the  gentle alternations of silence and speech on the speaking stage, aided by  the hot blood of players actually before us.    Here, as in most photoplays, the attempted lover-conversations in  pantomime are but indifferent things. The details of the hero's last  quarrel with the heroine and the precise thoughts that went with it are  muffled by the inability to speak. The power of the play is in the  adequate style the man represents the colony. Sessue Hayakawa should give  us Japanese tales more adapted to the films. We should have stories of  Iyeyasu and Hideyoshi, written from the ground up for the photoplay  theatre. We should have the story of the Forty-seven Ronin, not a  Japanese stage version, but a work from the source-material. We should  have legends of the various clans, picturizations of the code of the  Samurai.    The Typhoon is largely indoors. But the Patriotic Motion Picture is  generally a landscape. This is for deeper reasons than that it requires  large fields in which to manoeuvre armies. Flags are shown for other  causes than that they are the nominal signs of a love of the native"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13030"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 09 (#10)"],[1,"doing that--for I hate him like poison, ever since that time in  the tavern when he--you know what I refer to, and you would feel  insulted too, if you had any self respect about you!

Father, you are terrible!    ANTONY (_grasps her hand very gently_).    Dear daughter, Carl is only a bungler. He has killed his mother, and  what does it mean? His father remains alive! So, come to his aid--you  cannot ask him to do everything alone. You must make an end of me! The  old trunk still looks rugged, doesn't it? But it has begun to totter  already--it will not cost you much trouble to fell it! You need not  reach for the ax. You have a pretty face--I have never praised you, but  today I will tell you, so that you may acquire courage and confidence.  Your eyes, nose, mouth are surely admired!

Have you lost your appetite again?    CLARA.    Father, I have had enough.    ANTONY.    But you have taken nothing!    CLARA.    I ate out in the kitchen.    ANTONY.    A bad appetite means a guilty conscience. Oh, well, we shall see--or was  there poison in the soup, as I dreamt yesterday? Perhaps some wild  hemlock got in with the other vegetables by mistake, when they were  gathered?--In that case you did well!    CLARA. Great Heavens!    ANTONY.    Forgive me! I--Away with your pale sad look, which you stole from our  Savior's Mother! One should look ruddy when one is young! There is but  one who might show such a face, and he does not do it! Hey! A box on the  ear for every man who says \"ouch!\" when he cuts his finger! No man has  any right to do that now, for here stands a man who--ugh!--self-praise  stinks!--But what did I do when our neighbor started to nail down the  cover of your mother's coffin?    CLARA.    You wrenched the hammer away from him and did it yourself, and said:  \"This is my masterpiece!\" The preceptor, who was just then leading the  choir boys in the dirge over by the door, thought you had gone crazy.    ANTONY.    Crazy?    [_Laughs._]    Crazy. Yes, yes, it is a wise head that cuts itself off at the right  time. Mine must be too firmly fastened on, or else--We squat down in the  world and imagine ourselves sitting behind the stove in a good inn.  Suddenly a light is placed on the table and, behold! we find ourselves  sitting in a den of thieves! There is a bing! bang! on all sides, but no  harm it done--fortunately we have hearts of stone!    CLARA.    Yes, father, so it is.    ANTONY.    What do you know about it? Do you think you have a right to curse with  me because your clerk has deserted you? There will be another to take  you walking Suliday afternoons, another to tell you that your cheeks are  rosy and your eyes blue, and still another to take you as his wife, if  you deserve it! Wait until you have borne the burdens of life in  chastity and honor for thirty years, and have endured sorrow and death  and every human adversity with uncomplaining patience; then let your  son, who ought to stuff a soft pillow for your old head, come and so  overwhelm you with disgrace that you would like to cry out to the earth:  Swallow me, if it does not sicken thee, for I am muddier than thou! Then  you may utter all the curses that I suppress in my bosom, then you may  tear your hair and beat your breasts!--You have that advantage over me,  for you are not a man!    CLARA.    Oh, Carl!    ANTONY.    I wonder what I shall do when I see him again before me, when he comes  home some evening before candlelight with his hair shaved off--for  hair-dressing is not allowed in the penitentiary--and stammers out a  good evening, keeping his hand on the door-knob? I shall do something,  that is certain--but what?    [_Gnashes his teeth._]    And if they keep him locked up for ten years, he shall find me, for I  shall live until then--that much I know! Mark you, Death, what I say:  From now on I am a stone in front of your scythe! It shall fly to pieces  before it shall budge me!    CLARA (_grasps his hand_).    Father, you ought to lie down and rest for half an hour!    ANTONY.    To dream that you are about to be confined? And then to fly into a  passion and seize you, and afterward bethink myself too late and say:  \"Dear daughter, I did not know what I was doing!\" Thank you! My sleep  has dismissed the magician and employed a prophet, who points out  loathsome things to me with his bloody finger! I don't know how it  is--everything seems possible to me now. Ugh! I shudder at the future as  at a glass of water seen under the microscope--is that the right word,  Mr. Precentor? You have spelled it out for me often enough! I looked  through one once in Nuremburg at the fair, and couldn't drink any more  water all day long. Last night I saw my dear Carl with a pistol in his  hand; when I looked closer into his eyes he pulled the trigger. I heard  a cry, but could see nothing on account of the smoke. When it cleared  away, I saw no shattered skull--but my fine son had in the mean time  come to be a rich man; he was standing and counting gold pieces from one  hand into the other. His face--the Devil take me!--a man could have no  calmer one after working all day and closing the door of his workshop  behind him at night! Well, that's a thing one might prevent! One might  take the law into one's own hands, and afterward present one's self  before the supreme Judge!    CLARA.    Calm yourself!    ANTONY.    Get well again you mean to say! Why am I sick? Yes, doctor, hand me the  drink that shall make me well! Your brother is the worst of sons; be you  the best of daughters! Like a worthless bankrupt I stand before the eyes  of the world! I owed it a fine man to take the place of this weak  invalid, and I cheated it with a scoundrel! Be you such a woman as your  mother was, and then people will say: It does not come from his parents  that the boy went wrong, for the daughter treads the path of  righteousness and excels all others.    [_With terrible coldness._]    And I will do my part in the matter; I will make it easier for you than  it is for others. The moment I see anybody point his fingers at you, I  shall [with a motion toward his neck_] shave myself, and then, I swear  to you, I shall shave off head and all. Then you may say I did it from  fright, because a horse ran away in the street, or because the cat  overturned a chair on the floor, or because a mouse ran up my legs.  Anybody that knows me, to be sure, will shake his head at that, for I  am not easily frightened--but what difference does that make? I could  not endure to live in a world where the people would refrain from  spitting at me simply out of pity.    CLARA.    Merciful God! What shall I do?    ANTONY.    Nothing, nothing, dear child! I am too severe with you--I realize it. Do  nothing--be just as you are, and it is all right. Oh, I have suffered  such rank injustice that I myself must do injustice in order not to  succumb to it when it grips me so hard! Listen! Not long ago I was going  across the street when I met that pock-marked thief, Fritz, whom I had  thrown into jail a few years ago because for the third time he had shown  himself light-fingered in my house. Formerly the scoundrel never even  dared to look at me; now he walked boldly up and offered me his hand. I  felt like boxing his ears, but I bethought myself and did not even spit.  We have been cousins for a week now, and it is proper for relatives to  greet each other! The minister, the sympathetic man who visited me  yesterday, said that no man had anybody to look out for but himself, and  that it was unchristian pride for me to hold myself responsible for the  sins of my son; otherwise Adam would have to take it just as much to  heart as I. Sir, I verily believe that it no longer troubles our first  ancestor in Paradise when one of his descendants begins to rob and  murder.--But did not he himself tear his hair over Cain? No, no, it is  too much! Sometimes I find myself looking around at my shadow to see if  it too has not grown blacker. For I can endure anything and everything,  and have given proof of it, but not disgrace! Put on my back what  burdens you choose, but do not sever the nerve that holds me together!    CLARA.    Father, Carl has not yet confessed anything, and they have found nothing  on him.    ANTONY.    What difference does that make to me? I have gone around the town and  inquired at the different"]]]
