They seemed to think that I had thrown the glamour over him,  and that he had become mine. Here commenced an opposition which we had  not previously experienced. All the friends of the divorced wives became  the opponents of our religion. The attendance at school and church  diminished to very few besides the chief's own family. They all treated  us still with respectful kindness, but to Sechele himself they said  things which, as he often remarked, had they ventured on in former  times, would have cost them their lives. It was trying, after all we had  done, to see our labors so little appreciated; but we had sown the good  seed, and have no doubt but it will yet spring up, though we may not  live to see the fruits.    Leaving this sketch of the chief, I proceed to give an equally rapid one  of our dealing with his people, the Bakena, or Bakwains. A small piece  of land, sufficient for a garden, was purchased when we first went to  live with them, though that was scarcely necessary in a country where  the idea of buying land was quite new. It was expected that a request  for a suitable spot would have been made, and that we should have  proceeded to occupy it as any other member of the tribe would. But we  explained to them that we wished to avoid any cause of future dispute  when land had become more valuable; or when a foolish chief began to  reign, and we had erected large or expensive buildings, he might wish  to claim the whole. These reasons were considered satisfactory. About 5  Pounds worth of goods were given for a piece of land, and an arrangement  was come to that a similar piece should be allotted to any other  missionary, at any other place to which the tribe might remove. The  particulars of the sale sounded strangely in the ears of the tribe, but  were nevertheless readily agreed to.    In our relations with this people we were simply strangers exercising  no authority or control whatever. Our influence depended entirely on  persuasion; and having taught them by kind conversation as well as by  public instruction, I expected them to do what their own sense of right  and wrong dictated. We never wished them to do right merely because it  would be pleasing to us, nor thought ourselves to blame when they did  wrong, although we were quite aware of the absurd idea to that effect.  We saw that our teaching did good to the general mind of the people by  bringing new and better motives into play. Five instances are positively  known to me in which, by our influence on public opinion, war was  prevented; and where, in individual cases, we failed, the people did  no worse than they did before we came into the country. In general they  were slow, like all the African people hereafter to be described, in  coming to a decision on religious subjects; but in questions affecting  their worldly affairs they were keenly alive to their own interests.  They might be called stupid in matters which had not come within the  sphere of their observation, but in other things they showed more  intelligence than is to be met with in our own uneducated peasantry.  They are remarkably accurate in their knowledge of cattle, sheep, and  goats, knowing exactly the kind of pasturage suited to each; and  they select with great judgment the varieties of soil best suited to  different kinds of grain. They are also familiar with the habits of wild  animals, and in general are well up in the maxims which embody their  ideas of political wisdom.    The place where we first settled with the Bakwains is called Chonuane,  and it happened to be visited, during the first year of our residence  there, by one of those droughts which occur from time to time in even  the most favored districts of Africa.    The belief in the gift or power of RAIN-MAKING is one of the most  deeply-rooted articles of faith in this country. The chief Sechele was  himself a noted rain-doctor, and believed in it implicitly. He has often  assured me that he found it more difficult to give up his faith in that  than in any thing else which Christianity required him to abjure. I  pointed out to him that the only feasible way of watering the gardens  was to select some good, never-failing river, make a canal, and irrigate  the adjacent lands. This suggestion was immediately adopted, and soon  the whole tribe was on the move to the Kolobeng, a stream about forty  miles distant. The experiment succeeded admirably during the first  year. The Bakwains made the canal and dam in exchange for my labor in  assisting to build a square house for their chief. They also built their  own school under my superintendence. Our house at the River Kolobeng,  which gave a name to the settlement, was the third which I had reared  with my own hands. A native smith taught me to weld iron; and having  improved by scraps of information in that line from Mr. Moffat, and also  in carpentering and gardening, I was becoming handy at almost any trade,  besides doctoring and preaching; and as my wife could make candles,  soap, and clothes, we came nearly up to what may be considered as  indispensable in the accomplishments of a missionary family in Central  Africa, namely, the husband to be a jack-of-all-trades without doors,  and the wife a maid-of-all-work within. But in our second year again no  rain fell. In the third the same extraordinary drought followed. Indeed,  not ten inches of water fell during these two years, and the Kolobeng  ran dry; so many fish were killed that the hyaenas from the whole  country round collected to the feast, and were unable to finish the  putrid masses. A large old alligator, which had never been known to  commit any depredations, was found left high and dry in the mud among  the victims. The fourth year was equally unpropitious, the fall of rain  being insufficient to bring the grain to maturity. Nothing could be more  trying. We dug down in the bed of the river deeper and deeper as the  water receded, striving to get a little to keep the fruit-trees alive  for better times, but in vain. Needles lying out of doors for months did  not rust; and a mixture of sulphuric acid and water, used in a galvanic  battery, parted with all its water to the air, instead of imbibing more  from it, as it would have done in England. The leaves of indigenous  trees were all drooping, soft, and shriveled, though not dead; and those  of the mimosae were closed at midday, the same as they are at night.  In the midst of this dreary drought, it was wonderful to see those tiny  creatures, the ants, running about with their accustomed vivacity. I put  the bulb of a thermometer three inches under the soil, in the sun, at  midday, and found the mercury to stand at 132 Deg. to 134 Deg.; and if  certain kinds of beetles were placed on the surface, they ran about  a few seconds and expired. But this broiling heat only augmented the  activity of the long-legged black ants: they never tire; their organs of  motion seem endowed with the same power as is ascribed by physiologists  to the muscles of the human heart, by which that part of the frame never  becomes fatigued, and which may be imparted to all our bodily organs in  that higher sphere to which we fondly hope to rise. Where do these  ants get their moisture? Our house was built on a hard ferruginous  conglomerate, in order to be out of the way of the white ant, but they  came in despite the precaution; and not only were they, in this sultry  weather, able individually to moisten soil to the consistency of mortar  for the formation of galleries, which, in their way of working, is done  by night (so that they are screened from the observation of birds by day  in passing and repassing toward any vegetable matter they may wish to  devour), but, when their inner chambers were laid open, these were also  surprisingly humid. Yet there was no dew, and, the house being placed on  a rock, they could have no subterranean passage to the bed of the river,  which ran about three hundred yards below the hill. Can it be that they  have the power of combining the oxygen and hydrogen of their vegetable  food by vital force so as to form water?*       * When we come to Angola, I shall describe an insect there     which distills several pints of water every night.    Rain, however, would not fall. The Bakwains believed that I had bound  Sechele with some magic spell, and I received deputations, in the  evenings, of the old counselors, entreating me to allow him to make only  a few showers: \"The corn will die if you refuse, and we shall become  scattered. Only let him make rain this once, and we shall all, men,  women, and children, come to the school, and sing and pray as long as  you please.\" It was in vain to protest that I wished Sechele to act just  according to his own ideas of what was right, as he found the law laid  down in the Bible, and it was distressing to appear hard-hearted to  them. The clouds often collected promisingly over us, and rolling  thunder seemed to portend refreshing showers, but next morning the  sun would rise in a clear, cloudless sky; indeed, even these lowering  appearances were less frequent by far than days of sunshine are in  London.    The natives, finding it irksome to sit and wait helplessly until God  gives them rain from heaven, entertain the more comfortable idea that  they can help themselves by a variety of preparations, such as  charcoal made of burned bats, inspissated renal deposit of the mountain  cony--'Hyrax capensis'--(which, by the way, is used, in the form of  pills, as a good antispasmodic, under the name of \"stone-sweat\"*), the  internal parts of different animals--as jackals' livers, baboons' and  lions' hearts, and hairy calculi from the bowels of old cows--serpents'  skins and vertebrae, and every kind of tuber, bulb, root, and plant  to be found in the country. Although you disbelieve their efficacy  in charming the clouds to pour out their refreshing treasures, yet,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10430"],[0,"Trips to the Moon (#10)"],[1,"nothing but what is true.    To return to our voyage.  We took our leave of the king and his  friends, got on board our ship, and set sail.  Endymion made me a  present of two glass robes, two brass ones, and a whole coat of  armour made of lupines, all which I left in the whale's belly. {96}  He likewise sent with us a thousand Hippogypi, who escorted us five  hundred stadia.    We sailed by several places, and at length reached the new colony of  the Morning-star, where we landed and took in water; from thence we  steered into the Zodiac; leaving the Sun on our left, we passed  close by his territory, and would have gone ashore, many of our  companions being very desirous of it, but the wind would not permit  us; we had a view, however, of that region, and perceived that it  was green, fertile, and well-watered, and abounding in everything  necessary and agreeable.  The Nephelocentaurs, who are mercenaries  in the service of Phaeton, saw us and flew aboard our ship, but,  recollecting that we were included into the treaty, soon departed;  the Hippogypi likewise took their leave of us.    All the next night and day we continued our course downwards, and  towards evening came upon Lycnopolis:  {97} this city lies between  the Pleiades and the Hyades, and a little below the Zodiac:  we  landed, but saw no men, only a number of lamps running to and fro in  the market-place and round the port:  some little ones, the poor, I  suppose, of the place; others the rich and great among them, very  large, light, and splendid:  every one had its habitation or  candlestick to itself, and its own proper name, as men have.  We  heard them speak:  they offered us no injury, but invited us in the  most hospitable manner; we were afraid, notwithstanding:  neither  would any of us venture to take any food or sleep.  The king's court  is in the middle of the city; here he sits all night, calls every  one by name, and if they do not appear, condemns them to death for  deserting their post; their death is, to be put out; we stood by and  heard several of them plead their excuses for non-attendance.  Here  I found my own lamp, talked to him, and asked him how things went on  at home; he told me everything that had happened.  We stayed there  one night, and next day loosing our anchor, sailed off very near the  clouds; where we saw, and greatly admired the city of Nephelo-  coccygia, {98a} but the wind would not permit us to land.  Coronus,  the son of Cottiphion, is king there.  I remember Aristophanes,  {98b} the poet, speaks of him, a man of wisdom and veracity, the  truth of whose writings nobody can call in question.  About three  days after this, we saw the ocean very plainly, but no land, except  those regions which hang in the air, and which appeared to us all  bright and fiery.  The fourth day about noon, the wind subsiding, we  got safe down into the sea.  No sooner did we touch the water, but  we were beyond measure rejoiced.  We immediately gave every man his  supper, as much as we could afford, and afterwards jumped into the  sea and swam, for it was quite calm and serene.    It often happens, that prosperity is the forerunner of the greatest  misfortunes.  We had sailed but two days in the sea, when early in  the morning of the third, at sun-rise, we beheld on a sudden several  whales, and one amongst them, of a most enormous size, being not  less than fifteen hundred stadia in length, he came up to us with  his mouth wide open, disturbing the sea for a long way before him,  the waves dashing round on every side; he whetted his teeth, which  looked like so many long spears, and were white as ivory; we  embraced and took leave of one another, expecting him every moment;  he came near, and swallowed us up at once, ship and all; he did not,  however, crush us with his teeth, for the vessel luckily slipped  through one of the interstices; when we were got in, for some time  it was dark, and we could see nothing; but the whale happening to  gape, we beheld a large space big enough to hold a city with ten  thousand men in it; in the middle were a great number of small fish,  several animals cut in pieces, sails and anchors of ships, men's  bones, and all kinds of merchandise; there was likewise a good  quantity of land and hills, which seemed to have been formed of the  mud which he had swallowed; there was also a wood, with all sorts of  trees in it, herbs of every kind; everything, in short, seemed to  vegetate; the extent of this might be about two hundred and forty  stadia.  We saw also several sea-birds, gulls, and kingfishers,  making their nests in the branches.  At our first arrival in these  regions, we could not help shedding tears; in a little time,  however, I roused my companions, and we repaired our vessel; after  which, we sat down to supper on what the place afforded.  Fish of  all kinds we had here in plenty, and the remainder of the water  which we brought with us from the Morning-star.  When we got up the  next day, as often as the whale gaped, we could see mountains and  islands, sometimes only the sky, and plainly perceived by our motion  that he travelled through the sea at a great rate, and seemed to  visit every part of it.  At length, when our abode become familiar  to us, I took with me seven of my companions, and advanced into the  wood in order to see everything I could possibly; we had not gone  above five stadia, before we met with a temple dedicated to Neptune,  as we learned by the inscription on it, and a little farther on,  several sepulchres, monumental stones, and a fountain of clear  water; we heard the barking of a dog, and seeing smoke at some  distance from us, concluded there must be some habitation not far  off; we got on as fast as we could, and saw an old man and a boy  very busy in cultivating a little garden, and watering it from a  fountain; we were both pleased and terrified at the sight, and they,  as you may suppose, on their part not less affected, stood fixed in  astonishment and could not speak:  after some time, however, \"Who  are you?\" said the old man; \"and whence come ye? are you daemons of  the sea, or unfortunate men, like ourselves? for such we are, born  and bred on land, though now inhabitants of another element;  swimming along with this great creature, who carries us about with  him, not knowing what is to become of us, or whether we are alive or  dead.\"  To which I replied, \"We, father, are men as you are, and but  just arrived here, being swallowed up, together with our ship, but  three days ago; we came this way to see what the wood produced, for  it seemed large and full of trees; some good genius led us towards  you, and we have the happiness to find we are not the only poor  creatures shut up in this great monster; but give us an account of  your adventures, let us know who you are, and how you came here.\"  He would not however, tell us anything himself, or ask us any  questions, till he had performed the rites of hospitality; he took  us into his house, therefore, where he had got beds, and made  everything very commodious; here he presented us with herbs, fruit,  fish, and wine:  and when we were satisfied, began to inquire into  our history; when I acquainted him with everything that had happened  to us; the storm we met with; our adventures in the island; our  sailing through the air, the war, etc., from our first setting out,  even to our descent into the whale's belly.    He expressed his astonishment at what had befallen us, and then told  us his own story, which was as follows:--\"Strangers,\" said he, \"I am  a Cyprian by birth, and left my country to merchandise with this  youth, who is my son, and several servants.  We sailed to Italy with  goods of various kinds, some of which you may, perhaps, have seen in  the mouth of the whale; we came as far as Sicily with a prosperous  gale, when a violent tempest arose, and we were tossed about in the  ocean for three days, where we were swallowed up, men, ship and all,  by the whale, only we two remaining alive; after burying our  companions we built a temple to Neptune, and here we have lived ever  since, cultivating our little garden, raising herbs, and eating fish  or fruit.  The wood, as you see, is very large, and produces many  vines, from which we have excellent wine; there is likewise a  fountain, which perhaps you have observed, of fresh and very cold  water.  We make our bed of leaves, have fuel sufficient, and catch a  great many birds and live fish.  Getting out upon the gills of the  whale, there we wash ourselves when we please.  There is a salt  lake, about twenty stadia round, which produces fish of all kinds,  and where we row about in a little boat which we built on purpose.  It is now seven-and-twenty years since we were swallowed up.  Everything here, indeed, is very tolerable, except our neighbours,  who are disagreeable, troublesome, savage, and unsociable.\"  \"And  are there more,\" replied I, \"besides ourselves in the whale?\"  \"A  great many,\" said he, \"and those very unhospitable, and of a most  horrible appearance:  towards the tail, on the western parts of the  wood, live the Tarichanes, {104a} a people with eel's eyes, and  faces like crabs, bold, warlike, and that live upon raw flesh.  On  the other side, at the right hand wall, are the Tritonomendetes,  {104b} in their upper parts men, and in the lower resembling  weasels.  On the left are the Carcinochires, {104c} and the  Thynnocephali, {104d} who have entered into a league offensive and  defensive with each other.  The middle part is occupied by the  Paguradae, {105a} and the Psittopodes, {105b} a warlike nation, and  remarkably swift-footed.  The eastern parts, near the whale's mouth,  being washed by the sea, are most of them uninhabited.  I have some  of these, however, on condition of paying an annual tribute to the  Psittopodes of five hundred oysters.  Such is the situation of this  country; our difficulty is how to "]]]
