And apparently oblivious of the excitement,  Tennessee's Partner improved the opportunity to mop his face again with  his handkerchief.    When order was restored, and the man was made to understand, by the use  of forcible figures and rhetoric, that Tennessee's offense could not be  condoned by money, his face took a more serious and sanguinary hue,  and those who were nearest to him noticed that his rough hand trembled  slightly on the table. He hesitated a moment as he slowly returned the  gold to the carpetbag, as if he had not yet entirely caught the elevated  sense of justice which swayed the tribunal, and was perplexed with the  belief that he had not offered enough. Then he turned to the Judge, and  saying, \"This yer is a lone hand, played alone, and without my pardner,\"  he bowed to the jury and was about to withdraw when the Judge called him  back. \"If you have anything to say to Tennessee, you had better say it  now.\" For the first time that evening the eyes of the prisoner and his  strange advocate met. Tennessee smiled, showed his white teeth, and,  saying, \"Euchred, old man!\" held out his hand. Tennessee's Partner took  it in his own, and saying, \"I just dropped in as I was passin' to see  how things was gettin' on,\" let the hand passively fall, and adding that  it was a warm night, again mopped his face with his handkerchief, and  without another word withdrew.    The two men never again met each other alive. For the unparalleled  insult of a bribe offered to Judge Lynch--who, whether bigoted, weak,  or narrow, was at least incorruptible--firmly fixed in the mind of that  mythical personage any wavering determination of Tennessee's fate; and  at the break of day he was marched, closely guarded, to meet it at the  top of Marley's Hill.    How he met it, how cool he was, how he refused to say anything, how  perfect were the arrangements of the committee, were all duly reported,  with the addition of a warning moral and example to all future  evildoers, in the RED DOG CLARION, by its editor, who was present, and  to whose vigorous English I cheerfully refer the reader. But the beauty  of that midsummer morning, the blessed amity of earth and air and sky,  the awakened life of the free woods and hills, the joyous renewal and  promise of Nature, and above all, the infinite Serenity that thrilled  through each, was not reported, as not being a part of the social  lesson. And yet, when the weak and foolish deed was done, and a life,  with its possibilities and responsibilities, had passed out of the  misshapen thing that dangled between earth and sky, the birds sang, the  flowers bloomed, the sun shone, as cheerily as before; and possibly the  RED DOG CLARION was right.    Tennessee's Partner was not in the group that surrounded the ominous  tree. But as they turned to disperse attention was drawn to the singular  appearance of a motionless donkey cart halted at the side of the road.  As they approached, they at once recognized the venerable \"Jenny\" and  the two-wheeled cart as the property of Tennessee's Partner--used by him  in carrying dirt from his claim; and a few paces distant the owner  of the equipage himself, sitting under a buckeye tree, wiping the  perspiration from his glowing face. In answer to an inquiry, he said he  had come for the body of the \"diseased,\" \"if it was all the same to the  committee.\" He didn't wish to \"hurry anything\"; he could \"wait.\" He  was not working that day; and when the gentlemen were done with the  \"diseased,\" he would take him. \"Ef thar is any present,\" he added, in  his simple, serious way, \"as would care to jine in the fun'l, they  kin come.\" Perhaps it was from a sense of humor, which I have already  intimated was a feature of Sandy Bar--perhaps it was from something even  better than that; but two-thirds of the loungers accepted the invitation  at once.    It was noon when the body of Tennessee was delivered into the hands of  his Partner. As the cart drew up to the fatal tree, we noticed that  it contained a rough, oblong box--apparently made from a section of  sluicing and half-filled with bark and the tassels of pine. The cart was  further decorated with slips of willow, and made fragrant with buckeye  blossoms. When the body was deposited in the box, Tennessee's Partner  drew over it a piece of tarred canvas, and gravely mounting the narrow  seat in front, with his feet upon the shafts, urged the little donkey  forward. The equipage moved slowly on, at that decorous pace which  was habitual with \"Jenny\" even under less solemn circumstances. The  men--half curiously, half jestingly, but all good-humoredly--strolled  along beside the cart; some in advance, some a little in the rear of the  homely catafalque. But, whether from the narrowing of the road or some  present sense of decorum, as the cart passed on, the company fell to the  rear in couples, keeping step, and otherwise assuming the external show  of a formal procession. Jack Folinsbee, who had at the outset played a  funeral march in dumb show upon an imaginary trombone, desisted, from  a lack of sympathy and appreciation--not having, perhaps, your true  humorist's capacity to be content with the enjoyment of his own fun.    The way led through Grizzly Canyon--by this time clothed in funereal  drapery and shadows. The redwoods, burying their moccasined feet in  the red soil, stood in Indian file along the track, trailing an uncouth  benediction from their bending boughs upon the passing bier. A hare,  surprised into helpless inactivity, sat upright and pulsating in the  ferns by the roadside as the cortege went by. Squirrels hastened to gain  a secure outlook from higher boughs; and the bluejays, spreading their  wings, fluttered before them like outriders, until the outskirts of  Sandy Bar were reached, and the solitary cabin of Tennessee's Partner.    Viewed under more favorable circumstances, it would not have been a  cheerful place. The unpicturesque site, the rude and unlovely outlines,  the unsavory details, which distinguish the nest-building of the  California miner, were all here, with the dreariness of decay  superadded. A few paces from the cabin there was a rough enclosure,  which in the brief days of Tennessee's Partner's matrimonial felicity  had been used as a garden, but was now overgrown with fern. As we  approached it we were surprised to find that what we had taken for a  recent attempt at cultivation was the broken soil about an open grave.    The cart was halted before the enclosure; and rejecting the offers of  assistance with the same air of simple self-reliance he had displayed  throughout, Tennessee's Partner lifted the rough coffin on his back and  deposited it, unaided, within the shallow grave. He then nailed down  the board which served as a lid; and mounting the little mound of  earth beside it, took off his hat, and slowly mopped his face with his  handkerchief. This the crowd felt was a preliminary to speech; and they  disposed themselves variously on stumps and boulders, and sat expectant.    \"When a man,\" began Tennessee's Partner, slowly, \"has been running free  all day, what's the natural thing for him to do? Why, to come home. And  if he ain't in a condition to go home, what can his best friend do?  Why, bring him home! And here's Tennessee has been running free, and we  brings him home from his wandering.\" He paused, and picked up a fragment  of quartz, rubbed it thoughtfully on his sleeve, and went on: \"It ain't  the first time that I've packed him on my back, as you see'd me now.  It ain't the first time that I brought him to this yer cabin when he  couldn't help himself; it ain't the first time that I and 'Jinny' have  waited for him on yon hill, and picked him up and so fetched him home,  when he couldn't speak, and didn't know me. And now that it's the last  time, why\"--he paused and rubbed the quartz gently on his sleeve--\"you  see it's sort of rough on his pardner. And now, gentlemen,\" he added,  abruptly, picking up his long-handled shovel, \"the fun'l's over; and my  thanks, and Tennessee's thanks, to you for your trouble.\"    Resisting any proffers of assistance, he began to fill in the grave,  turning his back upon the crowd that after a few moments' hesitation  gradually withdrew. As they crossed the little ridge that hid Sandy  Bar from view, some, looking back, thought they could see Tennessee's  Partner, his work done, sitting upon the grave, his shovel between his  knees, and his face buried in his red bandanna handkerchief. But it was  argued by others that you couldn't tell his face from his handkerchief  at that distance; and this point remained undecided.      In the reaction that followed the feverish excitement of that day,  Tennessee's Partner was not forgotten. A secret investigation had  cleared him of any complicity in Tennessee's guilt, and left only a  suspicion of his general sanity. Sandy Bar made a point of calling on  him, and proffering various uncouth, but well-meant kindnesses. But from  that day his rude health and great strength seemed visibly to decline;  and when the rainy season fairly set in, and the tiny grass-blades were  beginning to peep from the rocky mound above Tennessee's grave, he took  to his bed. One night, when the pines beside the cabin were swaying in  the storm, and trailing their slender fingers over the roof, and the  roar and rush of the swollen river were heard below, Tennessee's  Partner lifted his head from the pillow, saying, \"It is time to go for  Tennessee; I must put 'Jinny' in the cart\"; and would have risen from  his bed but for the restraint of his attendant. Struggling, he still  pursued his singular fancy: \"There, now, steady, 'Jinny'--steady, old  girl. How dark it is! Look out for the ruts--and look out for him, too,  old gal. Sometimes, you know, when he's blind-drunk, he drops down right  in the trail.

W. two or  three miles. From that time until evening, we worked to windward against  a breeze from the north-east, which afterwards veered to N. N. W.; and at  nine o'clock, a small anchor was dropped in 14 fathoms, two miles from  the shore. The Lady Nelson had fallen to leeward; and made no answer to  our signals during the night.    FRIDAY 20 AUGUST 1802    At daylight, supposing the brig had passed us by means of a shift of wind  to W. N. W., we proceeded along the coast to the island lying off Cape  Manifold. This island, with some of the northern hills, had been sketched  by Mr. Westall (Atlas, Plate XVIII. View 6.) on the preceding evening; it  is slightly covered with vegetation, and lies in latitude 22 deg. 42', and  longitude 150 deg. 50'. The cape is formed of several rocky heads and  intermediate beaches; and the hills behind, from which the cape was  named, rise one over the other to the two peaks set from Cape Keppel, and  appeared to be rocky and barren. The easternmost, and somewhat the  highest peak, is about four miles from the shore, and lies S. 49 deg. W. from  the east end of the island whose situation is above given.    The wind was from the northward at noon, and we were then making a  stretch for the land, which was distant four or five miles.    Latitude, observed to the north,                    34 deg. 361/2'  C. Manifold, east end of the island,              S. 1   W.  C. Manifold, the highest peak,                    S. 301/2 W.  Small isle (Entrance I.) at the northern extreme, N. 29  W.  Peaked islet in the offing, distant 7 miles,      S. 61  E.    From Cape Manifold the coast falls back to a sandy beach, six miles long,  and near it are some scattered rocks. The land is there very low; but at  the north end of the beach is a hilly projection, from which we tacked at  one o'clock, in 12 fathoms; being then within a mile of two rocks, and  two miles from the main land. The brig was seen to the south-eastward,  and we made a long stretch off, to give her an opportunity of joining,  and at two in the morning [SATURDAY 21 AUGUST 1802] lay by for her; but  the wind veering to south-west at five, we stretched in for the land, and  approached some rocky islets, part of the Harvey's Isles of captain Cook,  of which, and of the main coast as far as Island Head, Mr. Westall made a  sketch (Atlas, Plate XVIII. View 7). At half past nine, when we tacked  from Harvey's Isles, I was surprised to see trees upon them resembling  the pines of Norfolk Island; none such having been before noticed upon  this coast, nor to my knowledge, upon any coast of Terra Australis. Pines  were also distinguished upon a more southern islet, four miles off, the  same which had been the northern extreme at the preceding noon; and  behind it was a deep bight in the land where there seemed to be shelter.  The breeze had then shifted to south, and the Lady Nelson being to  windward, the signal was made for her to look for anchorage; but the brig  being very leewardly, we passed her and stood into the bight by an  opening between the islets of one mile wide and from 10 to 7 fathoms in  depth. On the soundings decreasing to 5, we tacked and came to an anchor  near the pine island in the entrance, in 7 fathoms coarse sand, exposed  between N. 75 deg. and S. 23 deg. E, and the wind was then at south-east; but  having a fair passage by which we could run out to the northward., in  case of necessity, I did not apprehend any danger to the vessels.    [EAST COAST. PORT BOWEN.]    Instead of a bight in the coast, we found this to be a port of some  extent; which had not only escaped the observation of captain Cook, but  from the shift of wind, was very near being missed by us also. I named it  PORT BOWEN, in compliment to captain James Bowen of the navy; and to the  hilly projection on the south side of the entrance (see the sketch), I  gave the appellation of Cape Clinton, after colonel Clinton of the 85th,  who commanded the land, as captain Bowen did the sea forces at Madeira,  when we stopped at that island    A boat was despatched with the scientific gentlemen to the north side,  where the hills rise abruptly and have a romantic appearance; another  went to the same place to haul the seine at a small beach in front of a  gully between the hills, where there was a prospect of obtaining fresh  water; and a third boat was sent to _Entrance Island_ with the carpenters  to cut pine logs for various purposes, but principally to make a main  sliding keel for the Lady Nelson. Our little consort sailed indifferently  at the best; but since the main keel had been carried away at Facing  Island, it was as unsafe to trust her on a lee shore, even in moderate  weather. On landing at Entrance Island, to take angles and inspect the  form of the port, I saw an arm extending behind Cape Clinton to the  southward, which had the appearance of a river; a still broader arm ran  westward, until it was lost behind the land; and between Entrance Island  and Cape Clinton was a space three miles wide, where nothing appeared to  obstruct the free passage of a ship into both arms. Finding the port to  be worthy of examination, and learning that the seine had been successful  and that good water was to be procured, I left orders with lieutenant  Fowler to employ the people in getting off pine logs and watering the  ship; and early next morning [SUNDAY 22 AUGUST 1802], set off in my whale  boat upon an excursion round the port.    From the ship to the inner part of Cape Clinton the soundings were from 5  to 8 fathoms, on a sandy bottom; but close to the innermost point there  was no ground at 10 fathoms. From thence I steered up the western arm,  passing to the south of a central rock lying a mile out; and got with  difficulty to the projection named _West-water Head_. The arm terminated  a little further on; but to the northward, over the land, I saw a long  shallow bay at the back of Island Head, and beyond it was the sea. This  western arm being full of sandy shoals, and of no utility, if at all  accessible to ships, I observed the latitude and took angles, and then  returned to the inner part of Cape Clinton. In rowing to the southward,  close along the inside of the cape, we had from 3 to 9 fathoms water; but  it was too late in the evening to make an examination of the southern  arm, and I therefore ascended a hill near the shore, to inspect it. This  was called _East-water Hill_, and I saw from its top, that the southern  arm extended S. 16 deg. W. about seven miles, to the foot of the hills behind  Cape Manifold, where it terminated in shallows and mangroves. Close under  Eastwater Hill there was a small branch running eastward, nearly  insulating Cape Clinton; but neither this branch nor the main arm seemed  to be deep enough to admit a ship much higher than the cape; and in  consequence, I gave up the further examination, and returned on board at  seven o'clock.    Amongst the useful bearings for the survey, taken at Eastwater Hill, were  the following:      Entrance Island, centre,                 N. 9 deg. 45' E.  Peaked Islet in the offing,              S. 58 45  E.  Cape Manifold, east end of the island,   S. 29 40  E.  Cape Manifold, highest of the two peaks, S.  3 20  W.      By means of this last bearing, the longitude of Port Bowen was connected  with Keppel Bay and Port Curtis, independently of the time keepers.    A fresh wind from the south-eastward had blown all day, and raised so  much surf on the north side of the port, that our watering there was much  impeded; a midshipman and party of men remained on shore with casks all  night, and it was not until next evening [MONDAY 23 AUGUST 1802] that the  holds were completed and pine logs got on board. The water was very good;  it drained down the gully to a little beach between two projecting beads  which have rocky islets lying off them. The gully is on the west side of  the northern entrance, and will easily be known, since we sent there on  first coming to an anchor, in the expectation of finding water, but Mr.  Westall's sketch will obviate any difficulty (Atlas, Plate XVIII. View  9).    There were pine trees in the watering gully and on the neighbouring  hills; but the best, and also the most convenient, were those upon  Entrance Island, some of them being fit to make top masts for ships. The  branches are very brittle; but the carpenter thought the trunks to be  tough, and superior to the Norway pine, both for spars and planks:  turpentine exudes from between the wood and the bark, in considerable  quantities.    For a ship wanting to take in water and pine logs, the most convenient  place is under Entrance Island, where we lay in the Investigator; indeed  fresh water was not found in any other place; but this anchorage is not  tenable against a strong south-east wind. At the entrance of the southern  arm, just within Cape Clinton, a ship may lie at all times in perfect  safety; and might either be laid on shore or be hove down, there being 3  fathoms close to the rocks, at each end of the beach; it is moreover  probable, that fresh water might be there found, or be procured by  digging at the foot of the hills. In the southern arm the bottom is  muddy; but it is of sand in other parts of the port.    Of the country round Port Bowen not much can be said in praise; it is in  general either sandy or stony, and unfit for cultivation; nevertheless,  besides pines, there are trees, principally _eucalyptus_, of moderate  size, and the vallies of Cape Clinton are overspread with a tolerably  good grass. No inhabitants were seen, but in every part where I landed,  fires had been made, and the woods of Cape Clinton were then burning; the  natives had also been upon Entrance Island, which implied them to have  canoes, although none were seen.
