Among the most striking and commonly observed manifestations of  insanity are certain disorders of the flow of utterance which appear  to be dependent upon a derangement of the psychical processes commonly  termed association of ideas. These disorders have to some extent been  made the subject of psychological experimentation, and the object of  this investigation is to continue and extend the study of these  phenomena by an application of the experimental method known as the  association test.        § 1. METHOD OF INVESTIGATION.      In this investigation we have followed a modified form of the method  developed by Sommer,[1] the essential feature of which is the  statistical treatment of results obtained by uniform technique from a  large number of cases.    [Footnote 1: Diagnostik der Geisteskrankheiten, p. 112.]    The stimulus consists of a series of one hundred spoken words, to each  of which the subject is directed to react by the first word which it  makes him think of. In the selection of the stimulus words, sixty-six  of which were taken from the list suggested by Sommer, we have taken  care to avoid such words as are especially liable to call up personal  experiences, and have so arranged the words as to separate any two  which bear an obviously close relation to one another. After much  preliminary experimentation we adopted the following list of words:    01 Table  02 Dark  03 Music  04 Sickness  05 Man  06 Deep  07 Soft  08 Eating  09 Mountain  10 House  11 Black  12 Mutton  13 Comfort  14 Hand  15 Short  16 Fruit  17 Butterfly  18 Smooth  19 Command  20 Chair  21 Sweet  22 Whistle  23 Woman  24 Cold  25 Slow  26 Wish  27 River  28 White  29 Beautiful  30 Window  31 Rough  32 Citizen  33 Foot  34 Spider  35 Needle  36 Red  37 Sleep  38 Anger  39 Carpet  40 Girl  41 High  42 Working  43 Sour  44 Earth  45 Trouble  46 Soldier  47 Cabbage  48 Hard  49 Eagle  50 Stomach    No attempt is made to secure uniformity of external conditions for the  test; the aim has been rather to make it so simple as to render  strictly experimental conditions unnecessary. The test may be made in  any room that is reasonably free from distracting influences; the  subject is seated with his back toward the experimenter, so that he  cannot see the record; he is requested to respond to each stimulus  word by one word, the first word that occurs to him other than the  stimulus word itself, and on no account more than one word. If an  untrained subject reacts by a sentence or phrase, a compound word, or  a different grammatical form of the stimulus word, the reaction is  left unrecorded, and the stimulus word is repeated at the close of the  test.    In this investigation no account is taken of the reaction time. The  reasons for this will be explained later.    The general plan has been first to apply the test to normal persons,  so as to derive empirically a normal standard and to determine, if  possible, the nature and limits of normal variation; and then to apply  it to cases of various forms of insanity and to compare the results  with the normal standard, with a view to determining the nature of  pathological variation.        § 2. THE NORMAL STANDARD.      In order to establish a standard which should fairly represent at  least all the common types of association and which should show the  extent of such variation as might be due to differences in sex,  temperament, education, and environment, we have applied the test to  over one thousand normal subjects.    Among these subjects were persons of both sexes and of ages ranging  from eight years to over eighty years, persons following different  occupations, possessing various degrees of mental capacity and  education, and living in widely separated localities. Many were from  Ireland, and some of these had but recently arrived in this country;  others were from different parts of Europe, but all were able to speak  English with at least fair fluency. Over two hundred of the subjects,  including a few university professors and other highly practiced  observers, were professional men and women or college students. About  five hundred were employed in one or another of the New York State  hospitals for the insane, either as nurses and attendants or as  workers at various trades; the majority of these were persons of  common school education, but the group includes also, on the one hand,  a considerable number of high school graduates; and on the other hand,  a few laborers who were almost or wholly illiterate. Nearly one  hundred and fifty of the subjects were boys and girls of high school  age, pupils of the Ethical Culture School, New York City. The  remaining subjects form a miscellaneous group, consisting largely of  clerks and farmers.        § 3. THE FREQUENCY TABLES.      From the records obtained from these normal subjects, including in all  100,000 reactions, we have compiled a series of tables, one for each  stimulus word, showing all the different reactions given by one  thousand subjects in response to that stimulus word, and the frequency  with which each reaction has occurred. [1] These tables will be found  at the end of this paper.    [Footnote 1: A similar method of treating associations has been used  by Cattell (Mind, Vol. XII, p. 68; Vol. XIV, p. 230), and more  recently by Reinhold (Zeitschr. f. Psychol., Vol. LIV, p. 183), but  for other purposes.]    With the exception of a few distinctive proper names, which are  indicated by initials, we have followed the plan of introducing each  word into the table exactly as it was found in the record. In the  arrangement of the words in each table, we have placed together all  the derivatives of a single root, regardless of the strict  alphabetical order.[1]    [Footnote 1: It should be mentioned that we have discovered a few  errors in these tables. Some of these were made in compiling them from  the records, and were evidently due to the assistant's difficulty of  reading a strange handwriting. Other errors have been found in the  records themselves. Each of the stimulus words _butter_, _tobacco_ and  _king_ appears from the tables to have been repeated by a subject as a  reaction; such a reaction, had it occurred, would not have been  accepted, and it is plain that the experimenter wrote the stimulus  word in the space where the reaction word should have been written.  Still other errors were due to the experimenter's failure to speak  with sufficient distinctness when reading off the stimulus words;  thus, the reaction _barks_ in response to _dark_ indicates that the  stimulus word was probably understood as _dog_; and the reactions  _blue_ and _color_ in response to _bread_ indicate that the stimulus  word was understood as _red_.]    The total number of different words elicited in response to any  stimulus word is limited, varying from two hundred and eighty words in  response to _anger_ to seventy-two words in response to _needle_.  Furthermore, for the great majority of subjects the limits are still  narrower; to take a striking instance, in response to _dark_ eight  hundred subjects gave one or another of the following seven words:  _light, night, black, color, room, bright, gloomy;_ while only two  hundred gave reactions other than these words; and only seventy  subjects, out of the total number of one thousand, gave reactions  which were not given by any other subject.    If any record obtained by this method be examined by referring to the  frequency tables, the reactions contained in it will fall into two  classes: the _common_ reactions, those which are to be found in  the tables, and the _individual_ reactions, those which are not  to be found in the tables. For the sake of accuracy, any reaction word  which is not found in the table in its identical form, but which is a  grammatical variant of a word found there, may be classed as    _doubtful_.    The value of any reaction may be expressed by the figure representing  the percentage of subjects who gave it. Thus the reaction,  _table--chair_, which was given by two hundred and sixty-seven  out of the total of our one thousand subjects, possesses a value of  26.7 per cent.

STANLEY HALL, Ph.D., LL.D.  President of Clark University and  Professor of Psychology  And Pedagogy        PREFACE      I have often been asked to select and epitomize the practical and  especially the pedagogical conclusions of my large volumes on  Adolescence, published in 1904, in such form that they may be  available at a minimum cost to parents, teachers, reading circles,  normal schools, and college classes, by whom even the larger volumes  have been often used. This, with the cooperation of the publishers and  with the valuable aid of Superintendent C.N. Kendall of Indianapolis,  I have tried to do, following in the main the original text, with only  such minor changes and additions as were necessary to bring the topics  up to date, and adding a new chapter on moral and religions education.  For the scientific justification of my educational conclusions I must,  of course, refer to the larger volumes. The last chapter is not in  \"Adolescence,\" but is revised from a paper printed elsewhere. I am  indebted to Dr. Theodore L. Smith of Clark University for verification  of all references, proof-reading, and many minor changes.    G. STANLEY HALL.

The years from about eight to twelve constitute a unique period of  human life. The acute stage of teething is passing, the brain has  acquired nearly its adult size and weight, health is almost at its  best, activity is greater and more varied than it ever was before or  ever will be again, and there is peculiar endurance, vitality, and  resistance to fatigue. The child develops a life of its own outside  the home circle, and its natural interests are never so independent of  adult influence. Perception is very acute, and there is great immunity  to exposure, danger, accident, as well as to temptation. Reason, true  morality, religion, sympathy, love, and esthetic enjoyment are but  very slightly developed.    Everything, in short, suggests that this period may represent in the  individual what was once for a very protracted and relatively  stationary period an age of maturity in the remote ancestors of our  race, when the young of our species, who were perhaps pygmoid, shifted  for themselves independently of further parental aid. The qualities  developed during pre-adolescence are, in the evolutionary history of  the race, far older than hereditary traits of body and mind which  develop later and which may be compared to a new and higher story  built upon our primal nature. Heredity is so far both more stable and  more secure. The elements of personality are few, but are well  organised on a simple, effective plan. The momentum of these traits  inherited from our indefinitely remote ancestors is great, and they  are often clearly distinguishable from those to be added later. Thus  the boy is father of the man in a new sense, in that his qualities are  indefinitely older and existed, well compacted, untold ages before the  more distinctly human attributes were developed. Indeed there are a  few faint indications of an earlier age node, at about the age of six,  as if amid the instabilities of health we could detect signs that this  may have been the age of"]]]
