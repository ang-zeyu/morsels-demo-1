And so  he, being a master-spirit, planned and builded the smaller Redoubt,  being aided thereto by four millions, who also were weary of the harass  of the monsters; but until then had been wanderers, because of the  restlessness of their blood.    And they had chosen that place, because there they had discovered a sign  of the Earth-Current in a great valley which led to the shore; for  without the Earth-Current no Refuge could have existence. And whilst  many builded and guarded, and cared for the Great Camp in which all  lived, others worked within a great shaft; and in ten years had made  this to a distance of many miles, and therewith they tapt the  Earth-Current; but not a great stream; yet a sufficiency, as was  believed.    And, presently, after many years, they had builded the Pyramid, and  taken up their refuge there, and made them instruments, and ordained  Monstruwacans; so that they had speech daily with the Great Pyramid; and  thus for many long ages.    And the Earth-Current then to begin to fail; and though they laboured  through many thousands of years, they came to no better resource. And so  it was they ceased to have communication with the Great Redoubt; for the  current had a lack of power to work the instruments; and the recording  instruments ceased to be sensible of our messages.    And thereafter came a million years, maybe, of silence; with ever the  birthing and marrying and dying of those lonesome humans. And they grew  less; and some put this to the lack of the Earth-Current, which dwindled  slowly through the centuries of that Eternity.    And once in a thousand years, maybe, one among them would be Sensitive,  and abled to hear beyond ordinary; and to these, at times, there would  seem to come the thrilling of the aether; so that such an one would go  listening; and sometimes seem to catch half messages; and so awaken a  great interest in all the Pyramid; and there would be turning up of old  Records, and many words and writings, and attempts to send the  Master-Word through the night; in which, doubtless sometimes they  succeeded; for there was set down in the Records of the Great Redoubt  certain occasions on which there had come the call of the Master-Word,  which had been arranged and made holy between the two Redoubts in the  early days of that second life of this world.    Yet, now for an hundred thousand years, there had been none Sensitive;  and in that time the people of the Pyramid had become no more than ten  thousand; and the Earth-Current was weak and powerless to put the joy of  life into them; so that they went listlessly, but deemed it not strange,  because of so many aeons of usage.    And then, to the wonder of all, the Earth-Current had put forth a new  power; so that young people ceased to be old over-soon; and there was  happiness and a certain joy in the living; and a strange birthing of  children, such as had not been through half a million years.    And then came a new thing. Naani, the daughter of the Master  Monstruwacan of that Redoubt had shown to all that she was Sensitive;  for she had perceived odd vibrations afloat in the night; and concerning  these she told her father; and presently, because their blood moved  afresh in their bodies, they had heart to discover the plans of the  ancient instruments; for the instruments had long rusted, and been  forgotten.    And so they builded them a new instrument to send forth a message; for  they had no memory at that time that the brain-elements had power to do  thus; though, mayhap, their brain-elements were weakened, through so  many ages of starvation of the Earth-Current, and could not have obeyed,  even had their masters known all that we of the Great Redoubt knew.    And when the instrument was finished, to Naani was given the right to  call first across the dark to discover whether indeed, after that  million years of silence, they were yet companied upon this earth, or  whether they were in truth lonely--the last poor thousands of the  Humans.    And a great and painful excitement came upon the people of the lesser  pyramid; for the loneliness of the world pressed upon them; and it was  to them as though we in this age called to a star across the abyss of  space.    And because of the excitement and pain of the moment, Naani called only  vaguely with the instrument into the dark; and lo! in a moment, as it  seemed, there came all about her in the night the solemn throb of the  Master-Word, beating in the night. And Naani cried out that she was  answered, and, as may be thought, many of the people wept, and some  prayed, and some were silent; but others beseeched her that she call  again and quickly to have further speech with those of their kind.    And Naani spoke the Master-Word into the night, and directly there came  a calling all about her: \"Mirdath! Mirdath!\" and the strange wonder of  it made her silent a moment; but when she would have made reply, the  instrument had ceased to work, and she could have no further speech at  that time.    This, as may be thought, occasioned much distress; and constant work  they had between the instrument and the Earth-Current, to discover the  reason for this failing; but could not for a great while. And in that  time, oft did Naani hear the call of \"Mirdath\" thrilling about her; and  twice there came the solemn beat of the Master-Word in the night. Yet  never had she the power to answer. And all that while, as I learned in  time, was she stirred with a quaint ache at heart by the voice that  called \"Mirdath!\" as it might be the Spirit of Love, searching for its  mate; for this is how she put it.    And thus it chanced, that the constant thrilling of this name about her,  woke her to memory of a book she had read in early years, and but half  understood; for it was ancient, and writ in an olden fashion, and it set  out the love of a man and a maid, and the maid's name was Mirdath. And  so, because she was full of this great awakening of those ages of  silence, and the calling of that name, she found the book again, and  read it many times, and grew to a sound love of the beauty of that tale.    And, presently, when the instrument was made right, she called into the  night the name of that man within the book; and so it came about that I  had hoped too much; yet even now was I strangely unsure whether to cease  from hoping.    And one other thing there is which I would make clear. Many and oft a  time had I heard a thrilling of sweet, faint laughter about me, and the  stirring of the aether by words too gentle to come clearly; and these I  make no doubt came from Naani, using her brain-elements unwittingly and  in ignorance; but very eager to answer my callings; and having no  knowledge that, far off across the blackness of the world, they thrilled  about me, constantly.    And after Naani had made clear all that I have set out concerning the  Lesser Refuge, she told further how that food was not plentiful with  them; though, until the reawakening of the Earth-Current, they had gone  unknowing of this, being of small appetite, and caring little for aught;  but now wakened, and newly hungry, they savoured a lack of taste in all  that they ate; and this we could well conceive, from our reasonings and  theory; but happily not from our knowledge.    And we said unto them, that the soil had lost its life, and the crops  therefrom were not vital; and a great while it would take for the earth  within their pyramid to receive back the life-elements. And we told them  certain ways by which they might bring a more speedy life to the soil;  and this they were eager to do, being freshly alive after so long a time  of half-life.    And now, you must know that in all the great Redoubt the story went  downwards swiftly, and was published in all the Hour-Sheets, with many  comments; and the libraries were full of those who would look up the  olden Records, which for so long had been forgotten, or taken, as we of  this day would say, with a pinch of salt.    And all the time I was pestered with questions; so that, had I not been  determined, I should scarce have been allowed to sleep; moreover, so  much was writ about me, and my power to hear, and divers stories  concerning tales of love, that I had been like to have grown mazed to  take note of it all; yet some note I did take, and much I found  pleasant; but some displeasing.    And, for the rest, I was not spoiled, as the saying goes; for I had my  work to do; moreover, I was always busied Listening, and having speech  through the darkness. Though if any saw me so, they would question; and  because of this, I kept much to the Tower of Observation, where was the  Master Monstruwacan, and a greater discipline.    And then began a fresh matter; though but an old enough trick; for I  speak now of the days that followed that re-opening of the talk between  the Pyramids. Oft would speech come to us out of the night; and there  would be tales of the sore need of the Lesser Redoubt, and callings for  help. Yet, when I sent the Master-Word abroad, there would be no  answering. And so I feared that the Monsters and Forces of Evil _knew_.    Yet, at times, the Master-Word would answer to us, beating steadily in  the night; and when we questioned afresh, we knew that they in the  Lesser Redoubt had caught the beat of the Master-Word, and so made  reply; though it had not been they who had made the previous talk, which  we had sought to test by the Word. And then they would make  contradiction of all that had been spoken so cunningly; so that we knew  the Monsters and Forces had sought to tempt some from the safety of the  Redoubt. Yet, was this no new thing, as I have made to hint; saving that  it grew now to a greater persistence, and there was a loathsome cunning  in the using of this new knowledge to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10671"],[0,"The Botanic Garden.

Your verses, Mr. Botanist, consist of _pure description_, I  hope there is _sense_ in the notes.    _Poet_. I am only a flower-painter, or occasionally attempt a landskip;  and leave the human figure with the subjects of history to abler artists.    _B._ It is well to know what subjects are within the limits of your  pencil; many have failed of success from the want of this self-knowledge.  But pray tell me, what is the essential difference between Poetry and  Prose? is it solely the melody or measure of the language?    _P._ I think not solely; for some prose has its melody, and even measure.  And good verses, well spoken in a language unknown to the hearer, are not  easily to be distinguished from good prose. _B_. Is it the sublimity,  beauty, or novelty of the sentiments?    _P_. Not so; for sublime sentiments are often better expressed in prose.  Thus when Warwick in one of the plays of Shakespear, is left wounded on  the field after the loss of the battle, and his friend says to him, \"Oh,  could you but fly!\" what can be more sublime than his answer, \"Why then,  I would not fly.\" No measure of verse, I imagine, could add dignity to  this sentiment. And it would be easy to select examples of the beautiful  or new from prose writers, which I suppose no measure of verse could  improve.    _B_. In what then consists the essential difference between Poetry and  Prose?    _P_. Next to the measure of the language, the principal distinction  appears to me to consist in this: that Poetry admits of but few words  expressive of very abstracted ideas, whereas Prose abounds with them. And  as our ideas derived from visible objects are more distinct than those  derived from the objects of our other senses, the words expressive of  these ideas belonging to vision make up the principal part of poetic  language. That is, the Poet writes principally to the eye, the  Prose-writer uses more abstracted terms. Mr. Pope has written a bad verse  in the Windsor Forest:      \"And Kennet swift for silver Eels _renown'd_.\"    The word renown'd does not present the idea of a visible object to the  mind, and is thence prosaic. But change this line thus,    \"And Kennet swift, where silver Graylings _play_.\"  and it becomes poetry, because the scenery is then brought before the  eye.    _B_. This may be done in prose.    _P_. And when it is done in a single word, it animates the prose; so it  is more agreeable to read in Mr. Gibbon's History, \"Germany was at this  time _over-shadowed_ with extensive forests;\" than Germany was at this  time _full_ of extensive forests. But where this mode of expression  occurs too frequently, the prose approaches to poetry: and in graver  works, where we expect to be instructed rather than amused, it becomes  tedious and impertinent. Some parts of Mr. Burke's eloquent orations  become intricate and enervated by superfluity of poetic ornament; which  quantity of ornament would have been agreeable in a poem, where much  ornament is expected.    _B_. Is then the office of poetry only to amuse?    _P_. The Muses are young ladies, we expect to see them dressed; though  not like some modern beauties with so much gauze and feather, that \"the  Lady herself is the least part of her.\" There are however didactic pieces  of poetry, which are much admired, as the Georgics of Virgil, Mason's  English Garden, Hayley's Epistles; nevertheless Science is best delivered  in Prose, as its mode of reasoning is from stricter analogies than  metaphors or similies.    _B_. Do not Personifications and Allegories distinguish poetry?    _P_. These are other arts of bringing objects before the eye; or of  expressing sentiments in the language of vision; and are indeed better  suited to the pen than the pencil.    _B_. That is strange, when you have just said they are used to bring  their objects before the eye.    _P_. In poetry the personification or allegoric figure is generally  indistinct, and therefore does not strike us as forcibly as to make us  attend to its improbability; but in painting, the figures being all much  more distinct, their improbability becomes apparent, and seizes our  attention to it. Thus the person of Concealment is very indistinct and  therefore does not compel us to attend to its improbability, in the  following beautiful lines of Shakespear:            \"--She never told her love;          But let Concealment, like a worm i' th' bud,          Feed on her damask cheek.\"--    But in these lines below the person of Reason obtrudes itself into our  company, and becomes disagreeable by its distinctness, and consequent  improbability.            \"To Reason I flew, and intreated her aid,          Who paused on my case, and each circumstance weigh'd;          Then gravely reply'd in return to my prayer,          That Hebe was fairest of all that were fair.          That's a truth, reply'd I, I've no need to be taught,          I came to you, Reason, to find out a fault.          If that's all, says Reason, return as you came,          To find fault with Hebe would forfeit my name.\"    Allegoric figures are on this account in general less manageable in  painting and in statuary than in poetry: and can seldom be introduced in  the two former arts in company with natural figures, as is evident  from the ridiculous effect of many of the paintings of Rubens in the  Luxemburgh gallery; and for this reason, because their improbability  becomes more striking, when there are the figures of real persons by  their side to compare them with. Mrs. Angelica Kauffman, well apprised of  this circumstance, has introduced no mortal figures amongst her Cupids  and her Graces. And the great Roubiliac, in his unrivalled monument of  Time and Fame struggling for the trophy of General Fleming, has only hung  up a medallion of the head of the hero of the piece. There are however  some allegoric figures, which we have so often heard described or seen  delineated, that we almost forget that they do not exist in common life;  and hence view them without astonishment; as the figures of the heathen  mythology, of angels, devils, death and time; and almost believe them  to be realities, even when they are mixed with representations of the  natural forms of man. Whence I conclude, that a certain degree of  probability is necessary to prevent us from revolting with distaste from  unnatural images; unless we are otherwise so much interested in the  contemplation of them as not to perceive their improbability.    _B_. Is this reasoning about degrees of probability just?--When Sir Joshua  Reynolds, who is unequalled both in the theory and practice of his art,  and who is a great master of the pen as well as the pencil, has asserted  in a discourse delivered to the Royal Academy, December 11, 1786, that  \"the higher styles of painting, like the higher kinds of the Drama, do  not aim at any thing like deception; or have any expectation, that the  spectators should think the events there represented are really passing  before them.\" And he then accuses Mr. Fielding of bad judgment, when he  attempts to compliment Mr. Garrick in one of his novels, by introducing  an ignorant man, mistaking the representation of a scene in Hamlet for a  reality; and thinks, because he was an ignorant man, he was less liable  to make such a mistake.    _P_. It is a metaphysical question, and requires more attention than Sir  Joshua has bestowed upon it.--You will allow, that we are perfectly  deceived in our dreams; and that even in our waking reveries, we are  often so much absorbed in the contemplation of what passes in our  imaginations, that for a while we do not attend to the lapse of time or  to our own locality; and thus suffer a similar kind of deception as in  our dreams. That is, we believe things present before our eyes, which are  not so.    There are two circumstances, which contribute to this compleat deception  in our dreams. First, because in sleep the organs of sense are closed or  inert, and hence the trains of ideas associated in our imaginations are  never interrupted or dissevered by the irritations of external objects,  and can not therefore be contrasted with our sensations. On this account,  though we are affected with a variety of passions in our dreams, as  anger, love, joy; yet we never experience surprize.--For surprize is only  produced when any external irritations suddenly obtrude themselves, and  dissever our passing trains of ideas.    Secondly, because in sleep there is a total suspension of our voluntary  power, both over the muscles of our bodies, and the ideas of our minds;  for we neither walk about, nor reason in compleat sleep. Hence, as the  trains of ideas are passing in our imaginations in dreams, we cannot  compare them with our previous knowledge of things, as we do in our  waking hours; for this is a voluntary exertion; and thus we cannot  perceive their incongruity. Thus we are deprived in sleep of the only  two means by which we can distinguish the trains of ideas passing in our  imaginations, from those excited by our sensations; and are led by their  vivacity to believe them to belong to the latter. For the vivacity of  these trains of ideas, passing in the imagination, is greatly increased  by the causes above-mentioned; that is, by their not being disturbed or  dissevered either by the appulses of external bodies, as in surprize; or  by our voluntary exertions in comparing them with our previous"]]]
