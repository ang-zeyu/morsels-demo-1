BY THE LATE    JOHN LEWIS BURCKHARDT    PUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR PROMOTING  THE DISCOVERY OF THE INTERIOR OF AFRICA      LONDON : HENRY COLBURN, NEW BURLINGTON STREET, 1829.        [p.v] PREFACE OF THE EDITOR.    SOME years have now elapsed since two distinct portions of Burckhardts  works (his Travels in Nubia and Syria) were offered to the public, and  most favourably received; their success being insured not only by  instrinsic merit, but by the celebrity of their editor as a scholar and  antiquary, a traveller and a geographer. It must not however be  inferred, from any delay in publishing the present volume, that its  contents are less worthy of notice than those parts which have already  proved so interesting and instructive to a multitude of readers. It was  always intended that this Journal, and other writings of the same  lamented author, should issue successively from the press: There still  remain, says Colonel Leake, in his Preface to the Syrian Journal (p.  ii.) manuscripts sufficient to fill two volumes: one of these will  consist of his Travels in Arabia, which were confined to the Hedjaz or  Holy Land of the Muselmans, the part least accessible to Christians; the  fourth volume will contain very copious remarks on the Arabs of the  Desert, and particularly the Wahabys.    [p.vi] Respecting the portion now before the reader, Colonel Leake, in  another place, expresses a highly flattering opinion. Burckhardt, says  he, transmitted to the Association the most accurate and complete  account of the Hedjaz, including the cities of Mekka and Medina, which  has ever been received in Europe. His knowledge of the Arabic language,  and of Mohammedan manners, had enabled him to assume the Muselman  character with such success, that he resided at Mekka during the whole  time of the pilgrimage, and passed through the various ceremonies of the  occasion, without the smallest suspicion having arisen as to his real  character. (See the Life of Burckhardt prefixed to his Travels in  Nubia, p. lvii. 4to. edition, 1819).    Recommended so strongly, the work of a less eminent traveller would be  entitled to our notice: this presents itself with another claim; for the  manuscript Journal was partly corrected and prepared for publication by  the learned editor of Burckhardts former writings. But some important  literary occupations prevented Colonel Leake from superintending the  progress of this volume through the press. His plan, however, has been  almost invariably adopted by the actual editor; particularly in  expressing with scrupulous fidelity the authors sentiments on all  occasions, and in retaining, without any regard to mere elegance of  style or selection of terms, his original language, wherever an  alteration was not absolutely necessary to reconcile with our system of  phraseology and grammatical construction certain foreign idioms which  had crept into his English writings. [It was thought expedient, from  circumstances of typographical convenience tending to facilitate and  expedite the publication of this volume, that the Arabic characters  which in the original manuscript follow immediately certain words, or  appear between the lines or in the margin, should here be placed  together at the end, as an Index, with references to the pages wherein  they occur.]    [p.vii] The map prefixed to this volume might almost appear superfluous,  since the positions of Djidda, Mekka, Medina, Tayf, and Yembo, the chief  places of Hedjaz visited by Burckhardt, are indicated with accuracy in  the excellent maps that illustrate his Nubian and Syrian Travels. But as  the reader of this volume cannot reasonably be supposed to have  constantly at hand, for immediate reference, the two former portions of  our authors works, a map is here given, in the construction and  delineation of which Mr. Sydney Hall has attended to every suggestion  offered by the editor: at whose recommendation the names of places are  spelt after Burckhardts manner, however different from that more usual  among us. [Thus in the map as in the letter-press of this volume, Mekka  might have been spelt Mecca; and Hejaz, Jidda, Nejed, would as well  express the proper sounds of those words as Hedjaz, Djidda, Nedjed; and  at the same time approximate more closely to the original Arabic  orthography, by which our English j (as in Jar, James, &c.) is  represented without the assistance of a d; although the prefixing of  this letter to the j might prevent a Frenchman from pronouncing it as in  jour, jamais, &c.]    By the editors advice, also, several places situate beyond the Eastern  limits of Hedjaz are included in this map; since Burckhardt, although he  did not visit them himself, has given some original itineraries, in  which they are mentioned.    That those places do not belong to the region properly denominated  Hedjaz, is evident; but how far this region extends eastward cannot  easily be determined; and the same difficulty respecting it occurs in  various directions. The editor, that he might ascertain by what  boundaries we are justified in supposing Hedjaz to be separated from  other provinces of Arabia, consulted a multiplicity of authors, both  European and Oriental. The result, however, of his inquiry has not  proved satisfactory; for to each of the neighbouring countries.    [p.viii] certain writers have assigned towns, stations, and districts,  which by others of equal authority are placed in Hedjaz.    Such confusion may partly have arisen from the different statements of  the number, extent, and names of divisions comprised within the same  space; this being occupied, according to European writers, by three  great regions, the Stony, the Desert, and the Happy Arabia; while  Oriental geographers partition it into two, five, six, seven, or more  provinces, under denominations by no means corresponding in  signification to the epithets above mentioned, which we have borrowed  from the Greeks and Romans.    That it would be a most difficult, or scarcely possible task, to fix  precisely the limits of each Arabian province, is acknowledged by that  excellent geographer, DAnville; but he seems disposed to confound the  region comprising Mekka, Djidda, and Yembo, (places which, as we know,  are unequivocally in Hedjaz,) with Arabia Felix. [DAnville, Géographie  Ancienne.] DHerbelôt, in one place, declares Hedjaz to be Arabia  Petraea, [See the Bibliothèque Orientale in Hegiaz ou Higiaz--Nom  dune province de lArabie, que nous appelons Pierreuse, &c.--  Richardson also, in his Arabic and Persian Dictionary, explains Hijaz by  Mecca and the adjacent country, Arabia Petraea; and Demetrias  Alexandrides, who translated some portions of Abulfedas Geography into  Greek, (printed at Vienna, 1807, 8vo.) always renders Hedjaz by [Greek  text] and in another he identifies it with Arabia Deserta. [Les  Provinces de Tahama et dIemamah sont comme au coeur du pays; celle de  Hegiaz est devenue la plus célebre à cause des villes de la Mecque et de  Medine, et fait avec les deux dernières que nous avons nommées ce que  nous appelons lArabie Déserte.--Biblioth. Orient. in Arab.]]    Among the Eastern writers, some divide Arabia into two parts, Yemen and  Hedjaz; others into five great provinces, Yemen, Hedjaz, Nedjed, Tehama,  and Yemama. Bahrein has also been included;    [p.ix] and Aroudh is named as an Arabian province, but appears to be the  same as Yemama. Hadramaut, Mahrah, Shejr, Oman, and other subdivisions  have likewise been reckoned independent provinces by some, while many  confound them with the greater regions, Yemen and Hedjaz. To the latter,  indeed, are often assigned even the extensive countries of Nedjed,  Tehama, and Yemama.    Respecting the boundaries of all these provinces, much embarrassment has  arisen from contradictory statements made by several of the most eminent  Oriental geographers; Edrisi, Abulfeda, Al Madaieni, Ibn Haukal, Ibn el  Vardi, Bakoui, and others. Mr. Rommel, a very ingenious commentator on  Abulfedas Arabia, is frequently obliged to acknowledge the difficulty  of ascertaining where one division begins and another terminates. With  regard, more particularly, to the boundaries of Hedjaz, Abulfeda is  silent; but it appears that his opinion, so far as Mr. Rommel could  collect from incidental accounts of places assigned to this province and  adjoining territories, did not in all respects coincide with the  statements of other celebrated geographers. [See Christophori Rommel  Abulfedea Arabiae Descriptio, commentario perpetuo illustrata,  Gottingae, 1802, 4to. Ambitum et fines hujus provinciae Abulfeda  designare supersedet.--Al Madaieni haec profert: Hhegiaz est provincia  complectens illum tractum montium qui inde ab Yaman expansus usque ad  Sham (Syriam) protenditur. In eo tractu sitae sunt Madinah et Amman--  Cum hoc dissidere Abulfedam non dubium est.--Ibn al Arabi: Quod est  inter Tehamah et Nagd illud est Hhegiaz.--Fusius Ibn Haukal: Quod  protenditur a limite Serrain urbis sitae ad mare Kolzum adusque viciniam  Madian, et inde reflectendo per limitem tendentem in ortum urbis Hhegr,  ad montem Tai trunseundo juxta tergum Yamamah ad mare Persicum, hoc  totum ad Hhegiaz pertinet. Et alio loco: Hhegiaz ea est provincia,  quae Maccah et Madinah et Yamamah cum earundem territoriis  comprehendit.--Ibn al Vardi Hhegiaz appellat provinciam secus Sinum  Arabicum et a regione Habyssiniae sitam--Bakui eam inter Yaman et  Syriam posuisse satis habet, simul longitudinem ejus mensis itinere  emetiens.--(pp. 57-68.)]    [p.x] It may perhaps be asked, why our inquisitive traveller did not  learn from some intelligent native the precise extent and limits of  Hedjaz? To this question the following passage (written by Burckhardt,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9479"],[0,"The Boy Life of Napoleon, Afterwards Emperor of the French (#1)"],[1,"BOY LIFE OF NAPOLEON    Afterwards Emperor Of The French        _Adapted And Extended For American Boys And Girls From The French Of_    Madame Eugenie Foa    Author Of \"Little Princes And Princesses Young Warriors,\"    \"Little Robinson,\" Etc.        Illustrated By Vesper L George      1895          PREFACE.      The name of Madame Eugenie Foa has been a familiar one in French homes  for more than a generation. Forty years ago she was the most popular  writer of historical stories and sketches, especially designed for the  boys and girls of France. Her tone is pure, her morals are high, her  teachings are direct and effective. She has, besides, historical  accuracy and dramatic action; and her twenty books for children have  found welcome and entrance into the most exclusive of French homes. The  publishers of this American adaptation take pleasure in introducing  Madame Foa's work to American boys and girls, and in this Napoleonic  renaissance are particularly favored in being able to reproduce her  excellent story of the boy Napoleon.    The French original has been adapted and enlarged in the light of recent  research, and all possible sources have been drawn upon to make a  complete and rounded story of Napoleon's boyhood upon the basis  furnished by Madame Foa's sketch. If this glimpse of the boy Napoleon  shall lead young readers to the study of the later career of this  marvellous man, unbiased by partisanship, and swayed neither by hatred  nor hero worship, the publishers will feel that this presentation of the  opening chapters of his life will not have been in vain.

CHAPTER ONE.    IN NAPOLEON'S GROTTO.    On a certain August day, in the year 1776, two little girls were  strolling hand in hand along the pleasant promenade that leads from the  queer little town of Ajaccio out into the open country.    The town of Ajaccio is on the western side of the beautiful island of  Corsica, in the Mediterranean Sea. Back of it rise the great mountains,  white with snowy tops; below it sparkles the Mediterranean, bluest of  blue water. There are trees everywhere; there are flowers all about; the  air is fragrant with the odor of fruit and foliage; and it was through  this scented air, and amid these beautiful flowers, that these two  little girls were wandering idly, picking here and there to add to their  big bouquets, that August day so many years ago.    Every now and then the little girls would stop their flower-picking to  cool off; for, though the August sun was hot, the western breezes came  fresh across the wide Gulf of Ajaccio, down to whose shores ran broad  and beautiful avenues of chestnut-trees, through which one could catch a  glimpse, like a beautiful picture, of the little island of Sanguinarie,  three miles away from shore.    As they came out from the shadow of the chestnut-trees, one of the  little girls suddenly caught her companion's arm, and, pointing at an  opening in a pile of rocks that overlooked the sea, she said,--    \"Oh, what is this, Eliza?--an oven?\"    \"An oven, silly! Why, what do you mean?\" Eliza answered. \"Who would  build an oven here, tell me?\"    \"But it opens like an oven,\" her friend declared. \"See, it has a great  mouth, as if to swallow one. Perhaps some of the black elves live there,  that Nurse Camilla told us of. Do you think so, Eliza?\"    \"What a baby you are, Panoria!\" Eliza replied, with the superior air of  one who knows all about things. \"That is no oven; nor is it a black  elf's house. It is Napoleon's grotto.\"    \"Napoleon's!\" cried Panoria. \"And who gave it to him, then? Your great  uncle, the Canon Lucien?\"    \"No one gave it to him, child,\" Eliza replied. \"Napoleon found it in the  rocks, and teased Uncle Joey Fesch to fix it up for him. Uncle Joey did  so, and Napoleon comes here so often now that we call it Napoleon's  grotto.\"    \"Does he come here all alone?\" asked Panoria.    \"Alone? Of course,\" answered Eliza. \"Why should he not? He is big  enough.\"    \"No; I mean does he not let any of you come here with him?\"    \"That he will not!\" replied Eliza. \"Napoleon is such an odd boy! He will  have no one but Uncle Joey Fesch come into his grotto, and that is only  when he wishes Uncle Joey to teach him the primer. Brother Joseph tried  to come in here one day, and Napoleon beat him and bit him, until Joseph  was glad to run out, and has never since gone into the grotto.\"    \"What if we should go in there, Eliza?\" queried Panoria.    \"Oh, never think of it!\" cried Eliza. \"Napoleon would never forgive us,  and his nails are sharp.\"    \"And what does he do in his grotto?\" asked the inquisitive Panoria.    \"Oh, he talks to himself,\" Eliza replied.    \"My! but that is foolish,\" cried Panoria; \"and stupid too.\"    \"Then, so are you to say so,\" Eliza retorted. \"I tell you what is true.  My brother Napoleon comes here every day. He stays in his grotto for  hours. He talks to himself. I know what I am saying for I have come here  lots and lots of times just to listen. But I do not let him see me, or  he would drive me away.\"    \"Is he in there now?\" inquired Panoria with curiosity.    \"I suppose so; he always is,\" replied Eliza.    \"Let us hide and listen, then,\" suggested Panoria. \"I should like to  know what he can say when he talks to himself. Boys are bad enough,  anyway; but a boy who just talks to himself must be crazy.\"    Eliza was hardly ready to agree to her little friend's theory, so she  said, \"Wait here, Panoria, and I will go and peep into the grotto to see  if Napoleon is there.\"    \"Yes, do so,\" assented Panoria; \"and I will run down to that garden and  pick more flowers. See, there are many there.\"    \"Oh, no, you must not,\" Eliza objected; \"that is my uncle the Canon  Lucien's garden.\"    \"Well, and is your uncle the canon's garden more sacred than any one  else's garden?\" questioned Panoria flippantly.    \"What a goosie you are to ask that! Of course it is,\" declared Eliza.    \"But why?\" Panoria persisted.    \"Why?\" echoed Eliza; \"just because it is. It is the garden of my great  uncle the Canon Lucien; that is why.\"    \"It is, because it is! That is nothing,\" Panoria protested. \"If I could  not give a better reason\"--\"It is not my reason, Panoria,\" Eliza broke  in. \"It is Mamma Letitia's; therefore it must be right.\"    \"Well, I don't care,\" Panoria declared; \"even if it is your mamma's, it  is--but how is it your mamma's?\" she asked, changing protest to inquiry.    \"Why, we hear it whenever we do anything,\" replied Eliza. \"If they  wish to stop our play, they say, 'Stop! you will give your uncle the  headache.' If we handle anything we should not, they say, 'Hands off!  that belongs to your uncle the canon.' If we ask for a peach, they tell  us, 'No! it is from the garden of your uncle the canon.' If they give us  a hug or a kiss, when we have done well, they say, 'Oh, your uncle the  canon will be so pleased with you!' Was I not right? Is not our uncle  the canon beyond all others?\"    \"Yes; to worry one,\" declared Panoria rebelliously. \"But why? Is it  because he is canon of the cathedral here at Ajaccio that they are all  so afraid of him?\"    \"Afraid of him!\" exclaimed Eliza indignantly. \"Who is afraid of him? We  are not. But, you see, Papa Charles is not rich enough to do for us what  he would like. If he could but have the great estates in this island  which are his by right, he would be rich enough to do everything for us.  But some bad people have taken the land; and even though Papa Charles is  a count, he is not rich enough to send us all to school; so our uncle,  the Canon Lucien, teaches us many lessons. He is not cross, let me tell  you, Panoria; but he is--well, a little severe.\"    \"What, then, does he whip you?\" asked Panoria.    \"No, he does not; but if he says we should be whipped, then Mamma  Letitia hands us over to Nurse Mina Saveria; and she, I promise you,  does not let us off from the whipping.\"    All this Eliza admitted as if with vivid recollections of the vigor of  Nurse Saveria's arm.    Panoria glanced toward the grotto amid the rocks.    \"Does he--Napoleon--ever get whipped?\" she asked.    \"Indeed he does not,\" Eliza grumbled; \"or not as often as the rest of  us,\" she added. \"And when he is whipped he does not even cry. You should  hear Joseph, though. Joseph is the boy to cry; and so is Lucien. I'd be  ashamed to cry as they do. Why, if you touch those boys just with your  little finger, they go running to Mamma Letitia, crying that we've  scratched the skin off.\"    Panoria had her idea of such \"cry-babies\" of boys; but Napoleon  interested her most.    \"But, Eliza,\" she said, \"what does he say--Napoleon--when he talks to  himself in his grotto over there?\"    \"You shall hear,\" Eliza replied. \"Let me go and peep in, to see if he is  there. But no; hush! See, here he comes! Come; we will hide behind the  lilac-bush, and hear what Napoleon says.\"    \"But will not your nurse, Saveria, come to look for us?\" asked Panoria,"]]]
