In order  to get possession of these pests, a proclamation was issued, calling on  them by name to surrender themselves within 14 days, declaring them  outlaws if they refused, and requiring the inhabitants, as they valued  the peace and good order of the settlement, and their own security, to  assist in apprehending and bringing them to justice. The governor also  signified his determination, if any of the natives could be detected in  the act of robbing the settlers, to hang one of them in chains upon a  tree near the spot as a terror to the others. Could it have been  foreseen, that this was their natural temper, it would have been wiser to  have kept them at a distance, and in fear, which might have been effected  without so much of the severity which their conduct had sometimes  compelled him to exercise towards them. But the kindness which had been  shown them, and the familiar intercourse with the white people in which  they had been indulged, tended only to make them acquainted with those  concerns in which they were the most vulnerable, and brought on all the  evils which they suffered from them.    In the evening of the 16th, his Majesty's ship _Supply_ arrived from  the Cape of Good Hope; from which place she sailed about the middle of  last month, with a quantity of young cattle on board for the settlement.  She had met with much bad weather on her passage, and, being exceedingly  infirm, her pumps had been kept constantly at work. She landed 31 cows,  five mares, and 27 ewe sheep, all of them in good health, though much  weakened from the nature of their voyage: eight cows, two bulls, and 13  sheep had died.    During the night of this day, a boat which had been fishing at a small  distance to the southward of Botany Bay, brought up to the settlement  three persons, late belonging to a ship called the _Sydney Cove_,  which had sailed from Bengal with a cargo for this port upon  speculation. The governor was informed by Mr. Clarke, the supercargo  (one of the three who had arrived in the fishing boat), that the ship had  sprung a dangerous leak before she had rounded the South Cape, which, as  soon as they had got to the eastward of the southern part of the coast,  increased to so great a degree as to render it absolutely necessary to  haul in for the land. The wind being from the SE they were enabled to  accomplish this, and reached it exactly in time to land the ship, when  she was just dropping from under them, having actually sunk down to the  fore channels, when they ran her upon the ground, which they did on an  island in lat. 40 degrees 37 minutes south. They met with this misfortune  in the middle of last February; soon after which a certain number of them  resolved to attempt the reaching Port Jackson in the ship's long boat,  leaving the commander and about thirty people to stay by the wreck. The  boat being prepared, 17 people embarked in her, and sailed; but meeting  with much bad weather they were again wrecked, being driven on shore on  the coast near Point Hicks. Here they all landed, and endeavoured to  travel northward, but dropped off one by one and lost each other daily,  until the number was reduced to five, the three who had arrived (the  supercargo, a sailor, and a Lascar), the first mate of the ship, who had  undertaken the navigation of the long boat, and the carpenter. These two,  from excessive fatigue, had been unable to proceed any further, and had  stopped the day before their companions in this miserable journey had  been taken up by the fishing boat.    To look for these unfortunate people, a whale boat was dispatched the  following day, properly provided with such comforts as were necessary for  persons in their weak and wretched condition. The man who had met with  the supercargo was sent in the whale boat, and they proceeded to the spot  which Mr. Clarke had described as that where they had lost sight of their  companions; but, after a long search, they could only find some trifling  articles, which were known to have been in their possession; and, these  being bloody, it was conjectured that they had been killed in this very  helpless condition by the natives, whom, in the course of their long  march, they had found frequently very kind, and at other times extremely  savage. To add to the probability of this having been their end, Mr.  Clarke mentioned the morose, unfeeling disposition of the carpenter, who  often, when some friendly natives had presented him with a few fish,  growled that they had not given him all, and insisted, that because they  were black fellows, it would be right to take it by force. By some  illiberal and intemperate act of this nature, there was too much reason  to believe he had brought on himself, and his ill-fated companion, the  mate (a man cast in a gentler mould), a painful and premature death.    Mr. Clarke and the two other people who arrived with him were very much  exhausted, and could not probably have borne up much longer against the  toil that attends travelling in such a country as the unsettled part of  New Holland every where presents. All possible attention, however, being  paid to their situation, they quickly recovered their strength and  spirits.    In the account already published of this colony, several instances were  given of the danger and difficulty that attended travelling through the  woods, in which many people have either wandered till they died, or have  been assassinated by the natives. Every caution that humanity could  suggest had been given; yet even at this day an instance occurred that  proved to how little purpose. A soldier who had taken his passage in a  boat to go to the Hawkesbury prevailed on the crew to land him on the  south shore of Broken Bay, intending to proceed to the settlement by  land, but which he was never able to accomplish. Several parties of  soldiers were sent to look after their comrade, but all returned without  finding him. His end must have been truly deplorable; and not less so was  that of the sergeant-major's daughter, a fine girl of about 10 years of  age, who was burnt to death by a stubble field having taken fire while  she was in the midst of it. The flames were so rapid, that she was  totally unable to escape from them, and perished in this most  extraordinary and terrible manner.    In the evening of the 27th, the ship _Britannia_ anchored between  the heads from Ireland, having on board 150 male and 50 female convicts  from that kingdom, with an officer and 25 recruits for the New South  Wales corps. She got up to the settlement the following day, and the  prisoners were all landed on the 30th. A part of them were immediately  sent up to Parramatta.    On the same day the Colonial schooner, and a long-boat named the  _Eliza_, sailed to the southward, to bring away the remainder of the  ship's company belonging to the unfortunate _Sydney Cove_.    Among other works in which the people were employed in this month, was  the necessary one of erecting paling round the new gaol, now nearly  completed, and round the fresh water, the original enclosure of which had  gone to decay, by which means the stream was so exceedingly polluted, as  to endanger the health of the inhabitants. Some necessary regulations  were published to counteract this evil, and indeed they had long been  loudly called for.    The want of cordage has been already mentioned. The settlement was  likewise so much distressed for canvas, that, the largest and best boat  being in the Hawkesbury, it became necessary to dismantle another boat,  in order to furnish sails to bring her round, those belonging to her  having been split in some bad weather which she met with in her passage  thither. The people were directed at the same time to procure some of the  bark of the tree lately discovered, to be manufactured into cordage; for  which purpose it was reckoned superior to any of the flax that had been  brought from Norfolk island.    The _Mercury_ sailed about the middle of the month; and, as some  return for the liberty of refitting his ship, and remaining four months  in the Cove, the master took away a female convict without the governor's  permission.    Very little rain fell during this month.    June.] On the 2nd of June, the ship _Ganges_ arrived from Ireland,  with convicts from that kingdom, and a detachment of recruits for the New  South Wales corps. This ship had touched at the Cape of Good Hope, and  was commanded by Mr. Patrickson, who had visited the settlement in the  year 1792, in the _Philadelphia_, a small American brig. The  convicts in this ship were observed to be in much better health than  those on board of the _Britannia_. These people, indeed, complained  so much of having been treated with great severity during the passage,  that the governor thought it right to institute an enquiry into their  complaints. It appeared, that they had been deserving of punishment, but  that it had been administered with too much severity, in the opinion even  of the surgeon who was present. As these punishments had been inflicted  by the direction of the master, without consulting any of the officers on  board as to the measure of them, he was highly censured, as was the  surgeon, who could stand by and see them inflicted without remonstrating  with the master, which he declined because he had not been consulted by  him.       'Quis talia fando, temperet a lachrymis?'    His Majesty's birthday, falling this year on a Sunday, was observed on  the 5th, with all the honour that could be paid to it. The regiment was  drawn out on the parade, and at noon fired three volleys. At one o'clock  a royal salute was fired from the battery and the ships in the Cove; and  all the officers, civil and military, with those belonging to the ships,  spent the day at the government-house.    Shortly after this the governor visited the settlement at Parramatta, for  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1268"],[0,"The Mysterious Island (#10)"],[1,"up a few of these feathers, and after having examined  them,--    \"These are couroucous,\" said he.    \"I should prefer a moor-cock or guinea-fowl,\" replied Pencroft, \"still,  if they are good to eat--\"    \"They are good to eat, and also their flesh is very delicate,\" replied  Herbert. \"Besides, if I don't mistake, it is easy to approach and kill  them with a stick.\"    The sailor and the lad, creeping among the grass, arrived at the foot  of a tree, whose lower branches were covered with little birds. The  couroucous were waiting the passage of insects which served for their  nourishment. Their feathery feet could be seen clasping the slender  twigs which supported them.    The hunters then rose, and using their sticks like scythes, they mowed  down whole rows of these couroucous, who never thought of flying away,  and stupidly allowed themselves to be knocked off. A hundred were  already heaped on the ground, before the others made up their minds to  fly.    \"Well,\" said Pencroft, \"here is game, which is quite within the reach of  hunters like us. We have only to put out our hands and take it!\"    The sailor having strung the couroucous like larks on flexible twigs,  they then continued their exploration. The stream here made a bend  towards the south, but this detour was probably not prolonged for the  river must have its source in the mountain, and be supplied by the  melting of the snow which covered the sides of the central cone.    The particular object of their expedition was, as has been said, to  procure the greatest possible quantity of game for the inhabitants of  the Chimneys. It must be acknowledged that as yet this object had not  been attained. So the sailor actively pursued his researches, though he  exclaimed, when some animal which he had not even time to recognize  fled into the long grass, \"If only we had had the dog Top!\" But Top had  disappeared at the same time as his master, and had probably perished  with him.    Towards three o'clock new flocks of birds were seen through certain  trees, at whose aromatic berries they were pecking, those of the  juniper-tree among others. Suddenly a loud trumpet call resounded  through the forest. This strange and sonorous cry was produced by a game  bird called grouse in the United States. They soon saw several couples,  whose plumage was rich chestnut-brown mottled with dark brown, and tail  of the same color. Herbert recognized the males by the two wing-like  appendages raised on the neck. Pencroft determined to get hold of at  least one of these gallinaceae, which were as large as a fowl, and whose  flesh is better than that of a pullet. But it was difficult, for they  would not allow themselves to be approached. After several fruitless  attempts, which resulted in nothing but scaring the grouse, the sailor  said to the lad,--    \"Decidedly, since we can't kill them on the wing, we must try to take  them with a line.\"    \"Like a fish?\" cried Herbert, much surprised at the proposal.    \"Like a fish,\" replied the sailor quite seriously. Pencroft had found  among the grass half a dozen grouse nests, each having three or four  eggs. He took great care not to touch these nests, to which their  proprietors would not fail to return. It was around these that he  meant to stretch his lines, not snares, but real fishing-lines. He took  Herbert to some distance from the nests, and there prepared his singular  apparatus with all the care which a disciple of Izaak Walton would  have used. Herbert watched the work with great interest, though rather  doubting its success. The lines were made of fine creepers, fastened  one to the other, of the length of fifteen or twenty feet. Thick, strong  thorns, the points bent back (which were supplied from a dwarf acacia  bush) were fastened to the ends of the creepers, by way of hooks. Large  red worms, which were crawling on the ground, furnished bait.    This done, Pencroft, passing among the grass and concealing himself  skillfully, placed the end of his lines armed with hooks near the grouse  nests; then he returned, took the other ends and hid with Herbert behind  a large tree. There they both waited patiently; though, it must be  said, that Herbert did not reckon much on the success of the inventive  Pencroft.    A whole half-hour passed, but then, as the sailor had surmised, several  couple of grouse returned to their nests. They walked along, pecking the  ground, and not suspecting in any way the presence of the hunters,  who, besides, had taken care to place themselves to leeward of the  gallinaceae.    The lad felt at this moment highly interested. He held his breath, and  Pencroft, his eyes staring, his mouth open, his lips advanced, as if  about to taste a piece of grouse, scarcely breathed.    Meanwhile, the birds walked about the hooks, without taking any notice  of them. Pencroft then gave little tugs which moved the bait as if the  worms had been still alive.    The sailor undoubtedly felt much greater anxiety than does the  fisherman, for he does not see his prey coming through the water. The  jerks attracted the attention of the gallinaceae, and they attacked the  hooks with their beaks. Three voracious grouse swallowed at the same  moment bait and hook. Suddenly with a smart jerk, Pencroft \"struck\" his  line, and a flapping of wings showed that the birds were taken.    \"Hurrah!\" he cried, rushing towards the game, of which he made himself  master in an instant.    Herbert clapped his hands. It was the first time that he had ever seen  birds taken with a line, but the sailor modestly confessed that it was  not his first attempt, and that besides he could not claim the merit of  invention.    \"And at any rate,\" added he, \"situated as we are, we must hope to hit  upon many other contrivances.\"    The grouse were fastened by their claws, and Pencroft, delighted at not  having to appear before their companions with empty hands, and observing  that the day had begun to decline, judged it best to return to their  dwelling.    The direction was indicated by the river, whose course they had only  to follow, and, towards six o'clock, tired enough with their excursion,  Herbert and Pencroft arrived at the Chimneys.        Chapter 7    Gideon Spilett was standing motionless on the shore, his arms crossed,  gazing over the sea, the horizon of which was lost towards the east in  a thick black cloud which was spreading rapidly towards the zenith.  The wind was already strong, and increased with the decline of day.  The whole sky was of a threatening aspect, and the first symptoms of a  violent storm were clearly visible.    Herbert entered the Chimneys, and Pencroft went towards the reporter.  The latter, deeply absorbed, did not see him approach.    \"We are going to have a dirty night, Mr. Spilett!\" said the sailor:  \"Petrels delight in wind and rain.\"    The reporter, turning at the moment, saw Pencroft, and his first words  were,--    \"At what distance from the coast would you say the car was, when the  waves carried off our companion?\"    The sailor had not expected this question. He reflected an instant and  replied,--    \"Two cables lengths at the most.\"    \"But what is a cable's length?\" asked Gideon Spilett.    \"About a hundred and twenty fathoms, or six hundred feet.\"    \"Then,\" said the reporter, \"Cyrus Harding must have disappeared twelve  hundred feet at the most from the shore?\"    \"About that,\" replied Pencroft.    \"And his dog also?\"    \"Also.\"    \"What astonishes me,\" rejoined the reporter, \"while admitting that our  companion has perished, is that Top has also met his death, and that  neither the body of the dog nor of his master has been cast on the  shore!\"    \"It is not astonishing, with such a heavy sea,\" replied the sailor.  \"Besides, it is possible that currents have carried them farther down  the coast.\"    \"Then, it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves?\"  again asked the reporter.    \"That is my opinion.\"    \"My own opinion,\" said Gideon Spilett, \"with due deference to your  experience, Pencroft, is that in the double fact of the absolute  disappearance of Cyrus and Top, living or dead, there is something  unaccountable and unlikely.\"    \"I wish I could think like you, Mr. Spilett,\" replied Pencroft;  \"unhappily, my mind is made up on this point.\" Having said this, the  sailor returned to the Chimneys. A good fire crackled on the hearth.  Herbert had just thrown on an armful of dry wood, and the flame cast a  bright light into the darkest parts of the passage.    Pencroft immediately began to prepare the dinner. It appeared best to  introduce something solid into the bill of fare, for all needed to get  up their strength. The strings of couroucous were kept for the next day,  but they plucked a couple of grouse, which were soon spitted on a stick,  and roasting before a blazing fire.    At seven in the evening Neb had not returned. The prolonged absence of  the Negro made Pencroft very uneasy. It was to be feared that he had met  with an accident on this unknown land, or that the unhappy fellow had  been driven to some act of despair. But Herbert drew very different  conclusions from this absence. According to him, Neb's delay was caused  by some new circumstances which had induced him to prolong his search.  Also, everything new must be to the advantage of Cyrus Harding. Why had  Neb not returned unless hope still detained him? Perhaps he had found  some mark, a footstep, a trace which had put him in the right path.  Perhaps he was at this moment on a certain track. Perhaps even he was  near his master.    Thus the lad reasoned. Thus he spoke. His companions let him talk. The  reporter alone approved with a gesture. But what Pencroft thought most  probable was, that Neb had pushed his researches on the shore farther  than the day before, and that he had not as yet had time to return.    Herbert, however, agitated by vague presentiments, several times  manifested an"]]]
