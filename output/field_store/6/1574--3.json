In spite  of all assertions to the contrary, he foresaw in the war the end of  slavery. He perceived that by the enlistment of colored men not only  would the Northern arms be strengthened, but his people would win an  opportunity to exercise one of the highest rights of freemen, and by  valor on the field of battle to remove some of the stigma that slavery  had placed upon them. He strove through every channel at his command  to impress his views upon the country; and his efforts helped to  swell the current of opinion which found expression, after several  intermediate steps, in the enlistment of two colored regiments by  Governor Andrew, the famous war governor of Massachusetts, a State  foremost in all good works. When Mr. Lincoln had granted permission  for the recruiting of these regiments, Douglass issued through his  paper a stirring appeal, which was copied in the principal journals of  the Union States, exhorting his people to rally to this call, to seize  this opportunity to strike a blow at slavery and win the gratitude  of the country and the blessings of liberty for themselves and their  posterity.    Douglass exerted himself personally in procuring enlistments, his two  sons [his youngest and his oldest], Charles and Lewis, being [among]  the first in New York to enlist; for the two Massachusetts regiments  were recruited all over the North. Lewis H. Douglass, sergeant-major  in the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts, was among the foremost on the  ramparts at Fort Wagner. Both these sons of Douglass survived the war,  and are now well known and respected citizens of Washington, D.C. The  Fifty-fourth Massachusetts, under the gallant but ill-fated Colonel  Shaw, won undying glory in the conflict; and the heroic deeds of the  officers and men of this regiment are fittingly commemorated in the  noble monument by St. Gaudens, recently erected on Boston Common, to  stand as an inspiration of freedom and patriotism for the future and  as testimony that a race which for generations had been deprived of  arms and liberty could worthily bear the one and defend the other.    Douglass was instrumental in persuading the government to put colored  soldiers on an equal footing with white soldiers, both as to pay and  protection. In the course of these efforts he was invited to visit  President Lincoln. He describes this memorable interview in detail in  his _Life and Times_. The President welcomed him with outstretched  hands, put him at once at his ease, and listened patiently and  attentively to all that he had to say. Douglass maintained that  colored soldiers should receive the same pay as white soldiers, should  be protected and exchanged as prisoners, and should be rewarded, by  promotion, for deeds of valor. The President suggested some of the  difficulties to be overcome; but both he and Secretary of War Stanton,  whom Douglass also visited, assured him that in the end his race  should be justly treated. Stanton, before the close of the interview  with him, promised Douglass a commission as assistant adjutant  to General Lorenzo Thomas, then recruiting colored troops in the  Mississippi Valley. But Stanton evidently changed his mind, since the  commission, somewhat to Douglass's chagrin, never came to hand.    When McClellan had been relieved by Grant, and the new leader of the  Union forces was fighting the stubbornly contested campaign of the  Wilderness, President Lincoln again sent for Douglass, to confer with  him with reference to bringing slaves in the rebel States within the  Union lines, so that in the event of premature peace as many slaves  as possible might be free. Douglass undertook, at the President's  suggestion, to organize a band of colored scouts to go among the  negroes and induce them to enter the Union lines. The plan was never  carried out, owing to the rapid success of the Union arms; but the  interview greatly impressed Douglass with the sincerity of the  President's conviction against slavery and his desire to see the war  result in its overthrow. What the colored race may have owed to the  services, in such a quarter, of such an advocate as Douglass, brave,  eloquent, high-principled, and an example to Lincoln of what the  enslaved race was capable of, can only be imagined. That Lincoln was  deeply impressed by these interviews is a matter of history.    Douglass supported vigorously the nomination of Lincoln for a second  term, and was present at his [March 4] inauguration. And a few days  later, while the inspired words of the inaugural address, long  bracketed with the noblest of human utterances, were still ringing in  his ears, he spoke at the meeting held in Rochester to mourn the death  of the martyred President, and made one of his most eloquent and  moving addresses. It was a time that wrung men's hearts, and none more  than the strong-hearted man's whose race had found its liberty through  him who lay dead at Washington, slain by the hand of an assassin whom  slavery had spawned.          X.      With the fall of slavery and the emancipation of the colored race the  heroic epoch of Douglass's career may be said to have closed. The text  upon which he so long had preached had been expunged from the national  bible; and he had been a one-text preacher, a one-theme orator. He  felt the natural reaction which comes with relief from high mental or  physical tension, and wondered, somewhat sadly, what he should do with  himself, and how he should earn a living. The same considerations,  in varying measure, applied to others of the anti-slavery reformers.  Some, unable to escape the reforming habit, turned their attention  to different social evils, real or imaginary. Others, sufficiently  supplied with this worlds goods for their moderate wants, withdrew  from public life. Douglass was thinking of buying a farm and retiring  to rural solitudes, when a new career opened up for him in the lyceum  lecture field. The North was favorably disposed toward colored men.  They had acquitted themselves well during the war, and had  shown becoming gratitude to their deliverers. The once despised  abolitionists were now popular heroes. Douglass's checkered past  seemed all the more romantic in the light of the brighter present,  like a novel with a pleasant ending; and those who had hung  thrillingly upon his words when he denounced slavery now listened with  interest to what he had to say upon other topics. He spoke sometimes  on Woman Suffrage, of which he was always a consistent advocate.  His most popular lecture was one on \"Self-made Men.\" Another on  \"Ethnology,\" in which he sought a scientific basis for his claim for  the negro's equality with the white man, was not so popular--with  white people. The wave of enthusiasm which had swept the enfranchised  slaves into what seemed at that time the safe harbor of constitutional  right was not, after all, based on abstract doctrines of equality of  intellect, but on an inspiring sense of justice (long dormant under  the influence of slavery, but thoroughly awakened under the moral  stress of the war), which conceded to every man the right of a voice  in his own government and the right to an equal opportunity in life  to develop such powers as he possessed, however great or small these  might be.    But Douglass's work in direct behalf of his race was not yet entirely  done. In fact, he realized very distinctly the vast amount of work  that would be necessary to lift his people up to the level of their  enlarged opportunities; and, as may be gathered from some of his  published utterances, he foresaw that the process would be a long one,  and that their friends might weary sometimes of waiting, and that  there would be reactions toward slavery which would rob emancipation  of much of its value. It was the very imminence of such backward  steps, in the shape of various restrictive and oppressive laws  promptly enacted by the old slave States under President Johnson's  administration, that led Douglass to urge the enfranchisement of the  freedmen. He maintained that in a free country there could be no safe  or logical middle ground between the status of freeman and that of  serf. There has been much criticism because the negro, it is said,  acquired the ballot prematurely. There seemed imperative reasons,  besides that of political expediency, for putting the ballot in his  hands. Recent events have demonstrated that this necessity is as great  now as then. The assumption that negroes--under which generalization  are included all men of color, regardless of that sympathy to which  kinship at least should entitle many of them--are unfit to have a  voice in government is met by the words of Lincoln, which have all the  weight of a political axiom: \"No man can be safely trusted to govern  other men without their consent.\" The contention that a class  who constitute half the population of a State shall be entirely  unrepresented in its councils, because, forsooth, their will there  expressed may affect the government of another class of the same  general population, is as repugnant to justice and human rights as was  the institution of slavery itself. Such a condition of affairs has not  the melodramatic and soul-stirring incidents of chattel slavery, but  its effects can be as far-reaching and as debasing. There has been  some manifestation of its possible consequences in the recent  outbreaks of lynching and other race oppression in the South. The  practical disfranchisement of the colored people in several States,  and the apparent acquiescence by the Supreme Court in the attempted  annulment, by restrictive and oppressive laws, of the war amendments  to the Constitution, have brought a foretaste of what might be  expected should the spirit of the Dred Scott decision become again the  paramount law of the land.

Our idea is therefore \"inadequate.\"]          AFTERWORD.      [Sidenote: Spinoza's Apparent Failure.]    [Sidenote: Power of Ecclesiasticism.]    [Sidenote: Identification of Moral Interests with Conventional Beliefs.]    Notwithstanding the admiration, and even reverence, with, which Spinoza  was regarded by a few scholars during his life-time, it cannot be said  that during the century following his death, in 1677, there was any wide  acceptance of his ideas. The times were not favourable. For the  political and social power of ecclesiasticism, whether established, or  unestablished, compelled men of science and philosophers to treat  dominant creeds as consecrated ground, on which ordinary methods of  research, reasoning or criticism could not be pursued. In saying this, I  am far from accusing those illustrious men of insincerity. Some few of  them, indeed, used a sort of cryptic satire to excuse to themselves an  unwilling conformity. But, for the most part, the moral pressure of  tradition and education compelled enlightened men to identify the  doctrines of a personal God, Creation, Fall, Redemption and Immortality  with moral interests vitally essential to human welfare. Under such  circumstances a prudent conservatism was inevitable.    [Sidenote: Gradual Spread of Spinoza's Influence.]    [Sidenote: Fichte.]    [Sidenote: Hegel.]    Yet, notwithstanding these restraining influences, the thoughts breathed  forth by the lonely thinker were as living seed wafted abroad, and  falling here and there on good ground, germinated and brought forth  fruit. Sometimes his influence was acknowledged, sometimes it was  repudiated; but it was there, nevertheless. It is doubtful whether  Fichte's idealism could have taken the form it did had not Spinoza  preceded him. Hegel, setting out on his great intellectual career with a  resolve to defend the faith once delivered to the saints, yet traces its  roots to a philosophy of Being which, at any rate, looks very like  Pantheism. This is perhaps delicate ground to tread. For if one is asked  whether one understands Hegel, one is tempted to answer, like the pious  Scotch lady when her friends enquired whether she had understood the  minister's sermon, \"Hech, sirs, d'ye think I'd presume?\" Still, not my  own reading of him only, but Mr. Haldane's profoundly interesting  interpretations given in his _Gifford Lectures_, make the impression  that Hegel's eternal process is always a projection of subject as object  and re-integration of the two. And this goes on, not only on the  infinite, but on the finite scale, amidst the infinite number of  processes which constitute the Whole of Being. But this seems to leave  no room for creation out of nothing, and it is to that extent  pantheistic. There are doubtless saving interpretations, but it is  difficult to follow them; and they cannot cancel the initial postulate  of one eternal process, consisting in the relations of infinite subject,  object and reunion. On such a system I do not see how there can be  anything but God, and, therefore, notwithstanding his aversion to the  name, count Hegel a Pantheist.    [Sidenote: Goethe and Wordsworth.]    Goethe and Wordsworth, in many inspired passages of their poetry, echo  the faith of Spinoza. Wordsworth, of course, in the reaction from his  first expectations of the new order that he hoped to see arise out of  the French Revolution, was Inclined to magnify the Importance of  established religious ceremonies and creeds. But we cannot suppose that  he ever repented of his reverence for Nature as a divine revelation. And  we may believe that he continued to regard his practically pantheistic  visions as an insight into the eternal reality from which the detailed  schemes of orthodox theology were projected.    [Sidenote: Schleiermacher.]    That Schleiermacher was much indebted to Spinoza is abundantly evident  from his own words. He spoke of \"the holy repudiated Spinoza.\" He  declared that \"the high world-spirit penetrated him; the Infinite was  his beginning and his end; the universe his only and eternal love. In  holy innocence and lowliness, he mirrored himself in the eternal world,  and saw himself as its most love-worthy image. He was full of religion  and of the Holy Spirit; and therefore he stands alone and unreachable,  master in his art above the profane multitude, without disciples and  without citizenship.\"[22]    [Sidenote: Anglican Broad Churchmen.]    Coming down to Anglican Broad Churchmen, it would scarcely be fair to  quote isolated utterances as proofs of their Pantheism. And yet when  Frederick Robertson asked, \"What is this world itself but the form of  Deity whereby the manifoldness and beauty of His mind manifests itself?\"  and still farther, when he quotes with approval Channing's word, that  \"perhaps matter is but a mode of thought,\" the most earnest Pantheist  would hardly desire more. For the conception of the Universe involved  must surely exclude the real being, or even the real existence, of  anything but God. Matthew Arnold never committed himself to Pantheism,  nor, indeed, to any other theory of the Universe. For his delicate  humour and lambent satire always had in view simply the practical object  of clearing a plain way for the good life through the \"Aberglaube\" of  theology. His description of God as \"the Power not ourselves which makes  for righteousness,\" might seem, in fact, the negation of Pantheism,  because, if God is not ourselves, there is something other than God. But  the man who deliberately justified the loose phraseology of the Bible  about infinite Being, by the plea that it was language \"thrown out\" at  an object infinitely transcending linguistic expression, ought not  himself to be pinned to the implications logically deducible from his  own words \"thrown out\" at the same transcendant object. And, though  Matthew Arnold was too literary to be a Pantheist, that is, though he  thought more of forms of expression than of ultimate reality, his  satirical disintegration of the creeds, wherever it is effective, makes  Pantheism the only religious alternative. So-called \"secular\" and  godless alternatives may be offered; but their incongruity with the  whole evolution of humanity from prehistoric animism to the higher  Pantheism will make their doom short and sure.    [Sidenote: Why Pantheism as a Religion was called Modern.]    In the earlier part of this essay I made the remark that Pantheism as a  religion is almost entirely modern. The context, however, clearly showed  what was meant; for several pages have been occupied with indications of  the ideas and teaching of individual Pantheists from Xenophanes to  Spinoza. But we do not usually take much note of a religion that is  confined to one or two men in an age. If it dies out we treat it merely  as a curiosity, or an intellectual puzzle, like the dreams of Jacob  Boehme, or the atheistic ecclesiasticism of Comte. But, if it  afterwards shows symptoms of unexpected adaptation to the mental and  moral conditions of a newer world, and if, on account of this  adaptation, it gains a hold on men who are neither philosophers nor  metaphysicians, but only religious, it demands our consideration on far  other grounds than those of intellectual curiosity.    [Sidenote: Pantheistic Tendencies of Contemporary Thought]    Now it has only been during the second half of the last century that  Pantheism has been able to claim attention as a religion in such a sense  as this. As to the fact there can hardly be any dispute. For not only  has it become ever a more prominent motive in the music of the poets,  and not only are all rationalizations of Christianity more or less  transparent disguises of Pantheism, but I may safely appeal to those  ordinary members of intelligent society who are neither poets, nor  divines, nor philosophers, whether the freest and most confidential  interchange of religious thought does not continually verge on a faith  which merges everything in God.    [Sidenote: Caused by the Mutual Pressure of Science and Faith.]    [Sidenote: The Nebular Hypothesis taken alone Involves Absurdity.]    Nor are the reasons of this tendency far to seek. Indeed, they are  palpable and conspicuous in the mutual pressure of science and faith.  For, on the one hand science has made unthinkable the old-world  conception of a three-storeyed Universe, constructed by an artificer  God, who suddenly awoke from an eternity of idleness to make Heaven,  Earth, and Hell--a conception involving a King of kings, enthroned like  an eastern monarch, and sending forth His ministering spirits, or  appointing His angel deputies to direct and govern at His beck. Or if it  be said that never, except in the ages of primeval simplicity, or  amongst later generations living under primeval conditions? has such a  conception been entertained, it would be difficult for the \"broadest\"  Churchman to say what has been, put in its place. It is vain to remind  us how later Christianity has patronised nebular hypotheses and the  doctrine of evolution. For these give no definite substitute whatever  for the old story, that Elohim \"spoke, and it was done--he commanded,  and it stood fast.\" Whence the fiery mists by the rotation and cooling  of which the worlds were slowly evolved? We are told that the same  process is going on now within the ken of astronomers. But does any one  suppose that in those realms of space God is evoking something out of  nothing, or saying \"be,\" and \"there is\"? No; we are assured that these  fiery mists are formed by the collision of misguided orbs; and we are  even asked--or, at least we _were_ asked--to believe that this process  must go on until all systems are agglomerated in one orb, to be  ultimately congealed into stone.
