Sometimes, by timely  concessions, it succeeded in averting civil hostilities; but in general  it stood firm, and called for help on the nation. The nation obeyed  the call, rallied round the sovereign, and enabled him to quell the  disaffected minority.    Thus, from the age of Henry the Third to the age of Elizabeth, England  grew and flourished under a polity which contained the germ of our  present institutions, and which, though not very exactly defined, or  very exactly observed, was yet effectually prevented from degenerating  into despotism, by the awe in which the governors stood of the spirit  and strength of the governed.    But such a polity is suited only to a particular stage in the progress  of society. The same causes which produce a division of labour in the  peaceful arts must at length make war a distinct science and a distinct  trade. A time arrives when the use of arms begins to occupy the entire  attention of a separate class. It soon appears that peasants and  burghers, however brave, are unable to stand their ground against  veteran soldiers, whose whole life is a preparation for the day of  battle, whose nerves have been braced by long familiarity with danger,  and whose movements have all the precision of clockwork. It is found  that the defence of nations can no longer be safely entrusted to  warriors taken from the plough or the loom for a campaign of forty  days. If any state forms a great regular army, the bordering states  must imitate the example, or must submit to a foreign yoke. But, where  a great regular army exists, limited monarchy, such as it was in the  middle ages, can exist no longer. The sovereign is at once emancipated  from what had been the chief restraint on his power; and he inevitably  becomes absolute, unless he is subjected to checks such as would be  superfluous in a society where all are soldiers occasionally, and none  permanently.    With the danger came also the means of escape. In the monarchies of the  middle ages the power of the sword belonged to the prince; but the power  of the purse belonged to the nation; and the progress of civilisation,  as it made the sword of the prince more and more formidable to the  nation, made the purse of the nation more and more necessary to the  prince. His hereditary revenues would no longer suffice, even for the  expenses of civil government. It was utterly impossible that, without  a regular and extensive system of taxation, he could keep in constant  efficiency a great body of disciplined troops. The policy which the  parliamentary assemblies of Europe ought to have adopted was to take  their stand firmly on their constitutional right to give or withhold  money, and resolutely to refuse funds for the support of armies, till  ample securities had been provided against despotism.    This wise policy was followed in our country alone. In the neighbouring  kingdoms great military establishments were formed; no new safeguards  for public liberty were devised; and the consequence was, that the old  parliamentary institutions everywhere ceased to exist. In France, where  they had always been feeble, they languished, and at length died of  mere weakness. In Spain, where they had been as strong as in any part  of Europe, they struggled fiercely for life, but struggled too late. The  mechanics of Toledo and Valladolid vainly defended the privileges of the  Castilian Cortes against the veteran battalions of Charles the Fifth. As  vainly, in the next generation, did the citizens of Saragossa stand up  against Philip the Second, for the old constitution of Aragon. One after  another, the great national councils of the continental monarchies,  councils once scarcely less proud and powerful than those which sate  at Westminster, sank into utter insignificance. If they met, they met  merely as our Convocation now meets, to go through some venerable forms.    In England events took a different course. This singular felicity she  owed chiefly to her insular situation. Before the end of the fifteenth  century great military establishments were indispensable to the dignity,  and even to the safety, of the French and Castilian monarchies. If  either of those two powers had disarmed, it would soon have been  compelled to submit to the dictation of the other. But England,  protected by the sea against invasion, and rarely engaged in warlike  operations on the Continent, was not, as yet, under the necessity  of employing regular troops. The sixteenth century, the seventeenth  century, found her still without a standing army. At the commencement  of the seventeenth century political science had made considerable  progress. The fate of the Spanish Cortes and of the French States  General had given solemn warning to our Parliaments; and our  Parliaments, fully aware of the nature and magnitude of the danger,  adopted, in good time, a system of tactics which, after a contest  protracted through three generations, was at length successful.    Almost every writer who has treated of that contest has been desirous to  show that his own party was the party which was struggling to preserve  the old constitution unaltered. The truth however is that the old  constitution could not be preserved unaltered. A law, beyond the control  of human wisdom, had decreed that there should no longer be governments  of that peculiar class which, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,  had been common throughout Europe. The question, therefore, was not  whether our polity should undergo a change, but what the nature of  the change should be. The introduction of a new and mighty force had  disturbed the old equilibrium, and had turned one limited monarchy after  another into an absolute monarchy. What had happened elsewhere would  assuredly have happened here, unless the balance had been redressed by  a great transfer of power from the crown to the parliament. Our princes  were about to have at their command means of coercion such as no  Plantagenet or Tudor had ever possessed. They must inevitably have  become despots, unless they had been, at the same time, placed under  restraints to which no Plantagenet or Tudor had ever been subject.    It seems certain, therefore, that, had none but political causes been  at work, the seventeenth century would not have passed away without  a fierce conflict between our Kings and their Parliaments. But other  causes of perhaps greater potency contributed to produce the same  effect. While the government of the Tudors was in its highest vigour  an event took place which has coloured the destinies of all Christian  nations, and in an especial manner the destinies of England. Twice  during the middle ages the mind of Europe had risen up against the  domination of Rome. The first insurrection broke out in the south of  France. The energy of Innocent the Third, the zeal of the young orders  of Francis and Dominic, and the ferocity of the Crusaders whom the  priesthood let loose on an unwarlike population, crushed the Albigensian  churches. The second reformation had its origin in England, and spread  to Bohemia. The Council of Constance, by removing some ecclesiastical  disorders which had given scandal to Christendom, and the princes  of Europe, by unsparingly using fire and sword against the heretics,  succeeded in arresting and turning back the movement. Nor is this  much to be lamented. The sympathies of a Protestant, it is true, will  naturally be on the side of the Albigensians and of the Lollards. Yet an  enlightened and temperate Protestant will perhaps be disposed to doubt  whether the success, either of the Albigensians or of the Lollards,  would, on the whole, have promoted the happiness and virtue of mankind.  Corrupt as the Church of Rome was, there is reason to believe that, if  that Church had been overthrown in the twelfth or even in the fourteenth  century, the vacant space would have been occupied by some system more  corrupt still. There was then, through the greater part of Europe, very  little knowledge; and that little was confined to the clergy. Not one  man in five hundred could have spelled his way through a psalm. Books  were few and costly. The art of printing was unknown. Copies of the  Bible, inferior in beauty and clearness to those which every cottager  may now command, sold for prices which many priests could not afford  to give. It was obviously impossible that the laity should search the  Scriptures for themselves. It is probable therefore, that, as soon as  they had put off one spiritual yoke, they would have put on another,  and that the power lately exercised by the clergy of the Church of  Rome would have passed to a far worse class of teachers. The sixteenth  century was comparatively a time of light. Yet even in the sixteenth  century a considerable number of those who quitted the old religion  followed the first confident and plausible guide who offered himself,  and were soon led into errors far more serious than those which they had  renounced. Thus Matthias and Kniperdoling, apostles of lust, robbery,  and murder, were able for a time to rule great cities. In a darker age  such false prophets might have founded empires; and Christianity might  have been distorted into a cruel and licentious superstition, more  noxious, not only than Popery, but even than Islamism.    About a hundred years after the rising of the Council of Constance, that  great change emphatically called the Reformation began. The fulness  of time was now come. The clergy were no longer the sole or the chief  depositories of knowledge The invention of printing had furnished the  assailants of the Church with a mighty weapon which had been wanting  to their predecessors. The study of the ancient writers, the rapid  development of the powers of the modern languages, the unprecedented  activity which was displayed in every department of literature, the  political state of Europe,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1470"],[0,"The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan (#10)"],[1,"resolved that  Najib himself should visit the Vazir, and lay before him the  cause which he so well understood, and in which his own interest  was so deep. The envoy proceeded towards Audh, and found the  Vazir encamped upon the Ganges at Mahdi Ghat. He lost no time in  opening the matter; and, with the good sense that always  characterized him, Najib touched at once the potent spring of  self. Shia or Sunni, all Moslems were alike the object of  Mahratta enmity. He, Najib, knew full well what to expect, should  the Hindu league prevail. But would the Vazir fare better?  \"Though, after all, the will of God will be done, it behoves us  not the less to help destiny to be beneficent by our own best  endeavours. Think carefully, consult Her Highness, your mother: I  am not fond of trouble, and should not have come all this  distance to see your Excellency were I not deeply interested.\"  Such, as we learn from an adherent of Shujaa's, was the substance  of the advice given him by the Rohilla chieftain.    The nature of these negotiations is not left to conjecture. The  narrative of what occurred is supplied by Kasi Raj Pandit, a  Hindu writer in the service of the Nawab Vazir, and an  eye-witness of the whole campaign. He was present in both camps,  having been employed in the negotiations which took place between  the Mahrattas and Mohamadans; and his account of the battle (of  which a translation appeared in the Asiatic Researches for 1791,  reprinted in London in 1799) is at once the most authentic that  has come down to our times, and the best description of war ever  recorded by a Hindu.    Shujaa-ud-daulah, after anxious deliberation, resolved to adopt  the advice of his Rohilla visitor. And, having so resolved, he  adhered honestly to his resolution. He sent his family to  Lucknow, and accompanied Najib to Anupshahr, where he was warmly  received by the Daurani Shah, and his minister Shah Wali Khan.    Shortly after, the united forces of the Moslems moved down to  Shahdara, the hunting-ground of the emperors, near Dehli, from  which, indeed, it was only separated by the river Jamna. But, the  monsoon having set in, the encounter of the hostile armies was  for the present impossible. The interval was occupied in  negotiation. The Bhao first attempted the virtue of Shujaa, whom  he tempted with large offers to desert the Sunni cause. Shujaa  amused him with messages in which our Pandit acted as go-between;  but all was conducted with the knowledge of Najib, who was fully  consulted by the Nawab Vazir throughout. The Shah's minister,  also, was aware of the transaction, and apparently disposed to  grant terms to the Hindus. Advantage was taken of the  opportunity, and of the old alliance between Shujaa and the Jats,  to shake the confidence of Suraj Mal, and persuade him to abandon  the league, which he very willingly did when his advice was so  haughtily rejected. It was the opinion of our Pandit, that a  partition of the country might even now have been effected had  either party been earnest in desiring peace. He did not evidently  know what were the Bhao's real feelings, but probably judged him  by the rest of his conduct, which was that of a bold, ambitious  statesman. From what he saw in the other camp, he may well have  concluded that Najib had some far-seeing scheme on foot, which  kept him from sincerely forwarding the proposed treaty. Certainly  that astute Rohilla was ultimately the greatest gainer from the  anxieties and sufferings of the campaign. But the first act of  hostility came from the Bhao, who moved up stream to turn the  invader's flank.    About eighty miles north of Dehli, on the meadowlands lying  between the Western Jamna Canal and the river (from whose right  bank it is about two miles distant), stands the small town of  Kunjpura. In the invasion of Nadir Shah, it had been occupied by  a force of Persian sharpshooters, who had inflicted much loss on  the Moghul army from its cover. Induced, perhaps, by the  remembrance of those days, Ahmad had made the mistake of placing  in it a garrison of his own people, from which he was now  separated by the broad stream of the Jamna, brimming with  autumnal floods. Here the Bhao struck his first blow, taking the  whole Afghan garrison prisoners after an obstinate defence, and  giving up the place to plunder, while the main Afghan army sat  idle on the other side.    At length arrived the Dasahra, the anniversary of the attack of  Lanka by the demigod Ram, a proverbial and almost sacred day of  omen for the commencement of Hindu military expeditions. Ahmad  adopted the auspices of his enemy and reviewed his troops the day  before the festival. The state of his forces is positively given  by the Pandit, as consisting of 28,000 Afghans, powerful men,  mounted on hardy Turkoman horses, forty pieces of cannon, besides  light guns mounted on camels; with some 28,000 horse, 38,000  foot, and about forty guns, under the Hindustani Musalmans. The  Mahrattas had more cavalry, fewer foot, and an artillery of 200  guns; in addition to which they were aided, if aid it could be  called in regular warfare, by clouds of predatory horsemen,  making up their whole force to over 200,000, mostly, as it turned  out, food for the sabre and the gun.    On the 17th of October, 1760, the Afghan host and its allies  broke up from Shahdara; and between the 23rd and 25th effected a  crossing at Baghpat, a small town about twenty-four miles up the  river. The position of the hostile armies was thus reversed; that  of the northern invaders being nearer Dehli, with the whole of  Hindustan at their backs, while the Southern defenders of their  country were in the attitude of men marching down from the  north-west with nothing behind them but the dry and war-wasted  plains of Sirhind. In the afternoon of the 26th, Ahmad's advanced  guard reached Sambalka, about half-way between Sonpat and  Panipat, where they encountered the vanguard of the Mahrattas. A  sharp conflict ensued, in which the Afghans lost a thousand men,  killed and wounded, but drove back the Mahrattas on their main  body, which kept on retreating slowly for several days,  contesting every inch of the ground until they reached Panipat.  Here the camp was finally pitched in and about the town, and the  position was at once covered by digging a trench sixty feet wide  and twelve deep, with a rampart on which the guns were mounted.  The Shah took up ground four miles to the south, protecting his  position by abattis of felled timber, according to his usual  practice, but pitching in front a small unprotected tent from  which to make his own observations.    The small reverse of the Mahrattas at Sambalka was soon followed  by others, and hopes of a pacific solution became more and more  faint. Gobind Pant Bundela, foraging near Meerut with 10,000  light cavalry, was surprised and slain by Atai Khan at the head  of a similar party of Afghans. The terror caused by this affair  paralysed the Bhao's commissariat, while it greatly facilitated  the foraging of the Shah. Shortly after, a party of 2,000  Mahratta horsemen, each carrying a keg of specie from Dehli, fell  upon the Afghan pickets, which they mistook for their own in the  dark of night. On their answering in their own language to the  sentry's challenge, they were surrounded and cut up by the enemy,  and something like Â£200,000 in silver was lost to the Bhao.  Ibrahim and his disciplined mercenaries now became very clamorous  for their arrears of pay, on which Holkar proposed that the  cavalry should make an immediate attack without them. The Bhao  ironically acquiesced, and turned the tables upon Holkar, who  probably meant nothing less than to lead so hare-brained a  movement.    During the next two months constant skirmishes and duels took  place between parties and individual champions upon either side.  In one of these Najib lost 3,000 of his Rohillas, and was very  near perishing himself; and the chiefs of the Indian Musalmans  became at last very urgent with the Shah to put an end to their  suspense by bringing on a decisive action. But the Shah, with the  patience of a great leader, as steadily repressed their ardour,  knowing very well that (to use the words of a modern leader on a  similar occasion) the enemy were all the while \"stewing in their  own-gravy.\" For this is one of the sure marks of a conqueror,  that he makes of his own troubles a measure of his antagonist's  misfortunes; so that they become a ground, not of losing heart,  but of gaining courage.    Meanwhile the vigilance of his patrol, for which service he had  5,000 of his best cavalry employed through the long winter  nights, created almost a blockade of the Mahrattas. On one  occasion 20,000 of their camp-followers, who had gone to collect  provisions, were massacred in a wood near the camps by this  vigilant force.    The Bhao's spirit sank under these repeated blows and warnings,  and he sent to the Nawab Vazir, Shujaa-ud-daulah, to offer to  accept any conditions that might still be obtainable. All the  other chiefs were willing, and the Shah referred them to the  Rohillas. But Najib proved implacable. The Pandit went to the  Rohilla leader, and urged on him every possible consideration  that might persuade him to agree. But his clear good sense  perceived the nature of the crisis. \"I would do much,\" he said,  \"to gratify, the Nawab and show my respect for his Excellency.  But oaths are not chains; they are only words, things that will  never bind the enemy when once he has escaped from the dangers  which compel him to undertake them. By one effort we can get this  thorn out of our sides.\"    Proceeding to the Shah's tent he obtained instant admission,  though it was now midnight. Here he repeated his arguments;  adding that whatever his Majesty's decision might be was  personally immaterial to himself. \"For I,\" he concluded, \"am but  a soldier of fortune, and can make terms"]]]
