They did not begin in the morning and end at night, but were  continued for many weeks, and sometimes by casualties for a quarter of  the year. They were not limited to the precincts of a solitary ship, but  were spread among many vessels; and these were so constantly passing,  that the ocean itself never ceased to be a witness of their existence.    And it must strike us, finally, that the misery and crimes, included in  the evil as it has been found in foreign lands, were not confined within  the shores of a little island. Most of the islands of a continent, and  many of these of considerable population and extent, were filled with  them. And the continent itself, to which these geographically belong,  was widely polluted by their domain. Hence, if we were to take the vast  extent of space occupied by these crimes and sufferings from the heart  of Africa to its shores, and that which they filled on the continent of  America and the islands adjacent, and were to join the crimes and  sufferings in one to those in the other, by the crimes and sufferings  which took place in the track of the vessels successively crossing the  Atlantic, we should behold a vast belt as it were of physical and moral  evil, reaching through land and ocean to the length of nearly half the  circle of the globe.    The next view which I shall take of this evil will be as it relates to  the difficulty of subduing it.    This difficulty may be supposed to have been more than ordinarily great.  Many evils of a public nature, which existed in former times, were the  offspring of ignorance and superstition, and they were subdued of course  by the progress of light and knowledge. But the evil in question began  in avarice. It was nursed also by worldly interest. It did not therefore  so easily yield to the usual correctives of disorders in the world. We  may observe also, that the interest by which it was thus supported, was  not that of a few individuals, nor of one body, but of many bodies of  men. It was interwoven again into the system of the commerce and of the  revenue of nations. Hence the merchant--the planter--the mortgagee--the  manufacturer--the politician--the legislator--the  cabinet-minister--lifted up their voices against the annihilation of it.  For these reasons, the Slave Trade may be considered like the fabulous  hydra, to have a hundred heads, every one of which it was necessary to  cut off before it could be subdued. And as none but Hercules was fitted  to conquer the one, so nothing less than extraordinary prudence,  courage, labour, and patience, could overcome the other. To protection  in this manner by his hundred interests, it was owing, that the monster  stalked in security for so long a time. He stalked too in the open day,  committing his mighty depredations. And when good men, whose duty it was  to mark him as the object of their destruction, began to assail him, he  did not fly, but gnashed his teeth at them, growling savagely at the  same time, and putting himself into a posture of defiance.    We see then, in whatever light we consider the Slave Trade, whether we  examine into the nature of it, or whether we look into the extent of it,  or whether we estimate the difficulty of subduing it, we must conclude  that no evil more monstrous has ever existed upon earth. But if so, then  we have proved the truth of the position, that the abolition of it ought  to be accounted by us as one of the greatest blessings, and that it  ought to be one of the most copious sources of our joy. Indeed, I do not  know, how we can sufficiently express what we ought to feel upon this  occasion. It becomes us, as individuals, to rejoice. It becomes us, as a  nation, to rejoice. It becomes us even to perpetuate our joy to our  posterity. I do not mean, however, by anniversaries, which are to be  celebrated by the ringing of bells and convivial meetings, but by  handing down this great event so impressively to our children, as to  raise in them, if not continual, yet frequently renewed thanksgivings,  to the great Creator of the universe, for the manifestation of this his  favour, in having disposed our legislators to take away such a portion  of suffering from our fellow-creatures, and such a load of guilt from  our native land.    And as the contemplation of the removal of this monstrous evil should  excite in us the most pleasing and grateful sensations, so the perusal  of the history of it should afford us lessons, which it must be useful  to us to know or to be reminded of. For it cannot be otherwise than  useful to us to know the means which have been used, and the different  persons who have moved in so great a cause. It cannot be otherwise than  useful to us to be impressively reminded of the simple axiom which the  perusal of this history will particularly suggest to us, that \"the  greatest works must have a beginning;\" because the fostering of such an  idea in our minds cannot but encourage us to undertake the removal of  evils, however vast they may appear in their size, or however difficult  to overcome. It cannot, again, be otherwise than useful to us to be  assured, (and this history will assure us of it,) that in any work,  which is a work of righteousness, however small the beginning may be, or  however small the progress may be that we may make in it, we ought never  to despair; for that, whatever checks and discouragements we may meet  with, \"no virtuous effort is ever ultimately lost.\" And finally, it  cannot be otherwise than useful to us, to form the opinion, which the  contemplation of this subject must always produce, namely, that many of  the evils which are still left among us, may, by an union of wise and  virtuous individuals, be greatly alleviated, if not entirely done away;  for if the great evil of the Slave Trade, so deeply entrenched by its  hundred interests, has fallen prostrate before the efforts of those who  attacked it, what evil of a less magnitude shall not be more easily  subdued? O may reflections of this sort always enliven us, always  encourage us, always stimulate us to our duty! May we never cease to  believe, that many of the miseries of life are still to be remedied, or  to rejoice that we may be permitted, if we will only make ourselves  worthy by our endeavours, to heal them! May we encourage for this  purpose every generous sympathy that arises in our hearts, as the  offspring of the Divine influence for our good, convinced that we are  not born for ourselves alone, and that the Divinity never so fully  dwells in us, as when we do his will, and that we never do his will more  agreeably, as far as it has been revealed to us, than when we employ our  time in works of charity towards the rest of our fellow-creatures!          CHAPTER II.    As it is desirable to know the true sources of events in history, so  this will be realized in that of the abolition of the Slave  Trade.--Inquiry as to those who favoured the cause of the Africans  previously to the year 1787.--All these to be considered as necessary  forerunners in that cause.--First forerunners were Cardinal Ximenes;  the Emperor Charles the Fifth; Pope Leo the Tenth; Elizabeth, queen of  England; Louis the Thirteenth, of France.      It would be considered by many, who have stood at the mouth of a river,  and witnessed its torrent there, to be both an interesting and a  pleasing journey to go to the fountain head, and then to travel on its  banks downwards, and to mark the different streams in each side, which  should run into it and feed it. So I presume the reader will not be a  little interested and entertained, in viewing with me the course of the  abolition of the Slave Trade, in first finding its source, and then in  tracing the different springs which have contributed to its increase.  And here I may observe that, in doing this, we shall have advantages,  which historians have not always had in developing the causes of things.  Many have handed down to us, events, for the production of which they  have given us but their own conjectures. There has been often, indeed,  such a distance between the events themselves, and the lives of those  who have recorded them, that the different means and motives belonging  to them have been lost through time. On the present occasion, however,  we shall have the peculiar satisfaction of knowing, that we communicate  the truth, or that those which we unfold, are the true causes and means;  for the most remote of all the human springs, which can be traced as  having any bearing upon the great event in question, will fall within  the period of three centuries, and the most powerful of them within the  last twenty years. These circumstances indeed have had their share in  inducing me to engage in the present history. Had I measured it by the  importance of the subject, I had been deterred; but believing that most  readers love the truth, and that it ought to be the object of all  writers to promote it, and believing, moreover, that I was in possession  of more facts on this subject than any other person, I thought I was  peculiarly called to undertake it.    In tracing the different streams from whence the torrent arose, which  has now happily swept away the Slave Trade, I must begin with an inquiry  as to those who favoured the cause of the injured Africans, from the  year 1516, to the year 1787, at which latter period, a number of persons  associated themselves, in England, for its abolition. For though they,  who belonged to this association, may, in consequence of having pursued  a regular system, be called the principal actors, yet it must be  acknowledged, that their efforts would never have been so effectual, if  the minds of men had not been prepared by others, who had moved before  them. Great events have never taken place without previously disposing  causes. So it is in the case before us. Hence they, who lived even in  early times, and favoured this great cause, may be said to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10635"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 2 (#10)"],[1," through Egypt, and came to the mountains  of Barca, where he overtook an old grey-headed palmer.    Prasildo told the palmer the reason of his coming, and the palmer told  him what the reader has heard about the garden; adding, that he must  enter by the gate of Poverty, and take no arms or armour with him,  excepting a looking-glass for a shield, in which the fairy might behold  her beauty. The old man gave him other directions necessary for his  passing out of the gate of Riches; and Prasildo, thanking him, went on,  and in thirty days found himself entering the garden with the greatest  ease, by the gate of Poverty.    The garden looked like a Paradise, it was so full of beautiful trees, and  flowers, and fresh grass. Prasildo took care to hold the shield over his  eyes, that he might avoid seeing the fairy Medusa; and in this manner,  guarding his approach, he arrived at the Golden Tree. The fairy, who was  reclining against the trunk of it, looked up, and saw herself in the  glass. Wonderful was the effect on her. Instead of her own white-and-red  blooming face, she beheld that of a dreadful serpent. The spectacle made  her take to flight in terror; and the lover, finding his object so far  gained, looked freely at the tree, and climbed it, and bore away a  bough[2].    With this he proceeded to the gate of Riches. It was all of loadstone,  and opened with a great noise. But he passed through it happily, for he  made the fairy who kept it a present of half the bough; and so he issued  forth out of the garden, with indescribable joy.    Behold our loving adventurer now on his road home. Every step of the way  appeared to him a thousand. He took the road of Nubia to shorten the  journey; crossed the Arabian Gulf with a breeze in his favour; and  travelling by night as well as by day, arrived one fine morning in  Babylon.    No sooner was he there, than he sent to tell the object of his passion  how fortunate he had been. He begged her to name her own place and time  for receiving the bough at his hands, taking care to remind her of her  promise; and he could not help adding, that he should die if she broke it.    Terrible was the grief of Tisbina at this unlooked-for news. She threw  herself on her couch in despair, and bewailed the hour she was born.  \"What on earth am I to do?\" cried the wretched lady; \"death itself is no  remedy for a case like this, since it is only another mode of breaking my  word. To think that Prasildo should return from the garden of Medusa! who  could have supposed it possible? And yet, in truth, what a fool I was to  suppose any thing impossible to love! O my husband! little didst thou  think what thou thyself advisedst me to promise!\"    The husband was coming that moment towards the room; and overhearing his  wife grieving in this distracted manner, he entered and clasped her in  his arms. On learning the cause of her affliction, he felt as though he  should have died with her on the spot.    \"Alas!\" cried he, \"that it should be possible for me to be miserable  while I am so dear to your heart. But you know, O my soul! that when love  and jealousy come together, the torment is the greatest in the world.  Myself--myself, alas! caused the mischief, and myself alone ought to  suffer for it. You must keep your promise. You must abide by the word you  have given, especially to one who has undergone so much to perform what  you asked him. Sweet face, you must. But oh! see him not till after I am  dead. Let Fortune do with me what she pleases, so that I be saved from a  disgrace like that. It will be a comfort to me in death to think that  I alone, while I was on earth, enjoyed the fond looking of that lovely  face. Nay,\" concluded the wretched husband, \"I feel as though I should  die over again, if I could call to mind in my grave how you were taken  from me.\"    Iroldo became dumb for anguish. It seemed to him as if his very heart had  been taken out of his breast. Nor was Tisbina less miserable. She was as  pale as death, and could hardly speak to him, or bear to look at him. At  length turning her eyes upon him, she said, \"And do you believe I could  make my poor sorry case out in this world without Iroldo? Can he bear,  himself, to think of leaving his Tisbina? he who has so often said, that  if he possessed heaven itself, he should not think it heaven without her?  O dearest husband, there is a way to make death not bitter to either of  us. It is to die together. I must only exist long enough to see Prasildo!  Death, alas! is in that thought; but the same death will release us. It  need not even be a hard death, saving our misery. There are poisons so  gentle in their deadliness, that we need but faint away into sleep, and  so, in the course of a few hours, be delivered. Our misery and our folly  will then alike be ended.\"    Iroldo assenting, clasped his wife in distraction; and for a long time  they remained in the same posture, half stifled with grief, and bathing  one another's cheeks with their tears. Afterwards they sent quietly for  the poison; and the apothecary made up a preparation in a cup, without  asking any questions; and so the husband and wife took it. Iroldo drank  first, and then endeavoured to give the cup to his wife, uttering not a  word, and trembling in every limb; not because he was afraid of death,  but because he could not bear to ask her to share it. At length, turning  away his face and looking down, he held the cup towards her, and she took  it with a chilled heart and trembling hand, and drank the remainder to  the dregs. Iroldo then covered his face and head, not daring to see her  depart for the house of Prasildo; and Tisbina, with pangs bitterer than  death, left him in solitude.    Tisbina, accompanied by a servant, went to Prasildo, who could scarcely  believe his ears when he heard that she was at the door requesting to  speak with him. He hastened down to shew her all honour, leading her  from the door into a room by themselves; and when he found her in tears,  addressed her in the most considerate and subdued, yet still not unhappy  manner, taking her confusion for bashfulness, and never dreaming what a  tragedy had been meditated.    Finding at length that her grief was not to be done away, he conjured  her by what she held dearest on earth to let him know the cause of it;  adding, that he could still die for her sake, if his death would do her  any service. Tisbina spoke at these words; and Prasildo then heard what  he did not wish to hear. \"I am in your hands,\" answered she, \"while I  am yet alive. I am bound to my word, but I cannot survive the dishonour  which it costs me, nor, above all, the loss of the husband of my heart.  You also, to whose eyes I have been so welcome, must be prepared for my  disappearance from the earth. Had my affections not belonged to another,  ungentle would have been my heart not to have loved yourself, who are so  capable of loving; but (as you must well know) to love two at once is  neither fitting nor in one's power. It was for that reason I never loved  you, baron; I was only touched with compassion for you; and hence the  miseries of us all. Before this day closes, I shall have learnt the taste  of death.\" And without further preface she disclosed to him how she and  her husband had taken poison.    Prasildo was struck dumb with horror. He had thought his felicity at  hand, and was at the same instant to behold it gone for ever. She who was  rooted in his heart, she who carried his life in her sweet looks, even  she was sitting there before him, already, so to speak, dead.    \"It has pleased neither Heaven nor you, Tisbina,\" exclaimed the unhappy  young man, \"to put my best feelings to the proof. Often have two lovers  perished for love; the world will now behold a sacrifice of three. Oh,  why did you not make a request to me in your turn, and ask me to free you  from your promise? You say you took pity on me! Alas, cruel one, confess  that you have killed yourself, in order to kill me. Yet why? Never did I  think of giving you displeasure; and I now do what I would have done at  any time to prevent it, I absolve you from your oath. Stay, or go this  instant, as it seems best to you.\"    A stronger feeling than compassion moved the heart of Tisbina at these  words. \"This indeed,\" replied she, \"I feel to be noble; and truly could  I also now die to save you. But life is flitting; and how may I prove my  regard?\"    Prasildo, who had in good earnest resolved that three instead of two  should perish, experienced such anguish at the extraordinary position in  which he found all three, that even her sweet words came but dimly to his  ears. He stood like a man stupified; then begged of her to give him but  one kiss, and so took his leave without further ado, only intimating that  her way out of the house lay before her. As he spake, he removed himself  from her sight.    Tisbina reached home. She found her husband with his head covered up as  she left him; but when she recounted what had passed, and the courtesy of  Prasildo, and how he had exacted from her but a single kiss, Iroldo got  up, and removed the covering from his face, and then clasping his hands,  and raising it to heaven, he knelt with grateful humility, and prayed God  to give pardon to himself, and reward to his neighbour. But before he had  ended, Tisbina sunk on the floor in a swoon. Her weaker frame was the  first to undergo the effects of what she had taken. Iroldo felt icy chill  to see her, albeit she seemed to sleep sweetly. Her aspect was not at all  like death. He taxed Heaven with cruelty for treating two loving hearts  so hardly, and cried out against Fortune, and life, and Love itself.    Nor was Prasildo happier in his chamber. He also exclaimed against the  bitter tyrant \"whom men call Love;\" and protested, that he would gladly  encounter any fate, to be delivered from the worse evils of his false and  cruel ascendency.
