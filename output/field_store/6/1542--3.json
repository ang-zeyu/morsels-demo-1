Shrive thyself, thou vile knave, for I mean that thou  shalt hang this day, and that where three roads meet, so that all men  shall see thee hang, for carrion crows and daws to peck at.\"    \"O thou dastard heart!\" cried Will Stutely, gnashing his teeth at the  Sheriff.  \"Thou coward hind!  If ever my good master meet thee thou  shalt pay dearly for this day's work! He doth scorn thee, and so do all  brave hearts.  Knowest thou not that thou and thy name are jests upon  the lips of every brave yeoman?  Such a one as thou art, thou wretched  craven, will never be able to subdue bold Robin Hood.\"    \"Ha!\" cried the Sheriff in a rage, \"is it even so? Am I a jest with thy  master, as thou callest him? Now I will make a jest of thee and a sorry  jest withal, for I will quarter thee limb from limb, after thou art  hanged.\" Then he spurred his horse forward and said no more to Stutely.    At last they came to the great town gate, through which Stutely saw the  fair country beyond, with hills and dales all clothed in verdure, and  far away the dusky line of Sherwood's skirts. Then when he saw the  slanting sunlight lying on field and fallow, shining redly here and  there on cot and farmhouse, and when he heard the sweet birds singing  their vespers, and the sheep bleating upon the hillside, and beheld the  swallows flying in the bright air, there came a great fullness to his  heart so that all things blurred to his sight through salt tears, and he  bowed his head lest the folk should think him unmanly when they saw the  tears in his eyes. Thus he kept his head bowed till they had passed  through the gate and were outside the walls of the town.  But when he  looked up again he felt his heart leap within him and then stand still  for pure joy, for he saw the face of one of his own dear companions of  merry Sherwood; then glancing quickly around he saw well-known faces  upon all sides of him, crowding closely upon the men-at-arms who were  guarding him.  Then of a sudden the blood sprang to his cheeks, for he  saw for a moment his own good master in the press and, seeing him, knew  that Robin Hood and all his band were there. Yet betwixt him and them  was a line of men-at-arms.    \"Now, stand back!\" cried the Sheriff in a mighty voice, for the crowd  pressed around on all sides.  \"What mean ye, varlets, that ye push upon  us so? Stand back, I say!\"    Then came a bustle and a noise, and one strove to push between the men-  at-arms so as to reach the cart, and Stutely saw that it was Little John  that made all that stir.    \"Now stand thou back!\" cried one of the men-at-arms whom Little John  pushed with his elbows.    \"Now stand thou back thine own self,\" quoth Little John, and straightway  smote the man a buffet beside his head that felled him as a butcher  fells an ox, and then he leaped to the cart where Stutely sat.    \"I pray thee take leave of thy friends ere thou diest, Will,\" quoth he,  \"or maybe I will die with thee if thou must die, for I could never have  better company.\"  Then with one stroke he cut the bonds that bound the  other's arms and legs, and Stutely leaped straightway from the cart.    \"Now as I live,\" cried the Sheriff, \"yon varlet I know right well is a  sturdy rebel!  Take him, I bid you all, and let him not go!\"    So saying, he spurred his horse upon Little John, and rising in his  stirrups smote with might and main, but Little John ducked quickly  underneath the horse's belly and the blow whistled harmlessly over his  head.    \"Nay, good Sir Sheriff,\" cried he, leaping up again when the blow had  passed, \"I must e'en borrow thy most worshipful sword.\" Thereupon he  twitched the weapon deftly from out the Sheriff's hand, \"Here, Stutely,\"  he cried, \"the Sheriff hath lent thee his sword! Back to back with me,  man, and defend thyself, for help is nigh!\"    \"Down with them!\" bellowed the Sheriff in a voice like an angry bull;  and he spurred his horse upon the two who now stood back to back,  forgetting in his rage that he had no weapon with which to defend  himself.    \"Stand back, Sheriff!\" cried Little John; and even as he spoke, a bugle  horn sounded shrilly and a clothyard shaft whistled within an inch of  the Sheriff's head.  Then came a swaying hither and thither, and oaths,  cries, and groans, and clashing of steel, and swords flashed in the  setting sun, and a score of arrows whistled through the air. And some  cried, \"Help, help!\" and some, \"A rescue, a rescue!\"    \"Treason!\" cried the Sheriff in a loud voice.  \"Bear back! Bear back!  Else we be all dead men!\"  Thereupon he reined his horse backward  through the thickest of the crowd.    Now Robin Hood and his band might have slain half of the Sheriff's men  had they desired to do so, but they let them push out of the press and  get them gone, only sending a bunch of arrows after them to hurry them  in their flight.    \"Oh stay!\" shouted Will Stutely after the Sheriff.  \"Thou wilt never  catch bold Robin Hood if thou dost not stand to meet him face to face.\"  But the Sheriff, bowing along his horse's back, made no answer but only  spurred the faster.    Then Will Stutely turned to Little John and looked him in the face till  the tears ran down from his eyes and he wept aloud; and kissing his  friend's cheeks, \"O Little John!\" quoth he, \"mine own true friend, and  he that I love better than man or woman in all the world beside! Little  did I reckon to see thy face this day, or to meet thee this side  Paradise.\"  Little John could make no answer, but wept also.    Then Robin Hood gathered his band together in a close rank, with Will  Stutely in the midst, and thus they moved slowly away toward Sherwood,  and were gone, as a storm cloud moves away from the spot where a tempest  has swept the land. But they left ten of the Sheriff's men lying along  the ground wounded--some more, some less--yet no one knew who smote them  down.    Thus the Sheriff of Nottingham tried thrice to take Robin Hood and  failed each time; and the last time he was frightened, for he felt how  near he had come to losing his life; so he said, \"These men fear neither  God nor man, nor king nor king's officers. I would sooner lose mine  office than my life, so I will trouble them no more.\"  So he kept close  within his castle for many a day and dared not show his face outside of  his own household, and all the time he was gloomy and would speak to no  one, for he was ashamed of what had happened that day.          Robin Hood Turns Butcher    NOW AFTER all these things had happened, and it became known to Robin  Hood how the Sheriff had tried three times to make him captive, he said  to himself, \"If I have the chance, I will make our worshipful Sheriff  pay right well for that which he hath done to me.  Maybe I may bring him  some time into Sherwood Forest and have him to a right merry feast with  us.\" For when Robin Hood caught a baron or a squire, or a fat abbot or  bishop, he brought them to the greenwood tree and feasted them before he  lightened their purses.    But in the meantime Robin Hood and his band lived quietly in Sherwood  Forest, without showing their faces abroad, for Robin knew that it would  not be wise for him to be seen in the neighborhood of Nottingham, those  in authority being very wroth with him.  But though they did not go  abroad, they lived a merry life within the woodlands, spending the days  in shooting at garlands hung upon a willow wand at the end of the glade,  the leafy aisles ringing with merry jests and laughter: for whoever  missed the garland was given a sound buffet, which, if delivered by  Little John, never failed to topple over the unfortunate yeoman. Then  they had bouts of wrestling and of cudgel play, so that every day they  gained in skill and strength.    Thus they dwelled for nearly a year, and in that time Robin Hood often  turned over in his mind many means of making an even score with the  Sheriff.  At last he began to fret at his confinement; so one day he  took up his stout cudgel and set forth to seek adventure, strolling  blithely along until he came to the edge of Sherwood.  There, as he  rambled along the sunlit road, he met a lusty young butcher driving a  fine mare and riding in a stout new cart, all hung about with meat.  Merrily whistled the Butcher as he jogged along, for he was going to the  market, and the day was fresh and sweet, making his heart blithe within  him.    \"Good morrow to thee, jolly fellow,\" quoth Robin, \"thou seemest happy  this merry morn.\"    \"Ay, that am I,\" quoth the jolly Butcher, \"and why should I not be so?  Am I not hale in wind and limb?  Have I not the bonniest lass in all  Nottinghamshire?  And lastly, am I not to be married to her on Thursday  next in sweet Locksley Town?\"    \"Ha,\" said Robin, \"comest thou from Locksley Town?  Well do I know that  fair place for miles about, and well do I know each hedgerow and gentle  pebbly stream, and even all the bright little fishes therein, for there  I was born and bred.  Now, where goest thou with thy meat, my fair  friend?\"    \"I go to the market at Nottingham Town to sell my beef and my mutton,\"  answered the Butcher.  \"But who art thou that comest from Locksley  Town?\"    \"A yeoman am I, and men do call me Robin Hood.\"    \"Now, by Our Lady's grace,\" cried the Butcher, \"well do I know thy name,  and many a time have I heard thy deeds both sung and spoken of. But  Heaven forbid that thou shouldst take aught of me! An honest man am I,  and have wronged neither man nor maid; so trouble me not, good master,  as I have never troubled thee.\"    \"Nay, Heaven forbid, indeed,\" quoth Robin, \"that I should take from such  as thee, jolly fellow!  Not so much as one farthing would I take from  thee, for I love a fair Saxon face like thine right well--more  especially when it cometh from Locksley Town, and most especially when  the man that owneth it is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1015"],[0,"The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life (#10)"],[1,"my  admiration of the work.    \"Yes, yes; a pretty good thing. Macaulay can do better than that though.  I know him very well. I have traveled with him. Where was it we first  met--at Damascus? No, no; it was in Italy.\"    \"So,\" said I, \"you have been over the same ground with your countryman,  the author of 'Eothen'? There has been some discussion in America as to  who he is. I have heard Milne's name mentioned.\"    \"Milne's? Oh, no, no, no; not at all. It was Kinglake; Kinglake's the  man. I know him very well; that is, I have seen him.\"    Here Jack C., who stood by, interposed a remark (a thing not common with  him), observing that he thought the weather would become fair before  twelve o'clock.    \"It's going to rain all day,\" said R., \"and clear up in the middle of  the night.\"    Just then the clouds began to dissipate in a very unequivocal manner;  but Jack, not caring to defend his point against so authoritative a  declaration, walked away whistling, and we resumed our conversation.    \"Borrow, the author of 'The Bible in Spain,' I presume you know him  too?\"    \"Oh, certainly; I know all those men. By the way, they told me that one  of your American writers, Judge Story, had died lately. I edited some of  his works in London; not without faults, though.\"    Here followed an erudite commentary on certain points of law, in which  he particularly animadverted on the errors into which he considered that  the judge had been betrayed. At length, having touched successively  on an infinite variety of topics, I found that I had the happiness  of discovering a man equally competent to enlighten me upon them all,  equally an authority on matters of science or literature, philosophy or  fashion. The part I bore in the conversation was by no means a prominent  one; it was only necessary to set him going, and when he had run long  enough upon one topic, to divert him to another and lead him on to pour  out his heaps of treasure in succession.    \"What has that fellow been saying to you?\" said Shaw, as I returned to  the tent. \"I have heard nothing but his talking for the last half-hour.\"    R. had none of the peculiar traits of the ordinary \"British snob\";  his absurdities were all his own, belonging to no particular nation or  clime. He was possessed with an active devil that had driven him over  land and sea, to no great purpose, as it seemed; for although he had the  usual complement of eyes and ears, the avenues between these organs and  his brain appeared remarkably narrow and untrodden. His energy was much  more conspicuous than his wisdom; but his predominant characteristic was  a magnanimous ambition to exercise on all occasions an awful rule and  supremacy, and this propensity equally displayed itself, as the reader  will have observed, whether the matter in question was the baking of a  hoe-cake or a point of international law. When such diverse elements  as he and the easy-tempered captain came in contact, no wonder some  commotion ensued; R. rode roughshod, from morning till night, over his  military ally.    At noon the sky was clear and we set out, trailing through mud and slime  six inches deep. That night we were spared the customary infliction of  the shower bath.    On the next afternoon we were moving slowly along, not far from a patch  of woods which lay on the right. Jack C. rode a little in advance;      The livelong day he had not spoke;      when suddenly he faced about, pointed to the woods, and roared out to  his brother:    \"O Bill! here's a cow!\"    The captain instantly galloped forward, and he and Jack made a vain  attempt to capture the prize; but the cow, with a well-grounded distrust  of their intentions, took refuge among the trees. R. joined them, and  they soon drove her out. We watched their evolutions as they galloped  around here, trying in vain to noose her with their trail-ropes, which  they had converted into lariettes for the occasion. At length they  resorted to milder measures, and the cow was driven along with the  party. Soon after the usual thunderstorm came up, the wind blowing with  such fury that the streams of rain flew almost horizontally along the  prairie, roaring like a cataract. The horses turned tail to the storm,  and stood hanging their heads, bearing the infliction with an air of  meekness and resignation; while we drew our heads between our shoulders,  and crouched forward, so as to make our backs serve as a pent-house  for the rest of our persons. Meanwhile the cow, taking advantage of the  tumult, ran off, to the great discomfiture of the captain, who seemed to  consider her as his own especial prize, since she had been discovered by  Jack. In defiance of the storm, he pulled his cap tight over his brows,  jerked a huge buffalo pistol from his holster, and set out at full speed  after her. This was the last we saw of them for some time, the mist and  rain making an impenetrable veil; but at length we heard the captain's  shout, and saw him looming through the tempest, the picture of a  Hibernian cavalier, with his cocked pistol held aloft for safety's sake,  and a countenance of anxiety and excitement. The cow trotted before him,  but exhibited evident signs of an intention to run off again, and the  captain was roaring to us to head her. But the rain had got in behind  our coat collars, and was traveling over our necks in numerous little  streamlets, and being afraid to move our heads, for fear of admitting  more, we sat stiff and immovable, looking at the captain askance, and  laughing at his frantic movements. At last the cow made a sudden plunge  and ran off; the captain grasped his pistol firmly, spurred his horse,  and galloped after, with evident designs of mischief. In a moment we  heard the faint report, deadened by the rain, and then the conqueror  and his victim reappeared, the latter shot through the body, and quite  helpless. Not long after the storm moderated and we advanced again. The  cow walked painfully along under the charge of Jack, to whom the captain  had committed her, while he himself rode forward in his old capacity  of vedette. We were approaching a long line of trees, that followed  a stream stretching across our path, far in front, when we beheld the  vedette galloping toward us, apparently much excited, but with a broad  grin on his face.    \"Let that cow drop behind!\" he shouted to us; \"here's her owners!\" And  in fact, as we approached the line of trees, a large white object, like  a tent, was visible behind them. On approaching, however, we found,  instead of the expected Mormon camp, nothing but the lonely prairie, and  a large white rock standing by the path. The cow therefore resumed her  place in our procession. She walked on until we encamped, when R. firmly  approaching with his enormous English double-barreled rifle, calmly and  deliberately took aim at her heart, and discharged into it first one  bullet and then the other. She was then butchered on the most approved  principles of woodcraft, and furnished a very welcome item to our  somewhat limited bill of fare.    In a day or two more we reached the river called the \"Big Blue.\" By  titles equally elegant, almost all the streams of this region are  designated. We had struggled through ditches and little brooks all that  morning; but on traversing the dense woods that lined the banks of the  Blue, we found more formidable difficulties awaited us, for the stream,  swollen by the rains, was wide, deep, and rapid.    No sooner were we on the spot than R. had flung off his clothes, and was  swimming across, or splashing through the shallows, with the end of a  rope between his teeth. We all looked on in admiration, wondering what  might be the design of this energetic preparation; but soon we heard him  shouting: \"Give that rope a turn round that stump! You, Sorel: do you  hear? Look sharp now, Boisverd! Come over to this side, some of you, and  help me!\" The men to whom these orders were directed paid not the  least attention to them, though they were poured out without pause  or intermission. Henry Chatillon directed the work, and it proceeded  quietly and rapidly. R.'s sharp brattling voice might have been  heard incessantly; and he was leaping about with the utmost activity,  multiplying himself, after the manner of great commanders, as if his  universal presence and supervision were of the last necessity. His  commands were rather amusingly inconsistent; for when he saw that the  men would not do as he told them, he wisely accommodated himself  to circumstances, and with the utmost vehemence ordered them to do  precisely that which they were at the time engaged upon, no doubt  recollecting the story of Mahomet and the refractory mountain.  Shaw smiled significantly; R. observed it, and, approaching with a  countenance of lofty indignation, began to vapor a little, but was  instantly reduced to silence.    The raft was at length complete. We piled our goods upon it, with  the exception of our guns, which each man chose to retain in his own  keeping. Sorel, Boisverd, Wright and Delorier took their stations at  the four corners, to hold it together, and swim across with it; and in  a moment more, all our earthly possessions were floating on the turbid  waters of the Big Blue. We sat on the bank, anxiously watching the  result, until we saw the raft safe landed in a little cove far down on  the opposite bank. The empty wagons were easily passed across; and then  each man mounting a horse, we rode through the stream, the stray animals  following of their own accord.        CHAPTER VI    THE PLATTE AND THE DESERT      We were now arrived at the close of our solitary journeyings along the  St. Joseph's trail. On the evening of the 23d of May we encamped near  its junction with the old legitimate trail of the Oregon emigrants. We  had ridden long that afternoon, trying in vain to find wood and water,  until at length we saw the sunset sky reflected from a"]]]
