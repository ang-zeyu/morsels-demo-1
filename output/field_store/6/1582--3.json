Here we meet with a further Christian influence, which, when once  accepted, very largely contributed to secure a similar development of  mediaeval Christian and Muhammedan thought. This was Scholasticism,  which was the natural and inevitable consequence of the study of Greek  dialectic and philosophy. It is not necessary to sketch the growth of  scholasticism, with its barrenness of results in spite of its keen  intellectual power, upon ground already fertilised by ecclesiastical  pioneers. It will suffice to state the fact that these developments of  the Greek spirit were predominant here as in the West: in either case  important philosophies rise upon this basis, for the most part  professedly ecclesiastical, even when they occasionally struck at the  roots of the religious system to which they belonged. In this  department, Islam repaid part of its debt to Christianity, for the  Arabs became the intellectual leaders of the middle ages.    Thus we come to the concluding section of this treatise; before we  enter upon it, two preliminary questions remain for consideration. If  Islam was ready to learn from Christianity in every department of  religious life, what was the cause of the sudden superiority of  Muhammedanism to the rising force of Christianity a few centuries  later? And secondly, in view of the traditional antagonism between the  Christian and Muhammedan worlds, how was Christianity able to adopt so  large and essential a portion of Muhammedan thought?    The answer in the second case will be clear to any one who has  followed our argument with attention. The intellectual and religious  outlook was so similar in both religions and the problem requiring  solution so far identical that nothing existed to impede the adoption  of ideas originally Christian which had been developed in the East.  The fact that the West could accept philosophical and theological  ideas from Islam and that an actual interchange of thought could  proceed in this direction, is the best of proofs for the soundness of  our argument that the roots of Muhammedanism are to be sought in  Christianity. Islam was able to borrow from Christianity for the  reason that Muhammed's ideas were derived from that source: similarly  Christianity was able to turn Arab thought to its own purposes because  that thought was founded upon Christian principles. The sources of  both religions lie in the East and in Oriental thought.    No less is true of Judaism, a scholastic system which was excellently  adapted by its international character, to become a medium of  communication between Christianity and Muhammedanism during those  centuries. In this connection special mention must be made of the  Spanish Jews; to their work, not only as transmitting but also as  originating ideas a bare reference must here suffice. But of greater  importance was the direct exchange of thought, which proceeded through  literary channels, by means of translations, especially by word of  mouth among the Christians and Muhammedans who were living together in  Southern Italy, Sicily, and Spain, and by commercial intercourse.    The other question concerns the fundamental problem of European  medievalism. We see that the problems with which the middle ages in  Europe were confronted and also that European ethics and metaphysics  were identical with the Muhammedan system: we are moreover assured  that the acceptance of Christian ideas by Islam can only have taken  place in the East: and the conclusion is obvious that mediaeval  Christianity was also primarily rooted in the East. The transmission  of this religious philosophy to the non-Oriental peoples of the West  at first produced a cessation of progress but opened a new  intellectual world when these peoples awoke to life in the thirteenth  and fourteenth centuries. But throughout the intermediate period  between the seventh and thirteenth centuries the East was gaining  political strength and was naturally superior to the West where  political organisation and culture had been shattered by the Germanic  invasions; in the East again there was an organic unity of national  strength and intellectual ideals, as the course of development had not  been interrupted. Though special dogmatic points had been changed, the  general religious theory remained unaltered throughout the nearer  East. Thus the rising power of Islam, which had high faculties of  self-accommodation to environment, was able to enter upon the heritage  of the mixed Graeco-Oriental civilisation existing in the East; in  consequence it gained an immediate advantage over the West, where  Eastern ideas were acclimatised with difficulty.    The preponderance of Muhammedan influence was increased by the fact  that Islam became the point of amalgamation for ancient Eastern  cultures, in particular for those of Greece and Persia: in previous  centuries preparation had been made for this process by the steady  transformation of Hellenism to Orientalism. Persia, however, had been  the main source of Eastern civilisation, at any rate since the  Sassanid period: the debt of Byzantine culture to Persia is well  known. Unfortunately no thorough investigation has been made of these  various and important changes, but it is clear that Persian  civilisation sent its influence far westward, at first directly and  later through the medium of Muhammedanism. The same facts hold good  with regard to the diffusion of intellectual culture from Persia. How  far Persian ideas may have influenced the development of Muhammedan  and even of Christian eschatology, we need not here discuss: but the  influence of the great Graeco-Christian schools of Persia was  enormous: they made the Arabs acquainted with the most important works  in Greek and Persian literature. To this fact was due the wide  influence of Islam upon Christian civilisation, which is evidenced  even to-day by the numerous words of Arab origin to be found in modern  European languages; it is in fact an influence the strength of which  can hardly be exaggerated. Not only the commercial products of the  East, but important economic methods, the ideals of our so-called  European chivalry and of its love poetry, the foundations of our  natural sciences, even theological and philosophical ideas of high  value were then sent to us from the East. The consequences of the  crusades are the best proof of the enormous superiority of the  Muhammedan world, a fact which is daily becoming more obvious. Here we  are concerned only with the influence exerted by Muhammedan  philosophy. It would be more correct to speak of post-classical than  of Muhammedan philosophy. But as above, the influence of Christianity  upon Islam was considered, so now the reverse process must be  outlined. In either case it was the heir to the late classical age, to  the mixed Graeco-Oriental culture, which influenced Islam at first in  Christian guise. Islam is often able to supplement its borrowings from  Christianity at the original sources, and when they have thus been  deepened and purified, these adaptations are returned to Christianity  in Muhammedan form.    Christian scholasticism was first based upon fragments of Aristotle  and chiefly inspired by Neo-Platonism: through the Arabs it became  acquainted with almost the whole of Aristotle and also with the  special methods by which the Arabs approach the problem of this  philosophy. To give any detailed account of this influence would be to  write a history of mediaeval philosophy in its relation to  ecclesiastical doctrine, a task which I feel to be beyond my powers. I  shall therefore confine myself to an abstract of the material points  selected from the considerable detail which specialists upon the  subject have collected: I consider that Arab influence during the  first period is best explained by the new wealth of Greek thought  which the Arabs appropriated and transmitted to Europe. These new  discoveries were the attainments of Greece in the natural sciences and  in logic: they extended the scope of dialectic and stimulated the rise  of metaphysical theory: the latter, in combination with ecclesiastical  dogma and Greek science, became such a system of thought as that  expounded in the Summa of Thomas Aquinas. Philosophy remained the  handmaid of religion and Arab influence first served only to complete  the ecclesiastical philosophy of life.    Eventually, however, the methods of interpretation and criticism,  peculiar to the Arabs when dealing with Aristotle became of no less  importance than the subject matter of their inquiries. This form of  criticism was developed from the emphasis which Islam had long laid  upon the value of wisdom, or recognition of the claims of reason.  Muhammedan tradition is full of the praises of wisdom, which it also  originally regarded as the basis of religion. Reason, however,  gradually became an independent power: orthodoxy did not reject reason  when it coincided with tradition, but under the influence of  Aristotelianism, especially as developed by Averroes, reason became a  power opposed to faith. The essential point of the doctrine was that  truth was twofold, according to faith and according to reason. Any one  who was subtle enough to recognise both kinds of truth could preserve  his orthodoxy: but the theory contained one great danger, which was  immediately obvious to the Christian church. The consequent struggle  is marked by the constant connection of Arab ideas with the  characteristic expressions of Christian feeling; these again are  connected with the outset of a new period, when the pioneers of the  Renaissance liberate the West from the chains of Greek ecclesiastical  classicism, from Oriental metaphysical religion and slowly pave the  way for the introduction of Germanic ideals directly derived from true  classicism. Not until that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11204"],[0,"Diseases of the Horse's Foot (#10)"],[1,"rests immediately upon a  Malpighian layer similar to that found in the epidermis generally. Instead  of the papillae present elsewhere in the skin, the corium of the nail-bed is  marked by longitudinal ridges, a similar, though less distinct, arrangement  to that found in the laminae of the horse's foot.    Having thus paved the way, we are now in a better position to discuss our  original question (Are the horny laminae secreted by the sensitive?),  and better able to appreciate the work that has been done towards the  elucidation of the problem.    A most valuable contribution to this study is an article published in 1896  by Professor Mettam.[A] Here the question is dealt with in a manner that  must effectually silence all other views save such as are based upon  similar methods of investigation--namely, histological examination of  sections of equine hoofs in various stages of foetal development.    [Footnote A: The _Veterinarian_, vol. lxix., p.1.]    Professor Mettam commences by drawing attention to the error that has  been made in this connection by studying the soft structures of the foot  separated by ordinary putrefactive changes from the horny covering. \"In  this way,\" the writer points out, \"a wholly erroneous idea has crept in  as to the relation of the one to the other, and the two parts have been  treated as two anatomical items, when, indeed, they are portions of one  and the same thing. As an illustration, and one very much to the point at  issue, the soft structures of the foot are to the horny covering what the  corium of the skin and the rete Malpighii are to the superficial portions  of the epidermis. Indeed, the point where solution of continuity occurs in  macerating is along the line of the soft protoplasmic cells of the rete.\"    In the foregoing description of the skin we have seen that the corium  is not a _plane_ surface, but that it is studded by numerous papillary  projections, and that these projections, with the depressions between them,  are covered by the cells of the epidermis.    The corium of the horse's foot, however, although possessed of papillae in  certain positions (as, for example, the papillae of the coronary cushion,  and those of the sensitive frog and sole), has also most pronounced ridges  (laminae) which run down the whole depth of the os pedis. Each lamina again  carries ridges (laminellae) on its lateral aspects, giving a section of  a lamina the appearance of being studded with papillae. We have already  pointed out the ridge-like formation of the human nail-bed, and noted that,  with the exception that the secondary ridges are not so pronounced, it is  an exact prototype of the laminal formation of the corium of the horse's  foot.    The distribution of the laminae over the foot we have discussed in the  chapter devoted to the grosser anatomy. In a macerated foot the sensitive  laminae of the corium interdigitate with the horny laminae of the hoof; that  is to say, there is no union between the two, for the simple reason that it  has been destroyed; they simply interlock like the _unglued_ junction of  a finely dovetailed piece of joinery. But no further, however, than the  irregularities of the underneath surface of the epidermis of the skin can  be said to interlock with the papillae of the corium does interlocking of  the horny and sensitive laminae occur. It is only apparent. The horny laminae  are simply beautifully regular epidermal ingrowths cutting up the corium  into minute leaf-like projections.    In a macerated specimen, then, the exposed sensitive structures of the  foot exhibit the corium as (1) the _Coronary Cushion_, fitting into the  cutigeral groove; (2) the _Sensitive Laminae_, clothing the outer surface of  the terminal phalanx, and extending to the bars; (3) the _Plantar Cushion_,  or sensitive frog; and (4) the _Sensitive Sole_.    The main portion of the wall is developed from the numerous papillae  covering the corium of the coronary cushion. We have in this way numberless  down-growing tubes of horn. Professor Mettam describes their formation in  a singularly happy fashion: \"Let the human fingers represent the coronary  papillae, the tips of the fingers the summits of the papillae, and the folds  of skin passing from finger to finger in the metacarpo-phalangeal region  the depressions between the papillae. Imagine that all have a continuous  covering of a proliferating epithelium. Then we shall have a more or less  continuous column of cells growing from the tip of the finger or papilla (a  hollow tube of cells gradually moving from off the surface of the finger  or papilla like a cast), and similar casts are passing from off all the  fingers or papillae.\"    From this description it will be noticed that each down-growing tube of  horn bears a striking resemblance to the growth of a hair, described on p.  47. In fact, the horn tube may be regarded as what it really is, a modified  hair.    We next continue Professor Mettam's illustration, and note how the modified  hairs or horn tubes become as it were matted together to form the hoof  wall. The cells lining the depressions are also proliferating, and their  progeny serve to cement together the hollow casts of the papillae, thus  giving the _inter_-tubular substance. We have thus produced hollow tubes,  united together by cells, all arising from the rete Malpighii of the  coronary corium. Section of the lower part of the horn tubes shows them to  contain a cellular debris.    Thus, in all, in the horn of the wall we find a tubular, an intertubular,  and intratubular substance. In fact, hairs matted together by intertubular  material, and only differing from ordinary hairs in their development in  that they arise, not from papillae sunk in the corium, but from papillae  projecting from its surface.    Although this disposes of the wall proper, there still confronts us the  question of the development of the horny laminae. To accurately determine  this point it is absolutely essential to examine, histologically, the feet  from embryos.    In the foot of any young ungulate in the early stages of intra-uterine  life horizontal sections will show a covering of epidermis of varying  thickness.[A] This may be only two or three cells thick, or may consist of  several layers. Lowermost we find the cells of the rete Malpighii. As some  criterion of the activity with which these are acting, it may be noted that  with the ordinary stains their nuclei take the dye intensely. The cells of  this layer rest upon a basement membrane separating the epidermis from the  corium. At this stage _the corium has a perfectly plane surface_.    [Footnote A: Equine foetus, seventy-seven days old.]    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--SECTION OF FOOT OF EQUINE FOETUS, SEVENTY-SEVEN  DAYS OLD. The rete Malpighii rests on a plane corium; the rent in the  section is along the line of the cells of the rete (Mettam).]    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--SECTION FROM FOOT OF SHEEP EMBRYO. It shows a  pronounced epithelial ingrowth into the corium (Mettam).]    The next stage will demonstrate the first step in the formation of the  sensitive laminae.[A] The plain surface of the corium has now become broken  up, and what is noticed is that the broken-up appearance is due to the  epithelial cells irrupting and advancing _en echelon_ into its connective  tissue. Each point of the ingrowing lines of the _echelon_ has usually  one cell further advanced into the corium than its neighbours, and may be  termed the _apical cell_. The fine basement membrane separating epithelium  from corium is still clearly evident. This epidermal irruption of the  corium takes place at definite points right round the foot. It is extremely  probable, however, that it commences first at the toe and spreads  laterally.    [Footnote A: Sheep embryo, exact age unknown.]    As yet, these cellular ingrowths (which are destined to be the _horny_  laminae, and cut up the corium into _sensitive_ laminae) are free from  irregularities or secondary laminae. Before these are to be observed other  changes in connection with the ingrowths are to be noticed.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--SECTION FROM CALF EMBRYO. The epithelial ingrowths  hang down from the epidermis into the corium like the teeth of a comb  (Mettam).]    The first is merely that of elongation of the epithelial processes into the  connective tissue, until the rete Malpighii gives one the impression that  it has hanging to its underneath surface and into the corium a number of  thorn-like processes. These extend all round the front of the foot, and  even in great part behind. Accompanying this elongation of the processes  is a condensation of the epithelial cells immediately above the rete  Malpighii, with a partial or total loss of their nuclei. This is the first  appearance of true horn, and its commencement is almost coincident with the  first stages of ossification of the os pedis.    [Illustration: FIG. 29.--SECTION OF AN EPITHELIAL INGROWTH FROM AN EQUINE  FOETUS. It shows commencing secondary laminar ridges. In the centre are  epithelial cells which are undergoing change into horny elements to form  the horn core, or 'horny laminae' (Mettam).]    With the appearance of horn comes difficulty of sectioning. The last  specimen that Professor Mettam was able to satisfactorily cut upon the  microtome was from a foetus between three and four months old. In this the  secondary laminar ridges were clearly indicated, and the active layer of  the rete Malpighii could be traced without a break from one ingrowing  epithelial process to the next, and around this, following all the  irregularities of its outline, and covering the branches of the nascent  laminae. The laminae mostly show this branching as if a number of different  growing points had arisen, each to take on a function similar to the  epithelial process as it at first appeared.    In the centre of the processes a few nuclei may be observed, but"]]]
