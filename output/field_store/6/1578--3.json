Thus far  the Government has been swift to recognize heroism and efficiency,  whether performed by Commodore Dewey at Manila or Lieutenant Hobson at  Santiago, and it can hardly be otherwise than that it will be ready  to recognize exceptional prowess and skill when performed by a Negro  officer.\"    \"All, perhaps, which the Negroes themselves, or their friends, have a  right to ask in their behalf is, that they shall have a chance to show  the stuff they are made of. The immortal Lincoln gave them this chance  when he admitted them to wear the blue and carry a musket; and right  manfully did they justify his confidence. There was not better  fighting done during the civil war than was done by some of the Negro  troops. With my experience, in command of 5,000 Negro soldiers, I  would, on the whole, prefer, I think, the command of a corps of Negro  troops to that of a corps of white troops. With the magnificent  record of their fighting qualities on many a hard-contested field, it  is not unreasonable to ask that a still further opportunity shall  be extended to them in commissioning them as officers, as well as  enlisting them as soldiers.\"    \"Naturally and necessarily the question of fitness for official  responsibility is the prime test and ought to be applied, and if  Negroes cannot be found of sufficient intelligence or preparation for  the duties incumbent on army officers, nobody should object to the  places being given to qualified white men. But so long as we draw no  race line of distinction as against Germans or Irishmen, and institute  no test of religion, politics or culture, we ought not to erect an  artificial barrier of color. If the Negroes are competent they should  be commissioned. If they are incompetent they should not be trusted  with the grave responsibilities attached to official position. I  believe they are competent.\"    [Illustration: GENERAL MAXIMO GOMEZ, OF THE CUBAN ARMY.]          CHAPTER V.      MANY TESTIMONIALS IN BEHALF OF THE NEGRO SOLDIERS.      A SOUTHERNER'S STATEMENT, THAT THE NEGRO CAVALRY SAVED THE \"ROUGH  RIDERS.\"    Some of the officers who accompanied the wounded soldiers on the trip  north give interesting accounts of the fighting around Santiago. \"I  was standing near Captain Capron and Hamilton Fish, Jr.,\" said a  corporal to the Associated Press correspondent to-night, \"and saw them  shot down. They were with the Rough Riders and ran into an ambuscade,  though they had been warned of the danger. If it had not been for the  Negro Calvary the Rough Riders would have been exterminated. I am not  a Negro lover. My father fought with Mosby's Rangers, and I was born  in the South, but the Negroes saved that fight, and the day will come  when General Shafter will give them credit for their bravery.\"--_Asso.  Press_.           *       *       *       *       *    RECONCILIATION.    \"Members of our regiment kicked somewhat when the colored troops were  sent forward with them, but when they saw how the Negroes fought  they became reconciled to the situation and some of them now say the  colored brother can have half of their blankets whenever they want  them.\"    The above is an extract from a communication to the Daily Afternoon  Journal, of Beaumont, Tex., written by a Southern white soldier:  \"Straws tell the way the wind blows,\" is a hackneyed expression, but  an apt illustration of the subject in hand. It has been hinted by a  portion of the Negro press that when the war ended, that if there is  to be the millennium of North and South, the Negroes will suffer in the  contraction. There is no reason to encourage this pessimistic view,  since it is so disturbing in its nature, and since it is in the  province of the individuals composing the race to create a future to  more or less extent. The wedge has entered; it remains for the race to  live up to its opportunities. The South already is making concessions.  While concessions are apt to be looked upon as too patronizing, and  not included in the classification of rights in common, yet in time  they amount to the same. The mere statement that \"the colored brother  can have half of their blankets whenever they want them,\" while  doubtless a figure of speech, yet it signifies that under this very  extreme of speech an appreciable advance of the race. It does not mean  that there is to be a storming of the social barriers, for even in the  more favored races definite lines are drawn. Sets and circles adjust  such matters. But what is desired is the toleration of the Negroes in  those pursuits that the people engage in or enjoy in general and in  common. It is all that the American Negro may expect, and it is safe  to say that his ambitions do not run higher, and ought not to run  higher. Money and birth in themselves have created some unwritten  laws that are much stronger than those decreed and promulgated by  governments. It would be the height of presumption to strike at these,  to some extent privileged classes. It is to be hoped that the good  fortunes of war will produce sanity and stability in the race,  contending for abstract justice.--_Freeman._    The testimony continues:    Private Smith of the Seventy-first Volunteers, speaking about the  impression his experience at Santiago had made upon him, said:    \"I am a Southerner by birth, and I never thought much of the colored  man. But, somewhat, now I feel very differently toward them, for I  met them in camp, on the battle field and that's where a man gets to  know a man. I never saw such fighting as those Tenth Cavalry men did.  They didn't seem to know what fear was, and their battle hymn was,  'There'll be a hot time in the old town to-night. That's not a  thrilling hymn to hear on the concert stage, but when you are lying in  a trench with the smell of powder in your nose and the crack of rifles  almost deafening you and bullets tearing up the ground around you  like huge hailstones beating down the dirt, and you see before you a  blockhouse from which there belches fourth the machine gun, pouring a  torrent of leaden missiles, while from holes in the ground you see  the leveled rifles of thousands of enemies that crack out death in  ever-increasing succession and then you see a body of men go up that  hill as if it were in drill, so solid do they keep their formation,  and those men are yelling, 'There'll be a hot time in the old town  to-night,' singing as if they liked their work, why, there's an  appropriateness in the tune that kind of makes your blood creep and  your nerves to thrill and you want to get up and go ahead if you lose  a limb in the attempt And that's what those 'niggers' did. You just  heard the Lieutenant say, 'Men, will you follow me?' and you hear a  tremendous shout answer him, 'You bet we will,' and right up through  that death-dealing storm you see men charge, that is, you see them  until the darned Springfield rifle powder blinds you and hides them.\"    \"And there is another thing, too, that teaches a man a lesson. The  action of the officers on the field is what I speak of. Somehow when  you watch these men with their gold braid in armories on a dance night  or dress parade it strikes you that they are a little more handsome  and ornamental than they are practical and useful. To tell the truth,  I didn't think much of those dandy officers on parade or dancing round  a ball room. I did not really think they were worth the money that was  spent upon them. But I just found it was different on the battlefield,  and they just knew their business and bullets were a part of the show  to them.\"           *       *       *       *       *    NEGRO SOLDIERS.    The Charleston News and Courier says:    It is not known what proportion of the insurgent army is colored, but  the indications are that the proportion of the same element in the  volunteer army of occupation will be small.    On the basis of population, of course one-third of the South's quota  should be made up of colored, and it is to be remembered that they  made good soldiers and constitute a large part of the regular army.  There were nearly 250,000 of them in service in the last war.           *       *       *       *       *    THE NEGRO AS A SOLDIER--HIS GOOD MARKSMANSHIP--THE FIGHT AT EL  CANEY--\"WOE TO SPANISH IN RANGE.\"    There has been hitherto among the officers of the army a certain  prejudice against serving in the Negro regiments. But the other day a  Lieutenant in the Ninth Infantry said enthusiastically:    \"Do you know, I shouldn't want anything better than to have a company  in a Negro regiment? I am from Virginia, and have always had the usual  feeling about commanding colored troops. But after seeing that charge  of the Twenty-fourth up the San Juan Hill, I should like the best in  the world to have a Negro company. They went up that incline yelling  and shouting just as I used to hear when they were hunting rabbits  in Virginia. The Spanish bullets only made them wilder to reach the  trenches.\"    [Illustration: FIRST PAY-DAY IN CUBA FOR THE NINTH AND TENTH CAVALRY.]    Officers of other regiments which were near the Twenty-fourth on July  1 are equally strong in their praise of the Negroes. Their yells were  an inspiration to their white comrades and spread dismay among the  Spaniards. A Captain in a volunteer regiment declares that the  Twenty-fourth did more than any other to win the day at San Juan.  As they charged up through the white soldiers their enthusiasm was  spread, and the entire line fought the better for their cheers and  their wild rush.    Spanish evidence to the effectiveness of the colored soldiers is not  lacking. Thus an officer who was with the troops that lay in wait for  the Americans at La Quasina on June 24th, said:    \"What"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11114"],[0,"Debate on Woman Suffrage in the Senate of the United States, (#10)"],[1,"  brook, and then let her go forth in the name of the Lord God of Hosts,  and a victory as sure and decisive as that of the shepherd of Israel  awaits her.    Again, in chapter 4, entitled \"The Power of the Home,\" the author  says, in substance: It is, perhaps, of minor consequence that women  should have felt themselves emancipated from buttons and bread  making; but that they should have learned to look in the least degree  slightingly upon the great duties of women as lovers of husbands, as  lovers of children, as the fountain and source of what is highest and  purest and holiest, and not less of what is homely and comfortable and  satisfying in the home, is a serious misfortune. Women can hardly  be said to have lost, perhaps what they have so rarely in any age  generally attained, that dignity which knows how to command, united  with a sweetness which seems all the while to be complying, the power,  supple and strong, which rescues the character of the ideal woman from  the charge of weakness, and at the same time exhibits its utmost of  grace and fascination.    But that of late years the gift has not been cultivated, has not, in  fact, thrown out such natural off-shoots as gave grace and glory to  some earlier social epochs, must be evident, it would seem, to any  thoughtful observer.    If, instead of trying to grasp more material power, women would pursue  those studies and investigations which tend to make them familiar with  what science teaches concerning the influence of the mother and the  home upon the child; of how completely the Creator in giving the  genesis of the human race into the hands of woman has made her not  only capable of, but responsible for, the regeneration of the world;  if they would reflect that nature by making man the bond slave of his  passions has put the lever into the hands of woman by which she can  control him, and if they would learn to use these powers, not as bad  women do for vile and selfish ends, but as the mothers of the race  ought, for pure, holy, and redemptive purposes, then would the sphere  of women be enlarged to some purpose; the atmosphere of the home would  be purified and vitalized, and the work of redeeming man from his  vices would be hopefully begun.    The following thoughts are also from the same source: Is this  emancipation of woman, if that is the proper phrase for it, a final  end, or only the means to an end? Are women to be as the outcome of it  emancipated from their world-old sphere of marriage and motherhood,  and control of the moral and spiritual destinies of the race, or are  they to be emancipated, in order to the proper fulfillment of these  functions? It would seem that most of the advanced women of the day  would answer the first of these questions affirmatively. Women, I  think it has been authoritatively stated, are to be emancipated in  order that they may become fully developed human beings, something  broader and stronger, something higher and finer, more delicate,  more aesthetic, more generally rarefied and sublimated than the  old-fashioned type of womanhood, the wife and the mother.    And the result of the woman movement seems more or less in a line thus  far with this theoretic aim. Of advanced women a less proportion are  inclined to marry than of the old-fashioned type; of those who do  marry a great proportion are restless in marriage bonds or seek  release from them, while of those who do remain in married life many  bear no children, and few, indeed, become mothers of large families.  The woman's vitality is concentrated in the brain and fructifies more  in intellectual than in physical forms.    Now, women who do not marry are one of two things; either they belong  to a class which we shrink from naming or they become old maids.    An old maid may be in herself a very useful and commendable person and  a valuable member of society; many are all this. But she has still  this sad drawback, she can not perpetuate herself; and since all  history and observation go to prove that the great final end of  creation, whatever it may be, can only be achieved through the  perpetuity and increasing progress of the race, it follows that  unmarried woman is not the most necessary, the indispensable type of  woman. If there were no other class of females left upon the earth but  the women who do not bear children, then the world would be a failure,  creation would be nonplussed.    If, then, the movement for the emancipation of woman has for its final  end the making of never so fine a quality, never so sublimated a sort  of non-child-bearing women, it is an absurdity upon the face of it.    From the standpoint of the Chimney Corner it appears that too many  even of the most gifted and liberal-minded of the leaders in the  woman's rights movement have not yet discovered this flaw in their  logic. They seek to individualize women, not seeing, apparently,  that individualized women, old maids, and individualized men, old  bachelors, though they may be useful in certain minor ways, are, after  all, to speak with the relentlessness of science, fragmentary and  abortive, so far as the great scheme of the universe is concerned, and  often become, in addition, seriously detrimental to the right progress  of society. The man and woman united in marriage form the unit of the  race; they alone rightly wield the self-perpetuating power upon which  all human progress depends; without which the race itself must perish,  the universe become null.    Reaching this point of the argument, it becomes evident that while the  development of the individual man or individual woman is no doubt of  great importance, since, as Margaret Fuller has justly said, \"there  must be units before there can be union,\" it is chiefly so because of  their relation to each other. Their character should be developed  with a view to their future union with each other, and not to be  independent of it. When the leaders of the woman's movement fully  realize this, and shape their course accordingly, they will have made  a great advance both in the value of their work and its claim upon  public sympathy. Moreover, they will have reached a point from which  it will be possible for them to investigate reform and idealize the  relations existing between men and women.    Mr. President, it is no part of my purpose in any manner whatever  to speak disrespectfully of the large number of intelligent ladies,  sometimes called strong-minded, who are constantly going before the  public, agitating this question of female suffrage. While some of them  may, as is frequently charged, be courting notoriety, I have no  doubt they are generally earnestly engaged in a work which, in their  opinion, would better their condition and would do no injury to  society.    In all this, however, I believe they are mistaken.    I think the mental and physical structure of the sexes, of itself,  sufficiently demonstrates the fact that the sterner, more laborious,  and more difficult duties of society are to be performed by the male  sex; while the more delicate duties of life, which require less  physical strength, and the proper training of youth, with the proper  discharge of domestic duties, belong to the female sex. Nature has so  arranged it that the male sex can not attend properly to the duties  assigned by the law of nature to the female sex, and that the female  sex can not discharge the more rigorous duties required of the male  sex.    This movement is an attempt to reverse the very laws of our being,  and to drag woman into an arena for which she is not suited, and to  devolve upon her onerous duties which the Creator never intended that  she should perform.    While the husband discharges the laborious and fatiguing duties of  important official positions, and conducts political campaigns, and  discharges the duties connected with the ballot-box, or while he bears  arms in time of war, or discharges executive or judicial duties, or  the duties of juryman, requiring close confinement and many times  great mental fatigue; or while the husband in a different sphere of  life discharges the laborious duties of the plantation, the workshop,  or the machine shop, it devolves upon the wife to attend to the duties  connected with home life, to care for infant children, and to train  carefully and properly those who in the youthful period are further  advanced towards maturity.    The woman with the infant at the breast is in no condition to plow  on the farm, labor hard in the workshop, discharge the duties of a  juryman, conduct causes as an advocate in court, preside in important  cases as a judge, command armies as a general, or bear arms as a  private. These duties, and others of like character, belong to the  male sex; while the more important duties of home, to which I have  already referred, devolve upon the female sex. We can neither reverse  the physical nor the moral laws of our nature, and as this movement is  an attempt to reverse these laws, and to devolve upon the female  sex important and laborious duties for which they are not by nature  physically competent, I am not prepared to support this bill.    My opinion is that a very large majority of the American people, yes,  a large majority of the female sex, oppose it, and that they act  wisely in doing so. I therefore protest against its passage.        Mr. DOLPH. Mr. President, I shall not detain the Senate long. I do  not feel satisfied when a measure so important to the people of this  country and to humanity is about to be submitted to a vote of the  Senate to remain wholly silent.    The pending question is upon the adoption of a joint resolution in the  usual form submitting to the legislatures of the several States of the  Union for their ratification an additional article as an amendment to  the Federal Constitution, which is as follows:        ARTICLE--,        SECTION I.
