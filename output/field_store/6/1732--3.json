[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14411"],[0,"The Children's Six Minutes (#10)"],[1,". Listen. Is the  noise very loud? Here I have a heavy railroad spike. Hear the noise this  makes as it is dropped. And now I shall drop this large nail. The noise  that made is not nearly as loud as the noise occasioned by the falling  hammer. Here is a small nail. You will have to listen very carefully if  you hear the sound of the nail as it strikes the carpet. Have you good  ears? Let us test them. Here is an ordinary pin. If you keep very quiet  you will be able to hear the falling of this tiny pin. Do not move in  your seat. Every one, attention! Listen. Did you hear it? Yes, most of  you did.    That pin did not make much noise. No sound could be more subdued than a  dropping pin. Ah, but there is a sound that is infinitely more quiet. At  the same time it is louder than the roll of thunder, or the firing of a  huge cannon, or the explosion of a great boiler. Some call it  \"conscience.\" I like to think of it as a voice. It is the still, small  voice within. When you go to do wrong this voice speaks to you. Hear the  voice, and give good heed.    MEMORY VERSE, _I Kings_ 19: 12        \"And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the      fire: and after the fire a still small voice.\"    MEMORY HYMN [320]        _\"I want a principle within.\"_          THANKSGIVING      What does Thanksgiving mean to you? I hear one boy say, \"It means a big  dinner.\" I think we all agree with him. Who does not welcome and enjoy a  good dinner! I hear Mary say, \"Thanksgiving means a day off from  school.\" I guess you are right too. School is not such a charming place  that girls and boys are unwilling to have an occasional holiday.    Now I am going to ask some of the older people what the day means to  them. There is a young woman. She is a stenographer. She says,  \"Thanksgiving means a day away from the office. I am at the office every  day except Sunday, and I do appreciate, now and then, a day that is  really my own.\" Yonder is a traveling salesman. What does Thanksgiving  mean to you? He says, \"It means a day at home. Last year I spent one  hundred and sixty-nine nights away from home. I have three children. I  should like to see them every day. There are times when many days pass  and I do not see them. Thanksgiving week I plan to be at home.\"    There are others I could ask. Each has his answer. But Thanksgiving has  a special meaning for us. It is the Harvest time. I have here an apple.  Isn't this a beautiful apple? What color! Who mixed the paints, who  handled the brush to give such color to this apple? God. He, in his  infinite love and wisdom, has provided, through the unfailing laws of  nature, for the growth, sweetness, coloring and beautifying of all the  products of the fields. This apple is but one of many kinds of fruits.    Praise, then, is the great meaning of Thanksgiving. God, our heavenly  Father, sends us every good gift. From his bountiful hand come our daily  and nightly mercies. We should praise him every day. But the day for the  united chorus of praise is Thanksgiving.    MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 150: 6        \"Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the      Lord.\"    MEMORY HYMN [717]        _\"Come, ye thankful people, come.\"_          MARBLES IN THE POCKET      Do you know what a Missionary Box is? Well, I will tell you. It is a box  or barrel sent from a missionary society in a city or town to a  missionary family or school on the frontier. The box contains clothing,  bedding, and sometimes toys, dolls and picture books if there are  children at the frontier end of the journey.    In a certain city one Christmas season the children of the Sunday School  brought gifts to fill a box. Some brought clothes they had outgrown.  Some who had two coats decided they could give one. Others brought  books. One little girl brought a beautiful doll. She had other dolls,  and this one she dearly loved, but she said, \"I want some other little  girl to be happy, and I think I can get along without this doll, though  I shall miss her dreadfully.\"    One day the committee came together to sort the gifts and pack the box.  One woman picked up a boy's coat. She felt something, hard in one of the  pockets. Another woman said, \"Better look all through those pockets;  you can never tell what a boy will use his pockets for.\" So she went all  through the pockets. In one of them she found a soiled handkerchief tied  in a knot. With much pulling, for it was a hard knot, she loosed the  little package, and there she found five marbles. With the marbles was a  note scrawled in a boy's hand--        \"DEAR BOY WHO GETS THIS COAT,        I have eight marbles. First I put in four for you. Then I put in      another one. I hope you will like the coat, and the marbles.        From your friend,        JOHN MASON.\"    Now what do you think of that? Isn't it glorious? To give more to the  other fellow than you keep for yourself, especially when that other  fellow is some one you have never seen, is Christlike.    MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew_ 7: 12        \"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye      even so to them.\"    MEMORY HYMN [411]        _\"O Master, let me walk with thee.\"_          THE FIRST MONTH      What month is this? December. It is the first month in the year. \"No,  no,\" you say, \"December is the last month.\" I cannot entirely agree with  you. December is last on the calendar but first in importance. Now you  agree with me, do you not?    How many days has December? One day. \"No, no,\" I again hear you say,  \"December has thirty-one days.\" I think we can reach an agreement on  this point too. There is one day in December of unexcelled importance  and loveliness; that day is the twenty-fifth. Yes, we all say there is  but one day in December. How readily we agree when we understand one  another!    What is the twenty-fifth? It is the pivotal day in the history of the  world. It is the day upon which the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords  was born. Jesus, son of man and son of God, came into the world as we  all come, as a tiny babe. It brings him much nearer to us, does it not,  to think that our Saviour was once as we are? He grew up as a child, a  boy, a youth, a man. It is the birthday of Christ the Saviour we  celebrate on the twenty-fifth of each December.    To whom did Jesus come? He came to a lowly people. He was revealed first  of all to the shepherds. The shepherd's task was not an enviable one. He  was out in the open, subject to storms and winds and wild beasts. His  business was to shepherd the sheep, to lead them to good pasture, to  protect them from all harm and danger. The shepherd's task was lonely as  well as lowly. His days and nights were passed in solitude. Occasionally  a group of shepherds would come together, but for the most part they  were alone with their flocks. God chose these people, whose minds were  clear, whose lives were pure, to be the first messengers of the glad  tidings of great joy.    MEMORY VERSE, _Luke_ 2: 8        \"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the      field, keeping watch over their flocks by night.\"    MEMORY HYMN [115]        _\"While shepherds watched their flocks.\"_          HIM AND HYMN      I want to tell you to-day about two \"Hims.\" The first is a man \"Him.\"  The second is a song \"Hymn.\"    The man \"him\" is Phillips Brooks. He was born in 1835 and died in 1893.  He never married, so he had no girls and boys of his own. But he loved  all children. He had a great, warm heart, and in that heart was a big  corner for all young people. He became a minister. His first church was  in Philadelphia. Later he moved to Boston. He had not been in Boston  very long when, one night, about midnight, the people saw flames  breaking out through the roof of the church. A sorrowing congregation,  with their pastor, watched their loved church as it burned to the  ground.    When, after the fire, they came together, they inquired, \"What shall we  do? Shall we rebuild here or shall we take another location?\" Finally it  was decided to build a new church on Copley Square. That was many years  ago. They built a beautiful temple of worship. It is still known  everywhere as \"Phillips Brooks' Church,\" so wonderfully did his  personality enter into the project.    Now the second \"hymn.\" When Phillips Brooks was a young man in  Philadelphia he made a trip to the Holy Land. As Christmas drew near he  wrote and sent back to the girls and boys of his Sunday School, a  Christmas poem. The organist of his church composed music for the words,  and this hymn was sung for the first time in Trinity church,  Philadelphia. It is a beautiful Christmas hymn. Yes, it is my favorite.        \"Oh, little town of Bethlehem, How still we see thee lie.\"    MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew_ 2: 6        \"Thou, Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the      princes of Juda: For out of thee shall come a Governor that shall      rule my people Israel.\"    MEMORY HYMN [121]        _\"O little town of Bethlehem.\"_          THE CHRISTMAS TREE      For a few years I lived in a country where \"December is as pleasant as  May.\" The weather was warm all through the year. The ground was never  frozen, for there was never any frost. I never saw a snowflake in all  the years I lived in the tropics. The trees were trees of the hot  climate, mostly palm, bamboo and acacia trees. When Christmas drew near  I thought the day would be a very dreary day, and wholly unChristmaslike  because there would be no snow, and we would be without our accustomed  tree.    A few days before our first Christmas in the tropics a friend said to  me, \"I am sending a tree down from the mountains for your children.\" In  due time the tree arrived. You can imagine the joy of our entire  household when they looked upon a genuine, evergreen, Christmas tree. We  set it up in our big \"sala,\" that is our living room, and there it  remained for many days, the delight of our eyes."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14417"],[0,"The Agamemnon of Aeschylus (#10)"],[1,"rain,  O face that slew the souls on Ilion's plain,  One face, one face, and many a thousand slain?    The hate of old that on this castle lay,  Builded in lust, a husband's evil day,  Hath bloomed for thee a perfect flower again  And unforgotten, an old and burning stain    Never to pass away.    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Nay, pray not for the hour of death, being tried    Too sore beneath these blows  Neither on Helen turn thy wrath aside,  The Slayer of Men, the face which hath destroyed  Its thousand Danaan souls, and wrought a wide    Wound that no leech can close.      CHORUS.    --Daemon, whose heel is set    On the House and the twofold kin      Of the high Tantalidae,  A power, heavy as fate,    Thou wieldest through woman's sin,      Piercing the heart of me!    --Like a raven swoln with hate    He hath set on the dead his claw,  He croaketh a song to sate    His fury, and calls it Law!    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Ah, call upon Him! Yea, call--    And thy thought hath found its path--  The Daemon who haunts this hall,    The thrice-engorged Wrath;    From him is the ache of the flesh    For blood born and increased;  Ere the old sore hath ceased    It oozeth afresh.    CHORUS.      --Indeed He is very great,        And heavy his anger, He,      The Daemon who guides the fate       Of the old Tantalidae:  Alas, alas, an evil tale ye tell  Of desolate angers and insatiable!    --Ah me,    And yet 'tis all as Zeus hath willed,        Doer of all and Cause of all;    By His Word every chance doth fall,        No end without Him is fulfilled;            What of these things    But cometh by high Heaven's counsellings?      [_A band of Mourners has gathered within the House_.    MOURNERS.    Ah, sorrow, sorrow! My King, my King!    How shall I weep, what word shall I say?  Caught in the web of this spider thing,    In foul death gasping thy life away!  Woe's me, woe's me, for this slavish lying,  The doom of craft and the lonely dying,    The iron two-edged and the hands that slay!    CLYTEMNESTRA.         And criest thou still this deed hath been       My work? Nay, gaze, and have no thought       That this is Agamemnon's Queen.       'Tis He, 'tis He, hath round him wrought       This phantom of the dead man's wife;  He, the old Wrath, the Driver of Men astray,         Pursuer of Atreus for the feast defiled;       To assoil an ancient debt he hath paid this life;  A warrior and a crowned King this day          Atones for a slain child.    CHORUS.    --That thou art innocent herein,      What tongue dare boast? It cannot be,    Yet from the deeps of ancient sin      The Avenger may have wrought with thee.    --On the red Slayer crasheth, groping wild      For blood, more blood, to build his peace again,      And wash like water the old frozen stain            Of the torn child.    MOURNERS.    Ah, sorrow, sorrow! My King, my King!    How shall I weep, what word shall I say?  Caught in the web of this spider thing,    In foul death gasping thy life away.  Woe's me, woe's me, for this slavish lying,  The doom of craft and the lonely dying,    The iron two-edged and the hands that slay!    CLYTEMNESTRA.    And what of the doom of craft that first  He planted, making the House accurst?  What of the blossom, from this root riven,  Iphigenia, the unforgiven?  Even as the wrong was, so is the pain:  He shall not laugh in the House of the slain,      When the count is scored;  He hath but spoiled and paid again      The due of the sword.    CHORUS.    I am lost; my mind dull-eyed      Knows not nor feels  Whither to fly nor hide      While the House reels.  The noise of rain that falls      On the roof affrighteth me,  Washing away the walls;      Rain that falls bloodily.    Doth ever the sound abate?  Lo, the next Hour of Fate  Whetting her vengeance due  On new whet-stones, for new      Workings of hate.    MOURNERS.    Would thou hadst covered me, Earth, O Earth,    Or e'er I had looked on my lord thus low,  In the palled marble of silvern girth!    What hands may shroud him, what tears may flow?    Not thine, O Woman who dared to slay him,    Thou durst not weep to him now, nor pray him,  Nor pay to his soul the deep unworth    Of gift or prayer to forget thy blow.    --Oh, who with heart sincere      Shall bring praise or grief  To lay on the sepulchre      Of the great chief?    CLYTEMNESTRA.    His burial is not thine to array.      By me he fell, by me he died,      I watch him to the grave, not cried  By mourners of his housefolk; nay,    His own child for a day like this      Waits, as is seemly, and shall run      By the white waves of Acheron  To fold him in her arms and kiss!      CHORUS.    Lo, she who was erst reviled      Revileth; and who shall say?  Spoil taken from them that spoiled,      Life-blood from them that slay!  Surely while God ensueth      His laws, while Time doth run  'Tis written: On him that doeth      It shall be done.    This is God's law and grace,  Who then shall hunt the race  Of curses from out this hall?  The House is sealed withal      To dreadfulness.      CLYTEMNESTRA.    Aye, thou hast found the Law, and stept      In Truth's way.--Yet even now I call      The Living Wrath which haunts this hall  To truce and compact. I accept    All the affliction he doth heap      Upon me, and I charge him go      Far off with his self-murdering woe  To strange men's houses. I will keep    Some little dower, and leave behind      All else, contented utterly.      I have swept the madness from the sky  Wherein these brethren slew their kind.      [_As she ceases, exhausted and with the fire gone out of her,_  AIGISTHOS, _with Attendants, bursts triumphantly in._      AIGISTHOS.    O shining day, O dawn of righteousness  Fulfilled! Now, now indeed will I confess  That divine watchers o'er man's death and birth  Look down on all the anguish of the earth,  Now that I see him lying, as I love  To see him, in this net the Furies wove,  To atone the old craft of his father's hand.      For Atreus, this man's father, in this land  Reigning, and by Thyestes in his throne  Challenged--he was his brother and mine own  Father From home and city cast him out;  And he, after long exile, turned about  And threw him suppliant on the hearth, and won  Promise of so much mercy, that his own  Life-blood should reek not in his father's hall.  Then did that godless brother, Atreus, call,  To greet my sire--More eagerness, O God,  Was there than love!--a feast of brotherhood.  And, feigning joyous banquet, laid as meat  Before him his dead children. The white feet  And finger-fringed hands apart he set,  Veiled from all seeing, and made separate  The tables. And he straightway, knowing naught,  Took of those bodies, eating that which wrought  No health for all his race. And when he knew  The unnatural deed, back from the board he threw,  Spewing that murderous gorge, and spurning brake  The table, to make strong the curse he spake:  \"Thus perish all of Pleisthenes begot!\"      For that lies this man here; and all the plot  Is mine, most righteously. For me, the third,  When butchering my two brethren, Atreus spared  And cast me with my broken sire that day,  A little thing in swaddling clothes, away  To exile; where I grew, and at the last  Justice hath brought me home! Yea though outcast  In a far land, mine arm hath reached this king;  My brain, my hate, wrought all the counselling;  And all is well. I have seen mine enemy  Dead in the snare, and care not if I die!    LEADER.    Aigisthos, to insult over the dead  I like not. All the counsel, thou hast said,  Was thine alone; and thine the will that spilled  This piteous blood. As justice is fulfilled,  Thou shalt not 'scape--so my heart presageth---The  day of cursing and the hurled death.    AIGISTHOS.    How, thou poor oarsman of the nether row,  When the main deck is master? Sayst thou so?...  To such old heads the lesson may prove hard,  I fear me, when Obedience is the word.  But hunger, and bonds, and cold, help men to find  Their wits.--They are wondrous healers of the mind!  Hast eyes and seest not this?--Against a spike  Kick not, for fear it pain thee if thou strike.    LEADER  (_turning from him to_ CLYTEMNESTRA).    Woman! A soldier fresh from war! To keep  Watch o'er his house and shame him in his sleep...  To plot this craft against a lord of spears...      [CLYTEMNESTRA, _as though in a dream, pays no heed._ AIGISTHOS  _interupts._    AIGISTHOS.    These be the words, old man, that lead to tears!  Thou hast an opposite to Orpheus' tongue,  Who chained all things with his enchanting song,  For thy mad noise will put the chains on thee.  Enough! Once mastered thou shalt tamer be.    LEADER.    Thou master? Is old Argos so accurst?  Thou plotter afar off, who never durst  Raise thine own hand to affront and strike him down...    AIGISTHOS.    To entice him was the wife's work. I was known  By all men here, his old confessed blood-foe.  Howbeit, with his possessions I will know  How to be King. And who obeys not me  Shall be yoked hard, no easy trace-horse he,  Corn-flushed. Hunger, and hunger's prison mate,  The clammy murk, shall see his rage abate.    LEADER.    Thou craven soul! Why not in open strife  Slay him? Why lay the blood-sin on his wife,  Staining the Gods of Argos, making ill  The soil thereof?...But young Orestes still  Liveth. Oh, Fate will guide him home again,  Avenging, conquering, home to kill these twain!    AIGISTHOS.    'Fore God, if 'tis your pleasure thus to speak and do, ye soon shall hear!  Ho there, my trusty pikes, advance! There cometh business for the spear.      [_A body of Spearmen, from concealment outside, rush in and dominate the  stage._]    LEADER.  Ho there, ye Men of Argos! Up! Stand and be ready, sword from sheath!    AIGISTHOS.    By Heaven, I also, sword in hand, am ready, and refuse not death!    LEADER.    Come, find it! We accept thy word. Thou offerest what we hunger for.     [_Some of the Elders draw swords"]]]
