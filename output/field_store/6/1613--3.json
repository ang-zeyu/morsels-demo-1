It harmonized  also with the persistence with which he followed up every intellectual  task until it was satisfactorily completed. We see the same thought  expressed in the same kind of metaphor in the bold but beautiful  expression which occurs in the letters from Raphael to Julius in the  magazine, _The Thalia_--    \"When Columbus made the risky wager with an untraveled sea.\" * * *    [Illustration: #UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN# With the statues of Wilhelm and  Alexander von Humboldt]    Art and poetry were directly joined to what was most noble in man;  they were represented to be the medium by means of which he first  awakens to the consciousness of that nature, reaching out beyond the  finite, which dwells within him. Both of them were thus placed upon  the height from which they really originate. To safeguard them upon  this height, to save them from being desecrated by every paltry and  belittling view, to rescue them from every sentiment which did not  spring from their purity, was really Schiller's aim, and appeared to  him as his true life-mission determined for him by the original  tendency of his nature.    His first and most urgent demands are, therefore, addressed to the  poet himself, from whom he requires not merely genius and talent  isolated, as it were, in their activity, but a mood which takes  possession of the entire soul and is in harmony with the sublimity of  his vocation; it must be not a mere momentary exaltation, but an  integral part of character. \"Before he undertakes to influence the  best among his contemporaries he should make it his first and most  important business to elevate his own self to the purest and noblest  ideal of humanity.\" * * * To no one does Schiller apply this demand  more rigorously than to himself.    Of him it can truthfully be said that matters which bordered upon the  common or even upon the ordinary, never had the slightest hold upon  him; that he transferred completely the high and noble views which  filled his thoughts to his mode of feeling and his life; and that in  his compositions he was ever, with uniform force, inspired with a  striving for the ideal. This was true even of his minor productions.    To assign to poetry, among human endeavors, the lofty and serious  place of which I have spoken above, to defend it from the petty point  of view of those who, mistaking its dignity, and the pedantic attitude  of those who, mistaking its peculiar character, regard it only as a  trifling adornment and embellishment of life or else ask an immediate  moral effect and teaching from it--this, as one cannot repeat too  often, is deeply rooted in the German habit of thought and feeling.  Schiller in his poetry gave utterance--in his own individual manner,  however--to whatever his German nature had implanted in him, to the  harmony which rang out to him from the depths of the language, the  mysterious effect of which he so cleverly perceived and knew how to  use so masterfully. * * *    The deeper and truer trend of the German resides in his highly  developed sensibility which keeps him closer to the truths of nature,  in his inclination to live in the world of ideas and of emotions  dependent upon them, and, in fact, in everything which is connected  therewith. * * *    A favorite idea which often engaged Schiller's attention was the need  of educating the crude natural man--as he understood him--through art,  before he could be left to attain culture through reason. Schiller has  enlarged upon this theme on many occasions, both in prose and verse.  His imagination dwelt by preference upon the beginnings of  civilization in general, upon the transition from the nomadic life to  the agricultural, upon the covenant established in naive faith with  pious Mother Earth, as he so beautifully expresses it.    Whatever mythology offered here as kindred material, he grasped with  eagerness and firmness. Faithfully following the traces of fable, he  made of Demeter, the chief personage in the group of agricultural  deities, a figure as wonderful as it was appealing, by uniting in her  breast human feelings with divine. It was long a cherished plan with  Schiller to treat in epic form the earliest Attic civilization  resulting from foreign immigration. _The Eleusinian Festival_,  however, replaced this plan, which was never executed. * * *    The merely emotional, the fervid, the simply descriptive, in fact  every variety of poetry derived directly from contemplation and  feeling, are found in Schiller in countless single passages and in  whole poems. * * * But the most remarkable evidence of the consummate  genius of the poet is seen in _The Song of the Bell_, which, in  changing metre, in descriptions full of vivacity where a few touches  represent a whole picture, runs through the varied experiences in the  life of man and of society; for it expresses the feelings which arise  in each of them, and ever adapts the whole, symbolically, to the tones  of the bell, the casting and completing of which the poem accompanies  throughout in all its various stages. I know of no poem, in any  language, which shows so wide a poetic world in so small a compass,  that so runs through the scale of all that is deepest in human  feelings, and, in the guise of a lyric, depicts life in its important  events and epochs as if in an epic poem confined within natural  limits. But the poetic clearness is enhanced by the fact that a  subject which is portrayed as actually existing, corresponds with the  shadowy visions of the imagination; and the two series thus formed run  parallel with each other to the same end. * * *    Schiller was snatched from the world in the full maturity of his  intellectual power, though he would undoubtedly have been able to  perform an endless amount of additional work. His scope was so  unlimited that he would never have been able to find a goal, and the  constantly increasing activity of his mind would never have allowed  him time for stopping. For long years ahead he would have been able to  enjoy the happiness, the rapture, yes, the bliss of his occupation as  a poet, as he so inimitably describes it in one of the letters in this  collection, written about a plan for an idyl. His life ended indeed  before the customary limit had been reached, yet, while it lasted, he  worked exclusively and uninterruptedly in the realm of ideas and  fancy.    Of no one else, perhaps, can it be said so truthfully that \"he had  thrown away the fear of that which was earthly and had escaped out of  the narrow gloomy life into the realm of the ideal.\" And it may be  observed, in closing, that he had lived surrounded only by the most  exalted ideas and the most brilliant visions which it is possible for  a mortal to appropriate and to create. One who thus departs from earth  cannot be regarded as otherwise than happy.          THE EARLY ROMANTIC SCHOOL    By JAMES TAFT HATFIELD, PH.D.    Professor of the German Language and Literature, Northwestern  University.    The latter half of the eighteenth century has been styled the Age of  Enlightenment, a convenient name for a period in which there was a  noticeable attempt to face the obvious, external facts of life in a  clear-eyed and courageous way. The centralizing of political power in  the hands of Louis XIV. of France and his successors had been  accompanied by a \"standardizing\" of human affairs which favored  practical efficiency and the easier running of the social machine, but  which was far from helpful to the self-expression of distinctly-marked  individuals.    The French became sovereign arbiters of taste and form, but their  canons of art were far from nature and the free impulses of mankind.  The particular development of this spirit of clarity in Berlin, the  centre of German influence, lay in the tendency to challenge all  historic continuity, and to seek uniformity based upon practical  needs.    Rousseau's revolutionary protests against inequality and  artificiality--particularly his startling treatise _On the Origin and  Foundations of Inequality among Men_ (1754)--and his fervent preaching  of the everlasting superiority of the heart to the head, constitute  the most important factor in a great revolt against regulated social  institutions, which led, at length, to the \"Storm and Stress\" movement  in Germany, that boisterous forerunner of Romanticism, yet so unlike  it that even Schlegel compared its most typical representatives to the  biblical herd of swine which stampeded--into oblivion. Herder,  proclaiming the vital connection between the soul of a whole nation  and its literature, and preaching a religion of the feelings rather  than a gospel of \"enlightenment;\" young Goethe, by his daring and  untrammeled Shakespearian play, _Goetz von Berlichingen_, and by his  open defiance, announced in _Werther_, of the authority of all  artistic rules and standards; and Buerger, asserting the right of the  common man to be the only arbiter of literary values, were, each in  his own way, upsetting the control of an artificial \"classicism.\"  Immanuel Kant, whose deep and dynamic thinking led to a revolution  comparable to a cosmic upheaval in the geological world, compelled his  generation to discover a vast new moral system utterly disconcerting  to the shallow complacency of those who had no sense of higher values  than \"practical efficiency.\"    When, in 1794, Goethe and Schiller, now matured and fully seasoned by  a deep-going classical and philosophical discipline, joined their  splendid forces and devoted their highest powers to the building up of  a comprehensive esthetic philosophy, the era was fully come for new  constructive efforts on German soil. Incalculably potent was the  ferment liberated by Goethe's _Wilhelm Meister_ (1795-1796)--it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12083"],[0,"Eric; Or, Little (#10)"],[1,"in the salt water.    \"Oh, ay; very pretty indeed. But I must be off to cricket.\"    Vernon looked up at his brother sadly.    \"You aren't so kind to me, Eric, as you used to be.\"    \"What nonsense! and all because I don't admire those nasty red-jelly  things, which one may see on the shore by thousands any day. What a  little goose you are, Vernon!\"    Vernon made no reply, but was putting away his sea-anemones with a sigh,  when in came Russell to fetch Eric to the cricket.    \"Well, Verny,\" he said, \"have you been getting those pretty  sea-anemones? come here and show me them. Ah, I declare you've got one  of those famous white plumosa fellows among them. What a lucky little  chap you are!\"    Vernon was delighted.    \"Mind you take care of them,\" said Russell. \"Where did you find them?\"    \"I have been down the shore getting them.\"    \"And have you had a pleasant morning?\"    \"Yes, Russell, thank you. Only it is rather dull being always by myself,  and Eric never comes with me now.\"    \"Naughty Eric,\" said Russell, playfully. \"Never mind, Verny; you and I  will cut him, and go by ourselves.\"    Eric had stood by during the conversation, and the contrast of Russel's  unselfish kindness with his own harsh want of sympathy, struck him. He  threw his arms round his brother's neck, and said, \"We will both go with  you, Verny, next half holiday.\"    \"O, thank you, Eric,\" said his brother; and the two schoolboys ran out.  But when the next half holiday came, warm and bright, with the promise  of a good match that afternoon, Eric repented his promise, and left  Russell to amuse his little brother, while he went off, as usual, to the  playground.    There was one silent witness of scenes like these, who laid them up  deeply in her heart. Mrs. Williams was not unobservant of the gradual  but steady falling off in Eric's character, and the first thing she  noticed was the blunting of his home affections. When they first came to  Roslyn, the boy used constantly to join his father and mother in their  walks; but now he went seldom or never; and even if he did go, he seemed  ashamed, while with them, to meet any of his schoolfellows. The spirit  of false independence was awake and growing in her darling son. The  bright afternoons they had spent together on the sunny shore, or seeking  for sea-flowers among the lonely rocks of the neighboring  headlands,--the walks at evening and sunset among the hills, and the  sweet counsel they had together, when the boy's character opened like a  flower in the light and warmth of his mother's love,--the long twilights  when he would sit on a stool with his young head resting on her knees,  and her loving hand among his fair hair,--all these things were becoming  to Mrs. Williams memories, and nothing more.    It was the trial of her life, and very sad to bear; the more so because  they were soon to be parted, certainly for years, perhaps for ever. The  time was drawing nearer and nearer; it was now June, and Mr. Williams'  term of furlough ended in two months. The holidays at Roslyn were the  months of July and August, and towards their close Mr. and Mrs. Williams  intended to leave Vernon at Fairholm, and start for India--sending back  Eric by himself as a boarder in Dr. Rowlands' house.    After morning school, on fine days, the boys used to run straight down  to the shore and bathe. A bright and joyous scene it was. They stripped  off their clothes on the shingle that adjoined the beach, and then  running along the sands, would swim out far into the bay till their  heads looked like small dots glancing in the sunshine. This year Eric  had learned to swim, and he enjoyed the bathing more than any  other pleasure.    One day after they had dressed, Russell and he began to amuse themselves  on the sea-shore. The little translucent pools left on the sands by the  ebbing tide always swarm with life, and the two boys found great fun in  hunting audacious little crabs, or catching the shrimps that shuffled  about in the shallow water. At last Eric picked up a piece of wood which  he found lying on the beach, and said, \"What do you say to coming  crabfishing, Edwin? this bit of stick will do capitally to thrust  between the rocks in the holes where they lie?\"    Russell agreed, and they started to the rocks of the Ness to seek a  likely place for their purpose. The Ness was a mile off, but in the  excitement of their pleasure they were oblivious of time.    The Williams', for the boys' convenience, usually dined at one, but on  this day they waited half an hour for Eric. Since, however, he didn't  appear, they dined without him, supposing that he was accidentally  detained, and expecting him to come in every minute. But two o'clock  came, and no Eric; half-past two, and no Eric; three, but still no Eric.  Mrs. Williams became seriously alarmed, and even her husband  grew uneasy.    Vernon was watching for his brother at the window, and seeing Duncan  pass by, ran down to ask him, \"If he knew where Eric was?\"    \"No,\" said Duncan; \"last time I saw him was on the shore. We bathed  together, and I remember his clothes were lying by mine when I dressed.  But I hav'n't seen him since. If you like we'll go and look for him. I  daresay he's on the beach somewhere.\"    But they found no traces of him there; and when they returned with this  intelligence, his mother got so agitated that it required all her  husband's firm gentleness to support her sinking spirits. There was  enough to cause anxiety, for Vernon repeatedly ran out to ask the boys  who were passing if they had seen his brother, and the answer always  was, that they had left him bathing in the sea.    Meanwhile our young friends, having caught several crabs, suddenly  noticed by the sun that it was getting late.    \"Good gracious, Edwin,\" said Eric, pulling out his watch, \"it's  half-past three; what have we been thinking of? How frightened they'll  be at home;\" and running back as fast as they could, they reached the  house at five o'clock, and rushed into the room.    \"Eric, Eric,\" said Mrs. Williams faintly, \"where have you been? has  anything happened to you, my child?\"    \"No, mother, nothing. I've only been crabfishing with Russell, and we  forgot the time.\"    \"Thoughtless boy,\" said his father, \"your mother has been in an agony  about you.\"    Eric saw her pale face and tearful eyes, and flung himself in her arms,  and mother and son wept in a long embrace. \"Only two months,\" whispered  Mrs. Williams, \"and we shall leave you, dear boy, perhaps forever. O do  not forget your love for us in the midst of new companions.\"    The end of term arrived; this time Eric came out eighth only instead of  first, and, therefore, on the prize day, was obliged to sit among the  crowd of undistinguished boys. He saw that his parents were  disappointed, and his own ambition was grievously mortified. But he had  full confidence in his own powers, and made the strongest resolutions to  work hard the next half-year, when he had got out of \"that  Gordon's\" clutches.    The Williams' spent the holidays at Fairholm, and now, indeed, in the  prospect of losing them, Eric's feelings to his parents came out in all  their strength. Most happily the days glided by, and the father and  mother used them wisely. All their gentle influence, all their deep  affection, were employed in leaving on the boy's heart lasting  impressions of godliness and truth. He learnt to feel that their love  would encircle him for ever with its heavenly tenderness, and their pure  prayers rise for him night and day to the throne of God.    The day of parting came, and most bitter and heartrending it was. In the  wildness of their passionate sorrow, Eric and Vernon seemed to hear the  sound of everlasting farewells. It is God's mercy that ordains how  seldom young hearts have to endure such misery.    At length it was over. The last sound of wheels had died away; and  during those hours the hearts of parents and children felt the  bitterness of death. Mrs. Trevor and Fanny, themselves filled with  grief, still used all their unselfish endeavors to comfort their dear  boys. Vernon, weary of crying, soon sank to sleep; but not so Eric. He  sat on a low stool, his face buried in his hands, breaking the stillness  every now and then with his convulsive sobs.    \"O Aunty,\" he cried, \"do you think I shall ever see them again? I have  been so wicked, and so little grateful for all their love. O, I wish I  had thought at Roslyn how soon I was to lose them.\"    \"Yes, dearest,\" said Mrs. Trevor, \"I have no doubt we shall all meet  again soon. Your father is only going for five years, you know, and that  will not seem very long. And then they will be writing continually to  us, and we to them. Think, Eric, how gladdened their hearts will be to  hear that you and Vernon are good boys, and getting on well.\"    \"O, I _will_ be a better boy, I _will_ indeed,\" said Eric; \"I mean to do  great things, and they shall have nothing but good reports of me.\"    \"God helping you, dear,\" said his aunt, pushing back his hair from his  forehead, and kissing it softly; \"without his help, Eric, we are all  weak indeed.\"    She sighed. But how far deeper her sigh would have been had she known  the future. Merciful is the darkness that shrouds it from human eyes!        CHAPTER VII    ERIC A BOARDER         \"We were, fair queen,       Two lads that thought there was no more behind,       But such a day to-morrow as to-day,       And to be boy eternal.\"--WINTER'S TALE, i. 2.    The holidays were over. Vernon was to have a tutor at Fairholm, and Eric  was to return alone, and be received into Dr. Rowlands' house.    As he went on board the steam-packet, he saw numbers of the well-known  faces on deck, and merry voices greeted him.    \"Hallo, Williams! here you are at last,\" said Duncan, seizing his hand.  \"How have you enjoyed the holidays?
