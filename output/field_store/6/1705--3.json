I next made a mould  of one of the footprints which have been described as those of the  deceased.\"    \"Have been described!\" exclaimed the chairman. \"The deceased was  certainly there, and there were no other footprints, so, if they were  not his, he must have flown to where he was found.\"    \"I will call them the footprints of the deceased,\" replied Thorndyke  imperturbably. \"I took a mould of one of them, and with it, on the same  mould, one of my own footprints. Here is the mould, and here is a cast  from it.\" (He turned and took them from the triumphant Polton, who had  tenderly lifted them out of the trunk in readiness.) \"On looking at the  cast, it will be seen that the appearances are not such as would be  expected. The deceased was five feet nine inches high, but was very thin  and light, weighing only nine stone six pounds, as I ascertained by  weighing the body, whereas I am five feet eleven and weigh nearly  thirteen stone. But yet the footprint of the deceased is nearly twice as  deep as mine--that is to say, the lighter man has sunk into the sand  nearly twice as deeply as the heavier man.\"    The magistrates were now deeply attentive. They were no longer simply  listening to the despised utterances of a mere scientific expert. The  cast lay before them with the two footprints side by side; the evidence  appealed to their own senses and was proportionately convincing.    \"This is very singular,\" said the chairman; \"but perhaps you can explain  the discrepancy?\"    \"I think I can,\" replied Thorndyke; \"but I should prefer to place all  the facts before you first.\"    \"Undoubtedly that would be better,\" the chairman agreed. \"Pray proceed.\"    \"There was another remarkable peculiarity about these footprints,\"  Thorndyke continued, \"and that was their distance apart--the length of  the stride, in fact. I measured the steps carefully from heel to heel,  and found them only nineteen and a half inches. But a man of Hearn's  height would have an ordinary stride of about thirty-six inches--more if  he was walking fast. Walking with a stride of nineteen and a half inches  he would look as if his legs were tied together.    \"I next proceeded to the Bay, and took two moulds from the footprints  of the man with the nailed shoes, a right and a left. Here is a cast  from the mould, and it shows very clearly that the man was walking  backwards.\"    \"How does it show that?\" asked the magistrate.    \"There are several distinctive points. For instance, the absence of the  usual 'kick off' at the toe, the slight drag behind the heel, showing  the direction in which the foot was lifted, and the undisturbed  impression of the sole.\"    \"You have spoken of moulds and casts. What is the difference between  them?\"    \"A mould is a direct, and therefore reversed, impression. A cast is the  impression of a mould, and therefore a facsimile of the object. If I  pour liquid plaster on a coin, when it sets I have a mould, a sunk  impression, of the coin. If I pour melted wax into the mould I obtain a  cast, a facsimile of the coin. A footprint is a mould of the foot. A  mould of the footprint is a cast of the foot, and a cast from the mould  reproduces the footprint.\"    \"Thank you,\" said the magistrate. \"Then your moulds from these two  footprints are really facsimiles of the murderer's shoes, and can be  compared with these shoes which have been put in evidence?\"    \"Yes, and when we compare them they demonstrate a very important fact.\"    \"What is that?\"    \"It is that the prisoner's shoes were not the shoes that made those  footprints.\" A buzz of astonishment ran through the court, but Thorndyke  continued stolidly: \"The prisoner's shoes were not in my possession, so  I went on to Barker's pond, on the clay margin of which I had seen  footprints actually made by the prisoner. I took moulds of those  footprints, and compared them with these from the sand. There are  several important differences, which you will see if you compare them.  To facilitate the comparison I have made transparent photographs of both  sets of moulds to the same scale. Now, if we put the photograph of the  mould of the prisoner's right shoe over that of the murderer's right  shoe, and hold the two superposed photographs up to the light, we cannot  make the two pictures coincide. They are exactly of the same length, but  the shoes are of different shape. Moreover, if we put one of the nails  in one photograph over the corresponding nail in the other photograph,  we cannot make the rest of the nails coincide. But the most conclusive  fact of all--from which there is no possible escape--is that the number  of nails in the two shoes is not the same. In the sole of the prisoner's  right shoe there are forty nails; in that of the murderer there are  forty-one. The murderer has one nail too many.\"    There was a deathly silence in the court as the magistrates and Mr.  Bashfield pored over the moulds and the prisoner's shoes, and examined  the photographs against the light. Then the chairman asked: \"Are these  all the facts, or have you something more to tell us?\" He was evidently  anxious to get the key to this riddle.    \"There is more evidence, your Worship,\" said Anstey. \"The witness  examined the body of deceased.\" Then, turning to Thorndyke, he asked:    \"You were present at the _post-mortem_ examination?\"    \"I was.\"    \"Did you form any opinion as to the cause of death?\"    \"Yes. I came to the conclusion that death was occasioned by an overdose  of morphia.\"    A universal gasp of amazement greeted this statement. Then the presiding  magistrate protested breathlessly:    \"But there was a wound, which we have been told was capable of causing  instantaneous death. Was that not the case?\"    \"There was undoubtedly such a wound,\" replied Thorndyke. \"But when that  wound was inflicted the deceased had already been dead from a quarter to  half an hour.\"    \"This is incredible!\" exclaimed the magistrate. \"But, no doubt, you can  give us your reasons for this amazing conclusion?\"    \"My opinion,\" said Thorndyke, \"was based on several facts. In the first  place, a wound inflicted on a living body gapes rather widely, owing to  the retraction of the living skin. The skin of a dead body does not  retract, and the wound, consequently, does not gape. This wound gaped  very slightly, showing that death was recent, I should say, within half  an hour. Then a wound on the living body becomes filled with blood, and  blood is shed freely on the clothing. But the wound on the deceased  contained only a little blood-clot. There was hardly any blood on the  clothing, and I had already noticed that there was none on the sand  where the body had lain.\"    \"And you consider this quite conclusive?\" the magistrate asked  doubtfully.    \"I do,\" answered Thorndyke. \"But there was other evidence which was  beyond all question. The weapon had partially divided both the aorta and  the pulmonary artery--the main arteries of the body. Now, during life,  these great vessels are full of blood at a high internal pressure,  whereas after death they become almost empty. It follows that, if this  wound had been inflicted during life, the cavity in which those vessels  lie would have become filled with blood. As a matter of fact, it  contained practically no blood, only the merest oozing from some small  veins, so that it is certain that the wound was inflicted after death.  The presence and nature of the poison I ascertained by analyzing certain  secretions from the body, and the analysis enabled me to judge that the  quantity of the poison was large; but the contents of the stomach were  sent to Professor Copland for more exact examination.\"    \"Is the result of Professor Copland's analysis known?\" the magistrate  asked Anstey.    \"The professor is here, your Worship,\" replied Anstey, \"and is prepared  to swear to having obtained over one grain of morphia from the contents  of the stomach; and as this, which is in itself a poisonous dose, is  only the unabsorbed residue of what was actually swallowed, the total  quantity taken must have been very large indeed.\"    \"Thank you,\" said the magistrate. \"And now, Dr. Thorndyke, if you have  given us all the facts, perhaps you will tell us what conclusions you  have drawn from them.\"    \"The facts which I have stated,\" said Thorndyke, \"appear to me to  indicate the following sequence of events. The deceased died about  midnight on September 27, from the effects of a poisonous dose of  morphia, how or by whom administered I offer no opinion. I think that  his body was conveyed in a boat to Sundersley Gap. The boat probably  contained three men, of whom one remained in charge of it, one walked  up the Gap and along the cliff towards St. Bridget's Bay, and the third,  having put on the shoes of the deceased, carried the body along the  shore to the Bay. This would account for the great depth and short  stride of the tracks that have been spoken of as those of the deceased.  Having reached the Bay, I believe that this man laid the corpse down on  his tracks, and then trampled the sand in the neighbourhood. He next  took off deceased's shoes and put them on the corpse; then he put on a  pair of boots or shoes which he had been carrying--perhaps hung round  his neck--and which had been prepared with nails to imitate Draper's  shoes. In these shoes he again trampled over the area near the corpse.  Then he walked backwards to the Shepherd's Path, and from it again,  still backwards, to the face of the cliff. Here his accomplice had  lowered a rope, by which he climbed up to the top. At the top he took  off the nailed shoes, and the two men walked back to the Gap, where the  man who had carried the rope took his confederate on his back, and  carried him down "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13888"],[0,"Bacon (#10)"],[1,"Coke; and he played it more skilfully and effectively. Trials  in those days were confused affairs, often passing into a mere wrangle  between the judges, lawyers, and lookers-on, and the prisoner at the  bar. It was so in this case. Coke is said to have blundered in his way  of presenting the evidence, and to have been led away from the point  into an altercation with Essex. Probably it really did not much matter;  but the trial was getting out of its course and inclining in favour of  the prisoner, till Bacon--Mr. Spedding thinks, out of his regular  turn--stepped forward and retrieved matters. This is Mr. Spedding's  account of what Bacon said and did:         \"By this time the argument had drifted so far away from the point       that it must have been difficult for a listener to remember what it       was that the prisoners were charged with, or how much of the charge       had been proved. And Coke, who was all this time the sole speaker       on behalf of the Crown, was still following each fresh topic that       rose before him, without the sign of an intention or the intimation       of a wish to return to the main question and reform the broken       ranks of his evidence. Luckily he seems to have been now at a loss       what point to take next, and the pause gave Bacon an opportunity of       rising. It can hardly have been in pursuance of previous       arrangements; for though it was customary in those days to       distribute the evidence into parts and to assign several parts to       several counsel, there had been no appearance as yet of any part       being concluded. It is probable that the course of the trial had       upset previous arrangements and confused the parts. At any rate so       it was, however it came to pass, that when Cecil and Essex had at       last finished their expostulation and parted with charitable       prayers, each that the other might be forgiven, then (says our       reporter) Mr. Bacon entered into a speech much after this fashion:         \"'In speaking of this late and horrible rebellion which hath been       in the eyes and ears of all men, I shall save myself much labour in       opening and enforcing the points thereof, insomuch as I speak not       before a country jury of ignorant men, but before a most honourable       assembly of the greatest Peers of the land, whose wisdoms conceive       far more than my tongue can utter; yet with your gracious and       honourable favours I will presume, if not for information of your       Honours, yet for the discharge of my duty, to say thus much. No man       can be ignorant, that knows matters of former ages--and all history       makes it plain--that there was never any traitor heard of that       durst directly attempt the seat of his liege prince but he always       coloured his practices with some plausible pretence. For God hath       imprinted such a majesty in the face of a prince that no private       man dare approach the person of his sovereign with a traitorous       intent. And therefore they run another side course, _oblique et a       latere_: some to reform corruptions of the State and religion; some       to reduce the ancient liberties and customs pretended to be lost       and worn out; some to remove those persons that being in high       places make themselves subject to envy; but all of them aim at the       overthrow of the State and destruction of the present rulers. And       this likewise is the use of those that work mischief of another       quality; as Cain, that first murderer, took up an excuse for his       fact, shaming to outface it with impudency, thus the Earl made his       colour the severing some great men and councillors from her       Majesty's favour, and the fear he stood in of his pretended enemies       lest they should murder him in his house. Therefore he saith he       was compelled to fly into the City for succour and assistance; not       much unlike Pisistratus, of whom it was so anciently written how he       gashed and wounded himself, and in that sort ran crying into Athens       that his life was sought and like to have been taken away; thinking       to have moved the people to have pitied him and taken his part by       such counterfeited harm and danger; whereas his aim and drift was       to take the government of the city into his hands and alter the       form thereof. With like pretences of dangers and assaults the Earl       of Essex entered the City of London and passed through the bowels       thereof, blanching rumours that he should have been murdered and       that the State was sold; whereas he had no such enemies, no such       dangers: persuading themselves that if they could prevail all would       have done well. But now _magna scelera terminantur in haeresin_; for       you, my Lord, should know that though princes give their subjects       cause of discontent, though they take away the honours they have       heaped upon them, though they bring them to a lower estate than       they raised them from, yet ought they not to be so forgetful of       their allegiance that they should enter into any undutiful act;       much less upon rebellion, as you, my Lord, have done. All       whatsoever you have or can say in answer hereof are but shadows.       And therefore methinks it were best for you to confess, not to       justify.'\"    Essex was provoked by Bacon's incredulous sneer about enemies and  dangers--\"I call forth Mr. Bacon against Mr. Bacon,\" and referred to the  letters which Bacon had written in his name, and in which these  dangerous enmities were taken for granted. Bacon, in answer, repeated  what he said so often--\"That he had spent more time in vain in studying  how to make the Earl a good servant to the Queen and State than he had  done in anything else.\" Once more Coke got the proceedings into a  tangle, and once more Bacon came forward to repair the miscarriage of  his leader.         \"'I have never yet seen in any case such favour shown to any       prisoner; so many digressions, such delivering of evidence by       fractions, and so silly a defence of such great and notorious       treasons. May it please your Grace, you have seen how weakly he       hath shadowed his purpose and how slenderly he hath answered the       objections against him. But, my Lord, I doubt the variety of       matters and the many digressions may minister occasion of       forgetfulness, and may have severed the judgments of the Lords; and       therefore I hold it necessary briefly to recite the Judges'       opinions.'         \"That being done, he proceeded to this effect:         \"'Now put the case that the Earl of Essex's intents were, as he       would have it believed, to go only as a suppliant to her Majesty.       Shall their petitions be presented by armed petitioners? This must       needs bring loss of property to the prince. Neither is it any point       of law, as my Lord of Southampton would have it believed, that       condemns them of treason. To take secret counsel, to execute it, to       run together in numbers armed with weapons--what can be the excuse?       Warned by the Lord Keeper, by a herald, and yet persist! Will any       simple man take this to be less than treason?'         \"The Earl of Essex answered that if he had purposed anything       against others than those his private enemies, he would not have       stirred with so slender a company. Whereunto Mr. Bacon answered:         \"'It was not the company you carried with you but the assistance       you hoped for in the City which you trusted unto. The Duke of Guise       thrust himself into the streets of Paris on the day of the       Barricades in his doublet and hose, attended only with eight       gentlemen, and found that help in the city which (thanks be to God)       you failed of here. And what followed? The King was forced to put       himself into a pilgrim's weeds, and in that disguise to steal away       to scape their fury. Even such was my Lord's confidence too, and       his pretence the same--an all-hail and a kiss to the City. But the       end was treason, as hath been sufficiently proved. But when he had       once delivered and engaged himself so far into that which the       shallowness of his conceit could not accomplish as he expected, the       Queen for her defence taking arms against him, he was glad to yield       himself; and thinking to colour his practices, turned his pretexts,       and alleged the occasion thereof to proceed from a private       quarrel.'         \"To this\" (adds the reporter) \"the Earl answered little. Nor was       anything said afterwards by either of the prisoners, either in the       thrust-and-parry dialogue with Coke that followed, or when they       spoke at large to the question why judgment should not be       pronounced, which at all altered the complexion of the case. They       were both found guilty and sentence passed in the usual form.\"    Bacon's legal position was so subordinate a place that there must have  been a special reason for his employment. It is difficult to avoid the  conclusion that, on the part of the Government, Bacon was thus used for  the very reason that he had been the friend of Essex. He was not  commonly called upon in such prosecutions. He was not employed by Cecil  in the Winchester trials of Raleigh, Grey, and Cobham, three years  afterwards, nor in those connected with the Gunpowder Plot. He was  called upon now because no one could so much damage Essex; and this last  proof of his ready service was required by those whose favour, since  Essex had gone hopelessly wrong, he had been diligently seeking. And  Bacon acquiesced in the demand, apparently without surprise. No record  remains to show that he felt any difficulty in playing his part. He had  persuaded himself that his public duty, his duty as a good citizen to  the Queen and the commonwealth, demanded of him that he"]]]
