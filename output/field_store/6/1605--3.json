There was a smoking streak of  phosphorescent light, the match flared for a moment, and he saw a vast  wing sweeping towards him, a gleam of grey-brown fur, and then he was  struck in the face and the match knocked out of his hand. The blow was  aimed at his temple, and a claw tore sideways down to his cheek. He reeled  and fell, and he heard the extinguished lantern smash. Another blow  followed as he fell. He was partly stunned, he felt his own warm blood  stream out upon his face. Instinctively he felt his eyes had been struck  at, and, turning over on his face to save them, tried to crawl under the  protection of the telescope.    He was struck again upon the back, and he heard his jacket rip, and then  the thing hit the roof of the observatory. He edged as far as he could  between the wooden seat and the eyepiece of the instrument, and turned his  body round so that it was chiefly his feet that were exposed. With these  he could at least kick. He was still in a mystified state. The strange  beast banged about in the darkness, and presently clung to the telescope,  making it sway and the gear rattle. Once it flapped near him, and he  kicked out madly and felt a soft body with his feet. He was horribly  scared now. It must be a big thing to swing the telescope like that. He  saw for a moment the outline of a head black against the starlight, with  sharply-pointed upstanding ears and a crest between them. It seemed to him  to be as big as a mastiff's. Then he began to bawl out as loudly as he  could for help.    At that the thing came down upon him again. As it did so his hand touched  something beside him on the floor. He kicked out, and the next moment his  ankle was gripped and held by a row of keen teeth. He yelled again, and  tried to free his leg by kicking with the other. Then he realised he had  the broken water-bottle at his hand, and, snatching it, he struggled into  a sitting posture, and feeling in the darkness towards his foot, gripped a  velvety ear, like the ear of a big cat. He had seized the water-bottle by  its neck and brought it down with a shivering crash upon the head of the  strange beast. He repeated the blow, and then stabbed and jabbed with the  jagged end of it, in the darkness, where he judged the face might be.    The small teeth relaxed their hold, and at once Woodhouse pulled his leg  free and kicked hard. He felt the sickening feel of fur and bone giving  under his boot. There was a tearing bite at his arm, and he struck over it  at the face, as he judged, and hit damp fur.    There was a pause; then he heard the sound of claws; and the dragging of a  heavy body away from him over the observatory floor. Then there was  silence, broken only by his own sobbing breathing, and a sound like  licking. Everything was black except the parallelogram of the blue  skylight with the luminous dust of stars, against which the end of the  telescope now appeared in silhouette. He waited, as it seemed, an  interminable time.    Was the thing coming on again? He felt in his trouser-pocket for some  matches, and found one remaining. He tried to strike this, but the floor  was wet, and it spat and went out. He cursed. He could not see where the  door was situated. In his struggle he had quite lost his bearings. The  strange beast, disturbed by the splutter of the match, began to move  again. \"Time!\" called Woodhouse, with a sudden gleam of mirth, but the  thing was not coming at him again. He must have hurt it, he thought, with  the broken bottle. He felt a dull pain in his ankle. Probably he was  bleeding there. He wondered if it would support him if he tried to stand  up. The night outside was very still. There was no sound of any one  moving. The sleepy fools had not heard those wings battering upon the  dome, nor his shouts. It was no good wasting strength in shouting. The  monster flapped its wings and startled him into a defensive attitude. He  hit his elbow against the seat, and it fell over with a crash. He cursed  this, and then he cursed the darkness.    Suddenly the oblong patch of starlight seemed to sway to and fro. Was he  going to faint? It would never do to faint. He clenched his fists and set  his teeth to hold himself together. Where had the door got to? It occurred  to him he could get his bearings by the stars visible through the  skylight. The patch of stars he saw was in Sagittarius and south-eastward;  the door was north--or was it north by west? He tried to think. If he  could get the door open he might retreat. It might be the thing was  wounded. The suspense was beastly. \"Look here!\" he said, \"if you don't  come on, I shall come at you.\"    Then the thing began clambering up the side of the observatory, and he saw  its black outline gradually blot out the skylight. Was it in retreat? He  forgot about the door, and watched as the dome shifted and creaked.  Somehow he did not feel very frightened or excited now. He felt a curious  sinking sensation inside him. The sharply-defined patch of light, with the  black form moving across it, seemed to be growing smaller and smaller.  That was curious. He began to feel very thirsty, and yet he did not feel  inclined to get anything to drink. He seemed to be sliding down a long  funnel.    He felt a burning sensation in his throat, and then he perceived it was  broad daylight, and that one of the Dyak servants was looking at him with  a curious expression. Then there was the top of Thaddy's face upside down.  Funny fellow, Thaddy, to go about like that! Then he grasped the situation  better, and perceived that his head was on Thaddy's knee, and Thaddy was  giving him brandy. And then he saw the eyepiece of the telescope with a  lot of red smears on it. He began to remember.    \"You've made this observatory in a pretty mess,\" said Thaddy.    The Dyak boy was beating up an egg in brandy. Woodhouse took this and sat  up. He felt a sharp twinge of pain. His ankle was tied up, so were his  arm and the side of his face. The smashed glass, red-stained, lay about  the floor, the telescope seat was overturned, and by the opposite wall was  a dark pool. The door was open, and he saw the grey summit of the mountain  against a brilliant background of blue sky.    \"Pah!\" said Woodhouse. \"Who's been killing calves here? Take me out of  it.\"    Then he remembered the Thing, and the fight he had had with it.    \"What _was_ it?\" he said to Thaddy--\"the Thing I fought with?\".    \"_You_ know that best,\" said Thaddy. \"But, anyhow, don't worry  yourself now about it. Have some more to drink.\"    Thaddy, however, was curious enough, and it was a hard struggle between  duty and inclination to keep Woodhouse quiet until he was decently put  away in bed, and had slept upon the copious dose of meat extract Thaddy  considered advisable. They then talked it over together.    \"It was,\" said Woodhouse, \"more like a big bat than anything else in the  world. It had sharp, short ears, and soft fur, and its wings were  leathery. Its teeth were little but devilish sharp, and its jaw could not  have been very strong or else it would have bitten through my ankle.\"    \"It has pretty nearly,\" said Thaddy.    \"It seemed to me to hit out with its claws pretty freely. That is about as  much as I know about the beast. Our conversation was intimate, so to  speak, and yet not confidential.\"    \"The Dyak chaps talk about a Big Colugo, a Klang-utang--whatever that may  be. It does not often attack man, but I suppose you made it nervous. They  say there is a Big Colugo and a Little Colugo, and a something else that  sounds like gobble. They all fly about at night. For my own part, I know  there are flying foxes and flying lemurs about here, but they are none of  them very big beasts.\"    \"There are more things in heaven and earth,\" said Woodhouse--and Thaddy  groaned at the quotation--\"and more particularly in the forests of Borneo,  than are dreamt of in our philosophies. On the whole, if the Borneo fauna  is going to disgorge any more of its novelties upon me, I should prefer  that it did so when I was not occupied in the observatory at night and  alone.\"            VI.      AEPYORNIS ISLAND.      The man with the scarred face leant over the table and looked at my  bundle.    \"Orchids?\" he asked.    \"A few,\" I said.    \"Cypripediums,\" he said.    \"Chiefly,\" said I.    \"Anything new? I thought not. _I_ did these islands twenty-five--  twenty-seven years ago. If you find anything new here--well, it's brand  new. I didn't leave much.\"    \"I'm not a collector,\" said I.    \"I was young then,\" he went on. \"Lord! how I used to fly round.\" He seemed  to take my measure. \"I was in the East Indies two years, and in Brazil  seven. Then I went to Madagascar.\"    \"I know a few explorers by name,\" I said, anticipating a yarn. \"Whom did  you collect for?\"    \"Dawson's. I wonder if you've heard the name of Butcher ever?\"    \"Butcher--Butcher?\" The name seemed vaguely present in my memory;  then I recalled _Butcher_ v. _Dawson_. \"Why!\" said I, \"you are the  man who sued them for four years' salary--got cast away on a desert  island...\"    \"Your servant,\" said the man with the scar, bowing. \"Funny case, wasn't  it? Here was me, making a little fortune on that island, doing nothing  for it neither, and them quite unable to give me notice. It often used  to amuse me thinking over it while I was there. I did calculations of  it--big--all over the blessed atoll in ornamental figuring.\"    \"How did it happen?\" said I. \"I don't rightly remember the case.\"    \"Well... You've heard of the AEpyornis?\"    \"Rather. Andrews was telling me of a new species he was working on only a  month or so ago. Just before I sailed. They've got a thigh bone, it seems,  nearly a yard long. Monster the thing must have been!\"    \"I believe you,\" said the man with the scar. \"It _was_ a monster.  Sindbad's roc was just a legend of 'em. But when did they find these  bones?\"    \"Three or four years ago--'91, I fancy.

When still a  young girl, Lady Arabella wandered into a small wood near her home, and  did not return.  She was found unconscious and in a high fever--the  doctor said that she had received a poisonous bite, and the girl being at  a delicate and critical age, the result was serious--so much so that she  was not expected to recover.  A great London physician came down but  could do nothing--indeed, he said that the girl would not survive the  night.  All hope had been abandoned, when, to everyone's surprise, Lady  Arabella made a sudden and startling recovery.  Within a couple of days  she was going about as usual!  But to the horror of her people, she  developed a terrible craving for cruelty, maiming and injuring birds and  small animals--even killing them.  This was put down to a nervous  disturbance due to her age, and it was hoped that her marriage to Captain  March would put this right.  However, it was not a happy marriage, and  eventually her husband was found shot through the head.  I have always  suspected suicide, though no pistol was found near the body.  He may have  discovered something--God knows what!--so possibly Lady Arabella may  herself have killed him.  Putting together many small matters that have  come to my knowledge, I have come to the conclusion that the foul White  Worm obtained control of her body, just as her soul was leaving its  earthly tenement--that would explain the sudden revival of energy, the  strange and inexplicable craving for maiming and killing, as well as many  other matters with which I need not trouble you now, Adam.  As I said  just now, God alone knows what poor Captain March discovered--it must  have been something too ghastly for human endurance, if my theory is  correct that the once beautiful human body of Lady Arabella is under the  control of this ghastly White Worm.\"    Adam nodded.    \"But what can we do, sir--it seems a most difficult problem.\"    \"We can do nothing, my boy--that is the important part of it.  It would  be impossible to take action--all we can do is to keep careful watch,  especially as regards Lady Arabella, and be ready to act, promptly and  decisively, if the opportunity occurs.\"    Adam agreed, and the two men returned to Lesser Hill.          CHAPTER IX--SMELLING DEATH      Adam Salton, though he talked little, did not let the grass grow under  his feet in any matter which he had undertaken, or in which he was  interested.  He had agreed with Sir Nathaniel that they should not do  anything with regard to the mystery of Lady Arabella's fear of the  mongoose, but he steadily pursued his course in being _prepared_ to act  whenever the opportunity might come.  He was in his own mind perpetually  casting about for information or clues which might lead to possible lines  of action.  Baffled by the killing of the mongoose, he looked around for  another line to follow.  He was fascinated by the idea of there being a  mysterious link between the woman and the animal, but he was already  preparing a second string to his bow.  His new idea was to use the  faculties of Oolanga, so far as he could, in the service of discovery.  His first move was to send Davenport to Liverpool to try to find the  steward of the _West African_, who had told him about Oolanga, and if  possible secure any further information, and then try to induce (by  bribery or other means) the nigger to come to the Brow.  So soon as he  himself could have speech of the Voodoo-man he would be able to learn  from him something useful.  Davenport was successful in his missions, for  he had to get another mongoose, and he was able to tell Adam that he had  seen the steward, who told him much that he wanted to know, and had also  arranged for Oolanga to come to Lesser Hill the following day.  At this  point Adam saw his way sufficiently clear to admit Davenport to some  extent into his confidence.  He had come to the conclusion that it would  be better--certainly at first--not himself to appear in the matter, with  which Davenport was fully competent to deal.  It would be time for  himself to take a personal part when matters had advanced a little  further.    If what the nigger said was in any wise true, the man had a rare gift  which might be useful in the quest they were after.  He could, as it  were, \"smell death.\"  If any one was dead, if any one had died, or if a  place had been used in connection with death, he seemed to know the broad  fact by intuition.  Adam made up his mind that to test this faculty with  regard to several places would be his first task.  Naturally he was  anxious, and the time passed slowly.  The only comfort was the arrival  the next morning of a strong packing case, locked, from Ross, the key  being in the custody of Davenport.  In the case were two smaller boxes,  both locked.  One of them contained a mongoose to replace that killed by  Lady Arabella; the other was the special mongoose which had already  killed the king-cobra in Nepaul.  When both the animals had been safely  put under lock and key, he felt that he might breathe more freely.  No  one was allowed to know the secret of their existence in the house,  except himself and Davenport.  He arranged that Davenport should take  Oolanga round the neighbourhood for a walk, stopping at each of the  places which he designated.  Having gone all along the Brow, he was to  return the same way and induce him to touch on the same subjects in  talking with Adam, who was to meet them as if by chance at the farthest  part--that beyond Mercy Farm.    The incidents of the day proved much as Adam expected.  At Mercy Farm, at  Diana's Grove, at Castra Regis, and a few other spots, the negro stopped  and, opening his wide nostrils as if to sniff boldly, said that he  smelled death.  It was not always in the same form.  At Mercy Farm he  said there were many small deaths.  At Diana's Grove his bearing was  different.  There was a distinct sense of enjoyment about him, especially  when he spoke of many great deaths.  Here, too, he sniffed in a strange  way, like a bloodhound at check, and looked puzzled.  He said no word in  either praise or disparagement, but in the centre of the Grove, where,  hidden amongst ancient oak stumps, was a block of granite slightly  hollowed on the top, he bent low and placed his forehead on the ground.  This was the only place where he showed distinct reverence.  At the  Castle, though he spoke of much death, he showed no sign of respect.    There was evidently something about Diana's Grove which both interested  and baffled him.  Before leaving, he moved all over the place  unsatisfied, and in one spot, close to the edge of the Brow, where there  was a deep hollow, he appeared to be afraid.  After returning several  times to this place, he suddenly turned and ran in a panic of fear to the  higher ground, crossing as he did so the outcropping rock.  Then he  seemed to breathe more freely, and recovered some of his jaunty  impudence.    All this seemed to satisfy Adam's expectations.  He went back to Lesser  Hill with a serene and settled calm upon him.  Sir Nathaniel followed him  into his study.    \"By the way, I forgot to ask you details about one thing.  When that  extraordinary staring episode of Mr. Caswall went on, how did Lilla take  it--how did she bear herself?\"    \"She looked frightened, and trembled just as I have seen a pigeon with a  hawk, or a bird with a serpent.\"    \"Thanks.  It is just as I expected.  There have been circumstances in the  Caswall family which lead one to believe that they have had from the  earliest times some extraordinary mesmeric or hypnotic faculty.  Indeed,  a skilled eye could read so much in their physiognomy.  That shot of  yours, whether by instinct or intention, of the hawk and the pigeon was  peculiarly apposite.  I think we may settle on that as a fixed trait to  be accepted throughout our investigation.\"    When dusk had fallen, Adam took the new mongoose--not the one from  Nepaul--and, carrying the box slung over his shoulder, strolled towards  Diana's Grove.  Close to the gateway he met Lady Arabella, clad as usual  in tightly fitting white, which showed off her slim figure.    To his intense astonishment the mongoose allowed her to pet him, take him  up in her arms and fondle him.  As she was going in his direction, they  walked on together.    Round the roadway between the entrances of Diana's Grove and Lesser Hill  were many trees, with not much foliage except at the top.  In the dusk  this place was shadowy, and the view was hampered by the clustering  trunks.  In the uncertain, tremulous light which fell through the tree-  tops, it was hard to distinguish anything clearly, and at last, somehow,  he lost sight of her altogether, and turned back on his track to find  her.  Presently he came across her close to her own gate.  She was  leaning over the paling of split oak branches which formed the paling of  the avenue.  He could not see the mongoose, so he asked her where it had  gone.    \"He slipt out of my arms while I was petting him,\" she answered, \"and  disappeared under the hedges.\"    They found him at a place where the avenue widened so as to let carriages  pass each other.  The little creature seemed quite changed.  He had been  ebulliently active; now he was dull and spiritless--seemed to be dazed.  He allowed himself to be lifted by either of the pair; but when he was  alone with Lady Arabella he kept looking round him in a strange way, as  though trying to escape.  When they had come out on the roadway Adam held  the mongoose tight to him, and, lifting his hat to his companion, moved  quickly towards Lesser Hill; he and Lady Arabella lost sight of each  other in the thickening gloom.    When Adam got home, he put the mongoose in his box, and locked the door  of the room.  The other mongoose--the one from Nepaul--was safely locked  in his own box, but he lay quiet and did not stir.  When he got to his  study "]]]
