He secured the front-feet bags in place similarly above the great  knees. Now, indeed, was Numa, the lion, reduced to the harmlessness  of Bara, the deer.    By now Numa was showing signs of returning life. He gasped for  breath and struggled; but the strips of pigskin that held his four  legs together were numerous and tough. Tarzan watched and was sure  that they would hold, yet Numa is mightily muscled and there was  the chance, always, that he might struggle free of his bonds after  which all would depend upon the efficacy of Tarzan's bags and draw  strings.    After Numa had again breathed normally and was able to roar  out his protests and his rage, his struggles increased to Titanic  proportions for a short time; but as a lion's powers of endurance  are in no way proportionate to his size and strength he soon tired  and lay quietly. Amid renewed growling and another futile attempt  to free himself, Numa was finally forced to submit to the further  indignity of having a rope secured about his neck; but this time  it was no noose that might tighten and strangle him; but a bowline  knot, which does not tighten or slip under strain.    The other end of the rope Tarzan fastened to the stem of the tree,  then he quickly cut the bonds securing Numa's legs and leaped aside  as the beast sprang to his feet. For a moment the lion stood with  legs far outspread, then he raised first one paw and then another,  shaking them energetically in an effort to dislodge the strange  footgear that Tarzan had fastened upon them. Finally he began to paw  at the bag upon his head. The ape-man, standing with ready spear,  watched Numa's efforts intently. Would the bags hold? He sincerely  hoped so. Or would all his labor prove fruitless?    As the clinging things upon his feet and face resisted his every  effort to dislodge them, Numa became frantic. He rolled upon the  ground, fighting, biting, scratching, and roaring; he leaped to his  feet and sprang into the air; he charged Tarzan, only to be brought  to a sudden stop as the rope securing him to the tree tautened.  Then Tarzan stepped in and rapped him smartly on the head with the  shaft of his spear.  Numa reared upon his hind feet and struck at  the ape-man and in return received a cuff on one ear that sent him  reeling sideways. When he returned to the attack he was again sent  sprawling. After the fourth effort it appeared to dawn upon the king  of beasts that he had met his master, his head and tail dropped and  when Tarzan advanced upon him he backed away, though still growling.    Leaving Numa tied to the tree Tarzan entered the tunnel and removed  the barricade from the opposite end, after which he returned to  the gulch and strode straight for the tree.  Numa lay in his path  and as Tarzan approached growled menacingly. The ape-man cuffed  him aside and unfastened the rope from the tree. Then ensued a  half-hour of stubbornly fought battle while Tarzan endeavored to  drive Numa through the tunnel ahead of him and Numa persistently  refused to be driven. At last, however, by dint of the unrestricted  use of his spear point, the ape-man succeeded in forcing the lion  to move ahead of him and eventually guided him into the passageway.  Once inside, the problem became simpler since Tarzan followed closely  in the rear with his sharp spear point, an unremitting incentive  to forward movement on the part of the lion. If Numa hesitated he  was prodded. If he backed up the result was extremely painful and  so, being a wise lion who was learning rapidly, he decided to keep  on going and at the end of the tunnel, emerging into the outer  world, he sensed freedom, raised his head and tail and started off  at a run.    Tarzan, still on his hands and knees just inside the entrance, was  taken unaware with the result that he was sprawled forward upon  his face and dragged a hundred yards across the rocky ground before  Numa was brought to a stand. It was a scratched and angry Tarzan  who scrambled to his feet. At first he was tempted to chastise  Numa; but, as the ape-man seldom permitted his temper to guide him  in any direction not countenanced by reason, he quickly abandoned  the idea.    Having taught Numa the rudiments of being driven, he now urged him  forward and there commenced as strange a journey as the unrecorded  history of the jungle contains. The balance of that day was eventful  both for Tarzan and for Numa. From open rebellion at first the lion  passed through stages of stubborn resistance and grudging obedience  to final surrender. He was a very tired, hungry, and thirsty lion  when night overtook them; but there was to be no food for him that  day or the next--Tarzan did not dare risk removing the head bag,  though he did cut another hole which permitted Numa to quench his  thirst shortly after dark. Then he tied him to a tree, sought food  for himself, and stretched out among the branches above his captive  for a few hours' sleep.    Early the following morning they resumed their journey, winding over  the low foothills south of Kilimanjaro, toward the east. The beasts  of the jungle who saw them took one look and fled. The scent spoor  of Numa, alone, might have been enough to have provoked flight in  many of the lesser animals, but the sight of this strange apparition  that smelled like a lion, but looked like nothing they ever had  seen before, being led through the jungles by a giant Tarmangani  was too much for even the more formidable denizens of the wild.    Sabor, the lioness, recognizing from a distance the scent of her  lord and master intermingled with that of a Tarmangani and the  hide of Horta, the boar, trotted through the aisles of the forest  to investigate. Tarzan and Numa heard her coming, for she voiced  a plaintive and questioning whine as the baffling mixture of odors  aroused her curiosity and her fears, for lions, however terrible  they may appear, are often timid animals and Sabor, being of the  gentler sex, was, naturally, habitually inquisitive as well.    Tarzan un-slung his spear for he knew that he might now easily have  to fight to retain his prize. Numa halted and turned his outraged  head in the direction of the coming she.  He voiced a throaty growl  that was almost a purr. Tarzan was upon the point of prodding him  on again when Sabor broke into view, and behind her the ape-man saw  that which gave him instant pause--four full-grown lions trailing  the lioness.    To have goaded Numa then into active resistance might have brought  the whole herd down upon him and so Tarzan waited to learn first  what their attitude would be. He had no idea of relinquishing his  lion without a battle; but knowing lions as he did, he knew that  there was no assurance as to just what the newcomers would do.    The lioness was young and sleek, and the four males were in their  prime--as handsome lions as he ever had seen. Three of the males  were scantily maned but one, the foremost, carried a splendid,  black mane that rippled in the breeze as he trotted majestically  forward. The lioness halted a hundred feet from Tarzan, while the  lions came on past her and stopped a few feet nearer. Their ears  were upstanding and their eyes filled with curiosity. Tarzan could  not even guess what they might do. The lion at his side faced them  fully, standing silent now and watchful.    Suddenly the lioness gave vent to another little whine, at which  Tarzan's lion voiced a terrific roar and leaped forward straight  toward the beast of the black mane. The sight of this awesome  creature with the strange face was too much for the lion toward  which he leaped, dragging Tarzan after him, and with a growl the  lion turned and fled, followed by his companions and the she.    Numa attempted to follow them; Tarzan held him in leash and when  he turned upon him in rage, beat him unmercifully across the head  with his spear. Shaking his head and growling, the lion at last moved  off again in the direction they had been traveling; but it was an  hour before he ceased to sulk. He was very hungry--half famished  in fact--and consequently of an ugly temper, yet so thoroughly  subdued by Tarzan's heroic methods of lion taming that he was  presently pacing along at the ape-man's side like some huge St.  Bernard.    It was dark when the two approached the British right, after a  slight delay farther back because of a German patrol it had been  necessary to elude. A short distance from the British line of  out-guard sentinels Tarzan tied Numa to a tree and continued on  alone. He evaded a sentinel, passed the out-guard and support, and  by devious ways came again to Colonel Capell's headquarters, where  he appeared before the officers gathered there as a disembodied  spirit materializing out of thin air.    When they saw who it was that came thus unannounced they smiled  and the colonel scratched his head in perplexity.    \"Someone should be shot for this,\" he said. \"I might just as well  not establish an out-post if a man can filter through whenever he  pleases.\"    Tarzan smiled. \"Do not blame them,\" he said, \"for I am not a man.  I am Tarmangani. Any Mangani who wished to, could enter your camp  almost at will; but if you have them for sentinels no one could  enter without their knowledge.\"    \"What are the Mangani?\" asked the colonel. \"Perhaps we might enlist  a bunch of the beggars.\"    Tarzan shook his head. \"They are the great apes,\" he explained; \"my  people; but you could not use them. They cannot concentrate long  enough upon a single idea. If I told them of this they would be  much interested for a short time--I might even hold the interest  of a few long enough to get them here and explain their duties to  them; but soon they would lose interest and when you needed them  most they might be off in the forest searching for beetles instead  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14012"],[0,"Ice-Caves of France and Switzerland (#10)"],[1," and landing apparently on stones far below; so I called for the cords,  and told Louis that we must cut our way down. But, alas! the cords had  been left at the other glaciere! One long bag, with a hole in the middle  like an old-fashioned purse, had carried the luncheon at one end and the  ropes at the other; and when the luncheon was finished, the bag had been  stowed away under safe trees till our return. This was of course  immensely annoying, and I rang the changes on the few words of abuse  which invention or knowledge supplied, as we sat damp and shivering on  the verge of the slope, idly sending down pieces of broken columns which  brought forth tantalising sounds from the subterranean regions. At  length Renaud was moved to shame, and declared that he would cut his way  down, rope or no rope; but this seemed so horribly hazardous a  proceeding under all the circumstances, that I forbad his attempting it.  Seeing, however, that he was determined to do something, we arranged  ourselves into an apparatus something like a sliding telescope. Louis  cut a first step down the slope, and there took his stand till such time  as Mignot got a firm grasp of the tail of his blouse with both hands, I  meanwhile holding Mignot's tail with one hand, and the long stick with  the candle attached to it with the other; thus professedly supporting  the whole apparatus, and giving the necessary light for the work. Even  so, we tried again to persuade Renaud to give it up, but he was warmed  to his work, and really the arrangement answered remarkably well: when  he wished to descend to a new step, Mignot let out a little blouse, and,  being himself similarly relieved, descended likewise a step, and then  the remaining link of the chain followed. The leader slipped once, but  fortunately grasped a projecting piece of rock, for the stream was here  confined within narrow walls, and so the strength of the apparatus was  not tested; it could scarcely have stood any serious call upon its  powers.    After a considerable period of very slow progress, Renaud asked for the  candlestick, never more literally a stick than now, and thrust it under  the arch, stooping down so as to see what the farther darkness might  contain. We above could see nothing, but, after an anxious pause, he  cried _On peut aller!_ with a lively satisfaction so completely shared  by Mignot, that that worthy person was on the point of letting Renaud's  blouse go, in order to indulge in gestures of delight. The step-cutting  went on merrily after this announcement, and one by one we came to the  arch and passed through, finding it rather a trough than an arch; the  breadth was about 4 feet, and the height from 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 feet, and,  as we pushed through, our breasts were pressed on to the ice, while our  backs scraped against the rock which formed the roof.    [Illustration: SECOND CAVE OF THE UPPER GLACIERE OF THE PRE DE S.  LIVRES.]    As soon as this trough was passed, the ice spread out like a fan, and  finally landed us in a subterranean cavern, 72 feet long by 36 feet broad,  to which this was the only entrance. The breadth of the fan at the  bottom was 27 feet; and near the archway a very striking column poured  from a vertical fissure in the wall, and joined the main stream. The  fissure was partially open to the cave, and showed the solid round  column within the rock: this column measured 18-1/2 feet in  circumference, a little below the point where it became free of the  fissure, and it had a stream of ice 22 feet long pouring from its base.  The colour of the column was unusual, being a dull yellowish green, and  the peculiar structure of the ice gave the whole mass the appearance of  coursing down very rapidly, as if the water had been frozen while thus  moving, and had not therefore ceased so to move. At the bottom of the  fan, the flooring of the cave consisted of broken stones for a small  space, and then came a black lake of ice, which occupied all the centre  of the cave, and afforded us no opportunity of even guessing at its  depth. From the manner, however, in which it blended with the stones at  its edge, I am not inclined to believe that this depth was anything very  great.    Renaud, in his impetuosity, had ceased to cut steps towards the bottom  of the slope, and had slipped down the last few feet, of course cutting  the remaining steps before attempting to reascend. We found him  strutting about the floor of the cave, tossing his wet cap in the air,  and crying _No one! No one! I the first!_, declining to take any part in  measurements until the full of his delight and pride had been poured  out. He shouted so loud that I was obliged to stop him, lest by some  chance the unwonted disturbance of the air should bring down an unstable  block from the roof of the arch, and seal us up for ever. There was no  sign of incipient thaw in the cave, and the air was very dry, so much so  as at once to call attention to the fact. At the farthest end, a lofty  dome opened up in the roof; and possibly at some time or other the rock  may here fall through, and afford another means of entrance. Beneath  this dome a very lovely cluster of columns had grouped itself, formed of  the clear porcelain-like ice, and fretted and festooned with the utmost  delicacy, as if Andersen's Ice Maiden had been there in one of her  amiable moods, and had built herself a palace. This dome in the roof was  similar to many which I afterwards observed in other glacieres, being a  vertical fissure with flutings from top to bottom--not a spherical dome,  but of that more elegant shape which the female dress of modern times  assumes on a tall person.    [Illustration: VERTICAL SECTIONS OF THE UPPER GLACIERE OF THE PRE DE S.  LIVRES. [21]]    Between the base of the circular column and the wall, we found a rare  instance of clear jelly-like ice, without any lines external or  internal, such as is formed in the open air under very favourable  circumstances. The ordinary number of undergraduate May Terms had  afforded various opportunities for studying the comparative clearness of  different pieces of ice, but certainly no one ever saw a lemon pippin  through an inch and a half of that material so clearly as we now saw the  white rock through 1-1/2 feet. Mignot, indeed, said 2 feet; but it was  his way to make a large estimate of dimensions, and he constantly  interrupted my record of measurements by the assertion that I had made  them _moins que plus_. We were all disappointed by the actual size of  the ice-fall which it had cost us so much time and trouble to descend,  the distance from the first step to the last being only 26 feet: as  this, however, was given by a string stretched from the one point to the  other, and not following the concave surface of the ice, the real  distance was something more than this.    It was now getting rather late, considering the journey one of us had  yet to perform, and we walked quickly away from the glaciere, agreeing  that it was not improbable that in that part of the Jura there might be  many hidden caves containing more or less ice, with no entrance from the  world outside, except the fissures which afford a way for the water. The  entrance to this cave was so small, that the same physical effect might  well be produced by one or two cracks in the rock, such as every one is  well acquainted with who has walked on the fissured limestone summits  of the lower mountains; and, indeed, Renaud positively affirmed that at  the time of his former visit there was not even this entrance to the  lower cave, for the ice-stream reached then a higher point of the wall,  and completely filled and hid the arch we had discovered. It is very  difficult to see how ice can exist in a cave which has no atmospheric  communication with the colds of winter, as would apparently be the case  with this cave if the one entrance were closed; but where the cracks and  small fissures in the rock do provide such communication, there is no  reason why we should not imagine all manner of glacial beauties  decorating unknown cavities, beyond the general physical law to which  all the glacieres would seem to be exceptions.    Mignot now became communicative as to the amount of ice supplied by his  glaciere, the lower of the two we had seen; and his statistics were so  utterly confused, that I gave him ten centimes and an address, and  charged him to write it all down from his account-book, and send it by  post. The letter was accordingly written on July 24, and after trying  many unsuccessful addresses in various parts of Switzerland, it finally  reached England in the middle of September. It tells its own tale  sufficiently well, and is therefore given here with all the mistakes of  the original.
