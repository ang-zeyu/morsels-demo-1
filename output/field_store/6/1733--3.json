At last the truck was drawn sufficiently far back, and I  called for volunteers to overturn it from the side while the engine  pushed it from the end. It was very evident that these men would be  exposed to considerable danger. Twenty were called for, and there was an  immediate response. But only nine, including the major of volunteers and  four or five of the Dublin Fusiliers, actually stepped out into the  open. The attempt was nevertheless successful. The truck heeled further  over under their pushing, and, the engine giving a shove at the right  moment, it fell off the line and the track was clear. Safety and success  appeared in sight together, but disappointment overtook them.    The engine was about six inches wider than the tender, and the corner of  its footplate would not pass the corner of the newly overturned truck.  It did not seem safe to push very hard, lest the engine should itself be  derailed. So time after time the engine moved back a yard or two and  shoved forward at the obstruction, and each time moved it a little. But  soon it was evident that complications had set in. The newly derailed  truck became jammed with that originally off the line, and the more the  engine pushed the greater became the block. Volunteers were again called  on to assist, but though seven men, two of whom, I think, were wounded,  did their best, the attempt was a failure.    Perseverance, however, is a virtue. If the trucks only jammed the  tighter for the forward pushing they might be loosened by pulling  backwards. Now, however, a new difficulty arose. The coupling chains of  the engine would not reach by five or six inches those of the overturned  truck. Search was made for a spare link. By a solitary gleam of good  luck one was found. The engine hauled at the wreckage, and before the  chains parted pulled it about a yard backwards. Now, certainly, the line  was clear at last. But again the corner of the footplate jammed with the  corner of the truck, and again we came to a jarring halt.    I have had, in the last four years, the advantage, if it be an  advantage, of many strange and varied experiences, from which the  student of realities might draw profit and instruction. But nothing was  so thrilling as this: to wait and struggle among these clanging, rending  iron boxes, with the repeated explosions of the shells and the  artillery, the noise of the projectiles striking the cars, the hiss as  they passed in the air, the grunting and puffing of the engine--poor,  tortured thing, hammered by at least a dozen shells, any one of which,  by penetrating the boiler, might have made an end of all--the  expectation of destruction as a matter of course, the realization of  powerlessness, and the alternations of hope and despair--all this for  seventy minutes by the clock with only four inches of twisted iron work  to make the difference between danger, captivity, and shame on the one  hand--safety, freedom, and triumph on the other.    Nothing remained but to continue pounding at the obstructing corner in  the hopes that the iron work would gradually be twisted and torn, and  thus give free passage. As we pounded so did the enemy. I adjured the  driver to be patient and to push gently, for it did not seem right to  imperil the slender chance of escape by running the risk of throwing the  engine off the line. But after a dozen pushes had been given with  apparently little result a shell struck the front of the engine, setting  fire to the woodwork, and he thereupon turned on more steam, and with  considerable momentum we struck the obstacle once more. There was a  grinding crash; the engine staggered, checked, shore forward again,  until with a clanging, tearing sound it broke past the point of  interception, and nothing but the smooth line lay between us and home.    Brilliant success now seemed won, for I thought that the rear and gun  trucks were following the locomotive, and that all might squeeze into  them, and so make an honourable escape. But the longed-for cup was  dashed aside. Looking backward, I saw that the couplings had parted or  had been severed by a shell, and that the trucks still lay on the wrong  side of the obstruction, separated by it from the engine. No one dared  to risk imprisoning the engine again by making it go back for the  trucks, so an attempt was made to drag the trucks up to the engine.  Owing chiefly to the fire of the enemy this failed completely, and  Captain Haldane determined to be content with saving the locomotive. He  accordingly permitted the driver to retire along the line slowly, so  that the infantry might get as much shelter from the ironwork of the  engine as possible, and the further idea was to get into some houses  near the station, about 800 yards away, and there hold out while the  engine went for assistance.    As many wounded as possible were piled on to the engine, standing in  the cab, lying on the tender, or clinging to the cowcatcher. And all  this time the shells fell into the wet earth throwing up white clouds,  burst with terrifying detonations overhead, or actually struck the  engine and the iron wreckage. Besides the three field-guns, which proved  to be 15-pounders, the shell-firing Maxim continued its work, and its  little shells, discharged with an ugly thud, thud, thud, exploded with  startling bangs on all sides. One I remember struck the footplate of the  engine scarcely a yard from my face, lit up into a bright yellow flash,  and left me wondering why I was still alive. Another hit the coals in  the tender, hurling a black shower into the air. A third--this also I  saw--struck the arm of a private in the Dublin Fusiliers. The whole arm  was smashed to a horrid pulp--bones, muscle, blood, and uniform all  mixed together. At the bottom hung the hand, unhurt, but swelled  instantly to three times its ordinary size. The engine was soon crowded  and began to steam homewards--a mournful, sorely battered  locomotive--with the woodwork of the firebox in flames and the water  spouting from its pierced tanks. The infantrymen straggled along beside  it at the double.    Seeing the engine escaping the Boers increased their fire, and the  troops, hitherto somewhat protected by the iron trucks, began to suffer.  The major of volunteers fell, shot through the thigh. Here and there men  dropped on the ground, several screamed--this is very rare in war--and  cried for help. About a quarter of the force was very soon killed or  wounded. The shells which pursued the retreating soldiers scattered them  all along the track. Order and control vanished. The engine, increasing  its pace, drew out from the thin crowd of fugitives and was soon in  safety. The infantry continued to run down the line in the direction of  the houses, and, in spite of their disorder, I honestly consider that  they were capable of making a further resistance when some shelter  should be reached. But at this moment one of those miserable  incidents--much too frequent in this war--occurred.    A private soldier who was wounded, in direct disobedience of the  positive orders that no surrender was to be made, took it on himself to  wave a pocket-handkerchief. The Boers immediately ceased firing, and  with equal daring and humanity a dozen horsemen galloped from the hills  into the scattered fugitives, scarcely any of whom had seen the white  flag, and several of whom were still firing, and called loudly on them  to surrender. Most of the soldiers, uncertain what to do, then halted,  gave up their arms, and became prisoners of war. Those further away from  the horsemen continued to run and were shot or hunted down in twos and  threes, and some made good their escape.    For my part I found myself on the engine when the obstruction was at  last passed and remained there jammed in the cab next to the man with  the shattered arm. In this way I travelled some 500 yards, and passed  through the fugitives, noticing particularly a young officer, Lieutenant  Frankland, who with a happy, confident smile on his face was  endeavouring to rally his men. When I approached the houses where we had  resolved to make a stand, I jumped on to the line, in order to collect  the men as they arrived, and hence the address from which this letter is  written, for scarcely had the locomotive left me than I found myself  alone in a shallow cutting and none of our soldiers, who had all  surrendered on the way, to be seen. Then suddenly there appeared on the  line at the end of the cutting two men not in uniform. 'Platelayers,' I  said to myself, and then, with a surge of realisation, 'Boers.' My mind  retains a momentary impression of these tall figures, full of animated  movement, clad in dark flapping clothes, with slouch, storm-driven hats  poising on their rifles hardly a hundred yards away. I turned and ran  between the rails of the track, and the only thought I achieved was  this, 'Boer marksmanship.' Two bullets passed, both within a foot, one  on either side. I flung myself against the banks of the cutting. But  they gave no cover. Another glance at the figures; one was now kneeling  to aim. Again I darted forward. Movement seemed the only chance. Again  two soft kisses sucked in the air, but nothing struck me. This could not  endure. I must get out of the cutting--that damnable corridor. I  scrambled up the bank. The earth sprang up beside me, and something  touched my hand, but outside the cutting was a tiny depression. I  crouched in this, struggling to get my wind. On the other side of the  railway a horseman galloped up, shouting to me and waving his hand. He  was scarcely forty yards off. With a rifle I could have killed him  easily. I knew nothing of white flags, and the bullets had made me  savage. I reached down for my Mauser pistol. 'This one at least,' I  said, and indeed it was a certainty; but alas! I had left the weapon in  the cab of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14431"],[0,"International Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science, Vol. 1, (#10)"],[1,"some members, and relieving others of a portion  of that which they have hitherto borne.

Rumor further  whispereth that she had a finger in 'Albert Lunel,' one of the  eccentricities of an eccentric law-lord, which was hurriedly suppressed,  one knows not why; in the _Edinburgh Review_ she wrote a paper on  Moliere, and for Charles Knight's _Weekly Volume_ a pleasant little book  about Racine, on the title-page of which she is styled 'Madame Blaize  Bury;' since that time you observe she has blossomed into a Baroness _de_  Bury! Let us add that she is the wife of Henri Blaze, known as agreeable  critic and the translator of Faust, that she is said to be a great  favorite with the author of 'Albert Lunel,' and that she has the two  novels 'Mildred Vernon' and 'Leonie Vermont' placed to her account: how  many other shapes she may have assumed we know not; are these not enough?  Whether, after all, a flesh-and-blood Madame de Bury exists is more than  We can decide. _Une supposition!_ what if, after all, she should turn out  to be Lord Brougham himself? The restless energy of that Scottish  Phenomenon renders everything possible. _He_ does not agree with Pliny's  witty friend, that it is better to be idle than to do nothing--_satius  est otiosum esse quam nihil agere_.\"           *       *       *       *       *    REV.

THE FINE ARTS IN AMERICA are not in a state of remarkable perfection, if  we may credit a writer in the Augsburg _Allgemeine Zeitung_. This critic  is evidently honest and impartial, but not perfectly well informed. He  supposes that the majority of the artists as well as of the scholars in  the country are emigrants from Europe; and affirms that artists of great  talent, who have been esteemed and encouraged in Europe, have been  reduced to misery in America, and compelled to resort to common labor for  their living. Latterly, however, fashion has brought pictures into  market; and we may now hear, in more refined circles, here and there a  misapplied artistic term, which shows that art is somewhat thought  of. It is characteristic that an American will often bargain for pictures  by the square foot. The New York Art Union has done a good deal of good  in the culture of taste for art, and from the Philadelphia Art Union much  may also be expected. The daguerreotypes taken here may be compared with  the best of Voightlaender of Vienna and Williams of Liverpool. The  talbotypes of this country are better than all others. Lithographing is  done mostly by French and Germans; wood-cutting and steel-engraving by  Englishmen and Americans. The products of the latter two resemble  perfectly those of the same arts in England. Dramatic and musical art  are in a feeble condition. The theaters in the great cities have been  visited by the writer, and nothing admirable found in them. They are all  private enterprises, and no great things are to be expected in that line  without the aid of a government. The theaters are built and furnished in  the most elegant and even luxurious style. The Italian Opera in New York  is supplied by European artists whose best days are over. The actors  never rise to any commendable excellence, and the pieces they perform are  well adapted to their talents. Hardly ever is anything classical produced  upon the stage.    The German drama in the United States is spoken of as being in a  condition of even more desperate degradation. The writer's remarks on  that subject will not specially interest our readers; but we trust that  what we have given above from his strictures will be edifying to all whom  it may concern.           *       *       *       *       *    FROM ROME we hear of an extensive undertaking about to be commenced in  the way of Catholic Art. The plan is this: Overbeck, whose designs from  Scripture history are familiar to all lovers of Art who have not  overlooked one of the most remarkable geniuses of the times, is now  employed upon fourteen compositions representing the fourteen Stations or  pauses of the Lord on his way to the cross. Part of them are already  done, and to judge from them the series will surpass all previous works  of this great master. These designs are to be multiplied to the greatest  extent and put within the means of churches, convents and even the  poorest classes of the people. They will appear of the size of the  original in colored lithography, which will probably be executed in  Germany. Engravings of half size on copper are to be executed by the  eminent engraver Bartoccini, who is familiar with Overbeck's manner, and  who has worked under him in Germany. Indeed Bartoccini is already best  known from the engravings of Overbeck's designs to the New Testament, the  best of which were from his burin. In addition there are to be editions  of these compositions in middling and small sizes as well as in wood  engravings. The object is to provide something which has real artistic  merit in place of the wretched pictures which are offered for the  devotion of the faithful in so many churches and in Catholic  prayer-books. The Pope himself, to whom the first colored drawings have  been shown, takes a lively interest in the enterprise, and will probably  recommend it in a special circular to all the bishops.           *       *       *       *       *    CHARLES MULLER, a German sculptor, whose group, \"The Singer's Curse,\"  Received the second prize at the Exposition of 1849, at Paris, has  arrived in this country, where he proposes to take up his residence. The  _Tribune_ states that \"The Singer's Curse\" will soon be exhibited to the  public in this city. It was suggested by one of the finest of Uhland's  works.           *       *       *     "]]]
