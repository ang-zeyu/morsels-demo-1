There were tall she-oaks all along the creek, and a clump of big ones  over a deep water-hole just above the crossing. The creek oaks have  rough barked trunks, like English elms, but are much taller, and higher  to the branches--and the leaves are reedy; Kendel, the Australian  poet, calls them the 'she-oak harps Aeolian'. Those trees are always  sigh-sigh-sighing--more of a sigh than a sough or the 'whoosh' of  gum-trees in the wind. You always hear them sighing, even when you can't  feel any wind. It's the same with telegraph wires: put your head against  a telegraph-post on a dead, still day, and you'll hear and feel the  far-away roar of the wires. But then the oaks are not connected with the  distance, where there might be wind; and they don't ROAR in a gale, only  sigh louder and softer according to the wind, and never seem to go above  or below a certain pitch,--like a big harp with all the strings the  same. I used to have a theory that those creek oaks got the wind's voice  telephoned to them, so to speak, through the ground.    I happened to look down, and there was Jim (I thought he was on the  tarpaulin, playing with the pup): he was standing close beside me with  his legs wide apart, his hands behind his back, and his back to the  fire.    He held his head a little on one side, and there was such an old, old,  wise expression in his big brown eyes--just as if he'd been a child for  a hundred years or so, or as though he were listening to those oaks and  understanding them in a fatherly sort of way.    'Dad!' he said presently--'Dad! do you think I'll ever grow up to be a  man?'    'Wh--why, Jim?' I gasped.    'Because I don't want to.'    I couldn't think of anything against this. It made me uneasy. But I  remembered *I* used to have a childish dread of growing up to be a man.    'Jim,' I said, to break the silence, 'do you hear what the she-oaks  say?'    'No, I don't. Is they talking?'    'Yes,' I said, without thinking.    'What is they saying?' he asked.    I took the bucket and went down to the creek for some water for tea. I  thought Jim would follow with a little tin billy he had, but he didn't:  when I got back to the fire he was again on the 'possum rug, comforting  the pup. I fried some bacon and eggs that I'd brought out with me. Jim  sang out from the waggon--    'Don't cook too much, dad--I mightn't be hungry.'    I got the tin plates and pint-pots and things out on a clean new  flour-bag, in honour of Jim, and dished up. He was leaning back on the  rug looking at the pup in a listless sort of way. I reckoned he was  tired out, and pulled the gin-case up close to him for a table and put  his plate on it. But he only tried a mouthful or two, and then he said--    'I ain't hungry, dad! You'll have to eat it all.'    It made me uneasy--I never liked to see a child of mine turn from his  food. They had given him some tinned salmon in Gulgong, and I was afraid  that that was upsetting him. I was always against tinned muck.    'Sick, Jim?' I asked.    'No, dad, I ain't sick; I don't know what's the matter with me.'    'Have some tea, sonny?'    'Yes, dad.'    I gave him some tea, with some milk in it that I'd brought in a bottle  from his aunt's for him. He took a sip or two and then put the pint-pot  on the gin-case.    'Jim's tired, dad,' he said.    I made him lie down while I fixed up a camp for the night. It had turned  a bit chilly, so I let the big tarpaulin down all round--it was made to  cover a high load, the flour in the waggon didn't come above the rail,  so the tarpaulin came down well on to the ground. I fixed Jim up a  comfortable bed under the tail-end of the waggon: when I went to lift  him in he was lying back, looking up at the stars in a half-dreamy,  half-fascinated way that I didn't like. Whenever Jim was extra  old-fashioned, or affectionate, there was danger.    'How do you feel now, sonny?'    It seemed a minute before he heard me and turned from the stars.    'Jim's better, dad.' Then he said something like, 'The stars are looking  at me.' I thought he was half asleep. I took off his jacket and boots,  and carried him in under the waggon and made him comfortable for the  night.    'Kiss me 'night-night, daddy,' he said.    I'd rather he hadn't asked me--it was a bad sign. As I was going to the  fire he called me back.    'What is it, Jim?'    'Get me my things and the cattle-pup, please, daddy.'    I was scared now. His things were some toys and rubbish he'd brought  from Gulgong, and I remembered, the last time he had convulsions, he  took all his toys and a kitten to bed with him. And ''night-night' and  'daddy' were two-year-old language to Jim. I'd thought he'd forgotten  those words--he seemed to be going back.    'Are you quite warm enough, Jim?'    'Yes, dad.'    I started to walk up and down--I always did this when I was extra  worried.    I was frightened now about Jim, though I tried to hide the fact from  myself. Presently he called me again.    'What is it, Jim?'    'Take the blankets off me, fahver--Jim's sick!' (They'd been teaching  him to say father.)    I was scared now. I remembered a neighbour of ours had a little girl die  (she swallowed a pin), and when she was going she said--    'Take the blankets off me, muvver--I'm dying.'    And I couldn't get that out of my head.    I threw back a fold of the 'possum rug, and felt Jim's head--he seemed  cool enough.    'Where do you feel bad, sonny?'    No answer for a while; then he said suddenly, but in a voice as if he  were talking in his sleep--    'Put my boots on, please, daddy. I want to go home to muvver!'    I held his hand, and comforted him for a while; then he slept--in a  restless, feverish sort of way.    I got the bucket I used for water for the horses and stood it over the  fire; I ran to the creek with the big kerosene-tin bucket and got  it full of cold water and stood it handy. I got the spade (we always  carried one to dig wheels out of bogs in wet weather) and turned a  corner of the tarpaulin back, dug a hole, and trod the tarpaulin down  into the hole, to serve for a bath, in case of the worst. I had a tin of  mustard, and meant to fight a good round for Jim, if death came along.    I stooped in under the tail-board of the waggon and felt Jim. His head  was burning hot, and his skin parched and dry as a bone.    Then I lost nerve and started blundering backward and forward between  the waggon and the fire, and repeating what I'd heard Mary say the last  time we fought for Jim: 'God! don't take my child! God! don't take my  boy!' I'd never had much faith in doctors, but, my God! I wanted one  then. The nearest was fifteen miles away.    I threw back my head and stared up at the branches, in desperation;  and--Well, I don't ask you to take much stock in this, though most old  Bushmen will believe anything of the Bush by night; and--Now, it might  have been that I was all unstrung, or it might have been a patch of sky  outlined in the gently moving branches, or the blue smoke rising up. But  I saw the figure of a woman, all white, come down, down, nearly to the  limbs of the trees, point on up the main road, and then float up and up  and vanish, still pointing. I thought Mary was dead! Then it flashed on  me----    Four or five miles up the road, over the 'saddle', was an old shanty  that had been a half-way inn before the Great Western Line got round as  far as Dubbo and took the coach traffic off those old Bush roads. A man  named Brighten lived there. He was a selector; did a little farming,  and as much sly-grog selling as he could. He was married--but it wasn't  that: I'd thought of them, but she was a childish, worn-out, spiritless  woman, and both were pretty 'ratty' from hardship and loneliness--they  weren't likely to be of any use to me. But it was this: I'd heard talk,  among some women in Gulgong, of a sister of Brighten's wife who'd gone  out to live with them lately: she'd been a hospital matron in the city,  they said; and there were yarns about her. Some said she got the sack  for exposing the doctors--or carrying on with them--I didn't remember  which. The fact of a city woman going out to live in such a place, with  such people, was enough to make talk among women in a town twenty miles  away, but then there must have been something extra about her, else  Bushmen wouldn't have talked and carried her name so far; and I wanted  a woman out of the ordinary now. I even reasoned this way, thinking  like lightning, as I knelt over Jim between the big back wheels of the  waggon.    I had an old racing mare that I used as a riding hack, following the  team. In a minute I had her saddled and bridled; I tied the end of a  half-full chaff-bag, shook the chaff into each end and dumped it on to  the pommel as a cushion or buffer for Jim; I wrapped him in a blanket,  and scrambled into the saddle with him.    The next minute we were stumbling down the steep bank, clattering and  splashing over the crossing, and struggling up the opposite bank to the  level. The mare, as I told you, was an old racer, but broken-winded--she  must have run without wind after the first half mile. She had the old  racing instinct in her strong, and whenever I rode in company I'd have  to pull her hard else she'd race the other horse or burst. She ran low  fore and aft, and was the easiest horse I ever rode. She ran like  wheels on rails, with a bit of a tremble now and then--like a railway  carriage--when she settled down to it.    The chaff-bag had slipped off, in the creek I suppose, and I let the  bridle-rein go and held Jim up to me like a baby the whole way. Let the  strongest man, who isn't used to it, hold a baby in one position for  five minutes--and Jim was fairly heavy. But I never felt the ache in my  arms that night--it must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10366"],[0,"Freedom's Battle (#10)"],[1,"that their wish must be held to be all sufficient for  refraining from punishing Turkey. It is beside the point to quote what  Turkey did during the war. It has suffered for it. _The Times_ inquires  wherein Turkey has been treated worse than the other Powers. I thought  that the fact was self-evident. Neither Germany nor Austria and Hungary  has been treated in the same way that Turkey has been. The whole of the  Empire has been reduced to the retention of a portion of its capital, as  it were, to mock the Sultan and that too has been done under terms so  humiliating that no self-respecting person much less a reigning  sovereign can possibly accept.    _The Times_ has endeavoured to make capital out of the fact that the  representation does not examine the reason for Turkey not joining the  Allies. Well there was no mystery about it. The fact of Russia being one  of the Allies was enough to warn Turkey against joining them. With  Russia knocking at the gate at the time of the war it was not an easy  matter for Turkey to join the Allies. But Turkey had cause to suspect  Great Britain herself. She knew that England had done no friendly turn  to her during the Bulgarian War. She was hardly well served at the time  of the war with Italy. It was still no doubt a bad choice. With the  Musssalmans of India awakened and ready to support her, her statesmen  might have relied upon Britain not being allowed to damage Turkey if she  had remained with the Allies. But this is all wisdom after event. Turkey  made a bad choice and she was punished for it. To humiliate her now is  to ignore the Indian Mussulman sentiment. Britain may not do it and  retain the loyalty of the awakened Mussulmans of India.    For \"The Times\" to say that the peace terms strictly follow the  principle of self-determination is to throw dust in the eyes of its  readers. Is it the principle of self-determination that has caused the  cessation of Adrianople and Thrace to Greece? By what principle of  self-determination has Smyrna been handed to Greece? Have the  inhabitants of Thrace and Smyrna asked for Grecian tutelege?    I decline to believe that the Arabs like the disposition that has been  made of them. Who is the King of Hedjaj and who is Emir Feisul? Have the  Arabs elected these kings and chiefs? Do the Arabs like the Mandate  being taken by England? By the time the whole thing is finished, the  very name self-determination will stink in one's nostrils. Already signs  are not wanting to show that the Arabs, the Thracians and the Smyrnans  are resenting their disposal. They may not like Turkish rule but they  like the present arrangement less. They could have made their own  honourable terms with Turkey but these self-determining people will now  be held down by the 'matchless might' of the allied _i.e._, British  forces. Britain had the straight course open to her of keeping the  Turkish Empire intact and taking sufficient guarantees for good  government. But her Prime Minister chose the crooked course of secret  treaties, duplicity and hypocritical subterfuges.    There is still a way out. Let her treat India as a real partner. Let her  call the true representatives of the Mussalmans. Let them go to Arabia  and the other parts of the Turkish Empire and let her devise a scheme  that would not humiliate Turkey, that would satisfy the just Muslim  sentiment and that will secure honest self-determination for the races  composing that Empire. If it was Canada, Australia or South Africa that  had to be placated, Mr. Lloyd George would not have dared to ignore  them. They have the power to secede. India has not. Let him no more  insult India by calling her a partner, if her feelings count for naught.  I invite _The Times of India_ to reconsider its position and join an  honourable agitation in which a high-souled people are seeking nothing  but justice.    I do with all deference still suggest that the least that Lord  Chelmsford can do is to resign if the sacred feelings of India's sons  are not to be consulted and respected by the Ministers. _The Times_ is  over-taxing the constitution when it suggests that as a constitutional  Viceroy it is not open to Lord Chelmsford to go against the decision of  his Majesty's Ministers. It is certainly not open to a Viceroy to retain  office and oppose ministerial decisions. But the constitution does allow  a Viceroy to resign his high office when he is called upon to carry out  decisions that are immoral as the peace terms are or like these terms  are calculated to stir to their very depth the feelings of those whose  affair he is administering for the time being.      THE MAHOMEDAN DECISION    The Khilafat meeting at Allahabad has unanimously reaffirmed the  principle of non-co-operation and appointed an executive committee to  lay down and enforce a detailed programme. This meeting was preceded by  a joint Hindu-Mahomedan meeting at which Hindu leaders were invited to  give their views. Mrs. Beasant, the Hon'ble Pandit Malaviyuji, the  Hon'ble Dr. Sapru Motilal Nehru Chintamani and others were present at  the meeting. It was a wise step on the part of the Khilafat Committee to  invite Hindus representing all shades of thought to give them the  benefit of their advice. Mrs. Besant and Dr. Sapru strongly dissuaded  the Mahomedans present from the policy of non-co-operation. The other  Hindu speakers made non-committal speeches. Whilst the other Hindu  speakers approved of the principle of non-co-operation in theory, they  saw many practical difficulties and they feared also complications  arising from Mahomedans welcoming an Afghan invasion of India. The  Mahomedan speakers gave the fullest and frankest assurances that they  would fight to a man any invader who wanted to conquer India, but were  equally frank in asserting that any invasion from without undertaken  with a view to uphold the prestige of Islam and to vindicate justice  would have their full sympathy if not their actual support. It is easy  enough to understand and justify the Hindu caution. It is difficult to  resist Mahomedan position. In my opinion, the best way to prevent India  from becoming the battle ground between the forces of Islam and those of  the English is for Hindus to make non-co-operation a complete and  immediate success, and I have little doubt that if the Mahomedans remain  true to their declared intention and are able to exercise  self-restraint, and make sacrifices the Hindus will \"play the game\" and  join them in the campaign of non-co-operation. I feel equally certain  that the Hindus will not assist Mahomedans in promoting or bringing  about an armed conflict between the British Government and their allies,  and Afghanistan. British forces are too well organised to admit of any  successful invasion of the Indian frontier. The only way, therefore, the  Mahomedans can carry on an effective struggle on behalf of the honour of  Islam is to take up non-co-operation in real earnest. It will not only  be completely effective if it is adopted by the people on an extensive  scale, but it will also provide full scope for individual conscience. If  I cannot bear an injustice done by an individual or a corporation, and  if I am directly or indirectly instrumental in upholding that individual  or corporation, I must answer for it before my Maker, but I have done  all it is humanly possible for me to do consistently with the moral code  that refuses to injure even the wrong-doer, if I cease to support the  injustice in the manner described above. In applying therefore such a  great force there should be no haste, there should be no temper shown.  Non-co-operation must be and remain absolutely a voluntary effort. The  whole thing then depends upon Mahomedans themselves. If they will but  help themselves Hindu help will come and the Government, great and  mighty though it is, will have to bend before this irresistible force.  No Government can possibly withstand the bloodless opposition of a whole  nation.      MR. ANDREWS' DIFFICULTY    Mr. Andrews whose love for India is equalled only by his love for  England and whose mission in life is to serve God, i.e., humanity  through India, has contributed remarkable articles to the 'Bombay  Chronicle' on the Khilafat movement. He has not spared England, France  or Italy. He has shown how Turkey has been most unjustly dealt with and  how the Prime Minister's pledge has been broken. He has devoted the last  article to an examination of Mr. Mahomed Ali's letter to the Sultan and  has come to the conclusion that Mr. Mahomed Ali's statement of claim is  at variance with the claim set forth in the latest Khilafat  representation to the Viceroy which he wholly approves.    Mr. Andrews and I have discussed the question as fully as it was  possible. He asked me publicly to define my own position more fully than  I have done. His sole object in inviting discussion is to give strength  to a cause which he holds as intrinsically just, and to gather round it  the best opinion of Europe so that the allied powers and especially  England may for very shame be obliged to revise the terms.    I gladly respond to Mr. Andrew's invitation. I should clear the ground  by stating that I reject any religious doctrine that does not appeal to  reason and is in conflict with morality. I tolerate unreasonable  religious sentiment when it is not immoral. I hold the Khilafat claim to  be both just and reasonable and therefore it derives greater force  because it has behind it the religious sentiment of the Mussalman world.    In my opinion Mr. Mahomed Ali's statement is unexceptionable. It is no  doubt clothed in diplomatic language. But I am not prepared to quarrel  with the language so long as it is sound in substance.    Mr. Andrews considers that Mr. Mahomed Ali's language goes to show that  he would resist Armenian independence against the Armenians and the  Arabian against the Arabs. I attach no such meaning"]]]
