Do you really mean to roast us?\"    \"Yah! yah! yah! Hough! hough! hough!\"    Round and round the stake circled the disguised freshmen, and the fire  kept getting higher and higher.    Puss Parker fell to coughing violently, having sucked down a large  quantity of smoke. Some of the others raved and some begged. But still  the wild dance went on.    \"Merciful cats!\" gasped Tad Horner. \"I believe they actually mean to  roast us!\"    \"Sure as fate!\" agreed another. \"They won't think to put out the fires  till we are well cooked, if they do then!\"    \"This is awful!\" gurgled Parker. \"Browning, can't you do something?\"    \"Well, I hardly think so,\" confessed the king of the sophomores. \"But I  will do something if I ever get out of this alive! You hear me murmur!\"    \"Say!\" cried Tad Horner. \"I can't stand this much longer. The fire is  beginning to roast me.\"    \"It's getting warm,\" confessed Parker. \"But it seems to keep burning  around the outside edge.\"    \"Keep cool,\" advised Browning.    \"What's that?\" yelled Horner. \"Who said 'keep cool?' Oh, say! That's  too much!\"    \"Just look at the wood,\" directed the king of the sophomores. \"You will  notice that all the wood about our feet is water soaked, and there's  only a little dry wood out around the edges. That's all that is  burning.\"    This they soon saw was true, and it gave them great relief, for it had  begun to seem that the crazy freshmen actually meant to roast them.    At the very moment when the uproar was at its height there came a sudden  loud cry, like a signal, and out of the darkness rushed at least twenty  lads.    They were sophomores who had somehow followed them out there to East  Rock, having been aroused and told of the capture of Browning and his  mates by the soph who escaped.    One fellow on a bicycle had followed them till he felt sure of their  destination, and then he had turned back and told the others, who  hastily secured teams and flew to the rescue.    \"'Umpty-seven! 'Umpty-seven! 'Rah, 'rah! 'rah!\" yelled the rescuers as  they charged upon the freshmen.    \"'Umpty-eight! 'Umpty-eight! 'Rah! 'rah! 'rah!\" howled the painted lads  in return.    Then for a few moments there was a pitched battle.    The battle did not last long, for the freshmen saw they were  outnumbered, and at a signal from their leader they broke away and took  to their heels.    By rare good luck every man was able to get away, for, not knowing  anything about the water-soaked wood piled about the feet of the  captives, the rescuers nearly all stopped to scatter the burning brush.    \"Oh, say!\" grated Browning, as he was released. \"But this means gore and  bloodshed! We'll never rest till we have squared for this roast, and we  will square with interest! Merriwell's life will be one long, lingering  torture from this night onward!\"    \"What's all this racket and cheering?\" asked one of the rescuers.  \"Listen, fellows! By Jove! it seems to come from the place where we left  our carriages!\"    \"That's what it does, and it's the freshman yell,\" cried another. \"Come  on, fellows! If we don't get a move on we may have to walk back.\"    They started on a run, but when they arrived at the place where the  teams had been left not a team was there.    The freshmen had captured the teams, drivers and all, together with the  hack, and far along the road toward the city could be heard a cheering,  singing crowd. As the disgusted and furious sophs stood and listened the  singing and cheering grew fainter and fainter.    \"Fellows,\" said Chop Harding, \"I am sorry to leave Yale, but I am  certain to be hanged for murder. After this, whenever I see a freshman I  shall kill him instantly.\"    It was a doleful and weary crowd of sophs that came filing back into  town and sneaked to their rooms that night.    Of course the sophs would have given a great deal could they have kept  the story quiet, but on the following morning it seemed that every  student in the college knew all about it.    The juniors laughed and chaffed the sophomores, who were sullen and  sulky and who muttered much about getting even.    The freshmen were jubilant. They were on top for the time, and they all  knew they might not have long to crow, so they did all the crowing they  could in a short time.    And still nobody seemed to know just who was concerned in the affair,  save that Merriwell and Browning must have been.    When Browning was questioned he was so blankly ignorant of everything  that it seemed as if he had slept through the whole affair. He had a way  of turning every question off with another question, and it was soon  discovered that no information could be obtained from him.    Still it was passed from lip to lip that the great and nighty king had  been found by the rescuers, stripped to his underclothes, and tied to a  stake, while the smoke arose thickly around him and nearly choked him.    Some one suggested that Browning's complexion seemed to have changed in  a remarkable manner, and then the students fell to asking him if he  really enjoyed a smoke.    Browning seemed subdued; but those who knew him best were telling  everybody to hold on and see what would happen.    \"This is just the beginning,\" they said.    However, several days passed and still nothing occurred. It began to  look as if the sophs had decided that they were outgeneraled and were  willing to let the matter drop.    Frank Merriwell was not deceived. He knew the sophs were keeping still  in order to deceive the freshmen into a belief that there was no danger,  and he continued to warn all his friends to \"watch out.\"    In the meantime Diamond had recovered and was in evidence among the  freshmen. It was said that he went down to Billy's, a favorite freshman  resort, and spent money liberally there almost every night.    The result of this soon became apparent. Diamond was surrounded by a  crowd of hangers-on who seemed to regard him as a leader. He was working  for popularity, and he was obtaining it in a certain way.    Now, Frank Merriwell was no less generous than Jack Diamond, but he  would not drink liquor of any kind--he would not touch beer. It did not  take him long to discover that this peculiarity caused many of the  students to regard him with scorn. He was called the Good Templar and  was often derisively addressed as Worthy Chief.    The very ones who were first to apply the name in derision afterward  came to call him Worthy Chief in sincere admiration.    Frank went around to Billy's occasionally, and although he would not  drink, he treated frequently, paying for anything his companions wanted  to take, from beer to champagne.    One evening Frank, Harry and Dismal Jones went into Billy's and found  Diamond and a large crowd there. Jack had been drinking something  stronger than lemonade, and he was holding forth to a crowd of eager  listeners.    One look at Diamond's flushed face did Merriwell take, and then he knew  the fellow was open for anything. The high color in the cheeks of the  Virginian was a danger signal.    Merriwell and his two friends ordered drinks, Frank taking ginger ale.  Harry and Jones lighted cigarettes.    Frank examined the pictures around the walls. There were ballet dancers  who were standing on one toe, famous trotters, painted pictures of  celebrated fighting cocks, hunters in red coats leaping five-barred  fences, and so forth.    As he looked over the pictures he became aware that Diamond was saying  something that was intended for his ears.    \"Southerners never fight with their fists,\" the Virginian declared.  \"They consider it brutal and beastly, and so they do not learn the  so-called 'art.' They are able to fight with some other weapons, though.  There is a man in this college who is trying to be a high cock of the  walk, but he will never succeed till he shows his right by meeting me  face to face with weapons of which I have knowledge. I have met him with  his weapons, and if he is not a coward he will give me a show. But I  think he is a coward and a sneak, and I--\"    That was more than Frank could stand. He did not pause to think that  Diamond had been drinking and was utterly reckless, but he whirled and  advanced till he stood squarely in front of the Virginian.    \"I presume, Mr. Diamond, that you are referring to me,\" he said, coldly  and steadily, although he could feel the hot blood leaping in his veins.    Diamond looked up insolently, inhaled a whiff of his cigarette, and then  deliberately blew the smoke toward Frank.    \"Yes, sir,\" he said, \"I presume I did refer to you. What are you going  to do about it?\"    \"You called me a coward and a sneak.\"    \"Exactly, sir.\"    \"If I had not already left the marks of my knuckles on you I would slap  your face. As it is, I will simply--pull your nose!\"    And Frank did so, giving Diamond's nose a sharp tweak.    Up to his feet leaped the Virginian, his face white with wrath. He  picked up a glass of champagne as he arose, and then he dashed it into  Frank's face.    In a twinkling friends were between them, keeping them apart.          CHAPTER IX.    THE DUEL.      Merriwell smiled and wiped the champagne from his face with a white silk  handkerchief. The proprietor bustled in and threatened. Diamond quivered  with excitement.    \"There will be no further trouble here,\" calmly said Frank. \"This matter  must be settled between us--I could see that plainly enough. It wan just  as well to bring it to a head at once.\"    \"Lunder and thightning--I mean thunder and lightning!\" panted Rattleton.  \"He won't fight you again with his fists.\"    \"I do not expect him to.\"    \"You'll have to fight with rapiers, sure!\" said another.    \"Merriwell, you're a fool!\"    \"Thank you.\"    \"You have fallen into his trap. He was making that talk to drive you to  do just what you did.\"    \"Wel"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1112"],[0,"The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet (#10)"],[1,"nt,      When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.      Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,      Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.      He made you for a highway to my bed;      But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.      Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;      And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!      Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo      To comfort you. I wot well where he is.

O, find him! give this ring to my true knight      And bid him come to take his last farewell.                                                           Exeunt.          Scene III.  Friar Laurence's cell.    Enter Friar [Laurence].        Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.      Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,      And thou art wedded to calamity.                             Enter Romeo.        Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom      What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand      That I yet know not?      Friar. Too familiar      Is my dear son with such sour company.      I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.      Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?      Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-      Not body's death, but body's banishment.      Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';      For exile hath more terror in his look,      Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'      Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.      Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.      Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,      But purgatory, torture, hell itself.      Hence banished is banish'd from the world,      And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'      Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'      Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe      And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.      Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!      Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,      Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,      And turn'd that black word death to banishment.      This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.      Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,      Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog      And little mouse, every unworthy thing,      Live here in heaven and may look on her;      But Romeo may not. More validity,      More honourable state, more courtship lives      In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize      On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand      And steal immortal blessing from her lips,      Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,      Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;      But Romeo may not- he is banished.      This may flies do, when I from this must fly;      They are free men, but I am banished.      And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?      Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,      No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,      But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?      O friar, the damned use that word in hell;      Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,      Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,      A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,      To mangle me with that word 'banished'?      Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.      Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.      Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;      Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,      To comfort thee, though thou art banished.      Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!      Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,      Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,      It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.      Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.      Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?      Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.      Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.      Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,      An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,      Doting like me, and like me banished,      Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,      And fall upon the ground, as I do now,      Taking the measure of an unmade grave.                                                   Knock [within].      Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.      Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,      Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.      Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;      Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.      Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,      What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.      Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will      Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.      I come from Lady Juliet.      Friar. Welcome then.                           Enter Nurse.        Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar      Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?      Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.      Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,      Just in her case!      Friar. O woeful sympathy!      Piteous predicament!      Nurse. Even so lies she,      Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.      Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.      For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!      Why should you fall into so deep an O?      Rom. (rises) Nurse-      Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.      Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?      Doth not she think me an old murtherer,      Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy      With blood remov'd but little from her own?      Where is she? and how doth she! and what says      My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?      Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;      And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,      And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,      And then down falls again.      Rom. As if that name,      Shot from the deadly level of a gun,      Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand      Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,      In what vile part of this anatomy      Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack      The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]      Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.      Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;      Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote      The unreasonable fury of a beast.      Unseemly woman in a seeming man!      Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!      Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,      I thought thy disposition better temper'd.      Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?      And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,      By doing damned hate upon thyself?      Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?      Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet      In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.      Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,      Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,      And usest none in that true use indeed      Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.      Thy noble shape is but a form of wax      Digressing from the valour of a man;      Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,      Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;      Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,      Misshapen in the conduct of them both,      Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,      is get afire by thine own ignorance,      And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.      What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,      For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.      There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,      But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.      The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend      And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.      A pack of blessings light upon thy back;      Happiness courts thee in her best array;      But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,      Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.      Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.      Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,      Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.      But look thou stay not till the watch be set,      For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,      Where thou shalt live till we can find a time      To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,      Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back      With twenty hundred thousand times more joy      Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.      Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,      And bid her hasten all the house to bed,      Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.      Romeo is coming.      Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night      To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!      My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.      Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.      Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.      Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.      Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!      Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:      Either be gone before the watch be set,      Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.      Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,      And he shall signify from time to time      Every good hap to you that chances here.      Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.      Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,      It were a grief so brief to part with thee.      Farewell.                                                           Exeunt.          Scene IV.  Capulet's house    Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.        Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily      That we have had no time to move our daughter.      Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,      And so did I. Well, we were born to die.      'Tis very late;"]]]
