The lesser British papers generally  followed the tone of the leading journals, but without either great  interest or much acumen. In truth the depth of British newspaper  ignorance, considering their positiveness of utterance, appears utterly  astonishing if regarded from the view-point of modern historical  knowledge. But is this, after all, a matter for surprise? Was there not  equal confusion at least, possibly equal ignorance, in America itself,  certainly among the press and people of the Northern States? They also  had come by experience to discount Southern threats, and were slow to  understand that the great conflict of ideals and interests was at  last begun.    The British press both influenced and reflected educated class opinion,  and, in some degree, official opinion as well. Lord John Russell at the  Foreign Office and Lord Lyons, British Minister at Washington, were  exchanging anxious letters, and the latter was sending home reports  remarkable for their clear analysis of the American controversy. Yet  even he was slow to appreciate the inevitability of secession.    [Illustration: LORD LYONS (_From a photograph taken at Boston, U.S.A.,  in 1860) (From Lord Newton's \"Life of Lord Lyons,\" by kind permission_)]    Other officials, especially those in minor positions in the United  States, showed a lack of grasp of the situation similar to that of the  press. An amusing illustration of this, furnishing a far-fetched view of  causes, is supplied in a letter of February 2, 1860, from Consul Bunch,  at Charleston, S.C., to Lord Lyons, the British Minister at  Washington[49]. Bunch wrote describing a dinner which had been given the  evening before, by the Jockey Club of Charleston. Being called upon for  a speech, he had alluded to the prizes of the Turf at home, and had  referred especially to the Plates run for the various British colonies.  Continuing, he said:         \"'... I cannot help calling your attention to the great loss       you yourselves have suffered by ceasing to be a Colonial       Dependency of Great Britain, as I am sure that if you had       continued to be so, the Queen would have had great pleasure       in sending you some Plates too.'         \"Of course this was meant for the broadest sort of joke,       calculated to raise a laugh after dinner, but to my       amazement, the company chose to take me literally, and       applauded for about ten minutes--in fact I could not go on       for some time.\"    Bunch evidently hardly knew what to make of this demonstration. He could  with difficulty believe that South Carolina wished to be re-annexed as a  colony of Great Britain, and comments upon the episode in a somewhat  humorous vein. Nevertheless in concluding his letter, he solemnly  assures Lord Lyons that         \"... The Jockey Club is composed of the 'best people' of       South Carolina--rich planters and the like. It represents,       therefore, the 'gentlemanly interest' and not a bit of       universal suffrage.\"    It would be idle to assume that either in South Carolina or in England  there was, in February, 1860, any serious thought of a resumption of  colonial relations, though W.H. Russell, correspondent of the _Times_,  reported in the spring, 1861, that he frequently heard the same  sentiment in the South[50]. For general official England, as for the  press, the truth is that up to the time of the secession of South  Carolina no one really believed that a final rupture was about to take  place between North and South. When, on December 20, 1860, that State in  solemn convention declared the dissolution \"of the Union now existing  between South Carolina and the other States, under the name of the  'United States of America,'\" and when it was understood that other  Southern States would soon follow this example, British opinion believed  and hoped that the rupture would be accomplished peaceably. Until it  became clear that war would ensue, the South was still damned by the  press as seeking the preservation of an evil institution. Slavery was  even more vigorously asserted as the ignoble and sole cause. In the  number for April, 1861, the _Edinburgh Review_ attributed the whole  difficulty to slavery, asserted that British sympathy would be with the  anti-slavery party, yet advanced the theory that the very dissolution of  the Union would hasten the ultimate extinction of slavery since economic  competition with a neighbouring free state, the North, would compel the  South itself to abandon its beloved \"domestic institution[51].\"    Upon receipt of the news from South Carolina, the _Times_, in a long and  carefully worded editorial, took up one by one the alleged causes of  secession, dismissed them as inadequate, and concluded, \"... we cannot  disguise from ourselves that, apart from all political complications,  there is a right and a wrong in this question, and that the right  belongs, with all its advantages, to the States of the North[52].\" Three  days later it asserted, \"The North is for freedom of discussion, the  South represses freedom of discussion with the tar-brush and the  pine-fagot.\" And again, on January 10, \"The Southern States expected  sympathy for their undertaking from the public opinion of this country.  The tone of the press has already done much to undeceive them....\"    In general both the metropolitan and the provincial press expressed  similar sentiments, though there were exceptions. The _Dublin News_  published with approval a long communication addressed to Irishmen at  home and abroad: \"... there is no power on earth or in heaven which can  keep in peace this unholy co-partnership.... I hope ... that the North  will quietly permit the South to retire from the confederacy and bear  alone the odium of all mankind[53]....\" The _Saturday Review_ thought  that deeper than declared differences lay the ruling social structure of  the South which now visioned a re-opening of the African Slave Trade,  and the occupation by slavery of the whole southern portion of North  America. \"A more ignoble basis for a great Confederacy it is impossible  to conceive, nor one in the long run more precarious.... Assuredly it  will be the Northern Confederacy, based on principles of freedom, with a  policy untainted by crime, with a free working-class of white men, that  will be the one to go on and prosper and become the leader of the New  World[54].\" The _London Chronicle_ was vigorous in denunciation. \"No  country on the globe produces a blackguardism, a cowardice or a  treachery, so consummate as that of the negro-driving States of the new  Southern Confederacy\"--a bit of editorial blackguardism in itself[55].  The _London Review_ more moderately stigmatized slavery as the cause,  but was lukewarm in praise of Northern idealisms, regarding the whole  matter as one of diverging economic systems and in any case as  inevitably resulting in dissolution of the Union at some time. The  inevitable might as well come now as later and would result in benefit  to both sections as well as to the world fearing the monstrous empire of  power that had grown up in America[56].    The great bulk of early expressions by the British press was, in truth,  definitely antagonistic to the South, and this was particularly true of  the provincial press. Garrison's _Liberator_, advocating extreme  abolition action, had long made a practice of presenting excerpts from  British newspapers, speeches and sermons in support of its cause. In  1860 there were thirty-nine such citations; in the first months of 1861  many more, all condemning slavery and the South. For the most part these  citations represented a comparatively unknown and uninfluential section,  both in politics and literature, of the British people. Matthew Arnold  was among the first of men of letters to record his faith that secession  was final and, as he hoped, an excellent thing for the North, looking to  the purity of race and the opportunity for unhampered advance[57]. If  English writers were in any way influenced by their correspondents in  the United States they may, indeed, have well been in doubt as to the  origin and prospects of the American quarrel. Hawthorne, but recently at  home again after seven years' consulship in England, was writing that  abolition was not a Northern object in the war just begun. Whittier  wrote to _his_ English friends that slavery, and slavery alone, was the  basic issue[58]. But literary Britain was slow to express itself save in  the Reviews. These, representing varying shades of British upper-class  opinion and presenting articles presumably more profound than the  newspaper editorials, frequently offered more recondite origins of the  American crisis. The _Quarterly Review_, organ of extreme Conservatism,  in its first article, dwelt upon the failure of democratic institutions,  a topic not here treated at length since it will be dealt with in a  separate chapter as deserving special study. The _Quarterly_ is also the  first to advance the argument that the protective tariff, advocated by  the North, was a real cause for Southern secession[59]; an idea made  much of later, by the elements unfriendly to the North, but not  hitherto advanced. In these first issues of the Reviews for 1861, there  was frequently put forth the \"Southern gentlemen\" theory.         \"At a distance of three thousand miles, the Southern planters       did, indeed, bear a resemblance to the English country       gentleman which led to a feeling of kinship and sympathy with       him on the part of those in England who represented the old       traditions of landed gentility. This 'Southern gentleman'       theory, containing as it did an undeniable element of truth,       is much harped upon by certain of the reviewers, and one can       easily conceive of its popularity in the London Clubs....

Miss Betterton first appeared in  London in October 1797, fifty-three years ago, as _Elvira_, in Hannah  More's tragedy of _Percy_. Her success was great; and in a short time  she had taken such a hold of popular favor, that when Mrs. Abington  returned for a brief period to the stage, Miss Betterton held her  ground against the rival attraction, and even secured the admiration  of Mrs. Abington herself. Her subsequent engagements were at  Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden alternately, till she made that long  engagement at the Haymarket, during which she has become best known to  the present generation of playgoers. Her more recent brief engagement  with Mr. Anderson, at Drury-Lane, and her last one with Mr. W. Farren,  at the Strand Theater, whither she contributed so much to attract  choice audiences, are fresh in the memory of metropolitans. Looking  back to Mrs. Glover's \"long and brilliant career upon the stage, we  may pronounce her one of the most extraordinary women and accomplished  actresses that have ever graced the profession of the drama.\" Mrs.  Glover had a daughter, Phillis, a very clever young actress, at the  Haymarket Theater, who has been dead several years. Her two sons are  distinguished, the one as a popular musical composer, and the other as  a clever tragedian--the latter with considerable talent, also, as an  amateur painter.    A London correspondent of the _Spirit of the Times_ gives an  interesting account of the Glover benefit, and the \"last scenes.\"           *       *       *       *       *    MADAME GAVAUDAN is dead. To many it will be necessary to explain  that Madame Gavaudan was, in her time, one of the most favorite  singing-actresses and acting songstresses belonging to the _Opera  Comique_ of Paris; and that, after many years of popularity, she  retired from the stage in 1823.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERAL BERTHAND, Baron de Sivray, died early in July at Luc, in  France, in the eighty-fourth year of his age.

The deceased had gone into the water to bathe in  company with several others, and was carried by the rising tide into  deep water, where, as he could swim but little, he sunk to rise no  more, before help could reach him. This premature and sudden death has  overwhelmed his parents and friends in the deepest distress. He was  twenty-five years old.           *       *       *       *       *    THE DEATH OF MR. S.

His busts  exhibit a fine perception of character, and many a delicate grace in  the modeling. Mr. Joseph was long a resident in Edinburgh. He modeled  a bust of Sir Walter Scott about the same time that Chantrey modeled  his--that bust which best preserves to us the features and character  of the great novelist.           *       *       *       *       *    JAMES WRIGHT, author of the _Philosophy of Elocution_ and other works  chiefly of a religious character, died at Brighton, England, on the  9th of July, aged 68.           *       *       *       *       *    SIR THOMAS WILDE, who has just been promoted to the Woolsack, as Baron  Truro, we learn from the _Illustrated News_, was born in 1782. After  practicing as an attorney, he was called to the bar by the Honorable  Society of the Inner Temple, the 7th February, 1817. He joined  the Western Circuit, and soon rose into considerable practice. His  knowledge of the law, combined with his great eloquence, made him one  of the most successful advocates of his time. He was for many years  the confidential and legal adviser of the late Alderman Sir Matthew  Wood, and his connection with that gentleman caused him to be engaged  as one of the senior counsel for the Queen on the celebrated trial of  Queen Caroline. Though surrounded by rivals of the highest eminence  and the brightest fame, Wilde always stood among the foremost,  and obtained briefs in some of the greatest causes ever tried. For  instance, he was engaged on the winning side in the famous action  of Small v. Atwood, in which his fees are said to have amounted to  something enormous. In 1824 he became a sergeant-at-law; and he was  appointed King's Sergeant in 1827, and Solicitor-General in 1839,  when he received the honor of knighthood. In 1841 he first became  Attorney-General; and after a second time holding that office, he  succeeded the late Sir Nicholas Conyngham Tindal, as Lord Chief  Justice of the Common Pleas. His recent appointment as Lord Chancellor  places him at the very summit of his profession.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM THE _LONDON LADIES' COMPANION_.]    THE MORNING SONG.

We are at once doing our readers  a pleasure, and owning a welcome kindness, in publishing, by the  author's permission, these words, set by M. Benedict, and sung by  Madame Sontag.      The world is waking into light;      The dark and sullen night hath flown:    Life lives and re-assumes its might,      And nature smiles upon her throne.

If society ever be wholly corrupted, it will be by the idea that it is  already so. Some cynics believe in virtue, sincerity, and happiness,  only as traditions of the past, and by ridicule seek to propagate the  notion. This vain and pedantic philosophy would turn all hearts to  stone, and arm every man with suspicion against all others, declaiming  against the romance of life, as empty sentimentalism; against the  belief in goodness, as youth's sanguine folly; and the hope of pure  happiness, as a fanciful dream, created by a young imagination, to be  dissipated by the teaching of a few years' struggle with the world.    If this be wisdom, I am no philosopher, and I never wish to be one;  for sooner would I float upon the giddy current of fancy, to fall  among quicksands at last, than travel through a dull and dreary world,  without confidence in my companions. That we may be happy, that we  may find sincere friends, that we may meet the good, and enjoy the  beautiful on earth, is a creed that will find believers in all hearts  unsoured by their own asceticism. Virtue will sanctify every fireside  where we invite her to dwell, and if the clouds of misfortune darken  and deform the whole period of our existence, it is a darkness that  emanates from ourselves, and a deformity created by us to our own  unhappiness.    Yet this is not relating the little story which is the object of my  observations. The axiom which I wish to lay down, to maintain, and to  prove correct, is, that married life may be with most people, should  be with all, and is with many, a state of happiness. The reader  may smile at my boldness, but the history of the personages I shall  introduce to walk their hour on this my little stage, will justify my  adopting the maxim.    M. Pierre Lavalles, owner of a vineyard, near a certain village  in the south of France, wooed and wedded Mdlle. Julie Gouchard.  Exactly where they dwelt, and all the precise circumstances of their  position, I do not mean to indicate, and if I might offer a hint to  my contemporaries, it would be a gentle suggestion that they occupy  too much time, paper, and language in geographical and genealogical  details, very wearisome, because very unnecessary. Monsieur Pierre  Lavalles then lived in a pretty house, near a certain village in a  vine-growing district of the south of France, and when he took his  young wife home, he showed her great stores of excellent things,  calculated well for the comfortable subsistence of a youthful and  worthy couple. Flowers and blossoming trees shed odor near the lattice  windows, verdure soft and green was spread over the garden, and the  mantling vine \"laid forth the purple grape,\" over a rich and sunny  plantation near at hand. The house was small, but neat, and well  furnished in the style of the province, and Monsieur and Madame Pierre  Lavalles lived very happily in plenty and content.    Here I leave them, and introduce the reader to Monsieur Antoine  Perron, notary in the neighboring village.    Let me linger over a notice of this individual. He was a good man, and  what is more curious an honest lawyer. Indeed, in spite of my happy  theory, I may say that such a good man, and such a good lawyer you  could seldom meet. All the village knew him; he mixed up in every  one's quarrels; not, as is usually the case, to make confusion worse  confounded by a double-tongued"]]]
