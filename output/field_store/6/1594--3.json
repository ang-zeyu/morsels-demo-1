Corinthians bred (to tell you one fact more)      As was Bellerophon: islanders in speech,      For Dorians may talk Doric, I presume?        PRAXINOAe.      Persephone! none lords it over me,      Save one! No scullion's-wage for us from _you_!        GORGO.      Hush, dear. The Argive's daughter's going to sing      _The Adonis_: that accomplished vocalist      Who has no rival in \"_The Sailor's Grave_.\"      Observe her attitudinizing now.        _Song_.      Queen, who lov'st Golgi and the Sicel hill        And Ida; Aphrodite radiant-eyed;      The stealthy-footed Hours from Acheron's rill        Brought once again Adonis to thy side      How changed in twelve short months! They travel slow,        Those precious Hours: we hail their advent still,      For blessings do they bring to all below.        O Sea-born! thou didst erst, or legend lies,      Shed on a woman's soul thy grace benign,        And Berenice's dust immortalize.      O called by many names, at many a shrine!        For thy sweet sake doth Berenice's child      (Herself a second Helen) deck with all        That's fair, Adonis. On his right are piled      Ripe apples fallen from the oak-tree tall;        And silver caskets at his left support      Toy-gardens, Syrian scents enshrined in gold        And alabaster, cakes of every sort      That in their ovens the pastrywomen mould,        When with white meal they mix all flowers that bloom,      Oil-cakes and honey-cakes. There stand portrayed        Each bird, each butterfly; and in the gloom      Of foliage climbing high, and downward weighed        By graceful blossoms, do the young Loves play      Like nightingales, and perch on every tree,        And flit, to try their wings, from spray to spray.      Then see the gold, the ebony! Only see        The ivory-carven eagles, bearing up        To Zeus the boy who fills his royal cup!      Soft as a dream, such tapestry gleams o'erhead        As the Milesian's self would gaze on, charmed.      But sweet Adonis hath his own sweet bed:        Next Aphrodite sleeps the roseate-armed,      A bridegroom of eighteen or nineteen years.        Kiss the smooth boyish lip--there's no sting there!      The bride hath found her own: all bliss be hers!        And him at dewy dawn we'll troop to bear      Down where the breakers hiss against the shore:        There, with dishevelled dress and unbound hair,      Bare-bosomed all, our descant wild we'll pour:        \"Thou haunt'st, Adonis, earth and heaven in turn,        Alone of heroes. Agamemnon ne'er      Could compass this, nor Aias stout and stern:        Not Hector, eldest-born of her who bare      Ten sons, not Patrocles, nor safe-returned      From Ilion Pyrrhus, such distinction earned:        Nor, elder yet, the Lapithae, the sons      Of Pelops and Deucalion; or the crown        Of Greece, Pelasgians. Gracious may'st thou be,      Adonis, now: pour new-year's blessings down!        Right welcome dost thou come, Adonis dear:        Come when thou wilt, thou'lt find a welcome here.\"        GORGO.      'Tis fine, Praxinoae! How I envy her      Her learning, and still more her luscious voice!      We must go home: my husband's supperless:      And, in that state, the man's just vinegar.      Don't cross his path when hungry! So farewell,      Adonis, and be housed 'mid welfare aye!          IDYLL XVI.      The Value of Song.        What fires the Muse's, what the minstrel's lays?      Hers some immortal's, ours some hero's praise,      Heaven is her theme, as heavenly was her birth:      We, of earth earthy, sing the sons of earth.      Yet who, of all that see the gray morn rise,      Lifts not his latch and hails with eager eyes      My Songs, yet sends them guerdonless away?      Barefoot and angry homeward journey they,      Taunt him who sent them on that idle quest,      Then crouch them deep within their empty chest,      (When wageless they return, their dismal bed)      And hide on their chill knees once more their patient head.      Where are those good old times? Who thanks us, who,      For our good word? Men list not now to do      Great deeds and worthy of the minstrel's verse:      Vassals of gain, their hand is on their purse,      Their eyes on lucre: ne'er a rusty nail      They'll give in kindness; this being aye their tale:--        \"Kin before kith; to prosper is my prayer;      Poets, we know, are heaven's peculiar care.      We've Homer; and what other's worth a thought?      I call him chief of bards who costs me naught.\"          Yet what if all your chests with gold are lined?      Is this enjoying wealth? Oh fools and blind!      Part on your heart's desire, on minstrels spend      Part; and your kindred and your kind befriend:      And daily to the gods bid altar-fires ascend.      Nor be ye churlish hosts, but glad the heart      Of guests with wine, when they must needs depart:      And reverence most the priests of sacred song:      So, when hell hides you, shall your names live long;      Not doomed to wail on Acheron's sunless sands,      Like some poor hind, the inward of whose hands      The spade hath gnarled and knotted, born to groan,      Poor sire's poor offspring, hapless Penury's own!        Their monthly dole erewhile unnumbered thralls      Sought in Antiochus', in Aleuas' halls;      On to the Scopadae's byres in endless line      The calves ran lowing with the horned kine;      And, marshalled by the good Creondae's swains      Myriads of choice sheep basked on Cranron's plains.      Yet had their joyaunce ended, on the day      When their sweet spirit dispossessed its clay,      To hated Acheron's ample barge resigned.      Nameless, their stored-up luxury left behind,      With the lorn dead through ages had they lain,      Had not a minstrel bade them live again:--      Had not in woven words the Ceian sire      Holding sweet converse with his full-toned lyre      Made even their swift steeds for aye renowned,      When from the sacred lists they came home crowned.      Forgot were Lycia's chiefs, and Hector's hair      Of gold, and Cycnus femininely fair;      But that bards bring old battles back to mind.      Odysseus--he who roamed amongst mankind      A hundred years and more, reached utmost hell      Alive, and 'scaped the giant's hideous cell--      Had lived and died: Eumaeus and his swine;      Philoetius, busy with his herded kine;      And great Laertes' self, had passed away,      Were not their names preserved in Homer's lay.      Through song alone may man true glory taste;      The dead man's riches his survivors waste.          But count the waves, with yon gray wind-swept main      Borne shoreward: from a red brick wash his stain      In some pool's violet depths: 'twill task thee yet      To reach the heart on baleful avarice set.      To such I say 'Fare well': let theirs be store      Of wealth; but let them always crave for more:      Horses and mules inferior things _I_ find      To the esteem and love of all mankind.          But to what mortal's roof may I repair,      I and my Muse, and find a welcome there?      I and my Muse: for minstrels fare but ill,      Reft of those maids, who know the mightiest's will.      The cycle of the years, it flags not yet;      In many a chariot many a steed shall sweat:      And one, to manhood grown, my lays shall claim,      Whose deeds shall rival great Achilles' fame,      Who from stout Aias might have won the prize      On Simois' plain, where Phrygian Ilus lies.      Now, in their sunset home on Libya's heel,      Phoenicia's sons unwonted chillness feel:      Now, with his targe of willow at his breast,      The Syracusan bears his spear in rest,      Amongst these Hiero arms him for the war,      Eager to fight as warriors fought of yore;      The plumes float darkling o'er his helmed brow.      O Zeus, the sire most glorious; and O thou,      Empress Athene; and thou, damsel fair,      Who with thy mother wast decreed to bear      Rule o'er rich Corinth, o'er that city of pride      Beside whose walls Anapus' waters glide:--      May ill winds waft across the Southern sea      (Of late a legion, now but two or three,)      Far from our isle, our foes; the doom to tell,      To wife and child, of those they loved so well;      While the old race enjoy once more the lands      Spoiled and insulted erst by alien hands!          And fair and fruitful may their cornlands be!      Their flocks in thousands bleat upon the lea,      Fat and full-fed; their kine, as home they wind,      The lagging traveller of his rest remind!      With might and main their fallows let them till:      Till comes the seedtime, and cicalas trill      (Hid from the toilers of the hot midday      In the thick leafage) on the topmost spray!      O'er shield and spear their webs let spiders spin,      And none so much as name the battle-din!      Then Hiero's lofty deeds may minstrels bear      Beyond the Scythian ocean-main, and where      Within those ample walls, with asphalt made      Time-proof, Semiramis her empire swayed.      I am but a single voice: but many a bard      Beside me do those heavenly maids regard:      May those all love to sing, 'mid earth's acclaim,      Of Sicel Arethuse, and Hiero's fame.        O Graces, royal nurselings, who hold dear      The Minyae's city, once the Theban's fear:      Unbidden I tarry, whither bidden I fare      My Muse my comrade. And be ye too there,      Sisters divine! Were ye and song forgot,      What grace had earth? With you be aye my lot!          IDYLL XVII.      The Praise of Ptolemy.        With Zeus begin, sweet sisters, end with Zeus,      When ye would sing the sovereign of the skies:      But first among mankind rank Ptolemy;      First, last, and midmost; being past compare.

We all got to go--all who wanted to go. It  was a big crowd. It was John Sanders let us go mean as he was.    \"Miss Cornelia had the cistern cleaned out and they packed up their  pretty china dishes and silver in a big flat sorter box. Charles took  them down a ladder to the bottom of the dark cistern and put dirt over  it all and then scattered some old rubbish round, took the ladder out.  The Yankees never much as peared to see that old open cistern. I don't  know if they buried money or not. They packed up a lot of nice things.  It wasn't touched till after the War was over.    \"I been farming and cooking all my life. I worked for Major Black, Mr.  Ben Tolbert, Mr. Williams at Pleasant Hill, Mississippi. I married and  long time after come to Arkansas. They said you could raise stock  here--no fence law.    \"I get $8 and commodities because I am blind. I live with my daughter  here.\"          Interviewer: Miss Irene Robertson  Person interviewed: Nellie Maxwell, Biscoe, Arkansas  Age: 63      \"Mama was Harriett Baldwin. She was born in Virginia. Her owners was  Mistress Mollie Fisher and Master Coon Fisher. It was so cold one winter  that they burned up their furniture keeping a fire. Said seemed like  they would freeze in spite of what all they could do.    \"Grandpa was sold away from grandma and three children. He didn't want  to be sold nary bit. When they would be talking about selling him he go  hide under the house. They go on off. He'd come out. When he was sold he  went under there. He come out and went on off when they found him and  told him he was sold to this man. Grandma said he was obedient. They  never hit him. He was her best husband. They never sold grandma and she  couldn't 'count for him being let go. Grandma had another husband after  freedom and two more children. They left there in a crowd and all come  to Arkansas. Grandma was a cook for the field hands. She had charge of  ringing a big dinner-bell hung up in a tree. She was black as charcoal.  Mama and grandma said Master Coon and old Mistress Mollie was good to  them. That the reason grandpa would go under the house. He didn't want  to be sold. He never was seen no more by them.    \"Grandma said sometimes the meals was carried to the fields and they fed  the children out of troughs. They took all the children to the spring  set them in a row. They had a tubful of water and they washed them dried  them and put on their clean clothes. They used homemade lye soap and  greased them with tallow and mutton suet. That made them shine. They  kept them greased so their knees and knuckles would ruff up and bleed.    \"Grandma and mama stopped at Fourche Dam. They was so glad to be free  and go about. Then it scared them to hear talk of being sold. It divided  them and some owners was mean.    \"In my time if I done wrong most any grown person whoop me. Then mama  find it out, she give me another one. I got a double whooping.    \"Times is powerful bad to raise up a family. Drinking and gambling, and  it takes too much to feed a family now. Times is so much harder that way  then when I was growing.\"          Interviewer: Miss Sallie C. Miller  Person interviewed: Ann May, Clarksville, Arkansas  Age: 82      \"I was born at Cabin Creek (Lamar now, but I still call it Cabin Creek.  I can't call it anything else). I was sold with my mother when I was a  little girl and lived with our white folks until after the war and was  freed. We lived on a farm. My father belong to another family, a  neighbor of ours. We all lived with the white folks. My mother took care  of all of them. They was always as good as they could be to us and after  the war we stayed on with the white folks who owned my father and worked  on the farm for him. His master gave us half of everything we made until  we could get started our selves, then our white folks told my father to  homestead a place near him, and he did. We lived there until after  father died. We paid taxes and lived just like the white folks. We did  what the white folks told us to do and never lost a thing by doing it.  After I married my husband worked at the mill for your father and made a  living for me and I worked for the white folks. Now I am too old to cook  but I have a few washin's for the white folks and am getting my old age  pension that helps me a lot.    \"I don't know what I think about the young generation.

I never will forget man come and told  mother she was free. She cooked. She never worked in the field till  after freedom. In a few days another man come and made them leave. They  couldn't hold them in Kentucky. The owners give her provisions, meat,  lasses, etc. They give her her clothes. She had four children and I was  her youngest. The two oldest was girls. Father was dead. I don't  remember him. Mother finally made arrangements to go to Will Bennett's  place.    \"Another thing I remember: Frank Hayes sold mother to Isaac Tremble  after she was free. She didn't know she was free. Neither did Isaac  Tremble. I don't know whether Frank Mayes was honest or not. The part I  remember was that us boys stood on the block and never was parted from  her. We had to leave our sisters. One was sold to Miss Margaret Moxley,  the other to Miss Almyra Winder. (He said \"Miss\" but they may have been  widows. He didn't seem to know--ed.) Father belong to a Master Mills.  All our family got together after we found out we had been freed.    \"The Ku Klux: I went to the well little after dark. It was a good piece  from our house. I looked up and saw a man with a robe and cap on. It  scared me nearly to death. I nearly fell out. I had heard about the  'booger man' and learned better then. But there he was. I had heard a  lot about Ku Klux.    \"There was a big gourd hanging up by the well. We kept it there. There  was a bucket full up. He said, 'Give me water.' I handed over the gourd  full. He done something with it. He kept me handing him water. He said,  'Hold my crown and draw me up another bucket full.' I was so scared I  lit out hard as I could run. It was dark enough to hide me when I got a  piece out of his way.    \"The owners was pretty good to mother to be slavery. She had clothes and  enough to eat all the time. I used to go back to see all our white folks  in Kentucky. They are about all dead now I expect. Mother was glad to be  free but for a long time her life was harder.    \"After we got up larger she got along better. I worked on a steamboat  twelve or thirteen years. I was a roustabout and freight picker. I was  on passenger boats mostly but they carried freight. I went to school  some. I always had colored teachers. I farmed at Hughes and Madison ever  since excepting one year in Mississippi.    \"I live alone. I get $8 and commodities from the Sociable Welfare.    \"The young folks would do better, work better, if they could get work  all time. It is hard at times to get work right now. The times is all  right. Better everything but work. I know colored folks is bad managers.
