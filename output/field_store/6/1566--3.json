But all alike was black to the eyes of  Tom, and all the sounds were silence in his ears; only his soul  struggled to slip from the iron chains and to pass southwards into  Paradise.  And the wind blew and blew.    For Tom tonight had nought but the wind to ride; they had taken his  true black horse on the day when they took from him the green fields  and the sky, men's voices and the laughter of women, and had left  him alone with chains about his neck to swing in the wind for ever.  And the wind blew and blew.    But the soul of Tom o' the Roads was nipped by the cruel chains, and  whenever it struggled to escape it was beaten backwards into the  iron collar by the wind that blows from Paradise from the south.  And swinging there by the neck, there fell away old sneers from off  his lips, and scoffs that he had long since scoffed at God fell from  his tongue, and there rotted old bad lusts out of his heart, and  from his fingers the stains of deeds that were evil; and they all  fell to the ground and grew there in pallid rings and clusters.  And  when these ill things had all fallen away, Tom's soul was clean  again, as his early love had found it, a long while since in spring;  and it swung up there in the wind with the bones of Tom, and with  his old torn coat and rusty chains.    And the wind blew and blew.    And ever and anon the souls of the sepultured, coming from  consecrated acres, would go by beating up wind to Paradise past the  Gallows Tree and past the soul of Tom, that might not go free.    Night after night Tom watched the sheep upon the downs with empty  hollow sockets, till his dead hair grew and covered his poor dead  face, and hid the shame of it from the sheep.  And the wind blew and  blew.    Sometimes on gusts of the wind came someone's tears, and beat and  beat against the iron chains, but could not rust them through.  And the wind blew and blew.    And every evening all the thoughts that Tom had ever uttered came  flocking in from doing their work in the world, the work that may  not cease, and sat along the gallows branches and chirrupped to the  soul of Tom, the soul that might not go free.  All the thoughts that  he had ever uttered!  And the evil thoughts rebuked the soul that  bore them because they might not die.  And all those that he had  uttered the most furtively, chirrupped the loudest and the shrillest  in the branches all the night.    And all the thoughts that Tom had ever thought about himself now  pointed at the wet bones and mocked at the old torn coat.  But the  thoughts that he had had of others were the only companions that his  soul had to soothe it in the night as it swung to and fro.  And they  twittered to the soul and cheered the poor dumb thing that could  have dreams no more, till there came a murderous thought and drove  them all away.    And the wind blew and blew.    Paul, Archbishop of Alois and Vayence, lay in his white sepulchre of  marble, facing full to the southwards towards Paradise.  And over  his tomb was sculptured the Cross of Christ, that his soul might  have repose.  No wind howled here as it howled in lonely tree-tops  up upon the downs, but came with gentle breezes, orchard scented,  over the low lands from Paradise from the southwards, and played  about forget-me-nots and grasses in the consecrated land where lay  the Reposeful round the sepulchre of Paul, Archbishop of Alois and  Vayence.  Easy it was for a man's soul to pass from such a  sepulchre, and, flitting low over remembered fields, to come upon  the garden lands of Paradise and find eternal ease.    And the wind blew and blew.    In a tavern of foul repute three men were lapping gin.  Their names  were Joe and Will and the gypsy Puglioni; none other names had they,  for of whom their fathers were they had no knowledge, but only dark  suspicions.    Sin had caressed and stroked their faces often with its paws, but  the face of Puglioni Sin had kissed all over the mouth and chin.  Their food was robbery and their pastime murder.  All of them had  incurred the sorrow of God and the enmity of man.  They sat at a  table with a pack of cards before them, all greasy with the marks of  cheating thumbs.  And they whispered to one another over their gin,  but so low that the landlord of the tavern at the other end of the  room could hear only muffled oaths, and knew not by Whom they swore  or what they said.    These three were the staunchest friends that ever God had given unto  a man.  And he to whom their friendship had been given had nothing  else besides, saving some bones that swung in the wind and rain, and  an old torn coat and iron chains, and a soul that might not go free.    But as the night wore on the three friends left their gin and stole  away, and crept down to that graveyard where rested in his sepulchre  Paul, Archbishop of Alois and Vayence.  At the edge of the  graveyard, but outside the consecrated ground, they dug a hasty  grave, two digging while one watched in the wind and rain.  And  the worms that crept in the unhallowed ground wondered and waited.    And the terrible hour of midnight came upon them with its fears, and  found them still beside the place of tombs.  And the three friends  trembled at the horror of such an hour in such a place, and shivered  in the wind and drenching rain, but still worked on.  And the wind  blew and blew.    Soon they had finished.  And at once they left the hungry grave with  all its worms unfed, and went away over the wet fields stealthily  but in haste, leaving the place of tombs behind them in the  midnight.  And as they went they shivered, and each man as he  shivered cursed the rain aloud.  And so they came to the spot where  they had hidden a ladder and a lantern.  There they held long debate  whether they should light the lantern, or whether they should go  without it for fear of the King's men.  But in the end it seemed to  them better that they should have the light of their lantern, and  risk being taken by the King's men and hanged, than that they should  come suddenly face to face in the darkness with whatever one might  come face to face with a little after midnight about the Gallows  Tree.    On three roads in England whereon it was not the wont of folk to go  their ways in safety, travellers tonight went unmolested.  But the  three friends, walking several paces wide of the King's highway,  approached the Gallows Tree, and Will carried the lantern and Joe  the ladder, but Puglioni carried a great sword wherewith to do the  work which must be done.  When they came close, they saw how bad was  the case with Tom, for little remained of that fine figure of a man  and nothing at all of his great resolute spirit, only as they came  they thought they heard a whimpering cry like the sound of a thing  that was caged and unfree.    To and fro, to and fro in the winds swung the bones and the soul of  Tom, for the sins that he had sinned on the King's highway against  the laws of the King; and with shadows and a lantern through the  darkness, at the peril of their lives, came the three friends that  his soul had won before it swung in chains.  Thus the seeds of Tom's  own soul that he had sown all his life had grown into a Gallows Tree  that bore in season iron chains in clusters; while the careless  seeds that he had strewn here and there, a kindly jest and a few  merry words, had grown into the triple friendship that would not  desert his bones.    Then the three set the ladder against the tree, and Puglioni went up  with his sword in his right hand, and at the top of it he reached up  and began to hack at the neck below the iron collar.  Presently, the  bones and the old coat and the soul of Tom fell down with a rattle,  and a moment afterwards his head that had watched so long alone  swung clear from the swinging chain.  These things Will and Joe  gathered up, and Puglioni came running down his ladder, and they  heaped upon its rungs the terrible remains of their friend, and  hastened away wet through with the rain, with the fear of phantoms  in their hearts and horror lying before them on the ladder.  By two  o'clock they were down again in the valley out of the bitter wind,  but they went on past the open grave into the graveyard all among  the tombs, with their lantern and their ladder and the terrible  thing upon it, which kept their friendship still.  Then these three,  that had robbed the Law of its due and proper victim, still sinned  on for what was still their friend, and levered out the marble slabs  from the sacred sepulchre of Paul, Archbishop of Alois and Vayence.  And from it they took the very bones of the Archbishop himself, and  carried them away to the eager grave that they had left, and put  them in and shovelled back the earth.  But all that lay on the  ladder they placed, with a few tears, within the great white  sepulchre under the Cross of Christ, and put back the marble slabs.    Thence the soul of Tom, arising hallowed out of sacred ground, went  at dawn down the valley, and, lingering a little about his mother's  cottage and old haunts of childhood, passed on and came to the wide  lands beyond the clustered homesteads.  There, there met with it all  the kindly thoughts that the soul of Tom had ever had, and they flew  and sang beside it all the way southwards, until at last, with  singing all about it, it came to Paradise.    But Will and Joe and the gypsy Puglioni went back to their gin, and  robbed and cheated again in the tavern of foul repute, and knew not  that in their sinful lives they had sinned one sin at which the  Angels smiled.

Verses of ten or twelve syllables, however, lend themselves more  readily to rhythm from regularly recurring stress.    _Decasyllabic Verse_: A verse of ten syllables may be formed by the  triple repetition of the trisyllable -- -- /. One extra unaccented  syllable is admissible when the verse is _llano_; and two when the  verse is _esdrujulo_.    Scheme:      -- -- / -- -- / -- -- ,        _agudo_.    -- -- / -- -- , -- -- , --     _llano_.    -- -- / -- -- / -- -- / -- --  _esdrujulo_.    _Dodecasyllable Verse_: A verse of twelve syllables, with  the stress on the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh syllables,  makes a dodecasyllable of amphibrachs. This dodecasyllable  has a short metrical pause after the sixth syllable, and a longer  one after the twelfth.    Scheme:      -- / -- -- / -- || -- / -- -- /      _agudo_.    -- / -- -- / -- || -- / -- -- / --    _llano_.    -- / -- -- /      -- / -- -- / -- --  _esdrujulo_.    Verses of different length do not readily intermingle. There are some  measures, however, which are used much together.    Verses of eleven syllables are used with those of seven or of five  syllables.    Verses of eight syllables are used with those of four syllables.    Verses of ten syllables are used with those of twelve (p. 164, I); and  also with those of six (p. 167, VII). These meters lend themselves to  regularly recurring stress more readily than any others.          III. CAESURAL PAUSES      The caesura is an important, though not essential, element in Spanish  verse. In verses of eleven or twelve syllables, however, the caesura  is usually employed to give a break in a determined place. The caesura  requires a strong accent on the syllable preceding it, and does not  prevent synalepha.      Ex. _Si al resonar confus|o^a tus espaldas_, p. 171, XVI, l. 7.      Ex. _Sabe que, ocul|to^entre las verdes hojas_, p. 171, XVI, l.5.    The disposition of the caesural pauses determines the harmony of the  versification, and usually varies with the accents so as to avoid  monotony in the verse.        IV. RHYME      N.B. For purposes of Rhyme, words may be divided into two classes:    _First_, words ending in a vowel.    Second, words ending in a consonant.    Rhymes are called feminine, if the rhyme words end in a vowel.    Rhymes are called masculine, if the rhyme words end in a consonant.    NOTE: Final s and final n, especially in the plural of nouns and in  verbs, do not count. Therefore, _penas_ and _arenas_ would form a  feminine rhyme.    There are two kinds of rhyme: Consonance and Assonance.      A. CONSONANCE    _Consonantal rhyme_ is one in which all the letters, vowels and  consonants, are the same from the accented syllable to the end of the  word, e.g. _bruma--espuma_; _flor--amor_.    In consonantal rhyme both consonants and vowels should agree exactly  (_sonante--errante_); b and v can, however, rhyme together, since they  represent the same sound, e.g. _estaba--esclava_; _haba--clava_.    The following are a few general rules for consonantal rhyme.    A word should not rhyme with itself. Sometimes, however, a simple word  rhymes with a derivative (_menor--pormenor_) or two derivatives with  each other (_menosprecio--desprecio_).    The tenses of verbs which end in -aba, -ando, -ais, -eis; the present  and past participles of regular verbs; adverbs with the termination  -mente; verbal nouns ending in -miento, -cion, and other similar  endings,--should not rhyme together.    Words similar in sound and form but distinct in meaning may rhyme.      _son_ ('sound')--_son_ ('are')    If an unaccented weak vowel (i, u) precedes or follows a strong vowel  in the same syllable of a word, it is absorbed by the strong vowel,  and does not count in the rhyme. Therefore, _vuelo_ and _cielo_ rhyme;  also _muestra_ and _diestra_.      B. ASSONANCE    When the vowels from the accented syllable to the end of the word are  the same, but the consonants are different, the rhyme is called  assonance. Therefore, _inflaman_ and _pasa_ assonate in a-a; _negros_  and _creo_ in e-o.    In words accented on the last syllable (_agudas_), the assonance is  that of the last syllable only, e.g. _perdon--espiro_; _azul--tu_.    In words accented on the antepenult (_esdrujulas_) or on a preceding  syllable, only the accented syllable and the final syllable count for  purposes of assonance. Therefore, _fabula_ and _lagrimas_ assonate in  a-a; _tremulo_ and _vertigo_ assonate in e-o.    Words accented on the last syllable (_agudas_) cannot assonate with  words accented on the penult (_llanas_), or with those accented on the  antepenult (_esdrujulas_) or upon any preceding syllable.    In words _llanas_ or _esdrujulas_ the assonance is of two vowels only.  In diphthongs the accented vowel only is considered if the diphthong  occur in an accented syllable. Therefore, _verte_ and _duermes_  assonate in e-e; _baile_ and _parte_ assonate in a-e.    Words _llanas_ may assonate with words accented on the antepenult  (_esdrujulas_). Therefore, _portico_ and _olmos_ assonate in o-o.    For purposes of assonance little use is made of words accented on a  syllable preceding the antepenult.    In a final accented or unaccented syllable u and i are absorbed, for  purposes of assonance, by a preceding or following a, o, or e.  Therefore, _sabia_ and _gratia_ assonate in a-a; _igual_ and _mar_  assonate in a, _pleita_ and _pliega_ assonate in e-a.    If in assonance a weak vowel is united in a diphthong with a strong  vowel, the assonance is called _compound assonance_, e.g.  _guarda--fatua_.    Assonance between two single vowels is called _simple assonance_, e.g.  _sangre--trae_.    This distinction is of little value, however, for verses in simple and  compound assonance alternate constantly.    In the case of two strong vowels forming a diphthong after an accented  syllable, the following rules apply.    a in a final unaccented syllable predominates over a preceding or  succeeding o in the same syllable. Therefore, _Astarloa_ and _Danao_  assonate in a-a.    a in a final unaccented syllable predominates over a preceding or  following e in the same syllable. Therefore, _corporea_ and _rosea_  assonate in o-a.    o in a final unaccented syllable predominates over a preceding e in  the same syllable. Therefore, _oleo_ and _erroneo_ assonate in o-o;  but o in a final unaccented syllable is dominated by a following e in  the same syllable, and the e counts in the assonance. Therefore,  _heroe_ and _veces_ assonate in e-e.    When two weak vowels (i, u) are united in a diphthong, the second  predominates. Thus _triunfo_ and _chulo_ assonate in u-o; _cuido_ and  _bendito_ assonate in i-o.    There are twenty possible assonances in Spanish: a, o, e, i, u, a-a,  a-e, a-o, e-a, e-e, e-o, o-a, o-e, o-o, i-a, i-e, i-o, u-a, u-e, u-o.    Words that have in the final unaccented syllable i or u, not in  diphthongs, are considered for purposes of assonance as if ending in e  or o respectively. Therefore, _facil_ and _nave_ assonate in a-e;  _espiritu_ and _liquido_, in i-o.    If ai occurs in a syllable after an a in the accented syllable, the i  rather than the a of the diphthong counts in the assonance. Therefore,  _cantares_ and _trocabais_ assonate in a-e. If the accented vowel is  not a, the a of ai counts in the assonance. Therefore, _Vicenta_ and  _quisierais_ assonate in e-a.    Consonantal rhyme should not be introduced in compositions written in  assonance. This rule is not always observed (see pp. 183-184, LIII).    The assonance of alternate lines (the even numbers) is the rule in  modern Spanish. If the composition is short the same assonance may be  kept throughout.    Blank Verse.--Verses which lack both consonantal rhyme and assonance  occur in Spanish, and are called _versos sueltos_ (or _libres_).  Compositions in blank verse are, however, extremely difficult to write  in Spanish, and are therefore comparatively rare.      STROPHES    The strophe is frequently of arbitrary length, yet when the poet has  once fixed the measure of his strophe he is supposed to preserve the  same measure throughout. The following are some of the strophic  arrangements in Spanish.    _Pareados_ are pairs of contiguous verses of the same number of  syllables, which rhyme[1] together in pairs.      [Footnote 1: By _rhyme_ hereafter shall be understood _consonantal_    rhyme, unless otherwise indicated.]    _Tercetos_ are a series of strophes, in the first of which the first  verse rhymes with the third, and, from the second strophe on, the  first and third verse of each successive strophe rhyme with the middle  verse of the preceding strophe. This form of verse is known in Italian  as _terza rima_. The composition ends with a _serventesio_ (see  below), of which the first and third verses rhyme with the middle  verse of the preceding strophe. The rhyme-scheme, then, would be a b  a, b c b, c d c, etc., d e d e.    _Cuartetas_, properly so called, are strophes of four eight-syllable  verses, of which the second verse rhymes (or is in assonance) with the  fourth. _Cuarteta_ is likewise a general name given to strophes of  four verses.    _Serventesios_ are strophes of four hendecasyllables, of which the  first rhymes or assonates with the third, and the second with the  fourth.    _Redondillas_ are strophes of four eight-syllable (or sometimes  six-syllable) verses which rhyme as follows: a b b a.    _Cuartetos_ are strophes of four hendecasyllables with the  rhyme-scheme a b b a. It is not customary to put a final word that is  _aguda_ in the uneven verses of compositions written in  hendecasyllables, or in verses that rhyme with them. Sometimes the  four verses are esdrujulos.    _Romances_, which are the most used of all forms, need not be written  in _cuartetas_. It is sufficient that the even verses be in assonance  and the uneven verses free. Romances, properly so called, are composed  of octosyllabic verses."]]]
