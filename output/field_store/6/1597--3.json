If this gale carries us  into the pack, we shall be swept far out of our course, if, indeed, we  escape being nipped and sent to the bottom.\"    Being _nipped_ is one of the numberless dangers to which Arctic  navigators are exposed. Should a vessel get between two moving fields or  floes of ice, there is a chance, especially in stormy weather, of the  ice being forced together and squeezing in the sides of the ship; this  is called nipping.    \"Ah!\" remarked Buzzby, as he stood with folded arms by the capstan,  \"many and many a good ship has been sent to the bottom by that same.  I've see'd a brig, with my own two eyes, squeezed together a'most flat  by two big floes of ice, and after doin' it they jist separated agin and  let her go plump down to the bottom. Before she was nipped, the crew  saved themselves by jumpin' on to the ice, and they wos picked up by our  ship that wos in company.\"    \"There's no dependin' on the ice, by no means,\" remarked Amos Parr; \"for  I've see'd the self-same sort of thing that ye mention happen to a small  steamer in Davis' Straits, only instead o' crushin' it flat, the ice  lifted it right high and dry out o' the water, and then let it down  again, without more ado, as sound as iver.\"    \"Get out the warps and ice-anchors there!\" cried the captain.    In a moment the men were in the boats and busy heaving and planting  ice-anchors, but it was not until several hours had been spent in this  tedious process that they succeeded in making fast to the berg. They had  barely accomplished this when the berg gave indications of breaking up,  so they cast off again in great haste, and not long afterwards a mass of  ice, many tons in weight, fell from the edge of the berg close to where  they had been moored.    The captain now beat up for the land in the hope of finding  anchoring-ground. At first the ice presented an impenetrable barrier,  but at length a lead of open water was found, through which they passed  to within a few hundred yards of the shore, which at this spot showed a  front of high precipitous cliffs.    \"Stand by to let go the anchor!\" shouted the captain.    \"Ay, ay, sir.\"    \"Down your helm! Let go!\"    Down went the anchor to the music of the rattling chain-cable--a sound  which had not been heard since the good ship left the shores of Old  England.    \"If we were only a few yards farther in, sir,\" remarked the first-mate,  \"we should be better. I'm afraid of the stream of ice coming round  yonder point.\"    \"So am I,\" replied the captain; \"but we can scarcely manage it, I fear,  on account of the shore ice. Get out a boat, Mr. Saunders, and try to  fix an anchor. We may warp in a few yards.\"    The anchor was fixed, and the men strained at the capstan with a will,  but, notwithstanding their utmost efforts, they could not penetrate the  shore ice. Meanwhile the wind increased, and snow began to fall in large  flakes. The tide, too, as it receded, brought a stream of ice round the  point ahead of them, which bore right down on their bows. At first the  concussions were slight, and the bow of the ship turned the floes aside;  but heavier masses soon came down, and at last one fixed itself on the  cable, and caused the anchor to drag with a harsh, grating sound.    Fred Ellice, who stood beside the second mate near the companion hatch,  looked inquiringly at him.    \"Ah! that's bad,\" said Saunders, shaking his head slowly; \"I dinna like  that sound. If we're carried out into the pack there, dear knows where  we'll turn up in the long run.\"    \"Perhaps we'll turn bottom up, sir,\" suggested the fat cook as he passed  at the moment with a tray of meat. Mizzle could not resist a joke--no  matter how unsuitable the time or dreadful the consequences.    \"Hold your tongue, sir!\" exclaimed Saunders indignantly. \"Attend to your  business, and speak only when you're spoken to.\"    With some difficulty the mass of ice that had got foul of the cable was  disengaged, but in a few moments another and a larger mass fixed upon  it, and threatened to carry it away. In this extremity the captain  ordered the anchor to be hove up; but this was not easily accomplished,  and when at last it was hove up to the bow both flukes were found to  have been broken off, and the shank was polished bright with rubbing on  the rocks.    Ice now came rolling down in great quantities and with irresistible  force, and at last the ship was whirled into the much-dreaded pack,  where she became firmly embedded, and drifted along with it before the  gale into the unknown regions of the North all that night. To add to  their distress and danger a thick fog overspread the sea, so that they  could not tell whither the ice was carrying them, and to warp out of it  was impossible. There was nothing for it therefore but to drive before  the gale, and take advantage of the first opening in the ice that should  afford them a chance of escape.    Towards evening of the following day the gale abated, and the sun shone  out bright and clear; but the pack remained close as ever, drifting  steadily towards the north.    \"We're far beyond the most northerly sea that has ever yet been  reached,\" remarked Captain Guy to Fred and Singleton, as he leaned on  the weather bulwarks, and gazed wistfully over the fields of ice in  which they were embedded.    \"I beg your pardon for differing, Captain Guy, but I think that Captain  Parry was farther north than this when he attempted to reach the Pole,\"  remarked Saunders, with the air of a man who was prepared to defend his  position to the last.    \"Very possibly, Mr. Saunders; but I think we are at least farther north  in _this_ direction than any one has yet been; at least I make it out so  by the chart.\"    \"I'm no sure o' that,\" rejoined the second mate positively; \"charts are  not always to be depended on, and I've heard that whalers have been up  hereabouts before now.\"    \"Perhaps you are right, Mr. Saunders,\" replied the captain, smiling;  \"nevertheless, I shall take observations, and name the various  headlands, until I find that others have been here before me.--Mivins,  hand me the glass; it seems to me there's a water-sky to the northward.\"    \"What is a water-sky, captain?\" inquired Fred.    \"It is a peculiar, dark appearance of the sky on the horizon, which  indicates open water; just the reverse of that bright appearance which  you have often seen in the distance, and which we call the ice-blink.\"    \"We'll have open water soon,\" remarked the second mate authoritatively.    \"Mr. Saunders,\" said Mivins, who, having just finished clearing away and  washing up the _debris_ and dishes of one meal, was enjoying in complete  idleness the ten minutes of leisure that intervened between that and  preparations for the next--\"Mr. Saunders, sir, can you _h_inform me,  sir, 'ow it is that the sea don't freeze at 'ome the same as it does  _h_out 'ere?\"    The countenance of the second mate brightened, for he prided himself not  a little on his vast and varied stores of knowledge, and nothing pleased  him so much as to be questioned, particularly on knotty subjects.    \"Hem! yes, Mivins, I can tell 'ee that. Ye must know that before fresh  water can freeze on the surface the whole volume of it must be cooled  down to 40 degrees, and _salt_ water must be cooled down to 45 degrees.  Noo, frost requires to be very long continued and very sharp indeed  before it can cool the deep sea from the top to the bottom, and until it  is so cooled it canna freeze.\"    \"Oh!\" remarked Mivins, who only half understood the meaning of the  explanation, \"'ow very _h_odd. But can you tell me, Mr. Saunders, 'ow it  is that them 'ere _h_icebergs is made? Them's wot I don't comprehend  no'ow.\"    \"Ay,\" replied Saunders, \"there has been many a wiser head than yours,  puzzled for a long time about icebergs. But if ye'll use yer eyes you'll  see how they are formed. Do you see the high cliffs yonder away to the  nor'-east? Weel, there are great masses o' ice that have been formed  against them by the melting and freezing of the snows of many years.  When these become too heavy to stick to the cliffs, they tumble into the  sea and float away as icebergs. But the biggest bergs come from the foot  of glaciers. You know what glaciers are, Mivins?\"    \"No, sir, I don't.\"    The second mate sighed. \"They are immense accumulations of ice, Mivins,  that have been formed by the freezings and meltings of the snows of  hundreds of years. They cover the mountains of Norway and Switzerland,  and many other places in this world, for miles and miles in extent, and  sometimes they flow down and fill up whole valleys. I once saw one in  Norway that filled up a valley eight miles long, two miles broad, and  seven or eight' hundred feet deep; and that was only a wee bit of it,  for I was told by men who had travelled over it that it covered the  mountains of the interior, and made them a level field of ice, with a  surface like rough, hard snow, for more than twenty miles in extent.\"    \"You don't say so, sir!\" said Mivins in surprise. \"And don't they  _never_ melt?\"    \"No, never. What they lose in summer they more than gain in winter.  Moreover, they are always in motion; but they move so slow that you may  look at them ever so closely and so long, you'll not be able to observe  the motion--just like the hour hand of a watch--but we know it by  observing the changes from year to year. There are immense glaciers here  in the Arctic Regions, and the lumps which they are constantly shedding  off into the sea are the icebergs that one sees and hears so much  about.\"    Mivins seemed deeply impressed with this explanation, and would probably  have continued the conversation much longer, had he not been interrupted  by the voice of his mischievous satellite, Davie Summers, who touched  his forelock and said, \"Please, Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11615"],[0,"The Grammar of English Grammars (#10)"],[1,"excellency of that power, of which, these are the  two grand instruments. From this account, some may begin to think that in  treating of grammar we are dealing with something too various and  changeable for the understanding to grasp; a dodging Proteus of the  imagination, who is ever ready to assume some new shape, and elude the  vigilance of the inquirer. But let the reader or student do his part; and,  if he please, follow us with attention. We will endeavour, with welded  links, to bind this Proteus, in such a manner that he shall neither escape  from our hold, nor fail to give to the consulter an intelligible and  satisfactory response. Be not discouraged, generous youth. Hark to that  sweet far-reaching note:       \"Sed, quanto ille magis formas se vertet in omnes,      Tanto, nate, magis contende tenacia vincla.\"                      VIRGIL. Geor. IV, 411.       \"But thou, the more he varies forms, beware      To strain his fetters with a stricter care.\"                      DRYDEN'S VIRGIL.    5. If for a moment we consider the good and the evil that are done in the  world through the medium of speech, we shall with one voice acknowledge,  that not only the faculty itself, but also the manner in which it is used,  is of incalculable importance to the welfare of man. But this reflection  does not directly enhance our respect for grammar, because it is not to  language as the vehicle of moral or of immoral sentiment, of good or of  evil to mankind, that the attention of the grammarian is particularly  directed. A consideration of the subject in these relations, pertains  rather to the moral philosopher. Nor are the arts of logic and rhetoric now  considered to be properly within the grammarian's province. Modern science  assigns to these their separate places, and restricts grammar, which at one  period embraced all learning, to the knowledge of language, as respects its  fitness to be the vehicle of any particular thought or sentiment which the  speaker or writer may wish to convey by it. Accordingly grammar is commonly  defined, by writers upon the subject, in the special sense of an art--\"the  _art_ of speaking or writing a language with propriety or  correctness.\"--_Webster's Dict._    6. Lily says, \"Grammatica est recte scribendi atque loquendi ars;\" that is,  \"Grammar is the art of writing and speaking correctly.\" Despauter, too, in  his definition, which is quoted in a preceding paragraph, not improperly  placed writing first, as being that with which grammar is primarily  concerned. For it ought to be remembered, that over any fugitive colloquial  dialect, which has never been fixed by visible signs, grammar has no  control; and that the speaking which the art or science of grammar teaches,  is exclusively that which has reference to a knowledge of letters. It is  the certain tendency of writing, to improve speech. And in proportion as  books are multiplied, and the knowledge of written language is diffused,  local dialects, which are beneath the dignity of grammar, will always be  found to grow fewer, and their differences less. There are, in the various  parts of the world, many languages to which the art of grammar has never  yet been applied; and to which, therefore, the definition or true idea of  grammar, however general, does not properly extend. And even where it has  been applied, and is now honoured as a popular branch of study, there is  yet great room for improvement: barbarisms and solecisms have not been  rebuked away as they deserve to be.    7. Melancthon says, \"Grammatica est certa loquendi ac scribendi ratio,  Latinis Latine.\" Vossius, \"Ars bene loquendi eoque et scribendi, atque id  Latinis Latine.\" Dr. Prat, \"_Grammatica est recte loquendi atque scribendi  ars._\" Ruddiman also, in his Institutes of Latin Grammar, reversed the  terms _writing_ and _speaking_, and defined grammar, \"_ars rece loquendi  scribendique_;\" and, either from mere imitation, or from the general  observation that speech precedes writing, this arrangement of the words has  been followed by most modern grammarians. Dr. Lowth embraces both terms in  a more general one, and says, \"Grammar is the art of _rightly expressing_  our thoughts by words.\" It is, however, the province of grammar, to guide  us not merely in the expression of our own thoughts, but also in our  apprehension of the thoughts, and our interpretation of the words, of  others. Hence, Perizonius, in commenting upon Sanctius's imperfect  definition, \"_Grammatica est ars recte loquendi_,\" not improperly asks,  \"_et quidni intelligendi et explicandi_?\" \"and why not also of  understanding and explaining?\" Hence, too, the art of _reading_ is  virtually a part of grammar; for it is but the art of understanding and  speaking correctly that which we have before us on paper. And Nugent has  accordingly given us the following definition: \"Grammar is the art of  reading, speaking, and writing a language by rules.\"--_Introduction to  Dict._, p. xii.[1]    8. The word _recte_, rightly, truly, correctly, which occurs in most of the  foregoing Latin definitions, is censured by the learned Richard Johnson, in  his Grammatical Commentaries, on account of the vagueness of its meaning.  He says, it is not only ambiguous by reason of its different uses in the  Latin classics, but destitute of any signification proper to grammar. But  even if this be true as regards its earlier application, it may well be  questioned, whether by frequency of use it has not acquired a signification  which makes it proper at the present time. The English word _correctly_  seems to be less liable to such an objection; and either this brief term,  or some other of like import, (as, \"with correctness\"--\"with propriety,\")  is still usually employed to tell what grammar is. But can a boy learn by  such means what it is, _to speak and write grammatically_? In one sense, he  can; and in an other, he cannot. He may derive, from any of these terms,  some idea of grammar as distinguished from other arts; but no simple  definition of this, or of any other art, can communicate to him that learns  it, the skill of an artist.    9. R. Johnson speaks at large of _the relation_ of words to each other in  sentences, as constituting in his view the most essential part of grammar;  and as being a point very much overlooked, or very badly explained, by  grammarians in general. His censure is just. And it seems to be as  applicable to nearly all the grammars now in use, as to those which he  criticised a hundred and thirty years ago. But perhaps he gives to the  relation of words, (which is merely their dependence on other words  according to the sense,) an earlier introduction and a more prominent  place, than it ought to have in a general system of grammar. To the right  use of language, he makes four things to be necessary. In citing these, I  vary the language, but not the substance or the order of his positions.  _First_, That we should speak and write words according to the  significations which belong to them: the teaching of which now pertains to  lexicography, and not to grammar, except incidentally. \"_Secondly_, That we  should observe _the relations_ that words have one to another in sentences,  and represent those relations by such variations, and particles, as are  usual with authors in that language.\" _Thirdly_, That we should acquire a  knowledge of the proper sounds of the letters, and pay a due regard to  accent in pronunciation. _Fourthly_, That we should learn to write words  with their proper letters, spelling them as literary men generally do.    10. From these positions, (though he sets aside the first, as pertaining to  lexicography, and not now to grammar, as it formerly did,) the learned  critic deduces first his four parts of the subject, and then his definition  of grammar. \"Hence,\" says he, \"there arise Four Parts of Grammar;  _Analogy_, which treats of the several parts of speech, their definitions,  accidents, and formations; _Syntax_, which treats of the use of those  things in construction, according to their relations; _Orthography_, which  treats of spelling; and _Prosody_, which treats of accenting in  pronunciation. So, then, the true definition of Grammar is this: Grammar is  the art of _expressing the relations_ of things in construction, with due  accent in speaking, and orthography in writing, according to the custom of  those whose language we learn.\" Again he adds: \"The word _relation_ has  other senses, taken by itself; but yet the _relation of words one to  another in a sentence_, has no other signification than what I intend by  it, namely, of cause, effect, means, end, manner, instrument, object,  adjunct, and the like; which are names given by logicians to those  relations under which the mind comprehends things, and therefore the most  proper words to explain them to others. And if such things are too hard for  children, then grammar is too hard; for there neither is, nor can be, any  grammar without them. And a little experience will satisfy any man, that  the young will as easily apprehend them, as _gender, number, declension_,  and other grammar-terms.\" See _R. Johnson's Grammatical Commentaries_, p.  4.    11. It is true, that the _relation of words_--by which I mean that  connexion between them, which the train of thought forms and suggests--or  that dependence which one word has on an other according to the sense--lies  at the foundation of all syntax. No rule or principle of construction can  ever have any applicability beyond the limits, or contrary to the order, of  this relation. To see what it is in any given case, is but to understand  the meaning of the phrase or sentence. And it is plain, that no word ever  necessarily agrees with an other, with which it is not thus connected in  the mind of him who uses it. No word ever governs an other, to which the  sense does not direct it. No word is ever required to stand immediately  before or"]]]
