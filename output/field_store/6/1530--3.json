ZANE GREY    The Last Trail    MCMIX          CHAPTER I    Twilight of a certain summer day, many years ago, shaded softly down  over the wild Ohio valley bringing keen anxiety to a traveler on the  lonely river trail. He had expected to reach Fort Henry with his party  on this night, thus putting a welcome end to the long, rough,  hazardous journey through the wilderness; but the swift, on-coming  dusk made it imperative to halt. The narrow, forest-skirted trail,  difficult to follow in broad daylight, apparently led into gloomy  aisles in the woods. His guide had abandoned him that morning, making  excuse that his services were no longer needed; his teamster was new  to the frontier, and, altogether, the situation caused him much  uneasiness.    \"I wouldn't so much mind another night in camp, if the guide had not  left us,\" he said in a low tone to the teamster.    That worthy shook his shaggy head, and growled while he began  unhitching the horses.    \"Uncle,\" said a young man, who had clambered out from the wagon, \"we  must be within a few miles of Fort Henry.\"    \"How d'ye know we're near the fort?\" interrupted the teamster, \"or  safe, either, fer thet matter? I don't know this country.\"    \"The guide assured me we could easily make Fort Henry by sundown.\"    \"Thet guide! I tell ye, Mr. Sheppard----\"    \"Not so loud. Do not alarm my daughter,\" cautioned the man who had  been called Sheppard.    \"Did ye notice anythin' queer about thet guide?\" asked the teamster,  lowering his voice. \"Did ye see how oneasy he was last night? Did it  strike ye he left us in a hurry, kind of excited like, in spite of his  offhand manner?\"    \"Yes, he acted odd, or so it seemed to me,\" replied Sheppard. \"How  about you, Will?\"    \"Now that I think of it, I believe he was queer. He behaved like a man  who expected somebody, or feared something might happen. I fancied,  however, that it was simply the manner of a woodsman.\"    \"Wal, I hev my opinion,\" said the teamster, in a gruff whisper. \"Ye  was in a hurry to be a-goin', an' wouldn't take no advice. The  fur-trader at Fort Pitt didn't give this guide Jenks no good send off.  Said he wasn't well-known round Pitt, 'cept he could handle a  knife some.\"    \"What is your opinion?\" asked Sheppard, as the teamster paused.    \"Wal, the valley below Pitt is full of renegades, outlaws an'  hoss-thieves. The redskins ain't so bad as they used to be, but these  white fellers are wusser'n ever. This guide Jenks might be in with  them, that's all. Mebbe I'm wrong. I hope so. The way he left us  looks bad.\"    \"We won't borrow trouble. If we have come all this way without seeing  either Indian or outlaw--in fact, without incident--I feel certain we  can perform the remainder of the journey in safety.\" Then Mr. Sheppard  raised his voice. \"Here, Helen, you lazy girl, come out of that wagon.  We want some supper. Will, you gather some firewood, and we'll soon  give this gloomy little glen a more cheerful aspect.\"    As Mr. Sheppard turned toward the canvas-covered wagon a girl leaped  lightly down beside him. She was nearly as tall as he.    \"Is this Fort Henry?\" she asked, cheerily, beginning to dance around  him. \"Where's the inn? I'm _so_ hungry. How glad I am to get out of  that wagon! I'd like to run. Isn't this a lonesome, lovely spot?\"    A camp-fire soon crackled with hiss and sputter, and fragrant  wood-smoke filled the air. Steaming kettle, and savory steaks of  venison cheered the hungry travelers, making them forget for the time  the desertion of their guide and the fact that they might be lost. The  last glow faded entirely out of the western sky. Night enveloped the  forest, and the little glade was a bright spot in the gloom.    The flickering light showed Mr. Sheppard to be a well-preserved old  man with gray hair and ruddy, kindly face. The nephew had a boyish,  frank expression. The girl was a splendid specimen of womanhood. Her  large, laughing eyes were as dark as the shadows beneath the trees.    Suddenly a quick start on Helen's part interrupted the merry flow of  conversation. She sat bolt upright with half-averted face.    \"Cousin, what is the matter?\" asked Will, quickly.    Helen remained motionless.    \"My dear,\" said Mr. Sheppard sharply.    \"I heard a footstep,\" she whispered, pointing with trembling finger  toward the impenetrable blackness beyond the camp-fire.    All could hear a soft patter on the leaves. Then distinct footfalls  broke the silence.    The tired teamster raised his shaggy head and glanced fearfully around  the glade. Mr. Sheppard and Will gazed doubtfully toward the foliage;  but Helen did not change her position. The travelers appeared stricken  by the silence and solitude of the place. The faint hum of insects,  and the low moan of the night wind, seemed accentuated by the almost  painful stillness.    \"A panther, most likely,\" suggested Sheppard, in a voice which he  intended should be reassuring. \"I saw one to-day slinking along  the trail.\"    \"I'd better get my gun from the wagon,\" said Will.    \"How dark and wild it is here!\" exclaimed Helen nervously. \"I believe  I was frightened. Perhaps I fancied it--there! Again--listen. Ah!\"    Two tall figures emerged from the darkness into the circle of light,  and with swift, supple steps gained the camp-fire before any of the  travelers had time to move. They were Indians, and the brandishing of  their tomahawks proclaimed that they were hostile.    \"Ugh!\" grunted the taller savage, as he looked down upon the  defenseless, frightened group.    As the menacing figures stood in the glare of the fire gazing at the  party with shifty eyes, they presented a frightful appearance. Fierce  lineaments, all the more so because of bars of paint, the hideous,  shaven heads adorned with tufts of hair holding a single feather,  sinewy, copper-colored limbs suggestive of action and endurance, the  general aspect of untamed ferocity, appalled the travelers and chilled  their blood.    Grunts and chuckles manifested the satisfaction with which the Indians  fell upon the half-finished supper. They caused it to vanish with  astonishing celerity, and resembled wolves rather than human beings in  their greediness.    Helen looked timidly around as if hoping to see those who would aid,  and the savages regarded her with ill humor. A movement on the part of  any member of the group caused muscular hands to steal toward the  tomahawks.    Suddenly the larger savage clutched his companion's knee. Then lifting  his hatchet, shook it with a significant gesture in Sheppard's face,  at the same time putting a finger on his lips to enjoin silence. Both  Indians became statuesque in their immobility. They crouched in an  attitude of listening, with heads bent on one side, nostrils dilated,  and mouths open.    One, two, three moments passed. The silence of the forest appeared to  be unbroken; but ears as keen as those of a deer had detected some  sound. The larger savage dropped noiselessly to the ground, where he  lay stretched out with his ear to the ground. The other remained  immovable; only his beady eyes gave signs of life, and these covered  every point.    Finally the big savage rose silently, pointed down the dark trail, and  strode out of the circle of light. His companion followed close at his  heels. The two disappeared in the black shadows like specters, as  silently as they had come.    \"Well!\" breathed Helen.    \"I am immensely relieved!\" exclaimed Will.    \"What do you make of such strange behavior?\" Sheppard asked of the  teamster.    \"I'spect they got wind of somebody; most likely thet guide, an'll be  back again. If they ain't, it's because they got switched off by some  signs or tokens, skeered, perhaps, by the scent of the wind.\"    Hardly had he ceased speaking when again the circle of light was  invaded by stalking forms.    \"I thought so! Here comes the skulkin' varmints,\" whispered the  teamster.    But he was wrong. A deep, calm voice spoke the single word: \"Friends.\"    Two men in the brown garb of woodsmen approached. One approached the  travelers; the other remained in the background, leaning upon a long,  black rifle.    Thus exposed to the glare of the flames, the foremost woodsman  presented a singularly picturesque figure. His costume was the fringed  buckskins of the border. Fully six feet tall, this lithe-limbed young  giant had something of the wild, free grace of the Indian in  his posture.    He surveyed the wondering travelers with dark, grave eyes.    \"Did the reddys do any mischief?\" he asked.    \"No, they didn't harm us,\" replied Sheppard. \"They ate our supper,  and slipped off into the woods without so much as touching one of us.  But, indeed, sir, we are mighty glad to see you.\"    Will echoed this sentiment, and Helen's big eyes were fastened upon  the stranger in welcome and wonder.    \"We saw your fire blazin' through the twilight, an' came up just in  time to see the Injuns make off.\"    \"Might they not hide in the bushes and shoot us?\" asked Will, who had  listened to many a border story at Fort Pitt. \"It seems as if we'd  make good targets in this light.\"    The gravity of the woodsman's face relaxed.    \"You will pursue them?\" asked Helen.    \"They've melted into the night-shadows long ago,\" he replied. \"Who was  your guide?\"    \"I hired him at Fort Pitt. He left us suddenly this morning. A big  man, with black beard and bushy eyebrows. A bit of his ear had been  shot or cut out,\" Sheppard replied.    \"Jenks, one of Bing Legget's border-hawks.\"    \"You have his name right. And who may Bing Legget be?\"    \"He's an outlaw. Jenks has been tryin' to lead you into a trap. Likely  he expected those Injuns to show up a day or two ago. Somethin' went  wrong with the plan, I reckon. Mebbe he was waitin' for five Shawnees,  an' mebbe he'll never see three of 'em again.\"    Something suggestive, cold, and grim, in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9935"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery.

PREFACE    The Woman's Institute Library of Cookery consists of five volumes that  cover the various phases of the subject of cookery as it is carried on  in the home. These books contain the same text as the Instruction Papers  of the Institute's Course in Cookery arranged so that related subjects  are grouped together. Examination questions pertaining to the subject  matter appear at the end of each section. These questions will prove  helpful in a mastery of the subjects to which they relate, as they are  the same as those on which students of the Institute are required to  report. At the back of each volume is a complete index, which will  assist materially in making quick reference to the subjects contained  in it.    This volume, which is the first of the set, deals with the essentials of  cookery, cereals, bread, and hot breads. In _Essentials of Cookery_,  Parts 1 and 2, are thoroughly treated the selection, buying, and care of  food, as well as other matters that will lead to familiarity with terms  used in cookery and to efficiency in the preparation of food. In  _Cereals_ are discussed the production, composition, selection, and care  and the cooking and serving of cereals of all kinds. In _Bread_ and _Hot  Breads_ are described all the ingredients required for bread, rolls, and  hot breads of every kind, the processes and recipes to be followed in  making and baking them, the procedure in serving them, and the way in  which to care for such foods.    Whenever advisable, utensils for the preparation of food, as well as  labor-saving devices, are described, so as to enable beginners in the  art of cookery to become acquainted with them quickly. In addition, this  volume contains breakfast, luncheon, and dinner menus that will enable  the housewife to put into practical, every-day use many of the  recipes given.    It is our hope that these volumes will help the housewife to acquire the  knowledge needed to prepare daily meals that will contain the proper  sustenance for each member of her family, teach her how to buy her food  judiciously and prepare and serve it economically and appetizingly, and  also instil in her such a liking for cookery that she will become  enthusiastic about mastering and dignifying this womanly art.

Without doubt, the greatest problem confronting the human race is  that of food. In order to exist, every person must eat; but eating  simply to keep life in the body is not enough. Aside from this, the body  must be supplied with an ample amount of energy to carry on each day's  work, as well as with the material needed for its growth, repair, and  working power. To meet these requirements of the human body, there is  nothing to take the place of _food_, not merely any kind, however, but  the _right_ kind. Indeed, so important is the right kind of food in the  scheme of life that the child deprived of it neither grows nor increases  in weight, and the adult who is unable to secure enough of it for  adequate nourishment is deficient in nerve force and working power. If a  person is to get the best out of life, the food taken into the body must  possess real sustaining power and supply the tissues with the necessary  building material; and this truth points out that there are facts and  principles that must be known in order that the proper selection of food  may be made, that it may be so prepared as to increase its value, and  that economy in its selection, preparation, use, and care may be  exercised.    2. Probably the most important of these principles is the _cooking of  food_. While this refers especially to the preparation of food by  subjecting edible materials to the action of heat, it involves much  more. The cooking of food is a science as well as an art, and it depends  for its success on known and established principles. In its full sense,  _cookery_ means not only the ability to follow a recipe, thereby  producing a successfully cooked dish, but also the ability to select  materials, a knowledge of the ways in which to prepare them, an  understanding of their value for the persons for whom they are prepared,  and ingenuity in serving foods attractively and in making the best use  of food that may be left over from the previous meals, so that there  will be practically no waste. Thus, while cookery in all its phases is a  broad subject, it is one that truly belongs to woman, not only because  of the pleasure she derives in preparing food for the members of her  family, but because she is particularly qualified to carry on the work.    3. The providing of food in the home is a matter that usually falls to  the lot of the housewife; in fact, on her depends the wise use of the  family income. This means, then, that whether a woman is earning her own  livelihood and has only herself to provide for, or whether she is  spending a part of some other person's income, as, for instance, her  father's or her husband's, she should understand how to proportion her  money so as to provide the essential needs, namely, food, clothing, and  shelter. In considering the question of providing food, the housewife  should set about to determine what three meals a day will cost, and in  this matter she should be guided by the thought that the meals must be  the best that can possibly be purchased for the amount of money allowed  for food from the family income and that their cost must not exceed the  allotment. To a great extent she can control the cost of her foods by  selecting them with care and then making good use of what her money has  bought. It is only by constant thought and careful planning, however,  that she will be able to keep within her means, and she will find that  her greatest assistance lies in studying foods and the ways in which to  prepare them.    4. A factor that should not be disregarded in the problem of food is  _waste_, and so that the housewife can cope with it properly she should  understand the distinction between waste and refuse. These terms are  thought by some to mean the same thing and are often confused; but there  is a decided difference between them. _Waste_, as applied to food, is  something that could be used but is not, whereas _refuse_ is something  that is rejected because it is unfit for use. For example, the fat of  meat, which is often eaten, is waste if it is thrown away, but potato  parings, which are not suitable as food, are refuse.    In connection with the problem of waste, it may be well to know that  leakage in the household is due to three causes. The first one is lack  of knowledge on the part of the housekeeper as to the difference between  waste and refuse and a consequent failure to market well. As an  illustration, many housewives will reject turkey at a certain price a  pound as being too expensive and, instead, will buy chicken at, say, 5  cents a pound less. In reality, chicken at 5 cents a pound less than the  price of turkey is more expensive, because turkey, whose proportion of  meat to bone is greater than that of chicken, furnishes more edible  material; therefore, in buying chicken, they pay more for refuse in  proportion to good material. The second cause for this leakage in the  household is excessive waste in the preparation of food for the table,  arising from the selection of the wrong cooking method or the lack of  skill in cooking; and the third cause is the serving of too large  quantities and a consequent waste of food left on individual plates and  unfit for any other use in the home.    5. Another matter that constantly confronts the housewife is what foods  she shall select for each day's meals. To be successful, all meals  should be planned with the idea of making them wholesome and appetizing,  giving them variety, and using the left-overs. Every woman should  understand that food is cooked for both hygienic and esthetic reasons;  that is, it must be made safe and wholesome for health's sake and must  satisfy the appetite, which to a considerable degree is mental and, of  course, is influenced by the appearance of the food. When the housewife  knows how to cook ordinary foods well, she"]]]
