JAMES           *       *       *       *       *    A SCHOOL STORY    Two men in a smoking-room were talking of their private-school days. 'At  _our_ school,' said A., 'we had a ghost's footmark on the staircase. What  was it like? Oh, very unconvincing. Just the shape of a shoe, with a  square toe, if I remember right. The staircase was a stone one. I never  heard any story about the thing. That seems odd, when you come to think  of it. Why didn't somebody invent one, I wonder?'    'You never can tell with little boys. They have a mythology of their own.  There's a subject for you, by the way--\"The Folklore of Private  Schools\".'    'Yes; the crop is rather scanty, though. I imagine, if you were to  investigate the cycle of ghost stories, for instance, which the boys at  private schools tell each other, they would all turn out to be  highly-compressed versions of stories out of books.'    'Nowadays the _Strand_ and _Pearson's_, and so on, would be extensively  drawn upon.'    'No doubt: they weren't born or thought of in _my_ time. Let's see. I  wonder if I can remember the staple ones that I was told. First, there  was the house with a room in which a series of people insisted on passing  a night; and each of them in the morning was found kneeling in a corner,  and had just time to say, \"I've seen it,\" and died.'    'Wasn't that the house in Berkeley Square?'    'I dare say it was. Then there was the man who heard a noise in the  passage at night, opened his door, and saw someone crawling towards him  on all fours with his eye hanging out on his cheek. There was besides,  let me think--Yes! the room where a man was found dead in bed with a  horseshoe mark on his forehead, and the floor under the bed was covered  with marks of horseshoes also; I don't know why. Also there was the lady  who, on locking her bedroom door in a strange house, heard a thin voice  among the bed-curtains say, \"Now we're shut in for the night.\" None of  those had any explanation or sequel. I wonder if they go on still, those  stories.'    'Oh, likely enough--with additions from the magazines, as I said. You  never heard, did you, of a real ghost at a private school? I thought not;  nobody has that ever I came across.'    'From the way in which you said that, I gather that _you_ have.'    'I really don't know; but this is what was in my mind. It happened at my  private school thirty odd years ago, and I haven't any explanation of it.    'The school I mean was near London. It was established in a large and  fairly old house--a great white building with very fine grounds about it;  there were large cedars in the garden, as there are in so many of the  older gardens in the Thames valley, and ancient elms in the three or four  fields which we used for our games. I think probably it was quite an  attractive place, but boys seldom allow that their schools possess any  tolerable features.    'I came to the school in a September, soon after the year 1870; and among  the boys who arrived on the same day was one whom I took to: a Highland  boy, whom I will call McLeod. I needn't spend time in describing him: the  main thing is that I got to know him very well. He was not an exceptional  boy in any way--not particularly good at books or games--but he suited  me.    'The school was a large one: there must have been from 120 to 130 boys  there as a rule, and so a considerable staff of masters was required, and  there were rather frequent changes among them.    'One term--perhaps it was my third or fourth--a new master made his  appearance. His name was Sampson. He was a tallish, stoutish, pale,  black-bearded man. I think we liked him: he had travelled a good deal,  and had stories which amused us on our school walks, so that there was  some competition among us to get within earshot of him. I remember  too--dear me, I have hardly thought of it since then!--that he had a  charm on his watch-chain that attracted my attention one day, and he let  me examine it. It was, I now suppose, a gold Byzantine coin; there was an  effigy of some absurd emperor on one side; the other side had been worn  practically smooth, and he had had cut on it--rather barbarously--his own  initials, G.W.S., and a date, 24 July, 1865. Yes, I can see it now: he  told me he had picked it up in Constantinople: it was about the size of a  florin, perhaps rather smaller.    'Well, the first odd thing that happened was this. Sampson was doing  Latin grammar with us. One of his favourite methods--perhaps it is rather  a good one--was to make us construct sentences out of our own heads to  illustrate the rules he was trying to make us learn. Of course that is a  thing which gives a silly boy a chance of being impertinent: there are  lots of school stories in which that happens--or anyhow there might be.  But Sampson was too good a disciplinarian for us to think of trying that  on with him. Now, on this occasion he was telling us how to express  _remembering_ in Latin: and he ordered us each to make a sentence  bringing in the verb _memini_, \"I remember.\" Well, most of us made up  some ordinary sentence such as \"I remember my father,\" or \"He remembers  his book,\" or something equally uninteresting: and I dare say a good many  put down _memino librum meum_, and so forth: but the boy I  mentioned--McLeod--was evidently thinking of something more elaborate  than that. The rest of us wanted to have our sentences passed, and get on  to something else, so some kicked him under the desk, and I, who was next  to him, poked him and whispered to him to look sharp. But he didn't seem  to attend. I looked at his paper and saw he had put down nothing at all.  So I jogged him again harder than before and upbraided him sharply for  keeping us all waiting. That did have some effect. He started and seemed  to wake up, and then very quickly he scribbled about a couple of lines on  his paper, and showed it up with the rest. As it was the last, or nearly  the last, to come in, and as Sampson had a good deal to say to the boys  who had written _meminiscimus patri meo_ and the rest of it, it turned  out that the clock struck twelve before he had got to McLeod, and McLeod  had to wait afterwards to have his sentence corrected. There was nothing  much going on outside when I got out, so I waited for him to come. He  came very slowly when he did arrive, and I guessed there had been some  sort of trouble. \"Well,\" I said, \"what did you get?\" \"Oh, I don't know,\"  said McLeod, \"nothing much: but I think Sampson's rather sick with me.\"  \"Why, did you show him up some rot?\" \"No fear,\" he said. \"It was all  right as far as I could see: it was like this: _Memento_--that's right  enough for remember, and it takes a genitive,--_memento putei inter  quatuor taxos_.\" \"What silly rot!\" I said. \"What made you shove that  down? What does it mean?\" \"That's the funny part,\" said McLeod. \"I'm not  quite sure what it does mean. All I know is, it just came into my head  and I corked it down. I know what I _think_ it means, because just before  I wrote it down I had a sort of picture of it in my head: I believe it  means 'Remember the well among the four'--what are those dark sort of  trees that have red berries on them?\" \"Mountain ashes, I s'pose you  mean.\" \"I never heard of them,\" said McLeod; \"no, _I'll_ tell you--yews.\"  \"Well, and what did Sampson say?\" \"Why, he was jolly odd about it. When  he read it he got up and went to the mantelpiece and stopped quite a long  time without saying anything, with his back to me. And then he said,  without turning round, and rather quiet, 'What do you suppose that  means?' I told him what I thought; only I couldn't remember the name of  the silly tree: and then he wanted to know why I put it down, and I had  to say something or other. And after that he left off talking about it,  and asked me how long I'd been here, and where my people lived, and  things like that: and then I came away: but he wasn't looking a bit  well.\"    'I don't remember any more that was said by either of us about this. Next  day McLeod took to his bed with a chill or something of the kind, and it  was a week or more before he was in school again. And as much as a month  went by without anything happening that was noticeable. Whether or not Mr  Sampson was really startled, as McLeod had thought, he didn't show it. I  am pretty sure, of course, now, that there was something very curious in  his past history, but I'm not going to pretend that we boys were sharp  enough to guess any such thing.    'There was one other incident of the same kind as the last which I told  you. Several times since that day we had had to make up examples in  school to illustrate different rules, but there had never been "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#1)"],[1,"MERRY ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD    by Howard Pyle        PREFACE    FROM THE AUTHOR TO THE READER      You who so plod amid serious things that you feel it shame to give  yourself up even for a few short moments to mirth and joyousness in the  land of Fancy; you who think that life hath nought to do with innocent  laughter that can harm no one; these pages are not for you. Clap to the  leaves and go no farther than this, for I tell you plainly that if you  go farther you will be scandalized by seeing good, sober folks of real  history so frisk and caper in gay colors and motley that you would  not know them but for the names tagged to them. Here is a stout, lusty  fellow with a quick temper, yet none so ill for all that, who goes by  the name of Henry II. Here is a fair, gentle lady before whom all the  others bow and call her Queen Eleanor. Here is a fat rogue of a fellow,  dressed up in rich robes of a clerical kind, that all the good folk call  my Lord Bishop of Hereford. Here is a certain fellow with a sour temper  and a grim look--the worshipful, the Sheriff of Nottingham. And here,  above all, is a great, tall, merry fellow that roams the greenwood and  joins in homely sports, and sits beside the Sheriff at merry feast,  which same beareth the name of the proudest of the Plantagenets--Richard  of the Lion's Heart. Beside these are a whole host of knights, priests,  nobles, burghers, yeomen, pages, ladies, lasses, landlords, beggars,  peddlers, and what not, all living the merriest of merry lives, and all  bound by nothing but a few odd strands of certain old ballads (snipped  and clipped and tied together again in a score of knots) which draw  these jocund fellows here and there, singing as they go.    Here you will find a hundred dull, sober, jogging places, all tricked  out with flowers and what not, till no one would know them in their  fanciful dress. And here is a country bearing a well-known name, wherein  no chill mists press upon our spirits, and no rain falls but what rolls  off our backs like April showers off the backs of sleek drakes; where  flowers bloom forever and birds are always singing; where every fellow  hath a merry catch as he travels the roads, and ale and beer and wine  (such as muddle no wits) flow like water in a brook.    This country is not Fairyland. What is it? 'Tis the land of Fancy, and  is of that pleasant kind that, when you tire of it--whisk!--you clap  the leaves of this book together and 'tis gone, and you are ready for  everyday life, with no harm done.    And now I lift the curtain that hangs between here and No-man's-land.  Will you come with me, sweet Reader? I thank you. Give me your hand.

No  archer ever lived that could speed a gray goose shaft with such skill  and cunning as his, nor were there ever such yeomen as the sevenscore  merry men that roamed with him through the greenwood shades. Right  merrily they dwelled within the depths of Sherwood Forest, suffering  neither care nor want, but passing the time in merry games of archery or  bouts of cudgel play, living upon the King's venison, washed down with  draughts of ale of October brewing.    Not only Robin himself but all the band were outlaws and dwelled apart  from other men, yet they were beloved by the country people round about,  for no one ever came to jolly Robin for help in time of need and went  away again with an empty fist.    And now I will tell how it came about that Robin Hood fell afoul of the  law.    When Robin was a youth of eighteen, stout of sinew and bold of heart,  the Sheriff of Nottingham proclaimed a shooting match and offered a  prize of a butt of ale to whosoever should shoot the best shaft in  Nottinghamshire. \"Now,\" quoth Robin, \"will I go too, for fain would I  draw a string for the bright eyes of my lass and a butt of good October  brewing.\" So up he got and took his good stout yew bow and a score  or more of broad clothyard arrows, and started off from Locksley Town  through Sherwood Forest to Nottingham.    It was at the dawn of day in the merry Maytime, when hedgerows are green  and flowers bedeck the meadows; daisies pied and yellow cuckoo buds and  fair primroses all along the briery hedges; when apple buds blossom and  sweet birds sing, the lark at dawn of day, the throstle cock and cuckoo;  when lads and lasses look upon each other with sweet thoughts; when busy  housewives spread their linen to bleach upon the bright green grass.  Sweet was the greenwood as he walked along its paths, and bright the  green and rustling leaves, amid which the little birds sang with might  and main: and blithely Robin whistled as he trudged along, thinking of  Maid Marian and her bright eyes, for at such times a youth's thoughts  are wont to turn pleasantly upon the lass that he loves the best.    As thus he walked along with a brisk step and a merry whistle, he came  suddenly upon some foresters seated beneath a great oak tree. Fifteen  there were in all, making themselves merry with feasting and drinking  as they sat around a huge pasty, to which each man helped himself,  thrusting his hands into the pie, and washing down that which they ate  with great horns of ale which they drew all foaming from a barrel that  stood nigh. Each man was clad in Lincoln green, and a fine show they  made, seated upon the sward beneath that fair, spreading tree. Then one  of them, with his mouth full, called out to Robin, \"Hulloa, where goest  thou, little lad, with thy one-penny bow and thy farthing shafts?\"    Then Robin grew angry, for no stripling likes to be taunted with his  green years.    \"Now,\" quoth he, \"my bow and eke mine arrows are as good as shine; and  moreover, I go to the shooting match at Nottingham Town, which same has  been proclaimed by our good Sheriff of Nottinghamshire; there I will  shoot with other stout yeomen, for a prize has been offered of a fine  butt of ale.\"    Then one who held a horn of ale in his hand said, \"Ho! listen to the  lad! Why, boy, thy mother's milk is yet scarce dry upon thy lips, and  yet thou pratest of standing up with good stout men at Nottingham butts,  thou who art scarce able to draw one string of a two-stone bow.\"    \"I'll hold the best of you twenty marks,\" quoth bold Robin, \"that I hit  the clout at threescore rods, by the good help of Our Lady fair.\"    At this all laughed aloud, and one said, \"Well boasted, thou fair  infant, well boasted! And well thou knowest that no target is nigh to  make good thy wager.\"    And another cried, \"He will be taking ale with his milk next.\"    At this Robin grew right mad. \"Hark ye,\" said he, \"yonder, at the  glade's end, I see a herd of deer, even more than threescore rods  distant. I'll hold you twenty marks that, by leave of Our Lady, I cause  the best hart among them to die.\"    \"Now done!\" cried he who had spoken first. \"And here are twenty marks. I  wager that thou causest no beast to die, with or without the aid of Our  Lady.\"    Then Robin took his good yew bow in his hand, and placing the tip at  his instep, he strung it right deftly; then he nocked a broad clothyard  arrow and, raising the bow, drew the gray goose feather to his ear; the  next moment the bowstring rang and the arrow sped down the glade as a  sparrowhawk skims in a northern wind. High leaped the noblest hart  of all the herd, only to fall dead, reddening the green path with his  heart's blood.    \"Ha!\" cried Robin, \"how likest thou that shot, good fellow? I wot the  wager were mine, an it were three hundred pounds.\"    Then all the foresters were filled with rage, and he who had spoken the  first and had lost the wager was more angry than all.    \"Nay,\" cried he, \"the wager is none of thine, and get thee gone,  straightway, or, by all the saints of heaven, I'll baste thy sides  until thou wilt ne'er be able to walk again.\" \"Knowest thou not,\" said  another, \"that thou hast killed the King's deer, and, by the laws of  our gracious lord and sovereign King Harry, thine ears should be shaven  close to thy head?\"    \"Catch him!\" cried a third.    \"Nay,\" said a fourth, \"let him e'en go because of his tender years.\"    Never a word said Robin Hood, but he looked at the foresters with a grim  face; then,"]]]
