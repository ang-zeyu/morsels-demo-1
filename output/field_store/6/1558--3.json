We mean only to assert, that the  _Portuguese_ were the first of the _Europeans_, who made their  _piratical_ expeditions, and shewed the way to that _slavery_,  which now makes so disgraceful a figure in the western colonies of the  _Europeans_. In the term \"Europeans,\" wherever it shall occur in  the remaining part of this first dissertation, we include the  _Portuguese_, and _those nations only_, who followed their  example.]      [Footnote 032: The _Portuguese_ erected their first fort at  _D'Elmina_, in the year 1481, about forty years after Alonzo  Gonzales had pointed the Southern Africans out to his countrymen  as articles of commerce.]      [Footnote 033: In the ancient servitude, we reckoned _convicts_  among the _voluntary_ slaves, because they had it in their power,  by a virtuous conduct, to have avoided so melancholy a situation; in the  _African_, we include them in the _involuntary_, because, as  virtues are frequently construed into crimes, from the venal motives of  the traffick, no person whatever possesses such a _power_ or  _choice_.]    [Footnote 034: Andrew Sparrman, M.D. professor of Physick at Stockholm,  fellow of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Sweden, and inspector of its  cabinet of natural history, whose voyage was translated into English,  and published in 1785.]      [Footnote 035: Boshies-man, or _wild Hottentot_.]             *        *        *        *        *      End of the First Part.             *        *        *        *        *          PART II.

As we explained the History of Slavery in the first part of this Essay,  as far as it was necessary for our purpose, we shall now take the  question into consideration, which we proposed at first as the subject  of our inquiry, viz. how far the commerce and slavery of the human  species, as revived by some of the nations of Europe in the persons of  the unfortunate Africans, and as revived, in a great measure, on the  principles of antiquity, are consistent with the laws of nature, or the  common notions of equity, as established among men.    This question resolves itself into two separate parts for discussion,  into _the African commerce (as explained in the history of  slavery)_ and _the subsequent slavery in the colonies, as founded  on the equity of the commerce_. The former, of course, will be first  examined. For this purpose we shall inquire into the rise, nature, and  design of government. Such an inquiry will be particularly useful in the  present place; it will afford us that general knowledge of subordination  and liberty, which is necessary in the case before us, and will be  found, as it were, a source, to which we may frequently refer for many  and valuable arguments.    It appears that mankind were originally free, and that they possessed an  equal right to the soil and produce of the earth. For proof of this, we  need only appeal to the _divine_ writings; to the _golden age_  of the poets, which, like other fables of the times, had its origin in  truth; and to the institution of the _Saturnalia_, and of other  similar festivals; all of which are so many monuments of this original  equality of men. Hence then there was no rank, no distinction, no  superiour. Every man wandered where he chose, changing his residence, as  a spot attracted his fancy, or suited his convenience, uncontrouled by  his neighbour, unconnected with any but his family. Hence also (as every  thing was common) he collected what he chose without injury, and enjoyed  without injury what he had collected. Such was the first situation of  mankind; [036]a state of _dissociation_ and _independence_.    In this dissociated state it is impossible that men could have long  continued. The dangers to which they must have frequently been exposed,  by the attacks of fierce and rapacious beasts, by the proedatory  attempts of their own species, and by the disputes of contiguous and  independent families; these, together with their inability to defend,  themselves, on many such occasions, must have incited them to unite.  Hence then was _society_ formed on the grand principles of  preservation and defence: and as these principles began to operate, in  the different parts of the earth, where the different families had  roamed, a great number of these _societies_ began to be formed and  established; which, taking to themselves particular names from  particular occurrences, began to be perfectly distinct from one another.    As the individuals, of whom these societies were composed, had  associated only for their defence, so they experienced, at first, no  change in their condition. They were still independent and free; they  were still without discipline or laws; they had every thing still in  common; they pursued the same, manner of life; wandering only, in  _herds_, as the earth gave them or refused them sustenance, and  doing, as a _publick body_, what they had been accustomed to do as  _individuals_ before. This was the exact situation of the Getae and  Scythians[037], of the Lybians and Goetulians[038], of the Italian  Aborigines[039], and of the Huns and Alans[040]. They had left their  original state of _dissociation_, and had stepped into that, which  has been just described. Thus was the second situation of men a state of  _independent society_.    Having thus joined themselves together, and having formed themselves  into several large and distinct bodies, they could not fail of  submitting soon to a more considerable change. Their numbers must have  rapidly increased, and their societies, in process of time, have become  so populous, as frequently to have experienced the want of subsistence,  and many of the commotions and tumults of intestine strife. For these  inconveniences however there were remedies to be found.  _Agriculture_ would furnish them with that subsistence and support,  which the earth, from the rapid increase of its inhabitants, had become  unable spontaneously to produce. An _assignation_ of _property_  would not only enforce an application, but excite an emulation,  to labour; and _government_ would at once afford a security  to the acquisitions of the industrious, and heal the intestine  disorders of the community, by the introduction of laws.    Such then were the remedies, that were gradually applied. The  _societies_, which had hitherto seen their members, undistinguished  either by authority or rank, admitted now of magistratical pre-eminence.  They were divided into tribes; to every tribe was allotted a particular  district for its support, and to every individual his particular spot.  The Germans[041], who consisted of many and various nations, were  exactly in this situation. They had advanced a step beyond the  Scythians, Goetulians, and those, whom we described before; and thus was  the third situation of mankind a state of _subordinate society_.             *        *        *        *        *      FOOTNOTES      [Footnote 036: This conclusion concerning the dissociated state of  mankind, is confirmed by all the early writers, with whose descriptions  of primitive times no other conclusion is reconcileable.]      [Footnote 037: Justin. L. 2. C. 2.]      [Footnote 038: Sallust. Bell. Jug.]      [Footnote 039: Sallust. Bell. Catil.]      [Footnote 040: Ammianus Marcellinus. L. 31.

As we have thus traced the situation of man from unbounded liberty to  subordination, it will be proper to carry our inquiries farther, and to  consider, who first obtained the pre-eminence in these _primoeval  societies_, and by what particular methods it was obtained.    There were only two ways, by which such an event could have been  produced, by _compulsion_ or _consent_. When mankind first saw  the necessity of government, it is probable that many had conceived the  desire of ruling. To be placed in a new situation, to be taken from the  common herd, to be the first, distinguished among men, were thoughts,  that must have had their charms. Let us suppose then, that these  thoughts had worked so unusually on the passions of any particular  individual, as to have driven him to the extravagant design of obtaining  the preeminence by force. How could his design have been accomplished?  How could he forcibly have usurped the jurisdiction at a time, when, all  being equally free, there was not a single person, whose assistance he  could command? Add to this, that, in a state of universal liberty, force  had been repaid by force, and the attempt had been fatal to the usurper.    As _empire_ then could never have been gained at first by  _compulsion_, so it could only have been obtained by _consent_;  and as men were then going to make an important sacrifice,  for the sake of their _mutual_ happiness, so he alone could  have obtained it, (not whose _ambition_ had greatly distinguished  him from the rest) but in whose _wisdom, justice, prudence_,  and _virtue_, the whole community could confide.    To confirm this reasoning, we shall appeal, as before, to facts; and  shall consult therefore the history of those nations, which having just  left their former state of _independent society_, were the very  people that established _subordination_ and _government_.
