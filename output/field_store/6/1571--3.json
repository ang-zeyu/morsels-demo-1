So much  for the setting: and of course they had a costly banquet.    Afterward Nero sang publicly with zither accompaniment and drove a  chariot, clad in the costume of the Greens and wearing a charioteer's  helmet. This made Tiridates disgusted with him; but for Corbulo the  visitor had only praise and deemed the one thing against him to be that he  would put up with such a master. Indeed, he made no concealment of his  views to Nero's face, but one day said to him: \"Master, you have in  Corbulo a good slave.\" The person addressed, however, did not comprehend  his speech.--In all other matters he flattered the emperor and ingratiated  himself most skillfully, with the result that he received all kinds of  gifts, said to have possessed in the aggregate a value of five thousand  myriads, and obtained permission to rebuild Artaxata. Moreover, he took  with him from Rome many artisans, some of whom he got from Nero, and some  whom he persuaded by offers of high wages. Corbulo, however, would not let  them all cross into Armenia, but only the ones whom Nero had given him.  That caused Tiridates to admire him all the more and to despise his chief.    [Sidenote:--7--] The return was made not by the same route as he followed  in coming,--through Illyricum and north of the Ionian Gulf,--but instead  he sailed from Brundusium to Dyrrachium. He viewed also the cities of  Asia, which helped to increase his amazement at the strength and beauty of  the Roman empire.    Tiridates one day viewed an exhibition of pancratium. One of the  contestants fell to the ground and was being pummeled by his opponent.  When the prince saw it, he exclaimed: \"That's an unfair contest. It isn't  fair that a man who has fallen should be beaten.\"    On rebuilding Artaxata Tiridates named it Neronia. But Vologaesus though  often summoned refused to come to Nero, and finally, when the latter's  invitations became burdensome to him, sent back a despatch to this effect:  \"It is far easier for you than for me to traverse so great a body of  water. Therefore, if you will come to Asia, we can then arrange [where we  shall be able] to meet each other.\" [Such was the message which the  Parthian wrote at last.]    [Sidenote:--8--] Nero though angry at him did not sail against him, nor  yet against the Ethiopians or the Caspian Pylae, as he had intended. [He  saw that the subjugation of these regions demanded time and labor and  hoped that they would submit to him of their own accord:] and he sent  spies to both places. But he did cross over into Greece, not at all as  Flamininus or Mummius or as Agrippa and Augustus his ancestors had done,  but for the purpose of chariot racing, of playing and singing, of making  proclamations, and of acting in tragedies. Rome was not enough for him,  nor Pompey's theatre, nor the great hippodrome, but he desired also a  foreign tour, in order to become, as he said, victor in all the four  contests. [Footnote: Literally \"victor of the periodos.\" This was a name  applied to an athlete who had conquered in the Pythian, Isthmian, Nemean  and Olympian games.] And a multitude not only of Augustans but of other  persons were taken with him, large enough, if it had been a hostile host,  to have subdued both Parthians and all other nations. But they were the  kind you would have expected Nero's soldiers to be, and the arms they  carried were zithers and plectra, masks and buskins. The victories Nero  won were such as befitted that sort of army, and he overcame Terpnus and  Diodorus and Pammenes, instead of Philip or Perseus or Antiochus. It is  probable that his purpose in forcing the Pammenes referred to, who had  been in his prime in the reign of Gaius, to compete in spite of his age,  was that he might overcome him and vent his dislike in abuse of his  statues.    [Sidenote: A.D. 67 (?)] [Sidenote:--9--] Had he done only this, he would  have been the subject of ridicule. So how could one endure to hear about,  let alone seeing, an emperor, an Augustus, listed on the program among the  contestants, training his voice, practicing certain songs, wearing long  hair on his head but with his chin shaven, throwing his toga over his  shoulder in the races, walking about with one or two attendants, eyeing  his adversaries suspiciously and ever and anon throwing out a word to them  in the midst of a boxing match; how he dreaded the directors of the games  and the wielders of the whip and spent money on all of them secretly to  avoid being shown up in his true colors and whipped; and how all that he  did to make himself victor in the citharoedic contest only contributed to  his defeat in the Contest of the Caesars? How find words to denounce the  wickedness of this proscription in which it was not [Footnote: [Greek: oi]  supplied by Reiske.] Sulla that bulletined the names of others, but Nero  bulletined his own name? What victory less deserves the name than that by  which one receives the olive, the laurel, the parsley, or the fir-tree  garland, and loses the political crown? And why should one bewail these  acts of his alone, seeing that he also by treading on the high-soled  buskins lowered himself from his eminence of power, and by hiding behind  the mask lost the dignity of his sovereignty to beg in the guise of a  runaway slave, to be led like a blind man, to conceive, to bear children,  to go mad [to drive a chariot], as he acted out time after time the story  of Oedipus, and of Thyestes, of Heracles and Alemeon, and of Orestes? The  masks he wore were sometimes made to resemble the characters and sometimes  had his own likeness. The women's masks were all fashioned to conform to  the features of Sabina [in order that though dead she might still move in  stately procession. All the situations that common actors simulate in  their acting he, too, would undertake to present, by speech, by action, by  being acted upon,--save only that] golden chains were used to bind him:  apparently it was not thought proper for a Roman emperor to be bound in  iron shackles.    [Sidenote:--10--] All this behavior, nevertheless, the soldiers and all  the rest saw, endured, and approved. They entitled him Pythian Victor,  Olympian Victor, National Victor, Absolute Victor, besides all the usual  expressions, and of course added to these names the honorific designations  belonging to his imperial office, so that every one of them had \"Caesar\"  and \"Augustus\" as a tag.    He conceived a dislike for a certain man because while he was speaking the  man frowned and was not overlavish of his praises; and so he drove him  away and would not let him come into his presence. He persisted in his  refusal to grant him audience, and when the person asked: \"Where shall I  go, then?\" Phoebus, Nero's freedman, replied: \"To the deuce!\"    No one of the people ventured either to pity or to hate the wretched  creature. One of the soldiers, to be sure, on seeing him bound, grew  indignant, ran up, and set him free. Another in reply to a question: \"What  is the emperor doing?\" had to answer: \"He is in labor pains,\" for Nero was  then acting the part of Canace. Not one of them conducted himself in a way  at all worthy of a Roman. Instead, because so much money fell to their  share, they offered prayers that he might give many such performances and  they in this way get still more.    [Sidenote:--11--] And if things had merely gone on like this, the affair,  while being a source of shame and of ridicule alike, would still have been  deemed free from danger. But as a fact he devastated the whole of Greece  precisely as if he had been despatched to some war and without regard to  the fact that he had declared the country free, also slaying great numbers  [of men, women and children. At first he commanded the children and  freedmen of those who were executed to leave him half their property at  their death, and allowed the original victims to make wills in order to  make it seem less likely that he had killed them for their money; and he  invariably took all that was bequeathed to him, if not more. In case any  one left to him or to Tigillinus less than they were expecting, the wills  were of no avail.--Later he deprived persons of their _entire_  property and banished all their children at once by one decree. Not even  this satisfied him, but he destroyed not a few of the exiles.] For no one  could begin to enumerate all the confiscated possessions of men allowed to  live and all the votive offerings that he stole from the very temples in  Rome. [The despatch-bearers hurried hither and thither with no piece of  news other than \"kill this man!\" or that that man was dead. No private  messages, only state documents, were delivered; for Nero had taken many of  the foremost men to Greece under pretence of needing some assistance from  them merely in order that they might perish there. [Sidenote:--12--] The  whole population of Rome and Italy he surrendered like captives to a  certain Helius, a Caesarian. The latter had been given absolutely complete  authority, so that he might confiscate, banish, and put to death (even  before notifying Nero) ordinary persons, knights, and senators alike.]    Thus the Roman domain was at that time a slave to two emperors at  once,--Nero and Helius; and I do not feel able to say which was the worse.  In most respects they behaved entirely alike, and the one point of  difference was that the descendant of Augustus was emulating  zither-players, whereas the freedman of Claudius was emulating Caesars. I  consider the acts of Tigillinus as a part of Nero's career because he was  constantly with him: but Polyclitus and Calvia Crispinilla by themselves  plundered, sacked, despoiled all the places they could get at. The former  was associated with Helius at Rome, and the latter with Sabina, born  Sporus. Calvia had been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10891"],[0,"Algonquin Indian Tales (#10)"],[1,"dived under the water again. The pursuit was so exciting that these cruel  men did not notice how far out from land they had now come. They did,  however, after a time see their danger, for suddenly a fierce gale sprang  up, and the waves rose in such fury that they upset the canoes and all of  the wicked men were drowned. When the old grandmother saw this she once  more exerted the magical powers with which she had been intrusted by  Wakonda, and calling to her grandson to return home he instantly complied  with her request. He speedily swam back to her, and she at once transformed  him into his human form.    \"Thus freed from his tormentors, he very rapidly grew up to manhood and  became a great hunter, and was kind to his grandmother as long as she  lived.\"          CHAPTER VI.      Souwanas Tells of the Origin and Queer Doings of  Nanahboozhoo--How He Lost His Brother Nahpootee,  the Wolf--Why the Kingfisher Wears a White Collar.    \"Who was this Nanahboozhoo that we are hearing so much about?\"    Thus was the old story-teller addressed by Sagastao, who always was anxious  to learn about those who interested him.    The old man began in this way:    \"When the great mountains are wrapped in the clouds we do not see them very  well. So it is with Nanahboozhoo. The long years that have passed since he  lived have, like the fogs and mists, made it less easy to say exactly who  he really was, but I will try to tell you. Nanahboozhoo was not from one  tribe only, but from all the Indians. Hence it is that his very name is so  different.    \"The Ojibway call him Mishawabus--Great Rabbit; the Menomini call him  Manabush. He had other names also. One tribe called him Jouskeha, another  Messou, another Manabozho, and another Hiawatha. His father was  Mudjekeewis, the West Wind. There was an old woman named Nokomis, the  granddaughter of the moon, who had a daughter whose name was Wenonah. She  was the mother of twin boys, but at their birth she died and so did one of  the boys. Nokomis wrapped the living child in soft dry grass, laid it on  the ground at one end of her wigwam, and placed over it a great wooden bowl  to protect it from harm. Then in her grief she took up the body of Wenonah,  her daughter, and buried it, with the dead child, at some distance from her  wigwam. When she returned from thus laying away her dead she sat down in  her wigwam, and for four days mourned her loss. At the end of that time she  heard a slight noise in her wigwam, which she soon found came from that  wooden bowl. Then as the bowl moved she suddenly remembered the living  child, which she had forgotten in her great grief at the loss of its  mother. When she removed the bowl from its place, instead of there being  the baby boy she had placed there she beheld a little white rabbit, and on  taking it up she said, 'O my dear little rabbit, my Manabush!' Nokomis took  great care of it and it grew very rapidly.    \"One day, when Manabush was quite large, it sat up on its haunches and  hopped slowly across the floor of the wigwam, and caused the earth to  tremble.    \"When the bad Windegoos, or evil spirits who dwell underground, felt the  earth to thus tremble they said, 'What is the matter? What has happened? A  great Munedoo (spirit) is born somewhere.' And at once they began to devise  means by which they might kill Manabush, or Nanahboozhoo, as he was now  called, when they should find him.    \"But Nanahboozhoo did not long continue to look like a rabbit. As he was  superior to other people he could change himself to any form he liked. He  was most frequently seen as a fine strong young Indian hunter. He called  the people his uncles. When he grew up he said to his grandmother, the old  Nokomis, that the time had come when he should prepare himself to go and  help his uncles, the people, to better their condition. This he was able to  do, seeing he was more than human, for his father was the West Wind and his  mother a great-granddaughter of the moon. Sometimes he was the beautiful  white rabbit; then he would be a wolf or a wolverine; then he would be a  lovely bird. He could even change himself to look like a dry old stump or a  beautiful tree. Sometimes he would be like a little half-frozen rabbit;  then he would be a mighty magician, and often a little snake. He was just  as changeable in his disposition as in his outward appearance. Sometimes he  was doing the best things imaginable for his uncles, the Indian people, and  at other times he was full of mischief and trickery. But on the whole he  was a friend, and although quick-tempered and fiery yet he did lots of fine  things for the people, for he was really one of the best of the Munedoos of  the early times.    \"When the time came for him to leave his grandmother's wigwam he built one  for himself, and then he asked Nokomis to prepare for him the sacred  magical musical sticks which she alone could make. His grandmother made  him four sticks, and with these he used to beat time when singing his queer  songs. Some of them were very queer, and ended up with 'He! he! ho! ho! ha!  ha! hi! hi!' Others were in reference to some special benefits he would  confer on his uncles. In one of them, referring to his going to steal the  fire for them, he sings:      \"'Help to my uncles I'm bringing,    Their sorrows I'll change into singing.    From their enemies the fire I'll steal,    That its warmth the children may feel.      \"'Disguised will be Nanahboozhoo,    That his work may the better be done;    But his jolly deeds ever will tell who    Has been sporting around in his fun.'    \"At first he was a jolly fellow, full of fun, and did lots of good things  for his uncles. He showed them the plants and roots good for food, and  taught them the arts of surgery and medicine, but as the years went by he  did some things that caused him to be feared very much. His uncles always  went to him when they got into trouble, but whether he would help them or  not depended much on the humor he was in when they came.    [Illustration: The beautiful reflections in the water.]    \"After he had lived for years in the first wigwam which he had built, and  taught the people of the earth many things, his father, the West Wind, held  a council with the North Wind and the South Wind and the East Wind, and  as Nanahboozhoo was never married, and was living such a lonely life, they  determined to restore to life, and give to reside with him, his twin  brother who had died at his birth. The name of this brother was Nahpootee,  which means the Skillful Hunter. Nanahboozhoo was very fond of him, and  took great care of him. He grew very rapidly, and he and Nanahboozhoo were  very great friends. Like Nanahboozhoo, Nahpootee could disguise himself in  any form he chose. One favorite form he often assumed was that of a wolf,  as he was often away on hunting excursions. The evil spirits, or Windegoos,  who dwell under the land and sea, had never been able to do much harm to  Nanahboozhoo, he was too clever for them; and although they often tried he  generally worsted them. Now they were doubly angry when they heard that  Nahpootee had been restored to life and was living with him. Nanahboozhoo  warned his brother of their enmity, and of the necessity of being on his  guard against them.    \"These brothers moved far away and built their wigwam in a lonely country  on the shore of a great lake which is now called Mirror Lake, because of  its beautiful reflections. Here, as he was a hunter, Nahpootee was kept  busy supplying the wigwam with food. Once, while he was away hunting,  Nanahboozhoo discovered that some of the evil Munedoos dwelt in the bottom  of the very lake on the shores of which they had built their wigwam. So he  warned his brother, Nahpootee, never to cross that lake, but always to go  around on the shore, and for some time he remembered this warning and was  not attacked. But one cold winter day, when he had been out for a long time  hunting, he found himself exactly on the opposite side of the lake from the  wigwam. The ice seemed strong, and as the distance was shorter he decided  that, rather than walk around on the shore, he would cross on the ice. When  about half-way across the lake the ice broke, he was seized by the evil  Munedoos and drowned.    \"When Nahpootee failed to return to the wigwam Nanahboozhoo was filled with  alarm and at once began searching everywhere for his loved, lost brother.  One day when he was walking under some trees at the lake he beheld, high up  among the branches, Ookiskimunisew, the kingfisher.    \"'What are you doing there?' asked Nanahboozhoo.    \"'The bad Munedoos have killed Nahpootee,' Ookiskimunisew replied, 'and  soon they are going to throw his body up on the shore and I am going to  feast on it!'    \"This answer made Nanahboozhoo very angry, but he concealed his feelings.    \"'Come down here, handsome bird,' he said, 'and I'll give you this collar  to hang on your neck.'    \"The kingfisher suspected that the speaker was Nanahboozhoo, the brother of  Nahpootee, and he was afraid to descend.    \"'Come down, and have no fear,' said Nanahboozhoo, in a friendly tone. 'I  only want to give you this beautiful necklace to wear, with the white  shell hanging from it.'    \"On hearing this the kingfisher came down, but suspecting that Nanahboozhoo  would be up to some of his tricks he kept a sharp watch on him.  Nanahboozhoo placed the necklace about the neck of the bird so that the  beautiful white shell should be over the breast. Then he pretended to tie  the ends behind, but just as he had made a half knot in the cord, and was  going to tighten it and strangle the bird, the latter was too quick for him  and suddenly slipped away and escaped. He kept the necklace, however, and  the white spot may be seen on the breast of the kingfisher to this day.    \"Soon after this the shade or ghost of Nahpootee appeared to Nanahboozhoo  and told him that, as his"]]]
