[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13127"],[0,"Observations on the Mussulmauns of India (#10)"],[1,"emen's assembly--it is  called goattur.[26] The truth is, their health would suffer from any long  disuse of tobacco-leaf, lime, and a bitter gum,[27] which are in general  use with the pawn; the latter is of a warm aromatic nature, and imparts a  fine flavour to the other ingredients; but, as it is considered a great  indulgence to eat pawn, they abstain from it altogether during  Mahurrum;--the mixture, they say, is only allowed for health's sake.    When visitors call on the Mussulmaun ladies at Mahurrum, the goattur is  presented on trays, accompanied by bags, neatly embroidered in silver and  gold, of many different shapes and patterns, mostly their own work and  invention; they are called buttooah[28] and jhaumdanies.[29]    The variety of ornaments, which constitute the great delight of all  classes of females in India, are entirely laid aside, from the first hour  of Mahurrum, until the period for mourning concludes. I never heard of any  people so thoroughly attached to ornaments as the females of India are  generally. They are indulged in this foible--pardonable it may be--by  their husbands and parents. The wealthiness of a family may often be  judged by a single glance at the principal lady of the zeenahnah, who  seldom omits doing honour to her husband, by a full display of the  precious metals, with a great variety of gems or jewels on ordinary  occasions. The men of all ranks are proud of their wives' finery; even the  poorest hold in derision all ornament that is not composed of sterling  metal, of which they seem excellent judges. The massy chains of gold or  silver, the solid bangles for the arms and ancles, the nut[30] (nose-ring)  of gold wire, on which is strung a ruby between two pearls, worn only by  married women; the joshun[31] (armlet), of silver or gold, often set with  precious stones; the many rings for the fingers, thumbs, and toes, form  the daily dress of a lady;--but I must not digress further. These are all  removed from the person, as soon as the moon is seen, when the first day  of Mahurrum commences; the hair is unloosed from its usual confinement,  and allowed to flow in disorder about the person; the coloured  pyjaamahs[32] and deputtahs[33] are removed, with every other article of  their usual costume, for a suit that, with them, constitutes  mourning--some choose black, others grey, slate, or green, and the widow  wears white from the day her husband dies.    A widow never alters her style of dress, neither does she wear a single  ornament, during her widowhood, which generally lasts with her life. I  never heard of one single instance, during my twelve years' residence  amongst them, of a widow marrying again--they have no law to prohibit it;  and I have known some ladies, whose affianced husbands died before the  marriage was concluded, who preferred a life of solitude and prayer,  although many other overtures were made.[34]    Many of the rigidly zealous, among the females, mortify themselves by  wearing their suit of mourning, during the ten days, without changing; the  dress is worn next the skin, and, in very warm weather, must be  comfortless after the first day--but so it is; and so many are the  varieties of self-inflicted privations, at this period, that my letter  might be filled with the observations I have made. I cannot, however, omit  to mention my old woman-servant (ayah[35]), whose mode of abstinence, in  remembrance of Hosein, is rigidly severe; my influence does not prevail in  dissuading her, although I fear the consequences to her health will be  seriously felt if she persist in the fulfilment of her self-imposed trial.  This poor old creature resolves on not allowing one drop of water, or any  liquid, to pass her lips during the ten days' mourning; as she says, 'her  Emaum, Hosein, and his family, suffered from thirst at Kraabaallah, why  should such a creature as she is be indulged with water?' This shows the  temper of the people generally; my ayah is a very ignorant old woman, yet  she respects her Emaum's memory.[36]    The Tazia, you are to understand, graces the houses of all good  Mussulmauns in India, who are not of the sect called Soonies. This model  of their Emaum's tomb is an object of profound respect. Hindoos, even, on  approaching the shrine, bow their heads with much solemn gravity; I often  fancied they mistook the Tazia for a Bootkhanah[37] (the house of an idol).    It is creditable to the Mussulmauns, that they do not restrict any  profession of people from visiting their assemblies; there is free  admission granted when the Emaum-baarah is first lighted up, until the  hour of performing the service, when strangers, that is the multitude, are  civilly requested to retire. Every one is expected, on entering the  outward verandah, to leave their shoes at the threshold of the  sanctuary;[38] none but Europeans have any occasion to be reminded of this,  as it is a well known and general observance with all degrees of natives  in Asia. The servants, in charge of the Emaum-baarah, are responsible for  the due observance of respect to the place, and when any foreigners are  advancing, they are politely requested to leave their shoes outside; which  must be complied with, or they cannot possibly be admitted.    Some few years since, a party of young gentlemen, from cantonments, had  made up their minds to evade the necessity for removing their boots, on  the occasion of a visit to one of the great men's Emaum-baarahs, at a  Native city; they had provided themselves with white socks, which they  drew over their boots before leaving their palkies. The cheat was  discovered by the servants in attendance, after they had been admitted;  they made a precipitate retreat to avoid the consequences of a  representation to the Resident, by the proprietor of the Emaum-baarah; who,  hearing of the circumstance, made all possible inquiry, without, however,  discovering the names of the gentlemen, who had thus, in his opinion,  violated the sanctuary.    The Natives are aware that the Resident sets the bright example of  conforming to the observances of the people, over whom he is placed as  governor and guardian; and that he very properly discountenances every  attempt of his countrymen to infringe on their rights, prejudices, or  privileges; and they have, to my knowledge, always looked up to him as to  a parent and a friend, from the first to the last day of his exalted  station amongst them. Many a tear marked the regret of the Natives, when  their best, their kindest, earthly friend quitted the city he had blessed  by his presence; and to the latest page of their history, his memory will  doubtless be cherished with sincere veneration and respectful  attachment.[39]    The poor people vie with their rich neighbours, in making a brilliant  light in their little halls containing the Tazia; the very poorest are  liberal in the expenditure of oil and tallow candles--I might say  extravagantly so, but for the purity of their intentions, supposing it to  be a duty--and they certainly manifest their zeal and respect to the  utmost of their power; although many, to my knowledge, live all the year  round on the very coarsest fare, to enable them to show this reverence to  their Emaum's memory.    The ladies assemble, in the evening, round the Tazia they have set up in  their purdahed privacy--female friends, slaves, and servants, surrounding  the mistress of the house, in solemn gravity.    The few females who have been educated are in great request at this season;  they read the Dhie Mudgelluss, and chant the Musseeah with good effect.  These women, being hired for the purpose, are detained during the ten days;  when the Mahurrum ceases, they are dismissed to their own homes, loaded  with the best gifts the good lady their employer can conveniently spare,  commensurate with the services performed. These educated females are  chiefly daughters of poor Syaads, who have not been married for the lack  of a dowry; they live devoutly in the service of God, according to their  faith. They are sometimes required, in the families of the nobility, to  teach the Khoraun to the young ladies, and, in that capacity, they are  called Oustaardie, or more familiarly Artoojee.[40]    As I have mentioned before, the Musseeah narrative of the sufferings at  Kraabaallah is a really pathetic and interesting composition; the work  being conveyed in the language of the country, every word is understood,  and very deeply felt, by the females in all these assemblies, who, having  their hearts softened by the emphatic chantings of the readers, burst into  violent tears and sobbings of the most heart-rending description. As in  the gentlemen's assembly, they conclude with Mortem, in which they  exercise themselves until they are actually exhausted; indeed, many  delicate females injure their health by the violence and energy of their  exertions, which they nevertheless deem a most essential duty to perform,  at all hazards, during the continuance of Mahurrum.    This method of keeping Mahurrum is not in strict obedience to the  Mahumudan laws; in which code may be found prohibitions against all  violent and excessive grief--tearing the hair, or other expressions of  ungovernable sorrow.[41]    I have observed that the Maulvees, Moollahs,[42] and devoutly religious  persons, although mixing with the enthusiasts on these occasions, abstain  from the violent exhibition of sorrows which the uninformed are so prone  to indulge in. The most religious men of that faith feel equal, perhaps  greater sympathy, for the sufferings of the Emaums, than those who are  less acquainted with the precepts of the Khoraun; they commemorate the  Mahurrum without parade or ostentatious display, and apparently wear  mourning on their hearts, with their garb, the full term of forty  days--the common period of mourning for a beloved object; but these  persons never join in Mortem, beating breasts, or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13166"],[0,"The Psalms of David (#10)"],[1,"took its birth,  And rests on his command.    6 He scorns the angry nations' rage,  And breaks their vain designs;  His counsel stands thro' every age,  And in full glory shines.      Psalm 33:2. Second Part. C. M.  Creatures vain, and God all-sufficient.    1 Blest is the nation where the Lord  Hath fix'd his gracious throne;  Where he reveals his heavenly word,  And calls their tribes his own.    2 His eye, with infinite survey,  Does the whole world behold;  He form'd us all of equal clay,  And knows our feeble mould.    3 Kings are not rescu'd by the force  Of armies from the grave;  Nor speed nor courage of an horse  Can the bold rider save,    4 Vain is the strength of beasts or men  To hope for safety thence;  But holy souls from God obtain  A strong and sure defence.    5 God is their fear, and God their trust,  When plagues or famine spread,  His watchful eye secures the just  Amongst ten thousand dead.    6 Lord, let our hearts in thee rejoice,  And bless us from thy throne;  For we have made thy word our choice,  And trust thy grace alone.      Psalm 33:3. First Part. As the 113th Psalm.  Works of creation and providence.    1 Ye holy souls, in God rejoice,  Your Maker's praise becomes your voice;  Great is your theme, your songs be new:  Sing of his name, his word, his ways,  His works of nature and of grace,  How wise and holy, just and true.    2 Justice and truth he ever loves,  And the whole earth his goodness proves,  His word the heavenly arches spread;  How wide they shine from north to south!  And by the Spirit of his mouth  Were all the starry armies made.    3 He gathers the wide-flowing seas,  Those watery treasures know their place,  In the vast storehouse of the deep:  He spake, and gave all nature birth;  And fires, and seas, and heaven, and earth,  His everlasting orders keep.    4 Let mortals tremble and adore  A God of such resistless power,  Nor dare indulge their feeble rage:  Vain are your thoughts, and weak your hands;  But his eternal counsel stands,  And rules the world from age to age.      Psalm 33:4. Second Part. As the 113th Psalm.  Creatures vain, and God all-sufficient.    1 O Happy nation, where the Lord  Reveals the treasure of his word,  And builds his church his earthly throne!  His eye the heathen world surveys,  He form'd their hearts, he knows their ways;  But God their Maker is unknown.    2 Let kings rely upon their host,  And of his strength the champion boast;  In vain they boast, in vain rely;  In vain we trust the brutal force,  Or speed, or courage of an horse,  To guard his rider, or to fly.    3 The eye of thy compassion, Lord,  Doth more secure defence afford  When death or dangers threatening stand;  Thy watchful eye preserves the just,  Who make thy name their fear and trust,  When wars or famine waste the land.    4 In sickness or the bloody field,  Thou our physician, thou our shield,  Send us salvation from thy throne;  We wait to see thy goodness shine;  Let us rejoice in help divine,  For all our hope is God alone.      Psalm 34:1. First Part. L. M.  God's care of the saints; or, Deliverance by prayer.    1 Lord, I will bless thee all my days,  Thy praise shall dwell upon my tongue;  My soul shall glory in thy grace,  While saints rejoice to hear the song.    2 Come, magnify the Lord with me,  Come, let us all exalt his name;  I sought th' eternal God, and he  Has not expos'd my hope to shame.    3 I told him all my secret grief,  My secret groaning reach'd his ears;  He gave my inward pains relief,  And calm'd the tumult of my fears.    4 To him the poor lift up their eyes,  Their faces feel the heavenly shine;  A beam of mercy from the skies  Fills them with light and joy divine.    6 His holy angels pitch their tents  Around the men that serve the Lord;  O fear and love him, all his saints,  Taste of his grace and trust his word.    6 The wild young lions, pinch'd with pain  And hunger, roar thro' all the wood;  But none shall seek the Lord in vain,  Nor want supplies of real good.      Psalm 34:2. 11-22. Second Part. L. M.  Religious education; or, Instructions of piety.    1 Children in years and knowledge young,  Your parents' hope, your parents' joy,  Attend the counsels of my tongue,  Let pious thoughts your minds employ.    2 If you desire a length of days,  And peace to crown your mortal state,  Restrain your feet from impious ways,  Your lips from slander and deceit.    3 The eyes of God regard his saints,  His ears are open to their cries;  He sets his frowning face against  The sons of violence and lies.    4 To humble souls and broken hearts  God with his grace is ever nigh;  Pardon and hope his love imparts  When men in deep contrition lie.    5 He tell their tears, he counts their groans,  His Son redeems their souls from death;  His Spirit heals their broken bones,  They in his praise employ their breath.      Psalm 34:3. 1-10. First Part. C. M.  Prayer and Praise for eminent deliverance.    1 I'll bless the Lord from day to day;  How good are all his ways!  Ye humble souls that use to pray,  Come, help my lips to praise.    2 Sing to the honour of his name,  How a poor sufferer cry'd,  Nor was his hope expos'd to shame,  Nor was his suit deny'd.    3 When threatening sorrows round me stood,  And endless fears arose,  Like the loud billows of a flood,  Redoubling all my woes;    4 I told the Lord my sore distress  With heavy groans and tears,  He gave my sharpest torments ease,  And silenc'd all my fears.    PAUSE.    5 [O sinners, come and taste his love,  Come, learn his pleasant ways,  And let your own experience prove  The sweetness of his grace.    6 He bids his angels pitch their tents  Round where his children dwell  What ills their heavenly care prevents  No earthly tongue can tell.]    7 [O love the Lord, ye saints of his;  His eye regards the just;  How richly blest their portion is  Who make the Lord their trust!    8 Young lions pinch'd with hunger roar,  And famish in the wood;  But God supplies his holy poor  With every needful good.]      Psalm 34:4. 11-22. Second Part. C. M.  Exhortations to peace and Holiness.    1 Come, children, learn to fear the Lord;  And that your days be long,  Let not a false or spiteful word  Be found upon your tongue.    2 Depart from mischief, practise love,  Pursue the works of peace;  So shall the Lord your ways approve,  And set your souls at ease.    3 His eyes awake to guard the just,  His ears attend their cry;  When broken spirits dwell in dust,  The God of grace is nigh.    4 What tho' the sorrows here they taste  Are sharp and tedious too,  The Lord, who saves them all at last,  Is their supporter now.    5 Evil shall smite the wicked dead;  But God secures his own,  Prevents the mischief when they slide,  Or heals the broken bone.    6 When desolation like a flood,  O'er the proud sinner rolls,  Saints find a refuge in their God,  For he redeem'd their souls.      Psalm 35:1. 1-9. First Part.  Prayer and faith of persecuted saints;  or, Imprecations mixed with charity.    1 Now plead my cause, almighty God,  With all the Sons of strife;  And fight against the men of blood,  Who fight against my life.    2 Draw out thy spear and stop their way,  Lift thine avenging rod;  But to my soul in mercy say,  \"I am thy Saviour God.\"    3 They plant their snares to catch my feet,  And nets of mischief spread;  Plunge the destroyers in the pit  That their own hands have made.    4 Let fogs and darkness hide their way,  And slippery be their ground;  Thy wrath shall make their lives a prey,  And all their rage confound.    5 They fly like chaff before the wind,  Before thine angry breath;  The angel of the Lord behind  Pursues them down to death.    6 They love the road that leads to hell;  Then let the rebels die  Whose malice is implacable  Against the Lord on high.    7 But if thou hast a chosen few  Amongst that impious race,  Divide them from the bloody crew  By thy surprising grace.    8 Then will I raise my tuneful voice  To make thy wonders known;  In their salvation I'll rejoice,  And bless thee for my own.      Psalm 35:2. 12-14. Second Part.  Love to enemies; or, The love of  Christ to sinners typified in David.    1 Behold the love, the generous love  That holy David shows;  Hark, how his sounding bowels move  To his afflicted foes!    2 When they are sick his soul complains,  And seems to feel the smart;  The spirit of the gospel reigns,  And melts his pious heart.    3 How did his flowing tears condole  As for a brother dead!  And fasting mortify'd his soul,  While for their life he pray'd.    4 They groan'd; and curs'd him on their bed,  Yet still he pleads and mourns;  And double blessings on his head  The righteous God returns.    5 O glorious type of heavenly grace!  Thus Christ the Lord appears;  While sinners curse, the Saviour prays,  And pities them with tears.    6 He, the true David, Israel's king,  Blest and belov'd of God,  To save us rebels dead in sin,  Paid his own dearest blood.      Psalm 36:1. 5-9. L. M.  The perfections and providence of God;  or, General providence and special grace.    1 High in the heavens, eternal God,  Thy goodness in full glory shines;  Thy truth shall break thro' every cloud  That veils and darkens thy designs.    2 For ever firm thy justice stands,  As mountains their foundations keep;  Wise are the wonders of thy hands;  Thy judgments are a mighty deep.    3 Thy providence is kind and large,  Both man and beast thy bounty share;  The whole creation is thy charge,  But saints are thy peculiar care.    4 My God! how excellent thy grace,  Whence all our hope and comfort springs!  The sons of Adam in distress  Fly to the shadow of thy wings.    5 From the provisions of thy house  We shall be fed with sweet repast;  There mercy like a river flows,  And brings salvation to our taste.    6 Life, like a fountain rich and free  Springs from the presence of the Lord;  And in thy light our souls shall see  The glories promis'd in thy"]]]
