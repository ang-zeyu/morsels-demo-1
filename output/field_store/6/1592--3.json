I have omitted many tradesmen who would be wanted here, and would find a  good livelihood among their country-folks only to get accidental work as  day-men or labourers (of which such a town would constantly employ many),  as also poor women for assistance in families (such as midwives, nurses,  &c.).    Adjacent to the town was to be a certain quantity of common-land for the  benefit of the cottages, that the poor might have a few sheep or cows, as  their circumstances required; and this to be appointed at the several  ends of the town.    There was a calculation made of what increase there would be, both of  wealth and people, in twenty years in this town; what a vast consumption  of provisions they would cause, more than the four thousand acres of land  given them would produce, by which consumption and increase so much  advantage would accrue to the public stock, and so many subjects be added  to the many thousands of Great Britain, who in the next age would be all  true-born Englishmen, and forget both the language and nation from whence  they came.  And it was in order to this that two ministers were  appointed, one of which should officiate in English and the other in High  Dutch, and withal to have them obliged by a law to teach all their  children both to speak, read, and write the English language.    Upon their increase they would also want barbers and glaziers, painters  also, and plumbers; a windmill or two, and the millers and their  families; a fulling-mill and a cloth-worker; as also a master clothier or  two for making a manufacture among them for their own wear, and for  employing the women and children; a dyer or two for dyeing their  manufactures; and, which above all is not to be omitted, four families at  least of smiths, with every one two servants--considering that, besides  all the family work which continually employs a smith, all the shoeing of  horses, all the ironwork of ploughs, carts, waggons, harrows, &c., must  be wrought by them.  There was no allowance made for inns and ale-houses,  seeing it would be frequent that those who kept public-houses of any sort  would likewise have some other employment to carry on.    This was the scheme for settling the Palatinates, by which means twenty  families of farmers, handsomely set up and supported, would lay a  foundation, as I have said, for six or seven hundred of the rest of their  people; and as the land in New Forest is undoubtedly good, and capable of  improvement by such cultivation, so other wastes in England are to be  found as fruitful as that; and twenty such villages might have been  erected, the poor strangers maintained, and the nation evidently be  bettered by it.  As to the money to be advanced, which in the case of  twenty such settlements, at 1,000 pounds each, would be 80,000 pounds,  two things were answered to it:--    1.  That the annual rent to be received for all those lands after twenty  years would abundantly pay the public for the first disburses on the  scheme above, that rent being then to amount to 40,000 pounds per annum.    2.  More money than would have done this was expended, or rather thrown  away, upon them here, to keep them in suspense, and afterwards starve  them; sending them a-begging all over the nation, and shipping them off  to perish in other countries.  Where the mistake lay is none of my  business to inquire.    I reserved this account for this place, because I passed in this journey  over the very spot where the design was laid out--namely, near Lyndhurst,  in the road from Rumsey to Lymington, whither I now directed my course.    Lymington is a little but populous seaport standing opposite to the Isle  of Wight, in the narrow part of the strait which ships sometimes pass  through in fair weather, called the Needles; and right against an ancient  town of that island called Yarmouth, and which, in distinction from the  great town of Yarmouth in Norfolk, is called South Yarmouth.  This town  of Lymington is chiefly noted for making fine salt, which is indeed  excellent good; and from whence all these south parts of England are  supplied, as well by water as by land carriage; and sometimes, though not  often, they send salt to London, when, contrary winds having kept the  Northern fleets back, the price at London has been very high; but this is  very seldom and uncertain.  Lymington sends two members to Parliament,  and this and her salt trade is all I can say to her; for though she is  very well situated as to the convenience of shipping I do not find they  have any foreign commerce, except it be what we call smuggling and  roguing; which, I may say, is the reigning commerce of all this part of  the English coast, from the mouth of the Thames to the Land's End of  Cornwall.    From hence there are but few towns on the sea-coast west, though there  are several considerable rivers empty themselves into the sea; nor are  there any harbours or seaports of any note except Poole.  As for  Christchurch, though it stands at the mouth of the Avon (which, as I have  said, comes down from Salisbury, and brings with it all the waters of the  south and east parts of Wiltshire, and receives also the Stour and  Piddle, two Dorsetshire rivers which bring with them all the waters of  the north part of Dorsetshire), yet it is a very inconsiderable poor  place, scarce worth seeing, and less worth mentioning in this account,  only that it sends two members to Parliament, which many poor towns in  this part of England do, as well as that.    From hence I stepped up into the country north-west, to see the ancient  town of Wimborne, or Wimborneminster; there I found nothing remarkable  but the church, which is indeed a very great one, ancient, and yet very  well built, with a very firm, strong, square tower, considerably high;  but was, without doubt, much finer, when on the top of it stood a most  exquisite spire--finer and taller, if fame lies not, than that at  Salisbury, and by its situation in a plainer, flatter country visible, no  question, much farther; but this most beautiful ornament was blown down  by a sudden tempest of wind, as they tell us, in the year 1622.    The church remains a venerable piece of antiquity, and has in it the  remains of a place once much more in request than it is now, for here are  the monuments of several noble families, and in particular of one king,  viz., King Etheldred, who was slain in battle by the Danes.  He was a  prince famed for piety and religion, and, according to the zeal of these  times, was esteemed as a martyr, because, venturing his life against the  Danes, who were heathens, he died fighting for his religion and his  country.  The inscription upon his grave is preserved, and has been  carefully repaired, so as to be easily read, and is as follows:--       \"In hoc loco quiescit Corpus S. Etheldredi, Regis West Saxonum,     Martyris, qui Anno Dom. DCCCLXXII., xxiii Aprilis, per Manos Danorum     Paganorum Occubuit.\"    In English thus:--       \"Here rests the Body of Holy Etheldred, King of the West Saxons, and     Martyr, who fell by the Hands of the Pagan Danes in the Year of our     Lord 872, the 23rd of April.\"    Here are also the monuments of the great Marchioness of Exeter, mother of  Edward Courtney, Earl of Devonshire, and last of the family of Courtneys  who enjoyed that honour; as also of John de Beaufort, Duke of Somerset,  and his wife, grandmother of King Henry VII., by her daughter Margaret,  Countess of Richmond.    This last lady I mention because she was foundress of a very fine free  school, which has since been enlarged and had a new benefactress in Queen  Elizabeth, who has enlarged the stipend and annexed it to the foundation.  The famous Cardinal Pole was Dean of this church before his exaltation.    Having said this of the church, I have said all that is worth naming of  the town; except that the inhabitants, who are many and poor, are chiefly  maintained by the manufacture of knitting stockings, which employs great  part indeed of the county of Dorset, of which this is the first town  eastward.    South of this town, over a sandy, wild, and barren country, we came to  Poole, a considerable seaport, and indeed the most considerable in all  this part of England; for here I found some ships, some merchants, and  some trade; especially, here were a good number of ships fitted out every  year to the Newfoundland fishing, in which the Poole men were said to  have been particularly successful for many years past.    The town sits in the bottom of a great bay or inlet of the sea, which,  entering at one narrow mouth, opens to a very great breadth within the  entrance, and comes up to the very shore of this town; it runs also west  up almost to the town of Wareham, a little below which it receives the  rivers Frome and Piddle, the two principal rivers of the county.    This place is famous for the best and biggest oysters in all this part of  England, which the people of Poole pretend to be famous for pickling; and  they are barrelled up here, and sent not only to London, but to the West  Indies, and to Spain and Italy, and other parts.  It is observed more  pearls are found in the Poole oysters, and larger, than in any other  oysters about England.    As the entrance into this large bay is narrow, so it is made narrower by  an island, called Branksey, which, lying the very mouth of the passage,  divides it into two, and where there is an old castle, called Branksey  Castle, built to defend the entrance, and this strength was very great  advantage to the trade of this port in the time of the late war with  France.

Mr. McCrae was strongly opposed to any discussion being raised in regard  to the question being considered in its financial aspects. They, as gas  engineers, did not require to trouble themselves with the doings of  investors. He regarded the Welsbach burner as an improved appliance for  consuming gas. It was an invention which was quite new to him, and as he  was not in possession of any facts which would enable him to condemn it,  he thought they ought, at least, to give it a fair trial. Referring to  the fragile nature of the \"mantle,\" he remarked that there were minds at  work aiming at giving a purer and more brilliant light from gas, and so  far he was of opinion that the light before them was a success. His  opinion as to the diffusibility of the light emitted from the burner  differed from that of Mr. Nelson, as he considered the light possessed  that quality in a high degree. He had no doubt that the minds already at  work on the incandescent light would seek out means for improving the  burner.           *       *       *       *       *    To varnish chromos, take equal quantities of linseed oil and oil of  turpentine; thicken by exposure to the sun and air until it becomes  resinous and half evaporated; then add a portion of melted beeswax.

An important addition will be made to the coins now in circulation by  the issue of the double florin, the design of which is shown in one of  our engravings. The reverse is composed of crowned shields, bearing the  arms of the United Kingdom arranged in the form of a cross between  scepters, a device which was first adopted for coins of Charles II. It  was designed by Thomas Simon, the greatest of all English engravers, and  it remains to be seen whether this handsome coin will be generally  popular. The reverse of the florin will for the future bear the same  design.    During the past year her majesty was pleased to signify her pleasure  that a portrait medallion, by Mr. J.E. Boehm, R.A., modeled from life,  should be substituted for the effigy which the coins have hitherto  borne. In the new effigy, her majesty appears crowned and veiled, with  the ribbon and star of the garter and the Victoria and Albert order. The  legend \"Victoria Dei Gratia Britanniarum Regina, Fidei Defensor\" is  variously arranged on the different coins, according to the exigencies  of the design.    The opportunity has at the same time been taken, with her majesty's  approval, for making certain alterations in the designs for the reverses  of some of the coins by abandoning those which did not appear to possess  sufficient artistic merit to warrant their retention. The reverse of the  sovereign will still bear the design of St. George and the Dragon, by  Pistrucci, first adopted for the sovereigns of George IV., and the  reverses of the half-sovereign and threepence remain unchanged, except  that the crown has been assimilated to that used for the new effigy. The  St. George and the Dragon design will be resumed for the five-pound  piece, the double sovereign, and the crown, this design having been  adopted for these pieces when originally struck. The half-crown will  bear the same reverse as that coin bore when first issued, a design of  considerable merit, by Merlin. During the last half century public taste  appears to have been satisfied, both in this country and abroad, with  some such insignificant design as a wreath surrounding words or figures  indicating the value of the coin; and the shilling and sixpence have,  during the present reign, been examples of this treatment. They will in  future, like the half-crown, bear the royal arms, crowned, and  surrounded by the garter.    The queen was further pleased to command that the fiftieth anniversary  of her majesty's accession should be commemorated by the issue of a  medal. The effigy for this medal, which is also from a medallion by Mr.  Boehm, has a somewhat more ornate veil than that on the coin; and on the  bust, in addition to the Victoria and Albert order, is shown the badge  of the imperial order of the crown of India. The reverse is a beautiful  work by Sir Frederic Leighton, President of the Royal Academy, of which  the following is a description: \"In the center a figure representing the  British empire sits enthroned, resting one hand on the sword of justice,  and holding in the other the symbol of victorious rule. A lion is seen  on each side of the throne. At the feet of the seated figure lies  Mercury, the God of Commerce, the mainstay of our imperial strength,  holding up in one hand a cup heaped with gold. Opposite to him sits the  Genius of Electricity and Steam. Below, again, five shields, banded  together, bear the names of the five parts of the globe, Europe, Asia,  Africa, America, and Australasia, over which the empire extends. On each  side of the figure of Empire stand the personified elements of its  greatness--on the right (of the spectator), Industry and Agriculture; on  the left, Science, Letters, and Art. Above, the occasion of the  celebration commemorated is expressed by two winged figures representing  the year 1887 (the advancing figure) and the year 1837 (with averted  head), holding each a wreath. Where these wreaths interlock, the letters  V.R.I. appear, and, over all, the words 'In Commemoration.'\"    The issue of both the new coins and the medal began on June 21, the day  appointed for the celebration of her majesty's jubilee.--_Illustrated  London News_.

[Footnote: A recent lecture delivered at Carpenters' Hall, London Wall,  E.C.--_Building News_.]    By Professor T. ROGER SMITH, F.R.I.B.A.      Timber, stone, earth, are the three materials most used by the builder  in all parts of the world. Where timber is very plentiful, as in Norway  or Switzerland, it is freely used, even though other materials are  obtainable, and seems to be preferred, notwithstanding the risk of fire  which attends its use. Where timber is scarce, and stone can be had,  houses are built of stone. Where there is no timber and no stone, they  are built of earth--sometimes in its natural state, sometimes made into  bricks and sun-dried, but more often made into bricks and burned.    London is one of the places that occupies a spot which has long ceased  to yield timber, and yields no stone, so we fall back on earth--burnt  into the form of bricks. Brick was employed in remote antiquity. The  Egyptians, who were great and skillful builders, used it sometimes; and  as we know from the book of Exodus, they employed the forced labor of  the captives or tributaries whom they had in their power in the hard  task of brick making; and some of their brick-built granaries and stores  have been recently discovered near the site of the battle of  Tel-el-Kebir.    The Assyrians and Babylonians made almost exclusive use of brickwork in  erecting the vast piles of buildings the shapeless ruins of which mark  the site of ancient Nineveh and of the cities of the valley of the  Euphrates. Their bricks, it is believed, were entirely sun-dried, not  burnt to fuse or vitrify them as ours are, and they have consequently  crumbled into mere mounds. The Assyrians also used fine clay tablets,  baked in the fire--in fact, a kind of terra cotta--for the purpose of  records, covering these tablets with beautifully executed inscriptions,  made with a pointed instrument while the clay was soft, and rendered  permanent by burning. We don't know much about Greek brickwork; but it  is probable that very little brick, if any, was made or used in any part  of Greece, as stone, marble, and timber abound there; but the Romans  made bricks everywhere, and used them constantly. They were fond of  mixing two or more materials together, as for example building walls in  concrete and inserting brickwork at intervals in horizontal layers to  act as courses of bond. They also erected buildings of which the walls  were wholly of brick. They turned arches of wide span in brickwork; and  they frequently laid in their walls at regular distances apart courses  of brick on edge and courses of sloping bricks, to which antiquaries  have given the name of herring-bone work.    The Roman bricks are interesting as records, for it was customary to  employ the soldiers on brick making, and to stamp the bricks with names  and dates; and thus the Roman bricks found in this country give us some  information as to the military commanders and legions occupying  different parts of England at different periods. Flue bricks, for the  passage of smoke under floors and in other situations, are sometimes  found. The Roman brick was often flat and large--in fact, more like our  common paving tiles, known as foot tiles, only of larger size than like  the bricks that we use. They vary, however, in size, shape, and  thickness. Not a few of them are triangular in shape, and these are  mostly employed as a sort of facing to concrete work, the point of the  triangle being embedded in the concrete and the broad base appearing  outside. After the Roman time, brick making seems to have almost ceased  in England for many centuries.    It is true we find remains of a certain number of massive brick  buildings erected not long after the Norman conquest; but on examination  it turns out that these were put up at places where there had been a  Roman town, and were built of Roman bricks obtained by pulling down  previous buildings.
