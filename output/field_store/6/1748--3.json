My  faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases  with all which is exclusively his own, lies at the foundation of the  sense of justice there is in me. I extend the principle to communities  of men as well as to individuals. I so extend it because it is  politically wise as well as naturally just,--politically wise in saving  us from broils about matters which do not concern us. Here, or at  Washington, I would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of Virginia,  or the cranberry laws of Indiana. The doctrine of self-government is  right,--absolutely and internally right; but it has no just application  as here attempted. Or perhaps I should rather say that whether it has  any application here depends upon whether a negro is not or is a man. If  he is not a man, in that case he who is a man may, as a matter of  self-government, do just what he pleases with him. But if the negro is a  man, is it not to that extent a total destruction of self-government to  say that he, too, shall not govern himself? When the white man governs  himself, that is self-government; but when he governs himself and also  governs another man, that is more than self-government,--that is  despotism. If the negro is a man, then my ancient faith teaches me that  \"all men are created equal,\" and that there can be no moral right in  connection with one man's making a slave of another.    Judge Douglas frequently, with bitter irony and sarcasm, paraphrases  our argument by saying: \"The white people of Nebraska are good enough to  govern themselves, but they are not good enough to govern a few  miserable negroes!\"    Well, I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are and will continue to  be as good as the average of people elsewhere. I do not say the  contrary. What I do say is that no man is good enough to govern another  man without that other's consent. I say this is the leading  principle,--the sheet-anchor of American republicanism.    Slavery is founded in the selfishness of man's nature,--opposition to it  in his love of justice. These principles are in eternal antagonism, and  when brought into collision so fiercely as slavery extension brings  them, shocks and throes and convulsions must ceaselessly follow. Repeal  the Missouri Compromise; repeal all compromises; repeal the Declaration  of Independence; repeal all past history,--you still cannot repeal human  nature. It still will be the abundance of man's heart that slavery  extension is wrong, and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth will  continue to speak....    The Missouri Compromise ought to be restored. Slavery may or may not be  established in Nebraska. But whether it be or not, we shall have  repudiated--discarded from the councils of the nation--the spirit of  compromise; for who, after this, will ever trust in a national  compromise? The spirit of mutual concession--that spirit which first  gave us the Constitution, and has thrice saved the Union--we shall have  strangled and cast from us for ever. And what shall we have in lieu of  it? The South flushed with triumph and tempted to excess; the North  betrayed, as they believed, brooding on wrong and burning for revenge.  One side will provoke, the other resent. The one will taunt, the other  defy; one aggresses, the other retaliates. Already a few in the North  defy all constitutional restraints, resist the execution of the Fugitive  Slave Law, and even menace the institution of slavery in the States  where it exists. Already a few in the South claim the constitutional  right to take and hold slaves in the free States, demand the revival of  the slave-trade, and demand a treaty with Great Britain by which  fugitive slaves may be reclaimed from Canada. As yet they are but few on  either side. It is a grave question for lovers of the Union, whether the  final destruction of the Missouri Compromise, and with it the spirit of  all compromise, will or will not embolden and embitter each of these,  and fatally increase the number of both.    ... Some men, mostly Whigs, who condemn the repeal of the Missouri  Compromise, nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration, lest they  be thrown in company with the Abolitionists. Will they allow me, as an  old Whig, to tell them good-humouredly that I think this is very silly?  Stand with anybody that stands right. Stand with him while he is right,  and part with him when he goes wrong. Stand with the Abolitionist in  restoring the Missouri Compromise, and stand against him when he  attempts to repeal the Fugitive Slave Law. In the latter case you stand  with the Southern disunionist. What of that? You are still right. In  both cases you are right In both cases you expose the dangerous  extremes. In both you stand on the middle ground and hold the ship level  and steady. In both you are national, and nothing less than national.  This is the good old Whig ground. To desert such ground because of any  company is to be less than a Whig, less than a man, less than an  American.    I particularly object to the new position which the avowed principle of  this Nebraska law gives to slavery in the body politic. I object to it  because it assumes that there can be moral right in the enslaving of one  man by another. I object to it as a dangerous dalliance for free  people--a sad evidence that, feeling over-prosperity, we forget right;  that liberty as a principle we have ceased to revere. I object to it  because the Fathers of the Republic eschewed and rejected it. The  argument of \"necessity\" was the only argument they ever admitted in  favour of slavery, and so far, and so far only as it carried them, did  they ever go. They found the institution existing among us, which they  could not help, and they cast the blame on the British king for having  permitted its introduction. Thus we see the plain, unmistakable spirit  of their age towards slavery was hostility to the principle, and  toleration only by necessity.    But now it is to be transformed into a _sacred right_.... Henceforth it  is to be the chief jewel of the nation,--the very figure-head of the  ship of State. Little by little, but steadily as man's march to the  grave, we have been giving up the old for the new faith. Near eighty  years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now  from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for  some men to enslave others is a sacred right of self-government. These  principles cannot stand together. They are as opposite as God and  Mammon; and whoever holds to the one must despise the other....    Our Republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust. Let us purify it.  Let us turn and wash it white in the spirit if not the blood of the  Revolution. Let us turn slavery from its claims of moral right, back  upon its existing legal rights and its arguments of necessity. Let us  return it to the position our fathers gave it, and there let it rest in  peace. Let us re-adopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it the  practices and policy which harmonize with it. Let North and South, let  all Americans, let all lovers of liberty everywhere, join in the great  and good work. If we do this, we shall not only have saved the Union,  but we shall have so saved it as to make and to keep it for ever worthy  of the saving.          _From Letter to the Hon. Geo. Robertson, Lexington, Kentucky.  Springfield, Illinois. August 15, 1855_      My dear Sir, ... You are not a friend of slavery in the abstract. In  that speech you spoke of \"the peaceful extinction of slavery\" and used  other expressions indicating your belief that the thing was, at some  time, to have an end. Since then we have had thirty-six years of  experience; and this experience has demonstrated, I think, that there is  no peaceful extinction of slavery in prospect for us. The signal failure  of Henry Clay and other good and great men, in 1849, to effect anything  in favour of gradual emancipation in Kentucky, together with a thousand  other signs, extinguishes that hope utterly. On the question of liberty,  as a principle, we are not what we have been. When we were the political  slaves of King George, and wanted to be free, we called the maxim that  \"all men are created equal\" a self-evident truth; but now when we have  grown fat, and have lost all dread of being slaves ourselves, we have  become so greedy to be _masters_ that we call the same maxim \"a  self-evident lie.\" The Fourth of July has not quite dwindled away; it is  still a great day for burning fire-crackers!    That spirit which desired the peaceful extinction of slavery has itself  become extinct with the _occasion_ and the _men_ of the Revolution.  Under the impulse of that occasion, nearly half the States adopted  systems of emancipation at once; and it is a significant fact that not a  single State has done the like since. So far as peaceful, voluntary  emancipation is concerned, the condition of the negro slave in America,  scarcely less terrible to the contemplation of the free mind, is now as  fixed and hopeless of change for the better as that of the lost souls of  the finally impenitent. The Autocrat of all the Russias will resign his  crown and proclaim his subjects free republicans, sooner than will our  American masters voluntarily give up their slaves.    Our political problem now is, \"Can we as a nation continue together  _permanently--for ever_--half slave, and half free?\" The problem is too  mighty for me. May God in his mercy superintend the solution.         Your much obliged friend, and humble servant,         A. LINCOLN.          _Extracts from Letter to Joshua F. Speed. August 24, 1855_      You suggest that in political action now, you and I would differ. I  suppose we would; not quite so much, however, as you may think. You know  I dislike slavery, and you fully admit the abstract wrong of it. So far  there is no cause of difference.

There is much in the  city to delight the antiquary and the artist--the famous rows, the  three-gabled old timber mansion of the Stanleys with its massive  staircase, oaken floors, and panelled walls, built in 1591, Bishop  Lloyd's house in Water-gate with its timber front sculptured with  Scripture subjects, and God's Providence House with its motto \"God's  Providence is mine inheritance,\" the inhabitants of which are said to  have escaped one of the terrible plagues that used to rage frequently  in old Chester.    [Illustration: Detail of Half-timbered House in High Street,  Shrewsbury]    Journeying southwards we come to Shrewsbury, another walled town,  abounding with delightful half-timbered houses, less spoiled than any  town we know. It was never a Roman town, though six miles away, at  Uriconium, the Romans had a flourishing city with a great basilica,  baths, shops, and villas, and the usual accessories of luxury.  Tradition says that its earliest Celtic name was Pengwern, where a  British prince had his palace; but the town Scrobbesbyrig came into  existence under Offa's rule in Mercia, and with the Normans came Roger  de Montgomery, Shrewsbury's first Earl, and a castle and the stately  abbey of SS. Peter and Paul. A little later the town took to itself  walls, which were abundantly necessary on account of the constant  inroads of the wild Welsh.            For the barbican's massy and high,                    Bloudie Jacke!          And the oak-door is heavy and brown;          And with iron it's plated and machicolated,          To pour boiling oil and lead down;                    How you'd frown          Should a ladle-full fall on your crown!            The rock that it stands on is steep,                    Bloudie Jacke!          To gain it one's forced for to creep;          The Portcullis is strong, and the Drawbridge is long,          And the water runs all round the Keep;                    At a peep          You can see that the moat's very deep!    So rhymed the author of the _Ingoldsby Legends_, when in his \"Legend  of Shropshire\" he described the red stone fortress that towers over  the loop of the Severn enclosing the picturesque old town of  Shrewsbury. The castle, or rather its keep, for the outworks have  disappeared, has been modernized past antiquarian value now. Memories  of its importance as the key of the Northern Marches, and of the  ancient custom of girding the knights of the shire with their swords  by the sheriffs on the grass plot of its inner court, still remain.  The town now stands on a peninsula girt by the Severn. On the high  ground between the narrow neck stood the castle, and under its shelter  most of the houses of the inhabitants. Around this was erected the  first wall. The latest historian of Shrewsbury[8] tells us that it  started from the gate of the castle, passed along the ridge at the  back of Pride Hill, at the bottom of which it turned along the line of  High Street, past St. Julian's Church which overhung it, to the top  of Wyle Cop, when it followed the ridge back to the castle. Of the  part extending from Pride Hill to Wyle Cop only scant traces exist at  the back of more modern buildings.      [8] The Rev. T. Auden, _Shrewsbury_ (Methuen and Co.).    The town continued to grow and more extensive defences were needed,  and in the time of Henry III, Mr. Auden states that this followed the  old line at the back of Pride Hill, but as the ground began to slope  downwards, another wall branched from it in the direction of Roushill  and extended to the Welsh Bridge. This became the main defence,  leaving the old wall as an inner rampart. From the Welsh Bridge the  new wall turned up Claremont Bank to where St. Chad's Church now  stands, and where one of the original towers stood. Then it passed  along Murivance, where the only existing tower is to be seen, and so  along the still remaining portion of the wall to English Bridge, where  it turned up the hill at the back of what is now Dogpole, and passing  the Watergate, again joined the fortifications of the castle.[9] The  castle itself was reconstructed by Prince Edward, the son of Henry  III, at the end of the thirteenth century, and is of the Edwardian  type of concentric castle. The Norman keep was incorporated within a  larger circle of tower and wall, forming an inner bailey; besides this  there was formerly an outer bailey, in which were various buildings,  including the chapel of St. Nicholas. Only part of the buildings on  one side of the inner bailey remains in its original form, but the  massive character of the whole may be judged from the fragments now  visible.      [9] _Ibid._, p. 48.    These walls guarded a noble town full of churches and monasteries,  merchants' houses, guild halls, and much else. We will glance at the  beauties that remain: St. Mary's, containing specimens of every style  of architecture from Norman downward, with its curious foreign glass;  St. Julian's, mainly rebuilt in 1748, though the old tower remains;  St. Alkmund's; the Church of St. Chad; St. Giles's Church; and the  nave and refectory pulpit of the monastery of SS. Peter and Paul. It  is distressing to see this interesting gem of fourteenth-century  architecture amid the incongruous surroundings of a coalyard. You can  find considerable remains of the domestic buildings of the Grey  Friars' Monastery near the footbridge across the Severn, and also of  the home of the Austin Friars in a builder's yard at the end of Baker  Street.    [Illustration: Tower on the Town Wall, Shrewsbury]    In many towns we find here and there an old half-timbered dwelling,  but in Shrewsbury there is a surprising wealth of them--streets full  of them, bearing such strange medieval names as \"Mardel\" or \"Wyle  Cop.\" Shrewsbury is second to no other town in England in the interest  of its ancient domestic buildings. There is the gatehouse of the old  Council House, bearing the date 1620, with its high gable and carved  barge-boards, its panelled front, the square spaces between the  upright and horizontal timbers being ornamented with cut timber. The  old buildings of the famous Shrewsbury School are now used as a Free  Library and Museum and abound in interest. The house remains in which  Prince Rupert stayed during his sojourn in 1644, then owned by \"Master  Jones the lawyer,\" at the west end of St. Mary's Church, with its fine  old staircase. Whitehall, a fine mansion of red sandstone, was built  by Richard Prince, a lawyer, in 1578-82, \"to his great chardge with  fame to hym and hys posterite for ever.\" The Old Market Hall in the  Renaissance style, with its mixture of debased Gothic and classic  details, is worthy of study. Even in Shrewsbury we have to record the  work of the demon of destruction. The erection of the New Market Hall  entailed the disappearance of several old picturesque houses.  Bellstone House, erected in 1582, is incorporated in the National  Provincial Bank. The old mansion known as Vaughan's Place is swallowed  up by the music-hall, though part of the ancient dwelling-place  remains. St. Peter's Abbey Church in the commencement of the  nineteenth century had an extraordinary annexe of timber and plaster,  probably used at one time as parsonage house, which, with several  buttressed remains of the adjacent conventual buildings, have long ago  been squared up and \"improved\" out of existence. Rowley's mansion, in  Hill's Lane, built of brick in 1618 by William Rowley, is now a  warehouse. Butcher Row has some old houses with projecting storeys,  including a fine specimen of a medieval shop. Some of the houses in  Grope Lane lean together from opposite sides of the road, so that  people in the highest storey can almost shake hands with their  neighbours across the way. You can see the \"Olde House\" in which Mary  Tudor is said to have stayed, and the mansion of the Owens, built in  1592 as an inscription tells us, and that of the Irelands, with its  range of bow-windows, four storeys high, and terminating in gables,  erected about 1579. The half-timbered hall of the Drapers' Guild, some  old houses in Frankwell, including the inn with the quaint sign--the  String of Horses, the ancient hostels--the Lion, famous in the  coaching age, the Ship, and the Raven--Bennett's Hall, which was the  mint when Shrewsbury played its part in the Civil War, and last, but  not least, the house in Wyle Cop, one of the finest in the town, where  Henry Earl of Richmond stayed on his way to Bosworth field to win the  English Crown. Such are some of the beauties of old Shrewsbury which  happily have not yet vanished.    [Illustration: House that the Earl of Richmond stayed in before the  Battle of Bosworth, Shrewsbury]    Not far removed from Shrewsbury is Coventry, which at one time could  boast of a city wall and a castle. In the reign of Richard II this  wall was built, strengthened by towers. Leland, writing in the time of  Henry VIII, states that the city was begun to be walled in when Edward  II reigned, and that it had six gates, many fair towers, and streets  well built with timber. Other writers speak of thirty-two towers and  twelve gates. But few traces of these remain. The citizens of Coventry  took an active part in the Civil War in favour of the Parliamentary  army, and when Charles II came to the throne he ordered these defences  to be demolished. The gates were left, but most of them have since  been destroyed. Coventry is a city of fine old timber-framed  fifteenth-century houses with gables and carved barge-boards and  projecting storeys, though many of them are decayed and may not last  many years. The city has had a fortunate immunity from serious fires.  We give an illustration of one of the old Coventry streets called Spon  Street, with its picturesque houses. These old streets are numerous,  tortuous and"]]]
