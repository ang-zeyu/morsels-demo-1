Here comes a man with a lamb to offer. He approaches solemnly,  reverently, towards the altar of God. But as he is coming there flashes  across his mind the face of _that man_, with whom he has had difficulty.  And instantly he can feel his grip tightening on the offering, and his  teeth shutting closer at the quick memory. Jesus says, \"If that be so lay  your lamb right down.\" What! go abruptly away! Why! how the folks around  the temple will talk! \"Lay the lamb right down, and go thy way.\" The  shortest way to God for that man is not the way to the altar, but around  by that man's house. \"_First_, be reconciled\"--keep your perspective  straight--follow the right order--\"_first_ be reconciled\"--not _second;  \"then_ come and offer thy gift.\"    In the sixth chapter[17] He gives the form of prayer which we commonly  call the Lord's prayer. It contains seven petitions. At the close He  stops to emphasize just one of the seven. You remember which one; the one  about forgiveness. In the eighteenth chapter[18] Jesus is talking alone  with the disciples about prayer. Peter seems to remember the previous  remarks about forgiveness in connection with prayer; and he asks a  question. It is never difficult to think of Peter asking a question or  making a few remarks. He says, \"Master, how many times _must_ I forgive a  man? _Seven_ times!\" Apparently Peter thinks he is growing in grace. He  can actually _think_ now of forgiving a man seven times in succession. But  the Master in effect says, \"Peter, you haven't caught the idea.  Forgiveness is not a question of mathematics; not a matter of _keeping  tab_ on somebody: not seven times but _seventy times seven._\" And Peter's  eyes bulge open with an incredulous stare--\"four hundred and ninety  times!... one man--straightway!!\" Apparently the Master is thinking, that  he will lose count, or get tired of counting and conclude that forgiveness  is preferable, or else by practice _breathe in the spirit of  forgiveness--the_ thing He meant.    Then as He was so fond of doing Jesus told a story to illustrate His  meaning. A man owed his lord a great debt, twelve millions of dollars;  that is to say practically an _unpayable_ amount. By comparison with money  to-day, in the western world, it would be about twelve billions. And he  went to him and asked for time. He said: \"I'm short just now; but I mean  to pay; I don't mean to shirk: be easy with me; and I'll pay up the whole  sum in time.\" And his lord generously forgave him the whole debt. That is  Jesus' picture of God, as He knows Him who knows Him best. Then this  forgiven man went out and found a fellow servant who owed him--how much do  you think? Have you ever thought that Jesus had a keen sense of the  ludicrous? Surely it shows here. He owed him about sixteen dollars and  a-quarter or a-half! And you can almost feel the clutch of this fellow's  fingers on the other's throat as he sternly demands:--\"Pay me that thou  owest.\" And his fellow earnestly replies, \"Please be easy with me; I mean  to pay; I'm rather short just now: but I'm not trying to shirk; be easy  with me.\" Is it possible the words do not sound familiar! But he would  not, but put him in the jail. The last place to pay a debt! That is Jesus'  picture of man as He knows him who knows him best. And in effect He says  what we have been forgiven by God is as an unpayable amount. And what are  not willing to forgive is like sixteen dollars and a fraction by contrast.  What little puny folks some of us are in our thinking and feeling!    \"Oh, well,\" some one says, \"you do not know how hard it is to forgive.\"  You think not? I know this much:--that some persons, and some things you  _can_not forgive of yourself. But I am glad to say that I know this too  that if one allows the Spirit of Jesus to sway the heart He will make you  love persons you _can_not like. No natural affinity or drawing together  through disposition, but a real yearning love in the heart. Jesus' love,  when allowed to come in as freely as He means, fills your heart with pity  for the man who has wounded you. An infinite, tender pity that he has sunk  so low as to be capable of such actions.    But the fact to put down in the sharpest contrast of white and black is  that we must forgive freely, frankly, generously, \"_even as God_,\" if we  are to be in prayer touch with God.    And the reason is not far to find; a double reason, Godward and Satanward.  If prayer be partnership in the highest sense then the same spirit must  animate both partners, the human and the divine, if the largest results  are to come. And since unforgiveness roots itself down in hate Satan has  room for both feet in such a heart with all the leeway in action of such  purchase. That word _unforgiving_! What a group of relatives it has, near  and far! Jealousy, envy, bitterness, the cutting word, the polished shaft  of sarcasm with the poisoned tip, the green eye, the acid saliva--what  kinsfolk these!        <u>Search Me.</u>      Sin, selfishness, an unforgiving spirit--what searchlights these words  are! Many a splendid life to-day is an utter cipher in the spirit  atmosphere because of some such hindrance. And God's great love-plan for  His prodigal world is being held back; and lives being lost even where  ultimately souls shall be saved because of the lack of human prayer  partners.    May we not well pray:--Search me, oh God, and know my heart and help me  know it; try me and know my innermost, undermost thoughts and purposes and  ambitions, and help me know them; and see what way there be in me that is  a grief to Thee; and then lead me--and here the prayer may be a purpose as  well as a prayer--lead me out of that way unto _Thy_ way, _the_ way  everlasting. For Jesus' sake; aye for men's sake, too.          Why the Results are Delayed        <u>God's Pathway to Human Hearts.</u>      God touches men through men. The Spirit's path to a human heart is through  another human heart. With reverence be it said, yet with blunt plainness  that in His plan for winning men to their true allegiance God is limited  by the human limitations. That may seem to mean more than it really does.  For our thought of the human is of the scarred, warped, shrivelled  humanity that we know, and great changes come when God's Spirit controls.  But the fact is there, however limited our understanding of it.    God needs man for His plan. That is the fact that stands out strong in  thinking about prayer. God's greatest agency; man's greatest agency, for  defeating the enemy and winning men back is intercession. God is counting  mightily upon that. And He can count most mightily upon the man that  faithfully practices that.    The results He longs for are being held back, and made smaller because so  many of us have not learned how to pray simply and skilfully. We need  training. And God understands that. He Himself will train. But we must be  willing; actively willing. And just there the great bother comes in. A  strong will perfectly yielded to God's will, or perfectly willing to be  yielded, is His mightiest ally in redeeming the world.    Answers to prayer are delayed, or denied, out of kindness, _or_, that more  may be given, _or_, that a far larger purpose may be served. But deeper  down by far than that is this: _God's purposes are being delayed_; delayed  because of our unwillingness to learn how to pray, _or_, our slowness--I  almost said--our stupidity in learning. It is a small matter that my  prayer be answered, or unanswered; not small to me; everything perhaps to  me; but small in proportion. It is a tremendous thing that _God's purpose_  for a world is being held back through my lack. The thought that prayer is  _getting things_ from God; chiefly that, is so small, pitiably small, and  yet so common. The true conception understands that prayer is partnership  with God in His planet-sized purposes, and includes the \"all things\"  beside, as an important detail of the whole.    The real reason for the delay or failure lies simply in the difference  between God's view-point and ours. In our asking either we have not  reached the _wisdom_ that asks best, _or_, we have not reached the  _unselfishness_ that is willing to sacrifice a good thing, for a better,  or the best; the unselfishness that is willing to sacrifice the smaller  personal desire for the larger thing that affects the lives of many.    We learn best by pictures, and by stories which are pen or word pictures.  This was Jesus' favourite method of teaching. There are in the Bible four  great, striking instances of delayed, or qualified answers to prayer.  There are some others; but these stand out sharply, and perhaps include  the main teachings of all. Probably all the instances of hindered prayer  with which we are familiar will come under one of these. That is to say,  where there are good connections upward as suggested in our last talk,  _and_, excepting those that come under the talk succeeding this, namely,  the great outside hindrance. These four are Moses' request to enter  Canaan; Hannah's prayer for a son; Paul's thorn; and Jesus' prayer in  Gethsemane.    Let us look a bit at these in turn.        <u>For the Sake of a Nation.</u>      First is the incident of Moses' ungranted petition. Moses was the leader  of his people. He is one of the giants of the human race from whatever  standpoint considered. His codes are the basis of all English and American  jurisprudence. From his own account of his career, the secret of all his  power as a maker of laws, the organizer of a strangely marvellous nation,  a military general and strategist--the secret of all was in his direct  communication with God. He was peculiarly a man of prayer. Everything was  referred to God, and he declared that everything--laws, organization,  worship,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13202"],[0,"\"Co. Aytch,\" Maury Grays, First Tennessee Regiment (#10)"],[1," the black cloud of battle and war had begun then to  appear much larger than a man's hand, in fact we could see the lightning  flash and hear the thunder roar.    We were at Harrodsburg; the Yankees were approaching Perryville under  General Buell.  The Yankees had been dogging our rear, picking up our  stragglers and capturing some of our wagon trains.    This good time that we were having was too good to last.  We were in an  ecstasy akin to heaven.  We were happy; the troops were jubilant; our  manhood blood pulsated more warmly; our patriotism was awakened; our  pride was renewed and stood ready for any emergency; we felt that one  Southern man could whip twenty Yankees.  All was lovely and the goose  hung high.  We went to dances and parties every night.    When General Chalmers marched to Perryville, in flanking and surrounding  Mumfordsville, we marched the whole night long.  We, the private soldiers,  did not know what was going on among the generals.  All that we had to do  was march, march, march.  It mattered not how tired, hungry, or thirsty  we were.  All that we had to do was to march that whole night long,  and every staff officer who would pass, some fellow would say, \"Hey,  mister, how far is it to Mumfordsville?\"  He would answer, \"five miles.\"  It seemed to me we traveled a hundred miles and were always within five  miles of Mumfordsville.  That night we heard a volley of musketry in our  immediate front, and did not know what it meant, but soon we came to  where a few soldiers had lighted some candles and were holding them  over the body of a dead soldier.  It was Captain Allison, if I remember  rightly, of General Cheatham's staff.  He was very bloody, and had his  clothes riddled with balls.  I heard that he rode on in front of the  advance guard of our army, and had no doubt discovered the Yankee picket,  and came galloping back at full speed in the dark, when our advance guard  fired on and killed him.    We laid down in a graveyard that night and slept, and when we awoke the  sun was high in the heavens, shining in our faces.  Mumfordsville had  surrendered.  The next day Dr. C. T. Quintard let me ride his horse  nearly all day, while he walked with the webfeet.      THE BATTLE OF PERRYVILLE    In giving a description of this most memorable battle, I do not pretend  to give you figures, and describe how this general looked and how that  one spoke, and the other one charged with drawn sabre, etc.  I know  nothing of these things--see the history for that.  I was simply a  soldier of the line, and I only write of the things I saw.  I was in  every battle, skirmish and march that was made by the First Tennessee  Regiment during the war, and I do not remember of a harder contest and  more evenly fought battle than that of Perryville.  If it had been two  men wrestling, it would have been called a \"dog fall.\"  Both sides claim  the victory--both whipped.    I stood picket in Perryville the night before the battle--a Yankee on  one side of the street, and I on the other.  We got very friendly during  the night, and made a raid upon a citizen's pantry, where we captured  a bucket of honey, a pitcher of sweet milk, and three or four biscuit.  The old citizen was not at home--he and his whole household had gone  visiting, I believe.  In fact, I think all of the citizens of Perryville  were taken with a sudden notion of promiscuous visiting about this time;  at least they were not at home to all callers.    At length the morning dawned.  Our line was drawn up on one side of  Perryville, the Yankee army on the other.  The two enemies that were soon  to meet in deadly embrace seemed to be eyeing each other.  The blue coats  lined the hillside in plain view.  You could count the number of their  regiments by the number of their flags.  We could see the huge war dogs  frowning at us, ready at any moment to belch forth their fire and smoke,  and hurl their thunderbolts of iron and death in our very midst.    I wondered why the fighting did not begin.  Never on earth were our  troops more eager for the engagement to open.  The Yankees commenced to  march toward their left, and we marched almost parallel to our right--  both sides watching each other's maneuvers and movements.  It was but the  lull that precedes the storm.  Colonel Field was commanding our brigade,  and Lieutenant-Colonel Patterson our regiment.  About 12 o'clock, while  we were marching through a corn field, in which the corn had been shocked,  they opened their war dogs upon us.  The beginning of the end had come.  Here is where Captain John F. Wheless was wounded, and three others,  whose names I have forgotten.  The battle now opened in earnest, and from  one end of the line to the other seemed to be a solid sheet of blazing  smoke and fire.  Our regiment crossed a stream, being preceded by  Wharton's Texas Rangers, and we were ordered to attack at once with  vigor.  Here General Maney's horse was shot.  From this moment the battle  was a mortal struggle.  Two lines of battle confronted us.  We killed  almost every one in the first line, and were soon charging over the  second, when right in our immediate front was their third and main line  of battle from which four Napoleon guns poured their deadly fire.    We did not recoil, but our line was fairly hurled back by the leaden hail  that was poured into our very faces.  Eight color-bearers were killed at  one discharge of their cannon.  We were right up among the very wheels  of their Napoleon guns.  It was death to retreat now to either side.  Our Lieutenant-Colonel Patterson halloed to charge and take their guns,  and we were soon in a hand-to-hand fight--every man for himself--using  the butts of our guns and bayonets.  One side would waver and fall back a  few yards, and would rally, when the other side would fall back, leaving  the four Napoleon guns; and yet the battle raged.  Such obstinate  fighting I never had seen before or since.  The guns were discharged  so rapidly that it seemed the earth itself was in a volcanic uproar.  The iron storm passed through our ranks, mangling and tearing men to  pieces.  The very air seemed full of stifling smoke and fire which seemed  the very pit of hell, peopled by contending demons.    Our men were dead and dying right in the very midst of this grand havoc  of battle.  It was a life to life and death to death grapple.  The sun  was poised above us, a great red ball sinking slowly in the west, yet the  scene of battle and carnage continued.  I cannot describe it.  The mantle  of night fell upon the scene.  I do not know which side whipped, but I  know that I helped bring off those four Napoleon guns that night though  we were mighty easy about it.    They were given to Turner's Battery of our brigade and had the name of  our Lieutenant-Colonel Patterson and our color-bearer, Mitchell, both of  whom were killed, inscribed on two of the pieces.  I have forgotten the  names inscribed on the other two pieces.  I saw these very four guns  surrendered at Missionary Ridge.  But of this another time.    The battle of Perryville presented a strange scene.  The dead, dying,  and wounded of both armies, Confederate and Federal, were blended in  inextricable confusion.  Now and then a cluster of dead Yankees and close  by a cluster of dead Rebels.  It was like the Englishman's grog--'alf and  'alf.  Now, if you wish, kind reader, to find out how many were killed  and wounded, I refer you to the histories.    I remember one little incident that I laughed at while in the very midst  of battle.  We were charging through an old citizen's yard, when a big  yellow cur dog ran out and commenced snapping at the soldiers' legs--  they kicking at him to keep him off.  The next morning he was lying near  the same place, but he was a dead dog.    I helped bring off our wounded that night.  We worked the whole night.  The next morning about daylight a wounded comrade, Sam Campbell,  complained of being cold, and asked me to lie down beside him.  I did so,  and was soon asleep; when I awoke the poor fellow was stiff and cold in  death.  His spirit had flown to its home beyond the skies.    After the battle was over, John T. Tucker, Scott Stephens, A. S. Horsley  and I were detailed to bring off our wounded that night, and we helped  to bring off many a poor dying comrade--Joe Thompson, Billy Bond, Byron  Richardson, the two Allen boys--brothers, killed side by side--and  Colonel Patterson, who was killed standing right by my side.  He was  first shot through the hand, and was wrapping his handkerchief around it,  when another ball struck and killed him.  I saw W. J. Whittorne, then a  strippling boy of fifteen years of age, fall, shot through the neck and  collar-bone.  He fell apparently dead, when I saw him all at once jump up,  grab his gun and commence loading and firing, and I heard him say,  \"D--n 'em, I'll fight 'em as long as I live.\"  Whit thought he was killed,  but he is living yet.  We helped bring off a man by the name of Hodge,  with his under jaw shot off, and his tongue lolling out.  We brought off  Captain Lute B. Irvine.  Lute was shot through the lungs and was vomiting  blood all the while, and begging us to lay him down and let him die.  But Lute is living yet.  Also, Lieutenant Woldridge, with both eyes shot  out.  I found him rambling in a briar-patch.  About fifty members of the  Rock City Guards were killed and nearly one hundred wounded.  They were  led by Captains W. D. Kelley, Wheless, and Steele.  Lieutenant Thomas  H. Maney was badly wounded.  I saw dead on the battlefield a Federal  General by the name of Jackson.  It was his brigade that fought us so  obstinately at this place, and I did hear that they were made up in  Kentucky.  Colonel Field, then commanding our brigade, and on his fine  gray mare, rode up almost face to face with General Jackson, before  he was killed, and Colonel Field was shooting all the time with his"]]]
