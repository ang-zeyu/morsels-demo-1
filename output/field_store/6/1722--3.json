And  further, finding that nature's colours (the rays of coloured light) when  mixed produced different results than their corresponding pigments mixed  together, they determined to use their paints as pure as possible,  placing them one against the other to be mixed as they came to the eye,  the mixture being one of pure colour rays, not pigments, by this means.    But we are here only concerned with the movement as it affected form,  and must avoid the fascinating province of colour.    Those who had been brought up in the old school of outline form said  there was no drawing in these impressionist pictures, and from the point  of view of the mental idea of form discussed in the last chapter, there  was indeed little, although, had the impression been realised to a  sufficiently definite focus, the sense of touch and solidity would  probably have been satisfied. But the particular field of this new  point of view, the beauty of tone and colour relations considered as an  impression apart from objectivity, did not tempt them to carry their  work so far as this, or the insistence on these particular qualities  would have been lost.    But interesting and alluring as is the new world of visual music opened  up by this point of view, it is beginning to be realised that it has  failed somehow to satisfy. In the first place, the implied assumption  that one sees with the eye alone is wrong:         \"In every object there is inexhaustible meaning; the eye sees in it       what the eye brings means of seeing,\"[2]    [Footnote 2: Goethe, quoted in Carlyle's _French Revolution_, chap. i.]    and it is the mind behind the eye that supplies this means of  perception: #one sees with the mind#. The ultimate effect of any  picture, be it impressionist, post, anti, or otherwise--is its power to  stimulate these mental perceptions within the mind.    But even from the point of view of the _true_ visual perception (if  there is such a thing) that modern art has heard so much talk of, the  copying of the retina picture is not so great a success. The impression  carried away from a scene that has moved us is not its complete visual  aspect. Only those things that are significant to the felt impression  have been retained by the mind; and if the picture is to be a true  representation of this, the significant facts must be sorted out from  the mass of irrelevant matter and presented in a lively manner. The  impressionist's habit of painting before nature entirely is not  calculated to do this. Going time after time to the same place, even if  similar weather conditions are waited for, although well enough for  studies, is against the production of a fine picture. Every time the  artist goes to the selected spot he receives a different impression, so  that he must either paint all over his picture each time, in which case  his work must be confined to a small scale and will be hurried in  execution, or he must paint a bit of today's impression alongside of  yesterday's, in which case his work will be dull and lacking in oneness  of conception.    And further, in decomposing the colour rays that come to the eye and  painting in pure colour, while great addition was made to the power of  expressing light, yet by destroying the definitions and enveloping  everything in a scintillating atmosphere, the power to design in a large  manner was lost with the wealth of significance that the music of line  can convey.    But impressionism has opened up a view from which much interesting  matter for art is to be gleaned. And everywhere painters are selecting  from this, and grafting it on to some of the more traditional schools of  design.    Our concern here is with the influence this point of view has had upon  draughtsmanship. The influence has been considerable, particularly with  those draughtsmen whose work deals with the rendering of modern life. It  consists in drawing from the observation of the silhouette occupied by  objects in the field of vision, observing the flat appearance of things  as they are on the retina. This is, of course, the only accurate way in  which to observe visual shapes. The difference between this and the  older point of view is its insistence on the observation of the flat  visual impression to the exclusion of the tactile or touch sense that by  the association of ideas we have come to expect in things seen. An  increased truth to the character of appearances has been the result,  with a corresponding loss of plastic form expression.    On pages 66 and 67 a reproduction of a drawing in the British Museum,  attributed to Michael Angelo, is contrasted with one in the Louvre by  Degas. The one is drawn from the line point of view and the other from  the mass. They both contain lines, but in the one case the lines are the  contours of felt forms and in the other the boundaries of visual masses.  In the Michael Angelo the silhouette is only the result of the  overlapping of rich forms considered in the round. Every muscle and bone  has been mentally realised as a concrete thing and the drawing made as  an expression of this idea. Note the line rhythm also; the sense of  energy and movement conveyed by the swinging curves; and compare with  what is said later (page 162 [Transcribers Note: Sidenote \"Curved  Lines\"]) about the rhythmic significance of swinging curves.    Then compare it with the Degas and observe the totally different  attitude of mind in which this drawing has been approached. Instead of  the outlines being the result of forms felt as concrete things, the  silhouette is everywhere considered first, the plastic sense (nowhere so  great as in the other) being arrived at from the accurate consideration  of the mass shapes.    Notice also the increased attention to individual character in the  Degas, observe the pathos of those underfed little arms, and the hand  holding the tired ankle--how individual it all is. What a different tale  this little figure tells from that given before the footlights! See with  what sympathy the contours have been searched for those accents  expressive of all this.    [Illustration: Plate XII.    STUDY ATTRIBUTED TO MICHAEL ANGELO (BRITISH MUSEUM)    Note the desire to express form as a felt solid thing, the contours  resulting from the overlapping forms. The visual appearance is arrived  at as a result of giving expression to the mental idea of a solid  object.]      [Illustration: Plate XIII.    STUDY BY DEGAS (LUXEMBOURG)    In contrast with Michael Angelo's drawing, note the preoccupation with  the silhouette the spaces occupied by the different masses in the field  of vision; how the appearance solid forms is the result of accurately  portraying this visual appearance.    _Photo Levi_]    How remote from individual character is the Michael Angelo in contrast  with this! Instead of an individual he gives us the expression of a  glowing mental conception of man as a type of physical strength and  power.    The rhythm is different also, in the one case being a line rhythm, and  in the other a consideration of the flat pattern of shapes or masses  with a play of lost-and-foundness on the edges (see later, pages 192  [Transcribers Note: Sidenote \"Variety of Edges.\"] _et seq._, variety of  edges). It is this feeling for rhythm and the sympathetic searching for  and emphasis of those points expressive of character, that keep this  drawing from being the mechanical performance which so much concern with  scientific visual accuracy might well have made it, and which has made  mechanical many of the drawings of Degas's followers who unintelligently  copy his method.          VI    THE ACADEMIC AND CONVENTIONAL      The terms Academic and Conventional are much used in criticism and  greatly feared by the criticised, often without either party appearing  to have much idea of what is meant. New so-called schools of painting  seem to arrive annually with the spring fashions, and sooner or later  the one of last year gets called out of date, if not conventional and  academic. And as students, for fear of having their work called by one  or other of these dread terms, are inclined to rush into any new  extravagance that comes along, some inquiry as to their meaning will not  be out of place before we pass into the chapters dealing with academic  study.    It has been the cry for some time that Schools of Art turned out only  academic students. And one certainly associates a dead level of  respectable mediocrity with much school work. We can call to mind a lot  of dull, lifeless, highly-finished work, imperfectly perfect, that has  won the prize in many a school competition. Flaubert says \"a form  deadens,\" and it does seem as if the necessary formality of a school  course had some deadening influence on students; and that there was some  important part of the artist's development which it has failed to  recognise and encourage.    The freer system of the French schools has been in many cases more  successful. But each school was presided over by an artist of  distinction, and this put the students in touch with real work and thus  introduced vitality. In England, until quite lately, artists were seldom  employed in teaching, which was left to men set aside for the purpose,  without any time to carry on original work of their own. The Royal  Academy Schools are an exception to this. There the students have the  advantage of teaching from some distinguished member or associate who  has charge of the upper school for a month at a time. But as the visitor  is constantly changed, the less experienced students are puzzled by the  different methods advocated, and flounder hopelessly for want of a  definite system to work on; although for a student already in possession  of a good grounding there is much to be said for the system, as contact  with the different masters widens their outlook."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1429"],[0,"The Garden Party, and Other Stories (#10)"],[1,"    \"There's been a horrible accident,\" said Cook. \"A man killed.\"    \"A man killed! Where? How? When?\"    But Godber's man wasn't going to have his story snatched from under his  very nose.    \"Know those little cottages just below here, miss?\" Know them? Of  course, she knew them. \"Well, there's a young chap living there, name of  Scott, a carter. His horse shied at a traction-engine, corner of Hawke  Street this morning, and he was thrown out on the back of his head.  Killed.\"    \"Dead!\" Laura stared at Godber's man.    \"Dead when they picked him up,\" said Godber's man with relish. \"They  were taking the body home as I come up here.\" And he said to the cook,  \"He's left a wife and five little ones.\"    \"Jose, come here.\" Laura caught hold of her sister's sleeve and dragged  her through the kitchen to the other side of the green baize door. There  she paused and leaned against it. \"Jose!\" she said, horrified, \"however  are we going to stop everything?\"    \"Stop everything, Laura!\" cried Jose in astonishment. \"What do you  mean?\"    \"Stop the garden-party, of course.\" Why did Jose pretend?    But Jose was still more amazed. \"Stop the garden-party? My dear Laura,  don't be so absurd. Of course we can't do anything of the kind. Nobody  expects us to. Don't be so extravagant.\"    \"But we can't possibly have a garden-party with a man dead just outside  the front gate.\"    That really was extravagant, for the little cottages were in a lane to  themselves at the very bottom of a steep rise that led up to the house.  A broad road ran between. True, they were far too near. They were  the greatest possible eyesore, and they had no right to be in that  neighbourhood at all. They were little mean dwellings painted a  chocolate brown. In the garden patches there was nothing but cabbage  stalks, sick hens and tomato cans. The very smoke coming out of their  chimneys was poverty-stricken. Little rags and shreds of smoke, so  unlike the great silvery plumes that uncurled from the Sheridans'  chimneys. Washerwomen lived in the lane and sweeps and a cobbler, and  a man whose house-front was studded all over with minute bird-cages.  Children swarmed. When the Sheridans were little they were forbidden to  set foot there because of the revolting language and of what they might  catch. But since they were grown up, Laura and Laurie on their prowls  sometimes walked through. It was disgusting and sordid. They came  out with a shudder. But still one must go everywhere; one must see  everything. So through they went.    \"And just think of what the band would sound like to that poor woman,\"  said Laura.    \"Oh, Laura!\" Jose began to be seriously annoyed. \"If you're going to  stop a band playing every time some one has an accident, you'll lead a  very strenuous life. I'm every bit as sorry about it as you. I feel just  as sympathetic.\" Her eyes hardened. She looked at her sister just as she  used to when they were little and fighting together. \"You won't bring a  drunken workman back to life by being sentimental,\" she said softly.    \"Drunk! Who said he was drunk?\" Laura turned furiously on Jose. She  said, just as they had used to say on those occasions, \"I'm going  straight up to tell mother.\"    \"Do, dear,\" cooed Jose.    \"Mother, can I come into your room?\" Laura turned the big glass  door-knob.    \"Of course, child. Why, what's the matter? What's given you such a  colour?\" And Mrs. Sheridan turned round from her dressing-table. She was  trying on a new hat.    \"Mother, a man's been killed,\" began Laura.    \"Not in the garden?\" interrupted her mother.    \"No, no!\"    \"Oh, what a fright you gave me!\" Mrs. Sheridan sighed with relief, and  took off the big hat and held it on her knees.    \"But listen, mother,\" said Laura. Breathless, half-choking, she told  the dreadful story. \"Of course, we can't have our party, can we?\" she  pleaded. \"The band and everybody arriving. They'd hear us, mother;  they're nearly neighbours!\"    To Laura's astonishment her mother behaved just like Jose; it was harder  to bear because she seemed amused. She refused to take Laura seriously.    \"But, my dear child, use your common sense. It's only by accident we've  heard of it. If some one had died there normally--and I can't understand  how they keep alive in those poky little holes--we should still be  having our party, shouldn't we?\"    Laura had to say \"yes\" to that, but she felt it was all wrong. She sat  down on her mother's sofa and pinched the cushion frill.    \"Mother, isn't it terribly heartless of us?\" she asked.    \"Darling!\" Mrs. Sheridan got up and came over to her, carrying the hat.  Before Laura could stop her she had popped it on. \"My child!\" said her  mother, \"the hat is yours. It's made for you. It's much too young for  me. I have never seen you look such a picture. Look at yourself!\" And  she held up her hand-mirror.    \"But, mother,\" Laura began again. She couldn't look at herself; she  turned aside.    This time Mrs. Sheridan lost patience just as Jose had done.    \"You are being very absurd, Laura,\" she said coldly. \"People like that  don't expect sacrifices from us. And it's not very sympathetic to spoil  everybody's enjoyment as you're doing now.\"    \"I don't understand,\" said Laura, and she walked quickly out of the room  into her own bedroom. There, quite by chance, the first thing she saw  was this charming girl in the mirror, in her black hat trimmed with  gold daisies, and a long black velvet ribbon. Never had she imagined she  could look like that. Is mother right? she thought. And now she  hoped her mother was right. Am I being extravagant? Perhaps it was  extravagant. Just for a moment she had another glimpse of that poor  woman and those little children, and the body being carried into  the house. But it all seemed blurred, unreal, like a picture in the  newspaper. I'll remember it again after the party's over, she decided.  And somehow that seemed quite the best plan...    Lunch was over by half-past one. By half-past two they were all ready  for the fray. The green-coated band had arrived and was established in a  corner of the tennis-court.    \"My dear!\" trilled Kitty Maitland, \"aren't they too like frogs for  words? You ought to have arranged them round the pond with the conductor  in the middle on a leaf.\"    Laurie arrived and hailed them on his way to dress. At the sight of him  Laura remembered the accident again. She wanted to tell him. If Laurie  agreed with the others, then it was bound to be all right. And she  followed him into the hall.    \"Laurie!\"    \"Hallo!\" He was half-way upstairs, but when he turned round and saw  Laura he suddenly puffed out his cheeks and goggled his eyes at her.  \"My word, Laura! You do look stunning,\" said Laurie. \"What an absolutely  topping hat!\"    Laura said faintly \"Is it?\" and smiled up at Laurie, and didn't tell him  after all.    Soon after that people began coming in streams. The band struck up; the  hired waiters ran from the house to the marquee. Wherever you looked  there were couples strolling, bending to the flowers, greeting, moving  on over the lawn. They were like bright birds that had alighted in the  Sheridans' garden for this one afternoon, on their way to--where? Ah,  what happiness it is to be with people who all are happy, to press  hands, press cheeks, smile into eyes.    \"Darling Laura, how well you look!\"    \"What a becoming hat, child!\"    \"Laura, you look quite Spanish. I've never seen you look so striking.\"    And Laura, glowing, answered softly, \"Have you had tea? Won't you have  an ice? The passion-fruit ices really are rather special.\" She ran to  her father and begged him. \"Daddy darling, can't the band have something  to drink?\"    And the perfect afternoon slowly ripened, slowly faded, slowly its  petals closed.    \"Never a more delightful garden-party... \" \"The greatest success... \"  \"Quite the most... \"    Laura helped her mother with the good-byes. They stood side by side in  the porch till it was all over.    \"All over, all over, thank heaven,\" said Mrs. Sheridan. \"Round up the  others, Laura. Let's go and have some fresh coffee. I'm exhausted. Yes,  it's been very successful. But oh, these parties, these parties! Why  will you children insist on giving parties!\" And they all of them sat  down in the deserted marquee.    \"Have a sandwich, daddy dear. I wrote the flag.\"    \"Thanks.\" Mr. Sheridan took a bite and the sandwich was gone. He took  another. \"I suppose you didn't hear of a beastly accident that happened  to-day?\" he said.    \"My dear,\" said Mrs. Sheridan, holding up her hand, \"we did. It nearly  ruined the party. Laura insisted we should put it off.\"    \"Oh, mother!\" Laura didn't want to be teased about it.    \"It was a horrible affair all the same,\" said Mr. Sheridan. \"The chap  was married too. Lived just below in the lane, and leaves a wife and  half a dozen kiddies, so they say.\"    An awkward little silence fell. Mrs. Sheridan fidgeted with her cup.  Really, it was very tactless of father...    Suddenly she looked up. There on the table were all those sandwiches,  cakes, puffs, all uneaten, all going to be wasted. She had one of her  brilliant ideas.    \"I know,\" she said. \"Let's make up a basket. Let's send that poor  creature some of this perfectly good food. At any rate, it will be the  greatest treat for the children. Don't you agree? And she's sure to  have neighbours calling in and so on. What a point to have it all ready  prepared. Laura!\" She jumped up. \"Get me the big basket out of the  stairs cupboard.\"    \"But, mother, do you really think it's a good idea?\" said Laura.    Again, how curious, she seemed to be different from them all. To take  scraps from their party. Would the poor woman really like that?    \"Of course! What's the matter with you to-day? An hour or two ago you  were insisting on us being sympathetic, and now--\"    Oh well! Laura ran for the basket. It was filled, it was heaped by her  mother.    \"Take"]]]
