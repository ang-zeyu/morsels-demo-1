TO HERR RIES.    I must again ask you to undertake the disagreeable task of making a fair  copy of the errors in the Zurich Sonata. I have got your list of _errata_  \"_auf der Wieden_.\"      33.

DEAR RIES,--    May I beg you to be so obliging as to copy this _andante_ [in the Kreuzer  Sonata] for me, however indifferently? I must send it off to-morrow, and as  Heaven alone knows what its fate may then be, I wish to get it transcribed.  But I must have it back to-morrow about one o'clock. The cause of my  troubling you is that one of my copyists is already very much occupied with  various things of importance, and the other is ill.      35.    TO THE COMPOSER LEIDESDORF,--VIENNA.[1]    DORF DES LEIDES [VILLAGE OF SORROW--LEIDESDORF],--    Let the bearer of this, Herr Ries, have some easy duets, and, better still,  let him have them for nothing. Conduct yourself in accordance with the  reformed doctrines. Farewell!    BEETHOVEN    _Minimus._    [Footnote 1: Date unknown. Leidesdorf was also a music-seller.]      36.    TO HERR RIES.    Baden, July 14, 1804.    DEAR RIES,--    If you can find me better lodgings, I shall be very glad. Tell my brothers  not to engage these at once; I have a great desire to get one in a  spacious, quiet square or on the Bastei. It it really inexcusable in my  brother not to have provided wine, as it is so beneficial and necessary to  me. I shall take care to be present at the rehearsal on Wednesday. I am not  pleased to hear that it is to be at Schuppanzigh's. He may well be grateful  to me if my impertinences make him thinner! Farewell, dear Ries! We have  bad weather here, and I am not safe from visitors; so I must take flight in  order to be alone.    Your true friend,    L. V. BEETHOVEN.      37.    TO HERR RIES.    Baden, July, 1804.    DEAR RIES,--    As Breuning [see Nos. 13, 14, and 18] by his conduct has not scrupled to  display my character to you and the house-steward as that of a mean, petty,  base man, I beg you will convey my reply at once in person to Breuning. I  answer only one point, the first in his letter, and I do so solely because  it is the only mode of justifying myself in your eyes. Say also to him that  I had no intention of reproaching him on account of the delay of the notice  to quit, and even if Breuning were really to blame for this, our harmonious  relations are so dear and precious in my sight, that, for the sake of a few  hundreds more or less, I would never subject any friend of mine to  vexation. You are aware, indeed, that I jestingly accused you as the cause  of the notice arriving too late. I am quite sure that you must remember  this. I had entirely forgotten the whole matter, but at dinner my brother  began to say that he thought Breuning was to blame in the affair, which I  at once denied, saying that you were in fault. I think this shows plainly  enough that I attributed no blame to Breuning; but on this he sprang up  like a madman, and insisted on sending for the house-steward. Such  behavior, in the presence of all those with whom I usually associate, and  to which I am wholly unaccustomed, caused me to lose all self-control; so I  also started up, upset my chair, left the room, and did not return. This  conduct induced Breuning to place me in a pretty light to you and the  house-steward, and also to send me a letter which I only answered by  silence. I have not another word to say to Breuning. His mode of thinking  and of acting, with regard to me, proves that there never ought to have  been such friendly intimacy between us, and assuredly it can never more be  restored. I wished to make you acquainted with this, as your version of the  occurrence degraded both my words and actions. I know that, had you been  aware of the real state of the affair, you would not have said what you  did, and with this I am satisfied.    I now beg of you, dear Ries, to go to my brother, the apothecary, as soon  as you receive this letter, and say to him that I mean to leave Baden in  the course of a few days, and that he is to engage the lodging in Doebling  as soon as you have given him this message. I had nearly left this to-day;  I detest being here--I am sick of it. For Heaven's sake urge him to close  the bargain at once, for I want to take possession immediately. Neither  show nor speak to any one of what is written in the previous page of this  letter. I wish to prove to him in every respect that I am not so meanly  disposed as he is. Indeed I have written to him, although my resolve as to  the dissolution of our friendship remains firm and unchangeable.    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.      38.    TO HERR RIES.    Berlin, July 24, 1804.    ... You were no doubt not a little surprised about the affair with  Breuning; believe me, my dear friend, that the ebullition on my part was  only an outbreak caused by many previous scenes of a disagreeable nature. I  have the gift of being able to conceal and to repress my susceptibility on  many occasions; but if attacked at a time when I chance to be peculiarly  irritable, I burst forth more violently than any one. Breuning certainly  possesses many admirable qualities, but he thinks himself quite faultless;  whereas the very defects that he discovers in others are those which he  possesses himself to the highest degree. From my childhood I have always  despised his petty mind. My powers of discrimination enabled me to foresee  the result with Breuning, for our modes of thinking, acting, and feeling  are entirely opposite; and yet I believed that these difficulties might be  overcome, but experience has disproved this. So now I want no more of his  friendship! I have only found two friends in the world with whom I never  had a misunderstanding; but what men these were! One is dead, the other  still lives. Although for nearly six years past we have seen nothing of  each other, yet I know that I still hold the first place in his heart, as  he does in mine [see No. 12]. The true basis of friendship is to be found  in sympathy of heart and soul. I only wish you could have read the letter I  wrote to Breuning, and his to me. No! never can he be restored to his  former place in my heart. The man who could attribute to his friend so base  a mode of thinking, and could himself have recourse to so base a mode of  acting towards him, is no longer worthy of my friendship.    Do not forget the affair of my apartments. Farewell! Do not be too much  addicted to tailoring,[1] remember me to the fairest of the fair, and send  me half a dozen needles.    I never could have believed that I could be so idle as I am here. If this  be followed by a fit of industry, something worth while may be produced.    _Vale!_ Your    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Ries says, in Wegeler's _Biographical Notices_:--\"Beethoven  never visited me more frequently than when I lived in the house of a  tailor, with three very handsome but thoroughly respectable daughters.\"]      39.    TO MESSRS. ARTARIA & CO.[1]    Vienna, June 1, 1805.    I must inform you that the affair about the new quintet is settled between  Count Fries and myself.    The Count has just assured me that he intends to make you a present of it;  it is too late to-day for a written agreement on the subject, but one shall  be sent early in the ensuing week. This intelligence must suffice for the  present, and I think I at all events deserve your thanks for it.    Your obedient servant,    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: The quintet is probably not that in C, Op. 29, dedicated to  Count v. Fries, previously published in 1803 by Breitkopf & Haertel [see No.  27]. It is more likely that he alludes to a new quintet which the Count had  no doubt ordered.]      40.    TO MADAME LA PRINCESSE LIECHTENSTEIN, &C.[1]    November, 1805.    Pray pardon me, illustrious Princess, if the bearer of this should cause  you an unpleasant surprise. Poor Ries, my scholar, is forced by this  unhappy war to shoulder a musket, and must moreover leave this in a few  days, being a foreigner. He has nothing, literally nothing, and is obliged  to take a long journey. All chance of a concert on his behalf is thus  entirely at an end, and he must have recourse to the benevolence of others.  I recommend him to you. I know you will forgive the step I have taken. A  noble-minded man would only have recourse to such measures in the most  utter extremity. Confident of this, I send the poor youth to you, in the  hope of somewhat improving his circumstances. He is forced to apply to all  who know him.    I am, with the deepest respect, yours,    L. VAN BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Communicated by Ries himself, who, to Beethoven's extreme  indignation, did not deliver the note. See Wegeler's work, p. 134. The  following remark is added:--\"Date unknown; written a few days before the  entrance of the French in 1805\" (which took place Nov. 13). Ries, a native  of Bonn, was now a French subject, and recalled under the laws of  conscription. The Sonata, Op. 27, No. 1, is dedicated to Princess  Liechtenstein.]      41.    TO HERR MEYER.[1]    1805.    DEAR MEYER,--    Pray try to persuade Herr v. Seyfried to direct my Opera, as I wish on this  occasion to see and hear it myself _from a distance_; in this way my  patience will at all events not be so severely tried as when I am close  enough to hear my music so bungled. I really do believe that it is done on  purpose to annoy me! I will say nothing of the wind-instruments; but all  _pp._'s, _cresc._, _discresc._, and all _f._'s and _ff._'s may as well be  struck out of my Opera, for no attention whatever is paid to them. I shall  lose all pleasure in composing anything in future, if I am to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13097"],[0,"Lives of the Most Remarkable Criminals Who have been Condemned and Executed for (#10)"],[1,"to secure that peace in  the world to come, which his own vices had hindered him from in this. He  got some good books which he read with continual devotion and attention,  submitted with the utmost patience to the miseries of his sad condition,  and finding his relations would take care of his daughter and that his  wife, for whom he never lost the most tender concern, would be in no  danger of want, he laid aside the thoughts of temporal matters  altogether expressing a readiness to die, and never showing any weakness  or impatience of the nearest approach of death.    Much of that firmness with which he behaved in these last moments of his  life might probably be owing to natural courage, of which certainly  Barton had a very large share. But the remains of virtue and religion,  to which the man had always a propensity, notwithstanding that he gave  way to passions which brought him to all the sorrows he knew, yet the  return he made, when in the shadow of death, to piety and devotion,  enabled him to suffer with great calmness, on Friday the 12th of May,  1721, aged about thirty-one years.          ROBERT PERKINS, Thief      I should never have undertaken this work without believing it might in  some degree be advantageous to the public. Young persons, and especially  those in a meaner state, are, I presume, those who will make up the  bulk of my readers, and these, too, are they who are more commonly  seduced into practices of this ignominious nature. I should therefore  think myself unpardonable if I did not take care to furnish them with  such cautions as the examples I am giving of the fatal consequences of  vice will allow, at the same time that I exhibit those adventures and  entertaining scenes which disguise the dismal path, and make the road to  ruin pleasing. They meet here with a true prospect of things, the tinsel  splendour of sensual pleasure, and that dreadful price men pay for  it--shameful death. I hope it may be of use in correcting the errors of  juvenile tempers devoted to their passions, with whom sometimes danger  passes for a certain road to honour, and the highway seems as tempting  to them as chivalry did to Don Quixote. Such and some other such like,  are very unlucky notions in young heads, and too often inspire them with  courage enough to dare the gallows, which seldom fails meeting with them  in the end.    As to the particulars of the person's life we are now speaking of, they  will be sufficient to warn those who are so unhappy as to suffer from  the ill-usage of their parents not to fall into courses of so base a  nature, but rather to try every honest method to submit rather than  commit dishonest acts, thereby justifying all the ill-treatment they  have received, and by their own follies blot out the remembrance of  their cruel parents' crimes. For though it sometimes happens that they  are reduced to necessities which force them, in a manner, on what brings  them to disgrace, yet the ill-natured world will charge all upon  themselves, or at most will spare their pity till it comes too late; and  when the poor wretch is dead will add to their reflections on him, as  harsh ones as on those from whom he is descended.    Robert Perkins was the son of a very considerable innkeeper, in or near  Hempsted, in Hertfordshire, who during the life-time of his wife treated  him with great tenderness and seeming affection, sending him to school  to a person in a neighbouring village, who was very considerable for his  art of teaching, and professing his settled resolution to give his son  Bob a very good education.    But no sooner had death snatched away the poor woman by whom Mr. Perkins  had our unhappy Robin, then his father began to change his measures.  First of all the unfortunate lad experienced the miseries that flow from  the careless management of a widower, who forgetting all obligations to  his deceased wife, thought of nothing but diverting himself, and getting  a new helpmate. But Robin continued not long in this state; his  hardships were quickly increased by the second marriage of his father,  upon which he was fetched home and treated with some kindness at first.  But in a little time perceiving how things were going, and perhaps  expressing his suspicions too freely, his mother-in-law soon prevailed  to have him turned out, and absolutely forbidden his father's house, the  ready way to force a naked uninstructed youth on the most sinful  courses. Whether Robin at that time did anything dishonest is not  certain, but being grievously pinched with cold one night, and troubled  also with dismal apprehensions of what might come to his sister, he got  a ladder and by the help of it climbed in at his mother's window. This  was immediately exaggerated into a design of cutting her throat, and  poor Bob was thereupon utterly discarded.    A short time after this, old Mr. Perkins died and left a fortune of  several thousand pounds behind him, for which the poor young man was  never a groat the better, being bound out 'prentice to a baker, and  left, as to everything else, to the wide world. His inclination, joined  to the rambling life which he had hitherto led, induced him to mind the  vulgar pleasures of drinking, gaming, and idling about much more than  his business, which to him appeared very laborious. There are everywhere  companions enough to be met with who are ready to teach ignorant youths  the practice of all sorts of debauchery. Perkins fell quickly among such  a set, and often rambled abroad with them on the usual errands of  whoring, shuffle-board, or skittle-playing, etc. The thoughts of that  estate which in justice he ought to have possessed, did not a little  contribute to make him thus heedless of his business, for as is usual  with weak minds, he affected living at the rate his father's fortune  would have afforded him, rather than in the frugal manner which his  narrow circumstance actually required; methods which necessarily pushed  him on such expeditions for supply as drew on those misfortunes which  rendered his life miserable and his death shameful.    One day, having agreed with some young lads in the neighbourhood to go  out upon the rake, they steered their course to Whitechapel, and going  into a little alehouse, began to drink stoutly, sing bawdy songs, and  indulge themselves in the rest of those brutal delights into which such  wretches are used to plunge under the name of pleasure. In the height,  however, of all their mirth, the people of the house missing out of the  till a crown piece with some particular marks, they sent for a constable  and some persons to assist him, who caused all the young fellows  instantly to be separated and searched one by one; on which the marked  crown was found in Robert Perkin's pocket, and he was thereupon  immediately carried before a Justice, who committed him to Newgate. The  sessions coming on soon after, and the case being plain, he was cast  and ordered for transportation, having time enough, however, before he  was shipped, to consider the melancholy circumstances into which his  ill-conduct had reduced him, and to think of what was fitting for him to  do in the present sad state he was in. At first nothing ran in his head  but the cruelties which he had met with from his family, but as the time  of his departure drew nearer he meditated how to gain the captain's  favour, and to escape some hardships in the voyage.    Robin had the good luck to make himself tolerably easy in the ship. His  natural good nature and obliging temper prevailing so far on the captain  of the vessel that he gave him all the liberty and afforded him whatever  indulgence it was in his power to permit with safety. But our young  traveller had much worse luck when he came on shore at Jamaica, where he  was immediately sold to a planter for ten pounds, and his trade of baker  being of little use there, his master put him upon much the same labour  as he did his negroes, Robin's constitution was really incapable of  great fatigue; his master, therefore, finding in the end that nothing  would make him work, sold him to another, who put him upon his own  employment of baking, building an oven on purpose. But whether this  master really used him cruelly or whether his idle inclinations made him  think all labour cruel usage, is hard to say, but however it was, Bob  ran away from this master and got on board a ship which carried him to  Carolina, from whence he said he travelled to Maryland and shipped  himself there, in a vessel for England. After being taken by the  Spaniards, and enduring many other great hardships, he at last with much  difficulty got home, as is too frequently the practice of these unhappy  wretches who are ready to return from tolerable plenty to the gallows.    After his arrival in England, he wrought for near two years together at  his own business, and had the settled intention to live honestly and  forsake that disorderly state of life which had involved him in such  calamities; but the fear he was continually in of being discovered,  rendered him so uneasy and so unable to do anything, that at last he  resolved to go over into the East Indies. For this purpose he was come  down to Gravesend, in order to embark, when he was apprehended; and  being tried on an indictment for returning from transportation, he was  convicted thereon, and received sentence of death. During the time he  lay under conviction, the principles of a good education began again to  exert themselves, and by leading him to a thorough confidence in the  mercies of Christ weaned him from that affection which hitherto he had  for this sinful and miserable world, in which, as he had felt nothing  but misery and affliction, the change seemed the easier, so that he at  last began not only to shake off the fear of death, bur even to desire  it. Nor was this calmness short and transitory, but he continued in it  till the time he suffered,"]]]
