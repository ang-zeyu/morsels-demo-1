I am getting on for sixteen, and could  surely bear myself as a man in the fray.\"    \"If the time should come, Harry, when the fortune of war may compel the  king to retire from Oxford--which I trust may never be--I would then  grant your request, for after your encounter with the officer who  commanded the Roundheads here, it would not be safe for you to remain  behind. But although you are too young to take part in the war, I may  find you employment. After a council that was held yesterday at Oxford,  I learned, from one in the king's secrets, that it was designed to send  a messenger to London with papers of importance, and to keep up the  communication with the king's friends in that city. There was some  debate as to who should be chosen. In London, at the present time, all  strangers are closely scrutinized. Every man is suspicious of his  neighbor, and it is difficult to find one of sufficient trust whose  person is unknown. Then I have thought that maybe you could well fulfill  this important mission. A boy would be unsuspected, where a man's every  movement would be watched. There is, of course, some danger attending  the mission, and sharpness and readiness will be needed. You have shown  that you possess these, by the manner in which you made your escape from  London, and methinks that, did you offer, your services would be  accepted. You would have, of course, to go in disguise, and to accept  any situation which might appear conformable to your character and add  to your safety.\"    Harry at once gladly assented to the proposal. He was at the age when  lads are most eager for adventure, and he thought that it would be great  fun to be living in London, watching the doings of the Commons, and, so  far as was in his power, endeavoring to thwart them. Accordingly in the  afternoon he rode over with Sir Henry to Oxford. They dismounted in the  courtyard of the building which served as the king's court, and  entering, Sir Henry left Harry in an antechamber, and, craving an  audience with his majesty, was at once ushered into the king's cabinet.  A few minutes later he returned, and motioned to Harry to follow him.  The latter did so, and the next moment found himself in the presence of  the king. The latter held out his hand for the boy to kiss, and Harry,  falling on one knee, and greatly abashed at the presence in which he  found himself, pressed his lips to King Charles' hand.    \"I hear from your father, my trusty Sir Henry Furness, that you are  willing to adventure your life in our cause, and to go as our messenger  to London, and act there as our intermediary with our friends. You seem  young for so delicate a work; but your father has told me somewhat of  the manner in which you escaped from the hands of the traitors at  Westminster, and also how you bore yourself in the affair with the  rebels at his residence. It seems to me, then, that we must not judge  your wisdom by your years, and that we can safely confide our interests  in your hands. Your looks are frank and boyish, and will, therefore,  excite far less suspicion than that which would attend upon an older and  graver-looking personage. The letters will be prepared for you  to-morrow, and, believe me, should success finally crown our efforts  against these enemies of the crown, your loyalty and devotion will not  be forgotten by your king.\"    He again held out his hand to Harry, and the boy left the cabinet with  his heart burning with loyalty toward his monarch, and resolved that  life itself should be held cheap if it could be spent in the service of  so gracious and majestic a king.    The next morning a royal messenger brought out a packet of letters to  Furness Hall, and Harry, mounting with his father and the little body of  horse at the hall, rode toward London. His attire was that of a country  peasant boy. The letters were concealed in the hollow of a stout ashen  stick which he carried, and which had been slightly weighted with lead,  so that, should it be taken up by any but its owner, its lightness would  not attract attention. Sir Henry rode with him as far as it was prudent  to do toward the outposts of the Parliament troops. Then, bidding him a  tender farewell, and impressing upon him the necessity for the utmost  caution, both for his own sake and for that of the king, he left him.    It was not upon the highroad that they parted, but near a village some  little distance therefrom. In his pocket Harry had two or three pieces  of silver, and between the soles of his boots were sewn several gold  coins. These he did not anticipate having to use; but the necessity  might arise when such a deposit would prove of use. Harry walked quietly  through the village, where his appearance was unnoticed, and then along  the road toward Reading. He soon met a troop of Parliament horsemen; but  as he was sauntering along quietly, as if merely going from one village  to another, no attention whatever was paid to him, and he reached  Reading without the slightest difficulty. There he took up his abode for  the night at a small hostelry, mentioning to the host that his master  had wanted him to join the king's forces, but that he had no stomach for  fighting, and intended to get work in the town. The following morning he  again started, and proceeded as far as Windsor, where he slept. The next  day, walking through Hounslow and Brentford, he stopped for the night at  the village of Kensington, and the following morning entered the city.  Harry had never before been in the streets of London, for in his flight  from his prison he had at once issued into the country, and the bustle  and confusion which prevailed excited great surprise in his mind. Even  Oxford, busy as it was at the time, and full of the troops of the king  and of the noblemen and gentlemen who had rallied to his cause, was yet  quiet when compared with London. The booths along the main streets were  filled with goods, and at these the apprentices shouted loudly to all  passer-by, \"What d'ye lack? What d'ye lack?\" Here was a mercer  exhibiting dark cloths to a grave-looking citizen; there an armorer was  showing the temper of his wares to an officer. Citizens' wives were  shopping and gossiping; groups of men, in high steeple hats and dark  cloak, were moving along the streets. Pack horses carried goods from the  ships at the wharves below the bridge to the merchants, and Harry was  jostled hither and thither by the moving crowd. Ascending the hill of  Ludgate to the great cathedral of St. Paul's, he saw a crowd gathered  round a person on an elevated stand in the yard, and approaching to see  what was going on, found that a preacher was pouring forth anathemas  against the king and the Royal party, and inciting the citizens to throw  themselves heart and soul into the cause. Especially severe was he upon  waverers, who, he said, were worse than downright enemies, as, while the  one withstood the Parliament openly in fair fight, the others were  shifted to and fro with each breeze, and none could say whether they  were friends or enemies. Passing through the cathedral, where regular  services were no longer held, but where, in different corners, preachers  were holding forth against the king, and where groups of men strolled up  and down, talking of the troubles of the times, he issued at the eastern  door, and entering Cheapside, saw the sign of the merchant to whom he  had been directed.    This was Nicholas Fleming, a man of Dutch descent, and well spoken of  among his fellows. He dealt in silks and velvets from Genoa. His shop  presented less outward appearance than did those of his neighbors, the  goods being too rich and rare to be exposed to the weather, and he  himself dealing rather with smaller traders than with the general  public. The merchant--a grave-looking man--was sitting at his desk when  Harry entered. A clerk was in the shop, engaged in writing, and an  apprentice was rolling up a piece of silk. Harry removed his hat, and  went up to the merchant's table, and laying a letter upon it, said:    \"I have come, sir, from Dame Marjory, my aunt, who was your honor's  nurse, with a letter from her, praying you to take me as an apprentice.\"    The merchant glanced for a moment at the boy. He was expecting a message  from the Royalist camp, and his keen wit at once led him to suspect that  the bearer stood before him, although his appearance in nowise justified  such a thought, for Harry had assumed with his peasant clothes a look of  stolid stupidity which certainly gave no warrant for the thought that a  keen spirit lay behind it. Without a word the merchant opened the  letter, which, in truth, contained nearly the same words which Harry had  spoken, but whose signature was sufficient to the merchant to indicate  that his suspicions were correct.    \"Sit down,\" he said to the lad. \"I am busy now; but will talk with you  anon.\"    Harry took his seat on a low stool, while the merchant continued his  writing as before, as if the incident were too unimportant to arrest his  attention for a moment. Harry amused himself by looking round the shop,  and was specially attracted by the movements of the apprentice, a  sharp-looking lad, rather younger than himself, and who, having heard  what had passed, seized every opportunity, when he was so placed that  neither the merchant nor his clerk could observe his face to make  grimaces at Harry, indicative of contempt and derision. Harry was sorely  tempted to laugh; but, with an effort, he kept his countenance, assuming  only a grim of wonder which greatly gratified Jacob, who thought that he  had obtained as companion a butt who would afford him infinite  amusement.    After the merchant had continued his writing for an hour, he laid down  his pen, and saying to Harry \"Follow me; I will speak to Dame Alice, my  wife, concerning thee,\" left the shop and entered the inner portion of  the house,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1159"],[0,"Fire-Tongue (#10)"],[1,"e, Phil,\" he said, gloomily. \"The  impudence of the man! Small wonder Abingdon objected.\"    Phil Abingdon tilted her chin forward rebelliously.    \"Ormuz Khan was merely unfamiliar with English customs,\" she retorted.  \"There was nothing otherwise in his behaviour to which any one could  have taken exception.\"    \"What's that!\" demanded the physician. \"If a man of colour paid his  heathen attentions to my daughter--\"    \"But you have no daughter, Doctor.\"    \"No. But if I had--\"    \"If you had,\" echoed Phil Abingdon, and was about to carry on this wordy  warfare which, Harley divined, was of old standing between the two, when  sudden realization of the purpose of the visit came to her. She paused,  and he saw her biting her lips desperately. Almost at random he began to  speak again.    \"So far as you are aware, then, Miss Abingdon, Sir Charles never met  Ormuz Khan?\"    \"He never even saw him, Mr. Harley, that I know of.\"    \"It is most extraordinary that he should have given me the impression  that this man--for I can only suppose that he referred to Ormuz  Khan--was in some way associated with his fears.\"    \"I must remind you, Mr. Harley,\" Doctor McMurdoch interrupted, \"that  poor Abingdon was a free talker. His pride, I take it, which was  strong, had kept him silent on this matter with me, but he welcomed an  opportunity of easing his mind to one discreet and outside the family  circle. His words to you may have had no bearing upon the thing he  wished to consult you about.\"    \"H'm,\" mused Harley. \"That's possible. But such was not my impression.\"    He turned again to Phil Abingdon. \"This Ormuz Khan, I understood you to  say, actually resides in or near London?\"    \"He is at present living at the Savoy, I believe. He also has a house  somewhere outside London.\"    There were a hundred other questions Paul Harley was anxious to ask:  some that were professional but more that were personal. He found  himself resenting the intrusion of this wealthy Oriental into the  life of the girl who sat there before him. And because he could read a  kindred resentment in the gloomy eye of Doctor McMurdoch, he was drawn  spiritually closer to that dour character.    By virtue of his training he was a keen psychologist, and he perceived  clearly enough that Phil Abingdon was one of those women in whom a  certain latent perversity is fanned to life by opposition. Whether  she was really attracted by Ormuz Khan or whether she suffered his  attentions merely because she knew them to be distasteful to others, he  could not yet decide.    Anger threatened him--as it had threatened him when he had realized that  Nicol Brinn meant to remain silent. He combated it, for it had no place  in the judicial mind of the investigator. But he recognized its presence  with dismay. Where Phil Abingdon was concerned he could not trust  himself. In her glance, too, and in the manner of her answers to  questions concerning the Oriental, there was a provoking femininity--a  deliberate and baffling intrusion of the eternal Eve.    He stared questioningly across at Doctor McMurdoch and perceived a  sudden look of anxiety in the physician's face. Quick as the thought  which the look inspired, he turned to Phil Abingdon.    She was sitting quite motionless in the big armchair, and her face had  grown very pale. Even as he sprang forward he saw her head droop.    \"She has fainted,\" said Doctor McMurdoch. \"I'm not surprised.\"    \"Nor I,\" replied Harley. \"She should not have come.\"    He opened the door communicating with his private apartments and  ran out. But, quick as he was, Phil Abingdon had recovered before he  returned with the water for which he had gone. Her reassuring smile was  somewhat wan. \"How perfectly silly of me!\" she said. \"I shall begin to  despise myself.\"    Presently he went down to the street with his visitors.    \"There must be so much more you want to know, Mr. Harley,\" said Phil  Abingdon. \"Will you come and see me?\"    He promised to do so. His sentiments were so strangely complex that  he experienced a desire for solitude in order that he might strive to  understand them. As he stood at the door watching the car move toward  the Strand he knew that to-day he could not count upon his intuitive  powers to warn him of sudden danger. But he keenly examined the faces of  passers-by and stared at the occupants of those cabs and cars which  were proceeding in the same direction as the late Sir Charles Abingdon's  limousine.    No discovery rewarded him, however, and he returned upstairs to his  office deep in thought. \"I am in to nobody,\" he said as he passed the  desk at which Innes was at work.    \"Very good, Mr. Harley.\"    Paul Harley walked through to the private office and, seating himself at  the big, orderly table, reached over to a cupboard beside him and took  out a tin of smoking mixture. He began very slowly to load his pipe,  gazing abstractedly across the room at the tall Burmese cabinet.    He realized that, excepting the extraordinary behaviour and the veiled  but significant statements of Nicol Brinn, his theory that Sir Charles  Abingdon had not died from natural causes rested upon data of the most  flimsy description. From Phil Abingdon he had learned nothing whatever.  Her evidence merely tended to confuse the case more hopelessly.    It was sheer nonsense to suppose that Ormuz Khan, who was evidently  interested in the girl, could be in any way concerned in the death of  her father. Nevertheless, as an ordinary matter of routine, Paul Harley,  having lighted his pipe, made a note on a little block:    Cover activities of Ormuz Khan.    He smoked reflectively for a while and then added another note:    Watch Nicol Brinn.    For ten minutes or more he sat smoking and thinking, his unseeing gaze  set upon the gleaming lacquer of the cabinet; and presently, as he  smoked, he became aware of an abrupt and momentary chill. His sixth  sense was awake again. Taking up a pencil, he added a third note:    Watch yourself. You are in danger.        CHAPTER VIII. A WREATH OF HYACINTHS    Deep in reflection and oblivious of the busy London life around him,  Paul Harley walked slowly along the Strand. Outwardly he was still the  keen-eyed investigator who could pry more deeply into a mystery than  any other in England; but to-day his mood was introspective. He was in a  brown study.    The one figure which had power to recall him to the actual world  suddenly intruded itself upon his field of vision. From dreams which he  recognized in the moment of awakening to have been of Phil Abingdon, he  was suddenly aroused to the fact that Phil Abingdon herself was present.  Perhaps, half subconsciously, he had been looking for her.    Veiled and dressed in black, he saw her slim figure moving through the  throng. He conceived the idea that there was something furtive in her  movements. She seemed to be hurrying along as if desirous of avoiding  recognition. Every now and again she glanced back, evidently in search  of a cab, and a dormant suspicion which had lain in Harley's mind now  became animate. Phil Abingdon was coming from the direction of the Savoy  Hotel. Was it possible that she had been to visit Ormuz Khan?    Harley crossed the Strand and paused just in front of the hurrying,  black-clad figure. \"Miss Abingdon,\" he said, \"a sort of instinct told me  that I should meet you to-day.\"    She stopped suddenly, and through the black veil which she wore he saw  her eyes grow larger--or such was the effect as she opened them widely.  Perhaps he misread their message. To him Phil Abingdon's expression was  that of detected guilt. More than ever he was convinced of the truth of  his suspicions. \"Perhaps you were looking for a cab?\" he suggested.    Overcoming her surprise, or whatever emotion had claimed her at  the moment of this unexpected meeting, Phil Abingdon took Harley's  outstretched hand and held it for a moment before replying. \"I had  almost despaired of finding one,\" she said, \"and I am late already.\"    \"The porter at the Savoy would get you one.\"    \"I have tried there and got tired of waiting,\" she answered quite  simply.    For a moment Harley's suspicions were almost dispelled, and, observing  an empty cab approaching, he signalled to the man to pull up.    \"Where do you want to go to?\" he inquired, opening the door.    \"I am due at Doctor McMurdoch's,\" she replied, stepping in.    Paul Harley hesitated, glancing from the speaker to the driver.    \"I wonder if you have time to come with me,\" said Phil Abingdon. \"I know  the doctor wants to see you.\"    \"I will come with pleasure,\" replied Harley, a statement which was no  more than true.    Accordingly he gave the necessary directions to the taxi man and seated  himself beside the girl in the cab.    \"I am awfully glad of an opportunity of a chat with you, Mr. Harley,\"  said Phil Abingdon. \"The last few days have seemed like one long  nightmare to me.\" She sighed pathetically. \"Surely Doctor McMurdoch is  right, and all the horrible doubts which troubled us were idle ones,  after all?\"    She turned to Harley, looking almost eagerly into his face. \"Poor daddy  hadn't an enemy in the world, I am sure,\" she said. \"His extraordinary  words to you no doubt have some simple explanation. Oh, it would be such  a relief to know that his end was a natural one. At least it would dull  the misery of it all a little bit.\"    The appeal in her eyes was of a kind which Harley found much difficulty  in resisting. It would have been happiness to offer consolation to this  sorrowing girl. But, although he could not honestly assure her that  he had abandoned his theories, he realized that the horror of her  suspicions was having a dreadful effect upon Phil Abingdon's mind.    \"You may quite possibly be right,\" he said, gently. \"In any event, I  hope you will think as little as possible about the morbid side of this  unhappy business.\"    \"I try to,\" she assured him,"]]]
