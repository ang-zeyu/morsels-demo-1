Mrs. Bott thanked him and took the notice away with her, but its  publication had no result. The old professor began to fail, he no longer  had an instrument upon which to teach his pupils, and those he could  avail himself of seemed harsh and discordant. He had no appetite, and  even found no solace in his pipe. Almost penniless they were forced to  give up their lodgings and move to Hoboken. Mrs. Bott still kept up the  search, but the professor could no longer tramp the streets looking for  his violin. He sat silent in his room, slowly, surely, dying of a broken  heart.    In course of time some one advised Mrs. Bott to lay her case before the  District Attorney, and accordingly, during the summer, she visited the  Criminal Courts Building and told her story to Colonel Allen, one of the  assistants, who became greatly interested. The overwrought old woman had  begun to suspect everybody, and even to accuse her husband's friend,  Flechter, of a lack of any real interest. She thought he ought to be  able to find the violin if he really made the effort. Allen began to  take notice. The sleuth in him pricked up its ears. Why, sure,  certainly, Flechter was the one man who knew what Bott's violin was  really worth--the one man who could sell it to advantage--and he had  been done out of five hundred dollars by the old musician's stupidity.  Allen thought he'd take a look into the thing. Now, there lived in the  same boarding-house with Allen a friend of his named Harry P. Durden,  and to Durden Allen recounted the story of the lost violin and voiced  his suspicions of Flechter. Durden entered enthusiastically into the  case, volunteering to play the part of an amateur detective. Accordingly  Durden, accompanied by a Central Office man named Baird, visited  Flechter's place of business and the two represented themselves as  connoisseurs in violins and anxious to procure a genuine Strad. for a  certain Mr. Wright in St. Paul. Flechter expressed entire confidence in  his ability to procure one, and did almost succeed in purchasing for  them the so-called \"Jupiter Strad.\"    All this took time, and at last, on April 28th, 1895, poor old Bott died  in his boarding-house in Hoboken. After the funeral the widow settled up  her affairs, changing her boarding place temporarily, and, having no  ties in this country, determined to return to end her days in the  Fatherland. On May 21st she wrote to Flechter, who had lost all track of  her, that her husband had died, that she had moved to 306 River Street,  Hoboken, and that she thought seriously of going back to Germany. Two  days later Flechter wrote the following letter to the Central Office  man, who had given his name as Southan, an employe of the alleged Mr.  Wright:        MR. SOUTHAN, care of H. P. Durden.        _Dear Sir_: Write to inform you that I have a genuine Strad. to      offer you and would like to see you at your earliest convenience.        Very respectfully yours,        VICTOR S. FLECHTER.    When Allen saw this letter it seemed to him absolutely to confirm his  suspicions. Now that the only person in the world who had been  authoritatively able to identify the \"Duke of Cambridge\" Stradivarius  was dead, Flechter was offering one for sale.    Then occurred the strangest thing of all. On May 28th, five days after  Flechter's letter to Southan, Mrs. Bott received the following  extraordinary epistle. Like the notice given her by Flechter in his  office, it was partly written in printed capitals and partly in script.        _May 28, 1895._        To MRS. BOTT, 306 River Street, Hoboken, N. J.        _Dear Madam_: I wish to inform you that the violin taken from your      house some time ago will be returned if you are willing to abide by      agreements that will be made between you and I later on. It was my      intention first to dispose of it, but on account of its great value      and the danger it would place me in by offering for sale being a      violin maker and dealer and not being able to sell with safety for      such a large sum of money I concluded to wait. I have now thought      the matter over and come to the conclusion that a little money is      better than none and if you are anxious for the return of the violin      and willing to pay a sum of money, small compared with the value of      the violin, I think we can make a deal. You can put a personal in      the New York Sun saying I am willing to give a sum of money for the      return of the violin. No questions asked. Mrs. J. Bott. When I see      your personal in the Sun I will let you know how the exchange can be      made. CAVE DWELLER.    This letter appeared to be written in a somewhat similar hand to that  which penned the offer of the reward, which, according to Mrs. Bott, was  Flechter's. By this time the widow and Allen, were in close  communication. The \"Cave Dweller\" letter, could it be shown to be in  Flechter's penmanship, seemed to fix the crime on the violin dealer.    Flechter's store is two flights up and looks out into Union Square.  Before the window hangs a large gilded fiddle and the walls are  decorated with pictures of famous musicians. In the rear is a safe where  the more valuable instruments are kept; in the front sits Flechter  himself, a stoutish man of middle height, with white hair and mustache.  But on June 23, 1895, Flechter was out when Durden and Baird called, and  only his clerk and office-boy were on hand. Durden wished, he said, to  see the genuine Strad. about which Mr. Flechter had written him. The boy  went to the safe and brought back a violin in a red silk bag. Inside was  inscribed:    \"Antonius Stradivarius Cremonis fecit Anno Domini 1725.\"    The figures 17 were printed and the 25 written in ink. Durden examined  it for some fifteen minutes and noted certain markings upon it.    On June 26th they called again, found Flechter in and asked to see the  violin. This time the dealer look it himself from the safe, and, at  their request, carried it to 22 Gramercy Park, where Durden said he  desired some experts to pass upon its genuineness. On the way over  Flechter guaranteed it to be a genuine Strad., and said it belonged to a  retired merchant named Rossman, who would expect to get four thousand  dollars for it. He himself would want five hundred dollars, and Durden  should have five hundred dollars, so that they must not take less than  five thousand dollars.    Once at Allen's boarding-house Flechter played upon the violin for  Durden and the supposed Southan, and then the former asked to be allowed  to take the instrument to a rear room and show it to a friend. Here  Mrs. Bott, positively identified the violin as that of her husband,  clasping it to her bosom like a long-lost child. This was enough for  Durden, who gave the instrument back to Flechter and caused his arrest  as he was passing out of the front gate. The insulted dealer stormed and  raged, but the Car of Juggernaut had started upon its course, and that  night Flechter was lodged in the city prison. Next morning he was  brought before Magistrate Flammer in the Jefferson Market Police Court  and the violin was taken out of its case, which the police had sealed.  At this, the first hearing in this extraordinary case, Mrs. Bott, of  course, identified the violin positively as \"The Duke of Cambridge,\" and  several other persons testified that, in substance, it was Bott's  celebrated violin. But for the defendant a number of violin makers swore  that it was not the Bott violin at all, and more--that it was not even a  Stradivarius. One of them, John J. Eller, to whom it will be necessary  to revert later, made oath that the violin was _his_, stolen from him  and brought to Flechter by the thief. On this testimony the magistrate  naturally decided that the identity of the instrument had not been  established and ordered that Flechter be discharged and the violin  returned to him.    Ordinarily that would have been the end of the case, but Allen had his  own private views as to the guilt of the dealer and on August 28th the  Grand Jury filed an indictment against Flechter accusing him of  feloniously receiving stolen property--the violin--knowing it to have  been stolen. Great was Flechter's anger and chagrin, but he promptly  gave bail and employed the ablest counsel he could afford.    Now began the second act of this tragedy of errors. The case was called  for trial with the People's interests in the hands of James W. Osborne,  just advancing into the limelight as a resourceful and relentless  prosecutor. I say the _People's_ case but perhaps _Allen's_ case would  be a more fitting title. For the defense Arthur W. Palmer held the fort,  directing his fire upon Osborne and losing no advantage inadvertently  given him. The noise of the conflict filled the court house and drowned  the uproar on Broadway. Nightly and each morning the daily press gave  columns to the proceedings. Every time the judge coughed the important  fact was given due prominence. And every gibe of counsel carried behind  it its insignia of recognition--\"[_Laughter_]\" It was one of those first  great battles in which the professional value of compressed air as an  explosive force and small pica type as projectiles was demonstrated. It  was a combat of wind and lead--an endurance contest during which the  jury slept fitfully for three long weeks.    Two things, the prosecution claimed, proved Flechter's guilt: first, the  fact that the violin found in his possession was \"The Duke of  Cambridge\"; second, that the \"Cave-Dweller\" letter was in the same  handwriting as Flechter's notice of reward.    Of course the latter proposition carried with it the necessity of  proving in the first place that the notice itself was in Flechter's  penmanship. Flechter through his counsel said it wasn't, and that he had  never told Mrs Bott that it was. He claimed that his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13177"],[0,"Chocolate and Cocoa Recipes and Home Made Candy Recipes (#10)"],[1,"balls or oblongs. For other candies, roll a piece of  the fondant into a ball, flatten it with the fingers and use to cover a  whole pecan or English walnut meat. Set each shape on a plate as it is  finished. They will harden very quickly. Dip these, one by one, in  Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate and set on an oil cloth.      CHOCOLATE PEANUT CLUSTERS    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE PEANUT CLUSTERS.]    Shell a quart of freshly-roasted peanuts and remove the skins. Drop the  peanuts, one by one, into the center of a dish of \"Dot\" Chocolate made  ready for use; lift out onto oil cloth with a dipping fork (a wire fork  comes for the purpose, but a silver oyster fork answers nicely) to make  groups of three nuts,--two below, side by side, and one above and  between the others.      CHOCOLATE COATED ALMONDS    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE COATED ALMONDS.]    Select nuts that are plump at the ends. Use them without blanching.  Brush, to remove dust. Melt \"Dot\" Chocolate and when cooled properly  drop the nuts, one at a time, into the center of it; push the nuts under  with the fork, then drop onto waxed paper or oil cloth. In removing the  fork make a design on the top of each nut. These are easily prepared and  are particularly good.      PLAIN AND CHOCOLATE DIPPED PARISIAN SWEETS    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE DIPPED PARISIAN SWEETS.]        1/2 a cup of Sultana raisins,      5 figs,      1 cup of dates,      2 ounces citron,      2/3 a cup of nut meats, (almonds, filberts, pecans or walnuts, one          variety or a mixture),      1-1/2 ounces of Baker's Chocolate,      1/3 a cup of confectioner's sugar,      1/4 a teaspoonful of salt,      Chocolate Fondant or      Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.    Pour boiling water over the figs and dates, let boil up once, then drain  as dry as possible; remove stones from the dates, the stem ends from the  figs; chop the fruit and nut meats (almonds should be blanched) in a  food chopper; add the salt; and the sugar and work the whole to a smooth  paste; add the chocolate, melted, and work it evenly through the mass.  Add more sugar if it is needed and roll the mixture into a sheet  one-fourth an inch thick. Cut into strips an inch wide. Cut the strips  into diamond-shaped pieces (or squares); roll these in confectioner's  sugar or dip them in chocolate fondant or in Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate,  and sprinkle a little fine-chopped pistachio nut meats on the top of the  dipped pieces. When rolling the mixture use confectioner's sugar on  board and rolling pin.      STUFFED DATES, CHOCOLATE DIPPED    [Illustration: STUFFED DATES, CHOCOLATE DIPPED.]    Cut choice dates open on one side and remove the seeds. Fill the open  space in the dates with a strip of preserved ginger or pineapple,  chopped nuts or chopped nuts mixed with white or chocolate fondant;  press the dates into a compact form to keep in the filling, then dip  them, one by one, in \"Dot\" Chocolate.      CHOCOLATE OYSTERETTES, PLAIN AND WITH CHOPPED FIGS    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE OYSTERETTES.]        Oyster crackers, salted preferred, fine-chopped, roasted peanuts or          raisins or 3 or 4 basket figs or a little French fruit cut in          very small bits,      1/2 a pound or more of Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.    Select fresh-baked crackers free from crumbs. Dip in \"Dot\" Chocolate,  made ready as in previous recipes, and dispose on oil cloth or waxed  paper. For a change add figs or other fruit, cut very fine, or chopped  nuts to the chocolate ready for dipping.      TURKISH PASTE WITH FRENCH FRUIT, CHOCOLATE FLAVORED    [Illustration: TURKISH PASTE WITH FRENCH FRUIT.]        3 level tablespoonfuls of granulated gelatine,      1/2 a cup of cold water,      2 cups of sugar,      2/3 a cup of cold water,      1 teaspoonful of ground cinnamon,      2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract,      1 cup of French candied fruit, cherries, angelica, citron, etc.,        chopped fine.    Let the gelatine stand in the half cup of cold water until it has taken  up all of the water. Stir the sugar and the two-thirds a cup of cold  water over the fire until the sugar is dissolved and the syrup is  boiling, then add the gelatine and let cook twenty minutes; add the  cinnamon, the chocolate, melted over hot water, and beat all together,  then add the vanilla and the fruit; let stand in a cool place for a  time, then when it thickens a little turn into an _un_buttered bread pan  and set aside until the next day. To unmold separate the paste from the  pan--at the edge--with a sharp-pointed knife. Sift confectioner's sugar  over the top, then with the tips of the fingers gently pull the paste  from the pan to a board dredged with confectioner's sugar; cut into  strips, then into small squares. Roll each square in confectioner's  sugar. In cutting keep sugar between the knife and the paste.      CHOICE CHOCOLATE PECAN PRALINES    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE PECAN PRALINES.]        3 cups of granulated sugar,      1 cup of cream,      1 cup of sugar cooked to caramel,      2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      3 cups of pecan nut meats.    Stir the sugar and cream over the fire until the sugar is melted, then  let boil to the soft ball degree, or to 236 deg. F. Add the chocolate,  melted or shaved fine, and beat it in, then pour the mixture onto the  cup of sugar cooked to caramel; let the mixture boil up once, then  remove from the fire; add the nut meats and beat until the mass begins  to thicken. When cold enough to hold its shape drop onto an oil cloth or  marble, a teaspoonful in a place, and at once set a half nut meat on  each. Two persons are needed to make these pralines, one to drop the  mixture, the other to decorate with the halves of the nuts. The mixture  becomes smooth and firm almost instantly. Maple or brown sugar may be  used in place of all or a part of the quantity of granulated sugar  designated.      VASSAR FUDGE    [Illustration: VASSAR FUDGE.]        2 cups of white granulated sugar,      1 cup of cream,      1 tablespoonful of butter,      1/4 a cake of Baker's Premium No. 1 Chocolate.    Put in the sugar and cream, and when this becomes hot put in the  chocolate, broken up into fine pieces. Stir vigorously and constantly.  Put in butter when it begins to boil. Stir until it creams when beaten  on a saucer. Then remove and beat until quite cool and pour into  buttered tins. When cold cut in diamond-shaped pieces.      SMITH COLLEGE FUDGE    [Illustration: SMITH COLLEGE FUDGE.]    Melt one-quarter cup of butter. Mix together in a separate dish one cup  of white sugar, one cup of brown sugar, one-quarter cup of molasses and  one-half cup of cream. Add this to the butter, and after it has been  brought to a boil continue boiling for two and one-half minutes,  stirring rapidly. Then add two squares of Baker's Premium No. 1  Chocolate, scraped fine. Boil this five minutes, stirring it first  rapidly, and then more slowly towards the end. After it has been taken  from the fire, add one and one-half teaspoonfuls of vanilla. Then stir  constantly until the mass thickens. Pour into buttered pan and set in a  cool place.      WELLESLEY MARSHMALLOW FUDGE    [Illustration: WELLESLEY MARSHMALLOW FUDGE.]    Heat two cups of granulated sugar and one cup of rich milk (cream is  better). Add two squares of Baker's Chocolate, and boil until it hardens  in cold water. Just before it is done add a small piece of butter, then  begin to stir in marshmallows, crushing and beating them with a spoon.  Continue to stir in marshmallows, after the fudge has been taken from  the fire, until half a pound has been stirred into the fudge. Cool in  sheets three-quarters of an inch thick, and cut in cubes.      DOUBLE FUDGE    [Illustration: DOUBLE FUDGE.]        2 cups of granulated sugar,      2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      1/2 a cup of cream,      1 tablespoonful of butter.    Boil seven minutes; then beat and spread in buttered tin to cool.        2 cups of brown sugar,      1/2 a cup of cream,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract,      1 cup of walnut meats, chopped fine,      Butter size of a walnut.    Boil ten minutes; then beat and pour on top of fudge already in pan.  When cool, cut in squares.      MARBLED FUDGE    [Illustration: MARBLED FUDGE.]        2 cups of granulated sugar,      1/4 a cup of glucose (pure corn syrup),      1-1/2 cups of cream,      1 tablespoonful of butter,      2 squares of Baker's Chocolate, scraped fine or melted,      2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla.    Stir the sugar, glucose and cream over a slack fire until the sugar is  melted; move the saucepan to a hotter part of the range and continue  stirring until the mixture boils, then let boil, stirring every three or  four minutes very gently, until the thermometer registers 236 deg. F., or,  till a soft ball can be formed in cold water. Remove from the fire and  pour one-half of the mixture over the chocolate. Set both dishes on a  cake rack, or on something that will allow the air to circulate below  the dishes. When the mixture cools a little, get some one to beat one  dish of the fudge; add a teaspoonful of vanilla to each dish, and beat  until thick and slightly grainy, then put the mixture in a pan, lined  with waxed paper, first a little of one and then of the other, to give a  marbled effect. When nearly cold turn from the pan, peel off the paper  and cut into cubes.      FUDGE HEARTS OR ROUNDS    [Illustration: FUDGE HEARTS OR ROUNDS.]        2 cups of granulated sugar,      1/3 a cup of condensed milk,      1/3 a cup of water,      1/4 a cup of butter,      1-1/2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract.    Boil the sugar, milk and water to 236 deg. F., or to the \"soft ball\" degree;  stir gently every few minutes; add the butter and let boil up  vigorously, then remove from the fire and add the chocolate; let stand  undisturbed until cool, then add the vanilla and beat the candy until it  thickens and begins to"]]]
