The brass candlesticks shone like gold,  the mahogany table was polished like a mirror, the simple furniture  likewise. For today was Father Mozart's birthday and the little  household was to celebrate the event.    Mother Mozart had been busy all day putting everything in order  while Nannerl, the seven year old daughter, had been helping. Little  Wolfgang, now three years old, in his childish eagerness to be as busy  as the others, had only hindered, and had to be reprimanded once in a  while. One could never be vexed with the little elf, even if he turned  somersaults in new clean clothes, or made chalk figures all over the  living-room chairs. He never meant to do any harm, and was always so  tenderhearted and lovable, it was hard to scold him.    And this was the Father's birthday, about the most important of all  the family celebrations. Already the roast on the spit was nearing  perfection, while in the oven a fine cake was browning.    When all was ready and Leopold Mozart had received the good wishes  of the little household, baby Wolfgang was mounted on a footstool to  recite a poem, in honor of the occasion. When he had finished it he  stood quietly a moment then reaching out his tiny arms, clasped them  tightly about his father's neck, and said:    \"Dear papa, I love you very, very much; after God, next comes my  papa.\"    Leopold Mozart was a musician and held the post of Vice-Capellmeister.  Music was honored in this simple home, and when two of the Court  musicians, friends of Father Mozart, came in to join the festivities  on this birthday night, a toast was drunk to the honor of _Musica_,  the divine goddess of tones.    \"I wonder if even a little of my own musical knowledge and love for  the art will overflow upon the two dear children,\" remarked Father  Mozart, gazing down tenderly on the little ones.    \"Why not,\" answered the mother; \"you long ago promised to begin  lessons with Nannerl; can she not start this very night?\"    \"Yes, indeed, Papachen, may I not learn to play the piano? I promise  to work very hard.\"    \"Very well,\" answered the father; \"you shall see I am grateful for all  the love you have showed me tonight, and I will begin to teach Nannerl  at once.\"    \"I want to learn music too,\" broke in little Wolfgang, looking at his  father with beaming eyes.    Every one laughed at this, while the father said baby Wolfgang would  have to grow some inches before he could reach the keys.    The lesson began, and the little girl showed both quickness and  patience to grasp the ideas. No one at first noticed the tiny child  who planted himself at his sister's elbow, the light of the candles  falling on his delicate, sensitive features and bright brown hair. His  glance never left Nannerl's fingers as they felt hesitatingly  among the white and black keys, while his ear easily understood the  intervals she tried to play.    When the little girl left the piano, or the harpsichord, as it was  called in those days, Wolfgang slipped into her place and began to  repeat with his tiny fingers what his father had taught her. He sought  the different intervals, and when at last he found them, his little  face beamed with joy. In a short time he was able to play all the  simple exercises that had been given his sister.    The parents listened to their wonder-child with ever increasing  astonishment, mingled with tears of emotion. It was plain to be seen  that Wolfgang must have lessons as well as Nannerl. And what joy it  would be to teach them both.    It was a happy household that retired that night. Nannerl was happy  because she at last had the chance to take piano lessons. Wolfgang,  little \"Starbeam,\" dreamed of the wonderful Goddess of Music, who  carried him away to fairyland which was filled with beautiful music.  The parents were filled with joy that heaven had granted them such  blessings in their children.    The musical progress of the children was quite remarkable. Marianne,  which was Nannerl's real name, soon began to play very well indeed,  while little Wolfgang hardly had to be told anything in music, for  he seemed to know it already. The father would write Minuets for the  little girl to study; her tiny brother would learn them in half an  hour. Soon Wolfgang was able to compose his own Minuets. Several have  come down to us which he wrote when he was five years old; and they  are quite perfect in form and style.    One day Father Mozart brought home Schachtner, the Court trumpeter, to  dinner. Coming suddenly into the living-room, they found the tiny elf  busily writing at his father's desk.    \"Whatever are you doing, Wolferl?\" cried his father, gazing at the ink  stained fingers of his little son and then at the paper covered with  blots.    \"Oh, Papa, a piano sonata, but it isn't finished yet.\"    \"Never mind that,\" said Leopold Mozart, \"let us see it, it must be  something very fine.\" Taking up the paper the father and his friend  looked at it curiously. The sheets were bedaubed with ink stains that  almost concealed the notes. For the child had thrust his pen each time  to the bottom of the ink well, so that frequent blots on the paper  were the result. These did not trouble him in the least, for he  merely rubbed his hand over the offending blot and proceeded with his  writing.    At first the two friends laughed heartily to see how the little  composer had written the notes over smudges, but soon the father's  eyes filled with happy tears.    \"Look, my dear Schachtner!\" he cried. \"See how correct and orderly it  all is, all written according to rule. Only one could never play it  for it seems to be too difficult.\"    \"But it's a sonata, Papa, and one must practice it first, of course,  but this is the way it should go.\"    He sprang to the piano and began to play. The small fingers could not  master the more intricate parts, but gave sufficient idea of how he  intended the piece to sound.    They stood in speechless astonishment at this proof of the child's  powers; then Leopold Mozart caught up the little composer and kissing  him cried, \"My Wolfgang, you will become a great musician.\"    Wolfgang, not content with merely learning the piano, begged to study  the violin also. His violin lessons had hardly begun when one evening  his father and two friends were about to play a set of six trios,  composed by Wentzl, one of the players. Wolfgang begged to be allowed  to play the second violin. Needless to say his request was refused.  At last he was told he might sit next to Schachtner and make believe  play, though he must make no sound.    The playing began, when before long it was seen the boy was actually  playing the second violin part and doing it correctly. The second  violin ceased bowing in amazement and allowed Wolfgang to go on alone.  After this he was permitted to play all the second violin part of  the whole six pieces. Emboldened by this success, he volunteered  to attempt the first violin part, an offer which was greeted with  laughter; but nothing daunted, he took up his violin and began. There  were mistakes here and there, of course, but he persisted to the end,  to the astonishment of all.    Three years had passed swiftly by since little Wolfgang Mozart began  to study music the night of his father's fortieth birthday. He had  made marvelous progress and already the fame of his powers had passed  beyond the narrow limits of his native town. Leopold Mozart had no  means other than the salary which he received from the Court. His  children's musical gifts induced the father to turn them to advantage,  both to supply the family needs and to provide the children a broad  education in music. He determined to travel with the children. A  first experiment in January, 1762, had proved so successful that the  following September they set out for Vienna. Wolfgang was now six  years old and Marianne eleven.    At Linz they gave a successful concert and every one was delighted  with the playing of the children. From here they continued their  journey as far as the monastery of Ips, where they expected to stay  for the night. It had been a wonderful day, spent in sailing down  the majestic Danube, till they reached the grey old building with  its battlemented walls. Soon after they arrived, Father Mozart took  Wolfgang into the chapel to see the organ.    The child gazed with awe at the great pipes, the keyboard and the  pedals. He begged his father to explain their working, and then as  the father filled the great bellows the tiny organist pushed aside  the organ bench, stood upon the pedals and trod them, as though he had  always known how. The monks in the monastery hastened to the chapel,  holding their breath as one pointed to the figure of a tiny child in  the organ loft. Was it possible, they asked themselves, that a child  could produce such beautiful music? They remained rooted to the spot,  till Wolfgang happened to see them and crept meekly down from his  perch.    All the rest of the journey to Vienna, Wolfgang was the life of the  party, eager to know the name and history of everything they met. At  the custom-house on the frontier, he made friends with the officials  by playing for them on his violin, and thus secured an easy pass for  the party.    Arrived at Vienna, Leopold Mozart found the fame of the children's  playing had preceded them. A kind and gracious welcome awaited the  little party when they went to the palace of Schoenbrunn. The Emperor  Franz Josef took to Wolfgang at once, was delighted with his playing  and called him his \"little magician.\" The boy's powers were tested by  being required to read difficult pieces at sight, and playing with one  finger, as the Emperor jestingly asked him to do. Next, the keyboard  was covered with a cloth, as a final test, but little Wolfgang played  as finely as before, to the great delight of the company who applauded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13300"],[0,"The Doctrine and Practice of Yoga (#10)"],[1,"outlaws.\"    \"Deliver thou thyself, by thyself  Ah, do not let thyself sink  For thou art thyself thy greatest friend  And thyself (the relative 'I') thy greatest enemy.\"    This, student, is not the ravings of a lunatic. It is the secret of  SAT-CHIT-ANANDA--eternal existence, knowledge and bliss. Attainment  of perfection means absolute Freedom. Do you or would you know the  meaning of Life? It is the search after _Sat-chit-ananda_. But man is  trying to realise this Perfect Existence in the transitory things of  the earth-plane. Only when he knows that not attachment to the things  of the \"world, the flesh and the devil\" but renunciation of same and the  bringing of the Impersonal Ideal into his everyday life would lead him  to it, then Maya will have fulfilled its purpose--which is to show man  his divinity. \"Kill out the desire for life. Kill out Ambition. Kill out  desire for comfort; yet work as those who love life. Respect life as  those who are ambitious. Be happy as those are who live for happiness.\"    So says Mabel Collins in the _Light on the Path_. Yes, you must work  constantly, train your intellect, develop your personality but do not do  all this for your own personal self but for the Higher Self, The BRAHMAN,  Eternal--to manifest through. As soon as you lose this view-point your  personal strivings end in Pain and Disappointment. Work as hard as the  ambitious man and the lover of pleasures but remember your actions are  inspired by different motives. Here Spirit is the director.    \"To the work thou hast the right, O Partha, but not to the fruits  thereof\"--_Gita_. All clinging to results leads to degeneration. The  soul should cling to nothing. All work and all effort must be dedicated  unto the Higher Self. When you care for the results you are only  worshipping the lower self. Hence the value of selfless labour, thus the  maya-fascinated mind is purified and de-hypnotised and we attain to the  emergence of the personal into the Impersonal. Either say \"I am thou, O  Lord!\" and thus out at the root of the lower \"I\" and destroy it for ever  or say \"I am nothing, O Eternal One! thou art everything\" and thereby  lose the lower into the Higher. The first is for the Gnani--the second  for the Bhakti Yogi. Both mean the same thing. Love everyone but do  not depend upon the love of any one. Give everything. Take nothing.  Serve every one. Do not care for service and gratitude in return. You  are the Heir to the Infinite. All Power is behind you. But so long as  you are a beggar, a beggar shall you remain. Renounce the lower self,  Live for the Higher. What you call Universal Love is the expression  on the lower plane of the subjective reception of ABSOLUTE UNITY  on the Buddhic plane and in SAMADHI (Final Illumination).          LESSONS III AND IV.    THE YOGI SELF-DEVELOPER      INTRODUCTION.    In lessons 1 and 2 we have initiated you into the mysteries of Will  and Mind-Force, the governing principles of the Universe and the laws  of their development. We have also taught you how to acquire absolute  control over Body and Mind. In these lessons we have striven to point  out to you the right \"Mental Attitude\" towards your daily life, so that  while mainly engaged in the task of Self-Culture you might also lend a  hand in the great work of strengthening the race. Moreover our  convictions, beliefs, and ideals are no mean, insignificant factors  in the determination of our health and environmental conditions. They  react on our circumstances as well as on the WHOLE MAN. We have also  given you important points of instruction in Soul Unfoldment, Meditation,  Bramhacharya, Breathing, Fasting, Health-Culture, Body building  and shown you, as distinctly as we could, the exact process of developing  a single virtue in your self thereby you may master the process and  method of developing other virtues, the lines of action and thought being  well nigh similar in all, and foculising at certain common points of  primary importance. We have given the bare body of truth in connection  with the development, evolution and unfoldment of the body and the  soul, stripping of the metaphysical trappings and the theoretical  draperies in which they are clothed. We have had to literally rend  asunder the heavy wheel that had the divine face of truth. Hence our  lessons are brief and to the point. We have had to contend against and  overcome another serious difficulty. Expressed in the matter of fact  English language, these wondrous truths of mysticism cannot but lose the  air of profound solemnity and sanctity that pervades the subject of Yoga  in Sanskrit literature. The wise and thoughtful student and we certainly  do not write for light-headed and non-serious people, will not let their  apparent simplicity deceive him or throw him off his guard. Rather  let him realise that these lessons can be pressed into service in all  directions and in all spheres of life. Let him just put them into  practice and he will at once see their practical bearing on his daily  life. These lessons do not go into the \"WHAT\" but point out the \"HOW\" of  every thing. We leave every student to suit his individual case as to the  intellectual side of the ETERNAL PROBLEM. In conclusion we have to  say that this Course does not pretend to deal with the advanced stages  of Yoga, much less exhaust them. But they will, positively and decidedly  prepare him for those higher things by lifting the PALL OF DARKNESS  from his mind.          LESSONS III AND IV.      Quite a number of you there must be to whom the \"Fearless\" mind is not  only an enviable possession but something to which you are and have been  an utter stranger. You may not say it to others--confession may hurt your  pride--but secretly away deep in your heart, there resides strongly and  fiercely the desire to be a Fearless Individual. And it is a worthy  desire. To be able to wipe off all fearfulness, anxiety and worry from  your mental tablets is no easy task, but when once accomplished, it gives  you a glimpse of Heavenly Joy and Superhuman Strength. And, _You can be  Fearless_, I tell you--each one of you--you can be what you will to be. I  have seen it. I have done it. I am going to give you sound and positive  instructions in this paper so that you may forge ahead towards your goal.  These instructions are based upon good psychological grounds, have been  tested and proved by millions and proved a blessing to whoever took them  up in all earnestness and gave them a trial. If you want to be Fearless,  hesitate not to follow them to the very letter.    I shall not waste space telling you about the dire results of fear,  cowardice, worry, anxiety and the vile brood of negative thoughts  branching of FEAR. Physically, mentally and spiritually man is what he  thinks in his heart. As you think, so you are. Mind governs everything,  creates or destroys everything, on the physical as well as other planes.  Your thoughts affect your health, your circumstances, your environments;  those who come into daily contact with you, those who are separated  from you by space, those who are what you call \"dead\" but who are really  alive in spirit-life and bound to you more or less by mystic chords of  sympathy in thought and soul-life, affecting you and being affected by  you every minute. The range of influence exerted by a man's daily  thoughts is simply tremendous. Trees and animals, minerals and other  objects of material life absorb it. The walls of your room, the clothes  you wear, the letters you write are all being impressed by the aura of  your thought-force. If you go to a clairvoyant or a psychometerist  and put into his hands a letter, a lock of hair, a cloth-piece, or  anything else pertaining to one of your friends, he or she will  psychically trace out the personal appearance, temperament, past and  present history, and everything else in connection with that person.  Marvellous, 'Impossible' you cry in surprise. But it is done. Realise  through study and investigation the importance of your thought-life and  avoid vitiating it by fear-thoughts, hate-thoughts, sensual and sensuous  thoughts and vanity thoughts. Because, mark you, these four giant-weeds  poison the roots of the Tree of Life. All humanity suffers pain in  diverse ways, on account of these four bad thoughts and their millions of  off-springs. Now you will say this is all very well but:    HOW?    That is just what I mean to teach you all along. I don't want to feed you  on mere empty theories, but I can and I will give you that knowledge  which when assimilated shall build up strong flesh, bone, muscle, tissue,  pith and marrow which will give you superb health, strength of mind and  spirit--all of which are necessary adjuncts to Spiritual Growth and  Happiness. Let me give you in detail methods and exercises. The ideal  fearless man has many qualities. I say the Ideal Hero--no imitation patch  work vulgarian. These qualities are in rough detail: (1) Devotion to God.  (2) Knowledge. (3) Concentration. (4) Will Power. (5) Energy and  Aspiration. (6) Health. (7) Self-Esteem. (8) Self-Control. (9) Love for  Humanity. (10) Chastity. There may be other qualities but you will do  well to build up the above and others will come to you by themselves. Let  me drop a few helpful suggestions on the above. Follow each sentence  closely.    1. DEVOTION TO THE ABSOLUTE WILL.    I have always said, written, observed and felt that the most courageous  individuals are devoted to God. Such men are rare. You all understand the  meaning of \"Fearlessness\" in its fullest sense. It means absolute  independence--in two words, he is the FEARLESS man who \"fears-nothing,\"  and \"faces-everything.\" That everything includes everyone. That nothing  excludes no one. Viewed from this standpoint is not the fearless man  rarely to be met with? You may come across degrees of fearlessness. Now  the man who possesses this quality in the \"highest"]]]
