BAYNES, THOMAS SPENCER (1823-1887).--Philosopher, _s._ of a Baptist  minister, _b._ at Wellington, Somerset, intended to study for Baptist  ministry, and was at a theological seminary at Bath with that view, but  being strongly attracted to philosophical studies, left it and went to  Edin., when he became the favourite pupil of Sir W. Hamilton (_q.v._), of  whose philosophical system he continued an adherent. After working as ed.  of a newspaper in Edinburgh, and after an interval of rest rendered  necessary by a breakdown in health, he resumed journalistic work in 1858  as assistant ed. of the _Daily News_. In 1864 he was appointed Prof. of  Logic and English Literature at St. Andrews, in which capacity his mind  was drawn to the study of Shakespeare, and he contributed to the  _Edinburgh Review_ and _Fraser's Magazine_ valuable papers (chiefly  relating to his vocabulary and the extent of his learning) afterwards  collected as _Shakespeare Studies_. In 1873 he was appointed to  superintend the ninth ed. of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, in which,  after 1880, he was assisted by W. Robertson Smith (_q.v._).      BAXTER, RICHARD (1615-1691).--Divine scholar and controversialist, was  _b._ of poor, but genteel, parents at Rowton in Shropshire, and although  he became so eminent for learning, was not _ed._ at any university.  Circumstances led to his turning his attention to a career at court under  the patronage of the Master of the Revels, but a short experience of this  sufficed; and giving himself to the Christian ministry, he was ordained  in 1638, and, after being master of a school at Dudley, exercised his  ministry successively at Bridgnorth and Kidderminster. His learning and  capacity for business made him the leader of the Presbyterian party. He  was one of the greatest preachers of his own day, and consistently  endeavoured to exert a moderating influence, with the result that he  became the object of attack by extremists of opposing views. Though  siding with the Parliament in the Civil War, he opposed the execution of  the King and the assumption of supreme power by Cromwell. During the war  he served with the army as a chaplain. On the return of Charles II., B.  was made one of his chaplains, and was offered the see of Hereford, which  he declined, and his subsequent request to be allowed to return to  Kidderminster was refused. He subsequently suffered persecution at the  hands of Judge Jeffreys. After the Revolution he had a few years of peace  and quiet. His literary activity was marvellous in spite of ill-health  and outward disturbance. He is said to have written 168 works, the best  known of which are _The Saints' Everlasting Rest_ (1650), and _Call to  the Unconverted_ (1657), manuals of practical religion; and, among his  controversial writings, _Methodus Theologiae_ (1681), and _Catholic  Theology_ (1675), in which his theological standpoint--a compromise  between Arminianism and Calvinism--is set forth. Dr. Isaac Barrow says  that \"his practical writings were never mended, and his controversial  seldom confuted,\" and Dean Stanley calls him \"the chief English  Protestant schoolman.\" B. left an autobiography, _Reliquiae Baxterianae_,  which was a favourite book with both Johnson and Coleridge. Other works  by him are _The Life of Faith_ (1670), _Reasons of the Christian  Religion_ (1672), and _Christian Directory_ (1675). _Practical Works_ in  23 vols. (1830) edited with memoirs by W. Orme, also _Lives_ by A.B.  Grosart (1879), Dean Boyle (1883), and J.H. Davies (1886).      BAYLY, ADA ELLEN (_d._ 1903).--Novelist, wrote several stories under the  name of \"Edna Lyall,\" which were very popular. They include  _Autobiography of a Slander_, _Donovan_, _Hope the Hermit_, _In the  Golden Days_, _To Right the Wrong_, _We Two_, and _Won by Waiting_.      BAYLY, THOMAS HAYNES (1797-1839).--Miscellaneous writer, _s._ of a  wealthy lawyer in Bath. Originally intended for the law, he changed his  mind and thought of entering the Church, but abandoned this idea also,  and gave himself to writing for the stage and the periodical press. He is  chiefly known for his songs, of which he wrote hundreds, which, set to  the music of Bishop and other eminent composers, found universal  acceptance. Some were set to his own music. He also wrote several novels  and a number of farces, etc. Although making a large income from his  writings, in addition to that of his wife, he fell into embarrassed  circumstances. Among the best known of his songs are _I'd be a  Butterfly_, _Oh, no, we never mention Her_, and _She wore a Wreath of  Roses_. He may be regarded as, excepting Moore, the most popular song  writer of his time.      BEACONSFIELD, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, 1ST EARL of (1804-1881).--Statesman and  novelist, was the _s._ of Isaac D. (_q.v._). Belonging to a Jewish family  settled first in Spain, whence in the 15th century they migrated to  Italy, he was _b._ in London in 1804 and privately _ed._ His _f._  destined him for the law, and he was articled to a solicitor. The law  was, however, uncongenial, and he had already begun to write. After some  journalistic work, he brought himself into general notice by the  publication, in 1827, of his first novel, _Vivian Grey_, which created a  sensation by its brilliance, audacity, and slightly veiled portraits of  living celebrities. After producing a _Vindication of the British  Constitution_, and some political pamphlets, he followed up his first  success by a series of novels, _The Young Duke_ (1831), _Contarini  Fleming_ (1832), _Alroy_ (1833), _Venetia and Henrietta Temple_ (1837).  During the same period he had also written _The Revolutionary Epic_ and  three burlesques, _Ixion_, _The Infernal Marriage_, and _Popanilla_.  These works had gained for him a brilliant, if not universally admitted,  place in literature. But his ambition was by no means confined to  literary achievement; he aimed also at fame as a man of action. After  various unsuccessful attempts to enter Parliament, in which he stood,  first as a Radical, and then as a Tory, he was in 1837 returned for  Maidstone, having for his colleague Mr. Wyndham Lewis, whose widow he  afterwards married. For some years after entering on his political  career, D. ceased to write, and devoted his energies to parliamentary  work. His first speech was a total failure, being received with shouts of  laughter, but with characteristic courage and perseverance he pursued his  course, gradually rose to a commanding position in parliament and in the  country, became leader of his party, was thrice Chancellor of the  Exchequer, 1852, 1858-59, and 1866-68, in which last year he became Prime  Minister, which office he again held from 1874 till 1880. To return to  his literary career, in 1844 he had _pub._ _Coningsby_, followed by  _Sybil_ (1845), and _Tancred_ (1847), and in 1848 he wrote a life of Lord  G. Bentinck, his predecessor in the leadership of the Protectionist  party. His last novels were _Lothair_ (1870), and _Endymion_ (1880). He  was raised to the peerage as Earl of Beaconsfield in 1876, and was a  Knight of the Garter. In his later years he was the intimate friend as  well as the trusted minister of Queen Victoria. The career of D. is one  of the most remarkable in English history. With no family or political  influence, and with some personal characteristics, and the then current  prejudices in regard to his race to contend with, he rose by sheer force  of will and intellect to the highest honours attainable in this country.  His most marked qualities were an almost infinite patience and  perseverance, indomitable courage, a certain spaciousness of mind, and  depth of penetration, and an absolute confidence in his own abilities,  aided by great powers of debate rising occasionally to eloquence. Though  the object, first of a kind of contemptuous dislike, then of an intense  opposition, he rose to be universally regarded as, at all events, a great  political force, and by a large part of the nation as a great statesman.  As a writer he is generally interesting, and his books teem with striking  thoughts, shrewd maxims, and brilliant phrases which stick in the memory.  On the other hand he is often artificial, extravagant, and turgid, and  his ultimate literary position is difficult to forecast.    _Lives_ by Froude (1890), Hitchman (1885), see also _Dictionary of Nat.  Biog. etc._      BEATTIE, JAMES (1735-1803).--Poet and philosophical writer, _s._ of a  shopkeeper and small farmer at Laurencekirk, Kincardineshire, and _ed._  at Aberdeen; he was, in 1760, appointed Professor of Moral Philosophy  there. In the following year he _pub._ a vol. of poems, which attracted  attention. The two works, however, which brought him most fame were: (1)  his _Essay on Truth_ (1770), intended as an answer to Hume, which had  great immediate success, and led to an introduction to the King, a  pension of L200, and the degree of LL.D. from Oxford; and (2) his poem of  _The Minstrel_, of which the first book was _pub._ in 1771 and the  second in 1774, and which constitutes his true title to remembrance. It  contains much beautiful descriptive writing. The _Essay on Truth_ and his  other philosophical works are now forgotten. B. underwent much domestic  sorrow in the death of his wife and two promising sons, which broke down  his own health and spirits.      BEAUMONT, FRANCIS (1584-1616), AND FLETCHER, JOHN (1579-1625).--Poets and  dramatists. As they are indissolubly associated in the history of English  literature, it is convenient to treat of them in one place. B. was the  _s._ of Francis B., a Judge of the Common Pleas, and was _b._ at the  family seat, Grace Dieu, Leicestershire. He was _ed._ at Oxford, but his  _f._ dying in 1598, he left without taking his degree. He went to London  and entered the Inner Temple in 1600, and soon became acquainted with Ben  Jonson, Drayton, and other poets and dramatists.

By virtue of a royal warrant  Machim was incarcerated for his presumption; and, on his release,  endured the bitter mortification of learning that Anna had been  forcibly married to a noble, who carried her to his castle, near  Bristol. A friend of Machim's had the address to introduce himself to  the family, and became the groom of broken-hearted Anna, who was thus  persuaded and enabled to escape on board a vessel with her lover, with  the view of ending her days with him in France. In their hurry and  alarm they embarked without the pilot, and the season of the year  being the most unfavorable, were soon at the mercy of a dreadful  storm. The desired port was missed during the night, and the vessel  driven out to sea. After twelve days of suffering they discovered  faint traces of land in the horizon, and succeeded in making the spot  still called Machico. The exhausted Anna was conveyed on shore, and  Machim had spent three days in exploring in the neighborhood with  his friends, when the vessel, which they had left in charge of the  mariners, broke from her moorings in a storm and was wrecked on the  coast of Morocco, where the crew were made slaves. Anna became dumb  with sorrow, and expired three days after. Machim survived her but  five days, enjoining his companions to bury him in the same grave,  under the venerable cedar, where they had a few days before erected  a cross in acknowledgment of their happy deliverance. An inscription,  composed by Machim, was carved on the cross, with the request that the  next Christian who might chance to visit the spot would erect a church  there. Having performed this last sad duty, the survivors fitted out  the boat, which they had drawn ashore on their landing, and putting to  sea in the hope of reaching some part of Europe, were also driven on  the coast of Morocco, and rejoined their companions, but in slavery.  Zargo, during an expedition of discovery to the coast of Africa,  took a Spanish vessel with redeemed captives, amongst whom was an  experienced pilot, named Morales, who entered into the service  of Zargo, and gave him an account of the adventures of Machim, as  communicated to him by the English captives, and of the landmarks and  situations of the newly-discovered island.--_Madeira, by Dr. Mason_.           *       *       *       *       *    Centenary Performances in commemoration of the death-day of John  Sebastian Bach--the 28th of July--are this week to be held at Leipsic,  (where an assemblage of two thousand executants is to be convened  for the display of some of the masters greatest works,) at Berlin, at  Magdeburg, at Hamburg, and at other towns in North Germany.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM THE LEADER.]    POETS IN PARLIAMENT.    The prominence which the \"winged words\" of Victor Hugo have recently  given him in the Assembly has called forth sarcastic insinuations and  bitter diatribes from all the Conservative journals. There seems to  be an intensity of exasperation, arising from the ancient prejudice  against poets. A poet treating of politics! Let him keep to  rhymes, and leave the serious business of life to us practical men,  sober-minded men--men not led away by our imaginations--men not moved  to absurdities by sentiment--solid, sensible, moderate men! Let him  play with capricious hand on the chords which are resonant to his  will; but let him not mistake his frivolous accomplishment for the  power to play upon the world's great harp, drawing from its grander  chords the large responses of more solemn themes. Let him \"strike  the light guitar\" as long as women will listen, or fools applaud. But  politics is another sphere; into that he can only pass to make himself  ridiculous.    Thus reason the profound. Thus saith the good practical man, who,  because his mind is a congeries of commonplaces, piques himself on  not being led away by his imagination. The owl prides himself on the  incontestable fact that he is not an eagle.    To us the matter has another aspect. The appearance of Poets and men  of Sentiment in the world of Politics is a good symptom; for at a  time like the present, when positive doctrine can scarcely be said to  exist in embryo, and assuredly not in any maturity, the presence of  Imagination and Sentiment--prophets who endow the present with some  of the riches borrowed from the future--is needed to give grandeur  and generosity to political action, and to prevent men from entirely  sinking into the slough of egotism and routine. Salt is not meat,  but we need the salt to preserve meat from corruption. Lamartine and  Victor Hugo may not be profound statesmen; but they have at least  this one indispensable quality of statesmanship; they look beyond the  hour, and beyond the circle, they care more for the nation than for  \"measures;\" they have high aspirations and wide sympathies. Lamartine  in power committed many errors, but he also did great things, moved  thereto by his \"Imagination.\" He abolished capital punishment; and he  freed the slaves; had the whole Provisional Government been formed of  such men it would have been well for it and for France.    We are as distinctly aware of the unfitness of a poet for politics, as  any of those can be who rail at Hugo and Lamartine. Images, we know,  are not convictions; aspirations will not do the work; grand speeches  will not solve the problems. The poet is a \"phrasemaker\"; true; but  show us the man in these days who is more than a phrasemaker! Where is  he who has positive ideas beyond the small circle of his speciality?  In rejecting the guidance of the Poet to whom shall we apply? To  the Priest? He mumbles the litany of an ancient time which falls on  unbelieving ears. To the Lawyer? He is a metaphysician with precedents  for data. To the Litterateur? He is a phrasemaker by profession. To  the Politician? He cannot rise above the conception of a \"bill.\" One  and all are copious in phrases, empty of positive ideas as drums.  The initial laws of social science are still to be discovered and  accepted, yet we sneer at phrasemakers! Carlyle, who never sweeps out  of the circle of sentiment--whose eloquence is always indignation--who  thinks with his heart, has no words too scornful for phrasemakers and  poets; forgetting that he, and we, and they, are _all_ little more  than phrasemakers waiting for a doctrine!    There is something in the air of late which has called forth the poets  and made them politicians. Formerly they were content to leave these  troubled waters undisturbed, but finding that others now are as  ignorant as themselves, they have come forth to give at least the  benefit of their sentiment to the party they espouse. In no department  can phrasemaking prosper where positive ideas have once been attained.  Metaphors are powerless in astronomy; epithets are useless as  alembics; images, be they never so beautiful, will fail to convince  the physiologist. Language may adorn, it cannot create science. But as  soon as we pass from the sciences to social science, (or politics,) we  find that here the absence of positive ideas gives the phrasemaker the  same power of convincing, as in the early days of physical science was  possessed by metaphysicians and poets. Here the phrasemaker is king;  as the one-eyed is king in the empire of the blind. Phrasemaker for  phrasemaker, we prefer the poet to the politician; Victor Hugo to Leon  Faucher; Lamartine to Odilon Barrot; Lamennais to Baroche.    Kossuth, Mazzini, Lamartine, the three heroes of 1848, were all,  though with enormous differences in their relative values and  positions, men belonging to the race of poets--men in whom the  _heart_ thought--men who were moved by great impulses and lofty  aspirations--men who were \"carried away by their imagination\"--men who  were \"dreamers,\" but whose dreams were of the stuff of which our life  is made.           *       *       *       *       *    The fine immortal spirit of inspiration that is ever living in human  affairs, is unseen and incredible till its power becomes apparent  through the long past; as the invisible but indelible blue of the  atmosphere is not seen except we look through extended space.           *       *       *       *       *    The distinction between the sensual, frivolous many, and the few  spiritual and earnest, may be stated thus--the first vaguely guess the  others to be fools, _they_ know that the former are fools.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM THE NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE.]    FRANK HAMILTON; OR, THE CONFESSIONS OF AN ONLY SON.
