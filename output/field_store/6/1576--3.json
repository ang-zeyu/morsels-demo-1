The sensuality of the blacks is too well  known for us to be surprised, with such a state of things, at the  general and early demoralization.  In no other place did I ever  behold so many children with such pale and worn faces as in the  streets of Rio Janeiro.  The second cause of immorality here is,  without doubt, the want of religion.  The Brazils are thoroughly  Catholic--perhaps there are no countries save Spain and Italy, that  can be compared to them.  Almost every day there is some procession,  service, or church-festival; but these are attended merely for the  sake of amusement, while the true religious feeling is entirely  wanting.    We may also ascribe to this deep demoralization and want of religion  the frequent occurrence of murders, committed not for the sake of  robbery or theft, but from motives of revenge and hatred.  The  murderer either commits the deed himself, or has it perpetrated by  one of his slaves, who is ready to lend himself for the purpose, in  consideration of a mere trifle.  The discovery of the crime need  cause the assassin no anxiety, provided he is rich; for in this  country everything, I was assured, can be arranged or achieved with  money.  I saw several men in Rio Janeiro who had, according to  report, committed either themselves, or by the means of others, not  one, but several murders, and yet they not only enjoyed perfect  liberty, but were received in every society.    In conclusion, I beg leave to address a few words to those of my  countrymen who think of leaving their native land, to seek their  fortune on the distant coast of Brazil--a few words which I could  desire to see as far spread and as well known as possible.    There are people in Europe not a whit better than the African slave-  dealers, and such people are those who delude poor wretches with  exaggerated accounts of the richness of America and her beautiful  territories, of the over-abundance of the products of the soil, and  the lack of hands to take advantage of them.  These people, however,  care little about the poor dupes; their object is to freight the  vessels belonging to them, and to effect this they take from their  deluded victim the last penny he possesses.    During my stay here, several vessels arrived with unfortunate  emigrants of this description; the government had not sent for them,  and therefore would afford them no relief; money they had none, and,  consequently, could not purchase land, neither could they find  employment in working on the plantations, as no one will engage  Europeans for this purpose, because, being unused to the warm  climate, they would soon succumb beneath the work.  The unhappy  wretches had thus no resource left; they were obliged to beg about  the town, and, in the end, were fain to content themselves with the  most miserable occupations.  A different fate awaits those who are  sent for by the Brazilian government to cultivate the land or  colonize the country:  these persons receive a piece of uncleared  ground, with provisions and other help; but if they come over  without any money at all, even their lot is no enviable one.  Want,  hunger, and sickness destroy most of them, and but a very small  number succeed, by unceasing activity and an iron constitution, in  gaining a better means of livelihood than what they left behind them  in their native land.  Those only who exercise some trade find  speedy employment and an easy competency; but even this will, in all  probability, soon be otherwise, for great numbers are pouring in  ever year, and latterly the negroes themselves have been, and are  still being, more frequently taught every kind of trade.    Let every one, therefore, obtain trustworthy information before  leaving his native land; let him weigh calmly and deliberately the  step he is about to take, and not allow himself to be carried away  by deceptive hopes.  The poor creature's misery on being undeceived  is so much the more dreadful, because he does not learn the truth  until it is too late--until he has already fallen a victim to  poverty and want.        CHAPTER III.  EXCURSIONS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF RIO JANEIRO.        THE WATERFALLS NEAR TESCHUKA--BOA VISTA--THE BOTANICAL GARDENS AND  THEIR ENVIRONS--THE CORCOVADO MOUNTAINS, 2,253 FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL  OF THE SEA--PALACES OF THE IMPERIAL FAMILY--THE NEWLY-FOUNDED GERMAN  COLONY OF PETROPOLIS--ATTEMPT AT MURDER, BY A MARROON NEGRO.    An excursion to the waterfalls near Teschuka, to Boa Vista, and the  Botanical Gardens, is one of the most interesting near the city; but  it requires two days, as it takes a long time to see the Botanical  Gardens alone.    Count Berchthold and myself proceeded as far as Andaracky (four  miles) in an omnibus, and then continued our journey on foot,  between patches of wood and low hills.  Elegant country houses are  situated upon the eminences and along the high road, at short  distances from each other.    When we had walked four miles, a path to the right conducted us to a  small waterfall, neither very high nor well supplied, but still the  most considerable one in the vicinity of Rio Janeiro.  We then  returned to the high road, and in half an hour reached a little  elevated plain, whence the eye ranged over a valley of the most  remarkable description, one portion of it being in a state of wild  chaotic confusion, and the other resembling a blooming garden.  In  the former were strewed masses of broken granite, from which, in  some places, larger blocks reared their heads, like so many  Collossi; while in others large fragments of rocks lay towering one  above the other; in the second portion stood the finest fruit trees  in the midst of luxuriant pastures.  This romantic valley is  enclosed on three sides by noble mountains, the fourth being open,  and disclosing a full view of the sea.    In this valley we found a small venda, where we recruited ourselves  with bread and wine, and then continued our excursion to the so-  called \"Great Waterfall,\" with which we were less astonished than we  had been with the smaller one.  A very shallow sheet of water flowed  down over a broad but nowise precipitous ledge of rock into the  valley beneath.    After making our way through the valley, we came to the Porto  Massalu, where a number of trunks of trees, hollowed out and lying  before the few huts situated in the bay, apprized us that the  inhabitants were fishermen.  We hired one of these beautiful  conveyances to carry us across the little bay.  The passage did not  take more than a quarter of an hour at the most, and for this, as  strangers, we were compelled to pay two thousand reis (4s.).    We had now at one moment to wade through plains of sand, and the  next to clamber over the rocks by wretched paths.  In this laborious  fashion we proceeded for at least twelve miles, until we reached the  summit of a mountain, which rises like the party-wall of two mighty  valleys.  This peak is justly called the Boa Vista.  The view  extends over both valleys, with the mountain ranges and rows of  hills which intersect them, and embraces, among other high  mountains, the Corcovado and the \"Two Brothers;\" and, in the  distance, the capital, with the surrounding country-houses and  villages, the various bays and the open sea.    Unwillingly did we leave this beautiful position; but being  unacquainted with the distance we should have to go before reaching  some hospitable roof, we were obliged to hasten on; besides which  negroes are the only persons met with on these lonely roads, and a  rencontre with any of them by night is a thing not at all to be  desired.  We descended, therefore, into the valley, and resolved to  sleep at the first inn we came to.    More fortunate than most people in such cases, we not only found an  excellent hotel with clean rooms and good furniture, but fell in  with company which amused us in the highest degree.  It consisted of  a mulatto family, and attracted all my attention.  The wife, a  tolerably stout beauty of about thirty, was dressed out in a fashion  which, in my own country, no one, save a lady of an exceedingly  vulgar taste would ever think of adopting--all the valuables she  possessed in the world, she had got about her.  Wherever it was  possible to stick anything of gold or silver, there it was sure to  be.  A gown of heavy silk and a real cashmere enveloped her dark  brown body, and a charming little white silk bonnet looked very  comical placed upon her great heavy head.  The husband and five  children were worthy of their respective wife and mother; and, in  fact, this excess of dress extended even to the nurse, a real  unadulterated negress, who was also overloaded with ornaments.  On  one arm she had five and on the other six bracelets of stones,  pearls, and coral, but which, as far as I could judge, did not  strike me as being particularly genuine.    When the family rose to depart, two landaus, each with four horses,  drove up to the door, and man and wife, children and nurse, all  stepped in with the same majestic gravity.    As I was still looking after the carriages, which were rolling  rapidly towards the town, I saw some one on horseback nodding to me:  it was my friend, Herr Geiger.  On hearing that we intended to  remain for the night where we were, he persuaded us to accompany him  to the estate of his father-in-law, which was situated close at  hand.  In the latter gentleman, we made the acquaintance of a most  worthy and cheerful old man of seventy years of age, who, at that  period, was Directing Architect and Superintendant of the Fine Arts  under Government.  We admired his beautiful garden and charming  residence, built, with great good taste, in the Italian style.    Early on the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11074"],[0,"The Damned (#10)"],[1," deep within me, had been touched  into vile response, giving this flash of intuitive comprehension, I  cannot say. The coatings laid on by civilization are probably thin  enough in all of us. I made a supreme effort. The sun and wind came  back. I could almost swear I opened my eyes. Something very atrocious  surged back into the depths, carrying with it a thought of tangled  woods, of big stones standing in a circle, motionless, white figures,  the one form bound with ropes, and the ghastly gleam of the knife. Like  smoke upon a battlefield, it rolled away....    I was standing on the gravel path below the second terrace when the  familiar goblin garden danced back again, doubly grotesque now, doubly  mocking, yet, by way of contrast, almost welcome. My glimpse into the  depths was momentary, it seems, and had passed utterly away.    The common world rushed back with a sense of glad relief, yet ominous  now forever, I felt, for the knowledge of what its past had built upon.  In street, in theater, in the festivities of friends, in music-room or  playing field, even indeed in church--how could the memory of what I had  seen and felt leave its hideous trace? The very structure of my Thought,  it seemed to me, was stained.    What has been thought by others can never be obliterated until....    With a start my reverie broke and fled, scattered by a violent sound  that I recognized for the first time in my life as wholly desirable. The  returning motor meant that my hostess was back.    Yet, so urgent had been my temporary obsession, that my first  presentation of her was--well, not as I knew her now. Floating along  with a face of anguished torture I saw Mabel, a mere effigy captured by  others' thinking, pass down into those depths of fire and blood that  only just had closed beneath my feet. She dipped away. She vanished, her  fading eyes turned to the last towards some savior who had failed her.  And that strange intolerable hope was in her face.    The mystery of the place was pretty thick about me just then. It was the  fall of dusk, and the ghost of slanting sunshine was as unreal as though  badly painted. The garden stood at attention all about me. I cannot  explain it, but I can tell it, I think, exactly as it happened, for it  remains vivid in me forever--that, for the first time, something almost  happened, myself apparently the combining link through which it pressed  towards delivery:    I had already turned towards the house. In my mind were pictures--not  actual thoughts--of the motor, tea on the verandah, my sister, Mabel--  when there came behind me this tumultuous, awful rush--as I left the  garden. The ugliness, the pain, the striving to escape, the whole  negative and suppressed agony that was the Place, focused that second  into a concentrated effort to produce a result. It was a blinding  tempest of long-frustrate desire that heaved at me, surging appallingly  behind me like an anguished mob. I was in the act of crossing the  frontier into my normal self again, when it came, catching fearfully at  my skirts. I might use an entire dictionary of descriptive adjectives  yet come no nearer to it than this--the conception of a huge assemblage  determined to escape with me, or to snatch me back among themselves. My  legs trembled for an instant, and I caught my breath--then turned and  ran as fast as possible up the ugly terraces.    At the same instant, as though the clanging of an iron gate cut short  the unfinished phrase, I thought the beginning of an awful thing:    \"The Damned ...\"    Like this it rushed after me from that goblin garden that had sought to  keep me:    \"The Damned!\"    For there was sound in it. I know full well it was subjective, not  actually heard at all; yet somehow sound was in it--a great volume,  roaring and booming thunderously, far away, and below me. The sentence  dipped back into the depths that gave it birth, unfinished. Its  completion was prevented. As usual, nothing happened. But it drove  behind me like a hurricane as I ran towards the house, and the sound of  it I can only liken to those terrible undertones you may hear standing  beside Niagara. They lie behind the mere crash of the falling flood,  within it somehow, not audible to all--felt rather than definitely  heard.    It seemed to echo back from the surface of those sagging terraces as I  flew across their sloping ends, for it was somehow underneath them. It  was in the rustle of the wind that stirred the skirts of the drooping  wellingtonias. The beds of formal flowers passed it on to the creepers,  red as blood, that crept over the unsightly building. Into the structure  of the vulgar and forbidding house it sank away; The Towers took it  home. The uncomely doors and windows seemed almost like mouths that had  uttered the words themselves, and on the upper floors at that very  moment I saw two maids in the act of closing them again.    And on the verandah, as I arrived breathless, and shaken in my soul,  Frances and Mabel, standing by the tea table, looked up to greet me. In  the faces of both were clearly legible the signs of shock. They watched  me coming, yet so full of their own distress that they hardly noticed  the state in which I came. In the face of my hostess, however, I read  another and a bigger thing than in the face of Frances. Mabel knew. She  had experienced what I had experienced. She had heard that awful  sentence I had heard but heard it not for the first time; heard it,  moreover, I verily believe, complete and to its dreadful end.    \"Bill, did you hear that curious noise just now?\" Frances asked it  sharply before I could say a word. Her manner was confused; she looked  straight at me; and there was a tremor in her voice she could not hide.    \"There's wind about,\" I said, \"wind in the trees and sweeping round the  walls. It's risen rather suddenly.\" My voice faltered rather.    \"No. It wasn't wind,\" she insisted, with a significance meant for me  alone, but badly hidden. \"It was more like distant thunder, we thought.  How you ran too!\" she added. \"What a pace you came across the terraces!\"    I knew instantly from the way she said it that they both had already  heard the sound before and were anxious to know if I had heard it, and  how. My interpretation was what they sought.    \"It was a curiously deep sound, I admit. It may have been big guns at  sea,\" I suggested, \"forts or cruisers practicing. The coast isn't so  very far, and with the wind in the right direction--\"    The expression on Mabel's face stopped me dead.    \"Like huge doors closing,\" she said softly in her colorless voice,  \"enormous metal doors shutting against a mass of people clamoring to get  out.\" The gravity, the note of hopelessness in her tones, was shocking.    Frances had gone into the house the instant Mabel began to speak. \"I'm  cold,\" she had said; \"I think I'll get a shawl.\" Mabel and I were alone.  I believe it was the first time we had been really alone since I  arrived. She looked up from the teacups, fixing her pallid eyes on mine.  She had made a question of the sentence.    \"You hear it like that?\" I asked innocently. I purposely used the  present tense.    She changed her stare from one eye to the other; it was absolutely  expressionless. My sister's step sounded on the floor of the room behind  us.    \"If only--\" Mabel began, then stopped, and my own feelings leaping out  instinctively completed the sentence I felt was in her mind:    \"--something would happen.\"    She instantly corrected me. I had caught her thought, yet somehow  phrased it wrongly.    \"We could escape!\" She lowered her tone a little, saying it hurriedly.  The \"we\" amazed and horrified me; but something in her voice and manner  struck me utterly dumb. There was ice and terror in it. It was a dying  woman speaking--a lost and hopeless soul.    In that atrocious moment I hardly noticed what was said exactly, but I  remember that my sister returned with a grey shawl about her shoulders,  and that Mabel said, in her ordinary voice again, \"It is chilly, yes;  let's have tea inside,\" and that two maids, one of them the grenadier,  speedily carried the loaded trays into the morning-room and put a match  to the logs in the great open fireplace. It was, after all, foolish to  risk the sharp evening air, for dusk was falling steadily, and even the  sunshine of the day just fading could not turn autumn into summer. I was  the last to come in. Just as I left the verandah a large black bird  swooped down in front of me past the pillars; it dropped from overhead,  swerved abruptly to one side as it caught sight of me, and flapped  heavily towards the shrubberies on the left of the terraces, where it  disappeared into the gloom. It flew very low, very close. And it  startled me, I think because in some way it seemed like my Shadow  materialized--as though the dark horror that was rising everywhere from  house and garden, then settling back so thickly yet so imperceptibly  upon us all, were incarnated in that whirring creature that passed  between the daylight and the coming night.    I stood a moment, wondering if it would appear again, before I followed  the others indoors, and as I was in the act of closing the windows after  me, I caught a glimpse of a figure on the lawn. It was some distance  away, on the other side of the shrubberies, in fact where the bird had  vanished. But in spite of the twilight that half magnified, half  obscured it, the identity was unmistakable. I knew the housekeeper's  stiff walk too well to be deceived. \"Mrs. Marsh taking the air,\" I said  to myself. I felt the necessity of saying it, and I wondered why she was  doing so at this particular hour. If I had other thoughts they were so  vague, and so quickly and utterly suppressed, that I cannot recall them  sufficiently to relate them here.    And, once indoors, it was to be expected that there would come  explanation, discussion, conversation, at any"]]]
