MY ESCAPE FROM SLAVERY    RECONSTRUCTION          Douglass, Frederick.  \"My Escape from Slavery.\"    The Century Illustrated Magazine 23, n.s. 1 (Nov. 1881): 125-131.        MY ESCAPE FROM SLAVERY      In the first narrative of my experience in slavery, written nearly forty  years ago, and in various writings since, I have given the public what I  considered very good reasons for withholding the manner of my escape.  In  substance these reasons were, first, that such publication at any time  during the existence of slavery might be used by the master against the  slave, and prevent the future escape of any who might adopt the same  means that I did.  The second reason was, if possible, still more binding  to silence: the publication of details would certainly have put in peril  the persons and property of those who assisted.  Murder itself was not  more sternly and certainly punished in the State of Maryland than that of  aiding and abetting the escape of a slave.  Many colored men, for no  other crime than that of giving aid to a fugitive slave, have, like  Charles T. Torrey, perished in prison.  The abolition of slavery in my  native State and throughout the country, and the lapse of time, render  the caution hitherto observed no longer necessary.  But even since the  abolition of slavery, I have sometimes thought it well enough to baffle  curiosity by saying that while slavery existed there were good reasons  for not telling the manner of my escape, and since slavery had ceased to  exist, there was no reason for telling it.  I shall now, however, cease  to avail myself of this formula, and, as far as I can, endeavor to  satisfy this very natural curiosity.  I should, perhaps, have yielded to  that feeling sooner, had there been anything very heroic or thrilling in  the incidents connected with my escape, for I am sorry to say I have  nothing of that sort to tell; and yet the courage that could risk  betrayal and the bravery which was ready to encounter death, if need be,  in pursuit of freedom, were essential features in the undertaking.  My  success was due to address rather than courage, to good luck rather than  bravery.  My means of escape were provided for me by the very men who  were making laws to hold and bind me more securely in slavery.    It was the custom in the State of Maryland to require the free colored  people to have what were called free papers.  These instruments they were  required to renew very often, and by charging a fee for this writing,  considerable sums from time to time were collected by the State.  In  these papers the name, age, color, height, and form of the freeman were  described, together with any scars or other marks upon his person which  could assist in his identification.  This device in some measure defeated  itself--since more than one man could be found to answer the same general  description.  Hence many slaves could escape by personating the owner of  one set of papers; and this was often done as follows:  A slave, nearly  or sufficiently answering the description set forth in the papers, would  borrow or hire them till by means of them he could escape to a free  State, and then, by mail or otherwise, would return them to the owner.  The operation was a hazardous one for the lender as well as for the  borrower.  A failure on the part of the fugitive to send back the papers  would imperil his benefactor, and the discovery of the papers in  possession of the wrong man would imperil both the fugitive and his  friend.  It was, therefore, an act of supreme trust on the part of a  freeman of color thus to put in jeopardy his own liberty that another  might be free.  It was, however, not unfrequently bravely done, and was  seldom discovered.  I was not so fortunate as to resemble any of my free  acquaintances sufficiently to answer the description of their papers.  But I had a friend--a sailor--who owned a sailor's protection, which  answered somewhat the purpose of free papers--describing his person, and  certifying to the fact that he was a free American sailor.  The  instrument had at its head the American eagle, which gave it the  appearance at once of an authorized document.  This protection, when in  my hands, did not describe its bearer very accurately.  Indeed, it called  for a man much darker than myself, and close examination of it would have  caused my arrest at the start.    In order to avoid this fatal scrutiny on the part of railroad officials,  I arranged with Isaac Rolls, a Baltimore hackman, to bring my baggage to  the Philadelphia train just on the moment of starting, and jumped upon  the car myself when the train was in motion.  Had I gone into the station  and offered to purchase a ticket, I should have been instantly and  carefully examined, and undoubtedly arrested.  In choosing this plan I  considered the jostle of the train, and the natural haste of the  conductor, in a train crowded with passengers, and relied upon my skill  and address in playing the sailor, as described in my protection, to do  the rest.  One element in my favor was the kind feeling which prevailed  in Baltimore and other sea-ports at the time, toward \"those who go down  to the sea in ships.\"  \"Free trade and sailors' rights\" just then  expressed the sentiment of the country.  In my clothing I was rigged out  in sailor style.  I had on a red shirt and a tarpaulin hat, and a black  cravat tied in sailor fashion carelessly and loosely about my neck.  My  knowledge of ships and sailor's talk came much to my assistance, for I  knew a ship from stem to stern, and from keelson to cross-trees, and  could talk sailor like an \"old salt.\" I was well on the way to Havre de  Grace before the conductor came into the negro car to collect tickets and  examine the papers of his black passengers.  This was a critical moment  in the drama.  My whole future depended upon the decision of this  conductor.  Agitated though I was while this ceremony was proceeding,  still, externally, at least, I was apparently calm and self-possessed.  He went on with his duty--examining several colored passengers before  reaching me. He was somewhat harsh in tome and peremptory in manner until  he reached me, when, strange enough, and to my surprise and relief, his  whole manner changed.  Seeing that I did not readily produce my free  papers, as the other colored persons in the car had done, he said to me,  in friendly contrast with his bearing toward the others:    \"I suppose you have your free papers?\"    To which I answered:    \"No sir; I never carry my free papers to sea with me.\"    \"But you have something to show that you are a freeman, haven't you?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" I answered; \"I have a paper with the American Eagle on it,  and that will carry me around the world.\"    With this I drew from my deep sailor's pocket my seaman's protection, as  before described.  The merest glance at the paper satisfied him, and he  took my fare and went on about his business.  This moment of time was one  of the most anxious I ever experienced.  Had the conductor looked closely  at the paper, he could not have failed to discover that it called for a  very different-looking person from myself, and in that case it would have  been his duty to arrest me on the instant, and send me back to Baltimore  from the first station.  When he left me with the assurance that I was  all right, though much relieved, I realized that I was still in great  danger: I was still in Maryland, and subject to arrest at any moment.  I  saw on the train several persons who would have known me in any other  clothes, and I feared they might recognize me, even in my sailor \"rig,\"  and report me to the conductor, who would then subject me to a closer  examination, which I knew well would be fatal to me.    Though I was not a murderer fleeing from justice, I felt perhaps quite as  miserable as such a criminal.  The train was moving at a very high rate  of speed for that epoch of railroad travel, but to my anxious mind it was  moving far too slowly.  Minutes were hours, and hours were days during  this part of my flight.  After Maryland, I was to pass through  Delaware--another slave State, where slave-catchers generally awaited  their prey, for it was not in the interior of the State, but on its  borders, that these human hounds were most vigilant and active.  The  border lines between slavery and freedom were the dangerous ones for the  fugitives.  The heart of no fox or deer, with hungry hounds on his trail  in full chase, could have beaten more anxiously or noisily than did mine  from the time I left Baltimore till I reached Philadelphia.  The passage  of the Susquehanna River at Havre de Grace was at that time made by  ferry-boat, on board of which I met a young colored man by the name of  Nichols, who came very near betraying me.  He was a \"hand\" on the boat,  but, instead of minding his business, he insisted upon knowing me, and  asking me dangerous questions as to where I was going, when I was coming  back, etc.  I got away from my old and inconvenient acquaintance as soon  as I could decently do so, and went to another part of the boat.  Once  across the river, I encountered a new danger.  Only a few days before, I  had been at work on a revenue cutter, in Mr. Price's ship-yard in  Baltimore, under the care of Captain McGowan.  On the meeting at this  point of the two trains, the one going south stopped on the track just  opposite to the one going north, and it so happened that this Captain  McGowan sat at a window where he could see me very distinctly, and would  certainly have recognized me had he looked at me but for a second.

WAY OF THE LAWLESS    Max Brand    1921    Previous ed. published under title: Free Range          WAY OF THE LAWLESS          CHAPTER 1      Beside the rear window of the blacksmith shop Jasper Lanning held his  withered arms folded against his chest. With the dispassionate eye and  the aching heart of an artist he said to himself that his life work was  a failure. That life work was the young fellow who swung the sledge at  the forge, and truly it was a strange product for this seventy-year-old  veteran with his slant Oriental eyes and his narrow beard of white.  Andrew Lanning was not even his son, but it came about in this way that  Andrew became the life work of Jasper.    Fifteen years before, the father of Andy died, and Jasper rode out of  the mountain desert like a hawk dropping out of the pale-blue sky. He  buried his brother without a tear, and then sat down and looked at the  slender child who bore his name. Andy was a beautiful boy. He had the  black hair and eyes, the well-made jaw, and the bone of the Lannings,  and if his mouth was rather soft and girlish he laid the failing to the  weakness of childhood. Jasper had no sympathy for tenderness in men. His  own life was as littered with hard deeds as the side of a mountain with  boulders. But the black, bright eyes and the well-made jaw of little  Andy laid hold on him, and he said to himself: \"I'm fifty-five. I'm  about through with my saddle days. I'll settle down and turn out one  piece of work that'll last after I'm gone, and last with my signature  on it!\"    That was fifteen years ago. And for fifteen years he had labored to make  Andy a man according to a grim pattern which was known in the Lanning  clan, and elsewhere in the mountain desert. His program was as simple as  the curriculum of a Persian youth. On the whole, it was even simpler,  for Jasper concentrated on teaching the boy how to ride and shoot, and  was not at all particular that he should learn to speak the truth. But  on the first two and greatest articles of his creed, how Jasper labored!    For fifteen years he poured his heart without stint into his work! He  taught Andy to know a horse from hock to teeth, and to ride anything  that wore hair. He taught him to know a gun as if it were a sentient  thing. He taught him all the draws of old and new pattern, and labored  to give him both precision and speed. That was the work of fifteen  years, and now at the end of this time the old man knew that his life  work was a failure, for he had made the hand of Andrew Lanning cunning,  had given his muscles strength, but the heart beneath was wrong.    It was hard to see Andy at the first glance. A film of smoke shifted and  eddied through the shop, and Andy, working the bellows, was a black form  against the square of the door, a square filled by the blinding white of  the alkali dust in the road outside and the blinding white of the sun  above. Andy turned from the forge, bearing in his tongs a great bar of  iron black at the ends but white in the middle. The white place was  surrounded by a sparkling radiance. Andy caught up an eight-pound  hammer, and it rose and fell lightly in his hand. The sparks rushed  against the leather apron of the hammer wielder, and as the blows fell  rapid waves of light were thrown against the face of Andrew.    Looking at that face one wondered how the life work of Jasper was such  a failure. For Andy was a handsome fellow with his blue-black hair and  his black, rather slanting eyes, after the Lanning manner. Yet Jasper  saw, and his heart was sick. The face was a little too full; the square  bone of the chin was rounded with flesh; and, above all, the mouth had  never changed. It was the mouth of the child, soft--too womanly soft.  And Jasper blinked.    When he opened his eyes again the white place on the iron had become a  dull red, and the face of the blacksmith was again in shadow. All Jasper  could see was the body of Andy, and that was much better. Red light  glinted on the sinewy arms and the swaying shoulders, and the hammer  swayed and fell tirelessly. For fifteen years Jasper had consoled  himself with the strength of the boy, smooth as silk and as durable; the  light form which would not tire a horse, but swelled above the waist  into those formidable shoulders.    Now the bar was lifted from the anvil and plunged, hissing, into the  bucket beside the forge; above the bucket a cloud of steam rose and  showed clearly against the brilliant square of the door, and the  peculiar scent which came from the iron went sharply to the nostrils of  Jasper. He got up as a horseman entered the shop. He came in a manner  that pleased Jasper. There was a rush of hoofbeats, a form darting  through the door, and in the midst of the shop the rider leaped out of  the saddle and the horse came to a halt with braced legs.    \"Hey, you!\" called the rider as he tossed the reins over the head of his  horse. \"Here's a hoss that needs iron on his feet. Fix him up. And look  here\"--he lifted a forefoot and showed the scales on the frog and sole  of the hoof--\"last time you shoed this hoss you done a sloppy job, son.  You left all this stuff hangin' on here. I want it trimmed off nice an'  neat. You hear?\"    The blacksmith shrugged his shoulders.    \"Spoils the hoof to put the knife on the sole, Buck,\" said the smith.  \"That peels off natural.\"    \"H'm,\" said Buck Heath. \"How old are you, son?\"    \"Oh, old enough,\" answered Andy cheerily. \"Old enough to know that this  exfoliation is entirely natural.\"    The big word stuck in the craw of Buck Heath, who brought his thick  eyebrows together. \"I've rid horses off and on come twenty-five years,\"  he declared, \"and I've rid 'em long enough to know how I want 'em shod.  This is my hoss, son, and you do it my way. That straight?\"    The eye of old Jasper in the rear of the shop grew dim with wistfulness  as he heard this talk. He knew Buck Heath; he knew his kind; in his day  he would have eaten a dozen men of such rough words and such mild deeds  as Buck. But searching the face of Andy, he saw no resentment. Merely a  quiet resignation.    \"Another thing,\" said Buck Heath, who seemed determined to press the  thing to a disagreeable point. \"I hear you don't fit your shoes on  hot. Well?\"    \"I never touch a hoof with hot iron,\" replied Andy. \"It's a rotten  practice.\"    \"Is it?\" said Buck Heath coldly. \"Well, son, you fit my hoss with hot  shoes or I'll know the reason why.\"    \"I've got to do the work my own way,\" protested Andy.    A spark of hope burned in the slant eyes of Jasper.    \"Otherwise I can go find another gent to do my shoein'?\" inquired Buck.    \"It looks that way,\" replied the blacksmith with a nod.    \"Well,\" said Buck, whose mildness of the last question had been merely  the cover for a bursting wrath that now sent his voice booming, \"maybe  you know a whole pile, boy--I hear Jasper has give you consid'able  education--but what you know is plumb wasted on me. Understand? As for  lookin' up another blacksmith, you ought to know they ain't another shop  in ten miles. You'll do this job, and you'll do it my way. Maybe you  got another way of thinkin'?\"    There was a little pause.    \"It's your horse,\" repeated Andy. \"I suppose I can do him your own way.\"    Old Jasper closed his eyes in silent agony. Looking again, he saw Buck  Heath grinning with contempt, and for a single moment Jasper touched his  gun. Then he remembered that he was seventy years old. \"Well, Buck?\" he  said, coming forward. For he felt that if this scene continued he would  go mad with shame.    There was a great change in Buck as he heard this voice, a marked  respect was in his manner as he turned to Jasper. \"Hello, Jas,\" he said.  \"I didn't know you was here.\"    \"Come over to the saloon, Buck, and have one on me,\" said Jasper. \"I  guess Andy'll have your hoss ready when we come back.\"    \"Speakin' personal,\" said Buck Heath with much heartiness, \"I don't pass  up no chances with no man, and particular if he's Jasper Lanning.\" He  hooked his arm through Jasper's elbow. \"Besides, that boy of yours has  got me all heated up. Where'd he learn them man-sized words, Jas?\"    All of which Andy heard, and he knew that Buck Heath intended him to  hear them. It made Andy frown, and for an instant he thought of calling  Buck back. But he did not call. Instead he imagined what would happen.  Buck would turn on his heel and stand, towering, in the door. He would  ask what Andy wanted. Andy chose the careful insult which he would throw  in Buck's face. He saw the blow given. He felt his own fist tingle as he  returned the effort with interest. He saw Buck tumble back over the  bucket of water.    By this time Andy was smiling gently to himself. His wrath had  dissolved, and he was humming pleasantly to himself as he began to pull  off the worn shoes of Buck's horse.          CHAPTER 2      Young Andrew Lanning lived in the small, hushed world of his own  thoughts. He neither loved nor hated the people around him. He simply  did not see them. His mother--it was from her that he inherited the  softer qualities of his mind and his face--had left him a little stock  of books. And though Andy was by no means a reader, he had at least  picked up that dangerous equipment of fiction which enables a man to  dodge reality and live in his dreams. Those dreams had as little as  possible to do with the daily routine of his life, and certainly the  handling of guns, which his uncle enforced upon him, was never a part of  the future as Andy saw it.    It was now the late afternoon; the alkali dust in the road was still in  a white light, but the temperature in the shop had dropped several  degrees. The horse of Buck Heath was shod, and Andy was laying his tools  away for the day when he heard the noise of an automobile with open  muffler coming down the street. He stepped to the door to watch,"]]]
