[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13797"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#10)"],[1," writing of contemporaries trained  among books, and with the faculty of speech more fully developed than  that of thought, seemed colorless and empty to one with--whom natural  objects and grandeurs were always present in such overpowering force.  Excluded by his social position from taking an active part in the  public events of the day, and repelled by the emptiness of the then  fashionable literature, he turned to private and humble life as  possessing at least a reality. But he thus withheld himself from  the contemplation of those great mental excitements which only great  public struggles can awaken. He contracted a habit of exaggerating the  importance of every-day incidents and emotions. He accustomed himself  to see in men and in social relations only what he was predetermined  to see there, and to impute to them a value and importance derived  mainly from his own self-will. Even his natural good taste contributed  to confirm him in his error. The two prevailing schools of literature  in England, at that time, were the trashy and mouthing writers who  adopted the sounding language of Johnson and Darwin, unenlivened  by the vigorous thought of either; and the \"dead-sea apes\" of  that inflated, sentimental, revolutionary style which Diderot had  unconsciously originated, and Kotzebue carried beyond the verge of  caricature. The right feeling and manly thought of Wordsworth were  disgusted by these shallow word-mongers, and he flew to the other  extreme. Under the influences--repulsive and attractive--we have thus  attempted to indicate, he adopted the theory that as much of grandeur  and profound emotion was to be found in mere domestic incidents and  feelings, as on the more conspicuous stage of public life; and that  a bald and naked simplicity of language was the perfection of style.  Singularly enough, he was confirmed in these notions by the very  writer of the day whose own natural genius, more than any of his  contemporaries, impelled him to revel in great, wild, supernatural  conceptions; and to give utterance to them in gorgeous language.  Coleridge was perhaps the only contemporary from whom Wordsworth ever  took an opinion; and that he did so from him, is mainly attributable  to the fact that Coleridge did little more than reproduce to him  his own notions, sometimes rectified by a subtler logic, but always  rendered more attractive by new and dazzling illustrations.    Fortunately it is out of the power of the most perverse theory to  spoil the true poet. The poems of Wordsworth must continue to charm  and elevate mankind, in defiance of his crotchets, just as Luther,  Henri Quatre, and other living impersonations of poetry do, despite  all quaint peculiarities of the attire, the customs, or the opinions  of their respective ages, with which they were imbued. The spirit of  truth and poetry redeems, ennobles, hallows, every external form in  which it may be lodged. We may \"pshaw\" and \"pooh\" at Harry Gill and  the Idiot Boy; but the deep and tremulous tenderness of sentiment,  the strong-winged flight of fancy, the excelling and unvarying purity,  which pervade all the writings of Wordsworth, and the exquisite melody  of his lyrical poems, must ever continue to attract and purify the  mind. The very excesses into which his one-sided theory betrayed him,  acted as a useful counter-agent to the prevailing bad taste of his  time.    The Prelude may take a permanent place as one of the most perfect of  his compositions. It has much of the fearless felicity of youth; and  its imagery has the sharp and vivid outline of ideas fresh from the  brain. The subject--the development of his own great powers--raises  him above that willful dallying with trivialties which repels us in  some of his other works. And there is real vitality in the theme,  both from our anxiety to know the course of such a mind, and from  the effect of an absorbing interest in himself excluding that languor  which sometimes seized him in his efforts to impart or attribute  interest to themes possessing little or none in themselves. Its mere  narrative, though often very homely, and dealing in too many words,  is often characterized also by elevated imagination, and always by  eloquence. The bustle of London life, the prosaic uncouthness of its  exterior, the earnest heart that beats beneath it, the details even of  its commonest amusements, from Bartholomew Fair to Sadler's Wells, are  portrayed with simple force and delicate discrimination; and for the  most part skillfully contrasted with the rural life of the poet's  native home. There are some truthful and powerful sketches of French  character and life, in the early revolutionary era. But above all,  as might have been anticipated, Wordsworth's heart revels in the  elementary beauty and grandeur of his mountain theme; while his  own simple history is traced with minute fidelity, and is full of  unflagging interest.    We have already adverted to the fact that this Prelude was but  the overture to a grander song which the poet has left, in a great  measure, unsung. Reverting to this consideration an important  fact seems to force itself upon our notice. The creative power of  Wordsworth would appear to have been paralyzed after the publication  of his Excursion. All his most finished works precede that period. His  later writings generally lack the strength and freshness which we find  in those of an earlier date. Some may attribute this to his want of  the stimulus which the necessity of writing for a livelihood imparts,  and in part they may be right; but this is not the whole secret. That  his isolation from the stirring contact of competition, that his utter  disregard of contemporary events, allowed his mind, which for perfect  health's sake requires constantly-renewed impulses from without, to  subside into comparative hebetude, there can be no doubt whatever.  But the main secret of the freezing up of his fountain of poetical  inspiration, we really take to have been his change of politics.  Wordsworth's muse was essentially liberal--one may say, Jacobinical.  That he was unconscious of any sordid motive for his change, we  sincerely believe; but as certainly his conforming was the result less  of reasonable conviction than of willfulness. It was by a determined  effort of his will that he brought himself, to believe in the  Church-and-State notions which he latterly promulgated. Hence the want  of definite views, and of a living interest, which characterizes all  his writings subsequent to that change, when compared with those of  an earlier time. It was Wordsworth's wayward fate to be patronized and  puffed into notice by the champions of old abuses, by the advocates  of the pedantry of Oxford, and by the maintainers of the despotism not  even of Pitt but of Castlereagh. It is already felt, however, that the  poet whom these men were mainly instrumental in bringing into notice,  will live in men's memories by exactly those of his writings most  powerful to undermine and overthrow their dull and faded bigotries.  Despite his own efforts, Wordsworth (as has been said of Napoleon) is  the child and champion of Jacobinism. Though clothed in ecclesiastical  formulas, his religion is little more than the simple worship of  nature; his noblest moral flights are struggles to emancipate himself  from conventional usage; and the strong ground of his thoughts, as of  his style, is nature stripped of the gauds with which the pupils of  courts and circles would bedeck and be-ribbon it. Even in the ranks of  our opponents Wordsworth has been laboring in our behalf.    It is in the record of his extra-academic life that the poet soars his  freest flight, in passages where we have a very echo of the emotions  of an emancipated worshiper of nature flying back to his loved  resorts. Apart from its poetic value, the book is a graphical and  interesting portraiture of the struggles of an ingenuous and impetuous  mind to arrive at a clear insight into its own interior constitution  and external relations, and to secure the composure of self-knowledge  and of equally adjusted aspirations. As a poem it is likely to  lay fast and enduring hold on pure and aspiring intellects, and to  strengthen the claim of Wordsworth to endure with his land's language.           *       *       *       *       *      THE MONUMENT TO SIR ROBERT PEEL.    A LETTER FROM WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR,    TO THE EDITOR OF THE 'EXAMINER.'    Now the fever hath somewhat subsided which came over the people from  the grave of Sir Robert Peel, there is room for a few observations on  his decease and on its consequences. All public writers, I believe,  have expatiated on his character, comparing him with others who,  within our times, have occupied the same position. My own opinion  has invariably been that he was the wisest of all our statesmen;  and certainly, though he found reason to change his sentiments and  his measures, he changed them honestly, well weighed, always from  conviction, and always for the better. He has been compared, and  seemingly in no spirit of hostility or derision, with a Castlereagh,  a Perceval, an Addington. a Canning. Only one of these is worthy of  notice, namely Canning, whose brilliancy made his shallowness less  visible, and whose graces, of style and elocution threw a vail over  his unsoundness and lubricity. Sir Robert Peel was no satirist or  epigrammatist: he was only a statesman in public life: only a virtuous  and friendly man in private. _Par negotiis, nee supra_. Walpole alone  possessed his talents for business. But neither Peel nor his family  was enriched from the spoils of his country; Walpole spent in building  and pictures more than double the value of his hereditary estate, and  left the quadruple to his descendants.    Dissimilar from Walpole, and from commoner and coarser men who  occupied the same office, Peel forbade that a name which he had  made illustrious should be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13821"],[0,"Tales of Wonder (#10)"],[1,"drunk. It stood to reason  they all had a glass or two then, except the man at the wheel; and  towards evening the man at the wheel could bear it no longer, and  seems to have had his glass like all the rest, for the ship's course  wobbled a bit and made a circle or two. Then all of a sudden she went  off south by east under full canvas till midnight, and never altered  her course. And at midnight she came to the wide wet courts of the  Temple in the Sea.    People who think that Mr. Smiles is drunk often make a great mistake. And  people are not the only ones that have made that mistake. Once a  ship made it, and a lot of ships. It's a mistake to think that old Bill  Smiles is drunk just because he can't move.    Midnight and moonlight and the Temple in the Sea Bill Smiles clearly  remembers, and all the derelicts in the world were there, the old  abandoned ships. The figureheads were nodding to themselves and  blinking at the image. The image was a woman of white marble on a  pedestal in the outer court of the Temple of the Sea: she was clearly  the love of all the man-deserted ships, or the goddess to whom they  prayed their heathen prayers. And as Bill Smiles was watching them,  the lips of the figureheads moved; they all began to pray. But all at  once their lips were closed with a snap when they saw that there were  men on the Sea-Fancy. They all came crowding up and nodded and nodded  and nodded to see if all were drunk, and that's when they made their  mistake about old Bill Smiles, although he couldn't move. They would  have given up the treasuries of the gulfs sooner than let men hear the  prayers they said or guess their love for the goddess. It is the  intimate secret of the sea.    The sailor paused. And, in my eagerness to hear what lyrical or  blasphemous thing those figureheads prayed by moonlight at midnight in  the sea to the woman of marble who was a goddess to ships, I pressed  on the sailor more of my Gorgondy wine that the gnomes so wickedly  brew.    I should never have done it; but there he was sitting silent while the  secret was almost mine. He took it moodily and drank a glass; and with  the other glasses that he had had he fell a prey to the villainy of  the gnomes who brew this unbridled wine to no good end. His body  leaned forward slowly, then fell on to the table, his face being  sideways and full of a wicked smile, and, saying very clearly the one  word, \"Hell,\" he became silent for ever with the secret he had from  the sea.            How Ali Came to the Black Country    Shooshan the barber went to Shep the maker of teeth to discuss the  state of England. They agreed that it was time to send for Ali.    So Shooshan stepped late that night from the little shop near Fleet  Street and made his way back again to his house in the ends of London  and sent at once the message that brought Ali.    And Ali came, mostly on foot, from the country of Persia, and it took  him a year to come; but when he came he was welcome.    And Shep told Ali what was the matter with England and Shooshan swore  that it was so, and Ali looking out of the window of the little shop  near Fleet Street beheld the ways of London and audibly blessed King  Solomon and his seal.    When Shep and Shooshan heard the names of King Solomon and his seal  both asked, as they had scarcely dared before, if Ali had it. Ali  patted a little bundle of silks that he drew from his inner raiment.  It was there.    Now concerning the movements and courses of the stars and the  influence on them of spirits of Earth and devils this age has been  rightly named by some The Second Age of Ignorance. But Ali knew. And  by watching nightly, for seven nights in Bagdad, the way of certain  stars he had found out the dwelling place of Him they Needed.    Guided by Ali all three set forth for the Midlands. And by the  reverence that was manifest in the faces of Shep and Shooshan towards  the person of Ali, some knew what Ali carried, while others said that  it was the tablets of the Law, others the name of God, and others that  he must have a lot of money about him. So they passed Slod and Apton.    And at last they came to the town for which Ali sought, that spot over  which he had seen the shy stars wheel and swerve away from their  orbits, being troubled. Verily when they came there were no stars,  though it was midnight. And Ali said that it was the appointed place.  In harems in Persia in the evening when the tales go round it is still  told how Ali and Shep and Shooshan came to the Black country.    When it was dawn they looked upon the country and saw how it was  without doubt the appointed place, even as Ali had said, for the earth  had been taken out of pits and burned and left lying in heaps, and  there were many factories, and they stood over the town and as it were  rejoiced. And with one voice Shep and Shooshan gave praise to Ali.    And Ali said that the great ones of the place must needs be gathered  together, and to this end Shep and Shooshan went into the town and  there spoke craftily. For they said that Ali had of his wisdom  contrived as it were a patent and a novelty which should greatly  benefit England. And when they heard how he sought nothing for his  novelty save only to benefit mankind they consented to speak with Ali  and see his novelty. And they came forth and met Ali.    And Ali spake and said unto them: \"O lords of this place; in the book  that all men know it is written how that a fisherman casting his net  into the sea drew up a bottle of brass, and when he took the stopper  from the bottle a dreadful genie of horrible aspect rose from the  bottle, as it were like a smoke, even to darkening the sky, whereat  the fisherman...\" And the great ones of that place said: \"We have  heard the story.\" And Ali said: \"What became of that genie after he  was safely thrown back into the sea is not properly spoken of by any  save those that pursue the study of demons and not with certainty by  any man, but that the stopper that bore the ineffable seal and bears  it to this day became separate from the bottle is among those things  that man may know.\" And when there was doubt among the great ones Ali  drew forth his bundle and one by one removed those many silks till the  seal stood revealed; and some of them knew it for the seal and others  knew it not.    And they looked curiously at it and listened to Ali, and Ali said:    \"Having heard how evil is the case of England, how a smoke has  darkened the country, and in places (as men say) the grass is black,  and how even yet your factories multiply, and haste and noise have  become such that men have no time for song, I have therefore come at  the bidding of my good friend Shooshan, barber of London, and of Shep,  a maker of teeth, to make things well with you.\"    And they said: \"But where is your patent and your novelty?\"    And Ali said: \"Have I not here the stopper and on it, as good men  know, the ineffable seal? Now I have learned in Persia how that your  trains that make the haste, and hurry men to and fro, and your  factories and the digging of your pits and all the things that are  evil are everyone of them caused and brought about by steam.\"    \"Is it not so?\" said Shooshan.    \"It is even so,\" said Shep.    \"Now it is clear,\" said Ali, \"that the chief devil that vexes England  and has done all this harm, who herds men into cities and will not let  them rest, is even the devil Steam.\"    Then the great ones would have rebuked him but one said: \"No, let us  hear him, perhaps his patent may improve on steam.\"    And to them hearkening Ali went on thus: \"O Lords of this place, let  there be made a bottle of strong steel, for I have no bottle with my  stopper, and this being done let all the factories, trains, digging of  pits, and all evil things soever that may be done by steam be stopped  for seven days, and the men that tend them shall go free, but the  steel bottle for my stopper I will leave open in a likely place. Now  that chief devil, Steam, finding no factories to enter into, nor no  trains, sirens nor pits prepared for him, and being curious and  accustomed to steel pots, will verily enter one night into the bottle  that you shall make for my stopper, and I shall spring forth from my  hiding with my stopper and fasten him down with the ineffable seal  which is the seal of King Solomon and deliver him up to you that you  cast him into the sea.\"    And the great ones answered Ali and they said: \"But what should we  gain if we lose our prosperity and be no longer rich?\"    And Ali said: \"When we have cast this devil into the sea there will  come back again the woods and ferns and all the beautiful things that  the world hath, the little leaping hares shall be seen at play, there  shall be music on the hills again, and at twilight ease and quiet and  after the twilight stars.\"    And \"Verily,\" said Shooshan, \"there shall be the dance again.\"    \"Aye,\" said Shep, \"there shall be the country dance.\"    But the great ones spake and said, denying Ali: \"We will make no such  bottle for your stopper nor stop our healthy factories or good trains,  nor cease from our digging of pits nor do anything that you desire,  for an interference with steam would strike at the roots of that  prosperity that you see so plentifully all around us.\"    Thus they dismissed Ali there and then from that place where the earth  was torn up and burnt, being taken out of pits, and where factories  blazed all night with a demoniac glare; and they dismissed with him  both Shooshan, the barber, and Shep, the maker of teeth: so that a  week later Ali started from Calais on his long walk back to Persia.    And all this happened thirty years ago, and Shep is an old man now and  Shooshan older, and many mouths have bit with the teeth of Shep (for  he has a knack of getting them back whenever his customers die), and  they have written again to Ali away in the country of Persia with  these"]]]
