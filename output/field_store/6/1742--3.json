I'd rather have rats than  cockroaches.\"    \"So would I,\" said Sara; \"I suppose you might make friends with a rat  in time, but I don't believe I should like to make friends with a  cockroach.\"    Sometimes Becky did not dare to spend more than a few minutes in the  bright, warm room, and when this was the case perhaps only a few words  could be exchanged, and a small purchase slipped into the old-fashioned  pocket Becky carried under her dress skirt, tied round her waist with a  band of tape.  The search for and discovery of satisfying things to eat  which could be packed into small compass, added a new interest to  Sara's existence.  When she drove or walked out, she used to look into  shop windows eagerly. The first time it occurred to her to bring home  two or three little meat pies, she felt that she had hit upon a  discovery. When she exhibited them, Becky's eyes quite sparkled.    \"Oh, miss!\" she murmured.  \"Them will be nice an' fillin.' It's  fillin'ness that's best.  Sponge cake's a 'evenly thing, but it melts  away like--if you understand, miss.  These'll just STAY in yer  stummick.\"    \"Well,\" hesitated Sara, \"I don't think it would be good if they stayed  always, but I do believe they will be satisfying.\"    They were satisfying--and so were beef sandwiches, bought at a  cook-shop--and so were rolls and Bologna sausage.  In time, Becky began  to lose her hungry, tired feeling, and the coal box did not seem so  unbearably heavy.    However heavy it was, and whatsoever the temper of the cook, and the  hardness of the work heaped upon her shoulders, she had always the  chance of the afternoon to look forward to--the chance that Miss Sara  would be able to be in her sitting room.  In fact, the mere seeing of  Miss Sara would have been enough without meat pies. If there was time  only for a few words, they were always friendly, merry words that put  heart into one; and if there was time for more, then there was an  installment of a story to be told, or some other thing one remembered  afterward and sometimes lay awake in one's bed in the attic to think  over.  Sara--who was only doing what she unconsciously liked better  than anything else, Nature having made her for a giver--had not the  least idea what she meant to poor Becky, and how wonderful a benefactor  she seemed. If Nature has made you for a giver, your hands are born  open, and so is your heart; and though there may be times when your  hands are empty, your heart is always full, and you can give things out  of that--warm things, kind things, sweet things--help and comfort and  laughter--and sometimes gay, kind laughter is the best help of all.    Becky had scarcely known what laughter was through all her poor, little  hard-driven life.  Sara made her laugh, and laughed with her; and,  though neither of them quite knew it, the laughter was as \"fillin'\" as  the meat pies.    A few weeks before Sara's eleventh birthday a letter came to her from  her father, which did not seem to be written in such boyish high  spirits as usual.  He was not very well, and was evidently overweighted  by the business connected with the diamond mines.    \"You see, little Sara,\" he wrote, \"your daddy is not a businessman at  all, and figures and documents bother him.  He does not really  understand them, and all this seems so enormous.  Perhaps, if I was not  feverish I should not be awake, tossing about, one half of the night  and spend the other half in troublesome dreams.  If my little missus  were here, I dare say she would give me some solemn, good advice.  You  would, wouldn't you, Little Missus?\"    One of his many jokes had been to call her his \"little missus\" because  she had such an old-fashioned air.    He had made wonderful preparations for her birthday.  Among other  things, a new doll had been ordered in Paris, and her wardrobe was to  be, indeed, a marvel of splendid perfection.  When she had replied to  the letter asking her if the doll would be an acceptable present, Sara  had been very quaint.    \"I am getting very old,\" she wrote; \"you see, I shall never live to  have another doll given me.  This will be my last doll. There is  something solemn about it.  If I could write poetry, I am sure a poem  about 'A Last Doll' would be very nice. But I cannot write poetry.  I  have tried, and it made me laugh. It did not sound like Watts or  Coleridge or Shakespeare at all. No one could ever take Emily's place,  but I should respect the Last Doll very much; and I am sure the school  would love it.  They all like dolls, though some of the big ones--the  almost fifteen ones--pretend they are too grown up.\"    Captain Crewe had a splitting headache when he read this letter in his  bungalow in India.  The table before him was heaped with papers and  letters which were alarming him and filling him with anxious dread, but  he laughed as he had not laughed for weeks.    \"Oh,\" he said, \"she's better fun every year she lives.  God grant this  business may right itself and leave me free to run home and see her.  What wouldn't I give to have her little arms round my neck this minute!  What WOULDN'T I give!\"    The birthday was to be celebrated by great festivities.  The schoolroom  was to be decorated, and there was to be a party.  The boxes containing  the presents were to be opened with great ceremony, and there was to be  a glittering feast spread in Miss Minchin's sacred room. When the day  arrived the whole house was in a whirl of excitement. How the morning  passed nobody quite knew, because there seemed such preparations to be  made.  The schoolroom was being decked with garlands of holly; the  desks had been moved away, and red covers had been put on the forms  which were arrayed round the room against the wall.    When Sara went into her sitting room in the morning, she found on the  table a small, dumpy package, tied up in a piece of brown paper. She  knew it was a present, and she thought she could guess whom it came  from.  She opened it quite tenderly.  It was a square pincushion, made  of not quite clean red flannel, and black pins had been stuck carefully  into it to form the words, \"Menny hapy returns.\"    \"Oh!\" cried Sara, with a warm feeling in her heart.  \"What pains she  has taken!  I like it so, it--it makes me feel sorrowful.\"    But the next moment she was mystified.  On the under side of the  pincushion was secured a card, bearing in neat letters the name \"Miss  Amelia Minchin.\"    Sara turned it over and over.    \"Miss Amelia!\" she said to herself \"How CAN it be!\"    And just at that very moment she heard the door being cautiously pushed  open and saw Becky peeping round it.    There was an affectionate, happy grin on her face, and she shuffled  forward and stood nervously pulling at her fingers.    \"Do yer like it, Miss Sara?\" she said.  \"Do yer?\"    \"Like it?\" cried Sara.  \"You darling Becky, you made it all yourself.\"    Becky gave a hysteric but joyful sniff, and her eyes looked quite moist  with delight.    \"It ain't nothin' but flannin, an' the flannin ain't new; but I wanted  to give yer somethin' an' I made it of nights. I knew yer could PRETEND  it was satin with diamond pins in. _I_ tried to when I was makin' it.  The card, miss,\" rather doubtfully; \"'t warn't wrong of me to pick it  up out o' the dust-bin, was it?  Miss 'Meliar had throwed it away.  I  hadn't no card o' my own, an' I knowed it wouldn't be a proper presink  if I didn't pin a card on--so I pinned Miss 'Meliar's.\"    Sara flew at her and hugged her.  She could not have told herself or  anyone else why there was a lump in her throat.    \"Oh, Becky!\" she cried out, with a queer little laugh, \"I love you,  Becky--I do, I do!\"    \"Oh, miss!\" breathed Becky.  \"Thank yer, miss, kindly; it ain't good  enough for that.  The--the flannin wasn't new.\"        7    The Diamond Mines Again      When Sara entered the holly-hung schoolroom in the afternoon, she did  so as the head of a sort of procession.  Miss Minchin, in her grandest  silk dress, led her by the hand.  A manservant followed, carrying the  box containing the Last Doll, a housemaid carried a second box, and  Becky brought up the rear, carrying a third and wearing a clean apron  and a new cap.  Sara would have much preferred to enter in the usual  way, but Miss Minchin had sent for her, and, after an interview in her  private sitting room, had expressed her wishes.    \"This is not an ordinary occasion,\" she said.  \"I do not desire that it  should be treated as one.\"    So Sara was led grandly in and felt shy when, on her entry, the big  girls stared at her and touched each other's elbows, and the little  ones began to squirm joyously in their seats.    \"Silence, young ladies!\" said Miss Minchin, at the murmur which arose.  \"James, place the box on the table and remove the lid.  Emma, put yours  upon a chair.  Becky!\" suddenly and severely.    Becky had quite forgotten herself in her excitement, and was grinning  at Lottie, who was wriggling with rapturous expectation. She almost  dropped her box, the disapproving voice so startled her, and her  frightened, bobbing curtsy of apology was so funny that Lavinia and  Jessie tittered.    \"It is not your place to look at the young ladies,\" said Miss Minchin.  \"You forget yourself.  Put your box down.\"    Becky obeyed with alarmed haste and hastily backed toward the door.    \"You may leave us,\" Miss Minchin announced to the servants with a wave  of her hand.    Becky stepped aside respectfully to allow the superior servants to pass  out first.  She could not help casting a longing glance at the box on  the table.  Something made of blue satin was peeping from between the  folds of tissue paper.    \"If you please, Miss Minchin,\" said Sara, suddenly, \"mayn't Becky stay?\"    It was a bold thing to do.
