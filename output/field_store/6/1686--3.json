You seemed to know him. What was he doing out here, watching my test?\"    \"Me tell,\" said the giant, simply. \"Little while after Master come back  from where him say big gun all go smash, man come to shop when Master  out one day. Him very nice man, and him say him know you, and want to  help you make big cannon. I say, 'Master no be at home.' Man say him  want to give master a little present of powder for use in new cannon.  Master be much pleased, man say.  Make powder better. I take, and I  want Master to be pleased. I put stuff what man gave me in new powder.  Man go away--he laugh--he say he be here today see what happen--I tell  him you go to make test today. Man say Master be much surprised. That  all I know.\"    Silence followed Koku's statement. To Ned and Mr. Damon it was not  exactly clear, but Tom better understood his giant servant's queer talk.    \"Is that what you mean, Koku?\" asked the young inventor, after a pause.  \"Did some stranger come here one day when I was out, after I had made  my new powder, and did he give you some 'dope' to put in it?\"    \"What you mean by 'dope'?\"    \"I mean any sort of stuff.\"    \"Yes, man give me something like sugar, and I sprinkle it on new powder  for to surprise Master.\"    \"Well, you've done it, all right,\" said Tom, grimly. \"Have you any of  the stuff left?\"    \"I put all in iron box where Master keep new powder.\"    \"Well, then some of it must be there yet. Probably it sifted through  the excelsior-like grains of my new explosive, and we'll find it on the  bottom of the powder-case. But enough stuck to the strands to spoil my  test. I'll just take a reading of the gauges, and then we'll make an  investigation.\"    Tom, with Ned to help him, made notes of how far the weight had risen  in the tube, and took data of other points in the experiment.    \"Pshaw!\" exclaimed Tom. \"There wasn't much more force to my new powder,  doped as it apparently has been, than to the stuff I can buy in the  open market. But I'm glad I know what the trouble is, for I can remedy  it. Come on back to the shop. Koku, don't you ever do anything like  this again,\" and Tom spoke severely.    \"No, Master,\" answered the giant, humbly.    \"Did you ever see this man before, Koku?\"    \"No, Master.\"    \"What kind of a fellow was he?\" asked Ned.    \"Oh, him got whiskers on him face, and stand very straight, like stick  bending backwards. Him look like a soldier, and him blink one eye more  than the other.\"    Tom and Ned started and looked at one another.    \"That description fits General Waller,\" said Ned, in a low voice to his  chum.    \"Yes, in a way; but it would be out of the question for the General to  do such a thing. Besides, the man who ran away, and escaped on his  motor-cycle, was larger than General Waller.\"    \"It was hard to tell just what size he was at the distance,\" spoke Ned.  \"It doesn't seem as though he would try to spoil your experiments,  though.\"    \"Maybe he hoped to spoil my cannon,\" remarked Tom, with a laugh that  had no mirth in it. \"My cannon that isn't cast yet. He probably  misunderstood Koku's story of the test, and had no idea it was only a  miniature, experimental, gun.    \"This will have to be looked into. I can't have strangers prowling  about here, now that I am going to get to work on a new invention.  Koku, I expect you, after this, not to let strangers approach unless I  give the word. Eradicate, the same thing applies to you. You didn't see  anything of this mysterious man; did you?\"    \"No, Massa 'Tom. De only s'picious man I see was mab own cousin  sneakin' around mah chicken coop de odder night. I tooks mah ole shot  gun, an' sa'ntered out dat way. Den in a little while dere wasn't no  s'picious man any mo'.\"    \"You didn't shoot him; did you, Rad?\" cried Tom, quickly.    \"No, Massa Tom--dat is, I didn't shoot on puppose laik. De gun jest  natchelly went off by itself accidental-laik, an' it peppered him good  an' proper.\"    \"Why, Rad!\" cried Ned. \"You didn't tell us about this.\"    \"Well, I were 'shamed ob mah cousin, so I was. Anyhow, I only had salt  an' pepper in de gun--'stid ob shot. I 'spect mah cousin am pretty well  seasoned now. But dat's de only s'picious folks I see, 'ceptin' maybe a  peddler what wanted t' gib me a dish pan fo' a pair ob ole shoes; only  I didn't hab any.\"    \"There are altogether too many strangers coming about here,\" went on  Tom. \"It must be stopped, if I have to string charged electric wires  about the shops as I once did.\"    They hurried back to the shop where the new powder was kept, and Tom at  once investigated it. Taking the steel box from where it was stored he  carefully removed the several handfuls of excelsior-like explosive. On  the bottom of the box, and with some of it clinging to some of the  powder threads, was a sort of white powder. It had a peculiar odor.    \"Ha!\" cried Tom, as soon as he saw it. \"I know what that is.  It's a  new form of gun-cotton, very powerful. Whoever gave it to Koku to put  on my powder hoped to blow to atoms any cannon in which it might be  used. There's enough here to do a lot of damage.\"    \"How is it that it didn't blow your test cylinder to bits?\" asked Ned.    \"For the reason that the stuff I use in my powder and this new  gun-cotton neutralized one another,\" the young inventor explained. \"One  weakened the other, instead of making a stronger combination. A  chemical change took place, and lucky for us it did. It was just like a  man taking an over-dose of poison--it defeated itself. That's why my  experiment was a failure. Now to put this stuff where it can do no  harm. Is this what that man gave you, Koku?\"    \"That's it, Master.\"    There came a tap on the door of the private room, and instinctively  everyone started. Then came the voice of Eradicate, saying:    \"Dere's a army gen'men out here to see you. Massa Tom; but I ain't  gwine t' let him in lessen as how you says so.\"    \"An army gentleman!\" repeated Tom.    \"Yais, sah! He say he General Waller, an' he come on a motor-cycle.\"    \"General Waller!\" exclaimed Tom. \"What can he want out here?\"    \"And on a motor-cycle, too!\" added Ned. \"Tom, what's going on, anyhow?\"    The young inventor shook his head.    \"I don't know,\" he replied; \"but I suppose I had better see him. Here,  Koku, put this powder away, and then go outside. Mr. Damon, you'll  stay; won't you?\"    \"If you need me, Tom. Bless my finger nails! But there seems to be  something wrong here.\"    \"Show him in, Rad!\" called Tom.    \"Massa Gen'l Herodotus Waller!\" exclaimed the colored man in pompous  tones, as he opened the door for the officer, clad in khaki, whom Tom  had last seen at Sandy Hook.    \"Ah, how do you do, Mr. Swift!\" exclaimed General Waller, extending his  hand. \"I got your letter inviting me to a test of your new explosive. I  hope I am not too late.\"    Tom stared at him in amazement.          CHAPTER XI    FAILURE AND SUCCESS      \"You--you got my letter!\" stammered Tom, holding out his hand for a  missive which the General extended. \"I--I don't exactly understand. My  letter?\"    \"Yes, certainly,\" went on the officer. \"It was very kind of you to  remember me after--well, to be perfectly frank with you, I did resent,  a little, your remarks about my unfortunate gun. But I see you are of a  forgiving spirit.\"    \"But I didn't write you any letter!\" exclaimed Tom, feeling more and  more puzzled.    \"You did not? What is this?\" and the General unfolded a paper.  Tom  glanced over it. Plainly it was a request for the General to be present  at the test on that day, and it was signed with Tom Swift's name.    But as soon as the young inventor saw it, he knew that it was a forgery.    \"I never sent that letter!\" he exclaimed. \"Look, it is not at all like  my handwriting,\" and he took up some papers from a near-by table and  quickly compared some of his writing with that in the letter. The  difference was obvious.    \"Then who did send it?\" asked General Waller. \"If someone has been  playing a joke on me it will not be well for him!\" and he drew himself  up pompously.    \"If a joke has been played--and it certainly seems so,\" spoke Tom, \"I  had no hand in it. And did you come all the way from Sandy Hook because  of this letter?\"    \"No, I am visiting friends in Waterford,\" said the officer, naming the  town where Mr. Damon lived. \"My cousin is Mr. Pierce Watkins.\"    \"Bless my doorbell!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, \"I know him! He lives just  around the corner from me. Bless my very thumb prints!\"    General Waller stared at Mr. Damon in some amazement, and resumed:    \"Owing to the unfortunate accident to my gun, and to some slight  injuries I sustained, I found my health somewhat impaired.  I obtained  a furlough, and came to visit my cousin. The doctor recommended open  air exercise, and so I brought with me my motor-cycle, as I am fond of  that means of locomotion.\"    \"I used to be,\" murmured Mr. Damon; \"but I gave it up.\"    \"After his machine climbed a tree,\" Tom explained, with a smile,  remembering how he had originally met Mr. Damon, and bought the damaged  machine from him, as told in the first volume of this series.    \"So, when I got your letter,\" continued the General, \"I naturally  jumped on my machine and came over. Now I find that it is all a hoax.\"    \"I am very sorry, I assure you,\" said Tom. \"We did have a sort of test  today; but it was a failure, owing to the fact that someone tampered  with my powder. From what you tell me, I am inclined to the belief that  the same person may have sent you that letter.

Nudity, he remarks, was a      Greek, not an Etruscan, characteristic. \"To the nudity of the      Spartan women I need but refer; the Thessalian women are      described by Persaeus dancing at banquets naked, or with a very      scanty covering (_apud_ Athenaeus, xiii, c. 86). The maidens of      Chios wrestled naked with the youths in the gymnasium, which      Athenaeus (xiii, 20) pronounces to be 'a beautiful sight.' And at      the marriage feast of Caranus, the Macedonian women tumblers      performed naked before the guests (Athenaeus, iv, 3).\" (G. Dennis,      _Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria_, 1883, vol. i, p. 321.)        In Rome, \"when there was at first much less freedom in this      matter than in Greece, the bath became common to both sexes, and      though each had its basin and hot room apart, they could see each      other, meet, speak, form intrigues, arrange meetings, and      multiply adulteries. At first, the baths were so dark that men      and women could wash side by side, without recognizing each other      except by the voice; but soon the light of day was allowed to      enter from every side. 'In the bath of Scipio,' said Seneca,      'there were narrow ventholes, rather than windows, hardly      admitting enough light to outrage modesty; but nowadays, baths      are called caves if they do not receive the sun's rays through      large windows.' ... Hadrian severely prohibited this mingling of      men and women, and ordained separate lavaera for the sexes.      Marcus Aurelius and Alexander Severus renewed this edict, but in      the interval, Heliogabalus had authorized the sexes to meet in      the baths.\" (Dufour, _Histoire de la Prostitution_, vol. ii, Ch.      XVIII; cf. Smith's _Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities_,      Art. Balneae.)        In Rome, according to ancient custom, actors were compelled to      wear drawers (_subligaculum_) on the stage, in order to safeguard      the modesty of Roman matrons. Respectable women, it seems, also      always wore some sort of _subligaculum_, even sometimes when      bathing. The name was also applied to a leathern girdle laced      behind, which they were occasionally made to wear as a girdle of      chastity. (Dufour, op. cit., vol. ii, p. 150.) Greek women also      wore a cloth round the loins when taking the bath, as did the men      who bathed there; and a woman is represented bathing and wearing      a sort of thin combinations reaching to the middle of the thigh.      (Smith's _Dictionary_, loc. cit.) At a later period, St.      Augustine refers to the _compestria_, the drawers or apron worn      by young men who stripped for exercise in the _campus_. (_De      Civitate Dei_, Bk. XIV, Ch. XVII.)        Lecky (_History of Morals_, vol. ii, p. 318), brings together      instances of women, in both Pagan and early Christian times, who      showed their modesty by drawing their garments around them, even      at the moment that they were being brutally killed. Plutarch, in      his essay on the \"Virtues of Women,\"--moralizing on the      well-known story of the young women of Milesia, among whom an      epidemic of suicide was only brought to an end by the decree that      in future women who hanged themselves should be carried naked      through the market-places,--observes: \"They, who had no dread of      the most terrible things in the world, death and pain, could not      abide the imagination of dishonor, and exposure to shame, even      after death.\"        In the second century the physician Aretaeus, writing at Rome,      remarks: \"In many cases, owing to involuntary restraint from      modesty at assemblies, and at banquets, the bladder becomes      distended, and from the consequent loss of its contractile power,      it no longer evacuates the urine.\" (_On the Causes and Symptoms      of Acute Diseases_, Book II, Chapter X.)        Apuleius, writing in the second century, says: \"Most women, in      order to exhibit their native gracefulness and allurements,      divest themselves of all their garments, and long to show their      naked beauty, being conscious that they shall please more by the      rosy redness of their skin than by the golden splendor of their      robes.\" (Thomas Taylor's translation of _Metamorphosis_, p. 28.)        Christianity seems to have profoundly affected habits of thought      and feeling by uniting together the merely natural emotion of      sexual reserve with, on the one hand, the masculine virtue of      modesty--_modestia_--and, on the other, the prescription of      sexual abstinence. Tertullian admirably illustrates this      confusion, and his treatises _De Pudicitia_ and _De Cultu      Feminarum_ are instructive from the present point of view. In the      latter he remarks (Book II, Chapter I): \"Salvation--and not of      women only, but likewise of men--consists in the exhibition,      principally, of modesty. Since we are all the temple of God,      modesty is the sacristan and priestess of that temple, who is to      suffer nothing unclean or profane to enter it, for fear that the      God who inhabits it should be offended.... Most women, either      from simple ignorance or from dissimulation, have the hardihood      so to walk as if modesty consisted only in the integrity of the      flesh, and in turning away from fornication, and there were no      need for anything else,--in dress and ornament, the studied      graces of form,--wearing in their gait the self-same appearance      as the women of the nations from whom the sense of _true_ modesty      is absent.\"        The earliest Christian ideal of modesty, not long maintained, is      well shown in an epistle which, there is some reason to suppose,      was written by Clement of Rome. \"And if we see it to be requisite      to stand and pray for the sake of the woman, and to speak words      of exhortation and edification, we call the brethren and all the      holy sisters and maidens, likewise all the other women who are      there, with all modesty and becoming behavior, to come and feast      on the truth. And those among us who are skilled in speaking,      speak to them, and exhort them in those words which God has given      us. And then we pray, and salute one another, the men the men.      But the women and the maidens will wrap their hands in their      garments; we also, with circumspection and with all purity, our      eyes looking upward, shall wrap our right hand in our garments;      and then they will come and give us the salutation on our right      hand, wrapped in our garments. Then we go where God permits us.\"      (_Two Epistles Concerning Virginity_; Second Epistle, Chapter      III, vol. xiv. Ante-Nicene Christian Library, p. 384.)        \"Women will scarce strip naked before their own husbands,      affecting a plausible pretense of modesty,\" writes Clement of      Alexandria, about the end of the second century, \"but any others      who wish may see them at home, shut up in their own baths, for      they are not ashamed to strip before spectators, as if exposing      their persons for sale. The baths are opened promiscuously to men      and women; and there they strip for licentious indulgence (for,      from looking, men get to loving), as if their modesty had been      washed away in the bath. Those who have not become utterly      destitute of modesty shut out strangers, but bathe with their own      servants, and strip naked before their slaves, and are rubbed by      them, giving to the crouching menial liberty to lust, by      permitting fearless handling, for those who are introduced before      their naked mistresses while in the bath, study to strip      themselves in order to show audacity in lust, casting off fear in      consequence of the wicked custom. The ancient athletes, ashamed      to exhibit a man naked, preserved their modesty by going through      the contest in drawers; but these women, divesting themselves of      their modesty along with their chemise, wish to appear beautiful,      but, contrary to their wish, are simply proved to be wicked.\"      (Clement of Alexandria, _Paedagogus_, Book III, Chapter V. For      elucidations of this passage, see Migne's _Patrologiae Cursus      Completus_, vol. vii.) Promiscuous bathing was forbidden by the      early Apostolical Constitutions, but Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage,      found it necessary, in the third century, to upbraid even virgins      vowed to chastity for continuing the custom. \"What of those,\" he      asks, \"who frequent baths, who prostitute to eyes that are      curious to lust, bodies that are dedicated to chastity and      modesty? They who disgracefully behold naked men, and are seen      naked by men? Do they not themselves afford enticement to vice?      Do they not solicit and invite the desires of those present to      their own corruption and wrong? 'Let every one,' say you, 'look      to the disposition with which he comes thither: my care is only      that of refreshing and washing my poor body.' That kind of      defence does not clear you, nor does it excuse the crime of      lasciviousness and wantonness. Such a washing defiles; it does      not purify nor cleanse the limbs, but stains them. You behold no      one immodestly, but you, yourself, are gazed upon immodestly; you      do not pollute your eyes with disgraceful delight, but in      delighting others you yourself are polluted; you make a show of      the bathing-place; the places where you assemble are fouler than      a theatre. There all modesty is put off; together with the      clothing of garments, the honor and modesty of the body is laid      aside, virginity is exposed, to be pointed at and to"]]]
