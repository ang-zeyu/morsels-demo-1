It  may be the spirit of contradiction, which always makes me long for  what I have not. And yet, I have you, you know, though not quite at  hand; and still I long for you. I proposed to your father that I  should go with him; we would immediately have our banns published and  be married, and both come here. An apartment for married people is  empty in this house, and here you could have had sensible physicians  and every mortal help. It seemed to him too unbecoming. To you, too?  It seems to me still the most sensible thing of all, if you are only  strong enough for the trip. If the Landtag should continue longer than  to the 6th of June--which I still hope it will not--let us look at the  plan more carefully. * * *    Your faithful B.      Schoenhausen, Friday, May 28, '47.    _My Poor Sick Kitten_,--  * * * In regard to your illness, your father's  letter has calmed my anxiety somewhat as to the danger, but yours was  so gloomy and depressed that it affected me decidedly. My dear heart,  such sadness as finds expression there is almost more than submission  to God's will: the latter cannot, in my opinion, be the cause of your  giving up the hope, I might say the wish, that you may be better,  physically, and experience God's blessing here on earth as long as may  be in accordance with His dispensation. You do not really mean it,  either--do you, now?--when, in a fit of melancholy, you say that  nothing whatever interests you genuinely, and you neither grieve nor  rejoice. That smacks of Byron, rather than of Christianity. You have  been sick so often in your life, and have recovered--have experienced  glad and sad hours afterwards; and the old God still lives who helped  you then. Your letter stirred in me more actively than ever the  longing to be at your side, to fondle you and talk with you. * * *    I do not agree with you in your opinion about July, and I would urge  you strongly, too, on this point to side with me against your parents.  When a wife, you are as likely to be sick as when a _fiancee_--and  will be often enough, later; so why not at the beginning, likewise? I  shall be with you as often as I am free from pressing engagements, so  whether we are together here or in Reinfeld makes no difference in the  matter. We do not mean to marry for bright days only: your ill-health  seems to me an utterly frivolous impediment. The provisional situation  we are now in is the worst possible for me. I scarcely know any longer  whether I am living in Schoenhausen, in Reinfeld, in Berlin, or on the  train. If you fall sick, I shall be a sluggard in Reinfeld all the  autumn, or however long our marriage would be postponed, and cannot  even associate with you quite unconstrainedly before the ceremony.  This matter of a betrothed couple seventy miles apart is not  defensible; and, especially when I know you are ailing, I shall take  the journey to see you, of course, as often as my public and private  affairs permit. It seems to me quite necessary to have the ceremony at  the time already appointed; otherwise I should be much distressed, and  I see no reason for it. Don't sell Brunette just now; you will ride  her again soon. I must be in Berlin at noon for a consultation about  plans for tomorrow. Farewell. God strengthen you for joy and hope.    Your most faithful B.    _Tomorrow I'll send you a hat_.[15]      Berlin, Sunday, May 30, '47.    _Tres Chere Jeanneton_,--Your letter of day before yesterday, which I  have just received, has given me profound pleasure and poured into me a  refreshing and more joyous essence: your happier love of life is shared  by me immediately. I shall begin by reassuring you about your gloomy  forebodings of Thursday evening. At the very time when you were  afflicted by them I was rejoicing in the happiness I had long missed, of  living once more in a comfortable Schoenhaus bed, after I had suffered  for weeks from the furnished-apartments couch in Berlin. I slept very  soundly, although with bad dreams--nightmares--which I ascribed to a  late and heavy dinner, inasmuch as the peaceful occupations of the  previous day--consisting in viewing many promising crops and well-fed  sheep, together with catching up with all sorts of police arrangements  relating to dike, fire, and roads--could not have occasioned them. You  see how little you can depend upon the maternal inheritance of  forebodings. Also in regard to the injurious effects of the Landtag  excitement upon my health, I can completely reassure you. I have  discovered what I needed--physical exercise--to offset mental  excitement and irregular diet. Yesterday I spent in Potsdam, to be  present at the water carnival--a lively picture. The great blue basins  of the Havel, with the splendid surroundings of castles, bridges,  churches, enlivened with several hundred gayly decorated boats, whose  occupants, elegantly dressed gentlemen and ladies, bombard one another  lavishly with bouquets when they can reach each other in passing or  drawing up alongside. The royal pair, the whole court, Potsdam's  fashionable people, and half of Berlin whirled in the skein of boats  merrily, pell-mell; royalists and liberals all threw dry or wet flowers  at the neighbor within reach. Three steamboats at anchor, with musical  choruses, constituted the centre of the ever-changing groups. I had the  opportunity to salute, hurriedly and with surprise, and throw flowers  at, many acquaintances whom I had not seen for a long time. My friend  Schaffgotsch is passionately fond of walking, and he was responsible for  our returning to the railway station on foot--a distance of almost three  miles--at such a pace as I had not kept up in a long while. After that I  slept splendidly until nine, and am in a state of physical equilibrium  today such as I have not enjoyed for some time. As the rather dusty  promenades in the Thiergarten do not give me enough of a shaking-up in  the time that I have available for that purpose, Mousquetaire will  arrive here tomorrow, so that he, with his lively gallop, may play the  counterpart to the tune that politics is dancing in my head. My plan  about Berlin and the wedding immediately, etc., was certainly somewhat  adventurous when you look at it in cold blood, but I hope there will be  no change from July. If I am to be tormented, as you say, with an  \"unendurable, dispirited, nervous being,\" it is all the same in the end  whether this torment will be imposed upon me by my _fiancee_ or--forgive  the expression--by my wife. In either case I shall try to bear the  misfortune with philosophical steadfastness; for it is to be hoped that  it will not be so bad that I must dig deeper and seek Christian  consolation for it.    Your very faithful B.      Berlin, July 4, '47.    _Juaninina_,--Happily, I have left Schoenhausen behind me, and do not  expect to enter it again without you, _mon ange._ Only some business  matters detain me here, which I cannot attend to today because it is  Sunday; but I confidently anticipate starting for Angermuende tomorrow  at four, and accordingly, unless the very improbable event occurs that  I am detained outrageously in Kniephof, shall arrive in Schlawe on  Thursday. * * * Farewell, my heart. This is probably the last  post-marked paper that you will receive from your _Braeutigam_[16] (I  hate the expression). Our banns were cried today for the first time in  Schoenhausen. Does that not seem strange to you But I had learned your  given names so badly that I could mention only Johanna Eleonore: the  other six you must teach me better. Farewell, my heart. Many  salutations to the parents.    Your very faithful B.    _My Dear_,--I believe I can now reassure you most completely as to the  safety of the members of the Landtag. The Landtag was opened today,  _minus_ King and _minus_ cheers, with quite calm discussion. In a  few words I uttered my protest against the thanks and exultation that  were voted to the King, without hostilities becoming overt. Ten  thousand men of the city militia were posted for our protection, but  not even a slight disturbance occurred at the palace. I could be with  you tomorrow, as there is no session, if I had ordered a carriage  to meet me at Genthin this evening. But as the whole affair apparently  will come to an end this week, perhaps as early as Thursday, I was  too stingy to hire a carriage. Brauchitsch was taken violently ill  again last evening. * * * Give cordial remembrances to your mother, and  be of good courage. I am much calmer than I was: with Vincke one heart  and one soul.    Your faithful B.    April 2, '48, Sunday Evening.    I fear, my dear heart, the letter I wrote you last evening reached the  post-office so late, through an oversight, that you will not receive  it today, and not before tomorrow with this; and it pains me to think  that you were disappointed in your hope when the mail was delivered,  and now (9 o'clock in the evening) are perhaps troubled with  disquietude of all sorts about me. I have spent a tiresome day,  tramping the pavement, smoking and intriguing. Do not judge of the few  words I spoke yesterday from the report in the Berlin _Times_. I shall  manage to bring you a copy of the speech, which has no significance  except as showing that I did not wish to be included in the category  of certain venal bureaucrats who turned their coat with contemptible  shamelessness to suit the wind. The impression it made was piteous,  while even my most zealous opponents shook my hand with greater warmth  after my declaration. I have just come from a great citizens' meeting,  of perhaps a thousand people, in the Milenz Hall, where the Polish  question was debated very decorously, very good speeches were made,  and on the whole the sentiment seemed to turn"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13058"],[0,"The Teeth of the Tiger (#10)"],[1,"    \"Frightened of what? You say that just as he did last night.\"    \"Yes ... yes ... and for the same reason.\"    \"But--?\"    \"Don't you understand? Don't you understand that I'm wondering--?\"    \"No; what?\"    \"If he's not dead!\"    \"But you're mad, Chief!\"    \"No.... I don't know.... Only, only ... I have an impression of death--\"    Lantern in hand, he stood as one paralyzed, opposite the bed; and he  who was afraid of nothing in the world had not the courage to throw the  light on Hippolyte Fauville's face. A terrifying silence rose and  filled the room.    \"Oh, Chief, he's not moving!\"    \"I know ... I know ... and I now see that he has not moved once during  the night. And that's what frightens me.\"    He had to make a real effort in order to step forward. He was now almost  touching the bed.    The engineer did not appear to breathe.    This time, Perenna resolutely took hold of his hand.    It was icy cold.    Don Luis at once recovered all his self-possession.    \"The window! Open the window!\" he cried.    And, when the light flooded the room, he saw the face of Hippolyte  Fauville all swollen, stained with brown patches.    \"Oh,\" he said, under his breath, \"he's dead!\"    \"Dash it all! Dash it all!\" spluttered the detective sergeant.    For two or three minutes they stood petrified, stupefied, staggered at  the sight of this most astonishing and mysterious phenomenon. Then a  sudden idea made Perenna start. He flew up the winding staircase, rushed  along the gallery, and darted into the attic.    Edmond, Hippolyte Fauville's son, lay stiff and stark on his bed, with a  cadaverous face, dead, too.    \"Dash it all! Dash it all!\" repeated Mazeroux.    Never, perhaps, in the course of his adventurous career, had Perenna  experienced such a knockdown blow. It gave him a feeling of extreme  lassitude, depriving him of all power of speech or movement. Father and  son were dead! They had been killed during that night! A few hours  earlier, though the house was watched and every outlet hermetically  closed, both had been poisoned by an infernal puncture, even as Inspector  Verot was poisoned, even as Cosmo Mornington was poisoned.    \"Dash it all!\" said Mazeroux once more. \"It was not worth troubling about  the poor devils and performing such miracles to save them!\"    The exclamation conveyed a reproach. Perenna grasped it and admitted:    \"You are right, Mazeroux; I was not equal to the job.\"    \"Nor I, Chief.\"    \"You ... you have only been in this business since yesterday evening--\"    \"Well, so have you, Chief!\"    \"Yes, I know, since yesterday evening, whereas the others have been  working at it for weeks and weeks. But, all the same, these two are dead;  and I was there, I, Lupin, was there! The thing has been done under my  eyes; and I saw nothing! I saw nothing! How is it possible?\"    He uncovered the poor boy's shoulders, showing the mark of a puncture at  the top of the arm.    \"The same mark--the same mark obviously that we shall find on the  father.... The lad does not seem to have suffered, either.... Poor little  chap! He did not look very strong.... Never mind, it's a nice face; what  a terrible blow for his mother when she learns!\"    The detective sergeant wept with anger and pity, while he kept on  mumbling:    \"Dash it all!... Dash it all!\"    \"We shall avenge them, eh, Mazeroux?\"    \"Rather, Chief! Twice over!\"    \"Once will do, Mazeroux. But it shall be done with a will.\"    \"That I swear it shall!\"    \"You're right; let's swear. Let us swear that this dead pair shall be  avenged. Let us swear not to lay down our arms until the murderers of  Hippolyte Fauville and his son are punished as they deserve.\"    \"I swear it as I hope to be saved, Chief.\"    \"Good!\" said Perenna. \"And now to work. You go and telephone at once to  the police office. I am sure that M. Desmalions will approve of your  informing him without delay. He takes an immense interest in the case.\"    \"And if the servants come? If Mme. Fauville--?\"    \"No one will come till we open the doors; and we shan't open them except  to the Prefect of Police. It will be for him, afterward, to tell Mme.  Fauville that she is a widow and that she has no son. Go! Hurry!\"    \"One moment, Chief; we are forgetting something that will help us  enormously.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"The little drab-cloth diary in the safe, in which M. Fauville describes  the plot against him.\"    \"Why, of course!\" said Perenna. \"You're right ... especially as he  omitted to mix up the letters of the lock last night, and the key is on  the bunch which he left lying on the table.\"    They ran down the stairs.    \"Leave this to me,\" said Mazeroux. \"It's more regular that you shouldn't  touch the safe.\"    He took the bunch, moved the glass case, and inserted the key with a  feverish emotion which Don Luis felt even more acutely than he did. They  were at last about to know the details of the mysterious story. The dead  man himself would betray the secret of his murderers.    \"Lord, what a time you take!\" growled Don Luis.    Mazeroux plunged both hands into the crowd of papers that encumbered the  iron shelf.    \"Well, Mazeroux, hand it over.\"    \"What?\"    \"The diary.\"    \"I can't Chief.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"It's gone.\"    Don Luis stifled an oath. The drab-cloth diary, which the engineer had  placed in the safe before their eyes, had disappeared.    Mazeroux shook his head.    \"Dash it all! So they knew about that diary!\"    \"Of course they did; and they knew plenty of other things besides.  We've not seen the end of it with those fellows. There's no time to  lose. Ring up!\"    Mazeroux did so and soon received the answer that M. Desmalions was  coming to the telephone. He waited.    In a few minutes Perenna, who had been walking up and down, examining  different objects in the room, came and sat down beside Mazeroux. He  seemed thoughtful. He reflected for some time. But then, his eyes falling  on the fruit dish, he muttered:    \"Hullo! There are only three apples instead of four. Then he ate  the fourth.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mazeroux, \"he must have eaten it.\"    \"That's funny,\" replied Perenna, \"for he didn't think them ripe.\"    He was silent once more, sat leaning his elbows on the table, visibly  preoccupied; then, raising his head, he let fall these words:    \"The murder was committed before we entered the room, at half-past  twelve exactly.\"    \"How do you know, Chief?\"    \"M. Fauville's murderer or murderers, in touching the things on the  table, knocked down the watch which M. Fauville had placed there.  They put it back; but the fall had stopped it. And it stopped at  half-past twelve.\"    \"Then, Chief, when we settled ourselves here, at two in the morning, it  was a corpse that was lying beside us and another over our heads?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But how did those devils get in?\"    \"Through this door, which opens on the garden, and through the gate that  opens on the Boulevard Suchet.\"    \"Then they had keys to the locks and bolts?\"    \"False keys, yes.\"    \"But the policemen watching the house outside?\"    \"They are still watching it, as that sort watch a house, walking from  point to point without thinking that people can slip into a garden  while they have their backs turned. That's what took place in coming  and going.\"    Sergeant Mazeroux seemed flabbergasted. The criminals' daring, their  skill, the precision of their acts bewildered him.    \"They're deuced clever,\" he said.    \"Deuced clever, Mazeroux, as you say; and I foresee a tremendous battle.  By Jupiter, with what a vim they set to work!\"    The telephone bell rang. Don Luis left Mazeroux to his conversation with  the Prefect, and, taking the bunch of keys, easily unfastened the lock  and the bolt of the door and went out into the garden, in the hope of  there finding some trace that should facilitate his quest.    As on the day before, he saw, through the ivy, two policemen walking  between one lamp-post and the next. They did not see him. Moreover,  anything that might happen inside the house appeared to be to them a  matter of total indifference.    \"That's my great mistake,\" said Perenna to himself. \"It doesn't do to  entrust a job to people who do not suspect its importance.\"    His investigations led to the discovery of some traces of footsteps on  the gravel, traces not sufficiently plain to enable him to distinguish  the shape of the shoes that had left them, yet distinct enough to confirm  his supposition. The scoundrels had been that way.    Suddenly he gave a movement of delight. Against the border of the path,  among the leaves of a little clump of rhododendrons, he saw something  red, the shape of which at once struck him. He stooped. It was an  apple, the fourth apple, the one whose absence from the fruit dish he  had noticed.    \"Excellent!\" he said. \"Hippolyte Fauville did not eat it. One of them  must have carried it away--a fit of appetite, a sudden hunger--and it  must have rolled from his hand without his having time to look for it and  pick it up.\"    He took up the fruit and examined it.    \"What!\" he exclaimed, with a start. \"Can it be possible?\"    He stood dumfounded, a prey to real excitement, refusing to admit the  inadmissible thing which nevertheless presented itself to his eyes  with the direct evidence of actuality. Some one had bitten into the  apple; into the apple which was too sour to eat. And the teeth had  left their mark!    \"Is it possible?\" repeated Don Luis. \"Is it possible that one of them  can have been guilty of such an imprudence! The apple must have  fallen without his knowing ... or he must have been unable to find it  in the dark.\"    He could not get over his surprise. He cast about for plausible  explanations. But the fact was there before him. Two rows of teeth,  cutting through the thin red peel, had left their regular, semicircular  bite clearly in the pulp of the fruit. They were clearly marked on the  top, while the lower row had melted"]]]
