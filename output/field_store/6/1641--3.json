It is easy to form the conclusion that the intention of the  British government was to restrain the ambition of the old English  colonies east of the Appalachian range, and to divide the immense  territory to their north-west at some future and convenient time into  several distinct and independent governments. No doubt the British  government also found it expedient for the time being to keep the  control of the fur-trade so far as possible in its own hands, and in  order to achieve this object it was necessary in the first place to  conciliate the Indian tribes, and not allow them to come in any way  under the jurisdiction of the chartered colonies. The proclamation  itself, in fact, laid down entirely new, and certainly equitable,  methods of dealing with the Indians within the limits of British  sovereignty. The governors of the old colonies were expressly forbidden  to grant authority to survey lands beyond the settled territorial limits  of their respective governments. No person was allowed to purchase land  directly from the Indians. The government itself thenceforth could alone  give a legal title to Indian lands, which must, in the first place, be  secured by treaty with the tribes that claimed to own them. This was the  beginning of that honest policy which has distinguished the relations of  England and Canada with the Indian nations for over a hundred years, and  which has obtained for the present Dominion the confidence and  friendship of the many thousand Indians, who roamed for many centuries  in Rupert's Land and in the Indian Territories where the Hudson's Bay  Company long enjoyed exclusive privileges of trade.    The language of the proclamation with respect to the government of the  province of Quebec was extremely unsatisfactory. It was ordered that so  soon as the state and circumstances of the colony admitted, the  governor-general could with the advice and consent of the members of the  council summon a general assembly, \"in such manner and form as is used  and directed in those colonies and provinces in America which are under  our immediate government.\" Laws could be made by the governor, council,  and representatives of the people for the good government of the colony,  \"as near as may be agreeable to the laws of England, and under such  regulations and restrictions as are used in other colonies.\" Until such  an assembly could be called, the governor could with the advice of his  council constitute courts for the trial and determination of all civil  and criminal cases, \"according to law and equity, and as near as may be  agreeable to the laws of England,\" with liberty to appeal, in all civil  cases, to the privy council of England. General Murray, who had been in  the province since the battle on the Plains of Abraham, was appointed to  administer the government. Any persons elected to serve in an assembly  were required, by his commission and instructions, before they could sit  and vote, to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, and subscribe a  declaration against transubstantiation, the adoration of the Virgin, and  the Sacrifice of the Mass.    This proclamation--in reality a mere temporary expedient to give time  for considering the whole state of the colony--was calculated to do  infinite harm, since its principal importance lay in the fact that it  attempted to establish English civil as well as criminal law, and at the  same time required oaths which effectively prevented the French  Canadians from serving in the very assembly which it professed a desire  on the part of the king to establish. The English-speaking or Protestant  people in the colony did not number in 1764 more than three hundred  persons, of little or no standing, and it was impossible to place all  power in their hands and to ignore nearly seventy thousand French  Canadian Roman Catholics. Happily the governor, General Murray, was not  only an able soldier, as his defence of Quebec against Levis had  proved, but also a man of statesmanlike ideas, animated by a high sense  of duty and a sincere desire to do justice to the foreign people  committed to his care. He refused to lend himself to the designs of the  insignificant British minority, chiefly from the New England colonies,  or to be guided by their advice in carrying on his government. His  difficulties were lessened by the fact that the French had no conception  of representative institutions in the English sense, and were quite  content with any system of government that left them their language,  religion, and civil law without interference. The stipulations of the  capitulations of 1759-1760, and of the treaty of Paris, with respect to  the free exercise of the Roman Catholic religion, were always observed  in a spirit of great fairness: and in 1766 Monseigneur Briand was  chosen, with the governor's approval, Roman Catholic bishop of Quebec.  He was consecrated at Paris after his election by the chapter of Quebec,  and it does not appear that his recognition ever became the subject of  parliamentary discussion. This policy did much to reconcile the French  Canadians to their new rulers, and to make them believe that eventually  they would receive full consideration in other essential respects.    For ten years the government of Canada was in a very unsatisfactory  condition, while the British ministry was all the while worried with the  condition of things in the old colonies, then in a revolutionary  ferment. The Protestant minority continued to clamour for an assembly,  and a mixed system of French and English law, in case it was not  possible to establish the latter in its entirety. Attorney-General  Maseres, an able lawyer and constitutional writer, was in favour of a  mixed system, but his views were notably influenced by his strong  prejudices against Roman Catholics. The administration of the law was  extremely confused until 1774, not only on account of the ignorance and  incapacity of the men first sent out from England to preside over the  courts, but also as a consequence of the steady determination of the  majority of French Canadians to ignore laws to which they had naturally  an insuperable objection. In fact, the condition of things became  practically chaotic. It might have been much worse had not General  Murray, at first, and Sir Guy Carleton, at a later time, endeavoured, so  far as lay in their power, to mitigate the hardships to which the people  were subject by being forced to observe laws of which they were entirely  ignorant.    At this time the governor-general was advised by an executive council,  composed of officials and some other persons chosen from the small  Protestant minority of the province. Only one French Canadian appears to  have been ever admitted to this executive body. The English residents  ignored the French as far as possible, and made the most unwarrantable  claims to rule the whole province.    A close study of official documents from 1764 until 1774 goes to show  that all this while the British government was influenced by an anxious  desire to show every justice to French Canada, and to adopt a system of  government most conducive to its best interests In 1767 Lord Shelburne  wrote to Sir Guy Carleton that \"the improvement of the civil  constitution of the province was under their most serious  consideration.\" They were desirous of obtaining all information \"which  can tend to elucidate how far it is practicable and expedient to blend  the English with the French laws, in order to form such a system as  shall be at once equitable and convenient for His Majesty's old and new  subjects.\" From time to time the points at issue were referred to the  law officers of the crown for their opinion, so anxious was the  government to come to a just conclusion. Attorney-General Yorke and  Solicitor-General De Grey in 1766 severely condemned any system that  would permanently \"impose new, unnecessary and arbitrary rules  (especially as to the titles of land, and the mode of descent,  alienation and settlement), which would tend to confound and subvert  rights instead of supporting them.\" In 1772 and 1773 Attorney-General  Thurlow and Solicitor-General Wedderburne dwelt on the necessity of  dealing on principles of justice with the province of Quebec. The French  Canadians, said the former, \"seem to have been strictly entitled by the  _jus gentium_ to their property, as they possessed it upon the  capitulation and treaty of peace, together with all its qualities and  incidents by tenure or otherwise.\" It seemed a necessary consequence  that all those laws by which that property was created, defined, and  secured, must be continued to them. The Advocate-General Marriott, in  1773, also made a number of valuable suggestions in the same spirit, and  at the same time expressed the opinion that under the existent  conditions of the country it was not possible or expedient to call an  assembly. Before the imperial government came to a positive conclusion  on the vexed questions before it, they had the advantage of the wise  experience of Sir Guy Carleton, who visited England and remained there  for some time. The result of the deliberation of years was the passage  through the British parliament of the measure known as \"The Quebec Act,\"  which has always been considered the charter of the special privileges  which the French Canadians have enjoyed ever since, and which, in the  course of a century, made their province one of the most influential  sections of British North America.    The preamble of the Quebec Act fixed new territorial limits for the  province. It comprised not only the country affected by the proclamation  of 1763, but also all the eastern territory which had been previously  annexed to Newfoundland. In the west and south-west the province was  extended to the Ohio and the Mississippi, and in fact embraced all the  lands beyond the Alleghanies"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12667"],[0,"Travels of Richard and John Lander into the interior of Africa, for the (#10)"],[1,"xamination, it was found to be nothing more  than common spar. According to his report, the metal is never met  with in low fertile and wooded spots, but always in naked and barren  hills, embedded in a reddish earth. At one place, after a labour of  twenty days, he succeeded in extracting twelve pounds, and, at  length, he asserts that he arrived at the mouth of the mine itself,  and saw gold in such abundance, as surprised him with joy and  admiration. It does not appear, however, that he returned from his  expedition considerably improved in his fortune by the discovery of  this mine, nor does he give any notice of the real position of it, by  which we are led to conjecture, that the discovery of the mine was  one of those fabrications, which the travellers of those times were  apt to indulge in, for the purpose of gratifying their own vanity,  and exciting the envy of their fellow countrymen.    The spirit of African discovery began to revive in England about the  year 1720. At that time, the Duke of Chandos was governor of the  African company, and being concerned at the declining state of their  affairs, suggested the idea of retrieving them, by opening a path  into the golden regions, which were still reported to exist in the  central part of Africa. The company were not long in finding a person  competent to undertake the expedition, and, on the particular  recommendation of the duke, the appointment was given to Capt.  Bartholomew Stibbs. Being furnished with the requisite means for  sailing up the Gambia, Stibbs sailed in September, 1723, and, on the  7th of October, he arrived at James' Island, the English settlement,  situate about thirty miles from the mouth of the river, whence he  despatched a messenger to Mr. Willy, the governor, who happened at  that time to be visiting the factory at Joar, more than a hundred  miles distant, asking him to engage such vessels as were fit to  navigate the upper streams of the Gambia. To his great surprise and  mortification, however, he received an answer from Mr. Willy, that no  vessels of that kind were to be had, indeed, instead of using every  exertion to promote the cause for which Stibbs had been sent out by  the company, Willy appeared to throw every possible obstruction in  his way, as if he were actuated by a mean and petty spirit of  jealousy of the success, which was likely to await him. A few days,  however, after the answer of Willy had been received, a boat brought  down his dead body, he having fallen a victim to the fever of the  climate, which had previously affected his brain. Willy was succeeded  in the governorship by a person named Orfeur, who showed no immediate  objection to furnish the vessels and other articles necessary for the  expedition of Stibbs up the Gambia, but matters went on so slowly,  that the equipment was not completed until the middle of December,  when the season was fast approaching, which was highly unfavourable  for the accomplishment of the purpose, which Stibbs had in view. He  intended to proceed on his journey on the 24th of December, but a  slight accident, which happened to one of his boats, prevented his  departure on that day: from a superstitious idea that prevailed in  the mind of Stibbs, that success would not attend him, if he sailed  on the day celebrated as the nativity of Jesus Christ, he deferred  his journey to the 26th, when he departed with a crew consisting of  nineteen white men, a complete black one, although a Christian, and  who was to serve as an interpreter; twenty-nine Grumellas, or hired  negroes, with three female cooks; taking afterwards on board a  balafeu, or native musician, for the purpose of enlivening the  spirits of the party, and driving away the crocodiles, who are  superstitiously supposed to have a great dislike \"to the concord of  sweet sounds,\" although emanating from the rude instrument of an  African musician.    During the early part of the voyage every thing appeared to augur  well for the success of the expedition; the party were in high  spirits, and no accident of any moment had yet occurred to check the  joviality, which prevailed amongst the crew. The natives were every  where disposed to carry on trade, and, in some places, saphies or  charms were hung on the banks of the river to induce the white men to  come on shore. Stibbs had endeavoured to conceal the object, of his  journey, but he had formed his calculations upon an erroneous  principle, for he found himself at last pointed out as the person who  was come to bring down the gold. As they approached the falls of  Barraconda, the fears of the native crew began to manifest  themselves, and, as is usual with minds immersed in ignorance and  superstition, they commenced to foretell the most dreadful disasters,  if their captain should attempt to proceed above the falls of  Barraconda; numerous stories were now told of the fearful accidents,  which had happened to almost every person who had attempted to  navigate the river above the falls; the upsetting of a single canoe,  from unskilful management, was magnified into the loss of a hundred,  and of course not a single individual escaped a watery grave. The  natives expected that their terrible narratives would have a proper  influence upon the mind of their captain, and that he would, in  consequence, desist from prosecuting his journey beyond the falls,  but when, contrary to their expectations, he expressed his  determination to proceed to the utmost extent to which the river  would be found to be navigable, the natives presented themselves in  a body before him, and declared their firm determination not to  proceed any further, for, to the apparent surprise of Stibbs, they  informed him that Barraconda was the end of the world, and certainly  no person but a fool, or a madman, would attempt to penetrate any  further. Instances, certainly, they confessed had been known of  persons going beyond the end of the world, but then, as might be  naturally expected, they never were seen any more, being either  devoured by enormous beasts, or carried away into another world, by  some horrid devils, who were always on the watch to catch the  persons, who rejecting the advice, which they themselves were now  giving, were so fool hardy as to throw themselves in their power.  Stibbs now found himself in rather an unpleasant predicament, the  natives appeared resolute not to proceed beyond Barraconda, and Stibbs  knew well that it would be highly imprudent in him to proceed without  them. A palaver was held, and all the arguments which Stibbs could  bring forward, failed to produce the desired effect upon his alarmed  crew. He, however, suddenly bethought himself, that he had an  argument in his possession, of greater potency, than any that could  be afforded by the most persuasive arguments, and taking a bottle of  brandy from his chest, he gave to each man a glass of the spirit,  when, on a sudden, a very extraordinary change appeared to take place  in their opinions and sentiments. They might have been misled as to  Barraconda being the end of the world, and they did now remember some  instances of persons returning, who had been beyond the falls, and as  to the enormous animals, who were said to have devoured the voyagers;  they now believed that no other animals were meant than crocodiles  and river horses, which, although certainly formidable, were not by  any means such dreadful objects as to prevent them prosecuting their  voyage. Thus, what the powers of oratory could not effect, nor the  arguments of sound and deliberate reason accomplish, was achieved in  a moment by the administration of a small quantity of spirituous  liquid, giving bravery to the coward, and daring to the effeminate.    They had now arrived at the dreaded boundary of the habitable world,  but the falls were not found to be nearly so formidable as they had  been represented; they bore rather the character of narrows than of  falls, the channel being confined by rocky ledges and fragments,  between which there was only one passage, where the canoes rubbed  against the rocks on each side. Contrary to the reports, which had  been in general circulation, of the dispositions of the natives of  the Upper Gambia, in which they were represented to be of a most  ferocious and savage nature, they were found to be a harmless, kind,  and good-humoured people, who, on every occasion, hastened to render  every assistance in their power to the navigators, making them  presents of fowls and provisions, and, in some instances, refusing to  take any thing in return for the articles which they gave away.    The most laborious part of the journey now presented itself, which  consisted in the great exertions, which were necessary in order to  pass the flats and quicksands, which seemed to multiply as they  ascended the river, and which obliged the natives to strip and get  into the water, to drag the boats over the shallows by main force.  Although the natives had now ascertained beyond all further doubt,  that Barraconda was not the end of the world, yet, one part of their  story was fully verified, which was that relating to the enormous  animals, with which these desolate regions were tenanted. To the  present travellers, they appeared far more formidable than to their  predecessors, for the very elephants that had fled precipitately  before the crew of Jobson, struck the greatest terror into the party  of Stibbs; for one of them showed such a determined disposition to  exhibit the extent of his strength, that he turned suddenly upon the  crew, and in a very short time put the whole of them to flight. So  little did they show any symptoms of fear for the crew, that they  were frequently seen crossing the river in  bands, at a very short  distance from the boats, throwing up the water with their trunks in  every direction, and raising such an emotion in the water, as to make  the boats rock about, to the great"]]]
