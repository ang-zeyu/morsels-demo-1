Now whatsoever is expressly commanded of  God in plain, evident terms, that is of divine right, without all color  of controversy. Only take this caution, the divine right of things  enjoined by God's express command, is to be interpreted according to the  nature of the thing commanded, and the end or scope of the Lord in  commanding: e.g. 1. Some things God commands morally, to be of perpetual  use; as to honor father and mother, &c.; these are of divine right  forever. 2. Some things he commands but positively, to be of use for a  certain season; as the ceremonial administrations till Christ should  come, for the Jewish church, and the judicial observances for their  Jewish polity; and all these positive laws were of divine right till  Christ abrogated them. 3. Some things he commands only by way of trial,  not with intention that the things commanded should be done, but that  his people's fear, love, and obedience may be proved, tried, &c. Thus  God commanded Abraham to offer up his son Isaac for a burnt-offering,  Gen. xxii.: such things are of divine right only in such cases of  special infallible command. 4. Some things he commands extraordinarily  in certain select and special cases: as, _Israel to borrow jewels of the  Egyptians to rob them_, without intention ever to restore them, Exod.  xi. 2, &c. The disciples to _go preach_--yet to _provide neither gold  nor silver_, &c. Matt. x. 7-10. The elders of the church (while miracles  were of use in the church) _to anoint the sick with oil in the name of  the Lord_, for their recovery, James v. 14. These and like extraordinary  commands were only of force by divine right, in these extraordinary  select cases, when they were propounded.    1. Implicit, or implied: which are either comprehensively contained in  or under the express terms and letter of the command; or,  consequentially, are deducible from the express command.    Comprehensively, many things are contained in a command, that are not  expressed in the very letter of the command. Thus sound interpreters of  the decalogue generally confess, that all precepts thereof include the  whole parts under the general term, and God wills many things by them  more than the bare words signify: e.g. in negative commands, forbidding  sin, we are to understand the positive precepts prescribing the contrary  duties; and so, on the contrary, under affirmative commands, we are to  understand the negative thereof: thus Christ expounds the sixth  commandment, Matt. v. 21-27, and ver. 43, to the end of the chapter. So  when any evil is forbidden, not only the outward gross acts, but all  inward acts and degrees thereof, with all causes and occasions, all  fruits and effects thereof, are forbidden likewise: as, under killing,  provoking terms, rash anger, Matt. v. 21, 22; under adultery, wanton  looks, lustful thoughts, &c., Matt. v. 27-30. Now all things  comprehended in a command (though not expressed) are of divine right.    Consequentially, many things are clearly deducible from express commands  in Scripture, by clear, unforced, infallible, and undeniable  consequence. Now what things are commanded by necessary consequence,  they are of divine right, as well as things in express terms prescribed:  e.g. in the case of baptism, have the ordinary ministers of the New  Testament any punctual express command to baptize? yet, by consequence,  it is evident infallibly, the apostles are commanded to baptize, and the  promise is made to them by Christ, that he _will be with them always to  the end of the world_, Matt, xxviii. 18-20, which cannot be interpreted  of the apostles' persons only; for they were not to live till the  world's end, but are dead and gone long ago; but of the apostles and  their successors, the ministers of the gospel to the world's end; now to  whom the promise of Christ's presence is here to be applied, to them the  precept of baptizing and teaching is intended by clear consequence and  deduction. So, infants of Christian parents under the New Testament are  commanded to be baptized by consequence; for that the infants of God's  people under the Old Testament were commanded to be circumcised, Gen.  xvii.; for, the privileges of believers under the New Testament are as  large as the privileges of believers under the Old Testament: and the  children of believers under the New Testament are federally holy, and  within the covenant of God, as well as the children of believers under  the Old Testament, Gen. xvii., compared with Rom. xi. 16; 1 Cor. vii.  14: and what objections can be made from infants' incapacity now,  against their baptism, might as well then have been made against their  being circumcised: and why children should once be admitted to the  initiating sacrament, and not still be admitted to the like initiating  sacrament, (the Lord of the covenant and sacrament nowhere forbidding  them,) there can be no just ground. And baptism succeeds in the room of  circumcision, Col. ii. 11, 12. _Thus in case of the Lord's supper_,  apostles were commanded to dispense it, and men commanded to receive it.  \"Do ye this in remembrance of me,\" Matt, xxvi., 1 Cor. xi. 24, 25; yet  by consequence, the ministers of the gospel succeeding the apostles,  being stewards of the mysteries of God, have the same charge laid upon  them; and women as well as men are enjoined to keep that sacrament,  whole families communicating in the passover, the forerunner of the  Lord's supper, Exod. xiv., and male and female being _all one in  Christ_, Gal. iii. 28. _Thus in case of the maintenance of ministers  under the New Testament_: the apostle proves it by consequence to be  commanded, God hath ordained, &c., from God's command of not _muzzling  the ox that treads out the corn_, and of maintaining the priests under  the Old Testament, 1 Cor. ix. 14, &c.; l Tim. v. 17, 18. And thus, in  case of church polity, the Hebrews are commanded to obey and be  subordinate to their rulers in the Lord, Heb. xiii. 17; consequently,  other churches are commanded not only to have rulers, but to obey and  submit to their rule and government. Timothy is commanded to lay hands  _suddenly on none_, &c., in ordaining of preaching elders, 1 Tim. v. 21,  22; consequently, such as succeed Timothy in ordaining of preaching  elders are enjoined therein to do nothing suddenly, hastily, &c., but  upon mature deliberation. The apostle commands, that men must _first be  proved, and found blameless, before they execute the deacon's office_, 1  Tim. iii. 10; by consequence, it is much more necessarily commanded,  that ruling elders should first be proved, and be found blameless,  before they exercise rule; and that ministers be examined, and found  blameless, before they be ordained to or execute the ministerial  function, for these offices are of greater and higher concernment than  the deacon's office.    2. Mediate divine commands, which are mediately from God, but  immediately from men; and these come under a double consideration, being  either,    1. Such commands whose general principles are immediately the Lord's,  yet accommodations and determinations of particulars are from men, by  apparent deductions from those grounds. Of such the apostle saith, \"But  to the rest speak I, not the Lord,\" 1 Cor. vii. 12; not that Paul  delivered any commands merely of his own head, (for he had \"obtained  mercy of the Lord to be faithful,\" ver. 25, and did _think that he had  the Spirit of the Lord_, ver. 40,) but grounded his commands upon the  word of God, whereof the apostle was the interpreter. The case is  concerning divorce when it fell out that believer and unbeliever were  married together: the Lord had given general rules about divorce, but no  particular rule about this case, (it being not incident to the Jews;)  the apostle, therefore, accommodates the general rule to the particular  case; he, not the Lord, determined the particular. This sound  interpreters conceive to be the apostle's meaning: Thus the apostle,  treating of order in public assemblies, saith, \"The prophet and the  spiritual man must acknowledge the things which I write, to be the  commandments of the Lord,\" 1 Cor. xiv. 37. Understand it mediately, as  being agreeable to the Lord's principles revealed: for otherwise how  should the prophet know what the Lord immediately revealed to the  apostle? or why should we think it probable that what Paul here speaks  of order and decency in church assemblies, was immediately and expressly  delivered him by speech or revelation from the Lord, seeing these  particulars have such easy and apparent deduction from general  principles, and revelations are not unnecessarily multiplied? Yet these  particular deductions and determinations are here styled the  commandments of the Lord.    2. Such commands, which are accidental and occasional, whose grounds and  general principles are also the Lord's; yet determination or deduction  of particulars can hardly be made, but in such emergent cases and  occasions accidentally falling out, as necessitate thereunto. As in that  case, Acts xv., when the synod commands abstinence _from blood, and  things strangled_, and that necessarily, (though the Levitical law was  now abrogated,) because the common use thereof by accident grew very  scandalous: therefore, by the law of charity, the use of Christian  liberty is to be suspended, when otherwise the scandal of my brother is  endangered; yet from any ground of equity to have provided such a  particular rule as this, without such a case occurring, would scarce  have been possible. Now the synod saith of this determination, \"It  seemed good unto the Holy Ghost, and unto us,\" Acts xv. And another  synod, walking by the like light and rule of the Scripture as they did,  may say of themselves as the apostles said.          PART II.    OF THE NATURE OF THAT CHURCH "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13944"],[0,"After London; Or, Wild England (#10)"],[1,"   On the recess of the window was an inkstand, which had been recently in  use, for a quill lay beside it, and a sheet of parchment partly covered  with writing. The ink was thick and very dark, made of powdered  charcoal, leaving a slightly raised writing, which could be perceived by  the finger on rubbing it lightly over. Beneath the window on the bare  floor was an open chest, in which were several similar parchments and  books, and from which the sheet on the recess had evidently been taken.  This chest, though small, was extremely heavy and strong, being dug out  with the chisel and gouge from a solid block of oak. Except a few  parallel grooves, there was no attempt at ornamentation upon it. The  lid, which had no hinges, but lifted completely off, was tilted against  the wall. It was, too, of oak some inches thick, and fitted upon the  chest by a kind of dovetailing at the edges.    Instead of a lock, the chest was fastened by a lengthy thong of oxhide,  which now lay in a coil on the floor. Bound round and round, twisted and  intertangled, and finally tied with a special and secret knot (the ends  being concealed), the thong of leather secured the contents of the chest  from prying eyes or thievish hands. With axe or knife, of course, the  knot might easily have been severed, but no one could obtain access to  the room except the retainers of the house, and which of them, even if  unfaithful, would dare to employ such means in view of the certain  punishment that must follow? It would occupy hours to undo the knot, and  then it could not be tied again in exactly the same fashion, so that the  real use of the thong was to assure the owner that his treasures had not  been interfered with in his absence. Such locks as were made were of the  clumsiest construction. They were not so difficult to pick as the thong  to untie, and their expense, or rather the difficulty of getting a  workman who could manufacture them, confined their use to the heads of  great houses. The Baron's chest was locked, and his alone, in the  dwelling.    Besides the parchments which were nearest the top, as most in use, there  were three books, much worn and decayed, which had been preserved, more  by accident than by care, from the libraries of the ancients. One was an  abridged history of Rome, the other a similar account of English  history, the third a primer of science or knowledge; all three, indeed,  being books which, among the ancients, were used for teaching children,  and which, by the men of those days, would have been cast aside with  contempt.    Exposed for years in decaying houses, rain and mildew had spotted and  stained their pages; the covers had rotted away these hundred years, and  were now supplied by a broad sheet of limp leather with wide margins far  overlapping the edges; many of the pages were quite gone, and others  torn by careless handling. The abridgment of Roman history had been  scorched by a forest fire, and the charred edges of the leaves had  dropped away in semicircular holes. Yet, by pondering over these, Felix  had, as it were, reconstructed much of the knowledge which was the  common (and therefore unvalued) possession of all when they were  printed.    The parchments contained his annotations, and the result of his thought;  they were also full of extracts from decaying volumes lying totally  neglected in the houses of other nobles. Most of these were of extreme  antiquity, for when the ancients departed, the modern books which they  had composed being left in the decaying houses at the mercy of the  weather, rotted, or were destroyed by the frequent grass fires. But  those that had been preserved by the ancients in museums escaped for a  while, and some of these yet remained in lumber-rooms and corners,  whence they were occasionally dragged forth by the servants for greater  convenience in lighting the fires. The young nobles, entirely devoted to  the chase, to love intrigues, and war, overwhelmed Felix Aquila with  ridicule when they found him poring over these relics, and being of a  proud and susceptible spirit, they so far succeeded that he abandoned  the open pursuit of such studies, and stole his knowledge by fitful  glances when there was no one near. As among the ancients learning was  esteemed above all things, so now, by a species of contrast, it was of  all things the most despised.    Under the books, in one corner of the chest, was a leather bag  containing four golden sovereigns, such as were used by the ancients,  and eighteen pieces of modern silver money, the debased shillings of the  day, not much more than half of which was silver and the rest alloy. The  gold coins had been found while digging holes for the posts of a new  stockade, and by the law should have been delivered to the prince's  treasury. All the gold discovered, whether in the form of coin or  jewellery, was the property of the Prince, who was supposed to pay for  its value in currency.    As the actual value of the currency was only half of its nominal value  (and sometimes less), the transaction was greatly in favour of the  treasury. Such was the scarcity of gold that the law was strictly  enforced, and had there been the least suspicion of the fact, the house  would have been ransacked from the cellars to the roof. Imprisonment and  fine would have been the inevitable fate of Felix, and the family would  very probably have suffered for the fault of one of its members. But  independent and determined to the last degree, Felix ran any risk rather  than surrender that which he had found, and which he deemed his own.  This unbending independence and pride of spirit, together with scarce  concealed contempt for others, had resulted in almost isolating him from  the youth of his own age, and had caused him to be regarded with dislike  by the elders. He was rarely, if ever, asked to join the chase, and  still more rarely invited to the festivities and amusements provided in  adjacent houses, or to the grander entertainments of the higher nobles.  Too quick to take offence where none was really intended, he fancied  that many bore him ill-will who had scarcely given him a passing  thought. He could not forgive the coarse jokes uttered upon his personal  appearance by men of heavier build, who despised so slender a stripling.    He would rather be alone than join their company, and would not compete  with them in any of their sports, so that, when his absence from the  arena was noticed, it was attributed to weakness or cowardice. These  imputations stung him deeply, driving him to brood within himself. He  was never seen in the courtyards or ante-rooms at the palace, nor  following in the train of the Prince, as was the custom with the  youthful nobles. The servility of the court angered and disgusted him;  the eagerness of strong men to carry a cushion or fetch a dog annoyed  him.    There were those who observed this absence from the crowd in the  ante-rooms. In the midst of so much intrigue and continual striving for  power, designing men, on the one hand, were ever on the alert for what  they imagined would prove willing instruments; and on the other, the  Prince's councillors kept a watchful eye on the dispositions of every  one of the least consequence; so that, although but twenty-five, Felix  was already down in two lists, the one, at the palace, of persons whose  views, if not treasonable, were doubtful, and the other, in the hands of  a possible pretender, as a discontented and therefore useful man. Felix  was entirely ignorant that he had attracted so much observation. He  supposed himself simply despised and ignored; he cherished no treason,  had not the slightest sympathy with any pretender, held totally aloof  from intrigue, and his reveries, if they were ambitious, concerned only  himself.    But the most precious of the treasures in the chest were eight or ten  small sheets of parchment, each daintily rolled and fastened with a  ribbon, letters from Aurora Thyma, who had also given him the ivory  cross on the wall. It was of ancient workmanship, a relic of the old  world. A compass, a few small tools (valuable because preserved for so  many years, and not now to be obtained for any consideration), and a  magnifying glass, a relic also of the ancients, completed the contents  of the chest.    Upon a low table by the bedstead were a flint and steel and tinder, and  an earthenware oil lamp, not intended to be carried about. There, too,  lay his knife, with a buckhorn hilt, worn by everyone in the belt, and  his forester's axe, a small tool, but extremely useful in the woods,  without which, indeed, progress was often impossible. These were in the  belt, which, as he undressed, he had cast upon the table, together with  his purse, in which were about a dozen copper coins, not very regular in  shape, and stamped on one side only. The table was formed of two short  hewn planks, scarcely smoothed, raised on similar planks (on edge) at  each end, in fact, a larger form.    From a peg driven into the wall hung a disc of brass by a thin leathern  lace; this disc, polished to the last degree, answered as a mirror. The  only other piece of furniture, if so it could be called, was a block of  wood at the side of the table, used as a chair. In the corner, between  the table and the window, stood a long yew bow, and a quiver full of  arrows ready for immediate use, besides which three or four sheaves lay  on the floor. A crossbow hung on a wooden peg; the bow was of wood, and,  therefore, not very powerful; bolts and square-headed quarrels were  scattered carelessly on the floor under it.    Six or seven slender darts used for casting with the hand, as javelins,  stood in another corner by the door, and two stouter boar spears. By the  wall a heap of nets lay in apparent confusion, some used for partridges,  some of coarse twine for bush-hens, another, lying a little apart, for  fishes. Near these the"]]]
