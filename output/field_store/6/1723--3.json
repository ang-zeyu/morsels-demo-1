There he found as a fellow-prisoner one Rusticano  of Pisa, a man of some learning and a sort of predecessor of Sir  Thomas Malory, since he had devoted much time to re-writing, in  prose, abstracts of the many romances relating to the Round Table.  These he wrote, not in Italian (which can scarcely be said to have  existed for literary purposes in those days), but in French, the  common language of chivalry throughout Western Europe. While in  prison with Marco Polo, he took down in French the narrative of  the great traveller, and thus preserved it for all time. Marco  Polo was released in 1299, and returned to Venice, where he died  some time after 9th January 1334, the date of his will.    Of the travels thus detailed in Marco Polo's book, and of their  importance and significance in the history of geographical discovery,  it is impossible to give any adequate account in this place. It  will, perhaps, suffice if we give the summary of his claims made  out by Colonel Sir Henry Yule, whose edition of his travels is  one of the great monuments of English learning:--    \"He was the first traveller to trace a route across the whole longitude  of Asia, naming and describing kingdom after kingdom which he had seen  with his own eyes: the deserts of Persia, the flowering plateaux and  wild gorges of Badakhshan, the jade-bearing rivers of Khotan, the  Mongolian Steppes, cradle of the power that had so lately threatened  to swallow up Christendom, the new and brilliant court that had been  established by Cambaluc; the first traveller to reveal China in  all its wealth and vastness, its mighty rivers, its huge cities,  its rich manufactures, its swarming population, the inconceivably  vast fleets that quickened its seas and its inland waters; to tell  us of the nations on its borders, with all their eccentricities  of manners and worship; of Tibet, with its sordid devotees; of  Burma, with its golden pagodas and their tinkling crowns; of Laos,  of Siam, of Cochin China, of Japan, the Eastern Thule, with its  rosy pearls and golden-roofed palaces; the first to speak of that  museum of beauty and wonder, still so imperfectly ransacked, the  Indian Archipelago, source of those aromatics then so highly prized,  and whose origin was so dark; of Java, the pearl of islands; of  Sumatra, with its many kings, its strange costly products, and  its cannibal races; of the naked savages of Nicobar and Andaman;  of Ceylon, the island of gems, with its sacred mountain, and its  tomb of Adam; of India the Great, not as a dreamland of Alexandrian  fables, but as a country seen and personally explored, with its  virtuous Brahmans, its obscene ascetics, its diamonds, and the  strange tales of their acquisition, its sea-beds of pearl, and  its powerful sun: the first in mediaeval times to give any distinct  account of the secluded Christian empire of Abyssinia, and the  semi-Christian island of Socotra; to speak, though indeed dimly,  of Zanzibar, with its negroes and its ivory, and of the vast and  distant Madagascar, bordering on the dark ocean of the South, with  its Ruc and other monstrosities, and, in a remotely opposite region,  of Siberia and the Arctic Ocean, of dog-sledges, white bears, and  reindeer-riding Tunguses.\"    [Illustration: FRA MAURO'S MAP, 1457.]    Marco Polo's is thus one of the greatest names in the history of  geography; it may, indeed, be doubted whether any other traveller  has ever added so extensively to our detailed knowledge of the  earth's surface. Certainly up to the time of Mr. Stanley no man  had on land visited so many places previously unknown to civilised  Europe. But the lands he discovered, though already fully populated,  were soon to fall into disorder, and to be closed to any civilising  influences. Nothing for a long time followed from these discoveries,  and indeed almost up to the present day his accounts were received  with incredulity, and he himself was regarded more as \"Marco Millione\"  than as Marco Polo.    Extensive as were Marco Polo's travels, they were yet exceeded in  extent, though not in variety, by those of the greatest of Arabian  travellers, Mohammed Ibn Batuta, a native of Tangier, who began his  travels in 1334, as part of the ordinary duty of a good Mohammedan  to visit the holy city of Mecca. While at Alexandria he met a learned  sage named Borhan Eddin, to whom he expressed his desire to travel.  Borhan said to him, \"You must then visit my brother Farid Iddin and  my brother Rokn Eddin in Scindia, and my brother Borhan Eddin in  China. When you see them, present my compliments to them.\" Owing  mainly to the fact that the Tatar princes had adopted Islamism  instead of Christianity, after the failure of Gregory X. to send  Christian teachers to China, Ibn Batuta was ultimately enabled to  greet all three brothers of Borhan Eddin. Indeed, he performed  a more extraordinary exploit, for he was enabled to convey the  greetings of the Sheikh Kawan Eddin, whom he met in China, to a  relative of his residing in the Soudan. During the thirty years  of his travels he visited the Holy Land, Armenia, the Crimea,  Constantinople (which he visited in company with a Greek princess,  who married one of the Tatar Khans), Bokhara, Afghanistan, and  Delhi. Here he found favour with the emperor Mohammed Inghlak,  who appointed him a judge, and sent him on an embassy to China,  at first overland, but, as this was found too dangerous a route,  he went ultimately from Calicut, via Ceylon, the Maldives, and  Sumatra, to Zaitun, then the great port of China. Civil war having  broken out, he returned by the same route to Calicut, but dared  not face the emperor, and went on to Ormuz and Mecca, and returned  to Tangier in 1349. But even then his taste for travel had not been  exhausted. He soon set out for Spain, and worked his way through  Morocco, across the Sahara, to the Soudan. He travelled along the Niger  (which he took for the Nile), and visited Timbuctoo. He ultimately  returned to Fez in 1353, twenty-eight years after he had set out on  his travels. Their chief interest is in showing the wide extent of  Islam in his day, and the facilities which a common creed gave for  extensive travel. But the account of his journeys was written in  Arabic, and had no influence on European knowledge, which, indeed,  had little to learn from him after Marco Polo, except with regard  to the Soudan. With him the history of mediaeval geography may be  fairly said to end, for within eighty years of his death began  the activity of Prince Henry the Navigator, with whom the modern  epoch begins.    Meanwhile India had become somewhat better known, chiefly by the  travels of wandering friars, who visited it mainly for the sake of  the shrine of St. Thomas, who was supposed to have been martyred  in India. Mention should also be made of the early spread of the  Nestorian Church throughout Central Asia. As early as the seventh  century the Syrian Christians who followed the views of Nestorius  began spreading them eastward, founding sees in Persia and Turkestan,  and ultimately spreading as far as Pekin. There was a certain revival  of their missionary activity under the Mongol Khans, but the restricted  nature of the language in which their reports were written prevented  them from having any effect upon geographical knowledge, except in  one particular, which is of some interest. The fate of the Lost  Ten Tribes of Israel has always excited interest, and a legend arose  that they had been converted to Christianity, and existed somewhere  in the East under a king who was also a priest, and known as Prester  John. Now, in the reports brought by some of the Nestorian priests  westward, it was stated that one of the Mongol princes named Ung Khan  had adopted Christianity, and as this in Syriac sounded something  like \"John the Cohen,\" or \"Priest,\" he was identified with the Prester  John of legend, and for a long time one of the objects of travel in  the East was to discover this Christian kingdom. It was, however,  later ascertained that there did exist such a Christian kingdom in  Abyssinia, and as owing to the erroneous views of Ptolemy, followed  by the Arabs, Abyssinia was considered to spread towards Farther  India, the land of Prester John was identified in Abyssinia. We  shall see later on how this error helped the progress of geographical  discovery.    The total addition of these mediaeval travels to geographical knowledge  consisted mainly in the addition of a wider extent of land in China,  and the archipelago of Japan, or Cipangu, to the map of the world.  The accompanying map displays the various travels and voyages of  importance, and will enable the reader to understand how students  of geography, who added on to Ptolemy's estimate of the extent of  the world east and west the new knowledge acquired by Marco Polo,  would still further decrease the distance westward between Europe  and Cipangu, and thus prepare men for the voyage of Columbus.    [_Authorities:_ Sir Henry Yule, _Cathay and the Way Thither_, 1865;  _The Book of Ser Marco Polo_, 1875.]          CHAPTER V    ROADS AND COMMERCE    We have now conducted the course of our inquiries through ancient  times and the Middle Ages up to the very eve of the great discoveries  of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and we have roughly indicated  what men had learned about the earth during that long period, and,  how they learned it. But it still remains to consider by what means  they arrived at their knowledge, and why they sought for it. To some  extent we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14293"],[0,"The Complete Book of Cheese (#10)"],[1,"recipe, but not  lamentable, since all aboriginal cheese toasts were washed down in  tossing seas of ale, beer, porter, stout, and 'arf and 'arf.    This creamy Stewed Buck, on which the literary greats of Johnson's  time supped while they smoked their church wardens, received its  highest praise from an American newspaper woman who rhapsodized in  1891: \"Then came stewed cheese, on the thin shaving of crisp, golden  toast in hot silver saucers--so hot that the cheese was the substance  of thick cream, the flavor of purple pansies and red raspberries  commingled.\"    This may seem a bit flowery, but in truth many fine cheeses hold a  trace of the bouquet of the flowers that have enriched the milk.  Alpine blooms and herbs haunt the Gruyere, Parmesan wafts the scent of  Parma violets, the Flower Cheese of England is perfumed with the  petals of rose, violet, marigold and jasmine.       Oven Rabbit (FROM AN OLD RECIPE)         Chop small 1/2 pound of cooking cheese. Put it, with a piece of       butter the size of a walnut, in a little saucepan, and as the       butter melts and the cheese gets warm, mash them together,         When softened add 2 yolks of eggs, 1/2 teacupful of ale, a little       cayenne pepper and salt. Stir with a wooden spoon one way only,       until it is creamy, but do not let it boil, for that would spoil       it. Place some slices of buttered toast on a dish, pour the       Rarebit upon them, and set inside-the oven about 2 minutes before       serving.       Yorkshire Rabbit _(originally called Gherkin Buck,  from a pioneer recipe_)         Put into a saucepan 1/2 pound of cheese, sprinkle with pepper       (black, of course) to taste, pour over 1/2 teacup of ale, and       convert the whole into a smooth, creamy mass, over the fire,       stirring continually, for about 10 minutes.         In 2 more minutes it should be done. (10 minutes altogether is       the minimum.) Pour it over slices of hot toast, place a piece of       broiled bacon on the top of each and serve as hot as possible.       Golden Buck         A Golden Buck is simply the Basic Welsh Rabbit with beer (No. 1)       plus a poached egg on top. The egg, sunny side up, gave it its       shining name a couple of centuries ago. Nowadays some chafing       dish show-offs try to gild the Golden Buck with dashes of ginger       and spice.       Golden Buck II         This is only a Golden Buck with the addition of bacon strips.       The Venerable Yorkshire Buck         Spread 1/2-inch slices of bread with mustard and brown in hot       oven. Then moisten each slice with 1/2 glass of ale, lay on top a       slice of cheese 1/4-inch thick, and 2 slices of bacon on top of       that. Put back in oven, cook till cheese is melted and the bacon       crisp, and serve piping hot, with tankards of cold ale.    Bacon is the thing that identifies any Yorkshire Rabbit.       Yale College Welsh Rabbit (MORIARTY'S)    1 jigger of beer  1/4 teaspoon salt  1/4 teaspoon black pepper  1/4 teaspoon mustard  1-1/2 cups grated or shaved cheese  More beer         Pour the jigger of beer into \"a low saucepan,\" dash on the       seasonings, add the cheese and stir unremittingly, moistening       from time to time with more beer, a pony or two at a time.         When creamy, pour over buttered toast (2 slices for this amount)       and serve with still more beer.    There are two schools of postgraduate Rabbit-hunters: Yale, as above,  with beer both in the Rabbit and with it; and the other featured in  the Stieff Recipe, which prefers leaving it out of the Rabbit, but  taps a keg to drink with it.    The ancient age of Moriarty's campus classic is registered by the use  of pioneer black pepper in place of white, which is often used today  and is thought more sophisticated by some than the red cayenne of  Rector's Naughty Nineties Chafing Dish Rabbit, which is precisely the  same as our Basic Recipe No. 1.       Border-hopping Bunny, or Frijole Rabbit    1-1/2 tablespoons butter  1-1/2 tablespoons chopped onion  2 tablespoons chopped pepper, green or red, or both  1-1/2 teaspoon chili powder  1 small can kidney beans, drained  1-1/2 tablespoons catsup  1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire  Salt  2 cups grated cheese         Cook onion and pepper lightly in butter with chili powder; add       kidney beans and seasonings and stir in the cheese until melted.         Serve this beany Bunny peppery hot on tortillas or crackers,       toasted and buttered.    In the whole hutch of kitchen Rabbitry the most popular modern ones  are made with tomato, a little or lots. They hop in from everywhere,  from Mexico to South Africa, and call for all kinds of quirks, down to  mixing in some dried beef, and there is even a skimpy Tomato Rabbit  for reducers, made with farmer cheese and skimmed milk.    Although the quaintly named Rum Tum Tiddy was doubtless the  great-grandpappy of all Tomato Rabbits, a richer, more buttery and  more eggy one has taken its place as the standard today. The following  is a typical recipe for this, tried and true, since it has had a  successful run through a score of the best modern cookbooks, with only  slight personal changes to keep its juice a-flowing blood-red.       Tomato Rabbit    2 tablespoons butter  2 tablespoons flour  3/4 cup thin cream or evaporated milk  3/4 cup canned tomato pulp, rubbed through a sieve to remove seeds  A pinch of soda  3 cups grated cheese  Pinches of dry mustard, salt and cayenne  2 eggs, lightly beaten         Blend flour in melted butter, add cream slowly, and when this       white sauce is a little thick, stir in tomato sprinkled with       soda. Keep stirring steadily while adding cheese and seasonings,       and when cooked enough, stir in the eggs to make a creamy       texture, smooth as silk. Serve on buttered whole wheat or graham       bread for a change.    Instead of soda, some antiquated recipes call for \"a tablespoon of  bicarbonate of potash.\"       South African Tomato Rabbit         This is the same as above, except that 1/2 teaspoon of sugar is       used in place of the soda and the Rabbit is poured over baked       pastry cut into squares and sprinkled with parsley, chopped fine,       put in the oven and served immediately.       Rum Tum Tiddy, Rink Tum Ditty, etc. (OLD BOSTON  STYLE)    1 tablespoon butter  1 onion, minced  1 teaspoon salt  1 big pinch of pepper  2 cups cooked tomatoes  1 tablespoon sugar  3 cups grated store cheese  1 egg, lightly beaten         Slowly fry onion bright golden in butter, season and add tomatoes       with sugar. Heat just under the bubbling point. Don't let it       boil, but keep adding cheese and shaking the pan until it melts.       Then stir in egg gently and serve very hot       Tomato Soup Rabbit    1 can condensed tomato soup  2 cups grated cheese  1/4 teaspoon English mustard  1 egg, lightly beaten  Salt and pepper         Heat soup, stir in cheese until melted, add mustard and egg       slowly, season and serve hot.    This is a quickie Rum Tum Tiddy, without any onion, a poor,  housebroken version of the original. It can be called a Celery Rabbit  if you use a can of celery soup in place of the tomato.       Onion Rum Tum Tiddy         Prepare as in Rum Tum Tiddy, but use only 1-1/2 cups cooked       tomatoes and add 1/2 cup of mashed boiled onions.       Sherry Rum Tum Tiddy    1 tablespoon butter  1 small onion, minced  1 small green pepper, minced  1 can tomato soup  3/4 cup milk  3 cups grated cheese  1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce  Salt and pepper  1 egg, lightly beaten  1 jigger sherry  Crackers         Prepare as in Rum Tum Tiddy. Stir in sherry last to retain its       flavor. Crumble crackers into a hot tureen until it's about 1/3       full and pour the hot Rum Tum Tiddy over them.       Blushing Bunny         This is a sister-under-the-skin to the old-fashioned Rum Tum       Tiddy, except that her complexion is made a little rosier with a       lot of paprika in place of plain pepper, and the paprika cooked       in from the start, of course.    Blushing Bunny is one of those playful English names for dishes, like  Pink Poodle, Scotch Woodcock (given below), Bubble and Squeak  _(Bubblum Squeakum_), and Toad in the Hole.       Scotch Woodcock         Another variant of Rum Tum Tiddy. Make your Rum Tum Tiddy, but       before finishing up with the beaten egg, stir in 2 heaping       tablespoons of anchovy paste and prepare the buttered toast by       laying on slices of hard-cooked eggs.       American Woodchuck    1-1/2 cups tomato puree  2 cups grated cheese  1 egg, lightly beaten  Cayenne  1 tablespoon brown sugar  Salt and pepper         Heat the tomato and stir in the cheese. When partly melted stir       in the egg and, when almost cooked, add seasonings without ever       interrupting the stirring. Pour over hot toasted crackers or       bread.    No doubt this all-American Tomato Rabbit with brown sugar was named  after the native woodchuck, in playful imitation of the Scotch  Woodcock above. It's the only Rabbit we know that's sweetened with  brown sugar.       Running Rabbit (_as served at the Waldorf-Astoria,  First Annual Cheeselers Field Day, November 12,1937_)         Cut finest old American cheese in very small pieces and melt in       saucepan with a little good beer. Season and add Worcestershire       sauce. Serve instantly with freshly made toast.    This running cony can be poured over toast like any other Rabbit, or  over crushed crackers in a hot tureen, as in Sherry Rum Tum Tiddy, or  served like Fondue, in the original cooking bowl or pan, with the  spoon kept moving in it in one direction only and the Rabbit following  the spoon, like a greyhound following the stuffed rabbit at the dog  races.       Mexican Chilaly    1 tablespoon butter  3 tablespoons chopped green pepper 1-1/2 tablespoons chopped onion  1 cup chopped and drained canned tomatoes, without seeds  2-1/2 cups grated cheese  3/4"]]]
