Here he fed,  with daily oblations of human blood, two devouring serpents, which had  become, according to the poets, a part of himself, and to sustain whom  he levied a tax of daily human sacrifices, till the exhausted patience  of his subjects caused some to raise up the scimitar of resistance, like  the valiant Blacksmith and the victorious Feridoun, by whom the tyrant  was at length dethroned, and imprisoned for ever in the dismal caverns  of the mountain Damavend. But ere that deliverance had taken place, and  whilst the power of the bloodthirsty tyrant was at its height, the band  of ravening slaves whom he had sent forth to purvey victims for his  daily sacrifice brought to the vaults of the palace of Istakhar seven  sisters so beautiful that they seemed seven houris. These seven maidens  were the daughters of a sage, who had no treasures save those beauties  and his own wisdom. The last was not sufficient to foresee this  misfortune, the former seemed ineffectual to prevent it. The eldest  exceeded not her twentieth year, the youngest had scarce attained her  thirteenth; and so like were they to each other that they could not  have been distinguished but for the difference of height, in which they  gradually rose in easy gradation above each other, like the ascent which  leads to the gates of Paradise. So lovely were these seven sisters when  they stood in the darksome vault, disrobed of all clothing saving a  cymar of white silk, that their charms moved the hearts of those who  were not mortal. Thunder muttered, the earth shook, the wall of the  vault was rent, and at the chasm entered one dressed like a hunter, with  bow and shafts, and followed by six others, his brethren. They were tall  men, and, though dark, yet comely to behold; but their eyes had more the  glare of those of the dead than the light which lives under the eyelids  of the living. 'Zeineb,' said the leader of the band--and as he spoke  he took the eldest sister by the hand, and his voice was soft, low, and  melancholy--'I am Cothrob, king of the subterranean world, and supreme  chief of Ginnistan. I and my brethren are of those who, created out of  the pure elementary fire, disdained, even at the command of Omnipotence,  to do homage to a clod of earth, because it was called Man. Thou mayest  have heard of us as cruel, unrelenting, and persecuting. It is false. We  are by nature kind and generous; only vengeful when insulted, only cruel  when affronted. We are true to those who trust us; and we have heard the  invocations of thy father, the sage Mithrasp, who wisely worships not  alone the Origin of Good, but that which is called the Source of Evil.  You and your sisters are on the eve of death; but let each give to us  one hair from your fair tresses, in token of fealty, and we will carry  you many miles from hence to a place of safety, where you may bid  defiance to Zohauk and his ministers.' The fear of instant death, saith  the poet, is like the rod of the prophet Haroun, which devoured all  other rods when transformed into snakes before the King of Pharaoh; and  the daughters of the Persian sage were less apt than others to be  afraid of the addresses of a spirit. They gave the tribute which Cothrob  demanded, and in an instant the sisters were transported to an enchanted  castle on the mountains of Tugrut, in Kurdistan, and were never again  seen by mortal eye. But in process of time seven youths, distinguished  in the war and in the chase, appeared in the environs of the castle of  the demons. They were darker, taller, fiercer, and more resolute than  any of the scattered inhabitants of the valleys of Kurdistan; and they  took to themselves wives, and became fathers of the seven tribes of the  Kurdmans, whose valour is known throughout the universe.\"    The Christian knight heard with wonder the wild tale, of which Kurdistan  still possesses the traces, and, after a moment's thought, replied,  \"Verily, Sir Knight, you have spoken well--your genealogy may be dreaded  and hated, but it cannot be contemned. Neither do I any longer wonder  at your obstinacy in a false faith, since, doubtless, it is part of the  fiendish disposition which hath descended from your ancestors, those  infernal huntsmen, as you have described them, to love falsehood rather  than truth; and I no longer marvel that your spirits become high and  exalted, and vent themselves in verse and in tunes, when you approach to  the places encumbered by the haunting of evil spirits, which must excite  in you that joyous feeling which others experience when approaching the  land of their human ancestry.\"    \"By my father's beard, I think thou hast the right,\" said the Saracen,  rather amused than offended by the freedom with which the Christian had  uttered his reflections; \"for, though the Prophet (blessed be his name!)  hath sown amongst us the seed of a better faith than our ancestors  learned in the ghostly halls of Tugrut, yet we are not willing, like  other Moslemah, to pass hasty doom on the lofty and powerful elementary  spirits from whom we claim our origin. These Genii, according to our  belief and hope, are not altogether reprobate, but are still in the way  of probation, and may hereafter be punished or rewarded. Leave we this  to the mollahs and the imauns. Enough that with us the reverence for  these spirits is not altogether effaced by what we have learned from the  Koran, and that many of us still sing, in memorial of our fathers' more  ancient faith, such verses as these.\"    So saying, he proceeded to chant verses, very ancient in the language  and structure, which some have thought derive their source from the  worshippers of Arimanes, the Evil Principle.                      AHRIMAN.         Dark Ahriman, whom Irak still       Holds origin of woe and ill!       When, bending at thy shrine,       We view the world with troubled eye,       Where see we 'neath the extended sky,       An empire matching thine!         If the Benigner Power can yield       A fountain in the desert field,       Where weary pilgrims drink;       Thine are the waves that lash the rock,       Thine the tornado's deadly shock,       Where countless navies sink!         Or if he bid the soil dispense       Balsams to cheer the sinking sense,       How few can they deliver       From lingering pains, or pang intense,       Red Fever, spotted Pestilence,       The arrows of thy quiver!         Chief in Man's bosom sits thy sway,       And frequent, while in words we pray       Before another throne,       Whate'er of specious form be there,       The secret meaning of the prayer       Is, Ahriman, thine own.         Say, hast thou feeling, sense, and form,       Thunder thy voice, thy garments storm,       As Eastern Magi say;       With sentient soul of hate and wrath,       And wings to sweep thy deadly path,       And fangs to tear thy prey?         Or art thou mix'd in Nature's source,       An ever-operating force,       Converting good to ill;       An evil principle innate,       Contending with our better fate,       And, oh!  victorious still?         Howe'er it be, dispute is vain.       On all without thou hold'st thy reign,       Nor less on all within;       Each mortal passion's fierce career,       Love, hate, ambition, joy, and fear,       Thou goadest into sin.         Whene'er a sunny gleam appears,       To brighten up our vale of tears,       Thou art not distant far;       'Mid such brief solace of our lives,       Thou whett'st our very banquet-knives       To tools of death and war.         Thus, from the moment of our birth,       Long as we linger on the earth,       Thou rulest the fate of men;       Thine are the pangs of life's last hour,       And--who dare answer?--is thy power,       Dark Spirit!  ended THEN?         [The worthy and learned clergyman by whom this species of       hymn has been translated desires, that, for fear of       misconception, we should warn the reader to recollect that       it is composed by a heathen, to whom the real causes of       moral and physical evil are unknown, and who views their       predominance in the system of the universe as all must view       that appalling fact who have not the benefit of the       Christian revelation.  On our own part, we beg to add, that       we understand the style of the translator is more       paraphrastic than can be approved by those who are       acquainted with the singularly curious original.  The       translator seems to have despaired of rendering into English       verse the flights of Oriental poetry; and, possibly, like       many learned and ingenious men, finding it impossible to       discover the sense of the original, he may have tacitly       substituted his own.]    These verses may perhaps have been the not unnatural effusion of some  half-enlightened philosopher, who, in the fabled deity, Arimanes, saw  but the prevalence of moral and physical evil; but in the ears of Sir  Kenneth of the Leopard they had a different effect, and, sung as they  were by one who had just boasted himself a descendant of demons, sounded  very like an address of worship to the arch-fiend himself. He weighed  within himself whether, on hearing such blasphemy in the very desert  where Satan had stood rebuked for demanding homage, taking an abrupt  leave of the Saracen was sufficient to testify his abhorrence; or  whether he was not rather constrained by his vow as a Crusader to defy  the infidel to combat on the spot, and leave him food for the beasts of  the wilderness, when his attention was suddenly caught by an unexpected  apparition.    The light was now verging low, yet served the knight still to discern  that they two were no longer alone in the desert, but were closely  watched by a figure of great height and very thin, which skipped over  rocks and bushes with so much agility as, added to the wild and hirsute  appearance of the individual, reminded him of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13775"],[0,"Every Step in Canning: The Cold-Pack Method (#10)"],[1,"------------------------------------------------------  Class 5--Vegetable Combinations  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  CORN AND TOMATOES    |            |  120  |  120  |  120  |   60  |45, at    Prepare individual |            | (2 hr)| (2 hr)| (2 hr)| (1 hr)|10 lbs.    vegetables and then|            |       |       |       |       |    combine and pack.  |            |       |       |       |       |                       |            |       |       |       |       |  CORN, TOMATOES AND   |            |       |       |       |       |  STRING BEANS         |            |       |       |       |       |    Corn               |      3     |       |       |       |       |    Tomatoes           |   1-1/2    |  120  |  120  |  120  |   60  |45, at    String  beans      |      5     | (2 hr)| (2 hr)| (2 hr)| (1 hr)|10 lbs.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------    Count from time when water begins to boil (bubbles all over).

CHAPTER V    SOUPS      After one has learned how to can fruits and vegetables successfully,  the next thing to attempt is the canning of soups.    Soups may be canned with or without meat. We make one variety which is  a pure vegetable soup. We use no stock or meat, and can it in its own  juice or liquor, thus using no water.    When we wish to use it we dilute it three or four times and serve it  as a vegetable soup or, more frequently, when we have chicken bones or  any meat bones on hand, we add a can of this concentrated vegetable  mixture to the bones and make a delicious stock soup.    I will give this recipe as I have given it to many friends, all of  whom have pronounced it excellent:      1 Peck ripe tomatoes    1 Head cabbage    1 Dozen carrots    1 White turnip    3 Pounds string beans    1 Pound okra    3 Red peppers    1 Peck spinach    2 Pounds asparagus    6 Small beets    6 Ears sweet corn    Scald the tomatoes by placing them in a wire basket and plunging them  into boiling water for one and a half minutes. Cold-dip them  immediately. After removing the core and stem end of the tomato, the  skin slips right off. Save all the tomato juice. Cut the tomatoes into  quarters. Put into a large pail or bucket with the juice. Blanch the  cabbage, carrots, turnip, string beans, okra and sweet red peppers  five minutes. Cold-dip. Of course you blanch and cold-dip each product  separately. Cut each vegetable after it is blanched and cold-dipped  into small cubes and add to the tomatoes.    Spinach must be carefully washed to remove all grit and sand. All  greens must be washed through several waters to cleanse them  thoroughly.    Instead of blanching the spinach in a kettle of boiling water, as we  do the other vegetables, we steam it by placing it in a colander over  boiling water or in a regulation steamer with tightly fitting cover,  such as is used for steaming suet puddings and brown bread. If you can  with a steam-pressure canner or a pressure cooker, then steam the  spinach there. If we boiled the spinach for fifteen or twenty minutes  we would lose a quantity of the mineral salts, the very thing we aim  to get into our systems when we eat spinach, dandelion greens, Swiss  chard and other greens. After the blanching or steaming comes the cold  dip.    There is something about blanching asparagus, either for soups or when  canned alone, that is worth knowing. Instead of blanching the whole  stalk of asparagus for the same length of time, we use a little  discretion, giving the tougher, harder ends a full four minutes'  blanching, but allowing the tender tip ends only two minutes. You are  possibly wondering how that is done.    Tie the asparagus stalks in bunches and put the bunches with all the  tips standing one way on a piece of cheesecloth. Tie the cloth or snap  rubber bands round it, and then stand the asparagus in boiling water  in an upright position for two minutes; next lay the asparagus  lengthwise in the blanching water for another two minutes, and you  have accomplished your purpose. You have given the tougher parts two  minutes' more blanching than the tender parts. Use a deep enough  kettle so the asparagus will be completely covered when laid  lengthwise. After the blanching, cold-dip the asparagus.    Wash the beets. Leave two inches of the top and all the tail on the  beets while blanching. Blanch for five minutes, then cold-dip. Next  scrape off the skin, top and tail. The tops can be put right into the  soup too. Any surplus tops can be steamed with the spinach and can be  treated similarly.    Blanch corn on the cob five minutes. Cold-dip. Cut the corn from the  cob, cutting from tip to butt end. Add the corn to the other  vegetables. Add no water. Pack the mixed vegetables into clean glass  jars; add one level teaspoonful of salt to every jar; partially seal;  cook one hour and a half in wash-boiler or other homemade outfit. At  the end of that period remove jars from canner, seal tight, and the  work is done.    Of course you are interested in the cost of this soup. Most of the  ingredients came right from our garden. We had to buy the okra and the  red peppers, but I figured everything just as if I had to buy it from  the market; and on this basis, the cost of our soup would have been  only seven and a half cents a can. We canned it in tin, using size  Number Two, which is the same as pint size in glass jars.    Another vegetable soup without stock, dried beans and peas being used,  is made as follows:    Soak six pounds of Lima beans and four pounds of dry peas over night.  Boil each thirty minutes. Blanch sixteen pounds of carrots, six pounds  of cabbage, three pounds of celery, six pounds of turnips, four pounds  of okra, one pound of onions, and four pounds of parsley for three  minutes and dip in cold water quickly. Prepare the vegetables and chop  into small cubes. Chop the onions and celery extra fine. Mix all of  them thoroughly and season to taste. Pack in glass jars or tin cans.  Fill with boiling water. Partially seal glass jars. Cap and tip tin  cans. Process ninety minutes if using hot-water-bath outfit or  condensed-steam outfit; sixty minutes if using water-seal outfit or  five-pound steam-pressure outfit; forty-five minutes if using pressure  cooker.    In many homes cream of tomato soup is the favorite. To make this soup  the housewife uses a tomato pulp and combines it with milk and  seasonings. You can can a large number of jars of this pulp and have  it ready for the cream soup. To make and can this pulp follow these  directions:    Tomato Pulp. Place the tomatoes in a wire basket or piece of  cheesecloth and plunge into boiling water for one and a half minutes.  Plunge into cold water. Remove the skins and cores. Place the tomatoes  in a kettle and boil thirty minutes. Pass the tomato pulp through a  sieve. Pack in glass jars while hot and add a level teaspoonful of  salt per quart. Partially seal glass jars. Sterilize twenty minutes if  using hot-water-bath outfit or condensed-steam outfit; eighteen  minutes if using water-seal, or five-pound steam-pressure outfit;  fifteen minutes if using pressure-cooker outfit.    Soup Stock. To make the soup stock which is the foundation of all  the stock soups, use this recipe:    Secure twenty-five pounds of beef hocks, joints and bones containing  marrow. Strip off the fat and meat and crack bones with hatchet or  cleaver. Put the broken bones in a thin cloth sack and place this in a  large kettle containing five gallons of cold water. Simmer--do not  boil--for six or seven hours. Do not salt while simmering. Skim off  all fat. This should make about five gallons of stock. Pack hot in  glass jars, bottles or enameled or lacquered tin cans. Partially seal  glass jars. Cap and tip tin cans. Sterilize forty minutes if using  hot-water-bath outfit or condensed-steam outfit; thirty minutes if  using water-seal or five-pound steam-pressure outfit; twenty-five  minutes if using pressure-cooker outfit.    Soups made with soup stock are many and varied. One can utilize the  things at hand and change the distinctive flavor from year to year. I  will give you a few good specimen recipes which if followed will give  good results:    Vegetable Soup. Soak a quarter pound dried Lima beans and one pound  unpolished rice for twelve hours. Cook a half pound pearl barley for  two hours. Blanch one pound carrots, one pound onions, one medium-size  potato and one red pepper for three minutes and cold-dip. Prepare the  vegetables and cut into small cubes. Mix thoroughly Lima beans, rice,  barley, carrots, onions, potato and red pepper. Fill glass jars or the  enameled tin cans three-fourths full of the above mixture of  vegetables and cereals. Make a smooth paste of a half pound of wheat  flour and blend in five gallons soup stock. Boil three minutes and add  four ounces salt. Pour this stock over vegetables and fill cans.  Partially seal glass jars. Cap and tip tin cans. Sterilize ninety  minutes if using hot-water-bath outfit or condensed-steam outfit;  seventy-five minutes if using a water-seal or five-pound  steam-pressure outfit; forty-five minutes if using pressure-cooker  outfit.    Cream of Pea Soup. Soak eight pounds of dried peas over night. Cook  until soft. Mash fine. Add the mashed peas to five gallons of soup  stock and bring to boil. Pass the boiling liquid through a fine sieve.  Make a smooth paste of a half pound flour and add paste, ten ounces of  sugar and three ounces of salt to the soup stock. Cook until soup  begins to thicken. Pack in glass jars or tin cans. Partially seal  glass jars. Cap and tip tin cans. Process ninety minutes if using  hot-water-bath outfit or condensed-steam outfit; eighty minutes if  using water-seal outfit; seventy minutes if using five-pound  steam-pressure outfit;"]]]
