A slice of bread each and the  wish-wash of a thrice-brewed pennyworth of tea had been their morning  meal, and there was no prospect of dinner. The thought of them made  Moses's heart heavy again; he forgot the _Maggid's_ explanation of the  verse in Habakkuk, and he retraced his steps towards Mordecai Schwartz's  shop. But like his humbler rival, Mordecai had no use for the many-sided  Moses; he was \"full up\" with swarthy \"hands,\" though, as there were  rumors of strikes in the air, he prudently took note of Moses's address.  After this rebuff, Moses shuffled hopelessly about for more than an  hour; the dinner-hour was getting desperately near; already children  passed him, carrying the Sunday dinners from the bakeries, and there  were wafts of vague poetry in the atmosphere. Moses felt he could not  face his own children.    At last he nerved himself to an audacious resolution, and elbowed his  way blusterously towards the Ruins, lest he might break down if his  courage had time to cool.    \"The Ruins\" was a great stony square, partly bordered by houses, and  only picturesque on Sundays when it became a branch of the all-ramifying  Fair. Moses could have bought anything there from elastic braces to  green parrots in gilt cages. That is to say if he had had money. At  present he had nothing in his pocket except holes.    What he might be able to do on his way back was another matter; for it  was Malka that Moses Ansell was going to see. She was the cousin of his  deceased wife, and lived in Zachariah Square. Moses had not been there  for a month, for Malka was a wealthy twig of the family tree, to be  approached with awe and trembling. She kept a second-hand clothes store  in Houndsditch, a supplementary stall in the Halfpenny Exchange, and a  barrow on the \"Ruins\" of a Sunday; and she had set up Ephraim, her  newly-acquired son-in-law, in the same line of business in the same  district. Like most things she dealt in, her son-in-law was second-hand,  having lost his first wife four years ago in Poland. But he was only  twenty-two, and a second-hand son-in-law of twenty-two is superior to  many brand new ones. The two domestic establishments were a few minutes  away from the shops, facing each other diagonally across the square.  They were small, three-roomed houses, without basements, the ground  floor window in each being filled up with a black gauze blind (an  invariable index of gentility) which allowed the occupants to see all  that was passing outside, but confronted gazers with their own  rejections. Passers-by postured at these mirrors, twisting moustaches  perkily, or giving coquettish pats to bonnets, unwitting of the grinning  inhabitants. Most of the doors were ajar, wintry as the air was: for the  Zachariah Squareites lived a good deal on the door-step. In the summer,  the housewives sat outside on chairs and gossiped and knitted, as if the  sea foamed at their feel, and wrinkled good-humored old men played nap  on tea-trays. Some of the doors were blocked below with sliding barriers  of wood, a sure token of infants inside given to straying. More obvious  tokens of child-life were the swings nailed to the lintels of a few  doors, in which, despite the cold, toothless babes swayed like monkeys  on a branch. But the Square, with its broad area of quadrangular  pavement, was an ideal playing-ground for children, since other animals  came not within its precincts, except an inquisitive dog or a local cat.  Solomon Ansell knew no greater privilege than to accompany his father to  these fashionable quarters and whip his humming-top across the ample  spaces, the while Moses transacted his business with Malka. Last time  the business was psalm-saying. Milly had been brought to bed of a son,  but it was doubtful if she would survive, despite the charms hung upon  the bedpost to counteract the nefarious designs of Lilith, the wicked  first wife of Adam, and of the Not-Good Ones who hover about women in  childbirth. So Moses was sent for, post-haste, to intercede with the  Almighty. His piety, it was felt, would command attention. For an  average of three hundred and sixty-two days a year Moses was a miserable  worm, a nonentity, but on the other three, when death threatened to  visit Malka or her little clan, Moses became a personage of prime  importance, and was summoned at all hours of the day and night to  wrestle with the angel Azrael. When the angel had retired, worsted,  after a match sometimes protracted into days, Moses relapsed into his  primitive insignificance, and was dismissed with a mouthful of rum and a  shilling. It never seemed to him an unfair equivalent, for nobody could  make less demand on the universe than Moses. Give him two solid meals  and three solid services a day, and he was satisfied, and he craved more  for spiritual snacks between meals than for physical.    The last crisis had been brief, and there was so little danger that,  when Milly's child was circumcised, Moses had not even been bidden to  the feast, though his piety would have made him the ideal _sandek_ or  god-father. He did not resent this, knowing himself dust--and that  anything but gold-dust.    Moses had hardly emerged from the little arched passage which led to the  Square, when sounds of strife fell upon his ears. Two stout women  chatting amicably at their doors, had suddenly developed a dispute. In  Zachariah Square, when you wanted to get to the bottom of a quarrel, the  cue was not \"find the woman,\" but find the child. The high-spirited  bantlings had a way of pummelling one another in fistic duels, and of  calling in their respective mothers when they got the worse of it--which  is cowardly, but human. The mother of the beaten belligerent would then  threaten to wring the \"year,\" or to twist the nose of the victorious  party--sometimes she did it. In either case, the other mother would  intervene, and then the two bantlings would retire into the background  and leave their mothers to take up the duel while they resumed their  interrupted game.    Of such sort was the squabble betwixt Mrs. Isaacs and Mrs. Jacobs. Mrs.  Isaacs pointed out with superfluous vehemence that her poor lamb had  been mangled beyond recognition. Mrs. Jacobs, _per contra_, asseverated  with superfluous gesture that it was _her_ poor lamb who had received  irreparable injury. These statements were not in mutual contradiction,  but Mrs. Isaacs and Mrs. Jacobs were, and so the point at issue was  gradually absorbed in more personal recriminations.    \"By my life, and by my Fanny's life, I'll leave my seal on the first  child of yours that comes across my way! There!\" Thus Mrs. Isaacs.    \"Lay a linger on a hair of a child of mine, and, by my husband's life,  I'll summons you; I'll have the law on you.\" Thus Mrs. Jacobs; to the  gratification of the resident populace.    Mrs. Isaacs and Mrs. Jacobs rarely quarrelled with each other, uniting  rather in opposition to the rest of the Square. They were English, quite  English, their grandfather having been born in Dresden; and they gave  themselves airs in consequence, and called their _kinder_ \"children,\"  which annoyed those neighbors who found a larger admixture of Yiddish  necessary for conversation. These very _kinder_, again, attained  considerable importance among their school-fellows by refusing to  pronounce the guttural \"ch\" of the Hebrew otherwise than as an English  \"k.\"    \"Summons me, indeed,\" laughed back Mrs. Isaacs. \"A fat lot I'd care for  that. You'd jolly soon expose your character to the magistrate.  Everybody knows what _you_ are.\"    \"Your mother!\" retorted Mrs. Jacobs mechanically; the elliptical method  of expression being greatly in vogue for conversation of a loud  character. Quick as lightning came the parrying stroke.    \"Yah! And what was your father, I should like to know?\"    Mrs. Isaacs had no sooner made this inquiry than she became conscious of  an environment of suppressed laughter; Mrs. Jacobs awoke to the  situation a second later, and the two women stood suddenly dumbfounded,  petrified, with arms akimbo, staring at each other.    The wise, if apocryphal, Ecclesiasticus, sagely and pithily remarked,  many centuries before modern civilization was invented: Jest not with a  rude man lest thy ancestors be disgraced. To this day the oriental  methods of insult have survived in the Ghetto. The dead past is never  allowed to bury its dead; the genealogical dust-heap is always liable to  be raked up, and even innocuous ancestors may be traduced to the third  and fourth generation.    Now it so happened that Mrs. Isaacs and Mrs. Jacobs were sisters. And  when it dawned upon them into what dilemma their automatic methods of  carte and tierce had inveigled them, they were frozen with confusion.  They retired crestfallen to their respective parlors, and sported their  oaks. The resources of repartee were dried up for the moment. Relatives  are unduly handicapped in these verbal duels; especially relatives with  the same mother and father.    Presently Mrs. Isaacs reappeared. She had thought of something she ought  to have said. She went up to her sister's closed door, and shouted into  the key-hole: \"None of my children ever had bandy-legs!\"    Almost immediately the window of the front bedroom was flung up, and  Mrs. Jacobs leant out of it waving what looked like an immense streamer.    \"Aha,\" she observed, dangling it tantalizingly up and down. \"Morry  antique!\"    The dress fluttered in the breeze. Mrs. Jacobs caressed the stuff  between her thumb and forefinger.    \"Aw-aw-aw-aw-aw-awl silk,\" she announced with a long ecstatic quaver.    Mrs. Isaacs stood paralyzed by the brilliancy of the repartee.    Mrs. Jacobs withdrew the moire antique and exhibited a mauve gown.    \"Aw-aw-aw-aw-aw-awl silk.\"    The mauve fluttered for a triumphant instant, the next a puce and amber  dress floated"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1271"],[0,"Bygone Beliefs: Being a Series of Excursions in the Byways of Thought (#10)"],[1,"than when combined with  the grosser part of the vitriol. In the days when there was hardly any  knowledge of chemistry and physics, this theory no doubt bore every  semblance of truth. In passing, however, it is interesting to note  that DIGBY'S _Discourse_ called forth a reply from J. F. HELVETIUS  (or SCHWETTZER, 1625-1709), physician to the Prince of Orange, who  afterwards became celebrated as an alchemist who had achieved the magnum  opus.(1)      (1) See my _Alchemy: Ancient and Modern_ (1911), SESE 63-67.      Writing of the Sympathetic Powder, Professor DE MORGAN wittily argues  that it must have been quite efficacious. He says: \"The directions were  to keep the wound clean and cool, and to take care of diet, rubbing the  salve on the knife or sword. If we remember the dreadful notions upon  drugs which prevailed, both as to quantity and quality, we shall readily  see that any way of NOT dressing the wound would have been useful. If  the physicians had taken the hint, had been careful of diet, _etc_.,  and had poured the little barrels of medicine down the throat of a  practicable doll, THEY would have had their magical cures as well as the  surgeons.\"(2) As Dr PETTIGREW has pointed out,(3) Nature exhibits very  remarkable powers in effecting the healing of wounds by adhesion, when  her processes are not impeded. In fact, many cases have been recorded in  which noses, ears, and fingers severed from the body have been rejoined  thereto, merely by washing the parts, placing them in close continuity,  and allowing the natural powers of the body to effect the healing.  Moreover, in spite of BACON'S remarks on this point, the effect of  the imagination of the patient, who was usually not ignorant that a  sympathetic cure was to be attempted, must be taken into account; for,  without going to the excesses of \"Christian Science\" in this respect,  the fact must be recognised that the state of the mind exercises a  powerful effect on the natural forces of the body, and a firm faith is  undoubtedly helpful in effecting the cure of any sort of ill.

THE BELIEF IN TALISMANS    THE word \"talisman\" is derived from the Arabic \"tilsam,\" \"a magical  image,\" through the plural form \"tilsamen.\" This Arabic word is itself  probably derived from the Greek telesma in its late meaning of \"a  religious mystery\" or \"consecrated object\". The term is often employed  to designate amulets in general, but, correctly speaking, it has a more  restricted and special significance. A talisman may be defined briefly  as an astrological or other symbol expressive of the influence and power  of one of the planets, engraved on a sympathetic stone or metal (or  inscribed on specially prepared parchment) under the auspices of this  planet.    Before proceeding to an account of the preparation of talismans proper,  it will not be out of place to notice some of the more interesting and  curious of other amulets. All sorts of substances have been employed  as charms, sometimes of a very unpleasant nature, such as dried toads.  Generally, however, amulets consist of stones, herbs, or passages from  Sacred Writings written on paper. This latter class are sometimes  called \"characts,\" as an example of which may be mentioned the Jewish  phylacteries.    Every precious stone was supposed to exercise its own peculiar virtue;  for instance, amber was regarded as a good remedy for throat troubles,  and agate was thought to preserve from snake-bites. ELIHU RICH(1) gives  a very full list of stones and their supposed virtues. Each sign of the  zodiac was supposed to have its own particular stone(2) (as shown in the  annexed table), and hence the superstitious though not inartistic custom  of wearing one's birth-                                      Month (com-   Astrological                     mencing 21st   Sign of the Zodiac.              of preceding                          Symbol.   month).

The belief in the occult powers of certain stones  is by no means non-existent at the present day; for even in these  enlightened times there are not wanting those who fear the beautiful  opal, and put their faith in the virtues of New Zealand green-stone.      (1) ELIHU RICH: _The Occult Sciences (Encyclopaedia Metropolitana_,  1855), pp. 348 _et seq_.    (2) With regard to these stones, however, there is much confusion and  difference of opinion. The arrangement adopted in the table here  given is that of CORNELIUS AGRIPPA (_Occult Philosophy_, bk. ii.). A  comparatively recent work, esteemed by modern occultists, namely, _The  Light of Egypt, or the Science of the Soul and the Stars_ (1889), gives  the following scheme:--    {}=Amethyst. {}=Emerald. {}=Diamond. {}=Onyx (Chalcedony).    {}=Agate. {}=Ruby. {}=Topaz. {}=Sapphire (skyblue).    {}=Beryl. {}=Jasper. {}=Carbuncle. {}=Chrysolite.      Common superstitious opinion regarding birth-stones, as reflected, for  example, in the \"lucky birth charms\" exhibited in the windows of the  jewellers' shops, considerably diverges in this matter from the views of  both these authorities. The usual scheme is as follows:--     Jan.=Garnet.       May =Emerald.    Sept.=Sapphire,   Feb.=Amethyst.     June=Agate.      Oct. =Opal.   Mar.=Bloodstone.   July=Ruby.       Nov. =Topaz.   Apr.=Diamond.      Aug.=Sardonyx.   Dec. =Turquoise.      The bloodstone is frequently assigned either to Aries or Scorpio, owing  to its symbolical connection with Mars; and the opal to Cancer, which in  astrology is the constellation of the moon.    Confusion is rendered still worse by the fact that the ancients whilst  in some cases using the same names as ourselves, applied them to  different stones; thus their \"hyacinth\" is our \"sapphire,\" whilst their  \"sapphire\" is our \"lapis lazuli\".      Certain herbs, culled at favourable conjunctions of the planets and worn  as amulets, were held to be very efficacious against various diseases.  Precious stones and metals were also taken internally for the same  purpose--\"remedies\" which in certain cases must have proved exceedingly  harmful. One theory put forward for the supposed medical value of  amulets was the Doctrine of Effluvia. This theory supposes the amulets  to give off vapours or effluvia which penetrate into the body and effect  a cure. It is, of course, true that certain herbs, _etc_., might, under  the heat of the body, give off such effluvia, but the theory on the  whole is manifestly absurd. The Doctrine of Signatures, which we have  already encountered in our excursions,(1) may also be mentioned in this  connection as a complementary and equally untenable hypothesis.    According to ELIHU RICH,(2) the following were the commonest Egyptian  amulets:--      1. Those inscribed with the figure of _Serapis_, used to preserve  against evils inflicted by earth.    2. Figure of _Canopus_, against evil by water.    3. Figure of a _hawk_, against evil from the air.    4. Figure of an _asp_, against evil by fire.      PARACELSUS believed there to be much occult virtue in an alloy of  the seven chief metals, which he called _Electrum_. Certain definite  proportions of these metals had to be taken, and each was to be added  during a favourable conjunction of the planets. From this electrum he  supposed that valuable amulets and magic mirrors could be prepared.      (1) See \"Medicine and Magic.\" (2) _Op. Cit_., p. 343      A curious and ancient amulet for the cure of various diseases,  particularly the ague, was a triangle formed of the letters of the word  \"Abracadabra.\" The usual form was that shown in fig. 19, and that shown  in fig. 20 was also known. The origin of this magical word is lost in  obscurity.    The belief in the horn as a powerful amulet, especially prevalent in  Italy, where is it the custom of the common people to make the sign of  the _mano cornuto_ to avoid the consequence of the dreaded _jettatore_  or evil eye, can be traced to the fact that the horn was the symbol  of the Goddess of the Moon. Probably the belief in the powers of the  horse-shoe had a similar origin. Indeed, it seems likely that not only  this, but most other amulets, like talismans proper--as will appear  below,--were originally designed as appeals to gods and other powerful  spiritual beings.           \\ ABRACADABRA          /      \\ ABRACADABRA |        \\ ABRACADABR         /        \\ BRACADABRA |         \\ ABRACADAB        /          \\ RACADABRA |          \\ ABRACADA       /            \\ ACADABRA |           \\ ABRACAD      /              \\ CADABRA |            \\ ABRACA     /                \\ ADABRA |             \\ ABRAC    /                  \\ DABRA |              \\ ABRA   /                    \\ ABRA |               \\ ABR  /                      \\ BRA |                \\ AB /                        \\ RA |                 \\ A/                          \\ A |                  \\/                            \\  |      (1) See FREDERICK T.
