This vast congeries of volitions,  interests, and activities, constitute the instruments and means of the  World-Spirit for attaining its object, bringing it to consciousness and  realizing it. And this aim is none other than finding itself--coming to  itself--and contemplating itself in concrete actuality. But that those  manifestations of vitality on the part of individuals and peoples, in  which they seek and satisfy their own purposes, are, at the same time,  the means and instruments of a higher and broader purpose of which they  know nothing-which they realize unconsciously might be made a matter of  question-rather has been questioned, and, in every variety of form,  negatived, decried, and contemned as mere dreaming and \"philosophy.\" But  on this point I announced my view at the very outset and asserted our  hypothesis--which, however, will appear in the sequel in the form of a  legitimate inference--and our belief that Reason governs the world and  has consequently governed its history. In relation to this independently  universal and substantial existence all else is subordinate, subservient  to it, and the means for its development. The union of universal  abstract existence generally with the individual--the subjective--that  this alone is truth belongs to the department of speculation and is  treated in this general form in logic. But in the process of the world's  history itself--as still incomplete--the abstract final aim of history  is not yet made the distinct object of desire and interest. While these  limited sentiments are still unconscious of the purpose they are  fulfilling, the universal principle is implicit in them and is realizing  itself through them. The question also assumes the form of the union of  freedom and necessity, the latent abstract process of Spirit being  regarded as necessity, while that which exhibits itself in the conscious  will of men, as their interest, belongs to the domain of freedom. As the  metaphysical connection (i. e., the connection in the Idea) of these  forms of thought, belongs to logic, it would be out of place to analyze  it here. The chief and cardinal points only shall be mentioned.    Philosophy shows that the Idea advances to an infinite antithesis--that,  namely, between the Idea in its free, universal form, in which it exists  for itself, and the contrasted form of abstract introversion, reflection  on itself, which is formal existence-for-self, personality, formal  freedom, such as belongs to Spirit only. The universal Idea exists thus  as the substantial totality of things on the one side, and as the  abstract essence of free volition on the other. This reflection of the  mind on itself is individual self-consciousness--the polar-opposite of  the Idea in its general form and therefore existing in absolute  limitation. This polar-opposite is consequently limitation,  particularization for the universal absolute being; it is the side of  the definite existence, the sphere of its formal reality, the sphere of  the reverence paid to God. To comprehend the absolute connection of this  antithesis is the profound task of metaphysics. This limitation  originates all forms of particularity of whatever kind. The formal  volition (of which we have spoken) wills itself and desires to make its  own personality valid in all that it purposes and does; even the pious  individual wishes to be saved and happy. This pole of the antithesis,  existing for itself, is--in contrast with the Absolute Universal  Being--a special separate existence, taking cognizance of speciality  only and willing that alone. In short, it plays its part in the region  of mere phenomena. This is the sphere of particular purposes, in  effecting which individuals exert themselves on behalf of their  individuality--give it full play and objective realization. This is also  the sphere of happiness and its opposite. He is happy who finds his  condition suited to his special character, will, and fancy, and so  enjoys himself in that condition. The history of the world is not the  theatre of happiness. Periods of happiness are blank pages in it, for  they are periods of harmony--periods when the antithesis is in abeyance.  Reflection of self--the freedom above described--is abstractly defined  as the formal element of the activity of the absolute Idea. The  realizing activity of which we have spoken is the middle term of the  syllogism, one of whose extremes is the universal essence, the _Idea_,  which reposes in the penetralia of Spirit; and the other, the complex of  external things--objective matter. That activity is the medium by which  the universal latent principle is translated into the domain of  objectivity.    I will endeavor to make what has been said more vivid and clear by  examples. The building of a house is, in the first instance, a  subjective aim and design. On the other hand we have, as means, the  several substances required for the work--iron, wood, stones. The  elements are made use of in working up this material--fire to melt the  iron, wind to blow the fire, water to set the wheels in motion in order  to cut the wood, etc. The result is that the wind, which has helped to  build the house, is shut out by the house; so also are the violence of  rains and floods and the destructive powers of fire, so far as the house  is made fire-proof. The stones and beams obey the law of gravity--press  downward--and so high walls are carried up. Thus the elements are made  use of in accordance with their nature, and yet are made to cooeperate  for a product by which their operation is limited. It is thus that the  passions of men are gratified; they develop themselves and their aims in  accordance with their natural tendencies and build up the edifice of  human society, thus fortifying a position for Right and Order _against  themselves_.    The connection of events above indicated involves also the fact that, in  history, an additional result is commonly produced by human actions  beyond what they aim at and obtain what they immediately recognize and  desire. They gratify their own interest; but something further is  thereby accomplished, latent in the actions in question, though not  present to their consciousness and not included in their design. An  analogous example is offered in the case of a man who, from a feeling of  revenge--perhaps not an unjust one, but produced by injury on the  other's part--burns that other man's house. A connection is immediately  established between the deed itself, taken abstractly, and a train of  circumstances not directly included in it. In itself it consisted in  merely bringing a small flame into contact with a small portion of a  beam. Events not involved in that simple act follow of themselves. The  part of the beam which was set afire is connected with its remote  portions, the beam itself is united with the woodwork of the house  generally, and this with other houses, so that a wide conflagration  ensues which destroys the goods and chattels of many other persons  besides those belonging to the person against whom the act of revenge  was first directed, perhaps even costs not a few men their lives. This  lay neither in the deed intrinsically nor in the design of the man who  committed it. But the action has a further general bearing. In the  design of the doer it was only revenge executed against an individual in  the destruction of his property, but it is, moreover, a crime, and that  involves punishment also. This may not have been present to the mind of  the perpetrator, still less in his intention; but his deed itself, the  general principles it calls into play, its substantial content, entail  it. By this example I wish only to impress on you the consideration  that, in a simple act, something further may be implicated than lies in  the intention and consciousness of the agent. The example before us  involves, however, the additional consideration that the substance of  the act, consequently, we may say, the act itself, recoils upon the  perpetrator--reacts upon him with destructive tendency. This union of  the two extremes--the embodiment of a general idea in the form of direct  reality and the elevation of a speciality into connection with universal  truth--is brought to pass, at first sight, under the conditions of an  utter diversity of nature between the two and an indifference of the one  extreme toward the other. The aims which the agents set before them are  limited and special; but it must be remarked that the agents themselves  are intelligent thinking beings. The purport of their desires is  interwoven with general, essential considerations of justice, good,  duty, etc.; for mere desire--volition in its rough and savage  forms--falls not within the scene and sphere of universal history. Those  general considerations, which form at the same time a norm for directing  aims and actions, have a determinate purport; for such an abstraction  as \"good for its own sake,\" has no place in living reality. If men are  to act they must not only intend the Good, but must have decided for  themselves whether this or that particular thing is a good. What special  course of action, however, is good or not, is determined, as regards the  ordinary contingencies of private life, by the laws and customs of a  State; and here no great difficulty is presented. Each individual has  his position; he knows, on the whole, what a just, honorable course of  conduct is. As to ordinary, private relations, the assertion that it is  difficult to choose the right and good--the regarding it as the mark of  an exalted morality to find difficulties and raise scruples on that  score--may be set down to an evil or perverse will, which seeks to evade  duties not in themselves of a perplexing nature, or, at any rate, to an  idly reflective habit of mind--where "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12380"],[0,"Two Thousand Miles on an Automobile (#10)"],[1,"arrow, and  poor--by no means fit for the proposed Erie-Buffalo race. About  fifteen miles out there is a sharp turn to the left and down a  steep incline with a ravine and stream below on the right,--a  dangerous turn at twenty miles an hour, to say nothing of forty or  fifty.    There is nothing to indicate that the road drops so suddenly after  making the turn, and we were bowling along at top speed; a wagon  coming around the corner threw us well to the outside, so that the  margin of safety was reduced to a minimum, even if the turn were  an easy one.    As we swung around the corner well over to the edge of the ravine,  we saw the grade we had to make. Nothing but a succession of small  rain gullies in the road saved us from going down the bank. By so  steering as to drop the skidding wheels on the outside into each  gully, the sliding of the machine received a series of violent  checks and we missed the brink of the ravine by a few inches.    A layman in the Professor's place would have jumped; but he, good  man, looked upon his escape as one of the incidents of automobile  travel.    \"When I accepted your invitation, my dear fellow, I expected  something beyond the ordinary. I have not been disappointed.\"    It was a wonder the driving-wheels were not dished by the violent  side strains, but they were not even sprung. These wheels were of  wire tangential spokes; they do not look so well as the smart,  heavy, substantial wooden wheels one sees on nearly all imported  machines and on some American.    The sense of proportion between parts is sadly outraged by  spindle-wire wheels supporting the massive frame-work and body of  an automobile; however strong they may be in reality,  architecturally they are quite unfit, and no doubt the wooden  wheel will come more and more into general use.    A wooden wheel with the best of hickory spokes possesses an  elasticity entirely foreign to the rigid wire wheel, but good  hickory wheels are rare; paint hides a multitude of sins when  spread over wood; and inferior wooden wheels are not at all to be  relied upon.    Soon we begin to catch glimpses of Lake Erie through the trees and  between the hills, just a blue expanse of water shining in the  morning sun, a sapphire set in the dull brown gold of woods and  fields. Farther on we come out upon the bluffs overlooking the  lake and see the smoke and grime of Buffalo far across. What a  blot on a view so beautiful!    \"Civilization,\" said the Professor, \"is the subjection of nature.  In the civilization of Athens nature was subdued to the ends of  beauty; in the civilization of America nature is subdued to the  ends of usefulness; in every civilization nature is of secondary  importance, it is but a means to an end. Nature and the savage,  like little children, go hand in hand, the one the complement of  the other; but the savage grows and grows, while nature remains  ever a child, to sink subservient at last to its early playmate.  Just now we in this country are treating nature with great  harshness, making of her a drudge and a slave; her pretty hands  are soiled, her clean face covered with soot, her clothing  tattered and torn. Some day, we as a nation will tire of playing  the taskmaster and will treat the playmate of man's infancy and  youth with more consideration; we will adorn and not disfigure  her, love and not ignore her, place her on a throne beside us,  make her queen to our kingship.\"    \"Professor, the automobile hardly falls in with your notions.\"    \"On the contrary, the automobile is the one absolutely fit  conveyance for America. It is a noisy, dirty, mechanical  contrivance, capable of great speed; it is the only vehicle in  which one could approach that distant smudge on the landscape with  any sense of the eternal fitness of things. A coach and four would  be as far behind the times on this highway as a birch-bark canoe  on yonder lake. In America an automobile is beautiful because it  is in perfect harmony with the spirit of the age and country; it  is twin brother to the trolley; train, trolley, and automobile may  travel side by side as members of one family, late offsprings of  man's ingenuity.\"    \"But you would not call them things of beauty?\"    \"Yes and no; beauty is so largely relative that one cannot  pronounce hideous anything that is a logical and legitimate  development. Considered in the light of things the world  pronounces beautiful, there are no more hideous monstrosities on  the face of the earth than train, trolley, and automobile; but  each generation has its own standard of beauty, though it seldom  confesses it. We say and actually persuade ourselves that we  admire the Parthenon; in reality we admire the mammoth factory and  the thirty-story office building. Strive as we may to deceive  ourselves by loud protestations, our standards are not the  standards of old. We like best the things we have; we may call  things ugly, but we think them beautiful, for they are part of  us,--and the automobile fits into our surroundings like a pocket  in a coat. We may turn up our noses at it or away from it, as the  case may be, but none the less it is the perambulator of the  twentieth century.\"    It was exactly one o'clock when we pulled up near the City Hall.  Total time from Erie five hours and fifty minutes, actual running  time five hours, distance by road about ninety-four miles.          CHAPTER SIX BUFFALO  THE MIDWAY    Housing the machine in a convenient and well-appointed stable for  automobiles, we were reminded of the fact that we had arrived in  Buffalo at no ordinary time, by a charge of three dollars per  night for storage, with everything else extra. But was it not the  Exposition we had come to see? and are not Expositions  proverbially expensive--to promoters and stockholders as well as  visitors?    Then, too, the hotels of Buffalo had expected so much and were so  woefully disappointed. Vast arrays of figures had been compiled  showing that within a radius of four hundred miles of Buffalo  lived all the people in the United States who were worth knowing.  The statistics were not without their foundation in fact, but  therein lay the weakness of the entire scheme so far as hotels  were concerned; people lived so near they could leave home in the  morning with a boiled egg and a sandwich, see the Exposition and  get back at night. Travellers passing through would stop over  during the day and evening, then go their way on a midnight  train,--it was cheaper to ride in a Pullman than stay in Buffalo.    We might have taken rooms at Rochester, running back and forth  each day in the machine,--though Rochester was by no means beyond  the zone of exorbitant charges. Notions of value become very much  congested within a radius of two or three hundred miles of any  great Exposition.    The Exposition was well worth seeing in parts by day and as a  whole by night. The electrical display at night was a triumph of  engineering skill and architectural arrangement. It was the falls  of Niagara turned into stars, the mist of the mighty cascade  crystallized into jewels, a brilliant crown to man's triumph over  the forces of nature.    It was a wonderful and never-to-be-forgotten sight to sit by the  waters at night, as the shadows were folding the buildings in  their soft embrace, and see the first faint twinklings of the  thousands upon thousands of lights as the great current of  electricity was turned slowly on; and then to see the lights grow  in strength until the entire grounds were bathed in suffused  radiance,--that was as wonderful a sight as the world of  electricity has yet witnessed, and it was well worth crossing an  ocean to see; it was the one conspicuous success, the one  memorable feature of the Exposition, and compared with it all  exhibits and scenes by day were tame and insipid.    From time immemorial it has been the special province of the  preacher to take the children to the circus and the side show; for  the children must go, and who so fit to take them as the preacher?  After all, is not the sawdust ring with its strange people, its  giants, fairies, hobgoblins, and clowns, a fairy land, not really  real, and therefore no more wicked than fairy land? Do they not  fly by night? are they not children of space? the enormous tents  spring up like mushrooms, to last a day; for a few short hours  there is a medley of strange sounds,--a blare of trumpets, the  roar of strange beasts, the ring of strange voices, the crackling  of whips; there are prancing steeds and figures in costumes  curious,--then, flapping of canvas, creaking of poles, and all is  silent. Of course it is not real, and every one may go. The circus  has no annals, knows no gossip, presents no problems; it is  without morals and therefore not immoral. It is the one joyous  amusement that is not above, but quite outside the pale of  criticism and discussion. Therefore, why should not the preacher  go and take the children?    But the Midway. Ah! the Midway, that is quite a different matter;  but still the preacher goes,--leaving the children at home.    Learning is ever curious. The Professor, after walking patiently  through several of the buildings and admiring impartially sections  of trees from Cuba and plates of apples from Wyoming, modestly  expressed a desire for some relaxation.    \"The Midway is something more than a feature, it is an element. It  is the laugh that follows the tears; the joke that relieves the  tension; the Greeks invariably produced a comedy with their  tragedies; human nature demands relaxation; to appreciate the  serious, the humorous is absolutely essential. If the Midway were  not on the grounds the people would find it outside. Capacity for  serious contemplation differs with different peoples and in  different ages,--under Cromwell it was at a maximum, under Charles  II. it was at a minimum; the Puritans suppressed the laughter of a  nation; it broke out"]]]
