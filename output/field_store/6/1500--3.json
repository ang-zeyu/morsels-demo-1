Since the first edition of this work was published Mr. Stuart has arrived  in England, and at a recent meeting of the Geographical Society he  announced that, taking advantage of his privilege as a discoverer, he had  christened the rich tract of country which he has opened up to the South  Australians Alexandra Land.    December 1st, 1864.      PREFACE BY THE EDITOR.    The explorations of Mr. John McDouall Stuart may truly be said, without  disparaging his brother explorers, to be amongst the most important in  the history of Australian discovery. In 1844 he gained his first  experiences under the guidance of that distinguished explorer, Captain  Sturt, whose expedition he accompanied in the capacity of draughtsman.  Leaving Lake Torrens on the left, Captain Sturt and his party passed up  the Murray and the Darling, until finding that the latter would carry him  too far from the northern course, which was the one he had marked out for  himself, he turned up a small tributary known to the natives as the  Williorara. The water of this stream failing him, he pushed on over a  barren tract, until he suddenly came upon a fruitful and well-watered  spot, which he named the Rocky Glen. In this picturesque glen they were  detained for six months, during which time no rain fell. The heat of the  sun was so intense that every screw in their boxes was drawn, and all  horn handles and combs split into fine laminae. The lead dropped from  their pencils, their finger-nails became as brittle as glass, and their  hair, and the wool on their sheep, ceased to grow. Scurvy attacked them  all, and Mr. Poole, the second in command, died. In order to avoid the  scorching rays of the sun, they had excavated an underground chamber, to  which they retired during the heat of the day.    When the long-expected rain fell, they pushed on for fifty miles to  another suitable halting-place, which was called Park Depot. From this  depot Captain Sturt made two attempts to reach the Centre of the  continent. He started, accompanied by four of his party, advancing over a  country which resembled an ocean whose mighty billows, fifty or sixty  feet high, had become suddenly hardened into long parallel ridges of  solid sand. The abrupt termination of this was succeeded at two hundred  miles by what is now so well known as Sturt's Stony Desert, to which  frequent allusion is made by Mr. Stuart in his journals. After thirty  miles more, this stony desert ceased with equal abruptness, and was  followed by a vast plain of dried mud, which Captain Sturt describes as  \"a boundless ploughed field, on which floods had settled and subsided.\"  After advancing two hundred miles beyond the Stony Desert, and to within  one hundred and fifty miles of the Centre of the continent, they were  compelled to return to Park Depot, where they arrived in a most exhausted  condition.    A short rest at the Depot was followed by another expedition, Captain  Sturt being on this occasion accompanied by Mr. Stuart and two men. The  seventh day of their journey brought them to the banks of a fine creek,  now so well known as Cooper Creek in connection with the fate of those  unfortunate explorers, Burke and Wills. At two hundred miles from Cooper  Creek Captain Sturt and his party were again met by the Stony Desert, but  slightly varied in its aspect. Before abandoning his attempt to proceed,  the leader of the expedition laid the matter before his companions, and  he writes as follows: \"I should be doing an injustice to Mr. Stuart and  my men, if I did not here mention that I told them the position we were  placed in, and the chance on which our safety would depend if we went on.  They might well have been excused if they expressed an opinion contrary  to such a course; but the only reply they made me was to assure me that  they were ready and willing to follow me to the last.\"    With much reluctance, however, Captain Sturt determined to return to  Cooper Creek without delay. They travelled night and day without  interruption, and on the morning of their arrival at the creek, one of  those terrible hot north winds, so much dreaded by the colonists, began  to blow with unusual violence. Lucky was it for them that it had not  overtaken them in the Desert, for they could scarcely have survived it.  The heat was awful; a thermometer, graduated to 127 degrees, burst,  though sheltered in the fork of a large tree, and their skin was  blistered by a torrent of fine sand, which was driven along by the fury  of the hurricane. They still had fearful difficulties to encounter, but  after an absence of nineteen months they returned safely to Adelaide.    The discouraging account of the interior which was brought by Captain  Sturt did not prevent other explorers from making further attempts; but  the terrible fate of Kennedy and his party on York Peninsula, and the  utter disappearance of Leichardt's expedition, both in the same year  (1848), had a very decided influence in checking the progress of  Australian exploration. Seven years later, in 1855, Mr. Gregory landed on  the north-west coast for the purpose of exploring the Victoria River, and  after penetrating as far south as latitude 20 degrees 16 minutes,  longitude 131 degrees 44 minutes, he was compelled to proceed to the head  of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and thence to Sydney along the route taken by  Dr. Leichardt in 1844. Shortly after his return Mr. Gregory was  despatched by the Government of New South Wales in 1857, to find, if  possible, some trace of the lost expedition of the lamented Leichardt;  his efforts, however, did nothing to clear up the mystery that enshrouds  the fate of that celebrated explorer.* (* It is possible that Mr.  McKinlay has been hasty in the opinion he formed from the graves and  remains of white men shown to him by Keri Keri, and the story related of  their massacre. May they not belong to Leichardt's party?)    The colonists of South Australia have always been distinguished for  promoting by private aid and public grant the cause of exploration. They  usually kept somebody in the field, whose discoveries were intended to  throw light on the caprices of Lake Torrens, at one time a vast inland  sea, at another a dry desert of stones and baked mud. Hack, Warburton,  Freeling, Babbage, and other well-known names, are associated with this  particular district, and, in 1858, Stuart started to the north-west of  the same country, accompanied by one white man (Forster) and a native. In  this, the first expedition which he had the honour to command, he was  aided solely by his friend Mr. William Finke, but in his later journeys  Mr. James Chambers also bore a share of the expense.* (* It is greatly to  be regretted that both these gentlemen are since dead. Mr. Chambers did  not survive to witness the success of his friend's later expeditions, and  the news of Mr. Finke's death reached us while these sheets were going  through the press.) This journey was commenced in May, 1858, from Mount  Eyre in the north to Denial and Streaky Bays on the west coast of the  Port Lincoln country. On this journey Mr. Stuart accomplished one of the  most arduous feats in all his travels, having, with one man only (the  black having basely deserted them), pushed through a long tract of dense  scrub and sand with unusual rapidity, thus saving his own life and that  of his companion. During this part of the journey they were without food  or water, and his companion was thoroughly dispirited and despairing of  success. This expedition occupied him till September, 1858, and was  undertaken with the object of examining the country for runs. On his  return the South Australian Government presented him with a large grant  of land in the district which he had explored.    Mr. Stuart now turned his attention to crossing the interior, and, with  the assistance of his friends Messrs. Chambers and Finke, he was enabled  to make two preparatory expeditions in the vicinity of Lake Torrens--from  April 2nd to July 3rd, 1859, and from November 4th, 1859, to January  21st, 1860. The fourth expedition started from Chambers Creek (discovered  by Mr. Stuart in 1858, and since treated as his head-quarters for  exploring purposes), on March 2nd, 1860, and consisted of Mr. Stuart and  two men, with thirteen horses. Proceeding steadily northwards, until the  country which his previous explorations had rendered familiar was left  far behind, on April 23rd the great explorer calmly records in his  Journal the following important announcement: \"To-day I find from my  observations of the sun that I am now camped in the CENTRE OF AUSTRALIA.\"  One of the greatest problems of Australian discovery was solved! The  Centre of the continent was reached, and, instead of being an  inhospitable desert or an inland sea, it was a splendid grass country  through which ran numerous watercourses.    Leaving the Centre, a north-westerly course was followed, but, after  various repulses, a north-easterly course eventually carried the party as  far as latitude 18 degrees 47 minutes south, longitude 134 degrees, when  they were driven back by the hostility of the natives. As has already  been stated, Mr. Gregory in 1855, starting from the north-west coast, had  penetrated to the south as low as latitude 20 degrees 16 minutes,  longitude 127 degrees 35 minutes. Mr. Stuart had now reached a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8914"],[0,"England, My England (#1)"],[1,"ENGLAND, MY ENGLAND                                       BY                               D.

He had cut the rough  turf and bracken, leaving the grey, dryish soil bare. But he was worried  because he could not get the path straight, there was a pleat between his  brows. He had set up his sticks, and taken the sights between the big  pine trees, but for some reason everything seemed wrong. He looked again,  straining his keen blue eyes, that had a touch of the Viking in them,  through the shadowy pine trees as through a doorway, at the green-grassed  garden-path rising from the shadow of alders by the log bridge up to the  sunlit flowers. Tall white and purple columbines, and the butt-end of the  old Hampshire cottage that crouched near the earth amid flowers,  blossoming in the bit of shaggy wildness round about.    There was a sound of children's voices calling and talking: high,  childish, girlish voices, slightly didactic and tinged with domineering:  'If you don't come quick, nurse, I shall run out there to where there are  snakes.' And nobody had the _sangfroid_ to reply: 'Run then, little  fool.' It was always, 'No, darling. Very well, darling. In a moment,  darling. Darling, you _must_ be patient.'    His heart was hard with disillusion: a continual gnawing and resistance.  But he worked on. What was there to do but submit!    The sunlight blazed down upon the earth, there was a vividness of flamy  vegetation, of fierce seclusion amid the savage peace of the commons.  Strange how the savage England lingers in patches: as here, amid these  shaggy gorse commons, and marshy, snake infested places near the foot of  the south downs. The spirit of place lingering on primeval, as when the  Saxons came, so long ago.    Ah, how he had loved it! The green garden path, the tufts of flowers,  purple and white columbines, and great oriental red poppies with their  black chaps and mulleins tall and yellow, this flamy garden which had  been a garden for a thousand years, scooped out in the little hollow  among the snake-infested commons. He had made it flame with flowers, in a  sun cup under its hedges and trees. So old, so old a place! And yet he  had re-created it.    The timbered cottage with its sloping, cloak-like roof was old and  forgotten. It belonged to the old England of hamlets and yeomen. Lost  all alone on the edge of the common, at the end of a wide, grassy,  briar-entangled lane shaded with oak, it had never known the world of  today. Not till Egbert came with his bride. And he had come to fill it  with flowers.    The house was ancient and very uncomfortable. But he did not want to  alter it. Ah, marvellous to sit there in the wide, black, time-old  chimney, at night when the wind roared overhead, and the wood which he  had chopped himself sputtered on the hearth! Himself on one side the  angle, and Winifred on the other.    Ah, how he had wanted her: Winifred! She was young and beautiful and  strong with life, like a flame in sunshine. She moved with a slow grace  of energy like a blossoming, red-flowered bush in motion. She, too,  seemed to come out of the old England, ruddy, strong, with a certain  crude, passionate quiescence and a hawthorn robustness. And he, he was  tall and slim and agile, like an English archer with his long supple legs  and fine movements. Her hair was nut-brown and all in energic curls and  tendrils. Her eyes were nut-brown, too, like a robin's for brightness.  And he was white-skinned with fine, silky hair that had darkened from  fair, and a slightly arched nose of an old country family. They were a  beautiful couple.    The house was Winifred's. Her father was a man of energy, too. He had  come from the north poor. Now he was moderately rich. He had bought this  fair stretch of inexpensive land, down in Hampshire. Not far from the  tiny church of the almost extinct hamlet stood his own house, a  commodious old farmhouse standing back from the road across a bare  grassed yard. On one side of this quadrangle was the long, long barn or  shed which he had made into a cottage for his youngest daughter  Priscilla. One saw little blue-and-white check curtains at the long  windows, and inside, overhead, the grand old timbers of the high-pitched  shed. This was Prissy's house. Fifty yards away was the pretty little new  cottage which he had built for his daughter Magdalen, with the vegetable  garden stretching away to the oak copse. And then away beyond the lawns  and rose trees of the house-garden went the track across a shaggy, wild  grass space, towards the ridge of tall black pines that grew on a  dyke-bank, through the pines and above the sloping little bog, under the  wide, desolate oak trees, till there was Winifred's cottage crouching  unexpectedly in front, so much alone, and so primitive.    It was Winifred's own house, and the gardens and the bit of common and  the boggy slope were hers: her tiny domain. She had married just at the  time when her father had bought the estate, about ten years before the  war, so she had been able to come to Egbert with this for a marriage  portion. And who was more delighted, he or she, it would be hard to say.  She was only twenty at the time, and he was only twenty-one. He had about  a hundred and fifty pounds a year of his own--and nothing else but his  very considerable personal attractions. He had no profession: he earned  nothing. But he talked of literature and music, he had a passion for  old folk-music, collecting folk-songs and folk-dances, studying the  Morris-dance and the old customs. Of course in time he would make money  in these ways.    Meanwhile youth and health and passion and promise. Winifred's father was  always generous: but still, he was a man from the north with a hard head  and a hard skin too, having received a good many knocks. At home he kept  the hard head out of sight, and played at poetry and romance with his  literary wife and his sturdy, passionate girls. He was a man of courage,  not given to complaining, bearing his burdens by himself. No, he did not  let the world intrude far into his home. He had a delicate, sensitive  wife whose poetry won some fame in the narrow world of letters. He  himself, with his tough old barbarian fighting spirit, had an almost  child-like delight in verse, in sweet poetry, and in the delightful game  of a cultured home. His blood was strong even to coarseness. But that  only made the home more vigorous, more robust and Christmassy. There was  always a touch of Christmas about him, now he was well off. If there was  poetry after dinner, there were also chocolates and nuts, and good little  out-of-the-way things to be munching.    Well then, into this family came Egbert. He was made of quite a different  paste. The girls and the father were strong-limbed, thick-blooded people,  true English, as holly-trees and hawthorn are English. Their culture was  grafted on to them, as one might perhaps graft a common pink rose on to a  thornstem. It flowered oddly enough, but it did not alter their blood.    And Egbert was a born rose. The age-long breeding had left him with a  delightful spontaneous passion. He was not clever, nor even 'literary'.  No, but the intonation of his voice, and the movement of his supple,  handsome body, and the fine texture of his flesh and his hair, the slight  arch of his nose, the quickness of his blue eyes would easily take the  place of poetry. Winifred loved him, loved him, this southerner, as a  higher being. A _higher_ being, mind you. Not a deeper. And as for him,  he loved her in passion with every fibre of him. She was the very warm  stuff of life to him.    Wonderful then, those days at Crockham Cottage, the first days, all alone  save for the woman who came to work in the mornings. Marvellous days,  when she had all his tall, supple, fine-fleshed youth to herself, for  herself, and he had her like a ruddy fire into which he could cast  himself for rejuvenation. Ah, that it might never end, this passion, this  marriage! The flame of their two bodies burnt again into that old  cottage, that was haunted already by so much by-gone, physical desire.  You could not be in the dark room for an hour without the influences  coming over you. The hot blood-desire of by-gone yeomen, there in this  old den where they had lusted and bred for so many generations. The  silent house, dark, with thick, timbered walls and the big black  chimney-place, and the sense of secrecy. Dark, with low, little windows,  sunk into the earth. Dark, like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and  mated, lonely at night and lonely by day, left to themselves and their  own intensity for so many generations. It seemed to cast a spell on the  two young people. They became different. There was a curious secret glow  about them, a certain slumbering flame hard to understand, that enveloped  them both. They too felt that they did not belong to the London world any  more. Crockham had changed their blood: the sense of the snakes that  lived and slept even in their own garden, in the sun, so that he, going  forward with the spade, would see a curious coiled brownish pile on the  black soil, which suddenly would start up, hiss, and dazzle rapidly away,  hissing. One day Winifred heard the strangest scream from the flower-bed  under the low window of the living room: ah, the strangest scream, like  the very soul of the dark past crying aloud. She ran out, and saw a long  brown snake on the flower-bed, and in its flat mouth the"]]]
