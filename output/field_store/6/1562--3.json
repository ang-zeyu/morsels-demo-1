We have tried also to discover  whether the number of leaves each year has any relation to growth. I  cannot see that it has, but it requires many experiments to determine  these points. To study this, make tables of the number of leaves on the  branch each year. I think teachers would find it interesting to keep all  data of this kind of work done by their classes, with a view to tabulation  and comparison. The scholars themselves are exceedingly interested in  anything that partakes of the nature of an original investigation.[1]    [Footnote 1: The class, previously mentioned, were much interested in the  addition of their results. One of them asked me whether this subject of  measurements had been treated in any book. I replied that I had never seen  it mentioned. My attention was afterwards called to \"What may be learned  from a Tree,\" by Prof. Harlan Couitas. D. Appleton & Co., New York, 1863.  I found, greatly to my surprise, that he had not only given diagrams of  growth, but that he also had selected a Copper Beech as his example.]    The leaf-arrangement of the Beech is alternate, on the one-half plan. The  small twigs turn upwards, so that all the spray is on the upper side,  giving a flat appearance to the branch.[1] This gives the leaves a better  exposure to the light. Both the terminal and axillary buds grow freely,  thus forming long, straight limbs, with many branches and much fine spray.    [Footnote 1: Phyllotaxy is treated later, by a comparison and study of  many branches, but the teacher can draw the pupils' attention to the fact  that each Beech leaf and twig is on exactly the opposite side of the  branch from the preceding one. This allows all the twigs to grow towards  one side of the branch, whereas in trees on the two-fifths plan, as the  Apple, Poplar, Oak, etc., no such regularity would be possible, on account  of their many different angles with the stem.]    The bark of the Beech is beautifully smooth. The extreme straightness of  the trunk and limbs is very striking, and may be compared to the crooked  limbs of the Horsechestnut, where the branch is continually interrupted by  the flower-cluster. In the Beech the flowers are axillary.      QUESTIONS ON THE BEECH.    How are the scales of the Beech bud arranged?    How many leaves are there in the bud?    How does the arrangement of the scales and leaves in the bud differ from  that of the Horsechestnut?    How are the leaves folded in the bud?    What is the arrangement of the leaves on the stem?    How does this differ from Horsechestnut and Lilac?    How old is your branch?    How old is each twig?    What years were the best for growth?    How does the growth of the branches differ from that of Horsechestnut?  From Lilac?    Explain these differences with reference to the growth and arrangement of  the buds?    In what direction do the twigs grow?    How does this affect the appearance of the tree?    Compare the amount of spray of the Beech and Horsechestnut and explain the  reason of the difference.    These questions are only intended for review, they are never to be used  for the first study of the specimen.      AMERICAN ELM (_Ulmus Americana_).    The buds are covered with brown scales, which are hairy on the edges. The  flower-buds are larger than the leaf-buds and are in the axils of the  lower leaves of the preceding year. Each leaf in the bud is enclosed by  a pair of scales. They are so small that the pupils, unused to delicate  work, will hardly discover them. Under a glass they can be seen to be  ovate, folded on the midrib with the inner face within (_conduplicate_),  and with an ovate scale joined to the base of the leaf on either side. The  scales thus show themselves to be modified stipules. The venation of the  leaves is very plain. The scales are much larger than the leaves. The  flower-buds contain a cluster of flowers, on slender green pedicels. The  calyx is bell-shaped, unequal, and lobed. The stamens and pistil can  be seen. The flower-clusters do not seem to leave any mark which is  distinguishable from the leaf-scar.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--American Elm. 1. Branch in winter state: _a_,  leaf-scars; _b_, bud-scars; _d_, leaf-buds; _e_, flower-buds. 2. Branch,  with staminate flower-buds expanding. 3. Same, more advanced. 4. Branch,  with pistillate flowers, the leaf-bud also expanding.]    The leaf-scars are small and extend about half around the stem. The  arrangement is alternate on the one-half plan. There are three dots on the  scar.    The rings are quite plain. The tree can be used to make tables of growth,  like those of the Beech.    The buds will probably be too small for examination by the pupils, at  present, but their position and development can be studied, and are very  instructive. As the leaf-buds are all on the ends of the branchlets, the  twigs and branches will be just below the bud-rings, and then there will  be a space where no twigs nor branches will be found, till the next set  of rings is reached. This gives the branches more room to develop  symmetrically. The terminal buds do not develop in the Elm, in old trees,  the bud axillary to the last leaf of the season taking its place, and most  of the other axillary buds growing also. This makes the tree break out  into very fine spray. A tree like the Elm, where the trunk becomes lost in  the branches, is called _deliquescent_; when the trunk is continued to the  top of the tree, as in the Spruce, it is _excurrent_.    The small, feathery twigs and branches that are often seen on the trunks  and great limbs of the elm grow from buds which are produced anywhere on  the surface of the wood. Such buds are called _adventitious_ buds. They  often spring from a tree when it is wounded.    \"The American elm is, in most parts of the state, the most magnificent  tree to be seen. From a root, which, in old trees, spreads much above  the surface of the ground, the trunk rises to a considerable height in a  single stem. Here it usually divides into two or three principal branches,  which go off by a gradual and easy curve. Theses stretch upwards and  outwards with an airy sweep, become horizontal, the extreme half of the  limb, pendent, forming a light and regular arch. This graceful curvature,  and absence of all abruptness, in the primary limbs and forks, and all the  subsequent divisions, are entirely characteristic of the tree, and enable  an observer to distinguish it in the winter and even by night, when  standing in relief against the sky, as far as it can be distinctly  seen.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: A Report on the Trees and Shrubs growing naturally in the  Forests of Massachusetts.

This book will be found very useful, containing careful descriptions of  many trees and shrubs, and interesting facts about them.]      QUESTIONS ON THE AMERICAN ELM.    How do the flower-buds differ from the leaf-buds in position and  appearance?    What is the arrangement of the leaves?    What other tree that you have studied has this arrangement?    How old is your branch?    Where would you look to see if the flower-cluster had left any mark?    Why is it that several twigs grow near each other, and that then comes a  space without any branches?    What buds develop most frequently?    How does this affect the appearance of the tree?    What is a tree called when the trunk is lost in the branches?      BALM OF GILEAD (_Populus balsamifera, var. candicans_).    The buds are pointed: the terminal slightly angled, the axillary flattened  against the stem.[1] Some of the axillary buds contain leaves and some  flowers; the appearance of the leaf-buds and flower-buds being the same.  The scales of the bud are modified stipules. The terminal buds have about  three pairs of the outer scales brown and leathery. The inner scales, as  well as the leaves, are coated with resinous matter, which has a strong  odor and a nauseous taste. The smaller outer scales have no corresponding  leaf, and apparently are modified stipules of the leaves of the preceding  year, but the larger ones have a leaf to each pair of scales. The outer  and inner leaves are small, the middle ones larger. Comparing the branch,  it will be seen that these leaves make the largest growth of internode.  The leaves are rolled towards the midrib on the upper face (_involute_).  There are about ten which are easily seen and counted, the inner ones  being very small, with minute scales. The axillary buds have a short  thick scale on the outer part of the bud, then about three pairs of large  scales, each succeeding one enwrapping those within, the outer one brown  and leathery. The scales of the flower-buds are somewhat gummy, but not  nearly so much so as those of the leaf-buds. Within is the catkin. Each  pistil, or stamen (they are on separate trees, _dioecious_) is in a little  cup and covered by a scale, which is cut and fringed.    [Footnote 1: These buds cannot be satisfactorily examined in cross  section, on account of the resin. The scales must be removed one by one,  with a knife, with a complete disregard of the effect upon the hands.]    The leaf-scars are somewhat three-lobed on the young parts, with three  dots, indicating the fibro-vascular bundles, which ran up into the leaf.  The scars are swollen, making the young branches exceedingly rough. In  the older parts the scars become less noticeable. Strong young shoots,  especially those which come up from the root, are strongly angled,  with three ridges running up into each leaf-scar, making them almost  club-shaped. There are often from twenty to thirty leaves in one year's  growth, in such shoots, and all the leaves are not rudimentary in the bud.  The growth in this case is said to be _indefinite_. Usually in trees with  scaly buds the plan of the whole year's growth is laid down in the bud,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10738"],[0,"Mahomet, Founder of Islam (#10)"],[1,"inspiration. Prophecies of bliss in store for the Faithful are frequent,  and of the corresponding woe for Unbelievers. The whole is permeated with  the spirit of the poet and visionary, a poetry tumultuous but strong, a  vision lurid but inspiring.    The little band of converts under guidance of this fierce rhetoric became  united and strengthened in its faith, prepared to defend it, and to  spread it as far as possible throughout their kindred.    About three years after Mahomet's receipt of his mission, in A.D. 618, an  important change came over the attitude of the Kureisch towards Islam.  Hitherto they had jeered or remained indifferent. Mahomet's uncles, Abu  Talib and Abu Lahab, represented the two poles of Kureischite feeling.  Abu Talib remained untouched by the new faith, but his kindly nature did  not allow him to adopt any severe measures for its repression, and,  moreover, Mahomet was of his kindred, and he was willing to afford him  protection in case of need. Abu Lahab jeered openly, and manifested his  scorn by definite speeches. But as the bands of converts grew, the  Kureisch found it undesirable to maintain their indifferent attitude.  They began to persecute, first refusing to allow the Believers to meet,  and then seeking them out individually to endeavour to torture them into  recanting.    From this time dates the creation of one of the foremost principles in  the creed of the Prophet. If a Believer is in danger of torture, he may  dissemble his faith to save himself from infamy and death. Though in  striking contrast to the Christian tenets, this exhortation was neither  cowardly nor imprudent. In his eyes reckless courting of death would not  avail the propagation of Islam, and though a man might die to some good  service on the battlefield, smiting his enemies, no wise end could be  served when his death would merely gratify the lust of his murderers.    The persecution continued in spite of Mahomet's attempts to withstand it,  until he was forced to go to Abu Talib for protection. This was accorded  willingly, on account of kindred ties, but there can have been little  cordiality between uncle and nephew on the subject, for Mahomet was more  than ever determined upon the maintenance and growth of his principles.  Still the conversions to Islam continued, and the persecution of its  adherents, until there came to the Kureisch a sharp intimation that this  new sect arisen in their midst was not an ephemeral affair of a few  weeks, but a prolonged endeavour to pursue the ideal of a single God. In  615 the first company of Muslim converts broke from the confined  religious area of Mecca and journeyed into Abyssinia, where they could  practice their faith in peace. This move convinced the Kureisch of the  sincerity of their opponents, for they were almost strong enough to merit  the name, and compelled them to believe a little in the force lying  behind this strange manifestation of religious zeal in their midst.    Mahomet does not at this time seem to have been definitely ranged against  the Kureisch. He was still on negotiable terms with them, and they were a  little distrustful of his capacity and ignorant of his power. The stages  by which he developed from a discredited citizen, obsessed by one idea,  into a political opponent worthy of their best steel and bravest men was  necessarily gradual, and indeed the Prophet himself had no knowledge of  the role marked out for him by his own personality and the destinies  of Arabia. The cause of Islam stood as yet in parlous condition,  half-formulated, unwieldy, awaiting the moulding hand of persecution to  develop it into a political and social system.          CHAPTER VI      SEVERANCE    \"Do you see Al-Lat and Al-Ozza and Manat the third idol beside?  These are the exalted females, and truly their intercession is to be  expected.\"--_The Kuran_ (last two lines excised later by Mahomet).    The little band of converts, driven by the Kureisch to seek peace and  freedom in Abyssinia, remained for two years in their country of refuge,  but in 615 returned to Mecca for reasons which have never been fully  explained, though it is easy, in the light of future events, to discover  the motive behind such a move.    Mahomet was not yet convinced of the impossibility of compromise, neither  was the powerful party among the Kureisch utterly indifferent to  Mahomet's ancestry as a member of the house of Hashim, and his position  as the husband of Khadijah. He had been respected among men for his  uprightness before he affronted their prejudices by scorning their gods.  His power was daily becoming a source of strife and faction within the  city, and the Kureisch were not averse from attempting to come to terms.  Mahomet for his part, as far as the scanty evidence of history unfolds  his state of mind, seems to have been almost desperately anxious to  effect an understanding with the Kureisch. His cause still journeyed by  perilous ways, and at the time hopes of his future achievement were  apparently dependent upon the goodwill of the dominant Meccan party.    The story runs that the chief men of Mecca were discussing within the  Kaaba the affairs of the city. Mahomet came to them and recited Sura  liii--The Star--a fulgent psalm in praise of God and heavenly joys. When  he came to the verses:    \"Do you see Al-Lat and Al-Ozza and Manat the third beside,\" he inserted:    \"Verily these are the exalted females, and truly their intercession may  be expected.\"    They Kureisch were rejoiced at this homage to their deities, and  speedily welcomed Mahomet's change of front; but he, disquieted,  returned moodily to his house, where Gabriel appeared to him in  stern rebuke:    \"Thou hast repeated before the people words I never gave to thee.\"    And Mahomet, whether conscience-stricken by his lapse from the Muslim  faith, or convinced that compromise with the Kureisch was impossible and  also undesirable in face of his growing power, quickly repudiated the  whole affair, which had been unquestionably born of impulse, or possibly  an adventurous mood that prompted him \"to see what would happen\" if he  ministered to the prejudices of the Kureisch. It must be acknowledged,  however, that repentance for his homage to heathen idols was the  mainspring of his recantation, for the period immediately following was  one of hardship and persecution for him, and his transitory lapse injured  his cause appreciably with the brethren of his faith. The attempt was  honourably made, and only failed by Mahomet's swift realisation that his  acknowledgment of Lat and Ozza as spirits sanctioned the worship of their  images by his fellow-citizens, and this his stern monotheism could not  for a moment entertain.    The Muslim, with numbers that increased very slowly, were harried afresh  by the Kureisch as soon as Mahomet had withdrawn his concessions, and  most of them were forced at length to return to Abyssinia. His pathetic  little band, wandering from city to city, doubtful of ever attaining  security and uncertain of its ultimate destiny, was the prototype in its  vagrancy of that larger and confident band which cast aside its  traditions and the city of its birth, headed by a spirit heroic in  disaster and supreme in faith, to find its goal in the foundation of a  new order for Arabia. Chief among them were Othman and Rockeya, and these  were the only ones who returned to Mecca, for the rest remained in  Abyssinia until after the migration to Medina, in fact until after  Mahomet had carried out the expedition to Kheibar.    Left without any supporters within the city, Mahomet was exposed to all  the vituperations and insults which his recent refusal of compromise had  brought him. The Kureisch now directed all their energies towards  persuading Abu Talib to repudiate his nephew. If once this could be  effected, the Kureisch would have a free hand to pursue their desire to  exterminate the Muslim and to overthrow the Prophet's power. He was  immune from bodily attack, chiefly because of Abu Talib's position in the  city as nominal head of the house of Hashim. No Kureisch could run the  risk of alienating so great a number of fellow-citizens, and a personal  attack upon Abu Talib's nephew could but have that result.    Dark and stormy as the Muslim destiny appeared during this period of  transition from religious to political conceptions, nevertheless it was  now enriched by the conversion of two of the most influential characters  upon its later fortunes--Hamza and Omar. Many stories have been woven  round their discovery of the truth of Islam, and by reading between the  lines later commentators may discover the forces at work to induce  them to take this dubious step. It is beyond question that Mahomet's  personality was the moving factor in the conversion of each, for each  relates an incident which serves peculiarly to illustrate the Prophet's  magnetism.    Hamza, \"the lion of God,\" and a son of Abd-al-Muttalib in his old age,  was accosted by a slave girl as he passed on his way through the city  She told him breathlessly that she had seen \"the Lord Mahomet\" insulted  and reviled by Abu Jahl, and being unprotected and alone, he could only  suffer in silence. Hamza listened to her story with indignation, and  determined to revenge the insult to his uncle and foster-brother, for by  the ties of kinship they were one. In the Kaaba he publicly declared his  allegiance to Islam, and revenged upon Abu Jahl the injuries he had  inflicted upon his kinsman. Hamza never repented of his championship of  Mahomet. The adventurous fortunes of Islam satisfied his warrior-spirit,  and under Mahomet's guidance he helped to control and direct its military  zeal, until it had perforce established its religion through the sword.  Mahomet's personal magnetism had drawn him irresistibly to the religion  he upheld so steadfastly, and in the face of revilement and danger.    Omar was "]]]
