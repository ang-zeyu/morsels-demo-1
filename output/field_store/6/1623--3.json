There was a great amount of  work to be done and the great problem confronting married women who had  not been taught to work and who thought it beneath their standing to  soil their hands, found it very difficult.    There were on the other hand many Negro women who needed work and young  girls who needed guidance and training.    The home and guidance of the aristocratic white people offered the best  opportunity for the dependent un-schooled freed women; and it was in  this kind of home that the ex-slave child of this story was reared.    Irene Coates of 2015 Windle Street, Jacksonville, Florida, was born in  Georgia about 1859. She was close to six years of age when freedom was  declared.    She was one among the many Negro children who had the advantage of  living under the direct supervision of kind whites and receiving the  care which could only be excelled by an educated mother.    Jimmie and Lou Bedell were the names of the man and wife who saw the  need of having a Negro girl come into their home as one in the family  and at the same time be assured of a good and efficient servant in years  to come.    When Irene was old enough, she became the nurse of the Bedell baby and  when the family left Savannah, Georgia to come to Jacksonville, they  brought Irene with them.    Although Irene was just about six years old when the Civil War ended,  she has vivid recollection of happenings during slavery. Some of the  incidents which happened were told her by her slave associates after  slavery ended and some of them she remembers herself.    Two incidents which she considers caused respect for slaves by their  masters and finally the Emancipation by Abraham Lincoln she tells in  this order.    The first event tells of a young, strong healthy Negro woman who  knew her work and did it well. \"She would grab up two bags of  guana (fertilizer) and tote 'em at one time,\" said Irene, and was never  found shirking her work. The overseer on the plantation, was very hard  on the slaves and practiced striking them across the back with a whip  when he wanted to spur them on to do more work.    Irene says, one day a crowd of women were hoeing in the field and the  overseer rode along and struck one of the women across the back with the  whip, and the one nearest her spoke and said that if he ever struck her  like that, it would be the day he or she would die. The overseer heard  the remark and the first opportunity he got, he rode by the woman and  struck her with the whip and started to ride on. The woman was hoeing at  the time, she whirled around, struck the overseer on his head with the  hoe, knocking him from his horse, she then pounced upon him and chopped  his head off. She went mad for a few seconds and proceeded to chop and  mutilate his body; that done to her satisfaction, she then killed his  horse. She then calmly went to tell the master of the murder, saying  \"I've done killed de overseer,\" the master replied--\"Do you mean to say  you've killed the overseer?\" she answered yes, and that she had killed  the horse also. Without hesitating, the master pointing to one of his  small cabins on the plantation said--\"You see that house over there?\"  she answered yes--at the same time looking--\"Well\" said he, \"take all  your belongings and move into that house and you are free from this day  and if the mistress wants you to do anything for her, do it if you want  to.\" Irene related with much warmth the effect that incident had upon  the future treatment of the slaves.    The other incident occured in Virginia. It was upon an occasion when  Mrs. Abraham Lincoln was visiting in Richmond. A woman slaveowner had  one of her slaves whipped in the presence of Mrs. Lincoln. It was  easily noticed that the woman was an expectant mother. Mrs. Lincoln was  horrified at the situation and expressed herself as being so, saying  that she was going to tell the President as soon as she returned to the  White House. Whether this incident had any bearing upon Mr. Lincoln's  actions or not, those slaves who were present and Irene says that they  all believed it to be the beginning of the President's activities to end  slavery.    Besides these incidents, Irene remembers that women who were not strong  and robust were given such work as sewing, weaving and minding babies.  The cloth from which the Sunday clothes of the slaves was made was  called _ausenburg_ and the slave women were very proud of this. The  older women were required to do most of the weaving of cloth and making  shirts for the male slaves.    When an old woman who had been sick, regained her strength, she was sent  to the fields the same as the younger ones. The ones who could cook and  tickle the palates of her mistress and master were highly prized and  were seldon if ever offered for sale at the auction block.    The slaves were given fat meat and bread made of husk of corn and wheat.  This caused them to steal food and when caught they were severely  whipped.    Irene recalls the practice of blowing a horn whenever a sudden rain  came. The overseer had a certain Negro to blow three times and if  shelter could be found, the slaves were expected to seek it until the  rain ceased.    The master had sheds built at intervals on the plantation. These  accomodated a goodly number; if no shed was available the slaves stood  under trees. If neither was handy and the slaves got wet, they could not  go to the cabins to change clothes for fear of losing time from work.  This was often the case; she says that slaves were more neglected than  the cattle.    Another custom which impressed the child-mind of Irene was the tieing of  slaves by their thumbs to a tree limb and whipping them. Women and young  girls were treated the same as were men.    After the Bedells took Irene to live in their home they traveled a deal.  After bringing her to Jacksonville, when Jacksonville was only a small  port, they then went to Camden County, Georgia.    Irene married while in Georgia and came back to Jacksonville with her  husband Charles, the year of the earthquake at Charleston, South  Carolina, about 1888.    Irene and Charles Coates have lived in Jacksonville since that time. She  relates many tales of happenings during the time that this city grew  from a town of about four acres to its present status.    Irene is the mother of five children. She has nine grandchildren and  eight great-grandchildren. Her health is fair, but her eyesight is poor.  It is her delight to entertain visitors and is conversant upon matters  pertaining to slavery and reconstruction days.      REFERENCE    1. Irene Coates, 2015 Windle Street, Jacksonville, Florida          FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT  American Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)    Martin D. Richardson, Field Worker  Grandin, Florida    NEIL COKER      Interesting tales of the changes that came to the section of Florida  that is situated along the Putnam-Clay County lines are told by Neil  Coker, old former slave who lives two miles south of McRae on the road  Grandin.    Coker is the son of a slave mother and a half-Negro. His father, he  states, was Senator John Wall, who held a seat in the senate for sixteen  years. He was born in Virginia, and received his family name from an old  family bearing the same in that state. He was born, as nearly as he can  remember, about 1857.    One of Coker's first reminiscences is of the road on which he still  lives. During his childhood it was known as the 'Bellamy Road,' so  called because it was built, some 132 years ago, by a man of that name  who hailed from West Florida.    The 'Bellamy Road' was at one time the main route of traffic between  Tallahassee and St. Augustine. (Interestingly enough, the road is at  least 30 miles southwest of St. Augustine where it passes through  Grandin; the reason for cutting it in such a wide circle, Coker says was  because of the ferocity of the Seminoles in the swamps north and west of  St. Augustine.)    Wagons, carriages and stages passed along this road in the days before  the War Between the States, Coker says. In addition to these he claims  to have seen many travellers by foot, and not infrequently furtive  escaped slaves, the latter usually under cover of an appropriate  background of darkness.    The road again came into considerable use during the late days of the  War. It was during these days that the Federal troops, both whites and  Negroes, passed in seemingly endless procession on their way to or from  encounters. On one occasion the former slave recounts having seen a  procession of soldiers that took nearly two days to pass; they travelled  on horse and afoot.    Several amusing incidents are related by the ex-slave of the events of  this period. Dozens of the Negro soldiers, he says, discarded their  uniforms for the gaudier clothing that had belonged to their masters in  former days, and could be identified as soldiers as they passed only  with difficulty. Others would pause on their trip at some plantation,  ascertain the name of the 'meanest' overseer on the place, then tie him  backward on a horse and force him to accompany them. Particularly  retributive were the punishments visited upon Messrs. Mays and  Prevatt--generally recognized as the most vicious slave drivers of the  section.    Bellamy, Coker says built the road with slave labor and as an  investment, realizing much money on tolls on it for many years. A  remarkable feature of the road is that despite its age and the fact that  County authorities have permitted its former good grading to deterierate  to an almost impassable sand at some seasons, there is no mistaking the  fact that this was once a major thoroughfare.    The region that stretches from Green Cove Springs in the Northeast to  Grandin in the Southwest, the former slave claims, was once dotted with  lakes, creeks, and even a river; few of the lakes and none of the other  bodies still exist, however.

Yet this test is one of the most important made on wood, as it  brings out properties not evident from other tests. Defects and  brittleness are revealed by impact better than by any other kind  of test. In common practice nearly all external stresses are of  the nature of impact. In fact, no two moving bodies can come  together without impact stress. Impact is therefore the  commonest form of applied stress, although the most difficult to  measure.      _Failures in Timber Beams_    If a beam is loaded too heavily it will break or fail in some  characteristic manner. These failures may be classified  according to the way in which they develop, as tension,  compression, and horizontal shear; and according to the  appearance of the broken surface, as brash, and fibrous. A  number of forms may develop if the beam is completely ruptured.    Since the tensile strength of wood is on the average about three  times as great as the compressive strength, a beam should,  therefore, be expected to fail by the formation in the first  place of a fold on the compression side due to the crushing  action, followed by failure on the tension side. This is usually  the case in green or moist wood. In dry material the first  visible failure is not infrequently on the lower or tension  side, and various attempts have been made to explain why such is  the case.[15]    [Footnote 15: See Proc. Int. Assn. for Testing Materials, 1912,  XXIII_{2}, pp. 12-13.]    Within the elastic limit the elongations and shortenings are  equal, and the neutral plane lies in the middle of the beam.  (See TRANSVERSE OR BENDING STRENGTH: BEAMS, above.) Later the  top layer of fibres on the upper or compression side fail, and  on the load increasing, the next layer of fibres fail, and so  on, even though this failure may not be visible. As a result the  shortenings on the upper side of the beam become considerably  greater than the elongations on the lower side. The neutral  plane must be presumed to sink gradually toward the tension  side, and when the stresses on the outer fibres at the bottom  have become sufficiently great, the fibres are pulled in two,  the tension area being much smaller than the compression area.  The rupture is often irregular, as in direct tension tests.  Failure may occur partially in single bundles of fibres some  time before the final failure takes place. One reason why the  failure of a dry beam is different from one that is moist, is  that drying increases the stiffness of the fibres so that they  offer more resistance to crushing, while it has much less effect  upon the tensile strength.    There is considerable variation in tension failures depending  upon the toughness or the brittleness of the wood, the  arrangement of the grain, defects, etc., making further  classification desirable. The four most common forms are:    (1)~Simple tension,~ in which there is a direct pulling in two  of the wood on the under side of the beam due to a tensile  stress parallel to the grain, (See Fig. 17, No. 1.) This is  common in straight-grained beams, particularly when the wood is  seasoned.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Characteristic failures of simple  beams.]    (2)~Cross-grained tension,~ in which the fracture is caused by a  tensile force acting oblique to the grain. (See Fig. 17, No. 2.)  This is a common form of failure where the beam has diagonal,  spiral or other form of cross grain on its lower side. Since the  tensile strength of wood across the grain is only a small  fraction of that with the grain it is easy to see why a  cross-grained timber would fail in this manner.    (3)~Splintering tension,~ in which the failure consists of a  considerable number of slight tension failures, producing a  ragged or splintery break on the under surface of the beam. (See  Fig. 17, No. 3.) This is common in tough woods. In this case the  surface of fracture is fibrous.    (4)~Brittle tension,~ in which the beam fails by a clean break  extending entirely through it. (See Fig. 17, No. 4.) It is  characteristic of a brittle wood which gives way suddenly  without warning, like a piece of chalk. In this case the surface  of fracture is described as brash.    ~Compression failure~ (see Fig. 17, No. 5) has few variations  except that it appears at various distances from the neutral  plane of the beam. It is very common in green timbers. The  compressive stress parallel to the fibres causes them to buckle  or bend as in an endwise compressive test. This action usually  begins on the top side shortly after the elastic limit is  reached and extends downward, sometimes almost reaching the  neutral plane before complete failure occurs. Frequently two or  more failures develop at about the same time.    ~Horizontal shear failure,~ in which the upper and lower  portions of the beam slide along each other for a portion of  their length either at one or at both ends (see Fig. 17, No. 6),  is fairly common in air-dry material and in green material when  the ratio of the height of the beam to the span is relatively  large. It is not common in small clear specimens. It is often  due to shake or season checks, common in large timbers, which  reduce the actual area resisting the shearing action  considerably below the calculated area used in the formulae for  horizontal shear. (See page 98 for this formulae.) For this  reason it is unsafe, in designing large timber beams, to use  shearing stresses higher than those calculated for beams that  failed in horizontal shear. The effect of a failure in  horizontal shear is to divide the beam into two or more beams  the combined strength of which is much less than that of the  original beam. Fig. 18 shows a large beam in which two failures  in horizontal shear occurred at the same end. That the parts  behave independently is shown by the compression failure below  the original location of the neutral plane.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Failure of a large beam by horizontal  shear. _Photo by U. S, Forest Service._]    Table XI gives an analysis of the causes of first failure in 840  large timber beams of nine different species of conifers. Of the  total number tested 165 were air-seasoned, the remainder green.  The failure occurring first signifies the point of greatest  weakness in the specimen under the particular conditions of  loading employed (in this case, third-point static loading).    |-----------------------------------------------------------|  |                         TABLE XI                          |  |-----------------------------------------------------------|  |          MANNER OF FIRST FAILURE OF LARGE BEAMS           |  |             (Forest Service Bul. 108, p. 56)              |  |-----------------------------------------------------------|  |                  | Total  | Per cent of total failing by  |  |   COMMON NAME    | number |---------+-------------+-------|  |   OF SPECIES     | of     | Tension | Compression | Shear |  |                  | tests  |         |             |       |  |------------------+--------+---------+-------------+-------|  | Longleaf pine:   |        |         |             |       |  |   green          |    17  |    18   |      24     |   58  |  |   dry            |     9  |    22   |      22     |   56  |  | Douglas fir:     |        |         |             |       |  |   green          |   191  |    27   |      72     |    1  |  |   dry            |    91  |    19   |      76     |    5  |  | Shortleaf pine:  |        |         |             |       |  |   green          |    48  |    27   |      56     |   17  |  |   dry            |    13  |    54   |             |   46  |  | Western larch:   |        |         |             |       |  |   green          |    62  |    23   |      71     |    6  |  |   dry            |    52  |    54   |      19     |   27  |  | Loblolly pine:   |        |         |             |       |  |   green          |   111  |    40   |      53     |    7  |  |   dry            |    25  |    60   |      12     |   28  |  | Tamarack:        |        |         |             |       |  |   green          |    30  |    37   |      53     |   10  |  |   dry            |     9  |    45   |      22     |   33  |  | Western hemlock: |        |         |             |       |  |   green          |    39  |    21   |      74     |    5  |  |   dry            |    44  |    11   |      66     |   23  |  | Redwood:         |        |         |             |       |  |   green          |    28  |    43   |      50     |    7  |  |   dry            |    12  |    83   |      17     |       |  | Norway pine:     |        |         |             |       |  |   green          |    49  |    18   |      76     |    6  |  |   dry            |    10  |    30   |      60     |   10  |  |-----------------------------------------------------------|  | NOTE.--These tests were made on timbers ranging in cross  |  | section from 4\" x 10\" to 8\" x 16\", and with a span of 15  |  | feet.                                                     |  |-----------------------------------------------------------|        TOUGHNESS: TORSION      Toughness is a term applied to more than one property of wood.  Thus wood that is difficult to split is said to be tough. Again,  a tough wood is one that will not rupture until it has deformed  considerably under loads at or near its maximum strength, or one  which still hangs together after it has been ruptured and may be  bent back and forth without breaking apart. Toughness includes  flexibility and is the reverse of brittleness, in that tough  woods break gradually and give warning of failure. Tough woods  offer great resistance to impact and will permit rougher  treatment in manipulations attending manufacture and use.  Toughness is"]]]
