The palace court was built of rare marbles,  exquisitely polished. Fountains tinkled musically here and there; the  vast colonnade, open to the south, allowed the maidens, as they raised  their heads from their embroideries, to gaze upon a vista of rose-hued  fields and groves of trees bearing fruits or laden with sweet-scented  flowers. At times one of the girls would start a song, the others  joining in the chorus, or one would rise and dance, gracefully swaying  to the music of a harp played by a companion. And then Glinda smiled,  glad to see her maids mixing play with work.    Presently among the fields an object was seen moving, threading the  broad path that led to the castle gate. Some of the girls looked upon  this object enviously; the Sorceress merely gave it a glance and nodded  her stately head as if pleased, for it meant the coming of her friend  and mistress--the only one in all the land that Glinda bowed to.    Then up the path trotted a wooden animal attached to a red wagon, and  as the quaint steed halted at the gate there descended from the wagon  two young girls, Ozma, Ruler of Oz, and her companion, Princess  Dorothy. Both were dressed in simple white muslin gowns, and as they  ran up the marble steps of the palace they laughed and chatted as gaily  as if they were not the most important persons in the world's loveliest  fairyland.    The maids of honor had risen and stood with bowed heads to greet the  royal Ozma, while Glinda came forward with outstretched arms to greet  her guests.    \"We've just come on a visit, you know,\" said Ozma. \"Both Dorothy and I  were wondering how we should pass the day when we happened to think  we'd not been to your Quadling Country for weeks, so we took the  Sawhorse and rode straight here.\"    \"And we came so fast,\" added Dorothy, \"that our hair is blown all  fuzzy, for the Sawhorse makes a wind of his own. Usually it's a day's  journey from the Em'rald City, but I don't s'pose we were two hours on  the way.\"    \"You are most welcome,\" said Glinda the Sorceress, and led them through  the court to her magnificent reception hall. Ozma took the arm of her  hostess, but Dorothy lagged behind, kissing some of the maids she knew  best, talking with others, and making them all feel that she was their  friend. When at last she joined Glinda and Ozma in the reception hall,  she found them talking earnestly about the condition of the people, and  how to make them more happy and contented--although they were already  the happiest and most contented folks in all the world.    This interested Ozma, of course, but it didn't interest Dorothy very  much, so the little girl ran over to a big table on which was lying  open Glinda's Great Book of Records.    This Book is one of the greatest treasures in Oz, and the Sorceress  prizes it more highly than any of her magical possessions. That is the  reason it is firmly attached to the big marble table by means of golden  chains, and whenever Glinda leaves home she locks the Great Book  together with five jeweled padlocks, and carries the keys safely hidden  in her bosom.    I do not suppose there is any magical thing in any fairyland to compare  with the Record Book, on the pages of which are constantly being  printed a record of every event that happens in any part of the world,  at exactly the moment it happens.  And the records are always truthful,  although sometimes they do not give as many details as one could wish.  But then, lots of things happen, and so the records have to be brief or  even Glinda's Great Book could not hold them all.    Glinda looked at the records several times each day, and Dorothy,  whenever she visited the Sorceress, loved to look in the Book and see  what was happening everywhere. Not much was recorded about the Land of  Oz, which is usually peaceful and uneventful, but today Dorothy found  something which interested her. Indeed, the printed letters were  appearing on the page even while she looked.    \"This is funny!\" she exclaimed. \"Did you know, Ozma, that there were  people in your Land of Oz called Skeezers?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Ozma, coming to her side, \"I know that on Professor  Wogglebug's Map of the Land of Oz there is a place marked 'Skeezer,'  but what the Skeezers are like I do not know. No one I know has ever  seen them or heard of them. The Skeezer Country is 'way at the upper  edge of the Gillikin Country, with the sandy, impassable desert on one  side and the mountains of Oogaboo on another side. That is a part of  the Land of Oz of which I know very little.\"    \"I guess no one else knows much about it either, unless it's the  Skeezers themselves,\" remarked Dorothy. \"But the Book says: 'The  Skeezers of Oz have declared war on the Flatheads of Oz, and there is  likely to be fighting and much trouble as the result.'\"    \"Is that all the Book says?\" asked Ozma.    \"Every word,\" said Dorothy, and Ozma and Glinda both looked at the  Record and seemed surprised and perplexed.    \"Tell me, Glinda,\" said Ozma, \"who are the Flatheads?\"    \"I cannot, your Majesty,\" confessed the Sorceress. \"Until now I never  have heard of them, nor have I ever heard the Skeezers mentioned. In  the faraway corners of Oz are hidden many curious tribes of people, and  those who never leave their own countries and never are visited by  those from our favored part of Oz, naturally are unknown to me.  However, if you so desire, I can learn through my arts of sorcery  something of the Skeezers and the Flatheads.\"    \"I wish you would,\" answered Ozma seriously. \"You see, Glinda, if these  are Oz people they are my subjects and I cannot allow any wars or  troubles in the Land I rule, if I can possibly help it.\"    \"Very well, your Majesty,\" said the Sorceress, \"I will try to get some  information to guide you. Please excuse me for a time, while I retire  to my Room of Magic and Sorcery.\"    \"May I go with you?\" asked Dorothy, eagerly.    \"No, Princess,\" was the reply. \"It would spoil the charm to have anyone  present.\"    So Glinda locked herself in her own Room of Magic and Dorothy and Ozma  waited patiently for her to come out again.    In about an hour Glinda appeared, looking grave and thoughtful.    \"Your Majesty,\" she said to Ozma, \"the Skeezers live on a Magic Isle in  a great lake. For that reason--because the Skeezers deal in magic--I  can learn little about them.\"    \"Why, I didn't know there was a lake in that part of Oz,\" exclaimed  Ozma. \"The map shows a river running through the Skeezer Country, but  no lake.\"    \"That is because the person who made the map never had visited that  part of the country,\" explained the Sorceress. \"The lake surely is  there, and in the lake is an island--a Magic Isle--and on that island  live the people called the Skeezers.\"    \"What are they like?\" inquired the Ruler of Oz.    \"My magic cannot tell me that,\" confessed Glinda, \"for the magic of the  Skeezers prevents anyone outside of their domain knowing anything about  them.\"    \"The Flatheads must know, if they're going to fight the Skeezers,\"  suggested Dorothy.    \"Perhaps so,\" Glinda replied, \"but I can get little information  concerning the Flatheads, either. They are people who inhabit a  mountain just south of the Lake of the Skeezers. The mountain has steep  sides and a broad, hollow top, like a basin, and in this basin the  Flatheads have their dwellings. They also are magic-workers and usually  keep to themselves and allow no one from outside to visit them. I have  learned that the Flatheads number about one hundred people--men, women  and children--while the Skeezers number just one hundred and one.\"    \"What did they quarrel about, and why do they wish to fight one  another?\" was Ozma's next question.    \"I cannot tell your Majesty that,\" said Glinda.    \"But see here!\" cried Dorothy, \"it's against the law for anyone but  Glinda and the Wizard to work magic in the Land of Oz, so if these two  strange people are magic-makers they are breaking the law and ought to  be punished!\" Ozma smiled upon her little friend.    \"Those who do not know me or my laws,\" she said, \"cannot be expected to  obey my laws. If we know nothing of the Skeezers or the Flatheads, it  is likely that they know nothing of us.\"    \"But they ought to know, Ozma, and we ought to know. Who's going to  tell them, and how are we going to make them behave?\"    \"That,\" returned Ozma, \"is what I am now considering. What would you  advise, Glinda?\"    The Sorceress took a little time to consider this question, before she  made reply. Then she said: \"Had you not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9612"],[0,"The Botanic Garden (#1)"],[1,"Proofreaders                      [Illustration:  FLORA attired by the ELEMENTS]                                            THE                                BOTANIC GARDEN;                              _A Poem, in Two Parts._                                      PART  I.

THE LOVES OF THE PLANTS.                                        WITH                                Philosophical Notes.                                     ADVERTISEMENT.      The general design of the following sheets is to inlist Imagination  under the banner of Science; and to lead her votaries from the looser  analogies, which dress out the imagery of poetry, to the stricter, ones  which form the ratiocination of philosophy. While their particular  design is to induce the ingenious to cultivate the knowledge of Botany,  by introducing them to the vestibule of that delightful science, and  recommending to their attention the immortal works of the celebrated  Swedish Naturalist, LINNEUS.    In the first Poem, or Economy of Vegetation, the physiology of Plants is  delivered; and the operation of the Elements, as far as they may be  supposed to affect the growth of Vegetables. In the second Poem, or  Loves of the Plants, the Sexual System of Linneus is explained, with the  remarkable properties of many particular plants.                                          APOLOGY.      It may be proper here to apologize for many of the subsequent  conjectures on some articles of natural philosophy, as not being  supported by accurate investigation or conclusive experiments.  Extravagant theories however in those parts of philosophy, where our  knowledge is yet imperfect, are not without their use; as they encourage  the execution of laborious experiments, or the investigation of  ingenious deductions, to confirm or refute them. And since natural  objects are allied to each other by many affinities, every kind of  theoretic distribution of them adds to our knowledge by developing some  of their analogies.    The Rosicrucian doctrine of Gnomes, Sylphs, Nymphs, and Salamanders, was  thought to afford a proper machinery for a Botanic poem; as it is  probable, that they were originally the names of hieroglyphic figures  representing the elements.    Many of the important operations of Nature were shadowed or allegorized  in the heathen mythology, as the first Cupid springing from the Egg of  Night, the marriage of Cupid and Psyche, the Rape of Proserpine, the  Congress of Jupiter and Juno, Death and Resuscitation of Adonis, &c.  many of which are ingeniously explained in the works of Bacon, Vol. V.  p. 47. 4th Edit. London, 1778. The Egyptians were possessed of many  discoveries in philosophy and chemistry before the invention of letters;  these were then expressed in hieroglyphic paintings of men and animals;  which after the discovery of the alphabet were described and animated by  the poets, and became first the deities of Egypt, and afterwards of  Greece and Rome. Allusions to those fables were therefore thought proper  ornaments to a philosophical poem, and are occasionally introduced  either as represented by the poets, or preserved on the numerous gems  and medallions of antiquity.

Stay! whose false lips seductive simpers part,       While Cunning nestles in the harlot-heart!--    5  For you no Dryads dress the roseate bower,       For you no Nymphs their sparkling vases pour;       Unmark'd by you, light Graces swim the green,       And hovering Cupids aim their shafts, unseen.           \"But THOU! whose mind the well-attemper'd ray   10  Of Taste and Virtue lights with purer day;       Whose finer sense each soft vibration owns       With sweet responsive sympathy of tones;       So the fair flower expands it's lucid form       To meet the sun, and shuts it to the storm;--   15  For thee my borders nurse the fragrant wreath,       My fountains murmur, and my zephyrs breathe;       Slow slides the painted snail, the gilded fly       Smooths his fine down, to charm thy curious eye;       On twinkling fins my pearly nations play,   20  Or win with sinuous train their trackless way;       My plumy pairs in gay embroidery dress'd       Form with ingenious bill the pensile nest,       To Love's sweet notes attune the listening dell,       And Echo sounds her soft symphonious shell.      [ _So the fair flower_. l. 13. It seems to have been the original design  of the philosophy of Epicurus to render the mind exquisitely sensible to  agreeable sensations, and equally insensible to disagreeable ones.]       25    \"And, if with Thee some hapless Maid should stray,       Disasterous Love companion of her way,       Oh, lead her timid steps to yonder glade,       Whose arching cliffs depending alders shade;       There, as meek Evening wakes her temperate breeze,   30  And moon-beams glimmer through the trembling trees,       The rills, that gurgle round, shall soothe her ear,       The weeping rocks shall number tear for tear;       There as sad Philomel, alike forlorn,       Sings to the Night from her accustomed thorn;   35  While at sweet intervals each falling note       Sighs in the gale, and whispers round the grot;       The sister-woe shall calm her aching breast,       And softer slumbers steal her cares to rest.--      [_Disasterous Love_. l. 26. The scenery is taken from a botanic garden  about a mile from Lichfield, where a cold bath was erected by Sir John  Floyer. There is a grotto surrounded by projecting rocks, from the edges  of which trickles a perpetual shower of water; and it is here  represented as adapted to love-scenes, as being thence a proper  residence for the modern goddess of Botany, and the easier to introduce  the next poem on the Loves of the Plants according to the system of  Linneus.]             \"Winds of the North! restrain your icy gales,   40  Nor chill the bosom of these happy vales!       Hence in dark heaps, ye gathering Clouds, revolve!       Disperse, ye Lightnings! and, ye Mists, dissolve!       --Hither, emerging from yon orient skies,       BOTANIC GODDESS! bend thy radiant eyes;   45  O'er these soft scenes assume thy gentle reign,       Pomona, Ceres, Flora in thy train;       O'er the still dawn thy placid smile effuse,"]]]
