She was  like Dill in that respect: nice and good-natured and smiling--only  Dill smiled but seldom--and yet always managing to make you give up  your own wishes. He wished vaguely that the wanderings of Dill would  bring them back to the Double-Crank country, instead of leading them  always farther afield. He did not, however, admit openly to himself  that he wanted to see Miss Bridger again; yet he did permit himself  to wonder if she ever played coon-can with any one else, or if she had  already forgotten the game. Probably she had, and--well, a good many  other things that he remembered quite distinctly.    Later, when they had reached town, were warmed and fed and when even  Billy was thinking seriously of sleep, Dill came over and sat down  beside him solemnly, folded his bony hands upon knees quite as bony,  regarded pensively the generously formed foot dangling some distance  before him and smiled his puckered smile.    \"I have been wondering, William, if you had not some plan of your own  concerning this cattle-raising business, which you think is better  than mine but which you hesitate to express. If you have, I hope you  will feel quite free to--er--lay it before the head of the firm. It  may interest you to know that I have, as you would put it, 'failed to  connect' with Mr. Robinson. So, if you have any ideas--\"    \"Oh, I'm burning up with 'em,\" Charming Billy retorted in a way he  meant to be sarcastic, but which Mr. Dill took quite seriously.    \"Then I hope you won't hesitate--\"    \"Now look here, Dilly,\" expostulated he, between puffs. \"Recollect,  it's _your_ money that's going to feed the birds--and it's your  privilege to throw it out to suit yourself. Uh course, I might  day-dream about the way I'd start into the cow-business if I was a  millionaire--\"    \"I'm not a millionaire,\" Mr. Dill hastened to correct. \"A couple of  hundred thousand or so, is about all--\"    \"Well, a fellow don't have to pin himself down to just so many dollars  and cents--not when he's building himself a pet dream. And if a fellow  dreams about starting up an outfit of his own, it don't prove he'd  make it stick in reality.\" The tone of Billy, however, did not express  any doubt.    Mr. Dill untangled his legs, crossed them the other way and regarded  the other dangling foot. \"I should like very much,\" he hinted mildly,  \"to have you tell me this--er--day-dream, as you call it.\"    So Charming Billy, tilted back in his chair and watching with  half-shut eyes the intangible smoke-wreath from his cigarette, found  words for his own particular air-castle which he had builded on sunny  days when the Double-Crank herds grazed peacefully around him; or on  stormy nights when he sat alone in the line-camp and played solitaire  with the mourning wind crooning accompaniment; or on long rides alone,  when the trail was plain before him and the grassland stretched away  and away to a far sky-line, and the white clouds sailed sleepily over  his head and about him the meadowlarks sang. And while he found the  words, he somehow forgot Dill, long and lean and lank, listening  beside him, and spoke more freely than he had meant to do when Dill  first opened the subject a few minutes before.    \"Recollect, this is just a day-dream,\" he began. \"But, if I was a  millionaire, or if I had two hundred thousand dollars--and to me they  don't sound much different--I'd sure start a cow-outfit right away  immediately at once. But I wouldn't buy out nobody; I'd go right back  and start like they did--if they're real old-timers. I'd go down south  into Texas and I'd buy me a bunch uh two-year-olds and bring 'em up  here, and turn 'em loose on the best piece of open range I know--and  I know a peach. In a year or so I'd go back and do the same again, and  I'd keep it up whilst my money held out I'd build me a home ranch back  somewheres in a draw in the hills, where there's lots uh water and  lots uh shelter, and I'd get a bunch uh men that savvied cow-brutes,  put 'em on horses that wouldn't trim down their self-respect every  time they straddled 'em, and then I'd just ride around and watch  myself get rich. And--\" He stopped and dreamed silently over his  cigarette.    \"And then?\" urged Mr. Dill, after a moment.    \"And then--I'd likely get married, and raise a bunch uh boys to carry  on the business when I got old and fat, and too damn' lazy to ride off  a walk.\"    Mr. Dill took three minutes to weigh the matter. Then, musingly: \"I'm  not sure about the boys. I'm not a marrying man, myself--but just  giving a snap judgment on the other part of it, I will say it  sounds--well, feasible.\"          CHAPTER IX.    _The \"Double-Crank.\"_      The weeks that followed immediately after bulged big with the things  which Billy must do or have done. For to lie on one's back in the sun  with one's hat pulled low, dreaming lazily and with minute detail the  perfect supervision of a model cow-outfit from its very inception  up through the buying of stock and the building of corrals and the  breaking of horses to the final shipping of great trainloads of sleek  beef, is one thing; to start out in reality to do all that, with  the hundred little annoyances and hindrances which come not to one's  dreaming in the sun, is something quite different.    But with all the perplexities born of his changed condition and the  responsibility it brought him, Billy rejoiced in the work and airily  planned the years to come--years in which he would lead Alexander P.  Dill straight into the ranks of the Western millionaires; years when  the sun of prosperity would stand always straight overhead, himself  a Joshua who would, by his uplifted hands, keep it there with never a  cloud to dim the glory of its light.    For the first time in his life he rode over Texas prairies and lost  thereby some ideals and learned many things, the while he spent  more money than he had ever owned--or ever expected to own--as the  preliminary to making his pet dream come true; truth to tell, it  mattered little to Billy Boyle whether his dream came true for himself  or for another, so long as he himself were the chief magician.    So it was with a light heart that he swung down from the train  at Tower, after his homing flight, and saw Dill, conspicuous as a  flagstaff, waiting for him on the platform, his face puckered into a  smile of welcome and his bony fingers extended ready to grip painfully  the hand of Charming Billy.    \"I'm very glad to see you back, William,\" he greeted earnestly. \"I  hope you are well, and that you met with no misfortune while you were  away. I have been very anxious for your return, as I need your advice  upon a matter which seems to me of prime importance. I did not wish  to make any decisive move until I had consulted with you, and time is  pressing. Did you--er--buy as many cattle as you expected to get?\" It  seemed to Billy that there was an anxious note in his voice. \"Your  letters were too few and too brief to keep me perfectly informed of  your movements.\"    \"Why, everything was lovely at my end uh the trail, Dilly--only I fell  down on them four thousand two-year-olds. Parts uh the country was  quarantined for scab, and I went way around them places. And I was  too late to see the cattlemen in a bunch when they was at the  Association--only you ain't likely to savvy that part uh the  business--and had to chase 'em all over the country. Uh course it was  my luck to have 'em stick their prices up on the end of a pole, where  I didn't feel like climbing after 'em. So I only contracted for a  couple uh thousand to be laid down in Billings somewhere between the  first and the tenth of June, at twenty-one dollars a head. It was  the best I could do this year--but next winter I can go down earlier,  before the other buyers beat me to it, and do a lot better. Don't yuh  worry, Dilly; it ain't serious.\"    On the contrary, Dill looked relieved, and Billy could not help  noticing it. His own face clouded a little. Perhaps Dill had lost his  money, or the bulk of it, and they couldn't do all the things they  had meant to do, after all; how else, thought Billy uneasily, could  he look like that over what should ordinarily be something of a  disappointment? He remembered that Dill, after the workings of  the cattle business from the very beginning had been painstakingly  explained to him just before Billy started south, had been anxious  to get at least four thousand head of young stock on the range that  spring. Something must have gone wrong. Maybe a bank had gone  busted or something like that. Billy stole a glance up at the other,  shambling silently along beside him, and decided that something had  certainly happened--and on the heels of that he remembered oddly that  he had felt almost exactly like this when Miss Bridger had asked him  to show her where was the coffee, and there _wasn't_ any coffee. There  was the same heavy feeling in his chest, and the same--    \"I wrote you a letter three or four days ago--on the third, to be  exact,\" Dill was saying. \"I don't suppose it reached you, however. I  was going to have you meet me in Hardup; but then your telegram was  forwarded to me there and I came on here at once. I only arrived this  morning. I think that after we have something to eat we would better  start out immediately, unless you have other plans. I drove over in  a rig, and as the horses have rested several hours and are none the  worse for the drive, I think we can easily make the return trip this  afternoon.\"    \"You're the doctor,\" assented Billy briefly, more uneasy than  before and yet not quite at the point of asking questions. In his  acquaintance with Dill he had learned that it was not always wise to  question too closely; where Dill wished to give his confidence he gave  it freely, but beyond the limit he had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12225"],[0,"Tales of lonely trails (#10)"],[1,"face from a branch. R.C. added several  more black-and-blue spots to his already spotted anatomy, and he  missed, just by an inch, a solid snag that would have broken him  in two. The pack stretched out in wild staccato chorus, the little  Airedales literally screeching. Jim got out of our sight and then  Sampson. Still it was ever more thrilling to follow by sound rather  than sight. They led up a thick, steep slope. Here we got into trouble  in the windfalls of timber and the pack drew away from us, up over the  mountain. We were half way up when we heard them jump the bear. The  forest seemed full of strife and bays and yelps. We heard the dogs go  down again to our right, and as we turned we saw Teague and the others  strung out along the edge of the park. They got far ahead of us. When  we reached the bottom of the slope they were out of sight, but we  could hear them yell. The hounds were working around on another slope,  from which craggy rocks loomed above the timber. R.C.'s horse lunged  across the park and appeared to be running off from mine. I was a  little to the right, and when my horse got under way, full speed, we  had the bad luck to plunge suddenly into soft ground. He went to his  knees, and I sailed out of the saddle fully twenty feet, to alight all  spread out and to slide like a plow. I did not seem to be hurt. When I  got up my horse was coming and he appeared to be patient with me, but  he was in a hurry. Before we got across the wet place R.C. was out of  sight. I decided that instead of worrying about him I had better think  about myself. Once on hard ground my horse fairly charged into the  woods and we broke brush and branches as if they had been punk. It  was again open forest, then a rocky slope, and then a flat ridge with  aisles between the trees. Here I heard the melodious notes of Teague's  hunting horn, and following that, the full chorus of the hounds. They  had treed the bear. Coming into still more open forest, with rocks  here and there, I caught sight of R.C. far ahead, and soon I had  glimpses of the other horses, and lastly, while riding full tilt, I  spied a big, black, glistening bear high up in a pine a hundred yards  or more distant.    Slowing down I rode up to the circle of frenzied dogs and excited men.  The boys were all jabbering at once. Teague was beaming. R.C. sat his  horse, and it struck me that he looked sorry for the bear.    \"Fifteen minutes!\" ejaculated Teague, with a proud glance at Old Jim  standing with forepaws up on the pine.    Indeed it had been a short and ringing chase.    All the time while I fooled around trying to photograph the treed  bear, R.C. sat there on his horse, looking upward.    \"Well, gentlemen, better kill him,\" said Teague, cheerfully. \"If he  gets rested he'll come down.\"    It was then I suggested to R.C. that he do the shooting.    \"Not much!\" he exclaimed.    The bear looked really pretty perched up there. He was as round as a  barrel and black as jet and his fur shone in the gleams of sunlight.  His tongue hung out, and his plump sides heaved, showing what a quick,  hard run he had made before being driven to the tree. What struck me  most forcibly about him was the expression in his eyes as he looked  down at those devils of hounds. He was scared. He realized his peril.  It was utterly impossible for me to see Teague's point of view.    \"Go ahead--and plug him,\" I replied to my brother. \"Get it over.\"    \"You do it,\" he said.    \"No, I won't.\"    \"Why not--I'd like to know?\"    \"Maybe we won't have so good a chance again--and I want you to get  your bear,\" I replied.    \"Why it's like--murder,\" he protested.    \"Oh, not so bad as that,\" I returned, weakly. \"We need the meat. We've  not had any game meat, you know, except ducks and grouse.\"    \"You won't do it?\" he added, grimly.    \"No, I refuse.\"    Meanwhile the young ranchers gazed at us with wide eyes and the  expression on Teague's honest, ruddy face would have been funny under  other circumstances.    \"That bear will come down an' mebbe kill one of my dogs,\" he  protested.    \"Well, he can come for all I care,\" I replied, positively, and I  turned away.    I heard R.C. curse low under his breath. Then followed the spang of his  .35 Remington. I wheeled in time to see the bear straining upward in  terrible convulsion, his head pointed high, with blood spurting from his  nose. Slowly he swayed and fell with a heavy crash.    [Illustration: CROSSING THE COLORADO RIVER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAND  CANYON]    [Illustration: WHERE ROLLS THE COLORADO]    The next bear chase we had was entirely different medicine.    Off in the basin under the White Slides, back of our camp, the hounds  struck a fresh track and in an instant were out of sight. With the  cowboy Vern setting the pace we plunged after them. It was rough  country. Bogs, brooks, swales, rocky little parks, stretches of timber  full of windfalls, groves of aspens so thick we could scarcely squeeze  through--all these obstacles soon allowed the hounds to get far away.  We came out into a large park, right under the mountain slope, and  here we sat our horses listening to the chase. That trail led around  the basin and back near to us, up the thick green slope, where high up  near a ledge we heard the pack jump this bear. It sounded to us as if  he had been roused out of a sleep.    \"I'll bet it's one of the big grizzlies we've heard about,\" said  Teague.    That was something to my taste. I have seen a few grizzlies. Riding  to higher ground I kept close watch on the few open patches up on the  slope. The chase led toward us for a while. Suddenly I saw a big bear  with a frosted coat go lumbering across one of these openings.    \"Silvertip! Silvertip!\" I yelled at the top of my lungs. \"I saw him!\"    My call thrilled everybody. Vern spurred his horse and took to the  right. Teague advised that we climb the slope. So we made for the  timber. Once there we had to get off and climb on foot. It was steep,  rough, very hard work. I had on chaps and spurs. Soon I was hot,  laboring, and my heart began to hurt. We all had to rest. The baying  of the hounds inspirited us now and then, but presently we lost it.  Teague said they had gone over the ridge and as soon as we got up to  the top we would hear them again. We struck an elk trail with fresh  elk tracks in it. Teague said they were just ahead of us. I never  climbed so hard and fast in my life. We were all tuckered out when we  reached the top of the ridge. Then to our great disappointment we did  not hear the hounds. Mounting we rode along the crest of this wooded  ridge toward the western end, which was considerably higher. Once on  a bare patch of ground we saw where the grizzly had passed. The big,  round tracks, toeing in a little, made a chill go over me. No doubt of  its being a silvertip!    We climbed and rode to the high point, and coming out upon the summit  of the mountain we all heard the deep, hoarse baying of the pack. They  were in the canyon down a bare grassy slope and over a wooded bench  at our feet. Teague yelled as he spurred down. R.C. rode hard in his  tracks.    But my horse was new to this bear chasing. He was mettlesome, and he  did not want to do what I wanted. When I jabbed the spurs into his  flanks he nearly bucked me off. I was looking for a soft place to  light when he quit. Long before I got down that open slope Teague and  R.C. had disappeared. I had to follow their tracks. This I did at a  gallop, but now and then lost the tracks, and had to haul in to find  them. If I could have heard the hounds from there I would have gone on  anyway. But once down in the jack-pines I could hear neither yell or  bay. The pines were small, close together, and tough. I hurt my hands,  scratched my face, barked my knees. The horse had a habit of suddenly  deciding to go the way he liked instead of the way I guided him, and  when he plunged between saplings too close together to permit us both  to go through, it was exceedingly hard on me. I was worked into a  frenzy. Suppose R.C. should come face to face with that old grizzly  and fail to kill him! That was the reason for my desperate hurry. I  got a crack on the head that nearly blinded me. My horse grew hot and  began to run in every little open space. He could scarcely be held in.  And I, with the blood hot in me too, did not hold him hard enough.    It seemed miles across that wooded bench. But at last I reached  another slope. Coming out upon a canyon rim I heard R.C. and Teague  yelling, and I heard the hounds fighting the grizzly. He was growling  and threshing about far below. I had missed the tracks made by Teague  and my brother, and it was necessary to find them. That slope looked  impassable. I rode back along the rim, then forward. Finally I found  where the ground was plowed deep and here I headed my horse. He had  been used to smooth roads and he could not take these jumps. I went  forward on his neck. But I hung on and spurred him hard. The mad  spirit of that chase had gotten into him too. All the time I could  hear the fierce baying and yelping of the hounds, and occasionally I  heard a savage bawl from the bear. I literally plunged, slid, broke a  way down that mountain slope, riding all the time, before I discovered  the footprints of Teague and R.C. They had walked, leading their  horses. By this time I was so mad I would not get off. I rode all the  way down that steep slope of dense saplings, loose rock slides and  earth, and jumble of splintered cliff. That he did not break my  neck and his own spoke the truth about that roan horse. Despite his  inexperience he was great. We fell over one bank, but a thicket of  aspens saved us from rolling. The avalanches slid from under us until  I imagined that the grizzly would be scared. Once as I stopped to  listen I heard bear and pack farther down the canyon--heard them above  the roar of a rushing stream. They went on and I lost"]]]
