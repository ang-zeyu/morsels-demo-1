What was the possible origin of this story?  (_Hist.  Bible_ I, 87.)  What are the important religious teachings of this  story?  Were great calamities in the past usually the result of  wickedness?  Are they to-day?  Do people so interpret the  destruction of San Francisco and Messina?  The great epidemic of  cholera in Hamburg in 1892 was clearly the result of a gross  neglect of sanitary precautions in regard to the water supply.  At  that date the cholera germ had not been clearly identified and  there was some doubt regarding the means by which the disease was  spread.  Was sanitary neglect then as much of a sin as it would be  now?  May we properly say that the pestilence was a calamity  visited on that city as a punishment for its sin of neglect?    Why did the prophets preserve the story of the sacrifices of Isaac?  Compare the parallel teaching in Micah 6:6-8.      With what shall I come before Jehovah,    Bow myself before the God on high?    Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings,    With calves a year old?    Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams,    With myriads of streams of oil?    Shall I give him my first-born for my guilt,    The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?    Which is the most important teaching of the story: the importance  of an unquestioning faith and obedience, or the needlessness of  human sacrifice?  Does God ever command any person to do anything  that the person thinks wrong?      III.    THE PROPHETIC PORTRAIT OF ABRAHAM.    In the so-called later priestly stories regarding Abraham (see  especially Gen. 17) he is portrayed as a devoted servant of the  law, chiefly intent upon observing the simple ceremonial  institutions revealed to him in that primitive age.  With him the  later priests associated the origin of the distinctive rite of  circumcision.  In Genesis 14 Abraham is pictured as a valiant  warrior who espoused the cause of the weak and won a great victory  over the united armies of the Eastern kings.  Like a knight of  olden times, he restored the captured spoil to the city that had  been robbed and gave a liberal portion, to the priest king  Melchizedek, who appears to have been regarded in later Jewish  tradition as the forerunner of the Jerusalem priesthood.  In the  still later Jewish traditions, of which many have been preserved,  he is pictured sometimes as an invincible warrior, before whom even  the great city of Damascus fell, sometimes as an ardent foe of  idolatry, the incarnation of the spirit of later Judaism, or else  he is thought of as having been borne to heaven on a fiery chariot,  where he receives to his bosom the faithful of his race.  Thus each  succeeding generation or group of writers made Abraham, as the  traditional father of their race, the embodiment of their highest  ideals.    The Abraham of the early prophetic narratives, however, is a  remarkably consistent character.  He exemplifies that which is  noblest in Israel's early ideals.  How is Abraham's faith  illustrated in the prophetic stories considered in the preceding  paragraph?  His unselfishness and generosity?  His courtly  hospitality?  Was his politeness to strangers simply due to his  training and the traditions of the desert or was it the expression  of his natural impulses?  Was Abraham's devoted interest in the  future of his descendants a noble quality?  How are his devotion  and obedience to God illustrated?  In the light of this study  describe the Abraham of the prophetic narratives.  Is it a perfect  character that is thus portrayed?  Is it the product of a primitive  state of society or of a high civilization?      IV.    THE TENDENCY TO IDEALIZE NATIONAL HEROES.    Is Shakespeare right in his statement that \"The evil that men do  lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones\"?  Why  do men as a rule idealize the dead?  Does the primitive tendency to  ancestor worship in part explain this?  Is the tendency to idealize  the men of the past beneficial in its effect upon the race?  What  would be the effect if all the iniquity of the past were  remembered?  The tendency to idealize national heroes is by no  means confined to the Hebrews.  Greek, Roman and English history  abounds in illustrations.  Cite some of the more striking.  Why are  they often thought of as descendants of the gods?  Compare the  popular conception of the first president of the United States and  his character as portrayed in Ford's \"The Real George Washington.\"  The portraits of national heroes, even though they are idealized,  exert a powerful and wholesome influence upon the nations who honor  their memory.  The noblest ideals in each succeeding generation are  often thus concretely embodied in the character of some national  hero.  Compare the great heroes of Greek mythology with the early  heroes of the Old Testament.  Do these differences correspond to  the distinctive characteristics of the Greeks and the Hebrews?  Are  these differences due to the peculiar genius of each race or in  part to the influence exerted by the ideals thus concretely  presented upon each succeeding generation?  Is it probable that in  the character of Abraham the traditional father of the Hebrew race  was idealized?  Is it possible that teachers of Israel, consciously  or unconsciously, fostered this tendency that they might in this  concrete and effective way impress their great teachings upon their  race?  If so, does it decrease or enhance the value and authority  of these stories?      V.    THE REASONS FOB MIGRATION.    In the early history of most countries there comes a pressure of  population upon the productive powers of the land.  As numbers  increase in the hunting stage game becomes scarce and more hunting  grounds are needed.  Tribes migrate from season to season, as did  the American Indians, and eventually some members of the tribe are  likely to go forth to seek new homes.  Later in the pastoral stage  of society, as the wealth of flocks and herds increases, more  pasturage is needed and similar results follow.  Even after  agriculture is well established and commerce is well begun, as in  Ancient Greece, colonies have a like origin.  In the England of the  nineteenth century Malthus and his followers taught the tendency of  population to outgrow the means of subsistence--a tendency overcome  only by restraints on the growth of population, or by new  inventions that enable new sources of supply to be secured or that  render the old ones more efficient.  Emigration and pioneering are  thus a normal outgrowth of a progressive growing people in any  stage of civilization.  What does the statement about Abraham's  wealth in cattle and silver and gold show regarding the country  from which he came and the probable cause of God's direction for  his removal?    Immigrants and pioneers are usually the self-reliant and  courageous, who dare to endure hardships and incur risks to secure  for their country and posterity the benefits of new lands and  broader opportunity.  The trials of new and untried experiences and  often of dire peril strengthen the character already strong, so  that the pioneers in all lands and ages have been heroes whose  exploits recounted in song and story have stirred the hearts and  molded the faith of their descendants through many generations.  In  the light of later history what was the profound religious  significance to his race and to the world, of the migration  represented by Abraham?  The Biblical narrative does not state the  exact way in which Jehovah spoke to Abraham.  Is it possible and  probable that God spoke to men in that early day as he speaks to  them now, through their experiences and inner consciousness?  In  what sense was Abraham a pioneer?    Was it for Abraham's material interest to migrate to Canaan?      VI.    THE PERMANENT VALUE AND INFLUENCE OF THE ABRAHAM NARRATIVES.    Scholars will probably never absolutely agree regarding many  problems connected with Abraham.  Some have gone so far as to  question whether he was an historical character or not.  Is the  question of fundamental importance?  Other writers declare it  probable that a tribal sheik by the name of Abraham led one of the  many nomad tribes that somewhere about the middle of the second  millenium B.C. moved westward into the territory of Palestine.  It  is probable that popular tradition has preserved certain facts  regarding his life and character.  It is equally clear that the  different groups of Israel's teachers have each interpreted his  character and work in keeping with their distinctive ideals.  Each  individual narrative has an independent unity and the connection  between the different accounts is far from close.  Some of them aim  to explain the derivation of popular names, as for example,  Abraham, Isaac, and Ishmael, the sanctity of certain sacred places,  as for example, Beersheba, the origin of important institutions, as  for example, circumcision and the substitution of animal for human  sacrifice, and the explanation of striking physical phenomena, as  for example the desolate shores of the Dead Sea.    Some of these accounts, like the table of nations in Genesis 10,  preserve the memory of the relationship between Israel and its  neighbors.  They preserve also the characteristic popular record of  the early migrations which brought these peoples to Palestine,  where they crystalized into the different nations that figure in  the drama of Israel's history.  The permanent and universal value  of these stories lies, however, in the great moral principles which  they vividly and effectively illustrate.  The prophetic portrait of  Abraham was an inspiring example to hold up before a race.  The  characteristics of Abraham can be traced in the ideals and  character of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12436"],[0,"The Night Horseman (#10)"],[1,"amned!\" He added:  \"All right. Hold his head, and I'll ride him without pulling leather. Is  that square?\"    Barry nodded absently. His slender fingers were patting the velvet nose  of the stallion and he was talking to it in an affectionate  undertone--meaningless words, perhaps, such as a mother uses to soothe a  child. When Strann set his foot in the stirrup and gathered up the reins  the black horse cringed and shuddered; it was not a pleasant thing to  see; it was like a dog crouching under the suspended whip. It was worse  than that; it was almost the horror of a man who shivers at the touch of  an unclean animal. There was not a sound from the crowd; and every grin  was wiped out. Jerry Strann swung into the saddle lightly.    There he sat, testing the stirrups. They were too short by inches but he  refused to have them lengthened. He poised his quirt and tugged his hat  lower over his eyes.    \"Turn him loose!\" he shouted. \"Hei!\"    And his shrill yell went down the street and the echoes sent it barking  back from wall to wall; Barry stepped back from the head of the black.  But for an instant the horse did not stir. He was trembling violently,  but his blazing eyes were fixed upon the face of his owner. Barry raised  his hand.    And then it happened. It was like the release of a coiled watch-spring;  the black whirled as a top spins and Strann sagged far to the left;  before he could recover the stallion was away in a flash, like a racer  leaving the barrier and reaching full speed in almost a stride. Not  far--hardly the breadth of the street--before he pitched up in a long  leap as if to clear a barrier, landed stiff-legged with a sickening jar,  whirled again like a spinning top, and darted straight back. And Jerry  Strann pulled leather--with might and main--but the short stirrups were  against him, and above all the suddenness of the start had taken him off  guard for all his readiness. When the stallion dropped stiff-legged  Jerry was thrown forward and an unlucky left foot jarred loose from the  stirrup; and when the horse whirled Strann was flung from the saddle. It  was a clean fall. He twisted over in the air as he fell and landed in  deep dust. The black stallion had reached his master and now he turned,  in that same catlike manner, and watched with pricking ears as Strann  dragged himself up from the dust.    There was no shout of laughter--no cheer for that fall, and without a  smile they watched Strann returning. Big O'Brien had seen from his open  door and now he laid a hand on the shoulder of one of the men and  whispered at his ear: \"There's going to be trouble; bad trouble, Billy.  Go for Fatty Matthews--he's a deputy marshal now--and get him here as  quick as you can. Run!\"    The other spared time for a last glance at Strann and then hurried down  the street.    Now, a man who can lose and smile is generally considered the most  graceful of failures, but the smile of Jerry Strann as he walked slowly  back worried his followers.    \"We all hit dust sometime,\" he philosophized. \"But one try don't prove  nothin'. I ain't near through with that hoss!\"    Barry turned to Strann. If there had been mockery in his eyes or a  smile on his lips as he faced Jerry there would have been a gun play on  the spot; but, instead, the brown eyes were as dumbly apologetic as  ever.    \"We didn't talk about two tries,\" he observed.    \"We talk about it now,\" said Strann.    There was one man in the crowd a little too old to be dangerous and  therefore there was one man who was in a position to speak openly to  Strann. It was big O'Brien.    \"Jerry, you named your game and made your play and lost. I guess you  ain't going to turn up a hard loser. Nobody plays twice for the same  pot.\"    The hazel eye of Strann was grey with anguish of the spirit as he looked  from O'Brien to the crowd and from the crowd to Satan, and from Satan to  his meek-eyed owner. Nowhere was there a defiant eye or a glint of scorn  on which he could wreak his wrath. He stood poised in his anger for the  space of a breath; then, in the sharp struggle, his better nature  conquered.    \"Come on in, all of you,\" he called. \"We'll liquor, and forget this.\"          CHAPTER IX    BATTLE LIGHT      O'Brien pressed close to Barry.    \"Partner,\" he said rapidly, \"you're clear now--you're clear of more hell  that you ever dream. Now climb that hoss of yours and feed him leather  till you get clear of Brownsville--and if I was you I'd never come  within a day's ride of the Three B's again.\"    The mild, brown eyes widened.    \"I don't like crowds,\" murmured Barry.    \"You're wise, kid,\" grinned the bartender--\"a hell of a lot wiser than  you know right now. On your way!\"    And he turned to follow the crowd into the saloon. But Jerry Strann  stood at the swinging doors, watching, and he saw Barry linger behind.    \"Are you coming?\" he called.    \"I got an engagement,\" answered the meek voice.    \"You got another engagement here,\" mocked Strann. \"Understand?\"    The other hesitated for an instant, and then sighed deeply. \"I suppose  I'll stay,\" he murmured, and walked into the bar. Jerry Strann was  smiling in the way that showed his teeth. As Barry passed he said  softly: \"I see we ain't going to have no trouble, you and me!\" and he  moved to clap his strong hand on the shoulder of the smaller man. Oddly  enough, the hand missed, for Barry swerved from beneath it as a wolf  swerves from the shadow of a falling branch. No perceptible effort--no  sudden start of tensed muscles, but a movement so smooth that it was  almost unnoticeable. But the hand of Strann fell through thin air.    \"You're quick,\" he said. \"If you was as quick with your hands as you are  with your feet----\"    Barry paused and the melancholy brown eyes dwelt on the face of Strann.    \"Oh, hell!\" snorted the other, and turned on his heel to the bar. \"Drink  up!\" he commanded.    A shout and a snarl from the further end of the room.    \"A wolf, by God!\" yelled one of the men.    The owner of the animal made his way with unobtrusive swiftness the  length of the room and stood between the dog and a man who fingered the  butt of his gun nervously.    \"He won't hurt you none,\" murmured that softly assuring voice.    \"The hell he won't!\" responded the other. \"He took a pass at my leg just  now and dam' near took it off. Got teeth like the blades of a  pocket-knife!\"    \"You're on a cold trail, Sam,\" broke in one of the others. \"That ain't  any wolf. Look at him now!\"    The big, shaggy animal had slunk to the feet of his master and with  head abased stared furtively up into Barry's face. A gesture served as  sufficient command, and he slipped shadow-like into the corner and  crouched with his head on his paws and the incandescent green of his  eyes glimmering; Barry sat down in a chair nearby.    O'Brien was happily spinning bottles and glasses the length of the bar;  there was the chiming of glass and the rumble of contented voices.    \"Red-eye all 'round,\" said the loud voice of Jerry Strann, \"but there's  one out. Who's out? Oh, it's _him_. Hey O'Brien, lemonade for the lady.\"    It brought a laugh, a deep, good-natured laugh, and then a chorus of  mockery; but Barry stepped unconfused to the bar, accepted the glass of  lemonade, and when the others downed their fire-water, he sipped his  drink thoughtfully. Outside, the wind had risen, and it shook the hotel  and carried a score of faint voices as it whirred around corners and  through cracks. Perhaps it was one of those voices which made the big  dog lift its head from its paws and whine softly! surely it was  something he heard which caused Barry to straighten at the bar and cant  his head slightly to one side--but, as certainly, no one else in the  barroom heard it. Barry set down his glass.    \"Mr. Strann?\" he called.    And the gentle voice carried faintly down through the uproar of the bar.    \"Sister wants to speak to you,\" suggested O'Brien to Strann.    \"Well?\" roared the latter, \"what d'you want?\"    The others were silent to listen; and they smiled in anticipation.    \"If you don't mind, much,\" said the musical voice, \"I think I'll be  moving along.\"    There is an obscure little devil living in all of us. It makes the child  break his own toys; it makes the husband strike the helpless wife; it  makes the man beat the cringing, whining dog. The greatest of American  writers has called it the Imp of the Perverse. And that devil came in  Jerry Strann and made his heart small and cold. If he had been by nature  the bully and the ruffian there would have been no point in all that  followed, but the heart of Jerry Strann was ordinarily as warm as the  yellow sunshine itself; and it was a common saying in the Three B's that  Jerry Strann would take from a child what he would not endure from a  mountain-lion. Women loved Jerry Strann, and children would crowd about  his knees, but this day the small demon was in him.    \"You want to be moving along\" mimicked the devil in Jerry Strann. \"Well,  you wait a while. I ain't through with you yet. Maybe--\" he paused and  searched his mind. \"You've given me a fall, and maybe you can give the  rest of us--a laugh!\"    The chuckle of appreciation went up the bar and down it again.    \"I want to ask you,\" went on the devil in Jerry Strann, \"where you got  your hoss?\"    \"He was running wild,\" came the gentle answer. \"So I took a walk, one  day, and brought him in.\"    A pause.    \"Maybe,\" grinned the big man, \"you creased him?\"    For it is one of the most difficult things in the world to capture a  wild horse, and some hunters, in their desperation at seeing the  wonderful animals escape, have tried to \"crease\" them. That is, they  strive to shoot so that the bullet will barely graze the top of the  animal's vertebrae, just behind the ears, stunning the horse and making  it helpless for the capture. But necessarily such shots are made from a  distance, and little short of a"]]]
