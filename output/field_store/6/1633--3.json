Separate one side from the back-bone, so that it will lie open without  being split in two; wash it clean, dry it with a cloth, sprinkle some  salt and pepper on it, and let it stand till you are ready to broil it;  have the gridiron hot and well greased, broil it nicely, and pour over  it melted butter.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BOIL ROCK FISH.    The best part of the rock is the head and shoulders--clean it nicely,  put it into the fish kettle with cold water and salt, boil it gently and  skim it well; when done, drain off the water, lay it in the dish, and  garnish with scraped horse-radish; have two boats of tatter nicely  melted with chopped parsley, or for a change, you may have anchovy  butter; the roe and liver should be fried and served in separate dishes.  If any of the rock be left, it will make a delicious dish next  day;--pick it in small pieces, put it in a stew pan with a gill of  water, a good lump of butter, some salt, a large spoonful of lemon  pickle, and one of pepper vinegar--shake it over the fire till perfectly  hot, and serve it up. It is almost equal to stewed crab.           *       *       *       *       *    TO FRY PERCH.    Clean the fish nicely, but do not take out the roes, dry them on a  cloth, sprinkle some salt, and dredge them with flour, lay them  separately on a board; when one side is dry, turn them, sprinkle salt  and dredge the other side; be sure the lard boils when you put the fish  in, and fry them with great care; they should be a yellowish brown when  done. Send melted butter or anchovy sauce in a boat.           *       *       *       *       *    TO PICKLE OYSTERS.    Select the largest oysters, drain off their liquor, and wash them in  clean water; pick out the pieces of shells that may be left, put them in  a stew pan with water proportioned to the number of oysters, some salt,  blades of mace, and whole black pepper; stew them a few minutes, then  put them in a pot, and when cold, add as much pale vinegar as will give  the liquor an agreeable acid.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE A CURRY OF CATFISH.    Take the white channel catfish, cut off their heads, skin and clean  them, cut them in pieces four inches long, put as many as will be  sufficient for a dish into a stew pan with a quart of water, two onions,  and chopped parsley; let them stew gently till the water is reduced to  half a pint, take the fish out and lay them on a dish, cover them to  keep them hot, rub a spoonful of butter into one of flour, add a large  tea-spoonful of curry powder, thicken the gravy with it, shake it over  the fire a few minutes, and pour it over the fish; be careful to have  the gravy smooth.           *       *       *       *       *    TO DRESS A COD'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS.    Take out the gills and the blood from the bone, wash the head very  clean, rub over it a little salt, then lay it on your fish plate; throw  in the water a good handful of salt, with a glass of vinegar, then put  in the fish, and let it boil gently half an hour; if it is a large one,  three quarters; take it up very carefully, strip the skin nicely off,  set it before a brisk fire, dredge it all over with flour, and baste it  well with butter; when the froth begins to rise, throw over it some very  fine white bread crumbs; you must keep basting it all the time to make  it froth well; when it is a fine light brown, dish it up, and garnish it  with a lemon cut in slices, scraped horse-radish, barberries, a few  small fish fried and laid around it, or fried oysters--cut the roe and  liver in slices, and lay over it a little of the lobster out of the  sauce in lumps, and then serve it up.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE SAUCE FOR THE COD'S HEAD.    Take a lobster, if it be alive, stick a skewer in the rent of the tail,  (to keep the water out,) throw a handful of salt in the water; when it  boils, put in the lobster, and boil it half an hour; if it has spawn on  it, pick them off, and pound them exceedingly fine in a marble mortar,  and put them into half a pound of good melted butter, then take the meat  out of the lobster, pull it in bits, and put it in your butter, with a  meat spoonful of lemon pickle, and the same of walnut catsup, a slice of  lemon, one or two slices of horse-radish, a little beaten mace, salt and  cayenne to your taste; boil them one minute, then take out the  horse-radish and lemon, and serve it up in your sauce boat.    N.B. If you cannot get lobsters, you may make shrimp, cockle, or muscle  sauce, the same way; if there can be no shell fish got, you then may add  two anchovies cut small, a spoonful of walnut liquor, a large onion  stuck with cloves--strain and put it in the sauce boat.           *       *       *       *       *    TO DRESS A SALT COD.    Steep your salt fish in water all night, with a glass of vinegar; it  will take out the salt, and make it taste like fresh fish; the next day  boil it; when it is enough take off the skin, pull it in fleaks into  your dish, then pour egg sauce over it, or parsnips boiled and beat  fine, with butter and cream; send it to the table on a water plate, for  it will soon grow cold.           *       *       *       *       *    MATELOTE OF ANY KIND OF FIRM FISH.    Cut the fish in pieces six inches long, put it in a pot with onion,  parsley, thyme, mushrooms, a little spice, pepper and salt--add red wine  and water enough for gravy, set it on a quick fire and reduce it  one-third, thicken with a spoonful of butter and two of flour; put it in  a dish with bits of bread fried in butter, and pour the gravy over it.           *       *       *       *       *    CHOWDER, A SEA DISH.    Take any kind of firm fish, cut it in pieces six inches long, sprinkle  salt and pepper over each piece, cover the bottom of a small Dutch oven  with slices of salt pork about half boiled, lay in the fish, strewing a  little chopped onion between; cover with crackers that have been soaked  soft in milk, pour over it two gills of white wine, and two of water;  put on the top of the oven, and stew it gently about an hour; take it  out carefully, and lay it in a deep dish; thicken the gravy with a  little flour and a spoonful of butter, add some chopped parsley, boil it  a few minutes, and pour it over the fish--serve it up hot.           *       *       *       *       *    TO PICKLE STURGEON.    The best sturgeons are the small ones, about four feet long without the  head, and the best part is the one near the tail. After the sturgeon is  split through the back bone, take a piece with the skin on, which is  essential to its appearance and goodness, cut off the gristle, scrape  the skin well, wash it, and salt it--let it lie twenty-four hours, wipe  off the salt, roll it, and tie it around with twine, put it on in a good  deal of cold water, let it boil till you can run a straw easily into the  skin, take it up, pull off the large scales, and when cold, put it in a  pot, and cover it with one part vinegar, and two of salt and water; keep  it closely stopped, and when served, garnish with green fennel.           *       *       *       *       *    TO CAVEACH FISH.    Cut the fish in pieces the thickness of your hand, wash it and dry it in  a cloth, sprinkle on some pepper and salt, dredge it with flour, and fry  it a nice brown; when it gets cold, put it in a pot with a little  chopped onion between the layers, take as much vinegar and water as will  cover it, mix with it some oil, pounded mace, and whole black pepper,  pour it on, and stop the pot closely. This is a very convenient article,  as it makes an excellent and ready addition to a dinner or supper. When  served up, it should be garnished with green fennel, or parsley.           *       *       *       *       *    TO DRESS COD FISH.    Boil the fish tender, pick it from the bones, take an equal quantity of  Irish potatos, or parsnips boiled and chopped, and the same of onions  well boiled; add a sufficiency of melted butter, some grated nutmeg,  pepper, and salt, with a little brandy or wine; rub them in a mortar  till well mixed; if too stiff, liquify it with cream or thickened milk,  put paste in the bottom of a dish, pour in the fish, and bake it. For  change, it may be baked in the form of patties.           *       *       *       *       *    COD FISH PIE.    Soak the fish, boil it and take off the skin, pick the meat from the  bones, and mince it very fine; take double the quantity of your fish, of  stale bread grated; pour over it as much new milk, boiling hot, as will  wet it completely, add minced parsley, nutmeg, pepper, and made mustard,  with as much melted butter as will make it sufficiently rich; the  quantity must be determined by that of the other ingredients--beat these  together very well, add the minced fish, mix it all, cover the bottom of  the dish with good paste, pour the fish in, put on a lid and bake it.           *       *       *       *       *    TO DRESS ANY KIND OF SALTED FISH.    Take the quantity necessary for the dish, wash them, and lay them in  fresh water for a night; then put them on the tin plate with holes, and  place it in the fish kettle--sprinkle over it pounded cloves and pepper,  with four cloves of garlic; put in a bundle of sweet herbs and parsley,  a large spoonful of tarragon, and two of common vinegar, with a pint of  wine; roll one quarter of a pound of butter in two spoonsful of flour,  cut it in small pieces, and put it over the fish--cover it closely, and  simmer it over a slow fire half an hour; take the fish out carefully,  and lay it in the dish, set it over hot water, and cover it till the  gravy has boiled a little longer--take out the garlic and herbs, pour it  over the fish, and serve it up. It is very good when eaten"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12539"],[0,"Observations Upon the Windward Coast of Africa (#10)"],[1," delightful prospect of the meandering  course of the river, interspersed with islands, displaying a great  diversity of appearance.    Smart has very wisely chosen this spot, as it is not only a charming  situation, healthy, and delightful, but well situated to command a very  extensive internal trade in camwood and ivory, besides being contiguous to  the Sherbro, from whence a great portion of the camwood is procured, and  situated on the principal branch of the Sierra Leone. In addition to these  local advantages, he has recently opened a path with the interior,  communicating with the Foolah country, which is entirely under his  influence, and which he can open and shut at pleasure. It would be of  incalculable advantage to any operation to secure the friendship of this  chief: he possesses a very superior mind, and, from his connection with  Bance Island, has acquired a knowledge of European ideas and manners seldom  to be met with among any of the chiefs on this part of the coast. From the  various opportunities I have had to consult Smart on his general sentiments  relative to his country, and the freedom of intercourse I have had with  him, I am well persuaded that he would be a powerful and intelligent  auxiliary in promoting the civilization of his country, upon a liberal  principle, calculated to its condition, and having a tendency to eradicate  its barbarism; but he is one, of many more upon this quarter of the coast,  who have no reliance upon the attempts that have been made, and deplores,  with regret, that through the want of a correct knowledge of the  dispositions of his countrymen, an ignorance of the nature of the evil to  be removed, and the invidious principles which constituted the  establishments that have been formed to promote this beneficent  undertaking, his country is still excluded from the light of truth, and the  refined arts of civilized life.    From Mahera we proceeded to Rochell, another of Mr. Smart's towns, more  insular, where I expected to have met him, in conformity with an  arrangement previously made, to visit him at his towns, and see, as he  observed, his country fashion. Upon our reaching this point of our  expedition, we were saluted by a numerous assemblage of chiefs and natives,  going to join my friend Smart in one of his wars with his opposite  neighbours and rivals, the Cammarancies, inhabiting the country towards the  Port Logo. The cause of quarrel was, that these people had seized upon the  rafts and canoes which brought the camwood over the falls higher up the  river, and had demolished several storehouses belonging to Smart and his  people, engaged in that trade. Smart, with a part of his forces, had  crossed the river only an hour before, and another division were embarking  to join him at a place of rendezvous upon the enemy's territory, with the  intention of cautiously approaching during the night to some of their  towns, and surprising them before they had arisen from sleep. Nothing could  exceed the novelty of this sight; the chiefs and their followers were armed  with their bows and arrows, and other rude implements of war, and  completely in their native character; in addition to their native weapons,  some had musquets, procured from Europeans in trade, swords, and various  other manufacture, supplied by traders, exhibiting an appearance, of which  no idea can be formed, without a personal knowledge of this barbarous  people. The chiefs, in particular, were covered with _gris-gris_ and  _fetishes_, a mixture of feathers and other preposterous materials,  calculated to obliterate any trace of human appearance, and possessing the  virtue, as they conceived, of shielding them from danger. Solemn _palaver_  is always held upon these occasions, and their _gris-gris_ makers, _fetish_  men, and priests, exorcise their absurd decorations, which, in their  estimation, operate as guardian angels in the hour of difficulty and peril.    Having occasion to visit a gentleman resident at some distance, we left our  canoes at Rochell, and proceeded on foot. _Cabba_, one of the chiefs,  accompanied us with a guard, being apprehensive, as he observed, that \"bad  might happen us, as war live in the country.\" We passed through a  remarkably fertile country, presenting an infinite variety of natural  productions. Our path was frequently lined with pine-apples, in all the  luxuriance of nature; but amidst this animating landscape, we beheld  deserted villages, ravaged by the ferocious hand of man; and all the traces  of barbarous devastation. We fell in with several armed parties, with whom  I conversed upon the subject of the war, which appeared to be of a  predatory nature, and the consequence of insatiate avarice and barbarous  habits.    At length we arrived, much fatigued, at Mr. Green's (at Massou), with whom  we rested for the night, receiving every kindness and attention in his  power to bestow. I am indebted to this gentleman for a variety of useful  information relative to a wide extent of country. His education and  acquirements are of the first class, and I could not view such a man,  insulated from polished society, which he was qualified to adorn, and shut  up in the wilds of Africa, among barbarians, without a mixture of pain and  surprise; nor did I depart from him without sympathy and regret, after he  had confided to me his motives, and the outlines of his life, which were  marked with eventful incidents, and extraordinary occurrences.    It was my object to have proceeded from Massou to Rocond, the principal  town of Smart's residence, and from thence to penetrate to the falls of the  river, which, from every information I received, exhibit a sublime scene;  but, on account of the disturbed state of the country, and that chiefs  absence, I was obliged to give up my intention, and return to Rochell, from  whence we rowed down the river to the town of our little hospitable chief,  Billy Manshu; where we stayed the night. The following day we arrived safe  at Miffare; and although Smart had given orders at Mahera to stop all  canoes, we were suffered to pass; the chiefs observing, \"that they knew we  would not tell their enemies, when we came among them, what we saw them  do.\" Had we been strangers, it is more than probable we should have fallen  victims to the fury of these barbarians, who, in the towns we passed, were  excited to a savage fierceness, highly descriptive of the natural ferocity  of the African character.    At Miffare, formerly occupied by Monsieur Berauld, as previously noticed,  who had lately paid the common debt of nature, and who was here buried by  his own desire, I had the opportunity of ascertaining a singular custom  prevalent in this country towards the dead, and which strongly elucidates  the prevailing ideas of its inhabitants, relative to the immortality of the  soul and a future state.    After Monsieur Berauld's interment, his women, and the head people of the  town, assembled round the grave occasionally, for a series of days,  requiring every evening, from Mr. Hodgkin, a candle to light his grave,  which they kept burning during the period of their mourning, under the idea  that it would light him in the other world. In addition to this, a still  more singular rite was performed on this occasion, by Alimami, of the Port  Logo, and a numerous assemblage of natives, who sacrificed a bull to the  departed spirit of Berauld, who was held in great estimation among them.  From authority I cannot doubt, I am persuaded that when slaves have been  redundant, human sacrifices have been offered to the manes of their  favourite chiefs and princes. This horrid custom, which is even extended,  in many of the districts of Africa, to the productions of the earth, is a  most serious subject to contemplate, and a feature of barbarism, pregnant  with melancholy consequences to that class of beings, whom a late  legislative act has abandoned to contingencies, and the uncontrolled power  and avarice of other nations.        CHAPTER VI.          _Return to Bance Island.--General Observations on the Commerce, Religion,  Customs, and Character of the Natives upon the Windward Coast.--An Account  of the requisite Merchandize for Trade, the best Mode of introducing  natural Commerce and Civilization into Africa, &c._      The morning after my last arrival at Miffare I returned to Bance Island;  before I leave it, it may not perhaps be considered as inexpedient at this  stage of my narrative, to submit to my readers an account of the present  state of commerce upon the Windward Coast of Africa, the merchandize used  therein, a general outline of the religion, customs, and character of its  natives,  and the system I conceive eligible, and consistent with the  claims of humanity, by which their intellectual powers may be improved, and  their enslaved state ameliorated; while our commercial ascendency may be  preserved with this region of the earth, and our enemies excluded from  those important advantages, which it only requires intelligence and  enterprise to unfold.    In accomplishing this important part of my duty I beg leave to state, that  my reflections are the result of much deliberation upon the subject,  derived from manifold sources of information, and that I am the zealous  advocate of the radical abolition of the slavery of the human kind. The  motives by which I am actuated are, a philanthropic feeling for my species,  Christian principles, humanity, and justice: however I may differ, in the  means I shall propose, from many truly benevolent characters, yet I trust  that they will do me the justice to consider that my intentions are  congenial with theirs in the cause of humanity.    I shall confine myself to a digested summary of actual observations on the  trade, laws, customs, and manners of the people I have had occasion to  visit; nor shall I attempt to enter into a minute detail on subjects  already ably delineated to"]]]
