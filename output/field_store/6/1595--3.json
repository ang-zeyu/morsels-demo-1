Again he spoke to her. \"You cannot be a person,\" he  said. \"I think you are some fearful animal, changed to look like a woman.\"    \"What is he saying now?\" asked the Snake.    \"He wants some boiling water poured on his head,\" replied the woman.    \"It shall be as he says,\" said the Snake; and he had his women heat some  water. When it was ready, one of them poured a little of it here and there  on the captive's head and shoulders. Wherever the hot water touched, the  hair came out and the skin peeled off. The pain was so bad that the Piegan  nearly fainted. When he revived, he said to his wife: \"Pity me. I have  suffered enough. Let them kill me now. Let me hurry to join those who are  already travelling to the Sand Hills.\"    The woman turned to the Snake chief, and said, \"The man says that he wants  you to give him to the Sun.\"    \"It is good,\" said the Snake. \"To-morrow we move camp. Before we leave  here, we will give him to the Sun.\"    There was an old woman in this camp who lived all alone, in a little lodge  of her own. She had some friends and relations, but she said she liked to  live by herself. She had heard that a Piegan had been captured, and went to  the lodge where he was. When she saw them pour the boiling water on him,  she cried and felt badly. This old woman had a very good heart. She went  home and lay down by her dog, and kept crying, she felt so sorry for this  poor man. Pretty soon she heard people shouting out the orders of the  chief. They said: \"Listen! listen! To-morrow we move camp. Get ready now  and pack up everything. Before we go, the Piegan man will be given to the  Sun.\"    Then the old woman knew what to do. She tied a piece of buckskin around her  dog's mouth, so he could not bark, and then she took him way out in the  timber and tied him where he could not be seen. She also filled a small  sack with pemmican, dried meat, and berries, and put it near the dog.    In the morning the people rose early. They smoothed a cotton-wood tree, by  taking off the bark, and painted it black. Then they stood the Piegan up  against it, and fastened him there with a great many ropes. When they had  tied him so he could not move, they painted his face black, and the chief  Snake made a prayer, and gave him to the Sun.    Every one was now busy getting ready to move camp. This old woman had lost  her dog, and kept calling out for him and looking all around. \"_Tsis'-i!_\"  she cried. \"_Tsis'-i!_ Come here. Knock the dog on the head![1] Wait till I  find him, and I'll break his neck.\"    [Footnote 1: A Blackfoot curse.]    The people were now all packed up, and some had already started on the  trail. \"Don't wait for me,\" the old woman said. \"Go on, I'll look again for  my dog, and catch up with you.\"    When all were gone, the old woman went and untied her dog, and then, going  up to where the Piegan was tied, she cut the ropes, and he was free. But  already the man was very weak, and he fell down on the ground. She rubbed  his limbs, and pretty soon he felt better. The old woman was so sorry for  him that she cried again, and kissed him. Then the man cried, too. He was  so glad that some one pitied him. By and by he ate some of the food the old  woman had given him, and felt strong again. He said to her in signs: \"I am  not done. I shall go back home now, but I will come again. I will bring all  the Piegans with me, and we will have revenge.\"    \"You say well,\" signed the old woman.    \"Help me,\" again said the man. \"If, on the road you are travelling, this  camp should separate, mark the trail my wife takes with a stick. You, too,  follow the party she goes with, and always put your lodge at the far end of  the village. When I return with my people, I will enter your lodge, and  tell you what to do.\"    \"I take your speech,\" replied the old woman. \"As you say, so it shall be.\"  Then she kissed him again, and started on after her people. The man went to  the river, swam across, and started for the North.      IV    Why are the people crying? Why is all this mourning? Ah! the poor man has  returned home, and told how those who went with him were killed. He has  told them the whole story. They are getting ready for war. Every one able  to fight is going with this man back to the Snakes. Only a few will be  left to guard the camp. The mother of that bad woman is going, too. She has  sharpened her axe, and told what she will do when she sees her  daughter. All are ready. The best horses have been caught up and saddled,  and the war party has started,--hundreds and hundreds of warriors. They are  strung out over the prairie as far as you can see.    When they got to the Missouri River, the poor man showed them where the  lodge in which they had tortured him had stood. He took them to see the  tree, where he had been bound. The black paint was still on it.    From here, they went slowly. Some young men were sent far ahead to  scout. The second day, they came back to the main body, and said they had  found a camping place just deserted, and that there the trail forked. The  poor man then went ahead, and at the forks he found a willow twig stuck in  the ground, pointing to the left hand trail. When the others came up, he  said to them: \"Take care of my horse now, and travel slowly. I will go  ahead on foot and find the camp. It must be close. I will go and see that  old woman, and find out how things are.\"    Some men did not want him to do this; they said that the old woman might  tell about him, and then they could not surprise the camp.    \"No,\" replied the man. \"It will not be so. That old woman is almost the  same as my mother. I know she will help us.\"    He went ahead carefully, and near sunset saw the camp. When it was dark,  he crept near it and entered the old woman's lodge. She had placed it  behind, and a little way off from, the others. When he went in the old  woman was asleep, but the fire was still burning a little. He touched her,  and she jumped up and started to scream; but he put his hand on her mouth,  and when she saw who it was she laughed and kissed him. \"The Piegans have  come,\" he told her. \"We are going to have revenge on this camp to-night. Is  my wife here?\"    \"Still here,\" replied the old woman. \"She is chief now. They think her  medicine very strong.\"    \"Tell your friends and relations,\" said the Piegan, \"that you have had a  dream, and that they must move into the brush yonder. Have them stay there  with you, and they will not be hurt. I am going now to get my people.\"    It was very late in the night. Most of the Snakes were in bed and  asleep. All at once the camp was surrounded with warriors, shouting the war  cry and shooting, stabbing, and knocking people on the head as fast as they  came out of the lodges.    That Piegan woman cried out: \"Don't hurt me. I am a Piegan. Are any of my  people here?\"    \"Many of your relations are here,\" some one said. \"They will protect you.\"    Some young men seized and tied her, as her husband had said to do. They had  hard work to keep her mother from killing her. \"_Hai yah_!\" the old woman  cried. \"There is my Snake woman daughter. Let me split her head open.\"    The fight was soon over. The Piegans killed the people almost as fast as  they came out of their lodges. Some few escaped in the darkness. When the  fight was over, the young warriors gathered up a great pile of lodge poles  and brush, and set fire to it. Then the poor man tore the dress off his bad  wife, tied the scalp of her dead Snake man around her neck, and told her to  dance the scalp dance in the fire. She cried and hung back, calling out for  pity. The people only laughed and pushed her into the fire. She would run  through it, and then those on the other side would push her back. So they  kept her running through the fire, until she fell down and died.    The old Snake woman had come out of the brush with her relations. Because  she had been so good, the Piegans gave her, and those with her, one-half of  all the horses and valuable things they had taken. \"_Kyi!_\" said the Piegan  chief. \"That is all for you, because you helped this poor man. To-morrow  morning we start back North. If your heart is that way, go too and live  with us.\" So these Snakes joined the Piegans and lived with them until they  died, and their children married with the Piegans, and at last they were no  longer Snake people.[1]    [Footnote 1: When the Hudson's Bay Company first established a fort at  Edmonton, a daughter of one of these Snakes married a white employee of the  company, named, in Blackfoot, _O-wai_, Egg.]        THE LOST CHILDREN    Once a camp of people stopped on the bank of a river. There were but a few  lodges of them. One day the little children in the camp crossed the river  to play on the other side. For some time they stayed near the bank, and  then they went up over a little hill, and found a bed of sand and gravel;  and there they played for a long time.    There were eleven of these children. Two of them were daughters of the  chief of the camp, and the smaller of these wanted the best of  everything. If any child found a pretty stone, she would try to take it for  herself. The other children did not like this, and they began to tease the  little girl, and to take her things away from her. Then she got angry and  began to cry, and the more she cried, the more the children teased her; so  at last she and her sister left the others, and went back to the camp.    When they got there, they told their father what the other children had  done to them, and this made the chief very angry. He thought for a little  while, and then got up and went out of the lodge, and called aloud, so that  everybody might hear, saying: \"Listen! listen! Your children have teased my  child and made her cry. Now we will move away, and leave them behind.

Supposing herself the possessor of a ten cent note, over and  above the twelve shillings, she went with her somewhat feeble protege  over Jersey city ferry, and saw her safely in the cars. Starting back,  she was dismayed to find no ten cents in her pocket-book, and, all too  late, remembered having paid it for a quart of milk that morning; the  sole breakfast of herself and daughter. Night was approaching--what to  do she did not know. She had a plain, worn, old gold ring on her finger;  she took it off, offered it to the ferry-master, who would not take it,  though she told him she found her money gone and would redeem it next  day. She went back in the ladies' room and told it to the Lord,  beseeching his assistance. Just then, a girl passing, jostled against  her and knocked down her parasol. She picked it up, happened to turn it  upside down, and out rolled a _five-cent nickel!_ The Lord, then, hears  prayer for even _five cents_ to provide for the comfort and need of  those whom He loves.      A PRAYER FOR FIFTY DOLLARS.      A clergyman writes _The Christian_ as follows:    \"The Winter of 1872 I spent in missionary work, carrying the glad  tidings of the kingdom of God into new fields in the 'regions beyond.'  With my devoted wife, I labored ardently for the salvation of men 'from  the wrath to come.' We were full of comfort to be thus engaged, though  without pledge from man for support, or promised salary for preaching.    \"In spite of our rigid economy, I had contracted some debts for the  necessaries of life. I have since learned to go without what the Lord  does not provide means to pay for at once. I needed the money to pay the  debts, and felt impressed to pray for fifty dollars. I said to my wife:  '_I am going to pray for fifty dollars_.' 'Well,' said she, 'I will join  you;' and we bowed before God and told Him our needs, and unitedly asked  Him for fifty dollars; so that we might not bring ourselves or the truth  we preached, into reproach, by being unable to pay debts. We were agreed  in asking, and thus claiming the promise: 'If two of you shall agree as  touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my  Father which is in heaven.' (Matt, xviii. 19). We had the assurance that  money would come; but from whence we did not know, nor care, for we knew  the 'silver and gold' are the Lord's, as well as the 'cattle upon a  thousand hills,' and he could easily cause some one to give or send us  the money.    \"We felt full of peace; for we knew it was for God's glory to answer  that prayer. No one outside of the family knew we were praying for  money. We did not go around among our friends and tell them we were  praying for fifty dollars, in hopes that they would take it upon  themselves to answer the prayer. We told none but the God whom we serve.    \"Some little time passed, and no money came, but we did not lose our  faith or assurance. One morning, at family prayer, I was led out to pray  that we might see the Lord's working in our behalf that day, and I rose  from my knees with perfect confidence that our hearts would be made to  rejoice in God that day. When I came in to my dinner I asked my wife if  any one had brought our mail from the post-office. She said, 'Yes, there  are some papers on your table.' 'What!' said I, with surprise, 'no  letters?' I saw a peculiar expression on her countenance, and I asked no  more questions, but sat down to the dinner table and turned over my  plate, and there saw a letter she had put beneath it; and as soon as I  saw the hand-writing I felt, there is money in this, though, of all  sources, this was from the one least expected. I opened the letter, and  there was a draft for _fifty dollars, 'a gift to aid in preaching the  Gospel.'_ If I ever recognized the hand of God in anything, I did in  this; and if there was ever a time of devout thanksgiving to God, and a  humbling of self before Him in my house, it was that day. Since then, it  has been easier to trust in Him than before. He has said, 'I will never  leave thee nor forsake thee.' He has also said, through his apostles,  'Be careful for nothing; but in everything, by prayer and supplication  with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God.'\"      CONCURRENT TESTIMONY OF THE VALUE OF PRAYER.      A request was published by the _Illustrated Christian Weekly,_ asking  that all who could report positive facts as direct results of prayer,  and thus, tend to show that _\"God does answer prayer,\"_ should  communicate them. Very many were communicated, regarding all trials and  troubles of the heart, and daily temporal or spiritual life. No one can  question they are authentic to the highest degree; they should silence  the skeptic, and convince the worldly of the presence of the mysterious  power and wonderful Spirit of God, which tempers the hearts and lives of  men and controls them as He wills.      A WORLDLY MAN SURRENDERS.      A clergyman says, \"I was very anxious for the building of a mission  chapel to accommodate a flourishing mission-school that had been  organized under my pastorate. Knowing that a certain physician of the  city was possessed of abundant means and had a praying Christian mother,  though he had long since given up going to church, I resolved to call  upon him. Before starting from my study I knelt down and asked God to  prosper me in my appeal. Upon going out of my parsonage the physician  was in the act of passing in his carriage. I hailed him, explained to  him my desire, and the result was not only a contribution of money as  large as the largest, but a gift of a lot for the chapel worth several  hundred dollars.\"      A SERVANT'S PRAYER FOR A GOOD HOME.      \"I was brought up religiously as a servant in a family in Connecticut,  and from twelve years of age until twenty-three, knew no other home. The  old couple died, and I lived with their children, but they were so  different that I became very unhappy and hardly knew what to do or which  way to turn. I had no relatives and knew nothing of any world save the  little one in which I had all my life moved, and I was terribly afraid  to try any other. I could only offer my constant prayer for help, and it  was answered so much beyond my highest hope, and so kind were God's  dealings with me that I was taken, almost without an effort of my own,  into a warm, loving heart, and such a happy home, and all so easily and  smoothly that to me it seems like a miracle; and never can I forget  while I live, nor cease to believe that truly 'He is the hearer and  answerer of prayer.'\"      \"BEFORE THEY CALL I WILL ANSWER.\"--A PASTOR PRAYS FOR DECISION AS TO  GOOD CHOICES.      \"The writer was once in great trouble to know what was duty. Urged by  ministers and laymen in high standing to undertake a work not exactly in  the line of the ministry, he hesitated. God's displeasure was feared,  lest in doing what was desired 'sin might lie at his door.' To refuse  the wish of good and wise men might be resisting God's call. In this  trial of conscience he sought in fasting and special prayer the guidance  of his Heavenly Father. While so doing the above promise came very  distinctly to his mind. He brought it to God as his own promise, and  pleaded, if it could be graciously done, that He would literally fulfill  it to the suppliant. In the very act of thus pleading, he heard a rap on  the door. Opening it, there stood his mother-in-law. She said, 'Two  gentlemen are in the parlor waiting for you.' I went down, and the  interview revealed the exact fulfillment both of the promise and the  prophecy. The Lord answered my prayer two days before I called on Him.  One of the two came from New York to my home in a Western city to  inquire about _the very thing which was troubling me. He was to me an  entire stranger_, never having heard of him until I saw him. Having  consulted his friend, the Rev. M.W. Jacobus, D.D., they together came to  call on me about the matter at the very moment I was pleading with God  that He would mercifully, 'while yet speaking, hear me.' Now could  Tyndall and his followers desire a more literal, a more exact  fulfillment of this prophecy and promise as proof of its inspiration,  and of prayer as God's ordinance than that prayer for such fulfillment  of these words actually before the prayer was made, and while the  petitioner was 'yet speaking?'\"    It will be noticed that the best judgment of good men advise one course,  but trust in God for superior wisdom brought the case to answer in a  totally different manner, by means of an unknown person, a total  stranger, who neither knew him nor his desire. The circumstance should  convince the world.      A FAMILY PRAY FOR A GOOD SERVANT.      \"About three years since my family comfort was very much disturbed by  failure to obtain a good housemaid. And, having been accustomed to wait  upon God for right direction in my _temporal_ as well as spiritual  affairs, in simple faith I asked Him to direct me on reaching New York  City to where I would find a girl of good character that would  appreciate a Christian home. My steps were led to a boarding-house on  Greenwich street, and on inquiring for a German or Swede girl I was told  they had a nice Swede just landed. I talked to her through an  interpreter and was satisfied from what she said, as well as from her  countenance, that she was the one I was searching for. She came to my  home and proved, in two years' service, almost faultless. In  conversation one day, a short time after she came to our home, she said  she had had several places offered her that morning before I came, but  she did not like them; but as soon as she saw me, felt that she could go  with me--she was a Christian, member of the Lutheran church and wanted a  Christian home. Her desire was granted and"]]]
