With half-closed eyes I  watch the huge cloud shadows in their noiseless play upon the high  bluffs opposite me, while into my ear ripple the sweet, soft cadences of  the river's song. Folded hands lie in my lap, for the time forgot. My  heart and I lie small upon the earth like a grain of throbbing sand.  Drifting clouds and tinkling waters, together with the warmth of a  genial summer day, bespeak with eloquence the loving Mystery round about  us. During the idle while I sat upon the sunny river brink, I grew  somewhat, though my response be not so clearly manifest as in the green  grass fringing the edge of the high bluff back of me.    At length retracing the uncertain footpath scaling the precipitous  embankment, I seek the level lands where grow the wild prairie flowers.  And they, the lovely little folk, soothe my soul with their perfumed  breath.    Their quaint round faces of varied hue convince the heart which leaps  with glad surprise that they, too, are living symbols of omnipotent  thought. With a child's eager eye I drink in the myriad star shapes  wrought in luxuriant color upon the green. Beautiful is the spiritual  essence they embody.    I leave them nodding in the breeze, but take along with me their impress  upon my heart. I pause to rest me upon a rock embedded on the side of a  foothill facing the low river bottom. Here the Stone-Boy, of whom the  American aborigine tells, frolics about, shooting his baby arrows and  shouting aloud with glee at the tiny shafts of lightning that flash from  the flying arrow-beaks. What an ideal warrior he became, baffling the  siege of the pests of all the land till he triumphed over their united  attack. And here he lay--Inyan our great-great-grandfather, older than  the hill he rested on, older than the race of men who love to tell of  his wonderful career.    Interwoven with the thread of this Indian legend of the rock, I fain  would trace a subtle knowledge of the native folk which enabled them to  recognize a kinship to any and all parts of this vast universe. By the  leading of an ancient trail I move toward the Indian village.    With the strong, happy sense that both great and small are so surely  enfolded in His magnitude that, without a miss, each has his allotted  individual ground of opportunities, I am buoyant with good nature.    Yellow Breast, swaying upon the slender stem of a wild sunflower,  warbles a sweet assurance of this as I pass near by. Breaking off the  clear crystal song, he turns his wee head from side to side eyeing me  wisely as slowly I plod with moccasined feet. Then again he yields  himself to his song of joy. Flit, flit hither and yon, he fills the  summer sky with his swift, sweet melody. And truly does it seem his  vigorous freedom lies more in his little spirit than in his wing.    With these thoughts I reach the log cabin whither I am strongly drawn by  the tie of a child to an aged mother. Out bounds my four-footed friend  to meet me, frisking about my path with unmistakable delight. Chaen is a  black shaggy dog, \"a thoroughbred little mongrel\" of whom I am very  fond. Chaen seems to understand many words in Sioux, and will go to her  mat even when I whisper the word, though generally I think she is guided  by the tone of the voice. Often she tries to imitate the sliding  inflection and long-drawn-out voice to the amusement of our guests, but  her articulation is quite beyond my ear. In both my hands I hold her  shaggy head and gaze into her large brown eyes. At once the dilated  pupils contract into tiny black dots, as if the roguish spirit within  would evade my questioning.    Finally resuming the chair at my desk I feel in keen sympathy with my  fellow-creatures, for I seem to see clearly again that all are akin. The  racial lines, which once were bitterly real, now serve nothing more than  marking out a living mosaic of human beings. And even here men of the  same color are like the ivory keys of one instrument where each  resembles all the rest, yet varies from them in pitch and quality of  voice. And those creatures who are for a time mere echoes of another's  note are not unlike the fable of the thin sick man whose distorted  shadow, dressed like a real creature, came to the old master to make him  follow as a shadow. Thus with a compassion for all echoes in human  guise, I greet the solemn-faced \"native preacher\" whom I find awaiting  me. I listen with respect for God's creature, though he mouth most  strangely the jangling phrases of a bigoted creed.    As our tribe is one large family, where every person is related to all  the others, he addressed me:--    \"Cousin, I came from the morning church service to talk with you.\"    \"Yes?\" I said interrogatively, as he paused for some word from me.    Shifting uneasily about in the straight-backed chair he sat upon, he  began: \"Every holy day (Sunday) I look about our little God's house, and  not seeing you there, I am disappointed. This is why I come today.  Cousin, as I watch you from afar, I see no unbecoming behavior and hear  only good reports of you, which all the more burns me with the wish that  you were a church member. Cousin, I was taught long years ago by kind  missionaries to read the holy book. These godly men taught me also the  folly of our old beliefs.    \"There is one God who gives reward or punishment to the race of dead  men. In the upper region the Christian dead are gathered in unceasing  song and prayer. In the deep pit below, the sinful ones dance in  torturing flames.    \"Think upon these things, my cousin, and choose now to avoid the  after-doom of hell fire!\" Then followed a long silence in which he  clasped tighter and unclasped again his interlocked fingers.    Like instantaneous lightning flashes came pictures of my own mother's  making, for she, too, is now a follower of the new superstition.    \"Knocking out the chinking of our log cabin, some evil hand thrust in a  burning taper of braided dry grass, but failed of his intent, for the  fire died out and the half-burned brand fell inward to the floor.  Directly above it, on a shelf, lay the holy book. This is what we found  after our return from a several days' visit. Surely some great power is  hid in the sacred book!\"    Brushing away from my eyes many like pictures, I offered midday meal to  the converted Indian sitting wordless and with downcast face. No sooner  had he risen from the table with \"Cousin, I have relished it,\" than the  church bell rang.    Thither he hurried forth with his afternoon sermon. I watched him as he  hastened along, his eyes bent fast upon the dusty road till he  disappeared at the end of a quarter of a mile.    The little incident recalled to mind the copy of a missionary paper  brought to my notice a few days ago, in which a \"Christian\" pugilist  commented upon a recent article of mine, grossly perverting the spirit  of my pen. Still I would not forget that the pale-faced missionary and  the hoodooed aborigine are both God's creatures, though small indeed  their own conceptions of Infinite Love. A wee child toddling in a wonder  world, I prefer to their dogma my excursions into the natural gardens  where the voice of the Great Spirit is heard in the twittering of birds,  the rippling of mighty waters, and the sweet breathing of flowers.    Here, in a fleeting quiet, I am awakened by the fluttering robe of the  Great Spirit. To my innermost consciousness the phenomenal universe is a  royal mantle, vibrating with His divine breath. Caught in its flowing  fringes are the spangles and oscillating brilliants of sun, moon, and  stars.          THE SOFT-HEARTED SIOUX    I.      Beside the open fire I sat within our tepee. With my red blanket wrapped  tightly about my crossed legs, I was thinking of the coming season, my  sixteenth winter. On either side of the wigwam were my parents. My  father was whistling a tune between his teeth while polishing with his  bare hand a red stone pipe he had recently carved. Almost in front of  me, beyond the center fire, my old grandmother sat near the entranceway.    She turned her face toward her right and addressed most of her words to  my mother. Now and then she spoke to me, but never did she allow her  eyes to rest upon her daughter's husband, my father. It was only upon  rare occasions that my grandmother said anything to him. Thus his ears  were open and ready to catch the smallest wish she might express.  Sometimes when my grandmother had been saying things which pleased him,  my father used to comment upon them. At other times, when he could not  approve of what was spoken, he used to work or smoke silently.    On this night my old grandmother began her talk about me. Filling the  bowl of her red stone pipe with dry willow bark, she looked across at  me.    \"My grandchild, you are tall and are no longer a little boy.\" Narrowing  her old eyes, she asked, \"My grandchild, when are you going to bring  here a handsome young woman?\" I stared into the fire rather than meet  her gaze. Waiting for my answer, she stooped forward and through the  long stem drew a flame into the red stone pipe.    I smiled while my eyes were still fixed upon the bright fire, but I said  nothing in reply. Turning to my mother, she offered her the pipe. I  glanced at my grandmother. The loose buckskin sleeve fell off at her  elbow and showed a wrist covered with silver bracelets. Holding up the  fingers of her left hand, she named off the desirable young women of our  village.    \"Which one, my grandchild, which one?\" she questioned.    \"Hoh!\" I said, pulling at my blanket in confusion. \"Not yet!\" Here my  mother passed the pipe over the fire to my father. Then she, too, began  speaking of what I should do.    \"My son, be always active. Do not dislike a long hunt. Learn to provide  much buffalo meat and many buckskins before you bring home a wife.\"  Presently my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10380"],[0,"Bible Stories and Religious Classics (#10)"],[1,"s, and  servants both men and women, camels and asses.    After that Jacob had heard Laban's sons say: Jacob hath taken all that  was our father's from him, and of his faculty is made rich, he was  abashed and understood well by Laban's looking that he was not so  friendly to himward as he had been tofore. And also our Lord said to him  that he should return into the land of his fathers and to his  generation, and that he would be with him. He then called Rachel and  Leah into the field whereas he fed his flocks, and said to them: I see  well by your father's visage that he is not toward me as he was  yesterday or that other day; forsooth the God of my father was with me,  and ye know well how I have served your father with all my might and  strength, but he hath deceived me, and hath changed mine hire and meed  ten times, and yet our Lord hath not suffered him to grieve me. When he  said the beasts of party color should be mine, then all the ewes brought  forth lambs of variable colors. And when he said the contrary they  brought forth all white. God hath taken the substance of your father and  hath given it to me. And now God hath commanded me to depart, wherefore  make you ready and let us depart hence. Then answered Rachel and Leah:  Shall we have nothing else of our father's faculty and of the heritage  of his house? Shall he repute us as strangers, and he hath eaten and  sold our goods? Sith God hath taken the goods of our father and hath  given it to us and to our children, wherefore all that God commanded to  thee, do it.    Jacob arose and set his children and his wives upon his camels, and went  his way and took all his substance, and flocks, and all that he had  gotten in Mesopotamia and went toward his father Isaac into the land of  Canaan. That time was Laban gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole  away the idols of her father. Jacob would not let Laban know of his  departing, and when he was departed with all that longed to him of  right, he came to the mount of Gilead. It was told to Laban, the third  day after, that Jacob was fled and gone, who anon took his brethren and  pursued him by the space of seven days and overtook him in the mount of  Gilead. He saw our Lord in his sleep saying to him: Beware that thou  speak not angrily ne hard words to Jacob. That time Jacob had set his  tabernacle in the hill, and when he came thither with his brethren, he  said to Jacob: Why hast thou done thus to me to take away my daughters  as prisoners taken by sword? Why fleddest thou from me and wouldst not  let me have knowledge thereof? Thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons  and daughters, thou hast done follily. Now may I do thee harm and evil,  but the God of thy father said to me yesterday: Beware that thou speak  no hard words against Jacob. Thou desirest to go to the house of thy  father, why hast thou stolen my gods? Jacob answered: That I departed  thee not knowing, I dreaded that violently thou wouldst have taken from  me thy daughters. And where thou reprovest me of theft, whosoever have  stolen thy gods let him be slain tofore our brethren. Seek and what thou  findest that is thine, take with thee.    He, saying this, knew not that Rachel had stolen her father's gods. Then  Laban entered the tabernacle of Jacob and Leah, and sought and found  nothing. And when he came into the tabernacle of Rachel, she hied her  and hid the idols under the litter of her camel and sat upon it. And he  sought and found nought. Then said Rachel: Let not my lord be wroth for  I may not arise to thee, for sickness is fallen to me, and so she  deceived her father. Then Jacob, being angry and grudging, said to  Laban: What is my trespass and what have I sinned to thee that thou hast  pursued me, and hast searched everything? What hast thou now founden of  all the substance of thy house? Lay it forth tofore my brethren and thy  brethren, that they judge between me and thee. I have served thee twenty  years and have been with thee, thy sheep and thy goats were never  barren. I have eaten no wethers of thy flock, nor beast hath destroyed  none. I shall make all good what was stolen. I prayed therefore day and  night, I labored both in heat and in cold, sleep fled from mine eyes.  Thus I served thee in thy house twenty years, fourteen for thy daughters  and six for thy flocks. Thou hast changed mine hire and reward ten  times. But if the God of my father Abraham and the dread of Isaac had  been with me, haply thou wouldst now have left me naked. Our Lord God  hath beholden mine affliction and the labor of mine hands and reproved  thee yesterday. Laban answered to him: My daughters and sons, and thy  flocks, and all that thou beholdest are thine, what may I do to my sons  and nephews? Let us now be friends, and make we a fast league and  confederacy together. Then Jacob raised a stone, and raised it in token  of friendship and peace, and so they ate together in friendship, and  sware each to other to abide in love ever after. And after this Laban  arose in the night, and kissed his daughters and sons, and blessed them,  and returned into his country.    Jacob went forth in his journey that he had taken. Angels of God met  him, which when he saw, he said: These be the castles of God, and called  that place Mahanaim. He sent messengers tofore him to Esau his brother  in the land of Seir, in the land of Edom, and bade them say thus to  Esau: This saith thy brother Jacob: I have dwelled with Laban unto this  day, I have oxen and asses, servants both men and women. I send now a  legation unto my lord that I may find grace in his sight. These  messengers returned to Jacob and said: We came to Esau thy brother, and  lo! he cometh for to meet thee with four hundred men. Jacob was sore  afraid then, and divided his company into twain turmes [two troops],  saying: If Esau come to that one and destroy that, that other shall yet  be saved. Then said Jacob: O God of my father Abraham, and God of my  father Isaac, O Lord that saidst to me, return into thy land and place  of thy nativity, and saidst I shall do well to thee, I am the least in  all thy mercies, and in thy truth that thou hast granted to thy servant,  with my staff I have gone this river of Jordan, and now I return with  two turmes. I beseech the Lord keep me from the hands of my brother  Esau, for I fear him greatly lest he come and smite down the mother with  the sons. Thou hast said that thou shouldest do well to me and shouldest  spread my seed like unto the gravel of the sea, and that it may not be  numbered for multitude. Then when he had slept that night, he ordained  gifts for to send to his brother, goats two hundred, kids twenty, sheep  two hundred, and rams twenty; forty kine and twenty bulls, twenty asses  and ten foals of them. And he sent by his servants all these beasts; and  bade them say that Jacob his servant sent to him this present and that  he followeth after. And Jacob thought to please him with gifts.    The night following, him thought a man wrestled with him all that night  till the morning, and when he saw he might not overcome him, he hurted  the sinew of his thigh that he halted thereof, and said to him: Let me  go and leave me, for it is in the morning. Then Jacob answered: I shall  not leave thee but if thou bless me. He said to him: What is thy name?  he answered: Jacob. Then he said: Nay, said he, thy name shall no more  be called Jacob, but Israel, for if thou hast been strong against God,  how much more shalt thou prevail against men? Then Jacob said to him:  What is thy name? tell me. He answered, Why demandest thou my name,  which is marvellous? And he blessed him in the same place. Jacob called  the name of that same place Penuel, saying: I have seen our Lord face to  face, and my soul is made safe. And anon as he was past Penuel the sun  arose. He halted on his foot, and therefore the children of Israel eat  no sinews because it dried in the thigh of Jacob. Then Jacob lifting up  his eyes saw Esau coming and four hundred men with him, and divided the  sons of Leah and of Rachel, and of both their handmaidens, and set each  handmaid and their children tofore in the first place, Leah and her sons  in the second, and Rachel and Joseph all behind. And he going tofore  kneeled down to ground and, worshipping his brother, approached him.  Esau ran for to meet with his brother, and embraced him, straining his  neck, and weeping kissed him, and he looked forth and saw the women and  their children, and said: What been these and to whom longen they? Jacob  answered: They be children which God hath given to me thy servant and  his handmaidens, and their children approached and kneeled down, and  Leah with her children also worshipped him, and last of all Joseph and  Rachel worshipped him. Then said Esau: Whose been these turmes [troops]  which I have met? Jacob answered: I have sent them to thee, my lord,  unto the end that I may stand in thy grace. Esau said: I have many  myself, keep these and let them be thine. Nay, said Jacob, I pray thee  to take this gift which God hath sent me that I may find grace in thy  sight, for meseemeth I see thy visage like the visage of God; and  therefore be thou to me merciful, and take this blessing of me. Unnethe  [hardly] by compelling he taking it, said: Let us go together, I shall  accompany thee and be fellow of thy journey. Then said Jacob: Thou  knowest well, my lord, that I have young children and tender, and sheep  and oxen, which, if I over-labored, should die all in a day, wherefore  please it you, my lord, to go tofore, and I shall follow as I may with  my children and beasts. Esau answered: I pray thee then let my fellows  abide and accompany thee, whatsoever need thou have. Jacob said: It is  no need, I need no more but one, that I may stand in thy favor, my lord.  And Esau returned then the same way and journey that he came into Seir.  And Jacob came to Succoth and builded there an house,"]]]
