Apologia          Mr. Justice Raffles          CHAPTER I    An Inaugural Banquet      Raffles had vanished from the face of the town, and even I had no  conception of his whereabouts until he cabled to me to meet the 7.31 at  Charing Cross next night. That was on the Tuesday before the 'Varsity  match, or a full fortnight after his mysterious disappearance. The  telegram was from Carlsbad, of all places for Raffles of all men! Of  course there was only one thing that could possibly have taken so rare a  specimen of physical fitness to any such pernicious spot. But to my  horror he emerged from the train, on the Wednesday evening, a cadaverous  caricature of the splendid person I had gone to meet.    \"Not a word, my dear Bunny, till I have bitten British beef!\" said he,  in tones as hollow as his cheeks. \"No, I'm not going to stop to clear  my baggage now. You can do that for me to-morrow, Bunny, like a dear  good pal.\"    \"Any time you like,\" said I, giving him my arm. \"But where shall we dine?  Kellner's? Neapolo's? The Carlton or the Club?\"    But Raffles shook his head at one and all.    \"I don't want to dine at all,\" he said. \"I know what I want!\"    And he led the way from the station, stopping once to gloat over the  sunset across Trafalgar Square, and again to inhale the tarry scent of  the warm wood-paving, which was perfume to his nostrils as the din of its  traffic was music to his ears, before we came to one of those political  palaces which permit themselves to be included in the list of ordinary  clubs. Raffles, to my surprise, walked in as though the marble hall  belonged to him, and as straight as might be to the grill-room where  white-capped cooks were making things hiss upon a silver grill. He did  not consult me as to what we were to have. He had made up his mind about  that in the train. But he chose the fillet steaks himself, he insisted on  seeing the kidneys, and had a word to say about the fried potatoes, and  the Welsh rarebit that was to follow. And all this was as  uncharacteristic of the normal Raffles (who was least fastidious at the  table) as the sigh with which he dropped into the chair opposite mine,  and crossed his arms upon the cloth.    \"I didn't know you were a member of this place,\" said I, feeling really  rather shocked at the discovery, but also that it was a safer subject for  me to open than that of his late mysterious movements.    \"There are a good many things you don't know about me, Bunny,\" said he  wearily. \"Did you know I was in Carlsbad, for instance?\"    \"Of course I didn't.\"    \"Yet you remember the last time we sat down together?\"    \"You mean that night we had supper at the Savoy?\"    \"It's only three weeks ago, Bunny.\"    \"It seems months to me.\"    \"And years to me!\" cried Raffles. \"But surely you remember that lost  tribesman at the next table, with the nose like the village pump, and the  wife with the emerald necklace?\"    \"I should think I did,\" said I; \"you mean the great Dan Levy, otherwise  Mr. Shylock? Why, you told me all about him, A. J.\"    \"Did I? Then you may possibly recollect that the Shylocks were off to  Carlsbad the very next day. It was the old man's last orgy before his  annual cure, and he let the whole room know it. Ah, Bunny, I can  sympathise with the poor brute now!\"    \"But what on earth took you there, old fellow?\"    \"Can you ask? Have you forgotten how you saw the emeralds under their  table when they'd gone, and how _I_ forgot myself and ran after them with  the best necklace I'd handled since the days of Lady Melrose?\"    I shook my head, partly in answer to his question, but partly also over a  piece of perversity which still rankled in my recollection. But now I was  prepared for something even more perverse.    \"You were quite right,\" continued Raffles, recalling my recriminations at  the time; \"it was a rotten thing to do. It was also the action of a  tactless idiot, since anybody could have seen that a heavy necklace like  that couldn't have dropped off without the wearer's knowledge.\"    \"You don't mean to say she dropped it on purpose?\" I exclaimed with more  interest, for I suddenly foresaw the remainder of his tale.    \"I do,\" said Raffles. \"The poor old pet did it deliberately when stooping  to pick up something else; and all to get it stolen and delay their trip  to Carlsbad, where her swab of a husband makes her do the cure with him.\"    I said I always felt that we had failed to fulfil an obvious destiny in  the matter of those emeralds; and there was something touching in the way  Raffles now sided with me against himself.    \"But I saw it the moment I had yanked them up,\" said he, \"and heard that  fat swine curse his wife for dropping them. He told her she'd done it on  purpose, too; he hit the nail on the head all right; but it was her poor  head, and that showed me my unworthy impulse in its true light, Bunny. I  didn't need your reproaches to make me realise what a skunk I'd been all  round. I saw that the necklace was morally yours, and there was one clear  call for me to restore it to you by hook, crook, or barrel. I left for  Carlsbad as soon after its wrongful owners as prudence permitted.\"    \"Admirable!\" said I, overjoyed to find old Raffles by no means in such  bad form as he looked. \"But not to have taken me with you, A. J., that's  the unkind cut I can't forgive.\"    \"My dear Bunny, you couldn't have borne it,\" said Raffles solemnly. \"The  cure would have killed you; look what it's done to me.\"    \"Don't tell me you went through with it!\" I rallied him.    \"Of course I did, Bunny. I played the game like a prayer-book.\"    \"But why, in the name of all that's wanton?\"    \"You don't know Carlsbad, or you wouldn't ask. The place is squirming  with spies and humbugs. If I had broken the rules one of the prize  humbugs laid down for me I should have been spotted in a tick by a spy,  and bowled out myself for a spy and a humbug rolled into one. Oh, Bunny,  if old man Dante were alive to-day I should commend him to that sink of  salubrity for the redraw material of another and a worse Inferno!\"    The steaks had arrived, smoking hot, with a kidney apiece and lashings of  fried potatoes. And for a divine interval (as it must have been to him)  Raffles's only words were to the waiter, and referred to successive  tankards of bitter, with the superfluous rider that the man who said we  couldn't drink beer was a liar. But indeed I never could myself, and only  achieved the impossible in this case out of sheer sympathy with Raffles.  And eventually I had my reward, in such a recital of malignant privation  as I cannot trust myself to set down in any words but his.    \"No, Bunny, you couldn't have borne it for half a week; you'd have looked  like that all the time!\" quoth Raffles. I suppose my face had fallen (as  it does too easily) at his aspersion on my endurance. \"Cheer up, my man;  that's better,\" he went on, as I did my best. \"But it was no smiling  matter out there. No one does smile after the first week; your sense of  humour is the first thing the cure eradicates. There was a hunting man at  my hotel, getting his weight down to ride a special thoroughbred, and no  doubt a cheery dog at home; but, poor devil, he hadn't much chance of  good cheer there! Miles and miles on his poor feet before breakfast;  mud-poultices all the morning; and not the semblance of a drink all day,  except some aerated muck called Gieshuebler. He was allowed to lap that up  an hour after meals, when his tongue would be hanging out of his mouth.  We went to the same weighing machine at cock-crow, and though he looked  quite good-natured once when I caught him asleep in his chair, I have  known him tear up his weight ticket when he had gained an ounce or two  instead of losing one or two pounds. We began by taking our walks  together, but his conversation used to get so physically introspective  that one couldn't get in a word about one's own works edgeways.\"    \"But there was nothing wrong with your works,\" I reminded Raffles; he  shook his head as one who was not so sure.    \"Perhaps not at first, but the cure soon sees to that! I closed in like a  concertina, Bunny, and I only hope I shall be able to pull out like one.  You see, it's the custom of the accursed place for one to telephone for  a doctor the moment one arrives. I consulted the hunting man, who of  course recommended his own in order to make sure of a companion on the  rack. The old arch-humbug was down upon me in ten minutes, examining me  from crown to heel, and made the most unblushing report upon my general  condition. He said I had a liver! I'll swear I hadn't before I went to  Carlsbad, but I shouldn't be a bit surprised if I'd brought one back.\"    And he tipped his tankard with a solemn face, before falling to work upon  the Welsh rarebit which had just arrived.    \"It looks like gold, and it's golden eating,\" said poor old Raffles. \"I  only wish that sly dog of a doctor could see me at it! He had the nerve  to make me write out my own health-warrant, and it was so like my friend  the hunting man's that it dispelled his settled gloom for the whole of  that evening.

There was an Old Man with a beard,                 Who said, \"It is just as I feared!--                 Two Owls and a Hen,                 Four Larks and a Wren,                 Have all built their nests in my beard!\"          2.                   There was a Young Lady of Ryde,                 Whose shoe-strings were seldom untied;                 She purchased some clogs,                 And some small spotty dogs,                 And frequently walked about Ryde.          3.                   There was an Old Man with a nose,                 Who said, \"If you choose to suppose,                 That my nose is too long,                 You are certainly wrong!\"                 That remarkable Man with a nose.          4.                   There was an Old Man on a hill,                 Who seldom, if ever, stood still;                 He ran up and down,                 In his Grandmother's gown,                 Which adorned that Old Man on a hill.          5.                   There was a Young Lady whose bonnet,                 Came untied when the birds sate upon it;                 But she said, \"I don't care!                 All the birds in the air                 Are welcome to sit on my bonnet!\"          6.                   There was a Young Person of Smyrna,                 Whose Grandmother threatened to burn her;                 But she seized on the Cat,                 And said, \"Granny, burn that!                 \"You incongruous Old Woman of Smyrna!\"          7.                   There was an Old Person of Chili,                 Whose conduct was painful and silly;                 He sate on the stairs,                 Eating apples and pears,                 That imprudent Old Person of Chili.          8.                   There was an Old Man with a gong,                 Who bumped at it all the day long;                 But they called out, \"O law!                 You're a horrid old bore!\"                 So they smashed that Old Man with a gong.          9.                   There was an Old Lady of Chertsey,                 Who made a remarkable curtsey;                 She twirled round and round,                 Till she sunk underground,                 Which distressed all the people of Chertsey.          10.                   There was an Old Man in a tree,                 Who was horribly bored by a Bee;                 When they said, \"Does it buzz?\"                 He replied, \"Yes, it does!                 \"It's a regular brute of a Bee!\"          11.                   There was an Old Man with a flute,                 A sarpint ran into his boot;                 But he played day and night,                 Till the sarpint took flight,                 And avoided that man with a flute.          12.                   There was a Young Lady whose chin,                 Resembled the point of a pin:                 So she had it made sharp,                 And purchased a harp,                 And played several tunes with her chin.          13.                   There was an Old Man of Kilkenny,                 Who never had more than a penny;                 He spent all that money,                 In onions and honey,                 That wayward Old Man of Kilkenny.          14.                   There was an Old Person of Ischia,                 Whose conduct grew friskier and friskier;                 He danced hornpipes and jigs,                 And ate thousands of figs,                 That lively Old Person of Ischia.          15.                   There was an Old Man in a boat,                 Who said, \"I'm afloat! I'm afloat!\"                 When they said, \"No! you ain't!\"                 He was ready to faint,                 That unhappy Old Man in a boat.          16.                   There was a Young lady of Portugal,                 Whose ideas were excessively nautical;                 She climbed up a tree,                 To examine the sea,                 But declared she would never leave Portugal.          17.                   There was an Old Man of Moldavia,                 Who had the most curious behaviour;                 For while he was able,                 He slept on a table,                 That funny Old Man of Moldavia          18.                   There was an Old Man of Madras,                 Who rode on a cream-coloured ass;                 But the length of its ears,                 So promoted his fears,                 That it killed that Old Man of Madras.          19.                   There was an Old Person of Leeds,                 Whose head was infested with beads;                 She sat on a stool,                 And ate gooseberry fool,                 Which agreed with that person of Leeds.          20.                   There was an Old Man of Peru,                 Who never knew what he should do;                 So he tore off his hair,                 And behaved like a bear,                 That intrinsic Old Man of Peru.          21.                   There was an Old Person of Hurst,                 Who drank when he was not athirst;                 When they said, \"You'll grow fatter,\"                 He answered, \"What matter?\"                 That globular Person of Hurst.          22.                   There was a Young person of Crete,                 Whose toilette was far from complete;                 She dressed in a sack,                 Spickle-speckled with black,                 That ombliferous person of Crete.          23.                   There was an Old Man of the Isles,                 Whose face was pervaded with smiles;                 He sung high dum diddle,                 And played on the fiddle,                 That amiable Man of the Isles.          24.                   There was an Old Person of Buda,                 Whose conduct grew ruder and ruder;                 Till at last, with a hammer,                 They silenced his clamour,                 By smashing that Person of Buda          25.                   There was an Old Man of Columbia,                 Who was thirsty, and called out for some beer;                 But they brought it quite hot,                 In a small copper pot,                 Which disgusted that man of Columbia.          26.                   There was a young Lady of Dorking,                 Who bought a large bonnet for walking;                 But its colour and size,                 So bedazzled her eyes,                 That she very soon went back to Dorking.          27.                   There was an Old Man who supposed,                 That the street door was partially closed;                 But some very large rats,                 Ate his coats and his hats,                 While that futile old gentleman dozed.          28.                   There was an Old Man of the West,                 Who wore a pale plum-coloured vest;                 When they said, \"Does it fit?\"                 He replied, \"Not a bit!\"                 That uneasy Old Man of the West.          29.                   There was an Old Man of the Wrekin,                 Whose shoes made a horrible creaking;                 But they said, \"Tell us whether,                 Your shoes are of leather,                 Or of what, you Old Man of the Wrekin?\"          30.                   There was a Young Lady whose eyes,                 Were unique as to colour and size;                 When she opened them wide,                 People all turned aside,                 And started away in surprise.          31.                   There was a Young Lady of Norway,                 Who casually sat in a doorway;                 When the door squeezed her flat,                 She exclaimed, \"What of that?\"                 This courageous Young Lady of Norway.          32.                   There was an Old Man of Vienna,                 Who lived upon Tincture of Senna;                 When that did not agree,                 He took Camomile Tea,                 That nasty Old Man of Vienna.          33.                   There was an Old Person whose habits,                 Induced him to feed upon Rabbits;                 When he'd eaten eighteen,                 He turned perfectly green,                 Upon which he relinquished those habits.          34.                   There was an old person of Dover,                 Who rushed through a field of blue Clover;                 But some very large bees,                 Stung his nose and his knees,                 So he very soon went back to Dover.          35.
