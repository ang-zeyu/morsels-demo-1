It must have food for its digestion, air for its breathing, and vitality  for its absorption. This vitality is essentially a force, but when clothed  in matter it appears to us as a definite element, which exists in all the  worlds of which we have spoken. At the moment we are concerned with that  manifestation of it which we find in the highest subdivision of the  physical world. Just as the blood circulates through the veins, so does the  vitality circulate along the nerves; and precisely as any abnormality in  the flow of the blood at once affects the physical body, so does the  slightest irregularity in the absorption or flow of the vitality affect  this higher part of the physical body.    Vitality is a force which comes originally from the sun. When an ultimate  physical atom is charged with it, it draws round itself six other atoms,  and makes itself into an etheric element. The original force of vitality is  then subdivided into seven, each of the atoms carrying a separate charge.  The element thus made is absorbed into the human body through the etheric  part of the spleen. It is there split up into its component parts, which at  once low to the various parts of the body assigned to them. The spleen is  one of the seven force centres in the etheric part of the physical body. In  each of our vehicles seven such centres should be in activity, and when  they are thus active they are visible to clairvoyant sight. They appear  usually as shallow vortices, for they are the points at which the force  from the higher bodies enters the lower. In the physical body these centres  are: (1) at the base of the spine, (2) at the solar plexus, (3) at the  spleen, (4) over the heart, (5) at the throat, (6) between the eyebrows,  and (7) at the top of the head. There are other dormant centres, but their  awakening is undesirable.    The shape of all the higher bodies as seen by the clairvoyant is ovoid, but  the matter composing them is not equally distributed throughout the egg. In  the midst of this ovoid is the physical body. The physical body strongly  attracts astral matter, and in its turn the astral matter strongly attracts  mental matter. Therefore by far the greater part of the matter of the  astral body is gathered within the physical frame; and the same is true of  the mental vehicle. If we see the astral body of a man in its own world,  apart from the physical body we shall still perceive the astral matter  aggregated in exactly the shape of the physical, although, as the matter is  more fluidic in its nature, what we see is a body built of dense mist, in  the midst of an ovoid of much finer mist. The same is true for the mental  body. Therefore, if in the astral or the mental world we should meet an  acquaintance, we should recognise him by his appearance just as instantly  as in the physical world.    This, then, is the true constitution of man. In the first place he is a  Monad, a Spark of the Divine. Of that Monad the ego is a partial  expression, formed in order that he may enter evolution, and may return to  the Monad with joy, bringing his sheaves with him in the shape of qualities  developed by garnered experience. The ego in his turn puts down part of  himself for the same purpose into lower worlds, and we call that part a  personality, because the Latin word _persona_ means a mask, and this  personality is the mask which the ego puts upon himself when he manifests  in worlds lower than his own. Just as the ego is a small part and an  imperfect expression of the Monad, so is the personality a small part and  an imperfect expression of the ego; so that what we usually think of as the  man is only in truth a fragment of a fragment.    The personality wears three bodies or vehicles, the mental, the astral and  the physical. While the man is what we call alive and awake on the physical  earth he is limited by his physical body, for he uses the astral and mental  bodies only as bridges to connect himself with his lowest vehicle. One of  the limitations of the physical body is that it quickly becomes fatigued  and needs periodical rest. Each night the man leaves it to sleep, and  withdraws into his astral vehicle, which does not become fatigued, and  therefore needs no sleep. During this sleep of the physical body the man is  free to move about in the astral world; but the extent to which he does  this depends upon his development. The primitive savage usually does not  move more than a few miles away from his sleeping physical form--often not  as much as that; and he has only the vaguest consciousness.    The educated man is generally able to travel in his astral vehicle wherever  he will, and has much more consciousness in the astral world, though he has  not often the faculty of bringing into his waking life any memory of what  he has seen and done while his physical body was asleep. Sometimes he does  remember some incident which he has seen, some experience which he has had,  and then he calls it a vivid dream. More often his recollections are  hopelessly entangled with vague memories of waking life, and with  impressions made from without upon the etheric part of his brain. Thus we  arrive at the confused and often absurd dreams of ordinary life. The  developed man becomes as fully conscious and active in the astral world as  in the physical, and brings through into the latter full remembrance of  what he has been doing in the former--that is, he has a continuous life  without any loss of consciousness throughout the whole twenty-four hours,  and thus throughout the whole of his physical life, and even through death  itself.          Chapter VI    AFTER DEATH      Death is the laying aside of the physical body; but it makes no more  difference to the ego than does the laying aside of an overcoat to the  physical man. Having put off his physical body, the ego continues to live  in his astral body until the force has become exhausted which has been  generated by such emotions and passions as he has allowed himself to feel  during earth-life. When that has happened, the second death takes place;  the astral body also falls away from him, and he finds himself living in  the mental body and in the lower mental world. In that condition he remains  until the thought-forces generated during his physical and astral lives  have worn themselves out; then he drops the third vehicle in its turn and  remains once more an ego in his own world, inhabiting his causal body.    There is, then, no such thing as death as it is ordinarily understood.  There is only a succession of stages in a continuous life--stages lived in  the three worlds one after another. The apportionment of time between these  three worlds varies much as man advances. The primitive man lives almost  exclusively in the physical world, spending only a few years in the astral  at the end of each of his physical lives. As he develops, the astral life  becomes longer, and as intellect: unfolds in him, and he becomes able to  think, he begins to spend a little time in the mental world as well. The  ordinary man of civilized races remains longer in the mental world than in  the physical and astral; indeed, the more a man evolves the longer becomes  his mental, life and the shorter his life in the astral world.    The astral life is the result of all feelings which have in them the  element of self. If they have been directly selfish, they bring him into  conditions of great unpleasantness in the astral world; if, though tinged  with thoughts of self, they have been good and kindly, they bring him a  comparatively pleasant though still limited astral life. Such of his  thoughts and feelings as have been entirely unselfish produce their results  in his life in the mental world; therefore that life in the mental, world  cannot be other than blissful. The astral life, which the man has made for  himself either miserable or comparatively joyous, corresponds to what  Christians call purgatory; the lower mental life, which is always entirely  happy, is what is called heaven.    Man makes for himself his own purgatory and heaven, and these are not  planes, but states of consciousness. Hell does not exist; it is only a  figment of the theological imagination; but a man who lives foolishly may  make for himself a very unpleasant and long enduring purgatory. Neither  purgatory nor heaven can ever be eternal, for a finite cause cannot produce  an infinite result. The variations in individual cases are so wide that to  give actual figures is somewhat misleading. If we take the average man of  what is called the lower middle class, the typical specimen of which would  be a small shopkeeper or shop-assistant, his average life in the astral  world would be perhaps about forty years, and the life in the mental world  about two hundred. The man of spirituality and culture, on the other hand,  may have perhaps twenty years of life in the astral world and a thousand in  the heaven life. One who is specially developed may reduce the astral life  to a few days or hours and spend fifteen hundred years in heaven.    Not only does the length of these periods vary greatly, but the conditions  in both worlds also differ widely. The matter of which all these bodies are  built is not dead matter but living, and that fact has to be taken into  consideration. The physical body is built up of cells, each of which is a  tiny separate life animated by the Second Outpouring, which comes forth  from the Second Aspect of the Deity. These cells are of varying kinds and  fulfil various functions, and all these facts must be taken into account if  the man wishes to understand the work of his physical body and to live a  healthy life in it.    The same thing applies to the astral and mental bodies. In the cell-life  which permeates them there is as yet nothing in the way of intelligence,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12928"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 1 (#10)"],[1,"off, and that one of the  men, Worthington, who went after them, had not returned. The weather had  been so oppressive during the whole journey, that I determined on resting  the cattle next day. This I did not mention however to the men, but I  ordered all the good bush hands to be off in search at daybreak. The care  of cattle, and particularly of horses on such journeys, requires great  attention; to stand idle on a fine morning, unable to proceed, until by  some fortunate chance, stray cattle or horses are discovered in a  boundless forest, is like a calm on the line, irksome enough; but there  is also the risk of losing the men sent in pursuit who, even after coming  on the objects of their search, may be unable afterwards to find the  camp, especially when there may be no watercourse to lead them to it.    December 7.    The weather still very sultry. The horses were brought in at a  quarter-past eight by Worthington, who had traced them up the valley to  two miles above our former encampment. The rich soil in this valley is  nearly as deep as the bed of the rivulet, which is twenty feet lower than  the surface; a substratum of gravel, similar to that in the bed of the  watercourse, appears in the bank; the pebbles, consisting chiefly of  trap-rock, seemed to be the water-worn debris of the Liverpool range. The  cattle and horses being at rest, we were occupied this day in making  various observations with our instruments, trying the rate of the  chronometer, etc. A thundercloud and a little rain afforded some relief  from the excessive heat of the atmosphere. The night was very calm; but  the mosquitoes were numerous and troublesome.    A SQUATTER.    December 8.    A road or track, which we found about half a mile east from the camp, led  us very directly, on the bearing of 335 degrees, to Loder's station,  distant about six miles from our encampment. Here stood a tolerable house  of slabs, with a good garden adjoining it, in charge of an old stockman  and his equally aged wife. This man was named by the blacks Longanay  (Long Ned).* The station was situated on a fine running stream called the  Cuerindie, and the state of the sheep and cattle about it proved the  excellence of the pasture. We passed the limits of the territory open to  the selection of settlers, in crossing the Liverpool range; and the more  remote country is not likely to come into the market soon. Such stations  as this of Loder were held therefore only by the right of pre-occupancy,  which has been so generally recognised among the colonists themselves,  that the houses, etc. of these stations are sometimes disposed of for  valuable considerations, although the land is liable to be sold by the  government.    (*Footnote. His wife, whom the natives had told me of as a white gin, was  perhaps the only white woman then dwelling beyond the mountains. She was  enveloped in numerous flannel petticoats, and presented a singular  contrast to the undraped slender native females, some of whom with  children I saw about the place, and who appeared to be treated by her  with great kindness.)    NATIVE GUIDE AND HIS GIN.    A native named Jemmy, whom I met with here, agreed to conduct me by the  best way for carts to Wallamoul on the Peel, for which service I  undertook to reward him with a tomahawk.* It was necessary, that we  should ford the Cuerindie, which flows to the north-west, and  notwithstanding the steepness of its banks, we effected a passage without  difficulty, guided by Jemmy. One mile beyond this, another creek lay in  our way. It was smaller, but much more formidable and difficult to cross,  for the bottom and banks consisted of blue-mud or clay, half-hardened on  the surface, yet soft and yielding below. It was not without considerable  delay, that we effected the passage, for a wheel of one of the carts  stuck fast in the mud, and it was necessary to dig away the earth in  front of the other wheel before we could release the vehicle. At length  everything was got across, and we fortunately met no other impediment for  six miles. We then crossed the channels of two rivulets, neither of which  contained any water. At half-past four I wished to encamp, and the  natives having at length found a green mantling pool in the bed of the  united channel of the two watercourses, we pitched our tents, at a place  called Burandua. Bad as the water seemed to be, Jemmy soon obtained some  which was both clear and cool, by digging a hole in the sand near the  pool. This native was a quiet and sensible fellow--he steadily pursued  the course he recommended for the wheelbarrows, as he termed our carts;  and answered all my queries briefly and decidedly, either by a nod of  assent, or the negative monosyllable Bel, with a shake of the head. His  walk was extremely light and graceful; his shoulders were neatly knit,  and the flowing luxuriance of his locks was restrained by a bit of  half-inch cord, the two ends hanging, like a double queue, halfway down  his back. He was followed by his gin and a child, which she usually  carried on her back, although it seemed old enough and able to walk.    (*Footnote. A small axe used for numerous purposes by the natives of  Australia.)    The air of evening was very refreshing, and the sun set with peculiar  brilliancy. We had travelled during the whole day on good soil, and the  ploughed appearance of the surface was very remarkable in various places,  particularly a little to the south of Loder's station, where the hollows  seemed to terminate in a common channel. I noticed also that the  direction of all the watercourses was towards the north-west, and it was  evident that the streams occasionally overflowed their banks.    December 9.    This morning the party was ready to proceed soon after five o'clock, but  the barometer got out of order while I was using it in the dry bed of the  rivulet, and some time was lost in an unsuccessful attempt to repair it.  This derangement of the instrument was very unfortunate at so early a  stage of our journey.    After travelling about seven miles and a half we perceived, on our left,  an open valley in which a numerous herd of cattle was feeding; and one  mile further on, we came upon a fine little stream, which was rather  difficult to cross, owing to the steepness of the banks. As the men were  at work taking the carts over one by one, the native and I were amused  with a large black snake, which was swimming about. On his casting a  stone at it the snake glided swiftly towards him, and the poor fellow  took to his heels, cautioning me to keep off, saying it would kill my  horse. But he soon returned to the charge, and having succeeded in  stunning it with stones, it was at length cut in two with my sabre. On  measuring this snake I found it to be nine inches in circumference, and  eight feet and a half in length.    Beyond that rivulet the country appeared tolerably open and level, so  that we could pursue our course in one direction nearly eight miles. The  most conspicuous hill on our right, was named by the native Barragundy.  It was visible during the whole of our day's journey. We at length  entered upon an open and grassy plain, and found in the skirts of the  wood beyond it, a channel containing water in abundance, and which was  known to the natives as Carrabobbila.* Beyond this channel arose a peaked  and picturesque range, whereof the highest summit was named Turi.    (*Footnote. Even before my men had seen this spot, the native name, in  their mouths, was corrupted into Terrible Billy!)    MODES OF DRINKING AU NATUREL.    The water, when we encamped, was hot and muddy, but the blacks knew well  how to obtain a cool and clean draught, by first scratching a hole in the  soft sand beside the pool, thus making a filter, in which the water rose  cooled but muddy. They next threw into this some tufts of long grass,  through which they sucked the cooler water thus purified also from the  sand or gravel. I was very glad to follow the example, and I found the  sweet fragrance of the grass an agreeable addition to the luxury of  drinking. But during the heat of the forenoon I had observed the female  quenching her thirst with still greater satisfaction, by rushing into a  pool, and drinking as she sat immersed up to the lip.    From Loder's station, we had travelled thus far on our way to Peel's  river, without having any road or track to follow, and I had marked the  trees along our line of route, which certainly seemed favourable for a  cart-road in that direction. Near Carrabobbila, we came upon the track  leading to Wallamoul, which was more circuitous, passing by other cattle  stations in the plains.    WOODS ON FIRE.    During the last three days of our journey, the woods were burning before  us, but fortunately the fire was one day's march in advance of our party,  and thus the flames had cleared everything away before our arrival, so  that our camp was not exposed to danger. This evening however, the  country seemed on fire all around us. The weather was calm and sultry,  particularly when the day closed in, and a very heavy storm, accompanied  by thunder, broke over us in the night.    December 10.    The morning was cloudy; and the rain, which we anxiously looked for, at  length came down, and soon checked the progress of the flames. On this  account, as well as on that of the want of water, it afforded  providential relief to us, for the hills we were about to cross had been  all in a blaze during the night. Trees lay smoking as we passed; several  gullies were difficult for the passage of carts, and detained the party  in its ascent.    CROSS THE TURI RANGE.    But at length we reached the top of this pass, and crossed the range,  which appeared to be continuous, thus separating the basin of the Peel  from that of the waters falling to Liverpool plains. We were agreeably  surprised to find that the opposite side of these hills, and the whole"]]]
