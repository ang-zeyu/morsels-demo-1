He's heard some about you. Told about the  ace of spades they put over the bullet holes in thet cowpuncher Bain  you plugged. Then there was a rancher shot at a water-hole twenty miles  south of Wellston. Reckon you didn't do it?\"    \"No, I certainly did not,\" replied Duane.    \"Wal, you get the blame. It ain't nothin' for a feller to be saddled  with gun-plays he never made. An', Buck, if you ever get famous, as  seems likely, you'll be blamed for many a crime. The border'll make an  outlaw an' murderer out of you. Wal, thet's enough of thet. I've more  news. You're goin' to be popular.\"    \"Popular? What do you mean?\"    \"I met Bland's wife this mornin'. She seen you the other day when you  rode in. She shore wants to meet you, an' so do some of the other women  in camp. They always want to meet the new fellers who've just come  in. It's lonesome for women here, an' they like to hear news from the  towns.\"    \"Well, Euchre, I don't want to be impolite, but I'd rather not meet any  women,\" rejoined Duane.    \"I was afraid you wouldn't. Don't blame you much. Women are hell. I was  hopin', though, you might talk a little to thet poor lonesome kid.\"    \"What kid?\" inquired Duane, in surprise.    \"Didn't I tell you about Jennie--the girl Bland's holdin' here--the one  Jackrabbit Benson had a hand in stealin'?\"    \"You mentioned a girl. That's all. Tell me now,\" replied Duane,  abruptly.    \"Wal, I got it this way. Mebbe it's straight, an' mebbe it ain't. Some  years ago Benson made a trip over the river to buy mescal an' other  drinks. He'll sneak over there once in a while. An' as I get it he run  across a gang of greasers with some gringo prisoners. I don't know, but  I reckon there was some barterin', perhaps murderin'. Anyway, Benson  fetched the girl back. She was more dead than alive. But it turned out  she was only starved an' scared half to death. She hadn't been harmed.  I reckon she was then about fourteen years old. Benson's idee, he said,  was to use her in his den sellin' drinks an' the like. But I never  went much on Jackrabbit's word. Bland seen the kid right off and took  her--bought her from Benson. You can gamble Bland didn't do thet from  notions of chivalry. I ain't gainsayin, however, but thet Jennie was  better off with Kate Bland. She's been hard on Jennie, but she's kept  Bland an' the other men from treatin' the kid shameful. Late Jennie has  growed into an all-fired pretty girl, an' Kate is powerful jealous of  her. I can see hell brewin' over there in Bland's cabin. Thet's why  I wish you'd come over with me. Bland's hardly ever home. His wife's  invited you. Shore, if she gets sweet on you, as she has on--Wal, thet  'd complicate matters. But you'd get to see Jennie, an' mebbe you could  help her. Mind, I ain't hintin' nothin'. I'm just wantin' to put her  in your way. You're a man an' can think fer yourself. I had a baby girl  once, an' if she'd lived she be as big as Jennie now, an', by Gawd, I  wouldn't want her here in Bland's camp.\"    \"I'll go, Euchre. Take me over,\" replied Duane. He felt Euchre's eyes  upon him. The old outlaw, however, had no more to say.    In the afternoon Euchre set off with Duane, and soon they reached  Bland's cabin. Duane remembered it as the one where he had seen the  pretty woman watching him ride by. He could not recall what she looked  like. The cabin was the same as the other adobe structures in the  valley, but it was larger and pleasantly located rather high up in a  grove of cottonwoods. In the windows and upon the porch were evidences  of a woman's hand. Through the open door Duane caught a glimpse of  bright Mexican blankets and rugs.    Euchre knocked upon the side of the door.    \"Is that you, Euchre?\" asked a girl's voice, low, hesitatingly. The tone  of it, rather deep and with a note of fear, struck Duane. He wondered  what she would be like.    \"Yes, it's me, Jennie. Where's Mrs. Bland?\" answered Euchre.    \"She went over to Deger's. There's somebody sick,\" replied the girl.    Euchre turned and whispered something about luck. The snap of the  outlaw's eyes was added significance to Duane.    \"Jennie, come out or let us come in. Here's the young man I was tellin'  you about,\" Euchre said.    \"Oh, I can't! I look so--so--\"    \"Never mind how you look,\" interrupted the outlaw, in a whisper. \"It  ain't no time to care fer thet. Here's young Duane. Jennie, he's no  rustler, no thief. He's different. Come out, Jennie, an' mebbe he'll--\"    Euchre did not complete his sentence. He had spoken low, with his glance  shifting from side to side.    But what he said was sufficient to bring the girl quickly. She appeared  in the doorway with downcast eyes and a stain of red in her white cheek.  She had a pretty, sad face and bright hair.    \"Don't be bashful, Jennie,\" said Euchre. \"You an' Duane have a chance to  talk a little. Now I'll go fetch Mrs. Bland, but I won't be hurryin'.\"    With that Euchre went away through the cottonwoods.    \"I'm glad to meet you, Miss--Miss Jennie,\" said Duane. \"Euchre didn't  mention your last name. He asked me to come over to--\"    Duane's attempt at pleasantry halted short when Jennie lifted her lashes  to look at him. Some kind of a shock went through Duane. Her gray eyes  were beautiful, but it had not been beauty that cut short his speech. He  seemed to see a tragic struggle between hope and doubt that shone in her  piercing gaze. She kept looking, and Duane could not break the silence.  It was no ordinary moment.    \"What did you come here for?\" she asked, at last.    \"To see you,\" replied Duane, glad to speak.    \"Why?\"    \"Well--Euchre thought--he wanted me to talk to you, cheer you up a bit,\"  replied Duane, somewhat lamely. The earnest eyes embarrassed him.    \"Euchre's good. He's the only person in this awful place who's been good  to me. But he's afraid of Bland. He said you were different. Who are  you?\"    Duane told her.    \"You're not a robber or rustler or murderer or some bad man come here to  hide?\"    \"No, I'm not,\" replied Duane, trying to smile.    \"Then why are you here?\"    \"I'm on the dodge. You know what that means. I got in a shooting-scrape  at home and had to run off. When it blows over I hope to go back.\"    \"But you can't be honest here?\"    \"Yes, I can.\"    \"Oh, I know what these outlaws are. Yes, you're different.\" She kept the  strained gaze upon him, but hope was kindling, and the hard lines of her  youthful face were softening.    Something sweet and warm stirred deep in Duane as he realized the  unfortunate girl was experiencing a birth of trust in him.    \"O God! Maybe you're the man to save me--to take me away before it's too  late.\"    Duane's spirit leaped.    \"Maybe I am,\" he replied, instantly.    She seemed to check a blind impulse to run into his arms. Her cheek  flamed, her lips quivered, her bosom swelled under her ragged dress.  Then the glow began to fade; doubt once more assailed her.    \"It can't be. You're only--after me, too, like Bland--like all of them.\"    Duane's long arms went out and his hands clasped her shoulders. He shook  her.    \"Look at me--straight in the eye. There are decent men. Haven't you a  father--a brother?\"    \"They're dead--killed by raiders. We lived in Dimmit County. I was  carried away,\" Jennie replied, hurriedly. She put up an appealing hand  to him. \"Forgive me. I believe--I know you're good. It was only--I live  so much in fear--I'm half crazy--I've almost forgotten what good men are  like, Mister Duane, you'll help me?\"    \"Yes, Jennie, I will. Tell me how. What must I do? Have you any plan?\"    \"Oh no. But take me away.\"    \"I'll try,\" said Duane, simply. \"That won't be easy, though. I must  have time to think. You must help me. There are many things to consider.  Horses, food, trails, and then the best time to make the attempt. Are  you watched--kept prisoner?\"    \"No. I could have run off lots of times. But I was afraid. I'd only have  fallen into worse hands. Euchre has told me that. Mrs. Bland beats me,  half starves me, but she has kept me from her husband and these other  dogs. She's been as good as that, and I'm grateful. She hasn't done it  for love of me, though. She always hated me. And lately she's growing  jealous. There was' a man came here by the name of Spence--so he called  himself. He tried to be kind to me. But she wouldn't let him. She was  in love with him. She's a bad woman. Bland finally shot Spence, and  that ended that. She's been jealous ever since. I hear her fighting with  Bland about me. She swears she'll kill me before he gets me. And Bland  laughs in her face. Then I've heard Chess Alloway try to persuade Bland  to give me to him. But Bland doesn't laugh then. Just lately before  Bland went away things almost came to a head. I couldn't sleep. I wished  Mrs. Bland would kill me. I'll certainly kill myself if they ruin me.  Duane, you must be quick if you'd save me.\"    \"I realize that,\" replied he, thoughtfully. \"I think my difficulty will  be to fool Mrs. Bland. If she suspected me she'd have the whole gang of  outlaws on me at once.\"    \"She would that. You've got to be careful--and quick.\"    \"What kind of woman is she?\" inquired Duane.    \"She's--she's brazen. I've heard her with her lovers. They get drunk  sometimes when Bland's away. She's got a terrible temper. She's vain.  She likes flattery. Oh, you could fool her easy enough if you'd lower  yourself to--to--\"    \"To make love to her?\" interrupted Duane.    Jennie bravely turned shamed eyes to meet his.    \"My girl, I'd do worse than that to get you away from here,\" he said,  bluntly.    \"But--Duane,\" she faltered, and again she put out the appealing hand.  \"Bland will kill you.\"    Duane made no reply to this. He was trying to still a rising strange  tumult in his breast. The old emotion--the rush of an instinct to kill! "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10317"],[0,"Betty Gordon at Boarding School; Or, The Treasure of Indian Chasm (#10)"],[1,"three gray stone buildings, connected  with bridges, in which were the dormitories, the teachers' rooms, the  dining room, the infirmary, and the kitchens. The administration building  was also connected with the other buildings by a covered passageway  which, they were to discover, was opened only in bad weather. Mrs.  Eustice, the principal, had a theory that girls did not get out into the  fresh air often enough.    The main building possessed a handsome doorway, and here the busses  stopped and discharged their passengers.    \"Ada, my dear love!\" cried a girl from the bus behind the one in which  Betty and her friends had ridden.    An over-dressed, stout girl advanced upon Ada Nansen and kissed her  affectionately.    \"Look quick! That's Ruth Gladys Royal!\" whispered Bobby. \"I hope they  room together--they'll be a pair. Ada, my dear love!\" she mimicked  wickedly. \"Libbie, let that be a warning to you--Ruth Gladys Royal is  terribly romantic, too!\"    Miss Anderson, smiling and unhurried, marshaled her charges into the  large foyer and announced that they would be assigned to rooms  before luncheon.    \"Mrs. Eustice will speak to you in the assembly hall this afternoon,\"  said Miss Anderson. \"And you will meet her and the teachers for a little  social hour.\"    Two busy young clerks were at work in the office adjoining the foyer, and  for those who were already provided with a room-mate the task of securing  a room was a matter of only a few moments.    Our girls, with the exception of Louise, had paired off when they had  registered for the term. Bobby Littell and Betty Gordon were, of course,  inseparable. Libbie and Frances, great friends in their home town,  naturally gravitated together, though Betty would have chosen a less  studious room-mate for the dreamy Libbie--she needed a girl who would  know more accurately what she was doing. Norma and Alice Guerin were to  share a room, and Louise felt forlornly out of things when Miss Anderson  came up to her bringing a red-haired, freckle-faced girl with wide gray  eyes and a boyish grin.    \"Louise Littell--you are Louise, aren't you?\" asked the teacher. \"Well,  here's a girl who's come to us from a Western army post. Her name is  Constance Howard, and she doesn't know a single girl. Don't you think  you two might be happy together?\"    Constance smiled again, and Louise warmed perceptibly. Louise was the  least friendly of the three Littell girls.    \"I'll let you play my ukulele,\" offered Constance eagerly.    \"Let me. She doesn't know a ukulele from a music box,\" said Bobby, with  sisterly frankness. \"Come on, girls, let's go up and see our rooms.\"    They tramped up the broad staircase and crossed one of the bridges to  find themselves in a delightful, sunny building with corridors carpeted  in softest green. The rooms apparently were all connecting, and the  teacher who met them said the eight friends might have adjoining rooms as  long as \"they gave no trouble.\"    \"I'm your corridor teacher, Miss Lacey,\" she explained.    \"Let's be glad she isn't the one we saw on the train,\" whispered the  irrepressible Bobby, as they all trooped into the first room.          CHAPTER XI    FIRST IMPRESSIONS      It was soon settled that Betty and Bobby were to have the center room in  a suite of three and Libbie and Frances should be on one side of them,  and Louise and Constance Howard on the other. There was a perfectly  appointed bathroom opening off the center room which the six were to  share. Norma and Alice Guerin were given a room that adjoined that  occupied by Libbie and Frances, but nominally, Miss Lacey explained, they  would be considered as a unit in the next suite of three connecting  rooms. Fortunately two very friendly, quiet girls drew the room  immediately next to the Guerin girls.    \"But, Betty, listen,\" whispered Norma Guerin, drawing Betty aside as a  great bumping and banging announced the arrival of the trunks. \"Who do  you suppose has the room next to the Bennett sisters? Ada Nansen and Ruth  Gladys Royal!\"    \"You are in hard luck!\" commented Bobby, who had overheard, as she danced  off to open the door to the grinning expressman.    \"All the porters are busy!\" the man explained.    \"So I just told 'em Tim McCarthy wasn't one to stand by and let work go  undone. Where would ye be wantin' these little bags put now?\"    He had a trunk on his back that, as Bobby afterward remarked to Betty,  \"would have done for an elephant.\"    \"Girls, whose trunk is this?\" demanded Bobby.    \"Not mine!\" came like a well-drilled chorus.    \"'Miss Ada Nansen,'\" read Betty, examining the card. \"Bobby, that's one  of the five!\"    They directed the perspiring expressman to the right door and, it is to  be regretted, shamelessly peeped while he toiled up and down bringing the  five trunks and three hat boxes. Then he began on the baggage consigned  to Ruth Gladys Royal, and the watchers counted three trunks.    Betty looked at the Guerin girls and laughed.    \"Eight trunks!\" she gasped. \"They can't get that number in one room.  Not and have any room for the furniture. Norma, do go and see what  you can see.\"    Norma sped away, and returned as speedily, her eyes blazing.    \"What do you think?\" she demanded furiously. \"They've had some of 'em put  in our room, three I counted, and two in the Bennett girls' room. They're  as mad as hops!\"    \"The Bennett girls are my friends,\" declared Bobby Littell sententiously.  \"I only hope they're mad enough to hop right down to the office and  explain the state of things.\"    But the luncheon gong sounded just then, and a laughing, colorful throng  of femininity swept down the broad stairs to the dining room.    \"How lovely!\" said Betty involuntarily.    There were no long tables in the large, airy room. Instead, round tables  that seated from six to eight, each daintily set and with a slender vase  of flowers in the center of each. Betty and Bobby had the same thought at  the same moment.    \"If we could only sit together, all of us!\" their eyes telegraphed.    \"They're all taking the tables they want and standing by the chairs,\"  whispered Betty. \"Let's do that.\"    A table set for eight was close to the door. Betty, Bobby, Louise,  Frances, Libbie, Constance, Norma and Alice gently surrounded this and  stood quietly behind the chairs.    Some one, somewhere, gave a signal, and the roomful was seated as  if by magic.    \"I see--those four tables over by the window are for the teachers,\"  whispered Betty. \"I see Miss Anderson and Miss Lacey, and that  white-haired woman must be the principal. Yes, and girls, there's that  woman whom the boys tormented so on the train!\"    Sure enough, there she was, looking even more severe now that her hat  was removed and her sharp features were unrelieved.    \"If this isn't fun! I'm sorry for poor Esther at Miss Graham's,\"  said Bobby, looking about her with delight. \"Mercy, what do you  suppose this is?\"    One of the young clerks from the office approached the table, a large  cardboard sheet in her hand.    \"I'm filling in the diagram,\" she explained. \"You mustn't change your  seats without permission. Tell me your names, and I'll put you down in  the right spaces.\"    Betty looked over her shoulder as she wrote down their names. Like the  diagram of the seating space of a theatre, the tables and chairs were  plainly marked. Betty swiftly calculated that between one hundred and  twenty-five and one hundred and fifty girls must be seated in the room.  Later she learned that the total enrollment was one hundred and sixty.    Just outside the dining room was a large bulletin board, impossible to  ignore or overlook. When they came out from luncheon a notice was posted  that Mrs. Eustice would address the school at two o'clock in the assembly  hall in the main building. It was now one-thirty.    \"Let's go look at the gym,\" suggested Bobby. \"We have time. Oh, how do  you do?\"--this last was apparently jerked out of her.    \"I didn't know you were coming to Shadyside, Bobby,\" said Ruth Gladys  Royal effusively. \"Do you know my chum, Ada Nansen? She's from San  Francisco.\"    \"Constance Howard is from the West, too--the Presidio,\" said Bobby.    Gracefully she introduced the others to Ada and Ruth who surveyed them  indifferently. The Littell girls they knew were wealthy and had a place  in Washington society, but the rest were not yet classified.    \"Haven't I seen you before?\" Ada languidly questioned Betty. \"You're not  the little waitress--Oh, how stupid of me! I was thinking of a girl who  looked enough like you to be your sister.\"    Bobby bristled indignantly, but Betty struggled with laughter.    \"I remember you,\" she said clearly. \"You had the wrong seat on the train  from Oklahoma.\"    Ada Nansen glanced at her with positive dislike.    \"I don't recall,\" she said icily. \"However, I've traveled so much I  daresay many incidents slip my mind. Well, Gladys, let's go in and get  good seats. I want to hear Mrs. Eustice; they say she is a direct  descendant of Richard Carvel.\"    \"We might as well go in, too,\" said Bobby disconsolately. \"She's used up  so much time we couldn't do the gym justice.\"    Promptly at two o'clock, white-haired Mrs. Eustice mounted the platform  and tapped a little bell for silence.    The principal was a gracious woman of perhaps fifty. Her snow-white hair  was piled high on her head and her dark eyes were bright and keen.  Wonderful eyes they were, seeming to gaze straight into the youthful eyes  that stared back affectionately or curiously as the case might be. Mrs.  Eustice's gown was of black or very dark blue silk, made simply and  fitting exquisitely. Straight, soft collar and cuffs of dotted net  outlined the neck and wrists, and her single ornament was a tiny watch  worn on a black ribbon.    \"I wish Ada Nansen would take a good look at her,\" muttered Bobby.    \"I am so glad to welcome you, my girls,\" began Mrs. Eustice.    Betty thrilled to"]]]
