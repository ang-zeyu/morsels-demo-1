Gottschalk,    whose sweet and dainty melodies    breathe the true spirit of fairyland,    this book is affectionately dedicated        To My Readers    The very marked success of my last year's fairy book, \"The Patchwork  Girl of Oz,\" convinces me that my readers like the Oz stories \"best of  all,\" as one little girl wrote me. So here, my dears, is a new Oz story  in which is introduced Ann Soforth, the Queen of Oogaboo, whom Tik-Tok  assisted in conquering our old acquaintance, the Nome King. It also  tells of Betsy Bobbin and how, after many adventures, she finally  reached the marvelous Land of Oz.    There is a play called \"The Tik-Tok Man of Oz,\" but it is not like this  story of \"Tik-Tok of Oz,\" although some of the adventures recorded in  this book, as well as those in several other Oz books, are included in  the play. Those who have seen the play and those who have read the  other Oz books will find in this story a lot of strange characters and  adventures that they have never heard of before.    In the letters I receive from children there has been an urgent appeal  for me to write a story that will take Trot and Cap'n Bill to the Land  of Oz, where they will meet Dorothy and Ozma. Also they think  Button-Bright ought to get acquainted with Ojo the Lucky. As you know,  I am obliged to talk these matters over with Dorothy by means of the  \"wireless,\" for that is the only way I can communicate with the Land of  Oz. When I asked her about this idea, she replied: \"Why, haven't you  heard?\" I said \"No.\" \"Well,\" came the message over the wireless, \"I'll  tell you all about it, by and by, and then you can make a book of that  story for the children to read.\"    So, if Dorothy keeps her word and I am permitted to write another Oz  book, you will probably discover how all these characters came together  in the famous Emerald City. Meantime, I want to tell all my little  friends--whose numbers are increasing by many thousands every  year--that I am very grateful for the favor they have shown my books  and for the delightful little letters I am constantly receiving. I am  almost sure that I have as many friends among the children of America  as any story writer alive; and this, of course, makes me very proud and  happy.    L.

It is beneath my  dignity.\"    \"Some one must sweep it,\" replied Ann's younger sister, Salye; \"else we  shall soon be wading in dust. And you are the eldest, and the head of  the family.\"    \"I'm Queen of Oogaboo,\" said Ann, proudly. \"But,\" she added with a  sigh, \"my kingdom is the smallest and the poorest in all the Land of  Oz.\"    This was quite true. Away up in the mountains, in a far corner of the  beautiful fairyland of Oz, lies a small valley which is named Oogaboo,  and in this valley lived a few people who were usually happy and  contented and never cared to wander over the mountain pass into the  more settled parts of the land. They knew that all of Oz, including  their own territory, was ruled by a beautiful Princess named Ozma, who  lived in the splendid Emerald City; yet the simple folk of Oogaboo  never visited Ozma. They had a royal family of their own--not  especially to rule over them, but just as a matter of pride. Ozma  permitted the various parts of her country to have their Kings and  Queens and Emperors and the like, but all were ruled over by the lovely  girl Queen of the Emerald City.    The King of Oogaboo used to be a man named Jol Jemkiph Soforth, who for  many years did all the drudgery of deciding disputes and telling his  people when to plant cabbages and pickle onions. But the King's wife  had a sharp tongue and small respect for the King, her husband;  therefore one night King Jol crept over the pass into the Land of Oz  and disappeared from Oogaboo for good and all. The Queen waited a few  years for him to return and then started in search of him, leaving her  eldest daughter, Ann Soforth, to act as Queen.    Now, Ann had not forgotten when her birthday came, for that meant a  party and feasting and dancing, but she had quite forgotten how many  years the birthdays marked. In a land where people live always, this is  not considered a cause for regret, so we may justly say that Queen Ann  of Oogaboo was old enough to make jelly--and let it go at that.    But she didn't make jelly, or do any more of the housework than she  could help. She was an ambitious woman and constantly resented the fact  that her kingdom was so tiny and her people so stupid and  unenterprising. Often she wondered what had become of her father and  mother, out beyond the pass, in the wonderful Land of Oz, and the fact  that they did not return to Oogaboo led Ann to suspect that they had  found a better place to live. So, when Salye refused to sweep the floor  of the living room in the palace, and Ann would not sweep it, either,  she said to her sister:    \"I'm going away. This absurd Kingdom of Oogaboo tires me.\"    \"Go, if you want to,\" answered Salye; \"but you are very foolish to  leave this place.\"    \"Why?\" asked Ann.    \"Because in the Land of Oz, which is Ozma's country, you will be a  nobody, while here you are a Queen.\"    \"Oh, yes! Queen over eighteen men, twenty-seven women and forty-four  children!\" returned Ann bitterly.    \"Well, there are certainly more people than that in the great Land of  Oz,\" laughed Salye. \"Why don't you raise an army and conquer them, and  be Queen of all Oz?\" she asked, trying to taunt Ann and so to anger  her. Then she made a face at her sister and went into the back yard to  swing in the hammock.    Her jeering words, however, had given Queen Ann an idea. She reflected  that Oz was reported to be a peaceful country and Ozma a mere girl who  ruled with gentleness to all and was obeyed because her people loved  her. Even in Oogaboo the story was told that Ozma's sole army consisted  of twenty-seven fine officers, who wore beautiful uniforms but carried  no weapons, because there was no one to fight. Once there had been a  private soldier, besides the officers, but Ozma had made him a  Captain-General and taken away his gun for fear it might accidentally  hurt some one.    The more Ann thought about the matter the more she was convinced it  would be easy to conquer the Land of Oz and set herself up as Ruler in  Ozma's place, if she but had an Army to do it with. Afterward she could  go out into the world and conquer other lands, and then perhaps she  could find a way to the moon, and conquer that. She had a warlike  spirit that preferred trouble to idleness.    It all depended on an Army, Ann decided. She carefully counted in her  mind all the men of her kingdom. Yes; there were exactly eighteen of  them, all told. That would not make a very big Army, but by surprising  Ozma's unarmed officers her men might easily subdue them. \"Gentle  people are always afraid of those that bluster,\" Ann told herself. \"I  don't wish to shed any blood, for that would shock my nerves and I  might faint; but if we threaten and flash our weapons I am sure the  people of Oz will fall upon their knees before me and surrender.\"    This argument, which she repeated to herself more than once, finally  determined the Queen of Oogaboo to undertake the audacious venture.    \"Whatever happens,\" she reflected, \"can make me no more unhappy than my  staying shut up in this miserable valley and sweeping floors and  quarreling with Sister Salye; so I will venture all, and win what I  may.\"    That very day she started out to organize her Army.    The first man she came to was Jo Apple, so called because he had an  apple orchard.    \"Jo,\" said Ann, \"I am going to conquer the world, and I want you to  join my Army.\"    \"Don't ask me to do such a fool thing, for I must politely refuse Your  Majesty,\" said Jo Apple.    \"I have no intention of asking you. I shall command you, as Queen of  Oogaboo, to join,\" said Ann.    \"In that case, I suppose I must obey,\" the man remarked, in a sad  voice. \"But I pray you to consider that I am a very important citizen,  and for that reason am entitled to an office of high rank.\"    \"You shall be a General,\" promised Ann.    \"With gold epaulets and a sword?\" he asked.    \"Of course,\" said the Queen.    Then she went to the next man, whose name was Jo Bunn, as he owned an  orchard where graham-buns and wheat-buns, in great variety, both hot  and cold, grew on the trees.    \"Jo,\" said Ann, \"I am going to conquer the world, and I command you to  join my Army.\"    \"Impossible!\" he exclaimed. \"The bun crop has to be picked.\"    \"Let your wife and children do the picking,\" said Ann.    \"But I'm a man of great importance, Your Majesty,\" he protested.    \"For that reason you shall be one of my Generals, and wear a cocked hat  with gold braid, and curl your mustaches and clank a long sword,\" she  promised.    So he consented, although sorely against his will, and the Queen walked  on to the next cottage.

It was no easy task to obey this order and land Trot and Cap'n Bill  safely in Oz, as you will discover by reading this book. Indeed, it  required the best efforts of our dear old friend, the Scarecrow, to  save them from a dreadful fate on the journey; but the story leaves  them happily located in Ozma's splendid palace and Dorothy has promised  me that Button-Bright and the three girls are sure to encounter, in the  near future, some marvelous adventures in the Land of Oz, which I hope  to be permitted to relate to you in the next Oz Book.    Meantime, I am deeply grateful to my little readers for their continued  enthusiasm over the Oz stories, as evinced in the many letters they  send me, all of which are lovingly cherished. It takes more and more Oz  Books every year to satisfy the demands of old and new readers, and  there have been formed many \"Oz Reading Societies,\" where the Oz Books  owned by different members are read aloud.  All this is very gratifying  to me and encourages me to write more stories. When the children have  had enough of them, I hope they will let me know, and then I'll try to  write something different.    L.

It's the knowing ones that realize one  lifetime ain't long enough to git more'n a few dips o' the oars of  knowledge.\"    Trot didn't answer. She was a very little girl, with big, solemn eyes  and an earnest, simple manner. Cap'n Bill had been her faithful  companion for years and had taught her almost everything she knew.    He was a wonderful man, this Cap'n Bill. Not so very old, although his  hair was grizzled--what there was of it. Most of his head was bald as  an egg and as shiny as oilcloth, and this made his big ears stick out  in a funny way. His eyes had a gentle look and were pale blue in color,  and his round face was rugged and bronzed. Cap'n Bill's left leg was  missing, from the knee down, and that was why the sailor no longer  sailed the seas. The wooden leg he wore was good enough to stump around  with on land, or even to take Trot out for a row or a sail on the  ocean, but when it came to \"runnin' up aloft\" or performing active  duties on shipboard, the old sailor was not equal to the task. The loss  of his leg had ruined his career and the old sailor found comfort in  devoting himself to the education and companionship of the little girl.    The accident to Cap'n Bill's leg bad happened at about the time Trot  was born, and ever since that he had lived with Trot's mother as \"a  star boarder,\" having enough money saved up to pay for his weekly  \"keep.\"  He loved the baby and often held her on his lap; her first  ride was on Cap'n Bill's shoulders, for she had no baby-carriage; and  when she began to toddle around, the child and the sailor became close  comrades and enjoyed many strange adventures together. It is said the  fairies had been present at Trot's birth and had marked her forehead  with their invisible mystic signs, so that she was able to see and do  many wonderful things.    The acacia tree was on top of a high bluff, but a path ran down the  bank in a zigzag way to the water's edge, where Cap'n Bill's boat was  moored to a rock by means of a stout cable. It had been a hot, sultry  afternoon, with scarcely a breath of air stirring, so Cap'n Bill and  Trot had been quietly sitting beneath the shade of the tree, waiting  for the sun to get low enough for them to take a row.    They had decided to visit one of the great caves which the waves had  washed out of the rocky coast during many years of steady effort. The  caves were a source of continual delight to both the girl and the  sailor, who loved to explore their awesome depths.    \"I b'lieve, Cap'n,\" remarked Trot, at last, \"that it's time for us to  start.\"    The old man cast a shrewd glance at the sky, the sea and the motionless  boat. Then he shook his head.    \"Mebbe it's time, Trot,\" he answered, \"but I don't jes' like the looks  o' things this afternoon.\"    \"What's wrong?\" she asked wonderingly.    \"Can't say as to that. Things is too quiet to suit me, that's all. No  breeze, not a ripple a-top the water, nary a gull a-flyin' anywhere,  an' the end o' the hottest day o' the year. I ain't no weather-prophet,  Trot, but any sailor would know the signs is ominous.\"    \"There's nothing wrong that I can see,\" said Trot.    \"If there was a cloud in the sky even as big as my thumb, we might  worry about it; but--look, Cap'n!--the sky is as clear as can be.\"    He looked again and nodded.    \"P'r'aps we can make the cave, all right,\" he agreed, not wishing to  disappoint her.  \"It's only a little way out, an' we'll be on the  watch; so come along, Trot.\"    Together they descended the winding path to the beach. It was no  trouble for the girl to keep her footing on the steep way, but Cap'n  Bill, because of his wooden leg, had to hold on to rocks and roots now  and then to save himself from tumbling. On a level path he was as spry  as anyone, but to climb up hill or down required some care.    They reached the boat safely and while Trot was untying the rope Cap'n  Bill reached into a crevice of the rock and drew out several tallow  candles and a box of wax matches, which he thrust into the capacious  pockets of his \"sou'wester.\"  This sou'wester was a short coat of  oilskin which the old sailor wore on all occasions--when he wore a coat  at all--and the pockets always contained a variety of objects, useful  and ornamental, which made even Trot wonder where they all came from  and why Cap'n Bill should treasure them. The jackknives--a big one and  a little one--the bits of cord, the fishhooks, the nails: these were  handy to have on certain occasions. But bits of shell, and tin boxes  with unknown contents, buttons, pincers, bottles of curious stones and  the like, seemed quite unnecessary to carry around. That was Cap'n  Bill's business, however, and now that he added the candles and the  matches to his collection Trot made no comment, for she knew these last  were to light their way through the caves. The sailor always rowed the  boat, for he handled the oars with strength and skill. Trot sat in the  stern and steered. The place where they embarked was a little bight or  circular bay, and the boat cut across a much larger bay toward a  distant headland where the caves were located, right at the water's  edge. They were nearly a mile from shore and about halfway across the  bay when Trot suddenly sat up straight and exclaimed: \"What's that,  Cap'n?\"    He stopped rowing and turned half around to look.    \"That, Trot,\" he slowly replied, \"looks to me mighty like a whirlpool.\"    \"What makes it, Cap'n?\"    \"A whirl in the air makes the whirl in the water. I was afraid as we'd  meet with trouble, Trot. Things didn't look right. The air was too  still.\"    \"It's coming closer,\" said the girl.    The old man grabbed the oars and began rowing with all his strength.    \"'Tain't comin' closer to us, Trot,\" he gasped; \"it's we that are  comin' closer to the whirlpool. The thing is drawin' us to it like a  magnet!\"    Trot's sun-bronzed face was a little paler as she grasped the tiller  firmly and tried to steer the boat away; but she said not a word to  indicate fear.    The swirl of the water as they came nearer made a roaring sound that  was fearful to listen to. So fierce and powerful was the whirlpool that  it drew the surface of the sea into the form of a great basin, slanting"]]]
