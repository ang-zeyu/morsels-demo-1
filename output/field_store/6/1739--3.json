The `Tsala ea Batho', of Kimberley, said:  \"We are standing on the brink  of the precipice.  We appealed to certain members of Parliament against  the suspension clause in Mr. Sauer's Land Bill, and the result of our appeal  has been an agreement between Sir Thomas Smartt and the Minister  to the effect that the first part of the Bill only be proceeded with.  The effect of this agreement is infinitely worse than the whole Bill.  In its entirety, there were certain saving clauses, one of them  practically excluding the Cape Province from the operation of the Bill.  Under the present agreement, all these clauses are dropped,  and section 1 of the Bill, which prohibits the sale of land  between Europeans and Natives (pending the report of a future Commission)  is applicable to all parts of the Union, including the Cape Province.  Now, then, if this suspension clause becomes law, what is going to happen?  It is simply this:  That the whole land policy of the Union of South Africa  is the land policy of the Orange Free State, and it will be as difficult  to abrogate that suspension as it is difficult to recall a bullet,  once fired through some one's head, and resuscitate the victim.  Our object then should be to prevent the pistol being fired off,  as prevention is infinitely better than cure.\"  One paper  that he was quoting from was (Mr. Schreiner went on to say) pleased,  because it believed that this Bill was going to Select Committee.  There was another native paper, published in Natal, which acknowledged  the efforts which the missionaries had made on behalf of the Natives  in regard to this Bill.  There was a native paper, published at Dundee,  which said that, if the Bill were in the interests of the Natives,  and the Government were actuated by a sincere regard for them,  they would not have hesitated to publish it broadcast, instead of being  in such haste to push the matter through the House.*    --  * All efforts to induce the South African Government to circulate    translations of the Natives' Land Act among the Natives of the Union    have proved fruitless.  -- Author.  --    Mr. Schreiner (continuing) referred to the resolution passed  by the Natal Missionary Conference, and the views expressed  by the Chairman of the Transvaal Missionary Conference in opposition  to the Bill.  He mentioned that it had been decided in Johannesburg  to call a meeting of missionary societies throughout the Union,  to determine what action could be taken in case clause 1 was proceeded with.  He had also received a telegram from the Witwatersrand Church Council,  stating that a telegram had been sent to the Minister strongly protesting  against section 1 being enacted before the proposed Commission  had thoroughly investigated the whole question of alternative areas.  Mr. Schreiner urged that, if they proceeded with this Bill,  and passed clause 1 of the old Bill, and appointed a Commission,  these restrictions with regard to purchase and sale, which the Natives  had feared, and which the missionaries, on behalf of the Natives,  feared and protested against, would become a fact.  For that reason,  he said they should rather put off the Bill.    Every one was feeling the pressure of their legislative duties.  Was this  the time, therefore, for passing a measure of such a far-reaching character,  and where every clause demanded the most careful consideration and scrutiny?  Was it the right thing because he had a majority at his back  for the Minister to say that they must get this Bill through this session?  He held that this was not right.  It was not fair to those who had  the solution of the question at heart.  (Cheers.)    SIR E. H. WALTON (Port Elizabeth, Central) said he entirely supported  the amendment of the hon. member for Queen's Town.  He had a telegram  from a mass meeting of Natives held in Port Elizabeth, in which they hoped  that the House would postpone decision on this question until the Commission  had sat and reported.  That seemed to him an entirely reasonable request,  and it seemed all the more necessary that this should be done  on account of the very large alterations that it had been found necessary  to make in the Bill.    They had native protests from all parts of South Africa against this measure,  and when one saw what was proposed in this Act, they could not wonder  at these protests.  (Hear, hear.)  Therefore he put it that these protests  should receive fair consideration from members on all sides of the House.  Legislation of this kind was unfortunate from the point of view  of the Natives.  The more intelligent of the Natives in this country  were asking for time.  They said:  \"You are putting this thing upon us,  give us time to consider it.  Allow this Commission to get to work,  allow this Commission to put before us the provisions you are going to make  for us, and when this is done we will submit to anything that is fair.\"  No man, and the Native was just a man like the rest of us,  liked the old arrangements to be disturbed, because it upset him,  and the Native might oppose it, because he was frightened.  They must admit that they had not given the native leaders and chiefs  an opportunity to come down to Cape Town and give their views.  It was unfortunate that this measure had been more or less rushed.  There was no mention of it in the Governor-General's speech, and therefore  the Natives were not prepared for the consideration of the question.    MR. M. ALEXANDER (Cape Town, Castle) said he was still of opinion  that a very dangerous principle was introduced in the Bill,  especially so far as the Cape was concerned.  In the speech  delivered by the Governor-General at the opening of the session  there was not the slightest reference to the present measure,  which apparently had been brought in as an afterthought, and something  must have occurred after the Governor-General's speech was delivered,  otherwise one could not conceive of such an important Bill being omitted  from the speech.  As it was the Bill would simply hang things up  until the Commission reported, and now the House would be legislating  in the dark.  The vast majority of Natives had declared themselves  to be against the Bill.  He had had no desire whatever that party capital  should be made out of the measure -- (hear, hear) -- but he desired  to see a measure which would bear the mark of statesmanship,  and not of panic and hurry.  Their Commission could report  before next session, and then in the early stages of the session  a Bill could be introduced and be adopted on its merits.  In the interests of South Africa, in the interests of the Natives,  and in the interests of just legislation let the Government withdraw the Bill,  and appoint a Commission, and then justice and not injustice would be done.  (Hear, hear.)    DR. A. H. WATKINS (Barkly) said that there was a tacit understanding  that the Minister would refer this Bill, if he were not prepared  to accept a purely temporary measure, to a Select Committee.  During the three years of the Union Parliament every matter  practically dealing with Natives had been brought before  the Select Committee on Native Affairs and their opinion had been asked.  For some reason, which it was difficult for him to understand,  the Minister had not seen fit to carry out that course.  Sixteen days had elapsed since the second reading of this Bill was taken  on which the Select Committee could have sat morning after morning  and dealt with the Bill.    The necessity of passing only a temporary measure instead of appearing  to pass a measure which would permanently deal with this question,  was more evident to-night than when they took the second reading.    MR. H. M. MEYLER (Weenen) said that he would support  the motion of Sir Bisset Berry.  He thought it would be  a great injustice to the Natives, and especially the Natives of Natal,  who really knew nothing of this measure, to force it through now.  Since the second reading, his attention had been drawn to certain provisions  in this Bill, which made it more dangerous still to hurry legislation,  because he found that, although there was an exemption in the Bill as regarded  agreements lawfully entered into, the vast majority of the agreements  at present in force amongst the Natives of Natal were not strictly lawful,  according to their Statute law.  As they had no less than 380,000 Natives  squatting on private lands in Natal, according to the Minister's own figures,  it would be a fatal mistake to do anything to upset these people,  until they had something ready to provide for them instead.  The difficulty was that under the Natal law no oral contract was binding  for more than twelve months, and many of those squatters  had not got oral contracts, but were more or less on sufferance on the farms.  It would be a great danger to pass legislation which would lead to  the moving of a large portion of these people before they got an inch of land  provided for their use.  He objected to legislation being brought forward  too hurriedly, and when they had got 4 1/2 millions of Natives, only an  infinitesimal portion of whom could possibly know the nature of the Bill,  and seeing that it affected them as well as the white population,  they had a perfect right to have it explained to them  by the Government officials and let their members of Parliament  for the divisions in which they lived give their opinions on the question.  That would take months, and it was impossible to get a proper  opinion of the Natives until hon. members had been away from the House  for some time.  The Right Hon. the Prime Minister admitted  they should stand as the guardians of the Natives, and admitted  that they should go slowly, and he hoped the hon. Minister would be willing  to reconsider the Bill and allow it to be put off, and let them have  an interim report, at any rate, from the Commission, before "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14521"],[0,"Memories: A Story of German Love (#10)"],[1,"to step into an apartment.  I looked at her  closely to see if she suspected my real emotions, but her face was  perfectly calm, and without manifesting the slightest expression of  curiosity or wonder, she said in measured tones, the Countess was much  better to-day and would see me in half an hour.    When I heard these words, I felt like the good swimmer who has ventured  far out into the sea, and first thinks of returning when his arms have  begun to grow weary.  He cleaves the waves with haste, scarcely  venturing to cast a glance at the distant shore, feeling with every  stroke that his strength is failing and that he is making no headway,  until at last, purposeless and cramped, he scarcely has any realization  of his position; then suddenly his foot touches the firm bottom, and  his arm hugs the first rock on the shore.  A fresh reality confronted  me, and my sufferings were a dream.  There are but few such moments in  the life of man, and thousands have never known their rapture.  The  mother whose child rests in her arms for the first time, the father  whose only son returns from war covered with glory, the poet in whom  his countrymen exult, the youth whose warm grasp of the hand is  returned by the beloved being with a still warmer pressure--they know  what it means when a dream becomes a reality.    At the expiration of the half hour, a servant came and conducted me  through a long suite of rooms, opened a door, and in the fading light  of the evening I saw a white figure, and above her a high window, which  looked out upon the lake and the shimmering mountains.    \"How singularly people meet!\" she cried out in a clear voice, and every  word was like a cool rain-drop on a hot summer's day.    \"How singularly people meet, and how singularly they lose each other,\"  said I; and thereupon I seized her hand, and realized that we were  together again.    \"But people are to blame if they lose each other,\" she continued; and  her voice, which seemed always to accompany her words, like music,  involuntarily modulated into a tenderer key.    \"Yes, that is true,\" I replied; \"but first tell me, are you well, and  can I talk with you?\"    \"My dear friend,\" said she, smiling, \"you know I am always sick, and if  I say that I feel well, I do so for the sake of my old Hofrath; for he  is firmly convinced that my entire life since my first year is due to  him and his skill.  Before I left the Court-residence I caused him much  anxiety, for one evening my heart suddenly ceased beating, and I  experienced such distress that I thought it would never beat again.  But that is past, and why should we recall it?  Only one thing troubles  me, I have hitherto believed I should some time close my eyes in  perfect repose, but now I feel that my sufferings will disturb and  embitter my departure from life.\"  Then she placed her hand upon her  heart, and said: \"But tell me, where have you been, and why have I not  heard from you all this time?  The old Hofrath has given me so many  reasons for your sudden departure, that I was finally compelled to tell  him I did not believe him--and at last he gave me the most incredible  of all reasons, and counselled--what do you suppose?\"    \"He might seem untruthful,\" I interrupted, so that she should not  explain the reason, \"and yet, perhaps he was only too truthful.  But  this also is past, and why should we recall it?\"    \"No, no, my friend,\" said she, \"why call it past?  I told the Hofrath,  when he gave me the last reason for your sudden departure, that I  understood neither him nor you.  I am a poor sick, forsaken being, and  my earthly existence is only a slow death.  Now if Heaven sends me a  few souls who understand me, or love me, as the Hofrath calls it, why  then should it disturb their joy or mine?  I had been reading my  favorite poet, the old Wordsworth, when the Hofrath made his  acknowledgment, and I said: 'My dear Hofrath, we have so many thoughts  and so few words that we must express many thoughts in every word.  Now  if one who does not know us understood that our young friend loved me,  or I him, in such manner as we suppose Romeo loved Juliet and Juliet  Romeo, you would be entirely right in saying it should not be so.  But  is it not true that you love me also, my old Hofrath, and that I love  you, and have loved you for many years?  And has it not sometimes  occurred to you that I have neither been past remedy nor unhappy on  that account?  Yes, my dear Hofrath, I will tell you still more--I  believe you have an unfortunate love for me, and are jealous of our  young friend.  Do you not come every morning and inquire how I am, even  when you know I am very well?  Do you not bring me the finest flowers  from your garden?  Did you not oblige me to send you my portrait,  and--perhaps I ought not to disclose it--did you not come to my room  last Sunday and think I was asleep?  I was really sleeping--at least I  could not stir myself.  I saw you sitting at my bedside for a long  time, your eyes steadfastly fixed upon me, and I felt your glances  playing upon my face like sunbeams.  At last your eyes grew weary, and  I perceived the great tears falling from them.  You held your face in  your hands, and loudly sobbed: Marie, Marie!  Ah, my dear Hofrath, our  young friend has never done that, and yet you have sent him away.'  As  I thus talked with him, half in jest and half in earnest, as I always  speak, I perceived that I had hurt the old man's feelings.  He became  perfectly silent, and blushed like a child.  Then I took the volume of  Wordsworth's poems which I had been reading, and said: 'Here is another  old man whom I love, and love with my whole heart, who understands me,  and whom I understand, and yet I have never seen him, and shall never  see him on earth, since it is so to be.  Now I will read you one of his  poems, that you may see how one can love, and that love is a silent  benediction which the lover lays upon the head of the beloved, and then  goes on his way in rapturous sorrow.'  Then I read to him Wordsworth's  'Highland Girl;' and now, my friend, place the lamp nearer, and read  the poem to me, for it refreshes me every time I hear it.  A spirit  breathes through it like the silent, everlasting evening-red, which  stretches its arms in love and blessing over the pure breast of the  snow-covered mountains.\"    As her words thus gradually and peacefully filled my soul, it at last  grew still and solemn in my breast again; the storm was over, and her  image floated like the silvery moonlight upon the gently rippling waves  of my love--this world-sea which rolls through the hearts of all men,  and which each calls his own while it is an all-animating pulse-beat of  the whole human race.  I would most gladly have kept silent like Nature  as it lay before our view without, and ever grew stiller and darker:  But she gave me the book, and I read:        Sweet Highland Girl, a very shower    Of beauty is thy earthly dower!    Twice seven consenting years have shed    Their utmost bounty on thy head:    And these gray rocks, that household lawn,    Those trees, a veil just half withdrawn,    This fall of water that doth make    A murmur near the silent lake,    This little bay; a quiet road    That holds in shelter thy abode--    In truth, together do ye seem    Like something fashioned in a dream;    Such forms as from their covert peep    When earthly cares are laid asleep!    But, O fair creature! in the light    Of common day, so heavenly bright,    I bless thee, vision as thou art,    I bless thee with a human heart;    God shield thee to thy latest years!    Thee neither know I, nor thy peers;    And yet my eyes are filled with tears.      With earnest feeling I shall pray    For thee when I am far away;    For never saw I mien or face,    In which more plainly I could trace    Benignity and home-bred sense    Ripening in perfect innocence.    Here scattered, like a random seed,    Remote from men, thou dost not need    The embarrassed look of shy distress,    And maidenly shamefacedness:    Thou wear'st upon thy forehead clear    The freedom of a mountaineer:    A face with gladness overspread!    Soft smiles, by human kindness bred!    And seemliness complete, that sways    Thy courtesies, about thee plays;    With no restraint, but such as springs    From quick and eager visitings    Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach    Of thy few words of English speech:    A bondage sweetly brooked, a strife    That gives thy gestures grace and life!    So have I, not unmoved in mind,    Seen birds of tempest-loving kind--    Thus beating up against the wind.      What hand but would a garland cull    For thee who art so beautiful?    O happy pleasure! here to dwell    Beside thee in some heathy dell;    Adopt your homely ways and dress,    A shepherd, thou a shepherdess:    But I could frame a wish for thee    More like a grave reality:    Thou art to me but as a wave    Of the wild sea; and I would have    Some claim upon thee, if I could,    Though but of common neighborhood    What joy to hear thee, and to see!    Thy elder brother I would be,    Thy father--anything to thee!      Now thanks to heaven! that of its grace    Hath led me to this lonely place.    Joy have I had; and going hence    I bear away my recompense.    In spots like these it is we prize    Our memory, feel that she hath eyes:    Then why should I be loth to stir?    I feel this place was made for her;    To give new pleasure like the past,    Continued long as life shall last.    Nor am I loth, though pleased at heart,    Sweet Highland Girl, from thee to part;    For I, methinks, till I grow old,    As fair before me shall behold,    As I do now, the cabin small,    The lake, the bay, the waterfall,    And thee, the spirit of them all!      I had finished, and the poem had been to me like a draught of the fresh  spring-water which I had sipped so often of late as it dropped from"]]]
