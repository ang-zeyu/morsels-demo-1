This also is the object of  examinations, where teachers and pupils are alike standing their trial.  From what we learn of you, we may entertain good hopes of the young  lady, and it is to your own credit also that you have paid so much  attention to your pupil's capabilities. If in the coming year you can  develop these into accomplishments, neither yourself nor your pupil  shall fail to receive your due praise.'    \"I had made up my mind to what must follow upon all this; but there was  something worse that I had not anticipated, which had soon to be added  to it. Our good Superior, who like a trusty shepherdess could not bear  to have one of her flock lost, or, as was the case here, to see it  undistinguished, after the examiners were gone could not contain her  displeasure, and said to Ottilie, who was standing quite quietly by the  window, while the others were exulting over their prizes: 'Tell me, for  heaven's sake, how can a person look so stupid if she is not so?'  Ottilie replied, quite calmly, 'Forgive me, my dear mother, I have my  headache again today, and it is very painful.' Kind and sympathizing as  she generally is, the Superior this time answered, 'No one can believe  that,' and turned angrily away.    \"Now it is true--no one can believe it--for Ottilie never alters the  expression of her countenance. I have never even seen her move her hand  to her head when she has been asleep.    \"Nor was this all. Your ladyship's daughter, who is at all times  sufficiently lively and impetuous, after her triumph today was  overflowing with the violence of her spirits. She ran from room to room  with her prizes and testimonials, and shook them in Ottilie's face. 'You  have come badly off this morning,' she cried. Ottilie replied in her  calm, quiet way, 'This is not the last day of trial.' 'But you will  always remain the last,' cried the other, and ran away.    \"No one except myself saw that Ottilie was disturbed. She has a way when  she experiences any sharp unpleasant emotion which she wishes to resist,  of showing it in the unequal color of her face; the left cheek becomes  for a moment flushed, while the right turns pale. I perceived this  symptom, and I could not prevent myself from saying something. I took  our Superior aside, and spoke seriously to her about it. The excellent  lady acknowledged that she had been wrong. We considered the whole  affair; we talked it over at great length together, and not to weary  your ladyship, I will tell you at once the desire with which we  concluded, namely, that you will for a while have Ottilie with yourself.  Our reasons you will yourself readily perceive. If you consent, I will  say more to you on the manner in which I think she should be treated.  The young lady your daughter we may expect will soon leave us, and we  shall then with pleasure welcome Ottilie back to us.    \"One thing more, which another time I might forget to mention: I have  never seen Ottilie eager for anything, or at least ask pressingly for  anything. But there have been occasions, however rare, when on the other  hand she has wished to decline things which have been pressed upon her,  and she does it with a gesture which to those who have caught its  meaning is irresistible. She raises her hands, presses the palms  together, and draws them against her breast, leaning her body a little  forward at the same time, and turns such a look upon the person who is  urging her that he will be glad enough to cease to ask or wish for  anything of her. If your ladyship ever sees this attitude, as with your  treatment of her it is not likely that you will, think of me, and spare  Ottilie.\"    Edward read these letters aloud, not without smiles and shakes of the  head. Naturally, too, there were observations made on the persons and on  the position of the affair.    \"Enough!\" Edward cried at last, \"it is decided. She comes. You, my love,  are provided for, and now we can get forward with our work. It is  becoming highly necessary for me to move over to the right wing to the  Captain; evenings and mornings are the time for us best to work  together, and then you, on your side, will have admirable room for  yourself and Ottilie.\"    Charlotte made no objection, and Edward sketched out the method in which  they should live. Among other things, he cried, \"It is really very  polite in this niece to be subject to a slight pain on the left side of  her head. I have it frequently an the right. If we happen to be  afflicted together, and sit opposite one another--I leaning on my right  elbow, and she on her left, and our heads on the opposite sides, resting  on our hands--what a pretty pair of pictures we shall make.\"    The Captain thought that might be dangerous. \"No, no!\" cried out Edward.  \"Only do you, my dear friend, take care of the D, for what will become  of B, if poor C is taken away from it?\"    \"That, I should have thought, would have been evident enough,\" replied  Charlotte.    \"And it is, indeed,\" cried Edward; \"he would turn back to his A, to his  Alpha and Omega;\" and he sprung up and taking Charlotte in his arms,  pressed her to his breast.          CHAPTER VI      The carriage which brought Ottilie drove up to the door. Charlotte went  out to receive her. The dear girl ran to meet her, threw herself at her  feet, and embraced her knees.    \"Why such humility?\" said Charlotte, a little embarrassed, and  endeavoring to raise her from the ground.    \"It is not meant for humility,\" Ottilie answered, without moving from  the position in which she had placed herself; \"I am only thinking of the  time when I could not reach higher than to your knees, and when I had  just learnt to know how you loved me.\"    She stood up, and Charlotte embraced her warmly. She was introduced to  the gentlemen, and was at once treated with especial courtesy as a  visitor. Beauty is a welcome guest everywhere. She appeared attentive to  the conversation, without taking a part in it.    The next morning Edward said to Charlotte, \"What an agreeable,  entertaining girl she is!\"    \"Entertaining!\" answered Charlotte, with a smile; \"why, she has not  opened her lips yet!\"    \"Indeed!\" said Edward, as he seemed to bethink himself; \"that is very  strange.\"    Charlotte had to give the new-comer but a very few hints on the  management of the household. Ottilie saw rapidly all the arrangements,  and what was more, she felt them. She comprehended easily what was to be  provided for the whole party, and what for each particular member of it.  Everything was done with the utmost punctuality; she knew how to direct,  without appearing to be giving orders, and when any one had left  anything undone, she at once set it right herself.    As soon as she had found how much time she would have to spare, she  begged Charlotte to divide her hours for her, and to these she adhered  exactly. She worked at what was set before her in the way which the  Assistant had described to Charlotte. They let her alone. It was but  seldom that Charlotte interfered. Sometimes she changed her pens for  others which had been written with, to teach her to make bolder strokes  in her handwriting, but these, she found, would be soon cut sharp and  fine again.    The ladies had agreed with one another when they were alone to speak  nothing but French, and Charlotte persisted in it the more, as she found  Ottilie more ready to talk in a foreign language, when she was told it  was her duty to exercise herself in it. In this way she often said more  than she seemed to intend. Charlotte was particularly pleased with a  description, most complete, but at the same time most charming and  amiable, which she gave her one day, by accident, of the school. She  soon felt her to be a delightful companion, and before long she hoped to  find in her an attached friend.    At the same time she looked over again the more early accounts which had  been sent her of Ottilie, to refresh her recollection with the opinion  which the Superior and the Assistant had formed about her, and compare  them with her in her own person. For Charlotte was of opinion that we  cannot too quickly become acquainted with the character of those with  whom we have to live, that we may know what to expect of them; where we  may hope to do anything in the way of improvement with them, and what  we must make up our minds, once for all, to tolerate and let alone.    [Illustration: CHARLOTTE RECEIVES OTTILIE]    This examination led her to nothing new, indeed; but much which she  already knew became of greater meaning and importance. Ottilie's  moderation in eating and drinking, for instance, became a real distress  to her.    The next thing on which the ladies were employed was Ottilie's toilet.  Charlotte wished her to appear in clothes of a richer and more  _recherche_ sort, and at once the clever active girl herself cut out the  stuff which had been previously sent to her, and with a very little  assistance from others was able, in a short time, to dress herself out  most tastefully. The new fashionable dresses set off her figure. An  agreeable person, it is true, will show through all disguises; but we  always fancy it looks fresher and more graceful when its peculiarities  appear under some new drapery. And thus, from the moment of her first  appearance, she became more and more a delight to the eyes of all who  beheld her. As the emerald refreshes the sight with its beautiful hues,  and exerts, it is said, a beneficent influence on that noble sense, so  does human beauty work with far larger potency on the outward and on the  inward sense; whoever looks upon it is charmed against the breath of  evil, and feels in harmony with himself and with the world.    In many ways, therefore, the party had gained by Ottilie's arrival. The  Captain and Edward kept regularly to the hours,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11367"],[0,"A History of China (#10)"],[1,"states into genuine territorial states, they came into conflict with  each other. In the course of these struggles for power many of the small  fiefs were simply destroyed. It may fairly be said that not until the  eighth and seventh centuries B.C. did the old garrison towns became real  states. In these circumstances the struggles between the feudal states  called urgently for an arbiter, to settle simple cases, and in more  difficult cases either to try to induce other feudal lords to intervene  or to give sanction to the new situation. These were the only governing  functions of the ruler from the time of the transfer to the second  capital.    5 _Changes in the relative strength of the feudal states_    In these disturbed times China also made changes in her outer frontiers.  When we speak of frontiers in this connection, we must take little  account of the European conception of a frontier. No frontier in that  sense existed in China until her conflict with the European powers. In  the dogma of the Chinese religion of Heaven, all the countries of the  world were subject to the Chinese emperor, the Son of Heaven. Thus there  could be no such thing as other independent states. In practice the  dependence of various regions on the ruler naturally varied: near the  centre, that is to say near the ruler's place of residence, it was most  pronounced; then it gradually diminished in the direction of the  periphery. The feudal lords of the inner territories were already rather  less subordinated than at the centre, and those at a greater distance  scarcely at all; at a still greater distance were territories whose  chieftains regarded themselves as independent, subject only in certain  respects to Chinese overlordship. In such a system it is difficult to  speak of frontiers. In practice there was, of course, a sort of  frontier, where the influence of the outer feudal lords ceased to exist.  The development of the original feudal towns into feudal states with  actual dominion over their territories proceeded, of course, not only in  the interior of China but also on its borders, where the feudal  territories had the advantage of more unrestricted opportunities of  expansion; thus they became more and more powerful. In the south (that  is to say, in the south of the Chou empire, in the present central  China) the garrisons that founded feudal states were relatively small  and widely separated; consequently their cultural system was largely  absorbed into that of the aboriginal population, so that they developed  into feudal states with a character of their own. Three of these  attained special importance--(1) Ch'u, in the neighbourhood of the  present Chungking and Hankow; (2) Wu, near the present Nanking; and (3)  Yueeh, near the present Hangchow. In 704 B.C. the feudal prince of Wu  proclaimed himself \"Wang\". \"Wang\", however was the title of the ruler of  the Chou dynasty. This meant that Wu broke away from the old Chou  religion of Heaven, according to which there could be only one ruler  (_wang_) in the world.    At the beginning of the seventh century it became customary for the  ruler to unite with the feudal lord who was most powerful at the time.  This feudal lord became a dictator, and had the military power in his  hands, like the shoguns in nineteenth-century Japan. If there was a  disturbance of the peace, he settled the matter by military means. The  first of these dictators was the feudal lord of the state of Ch'i, in  the present province of Shantung. This feudal state had grown  considerably through the conquest of the outer end of the peninsula of  Shantung, which until then had been independent. Moreover, and this was  of the utmost importance, the state of Ch'i was a trade centre. Much of  the bronze, and later all the iron, for use in northern China came from  the south by road and in ships that went up the rivers to Ch'i, where it  was distributed among the various regions of the north, north-east, and  north-west. In addition to this, through its command of portions of the  coast, Ch'i had the means of producing salt, with which it met the needs  of great areas of eastern China. It was also in Ch'i that money was  first used. Thus Ch'i soon became a place of great luxury, far  surpassing the court of the Chou, and Ch'i also became the centre of the  most developed civilization.    [Illustration: Map 2: The principal feudal States in the feudal epoch.  (_roughly 722-481 B.C._)]    After the feudal lord of Ch'i, supported by the wealth and power of his  feudal state, became dictator, he had to struggle not only against other  feudal lords, but also many times against risings among the most various  parts of the population, and especially against the nomad tribes in the  southern part of the present province of Shansi. In the seventh century  not only Ch'i but the other feudal states had expanded. The regions in  which the nomad tribes were able to move had grown steadily smaller, and  the feudal lords now set to work to bring the nomads of their country  under their direct rule. The greatest conflict of this period was the  attack in 660 B.C. against the feudal state of Wei, in northern Honan.  The nomad tribes seem this time to have been proto-Mongols; they made a  direct attack on the garrison town and actually conquered it. The  remnant of the urban population, no more than 730 in number, had to flee  southward. It is clear from this incident that nomads were still living  in the middle of China, within the territory of the feudal states, and  that they were still decidedly strong, though no longer in a position to  get rid entirely of the feudal lords of the Chou.    The period of the dictators came to an end after about a century,  because it was found that none of the feudal states was any longer  strong enough to exercise control over all the others. These others  formed alliances against which the dictator was powerless. Thus this  period passed into the next, which the Chinese call the period of the  Contending States.    6 _Confucius_    After this survey of the political history we must consider the  intellectual history of this period, for between 550 and 280 B.C. the  enduring fundamental influences in the Chinese social order and in the  whole intellectual life of China had their original. We saw how the  priests of the earlier dynasty of the Shang developed into the group of  so-called \"scholars\". When the Chou ruler, after the move to the second  capital, had lost virtually all but his religious authority, these  \"scholars\" gained increased influence. They were the specialists in  traditional morals, in sacrifices, and in the organization of festivals.  The continually increasing ritualism at the court of the Chou called for  more and more of these men. The various feudal lords also attracted  these scholars to their side, employed them as tutors for their  children, and entrusted them with the conduct of sacrifices and  festivals.    China's best-known philosopher, Confucius (Chinese: K'ung Tz[)u], was  one of these scholars. He was born in 551 B.C. in the feudal state Lu in  the present province of Shantung. In Lu and its neighbouring state Sung,  institutions of the Shang had remained strong; both states regarded  themselves as legitimate heirs of Shang culture, and many traces of  Shang culture can be seen in Confucius's political and ethical ideas. He  acquired the knowledge which a scholar had to possess, and then taught  in the families of nobles, also helping in the administration of their  properties. He made several attempts to obtain advancement, either in  vain or with only a short term of employment ending in dismissal. Thus  his career was a continuing pilgrimage from one noble to another, from  one feudal lord to another, accompanied by a few young men, sons of  scholars, who were partly his pupils and partly his servants. Many of  these disciples seem to have been \"illegitimate\" sons of noblemen, i.e.  sons of concubines, and Confucius's own family seems to have been of the  same origin. In the strongly patriarchal and patrilinear system of the  Chou and the developing primogeniture, children of secondary wives had a  lower social status. Ultimately Confucius gave up his wanderings,  settled in his home town of Lu, and there taught his disciples until his  death in 479 B.C.    Such was briefly the life of Confucius. His enemies claim that he was a  political intriguer, inciting the feudal lords against each other in the  course of his wanderings from one state to another, with the intention  of somewhere coming into power himself. There may, indeed, be some truth  in that.    Confucius's importance lies in the fact that he systematized a body of  ideas, not of his own creation, and communicated it to a circle of  disciples. His teachings were later set down in writing and formed,  right down to the twentieth century, the moral code of the upper classes  of China. Confucius was fully conscious of his membership of a social  class whose existence was tied to that of the feudal lords. With their  disappearance, his type of scholar would become superfluous. The common  people, the lower class, was in his view in an entirely subordinate  position. Thus his moral teaching is a code for the ruling class.  Accordingly it retains almost unaltered the elements of the old cult of  Heaven, following the old tradition inherited from the northern peoples.  For him Heaven is not an arbitrarily governing divine tyrant, but the  embodiment of a system of legality. Heaven does not act independently,  but follows a universal law, the so-called \"Tao\". Just as sun, moon, and  stars move in the heavens in accordance with law, so man should conduct  himself on earth in accord with the universal law, not against it. The  ruler should not actively intervene in day-to-day policy, but should  only act by setting an example, like Heaven; he should observe the  established ceremonies,"]]]
