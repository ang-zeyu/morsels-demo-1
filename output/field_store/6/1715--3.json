You would expect there to be  discussion at the table upon questions of philosophy and aesthetics....  It is not so. When I ask him questions it is often that they are not  seriously answered. Sometimes it is as if he did not like the questions  I askt of him. Yesterday I askt of him did he agree or did he not agree  with Mr. Bernard Shaw. He just said--I wrote it down in my memoranda--he  said: 'Oh! Mixt Pickles.' What can one understand of that?--Mixt  Pickles!\"...    The young man's sedulous blue eyes looked out of his pink face through  his glasses at Mr. Direck, anxious for any light he could offer upon the  atmospheric vagueness of this England.    He was, he explained, a student of philology preparing for his  doctorate. He had not yet done his year of military service. He was  studying the dialects of East Anglia--    \"You go about among the people?\" Mr. Direck inquired.    \"No, I do not do that. But I ask Mr. Carmine and Mrs. Britling and the  boys many questions. And sometimes I talk to the gardener.\"    He explained how he would prepare his thesis and how it would be  accepted, and the nature of his army service and the various stages by  which he would subsequently ascend in the orderly professorial life to  which he was destined. He confessed a certain lack of interest in  philology, but, he said, \"it is what I have to do.\" And so he was going  to do it all his life through. For his own part he was interested in  ideas of universal citizenship, in Esperanto and Ido and universal  languages and such-like attacks upon the barriers between man and man.  But the authorities at home did not favour cosmopolitan ideas, and so he  was relinquishing them. \"Here, it is as if there were no authorities,\"  he said with a touch of envy.    Mr. Direck induced him to expand that idea.    Herr Heinrich made Mr. Britling his instance. If Mr. Britling were a  German he would certainly have some sort of title, a definite position,  responsibility. Here he was not even called Herr Doktor. He said what he  liked. Nobody rewarded him; nobody reprimanded him. When Herr Heinrich  asked him of his position, whether he was above or below Mr. Bernard  Shaw or Mr. Arnold White or Mr. Garvin or any other publicist, he made  jokes. Nobody here seemed to have a title and nobody seemed to have a  definite place. There was Mr. Lawrence Carmine; he was a student of  Oriental questions; he had to do with some public institution in London  that welcomed Indian students; he was a Geheimrath--    \"Eh?\" said Mr. Direck.    \"It is--what do they call it? the Essex County Council.\" But nobody took  any notice of that. And when Mr. Philbert, who was a minister in the  government, came to lunch he was just like any one else. It was only  after he had gone that Herr Heinrich had learnt by chance that he was a  minister and \"Right Honourable....\"    \"In Germany everything is definite. Every man knows his place, has his  papers, is instructed what to do....\"    \"Yet,\" said Mr. Direck, with his eyes on the glowing roses, the neat  arbour, the long line of the red wall of the vegetable garden and a  distant gleam of cornfield, \"it all looks orderly enough.\"    \"It is as if it had been put in order ages ago,\" said Herr Heinrich.    \"And was just going on by habit,\" said Mr. Direck, taking up the idea.    Their comparisons were interrupted by the appearance of \"Teddy,\" the  secretary, and the Indian young gentleman, damp and genial, as they  explained, \"from the boats.\" It seemed that \"down below\" somewhere was a  pond with a punt and an island and a toy dinghy. And while they  discussed swimming and boating, Mr. Carmine appeared from the direction  of the park conversing gravely with the elder son. They had been for a  walk and a talk together. There were proposals for a Badminton foursome.  Mr. Direck emerged from the general interchange with Mr. Lawrence  Carmine, and then strolled through the rose garden to see the sunset  from the end. Mr. Direck took the opportunity to verify his impression  that the elder son was the present Mrs. Britling's stepson, and he also  contrived by a sudden admiration for a distant row of evening primroses  to deflect their path past the arbour in which the evening light must  now be getting a little too soft for Miss Corner's book.    Miss Corner was drawn into the sunset party. She talked to Mr. Carmine  and displayed, Mr. Direck thought, great originality of mind. She said  \"The City of the Sun\" was like the cities the boys sometimes made on the  playroom floor. She said it was the dearest little city, and gave some  amusing particulars. She described the painted walls that made the tour  of the Civitas Solis a liberal education. She asked Mr. Carmine, who was  an authority on Oriental literature, why there were no Indian nor  Chinese Utopias.    Now it had never occurred to Mr. Direck to ask why there were no Indian  nor Chinese Utopias, and even Mr. Carmine seemed surprised to discover  this deficiency.    \"The primitive patriarchal village _is_ Utopia to India and China,\" said  Mr. Carmine, when they had a little digested the inquiry. \"Or at any  rate it is their social ideal. They want no Utopias.\"    \"Utopias came with cities,\" he said, considering the question. \"And the  first cities, as distinguished from courts and autocratic capitals, came  with ships. India and China belong to an earlier age. Ships, trade,  disorder, strange relationships, unofficial literature, criticism--and  then this idea of some novel remaking of society....\"      Section 8    Then Mr. Direck fell into the hands of Hugh, the eldest son, and  anticipating the inevitable, said that he liked to walk in the rose  garden. So they walked in the rose garden.    \"Do you read Utopias?\" said Mr. Direck, cutting any preface, in the  English manner.    \"Oh, _rather_!\" said Hugh, and became at once friendly and confidential.    \"We all do,\" he explained. \"In England everybody talks of change and  nothing ever changes.\"    \"I found Miss Corner reading--what was it? the Sun People?--some old  classical Italian work.\"    \"Campanella,\" said Hugh, without betraying the slightest interest in  Miss Corner. \"Nothing changes in England, because the people who want to  change things change their minds before they change anything else. I've  been in London talking for the last half-year. Studying art they call  it. Before that I was a science student, and I want to be one again.  Don't you think, Sir, there's something about science--it's steadier  than anything else in the world?\"    Mr. Direck thought that the moral truths of human nature were steadier  than science, and they had one of those little discussions of real life  that begin about a difference inadequately apprehended, and do not so  much end as are abandoned. Hugh struck him as being more speculative and  detached than any American college youth of his age that he knew--but  that might not be a national difference but only the Britling strain. He  seemed to have read more and more independently, and to be doing less.  And he was rather more restrained and self-possessed.    Before Mr. Direck could begin a proper inquiry into the young man's work  and outlook, he had got the conversation upon America. He wanted  tremendously to see America. \"The dad says in one of his books that over  here we are being and that over there you are beginning. It must be  tremendously stimulating to think that your country is still being  made....\"    Mr. Direck thought that an interesting point of view. \"Unless something  tumbles down here, we never think of altering it,\" the young man  remarked. \"And even then we just shore it up.\"    His remarks had the effect of floating off from some busy mill of  thought within him. Hitherto Mr. Direck had been inclined to think this  silent observant youth, with his hands in his pockets and his shoulders  a little humped, as probably shy and adolescently ineffective. But the  head was manifestly quite busy....    \"Miss Corner,\" he began, taking the first thing that came into his head,  and then he remembered that he had already made the remark he was going  to make not five minutes ago.    \"What form of art,\" he asked, \"are you contemplating in your studies at  the present time in London?\"....    Before this question could be dealt with at all adequately, the two  small boys became active in the garden beating in everybody to  \"dress-up\" before supper. The secretary, Teddy, came in a fatherly way  to look after Mr. Direck and see to his draperies.      Section 9    Mr. Direck gave his very best attention to this business of draping  himself, for he had not the slightest intention of appearing ridiculous  in the eyes of Miss Corner. Teddy came with an armful of stuff that he  thought \"might do.\"    \"What'll I come as?\" asked Mr. Direck.    \"We don't wear costumes,\" said Teddy. \"We just put on all the brightest  things we fancy. If it's any costume at all, it's Futurist.\"    \"And surely why shouldn't one?\" asked Mr. Direck, greatly struck by this  idea. \"Why should we always be tied by the fashions and periods of the  past?\"    He rejected a rather Mephistopheles-like costume of crimson and a scheme  for a brigand-like ensemble based upon what was evidently an old bolero  of Mrs. Britling's, and after some reflection he accepted some black  silk tights. His legs were not legs to be ashamed of. Over this he tried  various brilliant wrappings from the Dower House _armoire_, and chose at  last, after some hesitation in the direction of a piece of gold and  purple brocade, a big square of green silk curtain stuff adorned with  golden pheasants and other large and dignified ornaments; this he wore  toga fashion over his light silken under-vest--Teddy had insisted on the  abandonment of his shirt \"if you want to dance at all\"--and fastened  with a large green glass-jewelled "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14070"],[0,"English Grammar in Familiar Lectures (#10)"],[1,"divides words into ten sorts. To attempt to prove, in  this place, that nothing would be gained by adopting either a less or a  greater number of the parts of speech, would be anticipating the  subject. I shall, therefore, give my reasons for adopting this  arrangement in preference to any other, as the different sorts of words  are respectively presented to you, for then you will be better prepared  to appreciate my arguments.      OF NOUNS.    A noun is the name of any person, place, or thing; as, _man, Charleston,  knowledge_.    Nouns are often improperly called _substantives_. A substantive is the  name of a _substance_ only; but a noun is the name either of a  _substance_ or a _quality_.    _Noun_, derived from the Latin word _nomen_, signifies _name_. The name  of any thing [1] that exists, whether animate or inanimate, or  which we can see, hear, feel, taste, smell, or think of, is a noun.  _Animal, bird, creature, paper, pen, apple, fold, house, modesty,  virtue, danger_, are all nouns. In order that you may easily distinguish  this part of speech from others, I will give you a _sign_, which will be  useful to you when you cannot tell it by the _sense_. Any word that will  make sense with _the_ before it, is a noun. Try the following words by  this sign, and see if they are nouns: tree, mountain, soul, mind,  conscience, understanding. _The_ tree, _the_ mountain, _the_ soul, and  so on. You perceive, that they will make sense with _the_ prefixed;  therefore you know they are _nouns_. There are, however, exceptions to  this rule, for some nouns will not make sense with _the_ prefixed. These  you will be able to distinguish, if you exercise your mind, by their  _making sense of themselves_; as, _goodness, sobriety, hope,  immortality_.        [1] The word _thing_, from the Saxon verb _thingian_, to think, is      almost unlimited in its meaning. It may be applied to every animal      and creature in the universe. By the term creature, I mean that      which has been created; as, a dog, water, dirt. This word is also      frequently applied to actions; as, \"To get drunk is a beastly      _thing_.\" In this phrase, it signifies neither animal nor creature;      but it denotes merely an action; therefore this action is the thing.    Nouns are used to denote the nonentity or absence of a thing, as well as  its reality; as, _nothing, naught, vacancy, non-existence,  invisibility_.    Nouns are sometimes used as verbs, and verbs, as nouns, according to  their _manner_ of meaning; and nouns are sometimes used as adjectives,  and adjectives, as nouns. This matter will be explained in the  concluding part of this lecture, where you will be better prepared to  comprehend it.    NOUNS are of two kinds, common and proper.    A _Common noun_ is the name of a sort or species of things; as, _man,  tree, river_.    A _Proper noun_ is the name of an individual; as, _Charles, Ithaca,  Ganges_.    A noun signifying many, is called a _collective noun_, or _noun of  multitude_; as, the _people_, the _army_.    The distinction between a common and a proper noun, is very obvious. For  example: _boy_ is a common noun, because it is a name applied to _all_  boys; but _Charles_ is a proper noun, because it is the name of an  _individual_ boy. Although many boys may have the same name, yet you  know it is not a common noun, for the name Charles is _not_ given to all  boys. _Mississippi_ is a proper noun, because it is the name of an  individual river; but _river_ is a common noun, because it is the name  of a _species_ of things, and the name _river_ is common to _all_  rivers.    Nouns which denote the genus, species, or variety of beings or things,  are always common; as, _tree_, the genus; _oak, ash, chestnut, poplar_,  different species; and red _oak_, white _oak_, black _oak_, varieties.  The word earth, when it signifies a kind or quantity of dirt, is a  common noun; but when it denotes the planet we inhabit, it is a proper  noun. The _words_ person, place, river, mountain, lake, &c. are _common  nouns_, because they are the names of whole _species_, or classes of  things containing many sorts; but the _names_ of persons, places,  rivers, mountains, lakes, &c. are _proper nouns_, because they denote  _individuals_; as, Augustus, Baltimore, Alps, Huron.    _Physician, lawyer, merchant_, and _shoemaker_, are common nouns,  because these names are common to classes of men. _God_ and _Lord_, when  applied to Jehovah or Jesus Christ, are proper; but when employed to  denote heathen or false _gods_, or temporal _lords_, they are common.  The Notes and remarks throughout the work, though of minor importance,  demand your attentive and careful perusal.        NOTES.        1. When _proper_ nouns have an article annexed to them, they are      used after the manner of _common_ nouns; as, \"Bolivar is styled      _the_ Washington of South America.\"        2. _Common_ nouns are sometimes used to signify _individuals_, when      articles or pronouns are prefixed to them; as, \"_The_ boy is      studious; _That_ girl is discreet.\" In such instances, they are      nearly equivalent to proper nouns.        3. _Common_ nouns are sometimes subdivided into the following      classes: _Nouns of Multitude_; as, The people, the parliament:      _Verbal or participial nouns_; as, The beginning, reading, writing;      and _Abstract nouns_, or the names of qualities abstracted from      their substances; as, knowledge, virtue, goodness. Lest the student      be led to blend the idea of abstract nouns with that of adjectives,      both of which denote qualities, a farther illustration appears to be      necessary, in order to mark the distinction between these two parts      of speech. An abstract noun denotes a quality considered _apart_      (that is, abstracted) _from_ the substance or being to which it      belongs; but an adjective denotes a quality _joined_ (adjected) _to_      the substance or being to which it belongs. Thus, _whiteness_ and      _white_ both denote the same quality; but we speak of whiteness as a      distinct object of thought, while we use the word _white_ always in      reference to the noun to which it belongs; as, _white_ paper,      _white_ mouse.        4. Some authors have proceeded to still more minute divisions and      sub-divisions of nouns; such, for example, as the following, which      appear to be more complex than useful: _Natural nouns_, or names of      things formed by nature; as, man, beast, water, air: 2. _Artificial      nouns_, or names of things formed by art; as, book, vessel, house:      3. _Personal nouns_, or those which stand for human beings; as, man,      woman, Edwin: 4. _Neuter nouns_, or those which denote things      inanimate; as, book, field, mountain, Cincinnati. The following,      however, is quite a rational division: _Material nouns_ are the      names of things formed of matter; as, stone, book: _Immaterial      nouns_ are the names of things having no substance; as, hope,      immortality.    To nouns belong gender, person, number, and case.    GENDER.    GENDER is the distinction of sex. Nouns have three genders, the  masculine, the feminine, and the neuter.    The _masculine gender_ denotes males; as, a _man_, a _boy_.    The _feminine gender_ denotes females; as, a _woman_, a _girl_.    The _neuter gender_ denotes things without sex; as, a _hat_, a _stick_.    _Neuter_ means _neither:_ therefore neuter gender signifies neither  gender; that is, neither masculine nor feminine. Hence, neuter gender  means _no gender_. Strictly speaking, then, as there are but two sexes,  nouns have but _two_ genders; but for the sake of practical convenience,  we apply to them three genders, by calling that a gender which is _no_  gender. The English and the pure Persian, appear to be the only  languages which observe, in the distinction of sex, the natural division  of nouns.--The genders of nouns are so easily known, that a farther  explanation of them is unnecessary, except what is given in the  following        NOTES.        1. The same noun is sometimes masculine _and_ feminine, and      sometimes masculine _or_ feminine. The noun _parents_ is of the      masculine _and_ feminine gender. The nouns _parent, associate,      neighbor, servant, friend, child, bird, fish, &c._ if doubtful, are      of the masculine _or_ feminine gender.        2. Some nouns naturally neuter, are, when used figuratively, or      _personified_, converted into the masculine or feminine gender.      Those nouns are generally rendered masculine, which are conspicuous      for the attributes of imparting or communicating, and which are by      nature strong and efficacious; as, the _sun, time, death, sleep,      winter, &c._ Those, again, are generally feminine, which are      conspicuous for the attributes of containing or bringing forth, or      which are very beautiful, mild, or amiable; as, the _earth, moon,      church, boat, vessel, city, country, nature, ship, soul, fortune,      virtue, hope, spring, peace, &c._ This principle for designating the      sex of a personified object, which is quite rational, is generally      adhered to in the English language; but, in some instances, the poet      applies the sex according to his fancy.        The masculine and feminine genders are distinguished in three ways:            1. _By different words_; as,          _Masculine_.      _Feminine_.
