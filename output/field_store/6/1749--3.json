[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14760"],[0,"Report of the Special Committee on Moral Delinquency in Children and Adolescents (#10)"],[1,"assumed by schools, libraries, clubs,    and many other organizations has not made parents less heedful of    their own personal responsibilities for the training of their    children.      While the Committee realizes that the care shown by some parents    for their children has proved to be inadequate, there are many    parents who are examples of what parents ought to be. Above all,    the Committee wishes to stress that parents should not suffer from    feelings of inadequacy owing to a spate of modern knowledge often    expressed in semi-technical terms. Parents should enjoy their    children, and this enjoyment will lead to increasing co-operation    within the family.      =(2) Absent Mothers and Fathers=    Many persons have expressed the opinion that sexual immorality among  young people arises, in part, from the fact that mothers are frequently  absent from their homes at times when their children need their care and  guidance.    Mothers who leave children to their own devices are in three categories:      (_a_) Nearly one-third of the delinquent children whose cases were    considered by the Committee belonged to homes where the mother    worked for wages. Another survey showed that, in a closely    populated area, 25 per cent of the mothers of pupils of a    post-primary school went out to work. Some mothers may need to    work; but many of them work in order to provide a higher standard    of living than can be enjoyed on the wages earned by their    husbands, or because they prefer the company at an office, shop,    or factory to the routine of domestic duties.      (_b_) The second category comprises those wives and mothers who    extend their social, and even their public, activities beyond the    hour at which they should be home to welcome their children on    return from school. Happy and desirable is the home where the    children burst in expectantly or full of news concerning something    that interests them!      (_c_) The third category of absentee mothers consists of those who    give their children money to go to the pictures, while they    themselves go to golf, or to a football match, or pay a visit to    friends.    When dealing with this kind of thoughtlessness it should be pointed out  that fathers are not free from blame. As breadwinners they have  necessarily to be away from home throughout the day, but they have  opportunities in the evenings and at week-ends to identify themselves  with their children's interests and activities.    A satisfactory home life can be attained only by the co-operation of  both parents in the upbringing of their children.      =(3) High Wages=    In striking contrast to the contention that the cost of living is so  high that mothers are obliged to work is the complaint that many young  people have too much money. This applies both to school children and to  boys and girls who have commenced working.    It cannot be denied that many children have too much spending money, and  that others show too great a desire to have it.    It is also a well-known fact that many children are not content to do  normal tasks at home when they are able to obtain good pocket money by  doing odd jobs for others.    The starting wage for adolescents is often somewhat high, and thrift is  not practised by them. A few years hence, these adolescents may be in  the ranks of those who complain of their inability to obtain homes. This  has prompted people to urge that a compulsory savings scheme should be  instituted to guard young people from the evils of misspent leisure and  to develop in them that sense of reliability which is so often lacking.    There is certainly something wrong when mothers work to increase the  income of the household while youths, who may be paid nearly as much as  parents with family responsibilities, spend their earnings on expensive  luxuries.    If juvenile delinquents were admitted to probation instead of being  admonished or placed under supervision, it might be practicable for the  Courts, in suitable cases to make it a condition of probation that the  offender paid a portion of his earnings into a compulsory savings  scheme. Even if such a procedure could be devised it would apply only to  those who have become delinquents when the major consideration should be  given to the problem of the pre-delinquents. This is a matter to be  considered further in Section XVI of this report.          _XI. Information on Sex Matters_    For many years the expression \"sex instruction\" has been used and  understood by most people. The Committee makes clear its appreciation of  the fact that the term is inadequate as not indicating that the sexual  relations of man and woman should be a harmonious blend of the physical  and the spiritual. Many parents of children will agree that they  themselves obtained only a knowledge of the mechanical aspects of sex  from school companions. Even this information was often gleaned from  undesirable conversations. Such parents wish that their children should  receive this knowledge in a totally different fashion.    The terms \"sex instruction\" and \"sex knowledge\" are employed here for  other terms are not yet in common usage.    In some of the cases investigated by the police the children concerned  appear to have been very ignorant of the rudimentary facts of the  subject. In other cases they showed knowledge far in advance of what  would be expected. This advanced knowledge was, however, only in respect  of isolated portions of the subject.    The striking contrast between ignorant and precocious children confirms  the view that a statement is required as to when the information should  be given, who should give it, and what should be its source.      =(1) When Should This Information be Given?=    The best time to give any information is when a child asks a question.  The simple answer giving no more than is necessary is the desirable one.  The question \"Mummy, where do babies come from\"? should not involve a  dissertation on sex. If this method of approach is clearly understood,  the parent need never be worried about the time to impart information.      =(2) Who Should Give This Information?=    As children show varying degrees of curiosity concerning the subject at  varying ages, the initial information should not be given as part of  school instruction, but should come from a parent or parent-substitute.    Since parents are obviously those best suited for imparting this  knowledge, why do they so frequently fail to carry out this duty--a  failure that is not restricted to any intellectual or economic group?    First, there is a sense of guilt in parents concerning sexual relations,  born out of their own unfortunate initiation into a knowledge of a  subject discussion of which was generally frowned upon in their young  days.    Secondly, there is a real difficulty. As the sex organs are also the  channels for the elimination of waste, exaggerated modesty often hinders  discussion.    Thirdly, there is often a genuine ignorance on the part of parents  concerning what to say in answer to the natural questions of a child and  what terms to use in reply--terms that will be neither embarrassing to  the parent nor unintelligible to the child.    Fourthly, many parents are not convinced of the necessity for any  special action by them. They feel that, as the child grows, it will  assimilate this knowledge, but they do not give consideration to the  source from which the knowledge may be obtained, or the manner in which  it will be imparted.      =(3)The Source of Information=    There is a need for reliable sources of knowledge for the parents.  Suitable literature with a matter-of-fact approach that may yet include  the spiritual factor will remove self consciousness. An indirect  approach is not helpful. Specimen conversations between parent and child  can be readily adapted for any family.    Not all available literature on this subject is of equal quality.  Several religious organizations already have publications suitable for  the members of their respective denominations. The Committee is also  informed that the Federation of Parent-Teacher and Home and School  Associations, in conjunction with several experts, is now in the course  of publishing pamphlets suited to different age groups.    The barrier between parent and child can be lifted by meetings where  talks are given and films shown. Heads of schools, in conjunction with  Parent-Teachers' Associations could invite, on separate occasions,  mothers with their daughters, fathers with their sons, or both parents  together. The special value of such gatherings would be to enable those  with adolescent children to do what they regret having avoided doing in  earlier years.    It will be argued that, whatever is done to help parents, there will  still be a proportion likely to baulk at giving the information. Some  may even remain indifferent. There could be no objection to some  unaccompanied girls or boys attending the meetings for parents and  children. The Committee states its views on sex instruction in schools  elsewhere in the report. It is stressed here that sex instruction given  in the absence of the parents may well increase the number of parents  who neglect what should be a jealously guarded privilege.    In conclusion, parents should remember that, even though adolescents may  appear to possess a great deal of knowledge, it may be factually  inaccurate and, above all, may require putting into correct perspective.  This applies particularly to the older adolescents who have been  involved in criminal charges. That group may have practical experience  of the mechanics of sex; what they require is a more wholesome outlook  on the intimate relations of man and woman.          _XII. The Influence of Religion on Morality_    A common element in many of the statements made to the Committee is a  desire for a better spiritual basis in our society on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14766"],[0,"McGuffey's Third Eclectic Reader (#10)"],[1," in every clime,  Our Father and our Friend.\"         128  ECLECTIC SERIES.    LESSON XLIX.  DEEDS OF KINDNESS.  1. One day, as two little boys were walking along the  road, they overtook a woman carrying a large basket of  apples.  2. The boys thought the woman looked very pale and  tired; so they said, \"Are you going to town? If you are, we  will carry your basket.\"  3. \"Thank you,\" replied the woman, \"you are very kind:  you see I am weak and ill.\" Then she told them that she was  a widow, and had a lame son to support.  4. She lived in a cottage three miles away, and was now  going to market to sell the apples which grew on the only  tree in her little garden. She wanted the money to pay her  rent.  5. \"We are going the same way you are,\" said the boys.  \"Let us have the basket;\" and they took hold of it, one on  each side, and trudged along with merry hearts.  6. The poor widow looked glad, and said that she hoped  their mother would not be angry with them. \"Oh, no,\" they  replied;     THIRD READER.  129  \"our mother has taught us to be kind to everybody, and to be  useful in any way that we can.\"  7. She then offered to give them a few of  the ripest apples  for their trouble. \"No,    thank you,\" said they; \"we do not want any pay for what we  have done.\"  8. When the widow got home, she told her lame son what  had happened on the road,  3. 9.     130  ECLECTIC SERIES.  and they were both made happier that day by the kindness of  the two boys.  9. The other day, I saw a little girl stop and pick up a piece  of orange peel, which she threw into the gutter. \"I wish the  boys would not throw orange peel on the sidewalk,\" said she.  \"Some one may tread upon it, and fall.\"  10. \"That is right, my dear,\" I said. \"It is a little thing for  you to do what you have done, but it shows that you have a  thoughtful mind and a feeling heart.\"  11. Perhaps some may say that these are little things. So  they are; but we must not wait for occasions to do great  things. We must begin with little labors of love.      LESSON L.  THE ALARM CLOCK.  1. A lady, who found it not easy to wake in the morning as  early as she wished,     THIRD READER.  131  bought an alarm clock. These clocks are so made as to strike  with a loud whirring noise at any hour the owner pleases to  set them.  2. The lady placed her clock at the head of the bed, and at  the right time she found herself roused by the long, rattling  sound.  3. She arose at once, and felt better all day for her early  rising. This lasted for some weeks. The alarm clock  faithfully did its duty, and was plainly heard so long as it  was obeyed.  4. But, after a time, the lady grew tired of early rising.  When she was waked by the noise, she merely turned over in  bed, and slept again.  5. In a few days, the clock ceased to rouse her from her  sleep. It spoke just as loudly as ever; but she did not hear it,  because she had been in the habit of not obeying it.  6. Finding that she might as well be without it, she  resolved that when she heard the sound she would jump up.  7. Just so it is with conscience. If we will obey its voice,  even in the most trifling things, we can always hear it, clear  and strong.     132  ECLECTIC SERIES.  8. But if we allow ourselves to do what we have some  fears may not be quite right, we shall grow more and more  sleepy, until the voice of conscience has no longer power to  wake as.

The little birds fly over,  And oh, how sweet they sing!  To tell the happy children  That once again  't is Spring.     THIRD READER.  133    3. The gay green grass comes creeping  So soft beneath their feet;  The frogs begin to ripple  A music clear and sweet.    4. And buttercups are coming,  And scarlet columbine,  And in the sunny meadows  The dandelions shine.    5. And just as many daisies  As their soft hands can hold,  The little ones may gather,  All fair in white and gold.    6. Here blows the warm red clover,  There peeps the violet blue;  Oh, happy little children!  God made them all for you.  Celia Thaxter.              134  ECLECTIC SERIES.    LESSON LII.  TRUE COURAGE.  One cold winter's day, three boys were passing by a  schoolhouse. The oldest was a bad boy. always in trouble  himself, and trying to get others into trouble. The youngest,  whose name was George, was a very good boy.  George wished to do right, but was very much wanting in  courage. The other boys were named Henry and James. As  they walked along, they talked as follows:  Henry. What fun it would be to throw a snowball against  the schoolroom door, and make the teacher and scholars all  jump!  James. You would jump, if you should. If the teacher did  not catch you and whip you, he would tell your father, and  you would get a whipping then; and that would make you  jump higher than the scholars, I think.  Henry. Why, we would get so far off, before the teacher  could come to the door, that he could not tell who we are.  Here is a snowball just as hard as ice, and George     THIRD READER.  135  would as soon throw it against the door as not.  James. Give it to him, and see. He would not dare to  throw it.  Henry. Do you think George is a coward? You do not  know him as well as I do.    Here, George, take this snowball, and show James that you  are not such a coward as he thinks you are.  George. I am not afraid to throw it; but I do not want to. I  do not see that it     136  ECLECTIC SERIES.  will do any good, or that there will be any fun in it.  James. There! I told you he would not dare to throw it.  Henry. Why, George, are you turning coward? I thought  you did not fear anything. Come, save your credit, and throw  it. I know you are not afraid.  George. Well, I am not afraid to throw. Give me the  snowball. I would as soon throw it as not.  Whack! went the snowball against the door; and the boys  took to their heels. Henry was laughing as heartily as he  could, to think what a fool he had made of George.  George had a whipping for his folly, as he ought to have  had. He was such a coward, that he was afraid of being  called a coward. He did not dare refuse to do as Henry told  him, for fear that he would be laughed at.  If he had been really a brave boy, he would have said,  \"Henry, do you suppose that I am so foolish as to throw that  snowball, just because you want to have me? You may throw  your own snowballs, if you please!\"     THIRD READER.  137  Henry would, perhaps, have laughed at him, and called  him a coward.  But George would have said, \"Do you think that 1 care for  your laughing? I do not think it right to throw the snowball. I  will not do that which 1 think to be wrong, if the whole town  should join with you in laughing.\"  This would have been real courage. Henry would have  seen, at once, that it would do no good to laugh at a boy who  had so bold a heart. You must have this fearless spirit, or you  will get into trouble, and will be, and ought to be, disliked by  all.      LESSON LIII.    THE OLD CLOCK.    1.  In the old, old hall the old clock stands,  And round and round move the steady hands;  With its tick, tick, tick, both night and day,  While seconds and minutes pass away.     138  ECLECTIC SERIES,    2.  At the old, old clock oft wonders Nell,  For she can't make out what it has to tell;        She has ne'er yet read, in prose or rhyme,  That it marks the silent course of time.    3.  When I was a child, as Nell is now,  And long ere Time had wrinkled my brow,  The old, old clock both by night and day  Said,--\"Tick, tick, tick!\" Time passes away.     THIRD READER.  139        LESSON LIV.  THE WAVES.  1. \"Where are we to go?\" said the little waves to the great,  deep sea.  \"Go, my darlings, to the yellow sands: you will find work  to do there.\"  2. \"I want to play,\" said one little wave; \"I want to see  who can jump the highest.\"  \"No; come on, come on,\" said an earnest wave; \"mother  must be right. I want to work.\"  3. \"Oh, I dare not go,\" said another; \"look at those great,  black rocks close to the sands; I dare not go there, for they  will tear me to pieces.\"  4. \"Take my hand, sister,\" said the earnest wave; \"let us go  on together. How glorious it is to do some work.\"  5. \"Shall we ever go back to mother?\" \"Yes, when our  work is done.\"     140  ECLECTIC SERIES.  6. So one and all hurried on. Even the little wave that  wanted to play, pressed on, and thought that work might be  fun after all. The timid ones did not like to be left behind,  and they became earnest as they got nearer the sands.  7. After all, it was fun, pressing on one after another--  jumping, laughing, running on to the broad, shining sands.  8. First, they came in their course to a great sand castle.  Splash, splash! they all       THIRD READER.  141  went over it, and down it came. \"Oh, what fun!\" they cried.  9. \"Mother told me to bring these seaweeds; I will find a  pretty place for them,\" said one--and she ran a long way over  the sands, and left them among the pebbles. The pebbles  cried, \"We are glad you are come. We wanted washing.\"  10. \"Mother sent these shells; I do n't know where to put  them,\" said a little fretful wave. \"Lay them one by one on the  sand, and do not break them,\" said the eldest wave.  11. And the little one went about its work, and learned to  be quiet and gentle, for fear of breaking the shells.  12. \"Where is my work?\" said a great, full-grown wave.  \"this is mere play. The little ones can do this and laugh over  it. Mother said there was work for me.\" And he came down  upon some large rocks.  13. Over the rocks and into a pool he went, and he heard  the fishes say, \"The sea is coming. Thank you, great sea; you  always send a big wave when a storm is nigh. Thank you,  kind wave; we are all ready for you now.\"     142  ECLECTIC SERIES.  14. Then the waves all went back over the wet sands,  slowly and"]]]
