In any case, the young officer only saved himself and his  men by a hasty retreat to the boats, tumbling into the sea a mortar  and four cannon. Such was the ending to the great captain's first  military enterprise.    On his return to Ajaccio (March 3rd, 1793), Buonaparte found affairs  in utter confusion. News had recently arrived of the declaration of  war by the French Republic against England and Holland. Moreover,  Napoleon's young brother, Lucien, had secretly denounced Paoli to the  French authorities at Toulon; and three commissioners were now sent  from Paris charged with orders to disband the Corsican National  Guards, and to place the Corsican dictator under the orders of the  French general commanding the army of Italy.[18]    A game of truly Macchiavellian skill is now played. The French  commissioners, among whom the Corsican deputy, Salicetti, is by far  the most able, invite Paoli to repair to Toulon, there to concert  measures for the defence of Corsica. Paoli, seeing through the ruse  and discerning a guillotine, pleads that his age makes the journey  impossible; but with his friends he quietly prepares for resistance  and holds the citadel of Ajaccio. Meanwhile the commissioners make  friendly overtures to the old chief; in these Napoleon participates,  being ignorant of Lucien's action at Toulon. The sincerity of these  overtures may well be called in question, though Buonaparte still used  the language of affection to his former idol. However this may be, all  hope of compromise is dashed by the zealots who are in power at Paris.  On April 2nd they order the French commissioners to secure Paoli's  person, by whatever means, and bring him to the French capital. At  once a cry of indignation goes up from all parts of Corsica; and  Buonaparte draws up a declaration, vindicating Paoli's conduct and  begging the French Convention to revoke its decree.[19] Again, one  cannot but suspect that this declaration was intended mainly, if not  solely, for local consumption. In any case, it failed to cool the  resentment of the populace; and the partisans of France soon came to  blows with the Paolists.    Salicetti and Buonaparte now plan by various artifices to gain the  citadel of Ajaccio from the Paolists, but guile is three times foiled  by guile equally astute. Failing here, the young captain seeks to  communicate with the French commissioners at Bastia. He sets out  secretly, with a trusty shepherd as companion, to cross the island:  but at the village of Bocognano he is recognized and imprisoned by the  partisans of Paoli. Some of the villagers, however, retain their old  affection to the Buonaparte family, which here has an ancestral  estate, and secretly set him free. He returns to Ajaccio, only to find  an order for his arrest issued by the Corsican patriots. This time he  escapes by timely concealment in the grotto of a friend's garden; and  from the grounds of another family connection he finally glides away  in a vessel to a point of safety, whence he reaches Bastia.    Still, though a fugitive, he persists in believing that Ajaccio is  French at heart, and urges the sending of a liberating force. The  French commissioners agree, and the expedition sails--only to meet  with utter failure. Ajaccio, as one man, repels the partisans of  France; and, a gale of wind springing up, Buonaparte and his men  regain their boats with the utmost difficulty. At a place hard by, he  finds his mother, uncle, brothers and sisters. Madame Buonaparte, with  the extraordinary tenacity of will that characterized her famous son,  had wished to defend her house at Ajaccio against the hostile  populace; but, yielding to the urgent warnings of friends, finally  fled to the nearest place of safety, and left the house to the fury of  the populace, by whom it was nearly wrecked.    For a brief space Buonaparte clung to the hope of regaining Corsica  for the Republic, but now only by the aid of French troops. For the  islanders, stung by the demand of the French Convention that Paoli  should go to Paris, had rallied to the dictator's side; and the aged  chief made overtures to England for alliance. The partisans of France,  now menaced by England's naval power, were in an utterly untenable  position. Even the steel-like will of Buonaparte was bent. His career  in Corsica was at an end for the present; and with his kith and kin he  set sail for France.    The interest of the events above described lies, not in their  intrinsic importance, but in the signal proof which they afford of  Buonaparte's wondrous endowments of mind and will. In a losing cause  and in a petty sphere he displays all the qualities which, when the  omens were favourable, impelled him to the domination of a Continent.  He fights every inch of ground tenaciously; at each emergency he  evinces a truly Italian fertility of resource, gliding round obstacles  or striving to shatter them by sheer audacity, seeing through men,  cajoling them by his insinuations or overawing them by his mental  superiority, ever determined to try the fickle jade Fortune to the  very utmost, and retreating only before the inevitable. The sole  weakness discoverable in this nature, otherwise compact of strength,  is an excess of will-power over all the faculties that make for  prudence. His vivid imagination only serves to fire him with the full  assurance that he must prevail over all obstacles.    And yet, if he had now stopped to weigh well the lessons of the past,  hitherto fertile only in failures and contradictions, he must have  seen the powerlessness of his own will when in conflict with the  forces of the age; for he had now severed his connection with the  Corsican patriots, of whose cause he had only two years before been  the most passionate champion. It is evident that the schism which  finally separated Buonaparte and Paoli originated in their divergence  of views regarding the French Revolution. Paoli accepted revolutionary  principles only in so far as they promised to base freedom on a due  balance of class interests. He was a follower of Montesquieu. He  longed to see in Corsica a constitution similar to that of England or  to that of 1791 in France. That hope vanished alike for France and  Corsica after the fall of the monarchy; and towards the Jacobinical  Republic, which banished orthodox priests and guillotined the amiable  Louis, Paoli thenceforth felt naught but loathing: \"We have been the  enemies of kings,\" he said to Joseph Buonaparte; \"let us never be  their executioners.\" Thenceforth he drifted inevitably into alliance  with England.    Buonaparte, on the other hand, was a follower of Rousseau, whose ideas  leaped to power at the downfall of the monarchy. Despite the excesses  which he ever deplored, this second Revolution appeared to him to be  the dawn of a new and intelligent age. The clear-cut definitions of  the new political creed dovetailed in with his own rigid views of  life. Mankind was to be saved by law, society being levelled down and  levelled up until the ideals of Lycurgus were attained. Consequently  he regarded the Republic as a mighty agency for the social  regeneration not only of France, but of all peoples. His insular  sentiments were gradually merged in these vaster schemes.  Self-interest and the differentiating effects of party strifes  undoubtedly assisted the mental transformation; but it is clear that  the study of the \"Social Contract\" was the touchstone of his early  intellectual growth. He had gone to Rousseau's work to deepen his  Corsican patriotism: he there imbibed doctrines which drew him  irresistibly into the vortex of the French Revolution, and of its wars  of propaganda and conquest.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER III    TOULON      When Buonaparte left Corsica for the coast of Provence, his career had  been remarkable only for the strange contrast between the brilliance  of his gifts and the utter failure of all his enterprises. His French  partisanship had, as it seemed, been the ruin of his own and his  family's fortunes. At the age of twenty-four he was known only as the  unlucky leader of forlorn hopes and an outcast from the island around  which his fondest longings had been entwined. His land-fall on the  French coast seemed no more promising; for at that time Provence was  on the verge of revolt against the revolutionary Government. Even  towns like Marseilles and Toulon, which a year earlier had been noted  for their republican fervour, were now disgusted with the course of  events at Paris. In the third climax of revolutionary fury, that of  June 2nd, 1793, the more enlightened of the two republican factions,  the Girondins, had been overthrown by their opponents, the men of the  Mountain, who, aided by the Parisian rabble, seized on power. Most of  the Departments of France resented this violence and took up arms. But  the men of the Mountain acted with extraordinary energy: they  proclaimed the Girondins to be in league with the invaders, and  blasted their opponents with the charge of conspiring to divide France  into federal republics. The Committee of Public Safety, now installed  in power at Paris, decreed a _levee en masse_ of able-bodied patriots  to defend the sacred soil of the Republic, and the \"organizer of  victory,\" Carnot, soon drilled into a terrible efficiency the hosts  that sprang from the soil. On their side the Girondins had no  organization whatever, and were embarrassed by the adhesion of very  many royalists. Consequently their wavering groups speedily gave way  before the impact of the new, solid, central power.    A movement so wanting in definiteness as that of the Girondins was  destined to slide into absolute opposition to the men of the Mountain:  it was doomed to become royalist. Certainly it did not command the  adhesion of Napoleon. His inclinations are seen in his pamphlet, \"Le"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314"],[0,"Etiquette (#10)"],[1,"  intimate friends are coming, a hostess usually asks them what they want to  see and tries to get tickets accordingly.    It is really unnecessary to add that one must never ask people to go to a  place of public amusement and then stand in line to get seats at the time  of the performance.      =GOING DOWN THE AISLE OF A THEATER=    The host, or whichever gentleman has the tickets, (if there is no host,  the hostess usually hands them to one of the, gentlemen before leaving her  house), goes down the aisle first and gives the checks to the usher, and  the others follow in the order in which they are to sit and which the  hostess must direct. It is necessary that each knows who follows whom,  particularly if a theater party arrives after the curtain has gone up. If  the hostess \"forgets,\" the guests always ask before trooping down the  aisle \"How do you want us to sit?\" For nothing is more awkward and stupid  than to block the aisle at the row where their seats are, while their  hostess \"sorts them\"; and worse yet, in her effort to be polite, sends the  ladies to their seats first and then lets the gentlemen stumble across  them to their own places. Going down the aisle is not a question of  precedence, but a question of seating. The one who is to sit eighth from  the aisle, whether a lady or a gentleman, goes first, then the seventh,  then the sixth, and if the gentleman with the checks is fifth, he goes in  his turn and the fourth follows him.    If a gentleman and his wife go to the theater alone, the question as to  who goes down the aisle first depends on where the usher is. If the usher  takes the checks at the head of the aisle, she follows the usher.  Otherwise the gentleman goes first with the checks. When their places are  shown him, he stands aside for his wife to take her place first and then  he takes his. A lady never sits in the aisle seat if she is with a  gentleman.      =GOOD MANNERS AT THE THEATER=    In passing across people who are seated, always face the stage and press  as close to the backs of the seats you are facing as you can. Remember  also not to drag anything across the heads of those sitting in front of  you. At the moving pictures, especially when it is dark and difficult to  see, a coat on an arm passing behind a chair can literally devastate the  hair-dressing of a lady occupying it.    If you are obliged to cross in front of some one who gets up to let you  pass, say \"Thank you,\" or \"Thank you very much\" or \"I am very sorry.\" Do  _not_ say \"Pardon _me_!\" or \"Beg pardon!\" Though you can say \"I beg your  pardon.\" That, however, would be more properly the expression to use if  you brushed your coat over their heads, or spilled water over them, or did  something to them for which you should actually _beg_ their pardon. But  \"Beg pardon,\" which is an abbreviation, is one of the phrases never said  in best society.    Gentlemen who want to go out after every act should always be sure to get  aisle seats. There are no greater theater pests than those who come back  after the curtain has gone up and temporarily snuff out the view of  everyone behind, as well as annoy those who are obliged to stand up and  let them by.    Between the acts nearly all gentlemen go out and smoke at least once, but  those wedged in far from the aisle, who file out every time the curtain  drops are utterly lacking in consideration for others. If there are five  acts, they should at most go out for two entr'actes and even then be  careful to come back before the curtain goes up.      =VERY INCONSIDERATE TO GIGGLE AND TALK=    Nothing shows less consideration for others than to whisper and rattle  programmes and giggle and even make audible remarks throughout a  performance. Very young people love to go to the theater in droves called  theater parties and absolutely ruin the evening for others who happen to  sit in front of them. If Mary and Johnny and Susy and Tommy want to talk  and giggle, why not arrange chairs in rows for them in a drawing-room,  turn on a phonograph as an accompaniment and let them sit there and  chatter!    If those behind you insist on talking it is never good policy to turn  around and glare. If you are young they pay no attention, and if you are  older--most young people think an angry older person the funniest sight  on earth! The small boy throws a snowball at an elderly gentleman for no  other reason! The only thing you can do is to say amiably: \"I'm sorry, but  I can't hear anything while you talk.\" If they still persist, you can ask  an usher to call the manager.    The sentimental may as well realize that every word said above a whisper  is easily heard by those sitting directly in front, and those who tell  family or other private affairs might do well to remember this also.    As a matter of fact, comparatively few people are ever anything but well  behaved. Those who arrive late and stand long, leisurely removing their  wraps, and who insist on laughing and talking are rarely encountered; most  people take their seats as quietly and quickly as they possibly can, and  are quite as much interested in the play and therefore as attentive and  quiet as you are. A very annoying person at the \"movies\" is one who reads  every \"caption\" out loud.      =PROPER THEATER CLOTHES=    At the evening performance in New York a lady wears a dinner dress; a  gentleman a dinner coat, often called a Tuxedo. Full dress is not correct,  but those going afterwards to a ball can perfectly well go to the theater  first if they do not make themselves conspicuous. A lady in a ball dress  and many jewels should avoid elaborate hair ornamentation and must keep  her wrap, or at least a sufficiently opaque scarf, about her shoulders to  avoid attracting people's attention. A gentleman in full dress is not  conspicuous.    And on the subject of theater dress it might be tentatively remarked that  prinking and \"making up\" in public are all part of an age which can not  see fun in a farce without bedroom scenes and actors in pajamas, and  actresses running about in negliges with their hair down. An audience  which night after night watches people dressing and undressing probably  gets into an unconscious habit of dressing or prinking itself. In other  days it was always thought that so much as to adjust a hat-pin or glance  in a glass was lack of breeding. Every well brought up young woman was  taught that she must finish dressing in her bedchamber. But to-day young  women in theaters, restaurants, and other public places, are continually  studying their reflection in little mirrors and patting their hair and  powdering their noses and fixing this or adjusting that in a way that in  Mrs. Oldname's girlhood would have absolutely barred them from good  society; nor can Mrs. Worldly or Mrs. Oldname be imagined \"preening\" and  \"prinking\" anywhere. They dress as carefully and as beautifully as  possible, but when they turn away from the mirrors in their dressing rooms  they never look in a glass or \"take note of their appearance\" until they  dress again. And it must be granted that Lucy Gilding, Constance Style,  Celia Lovejoy, Mary Smartlington and the other well-bred members of the  younger set do not put finishing touches on their faces in public--as yet!      =THE COURTESY OF SENDING TICKETS EARLY=    Most people are at times \"obliged\" to take tickets for various charity  entertainments--balls, theatricals, concerts or pageants--to which, if  they do not care to go themselves, they give away their tickets. Those who  intend giving tickets should remember that a message, \"Can you use two  tickets for the Russian ballet to-night?\" sent at seven o'clock that same  evening, after the Lovejoys have settled themselves for an evening at home  (Celia having decided not to curl her hair and Donald having that morning  sent his only dinner coat to be re-faced) can not give the same pleasure  that their earlier offer would have given. An opera box sent on the  morning of the opera is worse, since to find four music-loving people to  fill it on such short notice at the height of the season is an undertaking  that few care to attempt.      =A BIG THEATER PARTY=    A big theater party is one of the favorite entertainments given for a  debutante. If fifty or more are to be asked, invitations are sometimes  engraved.                        Mrs. Toplofty                   requests the pleasure of           [_Name of guest is written on this line._]        company at the theater and a small dance afterward                  in honor of her great-niece                    Miss Millicent Gilding                on Tuesday the sixth of January                  at half past eight o'clock        R.s.v.p.    But--and usually--the \"general utility\" invitation (see page 118) is  filled in, as follows:               [HW: To meet Miss Millicent Gilding]                         Mrs. Toplofty                     requests the pleasure of                     [HW: Miss Rosalie Gray's]        company at [HW: the Theater and at a dance]        on [HW: Tuesday the sixth of January]        at [HW: 8:15]        R.s.v.p.    Or notes in either wording above are written by hand.    All those who accept have a ticket sent them. Each ticket sent a debutante  is accompanied by a visiting card on which is written:        \"Be in the lobby of the Comedy Theater at 8.15. Order your motor      to come for you at 010 Fifth Avenue at 1 A.M.\"    On the evening of the theater party, Mrs. Toplofty herself stands in the  lobby to receive the guests. As soon as any who are to sit next to each  other have arrived, they are sent into the theater; each gives her (or  his) ticket to an usher and sits in the place alloted to her (or him). It  is well for the hostess to have a seat plan for her own use in case  thoughtless young people mix their tickets all up and hand them to an  usher in a bunch! And yet--if they do mix themselves to their own  satisfaction, she"]]]
