Those betel-nuts, whom they sent to invite, arrived, those which  they sent to invite their relatives. They did not wish to go to  make _balaua_. The betel-nuts who went to invite them said, \"If you  do not wish to come, I will grow on your knee.\" Pagatipanan said,  \"You grow,\" and the betel-nut grew on his knee, and it became high  and he was in pain. \"Ala! you get off my knee, and you go on my pig,\"  he said, and the betel-nut went truly on his pig and it squealed. \"You  get off my pig, and we will come,\" he said, and the betel-nut truly  got off the pig. \"Ala! you who live in the same town, you go and wash  your hair and bathe, and wash your clothes so that we can go to make  _Sayang_ [107] with the stone and Aponibolinayen. Here is a betel-nut  covered with gold which they send,\" said Pagatipanan. And the people  who lived in the same town washed their hair and bathed, and they  went to wash their clothes. Not long after it became afternoon and  Pagatipanan used magic so that cake and singed pig appeared which  they were to take to those who make _Sayang_, which they exchanged  with those who make _Sayang_. [108] Not long after they arrived at  the place of the gathering, and Aponibolinayen and Ini-init went to  make _alawig_, [109] and when they had finished, they brought them  up to the town. Pagatipanan said, \"I did not think that the stone  which rolled could change when he came to make _balaua_ with us.\"    \"_Ala_! now all you who have arrived, rich men, you divide the prepared  betel-nut which is covered with gold,\" said Ini-init. Not long after  Pagatipanan cut the betel-nut and chewed, and the quid of Ini-init  went to the quid of Pagbokasan, and the quid of Aponibolinayen went  to the quid of Pagatipanan. [110]    \"Ala! now that we have finished chewing, I will give the payment  for Aponibolinayen, and now that you have found out that I am your  son--father and mother--let us give the payment,\" [111] said Ini-init.    His father and mother said, \"If that is what you say, my child,  we will give,\" and they gave him the name of Aponitolau. [112] And  Aponitolau said, \"Ala! you play the _gansa_ [113] so that we can  dance.\" When they played the _gansa_, Iwaginan took the _alap_ and  _kinamayan_ [114] and he gave them to Aponibolinayen and Agyokan. When  Aponibolinayen and Agyokan had finished dancing, they made Aponitolau  and Asindamayan dance. When Aponitolau and Asindamayan finished  dancing he made to dance Dinay of Kabisilan, who was the daughter  of Dalonagan, and also they made to dance Kanag, [115] who was the  son of Aponibolinayen and Aponitolau. When they finished to dance,  Datalan and Dalonagan of Kabisilan danced, and when they finished  to dance, Iwaginan made Dagapan and Indiapan dance. When they had  finished dancing Ginteban and Agyokan were next. And the beads of  Ginteban were jars, which struck together while they danced. Next were  Iwaginan and Kindi-inan who was the wife of Ilwisan of Dagapan. And  when they had all danced they stopped playing the _gansa_. Aponitolau  gave the payment for Aponibolinayen and it was the _balaua_ nine  times filled with jars--_malayo, tadogan_, and _ginlasan_. [116] And  when he had given all the payment they played again on the _gansas_  for one month and they danced.    When one month passed, they went home--their relatives whom they  had invited. They said, \"Ala! now Aponitolau and Aponibolinayen,  since the day has arrived on which we go home, do not detain us for  we have been here for a month, we go home to our town.\" Not long after  they all went home. And the father and mother of Aponitolau took them  home with them to Kadalayapan, and they took all their possessions  from up above. When they arrived in Kadalayapan those who lived in  the same town were surprised, for Aponitolau and Aponibolinayen were  there. They went to see them and Balokanag (i.e., Kanag--their son)  was large. It is said.    (Told by Magwati, a man of Lagangilang Abra.)        2    \"I am anxious to eat the mango fruit which belongs to Algaba of  Dagala,\" said Aponibolinayen. When she said this she was almost dying  and she repeated it. \"Ala cousin Dalonagan, you go and take cousin  Dina-ogan, and go and secure the mango fruit of Algaba of Dagala,\"  said Aponibalagen. \"Why does Aponibolinayen want the mango fruit of  Algaba of Dagala; does she not know that anyone who goes there cannot  return?\" asked Dalonagan. \"Ala, you go and be careful and he will not  hurt you,\" said Aponibalagen. And Dalonagan went truly, and started,  and Aponibalagen gave Dalonagan a belt and earrings, which he was  to trade for the mango fruit; and Dalonagan went to get Dina-ogan,  and he took an egg. Not long after they went and they held the egg  all the time as they walked. When they were in the middle of the way  the egg hatched. When they had almost arrived in Dagala the chicken  had become a rooster which could crow.    Not long after they arrived at the spring of Algaba of Dagala, and the  people who dipped water from the spring were there. \"You people who  are dipping water from the spring, where is a shallow place where we  can cross?\" \"Where is the shallow place where we can cross you say,  rich men, perhaps you are enemies,\" said the women who were dipping  water. \"If we are enemies we would kill you,\" said Dalonagan. \"You  see the shallow place where the people cross,\" said the people who  were dipping water from the well. Not long after they spread their  belt on the water and they rode across. When they arrived on the other  side of the river they took a bath. As soon as they finished bathing  they went on top of a high stone and dried their bodies. The water  which dropped from their bodies became agates which have no holes  through them, and the women who were dipping water saw the agates  which dropped from their bodies and they touched each other and said,  \"Look at that.\" When they put their clouts on they asked the women,  \"Where is the road to the house of Algaba of Dagala?\" \"You follow  the _sagang_; [117] they lead to his house and his _balaua_,\"  said the women who were dipping water from the well. \"Will one of  you guide us to the house of our cousin Algaba?\" they said. \"No,  because no one comes to get water unless all are together,\" said the  women. Not long after Dalonagan and his companion went up to the  town and the defensive fence, which was made of boa constrictors,  did not notice them for the snakes slept. Not long after they arrived  at the _balaua_. \"_Wes_,\" they said, and the old woman _alan_ [118]  came to look at them through the window. \"How are you?\" she said. \"Do  not go to the _balaua_, because Algaba can see you,\" said the _alan_.    Algaba was playing with his sweetheart in the other house, when his  sweetheart arrived from the well. \"Your big snakes, which make the  fence, did not see the enemies who came inside of the town.\" Then  Algaba ran to his house and he was very angry when he saw the two  men. He went to get his headaxe and spear and when he took them down  the weapons shed tears which were of oil. \"What is the matter with  my weapons that they weep oil? Perhaps these men are my relatives,\"  said the angry man. He dropped them and when he took another set they  shed bloody tears.    The two men went up into the kitchen of the house, and Algaba went  there. \"How do you do now?\" he said, still angry. \"What do you want  here?\" \"What are you here for, you ask, and we came to buy the mango  fruit for Aponibolinayen who is nearly dead.\" \"It is good that you came  here,\" said Algaba, but he was angry and the two men were frightened,  and they did not eat much. As soon as they finished eating, \"What do  you want to pay?\" said Algaba. They let him see the one earring of  Aponibolinayen. \"I don't like that; look at the yard of my house. All  the stones are gold,\" said Algaba. When he did not want the earring,  they let him see the belt, and Algaba smiled. \"How pretty it is! I  think the lady who owns this is much prettier,\" he said to them. \"Ala,  you go and get two of the fruit.\" So they went truly, and Dalonagan  went to climb and when he secured two mangoes he went down. \"We  go now.\" \"I will go with you for I wish to see Aponibolinayen,\"  said Algaba. He said to his mother _alan_ \"You, mother, do not feel  anxious concerning me while I am gone, for I want to go and see the  sick lady who so desires the mango fruit. Watch for enemies who come  inside the town.\" \"Yes, do not stay long,\" said his mother _alan_.    Not long after they went and when they were in the middle of the way  Algaba said, \"Is it far yet?\" \"It is near now,\" they answered. \"I  use my power so that the sick woman, for whom they came to get fruit,  will feel very ill and nearly die,\" said Algaba to himself. Not long  after, truly they almost arrived. When they reached the well, he  asked again, \"Is it still far?\" but he knew that the well belonged to  Aponibolinayen. \"It is near now; she owns this well,\" they said. Not  long after they entered the gate of the town. \"I use my power so  that Aponibolinayen will die,\" he said, and she truly died. \"Why is  Aponibolinayen dead? The mango fruit which we went to get is worthless  now,\" they said. \"Perhaps she is the one they are wailing for,\" said  Algaba of Dagala. When they reached the ladder, \"The mango fruit which  you went to get is no good at all,\" said Aponibalagen to them. \"Yes,  it is. I came because I wish to see her,\" said Algaba of Dagala. \"If  it is possible for you to bring her to life, please do so,\" said  Aponibalagen to him, and took him inside of the house. Algaba looked  at her, and she was a lady without an equal for beauty. Not long  after he took the body in his arms. \"I use my power so that when I  whip my perfume [119] _kaladakad_ she will move directly,\" he said,  and the body moved. \"I use my power so that when I whip my perfume  _banawes_ she will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12561"],[0,"A Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy (#10)"],[1,"vases, etc.  My expectations were  sadly damped.  The place where the heads of pashas who had fallen  into disfavour were exhibited is in the third yard.  Heaven be  praised, no severed heads are now seen stuck on the palings.    I was not fortunate enough to be admitted into the imperial harem; I  did not possess sufficient interest to obtain a view of it.  At a  later period of my journey, however, I succeeded in viewing several  harems.    THE HIPPODROME    is the largest and finest open place in Constantinople.  After those  of Cairo and Padua, it is the most spacious I have seen any where.  Two obelisks of red granite, covered with hieroglyphics, are the  only ornaments of this place.  The houses surrounding it are built,  according to the general fashion, of wood, and painted with oil-  colours of different tints.  I here noticed a great number of pretty  children's carriages, drawn by servants.  Many parents assembled  here to let their children be driven about.    Not far from the Hippodrome are the great cisterns with the thousand  and one pillars.  Once on a time this gigantic fabric must have  presented a magnificent appearance.  Now a miserable wooden  staircase, lamentably out of repair, leads you down a flight of  thirty or forty steps into the depths of one of these cisterns, the  roof of which is supported by three hundred pillars.  This cistern  is no longer filled with water, but serves as a workshop for silk-  spinners.  The place seems almost as if it had been expressly built  for such a purpose, as it receives light from above, and is cool in  summer, and warm during the winter.  It is now impossible to  penetrate into the lower stories, as they are either filled with  earth or with water.    The aqueducts of Justinian and Valentinian are stupendous works.  They extend from Belgrade to the \"Sweet Waters,\" a distance of about  fourteen miles, and supply the whole of Constantinople with a  sufficiency of water.    COFFEE-HOUSES--STORY-TELLERS.    Before I bade farewell to Constantinople for the present and betook  me to Pera, I requested my guide to conduct me to a few coffee-  houses, that I might have a new opportunity of observing the  peculiar customs and mode of life of the Turks.  I had already  obtained some notion of the appearance of these places in Giurgewo  and Galatz; but in this imperial town I had fancied I should find  them somewhat neater and more ornamental.  But this delusion  vanished as soon as I entered the first coffee-house.  A wretchedly  dirty room, in which Turks, Greeks, Armenians, and others sat cross-  legged on divans, smoking and drinking coffee, was all I could  discover.  In the second house I visited I saw, with great disgust,  that the coffee-room was also used as a barber's shop; on one side  they were serving coffee, and on the other a Turk was having his  head shaved.  They say that bleeding is sometimes even carried on in  these booths.    In a coffee-house of a rather superior class we found one of the so-  called \"story-tellers.\"  The audience sit round in a half-circle,  and the narrator stands in the foreground, and quietly begins a tale  from the Thousand and One Nights; but as he continues he becomes  inspired, and at length roars and gesticulates like the veriest  ranter among a company of strolling players.    Sherbet is not drunk in all the coffee-houses; but every where we  find stalls and booths where this cooling and delicious beverage is  to be had.  It is made from the juice of fruits, mixed with that of  lemons and pomegranates.  In Pera ice is only to be had in the  coffee-houses of the Franks, or of Christian confectioners.  All  coffee-house keepers are obliged to buy their coffee ready burnt and  ground from the government, the monopoly of this article being an  imperial privilege.  A building has been expressly constructed for  its preparation, where the coffee is ground to powder by machinery.  The coffee is made very strong, and poured out without being  strained, a custom which I could not bring myself to like.    It is well worth the traveller's while to make an    EXCURSION TO EJUB,    the greatest suburb of Constantinople, and also the place where the  richest and most noble of the Turks are buried.    Ejub, the standard-bearer of Mahomet, rests here in a magnificent  mosque, built entirely of white marble.  None but a Mussulman may  tread this hallowed shrine.  A tolerably good view of the interior  can, however, be obtained from without, as the windows are lofty and  broad, and reach nearly to the ground.  The sarcophagus stands in a  hall; it is covered with a richly embroidered pall, over which are  spread five or six \"real\" shawls.  The part beneath which the head  rests is surmounted by a turban, also of real shawls.  The chief  sarcophagus is surrounded by several smaller coffins, in which  repose the wives, children, and nearest relations of Ejub.  Hard by  the mosque we find a beautiful fountain of white marble, surrounded  by a railing of gilded iron, and furnished with twelve bright  drinking-cups of polished brass.  A Turk here is appointed expressly  to hand these to the passers-by.  A little crooked garden occupies  the space behind the mosque.  The mosques in which the dead sultans  are deposited are all built in the same manner as that of Ejub.  Instead of the turban, handsome fez-caps, with the heron's feather,  lie on the coffins.  Among the finest mosques is that in which  repose the remains of the late emperor.  In Ejub many very costly  monuments are to be seen.  They are generally surrounded by richly-  gilt iron railings, their peaks surmounted by the shining crescent,  and forming an arch above a sarcophagus, round which are planted  rose-bushes and dwarf cypresses, with ivy and myrtle clinging to  their stems.  It would, however, be very erroneous to suppose that  the rich alone lie buried here.  The poor man also finds his nook;  and frequently we see close by a splendid monument the modest stone  which marks the resting-place of the humble Mussulman.    On my return I met the funeral of a poor Turk.  If my attention had  not been attracted to the circumstance, I should have passed by  without heeding it.  The corpse was rolled in a cloth, fastened at  the head and at the feet, and laid on a board which a man carried on  his shoulder.  At the grave the dead man is once more washed,  wrapped in clean linen cloths, and thus lowered into the earth.  And  this is as it should be.  Why should the pomp and extravagance of  man accompany him to his last resting-place?  Were it not well if in  this matter we abated something of our conventionality and  ostentation?  I do not mean to say that interments need be stripped  of every thing like ornament; in all things the middle way is the  safest.  A simple funeral has surely in it more that awakes true  religious feeling than the pomp and splendour which are too  frequently made the order of the day in these proceedings.  In this  case are not men sometimes led away to canvass and to criticise the  splendour of the show, while they should be deducing a wholesome  moral lesson for themselves, or offering up a fervent prayer to the  Almighty for the peace of the departed spirit?    HOUSES--THEATRES--CARRIAGES.    The houses in the whole of Constantinople, in which we may include  Pera, Topana, etc., are very slightly and carelessly put together.  No door, no window, closes and fits well; the floorings frequently  exhibit gaps an inch in breadth; and yet rents are very high.  The  reason of this is to be found in the continual danger of fire to  which all towns built of wood are exposed.  Every proprietor of a  house calculates that he may be burnt out in the course of five or  six years, and therefore endeavours to gain back his capital with  interest within this period.  Thus we do not find the houses so well  built or so comfortably furnished as in the generality of European  towns.    There is a theatre in Pera, which will hold from six to seven  hundred spectators.  At the time of my sojourn there, a company of  Italian singers were giving four representations every week.  Operas  of the most celebrated masters were here to be heard; but I attended  one representation, and had quite enough.  The wonder is that such  an undertaking answers at all, as the Turks have no taste for music,  and the Franks are too fastidious to be easily satisfied.    The carriages--which are, generally speaking, only used by women--  are of two kinds.  The first is in the shape of a balloon, finely  painted and gilt, and furnished with high wheels.  On each side is  an opening, to enter which the passenger mounts on a wooden stool,  placed there by the coachman every time he ascends or descends.  The  windows or openings can be closed with Venetian blinds.  These  carriages contain neither seats nor cushion.  Every one who drives  out takes carpets or bolsters with him, spreads them out inside the  coach, and sits down cross-legged.  A carriage of this description  will hold four persons.  The second species of carriage only differs  from that already described in having still higher wheels, and  consisting of a kind of square box, covered in at the top, but open  on all sides.  The passengers enter at the back, and there is  generally room for eight persons.  The former kind of vehicle is  drawn by one horse in shafts, and sometimes by two; the latter by  one or two oxen, also harnessed in shafts, which are, however,  furnished in addition with a wooden arch decorated with flowers,  coloured paper, and ribbons.  The coachman walks on foot beside his  cattle, to guide them with greater security through the uneven ill-  paved streets, in which you are continually either ascending or  descending a hill.    Wagons there are none; every thing is carried either by men, horses,  or asses.  This circumstance explains the fact that more porters are  found here than in any other city."]]]
