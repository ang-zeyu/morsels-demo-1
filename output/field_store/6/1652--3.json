E., one mile and a  half, was the north-westernmost of three small isles; and to this, the  second lieutenant was sent, for the purpose of taking possession of all  the islands seen in the Strait, for HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY GEORGE III.,  with the ceremonies used on such occasions: the name bestowed upon the  whole was CLARENCE'S ARCHIPELAGO.    [* This mountain, in latitude 10 deg. 12' south, longitude 142 deg. 13' east, was  seen by captain Bligh from the Bounty's launch, and marked in his chart,  (_Voyage, etc._ p. 220.) It appears to be the same island indistinctly  laid down by captain Cook, in latitude 10 deg. 10', longitude 141 deg. 14'; and  is, also, one of those, to which the term _Hoge Landt_ is applied in  Thevenot's chart of 1663.]    _North Possession Island_ was found to be little else than a mass of  rocks surrounded by a reef; but it was covered with a variety of trees  and shrubs. Amongst them was a cluster of cocoa-nut trees, bearing a  small, but delicious, fruit; and the tree bearing a plum, such as had  been seen at Dalrymple's Island. Besides these, the botanists found the  _peeha_ and _nono_ of Taheity; and two new plants, of the size of the  common mulberry. One, of the class _polyadelphia_, bears a scarlet,  bell-shaped flower, large as the China rose; the other was a species of  _erythrina_, bearing clusters of butterfly-shaped flowers, of a light  yellow, tinged with purple: both were entirely destitute of leaves, and  their woods remarkably brittle.    There did not appear to be any fixed inhabitants upon Possession Island;  but from a fire which had been recently extinguished, and the shells and  bones of turtle scattered around, it was supposed to have been visited  not many days before. The bushes were full of small, green ants; which  proved exceedingly troublesome to those who had sufficient hardihood to  penetrate their retreats. Another, and larger species of ant, was black;  and made its nest by bending and fixing together the leaves, in a round  form, so as to be impenetrable to the wet. These, and a small kind of  lizard, were all the animals found upon the island.    Sept. 17. The boats led to the westward, steering for a passage between  Mulgrave's and Jervis' Islands; but seeing it full of rocks and shoals,  the vessels anchored a little within the entrance, in 10 fathoms, coarse  ground; until the boats should sound ahead. The latitude here was 10 deg. 2',  and longitude 142 deg. 03'. The flood tide, from the E. N. E., was found to  set through between the islands, at the rate of four miles an hour; and  the breeze being fresh, and bottom bad, the situation was considered to  be very unsafe.    Whilst the boats were sounding, several Indians in three canoes, were  perceived making towards them; but on a swivel shot being fired over  their heads, they returned to Mulgrave's Island, on the south side of the  passage. On the signal being made for good anchorage further on, the  Assistant led to the W. by S.; but on reaching the boats, the bottom was  found much inferior to what had been imagined; the approach of night,  however, obliged captain Bligh to anchor, soon afterward, in 8 fathoms.    In this situation, the vessels were so closely surrounded with rocks and  reefs, as scarcely to have swinging room; the bottom was rocky; the wind  blowing a fresh gale; and a tide running between four and five knots an  hour. This anxious night was, however, passed without accident; and next  morning, Sept. 18, the route was continued through the passage, between  reefs and rocks, which, in some places, were not three quarters of a mile  asunder: the smallest depth was 4 fathoms.    On clearing this dangerous pass, which captain Bligh named, _Bligh's  Farewell_, he anchored in 6 fathoms, sandy bottom; the wind blowing  strong at S. E. with thick weather. The latitude here was 10 deg. 5', and  longitude 141 deg. 56'. From north nearly, round by the east, to S. 8 deg. E.,  there was a mass of islands, rocks, and reefs, at various distances; but  in the western half of the compass, no danger was visible; and as far as  three miles to the W. N. W., the boats found good soundings in 6 and 7  fathoms.    Sept. 19. The wind moderated; and the vessels steered W. by S. until  noon, with a depth gradually increasing from 6 to 8 fathoms. The latitude  was then 10 deg. 81/2' south longitude, by time keeper, 141 deg. 31' east, and no  land was in sight; nor did any thing more obstruct captain Bligh and his  associate, in their route to the island _Timor_.    Thus was accomplished, in nineteen days, the passage from the Pacific, or  Great Ocean, to the Indian Sea; without other misfortune than what arose  from the attack of the natives, and some damage done to the cables and  anchors. Perhaps no space of 31/2 deg. in length, presents more dangers than  Torres' Strait; but, with caution and perseverance, the captains Bligh  and Portlock proved them to be surmountable; and within a reasonable  time: how far it may be advisable to follow their track through the  Strait, will appear more fully hereafter.    In the _Voyage to the South Seas in H. M. ship Bounty_, page 220, captain  Bligh says, \"I cannot with certainty reconcile the situation of some  parts of the coast (near Cape York) that I have seen, to his (captain  Cook's) survey;\" and from the situation of the high islands on the west  side of the Strait, which had been seen from the Bounty's launch, and  were now subjected to the correction of the Providence's time-keepers; he  was confirmed in the opinion, that some material differences existed in  the positions of the lands near Cape York.    BAMPTON and ALT. 1793.    The last passage known to have been made through Torres' Strait,  previously to the sailing of the Investigator, was by Messieurs WILLIAM  BAMPTON and MATTHEW B. ALT, commanders of the ships _Hormuzeer_ and  _Chesterfield_. Their discoveries were made public, in two charts, by Mr.  Dalrymple, in 1798 and 1799; and from them, and captain Bampton's  manuscript journal, the south coast of New Guinea, and most of the reefs  and islands near it, are laid down in Plate XIII.; after having been  adjusted to the observations of captain Bligh, and to those subsequently  made by me in the Investigator and Cumberland. The journal was obtained  through the kindness of Mr. Arrowsmith; and, though no courses and  distances be given, and the differences from the charts be sometimes  considerable, it is yet so interesting in many points, that I have judged  the following abridgement would be acceptable, as well to the general, as  to the nautical, reader.    The Hormuzeer and Chesterfield sailed together from Norfolk Island; with  the intention of passing through Torres' Strait, by a route which the  commanders did not know to have been before attempted. June 20, 1793, in  the evening, being in latitude 10 deg. 24' south, and longitude 144 deg. 14' east  (by captain Bampton's chart), a dry reef was seen extending from W. 1/2 S.  to N. W. by W., distant four or five miles, and breakers from the mast  head at N. by E. 1/2 E. An island (Murray's), which appeared to be large  and woody, was also seen, and bore N. W. 1/2 W. The ships got ground in 60  fathoms, and hauled the wind to the eastward, till midnight; when, having  no bottom at 70 fathoms, they lay to, till morning.    June 21. The Hormuzeer's long boat was sent ahead; and, at ten o'clock,  the ships bore away northward. At noon, the latitude was 9 deg. 30'. The  course was altered, at three, to the north-west; and at dusk, they hove  to, for the night: soundings from 70 to 56 fathoms. The same course being  resumed on the 22nd, the latitude, at noon, was 8 deg. 48'; and the depth 30  fathoms, on a bottom of sand, mud, and shells. From noon to five p.m.,  when they anchored, the ships appear to have steered W. by S. The land  had been seen at one o'clock; and at two, the water had shoaled suddenly,  from 30 to 10 fathoms, and afterwards diminished to 5, which continued to  the place of anchorage. The land was part of the coast of NEW GUINEA; and  the extremes were set at W. by N. 1/2 N. and N. W. 1/2 N., six or seven  leagues, (in the chart, miles.) The flood tide here, set two miles per  hour, towards the land; and the rise, by the lead line, was nine feet.    June 23. The ships got under way with the weather, or ebb, tide, a little  before noon: latitude 8 deg. 52'. At four o'clock, the wind blew strong at  south-east, with thick weather, and they anchored in 9 fathoms, blue mud;  having made a course of E. N. E. nearly parallel to the coast. They  remained here till the next afternoon; when the Hormuzeer having parted  her cable, both ships stood to the north-eastward, along the land, until  midnight; at which time they wore to the south-west, in 30 fathoms. At  daylight of the 25th, the depth had decreased to 16 fathoms; and they  stretched north-eastward again, with little variation in the soundings.  The latitude, at noon, was 8 deg. 10'; and the ships continued their course  upon a wind, keeping as much to the east as possible; and the soundings  having increased to 30 fathoms, at dusk, they hove to; but stretched off,  at midnight, on coming into 10 fathoms. In the morning of June 26, they  were standing to the eastward; but the wind becoming light at nine  o'clock, Mr. Bampton anchored in 9 fathoms, on a muddy bottom, in  latitude 7 deg. 55' south. The coast of New Guinea was then seen to extend  from N. N. W. 1/2 W. to E. N. E.; and the south end of a reef, running off  from the western extreme, bore W. by S. 1/2 S., two leagues.    The land here forms a large, unsheltered bay; and an opening nearly at  the head, bearing N. 1/2 E., appeared like the entrance of a considerable  river; but an officer, who was sent in a boat to sound, saw breakers  stretching across. The soundings were regular, from 9 to 6 fathoms,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12956"],[0,"A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 1 (#10)"],[1,"the @Rg-Veda (X. 58) the soul (_manas_) of a man  apparently unconscious is invited to come back to him from the  trees, herbs, the sky, the sun, etc. In many of the hymns there  is also the belief in the existence of another world, where the  highest material joys are attained as a result of the performance  of the sacrifices and also in a hell of darkness underneath  where the evil-doers are punished. In the S'atapatha  Brahma@na we find that the dead pass between two fires which burn the  evil-doers, but let the good go by [Footnote ref 1]; it is also said  there that everyone is born again after death, is weighed in a balance,  and receives reward or punishment according as his works are good or bad.  It is easy to see that scattered ideas like these with regard to  the destiny of the soul of man according to the sacrifice that he  performs or other good or bad deeds form the first rudiments of  the later doctrine of metempsychosis. The idea that man enjoys  or suffers, either in another world or by being born in this world  according to his good or bad deeds, is the first beginning of the  moral idea, though in the Brahmanic days the good deeds were    _____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: See _S.B._ I. 9.3, and also Macdonell's _Vedic Mythology_,  pp. 166, 167.]    26    more often of the nature of sacrificial duties than ordinary good  works. These ideas of the possibilities of a necessary connection  of the enjoyments and sorrows of a man with his good and bad  works when combined with the notion of an inviolable law or  order, which we have already seen was gradually growing with  the conception of @rta, and the unalterable law which produces  the effects of sacrificial works, led to the Law of Karma and the  doctrine of transmigration. The words which denote soul in the  @Rg-Veda are _manas_, _atman_ and _asu_. The word _atman_ however  which became famous in later Indian thought is generally used  to mean vital breath. Manas is regarded as the seat of thought  and emotion, and it seems to be regarded, as Macdonell says, as  dwelling in the heart[Footnote ref 1]. It is however difficult to  understand how atman as vital breath, or as a separable part of man  going out of the dead man came to be regarded as the ultimate essence  or reality in man and the universe. There is however at least one  passage in the @Rg-Veda where the poet penetrating deeper and  deeper passes from the vital breath (_asu_) to the blood, and thence  to atman as the inmost self of the world; \"Who has seen how  the first-born, being the Bone-possessing (the shaped world), was  born from the Boneless (the shapeless)? where was the vital  breath, the blood, the Self (_atman_) of the world? Who went to  ask him that knows it [Footnote ref 2]?\" In Taittirya Ara@nyaka I. 23,  however, it is said that Prajapati after having created his self (as  the world) with his own self entered into it. In Taittirya Brahma@na  the atman is called omnipresent, and it is said that he who knows  him is no more stained by evil deeds. Thus we find that in the  pre-Upani@sad Vedic literature atman probably was first used to  denote \"vital breath\" in man, then the self of the world, and then  the self in man. It is from this last stage that we find the traces  of a growing tendency to looking at the self of man as the omnipresent  supreme principle of the universe, the knowledge of which  makes a man sinless and pure.      Conclusion.    Looking at the advancement of thought in the @Rg-Veda we  find first that a fabric of thought was gradually growing which  not only looked upon the universe as a correlation of parts or a    ____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Macdonell's _Vedic Mythology_, p.166 and R.V. viii.89.]    [Footnote 2: R.V.i. 164. 4 and Deussen's article on Atman in  _Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics_.    27    construction made of them, but sought to explain it as having  emanated from one great being who is sometimes described as  one with the universe and surpassing it, and at other times as  being separate from it; the agnostic spirit which is the mother  of philosophic thought is seen at times to be so bold as to express  doubts even on the most fundamental questions of creation--\"Who  knows whether this world was ever created or not?\" Secondly  the growth of sacrifices has helped to establish the unalterable  nature of the law by which the (sacrificial) actions produced their  effects of themselves. It also lessened the importance of deities  as being the supreme masters of the world and our fate, and the  tendency of henotheism gradually diminished their multiple  character and advanced the monotheistic tendency in some  quarters. Thirdly, the soul of man is described as being separable  from his body and subject to suffering and enjoyment in another  world according to his good or bad deeds; the doctrine that the  soul of man could go to plants, etc., or that it could again be reborn  on earth, is also hinted at in certain passages, and this may  be regarded as sowing the first seeds of the later doctrine of  transmigration. The self (_atman_) is spoken of in one place as the  essence of the world, and when we trace the idea in the Brahma@nas  and the Ara@nyakas we see that atman has begun to mean the  supreme essence in man as well as in the universe, and has thus  approached the great Atman doctrine of the Upani@sads.          CHAPTER III      THE EARLIER UPANI@SADS [Footnote ref 1]. (700 B.C.-600 B.C.)    The place of the Upani@sads in Vedic literature.    Though it is generally held that the Upani@sads are usually  attached as appendices to the Ara@nyakas which are again attached  to the Brahma@nas, yet it cannot be said that their distinction as  separate treatises is always observed. Thus we find in some cases  that subjects which we should expect to be discussed in a Brahma@na  are introduced into the Ara@nyakas and the Ara@nyaka materials  are sometimes fused into the great bulk of Upani@sad teaching.  This shows that these three literatures gradually grew up in one    ___________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: There are about 112 Upani@sads which have been published by  the \"Nir@naya-Sagara\" Press, Bombay, 1917.

The collection of Upani@sads translated by Dara shiko, Aurangzeb's brother,  contained 50 Upani@sads. The Muktika Upani@sad gives a list of 108  Upani@sads. With the exception of the first 13 Upani@sads most of them are  of more or less later date. The Upani@sads dealt with in this chapter are  the earlier ones. Amongst the later ones there are some which repeat the  purport of these, there are others which deal with the S'aiva, S'akta,  the Yoga and the Vai@s@nava doctrines. These will be referred to in  connection with the consideration of those systems in Volume II.

Some of the later Upani@sads were  composed even as late as the fourteenth or the fifteenth century.]    29    process of development and they were probably regarded as parts  of one literature, in spite of the differences in their subject-matter.  Deussen supposes that the principle of this division was to be  found in this, that the Brahma@nas were intended for the householders,  the Ara@nyakas for those who in their old age withdrew  into the solitude of the forests and the Upani@sads for those who  renounced the world to attain ultimate salvation by meditation.  Whatever might be said about these literary classifications the  ancient philosophers of India looked upon the Upani@sads as being  of an entirely different type from the rest of the Vedic literature  as dictating the path of knowledge (_jnana-marga_) as opposed  to the path of works (_karma-marga_) which forms the content  of the latter. It is not out of place here to mention that the  orthodox Hindu view holds that whatever may be written in the  Veda is to be interpreted as commandments to perform certain  actions (_vidhi_) or prohibitions against committing certain others  (_ni@sedha_).
