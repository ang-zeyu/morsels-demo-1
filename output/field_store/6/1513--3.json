There was a worried look on the face of the young  inventor, and he seemed preoccupied, as though thinking of something  far removed from whatever it was his eyes gazed upon.    \"Well, I'll do it!\" suddenly exclaimed Tom. \"I don't want to, but I  will. It's in the line of 'doing my bit,' I suppose; but I'd rather it  was something else. I wonder--\"    \"Ha! Up to your old tricks, I see, Tom!\" exclaimed a voice, in which  energy and friendliness mingled pleasingly.  \"Up to your old tricks!\"    \"Oh, hello, Mr. Damon!\" cried Tom, turning to shake hands with an  elderly gentleman--that is, elderly in appearance but not in action,  for he crossed the room with the springing step of a lad, and there was  the enthusiasm of youth on his face. \"What do you mean--my old tricks?\"    \"Talking to yourself, Tom. And when you do that it means there is  something in the wind. I hope, as a sort of side remark, it isn't rain  that's in the wind, for the soldiers over at camp have had enough water  to set up a rival establishment with Mr. Noah. But there's something  going on, isn't there? Bless my memorandum book, but don't tell me  there isn't, or I shall begin to believe I have lost all my deductive  powers of reasoning! I come in here, after knocking two or three times,  to which you pay not the least attention, and find you mysteriously  murmuring to yourself.    \"The last time that happened, Tom, was just before you started to dig  the big tunnel--No, I'm wrong. It was just before you started for the  Land of Wonders, as we decided it ought to be called. You were talking  to yourself then, when I walked in on you, and--Say, Tom!\" suddenly  exclaimed Mr. Damon eagerly, \"don't tell me you're going off on another  wild journey like that--don't!\"    \"Why?\" asked Tom, smiling at the energy of his caller.    \"Because if you are, I'll want to go with you, of course, and if I go  it means I'll have to start in as soon as I can to bring my wife around  to my way of thinking. The last time I went it took me two weeks to get  her to consent, and then she didn't like it. So if--\"    \"No, Mr. Damon,\" interrupted Tom, \"I don't count on going on any sort  of a trip--that is, any long one. I was just getting ready to take a  little spin in the Hawk, and if you'd like to come along--\"    \"You mean that saucy little airship of yours, Tom, that's always trying  to sit down on her tail, or tickle herself with one wing?\"    \"That's the Hawk!\" laughed Tom; \"though that tickling business you  speak of is when I spiral. Don't you like it?\"    \"Can't say I do,\" observed Mr. Damon dryly.    \"Well, I'll promise not to try any stunts if you come along,\" Tom went  on.    \"Where are you going?\" asked his friend.    \"Oh, no place in particular. As you surmised, I've been doing a bit of  thinking, and--\"    \"Serious thinking, too, Tom!\" interrupted Mr. Damon.  \"Excuse me, but I  couldn't help overhearing what you said.  It was something about going  to do something though you didn't want to, and that it was part of your  'bit'. That sounds like soldier talk. Are you going to enlist, Tom?\"    \"No.\"    \"Um! Well, then--\"    \"It's something I can't talk about, Mr. Damon, even to you, as yet,\"  Tom said, and there was a new quality in his voice, at which his friend  looked up in some surprise.    \"Oh, of course, Tom, if it's a secret--\"    \"Well, it hasn't even got that far, as yet. It's all up in the air, so  to speak. I'll tell you in due season. But, speaking of the air, let's  go for a spin. It may drive some of the cobwebs out of my brain. Did I  hear you say you thought it would rain?\"    \"No, it's as clear as a bell. I said I hoped it wouldn't rain for the  sake of the soldiers in camp. They've had their share of wet weather,  and, goodness knows, they'll get more when they get to Flanders. It  seems to do nothing but rain in France.\"    \"It is damp,\" agreed Tom. \"And, come to think of it, they are going to  have some airship contests over at camp to-day--for the men who are  being trained to be aviators, you know.  It just occurred to me that we  might fly over there and watch them.\"    \"Fine!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"That's the very thing I should like. I'll  take a chance in your Hawk, Tom, if you'll promise not to try any  spiral stunts.\"    \"I promise, Mr. Damon. Come on! I'll have Koku run the machine out and  get her ready for a flight to Camp. It's a good day for a jaunt in the  air.\"    \"Get out the Hawk, Koku,\" ordered the young inventor, as he motioned to  a big man--a veritable giant--who nodded to show he understood. Koku  was really a giant, one of a race of strange beings, and Tom Swift had  brought the big man with him when he escaped from captivity, as those  will remember who have read that book.    \"Going far, Tom?\" asked an aged man, coming to the door of one of the  many buildings of which the shed where the airship was kept formed one.    \"Not very far, Father,\" answered the young inventor.  \"Mr. Damon and I  are going for a little spin over to Camp Grant, to see some aircraft  contests among the army birdmen.\"    \"Oh, all right, Tom. I just wanted to tell you that I think I've gotten  over that difficulty you found with the big carburetor you were working  on. You didn't say what you wanted it for, except that it was for a  heavy duty gasolene engine, and you couldn't get the needle valve to  work as you'd like. I think I've found a way.\"    \"Good, Dad! I'll look at it when I come back. That carburetor did  bother me, and if I can get that to work--well, maybe we'll have  something soon that will--\"    But Tom did not finish his sentence, for Koku was getting the aircraft  in operation and Mr. Damon was already taking his place behind the  pilot's seat, which would be occupied by Tom.    \"All ready, are you, Koku?\" asked the young inventor.    \"All ready, Master,\" answered the giant.    There was a roar like that of a machine gun as the Hawk's engine spun  the propeller, and then, after a little run across the sod, it mounted  into the air, carrying Tom and Mr. Damon with it.    \"Mind you, Tom, no stunts!\" called the visitor to the young inventor  through the speaking tube apparatus, which enabled a conversation to be  carried on, even above the roar of the powerful engine. \"Bless my  overshoes! if you try, looping the loop with me--\"    \"I won't do anything like that!\" promised Tom.    Away they soared, swift as a veritable hawk, and soon, after there had  unrolled below their eyes a succession of fields and forest, there came  into view rows and rows of small brown objects, among which beings,  like ants, seemed crawling about.    \"There's the Camp!\" exclaimed Tom.    \"I see,\" and Mr. Damon nodded.    As they approached, they saw, starting up from a green space amid the  brown tents, what appeared to be big bugs of a dirty white color  splotched with green.    \"The aircraft--and they have camouflage paint on,\" said Tom. \"We can  watch 'em from up here!\"    Mr. Damon nodded, though Tom could not see him, sitting in front of his  friend as he was.    Up and up circled the army aircraft, and they seemed to bow and nod a  greeting to the Hawk, which was soon in the midst of them. Tom and Mr.  Damon, flying high, though at no great speed, looked at the maneuvers  of the veterans and the learners--many of whom might soon be engaging  the Boches in far-off France.    \"Some of 'em are pretty good!\" called Tom, through the tube. \"That one  fellow did the loop as prettily as I've ever seen it done,\" and Tom  Swift had a right to speak as one of authority.    Tom and his friend watched the aircraft for some time, and then started  off in a long flight, attaining a high speed, which, at first, made Mr.  Damon gasp, until he became used to it. He was no novice at flying, and  had even operated aeroplanes himself, though at no great height.    Suddenly the Hawk seemed to falter, almost as does a bird stricken by a  hunter's gun. The craft seemed to hang in the air, losing motion as  though about to plunge to earth unguided.    \"What's the matter?\" cried Mr. Damon.    \"One of the control wires broken!\" was Tom's laconic answer. \"I'll have  to volplane down. Sit tight, there's no danger!\"    Mr. Damon knew that with so competent a pilot as Tom Swift in the  forward seat this was true, but, nevertheless, he was a bit nervous  until he felt the smooth, gliding motion, with now and then an upward  tilt, which showed that Tom was coming down from the upper regions in a  series of long glides. The engine had stopped, and the cessation of the  thundering noise made it possible for Tom and his passenger to talk  without the use of the speaking tube.    \"All right?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"All right,\" Tom answered, and a little later the machine was rolling  gently over the turf of a large field, a mile or so from the camp.    Before Tom and Mr. Damon could get out of their seats, a man, seemingly  springing up from some hollow in the ground, walked toward them.    \"Had an accident?\" he asked, in what he evidently meant for a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/955"],[0,"The Patchwork Girl of Oz (#1)"],[1,"PATCHWORK GIRL OF OZ      by    L. FRANK BAUM            Affectionately Dedicated to my young friend    Sumner Hamilton Britton of Chicago          Prologue    Through the kindness of Dorothy Gale of Kansas, afterward Princess  Dorothy of Oz, an humble writer in the United States of America was  once appointed Royal Historian of Oz, with the privilege of writing the  chronicle of that wonderful fairyland. But after making six books about  the adventures of those interesting but queer people who live in the  Land of Oz, the Historian learned with sorrow that by an edict of the  Supreme Ruler, Ozma of Oz, her country would thereafter be rendered  invisible to all who lived outside its borders and that all  communication with Oz would, in the future, be cut off.    The children who had learned to look for the books about Oz and who  loved the stories about the gay and happy people inhabiting that  favored country, were as sorry as their Historian that there would be  no more books of Oz stories. They wrote many letters asking if the  Historian did not know of some adventures to write about that had  happened before the Land of Oz was shut out from all the rest of the  world. But he did not know of any. Finally one of the children inquired  why we couldn't hear from Princess Dorothy by wireless telegraph, which  would enable her to communicate to the Historian whatever happened in  the far-off Land of Oz without his seeing her, or even knowing just  where Oz is.    That seemed a good idea; so the Historian rigged up a high tower in his  back yard, and took lessons in wireless telegraphy until he understood  it, and then began to call \"Princess Dorothy of Oz\" by sending messages  into the air.    Now, it wasn't likely that Dorothy would be looking for wireless  messages or would heed the call; but one thing the Historian was sure  of, and that was that the powerful Sorceress, Glinda, would know what  he was doing and that he desired to communicate with Dorothy. For  Glinda has a big book in which is recorded every event that takes place  anywhere in the world, just the moment that it happens, and so of  course the book would tell her about the wireless message.    And that was the way Dorothy heard that the Historian wanted to speak  with her, and there was a Shaggy Man in the Land of Oz who knew how to  telegraph a wireless reply. The result was that the Historian begged so  hard to be told the latest news of Oz, so that he could write it down  for the children to read, that Dorothy asked permission of Ozma and  Ozma graciously consented.    That is why, after two long years of waiting, another Oz story is now  presented to the children of America. This would not have been possible  had not some clever man invented the \"wireless\" and an equally clever  child suggested the idea of reaching the mysterious Land of Oz by its  means.    L.

Unc looked out of the window and stroked his long beard. Then he turned  to the Munchkin boy and shook his head.    \"Isn't,\" said he.    \"Isn't any butter? That's too bad, Unc. Where's the jam then?\" inquired  Ojo, standing on a stool so he could look through all the shelves of  the cupboard. But Unc Nunkie shook his head again.    \"Gone,\" he said.    \"No jam, either? And no cake--no jelly--no apples--nothing but bread?\"    \"All,\" said Unc, again stroking his beard as he gazed from the window.    The little boy brought the stool and sat beside his uncle, munching the  dry bread slowly and seeming in deep thought.    \"Nothing grows in our yard but the bread tree,\" he mused, \"and there  are only two more loaves on that tree; and they're not ripe yet. Tell  me, Unc; why are we so poor?\"    The old Munchkin turned and looked at Ojo. He had kindly eyes, but he  hadn't smiled or laughed in so long that the boy had forgotten that Unc  Nunkie could look any other way than solemn. And Unc never spoke any  more words than he was obliged to, so his little nephew, who lived  alone with him, had learned to understand a great deal from one word.    \"Why are we so poor, Unc?\" repeated the boy.    \"Not,\" said the old Munchkin.    \"I think we are,\" declared Ojo. \"What have we got?\"    \"House,\" said Unc Nunkie.    \"I know; but everyone in the Land of Oz has a place to live. What else,  Unc?\"    \"Bread.\"    \"I'm eating the last loaf that's ripe. There; I've put aside your  share, Unc. It's on the table, so you can eat it when you get hungry.  But when that is gone, what shall we eat, Unc?\"    The old man shifted in his chair but merely shook his head.    \"Of course,\" said Ojo, who was obliged to talk because his uncle would  not, \"no one starves in the Land of Oz, either. There is plenty for  everyone, you know; only, if it isn't just where you happen to be, you  must go where it is.\"    The aged Munchkin wriggled again and stared at his small nephew as if  disturbed by his argument.    \"By to-morrow morning,\" the boy went on, \"we must go where there is  something to eat, or we shall grow very hungry and become very unhappy.\"    \"Where?\" asked Unc.    \"Where shall we go? I don't know, I'm sure,\" replied Ojo. \"But you must  know, Unc. You must have traveled, in your time, because you're so old.  I don't remember it, because ever since I could remember anything we've  lived right here in this lonesome, round house, with a little garden  back of it and the thick woods all around. All I've ever seen of the  great Land of Oz, Unc dear, is the view of that mountain over at the  south, where they say the Hammerheads live--who won't let anybody go by  them--and that mountain at the north, where they say nobody lives.\"    \"One,\" declared Unc, correcting him.    \"Oh, yes; one family lives there, I've heard. That's the Crooked  Magician, who is named Dr. Pipt, and his wife Margolotte. One year you  told me about them; I think it took you a whole year, Unc, to say as  much as I've just said about the Crooked Magician and his wife. They  live high up on the mountain, and the good Munchkin Country, where the  fruits and flowers grow, is just the other side. It's funny you and I  should live here all alone, in the middle of the forest, isn't it?\"    \"Yes,\" said Unc.    \"Then let's go away and visit the Munchkin Country and its jolly,  good-natured people. I'd love to get a sight of something besides  woods, Unc Nunkie.\"    \"Too little,\" said Unc.    \"Why, I'm not so little as I used to be,\" answered the boy earnestly.  \"I think I can walk as far and as fast through the woods as you can,  Unc. And now that nothing grows in our back yard that is good to eat,  we must go where there is food.\"    Unc Nunkie made no reply for a time. Then he shut down the window and  turned his chair to face the room, for the sun was sinking behind the  tree-tops and it was growing cool.    By and by Ojo lighted the fire and the logs blazed freely in the broad  fireplace. The two sat in the firelight a long time--the old,  white-bearded Munchkin and the little boy. Both were thinking. When it  grew quite dark outside, Ojo said:    \"Eat your bread, Unc, and then we will go to bed.\"    But Unc Nunkie did not eat the bread; neither did he go directly to  bed. Long after his little nephew was sound asleep in the corner of the  room the old man sat by the fire, thinking.          Chapter Two    The Crooked Magician      Just at dawn next morning Unc Nunkie laid his hand tenderly on Ojo's  head and awakened him.    \"Come,\" he said.    Ojo dressed. He wore blue silk stockings, blue knee pants with gold  buckles, a blue ruffled waist and a jacket of bright blue braided with  gold. His shoes were of blue leather and turned up at the toes, which  were pointed. His hat had a peaked crown and a flat brim, and around  the brim was a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved.  This was the native costume of those who inhabited the Munchkin Country  of the Land of Oz, so Unc Nunkie's dress was much like that of his  nephew. Instead of shoes, the old man wore boots with turnover tops and  his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid.    The boy noticed that his uncle had not eaten the bread, and supposed  the old man had not been hungry. Ojo was hungry, though; so he divided  the piece of bread upon the table and ate his half for breakfast,  washing it down with fresh, cool water from the brook. Unc put the  other piece of bread in his jacket pocket, after which he again said,  as he walked out through the doorway: \"Come.\"    Ojo was well pleased. He was dreadfully tired of living all alone in  the woods and wanted to travel and see people. For a long time he had  wished to explore the beautiful Land of Oz in which they lived. When  they were outside, Unc simply latched the door and started up the path.  No one would disturb their little house, even if anyone came so far  into the thick forest while they were gone.
