[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14473"],[0,"Birds of Guernsey (1879) (#10)"],[1,"rule of the British Association the name \"_rufa_,\" given by  Boddaert in 1783, has now been accepted for this bird. I have not  generally thought it necessary to point out these changes, but in this  instance it seemed necessary to do so, as in the former edition of  'Yarrell' the Chiffchaff was called by the name _Sylvia rufa_, and this  might possibly have caused some confusion unless the change had been  pointed out.    The Whitethroat is by no means so common in the Channel Islands as it is  in England, and though a regular summer visitant it only makes its  appearance in small numbers. A few, however, may be seen about the  fields and hedgerows in the more cultivated parts of the country. It  certainly has not got the reputation for mischief in the garden it has  in England, as none of the gardeners I asked about it, and who were  complaining grievously of the mischief done by birds, ever mentioned the  Whitethroat, or knew the bird when asked about it.    Professor Ansted includes the bird in his list, and restricts it to  Guernsey, but I see no reason why it should not occur equally in Sark  and Herm. There is no specimen at present in the Museum.      39. LESSER WHITETHROAT. _Sylvia curruca_, Linnaeus. French, \"Bee-fin  babillard.\"--Like the Whitethroat, the Lesser Whitethroat is a regular,  but by no means a numerous summer visitant to Guernsey. I saw a few in  the willow-hedges about the Grand Mare, and in one or two other places  near there, and young Le Cheminant had one or two eggs in his  collection, probably taken about L'Eree.    The Lesser Whitethroat is included in Professor Ansted's list, and only  marked as occurring in Guernsey. There is at present no specimen in the  Museum.      40. BLACKCAP. _Sylvia atricapilla_, Linnaeus. French, \"Fauvette a tete  noire,\" \"Bec-fin a tete noire.\"--Though generally known as the Guernsey  Nightingale, the Blackcap, though a regular, is by no means a numerous  summer visitant. I have, however, always seen a few about every time I  have been in the Island in the summer. There are a few eggs in the  Museum, and in Le Cheminant's collection.    The Blackcap is mentioned by Professor Ansted in his list, and  restricted to Guernsey. There is only one specimen--a female--at present  in the Museum.      41. WILLOW WREN. _Phylloscopus trochilus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Bee-fin  Pouillat.\"--The Willow Wren is a tolerably numerous summer visitant, I  believe, to all the Islands, though I have only seen it myself in  Guernsey and Sark. In Guernsey I have seen it about the Grand Mare, and  in some trees near the road about St. George, and about the Vallon on  the other side of the Island. It remains all the summer and breeds.    Professor Ansted has not included it in his list, although it seems  tolerably well known, and has a local name \"D'mouaiselle,\" which Mr.  Metivier, in his 'Dictionary,' applies to the Willow Wren of the  English. This name, however, is probably equally applicable to the  Chiffchaff.      42. CHIFFCHAFF. _Phylloscopus collybita_, Vieillot. French, \"Bee-fin  veloce.\"--The Chiffchaff is certainly more common in Guernsey than the  Willow Wren. In Guernsey I have seen it in several places; about Candie,  where a pair had a nest this summer in the mowing-grass before the  house; near the Vallon; and about St. George. I have also seen it in  Sark, but not in either of the other Islands, though no doubt it occurs  in Herm, if not in Alderney.    It is mentioned by Professor Ansted as occurring in Guernsey and Sark. I  have never seen the Wood Wren in Guernsey, and, judging from its  favourite habitations here in Somerset, I should not think it at all  likely to remain in the Channel Islands through the summer, though an  occasional straggler may touch the Islands on migration. There is no  specimen of either the Chiffchaff or Willow Wren in the Museum.      43. GOLDEN-CRESTED WREN. _Regulus cristatus_, Koch. French, \"Roitelet  ordinaire.\"--The Golden-crest is resident in the Islands, but not very  numerous, and I doubt if its numbers are regularly increased in the  autumn by migrants, as is the case in the Eastern Counties of England.  Migratory flocks, however, sometimes make their appearance; and Mr.  MacCulloch writes to me--\"The Golden-crest occasionally comes over in  large flocks, apparently from Normandy, flying before bad weather. This,  however, cannot be said to have been the cause of the large flight that  appeared here so recently as the last days in April,\" 1878. This flock  was mentioned in the 'Star' of April the 27th as follows:--\"A countryman  informs us that a few days since, whilst he was at L'ancresse Common, he  saw several flocks of these smallest of British birds, numbering many  hundreds in each, settle in different parts of the Common before  dispersing over the Island. In verification of his words he showed us  two or three of these tiny songsters which he had succeeded in knocking  down with a stick.\" This large migratory flock had entirely disappeared  from L'ancresse Common when we went to live there for two months in May  of the same year; there was not then a Golden Crest to be seen about the  Common. The whole flock had probably resumed their journey together,  none of them having \"dispersed over\" or remained in the Island, and  certainly, as far as I could judge, the numbers in other parts of the  Island had not increased beyond what was usual and one might ordinarily  expect. I have not been able to learn that the migratory flock above  spoken of extended to any of the other Islands.    The Golden-crested Wren is mentioned by Professor Ansted, and marked as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There are two--a male and female--in the  Museum.      44. FIRE-CRESTED WREN. _Regulus ignicapillus_, C.L. Brehm. French,  \"Roitelet a triple bandeau.\"--I have a pair of these killed in Guernsey  about 1872, but I have not the exact date; and Mr. Couch, who knew the  Fire-crested Wren well, writing to me on the 23rd of March, 1877,  says:--\"I had the head and part of a Fire-crest female brought me by a  young lady. She told me her brother knocked down two, and the other had  a beautiful red and gold crest; so it must have been the male.\" As Mr.  Couch knew both the Goldcrest and Fire-crest well, and the distinction  between them, I have no doubt he rightly identified the bird which was  brought to him. These and the pair in my collection are the only  Guernsey specimens I can be certain of.    The 'Star' newspaper, however, in the note above quoted as to the  migratory flock of Golden-crests, says:--\"It may be a fact hitherto  unknown to many of our readers that the Fire-crested Wren, very similar  in appearance to the Golden-crested Wren, is not very uncommon in our  Island. The Fire-crested Wren so closely resembles its _confrere_, the  Golden-crested Wren, that only a practised eye can distinguish the  difference between them.\" I do not quite agree with the 'Star' as to the  Fire-crest not being \"very uncommon,\" though it occasionally occurs. I  do not think it can be considered as anything but a rare occasional  straggler. And this from its geographical distribution, which is rather  limited, is what one would expect; it is not very common on the nearest  coast of France or England, though it occasionally occurs about Torbay,  which is not very far distant.    The name Fire-crest has probably led to many mistakes between this bird  and the Golden-crest, as a brightly-coloured male Gold-crest has the  golden part of the crest quite as bright and as deeply coloured as the  Fire-crest; and the female Fire-crest has a crest not a bit more deeply  coloured than the female Gold-crest. In point of fact the colour of the  crest is of no value whatever in distinguishing between the birds, and  the \"practised eye\" would find itself puzzled if it only relied upon  that.    The French name for the Fire-crest, however, \"Roitelet a triple  bandeau,\" is much more descriptive, as under the golden part of the  crest there is a streak of black, and under that again a streak of white  over the eye, and a streak of black through the eye; there is also a  streak, or rather perhaps a spot of white, under the eye. The Gold-crest  has only the streak of black immediately under the gold crest; below  that the whole of the side of the face and the space immediately  surrounding the eye is a uniform dull olive-green. If this distinction  is once known and attended to the difference between the two birds may  be immediately detected by even the unpractised eye.    A very interesting account of the nesting of this bird is given by Mr.  Dresser, in his 'Birds of Europe,' he having made a journey to  Altenkirchen, where the Fire-crest is numerous, on purpose to watch it  in the breeding-season. The nest he describes as very like that of the  Golden-crest; the eggs also are much like those of that bird, though a  little redder in colour.    The Fire-crest is not mentioned in Professor Ansted's list, and there is  no specimen at present in the Museum.      45. WREN. _Troglodytes parvulus_, K.L. Koch. French, \"Roitelet,\"  \"Troglodyte mignon,\" \"Troglodyte ordinaire.\"--The Wren is common and  resident in all the Islands, and very generally distributed, being  almost as common amongst the wild rocks on the coast as in the inland  parts. On the 7th of July, 1878, I found a Wren's nest amongst some of  the wildest rocks in the Island; the hinder part of the nest was wedged  into a small crevice in the rock very firmly, the nest projecting and  apparently only just stuck against the face of the rock. A great deal of  material had been used, and the nest, projecting from the face of the  rock as it did, looked large, and when I first caught sight of it I  thought I might have hit upon an old Water Ouzel's nest. On getting  close, however, I found it was only a Wren's, with young birds in it. I  visited this nest several times, and saw the old bird feeding her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#10)"],[1,"is, in fact, produced by a forty-zinc power of burning: it is a  power that I can carry about in my hands, through these wires, at  pleasure--although, if I applied it wrongly to myself, it would destroy me  in an instant, for it is a most intense thing, and the power you see here  put forth while you count five [bringing the poles in contact, and  exhibiting the electric light] is equivalent to the power of several  thunder-storms, so great is its force[14]. And that you may see what  intense energy it has, I will take the ends of the wires which convey the  power from the battery, and with it I dare say I can burn this iron file.  Now, this is a chemical power, and one which, when we next meet, I shall  apply to water, and shew you what results we are able to produce.          LECTURE IV.    HYDROGEN IN THE CANDLE--BURNS INTO WATER--THE OTHER PART OF WATER--OXYGEN.    I see you are not tired of the candle yet, or I am sure you would not be  interested in the subject in the way you are. When our candle was burning,  we found it produced water exactly like the water we have around us; and  by further examination of this water we found in it that curious body,  hydrogen--that light substance of which there is some in this jar. We  afterwards saw the burning powers of that hydrogen, and that it produced  water. And I think I introduced to your notice an apparatus which I very  briefly said was an arrangement of chemical force, or power, or energy, so  adjusted as to convey its power to us in these wires; and I said I should  use that force to pull the water to pieces, to see what else there was in  the water besides hydrogen; because, you remember, when we passed the  water through the iron tube, we by no means got the weight of water back  which we put in, in the form of steam, though we had a very large quantity  of gas evolved. We have now to see what is the other substance present.  That you may understand the character and use of this instrument, let us  make an experiment or two. Let us put together, first of all, some  substances, knowing what they are, and then see what that instrument does  to them. There is some copper (observe the various changes which it can  undergo), and here is some nitric acid, and you will find that this, being  a strong chemical agent, will act very powerfully when I add it to the  copper. It is now sending forth a beautiful red vapour; but as we do not  want that vapour, Mr. Anderson will hold it near the chimney for a short  time, that we may have the use and beauty of the experiment without the  annoyance. The copper which I have put into the flask will dissolve: it  will change the acid and the water into a blue fluid, containing copper  and other things; and I propose then shewing you how this voltaic battery  deals with it; and in the mean-time we will arrange another kind of  experiment for you to see what power it has. This is a substance which is  to us like water--that is to say, it contains bodies which we do not know  of as yet, as water contains a body which we do not know as yet. Now, this  solution of a salt[15] I will put upon paper, and spread about, and apply  the power of the battery to it, and observe what will happen. Three or  four important things will happen which we shall take advantage of. I  place this wetted paper upon a sheet of tinfoil, which is convenient for  keeping all clean, and also for the advantageous application of the power;  and this solution, you see, is not at all affected by being put upon the  paper or tinfoil, nor by anything else I have brought in contact with it  yet, and which, therefore, is free to us to use as regards that  instrument. But first let us see that our instrument is in order. Here are  our wires. Let us see whether it is in the state in which it was last  time. We can soon tell. As yet, when I bring them together, we have no  power, because the conveyers--what we call the electrodes--the passages or  ways for the electricity--are stopped; but now Mr. Anderson by that  [referring to a sudden flash at the ends of the wires] has given me a  telegram to say that it is ready. Before I begin our experiment I will get  Mr. Anderson to break contact again at the battery behind me, and we will  put a platinum-wire across to connect the poles, and then if I find I can  ignite a pretty good length of this wire, we shall be safe in our  experiment. Now you will see the power. [The connection was established,  and the intermediate wire became red-hot.] There is the power running  beautifully through the wire, which I have made thin on purpose to shew  you that we have those powerful forces; and now, having that power, we  will proceed with it to the examination of water.    I have here two pieces of platinum, and if I lay them down upon this piece  of paper [the moistened paper on the tinfoil], you will see no action; and  if I take them up, there is no change that you can see, but the  arrangement remains just as it was before. But, now, see what happens: if  I take these two poles and put either one or the other of them down  separately on the platinum-plates, they do nothing for me, both are  perfectly without action; but if I let them both be in contact at the same  moment, see what happens [a brown spot appeared under each pole of the  battery]. Look here at the effect that takes place, and see how I have  pulled something apart from the white--something brown; and I have no  doubt, if I were to arrange it thus, and were to put one of the poles to  the tinfoil on the other side of the paper--why, I get such a beautiful  action upon the paper, that I am going to see whether I cannot write with  it--a telegram, if you please. [The Lecturer here traced the word  \"juvenile\" on the paper with one of the terminal wires.] See there how  beautifully we can get our results!    You see we have here drawn something, which we have not known about  before, out of this solution. Let us now take that flask from Mr.  Andersen's hands, and see what we can draw out of that. This, you know, is  a liquid which we have just made up from copper and nitric acid, whilst  our other experiments were in hand; and though I am making this experiment  very hastily, and may bungle a little, yet I prefer to let you see what I  do rather than prepare it beforehand.    Now, see what happens. These two platinum-plates are the two ends (or I  will make them so immediately) of this apparatus; and I am about to put  them in contact with that solution just as we did a moment ago on the  paper. It does not matter to us whether the solution be on the paper or  whether it be in the jar, so long as we bring the ends of the apparatus to  it. If I put the two platinums in by themselves, they come out as clean  and as white as they go in [inserting them into the fluid without  connecting them with the battery]; but when we take the power and lay that  on [the platinums were connected with the battery and again dipped into  the solution], this, you see [exhibiting one of the platinums], is at once  turned into copper, as it were: it has become like a plate of copper; and  that [exhibiting the other piece of platinum] has come out quite clean. If  I take this coppered piece and change sides, the copper will leave the  right-hand side and come over to the left side; what was before the  coppered plate comes out clean, and the plate which was clean comes out  coated with copper; and thus you see that the same copper we put into this  solution we can also take out of it by means of this instrument.    Putting that solution aside, let us now see what effect this instrument  will have upon water. Here are two little platinum-plates which I intend  to make the ends of the battery, and this (C) is a little vessel so shaped  as to enable me to take it to pieces, and shew you its construction. In  these two cups (A and B) I pour mercury, which touches the ends of the  wires connected with the platinum-plates. In the vessel (C) I pour some  water containing a little acid (but which is put only for the purpose of  facilitating the action; it undergoes no change in the process), and  connected with the top of the vessel is a bent glass tube (D), which may  remind you of the pipe which was connected with the gun barrel in our  furnace experiment, and which now passes under the jar (F).  I have now  adjusted this apparatus, and we will proceed to affect the water in some  way or other. In the other case, I sent the water through a tube which was  made red-hot; I am now going to pass the electricity through the contents  of this vessel.  Perhaps I may boil the water; if I do boil the water, I  shall get steam; and you know that steam condenses when it gets cold, and  you will therefore see by that whether I do boil the water or not.  Perhaps, however, I shall not boil the water, but produce some other  effect.  You shall have the experiment and see. There is one wire which I  will put to this side (A), and here is the other wire which I will put to  the other side (B), and you will soon see whether any disturbance takes  place. Here it is seeming to boil up famously; but does it boil? Let us  see whether that which goes out is steam or not. I think you will soon see  the jar (F) will be filled with vapour, if that which rises from the water  is steam. But can it be steam? Why, certainly not; because there it  remains, you see, unchanged.  There it is standing over the water, and it  cannot therefore be steam, but must be a permanent gas of some sort What  is it? Is it hydrogen? Is it anything else? Well, we will examine it. If  it is hydrogen, it will burn. [The Lecturer then ignited a portion of the  gas collected, which burnt with an explosion.]    [Illustration: Fig. 19]    It is certainly something combustible, but not combustible in the way that  hydrogen is. Hydrogen would not have given you that noise; but the colour  of that light, when the thing did burn, was like that"]]]
