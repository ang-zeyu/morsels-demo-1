Then  understood he that he would gain immortality when, like the stone, he  was buried in the earth, and that his hour was come, for the earth  beneath him was iron, and his iron buckler was his vault of heaven  above. So he died.    _Alexander and the Robber_. When Dion'ides, a pirate, was brought  before Alexander, he exclaimed, \"Vile brigand! How dare you infest  the seas with your misdeeds?\" \"And you,\" replied the pirate, \"by what  right do you ravage the world? Because I have only one ship, I  am called a brigand, but you who have a whole fleet are termed a  conqueror.\" Alexander admired the man's boldness, and commanded him to  be set at liberty.    _Alexander's Beard_, a smooth chin, or a very small beard. It is said  that Alexander the Great had scarcely any beard at all.      Disgraced yet with Alexander's bearde.    G. Gascoigne, _The Steele Glas_ (died 1577).    _Alexander's Runner_, Ladas.

ALFRED AS A GLEEMAN. Alfred, wishing to know the strength of the  Danish camp, assumed the disguise of a minstrel, and stayed in the  Danish camp for several days, amusing the soldiers with his harping  and singing. After he had made himself master of all he required,  he returned back to his own place.--William of Malmesbury (twelfth  century).    William of Malmesbury tells a similar story of Anlaf, a Danish king,  who, he says, just before the battle of Brunanburh, in Northumberland,  entered the camp of king Athelstan as a gleeman, harp in hand; and so  pleased was the English king that he gave him gold. Anlaf would not  keep the gold, but buried it in the earth.    ALGARSIFE (3 _syl_.), and Cam'ballo, sons of Cambuscan' king of  Tartary, and Elfeta his wife. Algarsife married Theodora.

ALICHI'NO. a devil in Dante's _Inferno_.    ALICIA gave her heart to Mosby, but married Arden for his position. As  a wife, she played falsely with her husband, and even joined Mosby in  a plot to murder him. Vacillating between love for Mosby and  respect for Arden, she repents, and goes on sinning; wishes to get  disentangled, but is overmastered by Mosby's stronger will. Alicia's  passions impel her to evil, but her judgment accuses her and prompts  her to the right course. She halts, and parleys with sin, like Balaam,  and of course is lost.--Anon., _Arden of Feversham_ (1592).    _Alic'ia_, \"a laughing, toying, wheedling, whimpering she,\" who once  held lord Hastings under her distaff, but her annoying jealousy,  \"vexatious days, and jarring, joyless nights,\" drove him away from  her. Being jealous of Jane Shore, she accused her to the duke of  Gloster of alluring lord Hastings from his allegiance, and the lord  protector soon trumped up a charge against both; the lord chamberlain  he ordered to execution for treason, and Jane Shore he persecuted for  witchcraft.

ALIFAN'FARON, emperor of the island Trap'oban, a Mahometan, the suitor  of Pentap'olin's daughter, a Christian.

Instead of fulfilling his  mother's charge, he was himself \"falsely and feloniously slain\" by  king Mark.--Sir T. Malory, _History of King Arthur_, ii. 119-125  (1470).    AL'ISON, the young wife of John, a rich old miserly carpenter.  Absolon, a priggish parish clerk, paid her attention, but she herself  loved a poor scholar named Nicholas, lodging in her husband's house.  Fair she was, and her body lithe as a weasel. She had a rouguish eye,  small eyebrows, was \"long as a mast and upright as a bolt,\" more  \"pleasant to look on than a flowering pear tree,\" and her skin \"was  softer than the wool of a wether.\"--Chaucer, \"The Miller's Tale,\"  _Canterbury Tales_, (1388).    _Al'ison_, in sir W.

ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL, a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11438"],[0,"The Willows (#10)"],[1,"instructions, which I knew instinctively were true, \"but the wind, of  course--\"    \"I know. But the wind won't account for all the noises.\"    \"Then you heard it too?\"    \"The multiplying countless little footsteps I heard,\" he said, adding,  after a moment's hesitation, \"and that other sound--\"    \"You mean above the tent, and the pressing down upon us of something  tremendous, gigantic?\"    He nodded significantly.    \"It was like the beginning of a sort of inner suffocation?\" I said.    \"Partly, yes. It seemed to me that the weight of the atmosphere had been  altered--had increased enormously, so that we should have been crushed.\"    \"And that,\" I went on, determined to have it all out, pointing upwards  where the gong-like note hummed ceaselessly, rising and falling like wind.  \"What do you make of that?\"    \"It's their sound,\" he whispered gravely. \"It's the sound of their world,  the humming in their region. The division here is so thin that it leaks  through somehow. But, if you listen carefully, you'll find it's not above  so much as around us. It's in the willows. It's the willows themselves  humming, because here the willows have been made symbols of the forces that  are against us.\"    I could not follow exactly what he meant by this, yet the thought and idea  in my mind were beyond question the thought and idea in his. I realized  what he realized, only with less power of analysis than his. It was on the  tip of my tongue to tell him at last about my hallucination of the  ascending figures and the moving bushes, when he suddenly thrust his face  again close into mine across the firelight and began to speak in a very  earnest whisper. He amazed me by his calmness and pluck, his apparent  control of the situation. This man I had for years deemed unimaginative,  stolid!    \"Now listen,\" he said. \"The only thing for us to do is to go on as though  nothing had happened, follow our usual habits, go to bed, and so forth;  pretend we feel nothing and notice nothing. It is a question wholly of the  mind, and the less we think about them the better our chance of escape.  Above all, don't think, for what you think happens!\"    \"All right,\" I managed to reply, simply breathless with his words and the  strangeness of it all; \"all right, I'll try, but tell me one more thing  first. Tell me what you make of those hollows in the ground all about us,  those sand-funnels?\"    \"No!\" he cried, forgetting to whisper in his excitement. \"I dare not,  simply dare not, put the thought into words. If you have not guessed I am  glad. Don't try to. They have put it into my mind; try your hardest to  prevent their putting it into yours.\"    He sank his voice again to a whisper before he finished, and I did not  press him to explain. There was already just about as much horror in me as  I could hold. The conversation came to an end, and we smoked our pipes  busily in silence.    Then something happened, something unimportant apparently, as the way is  when the nerves are in a very great state of tension, and this small thing  for a brief space gave me an entirely different point of view. I chanced to  look down at my sand-shoe--the sort we used for the canoe--and something to  do with the hole at the toe suddenly recalled to me the London shop where I  had bought them, the difficulty the man had in fitting me, and other  details of the uninteresting but practical operation. At once, in its  train, followed a wholesome view of the modern skeptical world I was  accustomed to move in at home. I thought of roast beef, and ale,  motor-cars, policemen, brass bands, and a dozen other things that  proclaimed the soul of ordinariness or utility. The effect was immediate  and astonishing even to myself. Psychologically, I suppose, it was simply a  sudden and violent reaction after the strain of living in an atmosphere of  things that to the normal consciousness must seem impossible and  incredible. But, whatever the cause, it momentarily lifted the spell from  my heart, and left me for the short space of a minute feeling free and  utterly unafraid. I looked up at my friend opposite.    \"You damned old pagan!\" I cried, laughing aloud in his face. \"You  imaginative idiot! You superstitious idolater! You--\"    I stopped in the middle, seized anew by the old horror. I tried to smother  the sound of my voice as something sacrilegious. The Swede, of course,  heard it too--the strange cry overhead in the darkness--and that sudden  drop in the air as though something had come nearer.    He had turned ashen white under the tan. He stood bolt upright in front of  the fire, stiff as a rod, staring at me.    \"After that,\" he said in a sort of helpless, frantic way, \"we must go! We  can't stay now; we must strike camp this very instant and go on--down the  river.\"    He was talking, I saw, quite wildly, his words dictated by abject  terror--the terror he had resisted so long, but which had caught him at  last.    \"In the dark?\" I exclaimed, shaking with fear after my hysterical outburst,  but still realizing our position better than he did. \"Sheer madness! The  river's in flood, and we've only got a single paddle. Besides, we only go  deeper into their country! There's nothing ahead for fifty miles but  willows, willows, willows!\"    He sat down again in a state of semi-collapse. The positions, by one of  those kaleidoscopic changes nature loves, were suddenly reversed, and the  control of our forces passed over into my hands. His mind at last had  reached the point where it was beginning to weaken.    \"What on earth possessed you to do such a thing?\" he whispered with the awe  of genuine terror in his voice and face.    I crossed round to his side of the fire. I took both his hands in mine,  kneeling down beside him and looking straight into his frightened eyes.    \"We'll make one more blaze,\" I said firmly, \"and then turn in for the  night. At sunrise we'll be off full speed for Komorn. Now, pull yourself  together a bit, and remember your own advice about not thinking fear!\"    He said no more, and I saw that he would agree and obey. In some measure,  too, it was a sort of relief to get up and make an excursion into the  darkness for more wood. We kept close together, almost touching, groping  among the bushes and along the bank. The humming overhead never ceased, but  seemed to me to grow louder as we increased our distance from the fire. It  was shivery work!    We were grubbing away in the middle of a thickish clump of willows where  some driftwood from a former flood had caught high among the branches, when  my body was seized in a grip that made me half drop upon the sand. It was  the Swede. He had fallen against me, and was clutching me for support. I  heard his breath coming and going in short gasps.    \"Look! By my soul!\" he whispered, and for the first time in my experience I  knew what it was to hear tears of terror in a human voice. He was pointing  to the fire, some fifty feet away. I followed the direction of his finger,  and I swear my heart missed a beat.    There, in front of the dim glow, something was moving.    I saw it through a veil that hung before my eyes like the gauze  drop-curtain used at the back of a theater--hazily a little. It was neither  a human figure nor an animal. To me it gave the strange impression of being  as large as several animals grouped together, like horses, two or three,  moving slowly. The Swede, too, got a similar result, though expressing it  differently, for he thought it was shaped and sized like a clump of willow  bushes, rounded at the top, and moving all over upon its surface--\"coiling  upon itself like smoke,\" he said afterwards.    \"I watched it settle downwards through the bushes,\" he sobbed at me. \"Look,  by God! It's coming this way! Oh, oh!\"--he gave a kind of whistling cry.  \"They've found us.\"    I gave one terrified glance, which just enabled me to see that the shadowy  form was swinging towards us through the bushes, and then I collapsed  backwards with a crash into the branches. These failed, of course, to  support my weight, so that with the Swede on top of me we fell in a  struggling heap upon the sand. I really hardly knew what was happening. I  was conscious only of a sort of enveloping sensation of icy fear that  plucked the nerves out of their fleshly covering, twisted them this way and  that, and replaced them quivering. My eyes were tightly shut; something in  my throat choked me; a feeling that my consciousness was expanding,  extending out into space, swiftly gave way to another feeling that I was  losing it altogether, and about to die.    An acute spasm of pain passed through me, and I was aware that the Swede  had hold of me in such a way that he hurt me abominably. It was the way he  caught at me in falling.    But it was the pain, he declared afterwards, that saved me; it caused me to  forget them and think of something else at the very instant when they were  about to find me. It concealed my mind from them at the moment of  discovery, yet just in time to evade their terrible seizing of me. He  himself, he says, actually swooned at the same moment, and that was what  saved him.    I only know that at a later date, how long or short is impossible to say, I  found myself scrambling up out of the slippery network of willow branches,  and saw my companion standing in front of me holding out a hand to assist  me. I stared at him in a dazed way, rubbing the arm he had twisted for me.  Nothing came to me to say, somehow.    \"I lost consciousness for a moment or two,\" I heard him say. \"That's what  saved me. It made me stop thinking about them.\"    \"You nearly broke my arm in two,\" I said, uttering my only connected  thought at the moment. A numbness came over me.    \"That's what saved you!\" he replied. \"Between us, we've managed to set them  off on a false tack somewhere. The humming has ceased. It's gone--for the  moment at any rate!\"    A wave of hysterical laughter"]]]
