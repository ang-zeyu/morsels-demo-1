You can count  on him doin' the right thing every time. He'll pull 'most as strong as  McMillan, and he sure was good not to chew Queen up, the way she tackled  him. But I don't know,\" judicially, \"that we can make a real racer of  him. He don't seem to have just the racin' spirit. He ain't keen for it,  like Spot. But he's a bully all 'round dog, just the same.\"    \"Mebbe it's cause he don't understand the game,\" answered Ben loyally.  \"Moose Jones allers said that Baldy had plenty o' spirit; an' I kinda  think he's like the ship she was tellin' us about the other day. He  ain't really found himself yet.\"    The Woman, perfectly unconscious that she was penetrating into a serious  and secret Conclave of an Ancient and Honorable Order, came into the  Kennel with the evening paper.    It contained an article complimenting George upon his skill in managing  a difficult team, and upon introducing Spot, an infant prodigy, to the  racing world of the North. Then it announced, in a delicate vein of  sarcasm, that one of the wheel dogs had been the most recent notable  addition to the Allan and Darling Kennel--Baldy, late of Golconda, now  of Nome, \"a likely Sweepstakes Winner.\" At which the Woman had sniffed  audibly, and \"Scotty\" had chuckled amiably. But Ben Edwards crept that  night into his hard cot with the paper tightly clasped in his grimy  hand, to dream of Baldy's future triumphs.    [Illustration]          V    The Woman, The Racers, and Others    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    CHAPTER V    THE WOMAN, THE RACERS, AND OTHERS      Even after the boys' race, when George and Dan often singled him out for  special use, and the joy of a run with Ben Edwards was almost an  inevitable part of the day's program, there were still a number of  matters that were distinctly trying to Baldy.    He could not, for one thing, quite figure out the Woman, nor reconcile  himself to her constant presence and aimless wanderings about the place.    When \"Scotty\" and Matt, or even Danny and George came in, it was for  some evident purpose; when the boy appeared, it was to see him  exclusively, but it was different with her.    She apparently loved all of the dogs, but she had no idea of discipline,  and casually suggested all sorts of foolish and revolutionary privileges  for them that would have meant ruin in no time.    She held the tiniest puppies in her lap when she should have known it  was not good for them, spent hours playing with the young dogs with no  attempt at training; and he could not forget that she had tried, the  first day he had ever met her, to drag him ignominiously into her sled.    Even Ben's evident friendliness toward her did not overcome Baldy's  disapproval, though he frequently went with them for long walks which  would have been far more agreeable could he have been with the boy  alone. She quite monopolized his chum, talking so earnestly that the dog  was almost ignored, and could only trot along with the consolation that  Ben shared was better than Ben absent.    Then, too, she was not in the least discriminating, and told Tom, who  perhaps had as many faults as any member of the team, that he had an  \"angel face\"; spoke of Dick and Harry, clever imitators of their  brother's misdeeds, as \"The Heavenly Twins\"; and alluded to Irish and  Rover, gentle Irish Setters, as \"Red Devils,\" which was so rankly unjust  that Baldy, who knew not automobiles, was amazed at her stupidity. To  Baldy the word \"Devil\" had an evil sound, for when he had heard it at  Golconda it was generally associated with a kick or a blow. She even  ostentatiously walked past the chained dogs sometimes, carrying fluffy  Jimmie Gibson, the baby blue fox from the Kobuk, which was tantalizing  to a degree. But when she let Jack McMillan put his paws on her  shoulders, and lay his big head against her cheek, calling him a  \"perfect lamb\" or a \"poor dear martyr,\" in a tone that betrayed  affectionate sympathy, Baldy turned away in disgust.    As a matter of fact these attentions and endearments were exceedingly  unwise, for they were invariably directed toward the very dogs who were  most apt to over-value physical charm and ingratiating tricks of manner.    But there was one thing more objectionable still that could be laid at  her door--she was constantly lowering the general tone of the Kennel.    The stables where the Racers were kept gave shelter, also, to a few  others whose merits warranted their sharing in the special care bestowed  upon the fleet-footed Sweepstakes Winners. The latter all carried  themselves with a conscious dignity that befitted their fame and  aspirations; but gradually Baldy noticed that through the Woman there  were being introduced a number of ordinary strangers who made use of the  place, and were housed and fed, till it began to look like a transient  dog hotel.    She brought them because they were tired and hungry, lame, halt or  blind; or worse still, just because they \"seemed to like her.\" No reason  was too trivial, no dog too worthless. Matt shamelessly upheld her,  \"Scotty\" submitted, while Baldy sulkily glowered at these encumbrances  who were more fit for the pound than the Allan and Darling Racing  Stables. For Baldy had but one criterion; that of efficiency as the  result of honest endeavor. And it was indeed a trial for a conscientious  plodder to see the ease with which idle canines possessed themselves of  the comforts and privileges that by right belong alone to those whose  industry has earned them.    Had Baldy been a French Poodle, with little tufts of hair cut in  circles round his ankles, and a kinky lock tied with a splashing bow  over his eyes, he would probably, with delicate disdain, have thought of  her as lacking in \"esprit de corps.\" As it was, being but a blunt  Alaskan, he growled rather sullenly when she came too near, and  considered that she had no more dog-pride than an Eskimo; and Baldy's  contempt for her could suggest no more scathing comparison.    There was no jealousy in his objections, for he now fairly gloried in  the sensation that Kid, Irish or McMillan created when they were in the  lead; and as the two latter at least were dogs that were coldly  indifferent to him, this was surely a test of his unselfishness.    He was perfectly willing, also, to welcome \"classy\" dogs, as George and  Dan called them, like Stefansson, Lipton, or dainty Margaret Winston,  from Kentucky. He even understood there were dogs, neither Workers nor  Racers, who had gained a kind of popular distinction that was recognized  by both the human and canine population of the City; and while it was  impossible for him to comprehend the _reason_, he accepted the _fact_  philosophically.    There was, for instance, Oolik Lomen, who was born on Amundsen's ship  the \"Gjoa\" when on the voyage that resulted in the discovery of the  Northwest Passage. Possibly on account of his celebrated birthplace, or  because of his unusual appearance, Oolik was haughty to the verge of  insolence; and to Baldy he represented the culmination of all the  charming but useless graces of the idle rich. He did nothing but lie on  the Lomen porch on a soft rug, or wander about with a doll in his mouth,  much as a certain type of woman lolls through life carrying a lap dog.    Then there was the tramp Nomie, the pet of the Miners' Union, and the  Fire Department. This fox terrier was a constant attendant at all  important affairs of the town--social or political--at parades,  christenings, weddings, and even funerals. At concerts or at the theatre  he walked out upon the stage, and waited quietly near the wings till the  program was finished. He went to church quite regularly, but was  non-sectarian, and was just as apt to appear at the Eskimo Mission  Chapel as at St. Mary's when the Bishop preached.    Rarely did he fail to be at all Council Meetings, informal receptions,  and formal balls. At these he was untiring, and would select a couple  for each dance and follow them through the mazes of the waltz and  one-step with great dexterity; visiting between times with his many  acquaintances.    The knowledge that Nomie assisted at every fire, and at all of the  drills of the Life Saving Crew on the beach made Baldy feel that these  social diversions were only an outlet for abundant vitality, since there  were not fires and wrecks enough to keep him busy; and a poor little fox  terrier, no matter _how_ ambitious, is debarred by his size from the  noble sport of racing, or the more prosaic business career of  freighting.    So it really seemed, on the whole, that Baldy was exceedingly liberal in  his estimate of dogs in general. And it was only his desire for a high  standard in his own Kennel that prompted his aversion to those waifs and  strays that she collected; who, of no possible use, were neither  professional beauties like Oolik, nor society favorites like Nomie, and  so really had no claim to any sort of recognition.    Neither did Baldy, because of his new associations and ambitions, gauge  his opinions of all dogs by racing tests alone. He still believed  implicitly in the dignity of labor; and his early residence amongst  freighters had enabled him to recognize the fact that endurance and good  common dog-sense are often of more value, even in a racing team, than  speed and mere pride of carriage.    In the occasional intervals when no feminine presence upset the calm and  system of his surroundings, there were periods when Baldy watched  intently the habits and characteristics of the other dogs, and tried to  fit himself to become a candidate for the Racing Team.    In this he was assisted by the boy, who was just as carefully studying  Allan's methods with his dogs, and putting them in practice "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11772"],[0,"Narrative of a Voyage to Senegal in 1816 (#10)"],[1,"unhappy wretches, having their lower extremities entangled in the  openings between the pieces of the raft, had not been able to disengage  themselves, and had lost their lives; several others had been carried off  by the violence of the sea. At the hour of repast we took fresh numbers, in  order to leave no break in the series: we missed twenty men: we will not  affirm that this number is very exact, for we found that some soldiers, in  order to have more than their ration, took two, and even three numbers. We  were so many persons crowded together, that it was absolutely impossible to  prevent these abuses.    Amidst these horrors, an affecting scene of filial piety forced us to shed  tears: two young men raised and recognised, for their father, an  unfortunate man who was stretched senseless under the feet of the people;  at first, they thought he was dead, and their despair expressed itself by  the most affecting lamentations; it was perceived, however, that this  almost inanimate body still had breath; we lavished on him all the  assistance in our power; he recovered by degrees, and was restored to life  and to the prayers of his sons, who held him fast embraced in their arms.  While the rights of nature resumed their empire in this affecting episode  of our sad adventures, we had soon the afflicting sight of a melancholy  contrast. Two young lads, and a baker, did not fear to seek death, by  throwing themselves into the sea, after having taken leave of their  companions in misfortune. Already the faculties of our men were singularly  impaired; some fancied they saw the land; others, vessels which were coming  to save us; all announced to us by their cries these fallacious visions.    We deplored the loss of our unhappy companions; we did not presage, at this  moment, the still more terrible scene which was to take place the following  night; far from that, we enjoyed a degree of satisfaction, so fully were we  persuaded that the boats would come to our relief. The day was fine, and  the most perfect tranquillity prevailed on our raft. The evening came, and  the boats did not appear. Despondency began again to seize all our people,  and a mutinous spirit manifested itself by cries of fury; the voice of the  officers was wholly disregarded. When the night came, the sky was covered  with thick clouds; the wind, which during the day had been rather high, now  became furious, and agitated the sea, which, in an instant, grew very  rough.    If the preceding night had been terrible, this was still more horrible.  Mountains of water covered us every moment, and broke, with violence, in  the midst of us; very happily we had the wind behind us, and the fury of  the waves was a little checked by the rapidity of our progress; we drove  towards the land. From the violence of the sea, the men passed rapidly from  the back to the front of the raft, we were obliged to keep in the centre,  the most solid part of the raft; those who could not get there, almost all  perished. Before and behind the waves dashed with fury, and carried off the  men in spite of all their resistance. At the centre, the crowd was such  that some poor men were stifled by the weight of their comrades, who fell  upon them every moment; the officers kept themselves at the foot of the  little mast, obliged, every instant, to avoid the waves, to call to those  who surrounded them to go on the one or the other side, for the waves which  came upon us, nearly athwart, gave our raft a position almost  perpendicular, so that, in order to counterbalance it, we were obliged to  run to that side which was raised up by the sea.[A10]    The soldiers and sailors, terrified by the presence of an almost inevitable  danger, gave themselves up for lost. Firmly believing that they were going  to be swallowed up, they resolved to soothe their last moments by drinking  till they lost the use of their reason; we had not strength to oppose this  disorder; they fell upon a cask which was at the middle of the raft, made a  large hole at one end, and with little tin cups which they had brought from  on board the frigate, they each took a pretty large quantity, but they were  soon obliged to desist, because the sea water entered by the hole which  they had made.    The fumes of the wine soon disordered their brains, already affected by the  presence of danger and want of food. Thus inflamed, these men, become deaf  to the voice of reason, desired to implicate, in one common destruction,  their companions in misfortune; they openly expressed their intention to  rid themselves of the officers, who they said, wished to oppose their  design, and then to destroy the raft by cutting the ropes which united the  different parts that composed it. A moment after, they were proceeding to  put this plan in execution. One of them advanced to the edge of the raft  with a boarding-axe, and began to strike the cords: this was the signal for  revolt: we advanced in order to stop these madmen: he who was armed with  the axe, with which he even threatened an officer, was the first victim: a  blow with a sabre put an end to his existence. This man was an Asiatic, and  soldier in a colonial regiment: a colossal stature, short curled hair, an  extremely large nose, an enormous mouth, a sallow complexion, gave him a  hideous air. He had placed himself, at first, in the middle of the raft,  and at every blow of his fist he overthrew those who stood in his way; he  inspired the greatest terror, and nobody dared to approach him. If there  had been half-a-dozen like him, our destruction would have been inevitable.    Some persons, desirous of prolonging their existence, joined those who  wished to preserve the raft, and armed themselves: of this number were some  subaltern officers and many passengers. The mutineers drew their sabres,  and those who had none, armed themselves with knives: they advanced  resolutely against us; we put ourselves on our defence: the attack was  going to begin. Animated by despair, one of the mutineers lifted his sabre  against an officer; he immediately fell, pierced with wounds. This firmness  awed them a moment; but did not at all diminish their rage. They ceased to  threaten us, and presenting a front bristling with sabres and bayonets,  they retired to the back part, to execute their plan. One of them pretended  to rest himself on the little railing which formed the sides of the raft,  and with a knife began to cut the cords. Being informed by a servant, we  rushed upon him--a soldier attempted to defend him--threatened an officer  with his knife, and in attempting to strike him, only pierced his coat--the  officer turned round--overpowered his adversary, and threw both him and his  comrade into the sea!    After this there were no more partial affairs: the combat became general.  Some cried lower the sail; a crowd of madmen instantly threw themselves on  the yards and the shrouds, and cut the stays, and let the mast fall, and  nearly broke the thigh of a captain of foot, who fell senseless. He was  seized by the soldiers, who threw him into the sea: we perceived it--saved  him, and placed him on a barrel, from which he was taken by the seditious;  who were going to cut out his eyes with a penknife. Exasperated by so many  cruelties, we no longer kept any measures, and charged them furiously. With  our sabres drawn we traversed the lines which the soldiers formed, and many  atoned with their lives for a moment of delusion. Several passengers  displayed much courage and coolness in these cruel moments.    Mr. Correard was fallen into a kind of trance, but hearing every moment  cries of \"_To arms! To us, comrades! We are undone_!\" joined to the cries  and imprecations of the wounded and the dying, he was soon roused from his  lethargy. The increasing confusion made him sensible that it was necessary  to be upon his guard. Armed with his sabre, he assembled some of his  workmen on the front of the raft, and forbid them to hurt any one unless  they were attacked. He remained almost always with them, and they had  several times to defend themselves against the attacks of the mutineers;  who falling into the sea, returned by the front of the raft; which placed  Mr. Correard and his little troop between two dangers, and rendered their  position very difficult to be defended. Every moment men presented  themselves, armed with knives, sabres and bayonets; many had carbines,  which they used as clubs. The workmen did their utmost to stop them, by  presenting the point of their sabres; and, notwithstanding the repugnance  they felt to combat their unhappy countrymen, they were however obliged to  use their arms without reserve; because many of the mutineers attacked them  with fury, it was necessary to repulse them in the same manner. In this  action some of the workmen received large wounds; he who commanded them  reckons a great number, which he received in the various combats they had  to maintain. At last their united efforts succeeded in dispersing the  masses that advanced furiously against them.    During this combat, Mr. Correard was informed, by one of his workmen who  remained faithful, that one of their comrades, named Dominique, had taken  part with the mutineers, and that he had just been thrown into the sea.  Immediately forgetting the fault and the treachery of this man, he threw  himself in after him, at the place where the voice of the wretch had just  been heard calling for assistance; he seized him by the hair, and had the  good fortune to get him on board. Dominique had received, in a charge,  several sabre wounds, one of which had laid open his head. Notwithstanding  the darkness we found the wound, which appeared to us to be very  considerable. One of the workmen gave his handkerchief to bind it up and  stanch the blood. Our care revived this wretch; but as soon as he recovered  his strength, the ungrateful Dominique, again forgetting his duty and"]]]
