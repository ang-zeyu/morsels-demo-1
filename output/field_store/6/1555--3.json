Ideas must be combatted by  ideas, and it is only by the propaganda of the idea that we can prepare  humanity for its future. Violence is always a means of preventing the  sincere and fruitful diffusion of an idea. We do not say this merely for  the abnormals of the lower classes. We refer with scientific serenity  also to the upper classes, who would suppress by violence every  manifestation of revolt against the social iniquities, every affirmation  of faith in a better future.    This is the conception of our science, which thus succeeds in  distinguishing traits of character even among the unlucky and forlorn  people of the criminal world, while the classic school of criminology  regards a criminal as a sort of abstract and normal man, with the  exception of cases of minors, deaf mutes, inebriates, and maniacs.    In fact, the classic school of criminology regards all thieves as THE  thief, all murderers as THE murderer, and the human shape disappears in  the mind of the legislator, while it re-appears before the judge. Before  the essayist and legislator, the criminal is a sort of moving dummy, on  whose hack the judge may paste an article of the penal code. If you  leave out of consideration the established cases of exceptional and rare  human psychology mentioned in the penal code, all other cases serve the  judge merely as an excuse to select from the criminal code the number of  that article which will fit the criminal dummy, and if he should paste  404 instead of 407 on its back, the court of appeals would resist, any  change of numbers. And if this dummy came to life and said: \"The  question of my number may be very important for you, but if you would  study all the conditions that compelled me to take other people's  things, you would realize that this importance is very diagrammatic,\"  the judge would answer: \"That's all right for the justice of the future,  but it isn't now. You are number 404 of the criminal code, and after  leaving this court room with this number pasted legally on your back,  you will receive another number, for you will enter prison as number 404  and will exchange it for entry number 1525, or some other, because your  personality as a man disappears entirely before the enactment of social  justice!\" And then it is pretended that this man, whose personality is  thus absurdly ignored, should leave prison cured of all degeneration,  and if he falls back into the path of thorns of his misery and commits  another crime, the judge simply pastes another article over the other,  by adding number 80 or 81, which refer to cases of relapse, to number  404!    In this way the classic school of criminology came to its unit of  punishment, which it heralded as its great progress. In the Middle  Ages, the diversity of punishment was greater. But in the 19th century  the classic school of criminology combatted dishonoring punishment,  corporeal punishment, confiscation, professional punishment, capital  punishment, with its ideal of one sole penalty, the only panacea for  crime and criminals, _prison_.    We have, indeed, prohibitory measures and fines even today. But in  substance the whole punitive armory is reduced to imprisonment, since  fines are likewise convertible into so many days or months of  imprisonment. Solitary confinement is the ideal of the classic school of  criminology. But experience proves that this penalty has as much effect  on the disease of criminality, as the remedy of a physician would have,  who would sit in the door of a hospital and tell every patient seeking  relief: \"Whatever may be your disease, I have only one medicine and that  is a decoction of rhubarb. You have heart trouble? Well, then, the  problem for me is simply--how big a dose of rhubarb decoction shall I  give you?\"    And measuring doses of penalty is the foundation of the criminal code.  That is so true that this code is in its last analysis but a table of  criminal logarithms for figuring out penalties. Woe to the judge who  makes a mistake in sentencing a 19 year old offender who was drunk when  he sinned, but had premeditated his deed. Woe to the judge, if he misses  his calculation in adding or subtracting the third, or sixth, or one  half, corresponding to the prescribed extenuating or aggravating  circumstances! If he makes a miscalculation, the court of appeals is  invoked by the defendant, and the inexorable court of appeals tells the  judge: \"Figure this over again. You have been unjust.\" The only question  for the judge is this: Add your sums and subtract your deductions, and  the prisoner is sentenced to one year, seven months, and thirteen days.  Not one day more or less! But the human spectator asks: \"If the criminal  should happen to be reformed before the expiration of his term, should  he be retained in prison?\" The judge replies: \"I don't care, he stays in  one year, seven months, and thirteen days!\"    Then the human spectator says: \"But suppose the criminal should not yet  be fit for human society at the expiration of his term?\" The judge  replies: \"At the expiration of his term he leaves prison, for when he  has absolved his last day, he has paid his debt!\"    This is the same case as that of the imaginary physician who says: \"You  have heart trouble? Then take a quart of rhubarb decoction and stay  twelve days in the hospital.\" Another patient says: \"I have broken my  leg.\" And the doctor: \"All right, take a pint of rhubarb decoction and  17 days in the hospital.\" A third has inflammation of the lungs, and the  doctor prescribes three quarts of rhubarb decoction and three months in  the hospital. \"But if my inflammation is cured before that time?\" \"No  matter,\" says the doctor, \"you stay in three months.\" \"But if I am not  cured of my lung trouble after three months?\" \"No matter,\" says the  doctor, \"you leave after three months.\"    To such results have wise men been led by a system of penal justice,  which is a denial of all elementary common sense. They have forgotten  the personality of the criminal and occupied themselves exclusively with  crime as an abstract juristic phenomenon. In the same manner, the old  style medicine occupied itself with disease as such, as an abstract  pathological phenomenon, without taking into account the personality of  the patient. The ancient physicians did not consider whether a patient  was well or ill nourished, young or old, strong or weak, nervous or  fullblooded. They cured fever as fever, pleurisy as pleurisy. Modern  medicine, on the other hand, declares that disease must be studied in  the living person of the patient. And the same disease may require  different treatment, if the condition of the patient is different.    Criminal justice has taken the same historical course of development as  medicine. The classic school of criminology is still in the same stage,  in which medicine was before the middle of the 19th century. It deals  with theft, murder, fraud, as such. But that which claims so much of the  attention of society has been forgotten by the classic school. For that  school has forgotten to study the murderer, the thief, the forger, and  without that study their crimes cannot be understood.    Crime is one of the conditions required for the study of the criminal.  But, the same crime may require the application of different remedies  to the personalities of different criminals, according to the different  anthropological and social conditions of the various criminals. There is  a fundamental distinction between the anthropological and social types  of criminals, whom I have divided into five categories, which are today  unanimously accepted by criminalist anthropologists, since the Geneva  congress offered an opportunity to explain the misapprehension which led  some foreign scientists to believe that the Italian school regarded one  of these types (the born criminal) merely as an organic anomaly.    Just a word concerning each one of these five types.    The _born criminal_ is a victim of that which I will call (seeing that  science has not yet solved this problem) criminal neurosis, which is  very analogous to epileptic neurosis, but which is not in itself  sufficient to make one a criminal. Our adversaries had the idea that the  mere possession of a crooked nose or a slanting skull stamped a man as  predisposed by birth to murder or theft. But a man may he a born  criminal, that is to say, he may have some congenital degeneration which  predisposes him toward crime, and yet he may die at the age of 80  without having committed any crime, because he was fortunate enough to  live in an environment which did not offer him any temptation to commit  crime. Again, are not many predisposed toward insanity without ever  becoming insane? If the same individual were to live under unfavorable  conditions, without any education, if he were to find himself in  unhealthy telluric surroundings, in a mine, a rice field, or a miasmatic  swamp, he would become insane. But if instead of living in conditions  that condemn him to lunacy he were to be under no necessity to struggle  for his daily bread, if he could live in affluence, he might exhibit  some eccentricity of character, but would not cross the threshold of an  insane asylum. The same happens in the case of criminality. One may have  a congenital predisposition toward crime, but if he lives in favorable  surroundings, he will live to the end of his natural life without  violating any criminal or moral law. At any rate we must drop the  prejudice that only those are criminals on whose backs the judge has  pasted a number. For there are many scoundrels at large who commit crime  with impunity, or who brush the edge of the criminal law in the most  repulsive immorality without violating it.    This misunderstanding was explained at the congress of Geneva by the  statement that the interaction of the social and telluric environment is  required also in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],[0,"Mike and Psmith (#10)"],[1,"  expensive, and it would be just as good as a helmet for all the timbers  that are likely to fall on our heads.\"    Mr. Downing smiled a wry smile.    \"Our Wilson is facetious,\" he remarked frostily.    \"Sir, no, sir! I wasn't facetious! Or couldn't we have tasseled caps  like the first fifteen have? They--\"    \"Wilson, leave the room!\"    \"Sir, _please_, sir!\"    \"This moment, Wilson. And,\" as he reached the door, \"do me one hundred  lines.\"    A pained \"OO-oo-oo, sir-r-r,\" was cut off by the closing door.    Mr. Downing proceeded to improve the occasion. \"I deplore this growing  spirit of flippancy,\" he said. \"I tell you I deplore it! It is not  right! If this Fire Brigade is to be of solid use, there must be less of  this flippancy. We must have keenness. I want you boys above all to be  keen. I...? What is that noise?\"    From the other side of the door proceeded a sound like water gurgling  from a bottle, mingled with cries half suppressed, as if somebody were  being prevented from uttering them by a hand laid over his mouth. The  sufferer appeared to have a high voice.    There was a tap at the door and Mike walked in. He was not alone. Those  near enough to see, saw that he was accompanied by Jellicoe's clockwork  rat, which moved rapidly over the floor in the direction of the  opposite wall.    \"May I fetch a book from my desk, sir?\" asked Mike.    \"Very well--be quick, Jackson; we are busy.\"    Being interrupted in one of his addresses to the Brigade irritated Mr.  Downing.    The muffled cries grew more distinct.    \"What ... is ... that ... noise?\" shrilled Mr. Downing.    \"Noise, sir?\" asked Mike, puzzled.    \"I think it's something outside the window, sir,\" said Stone helpfully.    \"A bird, I think, sir,\" said Robinson.    \"Don't be absurd!\" snapped Mr. Downing. \"It's outside the door. Wilson!\"    \"Yes, sir?\" said a voice \"off.\"    \"Are you making that whining noise?\"    \"Whining noise, sir? No, sir, I'm not making a whining noise.\"    \"What _sort_ of noise, sir?\" inquired Mike, as many Wrykynians had asked  before him. It was a question invented by Wrykyn for use in just such a  case as this.    \"I do not propose,\" said Mr. Downing acidly, \"to imitate the noise; you  can all hear it perfectly plainly. It is a curious whining noise.\"    \"They are mowing the cricket field, sir,\" said the invisible Wilson.  \"Perhaps that's it.\"    \"It may be one of the desks squeaking, sir,\" put in Stone. \"They do  sometimes.\"    \"Or somebody's shoes, sir,\" added Robinson.    \"Silence! Wilson?\"    \"Yes, sir?\" bellowed the unseen one.    \"Don't shout at me from the corridor like that. Come in.\"    \"Yes, sir!\"    As he spoke the muffled whining changed suddenly to a series of tenor  shrieks, and the India-rubber form of Sammy bounded into the room like  an excited kangaroo.    Willing hands had by this time deflected the clockwork rat from the wall  to which it had been steering, and pointed it up the alleyway between  the two rows of desks. Mr. Downing, rising from his place, was just in  time to see Sammy with a last leap spring on his prey and begin  worrying it.    Chaos reigned.    \"A rat!\" shouted Robinson.    The twenty-three members of the Brigade who were not earnest instantly  dealt with the situation, each in the manner that seemed proper to him.  Some leaped onto forms, others flung books, all shouted. It was a  stirring, bustling scene.    Sammy had by this time disposed of the clockwork rat, and was now  standing, like Marius, among the ruins barking triumphantly.    The banging on Mr. Downing's desk resembled thunder. It rose above all  the other noises till in time they gave up the competition and  died away.    Mr. Downing shot out orders, threats, and penalties with the rapidity of  a Bren gun.    \"Stone, sit down! Donovan, if you do not sit down you will be severely  punished. Henderson, one hundred lines for gross disorder! Windham, the  same! Go to your seat, Vincent. What are you doing, Broughton-Knight? I  will not have this disgraceful noise and disorder! The meeting is at an  end; go quietly from the room, all of you. Jackson and Wilson, remain.  _Quietly_, I said, Durand! Don't shuffle your feet in that  abominable way.\"    Crash!    \"Wolferstan, I distinctly saw you upset that blackboard with a movement  of your hand--one hundred lines. Go quietly from the room, everybody.\"    The meeting dispersed.    \"Jackson and Wilson, come here. What's the meaning of this disgraceful  conduct? Put that dog out of the room, Jackson.\"    Mike removed the yelling Sammy and shut the door on him.    \"Well, Wilson?\"    \"Please, sir, I was playing with a clockwork rat--\"    \"What business have you to be playing with clockwork rats?\"    \"Then I remembered,\" said Mike, \"that I had left my Horace in my desk,  so I came in--\"    \"And by a fluke, sir,\" said Wilson, as one who tells of strange things,  \"the rat happened to be pointing in the same direction, so he came  in, too.\"    \"I met Sammy on the gravel outside and he followed me.\"    \"I tried to collar him, but when you told me to come in, sir, I had to  let him go, and he came in after the rat.\"    It was plain to Mr. Downing that the burden of sin was shared equally by  both culprits. Wilson had supplied the rat, Mike the dog; but Mr.  Downing liked Wilson and disliked Mike. Wilson was in the Fire Brigade,  frivolous at times, it was true, but nevertheless a member. Also he kept  wicket for the school. Mike was a member of the Archaeological Society,  and had refused to play cricket.    Mr. Downing allowed these facts to influence him in passing sentence.    \"One hundred lines, Wilson,\" he said. \"You may go.\"    Wilson departed with the air of a man who has had a great deal of fun,  and paid very little for it.    Mr. Downing turned to Mike. \"You will stay in on Saturday afternoon,  Jackson; it will interfere with your Archaeological studies, I fear, but  it may teach you that we have no room at Sedleigh for boys who spend  their time loafing about and making themselves a nuisance. We are a keen  school; this is no place for boys who do nothing but waste their time.  That will do, Jackson.\"    And Mr. Downing walked out of the room. In affairs of this kind a master  has a habit of getting the last word.        10    ACHILLES LEAVES HIS TENT      They say misfortunes never come singly. As Mike sat brooding over his  wrongs in his study, after the Sammy incident, Jellicoe came into the  room, and, without preamble, asked for the loan of a pound.    When one has been in the habit of confining one's lendings and  borrowings to sixpences and shillings, a request for a pound comes as  something of a blow.    \"What on earth for?\" asked Mike.    \"I say, do you mind if I don't tell you? I don't want to tell anybody.  The fact is, I'm in a beastly hole.\"    \"Oh, sorry,\" said Mike. \"As a matter of fact, I do happen to have a  quid. You can freeze on to it, if you like. But it's about all I have  got, so don't be shy about paying it back.\"    Jellicoe was profuse in his thanks, and disappeared in a cloud of  gratitude.    Mike felt that Fate was treating him badly. Being kept in on Saturday  meant that he would be unable to turn out for Little Borlock against  Claythorpe, the return match. In the previous game he had scored  ninety-eight, and there was a lob bowler in the Claythorpe ranks whom he  was particularly anxious to meet again. Having to yield a sovereign to  Jellicoe--why on earth did the man want all that?--meant that, unless a  carefully worded letter to his brother Bob at Oxford had the desired  effect, he would be practically penniless for weeks.    In a gloomy frame of mind he sat down to write to Bob, who was playing  regularly for the Varsity this season, and only the previous week had  made a century against Sussex, so might be expected to be in a  sufficiently softened mood to advance the needful. (Which, it may be  stated at once, he did, by return of post.)    Mike was struggling with the opening sentences of this letter--he was  never a very ready writer--when Stone and Robinson burst into the room.    Mike put down his pen, and got up. He was in warlike mood, and welcomed  the intrusion. If Stone and Robinson wanted battle, they should have it.    But the motives of the expedition were obviously friendly. Stone beamed.  Robinson was laughing.    \"You're a sportsman,\" said Robinson.    \"What did he give you?\" asked Stone.    They sat down, Robinson on the table, Stone in Psmith's deck chair.  Mike's heart warmed to them. The little disturbance in the dormitory was  a thing of the past, done with, forgotten, contemporary with Julius  Caesar. He felt that he, Stone and Robinson must learn to know and  appreciate one another.    There was, as a matter of fact, nothing much wrong with Stone and  Robinson. They were just ordinary raggers of the type found at every  public school, small and large. They were absolutely free from brain.  They had a certain amount of muscle, and a vast store of animal spirits.  They looked on school life purely as a vehicle for ragging. The Stones  and Robinsons are the swashbucklers of the school world. They go about,  loud and boisterous, with a wholehearted and cheerful indifference to  other people's feelings, treading on the toes of their neighbor and  shoving him off the pavement, and always with an eye wide open for any  adventure. As to the kind of adventure, they are not particular so long  as it promises excitement. Sometimes they go through their whole school  career without accident. More often they run up against a snag in the  shape of some serious-minded and muscular person, who objects to having  his toes trodden on and being shoved off the pavement, and then they  usually sober down, to the mutual advantage of themselves and the rest  of the community.    One's opinion of this type of youth varies according to one's point of  view. Small boys whom they had occasion to kick, either from pure high  spirits "]]]
