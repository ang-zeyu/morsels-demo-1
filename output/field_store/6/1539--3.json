Only his eyes were rimmed  with white skin.    \"You'd better get off the horse, here,\" said Donnegan.    He held her stirrup, and she obeyed without a word.    \"Sit down.\"    She sat down on the flat-topped boulder which he designated, and,  looking up, observed the first sign of emotion in his face. He was  frowning, and his face was drawn a little.    \"You are tired,\" he stated.    \"A little.\"    \"You are tired,\" said the wanderer in a tone that implied dislike of any  denial. Therefore she made no answer. \"I'm going down into the town to  look things over. I don't want to parade you through the streets until I  know where Landis is to be found and how he'll receive you. The Corner  is a wild town; you understand?\"    \"Yes,\" she said blankly, and noted nervously that the reply did not  please him. He actually scowled at her.    \"You'll be all right here. I'll leave the pack mule with you; if  anything should happen--but nothing is going to happen, I'll be back in  an hour or so. There's a pool of water. You can get a cold drink there  and wash up if you want to while I'm gone. But don't go to sleep!\"    \"Why not?\"    \"A place like this is sure to have a lot of stragglers hunting around  it. Bad characters. You understand?\"    She could not understand why he should make a mystery of it; but then,  he was almost as strange as her father. His careful English and his  ragged clothes were typical of him inside and out.    \"You have a gun there in your holster. Can you use it?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Try it.\"    It was a thirty-two, a woman's light weapon. She took it out and  balanced it in her hand.    \"The blue rock down the hillside. Let me see you chip it.\"    Her hand went up, and without pausing to sight along the barrel, she  fired; fire flew from the rock, and there appeared a white, small scar.  Donnegan sighed with relief.    \"If you squeezed the butt rather than pulled the trigger,\" he commented,  \"you would have made a bull's-eye that time. Now, I don't mean that in  any likelihood you'll have to defend yourself. I simply want you to be  aware that there's plenty of trouble around The Corner.\"    \"Yes,\" said the girl.    \"You're not afraid?\"    \"Oh, no.\"    Donnegan settled his hat a little more firmly upon his head. He had been  on the verge of attributing her gentleness to a blank, stupid mind; he  began to realize that there was metal under the surface. He felt that  some of the qualities of the father were echoed faintly, and at a  distance, in the child. In a way, she made him think of an unawakened  creature. When she was roused, if the time ever came, it might be that  her eye could become a thing alternately of fire and ice, and her voice  might carry with a ring.    \"This business has to be gotten through quickly,\" he went on. \"One  meeting with Jack Landis will be enough.\"    She wondered why he set his jaw when he said this, but he was wondering  how deeply the colonel's ward had fallen into the clutches of Nelly  Lebrun. If that first meeting did not bring Landis to his senses, what  followed? One of two things. Either the girl must stay on in The Corner  and try her hand with her fiance again, or else the final brutal  suggestion of the colonel must be followed; he must kill Landis. It was  a cold-blooded suggestion, but Donnegan was a cold-blooded man. As he  looked at the girl, where she sat on the boulder, he knew definitely,  first and last, that he loved her, and that he would never again love  any other woman. Every instinct drew him toward the necessity of  destroying Landis. There was his stumbling block. But what if she truly  loved Landis?    He would have to wait in order to find that out. And as he stood there  with the sun shining on the red stubble on his face he made a resolution  the more profound because it was formed in silence: if she truly loved  Landis he would serve her hand and foot until she had her will.    But all he said was simply: \"I shall be back before it's dark.\"    \"I shall be comfortable here,\" replied the girl, and smiled farewell at  him.    And while Donnegan went down the slope full of darkness he thought of  that smile.    The Corner spread more clearly before him with every step he made. It  was a type of the gold-rush town. Of course most of the dwellings were  tents--dog tents many of them; but there was a surprising sprinkling of  wooden shacks, some of them of considerable size. Beginning at the very  edge of the town and spread over the sand flats were the mines and the  black sprinkling of laborers. And the town itself was roughly jumbled  around one street. Over to the left the main road into The Corner  crossed the wide, shallow ford of the Young Muddy River and up this road  he saw half a dozen wagons coming, wagons of all sizes; but nothing went  out of The Corner. People who came stayed there, it seemed.    He dropped over the lower hills, and the voice of the gold town rose to  him. It was a murmur like that of an army preparing for battle. Now and  then a blast exploded, for what purpose he could not imagine in this  school of mining. But as a rule the sounds were subdued by the distance.  He caught the muttering of many voices, in which laughter and shouts  were brought to the level of a whisper at close hand; and through all  this there was a persistent clangor of metallic sounds. No doubt from  the blacksmith shops where picks and other implements were made or  sharpened and all sorts of repairing carried on. But the predominant  tone of the voice of The Corner was this persistent ringing of metal. It  suggested to Donnegan that here was a town filled with men of iron and  all the gentler parts of their natures forgotten. An odd place to bring  such a woman as Lou Macon, surely!    He reached the level, and entered the town.          11      Hunting for news, he went naturally to the news emporium which took the  place of the daily paper--namely, he went to the saloons. But on the way  he ran through a liberal cross-section of The Corner's populace. First  of all, the tents and the ruder shacks. He saw little sheet-iron stoves  with the tin dishes piled, unwashed, upon the tops of them when the  miners rushed back to their work; broken handles of picks and shovels;  worn-out shirts and overalls lay where they had been tossed; here was a  flat strip of canvas supported by four four-foot poles and without  shelter at the sides, and the belongings of one careless miner tumbled  beneath this miserable shelter; another man had striven for some  semblance of a home and he had framed a five-foot walk leading up to the  closed flap of his tent with stones of a regular size. But nowhere was  there a sign of life, and would not be until semidarkness brought the  unwilling workers back to the tents.    Out of this district he passed quickly onto the main street, and here  there was a different atmosphere. The first thing he saw was a man  dressed as a cowpuncher from belt to spurs--spurs on a miner--but above  the waist he blossomed in a frock coat and a silk hat. Around the coat  he had fastened his belt, and the shirt beneath the coat was common  flannel, open at the throat. He walked, or rather staggered, on the arm  of an equally strange companion who was arrayed in a white silk shirt,  white flannel trousers, white dancing pumps, and a vast sombrero! But as  if this was not sufficient protection for his head, he carried a parasol  of the most brilliant green silk and twirled it above his head. The two  held a wavering course and went blindly past Donnegan.    It was sufficiently clear that the storekeeper had followed the gold.    He noted a cowboy sitting in his saddle while he rolled a cigarette.  Obviously he had come in to look things over rather than to share in the  mining, and he made the one sane, critical note in the carnival of noise  and color. Donnegan began to pass stores. There was the jeweler's; the  gent's furnishing; a real estate office--what could real estate be doing  on the Young Muddy's desert? Here was the pawnshop, the windows of which  were already packed. The blacksmith had a great establishment, and the  roar of the anvils never died away; feed and grain and a dozen  lunch-counter restaurants. All this had come to The Corner within six  weeks.    Liquor seemed to be plentiful, too. In the entire length of the street  he hardly saw a sober man, except the cowboy. Half a dozen in one group  pitched silver dollars at a mark. But he was in the saloon district now,  and dominant among the rest was the big, unpainted front of a building  before which hung an enormous sign:    LEBRUN'S JOY EMPORIUM    Donnegan turned in under the sign.    It was one big room. The bar stretched completely around two sides of  it. The floor was dirt, but packed to the hardness of wood. The low roof  was supported by a scattering of wooden pillars, and across the floor  the gaming tables were spread. At that vast bar not ten men were  drinking now; at the crowding tables there were not half a dozen  players; yet behind the bar stood a dozen tenders ready to meet the  evening rush from the mines. And at the tables waited an equal number of  the professional gamblers of the house.    From the door Donnegan observed these things with one sweeping glance,  and then proceeded to transform himself. One jerk at the visor of his  cap brought it down over his eyes and covered his face with shadow; a  single shrug bunched the ragged coat high around his shoulders, and the  shoulders themselves he allowed to drop forward. With his hands in his  pockets he glided slowly across the room toward the bar, for all the  world a picture of the guttersnipe who had been kicked from pillar to  post until self-respect is dead in him. And pausing in his advance, he  leaned against one of the pillars and looked hungrily toward the bar.    He was immediately hailed from behind the bar with: \"Hey, you. No tramps  in here.

Well befits, his long  Endurance should be shorten'd by thy deeds.    \"Florence, within her ancient limit-mark,  Which calls her still to matin prayers and noon,  Was chaste and sober, and abode in peace.  She had no armlets and no head-tires then,  No purfled dames, no zone, that caught the eye  More than the person did.  Time was not yet,  When at his daughter's birth the sire grew pale.  For fear the age and dowry should exceed  On each side just proportion.  House was none  Void of its family; nor yet had come  Hardanapalus, to exhibit feats  Of chamber prowess.  Montemalo yet  O'er our suburban turret rose; as much  To be surpass in fall, as in its rising.  I saw Bellincione Berti walk abroad  In leathern girdle and a clasp of bone;  And, with no artful colouring on her cheeks,  His lady leave the glass.  The sons I saw  Of Nerli and of Vecchio well content  With unrob'd jerkin; and their good dames handling  The spindle and the flax; O happy they!  Each sure of burial in her native land,  And none left desolate a-bed for France!  One wak'd to tend the cradle, hushing it  With sounds that lull'd the parent's infancy:  Another, with her maidens, drawing off  The tresses from the distaff, lectur'd them  Old tales of Troy and Fesole and Rome.  A Salterello and Cianghella we  Had held as strange a marvel, as ye would  A Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.    \"In such compos'd and seemly fellowship,  Such faithful and such fair equality,  In so sweet household, Mary at my birth  Bestow'd me, call'd on with loud cries; and there  In your old baptistery, I was made  Christian at once and Cacciaguida; as were  My brethren, Eliseo and Moronto.    \"From Valdipado came to me my spouse,  And hence thy surname grew.  I follow'd then  The Emperor Conrad; and his knighthood he  Did gird on me; in such good part he took  My valiant service.  After him I went  To testify against that evil law,  Whose people, by the shepherd's fault, possess  Your right, usurping.  There, by that foul crew  Was I releas'd from the deceitful world,  Whose base affection many a spirit soils,  And from the martyrdom came to this peace.\"          CANTO XVI    O slight respect of man's nobility!  I never shall account it marvelous,  That our infirm affection here below  Thou mov'st to boasting, when I could not choose,  E'en in that region of unwarp'd desire,  In heav'n itself, but make my vaunt in thee!  Yet cloak thou art soon shorten'd, for that time,  Unless thou be eked out from day to day,  Goes round thee with his shears.  Resuming then  With greeting such, as Rome, was first to bear,  But since hath disaccustom'd I began;  And Beatrice, that a little space  Was sever'd, smil'd reminding me of her,  Whose cough embolden'd (as the story holds)  To first offence the doubting Guenever.    \"You are my sire,\" said I, \"you give me heart  Freely to speak my thought: above myself  You raise me.  Through so many streams with joy  My soul is fill'd, that gladness wells from it;  So that it bears the mighty tide, and bursts not  Say then, my honour'd stem! what ancestors  Where those you sprang from, and what years were mark'd  In your first childhood?  Tell me of the fold,  That hath Saint John for guardian, what was then  Its state, and who in it were highest seated?\"    As embers, at the breathing of the wind,  Their flame enliven, so that light I saw  Shine at my blandishments; and, as it grew  More fair to look on, so with voice more sweet,  Yet not in this our modern phrase, forthwith  It answer'd: \"From the day, when it was said  'Hail Virgin!' to the throes, by which my mother,  Who now is sainted, lighten'd her of me  Whom she was heavy with, this fire had come,  Five hundred fifty times and thrice, its beams  To reilumine underneath the foot  Of its own lion.  They, of whom I sprang,  And I, had there our birth-place, where the last  Partition of our city first is reach'd  By him, that runs her annual game.  Thus much  Suffice of my forefathers: who they were,  And whence they hither came, more honourable  It is to pass in silence than to tell.  All those, who in that time were there from Mars  Until the Baptist, fit to carry arms,  Were but the fifth of them this day alive.  But then the citizen's blood, that now is mix'd  From Campi and Certaldo and Fighine,  Ran purely through the last mechanic's veins.  O how much better were it, that these people  Were neighbours to you, and that at Galluzzo  And at Trespiano, ye should have your bound'ry,  Than to have them within, and bear the stench  Of Aguglione's hind, and Signa's, him,  That hath his eye already keen for bart'ring!  Had not the people, which of all the world  Degenerates most, been stepdame unto Caesar,  But, as a mother, gracious to her son;  Such one, as hath become a Florentine,  And trades and traffics, had been turn'd adrift  To Simifonte, where his grandsire ply'd  The beggar's craft.  The Conti were possess'd  Of Montemurlo still: the Cerchi still  Were in Acone's parish; nor had haply  From Valdigrieve past the Buondelmonte.  The city's malady hath ever source  In the confusion of its persons, as  The body's, in variety of food:  And the blind bull falls with a steeper plunge,  Than the blind lamb; and oftentimes one sword  Doth more and better execution,  Than five.  Mark Luni, Urbisaglia mark,  How they are gone, and after them how go  Chiusi and Sinigaglia; and 't will seem  No longer new or strange to thee to hear,  That families fail, when cities have their end.  All things, that appertain t' ye, like yourselves,  Are mortal: but mortality in some  Ye mark not, they endure so long, and you  Pass by so suddenly.  And as the moon  Doth, by the rolling of her heav'nly sphere,  Hide and reveal the strand unceasingly;  So fortune deals with Florence.  Hence admire not  At what of them I tell thee, whose renown  Time covers, the first Florentines.  I saw  The Ughi, Catilini and Filippi,  The Alberichi, Greci and Ormanni,  Now in their wane, illustrious citizens:  And great as ancient, of Sannella him,  With him of Arca saw, and Soldanieri  And Ardinghi, and Bostichi.  At the poop,  That now is laden with new felony,  So cumb'rous it may speedily sink the bark,  The Ravignani sat, of whom is sprung  The County Guido, and whoso hath since  His title from the fam'd Bellincione ta'en.  Fair governance was yet an art well priz'd  By him of Pressa: Galigaio show'd  The gilded hilt and pommel, in his house.  The column, cloth'd with verrey, still was seen  Unshaken: the Sacchetti still were great,  Giouchi, Sifanti, Galli and Barucci,  With them who blush to hear the bushel nam'd.  Of the Calfucci still the branchy trunk  Was in its strength: and to the curule chairs  Sizii and Arigucci yet were drawn.  How mighty them I saw, whom since their pride  Hath undone! and in all her goodly deeds  Florence was by the bullets of bright gold  O'erflourish'd.  Such the sires of those, who now,  As surely as your church is vacant, flock  Into her consistory, and at leisure  There stall them and grow fat.  The o'erweening brood,  That plays the dragon after him that flees,  But unto such, as turn and show the tooth,  Ay or the purse, is gentle as a lamb,  Was on its rise, but yet so slight esteem'd,  That Ubertino of Donati grudg'd  His father-in-law should yoke him to its tribe.  Already Caponsacco had descended  Into the mart from Fesole: and Giuda  And Infangato were good citizens.  A thing incredible I tell, tho' true:  The gateway, named from those of Pera, led  Into the narrow circuit of your walls.  Each one, who bears the sightly quarterings  Of the great Baron (he whose name and worth  The festival of Thomas still revives)  His knighthood and his privilege retain'd;  Albeit one, who borders them With gold,  This day is mingled with the common herd.  In Borgo yet the Gualterotti dwelt,  And Importuni: well for its repose  Had it still lack'd of newer neighbourhood.  The house, from whence your tears have had their spring,  Through the just anger that hath murder'd ye  And put a period to your gladsome days,  Was honour'd, it, and those consorted with it.  O Buondelmonte! what ill counseling  Prevail'd on thee to break the plighted bond  Many, who now are weeping, would rejoice,  Had God to Ema giv'n thee, the first time  Thou near our city cam'st.  But so was doom'd:  On that maim'd stone set up to guard the bridge,  At thy last peace, the victim, Florence! fell.  With these and others like to them, I saw  Florence in such assur'd tranquility,  She had no cause at which to grieve: with these  Saw her so glorious and so just, that ne'er  The lily from the lance had hung reverse,  Or through division been with vermeil dyed.\"          CANTO XVII    Such as the youth, who came to Clymene  To certify himself of that reproach,  Which had been fasten'd on him, (he whose end  Still makes the fathers chary to their sons),  E'en such was I; nor unobserv'd was such  Of Beatrice, and that saintly lamp,  Who had erewhile for me his station mov'd;  When thus by lady: \"Give thy wish free vent,  That it may issue, bearing true report  Of the mind's impress; not that aught thy words  May to our knowledge add, but to the end,  That thou mayst use thyself to own thy thirst  And men may mingle for thee when they hear.\"    \"O plant! from whence I spring! rever'd and lov'd!  Who soar'st so high a pitch, thou seest as clear,  As earthly thought determines two obtuse  In one triangle not contain'd, so clear  Dost see contingencies, ere in themselves  Existent, looking at the point whereto  All times are present, I, the whilst I scal'd  With Virgil the soul purifying mount,  And visited the nether world of woe,  Touching my future destiny have heard  Words grievous, though I feel me on all sides  Well "]]]
