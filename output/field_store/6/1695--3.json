At dawn we passed out of the  north gate, close to where General Maude is buried, and whirled across the  desert for thirty miles to Bakuba, a prosperous city on the banks of the  Diyala. From the junction of the greater Zab down to Kurna, where the  Euphrates joins, this stream is the most important affluent of the Tigris.  It was one of those bright, sparkling mornings on which merely to be alive  and breathe is a joy. We passed a number of caravans, bringing carpets and  rugs from Persia, or fruit and vegetables from the rich agricultural  district around Bakuba. The silks manufactured here are of a fine quality  and well known throughout the country.    After passing the big aerodrome near the town, the going became very bad;  we struggled along through the village of Deltawa, in and out of  unfathomable ditches. The rivers were in flood, and we ran into lakes and  swamps that we cautiously skirted. Dark overtook us in the middle of a  network of bogs, but we came upon an outpost of Welsh Fusiliers and spent  the night with them. We had smashed the bottom plate of one of the cars,  so that all the oil ran out of the crank-case, but with a side of the  ever-useful kerosene tin we patched the car up temporarily and pushed off  at early dawn. Our route wound through groves of palms surrounding the  tumble-down tomb of some holy man, occasional collections of squalid  little huts, and in the intervening \"despoblado\" we would catch sight of a  jackal crouching in the hollow or slinking off through the scrub. Deli  Abbas proved a half-deserted straggling town which gave evidence of having  once seen prosperous days. Some Turkish aeroplanes heralded our arrival.    In front of us rose the Jebel Hamrin--Red Hills--beyond them the  snow-clad peaks of the Kurdish Range. A few months previous we had  captured the passes over the Jebel, and we were now busy repairing and  improving the roads--in particular that across the Abu Hajjar, not for  nothing named by the Arabs the \"Father of Stones.\" Whenever the going  permitted we went out on reconnaissances--rekkos, as we called them. They  varied but slightly; the one I went on the day after reaching Deli Abbas  might serve as model. We started at daybreak and ran to a little village  called Ain Lailah, the Spring of Night, a lovely name for the small clump  of palm-trees tucked away unexpectedly in a hollow among barren  foot-hills. There we picked up a surveyor--an officer whose business it  was to make maps for the army. We passed through great herds of camels,  some with small children perched on their backs, who joggled about like  sailors on a storm-tossed ship, as the camels made away from the cars.  There were villages of the shapeless black tents of the nomads huddled in  among the desolate dunes. We picked up a Turk deserter who was trying to  reach our lines. He said that his six comrades had been killed by Arabs.  Shortly afterward we ran into a cavalry patrol, but the men escaped over  some very broken ground before we could satisfactorily come to terms with  them. It was lucky for the deserter that we found him before they did, for  his shrift would have been short. We got back to camp at half past eight,  having covered ninety-two miles in our windings--a good day's work.    Each section had two motorcycles attached to it--jackals, as one of the  generals called them, in apt reference to the way in which jackals  accompany a lion when hunting. The cyclists rode ahead to spy out the  country and the best course to follow. When we got into action they would  drop behind, and we used them to send messages back to camp. The best  motorcyclist we had was a Swiss named Milson. He was of part English  descent, and came at once from Switzerland at the outbreak of the war to  enlist. When he joined he spoke only broken English but was an exceedingly  intelligent man and had been attending a technical college. I have never  seen a more skilful rider; he could get his cycle along through the mud  when we were forced to carry the others, and no one was more cool and  unconcerned under fire. The personnel of the battery left nothing to be  desired. One was proud to serve among such a fine set of men. Corporal  Summers drove the car in which I usually rode, and I have never met with a  better driver or one who understood his car so thoroughly, and possessed  that intangible sympathy with it which is the gift of a few, but can be  never attained.    We were still in the rainy season. We had to travel as light as possible,  and all we could bring were forty-pounder tents, which correspond to the  American dog-tent. Very low, they withstood in remarkable fashion the  periodical hurricanes of wind and rain. They kept us fairly dry, too, for  we were careful to ditch them well. There was room for two men to sleep in  the turret of a Rolls, and they could spread a tarpaulin over the top to  keep the rain from coming in through the various openings. The balance of  the men had a communal tent or slept in the tenders. The larger tents in  the near-by camps blew down frequently, but with us it happened only  occasionally. There are happier moments than those spent in the inky  blackness amid a torrential deluge, when you try to extricate yourself  from the wet, clinging folds of falling canvas.    Time hung heavily when the weather was bad, and we were cooped up inside  our tents without even a hostile aeroplane to shoot at. One day when the  going was too poor to take out the heavy cars, I set off in a tender to  visit another section of the battery that was stationed thirty or forty  miles away in the direction of Persia, close by a town called Kizil Robat.  We had a rough trip, with several difficult fords to cross. It was only  through working with the icy water above our waists that we won through  the worst, amid the shouts of \"Shabash, Sahib!\" (\"Well done!\") from the  onlooking Indian troops. I reached the camp to find the section absent on  a reconnaissance, for the country was better drained than that over which  we were working. A few minutes later one of the cyclists came in with the  news that the cars were under heavy fire about twenty-five miles away and  one of them was badly bogged. I immediately loaded all the surplus men and  eight Punjabis from a near-by regiment into the tenders. We reached the  scene just after the disabled car had been abandoned. Some of the Turks  were concealed in a village two hundred and fifty yards away; the rest  were behind some high irrigation embankments. The free car had been  unable to circle around or flank them because of the nature of the  terrain. The men had not known that the village was occupied and had  bogged down almost at the same time that the Turks opened fire. By  breaking down an irrigation ditch the enemy succeeded in further flooding  the locality where the automobile was trapped. The Turks made it hot for  the men when they tried to dig out the car. The bullets spattered about  them. It was difficult to tell how many Turks we accounted for. As dark  came on, the occupants of the disabled car abandoned it and joined the  other one, which was standing off the enemy but had lost all four tires  and was running on its rims. We held a consultation and decided to stay  where we were until dawn. We had scarcely made the decision when one of  our cyclists arrived with orders from the brigade commander to return  immediately. Although exceedingly loath to leave the armored car, we had  no other course than to obey.    It was after midnight by the time we made back to camp. We were told that  a small attack had been planned for the morning, and that then we could go  out with the troops and recover our car, using some artillery horses to  drag it free. The troops soon began filing past, but we didn't pull out  till three o'clock, by which time we were reinforced by an armored car  from another battery. We were held back behind the advanced cavalry until  daylight, and felt certain that the Turks would have either destroyed or  succeeded in removing our car. Nor were we wrong, for just as we breasted  the hill that brought the scene of yesterday's engagement into view, we  saw the smoke of an explosion and the men running back into the village.  We cleared the village with the help of a squadron of the Twenty-First  cavalry, and found that the car had been almost freed during the night. It  was a bad wreck, but we were able to tow it. I wished to have a reckoning  with the village head man, and walked to an isolated group of houses a few  hundred yards to the left of the village. As I neared them a lively  fusillade opened and I had to take refuge in a convenient irrigation  ditch. The country was so broken that it was impossible for us to operate,  so we towed the car back to camp.    [Illustration: Hauling out a badly bogged fighting car]    [Illustration: A Mesopotamian garage]    Our section from Deli Abbas was moved up to take the place of the one that  had been engaged, which now returned to Baghdad. We were camped at  Mirjana, a few miles north of Kizil Robat, on the Diyala River. A pontoon  bridge was thrown across and the cars were taken over to the right bank,  where we bivouacked with a machine-gun company and a battalion of native  infantry. The bed of the river was very wide, and although throughout the  greater part of the year the water flowed only through the narrow main  channel, in the time of the spring floods the whole distance was a riotous  yellow torrent. We had no sooner got the cars across than the river began  to rise. During the first night part of the bridge was carried away, and  the rest was withdrawn. The rise continued; trees and brush were swept  racing past. We made several fruitless attempts to get across in the  clumsy pontoons, but finally gave it up, resigning ourselves to being  marooned. We put ourselves on short rations and waited for the river to  fall. If"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13670"],[0,"The Happy Family (#10)"],[1,"joy coming his way. I'm going to town.\"        \"'Break, break, break, on thy cold, gray crags, oh sea,      And I would that my tongue could utter the thoughts that come over me.'    \"You will observe, gentlemen, the beautiful sentiment, the euphonious  rhythm, the noble--\" Weary went down, still declaiming mincingly,  beneath four irate bodies that hurled themselves toward him and upon  him.    \"We'll break, break, break every bone in your body if you don't shut  up. You will observe the beautiful sentiment of _that_ a while,\" cried  Pink viciously. \"I've had the euphonious rhythm of my sleep broke up  ever since I set there and listened at her for two hours. Josephine!\"    Irish stopped with his hand on the door knob. \"I was the jay that  started it,\" he admitted contritely. \"But, honest, I never had a hunch  she was plumb locoed; I thought she was just simply foolish. Come on  to town, boys!\"    Such is the power of suggestion that in fifteen minutes the Happy  Family had passed out of sight over the top of the grade; all save  Andy Green, who told them he would be along after a while, and that  they need not wait. He looked at the clock, smoked a meditative  cigarette and went up to the White House, to attend the second meeting  of the Mutual Improvement and Social Society.    When he faced alone Miss Verbena Martin, and explained that the other  members were unavoidably absent because they had a grudge against a  man in Dry Lake and had gone in to lynch him and burn the town, Miss  Martin was shocked into postponing the meeting. Andy said he was glad,  because he wanted to go in and see the fight; undoubtedly, he assured  her, there would be a fight, and probably a few of them would get  killed off. He reminded her that he had told her right in the start  that they were a bad lot, and that she would have hard work reforming  them; and finally, he made her promise that she would not mention to  anyone what he had told her, because it wouldn't be safe for him, or  for her, if they ever got to hear of it. After that Andy also took the  trail to town, and he went at a gallop and smiled as he rode.    Miss Martin reflected shudderingly upon the awful details of the  crime, as hinted at by Andy, and packed her trunk. It might be brave  and noble to stay and work among all those savages, but she doubted  much whether it were after all her duty. She thought of many ways in  which she could do more real good nearer home. She had felt all along  that these cowboys were an untrustworthy lot; she had noticed them  glancing at one another in a secret and treacherous manner, all  through the last meeting, and she was positive they had not given her  that full confidence without which no good can be accomplished. That  fellow they called Happy looked capable of almost any crime; she had  never felt quite safe in his presence.    Miss Martin pictured them howling and dancing around the burning  dwellings of their enemies, shooting every one they could see; Miss  Martin had imagination, of a sort. But while she pictured the horrors  of an Indian massacre she continued to pack her suit-case and to  consult often her watch. When she could do no more it occurred to her  that she would better see if someone could take her to the station.  Fortunately for all concerned, somebody could. One might go further  and say that somebody was quite willing to strain a point, even, in  order to get her there in time for the next train.           *       *       *       *       *    The Happy Family was gathered in Rusty Brown's place, watching Irish  do things to a sheep-man from Lonesome Prairie, in a game of pool.  They were just giving vent to a prolonged whoop of derision at the  sheep-man's play, when a rig flashed by the window. Weary stopped with  his mouth wide open and stared; leaned to the window and craned to see  more clearly.    \"Mama mine!\" he ejaculated incredulously. \"I could swear I saw Miss  Verbena in that rig, with her trunk, and headed towards the depot.  Feel my pulse, Cadwolloper, and see if I'm normal.\"    But Pink was on his way to the back door, and from there climbed like  a cat to the roof of the coal-house, where, as he knew from  experience, one could see the trail to the depot, and the depot  itself.    \"It's sure her,\" he announced. \"Chip's driving like hell, and the  smoke uh the train's just coming around the bend from the big field.  Wonder what struck her so sudden?\" He turned and looked down into the  grinning face of Andy Green.    \"She was real insulted because you fellows played hookey,\" Andy  explained. \"I tried to explain, but it didn't help none. I don't  believe her heart went out to us like she claimed, anyhow.\"           *       *       *       *       *          HAPPY JACK, WILD MAN.      Happy Jack, over on the Shonkin range, saw how far it was to the river  and mopped the heat-crimsoned face of him with a handkerchief not  quite as clean as it might have been. He hoped that the Flying U  wagons would be where he had estimated that they would be; for he was  aweary of riding with a strange outfit, where his little personal  peculiarities failed to meet with that large tolerance accorded by the  Happy Family. He didn't think much of the Shonkin crew; grangers and  pilgrims, he called them disgustedly in his mind. He hoped the Old Man  would not send him on that long trip with them south of the  Highwoods--which is what he was on his way to find out about. What  Happy Jack was hoping for, was to have the Old Man--as represented by  Chip--send one of the boys back with him to bring over what Flying U  cattle had been gathered, together with Happy's bed and string of  horses. Then he would ride with the Happy Family on the familiar range  that was better, in his eyes, than any other range that ever lay  outdoors--and the Shonkin outfit could go to granny. (Happy did not,  however, say \"granny\").    He turned down the head of a coulee which promised to lead him, by the  most direct route--if any route in the Badlands can be called  direct--to the river, across which, and a few miles up on Suction  Creek, he confidently expected to find the Flying U wagons. The coulee  wound aimlessly, with precipitous sides that he could not climb, even  by leading his horse. Happy Jack, under the sweltering heat of  mid-June sunlight, once more mopped his face, now more crimson than  ever, and relapsed into his habitual gloom. Just when he was telling  himself pessimistically that the chances were he would run slap out on  a cut bank where he couldn't get down to the river at all, the coulee  turned again and showed the gray-blue water slithering coolly past,  with the far bank green and sloping invitingly.    The horse hurried forward at a shuffling trot and thrust his hot  muzzle into the delicious coolness. Happy Jack slipped off and, lying  flat on his stomach, up-stream from the horse, drank deep and long,  then stood up, wiped his face and considered the necessity of  crossing. Just at this point the river was not so wide as in others,  and for that reason the current flowed swiftly past. Not too swiftly,  however, if one took certain precautions. Happy Jack measured mentally  the strength of the current and the proper amount of caution which it  would be expedient to use, and began his preparations; for the sun was  sliding down hill toward the western skyline, and he wished very much  to reach the wagons in time for supper, if he could.    Standing in the shade of the coulee wall, he undressed deliberately,  folding each garment methodically as he took it off. When the pile was  complete to socks and boots, he rolled it into a compact bundle and  tied it firmly upon his saddle. Stranger, his horse, was a good  swimmer, and always swam high out of water. He hoped the things would  not get very wet; still, the current was strong, and his  characteristic pessimism suggested that they would be soaked to the  last thread. So, naked as our first ancestor, he urged his horse into  the stream, and when it was too deep for kicking--Stranger was ever  uncertain and not to be trusted too far--he caught him firmly by the  tail and felt the current grip them both. The feel of the water was  glorious after so long a ride in the hot sun, and Happy Jack reveled  in the cool swash of it up his shoulders to the back of his neck, as  Stranger swam out and across to the sloping, green bank on the home  side. When his feet struck bottom, Happy Jack should have waded  also--but the water was so deliciously cool, slapping high up on his  shoulders like that; he still floated luxuriously, towed by  Stranger--until Stranger, his footing secure, glanced back at Happy  sliding behind like a big, red fish, snorted and plunged up and on to  dry land.    Happy Jack struck his feet down to bottom, stumbled and let go his  hold of the tail, and Stranger, feeling the weight loosen suddenly,  gave another plunge and went careering up the bank, snorting back at  Happy Jack. Happy swore, waded out and made threats, but Stranger,  seeing himself pursued by a strange figure whose only resemblance to  his master lay in voice and profanity, fled in terror before him.    Happy Jack, crippling painfully on the stones, fled fruitlessly after,  still shouting threats. Then, as Stranger, galloping wildly,  disappeared over a ridge, he stood and stared stupidly at the place  where the horse had last been seen. For the moment his mind refused to  grasp all the horror of his position; he stepped gingerly over the hot  sand and rocks, sought the shelter of a bit of overhanging bank, and  sat dazedly down upon a rock too warm for comfort. He shifted uneasily  to the sand beside, found that still hotter, and returned to the rock.    He needed to think; to grasp this disaster that had come so suddenly  upon him. He looked moodily across to the southern bank, his chin  sunken between moist palms, the while the water dried upon his person.  To be set"]]]
