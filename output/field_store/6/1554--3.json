But just  then a lady from the top of the steps said: 'Your tea is getting cold,'  and Lord Arthur turned to go; but just before he went Lavender says to  him: 'I'll come back to-night. You'll have the money then.'    \"George Higgins, it appears, after he had heard this interesting  conversation, pondered as to whether he could not turn what he knew into  some sort of profit. Being a gentleman who lives entirely by his wits,  this type of knowledge forms his chief source of income. As a  preliminary to future moves, he decided not to lose sight of Lavender  for the rest of the day.    \"'Lavender went and had dinner at The Black Swan,' explained Mr. George  Higgins, 'and I, after I had had a bite myself, waited outside till I  saw him come out. At about ten o'clock I was rewarded for my trouble. He  told the hall porter to get him a fly and he jumped into it. I could not  hear what direction he gave the driver, but the fly certainly drove off  towards the racecourse.    \"'Now, I was interested in this little affair,' continued the witness,  'and I couldn't afford a fly. I started to run. Of course, I couldn't  keep up with it, but I thought I knew which way my gentleman had gone. I  made straight for the racecourse, and for the hedge at the bottom of  Lord Arthur Skelmerton's grounds.    \"'It was rather a dark night and there was a slight drizzle. I couldn't  see more than about a hundred yards before me. All at once it seemed to  me as if I heard Lavender's voice talking loudly in the distance. I  hurried forward, and suddenly saw a group of two figures--mere blurs in  the darkness--for one instant, at a distance of about fifty yards from  where I was.    \"'The next moment one figure had fallen forward and the other had  disappeared. I ran to the spot, only to find the body of the murdered  man lying on the ground. I stooped to see if I could be of any use to  him, and immediately I was collared from behind by Lord Arthur  himself.'    \"You may imagine,\" said the man in the corner, \"how keen was the  excitement of that moment in court. Coroner and jury alike literally  hung breathless on every word that shabby, vulgar individual uttered.  You see, by itself his evidence would have been worth very little, but  coming on the top of that given by James Terry, its significance--more,  its truth--had become glaringly apparent. Closely cross-examined, he  adhered strictly to his statement; and having finished his evidence,  George Higgins remained in charge of the constables, and the next  witness of importance was called up.    \"This was Mr. Chipps, the senior footman in the employment of Lord  Arthur Skelmerton. He deposed that at about 10.30 on the Friday evening  a 'party' drove up to 'The Elms' in a fly, and asked to see Lord Arthur.  On being told that his lordship had company he seemed terribly put out.    \"'I hasked the party to give me 'is card,' continued Mr. Chipps, 'as I  didn't know, perhaps, that 'is lordship might wish to see 'im, but I  kept 'im standing at the 'all door, as I didn't altogether like his  looks. I took the card in. His lordship and the gentlemen was playin'  cards in the smoking-room, and as soon as I could do so without  disturbing 'is lordship, I give him the party's card.'    \"'What name was there on the card?' here interrupted the coroner.    \"'I couldn't say now, sir,' replied Mr. Chipps; 'I don't really  remember. It was a name I had never seen before. But I see so many  visiting cards one way and the other in 'is lordship's 'all that I can't  remember all the names.'    \"'Then, after a few minutes' waiting, you gave his lordship the card?  What happened then?'    \"''Is lordship didn't seem at all pleased,' said Mr. Chipps with much  guarded dignity; 'but finally he said: \"Show him into the library,  Chipps, I'll see him,\" and he got up from the card table, saying to the  gentlemen: \"Go on without me; I'll be back in a minute or two.\"    \"'I was about to open the door for 'is lordship when my lady came into  the room, and then his lordship suddenly changed his mind like, and said  to me: \"Tell that man I'm busy and can't see him,\" and 'e sat down again  at the card table. I went back to the 'all, and told the party 'is  lordship wouldn't see 'im. 'E said: \"Oh! it doesn't matter,\" and went  away quite quiet like.'    \"'Do you recollect at all at what time that was?' asked one of the jury.    \"'Yes, sir, while I was waiting to speak to 'is lordship I looked at  the clock, sir; it was twenty past ten, sir.'    \"There was one more significant fact in connection with the case, which  tended still more to excite the curiosity of the public at the time, and  still further to bewilder the police later on, and that fact was  mentioned by Chipps in his evidence. The knife, namely, with which  Charles Lavender had been stabbed, and which, remember, had been left in  the wound, was now produced in court. After a little hesitation Chipps  identified it as the property of his master, Lord Arthur Skelmerton.    \"Can you wonder, then, that the jury absolutely refused to bring in a  verdict against George Higgins? There was really, beyond Lord Arthur  Skelmerton's testimony, not one particle of evidence against him,  whilst, as the day wore on and witness after witness was called up,  suspicion ripened in the minds of all those present that the murderer  could be no other than Lord Arthur Skelmerton himself.    \"The knife was, of course, the strongest piece of circumstantial  evidence, and no doubt the police hoped to collect a great deal more now  that they held a clue in their hands. Directly after the verdict,  therefore, which was guardedly directed against some person unknown, the  police obtained a warrant and later on arrested Lord Arthur in his own  house.\"    \"The sensation, of course, was tremendous. Hours before he was brought  up before the magistrate the approach to the court was thronged. His  friends, mostly ladies, were all eager, you see, to watch the dashing  society man in so terrible a position. There was universal sympathy for  Lady Arthur, who was in a very precarious state of health. Her worship  of her worthless husband was well known; small wonder that his final and  awful misdeed had practically broken her heart. The latest bulletin  issued just after his arrest stated that her ladyship was not expected  to live. She was then in a comatose condition, and all hope had perforce  to be abandoned.    \"At last the prisoner was brought in. He looked very pale, perhaps, but  otherwise kept up the bearing of a high-bred gentleman. He was  accompanied by his solicitor, Sir Marmaduke Ingersoll, who was evidently  talking to him in quiet, reassuring tones.    \"Mr. Buchanan prosecuted for the Treasury, and certainly his indictment  was terrific. According to him but one decision could be arrived at,  namely, that the accused in the dock had, in a moment of passion, and  perhaps of fear, killed the blackmailer who threatened him with  disclosures which might for ever have ruined him socially, and, having  committed the deed and fearing its consequences, probably realizing that  the patrolling constables might catch sight of his retreating figure,  he had availed himself of George Higgins's presence on the spot to  loudly accuse him of the murder.    \"Having concluded his able speech, Mr. Buchanan called his witnesses,  and the evidence, which on second hearing seemed more damning than ever,  was all gone through again.    \"Sir Marmaduke had no question to ask of the witnesses for the  prosecution; he stared at them placidly through his gold-rimmed  spectacles. Then he was ready to call his own for the defence. Colonel  McIntosh, R.A., was the first. He was present at the bachelors' party  given by Lord Arthur the night of the murder. His evidence tended at  first to corroborate that of Chipps the footman with regard to Lord  Arthur's orders to show the visitor into the library, and his  counter-order as soon as his wife came into the room.    \"'Did you not think it strange, Colonel?' asked Mr. Buchanan, 'that Lord  Arthur should so suddenly have changed his mind about seeing his  visitor?'    \"'Well, not exactly strange,' said the Colonel, a fine, manly, soldierly  figure who looked curiously out of his element in the witness-box. 'I  don't think that it is a very rare occurrence for racing men to have  certain acquaintances whom they would not wish their wives to know  anything about.'    \"'Then it did not strike you that Lord Arthur Skelmerton had some  reason for not wishing his wife to know of that particular visitor's  presence in his house?'    \"'I don't think that I gave the matter the slightest serious  consideration,' was the Colonel's guarded reply.    \"Mr. Buchanan did not press the point, and allowed the witness to  conclude his statements.    \"'I had finished my turn at bridge,' he said, 'and went out into the  garden to smoke a cigar. Lord Arthur Skelmerton joined me a few minutes  later, and we were sitting in the pavilion when I heard a loud and, as I  thought, threatening voice from the other side of the hedge.    \"'I did not catch the words, but Lord Arthur said to me: \"There seems to  be a row down there. I'll go and have a look and see what it is.\" I  tried to dissuade him, and certainly made no attempt to follow him, but  not more than half a minute could have elapsed before I heard a cry and  a groan, then Lord Arthur's footsteps hurrying down the wooden stairs  which lead on to the racecourse.'    \"You may imagine,\" said the man in the corner, \"what severe  cross-examination the gallant Colonel had to undergo in order that his  assertions might in some way be shaken by the prosecution, but with  military precision and frigid calm he repeated his important statements  amidst a general silence, through which you could have heard"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10574"],[0,"The History of England, Volume I (#10)"],[1,"laying the  foundations of a new kingdom.  Escus was content to possess in  tranquillity the kingdom of Kent, which he left in 512 to his son  Octa, in whose time the East Saxons established their monarchy, and  dismembered the provinces of Essex and Middlesex from that of Kent.  His death, after a reign of twenty-two years, made room for his son  Hermenric in 534, who performed nothing memorable during a reign of  thirty-two years, except associating with him his son Ethelbert in the  government, that he might secure the succession in his family, and  prevent such revolutions as are incident to a turbulent and barbarous  monarchy.    Ethelbert revived the reputation of his family, which had languished  for some generations.  The inactivity of his predecessors, and the  situation of his country, secured from all hostility with the Britons,  seem to have much enfeebled the warlike genius of the Kentish Saxons;  and Ethelbert, in his first attempt to aggrandize his country, and  distinguish his own name, was unsuccessful [f].  He was twice  discomfited in battle by Ceaulin, King of Wessex; and obliged to yield  the superiority in the Heptarchy to that ambitious monarch, who  preserved no moderation in his victory, and by reducing the kingdom of  Sussex to subjection, excited jealousy in all the other princes.  An  association was formed against him; and Ethelbert, intrusted with the  command of the allies  gave him battle, and obtained a decisive  victory [g ].  Ceaulin died soon after; and Ethelbert succeeded as  well to his ascendant among the Saxon states, as to his other  ambitious projects.  He reduced all the princes, except the King of  Northumberland, to a strict dependence upon him; and even established  himself by force on the throne of Mercia, the most extensive of the  Saxon kingdoms.  Apprehensive, however, of a dangerous league against  him, like that by which he himself had been enabled to overthrow  Ceaulin, he had the prudence to resign the kingdom of Mercia to Webba,  the rightful heir, the son of Crida, who had first founded that  monarchy.  But governed still by ambition more than by justice, he  gave Webba possession of the crown on such conditions as rendered him  little better than a tributary prince under his artful benefactor.  [FN [f] Chron. Sax. p. 21.  [g] H. Hunting. lib. 2.]    But the most memorable event which distinguished the reign of this  great prince, was the introduction of the Christian religion among the  English Saxons.  The superstition of the Germans, particularly that of  the Saxons, was of the grossest and most barbarous kind; and being  founded on traditional tales received from their ancestors, not  reduced to any system, nor supported by political institutions, like  that of the Druids, it seems to have made little impression on its  votaries, and to have easily resigned its place to the new doctrine  promulgated to them.  Woden, whom they deemed the ancestor of all  their princes, was regarded as the god of war, and, by a natural  consequence, became their supreme deity, and the chief object of their  religious worship.  They believed that, if they obtained the favour of  this divinity by their valour, (for they made less account of the  other virtues,) they should be admitted after their death into his  hall; and, reposing on couches, should satiate themselves with ale  from the skulls of their enemies whom they had slain in battle.  Incited by this idea of paradise, which gratified at once the passion  of revenge and that of intemperance, the ruling inclinations of  barbarians, they despised the dangers of war, and increased their  native ferocity against the vanquished by their religious prejudices.  We know little of the other theological tenets of the Saxons: we only  learn that they were polytheists; that they worshipped the sun and  moon; that they adored the god of thunder under the name of Thor; that  they had images in their temples; that they practised sacrifices;  believed firmly in spells and enchantments; and admitted in general a  system of doctrines which they held as sacred, but which, like all  other superstitions, must carry the air of the wildest extravagance,  if propounded to those who are not familiarized to it from their  earliest infancy.    The constant hostilities which the Saxons maintained against the  Britons, would naturally indispose them for receiving the Christian  faith, when preached to them by such inveterate enemies; and perhaps  the Britons, as is objected to them by Gildas and Bede, were not over  fond of communicating to their cruel invaders the doctrine of eternal  life and salvation.  But as a civilized people, however subdued by  arms, still maintain a sensible superiority over barbarous and  ignorant nations, all the other northern conquerors of Europe had been  already induced to embrace the Christian faith, which they found  established in the empire; and it was impossible but the Saxons,  informed of this event, must have regarded with some degree of  veneration a doctrine which had acquired the ascendant over all their  brethren.  However limited in their views, they could not but have  perceived a degree of cultivation in the southern countries beyond  what they themselves possessed; and it was natural for them to yield  to that superior knowledge as well as zeal, by which the inhabitants  of the Christian kingdoms were even at that time distinguished.    But these causes might long have failed of producing any considerable  effect, had not a favourable incident prepared the means of  introducing Christianity into Kent.  Ethelbert, in his father's  lifetime, had married Bertha, the only daughter of Caribert, King of  Paris [h], one of the descendants of Clovis, the conqueror of Gaul;  but before he was admitted to this alliance, he was obliged to  stipulate, that the princess should enjoy the free exercise of her  religion; a concession not difficult to be obtained from the  idolatrous Saxons [i].  Bertha brought over a  French bishop to the  court of Canterbury; and being zealous for the propagation of her  religion, she had been very assiduous in her devotional exercises, had  supported the credit of her faith by an irreproachable conduct, and  had employed every art of insinuation and address to reconcile her  husband to her religious principles.  Her popularity in the court, and  her influence over Ethelbert, had so well paved the way for the  reception of the Christian doctrine, that Gregory, surnamed the Great,  then Roman pontiff, began to entertain hopes of effecting a project,  which he himself, before he mounted the papal throne, had once  embraced, of converting the British Saxons.  [FN [h] Greg. of Tours, lib. 9. cap. 26.  H. Hunting. lib. 2.  [i]  Bede, lib. 1. cap. 25.  Brompton, p. 729.]    It happened that this prelate, at that time in a private station, had  observed in the market-place of Rome some Saxon youth exposed to sale,  whom the Roman merchants, in their trading voyages to Britain, had  bought of their mercenary parents.  Struck with the beauty of their  fair complexions and blooming countenances, Gregory asked to what  country they belonged; and being told they were ANGLES, he replied  that they ought more properly to be denominated ANGELS: it were a pity  that the prince of darkness should enjoy so fair a prey, and that so  beautiful a frontispiece should cover a mind destitute of internal  grace and righteousness.  Inquiring farther concerning the name of  their province, he was informed that it was Deiri, a district of  Northumberland: DEIRI, replied he, THAT IS GOOD!  THEY ARE CALLED TO  THE MERCY OF GOD FROM HIS ANGER, De ira.  BUT WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE  KING OF THAT PROVINCE?  He was told it was Aella or Alla: ALLELUIAH,  cried he: WE MUST ENDEAVOUR THAT THE PRAISES OF GOD BE SUNG IN THAT  COUNTRY.  Moved by these allusions, which appeared to him so happy, he  determined to undertake himself a mission into Britain; and having  obtained the pope's approbation, he prepared for that perilous  journey: but his popularity at home was so great, that the Romans,  unwilling to expose him to such dangers, opposed his design; and he  was obliged, for the present, to lay aside all farther thoughts of  executing that pious purpose [k].  [FN [k] Bede, lib. 2. cap. 1.  Spell. Conc. p. 91.]    The controversy between the Pagans and the Christians was not entirely  cooled in that age; and no pontiff before Gregory, had ever carried to  greater excess an intemperate zeal against the former religion.  He  had waged war with all the precious monuments of the ancients, and  even with their writings, which, as appears from the strain of his own  wit, as well as from the style of his compositions, he had not taste  or genius sufficient to comprehend.  Ambitious to distinguish his  pontificate by the conversion of the British Saxons, he pitched on  Augustine, a Roman monk, and sent him with forty associates to preach  the gospel in this island.  These missionaries, terrified with the  dangers which might attend their proposing a new doctrine to so fierce  a people, of whose language they were ignorant, stopped some time in  France, and sent back Augustine to lay the hazards and difficulties  before the pope, and crave his permission to desist from the  undertaking.  But Gregory exhorted them to persevere in their purpose,  advised them to choose some interpreters from among the Franks, who  still spoke the same language with the Saxons [l]; and recommended  them to the good offices of Queen Brunehaut, who had at this time  usurped the sovereign power in France.  This princess, though stained  with every vice of treachery and cruelty, either possessed or  pretended great zeal for the cause; and Gregory acknowledged that to  her friendly assistance was, in a great measure, owing the success of  that undertaking [m].
