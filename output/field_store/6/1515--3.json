FRANK BAUM          This Book is Dedicated    To My Granddaughter    OZMA BAUM          To My Readers    Some of my youthful readers are developing wonderful imaginations. This  pleases me. Imagination has brought mankind through the Dark Ages to  its present state of civilization. Imagination led Columbus to discover  America. Imagination led Franklin to discover electricity. Imagination  has given us the steam engine, the telephone, the talking-machine and  the automobile, for these things had to be dreamed of before they  became realities. So I believe that dreams--day dreams, you know, with  your eyes wide open and your brain-machinery whizzing--are likely to  lead to the betterment of the world. The imaginative child will become  the imaginative man or woman most apt to create, to invent, and  therefore to foster civilization. A prominent educator tells me that  fairy tales are of untold value in developing imagination in the young.  I believe it.    Among the letters I receive from children are many containing  suggestions of \"what to write about in the next Oz Book.\" Some of the  ideas advanced are mighty interesting, while others are too extravagant  to be seriously considered--even in a fairy tale. Yet I like them all,  and I must admit that the main idea in \"The Lost Princess of Oz\" was  suggested to me by a sweet little girl of eleven who called to see me  and to talk about the Land of Oz. Said she: \"I s'pose if Ozma ever got  lost, or stolen, ev'rybody in Oz would be dreadful sorry.\"    That was all, but quite enough foundation to build this present story  on. If you happen to like the story, give credit to my little friend's  clever hint.    L.

FRANK BAUM        CHAPTER 1    A TERRIBLE LOSS      There could be no doubt of the fact: Princess Ozma, the lovely girl  ruler of the Fairyland of Oz, was lost.  She had completely  disappeared.  Not one of her subjects--not even her closest  friends--knew what had become of her.  It was Dorothy who first  discovered it.  Dorothy was a little Kansas girl who had come to the  Land of Oz to live and had been given a delightful suite of rooms in  Ozma's royal palace just because Ozma loved Dorothy and wanted her to  live as near her as possible so the two girls might be much together.    Dorothy was not the only girl from the outside world who had been  welcomed to Oz and lived in the royal palace.  There was another named  Betsy Bobbin, whose adventures had led her to seek refuge with Ozma,  and still another named Trot, who had been invited, together with her  faithful companion Cap'n Bill, to make her home in this wonderful  fairyland.  The three girls all had rooms in the palace and were great  chums; but Dorothy was the dearest friend of their gracious Ruler and  only she at any hour dared to seek Ozma in her royal apartments.  For  Dorothy had lived in Oz much longer than the other girls and had been  made a Princess of the realm.    Betsy was a year older than Dorothy and Trot was a year younger, yet  the three were near enough of an age to become great playmates and to  have nice times together.  It was while the three were talking together  one morning in Dorothy's room that Betsy proposed they make a journey  into the Munchkin Country, which was one of the four great countries of  the Land of Oz ruled by Ozma.  \"I've never been there yet,\" said Betsy  Bobbin, \"but the Scarecrow once told me it is the prettiest country in  all Oz.\"    \"I'd like to go, too,\" added Trot.      \"All right,\" said Dorothy.  \"I'll go and ask Ozma.  Perhaps she will  let us take the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon, which would be much nicer  for us than having to walk all the way.  This Land of Oz is a pretty  big place when you get to all the edges of it.\"    So she jumped up and went along the halls of the splendid palace until  she came to the royal suite, which filled all the front of the second  floor.  In a little waiting room sat Ozma's maid, Jellia Jamb, who was  busily sewing.  \"Is Ozma up yet?\" inquired Dorothy.    \"I don't know, my dear,\" replied Jellia.  \"I haven't heard a word from  her this morning.  She hasn't even called for her bath or her  breakfast, and it is far past her usual time for them.\"    \"That's strange!\" exclaimed the little girl.    \"Yes,\" agreed the maid, \"but of course no harm could have happened to  her.  No one can die or be killed in the Land of Oz, and Ozma is  herself a powerful fairy, and she has no enemies so far as we know.  Therefore I am not at all worried about her, though I must admit her  silence is unusual.\"    \"Perhaps,\" said Dorothy thoughtfully, \"she has overslept.  Or she may  be reading or working out some new sort of magic to do good to her  people.\"    \"Any of these things may be true,\" replied Jellia Jamb, \"so I haven't  dared disturb our royal mistress.  You, however, are a privileged  character, Princess, and I am sure that Ozma wouldn't mind at all if  you went in to see her.\"    \"Of course not,\" said Dorothy, and opening the door of the outer  chamber, she went in.  All was still here.  She walked into another  room, which was Ozma's boudoir, and then, pushing back a heavy drapery  richly broidered with threads of pure gold, the girl entered the  sleeping-room of the fairy Ruler of Oz.  The bed of ivory and gold was  vacant; the room was vacant; not a trace of Ozma was to be found.    Very much surprised, yet still with no fear that anything had happened  to her friend, Dorothy returned through the boudoir to the other rooms  of the suite.  She went into the music room, the library, the  laboratory, the bath, the wardrobe, and even into the great throne  room, which adjoined the royal suite, but in none of these places could  she find Ozma.    So she returned to the anteroom where she had left the maid, Jellia  Jamb, and said:    \"She isn't in her rooms now, so she must have gone out.\"    \"I don't understand how she could do that without my seeing her,\"  replied Jellia, \"unless she made herself invisible.\"    \"She isn't there, anyhow,\" declared Dorothy.    \"Then let us go find her,\" suggested the maid, who appeared to be a  little uneasy.  So they went into the corridors, and there Dorothy  almost stumbled over a queer girl who was dancing lightly along the  passage.    \"Stop a minute, Scraps!\" she called, \"Have you seen Ozma this morning?\"    \"Not I!\" replied the queer girl, dancing nearer.  \"I lost both my eyes  in a tussle with the Woozy last night, for the creature scraped 'em  both off my face with his square paws.  So I put the eyes in my pocket,  and this morning Button-Bright led me to Aunt Em, who sewed 'em on  again.  So I've seen nothing at all today, except during the last five  minutes.  So of course I haven't seen Ozma.\"    \"Very well, Scraps,\" said Dorothy, looking curiously at the eyes, which  were merely two round, black buttons sewed upon the girl's face.    There were other things about Scraps that would have seemed curious to  one seeing her for the first time.  She was commonly called \"the  Patchwork Girl\" because her body and limbs were made from a gay-colored  patchwork quilt which had been cut into shape and stuffed with cotton.  Her head was a round ball stuffed in the same manner and fastened to  her shoulders.  For hair, she had a mass of brown yarn, and to make a  nose for her a part of the cloth had been pulled out into the shape of  a knob and tied with a string to hold it in place. Her mouth had been  carefully made by cutting a slit in the proper place and lining it with  red silk, adding two rows of pearls for teeth and a bit of red flannel  for a tongue.    In spite of this queer make-up, the Patchwork Girl was magically alive  and had proved herself not the least jolly and agreeable of the many  quaint characters who inhabit the astonishing Fairyland of Oz. Indeed,  Scraps was a general favorite, although she was rather flighty and  erratic and did and said many things that surprised her friends. She  was seldom still, but loved to dance, to turn handsprings and  somersaults, to climb trees and to indulge in many other active sports.    \"I'm going to search for Ozma,\" remarked Dorothy, \"for she isn't in her  rooms, and I want to ask her a question.\"    \"I'll go with you,\" said Scraps, \"for my eyes are brighter than yours,  and they can see farther.\"    \"I'm not sure of that,\" returned Dorothy.  \"But come along, if you  like.\"    Together they searched all through the great palace and even to the  farthest limits of the palace grounds, which were quite extensive, but  nowhere could they find a trace of Ozma.  When Dorothy returned to  where Betsy and Trot awaited her, the little girl's face was rather  solemn and troubled, for never before had Ozma gone away without  telling her friends where she was going, or without an escort that  befitted her royal state.  She was gone, however, and none had seen her  go.  Dorothy had met and questioned the Scarecrow, Tik-Tok, the Shaggy  Man, Button-Bright, Cap'n Bill, and even the wise and powerful Wizard  of Oz, but not one of them had seen Ozma since she parted with her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/960"],[0,"The Tin Woodman of Oz (#1)"],[1,"TIN WOODMAN OF OZ      by    L.

I, too, have wondered what became of her, but  until Woot the Wanderer interested himself in the matter the Tin  Woodman knew no more than we did. However, he found her, after many  thrilling adventures, as you will discover when you have read this  story.    I am delighted at the continued interest of both young and old in the  Oz stories. A learned college professor recently wrote me to ask: \"For  readers of what age are your books intended?\" It puzzled me to answer  that properly, until I had looked over some of the letters I have  received. One says: \"I'm a little boy 5 years old, and I Just love your  Oz stories. My sister, who is writing this for me, reads me the Oz  books, but I wish I could read them myself.\" Another letter says: \"I'm  a great girl 13 years old, so you'll be surprised when I tell you I am  not too old yet for the Oz stories.\"  Here's another letter: \"Since I  was a young girl I've never missed getting a Baum book for Christmas.  I'm married, now, but am as eager to get and read the Oz stories as  ever.\" And still another writes: \"My good wife and I, both more than 70  years of age, believe that we find more real enjoyment in your Oz books  than in any other books we read.\" Considering these statements, I wrote  the college professor that my books are intended for all those whose  hearts are young, no matter what their ages may be.    I think I am justified in promising that there will be some astonishing  revelations about The Magic of Oz in my book for 1919. Always your  loving and grateful friend,    L. FRANK BAUM.

Beside him, in a chair of woven straw, sat his best friend, the  Scarecrow of Oz. At times they spoke to one another of curious things  they had seen and strange adventures they had known since first they  two had met and become comrades. But at times they were silent, for  these things had been talked over many times between them, and they  found themselves contented in merely being together, speaking now and  then a brief sentence to prove they were wide awake and attentive. But  then, these two quaint persons never slept. Why should they sleep, when  they never tired?    And now, as the brilliant sun sank low over the Winkie Country of Oz,  tinting the glistening tin towers and tin minarets of the tin castle  with glorious sunset hues, there approached along a winding pathway  Woot the Wanderer, who met at the castle entrance a Winkie servant.    The servants of the Tin Woodman all wore tin helmets and tin  breastplates and uniforms covered with tiny tin discs sewed closely  together on silver cloth, so that their bodies sparkled as beautifully  as did the tin castle--and almost as beautifully as did the Tin Woodman  himself.    Woot the Wanderer looked at the man servant--all bright and  glittering--and at the magnificent castle--all bright and  glittering--and as he looked his eyes grew big with wonder. For Woot  was not very big and not very old and, wanderer though he was, this  proved the most gorgeous sight that had ever met his boyish gaze.    \"Who lives here?\" he asked.    \"The Emperor of the Winkies, who is the famous Tin Woodman of Oz,\"  replied the servant, who had been trained to treat all strangers with  courtesy.    \"A Tin Woodman?  How queer!\" exclaimed the little wanderer.    \"Well, perhaps our Emperor is queer,\" admitted the servant; \"but he is  a kind master and as honest and true as good tin can make him; so we,  who gladly serve him, are apt to forget that he is not like other  people.\"    \"May I see him?\" asked Woot the Wanderer, after a moment's thought.    \"If it please you to wait a moment, I will go and ask him,\" said the  servant, and then he went into the hall where the Tin Woodman sat with  his friend the Scarecrow. Both were glad to learn that a stranger had  arrived at the castle, for this would give them something new to talk  about, so the servant was asked to admit the boy at once.    By the time Woot the Wanderer had passed through the grand  corridors--all lined with ornamental tin--and under stately tin  archways and through the many tin rooms all set with beautiful tin  furniture, his eyes had grown bigger than ever and his whole little  body thrilled with amazement. But, astonished though he was, he was  able to make a polite bow before the throne and to say in a respectful  voice: \"I salute your Illustrious Majesty and offer you my humble  services.\"    \"Very good!\" answered the Tin Woodman in his accustomed cheerful  manner. \"Tell me who you are, and whence you come.\"    \"I am known as Woot the Wanderer,\" answered the boy, \"and I have come,  through many travels and by roundabout ways, from my former home in a  far corner of the Gillikin Country of Oz.\"    \"To wander from one's home,\" remarked the Scarecrow, \"is to encounter  dangers and hardships, especially if one is made of meat and bone. Had  you no friends in that corner of the Gillikin Country? Was it not  homelike and comfortable?\"    To hear a man stuffed with straw speak, and speak so well, quite  startled Woot, and perhaps he stared a bit rudely at the Scarecrow. But  after a moment he replied:    \"I had home and friends, your Honorable Strawness, but they were so  quiet and happy and comfortable that I found them dismally stupid.  Nothing in that corner of Oz interested me, but I believed that in  other parts of the country I would find strange people and see new  sights, and so I set out upon my wandering journey. I have been a  wanderer for nearly a full year, and now my wanderings have brought me  to this splendid castle.\"    \"I suppose,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"that in this year you have seen so  much that you have become very wise.\"    \"No,\" replied Woot, thoughtfully, \"I am not at all wise, I beg to  assure your Majesty. The more I wander the less I find that I know, for  in the Land of Oz much wisdom and many things may be learned.\"    \"To learn is simple. Don't you ask questions?\" inquired the Scarecrow.    \"Yes; I ask as many questions as I dare; but some people refuse to  answer questions.\"    \"That is not kind of them,\" declared the Tin Woodman. \"If one does not  ask for information he seldom receives it; so I, for my part, make it a  rule to answer any civil question that is asked me.\"    \"So do I,\" added the Scarecrow, nodding.    \"I am glad to hear this,\" said the Wanderer, \"for it makes me bold to  ask for something to eat.\"    \"Bless the boy!\" cried the Emperor of the Winkies; \"how careless of me  not to remember that wanderers are usually hungry. I will have food  brought you at once.\"    Saying this he blew upon a tin whistle that was suspended from his tin  neck, and at the summons a servant appeared and bowed low. The Tin  Woodman ordered food for the stranger, and in a few minutes the servant  brought in a tin tray heaped with a choice array of good things to eat,  all neatly displayed on tin dishes that were polished till they shone  like mirrors. The tray was set upon a tin table drawn before the  throne, and the servant placed a tin chair before the table for the boy  to seat himself.    \"Eat, friend Wanderer,\" said the Emperor cordially, \"and I trust the  feast will be to your liking. I, myself, do not eat, being made in such  manner that I require no food to keep me alive. Neither does my friend  the Scarecrow. But all my Winkie people eat, being formed of flesh, as  you are, and so my tin cupboard is never bare, and strangers are always  welcome to whatever it contains.\"    The boy ate in silence for a time, being really hungry, but after his  appetite was somewhat satisfied, he said:    \"How happened your Majesty to be made of tin, and still be alive?\"    \"That,\" replied the tin man, \"is a long story.\"    \"The longer the better,\" said the boy. \"Won't you please tell me the  story?\"    \"If you desire it,\" promised the Tin Woodman, leaning back in his tin  throne and crossing his tin legs. \"I haven't related my history in a  long while, because everyone here knows it nearly as well as I do. But  you, being a stranger, are no doubt curious to learn how I became so  beautiful and prosperous, so I will recite for your benefit my strange  adventures.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Woot the Wanderer, still"]]]
