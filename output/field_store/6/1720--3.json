Thus  the upward movement begins--and all begins to move Spiritward. Matter  becomes less gross; the Units spring into being; the combinations begin  to form; Life appears and manifests in higher and higher forms; and Mind  becomes more and more in evidence--the vibrations constantly becoming  higher. In short, the entire process of Evolution, in all of its phases,  begins, and proceeds according to the established \"Laws of the  Indrawing\" process. All of this occupies aeons upon aeons of Man's time,  each aeon containing countless millions of years, but yet the Illumined  inform us that the entire creation, including Involution and Evolution,  of an Universe, is but \"as the twinkle of the eye\" to THE ALL.  At the  end of countless cycles of aeons of time, THE ALL withdraws its  Attention--its Contemplation and Meditation--of the Universe, for the  Great Work is finished--and All is withdrawn into THE ALL from which it  emerged. But Mystery of Mysteries--the Spirit of each soul is not  annihilated, but is infinitely expanded--the Created and the Creator are  merged. Such is the report of the Illumined!    The above illustration of the \"meditation,\" and subsequent \"awakening  from meditation,\" of THE ALL, is of course but an attempt of the  teachers to describe the Infinite process by a finite example. And, yet:  \"As Below, so Above.\" The difference is merely in degree. And just as  THE ALL arouses itself from the meditation upon the Universe, so does  Man (in time) cease from manifesting upon the Material Plane, and  withdraws himself more and more into the Indwelling Spirit, which is  indeed \"The Divine Ego.\"    There is one more matter of which we desire to speak in this lesson, and  that comes very near to an invasion of the Metaphysical field of  speculation, although our purpose is merely to show the futility of such  speculation. We allude to the question which inevitably comes to the  mind of all thinkers who have ventured to seek the Truth. The question  is: \"WHY does THE ALL create Universes\" The question may be asked in  different forms, but the above is the gist of the inquiry.    Men have striven hard to answer this question, but still there is no  answer worthy of the name. Some have imagined that THE ALL had something  to gain by it, but this is absurd, for what could THE ALL gain that it  did not already possess? Others have sought the answer in the idea that  THE ALL \"wished something to love\" and others that it created for  pleasure, or amusement; or because it \"was lonely\" or to manifest its  power;--all puerile explanations and ideas, belonging to the childish  period of thought.    Others have sought to explain the mystery by assuming that THE ALL found  itself \"compelled\" to create, by reason of its own \"internal  nature\"--its \"creative instinct.\" This idea is in advance of the others,  but its weak point lies in the idea of THE ALL being \"compelled\" by  anything, internal or external. If its \"internal nature,\" or \"creative  instinct,\" compelled it to do anything, then the \"internal nature\" or  \"creative instinct\" would be the Absolute, instead of THE ALL, and so  accordingly that part of the proposition falls. And, yet, THE ALL does  create and manifest, and seems to find some kind of satisfaction in so  doing. And it is difficult to escape the conclusion that in some  infinite degree it must have what would correspond to an \"inner nature,\"  or \"creative instinct,\" in man, with correspondingly infinite Desire and  Will. It could not act unless it Willed to Act; and it would not Will to  Act, unless it Desired to Act and it would not Desire to Act unless it  obtained some Satisfaction thereby. And all of these things would belong  to an \"Inner Nature,\" and might be postulated as existing according to  the Law of Correspondence. But, still, we prefer to think of THE ALL as  acting entirely FREE from any influence, internal as well as external.  That is the problem which lies at the root of difficulty--and the  difficulty that lies at the root of the problem.    Strictly speaking, there cannot be said to be any \"Reason\" whatsoever  for THE ALL to act, for a \"reason\" implies a \"cause,\" and THE ALL is  above Cause and Effect, except when it Wills to become a Cause, at which  time the Principle is set into motion. So, you see, the matter is  Unthinkable, just as THE ALL is Unknowable. Just as we say THE ALL  merely \"IS\"--so we are compelled to say that \"THE ALL ACTS BECAUSE IT  ACTS.\" At the last, THE ALL is All Reason in Itself; All Law in Itself;  All Action in Itself--and it may be said, truthfully, that THE ALL is  Its Own Reason; its own Law; its own Act--or still further, that THE  ALL; Its Reason; Its Act; is Law; are ONE, all being names for the same  thing. In the opinion of those who are giving you these present lessons,  the answer is locked up in the INNER SELF of THE ALL, along with its  Secret of Being. The Law of Correspondence, in our opinion, reaches only  to that aspect of THE ALL, which may be spoken of as \"The Aspect of  BECOMING.\" Back of that Aspect is \"The Aspect of BEING\" in which all  Laws are lost in LAW; all Principles merge into PRINCIPLE--and THE ALL;  PRINCIPLE; and BEING; are IDENTICAL, ONE AND THE SAME. Therefore,  Metaphysical speculation on this point is futile. We go into the matter  here, merely to show that we recognize the question, and also the  absurdity of the ordinary answers of metaphysics and theology.    In conclusion, it may be of interest to our students to learn that while  some of the ancient, and modern, Hermetic Teachers have rather inclined  in the direction of applying the Principle of Correspondence to the  question, with the result of the \"Inner Nature\" conclusion,--still the  legends have it that HERMES, the Great, when asked this question by his  advanced students, answered them by PRESSING HIS LIPS TIGHTLY TOGETHER  and saying not a word, indicating that there WAS NO ANSWER. But, then,  he may have intended to apply the axiom of his philosophy, that: \"The  lips of Wisdom are closed, except to the ears of Understanding,\"  believing that even his advanced students did not possess the  Understanding which entitled them to the Teaching. At any rate, if  Hermes possessed the Secret, he failed to impart it, and so far as the  world is concerned THE LIPS OF HERMES ARE CLOSED regarding it. And where  the Great Hermes hesitated to speak, what mortal may dare to teach?    But, remember, that whatever be the answer to this problem, if indeed  there be an answer the truth remains that:  \"While All is in THE ALL, it  is equally true that THE ALL is in All.\" The Teaching on this point is  emphatic. And, we may add the concluding words of the quotation: \"To him  who truly understands this truth, hath come great knowledge.\"        CHAPTER VIII    PLANES OF CORRESPONDENCE        \"As above, so below; as below, so above.\"--The Kybalion.    The great Second Hermetic Principle embodies the truth that there is a  harmony, agreement, and correspondence between the several planes of  Manifestation, Life and Being. This truth is a truth because all that is  included in the Universe emanates from the same source, and the same  laws, principles, and characteristics apply to each unit, or combination  of units, of activity, as each manifests its own phenomena upon its own  plane.    For the purpose of convenience of thought and study, the Hermetic  Philosophy considers that the Universe may be divided into three great  classes of phenomena, known as the Three Great Planes, namely:        1. The Great Physical Plane.      2. The Great Mental Plane.      3. The Great Spiritual Plane.    These divisions are more or less artificial and arbitrary, for the truth  is that all of the three divisions are but ascending degrees of the  great scale of Life, the lowest point of which is undifferentiated  Matter, and the highest point that of Spirit. And, moreover, the  different Planes shade into each other, so that no hard and fast  division may be made between the higher phenomena of the Physical and  the lower of the Mental; or between the higher of the Mental and the  lower of the Physical.    In short, the Three Great Planes may be regarded as three great groups  of degrees of Life Manifestation. While the purposes of this little book  do not allow us to enter into an extended discussion of, or explanation  of, the subject of these different planes, still we think it well to  give a general description of the same at this point.    At the beginning we may as well consider the question so often asked by  the neophyte, who desires to be informed regarding the meaning of the  word \"Plane\", which term has been very freely used, and very poorly  explained, in many recent works upon the subject of occultism. The  question is generally about as follows: \"Is a Plane a place having  dimensions, or is it merely a condition or state?\" We answer: \"No, not a  place, nor ordinary dimension of space; and yet more than a state or  condition. It may be considered as a state or condition, and yet the  state or condition is a degree of dimension, in a scale subject to  measurement.\" Somewhat paradoxical, is it not? But let us examine the  matter. A \"dimension,\" you know, is \"a measure in a straight line,  relating to measure,\" etc. The ordinary dimensions of space are length,  breadth, and height, or perhaps length, breadth, height, thickness or  circumference. But there is another dimension of \"created things\" or  \"measure in a straight line,\" known to occultists, and to scientists as  well, although the latter have not as yet applied the term \"dimension\"  to it--and this new dimension, which, by the way, is the much speculated  -about \"Fourth Dimension,\" is the standard used in determining the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14218"],[0,"The Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry (#10)"],[1," be  robbed of everything when his work is almost finished. The only  remedies are infinite patience, a sense of virtue, and sound reason.  \"In the pursuit of our Art,\" he says, \"you should take care, from time  to time, to unbend your mind from its sterner employments with some  convenient recreation.\"    The choice of workmen to aid in the mechanical parts of the quest was  a great trouble to the alchemists. On this subject Norton says--\"If  you would be free from all fear over the gross work, follow my  counsel, and never engage married men; for they soon give in and  pretend they are tired out.... Hire your workmen for certain  stipulated wages, and not for longer periods than twenty-four hours at  a time. Give them higher wages than they would receive elsewhere, and  be prompt and ready in your payments.\"    Many accounts are given by alchemical writers of the agent, and many  names are bestowed on it. The author of _A Brief Guide to the  Celestial Ruby_ speaks thus of the agent--\"It is our doorkeeper, our  balm, our honey, oil, urine, maydew, mother, egg, secret furnace,  oven, true fire, venomous dragon, Theriac, ardent wine, Green Lion,  Bird of Hermes, Goose of Hermogenes, two-edged sword in the hand of  the Cherub that guards the Tree of Life.... It is our true secret  vessel, and the Garden of the Sages in which our sun rises and sets.  It is our Royal Mineral, our triumphant vegetable Saturnia, and the  magic rod of Hermes, by means of which he assumes any shape he likes.\"    Sometimes we are told that the agent is mercury, sometimes that it is  gold, but not common mercury or common gold. \"Supplement your common  mercury with the inward fire which it needs, and you will soon get rid  of all superfluous dross.\" \"The agent is gold, as highly matured as  natural and artificial digestion can make it, and a thousand times  more perfect than the common metal of that name. Gold, thus exalted,  radically penetrates, tinges, and fixes metals.\"    The alchemists generally likened the work to be performed by their  agent to the killing of a living thing. They constantly use the  allegory of death, followed by resurrection, in describing the steps  whereby the Essence was to be obtained, and the processes whereby the  baser metals were to be partially purified. They speak of the  mortification of metals, the dissolution and putrefaction of  substances, as preliminaries to the appearance of the true life of the  things whose outward properties have been destroyed. For instance,  Paracelsus says: \"Destruction perfects that which is good; for the  good cannot appear on account of that which conceals it.\" The same  alchemist speaks of rusting as the mortification of metals; he says:  \"The mortification of metals is the removal of their bodily  structure.... The mortification of woods is their being turned into  charcoal or ashes.\"    Paracelsus distinguishes natural from artificial mortification,  \"Whatever nature consumes,\" he says, \"man cannot restore. But whatever  man destroys man can restore, and break again when restored.\" Things  which had been mortified by man's device were considered by Paracelsus  not to be really dead. He gives this extraordinary illustration of his  meaning: \"You see this is the case with lions, which are all born  dead, and are first vitalised by the horrible noise of their parents,  just as a sleeping person is awakened by a shout.\"    The mortification of metals is represented in alchemical books by  various images and allegories. Fig. I. is reduced from a cut in a 16th  century work, _The Book of Lambspring, a noble ancient Philosopher,  concerning the Philosophical Stone_.    [Illustration: Here the father devours the son;                 The soul and spirit flow forth from the body.                 FIG. I.]    The image used to set forth the mortification of metals is a king  swallowing his son. Figs. II. and III. are reduced from Basil  Valentine's _Twelve Keys_. Both of these figures represent the process  of mortification by images connected with death and burial.    [Illustration: FIG. II.]    In his explanation (?) of these figures, Basil Valentine says:--      \"Neither human nor animal bodies can be multiplied or propagated    without decomposition; the grain and all vegetable seed, when cast    into the ground, must decay before it can spring up again;    moreover, putrefaction imparts life to many worms and other    animalculae.... If bread is placed in honey, and suffered to decay,    ants are generated ... maggots are also developed by the decay of    nuts, apples, and pears. The same thing may be observed in regard    to vegetable life. Nettles and other weeds spring up where no such    seed has ever been sown. This occurs only by putrefaction. The    reason is that the soil in such places is so disposed, and, as it    were, impregnated, that it produces these fruits; which is a    result of the properties of sidereal influences; consequently the    seed is spiritually produced in the earth, and putrefies in the    earth, and by the operation of the elements generates corporeal    matter according to the species of nature. Thus the stars and the    elements may generate new spiritual, and ultimately, new vegetable    seed, by means of putrefaction.... Know that, in like manner, no    metallic seed can develop, or multiply, unless the said seed, by    itself alone, and without the introduction of any foreign    substance, be reduced to a perfect putrefaction.\"    [Illustration: FIG. III.]    The action of the mineral agent in perfecting substances is often  likened by the alchemists to the conjoining of the male and the  female, followed by the production of offspring. They insist on the  need of a union of two things, in order to produce something more  perfect than either. The agent, they say, must work upon something;  alone it is nothing.    The methods whereby the agent is itself perfected, and the processes  wherein the agent effects the perfecting of the less perfect things,  were divided into stages by the alchemists. They generally spoke of  these stages as _Gates_, and enumerated ten or sometimes twelve of  them. As examples of the alchemical description of these gates, I give  some extracts from _A Brief Guide to the Celestial Ruby_.    The first gate is _Calcination_, which is \"the drying up of the  humours\"; by this process the substance \"is concocted into a black  powder which is yet unctuous, and retains its radical humour.\" When  gold passes through this gate, \"We observe in it two natures, the  fixed and the volatile, which we liken to two serpents.\" The fixed  nature is likened to a serpent without wings; the volatile, to a  serpent with wings: calcination unites these two into one. The second  gate, _Dissolution_, is likened to death and burial; but the true  Essence will appear glorious and beautiful when this gate is passed.  The worker is told not to be discouraged by this apparent death. _The  mercury of the sages_ is spoken of by this author as the queen, and  gold as the king. The king dies for love of the queen, but he is  revived by his spouse, who is made fruitful by him and brings forth \"a  most royal son.\"    Figs. IV. and V. are reduced from _The Book of Lambspring_; they  express the need of the conjunction of two to produce one.      [Illustration: Here you behold a great marvel--                 Two Lions are joined into one.                   The spirit and soul must be united in their body.                 FIG. IV.]    After dissolution came _Conjunction_, wherein the separated elements  were combined. Then followed _Putrefaction_, necessary for the  germination of the seed which had been produced by calcination,  dissolution, and conjunction. Putrefaction was followed by  _Congelation_ and _Citation_. The passage through the next gate,  called _Sublimation_, caused the body to become spiritual, and the  spiritual to be made corporal. _Fermentation_ followed, whereby the  substance became soft and flowed like wax. Finally, by _Exaltation_,  the Stone was perfected.    [Illustration: Here are two birds, great and strong--the body and                 spirit; one devours the other.                   Let the body be placed in horse-dung, or a warm bath,                 the spirit having been extracted from it. The body has                 become white by the process, the spirit red by our art.                 All that exists tends towards perfection, and thus is                 the Philosopher's Stone prepared.                   FIG. V.]    The author of _The Open Entrance_ speaks of the various stages in the  perfecting of the agent as _regimens_. The beginning of the heating  of gold with mercury is likened to the king stripping off his golden  garments and descending into the fountain; this is the _regimen of  Mercury_. As the heating is continued, all becomes black; this is the  _regimen of Saturn_. Then is noticed a play of many colours; this is  the _regimen of Jupiter_: if the heat is not regulated properly, \"the  young ones of the crow will go back to the nest.\" About the end of the  fourth month you will see \"the sign of the waxing moon,\" and all  becomes white; this is the _regimen of the Moon_. The white colour  gives place to purple and green; you are now in the _regimen of  Venus_. After that, appear all the colours of the rainbow, or of a  peacock's tail; this is the _regimen of Mars_. Finally the colour  becomes orange and golden; this is the _regimen of the Sun_.    The reader may wish to have some description of the Essence. The  alchemists could describe it only in contraries. It had a bodily form,  but its method of working was spiritual. In _The Sodic Hydrolith, or  Water Stone of the Wise_ we are told:--      \"The stone is conceived below the earth, born in the earth,    quickened in heaven, dies in time, and obtains eternal glory....    It is bluish-grey and green.... It flows like water, yet it makes    no wet;"]]]
