[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13568"],[0,"Woman Suffrage By Federal Constitutional Amendment (#10)"],[1," amendment. No larger  number of negro women can be enfranchised by Federal Amendment than  will be enfranchised by State Amendment. If the women of the South  are ever to be enfranchised, it must be by (1) Federal Constitutional  Amendment, or (2) State Constitutional Amendment. If their franchise  is obtained by the former method, it will come by the votes of white  men in Congress and legislatures; if by the second, they will be  forced to appeal to voting Negroes to elevate them to their own  political status. One would suppose the first would be the preferable  method from the Southern viewpoint. It is possible that behind this  commonly spoken objection, lies a hope and belief that Southern women  will remain disfranchised forevermore. A man unfamiliar with political  history, psychology, and the science of evolution might cherish such  a belief in fancied security, but ideas cannot be shut outside the  borders of a state. There is no Southern state in which women of the  highest families are not giving their all in order to propagate this  cause, and they are doing it with so noble a spirit and so eloquent  an appeal that final surrender of the citadel of prejudice is only a  question of time. No one has ever questioned the \"fighting ability\" of  the South. That ability is not confined to men. Courage, intelligence,  conviction and willingness to sacrifice characterize the suffrage  movement in every state, and the South is no exception. The women of  that section will vote; the question is how long must they work, how  much must they sacrifice to win that which has so freely been granted  to men of all classes?    White supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by woman suffrage.  In the fifteen states south of the Mason and Dixon line are:      8,788,901 white women,    4,316,565 negro women, or    4,472,336 more white than negro women.    The total negro population is 8,294,274, and white women outnumber  both negro males and females by nearly half a million. In two states  only, South Carolina and Mississippi, are there more negro than white  women, and in these states there are more negro men than white men. In  South Carolina, voters must read, own and pay taxes on $300 worth of  property. In Mississippi, voters must read the Constitution. The  other four states of the \"black belt\"--Georgia, Florida, Alabama and  Louisiana--impose an educational test. Women voters would be compelled  to submit to the same qualifications. In the other nine states white  women exceed the total negro population. Woman suffrage in the South  would so vastly increase the white vote that it would guarantee white  supremacy if it otherwise stood in danger of overthrow. If a sly dread  of female supremacy is troubling the doubter he may find comfort in  the rather astonishing fact that white males over 21 are considerably  in excess of white females over 21 in all except Maryland and North  Carolina; negro females over 21 exceed negro males in Alabama,  Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, but  the restrictions in these states of property ownership represented  by tax receipts, education and various other tests, would fall more  heavily upon women than men, and thus admit fewer women than men to  the vote. If the South really wants White Supremacy, it will urge  the enfranchisement of women.

Clark, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, said:    \"In North Carolina such a decision would readmit to the polls 125,000  negro votes. What preparation have we made to meet such a possible  result? I know of but one remedy. The census shows that the white  population of North Carolina is seventy per cent. and the colored  population thirty per cent. It follows that the white adult women of  North Carolina are more in numbers than the negro men and negro women  combined. _The votes of 260,000 white women can be relied on to  stand solid against any measure or any man who proposes to question  Anglo-Saxon supremacy._    \"I am not intimating that the admission of the white women to the  polls will secure democratic supremacy (they will not impair it),  nor that it will prejudice the republican element. The equal suffrage  movement has never proceeded on party lines and the women would scorn  to be admitted unless they were as free in their choice of party  measures and candidates as the men. But what I am saying is that  if the negroes are readmitted by a decision of the Federal Court to  suffrage, the 260,000 votes of the white women of the State will be  one solid obstacle to any measure that would impair either for them or  their children the continuance of white supremacy.\"      III. WOMEN DO NOT WANT TO VOTE AND HENCE IT IS UNFAIR TO THRUST THE  VOTE UPON THEM BY FEDERAL AMENDMENT.    We have two classes of voters in the United States, young men who  automatically become voters at twenty-one, and naturalized citizens.  No one among them has ever been asked whether he wishes the vote. It  was \"thrust upon them\" all as a privilege which each would use or not  as he desired. To extend the suffrage to those who do not desire it is  no hardship, since only those who wish the privilege will use it. On  the other hand, it becomes an intolerable oppression to deny it to  those who want it. The vote is permissive, not obligatory. It imposes  no definite responsibility; it extends a liberty. That there are women  who do not want the vote is true, but the well-known large number of  qualified men who do not use the vote, indicates that the desire to  have someone else assume the responsibility of public service is not  confined to women. It is an easy excuse to say \"wait until all the  women want it,\" but it is a poor rule which doesn't work both ways.  Had it been necessary for members of Congress to wait until all men  wanted the vote before they had one for themselves, we should be  living in an unconstitutional monarchy. More, had it been necessary  for women to wait until all women approved of college or even public  school education for girls, property rights, the right of free speech,  or any one of the many liberties now enjoyed by women, but formerly  denied them, the iniquities of the old common law would still measure  the privileges of women, and high schools and colleges would still  close their doors to women.    A certain way to test whether any class of people want the vote is to  note the numbers of those who use it when granted.    As men and women voters do not use separate boxes and as initials  are often employed by both sexes in registration, election officials  invariably reply to queries as to the number of women actually voting  in their respective states, that positive figures are not obtainable.  Yet the testimony, while lacking definite statement, is overwhelming  that women in all lands vote in about the same proportion as men.  Women in Illinois, not being possessed of complete suffrage rights,  have voted in separate boxes, and figures are therefore obtainable.  The report from the City of Chicago for 1916 as submitted by the Chief  Clerk of the Board of Election Commissioners is as follows:                       REGISTRATION        Men             Women            Total      504,674          303,801          808,475                     VOTES CAST NOV 7        Men             Women            Total    487,210--96.5%   289,444--95.2%   776,654--96%                  VOTES CAST--DEMOCRATIC        Men             Women            Total      217,328          133,847          351,175                  VOTES CAST--REPUBLICAN        Men             Women            Total      235,328          141,533          377,201                 PROGRESSIVE AND SOCIALIST                        48,278    Although New York City is nearly two and a half times as large as  Chicago, the registration of the latter exceeded that of New York by  69,307.    The following is quoted from an official statement issued by the  California Civic League on what the women of California have done with  the vote:        \"Th"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13575"],[0,"How to Observe in Archaeology (#10)"],[1,"dull-fractured paste not  unlike modern earthenware, but usually dark-coloured. These wares  begin in the Hellenistic period, and go on into the Roman and early  Byzantine Ages. They have sometimes a little ornament in a hard white  or cream 'slip' which stands up above the surface of the vase. These  fabrics are all for table use, or for tomb-furniture, and are usually  of small size.    H.  Pottery with vitreous glaze like modern earthenware only appears on  Byzantine and Turkish sites. There a few late Greek and Roman fabrics  of glazed ware, mostly of dark brown and olive-green tints; but they  are rare, and usually found in tombs. The earlier glazes are applied  directly to the clay; later a white or coloured slip is applied  first, and a clear siliceous glaze over this.    3. Inscriptions and Monuments.    A. Hittite Civilization. (See figures, Illustration VI: Hittite  Inscriptions, etc.)    (1) From 2000 B.C. onwards baked clay tablets with cuneiform (or  wedge-shaped) writing (Illustration VI, Fig. 1) to be found anywhere  in Eastern Asia Minor, within the Halys bend and south of it, in  Southern Cappadocia, in Cilicia, and in North Syria up to the  Euphrates.    (2) 1000-700 B.C. probably: inscriptions generally cut on stone, dark  and hard (black basalt), or on the living rock, in hieroglyphic  writing. The hieroglyphs are either cut in relief (VI, Fig. 4) or  incised (VI, Fig. 2). Found in the same region and sporadically west  of the Halys.    (3) From 1400 B.C. and 900 B.C. onwards monuments and sculpture.  Human figures are short and thick, generally wearing boots with toes  turned up (VI, Fig. 3.) Found in the same regions as the inscriptions  and also west of the Halys to the sea.    B. Lydian inscriptions.    From about 500 B.C. Letters mostly like Greek capitals (sometimes  reversed); (Illustration IV, at bottom).    C. Lycian inscriptions and monuments.    From about 500 B.C. inscriptions, sometimes with a Greek translation.  (IV, at bottom.)    Monuments, mostly with inscriptions, are generally tombs in stone,  built to imitate wood, with the ends of beams projecting or showing.    D. Greek antiquities.    (1) Early period to 323 B.C. the great Greek colonies on the seaboard  and in the coast valleys really formed an outlying part of Greece,  and for them the section on Greece should be consulted.    (2) Periods of Seleucid and Pergamene rule, 323-130 B.C.  Inscriptions of these periods to be found mostly in the coastal  region, rarely on the plateau. Chiefly royal ordinances, thank  offerings, municipal honorary inscriptions, decrees, covenants, and  the like.    (3) Graeco-Roman period, 130 B.C.-A.D. 400.  Language of inscriptions remains normally Greek, though the lettering  gradually assumes a different character from century to century,  steadily deteriorating. The Phrygian language, written in Greek  letters, survives for several centuries in epitaphs, part of the  inscription often being in Greek.    Latin inscriptions are not common except in Roman colonies during the  earlier centuries of their existence. Elsewhere they are chiefly  official documents of various kinds (e.g. imperial ordinances,  milestones usually of columnar shape with the Emperor's titles,  boundary stones, &c.), or expressions of homage to Emperors, honorary  inscriptions to governors and other officials, dedications, epitaphs,  &c. Sometimes a Greek version is added.    Latin inscriptions of the Republican period (recording decrees of the  Senate) are extremely rare.      [ILLUSTRATION VI: HITTITE INSCRIPTIONS, ETC.]          CHAPTER IV      CYPRUS    [The traveller will find the _Catalogue of the Cyprus Museum_, by J.  L. Myres and M. Ohnefalsch-Richter (Oxford, 1899) indispensable for  the study of Cypriote Antiquities. Reference may also be made to  Myres, _Catalogue of the Cesnola Collection of Antiquities from  Cyprus_ (New York, 1914). They contain numerous illustrations of  types, and make diagrams for the present section unnecessary.]    The principal classes of ancient remains are as follows:    Settlements.  These are usually much devastated by the removal of building  materials to more recent habitations; or are obscured by modern towns  and villages on the same site. All foundations in squared masonry, or  composed of unusually large stones, should be noted and protected as  far as possible. The frequent presence of large building stones, and  especially of architectural fragments, in recent house-walls probably  indicates the neighbourhood of an ancient building: and all  reconstructions and fresh foundation-trenches should be kept under  observation. The present Antiquity Law provides for the inspection  and custody of ancient remains so exposed: the Curator of Ancient  Monuments is charged with the supervision of all buildings and  monuments above ground; the Keeper of Antiquities for the custody of  movable objects, and for the registration of those already in private  possession. Taking into consideration the utility of good building  material to the present owners of such sites, active co-operation to  preserve ancient masonry is not to be expected, unless local  patriotism and expectation of traffic from tourists can be enlisted  in support of Government regulations. Architectural fragments found  in reconstruction are often best preserved by arranging that they  shall be built conspicuously into one of the new walls, well above  ground-level, or transferred to the nearest church or school-house.    Sanctuaries  usually consist of a walled enclosure containing numerous pedestals  and bases of votive statues and other monuments. Usually only the  foundation-walls are of stone, as the same sun-dried brick was  commonly used in ancient as in modern times for the superstructure.  Such sites are often vary shallow, and when they occur in the open  country are liable to be disturbed by ploughing, when the smaller  statuettes and terra-cotta figures may be turned up in considerable  numbers. As most of our knowledge of the sculpture, as well as of the  religious observances, of ancient Cyprus is derived from such sites,  all such indications should be reported at once to the Keeper of  Antiquities, and arrangements made for the site to be examined with a  view to excavation before it is cultivated further. The sculpture on  these sites begins usually in the seventh century B.C.; before that  period terra-cotta figures were in use as far back as the ninth or  tenth century. Figures of 'Mixed Oriental' style, resembling Assyrian  or Egyptian work, give place about 500 B.C. to a provincial Greek  style, which passes gradually into Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman. The  material is almost invariably the soft local limestone, and the  workmanship is often clumsy; but even the coarser examples should be  treated carefully, as they were sometimes completed in colours which  are easily destroyed by too vigorous washing. The first cleaning  should be with gently running water only.    Tombs  are of all periods, and are found not only around historical sites  and actual ruins, but also in localities where the settlement to  which they belonged has wholly disappeared. Though simple graves were  always in use among the poorest folk, the commonest form of tomb at  all periods is a rock-cut chamber entered by a door in one side, to  which access is given by a shaft or sloping passage (_dromos_) cut  likewise in the rock. The earliest are but a few feet from the  surface, just deep enough to ensure a firm roof to the chamber; later  the depth is as much as 12 or 15 feet. Occasionally the chamber, and  even the passage, is built of masonry and roofed with stone slabs or  a corbel vault, and the simple door-slab gives place to a stone door,  hinged, or sliding in a grooved frame. Cremation was occasionally  practised in the Hellenistic Age, but the regular custom was to bury  the body; during the Bronze Age in a sitting or a contracted posture,  in all later periods lying at full length. Stone coffins  (_sarcophagi_), with a lid, were used occasionally by the rich from  the sixth century onwards, and wooden coffins in the Graeco-Roman  period. There is always as rich a tomb-equipment as the mourners  could afford, of personal ornaments, wreaths, provisions, weapons,  and other gear, especially pottery; and terra-cotta figures of men,  animals, furniture, and other objects for the use of the deceased. In  Graeco-Roman tombs pottery is supplemented or replaced by glass  vessels, and coins are frequent, and are important evidence of date.  Most of our knowledge of Cypriote arts and industries comes from this  tomb-equipment, which should therefore if possible be preserved  entire and kept together, tomb by tomb; not neglecting the skeletons  themselves, which are of value to indicate changes in the island  population. The position of tombs was often marked by gravestones  above ground; these remain scattered in the surface soil, or  collected to block the entrances to later tombs. They are frequently  inscribed. A very common form in Greco-Roman times is the _cippus_, a  short column, like an altar.    Pottery and other objects  from tombs, and also from settlements, is classified as follows:    Stone Age: not clearly represented in Cyprus; but some of the  earliest tombs (with rude varieties of red hand-made ware) contain no  metallic objects, and may belong to the latest neolithic period.  Stone implements are very rare, and should be carefully recorded,  with a note of the spot where they were found.    Bronze Age, early period (before 2000 B.C.): polished red ware,  hand-made, sometimes with incised ornament filled with white powder.    Bronze Age, middle period (2000-1500 B.C.): polished red ware, and  also white hand-made ware with painted linear ornament in dull black  or brown.    Bronze Age, late period (1500-1200 B.C.): degenerate polished red  and painted white ware; wheel-made white ware with painted"]]]
