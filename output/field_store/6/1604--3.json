But for sure behind this mystery o' the  death o' Sir Lucien there's a darker mystery still; sair dark. 'Tis the  biggest case ye ever had. Dinna look for Kazmah. Look tee find why the  woman went tee him; and try tee find the meanin' o' the sma' window  behind the big chair.... Yes\"--she seemed to be staring at some distant  visible object--\"watch the man Mareno--\"    \"But--Mrs. Irvin--\"    \"Is in God's guid keepin'--\"    \"You don't think she's dead!\"    \"She is wairse than dead. Her sins have found her out.\" The fey light  suddenly left her eyes, and they became filled with tears. She turned  impulsively to her husband. \"Oh, Dan! Ye must find her! Ye must find  her! Puir weak hairt--dinna ye ken how she is suffering!\"    \"My dear,\" he said, putting his arms around her, \"What is it? What is  it?\"    She brushed the tears from her eyes and tried to smile. \"'Tis something  like the second sight, Dan,\" she answered simply. \"And it's escapit  me again. I a'most had the clue to it a' oh, there's some horrible  wickedness in it, an' cruelty an' shame.\"    The clock on the mantel shelf began to peal. Kerry was watching his  wife's rosy face with a mixture of loving admiration and wonder. She  looked so very bonny and placid and capable that he was puzzled anew at  the strange gift which she seemingly inherited from her mother, who had  been equally shrewd, equally comely and similarly endowed.    \"God bless us all!\" he said, kissed her heartily, and stood up. \"Back  to bed you go, my dear. I must be off. There's Mr. Irvin to see in the  morning, too.\"    A few minutes later he was swinging through the deserted streets, his  mind wholly occupied with lover-like reflections to the exclusion of  those professional matters which properly should have been engaging  his attention. As he passed the end of a narrow court near the railway  station, the gleam of his silver mounted malacca attracted the attention  of a couple of loafers who were leaning one on either side of an iron  pillar in the shadow of the unsavory alley. Not another pedestrian was  in sight, and only the remote night-sounds of London broke the silence.    Twenty paces beyond, the footpads silently closed in upon their prey.  The taller of the pair reached him first, only to receive a back-handed  blow full in his face which sent him reeling a couple of yards.    Round leapt the assaulted man to face his second assailant.    \"If you two smarts really want handling,\" he rapped ferociously, \"say  the word, and I'll bash you flat.\"    As he turned, the light of a neighboring lamp shone down upon the savage  face, and a smothered yell came from the shorter ruffian:    \"Blimey, Bill! It's Red Kerry!\"    Whereupon, as men pursued by devils, the pair made off like the wind!    Kerry glared after the retreating figures for a moment, and a grin of  fierce satisfaction revealed his gleaming teeth. He turned again and  swung on his way toward the main road. The incident had done him good.  It had banished domestic matters from his mind, and he was become again  the highly trained champion of justice, standing, an unseen buckler,  between society and the criminal.        CHAPTER IX. A PACKET OF CIGARETTES    Following their dismissal by Chief Inspector Kerry, Seton and Gray  walked around to the latter's chambers in Piccadilly. They proceeded in  silence, Gray too angry for speech, and Seton busy with reflections. As  the man admitted them:    \"Has anyone 'phoned, Willis?\" asked Gray.    \"No one, sir.\"    They entered a large room which combined the characteristics of a  library with those of a military gymnasium. Gray went to a side table  and mixed drinks. Placing a glass before Seton, he emptied his own at a  draught.    \"If you'll excuse me for a moment,\" he said, \"I should like to ring up  and see if by any possible chance there's news of Rita.\"    He walked out to the telephone, and Seton heard him making a call. Then:    \"Hullo! Is that you, Hinkes?\" he asked.... \"Yes, speaking. Is Mrs. Irvin  at home?\"    A few moments of silence followed, and:    \"Thanks! Good-bye,\" said Gray.    He rejoined his friend.    \"Nothing,\" he reported, and made a gesture of angry resignation.  \"Evidently Hinkes is still unaware of what has happened. Irvin hasn't  returned yet. Seton, this business is driving me mad.\"    He refilled his glass, and having looked in his cigarette-case, began to  ransack a small cupboard.    \"Damn it all!\" he exclaimed. \"I haven't got a cigarette in the place!\"    \"I don't smoke them myself,\" said Seton, \"but I can offer you a  cheroot.\"    \"Thanks. They are a trifle too strong. Hullo! here are some.\"    From the back of a shelf he produced a small, plain brown packet, and  took out of it a cigarette at which he stared oddly. Seton, smoking one  of the inevitable cheroots, watched him, tapping his teeth with the rim  of his eyeglass.    \"Poor old Pyne!\" muttered Gray, and, looking up, met the inquiring  glance. \"Pyne left these here only the other day,\" he explained  awkwardly. \"I don't know where he got them, but they are something very  special. I suppose I might as well.\"    He lighted one, and, uttering a weary sigh, threw himself into a deep  leather-covered arm-chair. Almost immediately he was up again. The  telephone bell had rung. His eyes alight with hope, he ran out, leaving  the door open so that his conversation was again audible to the visitor.    \"Yes, yes, speaking. What?\" His tone changed \"Oh, it's you, Margaret.  What?... Certainly, delighted. No, there's nobody here but old Seton  Pasha. What? You've heard the fellows talk about him who were out  East.... Yes, that's the chap.... Come right along.\"    \"You don't propose to lionise me, I hope, Gray?\" said Seton, as Gray  returned to his seat.    The other laughed.    \"I forgot you could hear me,\" he admitted. \"It's my cousin, Margaret  Halley. You'll like her. She's a tip-top girl, but eccentric. Goes in  for pilling.\"    \"Pilling?\" inquired Seton gravely.    \"Doctoring. She's an M.R.C.S., and only about twenty-four or so.  Fearfully clever kid; makes me feel an infant.\"    \"Flat heels, spectacles, and a judicial manner?\"    \"Flat heels, yes. But not the other. She's awfully pretty, and used to  look simply terrific in khaki. She was an M.O. in Serbia, you know, and  afterwards at some nurses' hospital in Kent. She's started in practice  for herself now round in Dover Street. I wonder what she wants.\"    Silence fell between them; for, although prompted by different reasons,  both were undesirous of discussing the tragedy; and this silence  prevailed until the ringing of the doorbell announced the arrival of  the girl. Willis opening the door, she entered composedly, and Gray  introduced Seton.    \"I am so glad to have met you at last, Mr. Seton,\" she said laughingly.  \"From Quentin's many accounts I had formed the opinion that you were a  kind of Arabian Nights myth.\"    \"I am glad to disappoint you,\" replied Seton, finding something very  refreshing in the company of this pretty girl, who wore a creased  Burberry, and stray locks of whose abundant bright hair floated about  her face in the most careless fashion imaginable.    She turned to her cousin, frowning in a rather puzzled way.    \"Whatever have you been burning here?\" she asked. \"There is such a  curious smell in the room.\"    Gray laughed more heartily than he had laughed that night, glancing in  Seton's direction.    \"So much for your taste in cigars!\" he cried    \"Oh!\" said Margaret, \"I'm sure it's not Mr. Seton's cigar. It isn't a  smell of tobacco.\"    \"I don't believe they're made of tobacco!\" cried Gray, laughing louder  yet, although his merriment was forced.    Seton smiled good-naturedly at the joke, but he had perceived at the  moment of Margaret's entrance the fact that her gaiety also was assumed.  Serious business had dictated her visit, and he wondered the more to  note how deeply this odor, real or fancied, seemed to intrigue her.    She sat down in the chair which Gray placed by the fireside, and her  cousin unceremoniously slid the brown packet of cigarettes across the  little table in her direction.    \"Try one of these, Margaret,\" he said. \"They are great, and will quite  drown the unpleasant odor of which you complain.\"    Whereupon the observant Seton saw a quick change take place in the  girl's expression. She had the same clear coloring as her cousin, and  now this freshness deserted her cheeks, and her pretty face became quite  pale. She was staring at the brown packet. \"Where did you get them?\" she  asked quietly.    A smile faded from Gray's lips. Those five words had translated him  in spirit to that green-draped room in which Sir Lucien Pyne was lying  dead. He glanced at Seton in the appealing way which sometimes made him  appear so boyish.    \"Er--from Pyne,\" he replied. \"I must tell you, Margaret--\"    \"Sir Lucien Pyne?\" she interrupted.    \"Yes.\"    \"Not from Rita Irvin?\"    Quentin Gray started upright in his chair.    \"No! But why do you mention her?\"    Margaret bit her lip in sudden perplexity.    \"Oh, I don't know.\" She glanced apologetically toward Seton. He rose  immediately.    \"My dear Miss Halley,\" he said, \"I perceive, indeed I had perceived all  along, that you have something of a private nature to communicate to  your cousin.\"    But Gray stood up, and:    \"Seton!... Margaret!\" he said, looking from one to the other. \"I mean  to say, Margaret, if you've anything to tell me about Rita... Have you?  Have you?\"    He fixed his gaze eagerly upon her.    \"I have--yes.\"    Seton prepared to take his leave, but Gray impetuously thrust him back,  immediately turning again to his cousin.    \"Perhaps you haven't heard, Margaret,\" he began. \"I have heard what has  happened tonight--to Sir Lucien.\"    Both men stared at her silently for a moment.    \"Seton has been with me all the time,\" said Gray. \"If he will consent to  stay,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1183"],[0,"The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu (#10)"],[1," the lies which fell from those  perfect lips, triumphant in a conquest that must end in his undoing;  deeming, poor fool, that for love of him this pearl of the Orient was  about to betray her master, to resign herself a prize to the victor!    Companioned by these bitter reflections, I had lost the remainder of the  conversation between Nayland Smith and the police officer; now, casting  off the succubus memory which threatened to obsess me, I put forth a  giant mental effort to purge my mind of this uncleanness, and became  again an active participant in the campaign against the Master--the  director of all things noxious.    Our plans being evidently complete, Smith seized my arm, and I found  myself again out upon the avenue. He led me across the road and into the  gate of a house almost opposite. From the fact that two upper windows  were illuminated, I adduced that the servants were retiring; the other  windows were in darkness, except for one on the ground floor to the  extreme left of the building, through the lowered venetian blinds  whereof streaks of light shone out.    \"Slattin's study!\" whispered Smith. \"He does not anticipate  surveillance, and you will note that the window is wide open!\"    With that my friend crossed the strip of lawn, and careless of the fact  that his silhouette must have been visible to any one passing the gate,  climbed carefully up the artificial rockery intervening, and crouched  upon the window-ledge peering into the room.    A moment I hesitated, fearful that if I followed, I should stumble or  dislodge some of the larva blocks of which the rockery was composed.    Then I heard that which summoned me to the attempt, whatever the cost.    Through the open window came the sound of a musical voice--a voice  possessing a haunting accent, possessing a quality which struck upon my  heart and set it quivering as though it were a gong hung in my bosom.    Karamaneh was speaking.    Upon hands and knees, heedless of damage to my garments, I crawled up  beside Smith. One of the laths was slightly displaced and over this my  friend was peering in. Crouching close beside him, I peered in also.    I saw the study of a business man, with its files, neatly arranged works  of reference, roll-top desk, and Milner safe. Before the desk, in a  revolving chair, sat Slattin. He sat half turned toward the window,  leaning back and smiling; so that I could note the gold crown which  preserved the lower left molar. In an armchair by the window, close,  very close, and sitting with her back to me, was Karamaneh!    She, who, in my dreams, I always saw, was ever seeing, in an Eastern  dress, with gold bands about her white ankles, with jewel-laden fingers,  with jewels in her hair, wore now a fashionable costume and a hat that  could only have been produced in Paris. Karamaneh was the one Oriental  woman I had ever known who could wear European clothes; and as I watched  that exquisite profile, I thought that Delilah must have been just such  another as this, that, excepting the Empress Poppaea, history has record  of no woman, who, looking so innocent, was yet so utterly vile.    \"Yes, my dear,\" Slattin was saying, and through his monocle ogling his  beautiful visitor, \"I shall be ready for you to-morrow night.\"    I felt Smith start at the words.    \"There will be a sufficient number of men?\"    Karamaneh put the question in a strangely listless way.    \"My dear little girl,\" replied Slattin, rising and standing looking down  at her, with his gold tooth twinkling in the lamplight, \"there will be a  whole division, if a whole division is necessary.\"    He sought to take her white gloved hand, which rested upon the chair  arm; but she evaded the attempt with seeming artlessness, and stood up.  Slattin fixed his bold gaze upon her.    \"So now, give me my orders,\" he said.    \"I am not prepared to do so, yet,\" replied the girl, composedly; \"but  now that I know you are ready, I can make my plans.\"    She glided past him to the door, avoiding his outstretched arm with an  artless art which made me writhe; for once I had been the willing victim  of all these wiles.    \"But--\" began Slattin.    \"I will ring you up in less than half an hour,\" said Karamaneh and  without further ceremony, she opened the door.    I still had my eyes glued to the aperture in the blind, when Smith began  tugging at my arm.    \"Down! you fool!\" he hissed harshly--\"if she sees us, all is lost!\"    Realizing this, and none too soon, I turned, and rather clumsily  followed my friend. I dislodged a piece of granite in my descent; but,  fortunately, Slattin had gone out into the hall and could not well have  heard it.    We were crouching around an angle of the house, when a flood of light  poured down the steps, and Karamaneh rapidly descended. I had a glimpse  of a dark-faced man who evidently had opened the door for her, then all  my thoughts were centered upon that graceful figure receding from me  in the direction of the avenue. She wore a loose cloak, and I saw this  fluttering for a moment against the white gate posts; then she was gone.    Yet Smith did not move. Detaining me with his hand he crouched there  against a quick-set hedge; until, from a spot lower down the hill,  we heard the start of the cab which had been waiting. Twenty seconds  elapsed, and from some other distant spot a second cab started.    \"That's Weymouth!\" snapped Smith. \"With decent luck, we should know  Fu-Manchu's hiding-place before Slattin tells us!\"    \"But--\"    \"Oh! as it happens, he's apparently playing the game.\"--In the  half-light, Smith stared at me significantly--\"Which makes it all the  more important,\" he concluded, \"that we should not rely upon his aid!\"    Those grim words were prophetic.    My companion made no attempt to communicate with the detective (or  detectives) who shared our vigil; we took up a position close under the  lighted study window and waited--waited.    Once, a taxi-cab labored hideously up the steep gradient of the avenue  ... It was gone. The lights at the upper windows above us became  extinguished. A policeman tramped past the gateway, casually flashing  his lamp in at the opening. One by one the illuminated windows in other  houses visible to us became dull; then lived again as mirrors for the  pallid moon. In the silence, words spoken within the study were clearly  audible; and we heard someone--presumably the man who had opened the  door--inquire if his services would be wanted again that night.    Smith inclined his head and hung over me in a tense attitude, in order  to catch Slattin's reply.    \"Yes, Burke,\" it came--\"I want you to sit up until I return; I shall be  going out shortly.\"    Evidently the man withdrew at that; for a complete silence followed  which prevailed for fully half an hour. I sought cautiously to move my  cramped limbs, unlike Smith, who seeming to have sinews of piano-wire,  crouched beside me immovable, untiringly. Then loud upon the stillness,  broke the strident note of the telephone bell.    I started, nervously, clutching at Smith's arm. It felt hard as iron to  my grip.    \"Hullo!\" I heard Slattin call--\"who is speaking?... Yes, yes! This is  Mr. A. S.... I am to come at once?... I know where--yes I ... you  will meet me there?... Good!--I shall be with you in half an hour....  Good-by!\"    Distinctly I heard the creak of the revolving office-chair as Slattin  rose; then Smith had me by the arm, and we were flying swiftly away from  the door to take up our former post around the angle of the building.  This gained:    \"He's going to his death!\" rapped Smith beside me; \"but Carter has a cab  from the Yard waiting in the nearest rank. We shall follow to see where  he goes--for it is possible that Weymouth may have been thrown off the  scent; then, when we are sure of his destination, we can take a hand in  the game! We...\"    The end of the sentence was lost to me--drowned in such a frightful wave  of sound as I despair to describe. It began with a high, thin scream,  which was choked off staccato fashion; upon it followed a loud and  dreadful cry uttered with all the strength of Slattin's lungs--    \"Oh, God!\" he cried, and again--\"Oh, God!\"    This in turn merged into a sort of hysterical sobbing.    I was on my feet now, and automatically making for the door. I had a  vague impression of Nayland Smith's face beside me, the eyes glassy with  a fearful apprehension. Then the door was flung open, and, in the bright  light of the hall-way, I saw Slattin standing--swaying and seemingly  fighting with the empty air.    \"What is it? For God's sake, what has happened!\" reached my ears  dimly--and the man Burke showed behind his master. White-faced I saw him  to be; for now Smith and I were racing up the steps.    Ere we could reach him, Slattin, uttering another choking cry, pitched  forward and lay half across the threshold.    We burst into the hall, where Burke stood with both his hands raised  dazedly to his head. I could hear the sound of running feet upon the  gravel, and knew that Carter was coming to join us.    Burke, a heavy man with a lowering, bull-dog type of face, collapsed  onto his knees beside Slattin, and began softly to laugh in little  rising peals.    \"Drop that!\" snapped Smith, and grasping him by the shoulders, he sent  him spinning along the hallway, where he sank upon the bottom step of  the stairs, to sit with his outstretched fingers extended before his  face, and peering at us grotesquely through the crevices.    There were rustlings and subdued cries from the upper part of the  house. Carter came in out of the darkness, carefully stepping over the  recumbent figure; and the three of us stood there in the lighted hall  looking down at Slattin.    \"Help us to move him back,\" directed Smith, tensely; \"far enough to  close the door.\"    Between us we accomplished this, and Carter fastened the door. We were  alone with the shadow of Fu-Manchu's"]]]
