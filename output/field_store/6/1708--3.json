Boil all these together in a  kettle closely covered to prevent the flavor from evaporating. When  the vinegar thus prepared is quite cold, pour it over the salmon, and  put on the top a tablespoonful of sweet oil, which will make it keep  the longer.    Cover it closely, put it in a dry, cool place, and it will be good for  many months. This is the nicest way of preserving salmon, and is  approved by all who have tried it.      SMOKED SALMON.    Smoked salmon to be broiled should be put upon the gridiron first,  with the flesh side to the fire.    Smoked salmon is very nice when shaved like smoked beef, and served  with coffee or tea.      FRICASSEE SALMON.    This way of cooking fresh salmon is a pleasant change from the  ordinary modes of cooking it. Cut one and one-half pounds of salmon  into pieces one inch square; put the pieces in a stewpan with half a  cupful of water, a little salt, a little white pepper, one clove, one  blade of mace, three pieces of sugar, one shallot and a heaping  teaspoonful of mustard mixed smoothly with half a teacupful of  vinegar. Let this boil up once and add six tomatoes peeled and cut  into tiny pieces, a few sprigs of parsley finely minced, and one  wine-glassful of sherry. Let all simmer gently for three-quarters of  an hour. Serve very hot, and garnish with dry toast cut in triangular  pieces. This dish is good, very cold, for luncheon or breakfast.      SALMON PATTIES.    Cut cold, cooked salmon into dice. Heat about a pint of the dice in  half a pint of cream. Season to taste with cayenne pepper and salt.  Fill the shells and serve. Cold, cooked fish of any kind may be made  into patties in this way. Use any fish sauce you choose--all are  equally good.      FISH AND OYSTER PIE.    Any remains of cold fish, such as cod or haddock, 2 dozen oysters,  pepper and salt to taste, bread crumbs, sufficient for the quantity of  fish; 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful of finely  chopped parsley.    Clear the fish from the bones, and put a layer of it in a pie-dish,  which sprinkle with pepper and salt; then a layer of bread crumbs,  oysters, nutmeg and chopped parsley. Repeat this till the dish is  quite full. You may form a covering either of bread crumbs, which  should be browned, or puff-paste, which should be cut off into long  strips, and laid in cross-bars over the fish, with a line of the paste  first laid round the edge. Before putting on the top, pour in some  made melted butter, or a little thin white sauce, and the  oyster-liquor, and bake.    _Time_.--If of cooked fish, 1/4 hour; if made of fresh fish and  puff-paste, 3/4 hour.      STEAMED FISH.    Secure the tail of the fish in its mouth, the body in a circle; pour  over it half a pint of vinegar, seasoned with pepper and salt; let it  stand an hour in a cool place; pour off the vinegar, and put it in a  steamer over boiling water, and steam twenty minutes, or longer for  large fish. When the meat easily separates from the bone it is done.  Drain well and serve on a very clean white napkin, neatly folded and  placed on the platter; decorate the napkin around the fish with sprigs  of curled parsley, or with fanciful beet cuttings, or alternately with  both.      TO BROIL A SHAD.    Split and wash the shad and afterwards dry it in a cloth. Season it  with salt and pepper. Have ready a bed of clear, bright coals. Grease  your gridiron well, and as soon as it is hot, lay the shad upon it,  the flesh side down; cover with a dripping-pan and broil it for about  a quarter of an hour, or more, according to the thickness. Butter it  well and send it to the table. Covering it while broiling gives it a  more delicious flavor.      BAKED SHAD.    Many people are of the opinion that the very best method of cooking a  shad is to bake it. Stuff it with bread crumbs, salt, pepper, butter  and parsley, and mix this up with the beaten yolk of egg; fill the  fish with it, and sew it up or fasten a string around it. Pour over it  a little water and some butter, and bake as you would a fowl. A shad  will require from an hour to an hour and a quarter to bake. Garnish  with slices of lemon, water cress, etc.    _Dressing for Baked Shad._--Boil up the gravy in which the shad was  baked, put in a large tablespoonful of catsup, a tablespoonful of  brown flour which has been wet with cold water, the juice of a lemon,  and a glass of sherry or Madeira wine. Serve in a sauce boat.      TO COOK A SHAD ROE.    Drop into boiling water and cook gently for twenty minutes; then take  from the fire and drain. Butter a tin plate and lay the drained roe  upon it. Dredge well with salt and pepper and spread soft butter over  it; then dredge thickly with flour. Cook in the oven for half an hour,  basting frequently with salt, pepper, flour, butter and water.      TO COOK SHAD ROE. (Another Way.)    First partly boil them in a small covered pan, take out and season  them with salt, a little pepper, dredge with flour and fry as any  fish.      BOILED BASS.    After thoroughly cleaning it place in a saucepan with enough water to  cover it; add two tablespoonfuls of salt; set the saucepan over the  fire, and when it has boiled about five minutes try to pull out one of  the fins; if it loosens easily from the body carefully take the fish  out of the water, lay it on a platter, surround it with half a dozen  hard-boiled eggs, and serve it with a sauce.      BOILED BLUEFISH.    Boiled the same as BASS.      BAKED BLUEFISH.    Baked the same as BAKED SHAD--see page 55.      FRIED EELS.    After cleaning the eels well, cut them in pieces two inches long; wash  them and wipe them dry; roll them in wheat flour or rolled cracker,  and fry, as directed for other fish, in hot lard or beef dripping,  salted. They should be browned all over and thoroughly done.    Eels are sometimes dipped in batter and then fried, or into egg and  bread crumbs. Serve with crisped parsley.      SHEEPSHEAD WITH DRAWN BUTTER.    Select a medium-sized fish, clean it thoroughly, and rub a little salt  over it; wrap it in a cloth and put it in a steamer; place this over a  pot of fast-boiling water and steam one hour; then lay it whole upon a  hot side-dish, garnish with tufts of parsley and slices of lemon, and  serve with drawn butter, prepared as follows: Take two ounces of  butter and roll it into small balls, dredge these with flour; put  one-fourth of them in a saucepan, and as they begin to melt, whisk  them; add the remainder, one at a time, until thoroughly smooth; while  stirring, add a tablespoonful of lemon juice, half a tablespoonful of  chopped parsley; pour into a hot sauce boat and serve.      BAKED WHITE FISH.    Thoroughly clean the fish; cut off the head or not, as preferred; cut  out the backbone from the head to within two inches of the tail, and  stuff with the following: Soak stale bread in water, squeeze dry; cut  in pieces a large onion, fry in butter, chop fine; add the bread, two  ounces of butter, salt, pepper and a little parsley or sage; heat  through, and when taken off the fire, add the yolks of two well-beaten  eggs; stuff the fish rather full, sew up with fine twine, and wrap  with several coils of white tape. Rub the fish over slightly with  butter; just cover the bottom of a baking pan with hot water, and  place the fish in it, standing back upward, and bent in the form of an  S. Serve with the following dressing: Reduce the yolks of two  hard-boiled eggs to a smooth paste with two tablespoonfuls good salad  oil; stir in half a teaspoon English mustard, and add pepper and  vinegar to taste.      HALIBUT BOILED.    The cut next to the tail-piece is the best to boil. Rub a little salt  over it, soak it for fifteen minutes in vinegar and cold water, then  wash it and scrape it until quite clean; tie it in a cloth and boil  slowly over a moderate fire, allowing seven minutes' boiling to each  pound of fish; when it is half-cooked, turn it over in the pot; serve  with drawn butter or egg sauce.    Boiled halibut minced with boiled potatoes and a little butter and  milk makes an excellent breakfast dish.      STEAMED HALIBUT.    Select a three-pound piece of white halibut, cover it with a cloth and  place it in a steamer; set the steamer over a pot of fast-boiling  water and steam two hours; place it on a hot dish surrounded with a  border of parsley and serve with egg sauce.      FRIED HALIBUT. No. 1.    Select choice, firm slices from this large and delicate looking fish,  and, after carefully washing and drying with a soft towel, with a  sharp knife take off the skin. Beat up two eggs and roll out some  brittle crackers upon the kneading board until they are as fine as  dust. Dip each slice into the beaten egg, then into the cracker crumbs  (after you have salted and peppered the fish), and place them in a hot  frying pan half full of boiling lard, in which a little butter has  been added to make the fish brown nicely; turn and brown both sides,  remove from frying pan and drain. Serve hot.      FRIED HALIBUT. No. 2.    First fry a few thin slices of salt pork until brown in an iron frying  pan; then take it up on a hot platter and keep it warm until the  halibut is fried. After washing and drying two pounds of sliced  halibut, sprinkle it with salt and pepper, dredge it well with flour,  put it into the hot pork drippings and fry brown on both sides; then  serve the pork with the fish.    Halibut broiled in slices is a very good way of cooking it, broiled  the same as Spanish mackerel.      BAKED HALIBUT.    Take a nice piece of halibut weighing five or six pounds and lay it in  salt water for two hours. Wipe it dry and score the outer skin. Set it  in a dripping pan in a moderately hot oven and bake an hour, basting  often with butter and water heated together in a sauce pan or tin"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13937"],[0,"The Mysterious Rider (#10)"],[1,"of deer an' elk higher up. I chased a bunch of more'n thirty, I  reckon, right out of my pasture this mornin'.\"    Blair crossed to an open shed near by and returned with half a deer  haunch, which he tied upon Wade's pack-horse.    \"My ole woman's ailin'. Do you happen to hev some terbaccer?    \"I sure do--both smokin' an' chewin', an' I can spare more chewin'. A  little goes a long ways with me.\"    \"Wal, gimme some of both, most chewin',\" replied Blair, with evident  satisfaction.    \"You acquainted with Belllounds?\" asked Wade, as he handed over the  tobacco.    \"Wal, yes, everybody knows Bill. You'd never find a whiter boss in these  hills.\"    \"Has he any family?\"    \"Now, I can't say as to thet,\" replied Blair. \"I heerd he lost a wife  years ago. Mebbe he married ag'in. But Bill's gittin' along.\"    \"Good day to you, Blair,\" said Wade, and took up his bridle.    \"Good day an' good luck. Take the right-hand trail. Better trot up a  bit, if you want to make camp before dark.\"    Wade soon entered the spruce forest. Then he came to a shallow, roaring  river. The horses drank the water, foaming white and amber around their  knees, and then with splash and thump they forded it over the slippery  rocks. As they cracked out upon the trail a covey of grouse whirred up  into the low branches of spruce-trees. They were tame.    \"That's somethin' like,\" said Wade. \"First birds I've seen this fall.  Reckon I can have stew any day.\"    He halted his horse and made a move to dismount, but with his eyes on  the grouse he hesitated. \"Tame as chickens, an' they sure are pretty.\"    Then he rode on, leading his pack-horse. The trail was not steep,  although in places it had washed out, thus hindering a steady trot. As  he progressed the forest grew thick and darker, and the fragrance of  pine and spruce filled the air. A dreamy roar of water rushing over  rocks rang in the traveler's ears. It receded at times, then grew  louder. Presently the forest shade ahead lightened and he rode out into  a wide space where green moss and flags and flowers surrounded a  wonderful spring-hole. Sunset gleams shone through the trees to color  the wide, round pool. It was shallow all along the margin, with a deep,  large green hole in the middle, where the water boiled up. Trout were  feeding on gnats and playing on the surface, and some big ones left  wakes behind them as they sped to deeper water. Wade had an appreciative  eye for all this beauty, his gaze lingering longest upon the flowers.    \"Wild woods is the place for me,\" he soliloquized, as the cool wind  fanned his cheeks and the sweet tang of evergreen tingled his nostrils.  \"But sure I'm most haunted in these lonely, silent places.\"    Bent Wade had the look of a haunted man. Perhaps the consciousness he  confessed was part of his secret.    Twilight had come when again he rode out into the open. Trapper's Lake  lay before him, a beautiful sheet of water, mirroring the black slopes  and the fringed spruces and the flat peaks. Over all its gray,  twilight-softened surface showed little swirls and boils and splashes  where the myriads of trout were rising. The trail led out over open  grassy shores, with a few pines straggling down to the lake, and clumps  of spruces raising dark blurs against the background of gleaming lake.  Wade heard a sharp crack of hoofs on rock, and he knew he had disturbed  deer at their drinking; also he heard a ring of horns on the branch of a  tree, and was sure an elk was slipping off through the woods. Across the  lake he saw a camp-fire and a pale, sharp-pointed object that was a  trapper's tent or an Indian's tepee.    Selecting a camp-site for himself, he unsaddled his horse, threw the  pack off the other, and, hobbling both animals, he turned them loose.  His roll of bedding, roped in canvas tarpaulin, he threw under a  spruce-tree. Then he opened his oxhide-covered packs and laid out  utensils and bags, little and big. All his movements were methodical,  yet swift, accurate, habitual. He was not thinking about what he was  doing. It took him some little time to find a suitable log to split for  fire-wood, and when he had started a blaze night had fallen, and the  light as it grew and brightened played fantastically upon the  isolating shadows.    Lid and pot of the little Dutch oven he threw separately upon the  sputtering fire, and while they heated he washed his hands, mixed the  biscuits, cut slices of meat off the deer haunch, and put water on to  boil. He broiled his meat on the hot, red coals, and laid it near on  clean pine chips, while he waited for bread to bake and coffee to boil.  The smell of wood-smoke and odorous steam from pots and the fragrance of  spruce mingled together, keen, sweet, appetizing. Then he ate his simple  meal hungrily, with the content of the man who had fared worse.    After he had satisfied himself he washed his utensils and stowed them  away, with the bags. Whereupon his movements acquired less dexterity and  speed. The rest hour had come. Still, like the long-experienced man in  the open, he looked around for more to do, and his gaze fell upon his  weapons, lying on his saddle. His rifle was a Henry--shiny and smooth  from long service and care. His small gun was a Colt's 45. It had been  carried in a saddle holster. Wade rubbed the rifle with his hands, and  then with a greasy rag which he took from the sheath. After that he held  the rifle to the heat of the fire. A squall of rain had overtaken him  that day, wetting his weapons. A subtle and singular difference seemed  to show in the way he took up the Colt's. His action was slow, his look  reluctant. The small gun was not merely a thing of steel and powder and  ball. He dried it and rubbed it with care, but not with love, and then  he stowed it away.    Next Wade unrolled his bed under the spruce, with one end of the  tarpaulin resting on the soft mat of needles. On top of that came the  two woolly sheepskins, which he used to lie upon, then his blankets, and  over all the other end of the tarpaulin.    This ended his tasks for the day. He lighted his pipe and composed  himself beside the camp-fire to smoke and rest awhile before going to  bed. The silence of the wilderness enfolded lake and shore; yet  presently it came to be a silence accentuated by near and distant  sounds, faint, wild, lonely--the low hum of falling water, the splash of  tiny waves on the shore, the song of insects, and the dismal hoot  of owls.    \"Bill Belllounds--an' he needs a hunter,\" soliloquized Bent Wade, with  gloomy, penetrating eyes, seeing far through the red embers. \"That will  suit me an' change my luck, likely. Livin' in the woods, away from  people--I could stick to a job like that.... But if this White Slides is  close to the old trail I'll never stay.\"    He sighed, and a darker shadow, not from flickering fire, overspread his  cadaverous face. Eighteen years ago he had driven the woman he loved  away from him, out into the world with her baby girl. Never had he  rested beside a camp-fire that that old agony did not recur! Jealous  fool! Too late he had discovered his fatal blunder; and then had begun a  search over Colorado, ending not a hundred miles across the wild  mountains from where he brooded that lonely hour--a search ended by news  of the massacre of a wagon-train by Indians.    That was Bent Wade's secret.    And no earthly sufferings could have been crueler than his agony and  remorse, as through the long years he wandered on and on. The very good  that he tried to do seemed to foment evil. The wisdom that grew out of  his suffering opened pitfalls for his wandering feet. The wildness of  men and the passion of women somehow waited with incredible fatality for  that hour when chance led him into their lives. He had toiled, he had  given, he had fought, he had sacrificed, he had killed, he had endured  for the human nature which in his savage youth he had betrayed. Yet out  of his supreme and endless striving to undo, to make reparation, to give  his life, to find God, had come, it seemed to Wade in his abasement,  only a driving torment.    But though his thought and emotion fluctuated, varying, wandering, his  memory held a fixed and changeless picture of a woman, fair and sweet,  with eyes of nameless blue, and face as white as a flower.    \"Baby would have been--let's see--'most nineteen years old now--if she'd  lived,\" he said. \"A big girl, I reckon, like her mother.... Strange how,  as I grow older, I remember better!\"    The night wind moaned through the spruces; dark clouds scudded across  the sky, blotting out the bright stars; a steady, low roar of water came  from the outlet of the lake. The camp-fire flickered and burned out, so  that no sparks blew into the blackness, and the red embers glowed and  paled and crackled. Wade at length got up and made ready for bed. He  threw back tarpaulin and blankets, and laid his rifle alongside where he  could cover it. His coat served for a pillow and he put the Colt's gun  under that; then pulling off his boots, he slipped into bed, dressed as  he was, and, like all men in the open, at once fell asleep.    For Wade, and for countless men like him, who for many years had roamed  the West, this sleeping alone in wild places held both charm and peril.  But the fascination of it was only a vague realization, and the danger  was laughed at.    Over Bent Wade's quiet form the shadows played, the spruce boughs waved,  the piny needles rustled down, the wind moaned louder as the night  advanced. By and by the horses rested from their grazing; the insects  ceased to hum; and the continuous roar of water dominated the solitude.  If wild animals passed Wade's camp they gave it a wide berth.           *       *       *       *       *    Sunrise found Wade on the trail, climbing high up above the lake, making  for the pass over the range. He walked, leading his horses up a zigzag  trail that bore the tracks"]]]
