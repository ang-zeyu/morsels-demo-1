Then too for this kind of young man the  life of a criminal has a strong appeal. Life without opportunity and  without a gambler's chance to win a considerable prize is not attractive  to anyone. The conventional man who devotes his life to business or to a  profession always has before him the prizes of success--to some honor  and glory, and to most of them wealth. Imagine the number of lawyers,  doctors and business men who could stick to a narrow path if they knew  that life offered no opportunity but drudgery and poverty! Nearly all  of these look forward to the prizes of success. Most of them expect  success and many get it. For the man that I have described, a life of  toil offers no chance of success. His capacity, education and  environment deny him the gambler's chance of a prize. As an honest man,  he may raise a family, always be in debt, live a life of poverty and  hardship and see nothing ahead but drudgery and defeat. This is why so  many mediocre men are found in the mountains and oil fields prospecting  for hidden wealth. With the chance of a fortune just before them, and no  other opportunity to win, they spend their lives without a family or  home, urged on by the hope of luck.    The man grown from boyhood into ways of vice and crime sees this hope  and this hope only to make a strike. He has no strong convictions and no  well-settled habits to hold him back. The fear of the law only means  greater caution, and after all he has nothing to lose. In his world  arrest and conviction do not mean loss of caste; they mean only bad  luck. With large numbers of men crime becomes a trade. It grows to be a  business as naturally as any other calling comes to be a trade.    There are other criminals who do not come from the class I have  described, but the habitual visitor to criminal courts knows that they  are very few. Of the others, some are born of parents who could care  for them and have done their best and yet, in spite of this, they have  repeatedly been entangled in the law; these are often the only ones of a  large family who have not lived according to the rules of the game. They  are different from the other members of the family. For the most part  they have some specific congenital defect, or an unstable system that  prevents the correct registration of the experiences that produce safe  habits, or makes them unable to withstand temptation or suggestion.    Everyone knows how easy it is, especially for children, to react to  suggestion. The whole life of a child is a response to suggestion. This  is about all there is to education. Even older men constantly and  readily yield to suggestion. The results gained by quack doctors,  lightning-rod agents, promoters and dealers in oil stocks, mining stocks  and an endless number of other stocks, show that the right kind of  suggestion is bound to produce results. The dressing of the windows of  department stores and the writing of catchy advertisements are a  constant recognition of the power of suggestion. So well known is this  weakness of human character that schools of salesmanship are regularly  organized and promoted to teach the art of getting victims to part with  money for things they do not want or need.    Every right-feeling person does everything in his power to educate the  child. He is ever watchful through the child's youth and early manhood  to equip him with the capacity to make a living. He seeks to build up  around him and within him the strongest kind of habits and beliefs. He  carefully teaches the child that the only way to live is to observe all  the rules laid down by experience and custom, so that he may not react  to the temptations that life holds out at every step. Every wise person  feels almost certain that if his children are reared without education,  without discipline, without training or opportunities, they will almost  inevitably swell the ranks of the criminal classes. And it is especially  certain that if one of his children is defective or has an unstable  nervous system, such a child should never be left without protection and  care.    There are professional criminals of a different grade, like the forger  and the confidence man. Both of these have generally had some education  and a fair degree of intelligence, and have had some advantages in life.  The forger, as a rule, is a bookkeeper or an accountant who grows expert  with the pen. He works for a small salary and sees nothing better. He  grows familiar with signatures. Sometimes he is a clerk in a bank and  has the opportunity to study signatures; he begins to imitate them,  often with no thought of forging paper. He does it because it is an art  and probably the only thing he can do well. Perhaps some hard luck or an  unfortunate venture on the Board of Trade, or in a faro bank, makes him  write a check or note. He easily convinces himself that he is not  getting the salary he earns and that less worthy men prosper while he is  poor. Then too his business calls for better clothes and better  surroundings than those of the workingman, and gives him many glimpses  of easy lives. For a time he may escape. If the amount is not too large  it is often passed by without an effort to detect. Sometimes it escapes  notice altogether. Some business men write so many checks that they take  no pains at the end of the month to figure up their account and examine  every check, and never notice it unless the balance given by the bank is  so far out of the way that it attracts attention. After a forger grows  to be an expert, he can move from town to town. If he is taken and put  in prison and finally released, he is hard to cure. Forgery is too easy  and he knows of no other trade so good. A large percentage of these men  never would have forged, had their wages been higher. Many others are  the victims of the get-rich-quick disease; they haunt the gambling  houses, brokers' offices and the like. Often when they begin they expect  to make the check good; generally, they would have made good if the  right card had only turned up in the faro bank, or the right quotation  on the stock exchange.    There is another class of forgers, generally bankers, who speculate with  trust funds. To cover up the shortage they sign notes expecting that  they will never be presented and will deceive no one but the bank  examiner. If luck goes against them too long, the bank fails and the  forgery is discovered. These are really not forgers, as they never  intend to get money on the note. It is only a part of a means to cover  up the use of trust funds. Of course, these men are never professional  forgers, and are much more apt to die from suicide or a broken heart  than to repeat.    But with few exceptions, the criminal comes from the walks of the poor  and has no education or next to none. For this society is much to blame.  Sometimes he is obliged to go to work too soon, but often he cannot  learn at school. This is not entirely the fault of the boy's heredity;  it is largely the fault of the school. A certain course of study has  been laid out. With only slight changes this course has come down from  the past and is fixed and formal. Much of it might be of value to a  professional man, but most of it is of no value to the man in other  walks of life. Because a boy cannot learn arithmetic, grammar or  geography, or not even learn to read and write, it does not follow that  he cannot learn at all. He may possibly have marked mechanical ability;  he may have more than the ordinary powers of adaptation to many kinds of  work. These he could be taught to do and often to do well. Under proper  instruction he might become greatly interested in some kind of work, and  in the study to prepare him for the work. Then too it is more or less  misleading to say that an uneducated man commits crime because he is  uneducated. Often his lack of education as well as his crime comes from  poverty. Crime and poverty may come from something else. All come  because he had a poor make-up or an insufficient chance.    After all, the great majority of men must do some kind of manual labor.  Until the time shall come when this kind of work is as easy and as well  paid as other employment, no one will do manual labor if he can do any  other kind. Perhaps the time may come when the hardest and most  disagreeable work will be the best paid. There are too many unskilled  workers in proportion to the population to make this seem very near. In  the meantime--and that is doubtless a long time--some one must do this  work. Much of it is done under supervision and requires no great skill  and need not be very disagreeable or hard. In a complex civilization  there is room for everyone to contribute to the whole. If our schools  are some day what they should be, a large part of their time, in some  cases all of it, will be devoted to manual training and will be given to  producing skilled workmen. This sort of school work can be made  attractive to thousands of boys who can do nothing else. And if easier  conditions of life under fairer social surroundings could be added to  this kind of education, most boys who now drift into crime would  doubtless find the conventional life more profitable and attractive.          VIII    THE FEMALE CRIMINAL      Women furnish only one-fifth to one-tenth of the population of penal  institutions. Probably the percentage would be still lower if among  these were not a number of rather common convictions for acts which are  peculiar to women, like abortion, infanticide, child abandonment and the  like. As to the other crimes, few women are burglars or robbers, or  guilty of other crimes of violence, except murder. Women steal and  poison and blackmail and extort money and lie and slander and gossip,  and probably cause as much unhappiness as men; but their crimes, like  their lives, are not on so large or adventurous a scale.

Bards and encomiasts by  thousands decked with ear-rings set with brilliant gems, and gifted with  melodious voice, used to pay him homage morning and evening. Alas, that  Yudhishthira, who was daily waited upon by a thousand sages of ascetic  merit, versed in the _Vedas_ and having every desire gratified, as his  courtiers,--that Yudhishthira who maintained eighty-eight thousands of  domestic _Snatakas_ with thirty maid-servants assigned unto each, as  also ten thousand _yatis_ not accepting anything in gift and with vital  seed drawn up,--alas, even that mighty king now liveth in such guise.  That Yudhishthira who is without malice, who is full of kindness, and  who giveth every creature his due, who hath all these excellent  attributes, alas--even he now liveth in such guise. Possessed of  firmness and unbaffled prowess, with heart disposed to give every  creature his due, king Yudhishthira, moved by compassion, constantly  maintained in his kingdom the blind, the old, the helpless, the  parentless and all others in his dominions in such distress. Alas, that  Yudhishthira becoming a dependant and a servant of Matsya, a caster of  dice in his court, now calls himself Kanka. He unto whom while residing  at Indraprastha, all the rulers of earth used to pay timely  tribute,--alas, even he now begs for subsistence at another's hands. He  to whom the kings of the earth were in subjection,--alas, even that king  having lost his liberty, liveth in subjection to others. Having dazzled  the entire earth like the sun by his energy, that Yudhishthira, alas, is  now a courtier of king Virata. O Pandu's son, that Pandava who was  respectfully waited upon in court by kings and sages, behold him now  waiting upon another. Alas, beholding Yudhishthira a courtier sitting  beside another and breathing adulatory speeches to the other, who can  help being afflicted with grief? And beholding the highly wise and  virtuous Yudhishthira, undeserving as he is of serving others, actually  serving another for sustenance, who can help being afflicted with grief?  And, O hero, that Bharata who was worshipped in court by the entire  earth, do thou now behold him worshipping another. Why then, O Bharata,  dost thou not regard me as one afflicted with diverse miseries, like one  forlorn and immersed in a sea of sorrow?'\"      SECTION XIX    \"Draupadi said, 'This O Bharata, that I am going to tell thee is another  great grief of mine. Thou shouldst not blame me, for I tell thee this  from sadness of heart. Who is there whose grief is not enhanced at sight  of thee, O bull of the Bharata race, engaged in the ignoble office of a  cook, so entirely beneath thee and calling thyself as one _of Vallava_  caste? What can be sadder than this, that people should know thee as  Virata's cook, Vallava by name, and therefore one that is sunk in  servitude? Alas, when thy work of the kitchen is over, thou humbly  sittest beside Virata, calling thyself as Vallava the cook, then  despondency seizeth my heart. When the king of kings in joy maketh thee  fight with elephants, and the women of the inner apartments (of the  palace) laugh all the while, then I am sorely distressed. When thou  fightest in the inner apartments with lions, tigers, and buffaloes, the  princess Kaikeyi looking on, then I almost swoon away. And when Kaikeyi  and those maidservants, leaving their seats, come to assist me and find  that instead of suffering any injury in limbs mine is only a swoon, the  princess speaks unto her women, saying, 'Surely, it is from affection  and the duty begot of intercourse that this lady of sweet smiles  grieveth for the exceedingly powerful cook when he fights with the  beasts. Sairindhri is possessed of great beauty and Vallava also is  eminently handsome. The heart of woman is hard to know, and they, I  fancy, are deserving of each other. It is, therefore, likely that the  Sairindhri invariably weepeth (at such times) on account of her  connection with her lover. And then, they both have entered this royal  family at the same time. And speaking such words she always upbraideth  me. And beholding me wroth at this, she suspects me to be attached to  thee.' When she speaketh thus, great is the grief that I feel. Indeed,  on beholding thee, O Bhima of terrible prowess, afflicted with such  calamity, sunk as I already am in grief on account of Yudhishthira, I do  not desire to live. That youth who on a single car had vanquished all  celestials and men, is now, alas, the dancing master of king Virata's  daughter. That Pritha's son of immeasurable soul, who had gratified Agni  in the forest of Khandava, is now living in the inner apartments (of a  palace) like fire hid in a well. Alas, the bull among men, Dhananjaya,  who was ever the terror of foes, is now living in a guise that is  despaired by all. Alas, he whose mace-like arms have been cicatrized in  consequence of the strokes of his bow-string, alas that Dhananjaya is  passing the days in grief covering his wrists with bracelets of conchs.  Alas, that Dhananjaya the twang of whose bow-string and the sound of  whose leathern fences made every foe tremble, now entertains only  gladdened women with his songs. Oh, that Dhananjaya whose head was  formerly decked with a diadem of solar splendour, is now wearing braids  ending in unsightly curls. O Bhima, beholding that terrible bowman,  Arjuna, now wearing braids and in the midst of women, my heart is  stricken with woe. That high-souled hero who is master of all the  celestial weapons, and who is the repository of all the sciences, now  weareth ear-rings (like one of the fair sex). That youth whom kings of  incomparable prowess could not overpower in fight, even as the waters of  the mighty ocean cannot overleap the continents, is now the  dancing-master of king Virata's daughters and waits upon them in  disguise. O Bhima, that Arjuna the clatter of whose car-wheels caused  the entire earth with her mountains and forests, her mobile and immobile  things to tremble, and whose birth dispelled all the sorrows of Kunti,  that exalted hero, that younger brother of thine, O Bhimasena, now  maketh me weep for him. Beholding him coming towards me, decked in  golden ear-rings and other ornaments, and wearing on the wrists  bracelets of conchs, my heart is afflicted with despondency. And  Dhananjaya who hath not a bowman equal unto him on earth in prowess, now  passeth his days in singing, surrounded by women. Beholding that son of  Pritha who in virtue, heroism and truth, was the most admired in the  world, now living in the guise of a woman, my heart is afflicted with  sorrow. When I behold, the godlike Partha in the music-hall like an  elephant with rent temples surrounded by she-elephants in the midst of  females, waiting before Virata the king of the Matsyas, then I lose all  sense of directions. Surely, my mother-in-law doth not know Dhananjaya  to be afflicted with such extreme distress. Nor doth she know that  descendant of the Kuru race, Ajatasatru, addicted to disastrous dice, to  be sunk in misery. O Bharata, beholding the youngest of you all,  Sahadeva, superintending the kine, in the guise of a cowherd, I grow  pale. Always thinking of Sahadeva's plight, I cannot, O Bhimasena,  obtain sleep,--what to speak you of the rest? I do not know, O  mighty-armed one, what sin Sahadeva may have committed for which that  hero of unbaffled prowess suffereth such misery. O foremost of the  Bharatas, beholding that beloved brother of thine, that bull among men,  employed by Matsya in looking after his kine, I am filled with woe.  Seeing that hero of proud disposition gratifying Virata, by living at  the head of his cowherds, attired in robes dyed in red, I am attacked  with fever. My mother-in-law always applauds the heroic Sahadeva as one  possessed of nobility, excellent behaviour, and rectitude of conduct.  Ardently attached to her sons, the weeping Kunti stood, embracing  Sahadeva while he was about to set out (with us) for the great forest.  And she addressed me saying, \"Sahadeva is bashful and sweet-speeched,  and virtuous. He is also my favourite child. Therefore, O Yajnaseni,  tend him in the forest day and night. Delicate and brave, devoted to the  king, and always worshipping his elder brother, do thou, O Panchali,  feed him thyself.\" O Pandava, beholding that foremost of warriors,  Sahadeva, engaged in tending kine, and sleeping at night on calf-skins,  how can I bear to live? He again who is crowned with the three  attributes of beauty, arms, and intelligence, is now the superintendent  of Virata's steeds. Behold the change brought on by time. Granthika  (Nakula), at sight of whom hostile hosts fled from the field of battle,  now traineth horses in the presence of the king, driving them with the  speed. Alas, I now see that handsome youth wait upon the gorgeously  decked and excellent Virata, the king of the Matsyas, and display horses  before him. O son of Pritha, afflicted as I am with all these hundred  kinds of misery on account of Yudhishthira, why dost thou, O chastiser  of foes, yet deem me happy? Listen now to me, O son of Kunti, as I tell  thee of other woes far surpassing these. What can be sadder to me than  miseries so various as these should emaciate me while ye are alive.'\"      SECTION XX    \"Draupadi said, 'Alas, on account of that desperate gambler, I am now  under Sudeshna's command, living in the palace in the guise of a  _Sairindhri_. And, O chastiser of foes, behold the plight of poignant  woe which I, a princess, am now in. I am living in expectation of the  close of this stated period.[14] The extreme of misery, therefore, is  mine. Success of purpose, victory, and defeat, as regards mortals, are  transitory. It is in this belief that I am living in expectation of the  return of prosperity to my husbands. Prosperity and adversity revolve  like a wheel. It"]]]
