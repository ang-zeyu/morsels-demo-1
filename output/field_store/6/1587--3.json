It is therefore obvious that no one can come to such a decision except  from the most weighty reasons, more especially under the existing  conditions which have created national armies. Absolute clearness of  vision is needed to decide how and when such a resolution can be taken,  and what political aims justify the use of armed force.    This question therefore needs careful consideration, and a satisfactory  answer can only be derived from an examination of the essential duty of  the State.    If this duty consists in giving scope to the highest intellectual and  moral development of the citizens, and in co-operating in the moral  education of the human race, then the State's own acts must necessarily  conform to the moral laws. But the acts of the State cannot be judged by  the standard of individual morality. If the State wished to conform to  this standard it would often find itself at variance with its own  particular duties. The morality of the State must be developed out of  its own peculiar essence, just as individual morality is rooted in the  personality of the man and his duties towards society. The morality of  the State must be judged by the nature and _raison d'etre_ of the State,  and not of the individual citizen. But the end-all and be-all of a State  is power, and \"he who is not man enough to look this truth in the face  should not meddle in politics.\" [F]    [Footnote F: Treitschke, \"Politik,\" i., p 3, and ii., p 28.]    Machiavelli was the first to declare that the keynote of every policy  was the advancement of power. This term, however, has acquired, since  the German Reformation, a meaning other than that of the shrewd  Florentine. To him power was desirable in itself; for us \"the State is  not physical power as an end in itself, it is power to protect and  promote the higher interests\"; \"power must justify itself by being  applied for the greatest good of mankind.\" [G]    [Footnote G: Treitschke, \"Politik,\" i., p 3, and ii., p 28.]    The criterion of the personal morality of the individual \"rests in the  last resort on the question whether he has recognized and developed his  own nature to the highest attainable degree of perfection.\" [H] If the  same standard is applied to the State, then \"its highest moral duty is  to increase its power. The individual must sacrifice himself for the  higher community of which he is a member; but the State is itself the  highest conception in the wider community of man, and therefore the duty  of self-annihilation does not enter into the case. The Christian duty of  sacrifice for something higher does not exist for the State, for there  is nothing higher than it in the world's history; consequently it cannot  sacrifice itself to something higher. When a State sees its downfall  staring it in the face, we applaud if it succumbs sword in hand. A  sacrifice made to an alien nation not only is immoral, but contradicts  the idea of self-preservation, which is the highest ideal of a  State.\" [I]    [Footnote H: _Ibid._]    [Footnote I: _Ibid_., i., p 3.]    I have thought it impossible to explain the foundations of political  morality better than in the words of our great national historian. But  we can reach the same conclusions by another road. The individual is  responsible only for himself. If, either from weakness or from moral  reasons, he neglects his own advantage, he only injures himself, the  consequences of his actions recoil only on him. The situation is quite  different in the case of a State. It represents the ramifying and often  conflicting interests of a community. Should it from any reason neglect  the interests, it not only to some extent prejudices itself as a legal  personality, but it injures also the body of private interests  which it represents. This incalculably far-reaching detriment affects  not merely one individual responsible merely to himself, but a mass of  individuals and the community. Accordingly it is a moral duty of the  State to remain loyal to its own peculiar function as guardian and  promoter of all higher interests. This duty it cannot fulfil unless it  possesses the needful power.    The increase of this power is thus from this standpoint also the first  and foremost duty of the State. This aspect of the question supplies a  fair standard by which the morality of the actions of the State can be  estimated. The crucial question is, How far has the State performed this  duty, and thus served the interests of the community? And this not  merely in the material sense, but in the higher meaning that material  interests are justifiable only so far as they promote the power of the  State, and thus indirectly its higher aims.    It is obvious, in view of the complexity of social conditions, that  numerous private interests must be sacrificed to the interest of the  community, and, from the limitations of human discernment, it is only  natural that the view taken of interests of the community may be  erroneous. Nevertheless the advancement of the power of the State must  be first and foremost the object that guides the statesman's policy.  \"Among all political sins, the sin of feebleness is the most  contemptible; it is the political sin against the Holy Ghost.\" [J] This  argument of political morality is open to the objection that it leads  logically to the Jesuitic principle, that the end justifies the means;  that, according to it, to increase the power of the State all measures  are permissible.    [Footnote J: Treitschke, \"Politik,\" i., p 3.]    A most difficult problem is raised by the question how far, for  political objects moral in themselves, means may be employed which must  be regarded as reprehensible in the life of the individual. So far as I  know, no satisfactory solution has yet been obtained, and I do not feel  bound to attempt one at this point. War, with which I am dealing at  present, is no reprehensible means in itself, but it may become so if it  pursues unmoral or frivolous aims, which bear no comparison with the  seriousness of warlike measures. I must deviate here a little from my  main theme, and discuss shortly some points which touch the question of  political morality.    The gulf between political and individual morality is not so wide as is  generally assumed. The power of the State does not rest exclusively on  the factors that make up material power--territory, population, wealth,  and a large army and navy: it rests to a high degree on moral elements,  which are reciprocally related to the material. The energy with which a  State promotes its own interests and represents the rights of its  citizens in foreign States, the determination which it displays to  support them on occasion by force of arms, constitute a real factor of  strength, as compared with all such countries as cannot bring themselves  to let things come to a crisis in a like case. Similarly a reliable and  honourable policy forms an element of strength in dealings with allies  as well as with foes. A statesman is thus under no obligation to deceive  deliberately. He can from the political standpoint avoid all  negotiations which compromise his personal integrity, and he will  thereby serve the reputation and power of his State no less than when he  holds aloof from political menaces, to which no acts correspond, and  renounces all political formulas and phrases.    In antiquity the murder of a tyrant was thought a moral action, and the  Jesuits have tried to justify regicide.[K] At the present day political  murder is universally condemned from the standpoint of political  morality. The same holds good of preconcerted political deception. A  State which employed deceitful methods would soon sink into disrepute.  The man who pursues moral ends with unmoral means is involved in a  contradiction of motives, and nullifies the object at which he aims,  since he denies it by his actions. It is not, of course, necessary that  a man communicate all his intentions and ultimate objects to an  opponent; the latter can be left to form his own opinion on this point.  But it is not necessary to lie deliberately or to practise crafty  deceptions. A fine frankness has everywhere been the characteristic of  great statesmen. Subterfuges and duplicity mark the petty spirit of  diplomacy.    [Footnote K: Mariana, \"De rege et regis institutione.\" Toledo, 1598.]    Finally, the relations between two States must often be termed a latent  war, which is provisionally being waged in peaceful rivalry. Such a  position justifies the employment of hostile methods, cunning, and  deception, just as war itself does, since in such a case both parties  are determined to employ them. I believe after all that a conflict  between personal and political morality may be avoided by wise and  prudent diplomacy, if there is no concealment of the desired end, and it  is recognized that the means employed must correspond to the ultimately  moral nature of that end.    Recognized rights are, of course, often violated by political action.  But these, as we have already shown, are never absolute rights; they are  of human origin, and therefore imperfect and variable. There are  conditions under which they do not correspond to the actual truth of  things; in this case the _summum jus summa injuria_ holds good, and the  infringement of the right appears morally justified. York's decision to  conclude the convention of Tauroggen was indisputably a violation of  right, but it was a moral act, for the Franco-Prussian alliance was made  under compulsion, and was antagonistic to all the vital interests of the  Prussian State; it was essentially untrue and immoral. Now it is always  justifiable to terminate an immoral situation.    As regards the employment of war as a political means, our argument  shows that it becomes the duty of a State to make use of the _ultima  ratio_ not only when it is attacked, but when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11365"],[0,"The Fern Lover's Companion (#10)"],[1,"evergreen;          Fronds small, narrow, glandular, rock species                                                     Fragrant Fern          Fronds large, two or more feet high;              Lower pinnae short, broadly triangular                                                Crested Shield Fern              Lower pinnae longer;                  Sori close to the margin....

Although the genus _Polystichum_ represents  the true shield ferns, the wood ferns are also thus designated, as their  indusia have nearly the shape of small, roundish shields. The old generic  name for them all was _Aspidium_ (meaning shield), first published in 1800.  For a long time its chief rival was _Nephrodium_ (kidney-like), 1803. Many  modern botanists have preferred the earlier name _Dryopteris_ (1763),  meaning oak fern, alluding, perhaps, to its forest-loving habits.  THELYPTERIS, still earlier (1762), may supersede the others.    [Illustration: Marginal Shield Fern. Aspidium marginale (From Woolson's  \"Ferns,\" Doubleday, Page & Co.)]    [Illustration: Sori of Marginal Shield Fern]    (1) MARGINAL SHIELD FERN, EVERGREEN WOOD FERN    _Aspidium marginale_. THELYPTERIS MARGINALIS  _Dryopteris marginalis. Nephrodium marginale_    Fronds from a few inches to three feet long, ovate-oblong, somewhat  leathery, smooth, twice pinnate. Pinnae lanceolate, acuminate, broadest just  above the base. Pinnules oblong, often slightly falcate, entire or toothed.  Fruit-dots large, round, close to the margin. Rocky hillsides in rich  woods, rather common throughout our area. The heavy rootstock rises  slightly above the ground and is clothed at the crown with shaggy, brown  scales. Its rising caudex, often creeping for several inches over bare  rocks, suggests the habit of a tree fern. In early spring it sends up a  graceful circle of large, handsome, bluish-green blades. The stipes are  short and densely chaffy. No other wood fern endures the winter so well.  The fronds burdened with snow lop over among the withered leaves and  continue green until the new ones shoot up in the spring. It is the most  valuable of all the wood ferns for cultivation.    (2) THE MALE FERN    _Aspidium Filix-mas_. THELYPTERIS FILIX-MAS  _Dryopteris Filix-mas. Nephrodium Filix-mas_    Fronds lanceolate, pinnate, one to three feet high growing in a crown from  a shaggy rootstock. Pinnae lanceolate, tapering from base to apex. Pinnules  oblong, obtuse, serrate at the apex, obscurely so at the sides, the basal  incisely lobed, distant, the upper confluent. Fruit-dots large, nearer the  mid vein than the margin, mostly on the lower half of each fertile segment.    The male fern resembles the marginal shield fern in outline, but the fronds  are thinner, are not evergreen, and the sori are near the midvein. Its use  in medicine is of long standing. Its rootstock produces the well-known  _filix-mas_ of the pharmacist. This has tonic and astringent properties,  but is mainly prescribed as a vermifuge, which is one of the names given to  it. In Europe it is regarded as the typical fern, being oftener mentioned  and figured than any other. In rocky woods, Canada, Northfield, Vt., and  northwest to the great lakes, also in many parts of the world.

Nephrodium Goldianum_    Fronds two to four feet high and often one foot broad, pinnate, broadly  ovate, especially the sterile ones. Pinnae deeply pinnatifid, broadest  in the middle. The divisions (eighteen or twenty pairs) oblong-linear,  slightly toothed. Fruit-dots very near the midvein. Indusium large,  orbicular, with a deep, narrow sinus. Scales dark brown to nearly black  with a peculiar silky lustre.    A magnificent species, the tallest and largest of the wood ferns. It  delights in rich woodlands where there is limestone. Its range is from  Canada to Kentucky. While not common, there are numerous colonies in New  England. It is reported from Fairfield, Me., Spencer and Mt. Toby, Mass.,  and frequently west of the Connecticut River. We have often admired a large  and beautiful colony of it on the west side of Willoughby Mountain in  Vermont. It is easily cultivated and adds grace and dignity to a fern  garden.    [Illustration: Goldie's Shield Fern. _Aspidium Goldianum_ (Vermont, 1874.  C.G. Pringle) (Herbarium of G.E. Davenport)]    [Illustration: Goldie's Fern (From Woolson's \"Ferns,\" Doubleday, Page &  Co.)]    (4) THE CRESTED FERN    _Aspidium cristatum_. THELYPTERIS CRISTATA    _Dryopteris cristata. Nephrodium cristatum_    Fronds one to two feet long, linear-oblong or lanceolate, pinnate, acute.  Pinnae two to three inches long, broadest at the base, triangular-oblong,  or the lowest triangular. Divisions oblong, obtuse, finely serrate or  cut-toothed, those nearest the rachis sometimes separate. Fruit-dots large,  round, half way between the midvein and the margin. Indusium smooth, naked,  with a shallow sinus.    The short sterile fronds, though spreading out gracefully, are conspicuous  only in winter; while the fertile fronds, tall, narrow and erect, are found  only in summer.    It is one of our handsomest evergreen ferns and even the large sori, with  their dark spore cases and white indusia, are very attractive. The fertile  pinnae have a way of turning their faces upward toward the apex of the frond  for more light. In moist land, Canada to Kentucky.    Var. _Clintonianum_. Clinton's Wood Fern. Resembles the type, but is in  every way larger. Divisions eight to sixteen pairs. Fruit-dots near the  midvein, the sides of the sinus often overlapping. South central Maine to  New York and westward. \"Rare in New England attaining its best development  in western sections.\" (Dodge.) Mt. Toby, Mass., Hanover, N.H. July. Fine  for cultivation.    [Illustration: Crested Shield Fern. _Aspidium cristatum_ (Reading, Mass.,  Kingman)]    [Illustration: The Crested Shield Fern. _Aspidium cristatum_]    [Illustration: Clinton's Wood Fern. _Aspidium cristatum_, var.  _Clintonianum_ (Gray Herbarium)]    CRESTED MARGINAL FERN    _Aspidium cristatum X marginale_      Both the crested fern and Clinton's fern appear to hybridize with the  marginal shield fern with the result that the upper part of the frond is  like _marginale_ and the lower like _cristatum_, including the veining and  texture.    This form was discovered by Raynal Dodge, verified by Margaret Slosson and  described by Geo. E. Davenport, who had a small colony under cultivation in  his fern garden at Medford, Mass., and to him the writer and other friends  are indebted for specimens.    Found occasionally throughout New England and New Jersey. Other supposed  hybrids have been found between the marginal shield and the spinulose fern  and its variety _intermedium_, and with Goldie's fern; also between the  crested fern, including Clinton's variety and each of the others mentioned;  and, in fact, between almost all pairs of species of the wood ferns,  although we do not think they have been positively verified. Still other  species of ferns are known to hybridize more or less, as we saw in the case  of Scott's spleenwort.    [Illustration: Crested Marginal Fern. A Hybrid. _Aspidium Cristatum X  marginale_ (Fernery of Geo. E. Davenport)]    [Illustration: _Aspidium cristatum X marginale_ One of the very best for  cultivation]    (5) BOOTT'S SHIELD FERN    _Aspidium Boottii_. THELYPTERIS BOOTTII    _Dryopteris Boottii. Nephrodium Boottii_    Fronds one to three feet high, oblong-lanceolate, bipinnate, the upper  pinnae lanceolate, the lower triangular with spinulose teeth. Sori in rows  each side of the midvein, one to each tooth and often scattering on the  lower pinules. Indusium large, minutely glandular, variable.    This fern has been thought to be a hybrid between the crested and spinulose  ferns, but is now regarded as distinct. Like the crested fern its fertile  fronds wither in autumn, while its sterile blades remain green throughout  the winter. It differs from it, however, by being twice pinnate below, and  from the typical spinulose fern by its glandular indusium; but from the  intermediate variety it is more difficult to separate it, as that also has  indusiate glands. The collector needs to study authentic specimens and  have in mind the type, with its rather long, narrow blade as an aid to the  verbal description, and even then he will often find it an interesting  puzzle. Shaded swamps throughout our area.    [Illustration: _Aspidium Boottii_]    (6) SPINULOSE SHIELD FERN    _Aspidium spinulosum. THELYPTERIS SPINULOSA    Dryopteris spinulosa. Nephrodium spinulosum_    Stipes with a few pale brown deciduous scales. Fronds one to two and  one-half feet long, ovate-lanceolate, twice pinnate. Pinnae oblique to  the rachis, the lower ones broadly triangular, the upper ones elongated."]]]
