And now we perceived that the valley was filled with them,  all, that is, save a great circular patch where nothing appeared to be  growing; though we were not yet at a sufficient height to ascertain the  reason of this.    Presently, we came to a place where the rock was split by a great fissure  running up to the top, and showing many ledges and convenient shelves  upon which we might obtain hold and footing. And so we set-to about  climbing, helping one another so far as we had ability, until, in about  the space of some ten minutes, we reached the top, and from thence had a  very fine view. We perceived now that there was a beach upon that side of  the island which was opposed to the weed; though, unlike that upon which  we had landed, it was greatly choked with weed which had drifted ashore.  After that, I gave notice to see what space of water lay between the  island and the edge of the great weed-continent, and guessed it to be no  more than maybe some ninety yards, at which I fell to wishing that it had  been greater, for I was grown much in awe of the weed and the strange  things which I conceived it to contain.    Abruptly, the bo'sun clapped me upon the shoulder, and pointed to some  object that lay out in the weed at a distance of not much less than the  half of a mile from where we stood. Now, at first, I could not conceive  what manner of thing it was at which I stared, until the bo'sun,  remarking my bewilderment, informed me that it was a vessel all covered  in, no doubt as a protection against the devil-fish and other strange  creatures in the weed. And now I began to trace the hull of her amid all  that hideous growth; but of her masts, I could discern nothing; and I  doubted not but that they had been carried away by some storm ere she was  caught by the weed; and then the thought came to me of the end of those  who had built up that protection against the horrors which the weed-world  held hidden amid its slime.    Presently, I turned my gaze once more upon the island, which was very  plain to see from where we stood. I conceived, now that I could see so  much of it, that its length would be near to half a mile, though its  breadth was something under four hundred yards; thus it was very long in  proportion to its width. In the middle part it had less breadth than at  the ends, being perhaps three hundred yards at its narrowest, and a  hundred yards wider at its broadest.    Upon both sides of the island, as I have made already a mention, there  was a beach, though this extended no great distance along the shore, the  remainder being composed of the black rock of which the hills were  formed. And now, having a closer regard to the beach upon the weed-side  of the island, I discovered amid the wrack that had been cast ashore, a  portion of the lower mast and topmast of some great ship, with rigging  attached; but the yards were all gone. This find, I pointed out to the  bo'sun, remarking that it might prove of use for firing; but he smiled at  me, telling me that the dried weed would make a very abundant fire, and  this without going to the labor of cutting the mast into suitable logs.    And now, he, in turn, called my attention to the place where the huge  fungi had come to a stop in their growing, and I saw that in the center  of the valley there was a great circular opening in the earth, like to  the mouth of a prodigious pit, and it appeared to be filled to within a  few feet of the mouth with water, over which spread a brown and horrid  scum. Now, as may be supposed, I stared with some intentness at this; for  it had the look of having been made with labor, being very symmetrical,  yet I could not conceive but that I was deluded by the distance, and that  it would have a rougher appearance when viewed from a nearer standpoint.    From contemplating this, I looked down upon the little bay in which our  boat floated. Job was sitting in the stern, sculling gently with the  steering oar and watching us. At that, I waved my hand to him in  friendly fashion, and he waved back, and then, even as I looked, I saw  something in the water under the boat--something dark colored that was  all of a-move. The boat appeared to be floating over it as over a mass  of sunk weed, and then I saw that, whatever it was, it was rising to the  surface. At this a sudden horror came over me, and I clutched the bo'sun  by the arm, and pointed, crying out that there was something under the  boat. Now the bo'sun, so soon as he saw the thing, ran forward to the  brow of the hill and, placing his hands to his mouth after the fashion  of a trumpet, sang out to the boy to bring the boat to the shore and  make fast the painter to a large piece of rock. At the bo'sun's hail,  the lad called out \"I, I,\" and, standing up, gave a sweep with his oar  that brought the boat's head round towards the beach. Fortunately for  him he was no more than some thirty yards from the shore at this time,  else he had never come to it in this life; for the next moment the  moving brown mass beneath the boat shot out a great tentacle and the oar  was torn out of Job's hands with such power as to throw him right over  on to the starboard gunnel of the boat. The oar itself was drawn down  out of sight, and for the minute the boat was left untouched. Now the  bo'sun cried out to the boy to take another oar, and get ashore while  still he had chance, and at that we all called out various things, one  advising one thing, and another recommending some other; yet our advice  was vain, for the boy moved not, at which some cried out that he was  stunned. I looked now to where the brown thing had been, for the boat  had moved a few fathoms from the spot, having got some way upon her  before the oar was snatched, and thus I discovered that the monster had  disappeared, having, I conceived, sunk again into the depths from which  it had risen; yet it might re-appear at any moment, and in that case the  boy would be taken before our eyes.    At this juncture, the bo'sun called to us to follow him, and led the way  to the great fissure up which we had climbed, and so, in a minute, we  were, each of us, scrambling down with what haste we could make towards  the valley. And all the while as I dropped from ledge to ledge, I was  full of torment to know whether the monster had returned.    The bo'sun was the first man to reach the bottom of the cleft, and he set  off immediately round the base of the rock to the beach, the rest of us  following him as we made safe our footing in the valley. I was the third  man down; but, being light and fleet of foot, I passed the second man and  caught up with the bo'sun just as he came upon the sand. Here, I found  that the boat was within some five fathoms of the beach, and I could see  Job still lying insensible; but of the monster there was no sign.    And so matters were, the boat nearly a dozen yards from the shore, and  Job lying insensible in her; with, somewhere near under her keel (for all  that we knew) a great monster, and we helpless upon the beach.    Now I could not imagine how to save the lad, and indeed I fear he had  been left to destruction--for I had deemed it madness to try to reach the  boat by swimming--but for the extraordinary bravery of the bo'sun, who,  without hesitating, dashed into the water and swam boldly out to the  boat, which, by the grace of God, he reached without mishap, and climbed  in over the bows. Immediately, he took the painter and hove it to us,  bidding us tail on to it and bring the boat to shore without delay, and  by this method of gaining the beach he showed wisdom; for in this wise he  escaped attracting the attention of the monster by unneedful stirring of  the water, as he would surely have done had he made use of an oar.    Yet, despite his care, we had not finished with the creature; for, just  as the boat grounded, I saw the lost steering oar shoot up half its  length out of the sea, and immediately there was a mighty splather in the  water astern, and the next instant the air seemed full of huge, whirling  arms. At that, the bo'sun gave one look behind, and, seeing the thing  upon him, snatched the boy into his arms, and sprang over the bows on to  the sand. Now, at sight of the devil-fish, we had all made for the back  of the beach at a run, none troubling even to retain the painter, and  because of this, we were like to have lost the boat; for the great  cuttlefish had its arms all splayed about it, seeming to have a mind to  drag it down into the deep water from whence it had risen, and it had  possibly succeeded, but that the bo'sun brought us all to our senses;  for, having laid Job out of harm's way, he was the first to seize the  painter, which lay trailed upon the sand, and, at that, we got back our  courage and ran to assist him.    Now there happened to be convenient a great spike of rock, the same,  indeed, to which the bo'sun had bidden Job tie the boat, and to this we  ran the painter, taking a couple of turns about it and two half-hitches,  and now, unless the rope carried away, we had no reason to fear the loss  of the boat; though there seemed to us to be a danger of the creature's  crushing it. Because of this, and because of a feeling of natural anger  against the thing, the bo'sun took up from the sand one of the spears  which had been cast down when we hauled the boat ashore. With this, he  went down so far as seemed safe, and prodded the creature in one of its  tentacles--the weapon entering easily, at which I was surprised, for I  had understood that these monsters were near to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10554"],[0,"Right Ho, Jeeves (#10)"],[1,"ago I was compelled to take him off a case because his handling of it was  so footling. And, anyway, I resent this assumption, if assumption is the  word I want, that Jeeves is the only fellow with brain. I object to the  way everybody puts things up to him without consulting me and letting me  have a stab at them first.\"    She seemed about to speak, but I checked her with a gesture.    \"It is true that in the past I have sometimes seen fit to seek Jeeves's  advice. It is possible that in the future I may seek it again. But I  claim the right to have a pop at these problems, as they arise, in  person, without having everybody behave as if Jeeves was the only onion  in the hash. I sometimes feel that Jeeves, though admittedly not  unsuccessful in the past, has been lucky rather than gifted.\"    \"Have you and Jeeves had a row?\"    \"Nothing of the kind.\"    \"You seem to have it in for him.\"    \"Not at all.\"    And yet I must admit that there was a modicum of truth in what she said.  I had been feeling pretty austere about the man all day, and I'll tell  you why.    You remember that he caught that 12.45 train with the luggage, while I  remained on in order to keep a luncheon engagement. Well, just before I  started out to the tryst, I was pottering about the flat, and suddenly--I  don't know what put the suspicion into my head, possibly the fellow's  manner had been furtive--something seemed to whisper to me to go and have  a look in the wardrobe.    And it was as I had suspected. There was the mess-jacket still on its  hanger. The hound hadn't packed it.    Well, as anybody at the Drones will tell you, Bertram Wooster is a pretty  hard chap to outgeneral. I shoved the thing in a brown-paper parcel and  put it in the back of the car, and it was on a chair in the hall now. But  that didn't alter the fact that Jeeves had attempted to do the dirty on  me, and I suppose a certain what-d'you-call-it had crept into my manner  during the above remarks.    \"There has been no breach,\" I said. \"You might describe it as a passing  coolness, but no more. We did not happen to see eye to eye with regard to  my white mess-jacket with the brass buttons and I was compelled to assert  my personality. But----\"    \"Well, it doesn't matter, anyway. The thing that matters is that you are  talking piffle, you poor fish. Jeeves lost his grip? Absurd. Why, I saw  him for a moment when he arrived, and his eyes were absolutely glittering  with intelligence. I said to myself 'Trust Jeeves,' and I intend to.\"    \"You would be far better advised to let me see what I can accomplish,  Aunt Dahlia.\"    \"For heaven's sake, don't you start butting in. You'll only make matters  worse.\"    \"On the contrary, it may interest you to know that while driving here I  concentrated deeply on this trouble of Angela's and was successful in  formulating a plan, based on the psychology of the individual, which I am  proposing to put into effect at an early moment.\"    \"Oh, my God!\"    \"My knowledge of human nature tells me it will work.\"    \"Bertie,\" said Aunt Dahlia, and her manner struck me as febrile, \"lay  off, lay off! For pity's sake, lay off. I know these plans of yours. I  suppose you want to shove Angela into the lake and push young Glossop in  after her to save her life, or something like that.\"    \"Nothing of the kind.\"    \"It's the sort of thing you would do.\"    \"My scheme is far more subtle. Let me outline it for you.\"    \"No, thanks.\"    \"I say to myself----\"    \"But not to me.\"    \"Do listen for a second.\"    \"I won't.\"    \"Right ho, then. I am dumb.\"    \"And have been from a child.\"    I perceived that little good could result from continuing the discussion.  I waved a hand and shrugged a shoulder.    \"Very well, Aunt Dahlia,\" I said, with dignity, \"if you don't want to be  in on the ground floor, that is your affair. But you are missing an  intellectual treat. And, anyway, no matter how much you may behave like  the deaf adder of Scripture which, as you are doubtless aware, the more  one piped, the less it danced, or words to that effect, I shall carry on  as planned. I am extremely fond of Angela, and I shall spare no effort to  bring the sunshine back into her heart.\"    \"Bertie, you abysmal chump, I appeal to you once more. Will you please  lay off? You'll only make things ten times as bad as they are already.\"    I remember reading in one of those historical novels once about a chap--a  buck he would have been, no doubt, or a macaroni or some such bird as  that--who, when people said the wrong thing, merely laughed down from  lazy eyelids and flicked a speck of dust from the irreproachable Mechlin  lace at his wrists. This was practically what I did now. At least, I  straightened my tie and smiled one of those inscrutable smiles of mine. I  then withdrew and went out for a saunter in the garden.    And the first chap I ran into was young Tuppy. His brow was furrowed, and  he was moodily bunging stones at a flowerpot.        -8-      I think I have told you before about young Tuppy Glossop. He was the  fellow, if you remember, who, callously ignoring the fact that we had  been friends since boyhood, betted me one night at the Drones that I  could swing myself across the swimming bath by the rings--a childish feat  for one of my lissomeness--and then, having seen me well on the way,  looped back the last ring, thus rendering it necessary for me to drop  into the deep end in formal evening costume.    To say that I had not resented this foul deed, which seemed to me  deserving of the title of the crime of the century, would be paltering  with the truth. I had resented it profoundly, chafing not a little at the  time and continuing to chafe for some weeks.    But you know how it is with these things. The wound heals. The agony  abates.    I am not saying, mind you, that had the opportunity presented itself of  dropping a wet sponge on Tuppy from some high spot or of putting an eel  in his bed or finding some other form of self-expression of a like  nature, I would not have embraced it eagerly; but that let me out. I mean  to say, grievously injured though I had been, it gave me no pleasure to  feel that the fellow's bally life was being ruined by the loss of a girl  whom, despite all that had passed, I was convinced he still loved like  the dickens.    On the contrary, I was heart and soul in favour of healing the breach and  rendering everything hotsy-totsy once more between these two young  sundered blighters. You will have gleaned that from my remarks to Aunt  Dahlia, and if you had been present at this moment and had seen the  kindly commiserating look I gave Tuppy, you would have gleaned it still  more.    It was one of those searching, melting looks, and was accompanied by the  hearty clasp of the right hand and the gentle laying of the left on the  collar-bone.    \"Well, Tuppy, old man,\" I said. \"How are you, old man?\"    My commiseration deepened as I spoke the words, for there had been no  lighting up of the eye, no answering pressure of the palm, no sign  whatever, in short, of any disposition on his part to do Spring dances at  the sight of an old friend. The man seemed sandbagged. Melancholy, as I  remember Jeeves saying once about Pongo Twistleton when he was trying to  knock off smoking, had marked him for her own. Not that I was surprised,  of course. In the circs., no doubt, a certain moodiness was only natural.    I released the hand, ceased to knead the shoulder, and, producing the old  case, offered him a cigarette.    He took it dully.    \"Are you here, Bertie?\" he asked.    \"Yes, I'm here.\"    \"Just passing through, or come to stay?\"    I thought for a moment. I might have told him that I had arrived at  Brinkley Court with the express intention of bringing Angela and himself  together once more, of knitting up the severed threads, and so on and so  forth; and for perhaps half the time required for the lighting of a  gasper I had almost decided to do so. Then, I reflected, better, on the  whole, perhaps not. To broadcast the fact that I proposed to take him and  Angela and play on them as on a couple of stringed instruments might have  been injudicious. Chaps don't always like being played on as on a  stringed instrument.    \"It all depends,\" I said. \"I may remain. I may push on. My plans are  uncertain.\"    He nodded listlessly, rather in the manner of a man who did not give a  damn what I did, and stood gazing out over the sunlit garden. In build  and appearance, Tuppy somewhat resembles a bulldog, and his aspect now  was that of one of these fine animals who has just been refused a slice  of cake. It was not difficult for a man of my discernment to read what  was in his mind, and it occasioned me no surprise, therefore, when his  next words had to do with the subject marked with a cross on the agenda  paper.    \"You've heard of this business of mine, I suppose? Me and Angela?\"    \"I have, indeed, Tuppy, old man.\"    \"We've bust up.\"    \"I know. Some little friction, I gather, _in re_ Angela's shark.\"    \"Yes. I said it must have been a flatfish.\"    \"So my informant told me.\"    \"Who did you hear it from?\"    \"Aunt Dahlia.\"    \"I suppose she cursed me properly?\"    \"Oh, no.\"    \"Beyond referring to you in one passage as 'this blasted Glossop', she  was, I thought, singularly temperate in her language for a woman who at  one time hunted regularly with the Quorn. All the same, I could see, if  you don't mind me saying so, old man, that she felt you might have  behaved with a little more tact.\"    \"Tact!\"    \"And I must admit I rather agreed with her. Was it nice, Tuppy, was it  quite kind to take the bloom off Angela's shark like that? You must  remember that Angela's shark is very dear to her. Could you not see what  a sock on the jaw it would be for the poor child to hear it described by  the man to whom she had given her heart as a flatfish?\"    I saw that he was struggling with some powerful emotion.    \"And"]]]
