It is not his personal  worthiness, but the worth of his work, that recommends him to the  attention of the Jewish people. He was not a loyal general, and he was  not a faithful chronicler of the struggle with Rome; but he had the  merit of writing a number of books on the Jews and Judaism, which not  only met the desire for knowledge of his nation in his own day, but  which have been preserved through the ages and still remain one of the  chief authorities for Jewish history. He lived at the great crisis of  his people, when it stood at the parting of the ways. And while in his  life he was patronized by those who had destroyed the national center,  after his death he found favor with that larger religious community  which was beginning to carry part of the Jewish mission to the Gentiles.  For centuries Josephus was regarded by the Christians as the standard  historian of the Jews, and, though for long he was forgotten and  neglected by his own people, in modern times he has been carefully  studied also by them, and his merits and demerits both as patriot and as  writer have been critically examined.    It has been my especial aim in this book to consider Josephus from the  Jewish point of view. I have made no attempt to extenuate his personal  conduct or his literary faults. My judgment may appear somewhat severe,  but it is when tried by the test of faithfulness to his nation that  Josephus is found most wanting; and I hope that while extenuating  nothing I have not set down aught in malice.    Of the extensive literature bearing on the subject, the books to which I  am under the greatest obligation are Niese's text of the collected works  and Schuerer's _History of the Jewish People in the Time of Jesus_. I  have given in an Appendix a Bibliography, which contains the names of  most of the works I have referred to. I would mention in particular  Schlatter's _Zur Topographie und Geschichte Palaestinas_, which is a  remarkably stimulating and suggestive book, and which confirmed a view I  had formed independently, that in the _Wars_, as in the _Antiquities_,  Josephus is normally a compiler of other men's writings, and constantly  expresses opinions not his own.    My greatest debt of thanks, however, is due to the spoken rather than  the written word. Doctor Buechler, the Principal of Jews' College,  London, has constantly assisted me with advice, directed me to sources  of information, and let me draw plentifully from his own large stores of  knowledge about Josephus; and Doctor Friedlaender, Sabato Morais  Professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, has done me the  brotherly service of reading my manuscript and making many valuable  suggestions on it. To their generous help this book owes more than I can  acknowledge.    NORMAN BENTWICH.    _Cairo, February, 1914_.          CONTENTS      I.    THE JEWS AND THE ROMANS    II.

RUINS OF AN ANCIENT SYNAGOGUE AT KAFR BIR'IM, UPPER GALILEE        JOSEPHUS          I    THE JEWS AND THE ROMANS      The life and works of Flavius Josephus are bound up with the struggle of  the Jews against the Romans, and in order to appreciate them it is  necessary to summarize the relations of the two peoples that led up to  that struggle.    It is related in the Midrash that the city of Rome was founded on the  day Solomon married an Egyptian princess. The Rabbis doubtless meant by  this legend that the power of Rome was created to be a scourge for  Israel's backslidings. They identified Rome with the Edom of the Bible,  representing thus that the struggle between Esau and Jacob was carried  on by their descendants, the Romans and the Jews, and would continue  throughout history.[1] Yet the earliest relations of the two peoples  were friendly and peaceful. They arose out of the war of independence  that the Maccabean brothers waged against the Syrian Empire in the  middle of the second century B.C.E., when the loyal among the people  were roused to stand up for their faith. Antiochus Epiphanes, anxious to  strengthen his tottering empire, which had been shaken by its struggles  with Rome, sought to force violently on the Jews a pagan Hellenism that  was already making its way among them. He succeeded only in evoking the  latent force of their national consciousness. Rome was already the  greatest power in the world: she had conquered the whole of Italy; she  had destroyed her chief rival in the West, the Phoenician colony of  Carthage; she had made her will supreme in Greece and Macedonia. Her  senate was the arbiter of the destinies of kingdoms, and though for the  time it refrained from extending Roman sway over Egypt and Asia, its  word there was law. Its policy was \"divide and rule,\" to hold supreme  sway by encouraging small nationalities to maintain their independence  against the unwieldy empires which the Hellenistic successors of  Alexander had carved out for themselves in the Orient.    [Footnote 1: Lev. R. xiii. (5), quoted in Schechter, Aspects of Rabbinic  Theology, p. 100.]    At the bidding of the Roman envoy, Antiochus Epiphanes himself,  immediately before his incursion into Jerusalem, had slunk away from  Alexandria; and hence it was natural that Judas Maccabaeus, when he had  vindicated the liberty of his nation, should look to Rome for support in  maintaining that liberty. In the year 161 B.C.E. he sent Eupolemus the  son of Johanan and Jason the son of Eleazar, \"to make a league of amity  and confederacy with the Romans\"[1]: and the Jews were received as  friends, and enrolled in the class of Socii. His brother Jonathan  renewed the alliance in 146 B.C.E.; Simon renewed it again five years  later, and John Hyrcanus, when he succeeded to the high priesthood, made  a fresh treaty.[2] Supported by the friendship, and occasionally by the  diplomatic interference, of the Western Power, the Jews did not require  the intervention of her arms to uphold their independence against the  Seleucid monarchs, whose power was rapidly falling into ruin. At the  beginning of the first century B.C.E., however, Rome, having emerged  triumphant from a series of civil struggles in her own dominions, found  herself compelled to take an active part in the affairs of the East.  During her temporary eclipse there had been violent upheavals in Asia.  The semi-barbarous kings of Pontus and Armenia took advantage of the  opportunity to overrun the Hellenized provinces and put all the Greek  and Roman inhabitants to the sword. To avenge this outrage, Rome sent to  the East, in 73 B.C.E., her most distinguished soldier, Pompeius, or  Pompey, who, in two campaigns, laid the whole of Asia Minor and Syria at  his feet.    [Footnote 1: I Macc. viii. 7. It is interesting to note that the sons  had Greek names, while their fathers had Hebrew names.]    [Footnote 2: I Macc. xii. 3; xiv. 24.]    Unfortunately civil strife was waging in Palestine between the two  Hasmonean brothers, Aristobulus and Hyrcanus, who fought for the throne  on the death of the queen Alexandra Salome. Both in turn appealed to  Pompey to come to their aid, on terms of becoming subject to the Roman  overlord. At the same time, a deputation from the Jewish nation appeared  before the general, to declare that they did not desire to be ruled by  kings: \"for what was handed down to them from their fathers was that  they should obey the priests of God; but these two princes, though the  descendants of priests, sought to transfer the nation to another form of  government, that it might he enslaved.\"    Pompey, who had resolved to establish a strong government immediately  subject to Rome over the whole of the near Orient, finally interfered on  behalf of Hyrcanus. Aristobulus resisted, at first somewhat  half-heartedly, but afterwards, when the Roman armies laid siege to  Jerusalem, with fierce determination. The struggle was in vain. On a  Sabbath, it is recorded, when the Jews desisted from their defense, the  Roman general forced his way into the city, and, regardless of Jewish  feeling, entered the Holy of Holies. The intrigues of the Jewish royal  house had brought about the subjection of the nation. As it is said in  the apocryphal Psalms of Solomon, which were written about this time: \"A  powerful smiter has God brought from the ends of the earth. He decreed  war upon the Jews and the land. The princes of the land went out with  joy to meet him, and said to him, 'Blessed be thy way; draw near and  enter in peace.'\" Yet Pompey did not venture, or did not care, to  destroy or rob the Temple, according to Cicero and Josephus,[1] because  of his innate moderation, but really, one may suspect, from less noble  motives. It was the custom of the Roman conquerors to demand the  surrender, not only of the earthly possessions of the conquered, but of  their gods, and to carry the vanquished images in the triumph which they  celebrated. But Pompey may have recognized the difference between the  Jewish religion and that of other peoples, or he realized the widespread  power"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9799"],[0,"It Happened in Egypt (#1)"],[1,"Agren, Tonya Allen and PG Distributed Proofreaders                      IT HAPPENED    IN    EGYPT    by    C.N. & A.M.

The Secret            IT HAPPENED IN EGYPT          CHAPTER I    THE SECRET AND THE GIRL      The exciting part began in Cairo; but perhaps I ought to go back to  what happened on the _Laconia_, between Naples and Alexandria. Luckily  no one can expect a man who actually rejoices in his nickname of  \"Duffer\" to know how or where a true story should begin.    The huge ship was passing swiftly out of the Bay of Naples, and already  we were in the strait between Capri and the mainland. I had come on  deck from the smoking-room for a last look at poor Vesuvius, who lost  her lovely head in the last eruption. I paced up and down, acutely  conscious of my great secret, the secret inspiring my voyage to Egypt.  For months it had been the hidden romance of life; now it began to seem  real. This is not the moment to tell how I got the papers that revealed  the secret, before I passed them on to Anthony Fenton at Khartum, for  him to say whether or not the notes were of real importance. But the  papers had been left in Rome by Ferlini, the Italian Egyptologist,  seventy years ago, when he gave to the museum at Berlin the treasures  he had unearthed. It was Ferlini who ransacked the pyramids all about  Meroe, that so-called island in the desert, where in its days of  splendour reigned the queens Candace. Fenton, stationed at Khartum, an  eager dabbler in the old lore of Egypt, sent me an enthusiastic  telegram the moment he read the documents. They confirmed legends of  the Sudan in which he had been interested. Putting two and two  together--the legends and Ferlini's notes--Anthony was convinced that  we had the clue to fortune. At once he applied for permission to  excavate under the little outlying mountain named by the desert folk  \"the Mountain of the Golden Pyramid.\" At first the spot was thought to  fall within the province given up to Garstang, digging for Liverpool  University. Later, however, the _Service des Antiquites_ pronounced the  place to be outside Garstang's borders, and it seemed that luck was  coming our way. No one but we two--Fenton and I--had any inkling of  what might lie hidden in the Mountain of the Golden Pyramid. That was  the great secret! Then Fenton had gone to the Balkans, on a flying trip  in every sense of the word. It was only a fortnight ago--I being then  in Rome--that I had had a wire from him in Salonica saying, \"Friends at  work to promote our scheme. Meet me on my return to Egypt.\" After that,  several telegrams had been exchanged; and here I was on the _Laconia_  bound for the land of my birth, full of hope and dreams.    For some moments distant Vesuvius had beguiled my thoughts from the  still more distant mountain of the secret, when suddenly a white girl  in a white hood and a long white cloak passed me on the white deck:  whereupon I forgot mountains of reality and dreams. She was one of  those tall, slim, long-limbed, dryad-sort of girls they are running up  nowadays in England and America with much success; and besides all  that, she was an amazing symphony in white and gold against an azure  Italian sea and sky, the two last being breezily jumbled together at  the moment for us on shipboard. She walked well in spite of the blue  turmoil; and if a fair girl with golden-brown hair gets herself up in  satiny white fur from head to foot she is evidently meant to be looked  at. Others were looking: also they were whispering after she went by:  and her serene air of being alone in a world made entirely for her  caused me to wonder if she were not Some One in Particular.    Just then a sweet, soft voice said, close to my ear:    \"Why, Duffer, dear, it can't possibly be you!\"    I gave a jump, for I hadn't heard that voice for many a year, and  between the ages of four and fourteen I had been in love with it.    \"Brigit O'Brien!\" said I. Then I grabbed her two hands and shook them  as if her arms had been branches of a young cherry tree, dropping  fruit.    \"Why not Biddy?\" she asked. \"Or are ye wanting me to call ye Lord  Ernest?\"    \"Good heavens, no! Once a Duffer, always a Duffer,\" I assured her. \"And  I've been thinking of you as Biddy from then till now. Only--\"    \"'Twas as clever a thing as a boy ever did,\" she broke in, with one of  her smiles that no man ever forgets, \"to begin duffing at an early age,  in order to escape all the professions and businesses your pastors and  masters proposed, and go your own way. Are ye at it still?\"    \"Rather! But you? I want to talk to you.\"    \"Then don't do it in a loud voice, if you please, because, as you must  have realized, if you've taken time to think, I'm Mrs. Jones at  present.\"    \"Why Jones?\"    \"Because Smith is engaged beforehand by too many people. Honestly,  without joking, I'm in danger here and everywhere, and it's a wicked,  selfish thing for me to come the way I have; but Rosamond Gilder is the  hardest girl to resist you ever saw, so I'm with her; and it's a long  history.\"    \"Rosamond Gilder? What--the Cannon Princess, the Bertha Krupp of  America?\"    \"Yes, the 'Gilded Babe' that used to be wheeled about in a caged  perambulator guarded by detectives: the 'Gilded Bud' whose coming out  in society was called the Million Dollar Debut: now she's just had her  twenty-first birthday, and the Sunday Supplements have promoted her to  be the Golden Girl, alternating with the Gilded Rose, although she's  the simplest creature, really, with a tremendous sense of the  responsibility of her riches. Poor child! There she is, walking toward  us now, with those two young men. Of course, young men! Droves of young  men! She can't get away from them any more than she can from her money.  No, she's stopped to talk to Cleopatra.\"    \"That tall, white girl Rosamond Gilder! Just before you came, I was  wondering who she was; and when you smiled at each other across the  deck it sprang into my mind that--that--\"    \"That what?\"    \"Oh, it seems stupid now.\"    \"Give me a chance to judge, dear Duffer.\"    \"Well, seeing you, and knowing--that is, it occurred to me you might be  travelling with--the daughter of--your late--\"    \"Good heavens, don't say any more! I've been frightened to death  somebody would get that brilliant notion in his head, especially as  Monny and her aunt came on board the _Laconia_ only at Monaco. Esme  O'Brien is in a convent school not thirty miles from there. But that's  the _deepest_ secret. Poor Peter Gilder's fears for his millionaire  girl would be child's play to what might happen, before such a mistake  was found out if once it was made. That's just one of the hundred  reasons why it would be as safe for Monny Gilder to travel with a bomb  in her dressing-bag as to have me in her train of dependants. She  telegraphed to New York for me, because of a stupid thing I said in a  letter, about being lonely: though she pretends it would be too dull  journeying to such a romantic country alone with a mere aunt. And she  thinks I 'attract adventures.' It's only too true. But I couldn't  resist her. Nobody can. Why, the first time I ever saw Monny she'd cast  herself down in a mud-puddle, and was screaming and kicking because she  wanted to walk while one adoring father, one sycophantic governess and  two trained nurses wanted her to get into an automobile. That was on my  honeymoon--heaven save the mark--! and Monny was nine. She has other  ways now of getting what she wants, but they're even more effective. I  laughed at her that first time, and she was so surprised at my  impudence she took a violent fancy to me. But I don't always laugh at  her now. Oh, she's a perfect terror, I assure you--and a still more  perfect darling! Such an angel of charity to the poor, such a demon of  obstinacy with the rich! I worship her. So does Cleopatra. So does  everybody who doesn't hate her. So will you the minute you've been  introduced. And by the way, why not? Why shouldn't I make myself useful  for once by arranging a match between Rosamond Gilder, the prettiest  heiress in America, and Lord Ernest Borrow, of the oldest family in  Ireland?\"    \"And the poorest.\"    \"All the more reason why. Don't you _see?_\"    \"She mightn't.\"    \"Well, what's the good of her having all that money if she doesn't get  hold of a really grand title to hang it on? I shall tell her that  Borrow comes down from Boru, Brian Boru the rightful "]]]
