One of them  has laid down what seems a paradox, viz., that coffee contains fewer  nutritive properties than the ordinary food of man, and yet that the  man who makes it his principal food is stronger than one who feeds  on meat and wine. In support of this paradox, our _savant_ calls the  example of the miners of the coal-pits of Charleroi, who never eat  meat except a very small quantity on Sundays, and whose daily meals  consist exclusively of bread and butter and coffee. These men, he  says, are strong, muscular, and able to do, and actually perform, more  hard work than the miners of the coal-pits of Onzin, in France, who  feed largely on the more nutritive articles, meat and vegetables, and  drink wine or beer. Another _savant_, taking nearly the same views,  insists that the Arabs are able to live moderately, and to make long  abstinences, as they do, entirely on account of their extensive use  of coffee. But this last assertion is demolished, by the declaration  of M. d'Abbadie, who has just returned from Abyssinia, that certain  tribes of Arabs and Abyssinians who do _not_ use coffee can  support greater fatigue than those who do. In presence of such very  contradictory facts, who shall say which of the learned doctors is in  the right?\"           *       *       *       *       *    A CURIOUS TRIO.--Mr. Dallas, when Secretary of the Treasury, says  Mr. Paulding, told me the following story, which he had from Mr.  Breck:--When the Duc de Liancourt was in Philadelphia, sometime after  the execution of Louis the Sixteenth, Mr. Breck called to see him  at his lodgings, in Strawberry-alley. Knocking at the door of a mean  looking house, a little ragged girl came out, who, on being asked for  the Duke, pointed to a door, which Mr. B. entered. At a little deal  table he found Cobbett, teaching the Duke and Monsieur Talleyrand  English!           *       *       *       *       *    BAD COOKERY A CAUSE OF DRUNKENKESS.--To what are we to ascribe the  prevalence of this detestable vice amongst us! Many causes might be  plausibly assigned for it, and one of them is our execrable cookery.  The demon of drunkenness inhabits the stomach. From that \"vasty deep\"  it calls for its appropriate offerings. But the demon may be appeased  by other agents than alcohol. A well-cooked, warmed, nutritious meal  allays the craving quite as effectually as a dram; but cold, crude,  indigestible viands, not only do not afford the required _solatium_ to  the rebellious organ, but they aggravate the evil, and add intensity  to the morbid avidity for stimulants. It is remarked that certain  classes are particularly obnoxious to drunkenness, such as sailors,  carriers, coachmen, and other wandering tribes whose ventral  insurrections are not periodically quelled by regular and comfortable  meals. Country doctors, for the same reason, not unfrequently manifest  a stronger predilection for their employers' bottles than their  patients do for theirs. In the absence of innocuous and benign  appliances, the deleterious are had recourse to exorcise the fiend  that is raging within them. These views are explicable by the laws  of physiology, but this is not the place for such disquisitions. One  reason why the temperance movement has been arrested in this country  is, that while one sensual gratification was withdrawn, another was  not provided. The intellectual excitements which were offered as a  substitute have not been found to answer the desired purpose. Our  temperance coffee-houses are singularly deficient in gastronomical  attractions; and the copious decoctions of coffee and chicory which  are there served up, with that nauseous accompaniment, buttered toast,  are more calculated to create a craving for stimulants than allay  it. The lower classes of Scotland are as deficient in knowledge of  cookery as the natives of the Sandwich Islands; and if our apostles of  temperance would employ a few clever cooks to go through the country  and teach the wives and daughters of the workingmen to dress meat  and vegetables, and make soups, and cheap and palatable farinaceous  messes, they would do more in one year to advance their cause, than  in twenty by means of long winded moral orations, graced with all  the flowers of oratory.--_Wilson on the Social Condition of France as  compared with that of England_.           *       *       *       *       *    THE MONKEY AND THE WATCH.--A distinguished lord, going from home, left  his watch hanging beside his bed. A tame monkey, who was in the habit  of imitating the actions of his master, took the watch, and with the  aid of a band, fastened it to his side. A moment afterward he drew  it forth and wound it. Then he looked at it, and said, \"This goes too  fast.\" He opened it, put back the hand, and again adjusted it to his  side. A few moments passed, and he took it in his hand once more.  \"Oh!\" said the imitator, \"now it goes too slow. What a trouble it is!  How can it be remedied?\" He winds it again with the regulator; then  closes it, and applies it gracefully to the ear. \"This movement is  wrong, still;\" and he wound it with the key in another way. Then  bent to listen to it. \"It does not go well, yet.\" He opened the case;  looked and examined every part; touched this wheel, stopped that,  moved another; in short, injured it so much by altering and shaking  it in his hand, that it at length ceased all motion. Guard us, O  propitious Heaven! from quacks that perform amongst men, as did the  monkey with the unfortunate watch.--_From the Italian_.           *       *       *       *       *    A SYRIAN CHRISTIAN AND PHILOSOPHER.--When supper was brought in Amu  Lyas, or Uncle Lyas, as Iskender always respectfully called him,  said a grace of twenty minutes before he sat down, and one of equal  duration after he got up. He was perpetually counting his beads and  uttering devout sayings--which partly accounted for his influence with  the priests. He and I agreed very well at the beginning, although in  our very first conversation he forced on a religious discussion, and  plainly told me to what place all heretics were irrevocably doomed.  On this and other occasions he strictly maintained that the earth is  stationary, that it is surrounded by the sea, that the moon rises and  sets, and that the stars are no bigger than they seem; and turned pale  with indignation at any contrary statements, which he asserted to be  direct attacks on the foundation of the Christian religion. Further  experience taught me that he was a very fair representative of  public opinion among a large class of Syrian Christians. He was an  ardent desirer of French domination, and entertained the most stupid  prejudices against the English. I generally found that the Levantines  preferred the French, whilst we are great favorites with the  Arabs.--_Two Years in a Levantine Family_.           *       *       *       *       *    THE BRITISH HIERARCHY.--The Eternal Anarch, with his old waggling  addle-head full of mere windy rumor, and his old insatiable paunch  full of mere hunger and indigestion tragically blended, and the  hissing discord of all the Four Elements persuasively pleading to  him;--he, set to choose, would be very apt to vote for such a set of  demigods to you.--_Carlyle's Latter-Day Pamphlets_.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM BOHEMIAN POEMS, TRANSLATED BY A.H. WRAITSALL, M.A., JUST  PUBLISHED IN LONDON.]      Whither, oh, whither, now all things are over?      We to our journey and he to his home;    Eyes cannot pierce through the vail that must cover      Him whom we laid in the still silent tomb.    He hath but ended his journey before us,      We for a season are sojourning still    On the same earth with the same heaven o'er us,--      Turn we, oh, turn we, our tasks to fulfill!    Whither, oh, whither, now all things are ended?      We to our labor and he to his rest;    Let not the heart by its woe be offended,      Man seeks the pleasant, but God gives the best.           *       *       *       *       *    FROM HOUSEHOLD WORDS.    THE YOUNG ADVOCATE.    Antoine de Chaulieu was the son of a poor gentleman of Normandy,  with a long genealogy, a short rent-roll, and a large family. Jacques  Rollet was the son of a brewer, who did not know who his grandfather  was; but he had a long purse and only two children. As these youths  flourished in the early days of liberty, equality, and fraternity,  and were near neighbors, they naturally hated each other. Their enmity  commenced at school, where the delicate and refined De Chaulieu being  the only gentilhomme amongst the scholars, was the favorite of the  master (who was a bit of an aristocrat in his heart), although he was  about the worst dressed boy in the establishment, and never had a sou  to spend; whilst Jacques Rollet, sturdy and rough, with smart clothes  and plenty of money, got flogged six days in the week, ostensibly  for being stupid and not learning his lessons--which, indeed, he did  not, but, in reality, for constantly quarreling with and insulting De  Chaulieu, who had not strength to cope with him. When they left the  academy, the feud continued in all its vigor, and was fostered by a  thousand little circumstances arising out of the state of the times,  till a separation ensued in consequence of an aunt of Antoine de  Chaulieu's undertaking the expense of sending him to Paris to study  the law, and of maintaining him there during the necessary period.    With the progress of events came some degree of reaction in favor  of birth and nobility, and then Antoine, who had passed for the bar,  began to hold up his head and endeavored to push his fortunes; but  fate seemed against him. He felt certain that if he possessed any gift  in the world it was that of eloquence, but he could get no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12984"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions — Volume 1 (#10)"],[1," full of old Nick for anything.\"    [Illustration: THE HOMESTEAD AT AMHERST, MASS.  _Now owned by Mr. Hiram Eaton of New York._]    It was in Amherst, however, and not in Newfane, from Cousin Mary, and  not from his dear Grandmother Esther, that Eugene got the New England  \"bent\" in his Missouri mind. It is hard to separate the fact from the  fancy in his story of \"My Grandmother.\" His youth from 1856 to 1865 was  lived in Amherst. His only visit to the Field homestead in Newfane was  when he was nine years old. And of this he has written, \"we stayed  there seven months and the old lady got all the grandsons she wanted.  She did not invite us to repeat the visit.\" He also confessed that all  his love for nature dated from that visit. As a boy he would never have  been permitted to indulge the fondness for animal pets under \"the dark  penetrating eyes\" of his grandmother, that was tolerated and became a  life-habit by the \"gracious love\" of Mary Field French. Of this  fondness for pets, Roswell has written that it amounted to a passion.  \"But unlike other boys he seemed to carry his pets into a higher sphere  and to give them personality. For each pet, whether dog, cat, bird,  goat, or squirrel--he had the family distrust of a horse--he not only  had a name, but it was his delight to fancy that each possessed a  peculiar dialect of human speech, and each he addressed in the humorous  manner conceived. When in childhood he was conducting a poultry annex  to the homestead, each chicken was properly instructed to respond to a  peculiar call, and Finniken, Minniken, Winniken, Dump, Poog, Boog  seemed to recognize immediately the queer intonations of their master  with an intelligence that is not usually accorded to chickens.\"    I cannot forbear to introduce here a characteristic bit of evidence  from Eugene Field's own pen of the survival of the passion for pets to  which his brother testifies:      \"It is only under stress,\" said he in his allotted column in the    Chicago Record of January 9th, 1892, \"nay, under distress, that the    mysterious veil of the editorial-room may properly be thrown aside    and the secret thereof disclosed. It is under a certain grievous    distress that we make this statement now:      \"For a number of months the silent partner in the construction of    this sporadic column of 'Sharps and Flats' has been a little fox    terrier given to the writer hereof by his friend, Mr. Will J. Davis.    We named our little companion Jessie, and our attachment to her was    wholly reciprocated by Jessie herself, although (and we make this    confession very shamefacedly) our enthusiasm for Jessie was by no    means shared by the prudent housewife in charge of the writer's    domestic affairs. Jessie contributed to and participated in our work    in this wise: She would sit and admiringly watch the writer at his    work, wagging her abridged tail cordially whenever he bestowed a    casual glance upon her, threatening violence to every intruder,    warning her master of the approach of every garrulous visitor, and    oftentimes, when she felt lonely, insisted on climbing up into her    master's lap and slumbering there while he wrote and wrote away. We    have tried our poems on Jessie, and she always liked them; leastwise    she always wagged her tail approvingly and smiled her flatteries as    only a very intelligent little dog can. Some folk think that our    poetry drove Jessie away from home, but we know better; Jessie    herself would deny that malicious imputation were she here now and    could she speak.      \"To this little companion we became strongly, perhaps foolishly,    attached. She walked with us by day, hunting rats and playing    famously every variety of intelligent antics. Whither we went she    went, and at night she shared our couch with us. Though only nine    months old Jessie stole into this life of ours so very far that    years seemed hardly to compass the period and honesty of our    friendship.      \"Well, last Tuesday night Jessie disappeared--vanished as    mysteriously as if the earth had opened up and swallowed her. She    had been playing with a discreet dog friend in Fullerton Avenue, and    that was the last seen of her! Where can she have gone? It is very    lonesome without Jessie. Moreover there are poems to be read for her    approval before they can be printed; the great cause of literature    waits upon Jessie. She must be found and restored to her proper    sphere.      \"Jessie perhaps was not beautiful, yet she was fair to her master's    eyes. She was white with yellow ears and a brownish blaze over her    left eye and warty cheek. She weighed perhaps twenty pounds (for    Jessie never had dyspepsia), and one mark you surely could tell her    by was the absence of a nail from her left forepaw, the honorable    penalty of an encounter with an enraged setting hen in our barn last    month.      \"Jessie's master is not rich, for the poetry that fox terriers    approve is not remunerative; but that master has accumulated (by    means of industrious application to his work and his friends) the    sum of $20, which he will cheerfully pay to the man, woman, or child    who will bring Jessie back again. For he is a weak human creature,    is Jessie's master, in his loneliness, without his faithful,    admiring little dumb friend.\"    Two days later Field printed the following letter and his answer  thereto, both written by the same hand in his column:      CHICAGO, January 10th.      _To the Editor_: I am very sorry for the gentleman who writes your    Sharps and Flats, for I know what it is to lose a little dog. I had    one once and some boy I guess took it off and never brought it back    again. I have got a maltese cat and four beautiful kittens, and    should like to send the gentleman one of the kittens if he wants    one. Maybe he would get to like the kitten as much as he did the    little dog. Respectfully, your little friend,      EDITH LONG.      \"Many thanks to our charming little correspondent; she has a gentle    heart, we know. What havoc one of those mischievous creatures would    make! In the first place it would accomplish the destruction of    these little canaries of ours which now flit about this lovely    disordered room, perching confidently upon folios and bric-a-brac    and hopping blithely over the manuscripts and papers on the table.    In the basement against the furnace, three beautiful fleecy little    chickens have just hatched out. How long do you suppose it would be    before that wicked little kitten discovered and compassed the    demolition of those innocent baby fowls? Then again there are    rabbits in the stable and very tame pigeons and the tiniest of    bantams. It would be very dreadful to introduce a truculent kitten    (and all felines are naturally truculent) into such society. And our    blood fairly congeals when we think that perhaps (oh, fearful    possibility) that kitten might nose out and wantonly destroy the too    lovely butterflies stored away in yonder closet, which we have    appropriately named the cage of gloom.      \"Miss Edith must keep her kitten and may she have the pleasure of    its pretty antics. However, she must bear this in mind, that sooner    or later our pets come to grief.      \"Very, very many years ago, we read and cried over a little book    written by Grace Greenwood and entitled 'The History of My Pets.'    Even as a child we wondered why it was that evil invariably befell    the pets of youth.      \"We all know that most little folks are tender-hearted, yet there    are some who seem indifferent to pets, to have little sympathy with    the pathos of dumb animals. And we have so often wondered whether    after all these latter did not get more of pleasure or should we say    less of pain out of life than the others. The tender heart seldom    hardens; in maturer years its comprehensions and sympathies broaden,    and this of course involves pain. Are the delights of sympathy a    fair offset to the pains thereof?\"    The boy at Amherst was the father of the man at forty-two. It was to  the prototype of \"The Bench-Legged Fyce,\" known in Miss French's  household as \"Dooley,\" that the boy Eugene attributed his first verse,  a parody on the well-known lines, \"Oh, had I the wings of a dove!\"  Dooley's song ran:      _Oh, had I wings like a dove I would fly      Away from this world of fleas;    I'd fly all round Miss Emerson's yard      And light on Miss Emerson's trees._    It was rank disloyalty to the memory of \"Dooley\" to rename the  bench-legged fyce \"Sooner\" and locate the scene of his \"chronic repose\"  in St. Jo rather than under the flea-proof tree of Mrs. Emerson in  Amherst. But who regrets the poetic license as he reads:      _We all hev our choice, an' you like the rest,    Allow that dorg which you've got is the best;    I wouldn't give much for the boy 'at grows up    With no friendship subsistin' 'tween him and a pup;    When a fellow gits old--I tell you it's nice    To think of his youth and his bench-legged fyce!_    Although Eugene Field never forgot or forgave the terrors of the New  England Sabbath, its strict observance, its bad singing, doleful  prayers and interminable sermons, the impress of those all-day sessions  in church and Sunday-school was never eradicated from his life and  writings. Nothing else influenced his work or affected his style as  much as the morals and the literature of the Bible and the sacred songs  that were lined out week after week from the pulpit under which he  literally and figuratively sat when a youth. \"If,\" he has said, \"I  could be grateful to New England for nothing else I should bless her  forevermore for pounding me with the Bible and the Spelling-Book.\"    There is in the possession of the family the \"Notes of a Sermon by E.P.  Field,\" said to have been written by Eugene at the age of nine, when he  affected the middle initial"]]]
