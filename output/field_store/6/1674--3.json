Travellers  at Cairo and Constantinople are often startled at night by the racket  occasioned by the demonstrations made by the rightful possessors of a  locality in repelling its invasion by some straggling wanderer. At  Alexandria, in 1844, the dogs had multiplied to such an inconvenient  extent, that Mehemet Ali, to abate the nuisance, caused them to be  shipped in boats and conveyed to one of the islands at the mouth of  the Nile. But the streets, thus deprived of their habitual patroles,  were speedily infested by dogs from the suburbs, in such numbers that  the evil became greater than before, and in the following year, the  legitimate denizens were recalled from their exile in the Delta, and  speedily drove back the intruders within their original boundary. May  not this disposition of the dog be referable to the impulse by which,  in a state of nature, each pack appropriates its own hunting-fields  within a particular area? and may not the impulse which, even in a  state of domestication, they still manifest to attack a passing dog  upon the road, be a remnant of this localised instinct, and a  concomitant dislike of intrusion?    _Jackal_.--The Jackal[1] in the low country of Ceylon hunts thus in  packs, headed by a leader, and these audacious prowlers have been seen  to assault and pull down a deer. The small number of hares in the  districts they infest is ascribed to their depredations. In the legends  of the natives, and in the literature of the Buddhists, the jackal in  Ceylon is as essentially the type of cunning as the fox is the emblem of  craft and adroitness in the traditions of Europe. In fact, it is more  than doubtful whether the jackal of the East be not the creature alluded  to, in the various passages of the Sacred Writings which make allusion  to the artfulness and subtlety of the \"fox.\"    [Footnote 1: Canis Aureus, _Linn._]    These faculties they display in a high degree in their hunting  expeditions, especially in the northern portions of the island, where  they are found in the greatest numbers. In these districts, where the  wide sandy plains are thinly covered with brushwood, the face of the  country is diversified by patches of thick jungle and detached groups  of trees, that form insulated groves and topes. At dusk, or after  nightfall, a pack of jackals, having watched a hare or a small deer  take refuge in one of these retreats, immediately surround it on all  sides; and having stationed a few to watch the path by which the game  entered, the leader commences the attack by raising the unearthly cry  peculiar to their race, and which resembles the sound _okkay!_  loudly and rapidly repeated. The whole party then rush into the  jungle, and drive out the victim, which generally falls into the  ambush previously laid to entrap it.    A native gentleman[1], who had favourable opportunities of observing the  movements of these animals, informed me, that when a jackal has brought  down his game and killed it, his first impulse is to hide it in the  nearest jungle, whence he issues with an air of easy indifference to  observe whether anything more powerful than himself may be at hand, from  which he might encounter the risk of being despoiled of his capture. If  the coast be clear, he returns to the concealed carcase, and carries it  away, followed by his companions. But if a man be in sight, or any other  animal to be avoided, my informant has seen the jackal seize a coco-nut  husk in his mouth, or any similar substance, and fly at full speed, as  if eager to carry off his pretended prize, returning for the real booty  at some more convenient season.    [Footnote 1: Mr. D. de Silva Gooneratne.]    They are subject to hydrophobia, and instances are frequent in Ceylon  of cattle being bitten by them and dying in consequence.    [Illustration: JACKAL'S SKULL AND HORN]    An excrescence is sometimes found on the head of the jackal, consisting  of a small horny cone about half an inch in length, and concealed by a  tuft of hair. This the natives call _narrie-comboo_; and they aver that  this \"Jackal's Horn\" only grows on the head of the leader of the  pack.[1] Both the Singhalese and the Tamils regard it as a talisman, and  believe that its fortunate possessor can command by its instrumentality  the realisation of every wish, and that if stolen or lost by him, it  will invariably return of its own accord. Those who have jewels to  conceal rest in perfect security if along with them they can deposit a  narri-comboo, fully convinced that its presence is an effectual  safeguard against robbers.    [Footnote 1: In the Museum of the College of Surgeons, London (No.  4362 A), there is a cranium of a jackal which exhibits this strange  osseous process on the super-occipital; and I have placed along with  it a specimen of the horny sheath, which was presented to me by Mr.  Lavalliere, the late district judge of Kandy.]    One fabulous virtue ascribed to the _narrie-comboo_ by the Singhalese is  absurdly characteristic of their passion for litigation, as well as of  their perceptions of the \"glorious uncertainty of the law.\" It is the  popular belief that the fortunate discoverer of a jackal's horn becomes  thereby invincible in every lawsuit, and must irresistibly triumph over  every opponent. A gentleman connected \"with the Supreme Court of Colombo  has repeated to me a circumstance, within his own knowledge, of a  plaintiff who, after numerous defeats, eventually succeeded against his  opponent by the timely acquisition of this invaluable charm. Before the  final hearing of the cause, the mysterious horn was duly exhibited to  his friends; and the consequence was, that the adverse witnesses,  appalled by the belief that no one could possibly give judgment against  a person so endowed, suddenly modified their previous evidence, and  secured an unforeseen victory for the happy owner of the  _narrie-comboo!_    _The Mongoos_.--Of the Mongoos or Ichneumon four species have been  described; and one, that frequents the hills near Neuera-ellia[1], is so  remarkable from its bushy fur, that the invalid soldiers in the  sanatarium there, to whom it is familiar, have given it the name of the  \"Ceylon Badger.\"    [Footnote 1: _Herpestes vitticollis_. Mr. W. ELLIOTT, in his _Catalogue  of Mammalia found in the Southern Maharata Country_, Madras, 1840, says,  that \"One specimen of this Herpestes was procured by accident in the  Ghat forests in 1829, and is now deposited in the British Museum; it is  very rare, inhabiting only the thickest woods, and its habits are very  little known,\" p. 9. In Ceylon it is comparatively common.]    [Illustration: HERPESTES VITTICOLLIS.]    I have found universally that the natives of Ceylon attach no credit to  the European story of the Mongoos (_H. griseus_) resorting to some  plant, which no one has yet succeeded in identifying, as an antidote  against the bite of the venomous serpents on which it preys: There is no  doubt that, in its conflicts with the cobra de capello and other  poisonous snakes, which it attacks with as little hesitation as the  harmless ones, it may be seen occasionally to retreat, and even to  retire into the jungle, and, it is added, to eat some vegetable; but a  gentleman, who has been a frequent observer of its exploits, assures me  that most usually the herb it resorted to was grass; and if this were  not at hand, almost any other plant that grew near seemed equally  acceptable. Hence has probably arisen the long list of plants, such as  the _Ophioxylon serpentinum_ and _Ophiorhiza mungos_, the _Aristolochia  Indica_, the _Mimosa octandria_, and others, each of which has been  asserted to be the ichneumon's specific; whilst their multiplicity is  demonstrative of the non-existence of any one in particular on which the  animal relies as an antidote. Were there any truth in the tale as  regards the mongoos, it would be difficult to understand why creatures,  such as the secretary bird and the falcon, and others, which equally  destroy serpents, should be left defenceless, and the ichneumon alone  provided with a prophylactic. Besides, were the ichneumon inspired by  that courage which would result from the consciousness of security, it  would be so indifferent to the bite of the serpent that we might  conclude that, both in its approaches and its assault, it would be  utterly careless as to the precise mode of its attack. Such, however, is  far from being the case: and next to its audacity, nothing can be more  surprising than the adroitness with which it escapes the spring of the  snake under a due sense of danger, and the cunning with which it makes  its arrangements to leap upon the back and fasten its teeth in the head  of the cobra. It is this display of instinctive ingenuity that Lucan[1]  celebrates where he paints the ichneumon diverting the attention of the  asp, by the motion of his bushy tail, and then seizing it in the midst  of its confusion:--      \"Aspidas ut Pharias cauda solertior hostis    Ludit, et iratas incerta provocat umbra:           *       *       *       *       *    [Footnote 1: The passage in Lucan is a versification of the same  narrative related by Pliny, lib. viii. ch. 53; and AElian, lib. iii. ch.  22.]      Obliquusque caput vanas serpentis in auras    Effuse toto comprendit guttura morsu    Letiferam citra saniem; tunc irrita pestis    Exprimitur, faucesque fluunt pereunte veneno.\"                        _Pharsalia_, lib. iv. v. 729.    The mystery of the mongoos and its antidote has been referred to the  supposition that there may be some peculiarity in its organisation which  renders it _proof against_ the poison of the serpent. It remains for  future investigation to determine how far this conjecture is founded in  truth; and whether in the blood of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13331"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Chichester (1901) (#10)"],[1,"the remains; and  by the great care his son Gilbert exercised in labelling and  registering all the moulded and carved stone that was discovered in  the debris, the new tower and spire was designed upon the pattern of  the old one. Old prints and photographs were used to help in this work  of building a copy of what had been lost. But this task could not have  been done had it not been that Mr. Joseph Butler, a former resident  architect and Surveyor to the Chapter, had made measured drawings of  the whole, which supplied actual dimensions that otherwise could not  have been recovered. These drawings had come into the possession of  Mr. Slater, the architect associated with Sir. G. Scott in the  rebuilding of the tower, and they enabled him         \"to put together upon paper all the fragments with certainty       of correctness: so one thing with another, the whole design       was absolutely and indisputably recovered. The only       deviation from the design of the old steeple was this. The       four arms of the cross had been (probably in the fourteenth       century) raised some five or six feet in height, and thus       had buried a part of what had originally been the clear       height of the tower, and with it an ornamental arcading       running round it. I lifted out the tower from this       encroachment by adding five or six feet to its height; so       that it now rises above the surrounding roofs as much as it       originally did. I also omitted the partial walling up of the       belfry windows, which may be seen in old views.\" [28]      [27] See \"Recollections,\" p. 309. Edited by his son, 1861.    [28] _Ibid._, p. 310.    These statements have been taken from Sir Gilbert Scott's own account  of the work. He further assures us that many portions of the original  moulded and carved work were re-fixed in the new tower. As we have now  in existence so careful an imitation of the former tower, all praise  is due to Sir Gilbert Scott, Mr. George Gilbert Scott, and Mr. Slater,  for the admirable way in which they co-operated, so that their care  has given to posterity this admirable instance in which a lost  specimen of architectural art has been reproduced by successful  copying. But the satisfactory nature of the work is chiefly due to the  preservation of those careful studies of the original which were made  by Mr. Joseph Butler.    In 1867 the wall enclosing the library in the lady-chapel was removed,  and three years later, with the consent of the Duke of Richmond, the  floor was lowered to its original level and the chapel restored in  memory of Bishop Gilbert. Soon afterwards the windows were provided  with new stained glass.    During the last half of the nineteenth century several small portions  of the building were repaired, restored, or rebuilt. The cloister was  carefully restored by the late Mr. Gordon M. Hills. More recently the  roof of the lady-chapel, the two eastern pinnacles of the choir as  well as those two lower ones to the chapels of S.M. Magdalen, and S.  Catherine, have been restored by his son Mr. Gordon P.G. Hills,  A.R.I.B.A., with much care and consideration for the fabric of which  he is the surveyor. The latest act affecting the history of the  building has been the addition of a new north-western tower to take  the place of the unsightly rents and wreckage that have disfigured and  helped to destroy the structure at that part during the last two  hundred years. It was designed by the late Mr. J.L. Pearson, R.A.    [Illustration: SOUTH WEST VIEW OF THE CATHEDRAL FROM THE GARDEN OF  THE BISHOP'S PALACE. _Photochrom Co., Ltd., Photo_. ]          CHAPTER II.    THE EXTERIOR.      As a design, the west front offers four important parts for  observation; these are the two towers, the west wall of the nave  proper, with the gable and the windows which compose it, and then the  porch.    The #Towers# are now similar. The upper stage of that on the north  is an imitation, as far as possible, of the same section of the other  tower which was built in the thirteenth century. In its third stage  some differences are introduced. The masonry of the new work is  executed so as to carry on the courses of the old stonework that  attach it to the rest of the front. The new work has followed the  custom of the older and better traditions of the stonemasons, in that  it has been left strictly as it was finished by the tool upon the  \"banker.\" The natural and simple texture imparted by the action of  chiselling leaves a character upon the stonework similar to that of  the earlier work.    The upper portion of the new north-west tower [29] being copied from  that part of the old one to the south, it will be enough to describe  the original. But first it is necessary to notice the lower stage of  the southern tower. The buttressing on the south angle is of a later  date than the rest of this section of the tower. It has a low  weathered base. The central part of it has its projection at the base  reduced when it reaches its summit by means of three steep sloping  weatherings. There are also openings in the buttress for the staircase  windows. The two lower windows of the west front in this tower are not  placed in the same vertical line. This peculiarity has been followed  in the new tower. The upper of these two windows is pointed, and has  no label-mould. But the angle shafts that carry the arch have carved  capitals and square-moulded abaci. Above the head of the pointed  window the tower changes in character. The buttresses run up to the  top as broad, flat surfaces, except that the northern one is slightly  weathered twice. The coupled windows are more deeply recessed, having  three orders of moulded arch-stones instead of the two, as in the  lower window of a similar date; and the arch is carried by three  shafts attached as parts of the jamb-stones. The windows have  label-moulds over them, and the abaci of the capitals are carried  across the buttresses on either side as a string-course. By this means  the lines of the composition are continued horizontally,  notwithstanding the interruption by the openings in the walling. These  are now glazed as windows; but they were originally open, as some  bells once hung in the tower at this level.      [29] By the late J.L. Pearson, R.A., and completed by his son.    [Illustration: THE NORTH-EAST ANGLE OF THE SOUTH-WEST TOWER. _S.B.  Bolas & Co., photo_.]    The west end of the nave has six windows grouped in it above the  porch. The two upper ones are small and close up under the gable  coping. This latter is simply chamfered and capped with a modern  cross. The windows are arched in two orders. The inner order has a  plain, straight chamfered moulding; and the outer, a hollow chamfered  one. The label-mould and the capitals of the attached shafts in the  jambs are a little later in design than the windows themselves. A  moulded string-course separates the point of the large west window  from those above it; and from the level of this string-course up to  the coping of the gable the whole surface of the wall is covered with  a diagonal pattern of incised diapers.    The West Window is entirely modern, but copied from fourteenth-century  examples with some success. It has five divisions between the jambs  and mullions. The central one is larger than those on either side. The  upper part is filled with geometrical tracery.    Below the west window are three other windows grouped together. They  are at the triforium level, where they were probably inserted before  the middle of the thirteenth century; but they have been restored at  various times since then.    The #West Porch# is a comparatively simple structure. It rises from  the ground with a deep weathered base. At the top of the walls is a  plain weathered coping, which overhangs about one inch. The simple,  but extremely well designed, buttresses at the north and south angles  add much interest to it as a composition artistically and as a study  in structure. The small, straight buttresses on the west are only  weathered once, and this at the top; but those on the north and south  sides are different. There is a broad central buttress weathered twice  from the base to its top, and in the angle on either side of it are  what appear to be two lower, smaller buttresses, with one weathering  slope. The probability is that there was only a small buttress here at  first, and that the larger one on either side was added by being  built over the shallower, broader, and shorter one.    [Illustration: WALL-ARCADE IN THE WEST PORCH. _S.B. Bolas & Co.,  photo_.]    These buttresses have been placed here in order to counteract the  thrust of the large, deeply-set covering arch over the entrance to the  porch. This arch is of interest, as it has but a slight label; and  then the outside angle of the soffit only is moulded, the rest being  recessed both at the jambs and in the arch for about two feet, with no  mouldings at all. Then comes a delicately moulded arch in two orders,  immediately beneath which are the coupled arches which give entrance  to the interior, vaulted apartment. These two arches, the central and  side shafts on which they rest, as well as the tympanum between them,  are restorations.    The vault over the interior of the porch is carried on moulded  diagonal ribs. On the north, south, and west are wall ribs as well, to  carry the chalk filling between them. The insertion of two later  monuments, now much dilapidated, involved the destruction of much of  the beautiful wall arcades. These were of three complete divisions on  each wall, and have cusped heads. The upper part, below the finishing  horizontal string-course, is composed of two full and two half  quatrefoils. The work in each arcade is recessed quite seven inches  from the face of the general walling above; and the multiplied detail  in the mouldings is finely studied. Opposite the entrance is the west  doorway"]]]
