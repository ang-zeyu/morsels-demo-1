[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1265"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#10)"],[1,"Duchess of Kent was  given a suite of apartments entirely separate from the Queen's. By  Victoria herself the change was welcomed, though, at the moment of  departure, she could afford to be sentimental. \"Though I rejoice to go  into B. P. for many reasons,\" she wrote in her diary, \"it is not  without feelings of regret that I shall bid adieu for ever to this my  birthplace, where I have been born and bred, and to which I am really  attached!\" Her memory lingered for a moment over visions of the past:  her sister's wedding, pleasant balls and delicious concerts and there  were other recollections. \"I have gone through painful and disagreeable  scenes here, 'tis true,\" she concluded, \"but still I am fond of the poor  old palace.\"    At the same time she took another decided step. She had determined that  she would see no more of Sir John Conroy. She rewarded his past services  with liberality: he was given a baronetcy and a pension of L3000 a  year; he remained a member of the Duchess's household, but his personal  intercourse with the Queen came to an abrupt conclusion.    II    It was clear that these interior changes--whatever else they might  betoken--marked the triumph of one person--the Baroness Lehzen. The  pastor's daughter observed the ruin of her enemies. Discreet and  victorious, she remained in possession of the field. More closely than  ever did she cleave to the side of her mistress, her pupil, and her  friend; and in the recesses of the palace her mysterious figure was at  once invisible and omnipresent. When the Queen's Ministers came in  at one door, the Baroness went out by another; when they retired, she  immediately returned. Nobody knew--nobody ever will know--the precise  extent and the precise nature of her influence. She herself declared  that she never discussed public affairs with the Queen, that she was  concerned with private matters only--with private letters and the  details of private life. Certainly her hand is everywhere discernible in  Victoria's early correspondence. The Journal is written in the style of  a child; the Letters are not so simple; they are the work of a  child, rearranged--with the minimum of alteration, no doubt, and yet  perceptibly--by a governess. And the governess was no fool: narrow,  jealous, provincial, she might be; but she was an acute and vigorous  woman, who had gained by a peculiar insight, a peculiar ascendancy. That  ascendancy she meant to keep. No doubt it was true that technically she  took no part in public business; but the distinction between what is  public and what is private is always a subtle one; and in the case of  a reigning sovereign--as the next few years were to show--it is often  imaginary. Considering all things--the characters of the persons, and  the character of the times--it was something more than a mere matter  of private interest that the bedroom of Baroness Lehzen at Buckingham  Palace should have been next door to the bedroom of the Queen.    But the influence wielded by the Baroness, supreme as it seemed within  its own sphere, was not unlimited; there were other forces at work.  For one thing, the faithful Stockmar had taken up his residence in the  palace. During the twenty years which had elapsed since the death of the  Princess Charlotte, his experiences had been varied and remarkable. The  unknown counsellor of a disappointed princeling had gradually risen to a  position of European importance. His devotion to his master had been not  only whole--hearted but cautious and wise. It was Stockmar's advice  that had kept Prince Leopold in England during the critical years which  followed his wife's death, and had thus secured to him the essential  requisite of a point d'appui in the country of his adoption. It was  Stockmar's discretion which had smoothed over the embarrassments  surrounding the Prince's acceptance and rejection of the Greek crown.  It was Stockmar who had induced the Prince to become the constitutional  Sovereign of Belgium. Above all, it was Stockmar's tact, honesty, and  diplomatic skill which, through a long series of arduous and complicated  negotiations, had led to the guarantee of Belgian neutrality by the  Great Powers. His labours had been rewarded by a German barony and by  the complete confidence of King Leopold. Nor was it only in Brussels  that he was treated with respect and listened to with attention.  The statesmen who governed England--Lord Grey, Sir Robert Peel, Lord  Palmerston, Lord Melbourne--had learnt to put a high value upon his  probity and his intelligence. \"He is one of the cleverest fellows I  ever saw,\" said Lord Melbourne, \"the most discreet man, the most  well-judging, and most cool man.\" And Lord Palmerston cited Baron  Stockmar as the only absolutely disinterested man he had come across in  life, At last he was able to retire to Coburg, and to enjoy for a few  years the society of the wife and children whom his labours in the  service of his master had hitherto only allowed him to visit at long  intervals for a month or two at a time. But in 1836 he had been again  entrusted with an important negotiation, which he had brought to  a successful conclusion in the marriage of Prince Ferdinand of  Saxe-Coburg, a nephew of King Leopold's, with Queen Maria II of  Portugal. The House of Coburg was beginning to spread over Europe; and  the establishment of the Baron at Buckingham Palace in 1837 was to be  the prelude of another and a more momentous advance.    King Leopold and his counsellor provide in their careers an example  of the curious diversity of human ambitions. The desires of man are  wonderfully various; but no less various are the means by which those  desires may reach satisfaction: and so the work of the world gets done.  The correct mind of Leopold craved for the whole apparatus of royalty.  Mere power would have held no attractions for him; he must be an actual  king--the crowned head of a people. It was not enough to do; it was  essential also to be recognised; anything else would not be fitting.  The greatness that he dreamt of was surrounded by every appropriate  circumstance. To be a Majesty, to be a cousin of Sovereigns, to marry a  Bourbon for diplomatic ends, to correspond with the Queen of England,  to be very stiff and very punctual, to found a dynasty, to bore  ambassadresses into fits, to live, on the highest pinnacle, an exemplary  life devoted to the public service--such were his objects, and such,  in fact, were his achievements. The \"Marquis Peu-a-peu,\" as George IV  called him, had what he wanted. But this would never have been the case  if it had not happened that the ambition of Stockmar took a form exactly  complementary to his own. The sovereignty that the Baron sought for  was by no means obvious. The satisfaction of his essential being lay  in obscurity, in invisibility--in passing, unobserved, through a hidden  entrance, into the very central chamber of power, and in sitting there,  quietly, pulling the subtle strings that set the wheels of the  whole world in motion. A very few people, in very high places, and  exceptionally well-informed, knew that Baron Stockmar was a most  important person: that was enough. The fortunes of the master and the  servant, intimately interacting, rose together. The Baron's secret skill  had given Leopold his unexceptionable kingdom; and Leopold, in his turn,  as time went on, was able to furnish the Baron with more and more keys  to more and more back doors.    Stockmar took up his abode in the Palace partly as the emissary of King  Leopold, but more particularly as the friend and adviser of a queen who  was almost a child, and who, no doubt, would be much in need of advice  and friendship. For it would be a mistake to suppose that either of  these two men was actuated by a vulgar selfishness. The King, indeed,  was very well aware on which side his bread was buttered; during an  adventurous and chequered life he had acquired a shrewd knowledge of  the world's workings; and he was ready enough to use that knowledge  to strengthen his position and to spread his influence. But then, the  firmer his position and the wider his influence, the better for Europe;  of that he was quite certain. And besides, he was a constitutional  monarch; and it would be highly indecorous in a constitutional monarch  to have any aims that were low or personal.    As for Stockmar, the disinterestedness which Palmerston had noted was  undoubtedly a basic element in his character. The ordinary schemer is  always an optimist; and Stockmar, racked by dyspepsia and haunted by  gloomy forebodings, was a constitutionally melancholy man. A schemer, no  doubt, he was; but he schemed distrustfully, splenetically, to do good.  To do good! What nobler end could a man scheme for? Yet it is perilous  to scheme at all.    With Lehzen to supervise every detail of her conduct, with Stockmar in  the next room, so full of wisdom and experience of affairs, with her  Uncle Leopold's letters, too, pouring out so constantly their stream of  encouragements, general reflections, and highly valuable tips, Victoria,  even had she been without other guidance, would have stood in no lack of  private counsellor. But other guidance she had; for all these influences  paled before a new star, of the first magnitude, which, rising suddenly  upon her horizon, immediately dominated her life.    III    William Lamb, Viscount Melbourne, was fifty-eight years of age, and  had been for the last three years Prime Minister of England. In every  outward respect he was one of the most fortunate of mankind. He had  been born into the midst of riches, brilliance, and power. His mother,  fascinating and intelligent, had been a great Whig hostess, and he had  been bred up as a member of that radiant society which, during the  last quarter of the eighteenth century, concentrated within itself  the ultimate perfections of a hundred years of triumphant aristocracy.

If the developer is well rinsed out of the  film, the exposure to artificial light necessary to make a print  will have no injurious effect upon the negative, which is, of  course, later fixed and washed as usual.        ** Flower-Pot Stand [33]    A very useful stand for flower pots can be made of a piece of  board supported by four clothes hooks. The top may be of any size  suitable for the flower pot. The hooks which serve as legs are  fastened to the under side of the board in the same manner as  fastening the hook to a wall.  --Contributed by Oliver S. Sprout, Harrisburg, Pa.    [Illustration: Flower-pot Stand]        ** A Line Harmonograph  [34]    [Illustration: Harmonograph]    As an apparatus capable of exciting interest, probably nothing so  easily constructed surpasses the harmonograph. Your attention will  be completely absorbed in the ever changing, graceful sweep of the  long pendulum, the gyrations of which are faithfully recorded in  the resulting harmonogram.    A careless impetus given to the pendulum may result in a very  beautiful harmonogram, but you may try innumerable times to  duplicate this chance record without success. No two hamonograms  are exactly alike. The harmonograph, while its pendulum swings in  accordance with well known natural laws, is exceedingly erratic  when it comes to obeying any preconceived calculations of its  operator. In this uncertainty lies the charm. If time hangs  heavily or a person is slightly nervous or uneasy, a harmonograph  is a good prescription.    The prime essential in a well working harmonograph is a properly  constructed universal joint. Where such a joint is made with  pivots for its bearings, one pair of pivots are very liable to  have more friction than the other, which retards the movement and  causes the harmonograph to undergo a continuous change of axis. To  obviate this difficulty, the joint should be made similar to those  used on scales. The general appearance of such a joint is shown in  the first illustration, Fig. 1. Stirrups A and B are made of 7/8  by 1/4-in. metal. Holes are drilled in each end of these stirrups  and filed out as shown at C. The two holes shown in the center of  the stirrup A are drilled to fasten the apparatus to the ceiling.  Two corresponding holes are drilled in B to fasten the long  pendulum F to the joint. The cross of the joint D has the ends  shaped as shown at E. The rounded shoulder on E is to prevent the  cross from becoming displaced by a jar or accident. The ends of  the cross are inserted through the holes C of the stirrups, then  slipped back so the knife edges engage in the V-shaped holes of  the stirrups. The cross must be so made that the knife edges will  be in the same plane. This can be determined by placing two of the  knife edges on the jaws of a vise and then laying two rules across  the other two edges. The rules should just touch the jaws of the  vise and the two knife edges of the cross. This makes a universal  joint almost free from friction and, what is most important,  prevents the pendulum from twisting on its own axis.    The pendulum F should be made of ash or oak, 1-3/4 by 2 in., with  a length depending on the height of the ceiling. A length of 7 ft.  is about right for a 10-ft. ceiling.    A small table or platform, K, as shown in the lower part of Fig.  1, is fastened to the lower end of the pendulum as a support for  the cards on which harmonograms are made. A weight, G, of about 30  or 40 lb.-a box filled with small weights will do--is attached to  the pendulum just above the table. Another weight of about 10 lb.  is attached as shown at H. A pedestal, J, provides a means of  support for the stylus. The stylus arm should have pin-point  bearings, to prevent any side motion.    The length of the short pendulum H, which can be regulated, as  shown in Fig. 1, should bear a certain and exactly fixed relation  to the length of the main pendulum, for the swinging times of  pendulums are inversely proportionate to their lengths, and unless  the shorter pendulum is, for instance, exactly one-third,  one-fourth, one-fifth, etc., as long as the other, that is, makes  respectively 3, 4 or 5 swings to one swing of the long pendulum,  they will not harmonize and a perfect harmonogram is not obtained.    A good stylus to contain the ink is easily made from a glass tube  1/4 in. in diameter. Heat the tube in an alcohol or Bunsen flame  and then, by drawing the two portions apart and twisting at the  same time, the tube may be drawn to a sharp point. An opening of  any desired size is made in the point by rubbing it on a  whetstone. Owing to the fact that the style of universal joint  described has so little friction, the stylus point must be very    [Illustration: Lines Made with the Harmonograph]    fine, or the lines will overlap and blur. A small weight, such as  a shoe buttoner, placed on the arm near the stylus will cause  enough friction to make the pendulum \"die\" faster and thus remedy  the trouble.  --Contributed by Wm. R.

To saw and file it out  takes time and skill. Holes up to 3 in. in diameter can be cut  quickly and accurately with an ordinary expansive bit.    Fasten the sheet metal to a block of wood with handscrews or a  vise. Punch a hole, with a nail set or punch, in the center of the  circle to be cut, large enough to receive the spur of the  expansive bit. A few turns of the brace will cut out the circle  and leave a smooth edge.  --Contributed by James T.

These quarters are subsequently divided into any convenient number  of rectangular parts-six in this case.    These parts are numbered from one to six in each quarter beginning  at the outside corners and following in the same order in each  quarter. Cut out one rectangle of each number with a sharp knife,  distributing them over the whole card. Then put a prominent figure  1 at the top of one side, 2 at the bottom and 3 and 4 on the other  side. The numbering and the cutouts are    [Illustration: The Key Card]    shown in Fig. 1. The two key cards are made alike.    The key card is used by placing it over a postal with the figure 1  at the top and writing in the spaces from left to right as usual,  Fig. 3, then put 2 at the top, Fig. 4, and proceed as before, then  3 as in Fig. 5, and 4 as in Fig. 6. The result will be a jumble of  words as shown in Fig. 2, which cannot be read to make any sense  except by use of a key card.  --Contributed by W.J.

The wedge is worked by a string passing through the top of the  bench and should be weighted on the other end to facilitate the  automatic downward movement.    The capacity of the vise, of course, depends on the size and shape  of the wedge-shaped block.  --Contributed by J.H.
