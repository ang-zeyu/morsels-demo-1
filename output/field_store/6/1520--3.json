Moral philosophy, or the science of human nature, may be treated  after two different manners; each of which has its peculiar merit, and  may contribute to the entertainment, instruction, and reformation of  mankind. The one considers man chiefly as born for action; and as  influenced in his measures by taste and sentiment; pursuing one object,  and avoiding another, according to the value which these objects seem to  possess, and according to the light in which they present themselves. As  virtue, of all objects, is allowed to be the most valuable, this species  of philosophers paint her in the most amiable colours; borrowing all  helps from poetry and eloquence, and treating their subject in an easy  and obvious manner, and such as is best fitted to please the  imagination, and engage the affections. They select the most striking  observations and instances from common life; place opposite characters  in a proper contrast; and alluring us into the paths of virtue by the  views of glory and happiness, direct our steps in these paths by the  soundest precepts and most illustrious examples. They make us _feel_ the  difference between vice and virtue; they excite and regulate our  sentiments; and so they can but bend our hearts to the love of probity  and true honour, they think, that they have fully attained the end of  all their labours.    2. The other species of philosophers consider man in the light of a  reasonable rather than an active being, and endeavour to form his  understanding more than cultivate his manners. They regard human nature  as a subject of speculation; and with a narrow scrutiny examine it, in  order to find those principles, which regulate our understanding, excite  our sentiments, and make us approve or blame any particular object,  action, or behaviour. They think it a reproach to all literature, that  philosophy should not yet have fixed, beyond controversy, the foundation  of morals, reasoning, and criticism; and should for ever talk of truth  and falsehood, vice and virtue, beauty and deformity, without being able  to determine the source of these distinctions. While they attempt this  arduous task, they are deterred by no difficulties; but proceeding from  particular instances to general principles, they still push on their  enquiries to principles more general, and rest not satisfied till they  arrive at those original principles, by which, in every science, all  human curiosity must be bounded. Though their speculations seem  abstract, and even unintelligible to common readers, they aim at the  approbation of the learned and the wise; and think themselves  sufficiently compensated for the labour of their whole lives, if they  can discover some hidden truths, which may contribute to the instruction  of posterity.    3. It is certain that the easy and obvious philosophy will always, with  the generality of mankind, have the preference above the accurate and  abstruse; and by many will be recommended, not only as more agreeable,  but more useful than the other. It enters more into common life; moulds  the heart and affections; and, by touching those principles which  actuate men, reforms their conduct, and brings them nearer to that model  of perfection which it describes. On the contrary, the abstruse  philosophy, being founded on a turn of mind, which cannot enter into  business and action, vanishes when the philosopher leaves the shade, and  comes into open day; nor can its principles easily retain any influence  over our conduct and behaviour. The feelings of our heart, the agitation  of our passions, the vehemence of our affections, dissipate all its  conclusions, and reduce the profound philosopher to a mere plebeian.    4. This also must be confessed, that the most durable, as well as  justest fame, has been acquired by the easy philosophy, and that  abstract reasoners seem hitherto to have enjoyed only a momentary  reputation, from the caprice or ignorance of their own age, but have not  been able to support their renown with more equitable posterity. It is  easy for a profound philosopher to commit a mistake in his subtile  reasonings; and one mistake is the necessary parent of another, while he  pushes on his consequences, and is not deterred from embracing any  conclusion, by its unusual appearance, or its contradiction to popular  opinion. But a philosopher, who purposes only to represent the common  sense of mankind in more beautiful and more engaging colours, if by  accident he falls into error, goes no farther; but renewing his appeal  to common sense, and the natural sentiments of the mind, returns into  the right path, and secures himself from any dangerous illusions. The  fame of Cicero flourishes at present; but that of Aristotle is utterly  decayed. La Bruyere passes the seas, and still maintains his reputation:  But the glory of Malebranche is confined to his own nation, and to his  own age. And Addison, perhaps, will be read with pleasure, when Locke  shall be entirely forgotten.    The mere philosopher is a character, which is commonly but little  acceptable in the world, as being supposed to contribute nothing either  to the advantage or pleasure of society; while he lives remote from  communication with mankind, and is wrapped up in principles and notions  equally remote from their comprehension. On the other hand, the mere  ignorant is still more despised; nor is any thing deemed a surer sign of  an illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences flourish,  than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble  entertainments. The most perfect character is supposed to lie between  those extremes; retaining an equal ability and taste for books, company,  and business; preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy  which arise from polite letters; and in business, that probity and  accuracy which are the natural result of a just philosophy. In order to  diffuse and cultivate so accomplished a character, nothing can be more  useful than compositions of the easy style and manner, which draw not  too much from life, require no deep application or retreat to be  comprehended, and send back the student among mankind full of noble  sentiments and wise precepts, applicable to every exigence of human  life. By means of such compositions, virtue becomes amiable, science  agreeable, company instructive, and retirement entertaining.    Man is a reasonable being; and as such, receives from science his proper  food and nourishment: But so narrow are the bounds of human  understanding, that little satisfaction can be hoped for in this  particular, either from the extent of security or his acquisitions. Man  is a sociable, no less than a reasonable being: But neither can he  always enjoy company agreeable and amusing, or preserve the proper  relish for them. Man is also an active being; and from that disposition,  as well as from the various necessities of human life, must submit to  business and occupation: But the mind requires some relaxation, and  cannot always support its bent to care and industry. It seems, then,  that nature has pointed out a mixed kind of life as most suitable to the  human race, and secretly admonished them to allow none of these biasses  to _draw_ too much, so as to incapacitate them for other occupations and  entertainments. Indulge your passion for science, says she, but let your  science be human, and such as may have a direct reference to action and  society. Abstruse thought and profound researches I prohibit, and will  severely punish, by the pensive melancholy which they introduce, by the  endless uncertainty in which they involve you, and by the cold reception  which your pretended discoveries shall meet with, when communicated. Be  a philosopher; but, amidst all your philosophy, be still a man.    5. Were the generality of mankind contented to prefer the easy  philosophy to the abstract and profound, without throwing any blame or  contempt on the latter, it might not be improper, perhaps, to comply  with this general opinion, and allow every man to enjoy, without  opposition, his own taste and sentiment. But as the matter is often  carried farther, even to the absolute rejecting of all profound  reasonings, or what is commonly called _metaphysics_, we shall now  proceed to consider what can reasonably be pleaded in their behalf.    We may begin with observing, that one considerable advantage, which  results from the accurate and abstract philosophy, is, its subserviency  to the easy and humane; which, without the former, can never attain a  sufficient degree of exactness in its sentiments, precepts, or  reasonings. All polite letters are nothing but pictures of human life in  various attitudes and situations; and inspire us with different  sentiments, of praise or blame, admiration or ridicule, according to the  qualities of the object, which they set"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9666"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 497, July 11, 1885 (#1)"],[1,"PG Distributed Proofreaders                      [Illustration]          SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT NO. 497          NEW YORK, JULY 11, 1885    Scientific American Supplement.

Foundations in quicksand often have to be built in places where least  expected, and sometimes the writer has been able to conveniently  span the vein with an arch and avoid trouble; but where it cannot be  conveniently arched over, it will be necessary to sheath pile for a  trench and lay in broad sections of concrete until the space is crossed,  the sheath piling being drawn and reset in sections as fast as the  trenches are leveled up. The piling is left in permanently if it is not  wanted again for use.    Sometimes these bottoms are too soft to be treated in this manner; in  that case boxes or caissons are formed, loaded with stone and sunk into  place with pig iron until the weight they are to carry is approximated.  When settled, the weights are removed and building begins.    Foundations on shifting sand are met with in banks of streams, which  swell and become rapids as each winter breaks up. This kind is most  troublesome and dangerous to rest upon if not properly treated.    Retaining walls are frequently built season after season, and as  regularly become undermined by the scouring of the water. Regular  docking with piles and timbers is resorted to, but it is so expensive  for small works that it is not often tried.    Foundations are formed often with rock well planted out; and again  success has attended the use of bags of sand where rough rock was not  convenient or too expensive.    In such cases it is well to try a mattress foundation, which may be  formed of brushwood and small saplings with butts from 1/2 inch to  21/2 inches in diameter, compressed into bundles from 8 to 12 inches  diameter, and from 12 to 16 feet long, and well tied with ropes every  four feet. Other bundles, from 4 to 6 inches diameter and 16 feet long,  are used as binders, and these bundles are now cross-woven and make a  good network, the long parts protruding and making whip ends. One or  more sets of netting are used as necessity seems to require. This kind  of foundation may be filled in with a concrete of hydraulic cement and  sand, and the walls built on them with usual footings, and it is very  durable, suiting the purpose as well as anything we have seen or heard  of.--_Inland Architect_.           *       *       *       *       *          LIFT BRIDGE OVER THE OURCQ CANAL.      This bridge, which was inaugurated in 1868, was constructed under the  direction of Mr. Mantion, then engineer-in-chief of the Belt Railway.  Fig. 1 shows the bridge raised.    The solution adopted in this case was the only feasible one that  presented itself, in view of the slight difference between the level  of the railway tracks and the maximum plane of the canal water. This  circumstance did not even permit of a thought of an ordinary revolving  bridge, since this, on a space of 10 inches being reserved between the  level of the water and the bottom of the bridge, and on giving the  latter a minimum thickness of 33 inches up to the level of the rails,  would have required the introduction into the profile of the railroad  of approaches of at least one-quarter inch gradient, that would have  interfered with operations at the station close by.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--LIFT BRIDGE OVER THE OURCQ CANAL.]    Besides, in the case of a revolving bridge, since the bottom of the  latter would be but ten inches above the water level, and the rollers  would have to be of larger diameter than that, it would have been  necessary to suppose the roller channel placed beneath the level of the  water, and it would consequently have been necessary to isolate this  channel from the canal by a tight wall. The least fissure in the latter  would have inundated the channel.    As the Ourcq Canal had no regular period of closing, it was necessary  to construct the bridge without hinderance to navigation. The idea of  altering the canal's course could not be thought of, for the proximity  of the fortifications and of the bridge over the military road was  opposed to it. Moreover, the canal administration insisted upon a free  width of 26 feet, which is that of the sluices of the St. Denis Canal,  and which would have led to the projection of a revolving bridge of 28  feet actual opening in order to permit of building foundations with  caissons in such a way as to leave a passageway of 26 feet during  operations.    For these reasons it was decided to construct a metallic bridge that  should be lifted by means of counterpoises and balanced after the manner  of gasometers.    The free width secured to navigation is 28 feet. The bridge is usually  kept raised to a height of 16 feet above the level of the water in order  to allow boats to pass (Fig. 2). In this position it is balanced by four  counterpoises suspended from the extremities of chains that pass over  pulleys. These counterpoises are of cast iron, and weigh, altogether,  44,000 pounds--the weight of the bridge to be balanced, say 11,000  pounds per counterpoise. Moreover, each of the four chains is prolonged  beneath the corresponding counterpoise by a chain of the same weight,  called a compensating chain.    The pulleys, B and C, that support the suspension chains have  projections in their channels which engage with the links and thus  prevent the chains from slipping. They are mounted at the extremity of  four latticed girders that likewise carry girder pulleys, D. The pulleys  that are situated at the side of the bridge are provided laterally  with a conical toothing which gears with a pinion connected with the  maneuvering apparatus.    The two pinions of the same side of the bridge are keyed to a  longitudinal shaft which is set in motion at one point of its length by  a system of gearings. The winch upon which is exerted the stress that  is to effect the lifting or the descent of the bridge is fixed upon the  shaft of the pinion of the said gearing, which is also provided with a  flywheel, c. The longitudinal shafts are connected by a transverse one.  e, which renders the two motions interdependent. This transverse shaft  is provided with collars, against which bear stiff rods that give it the  aspect of an elongated spindle, and that permit it to resist twisting  stresses.    The windlasses that lift the bridge are actuated by manual power. Two  men (or even one) suffice to do the maneuvering.    This entire collection of pulleys and mechanism is established upon two  brick foot bridges between which the bridge moves. These arched bridges  offer no obstruction to navigation. Moreover, they always allow free  passage to foot passengers, whatever be the position of the bridge. They  are provided with four vertical apertures to the right of the suspension  chains, in order to allow of the passage of the latter. The girders that  support the pulleys rest at one extremity upon the upper part of the  bridges, and at the other upon solid brick pillars with stone caps.    Finally, in order to render the descent of the bridge easier, there are  added to it two water tanks that are filled from the station reservoir  when the bridge is in its upper position, and that empty themselves  automatically as soon as it reaches the level of the railroad tracks.    A very simple system of fastening has been devised for keeping the  bridge in a stationary position when raised. When it reaches the end of  its upward travel, four bolts engage with an aperture in the suspension  rod and prevent it from descending. These bolts are set in motion by  two connecting rods carried by a longitudinal shaft and maneuvered by a  lever at the end of the windlass.    At the lower part the bridge rests upon iron plates set into sills. It  is guided in its descent longitudinally by iron plates that have an"]]]
