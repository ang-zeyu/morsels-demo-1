So, after a prolonged struggle,  Minghino wrested the girl from Giannole, and set her again in Giacomino's  house. Nor were the combatants separated before the officers of the  Governor of the city came up and arrested not a few of them; among them  Minghino and Giannole and Crivello, whom they marched off to prison.  However, peace being restored and Giacomino returned, 'twas with no  little chagrin that he heard of the affair; but finding upon  investigation that the girl was in no wise culpable, he was somewhat  reassured; and determined, lest the like should again happen, to bestow  the girl in marriage as soon as might be.    On the morrow the kinsfolk of the two lovers, having learned the truth of  the matter, and knowing what evil might ensue to the captives, if  Giacomino should be minded to take the course which he reasonably might,  came and gave him good words, beseeching him to let the kindly feeling,  the love, which they believed he bore to them, his suppliants, count for  more with him than the wrong that the hare-brained gallants had done him,  and on their part and their own offering to make any amend that he might  require. Giacomino, who had seen many things in his time, and lacked not  sound sense, made answer briefly:--\"Gentlemen, were I in my own country,  as I am in yours, I hold myself in such sort your friend that nought  would I do in this matter, or in any other, save what might be agreeable  to you: besides which, I have the more reason to consider your wishes,  because 'tis against you yourselves that you have offended, inasmuch as  this damsel, whatever many folk may suppose, is neither of Cremona nor of  Pavia, but is of Faenza, albeit neither I nor she, nor he from whom I had  her, did ever wot whose daughter she was: wherefore, touching that you  ask of me, I will even do just as you bid me.\" The worthy men found it  passing strange that the girl should be of Faenza; and having thanked  Giacomino for his handsome answer, they besought him that he would be  pleased to tell them how she had come into his hands, and how he knew  that she was of Faenza. To whom Giacomino replied on this wise:--\"A  comrade and friend I had, Guidotto da Cremona, who, being at the point of  death, told me that, when this city of Faenza was taken by the Emperor  Frederic, he and his comrades, entering one of the houses during the  sack, found there good store of booty, and never a soul save this girl,  who, being two years old or thereabouts, greeted him as father as he came  up the stairs; wherefore he took pity on her, and carried her with  whatever else was in the house away with him to Fano; where on his  deathbed he left her to me, charging me in due time to bestow her in  marriage, and give her all his goods and chattels by way of dowry: but,  albeit she is now of marriageable age, I have not been able to provide  her with a husband to my mind; though right glad should I be to do so,  that nought like the event of yesterday may again befall me.\"    Now among the rest of those present was one Guglielmo da Medicina, who  had been with Guidotto on that occasion, and knew well whose house it was  that Guidotto had sacked; and seeing the owner there among the rest, he  went up to him, and said:--\"Dost hear, Bernabuccio, what Giacomino says?\"  \"Ay,\" answered Bernabuccio, \"and I gave the more heed thereto, for that I  call to mind that during those disorders I lost a little daughter of just  the age that Giacomino speaks of.\" \"'Tis verily she then,\" said  Guglielmo, \"for once when I was with Guidotto I heard him describe what  house it was that he had sacked, and I wist that 'twas thine. Wherefore  search thy memory if there be any sign by which thou thinkest to  recognize her, and let her be examined that thou mayst be assured that  she is thy daughter.\" So Bernabuccio pondered a while, and then  recollected that she ought to have a scar, shewing like a tiny cross,  above her left ear, being where he had excised a tumour a little while  before that affair: wherefore without delay he went up to Giacomino, who  was still there, and besought him to let him go home with him and see the  damsel. Giacomino gladly did so, and no sooner was the girl brought into  Bernabuccio's presence, than, as he beheld her, 'twas as if he saw the  face of her mother, who was still a beautiful woman. However, he would  not rest there, but besought Giacomino of his grace to permit him to lift  a lock or two of hair above her left ear; whereto Giacomino consented. So  Bernabuccio approached her where she stood somewhat shamefast, and with  his right hand lifted her locks, and, seeing the cross, wist that in very  truth she was his daughter, and tenderly wept and embraced her, albeit  she withstood him; and then, turning to Giacomino, he said:--\"My brother,  the girl is my daughter; 'twas my house that Guidotto sacked, and so  sudden was the assault that my wife, her mother, forgot her, and we have  always hitherto supposed, that, my house being burned that same day, she  perished in the flames.\" Catching his words, and seeing that he was  advanced in years, the girl inclined to believe him, and impelled by some  occult instinct, suffered his embraces, and melting, mingled her tears  with his. Bernabuccio forthwith sent for her mother and her sisters and  other kinswomen and her brothers, and having shewn her to them all, and  told the story, after they had done her great cheer and embraced her a  thousand times, to Giacomino's no small delight, he brought her home with  him. Which coming to the ears of the Governor of the city, the worthy  man, knowing that Giannole, whom he had in ward, was Bernabuccio's son  and the girl's brother, made up his mind to deal leniently with Giannole:  wherefore he took upon himself the part of mediator in the affair, and  having made peace between Bernabuccio and Giacomino and Giannole and  Minghino, gave Agnesa--such was the damsel's name--to Minghino to wife,  to the great delight of all Minghino's kinsfolk, and set at liberty not  only Giannole and Minghino but Crivello, and the others their  confederates in the affair. Whereupon Minghino with the blithest of  hearts wedded Agnesa with all due pomp and circumstance, and brought her  home, where for many a year thereafter he lived with her in peace and  prosperity.      NOVEL VI.    --  Gianni di Procida, being found with a damsel that he loves, and who had  been given to King Frederic, is bound with her to a stake, so to be  burned. He is recognized by Ruggieri dell' Oria, is delivered, and  marries her.  --    Neifile's story, with which the ladies were greatly delighted, being  ended, the queen called for one from Pampinea; who forthwith raised her  noble countenance, and thus began:--Mighty indeed, gracious ladies, are  the forces of Love, and great are the labours and excessive and unthought  of the perils which they induce lovers to brave; as is manifest enough by  what we have heard to-day and on other occasions: howbeit I mean to shew  you the same once more by a story of an enamoured youth.    Hard by Naples is the island of Ischia, in which there dwelt aforetime  with other young damsels one, Restituta by name, daughter of one Marin  Bolgaro, a gentleman of the island. Very fair was she, and blithe of  heart, and by a young gallant, Gianni by name, of the neighbouring islet  of Procida, was beloved more dearly than life, and in like measure  returned his love. Now, not to mention his daily resort to Ischia to see  her, there were times not a few when Gianni, not being able to come by a  boat, would swim across from Procida by night, that he might have sight,  if of nought else, at least of the walls of her house. And while their  love burned thus fervently, it so befell that one summer's day, as the  damsel was all alone on the seashore, picking her way from rock to rock,  detaching, as she went, shells from their beds with a knife, she came to  a recess among the rocks, where for the sake, as well of the shade as of  the comfort afforded by a spring of most cool water that was there, some  Sicilian gallants, that were come from Naples, had put in with their  felucca. Who, having taken note of the damsel, that she was very fair,  and that she was not yet ware of them, and was alone, resolved to capture  her, and carry her away; nor did they fail to give effect to their  resolve; but, albeit she shrieked amain, they laid hands on her, and set  her aboard their boat, and put to sea. Arrived at Calabria, they fell a  wrangling as to whose the damsel should be, and in brief each claimed her  for his own: wherefore, finding no means of coming to an agreement, and  fearing that worse might befall them, and she bring misfortune upon them,  they resolved with one accord to give her to Frederic, King of Sicily,  who was then a young man, and took no small delight in commodities of  that quality; and so, being come to Palermo, they did.    Marking her beauty, the King set great store by her; but as she was  somewhat indisposed, he commanded that, till she was stronger, she should  be lodged and tended in a very pretty villa that was in one of his  gardens, which he called Cuba; and so 'twas done. The purloining of the  damsel caused no small stir in Ischia, more especially because 'twas  impossible to discover by whom she had been carried off. But Gianni, more  concerned than any other, despairing of finding her in Ischia, and being  apprised of the course the felucca had taken, equipped one himself, and  put to sea, and in hot haste scoured the whole coast from Minerva to  Scalea in Calabria, making everywhere diligent search for the damsel, and  in Scalea learned that she had been taken by Sicilian mariners to  Palermo.

A great controversy ensued in  France; popular imagination was stirred up especially in the republic by  the doctrine of Gall, which was an attempt to materialise and localise  psychic processes. Unfortunately Gall's imagination, encouraged by a  widespread wave of popular sympathy, overstepped his judgment and launched  him into speculative hypotheses unsupported by facts. His doctrine of  Phrenology was shown to be absolutely illogical; consequently it was  forgotten that he was the pioneer of cerebral localisation.          SPEECH AND RIGHT-HANDEDNESS      The next step in Cerebral Localisation was made by a French physician, Marc  Dax, who first observed that disease of the left half of the cerebrum  producing paralysis of the right half of the body (right hemiplegia) was  associated with loss of articulate speech. This observation led to the  establishment of a most important fact in connection with speech, viz. that  right-handed people use their left cerebral hemisphere as the executive  portion of the brain in speech. Subsequently it was shown that when  left-handed people were paralysed on the left side by disease of the right  hemisphere, they lost their powers of speech. But the great majority of  people are born right-handed, consequently the right hand being especially  the instrument of the mind in the majority of people, the left hemisphere  is the leading hemisphere; and since probably specialisation of function of  the right hand (dexterity) has been so closely associated with that other  instrument of the mind, the vocal instrument of articulate speech, the two  have now become inseparable; for are not graphic signs and verbal signs  intimately interwoven in the development of language and human  intelligence?    What has determined the predominance of the left hemisphere in speech? I  can find no adequate anatomical explanation. There is no difference in  weight of the two hemispheres in normal brains. Moreover, I am unable to  subscribe to the opinion that there is any evidence to show that the left  hemisphere receives a larger supply of blood than the right. Another theory  advanced to explain localisation of speech and right-handedness in the left  hemisphere is that the heavier organs, lung and liver, being on the right  side have determined a mechanical advantage which has led to  right-handedness in the great majority of people. This theory has, however,  been disposed of by the fact that cases in which there has been a complete  transposition of the viscera have not been left-handed in a larger  proportion of cases. The great majority of people, modern and ancient,  civilised and uncivilised, use the right hand by preference. Even graphic  representations on the sun-baked clay records of Assyria, and the drawings  on rocks, tusks, and horns of animals of the flint-weapon men of  prehistoric times show that man was then right-handed. There is a  difference of opinion whether anthropoid apes use the right hand in  preference to the left. Professor Cunningham, who made a special study of  this subject, asserts that they use either hand indifferently; so also does  the infant at first, and the idiot in a considerable number of cases. Then  why should man, even primitive, have chosen the right hand as the  instrument of the mind? Seeing that there is no apparent anatomical reason,  we may ask ourselves the question: Is it the result of an acquired useful  habit to which anatomical conditions may subsequently have contributed as a  co-efficient? Primitive man depended largely upon gesture language, and the  placing of the hand over the heart is universally understood to signify  love and fidelity. Uneducated deaf mutes, whose only means of communicating  with their fellow-men is by gestures, not only use this sign, but imply  hatred also by holding the hand over the heart accompanied by the sign of  negation. Moreover, pointing to the heart accompanied by a cry of pain or  joy would indicate respectively death of an enemy or friend. Again,  primitive man protected himself from the weapons of his enemies by holding  the shield in his left hand, thus covering the heart and leaving the right  hand free to wield his spear. The question whether it would have been to  his advantage to use either hand indifferently for spear and shield has  been, to my mind, solved by the fact that in the long procession of ages  evolution has determined right-handed specialisation as being more  advantageous to the progress of mankind than ambidexterity.  Right-handedness is an inherited character in the same sense as the  potential power of speech.          LOCALISATION OF SPEECH CENTRES IN THE BRAIN      In 1863 Broca showed the importance in all right-handed people (that is in  about ninety-five per cent of all human beings) of the third _left_ frontal  convolution for speech (_vide_ figs. 16 and 17); when this is destroyed by  disease, although the patient can understand what is said and can  understand written and printed language, the power of articulate speech is  lost. _Motor Aphasia_. This portion of the brain is concerned with the  revival of the motor images, and has been termed by Dr. Bastian \"the  glosso-kinaesthetic centre,\" or the cortical grey matter, in which the  images of the sense of movement of the lips and tongue are formed (_vide_  fig. 17). A destruction of a similar portion of the cortex in a  right-handed person produces no loss of speech; but if the person is  left-handed there is aphasia, because he, being left-handed, uses the third  _right_ inferior frontal convolution for speech. These facts have for long  been accepted by most neurologists, but recently doubts have been cast upon  this fundamental principle of cerebral localisation by a most distinguished  French neurologist, M. Marie; he has pointed out that a destructive lesion  of the cortex may be accompanied by subcortical damage, which interrupts  fibres coming from other parts of the brain connected with speech.    In the study of speech defects it is useful to employ a diagram; a certain  part of the brain corresponds to the _Speech Zone_ there indicated, and  lesions injuring any part of this area in the left hemisphere cause speech  defects (_vide_ fig. 17). All neurologists, M. Marie included, admit this,  and the whole question therefore is: Is a destruction of certain limited  regions of the superficial grey matter the cause of different forms of  speech defects, or are they not due more to the destruction of subcortical  systems of fibres, which lie beneath this cortical speech zone?    There is a certain portion of the speech zone which is assumed to be  connected with the revival of written or printed language, and is called  the _visual word-centre_. There is another region connected with the memory  of spoken words--the _auditory word-centre_; you will observe that it is  situated in the posterior third of the first temporal convolution, but this  does not comprise nearly the whole of it, for there is an extensive surface  of grey matter lying unseen within the fissure, called the transverse  convolutions, or gyri. Lesions of either of these regions give rise to  _Sensory Aphasia_, which means a loss of speech due to inability to revive  in memory the articulate sounds which serve as verbal symbols, or the  graphic signs which serve as visual symbols for language.    [Illustration: FIG. 17]    [Description: FIG. 17.--Diagram to illustrate the Speech Zone of the left  hemisphere (Bastian). This scheme is used to explain the mechanism of  speech, but probably the centres are not precisely limited, as shown in the  diagram; it serves, however, to explain disorders of speech. Destruction of  the brain substance in front of the central fissure gives rise to what is  termed Motor Aphasia and Motor Agraphia, because the patient no longer  recalls the images of the movements necessary for expressing himself in  articulate speech or by writing. Destructive lesions behind the central  fissure may damage the portion of the brain connected with the mental  perception of the sounds of articulate language, or the portion of the  brain connected with the mental perception of language in the form of  printed or written words--Sensory Aphasia; the former entails inability to  speak, the latter inability to read.    This speech zone acts as a whole, and many disorders of speech may arise  from destructive lesions within its limits. It has a special arterial  supply, viz. the middle cerebral, which divides into two main branches--an  anterior, which supplies the motor portion, and a posterior, which supplies  the posterior sensory portion. The anterior divides into two branches and  the posterior into three branches, consequently various limited portions of  the speech zone may be deprived of blood supply by blocking of one of these  branches. The speech zone of the left hemisphere directly controls the  centres in the medulla oblongata that preside over articulation and  phonation; innervation currents are represented by the arrows coming from  the higher to the lower centres.]    These several cortical regions are connected by systems of subcortical  fibres to two regions in front of the ascending frontal convolution (_vide_  fig. 17), called respectively the \"glosso-kinaesthetic\" (sense of movement  of tongue) and the \"cheiro-kinaesthetic\" (sense of movement of hand) centres.  Now a person may become hemiplegic and lose his speech owing either to the  blood clotting in a diseased vessel, or to detachment of a small clot from  the heart, which, swept into the circulation, may plug one of the arteries  of the brain. The arteries branch and supply different regions,  consequently a limited portion of the great brain may undergo destruction,  giving rise to certain localising symptoms, according to the situation of  the area which has been deprived of its blood supply.
