Each touched it and then  sprang away. Finally one, his eyes starting from his head,  cautiously stroked the inoffensive brick and then licked his  fingers. The effect was instantaneous. He assured the others it was  \"good chop,\" and each of them sat hunched about it on his heels,  stroking it, and licking his fingers, and then with delighted  thrills rubbing them over his naked body. The little block of ice  that at Liverpool was only a \"quart of water\" had assumed the value  of a diamond.    Dinner was enlivened by an incident. Mr. Weekes, with orders simply  to \"fry these,\" had given to the assistant of the cook two tins of  sausages. The small _chef_ presented them to us in the pan in which  he had cooked them, but he had obeyed instructions to the letter and  had fried the tins unopened.    After dinner we sat until late, while the older men told the young  missionaries of atrocities of which, in the twenty years and within  the last three years, they had been witnesses. Already in Mr.  Morel's books I had read their testimony, but hearing from the men  themselves the tales of outrage and cruelty gave them a fresh and  more intimate value, and sent me to bed hot and sick with  indignation. But, nevertheless, the night I slept at Thysville was  the only cool one I knew in the Congo. It was as cool as is a night  in autumn at home. Thysville, between the Upper and the Lower Congo,  with its fresh mountain air, is an obvious site for a hospital for  the servants of the State. To the Congo it should be what Simla is  to the sick men of India; but the State is not running hospitals. It  is in the rubber business.    All steamers for the Upper Congo and her great tributaries, whether  they belong to the State or the Missions, start from Leopoldville.  There they fit out for voyages, some of which last three and four  months. So it is a place of importance, but, like Boma, it looks as  though the people who yesterday built it meant to-morrow to move  out. The river-front is one long dump-heap. It is a grave-yard for  rusty boilers, deck-plates, chains, fire-bars. The interior of the  principal storehouse for ships' supplies, directly in front of the  office of the captain of the port, looks like a junk-shop for old  iron and newspapers. I should have enjoyed taking the captain of the  port by the neck and showing him the water-front and marine shops at  Calabar; the wharfs and quays of stone, the open places spread with  gravel, the whitewashed cement gutters, the spare parts of  machinery, greased and labeled in their proper shelves, even the  condemned scrap-iron in orderly piles; the whole yard as trim as a  battleship.    On the river-front at Leopoldville a grossly fat man, collarless,  coatless, purple-faced, perspiring, was rushing up and down. He was  the captain of the port. Black women had assembled to greet  returning black soldiers, and the captain was calling upon the black  sentries to drive them away. The sentries, yelling, fell upon the  women with their six-foot staves and beat them over the head and  bare shoulders, and as they fled, screaming, the captain of the port  danced in the sun shaking his fists after them and raging violently.  Next morning I was told he had tried to calm his nerves with  absinthe, which is not particularly good for nerves, and was  exceedingly unwell. I was sorry for him. The picture of discipline  afforded by the glazed-eyed official, reeling and cursing in the  open street, had been illuminating.    Although at Leopoldville the State has failed to build wharfs, the  esthetic features of the town have not been neglected, and there is  a pretty plaza called Stanley Park. In the centre of this plaza is a  pillar with, at its base, a bust of Leopold, and on the top of the  pillar a plaster-of-Paris lady, nude, and, not unlike the  Bacchante of MacMonnies. Not so much from the likeness as from  history, I deduced that the lady must be Cleo de Merode. But whether  the monument is erected to her or to Leopold, or to both of them, I  do not know.     [Illustration: The Monument in Stanley Park, Erected, not to   Stanley, but to Leopold.]    I left Leopoldville in the _Deliverance_. Some of the State boats  that make the long trip to Stanleyville are very large ships. They  have plenty of deck room and many cabins. With their flat, raft-like  hull, their paddle-wheel astern, and the covered sun deck, they  resemble gigantic house-boats. Of one of these boats the  _Deliverance_ was only one-third the size, but I took passage on her  because she would give me a chance to see not only something of the  Congo, but also one of its great tributaries, the less travelled  Kasai. The _Deliverance_ was about sixty-five feet over all and drew  three feet of water. She was built like a mud-scow, with a deck of  iron plates. Amidships, on this deck, was a tiny cabin with berths  for two passengers and standing room for one. The furnaces and  boiler were forward, banked by piles of wood. All the river boats  burn only wood. Her engines were in the stern. These engines and the  driving-rod to the paddle-wheel were uncovered. This gives the  _Deliverance_ the look of a large automobile without a tonneau. You  were constantly wondering what had gone wrong with the carbureter,  and if it rained what would happen to her engines. Supported on iron  posts was an upper deck, on which, forward, stood the captain's box  of a cabin and directly in front of it the steering-wheel. The  telegraph, which signalled to the openwork engine below, and a  dining table as small as a chess-board, completely filled the  \"bridge.\" When we sat at table the captain's boy could only just  squeeze himself between us and the rail. It was like dining in a  private box. And certainly no theatre ever offered such scenery, nor  did any menagerie ever present so many strange animals.    We were four white men: Captain Jensen, his engineer, and the other  passenger, Captain Anfossi, a young Italian. Before he reached his  post he had to travel one month on the _Deliverance_ and for another  month walk through the jungle. He was the most cheerful and amusing  companion, and had he been returning after three years of exile to  his home he could not have been more brimful of spirits. Captain  Jensen was a Dane (almost every river captain is a Swede or a Dane)  and talked a little English, a little French, and a little Bangala.  The mechanician was a Finn and talked the native Bangala, and  Anfossi spoke French. After chop, when we were all assembled on the  upper deck, there would be the most extraordinary talks in four  languages, or we would appoint one man to act as a clearing-house,  and he would translate for the others.    On the lower deck we carried twenty \"wood boys,\" whose duty was to  cut wood for the furnace, and about thirty black passengers. They  were chiefly soldiers, who had finished their period of service for  the State, with their wives and children. They were crowded on the  top of the hatches into a space fifteen by fifteen feet between our  cabin door and the furnace. Around the combings of the hatches, and  where the scuppers would have been had the _Deliverance_ had  scuppers, the river raced over the deck to a depth of four or five  inches. When the passengers wanted to wash their few clothes or  themselves they carried on their ablutions and laundry work where  they happened to be sitting. But for Anfossi and myself to go from  our cabin to the iron ladder of the bridge it was necessary to wade  both in the water and to make stepping stones of the passengers. I  do not mean that we merely stepped over an occasional arm or leg. I  mean we walked on them. You have seen a football player, in a hurry  to make a touchdown, hurdle without prejudice both friends and foes.  Our progress was like this. But by practice we became so expert that  without even awakening them we could spring lightly from the plump  stomach of a black baby to its mother's shoulder, from there leap to  the father's ribs, and rebound upon the rungs of the ladder.     [Illustration: The _Deliverance_.]    The river marched to the sea at the rate of four to five miles an  hour. The _Deliverance_ could make about nine knots an hour, so we  travelled at the average rate of five miles; but for the greater  part of each day we were tied to a bank while the boys went ashore  and cut enough wood to carry us farther. And we never travelled at  night. Owing to the changing currents, before the sun set we ran  into shore and made fast to a tree. I explained how in America the  river boats used search-lights, and was told that on one boat the  State had experimented with a searchlight, but that particular  searchlight having got out of order the idea of night travelling was  condemned.    Ours was a most lazy progress, but one with the most beautiful  surroundings and filled with entertainment. From our private box we  looked out upon the most wonderful of panoramas. Sometimes we were  closely hemmed in by mountains of light-green grass, except where,  in the hollows, streams tumbled in tiny waterfalls between gigantic  trees hung with strange flowering vines and orchids. Or we would  push into great lakes of swirling brown water, dotted with flat  islands overgrown with reed grass higher than the head of a man.  Again the water turned blue and the trees on the banks grew into  forests with the look of cultivated, well-cared-for parks, but with  no sign of man, not even a mud hut or a canoe; only the strangest of  birds and the great river beasts. Sometimes the sky was overcast and  gray, the warm rain shut us in like a fog, and the clouds hid the  peaks of the hills, or there would come a swift black tornado and  the rain beat into our private box, and each would sit crouched in  his rain coat, while the engineer smothered his driving-rods in palm  oil, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1430"],[0,"Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare (#10)"],[1,"rm.          ROMEO AND JULIET        Once upon a time there lived in Verona two great families named Montagu  and Capulet. They were both rich, and I suppose they were as sensible,  in most things, as other rich people. But in one thing they were  extremely silly. There was an old, old quarrel between the two families,  and instead of making it up like reasonable folks, they made a sort of  pet of their quarrel, and would not let it die out. So that a Montagu  wouldn't speak to a Capulet if he met one in the street--nor a Capulet  to a Montagu--or if they did speak, it was to say rude and unpleasant  things, which often ended in a fight. And their relations and  servants were just as foolish, so that street fights and duels and  uncomfortablenesses of that kind were always growing out of the  Montagu-and-Capulet quarrel.    Now Lord Capulet, the head of that family, gave a party-- a grand supper  and a dance--and he was so hospitable that he said anyone might come to  it except (of course) the Montagues. But there was a young Montagu named  Romeo, who very much wanted to be there, because Rosaline, the lady he  loved, had been asked. This lady had never been at all kind to him, and  he had no reason to love her; but the fact was that he wanted to love  somebody, and as he hadn't seen the right lady, he was obliged to love  the wrong one. So to the Capulet's grand party he came, with his friends  Mercutio and Benvolio.    Old Capulet welcomed him and his two friends very kindly--and young  Romeo moved about among the crowd of courtly folk dressed in their  velvets and satins, the men with jeweled sword hilts and collars, and  the ladies with brilliant gems on breast and arms, and stones of price  set in their bright girdles. Romeo was in his best too, and though he  wore a black mask over his eyes and nose, everyone could see by his  mouth and his hair, and the way he held his head, that he was twelve  times handsomer than anyone else in the room.    Presently amid the dancers he saw a lady so beautiful and so lovable  that from that moment he never again gave one thought to that Rosaline  whom he had thought he loved. And he looked at this other fair lady, as  she moved in the dance in her white satin and pearls, and all the world  seemed vain and worthless to him compared with her. And he was saying  this, or something like it, when Tybalt, Lady Capulet's nephew, hearing  his voice, knew him to be Romeo. Tybalt, being very angry, went at  once to his uncle, and told him how a Montagu had come uninvited to the  feast; but old Capulet was too fine a gentleman to be discourteous to  any man under his own roof, and he bade Tybalt be quiet. But this young  man only waited for a chance to quarrel with Romeo.    In the meantime Romeo made his way to the fair lady, and told her in  sweet words that he loved her, and kissed her. Just then her mother sent  for her, and then Romeo found out that the lady on whom he had set his  heart's hopes was Juliet, the daughter of Lord Capulet, his sworn foe.  So he went away, sorrowing indeed, but loving her none the less.    Then Juliet said to her nurse:    \"Who is that gentleman that would not dance?\"    \"His name is Romeo, and a Montagu, the only son of your great enemy,\"  answered the nurse.    Then Juliet went to her room, and looked out of her window, over the  beautiful green-grey garden, where the moon was shining. And Romeo was  hidden in that garden among the trees--because he could not bear to go  right away without trying to see her again. So she--not knowing him to  be there--spoke her secret thought aloud, and told the quiet garden how  she loved Romeo.    And Romeo heard and was glad beyond measure. Hidden below, he looked  up and saw her fair face in the moonlight, framed in the blossoming  creepers that grew round her window, and as he looked and listened, he  felt as though he had been carried away in a dream, and set down by some  magician in that beautiful and enchanted garden.    \"Ah--why are you called Romeo?\" said Juliet. \"Since I love you, what  does it matter what you are called?\"    \"Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized--henceforth I never will be  Romeo,\" he cried, stepping into the full white moonlight from the shade  of the cypresses and oleanders that had hidden him.    She was frightened at first, but when she saw that it was Romeo himself,  and no stranger, she too was glad, and, he standing in the garden below  and she leaning from the window, they spoke long together, each one  trying to find the sweetest words in the world, to make that pleasant  talk that lovers use. And the tale of all they said, and the sweet music  their voices made together, is all set down in a golden book, where you  children may read it for yourselves some day.    And the time passed so quickly, as it does for folk who love each other  and are together, that when the time came to part, it seemed as though  they had met but that moment-- and indeed they hardly knew how to part.    \"I will send to you to-morrow,\" said Juliet.    And so at last, with lingering and longing, they said good-bye.    Juliet went into her room, and a dark curtain bid her bright window.  Romeo went away through the still and dewy garden like a man in a dream.    The next morning, very early, Romeo went to Friar Laurence, a priest,  and, telling him all the story, begged him to marry him to Juliet  without delay. And this, after some talk, the priest consented to do.    So when Juliet sent her old nurse to Romeo that day to know what he  purposed to do, the old woman took back a a message that all was well,  and all things ready for the marriage of Juliet and Romeo on the next  morning.    The young lovers were afraid to ask their parents' consent to their  marriage, as young people should do, because of this foolish old quarrel  between the Capulets and the Montagues.    And Friar Laurence was willing to help the young lovers secretly,  because he thought that when they were once married their parents  might soon be told, and that the match might put a happy end to the old  quarrel.    So the next morning early, Romeo and Juliet were married at Friar  Laurence's cell, and parted with tears and kisses. And Romeo promised to  come into the garden that evening, and the nurse got ready a rope-ladder  to let down from the window, so that Romeo could climb up and talk to  his dear wife quietly and alone.    But that very day a dreadful thing happened.    Tybalt, the young man who had been so vexed at Romeo's going to the  Capulet's feast, met him and his two friends, Mercutio and Benvolio, in  the street, called Romeo a villain, and asked him to fight. Romeo had no  wish to fight with Juliet's cousin, but Mercutio drew his sword, and  he and Tybalt fought. And Mercutio was killed. When Romeo saw that this  friend was dead, he forgot everything except anger at the man who had  killed him, and he and Tybalt fought till Tybalt fell dead.    So, on the very day of his wedding, Romeo killed his dear Juliet's  cousin, and was sentenced to be banished. Poor Juliet and her young  husband met that night indeed; he climbed the rope-ladder among the  flowers, and found her window, but their meeting was a sad one, and they  parted with bitter tears and hearts heavy, because they could not know  when they should meet again.    Now Juliet's father, who, of course, had no idea that she was married,  wished her to wed a gentleman named Paris, and was so angry when she  refused, that she hurried away to ask Friar Laurence what she should do.  He advised her to pretend to consent, and then he said:    \"I will give you a draught that will make you seem to be dead for two  days, and then when they take you to church it will be to bury you, and  not to marry you. They will put you in the vault thinking you are dead,  and before you wake up Romeo and I will be there to take care of you.  Will you do this, or are you afraid?\"    \"I will do it; talk not to me of fear!\" said Juliet. And she went home  and told her father she would marry Paris. If she had spoken out and  told her father the truth . . . well, then this would have been a  different story.    Lord Capulet was very much pleased to get his own way, and set about  inviting his friends and getting the wedding feast ready. Everyone  stayed up all night, for there was a great deal to do, and very little  time to do it in. Lord Capulet was anxious to get Juliet married because  he saw she was very unhappy. Of course she was really fretting about her  husband Romeo, but her father thought she was grieving for the death of  her cousin Tybalt, and he thought marriage would give her something else  to think about.    Early in the morning the nurse came to call Juliet, and to dress her  for her wedding; but she would not wake, and at last the nurse cried out  suddenly--    \"Alas! alas! help! help! my lady's dead! Oh, well-a-day that ever I was  born!\"    Lady Capulet came running in, and then Lord Capulet, and Lord Paris, the  bridegroom. There lay Juliet cold and white and lifeless, and all their  weeping could not wake her. So it was a burying that day instead of a  marrying. Meantime Friar Laurence had sent a messenger to Mantua with a  letter to Romeo telling him of all these things; and all would have been  well, only the messenger was delayed, and could not go.    But ill news travels fast. Romeo's servant who knew the secret of the  marriage, but not of Juliet's pretended death, heard of her funeral, and  hurried to Mantua to tell Romeo how his young wife was dead and lying in  the grave.    \"Is it so?\" cried Romeo, heart-broken. \"Then I will lie by Juliet's side  to-night.\"    And he bought himself a poison, and went straight back to Verona. He  hastened to the tomb where Juliet was lying. It was not a grave, but a  vault. He broke open the door, and was just going down the stone steps  that led to the vault where all the dead Capulets lay, when he heard a"]]]
