Shrubs (#10)"],[1,"flowers, should make this species a favourite  with cultivators. Known also as D. hyemalis.    D. GENKWA.--Japanese Lilac. Japan, 1866. This is a rare and beautiful  species, of recent introduction, with large lilac-tinted,  sweetly-scently flowers.    D. LAUREOLA.--Spurge Laurel. This is not, in so far at least as flowers  are concerned, a showy species, but the ample foliage and sturdy habit  of the plant will always render this native species of value for the  shrubbery. It is of value, too, as growing and flowering freely in the  shade. The flowers are sweetly-scented and of a greenish-yellow colour,  and appear about February.    D. MEZEREUM.--The Mezereon. Europe (England). One of the commonest and  most popular of hardy garden shrubs. It is of stout, strict growth, and  produces clusters of pinky, rose, or purplish flowers before winter is  past, and while the branches are yet leafless. Few perfectly hardy  flowering shrubs are so popular as the Mezereon, and rightly so, for a  more beautiful plant could not be mentioned, wreathed as every branch  is, and almost back to the main stem, with the showiest of flowers. It  likes good, rich, dampish soil, and delights to grow in a quiet, shady  nook, or even beneath the spread of our larger forest trees. There are  several very distinct varieties, of which the white-flowered D.  Mezereum flore albo is one of the most valuable. The fruit of this  variety is bright golden-yellow. D. Mezereum autumnale and D. Mezereum  atro-rubrum are likewise interesting and beautiful forms.    D. PETRAEA (_syn D. rupestris_).--Rock Daphne. Tyrol. This is quite  hardy in the more sheltered corners of the rock garden, with neat,  shining foliage and pretty rosy flowers, produced so thickly all over  the plant as almost to hide the foliage from view. At Kew it thrives  well in peaty loam and limestone, and although it does not increase  very quickly is yet happy and contented. It is a charming rock shrub.    D. PONTICA.--Pontic Daphne. Asia Minor, 1759. This is much like D.  lauriola, but has shorter and more oval leaves, and the flowers,  instead of being borne in fives like that species, are produced in  pairs. They are also of a richer yellow, and more sweetly scented.    D. SERICEA (_syn D. collina_).--Italy and Asia Minor, 1820. This forms  a bush fully 2 feet high, with evergreen, oblong, shining leaves, and  clusters of rose-coloured flowers that are pleasantly scented. It is  quite hardy, and an interesting species that is well worthy of more  extended culture. There is a variety of this with broader foliage than  the species, and named D. sericea latifolia (_syn D. collina  latifolia_).      DAPHNIPHYLLUM.    DAPHNIPHYLLUM GLAUCESCENS.--East Indies, Java and Corea. A handsome  Japanese shrub that will be valued for its neat Rhododendron-like  foliage, compact habit of growth, and for the conspicuous bark which is  of a warm reddish hue. The leaves are large and elliptic, six inches  long, and are rendered strangely conspicuous from the foot-stalks and  midrib being dull crimson, this affording a striking contrast to the  delicate green of the leaves. It grows freely in light sandy peat.  There are two well-marked forms, one named D. glaucescens viridis, in  which the red markings of the leaves are absent; and D. glaucescens  jezoensis, a pretty and uncommon variety.      DESFONTAINEA.    DESFONTAINEA SPINOSA.--Andes from Chili to New Grenada, 1853. This is a  desirable shrub, and one that is perfectly hardy in most parts of the  country. It is a charming shrub of bold, bushy habit, with prickly  holly-like foliage, and scarlet and yellow, trumpet-shaped pendent  flowers, borne in quantity. The shelter of a wall favours the growth  and flowering of this handsome shrub, but it also succeeds well in the  open if planted in rich, light soil, and in positions that are not  exposed to cold and cutting winds.      DEUTZIA.    DEUTZIA CRENATA (_syn D. scabra_ and _D. Fortunei_).--Japan 1863. This  is of stout, bushy growth, often reaching a height of 8 feet, and  lateral spread of nearly as much. The ovate-lanceolate leaves are rough  to the touch, and its slender, but wiry stems, are wreathed for a  considerable distance along with racemes of pure white flowers. It is a  very distinct shrub, of noble port, and when in full flower is  certainly one of the most ornamental of hardy shrubs. The  double-flowered form, D. crenata flore-pleno, is one of the prettiest  flowering shrubs in cultivation, the wealth of double flowers, not  white as in the species, but tinged with reddish-purple being highly  attractive. D. crenata, Pride of Rochester, is another form with  double-white flowers, and a most distinct and beautiful shrub. Two  other very beautiful varieties are those known as D. crenata Watererii  and D. crenata Wellsii.    D. GRACILIS is a somewhat tender shrub of fully 18 inches high, with  smooth leaves and pure-white flowers produced in the greatest freedom.  It does well in warm, sheltered sites, but is most frequently seen as a  greenhouse plant. A native of Japan.      DIERVILLA.    DIERVILLA FLORIBUNDA (_syn D. multiflora_ and _Weigelia floribunda_),  from Japan, 1864, has narrow, tubular, purplish-coloured corollas, that  are only slightly opened out at the mouth. The Diervillas are valuable  decorative shrubs, of free growth in good rich loam, and bearing a  great abundance of the showiest of flowers. For shrubbery planting they  must ever rank high, the beautiful flowers and rich green ample leafage  rendering them distinct and attractive.    D. GRANDIFLORA (_syn D. amabilis_ and _Weigelia amabilis_).--Japan.  This is of larger growth than D. rosea, with strongly reticulated  leaves, that are prominently veined on the under sides, and much  larger, almost white flowers. It is a distinct and worthy species.  There are some beautiful varieties of this species, named Isolinae, Van  Houttei, and Striata.    D. ROSEA (_syn Weigelia rosea_).--China, 1844. This is a handsome hardy  shrub of small stature, with ovate-lanceolate leaves, and clusters of  showy pink, or sometimes white flowers, that are produced in April and  May. There are many good varieties of this shrub, of which the  following are the most popular:--D. rosea arborescens grandiflora; D.  rosea Lavallii, with an abundance of crimson-red flowers; D. rosea  Stelzneri, with an abundance of deep red flowers; D. rosea hortensis  nivea, large foliage, and large, pure-white flowers; D. rosea candida,  much like the latter, but bearing pure-white flowers; and D. rosea  Looymansii aurea has beautiful golden leaves.      DISCARIA.    DISCARIA LONGISPINA.--This is at once a curious and beautiful shrub, of  low, creeping growth, and poorly furnished with leaves, which, however,  are amply made up for by the deep green of the shoots and stems, and  which give to the plant almost the appearance of an evergreen. The  flowers, which are bell-shaped and white, are almost lavishly produced,  and as they last for a very long time, with only the pure white  assuming a pinky tinge when subjected to excessive sunshine, the value  of the shrub is still further enhanced. For planting against a mound of  rock this scrambling shrub is of value, but the position should not be  exposed to cold winds, for the plant is somewhat tender. From South  America, and allied to the better known Colletias.    D. SERRATIFOLIA (_syn Colletia serratifolia_), is even a handsomer  plant than the former, with minute serrated foliage, and sheets of  small white flowers in June.      DIOSPYROS.    DIOSPYROS KAKI COSTATA.--The Date Plum. China, 1789. Fruit as big as a  small apple; leaves leathery, entire, and broadly ovate; flowers and  fruits in this country when afforded the protection of a wall. The  fruit is superior to that of D. virginiana (Persimmon).    D. LOTUS, the common Date Plum, is a European species, with purplish  flowers, and oblong leaves that are reddish on the under sides. Both  species want a light, warm soil, and sheltered situation.    D. VIRGINIANA.--The Persimmon, or Virginian Date Plum. North America,  1629. A small-growing tree, with coriaceous leaves, and greenish-yellow  flowers. In southern situations and by the seaside it is perfectly  hardy, and succeeds well, but in other districts it is rather tender.  The fruit is edible, yellow in colour, and about an inch in diameter.      DIRCA.    DIRCA PALUSTRIS.--Leather Wood. North America, 1750. A much-branched  bush, of quite a tree-like character, but rarely more than 3 feet high.  To the Daphnes it is nearly allied, and is close in resemblance; but  there is a curious yellowish hue pervading the whole plant. The flowers  are produced on the naked shoots in April, and are rendered conspicuous  by reason of the pendent yellow stamens. They are borne in terminal  clusters of three or four together. It delights to grow in a cool,  moist soil, indeed it is only when so situated that the Leather Wood  can be seen in a really thriving condition.      DRIMYS.    DRIMYS AROMATICA (_syn Tasmannia aromatica_).--Tasmanian Pepper Plant.  Tasmania, 1843. This is, if we might say so, a more refined plant than  D. Winteri, with smaller and narrower leaves, and smaller flowers. The  plant, too, has altogether a faint reddish tinge, and is of upright  growth. A native of Tasmania, and called by the natives the Pepper  Plant, the fruit being used as a substitute for that condiment. Like  the other species the present plant is only hardy in warm, maritime  places, and when afforded the protection of a wall.    D. WINTERI (_syn Winter a aromatica_).--Winter's Bark. South America,  1827. The fine evergreen character is the chief attraction of this  American shrub, so far at least as garden ornamentation is concerned.  With some persons even the greenish-white flowers are held in esteem,  and it cannot be denied that a well flowered plant has its own  attractions. The long, narrow leaves "]]]
