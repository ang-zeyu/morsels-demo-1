At  first he had been humbly thankful, too, that they had sent him to this  Godforsaken Congo post instead of court-martialing him, as he had so  justly deserved; but now six months of the monotony, the frightful  isolation and the loneliness had wrought a change.  The young man  brooded continually over his fate.  His days were filled with morbid  self-pity, which eventually engendered in his weak and vacillating mind  a hatred for those who had sent him here--for the very men he had at  first inwardly thanked for saving him from the ignominy of degradation.    He regretted the gay life of Brussels as he never had regretted the  sins which had snatched him from that gayest of capitals, and as the  days passed he came to center his resentment upon the representative in  Congo land of the authority which had exiled him--his captain and  immediate superior.    This officer was a cold, taciturn man, inspiring little love in those  directly beneath him, yet respected and feared by the black soldiers of  his little command.    Werper was accustomed to sit for hours glaring at his superior as the  two sat upon the veranda of their common quarters, smoking their  evening cigarets in a silence which neither seemed desirous of  breaking.  The senseless hatred of the lieutenant grew at last into a  form of mania.  The captain's natural taciturnity he distorted into a  studied attempt to insult him because of his past shortcomings.  He  imagined that his superior held him in contempt, and so he chafed and  fumed inwardly until one evening his madness became suddenly homicidal.  He fingered the butt of the revolver at his hip, his eyes narrowed and  his brows contracted.  At last he spoke.    \"You have insulted me for the last time!\" he cried, springing to his  feet.  \"I am an officer and a gentleman, and I shall put up with it no  longer without an accounting from you, you pig.\"    The captain, an expression of surprise upon his features, turned toward  his junior.  He had seen men before with the jungle madness upon  them--the madness of solitude and unrestrained brooding, and perhaps a  touch of fever.    He rose and extended his hand to lay it upon the other's shoulder.  Quiet words of counsel were upon his lips; but they were never spoken.  Werper construed his superior's action into an attempt to close with  him.  His revolver was on a level with the captain's heart, and the  latter had taken but a step when Werper pulled the trigger.  Without a  moan the man sank to the rough planking of the veranda, and as he fell  the mists that had clouded Werper's brain lifted, so that he saw  himself and the deed that he had done in the same light that those who  must judge him would see them.    He heard excited exclamations from the quarters of the soldiers and he  heard men running in his direction.  They would seize him, and if they  didn't kill him they would take him down the Congo to a point where a  properly ordered military tribunal would do so just as effectively,  though in a more regular manner.    Werper had no desire to die.  Never before had he so yearned for life  as in this moment that he had so effectively forfeited his right to  live.  The men were nearing him.  What was he to do?  He glanced about  as though searching for the tangible form of a legitimate excuse for  his crime; but he could find only the body of the man he had so  causelessly shot down.    In despair, he turned and fled from the oncoming soldiery.  Across the  compound he ran, his revolver still clutched tightly in his hand.  At  the gates a sentry halted him.  Werper did not pause to parley or to  exert the influence of his commission--he merely raised his weapon and  shot down the innocent black.  A moment later the fugitive had torn  open the gates and vanished into the blackness of the jungle, but not  before he had transferred the rifle and ammunition belts of the dead  sentry to his own person.    All that night Werper fled farther and farther into the heart of the  wilderness.  Now and again the voice of a lion brought him to a  listening halt; but with cocked and ready rifle he pushed ahead again,  more fearful of the human huntsmen in his rear than of the wild  carnivora ahead.    Dawn came at last, but still the man plodded on.  All sense of hunger  and fatigue were lost in the terrors of contemplated capture.  He could  think only of escape.  He dared not pause to rest or eat until there  was no further danger from pursuit, and so he staggered on until at  last he fell and could rise no more.  How long he had fled he did not  know, or try to know.  When he could flee no longer the knowledge that  he had reached his limit was hidden from him in the unconsciousness of  utter exhaustion.    And thus it was that Achmet Zek, the Arab, found him.  Achmet's  followers were for running a spear through the body of their hereditary  enemy; but Achmet would have it otherwise.  First he would question the  Belgian.  It were easier to question a man first and kill him  afterward, than kill him first and then question him.    So he had Lieutenant Albert Werper carried to his own tent, and there  slaves administered wine and food in small quantities until at last the  prisoner regained consciousness.  As he opened his eyes he saw the  faces of strange black men about him, and just outside the tent the  figure of an Arab.  Nowhere was the uniform of his soldiers to be seen.    The Arab turned and seeing the open eyes of the prisoner upon him,  entered the tent.    \"I am Achmet Zek,\" he announced.  \"Who are you, and what were you doing  in my country?  Where are your soldiers?\"    Achmet Zek!  Werper's eyes went wide, and his heart sank.  He was in  the clutches of the most notorious of cut-throats--a hater of all  Europeans, especially those who wore the uniform of Belgium.  For years  the military forces of Belgian Congo had waged a fruitless war upon  this man and his followers--a war in which quarter had never been asked  nor expected by either side.    But presently in the very hatred of the man for Belgians, Werper saw a  faint ray of hope for himself.  He, too, was an outcast and an outlaw.  So far, at least, they possessed a common interest, and Werper decided  to play upon it for all that it might yield.    \"I have heard of you,\" he replied, \"and was searching for you.  My  people have turned against me.  I hate them.  Even now their soldiers  are searching for me, to kill me.  I knew that you would protect me  from them, for you, too, hate them.  In return I will take service with  you.  I am a trained soldier.  I can fight, and your enemies are my  enemies.\"    Achmet Zek eyed the European in silence.  In his mind he revolved many  thoughts, chief among which was that the unbeliever lied.  Of course  there was the chance that he did not lie, and if he told the truth then  his proposition was one well worthy of consideration, since fighting  men were never over plentiful--especially white men with the training  and knowledge of military matters that a European officer must possess.    Achmet Zek scowled and Werper's heart sank; but Werper did not know  Achmet Zek, who was quite apt to scowl where another would smile, and  smile where another would scowl.    \"And if you have lied to me,\" said Achmet Zek, \"I will kill you at any  time.  What return, other than your life, do you expect for your  services?\"    \"My keep only, at first,\" replied Werper.  \"Later, if I am worth more,  we can easily reach an understanding.\" Werper's only desire at the  moment was to preserve his life.  And so the agreement was reached and  Lieutenant Albert Werper became a member of the ivory and slave raiding  band of the notorious Achmet Zek.    For months the renegade Belgian rode with the savage raider.  He fought  with a savage abandon, and a vicious cruelty fully equal to that of his  fellow desperadoes.  Achmet Zek watched his recruit with eagle eye, and  with a growing satisfaction which finally found expression in a greater  confidence in the man, and resulted in an increased independence of  action for Werper.    Achmet Zek took the Belgian into his confidence to a great extent, and  at last unfolded to him a pet scheme which the Arab had long fostered,  but which he never had found an opportunity to effect.  With the aid of  a European, however, the thing might be easily accomplished.  He  sounded Werper.    \"You have heard of the man men call Tarzan?\" he asked.    Werper nodded.  \"I have heard of him; but I do not know him.\"    \"But for him we might carry on our 'trading' in safety and with great  profit,\" continued the Arab.  \"For years he has fought us, driving us  from the richest part of the country, harassing us, and arming the  natives that they may repel us when we come to 'trade.' He is very  rich.  If we could find some way to make him pay us many pieces of gold  we should not only be avenged upon him; but repaid for much that he has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/926"],[0,"Ten Thousand Dreams Interpreted; Or, What's in a Dream (#1)"],[1,"by Charles Keller with OmniPage Professional OCR software            _Ten Thousand Dreams  Interpreted,  OR, WHAT'S IN A DREAM_.

(This is the closest match to this etext)}      BY  GUSTAVUS HINDMAN MILLER      ``In a dream, in a vision of the night, when  deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon  the bed; then he openeth the ears of men and  sealeth their instruction that he may withdraw  man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.''  --Job xxxiii., 15.          PREFACE.      ``Dreams are rudiments of the great state to come.  We dream what is about to happen.''--BAILEY,      The Bible, as well as other great books of historical and  revealed religion, shows traces of a general and substantial  belief in dreams.  Plato, Goethe, Shakespeare and Napoleon  assigned to certain dreams prophetic value.  Joseph saw  eleven stars of the Zodiac bow to himself, the twelfth star.  The famine of Egypt was revealed by a vision of fat and lean cattle.  The parents of Christ were warned of the cruel edict of Herod,  and fled with the Divine Child into Egypt.    Pilate's wife, through the influence of a dream, advised her husband  to have nothing to do with the conviction of Christ.  But the gross  materialism of the day laughed at dreams, as it echoed the voice and  verdict of the multitude, ``Crucify the Spirit, but let the flesh live.''  Barabbas, the robber, was set at liberty.    The ultimatum of all human decrees and wisdom is to gratify  the passions of the flesh at the expense of the spirit.  The prophets and those who have stood nearest the fountain  of universal knowledge used dreams with more frequency than  any other mode of divination.    Profane, as well as sacred, history is threaded with incidents  of dream prophecy.  Ancient history relates that Gennadius  was convinced of the immortality of his soul by conversing  with an apparition in his dream.    Through the dream of Cecilia Metella, the wife of a Consul, the Roman Senate  was induced to order the temple of Juno Sospita rebuilt.    The Emperor Marcian dreamed he saw the bow of the Hunnish conqueror  break on the same night that Attila died.    Plutarch relates how Augustus, while ill, through the dream  of a friend, was persuaded to leave his tent, which a few hours  after was captured by the enemy, and the bed whereon he had lain  was pierced with the enemies' swords.    If Julius Caesar had been less incredulous about dreams he would  have listened to the warning which Calpurnia, his wife,  received in a dream.    Croesus saw his son killed in a dream.    Petrarch saw his beloved Laura, in a dream, on the day she died,  after which he wrote his beautiful poem, ``The Triumph of Death.''    Cicero relates the story of two traveling Arcadians who went to  different lodgings--one to an inn, and the other to a private house.  During the night the latter dreamed that his friend was begging for help.  The dreamer awoke; but, thinking the matter unworthy of notice, went to  sleep again.  The second time he dreamed his friend appeared, saying it would  be too late, for he had already been murdered and his body hid in a cart,  under manure.  The cart was afterward sought for and the body found.  Cicero also wrote, ``If the gods love men they will certainly disclose  their purposes to them in sleep.''    Chrysippus wrote a volume on dreams as divine portent.  He refers to the skilled interpretations of dreams as a true divination;  but adds that, like all other arts in which men have to proceed  on conjecture and on artificial rules, it is not infallible.    Plato concurred in the general idea prevailing in his day,  that there were divine manifestations to the soul in sleep.  Condorcet thought and wrote with greater fluency in his dreams  than in waking life.    Tartini, a distinguished violinist, composed his ``Devil's Sonata''  under the inspiration of a dream.  Coleridge, through dream influence,  composed his ``Kubla Khan.''    The writers of Greek and Latin classics relate many instances  of dream experiences.  Homer accorded to some dreams divine origin.  During the third and fourth centuries, the supernatural origin  of dreams was so generally accepted that the fathers, relying upon  the classics and the Bible as authority, made this belief a doctrine  of the Christian Church.    Synesius placed dreaming above all methods of divining the future;  he thought it the surest, and open to the poor and rich alike.    Aristotle wrote:  ``There is a divination concerning some things  in dreams not incredible.''  Camille Flammarion, in his great book  on ``Premonitory Dreams and Divination of the Future,'' says:  ``I do not hesitate to affirm at the outset that occurrence of dreams  foretelling future events with accuracy must be accepted as certain.''    Joan of Arc predicted her death.    Cazotte, the French philosopher and transcendentalist, warned Condorcet  against the manner of his death.    People dream now, the same as they did in medieval and ancient times.    The following excerpt from ``The Unknown,''[1] a recent book  by Flammarion, the French astronomer, supplemented with a few  of my own thoughts and collections, will answer the purposes  intended for this book.      [1] ``From `The Unknown.'  Published by Harper & Brothers Copyright,  1900, by Camille Flammarion.''      ``We may see without eyes and hear without ears, not by unnatural excitement  of our sense of vision or of hearing, for these accounts prove the contrary,  but by some interior sense, psychic and mental.    ``The soul, by its interior vision, may see not only what is  passing at a great distance, but it may also know in advance  what is to happen in the future.  The future exists potentially,  determined by causes which bring to pass successive events.    ``POSITIVE OBSERVATION PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF A PSYCHIC WORLD,  as real as the world known to our physical senses.    ``And now, because the soul acts at a distance by some power that belongs  to it, are we authorized to conclude that it exists as something real,  and that it is not the result of functions of the brain?    ``Does light really exist?    ``Does heat exist?    ``Does sound exist?    ``No.    ``They are only manifestations produced by movement.    ``What we call light is a sensation produced upon our optic nerve  by the vibrations of ether, comprising between 400 and 756 trillions  per second, undulations that are themselves very obscure.    ``What we call heat is a sensation produced by vibrations between 350  and and{sic} 600 trillions.    ``The sun lights up space, as much at midnight as at midday.  Its temperature is nearly 270 degrees below zero.    ``What we call sound is a sensation produced upon our auditory nerve  by silent vibrations of the air, themselves comprising between 32,000  and 36,000 a second.     . . . . . .      ``Very many scientific terms represent only results, not causes.  ``The soul may be in the same case.    ``The observations given in this work, the sensations, the impressions,  the visions, things heard, etc., may indicate physical effects produced  without the brain.    ``Yes, no doubt, but it does not seem so.    ``Let us examine one instance.    ``Turn back to page 156.@@@    ``A young woman, adored by her husband, dies at Moscow.  Her father-in-law,  at Pulkowo, near St. Petersburg, saw her that same hour by his side.  She walked with him along the street; then she disappeared.  Surprised, startled, and terrified, he telegraphed to his son,  and learned both the sickness and the death of his daughter-in-law.    ``We are absolutely obliged to admit that SOMETHING emanated  from the dying woman and touched her father-in-law. This  _thing unknown_ may have been an ethereal movement,  as in the case of light, and may have been only an effect,  a product, a result; but this effect must have had a cause,  and this cause evidently proceeded from the woman who was dying.  Can the constitution of the brain explain this projection?  I do not think that any anatomist or physiologist will give  this question an affirmative answer.  One feels that there is  a force unknown, proceeding, not from our physical organization,  but from that in us which can think.    ``Take another example (see page 57).@@@    ``A lady in her own house hears a voice singing.  It is the voice of a friend now in a convent, and she faints,  because she is sure it is the voice of the dead.  At the same moment that friend does really die, twenty miles  away from her.    ``Does not this give us the impression that one soul holds  communication with another?    ``Here is another example (page 163):@@@    ``The wife of a captain who has gone out to the Indian mutiny sees one night  her husband standing before her with his hands pressed to his breast,  and a look of suffering on his face.

The War Office subsequently publishes his death as having taken place  on November 15th.  She endeavors to have the true date ascertained.  The War Office was wrong.  He died on the 14th.    ``A child six years old stops in the middle of his play and  cries out, frightened:  ``Mamma, I have seen Mamma.''
