But not all the medicine ideas and methods of the Indians were to be  classed as humbug. Dr. Cephas L. Bard, who, besides extolling their  temescals, or sweat-baths, their surgical abilities, as displayed in the  operations that were performed upon skulls that have since been exhumed;  their hygienic customs, which he declares \"are not only commendable, but  worthy of the consideration of an advanced civilization,\"  states further:         \"It has been reserved for the California Indian to furnish       three of the most valuable vegetable additions which have       been made to the Pharmacopoeia during the last twenty years.       One, the Eriodictyon Glutinosum, growing profusely in our       foothills, was used by them in affections of the respiratory       tract, and its worth was so appreciated by the Missionaries       as to be named Yerba Santa, or Holy Plant. The second, the       Rhamnus purshiana, gathered now for the market in the upper       portions of the State, is found scattered through the       timbered mountains of Southern California. It was used as a       laxative, and on account of the constipating effect of an       acorn diet, was doubtless in active demand. So highly was it       esteemed by the followers of the Cross that it was christened       Cascara Sagrada, or Sacred Bark. The third, Grindelia       robusta, was used in the treatment of pulmonary troubles, and       externally in poisoning from Rhus toxicodendron, or Poison       Oak, and in various skin diseases.\"    Their food was of the crudest and simplest character. Whatever they  could catch they ate, from deer or bear to grasshoppers, lizards, rats,  and snakes. In baskets of their own manufacture, they gathered all  kinds of wild seeds, and after using a rude process of threshing, they  winnowed them. They also gathered mesquite beans in large quantities,  burying them in pits for a month or two, in order to extract from them  certain disagreeable flavors, and then storing them in large and rudely  made willow granaries. But, as Dr. Bard well says:         \"Of the Vegetable articles of diet the acorn was the       principal one. It was deprived of its bitter taste by       grinding, running through sieves made of interwoven grasses,       and frequent washings. Another one was Chia, the seeds of       Salvia Columbariae, which in appearance are somewhat similar       to birdseed. They were roasted, ground, and used as a food by       being mixed with water. Thus prepared, it soon develops into       a mucilaginous mass, larger than its original bulk. Its taste       is somewhat like that of linseed meal. It is exceedingly       nutritious, and was readily borne by the stomach when that       organ refused to tolerate other aliment. An atole, or gruel,       of this was one of the peace offerings to the first visiting       sailors. One tablespoonful of these seeds was sufficient to       sustain for twenty-four hours an Indian on a forced march.       Chia was no less prized by the native Californian, and at       this late date it frequently commands $6 or $8 a pound.         \"The pinion, the fruit of the pine, was largely used, and       until now annual expeditions are made by the few surviving       members of the coast tribes to the mountains for a supply.       That they cultivated maize in certain localities, there can       be but little doubt. They intimated to Cabrillo by signs that       such was the case, and the supposition is confirmed by the       presence at various points of vestiges of irrigating ditches.       Yslay, the fruit of the wild cherry, was used as a food, and       prepared by fermentation as an intoxicant. The seeds, ground       and made into balls, were esteemed highly. The fruit of the       manzanita, the seeds of burr clover, malva, and alfileri,       were also used. Tunas, the fruit of the cactus, and wild       blackberries, existed in abundance, and were much relished. A       sugar was extracted from a certain reed of the tulares.\"    Acorns, seeds, mesquite beans, and dried meat were all pounded up in a  well made granite mortar, on the top of which, oftentimes, a basket  hopper was fixed by means of pine gum. Some of these mortars were hewn  from steatite, or soapstone, others from a rough basic rock, and many of  them were exceedingly well made and finely shaped; results requiring  much patience and no small artistic skill. Oftentimes these mortars were  made in the solid granite rocks or boulders, found near the harvesting  and winnowing places, and I have photographed many such during  late years.    These Indians were polygamists, but much of what the missionaries and  others have called their obscenities and vile conversations, were the  simple and unconscious utterances of men and women whose instincts were  not perverted. It is the invariable testimony of all careful observers  of every class that as a rule the aborigines were healthy, vigorous,  virile, and chaste, until they became demoralized by the whites. With  many of them certain ceremonies had a distinct flavor of sex worship: a  rude phallicism which exists to the present day. To the priests, as to  most modern observers, these rites were offensive and obscene, but to  the Indians they were only natural and simple prayers for the  fruitfulness of their wives and of the other producing forces.    J.S. Hittell says of the Indians of California:         \"They had no religion, no conception of a deity, or of a       future life, no idols, no form of worship, no priests, no       philosophical conceptions, no historical traditions, no       proverbs, no mode of recording thought before the coming of       the missionaries among them.\"    Seldom has there been so much absolute misstatement as in this  quotation. Jeremiah Curtin, a life-long student of the Indian, speaking  of the same Indians, makes a remark which applies with force to these  statements:         \"The Indian, _at every step_, stood face to face with       divinity as he knew or understood it. He could never escape       from the presence of those powers who had made the first       world.... The most important question of all in Indian life       was communication with divinity, intercourse with the spirits       of divine personages.\"    In his _Creation Myths of Primitive America_, this studious author gives  the names of a number of divinities, and the legends connected with  them. He affirms positively that         \"the most striking thing in all savage belief is the low       estimate put upon man, when unaided by divine, uncreated       power. In Indian belief every object in the universe is       divine except man!\"    As to their having no priests, no forms of worship, no philosophical  conceptions, no historical traditions, no proverbs, any one interested  in the Indian of to-day knows that these things are untrue. Whence came  all the myths and legends that recent writers have gathered, a score of  which I myself hold still unpublished in my notebook? Were they all  imagined after the arrival of the Mission Fathers? By no means! They  have been handed down for countless centuries, and they come to us,  perhaps a little corrupted, but still just as accurate as do the  songs of Homer.    Every tribe had its medicine men, who were developed by a most rigorous  series of tests; such as would dismay many a white man. As to their  philosophical conceptions and traditions, Curtin well says that in them         \"we have a monument of thought which is absolutely       unequalled, altogether unique in human experience. The       special value of this thought lies, moreover, in the fact       that it is primitive; that it is the thought of ages long       anterior to those which we find recorded in the eastern       hemisphere, either in sacred books, in histories, or in       literature, whether preserved on baked brick, burnt       cylinders, or papyrus.\"    And if we go to the Pueblo Indians, the Navahos, the Pimas, and others,  all of whom were brought more or less under the influence of the  Franciscans, we find a mass of beliefs, deities, traditions,  conceptions, and proverbs, which would overpower Mr. Hittell merely  to collate.    Therefore, let it be distinctly understood that the Indian was not the  thoughtless, unimaginative, irreligious, brutal savage which he is too  often represented to be. He thought, and thought well, but still  originally. He was religious, profoundly and powerfully so, but in his  own way; he was a philosopher, but not according to Hittell; he was a  worshipper, but not after the method of Serra, Palou, and their priestly  coadjutors.        CHAPTER VII    THE INDIANS UNDER THE PADRES    The first consideration of the padres in dealing with the Indians was  the salvation of their souls. Of this no honest and honorable man can  hold any question. Serra and his coadjutors believed, without  equivocation or reserve, the doctrines of the Church. As one reads his  diary, his thought on this matter is transparent. In one place he thus  naively writes: \"It seemed to me that they (the Indians) would fall  shortly into the apostolic and evangelic net.\"    This accomplished, the Indians must be kept Christians, educated and  civilized. Here is the crucial point. In reading criticisms upon the  Mission system of dealing with the Indians, one constantly meets with  such passages as the following: \"The fatal defect of this whole Spanish  system was that no effort was made to educate the Indians, or teach them  to read, and think, and act for themselves.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13858"],[0,"The Laws Of War, Affecting Commerce And Shipping (#10)"],[1," why the ship and goods  should not be condemned. At the expiration of twenty days, the  monition is returned into the registry, with a certificate of its  service; and if any claim has been given, the cause is then ready for  hearing, upon evidence arising out of the ship's papers and  preparatory examinations.    The _neutral master or proprietor of the cargo_ takes measures as  follows:--Upon being brought into port, the master usually makes a  protest, which he forwards to London as instructions, (or with such  further directions as he thinks proper) either to the correspondent of  his owners, or to the consul of his nation, in order to claim the ship  or such parts of the cargo as belong to his owners, or with which he  was particularly entrusted; or the master himself goes to London to  take the necessary steps, as soon as he has undergone his examination.    The master, correspondent, or consul, applies to a proctor, who  prepares a claim supported by the affidavit of the claimant, stating  briefly to whom, as he believes, the ship and goods claimed belong;  and that no enemy has any right or interest therein; security must be  given to the amount of sixty pounds, to answer costs, if the case  should appear so grossly fraudulent on the part of the claimant as to  subject him to be condemned therein. If the captor has neglected in  the mean time to take the usual steps, (but which seldom happens, as  he is strictly enjoined both by his instructions and by the Prize Act  to proceed immediately to adjudication,) a process issues against him,  on the application of the claimant's proctor, to bring in the ship's  papers and preparatory examinations, and to proceed in the usual way.    As soon as the claim is given, copies of the ship's papers and  examinations are procured from the registry, and upon the return of  the monition the cause may be heard. It however seldom happens, owing  to the great pressure of business, (especially at the commencement of  war), that causes can possibly be prepared for hearing immediately on  the expiration of the time for the return of the monition; in that  case, each cause must necessarily take its regular turn. Correspondent  measures must be taken, by the neutral master, if carried within the  jurisdiction of a Vice-Admiralty Court, by giving a claim, supported  by his affidavit, and offering a security for costs, if the claim  should be pronounced grossly fraudulent.    If the claimant be dissatisfied with the sentence, his proctor enters  an appeal in the registry of the Court, where the sentence was given,  or before a notary public (which regularly should be entered within  fourteen days after the sentence); and he afterwards applies at the  registry of the Lords of Appeal in prize causes, which is held at the  same place as the registry of the High Court of Admiralty, for an  instrument called an inhibition, and which should be taken out within  three months, if the sentence be in the High Court of Admiralty; and  within nine months, if in a Vice-Admiralty Court; but may be taken out  at later periods if a reasonable cause can be alleged for the delay  which has intervened. This instrument directs the judge, whose  sentence is appealed from, to proceed no further in the cause; it  directs the registrar to transmit a copy of all proceedings of the  inferior courts; and it directs the party who has obtained the  sentence to appear before the superior tribunal to answer to the  appeal. On applying for the inhibition, security is given on the part  of the appellant to the amount of two hundred pounds, to answer costs,  in case it should appear to the Court of Appeal that the appeal is  vexatious. The inhibition is to be served upon the judge, the  registrar, and the adverse party, and his proctor, by shewing the  instrument under seal, and delivering a note of its contents. If the  party cannot be found, and his proctor will not accept the service,  the instrument is to be served, _viis et modis_; that is, by affixing  it to the door of the last place of residence, or by hanging it on the  pillars of the Royal Exchange. That part of the process above  described, which is to be executed abroad, may be performed by any  person to whom it is committed, and the formal part at home is  executed by the officer of the court. A certificate of the service is  endorsed on the back of the instrument, sworn before the surrogate of  the superior court, or before a notary public, if the service is  abroad.    If the cause be adjudged in the Vice-Admiralty Court, it is usual, on  entering the appeal there, to procure a copy of the proceedings, which  the appellant sends over to his correspondent in, England, who carries  it to a proctor, and the same steps are taken to procure and send the  inhibition as when the cause has been adjudged in the High Court of  Admiralty. But if a copy of the proceedings cannot be procured in due  time, an inhibition can be obtained, by sending over a copy of the  instrument of appeal, or by writing to the correspondent an account  only of the time and substance of the sentence.    Upon an appeal, fresh evidence may be introduced, if, upon hearing,  the Lords of Appeal should be of an opinion that the cause is of such  doubt, or that further proof ought to have been ordered by the court  below.    Further proof usually consists of affidavits made by the asserted  proprietors of the goods, in which they are sometimes joined with  their clerks, and others acquainted with the real transactions, and  with the real property of the goods claimed. In corroboration of these  affidavits, may be annexed the original correspondence, duplicates of  bills of lading, invoices, extracts from books, &c. These papers must  be proved by affidavits of persons who can speak of their  authenticity; and if copies or extracts, they should be collected and  certified by public notaries. The affidavits are sworn before  magistrates, or others competent to administer oaths in the country  where they are made, and authenticated by a certificate from the  British Consul.    The degree of proof required depends upon the degree of suspicion or  doubt that belongs to the case. In case of heavy suspicion and great  importance, the court may order what is called \"plea and proof,\" that  is, instead of admitting affidavits and documents introduced by the  claimant only, each party is at liberty to allege, in regular  pleadings, such circumstance as may tend to acquit or condemn the  capture, and to examine witnesses in support of the allegation, to  whom the opposite party may administer interrogatories. The  depositions of the witnesses are taken in writing. If the witnesses  are to be examined abroad, a commission issues for that purpose; but  in no case is it necessary for them to come to England. These solemn  proceedings are seldom resorted to. Standing Commissions may be sent  to any neutral country for the general purpose of receiving  examinations of witnesses, in all cases where the court may find it  necessary, for the purposes of justice, to decree an enquiry to be  conducted in that manner.[100]    [Sidenote: Prize Jurisdiction.]    The Jurisdiction over Prizes is exercised by the Judge of the  Admiralty, exclusively of every other judicature of the kind, except  in cases of appeal.    This Jurisdiction in matter of Prize, (whether it is coeval with the  Court of Admiralty, or, which is much more probable, of a later  institution, beyond the time of memory,) though exercised by the same  person, is quite distinct in its nature.    The Judge of the Admiralty is appointed by a commission under the  great seal, which enumerates particularly, as well as generally, every  object of his jurisdiction, but not a word of prize.    To constitute that authority, in every war, a commission under the  great seal issues to the Lord High Admiral to will and require the  Court of Admiralty, and the Lieutenant and Judge of the said court,  his surrogate or surrogates, and they are thereby authorised and  required to proceed upon all and all manner of captures, seizures,  prizes, and reprisals, of all ships and goods that are or shall be  taken, and to hear and determine according to the Courts of Admiralty  and the Law of Nations.    A warrant issues to the judge accordingly.    The Court of Admiralty is called the Instance Court; the other the  Prize Court. The manner of proceeding is totally different. The whole  system of litigation and jurisprudence in the Prize Court is peculiar  to itself.    [Sidenote: Common Law Courts not always excluded]    A thing being done on the high seas does not exclude the jurisdiction  of the Courts of Common Law. For seizure, stopping, or taking a ship  upon the high seas, but _not as prize_, an action will lie; but for  taking as _prize_, no action will lie. The nature of the question, not  the locality, excludes.    The end of a Prize Court is to suspend the property till condemnation,  to punish every sort of misbehaviour in the captors; to restore  instantly (full sail) if upon the most summary examination there does  not appear a sufficient ground; to condemn finally, if the goods  really are prize, against everybody; giving every body a fair  opportunity of being heard. A captor may, and must force everybody  interested to defend; and every person interested may force him to  proceed to condemn without delay.[101]    [Sidenote: Prize Courts.]    Before the sixth of the reign of Queen Anne there were no laws made on  this subject. Previous to that time all prizes taken in war were of  right vested in the Crown, and questions concerning the property of  such prizes were not the subject of discussion in courts of law. But  in order to do justice to claimants, from the first year after the  Restoration of Charles the Second, special commissions were issued to  enable the Courts of Admiralty to condemn such captures as appeared to  be lawful prizes; to"]]]
