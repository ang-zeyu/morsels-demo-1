Mr. Wharton had listened intently to each speaker, in succession, and  had so far lost the affectation of indifference, as to be crushing in  his hand the pieces of china on which he had expended so much labor in  endeavoring to mend it; when, observing the peddler tying the last knot  in his pack, he asked abruptly,    \"Are we about to be disturbed again with the enemy?\"    \"Who do you call the enemy?\" said the peddler, raising himself erect,  and giving the other a look, before which the eyes of Mr. Wharton sank  in instant confusion.    \"All are enemies who disturb our peace,\" said Miss Peyton, observing  that her brother was unable to speak. \"But are the royal troops out  from below?\"    \"'Tis quite likely they soon may be,\" returned Birch, raising his pack  from the floor, and preparing to leave the room.    \"And the continentals,\" continued Miss Peyton mildly, \"are the  continentals in the county?\"    Harvey was about to utter something in reply, when the door opened, and  Caesar made his appearance, attended by his delighted spouse.    The race of blacks of which Caesar was a favorable specimen is becoming  very rare. The old family servant who, born and reared in the dwelling  of his master, identified himself with the welfare of those whom it was  his lot to serve, is giving place in every direction to that vagrant  class which has sprung up within the last thirty years, and whose  members roam through the country unfettered by principles, and  uninfluenced by attachments. For it is one of the curses of slavery,  that its victims become incompetent to the attributes of a freeman. The  short curly hair of Caesar had acquired from age a coloring of gray,  that added greatly to the venerable cast of his appearance. Long and  indefatigable applications of the comb had straightened the close curls  of his forehead, until they stood erect in a stiff and formal brush,  that gave at least two inches to his stature. The shining black of his  youth had lost its glistening hue, and it had been succeeded by a dingy  brown. His eyes, which stood at a most formidable distance from each  other, were small, and characterized by an expression of good feeling,  occasionally interrupted by the petulance of an indulged servant; they,  however, now danced with inward delight. His nose possessed, in an  eminent manner, all the requisites for smelling, but with the most  modest unobtrusiveness; the nostrils being abundantly capacious, without  thrusting themselves in the way of their neighbors. His mouth was  capacious to a fault, and was only tolerated on account of the double  row of pearls it contained. In person Caesar was short, and we should  say square, had not all the angles and curves of his figure bid defiance  to anything like mathematical symmetry. His arms were long and muscular,  and terminated by two bony hands, that exhibited on one side a coloring  of blackish gray, and on the other, a faded pink. But it was in his legs  that nature had indulged her most capricious humor. There was an  abundance of material injudiciously used. The calves were neither before  nor behind, but rather on the outer side of the limb, inclining forward,  and so close to the knee as to render the free use of that joint a  subject of doubt. In the foot, considering it as a base on which the  body was to rest, Caesar had no cause of complaint, unless, indeed, it  might be that the leg was placed so near the center, as to make it  sometimes a matter of dispute, whether he was not walking backwards. But  whatever might be the faults a statuary could discover in his person,  the heart of Caesar Thompson was in the right place, and, we doubt not,  of very just dimensions.    Accompanied by his ancient companion, Caesar now advanced, and paid his  tribute of gratitude in words. Sarah received them with great  complacency, and made a few compliments to the taste of the husband, and  the probable appearance of the wife. Frances, with a face beaming with a  look of pleasure that corresponded to the smiling countenances of the  blacks, offered the service of her needle in fitting the admired calico  to its future uses. The offer was humbly and gratefully accepted.    As Caesar followed his wife and the peddler from the apartment, and was  in the act of closing the door, he indulged himself in a grateful  soliloquy, by saying aloud,--    \"Good little lady--Miss Fanny--take care of he fader--love to make a  gown for old Dinah, too.\" What else his feelings might have induced him  to utter is unknown, but the sound of his voice was heard some time  after the distance rendered his words indistinct.    Harper had dropped his book, and he sat an admiring witness of the  scene; and Frances enjoyed a double satisfaction, as she received an  approving smile from a face which concealed, under the traces of deep  thought and engrossing care, the benevolent expression which  characterizes all the best feelings of the human heart.          CHAPTER IV          \"It is the form, the eye, the word,      The bearing of that stranger lord,      His stature, manly, bold, and tall,      Built like a castle's battled wall,      Yet molded in such just degrees      His giant strength seems lightsome ease.      Weather and war their rougher trace      Have left on that majestic face;      But 'tis his dignity of eye!      There, if a suppliant, would I fly,      Secure, 'mid danger, wrongs, and grief,      Of sympathy, redress, relief--      That glance, if guilty, would I dread      More than the doom that spoke me dead.\"      \"Enough, enough!\" the princess cried,      \"'Tis Scotland's hope, her joy, her pride!\"                                            --WALTER SCOTT.    The party sat in silence for many minutes after the peddler had  withdrawn. Mr. Wharton had heard enough to increase his uneasiness,  without in the least removing his apprehensions on behalf of his son.  The captain was impatiently wishing Harper in any other place than the  one foe occupied with such apparent composure, while Miss Peyton  completed the disposal of her breakfast equipage, with the mild  complacency of her nature, aided a little by an inward satisfaction at  possessing so large a portion of the trader's lace; Sarah was busily  occupied in arranging her purchases, and Frances was kindly assisting in  the occupation, disregarding her own neglected bargains, when the  stranger suddenly broke the silence by saying,--    \"If any apprehensions of me induce Captain Wharton to maintain his  disguise, I wish him to be undeceived; had I motives for betraying him,  they could not operate under present circumstances.\"    The younger sister sank into her seat colorless and astonished. Miss  Peyton dropped the tea tray she was lifting from the table, and Sarah  sat with her purchases unheeded in her lap, in speechless surprise. Mr.  Wharton was stupefied; but the captain, hesitating a moment from  astonishment, sprang into the middle of the room, and exclaimed, as he  tore off the instruments of his disguise,--    \"I believe you from my soul, and this tiresome imposition shall continue  no longer. Yet I am at a loss to conceive in what manner you should  know me.\"    \"You really look so much better in your proper person, Captain Wharton,\"  said Harper, with a slight smile, \"I would advise you never to conceal  it in future. There is enough to betray you, if other sources of  detection were wanting.\" As he spoke, he pointed to a picture suspended  over the mantel piece, which exhibited the British officer in his  regimentals.    \"I had flattered myself,\" cried young Wharton, with a laugh, \"that I  looked better on the canvas than in a masquerade. You must be a close  observer, sir.\"    \"Necessity has made me one,\" said Harper, rising from his seat.    Frances met him as he was about to withdraw, and, taking his hand  between both her own, said with earnestness, her cheeks mantling with  their richest vermilion, \"You cannot--you will not betray my brother.\"    For an instant Harper paused in silent admiration of the lovely pleader,  and then, folding her hands on his breast, he replied solemnly, \"I  cannot, and I will not.\" He released her hands, and laying his own on  her head gently, continued, \"If the blessing of a stranger can profit  you, receive it.\" He turned, and, bowing low, retired, with a delicacy  that was duly appreciated by those he quitted, to his own apartment.    The whole party were deeply impressed with the ingenuous and solemn  manner of the traveler, and all but the father found immediate relief in  his declaration. Some of the cast-off clothes of the captain, which had  been removed with the goods from the city, were produced; and young  Wharton, released from the uneasiness of his disguise, began at last to  enjoy a visit which had been undertaken at so much personal risk to  himself. Mr. Wharton retiring to his apartment, in pursuance of his  regular engagements, the ladies, with the young man, were left to an  uninterrupted communication on such subjects as were most agreeable.  Even Miss Peyton was affected with the spirits of her young relatives;  and they sat for an hour enjoying, in heedless confidence, the pleasures  of an unrestrained conversation, without reflecting on any danger which  might be impending over them. The city and their acquaintances were not  long neglected; for Miss Peyton, who had never forgotten the many  agreeable hours of her residence within its boundaries, soon inquired,  among others, after their old acquaintance, Colonel Wellmere.    \"Oh!\" cried the captain, gayly, \"he yet continues there, as handsome and  as gallant as ever.\"    Although a woman be not actually in love, she seldom hears without a  blush the name of a man whom she might love, and who has been connected  with herself by idle"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],[0,"The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#10)"],[1,"the Book of Genesis. That there was a very ancient shrine in  Hebron, that the great Tree of Mamre was the abode of a local deity, may be  conceded, but to my mind there is no more real figure in history than  Abraham. Especially when one compares the modern legends with the Biblical  story does the substantial truth of the narrative in Genesis manifest  itself. The narrative may contain elements of folk poetry, but the hero  Abraham is a genuine personality.    As I have mentioned the tree, it may be as well to add at once that  Abraham's Oak is still shown at Hebron, and one can well imagine how it was  thought that this magnificent terebinth dated from Bible times. A few years  ago it was a fresh, vigorous giant, but now it is quite decayed. The ruin  began in 1853, when a large branch was broken off by the weight of the  snow. Twelve years ago the Russian Archimandrite of Jerusalem purchased the  land on which the tree stands, and naturally he took much care of the  relic. In fact, he took too much care, for some people think that the low  wall which the Russians erected as a safeguard round the Oak, has been the  cause of the rapid decay that has since set in. Year by year the branches  have dropped off, the snow and the lightning have had their victims. It is  said that only two or three years ago one branch towards the East was still  living, but when I saw it, the trunk was bare and bark-less, full of little  worm-holes, and quite without a spark of vitality. The last remaining  fragment has since fallen, and now the site of the tree is only marked by  the row of young cypresses which have been planted in a circle round the  base of the Oak of Mamre. But who shall prophesy that, a century hence, a  tree will not have acquired sufficient size and antiquity to be foisted  upon uncritical pilgrims as the veritable tree under which Father Abraham  dwelt!    The Jewish tradition does not quite agree with the view that identified  this old tree with Mamre. According to Jewish tradition, the Tree is at the  ruins of Ramet el-Khalil, the High Place of the Friend, _i.e._ of Abraham,  about two miles nearer Jerusalem. Mr. Shaw Caldecott has propounded the  theory that this site is Samuel's Ramah, and that the vast ruins of a  stone-walled enclosure here represent the enclosure within which Samuel's  altar stood. The Talmud has it that Abraham erected a guest-house for the  entertainment of strangers near the Grove of Mamre. There were doors on  every side, so that the traveller found a welcome from whichever direction  he came. There our father made the name of God proclaimed at the mouth of  all wayfarers. How? After they had eaten and refreshed themselves, they  rose to thank him. Abraham answered, \"Was the food mine? It is the bounty  of the Creator of the Universe.\" Then they praised, glorified, and blessed  Him who spake and the world was.    We are on the road now near Hebron, but, before entering, let us recall a  few incidents in its history. After the Patriarchal age, Hebron was noted  as the possession of Caleb. It also figures as a priestly city and as one  of the cities of refuge. David passed much of his life here, and, after  Saul's death, Hebron was the seat of David's rule over Judea. Abner was  slain here by Joab, and was buried here--they still show Abner's tomb in  the garden of a large house within the city. By the pool at Hebron were  slain the murderers of Ishbosheth, and here Absalom assumed the throne.  After his time we hear less of Hebron. Jerusalem overshadowed it in  importance, yet we have one or two mentions. Rehoboam strengthened the  town, and from a stray reference in Nehemiah, we gather that the place long  continued to be called by its older name of Kiriath Arba. For a long period  after the return from the Exile Hebron belonged to the Idumeans. It was the  scene of warfare in the Maccabean period, and also during the rebellion  against Rome. In the market-place at Hebron, Hadrian sold numbers of Jewish  slaves after the fall of Bar-Cochba, in 135 C.E. In the twelfth century  Hebron was in the hands of the Christian Crusaders. The fief of Hebron, or,  as it was called, of Saint Abraham, extended southwards to Beer-sheba. A  bishopric was founded there in 1169, but was abandoned twenty years later.    We hear of many pilgrims in the Middle Ages. The Christians used to eat  some of the red earth of Hebron, the earth from which Adam was made. On  Sunday the seventeenth of October, 1165, Maimonides was in Hebron, passing  the city on his way from Jerusalem to Cairo. Obadiah of Bertinoro, in 1488,  took Hebron on the reverse route. He went from Egypt across the desert to  Gaza, and, though he travelled all day, did not reach Hebron from Gaza till  the second morning. If the text is correct, David Reubeni was four days in  traversing the same road, a distance of about thirty-three miles. To revert  to an earlier time, Nachmanides very probably visited Hebron. Indeed, his  grave is shown to the visitor. But this report is inaccurate. He wrote to  his son, in 1267, from Jerusalem, \"Now I intend to go to Hebron, to the  sepulchre of our ancestors, to prostrate myself, and there to dig my  grave.\" But he must have altered his mind in the last-named particular, for  his tomb is most probably in Acre.    I need not go through the list of distinguished visitors to Hebron. Suffice  it to say that in the fourteenth century there was a large and flourishing  community of Jews in the town; they were weavers and dyers of cotton stuffs  and glass-makers, and the Rabbi was often himself a shepherd in the literal  sense, teaching the Torah while at work in the fields. He must have felt  embarrassed sometimes between his devotion to his metaphorical and to his  literal flock. When I was at Moza, I was talking over some Biblical texts  with Mr. David Yellin, who was with me. The colonists endured this for a  while, but at last they broke into open complaint. One of the colonists  said to me: \"It is true that the Mishnah forbids you to turn aside from the  Torah to admire a tree, but you have come all the way from Europe to admire  my trees. Leave the Torah alone for the present.\" I felt that he was right,  and wondered how the Shepherd Rabbis of Hebron managed in similar  circumstances.    In the century of which I am speaking, the Hebron community consisted  entirely of Sefardim, and it was not till the sixteenth century that  Ashkenazim settled there in large numbers. I have already mentioned the  visit of David Reubeni. He was in Hebron in 1523, when he entered the Cave  of Machpelah on March tenth, at noon. It is of interest to note that his  account of the Cave agrees fully with that of Conder. It is now quite  certain that he was really there in person, and his narrative was not made  up at second hand. The visit of Reubeni, as well as Sabbatai Zebi's, gave  new vogue to the place. When Sabbatai was there, a little before the year  1666, the Jews were awake and up all night, so as not to lose an instant of  the sacred intercourse with the Messiah. But the journey to Hebron was not  popular till our own days. It was too dangerous, the Hebron natives  enjoying a fine reputation for ferocity and brigandage. An anonymous Hebrew  writer writes from Jerusalem in 1495, that a few days before a Jew from  Hebron had been waylaid and robbed. But he adds: \"I hear that on Passover  some Jews are coming here from Egypt and Damascus, with the intention of  also visiting Hebron. I shall go with them, if I am still alive.\"    In Baedeker, Hebron is still given a bad character, the Muslims of the  place being called fanatical and violent. I cannot confirm this verdict.  The children throw stones at you, but they take good care not to hit. As I  have already pointed out, Hebron is completely non-Christian, just as  Bethlehem is completely non-Mohammedan. The Crescent is very disinclined to  admit the Cross into Hebron, the abode of Abraham, a name far more honored  by Jews and Mohammedans than by Christians.    It is not quite just to call the Hebronites fanatical and sullen; they  really only desire to hold Hebron as their own. \"Hebron for the Hebronites\"  is their cry. The road, at all events, is quite safe. One of the surprises  of Palestine is the huge traffic along the main roads. Orientals not only  make a great bustle about what they do, but they really are very busy  people. Along the roads you meet masses of passengers, people on foot, on  mules and horses, on camels, in wheeled vehicles. You come across groups of  pilgrims, with one mule to the party, carrying the party's goods, the  children always barefooted and bareheaded--the latter fact making you  realize how the little boy in the Bible story falling sick in the field  exclaimed \"My head, my head!\" Besides the pilgrims, there are the bearers  of goods and produce. You see donkeys carrying large stones for building,  one stone over each saddle. If you are as lucky as I was, you may see a  runaway camel along the Hebron road, scouring alone at break-neck speed,  with laughter-producing gait.    Of Hebron itself I saw little as I entered, because I arrived towards  sunset, and only had time to notice that everyone in the streets carried a  lantern. In Jerusalem only the women carry lights, but in Hebron men had  them as well. I wondered where I was to pass the night. Three friends had  accompanied me from Jerusalem, and they told me not to worry, as we could  stay at the Jewish doctor's. It seemed to me a cool piece of impudence to  billet a party on a man whose name had been previously unknown to me, but  the result proved that they were right. The doctor welcomed us right  heartily; he said that it was a joy to entertain us. Now it was that one  saw the advantages of the Oriental architecture. The chief room in an  Eastern house is surrounded on three sides by a wide stone or wooden divan,  which, in wealthy houses, is richly upholstered. The "]]]
