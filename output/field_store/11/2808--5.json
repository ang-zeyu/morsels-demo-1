The weak point in the system of the Circles--if a humble Square may  venture to speak of anything Circular as containing any element of  weakness--appears to me to be found in their relations with Women.    As it is of the utmost importance for Society that Irregular births  should be discouraged, it follows that no Woman who has any  Irregularities in her ancestry is a fit partner for one who desires  that his posterity should rise by regular degrees in the social scale.    Now the Irregularity of a Male is a matter of measurement; but as all  Women are straight, and therefore visibly Regular so to speak, one has  to devise some other means of ascertaining what I may call their  invisible Irregularity, that is to say their potential Irregularities  as regards possible offspring.  This is effected by carefully-kept  pedigrees, which are preserved and supervised by the State; and without  a certified pedigree no Woman is allowed to marry.    Now it might have been supposed the a Circle--proud of his ancestry and  regardful for a posterity which might possibly issue hereafter in a  Chief Circle--would be more careful than any other to choose a wife who  had no blot on her escutcheon.  But it is not so.  The care in choosing  a Regular wife appears to diminish as one rises in the social scale.  Nothing would induce an aspiring Isosceles, who has hopes of generating  an Equilateral Son, to take a wife who reckoned a single Irregularity  among her Ancestors; a Square or Pentagon, who is confident that his  family is steadily on the rise, does not inquire above the  five-hundredth generation; a Hexagon or Dodecagon is even more careless  of the wife's pedigree; but a Circle has been known deliberately to  take a wife who has had an Irregular Great-Grandfather, and all because  of some slight superiority of lustre, or because of the charms of a low  voice--which, with us, even more than with you, is thought \"an  excellent thing in a Woman.\"    Such ill-judged marriages are, as might be expected, barren, if they do  not result in positive Irregularity or in diminution of sides; but none  of these evils have hitherto provided sufficiently deterrent.  The loss  of a few sides in a highly-developed Polygon is not easily noticed, and  is sometimes compensated by a successful operation in the  Neo-Therapeutic Gymnasium, as I have described above; and the Circles  are too much disposed to acquiesce in infecundity as a law of the  superior development.  Yet, if this evil be not arrested, the gradual  diminution of the Circular class may soon become more rapid, and the  time may not be far distant when, the race being no longer able to  produce a Chief Circle, the Constitution of Flatland must fall.    One other word of warning suggest itself to me, though I cannot so  easily mention a remedy; and this also refers to our relations with  Women.  About three hundred years ago, it was decreed by the Chief  Circle that, since women are deficient in Reason but abundant in  Emotion, they ought no longer to be treated as rational, nor receive  any mental education.  The consequence was that they were no longer  taught to read, nor even to master Arithmetic enough to enable them to  count the angles of their husband or children; and hence they sensibly  declined during each generation in intellectual power.  And this system  of female non-education or quietism still prevails.    My fear is that, with the best intentions, this policy has been carried  so far as to react injuriously on the Male Sex.    For the consequence is that, as things now are, we Males have to lead a  kind of bi-lingual, and I may almost say bimental, existence.  With  Women, we speak of \"love,\" \"duty,\" \"right,\" \"wrong,\" \"pity,\" \"hope,\"  and other irrational and emotional conceptions, which have no  existence, and the fiction of which has no object except to control  feminine exuberances; but among ourselves, and in our books, we have an  entirely different vocabulary and I may also say, idiom.  \"Love\" them  becomes \"the anticipation of benefits\"; \"duty\" becomes \"necessity\" or  \"fitness\"; and other words are correspondingly transmuted.  Moreover,  among Women, we use language implying the utmost deference for their  Sex; and they fully believe that the Chief Circle Himself is not more  devoutly adored by us than they are:  but behind their backs they are  both regarded and spoken of--by all but the very young--as being little  better than \"mindless organisms.\"    Our Theology also in the Women's chambers is entirely different from  our Theology elsewhere.    Now my humble fear is that this double training, in language as well as  in thought, imposes somewhat too heavy a burden upon the young,  especially when, at the age of three years old, they are taken from the  maternal care and taught to unlearn the old language--except for the  purpose of repeating it in the presence of the Mothers and Nurses--and  to learn the vocabulary and idiom of science.  Already methinks I  discern a weakness in the grasp of mathematical truth at the present  time as compared with the more robust intellect of our ancestors three  hundred years ago.  I say nothing of the possible danger if a Woman  should ever surreptitiously learn to read and convey to her Sex the  result of her perusal of a single popular volume; nor of the  possibility that the indiscretion or disobedience of some infant Male  might reveal to a Mother the secrets of the logical dialect.  On the  simple ground of the enfeebling of the male intellect, I rest this  humble appeal to the highest Authorities to reconsider the regulations  of Female education.          PART II      OTHER WORLDS      \"O brave new worlds, That have such people in them!\"          SECTION 13  How I had a Vision of Lineland      It was the last day but one of the 1999th year of our era, and the  first day of the Long Vacation.  Having amused myself till a late hour  with my favourite recreation of Geometry, I had retired to rest with an  unsolved problem in my mind.  In the night I had a dream.    I saw before me a vast multitude of small Straight Lines (which I  naturally assumed to be Women) interspersed with other Beings still  smaller and of the nature of lustrous points--all moving to and fro in  one and the same Straight Line, and, as nearly as I could judge, with  the same velocity.    A noise of confused, multitudinous chirping or twittering issued from  them at intervals as long as they were moving; but sometimes they  ceased from motion, and then all was silence.    Approaching one of the largest of what I thought to be Women, I  accosted her, but received no answer.  A second and third appeal on my  part were equally ineffectual.  Losing patience at what appeared to me  intolerable rudeness, I brought my mouth to a position full in front of  her mouth so as to intercept her motion, and loudly repeated my  question, \"Woman, what signifies this concourse, and this strange and  confused chirping, and this monotonous motion to and fro in one and the  same Straight Line?\"    \"I am no Woman,\" replied the small Line:  \"I am the Monarch of the  world.  But thou, whence intrudest thou into my realm of Lineland?\"  Receiving this abrupt reply, I begged pardon if I had in any way  startled or molested his Royal Highness; and describing myself as a  stranger I besought the King to give me some account of his dominions.  But I had the greatest possible difficulty in obtaining any information  on points that really interested me; for the Monarch could not refrain  from constantly assuming that whatever was familiar to him must also be  known to me and that I was simulating ignorance in jest.  However, by  preserving questions I elicited the following facts:    It seemed that this poor ignorant Monarch--as he called himself--was  persuaded that the Straight Line which he called his Kingdom, and in  which he passed his existence, constituted the whole of the world, and  indeed the whole of Space.  Not being able either to move or to see,  save in his Straight Line, he had no conception of anything out of it.  Though he had heard my voice when I first addressed him, the sounds had  come to him in a manner so contrary to his experience that he had made  no answer, \"seeing no man,\" as he expressed it, \"and hearing a voice as  it were from my own intestines.\"  Until the moment when I placed my  mouth in his World, he had neither seen me, nor heard anything except  confused sounds beating against, what I called his side, but what he  called his INSIDE or STOMACH; nor had he even now the least conception  of the region from which I had come.  Outside his World, or Line, all  was a blank to him; nay, not even a blank, for a blank implies Space;  say, rather, all was non-existent.    His subjects--of whom the small Lines were men and the Points  Women--were all alike confined in motion and eyesight to that single  Straight Line, which was their World.  It need scarcely be added that  the whole of their horizon was limited to a Point; nor could any one  ever see anything but a Point.  Man, woman, child, thing--each as a  Point to the eye of a Linelander.  Only by the sound of the voice could  sex or age be distinguished.  Moreover, as each individual occupied the  whole of the narrow path, so to speak, which constituted his Universe,  and no one could move to the right or left to make way for passers by,  it followed that no Linelander could ever pass another.  Once  neighbours, always neighbours.  Neighbourhood with them was like  marriage with us.  Neighbours remained neighbours till death did them  part.    Such a life, with all vision limited to a Point, and all motion to a  Straight Line, seemed to me inexpressibly dreary; and I was surprised  to note that vivacity and cheerfulness of the King.  Wondering whether  it was possible, amid circumstances so unfavourable to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9791"],[0,"Harrigan (#10)"],[1,"is  packed with fool ideas. Eat your fish an' don't spoil the appetites of  others.\"    He turned to Kate.    \"These eggs are new-laid--they're--they're not more than twenty-four  hours old.\"    His glance dared McTee to doubt the statement. The captain accepted the  challenge.    \"I suppose you watched 'em being laid, Harrigan?\"    Harrigan sneered.    \"I can tell by the taste partly and partly\"--here he cracked the shell  of another egg and, stripping it off, held up the little white oval to  the light--\"and partly by the color. It's dead white, isn't it?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"That shows it's fresh. If there was a bit of blue in it, it'd be  stale.\"    McTee breathed hard.    \"You win,\" he said. \"You ought to be on the stage, Harrigan.\"    But Harrigan was deep in another egg. Kate watched the two with covert  glances, amazed, wondering. They had saved each other from death at  sea, and now they were quarreling bitterly over the qualities of eggs.    And not eggs alone, for McTee, not to be outdone in courtesy, passed a  handful of his shellfish to Harrigan. The Irishman regarded the fish  and then McTee with cold disgust.    \"D'you really think I'm crazy enough to eat one of these?\" he queried.    Black McTee was black indeed as he glowered at the big Irishman.    \"Open up; let's hear what you got to say about these shellfish,\" he  demanded.    Harrigan announced laconically: \"Scurvy.\"    \"What?\" This from Kate and McTee at one breath.    \"Sure. There ain't any salt in 'em. No salt is as bad as too much salt.  A friend of mine was once in a place where he couldn't get any salt  food, an' he ate a lot of these shellfish. What was the result? Scurvy!  He hasn't a tooth in his head today. An' he's only thirty.\"    \"Why didn't you tell me?\" cried Kate indignantly, and she laid a  tentative finger against her white teeth, as if expecting to find them  loose.    \"I didn't want to hurt McTee's feelin's. Besides, maybe a few of them  won't hurt you--much!\"    McTee suddenly burst into laughter, but there was little mirth in the  sound.    \"Maybe you know these are the great blue clams that are famous for  their salt.\"    \"Really?\" said Kate, greatly relieved.    \"Yes,\" went on McTee, his eyes wandering slightly. \"This species of  clam has an unusual organ by which it extracts some of the salt from  the sea water while taking its food. Look here!\"    He held up a shell and indicated a blue-green spot on the inside.    \"You see that color? That's what gives these clams their name and this  is also the place where the salt deposit forms. This clam has a high  percentage of salt--more than any other.\"    Harrigan, sending a bitter side glance at McTee, rose to bring some  more wood, for it was imperative that they should keep the fire burning  always.    \"I'm so glad,\" said Kate, \"that we have both the eggs and the clams to  rely on. At least they will keep us from starving in this terrible  place.\"    \"H'm. I'm not so sure about the eggs.\"    He eyed them with a watering mouth, for his raging hunger had not been  in the least appeased by the shellfish.    \"But I'll try one just to keep you company.\"    He peeled away the shell and swallowed the egg hastily, lest Harrigan,  returning, should see that he had changed his mind.    \"Maybe the eggs are all right,\" he admitted as soon as he could speak,  and he picked up another, \"but between you and me, I'll confess that I  shall not pay much attention to what Harrigan has to say. He's never  been to sea before. You can't expect a landlubber to understand all the  conditions of a life like this.\"    But a new thought which was gradually forming in her brain made Kate  reserve judgment. Harrigan came back and placed a few more sticks of  wood on the fire.    \"I can't understand,\" said Kate, \"how you could make a fire without a  sign of a match.\"    \"That's simple,\" said McTee easily. \"When a man has traveled about as  much as I have, he has to pick up all sorts of unusual ways of doing  things. The way we made that fire was to--\"    \"The way _we_ made it?\" interjected Harrigan with bitter emphasis.    Kate frowned as she glanced from one to the other. There was the same  deep hostility in their eyes which she had noticed when they faced each  other in the captain's cabin aboard the _Mary Rogers_.    \"An' why were ye sittin' prayin' for fire with the gir-rl thremblin'  and freezin' to death in yer ar-rms if ye knew so well how to be makin'  one?\"    \"Hush--Dan,\" said Kate; for the fire of anger blew high.    McTee started.    \"You know each other pretty well, eh?\"    \"Tut, tut!\" said Harrigan airily. \"You can't expect a slip of a girl to  be calling a black man like _you_ by the front name?\"    McTee moistened his white lips. He rose.    \"I'm going for a walk--I always do after eating.\"    And he strode off down the beach. Harrigan instantly secured a handful  of the shellfish.    \"Speakin' of salt,\" he said apologetically, \"I'll have to try a couple  of these to be sure that the captain's right. I can tell by a taste or  two.\"    He pried open one of the shells and ate the contents hastily, keeping  one eye askance against the return of McTee.    \"Maybe he's right about these shellfish,\" he pronounced judicially,  \"but it's a hard thing an' a dangerous thing to take the word of a man  like McTee--he's that hasty. We must go easy on believin' what he says,  Kate.\"          CHAPTER 12      Then understanding flooded Kate's mind like waves of light in a dark  room. She tilted back her head and laughed, laughed heartily, laughed  till the tears brimmed her eyes. The gloomy scowl of Harrigan stopped  her at last. As her mirth died out, the tall form of McTee appeared  suddenly before them with his arms crossed. Where they touched his  breast, the muscles spread out to a giant size. He was turned toward  her, but the gleam of his eye fell full upon Harrigan.    \"I suppose,\" said McTee, and his teeth clicked after each word like the  bolt of a rifle shot home, \"I suppose that you were laughing at me?\"    The Irishman rose and faced the Scotchman, his head thrust forward and  a devil in his eyes.    \"An' what if we were, Misther McTee?\" he purred. \"An' what if we  wer-r-re, I'm askin'?\"    Kate leaped to her feet and sprang between them.    \"Is there anything we can do,\" she broke in hurriedly, \"to get away  from the island?\"    \"A raft?\" suggested Harrigan.    McTee smiled his contempt.    \"A raft? And how would you cut down the trees to make it?\"    \"Burn 'em down with a circle of fire at the bottom.\"    \"And then set green logs afloat? And how fasten 'em together, even  supposing we could burn them down and drag them to the water? No,  there's no way of getting off the island unless a boat passes and  catches a glimpse of our fire.\"    \"Then we'll have to move this fire to the top of the hill,\" said  Harrigan.    \"Suppose we go now and look over the hill and see what dry wood is near  it,\" said McTee.    \"Good.\"    Something in their eagerness had a meaning for Kate.    \"Would you both leave me?\" she reproached them.    \"It was McTee suggested it,\" said Harrigan.    McTee favored his comrade with a glance that would have made any other  man give ground. It merely made Harrigan grin.    \"We'll draw straws for who goes and who stays,\" said McTee.    Kate picked up two bits of wood.    \"The short one stays,\" she said.    \"Draw,\" said Harrigan in a low voice.    \"I was taught manners young,\" said McTee. \"After you.\"    They exchanged glares again. The whole sense of her power over these  giants came home to her as she watched them fighting their duel of the  eyes.    \"You suggested it,\" she said to McTee.    He stepped forward with an expression as grim as that of a prize  fighter facing an antagonist of unknown prowess. Once and again his  hand hovered above the sticks before he drew.    \"You've chosen the walk to the hill,\" she said, and showed the shorter  stick. \"Do you mind?\"    \"No,\" mocked Harrigan, \"he always walks after meals.\"    Their eyes dwelt almost fondly upon each other. They were both men  after the other's heart. Then the Scotchman turned and strode away.    Kate watched Harrigan suspiciously, but his eyes, following McTee, were  gentle and dreamy.    \"Ah,\" he murmured, \"there's a jewel of a man.\"    \"Do you like him so much?\"    \"Do I like him? Me dear, I love the man; I'll break his head with more  joy than a shtarvin' man cracks a nut!\"    He recovered himself instantly.    \"I didn't mean that--I--\"    \"Dan, you and McTee have planned to fight!\"    He growled: \"If a man told me that, I'd say he was a liar.\"    \"Yes; but you won't lie to a girl, Harrigan.\"    She rose and faced him, reaching up to lay her hands on his thick  shoulders.    \"Will you give me your promise as an honest man to try to avoid a fight  with him?\"    For she saw death in it if they met alone; certainly death for one, and  perhaps for both.    \"Kate, would you ask a tree to promise to avoid the lightning?\"    She caught a little breath through set teeth in her angry impatience,  then: \"Dan, you're like a naughty boy. Can't you be reasonable?\"    Despite her wrath, she noticed a quick change in his face. The blue of  his eyes was no longer cold and incurious, but lighted, warm, and  marvelously deep.    And she said rapidly, making her voice cold to quell the uneasy, rising  fire behind his eyes: \"If you have made McTee angry, aren't you man  enough to smooth things over--to ask his pardon?\"    He answered vaguely: \"Beg his pardon?\"    \"Why is that so impossible? For my sake, Dan!\"    The light went out of his face as if a candle had been snuffed.    \"For you, Kate?\"    Then she understood her power fully for the first time, and found the  thing which she must do.    \"For me. I--I--\"    She let her head droop, and then glanced up as if beseeching him to ask  no questions.    \"Look me square in the eye--so!\"    He caught her beneath the chin with a grip that threatened a bruise,  and his eyes"]]]
