Here then are the relation, agreement,  government, and arrangement, of words in sentences; and these make up the  whole of syntax--but not the whole of grammar. To this one part of grammar,  therefore, the relation of words is central and fundamental; and in the  other parts also, there are some things to which the consideration of it is  incidental; but there are many more, like spelling, pronunciation,  derivation, and whatsoever belongs merely to letters, syllables, and the  forms of words, with which it has, in fact, no connexion. The relation of  words, therefore, should be clearly and fully explained in its proper  place, under the head of syntax; but the general idea of grammar will not  be brought nearer to truth, by making it to be \"the art of _expressing the  relations_ of things in construction,\" &c., according to the foregoing  definition.    12. The term _grammar_ is derived from the Greek word [Greek: gramma], a  letter. The art or science to which this term is applied, had its origin,  not in cursory speech, but in the practice of writing; and speech, which is  first in the order of nature, is last with reference to grammar. The matter  or common subject of grammar, is language in general; which, being of two  kinds, _spoken_ and _written_, consists of certain combinations either of  sounds or of visible signs, employed for the expression of thought. Letters  and sounds, though often heedlessly confounded in the definitions given of  vowels, consonants, &c., are, in their own nature, very different things.  They address themselves to different senses; the former, to the sight; the  latter, to the hearing. Yet, by a peculiar relation arbitrarily established  between them, and in consequence of an almost endless variety in the  combinations of either, they coincide in a most admirable manner, to effect  the great object for which language was bestowed or invented; namely, to  furnish a sure medium for the communication of thought, and the  preservation of knowledge.    13. All languages, however different, have many things in common. There are  points of a philosophical character, which result alike from the analysis  of any language, and are founded on the very nature of human thought, and  that of the sounds or other signs which are used to express it. When such  principles alone are taken as the subject of inquiry, and are treated, as  they sometimes have been, without regard to any of the idioms of particular  languages, they constitute what is called General, Philosophical, or  Universal Grammar. But to teach, with Lindley Murray and some others, that  \"Grammar may be considered as _consisting of two species_, Universal and  Particular,\" and that the latter merely \"applies those general principles  to a particular language,\" is to adopt a twofold absurdity at the  outset.[2] For every cultivated language has its particular grammar, in  which whatsoever is universal, is necessarily included; but of which,  universal or general principles form only a part, and that comparatively  small. We find therefore in grammar no \"two species\" of the same genus; nor  is the science or art, as commonly defined and understood, susceptible of  division into any proper and distinct sorts, except with reference to  different languages--as when we speak of Greek, Latin, French, or English  grammar.    14. There is, however, as I have suggested, a certain science or philosophy  of language, which has been denominated Universal Grammar; being made up of  those points only, in which many or all of the different languages  preserved in books, are found to coincide. All speculative minds are fond  of generalization; and, in the vastness of the views which may thus be  taken of grammar, such may find an entertainment which they never felt in  merely learning to speak and write grammatically. But the pleasure of such  contemplations is not the earliest or the most important fruit of the  study. The first thing is, to know and understand the grammatical  construction of our own language. Many may profit by this acquisition, who  extend not their inquiries to the analogies or the idioms of other tongues.  It is true, that every item of grammatical doctrine is the more worthy to  be known and regarded, in proportion as it approaches to universality. But  the principles of all practical grammar, whether universal or particular,  common or peculiar, must first be learned in their application to some one  language, before they can be distinguished into such classes; and it is  manifest, both from reason and from experience, that the youth of any  nation not destitute of a good book for the purpose, may best acquire a  knowledge of those principles, from the grammatical study of their native  tongue.    15. Universal or Philosophical Grammar is a large field for speculation and  inquiry, and embraces many things which, though true enough in themselves,  are unfit to be incorporated with any system of practical grammar, however  comprehensive its plan. Many authors have erred here. With what is merely  theoretical, such a system should have little to do. Philosophy, dealing in  generalities, resolves speech not only as a whole into its constituent  parts and separable elements, as anatomy shows the use and adaptation of  the parts and joints of the human body; but also as a composite into its  matter and form, as one may contemplate that same body in its entireness,  yet as consisting of materials, some solid and some fluid, and these  curiously modelled to a particular figure. Grammar, properly so called,  requires only the former of these analyses; and in conducting the same, it  descends to the thousand minute particulars which are necessary to be known  in practice. Nor are such things to be despised as trivial and low:  ignorance of what is common and elementary, is but the more disgraceful for  being ignorance of mere rudiments. \"Wherefore,\" says Quintilian, \"they are  little to be respected, who represent this art as mean and barren; in  which, unless you faithfully lay the foundation for the future orator,  whatever superstructure you raise will tumble into ruins. It is an art,  necessary to the young, pleasant to the old, the sweet companion of the  retired, and one which in reference to every kind of study has in itself  more of utility than of show. Let no one therefore despise as  inconsiderable the elements of grammar. Not because it is a great thing, to  distinguish consonants from vowels, and afterwards divide them into  semivowels and mutes; but because, to those who enter the interior parts of  this temple of science, there will appear in many things a great subtilty,  which is fit not only to sharpen the wits of youth, but also to exercise  the loftiest erudition and science.\"--_De Institutione Oratoria_, Lib. i,  Cap. iv.    16. Again, of the arts which spring from the composition of language. Here  the art of logic, aiming solely at conviction, addresses the understanding  with cool deductions of unvarnished truth; rhetoric, designing to move, in  some particular direction, both the judgement and the sympathies of men,  applies itself to the affections in order to persuade; and poetry, various  in its character and tendency, solicits the imagination, with a view to  delight, and in general also to instruct. But grammar, though intimately  connected with all these, and essential to them in practice, is still too  distinct from each to be identified with any of them. In regard to dignity  and interest, these higher studies seem to have greatly the advantage over  particular grammar; but who is willing to be an ungrammatical poet, orator,  or logician? For him I do not write. But I would persuade my readers, that  an acquaintance with that grammar which respects the genius of their  vernacular tongue, is of primary importance to all who would cultivate a  literary taste, and is a necessary introduction to the study of other  languages. And it may here be observed, for the encouragement of the  student, that as grammar is essentially the same thing in all languages, he  who has well mastered that of his own, has overcome more than half the  difficulty of learning another; and he whose knowledge of words is the most  extensive, has the fewest obstacles to encounter in proceeding further.    17. It was the \"original design\" of grammar, says Dr. Adam, to facilitate  \"the acquisition of languages;\" and, of all practical treatises on the  subject, this is still the main purpose. In those books which are to  prepare the learner to translate from one tongue into another, seldom is  any thing else attempted. In those also which profess to explain the right  use of vernacular speech, must the same purpose be ever paramount, and the  \"original design\" be kept in view. But the grammarian may teach many things  incidentally. One cannot learn a language, without learning at the same  time a great many opinions, facts, and principles, of some kind or other,  which are necessarily embodied in it. For all language proceeds from, and  is addressed to, the understanding; and he that perceives not the meaning  of what he reads, makes no acquisition even of the language itself. To the  science of grammar, the _nature of the ideas_ conveyed by casual examples,  is not very essential: to the learner, it is highly important. The best  thoughts in the best diction should furnish the models for youthful study  and imitation; because such language is not only the most worthy to be  remembered, but the most easy to be understood. A distinction is also to be  made between use and abuse. In nonsense, absurdity, or falsehood, there can  never be any grammatical authority; because, however language may be  abused, the usage which gives law to speech, is still that usage which is  founded upon the _common sense_ of mankind.    18. Grammar appeals to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11620"],[0,"My Brilliant Career (#11)"],[1,"once or twice to make  myself look nice by dressing prettily, but, by my own judgment,  considering I looked as ugly as ever, I had given it up as a bad job.    The time which I should have spent in arranging my toilet passed in  gazing at my mother's portrait. It was one of the loveliest faces  imaginable. The features may not have been perfect according to rule of  thumb, but the expression was simply angelic--sweet, winning, gentle,  and happy. I turned from the contemplation of it to another  photograph--one of my father--in a silver frame on the dressing-table.  This, too, was a fine countenance, possessed of well-cut features and  refined expression. This was the prince who had won Lucy Bossier from  her home. I looked around my pretty bedroom--it had been my mother's in  the days of her maidenhood. In an exclusive city boarding-school, and  amid the pleasant surroundings of this home, her youth had been spent.    I thought of a man and his wife at Possum Gully. The man was blear-eyed,  disreputable in appearance, and failed to fulfil his duties as a father  and a citizen. The woman was work-roughened and temper-soured by endless  care and an unavailing struggle against poverty. Could that pair  possibly be identical with this?    This was life as proved by my parents! What right had I to expect any  better yield from it? I shut my eyes and shuddered at the possibilities  and probabilities of my future. It was for this that my mother had  yielded up her youth, freedom, strength; for this she had sacrificed the  greatest possession of woman.    Here I made my way to the dining-room, where grannie was waiting for me  and gave me another hug.    \"Come here, child, and sit beside me near the fire; but first let me  have a look at you,\" and she held me at arm's length.    \"Dear, oh, dear, what a little thing you are, and not a bit like any of  your relations! I am glad your skin is so nice and clear; all my  children had beautiful complexions. Goodness me, I never saw such hair!  A plait thicker than my arm and almost to your knees! It is that  beautiful bright brown like your aunt's. Your mother's was flaxen. I  must see your hair loose when you are going to bed. There is nothing I  admire so much as a beautiful head of hair.\"    The maid announced that dinner was ready, grannie vigorously rang a  little bell, aunt Helen, a lady, and a gentleman appeared from the  drawing-room, and Mr Hawden came in from the back. I discovered that the  lady and gentleman were a neighbouring squatter and a new governess he  was taking home. Grannie, seeing them pass that afternoon in the rain,  had gone out and prevailed upon them to spend the night at Caddagat.    Mr Hawden took no notice of me now, but showed off to the others for my  benefit. After dinner we had music and singing in the drawing-room. I  was enjoying it immensely, but grannie thought I had better go to bed,  as I had been travelling since about midnight last night. I was neither  tired nor sleepy, but knew it useless to protest, so bade every one good  night and marched off. Mr Hawden acknowledged my salute with great airs  and stiffness, and aunt Helen whispered that she would come and see me  by and by, if I was awake.    Grannie escorted me to my room, and examined my hair. I shook it out for  her inspection. It met with her approval in every way. She pronounced it  beautifully fine, silky, and wavy, and the most wonderful head of hair  she had seen out of a picture.    A noise arose somewhere out in the back premises. Grannie went out to  ascertain the cause of it and did not return to me, so I extinguished my  lamp and sat thinking in the glow of the firelight.    For the first time my thoughts reverted to my leave-taking from home. My  father had kissed me with no more warmth than if I had been leaving for  a day only; my mother had kissed me very coldly, saying shortly, \"It is  to be hoped, Sybylla, that your behaviour to your grandmother will be an  improvement upon what it has ever been to me.\" Gertie was the only one  who had felt any sorrow at parting with me, and I knew that she was of  such a disposition that I would be forgotten in a day or two. They would  never miss me, for I had no place in their affections. True, I was an  undutiful child, and deserved none. I possessed no qualities that would  win either their pride or love, but my heart cried out in love for them.    Would Gertie miss me tonight, as I would have missed her had our  positions been reversed? Not she. Would my absence from the noisy  tea-table cause a blank? I feared not.    I thought of poor mother left toiling at home, and my heart grew heavy;  I failed to remember my father's faults, but thought of his great  patience with me in the years agone, and all my old-time love for him  renewed itself. Why, oh, why, would they not love me a little in return!  Certainly I had never striven to be lovable. But see the love some have  lavished upon them without striving for it! Why was I ugly and nasty and  miserable and useless--without a place in the world?          CHAPTER NINE    Aunt Helen's Recipe      \"Dear me, Sybylla, not in bed yet, and tears, great big tears! Tell me  what is the cause of them.\"    It was aunt Helen's voice; she had entered and lit the lamp.    There was something beautifully sincere and real about aunt Helen. She  never fussed over any one or pretended to sympathize just to make out  how nice she was. She was real, and you felt that no matter what wild or  awful rubbish you talked to her it would never be retailed for any one's  amusement--and, better than all, she never lectured.    She sat down beside me, and I impulsively threw my arms around her neck  and sobbed forth my troubles in a string. How there was no good in the  world, no use for me there, no one loved me or ever could on account of  my hideousness.    She heard me to the end and then said quietly, \"When you are fit to  listen I will talk to you.\"    I controlled myself instantly and waited expectantly. What would she  say? Surely not that tame old yarn anent this world being merely a place  of probation, wherein we were allowed time to fit ourselves for a  beautiful world to come. That old tune may be all very well for old  codgers tottering on the brink of the grave, but to young persons with  youth and romance and good health surging through their veins, it is  most boresome. Would she preach that it was flying in the face of  providence to moan about my appearance? it being one of the greatest  blessings I had, as it would save me from countless temptations to which  pretty girls are born. That was another piece of old croaking of the  job's comforter order, of which I was sick unto death, as I am sure  there is not an ugly person in the world who thinks her lack of beauty a  blessing to her. I need not have feared aunt Helen holding forth in that  strain. She always said something brave and comforting which made me  ashamed of myself and my selfish conceited egotism.    \"I understand you, Sybylla,\" she said slowly and distinctly, \"but you  must not be a coward. There is any amount of love and good in the world,  but you must search for it. Being misunderstood is one of the trials we  all must bear. I think that even the most common-minded person in the  land has inner thoughts and feelings which no one can share with him,  and the higher one's organization the more one must suffer in that  respect. I am acquainted with a great number of young girls, some of  them good and true, but you have a character containing more than any  three of them put together. With this power, if properly managed, you  can gain the almost universal love of your fellows. But you are wild and  wayward, you must curb and strain your spirit and bring it into  subjection, else you will be worse than a person with the emptiest of  characters. You will find that plain looks will not prevent you from  gaining the _friendship_ love of your fellows--the only real love there  is. As for the hot fleeting passion of the man for the maid, which is  wrongfully designated love, I will not tell you not to think of it,  knowing that it is human nature to demand it when arriving at a certain  age; but take this comfort: it as frequently passes by on the other side  of those with well-chiselled features as those with faces of plainer  mould.\"    She turned her face away, sighed, and forgetful of my presence lapsed  into silence. I knew she was thinking of herself.    Love, not _friendship_ love, for anyone knowing her must give her love  and respect, but the other sort of love had passed her by.    Twelve years before I went to Caddagat, when Helen Bossier had been  eighteen and one of the most beautiful and lovable girls in Australia,  there had come to Caddagat on a visit a dashing colonel of the name of  Bell, in the enjoyment of a most extended furlough for the benefit of  his health. He married aunt Helen and took her to some part of America  where his regiment was stationed. I have heard them say she worshipped  Colonel Bell, but in less than a twelvemonth he tired of his lovely  bride, and becoming enamoured of another woman, he tried to obtain a  divorce. On account of his wife's spotless character he was unable to do  this; he therefore deserted her and openly lived with the other woman as  his mistress. This forced aunt Helen to return to Caddagat, and her  mother had induced her to sue for a judicial separation, which was  easily obtained.    When a woman is separated from her husband it is the religion of the  world at large to cast the whole blame on the wife. By reason of her  youth and purity Mrs Bell had not as much to suffer in this way as some  others. But, comparatively speaking, her life was wrecked. She had been  humiliated and outraged in the cruellest way by the man whom she loved  and trusted. He had turned her adrift, neither a wife, widow, nor maid,  and here she was, one of the most estimably"]]]
