[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130"],[0,"Orthodoxy (#11)"],[1,"question of how many beans  make five.         Here is the peculiar perfection of tone and truth in the  nursery tales.  The man of science says, \"Cut the stalk, and the apple  will fall\"; but he says it calmly, as if the one idea really led up  to the other.  The witch in the fairy tale says, \"Blow the horn,  and the ogre's castle will fall\"; but she does not say it as if it  were something in which the effect obviously arose out of the cause.  Doubtless she has given the advice to many champions, and has seen many  castles fall, but she does not lose either her wonder or her reason.  She does not muddle her head until it imagines a necessary mental  connection between a horn and a falling tower.  But the scientific  men do muddle their heads, until they imagine a necessary mental  connection between an apple leaving the tree and an apple reaching  the ground.  They do really talk as if they had found not only  a set of marvellous facts, but a truth connecting those facts.  They do talk as if the connection of two strange things physically  connected them philosophically.  They feel that because one  incomprehensible thing constantly follows another incomprehensible  thing the two together somehow make up a comprehensible thing.  Two black riddles make a white answer.         In fairyland we avoid the word \"law\"; but in the land of science  they are singularly fond of it.  Thus they will call some interesting  conjecture about how forgotten folks pronounced the alphabet,  Grimm's Law.  But Grimm's Law is far less intellectual than  Grimm's Fairy Tales.  The tales are, at any rate, certainly tales;  while the law is not a law.  A law implies that we know the nature  of the generalisation and enactment; not merely that we have noticed  some of the effects.  If there is a law that pick-pockets shall go  to prison, it implies that there is an imaginable mental connection  between the idea of prison and the idea of picking pockets.  And we know what the idea is.  We can say why we take liberty  from a man who takes liberties.  But we cannot say why an egg can  turn into a chicken any more than we can say why a bear could turn  into a fairy prince.  As IDEAS, the egg and the chicken are further  off from each other than the bear and the prince; for no egg in  itself suggests a chicken, whereas some princes do suggest bears.  Granted, then, that certain transformations do happen, it is essential  that we should regard them in the philosophic manner of fairy tales,  not in the unphilosophic manner of science and the \"Laws of Nature.\"  When we are asked why eggs turn to birds or fruits fall in autumn,  we must answer exactly as the fairy godmother would answer  if Cinderella asked her why mice turned to horses or her clothes  fell from her at twelve o'clock. We must answer that it is MAGIC.  It is not a \"law,\" for we do not understand its general formula.  It is not a necessity, for though we can count on it happening  practically, we have no right to say that it must always happen.  It is no argument for unalterable law (as Huxley fancied) that we  count on the ordinary course of things.  We do not count on it;  we bet on it.  We risk the remote possibility of a miracle as we  do that of a poisoned pancake or a world-destroying comet.  We leave it out of account, not because it is a miracle, and therefore  an impossibility, but because it is a miracle, and therefore  an exception.  All the terms used in the science books, \"law,\"  \"necessity,\" \"order,\" \"tendency,\" and so on, are really unintellectual,  because they assume an inner synthesis, which we do not possess.  The only words that ever satisfied me as describing Nature are the  terms used in the fairy books, \"charm,\" \"spell,\" \"enchantment.\"  They express the arbitrariness of the fact and its mystery.  A tree grows fruit because it is a MAGIC tree.  Water runs downhill  because it is bewitched.  The sun shines because it is bewitched.         I deny altogether that this is fantastic or even mystical.  We may have some mysticism later on; but this fairy-tale language  about things is simply rational and agnostic.  It is the only way  I can express in words my clear and definite perception that one  thing is quite distinct from another; that there is no logical  connection between flying and laying eggs.  It is the man who  talks about \"a law\" that he has never seen who is the mystic.  Nay, the ordinary scientific man is strictly a sentimentalist.  He is a sentimentalist in this essential sense, that he is soaked  and swept away by mere associations.  He has so often seen birds  fly and lay eggs that he feels as if there must be some dreamy,  tender connection between the two ideas, whereas there is none.  A forlorn lover might be unable to dissociate the moon from lost love;  so the materialist is unable to dissociate the moon from the tide.  In both cases there is no connection, except that one has seen  them together.  A sentimentalist might shed tears at the smell  of apple-blossom, because, by a dark association of his own,  it reminded him of his boyhood.  So the materialist professor (though  he conceals his tears) is yet a sentimentalist, because, by a dark  association of his own, apple-blossoms remind him of apples.  But the  cool rationalist from fairyland does not see why, in the abstract,  the apple tree should not grow crimson tulips; it sometimes does in  his country.         This elementary wonder, however, is not a mere fancy derived  from the fairy tales; on the contrary, all the fire of the fairy  tales is derived from this.  Just as we all like love tales because  there is an instinct of sex, we all like astonishing tales because  they touch the nerve of the ancient instinct of astonishment.  This is proved by the fact that when we are very young children  we do not need fairy tales:  we only need tales.  Mere life is  interesting enough.  A child of seven is excited by being told that  Tommy opened a door and saw a dragon.  But a child of three is excited  by being told that Tommy opened a door.  Boys like romantic tales;  but babies like realistic tales--because they find them romantic.  In fact, a baby is about the only person, I should think, to whom  a modern realistic novel could be read without boring him.  This proves that even nursery tales only echo an almost pre-natal  leap of interest and amazement.  These tales say that apples were  golden only to refresh the forgotten moment when we found that they  were green.  They make rivers run with wine only to make us remember,  for one wild moment, that they run with water.  I have said that this  is wholly reasonable and even agnostic.  And, indeed, on this point  I am all for the higher agnosticism; its better name is Ignorance.  We have all read in scientific books, and, indeed, in all romances,  the story of the man who has forgotten his name.  This man walks  about the streets and can see and appreciate everything; only he  cannot remember who he is.  Well, every man is that man in the story.  Every man has forgotten who he is.  One may understand the cosmos,  but never the ego; the self is more distant than any star.  Thou shalt love the Lord thy God; but thou shalt not know thyself.  We are all under the same mental calamity; we have all forgotten  our names.  We have all forgotten what we really are.  All that we  call common sense and rationality and practicality and positivism  only means that for certain dead levels of our life we forget  that we have forgotten.  All that we call spirit and art and  ecstasy only means that for one awful instant we remember that  we forget.         But though (like the man without memory in the novel) we walk the  streets with a sort of half-witted admiration, still it is admiration.  It is admiration in English and not only admiration in Latin.  The wonder has a positive element of praise.  This is the next  milestone to be definitely marked on our road through fairyland.  I shall speak in the next chapter about optimists and pessimists  in their intellectual aspect, so far as they have one.  Here I am only  trying to describe the enormous emotions which cannot be described.  And the strongest emotion was that life was as precious as it  was puzzling.  It was an ecstasy because it was an adventure;  it was an adventure because it was an opportunity.  The goodness  of the fairy tale was not affected by the fact that there might be  more dragons than princesses; it was good to be in a fairy tale.  The test of all happiness is gratitude; and I felt grateful,  though I hardly knew to whom.  Children are grateful when Santa  Claus puts in their stockings gifts of toys or sweets.  Could I  not be grateful to Santa Claus when he put in my stockings the gift  of two miraculous legs?  We thank people for birthday presents  of cigars and slippers.  Can I thank no one for the birthday present  of birth?         There were, then, these two first feelings, indefensible and  indisputable.  The world was a shock, but it was not merely shocking;  existence was a surprise, but it was a pleasant surprise.  In fact,  all my first views were exactly uttered in a riddle that stuck  in my brain from boyhood.  The question was, \"What did the first  frog say?\"  And the answer was, \"Lord, how you made me jump!\"  That says succinctly all that I am saying.  God made the frog jump;  but the frog prefers jumping.  But when these things are settled  there enters the second great principle of the fairy philosophy.         Any one can see it who will simply read \"Grimm's Fairy Tales\"  or the fine collections of Mr. Andrew Lang.  For the pleasure  of pedantry I will call it the Doctrine of Conditional Joy.  Touchstone talked of much virtue in an \"if\"; according to elfin ethics  all virtue is in an \"if.\"  The note of the fairy utterance always is,  \"You may live in a palace of gold and sapphire, if you do not say  the word `cow'\"; or \"You may live happily with the King'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1300"],[0,"Riders of the Purple Sage (#11)"],[1," went on, but he believed that it had  stopped. Otherwise she would surely not have lived so long. He marked  the entrance of the bullet, and concluded that it had just touched the  upper lobe of her lung. Perhaps the wound in the lung had also closed.  As he began to wash the blood stains from her breast and carefully  rebandage the wound, he was vaguely conscious of a strange, grave  happiness in the thought that she might live.    Broad daylight and a hint of sunshine high on the cliff-rim to the west  brought him to consideration of what he had better do. And while busy  with his few camp tasks he revolved the thing in his mind. It would not  be wise for him to remain long in his present hiding-place. And if he  intended to follow the cattle trail and try to find the rustlers he had  better make a move at once. For he knew that rustlers, being riders,  would not make much of a day's or night's absence from camp for one  or two of their number; but when the missing ones failed to show up in  reasonable time there would be a search. And Venters was afraid of that.    \"A good tracker could trail me,\" he muttered. \"And I'd be cornered here.  Let's see. Rustlers are a lazy set when they're not on the ride. I'll  risk it. Then I'll change my hiding-place.\"    He carefully cleaned and reloaded his guns. When he rose to go he bent  a long glance down upon the unconscious girl. Then ordering Whitie and  Ring to keep guard, he left the camp.    The safest cover lay close under the wall of the canyon, and here  through the dense thickets Venters made his slow, listening advance  toward the oval. Upon gaining the wide opening he decided to cross it  and follow the left wall till he came to the cattle trail. He scanned  the oval as keenly as if hunting for antelope. Then, stooping, he stole  from one cover to another, taking advantage of rocks and bunches of  sage, until he had reached the thickets under the opposite wall. Once  there, he exercised extreme caution in his surveys of the ground ahead,  but increased his speed when moving. Dodging from bush to bush, he  passed the mouths of two canyons, and in the entrance of a third canyon  he crossed a wash of swift clear water, to come abruptly upon the cattle  trail.    It followed the low bank of the wash, and, keeping it in sight, Venters  hugged the line of sage and thicket. Like the curves of a serpent the  canyon wound for a mile or more and then opened into a valley. Patches  of red showed clear against the purple of sage, and farther out on the  level dotted strings of red led away to the wall of rock.    \"Ha, the red herd!\" exclaimed Venters.    Then dots of white and black told him there were cattle of other colors  in this inclosed valley. Oldring, the rustler, was also a rancher.  Venters's calculating eye took count of stock that outnumbered the red  herd.    \"What a range!\" went on Venters. \"Water and grass enough for fifty  thousand head, and no riders needed!\"    After his first burst of surprise and rapid calculation Venters lost no  time there, but slunk again into the sage on his back trail. With the  discovery of Oldring's hidden cattle-range had come enlightenment  on several problems. Here the rustler kept his stock, here was Jane  Withersteen's red herd; here were the few cattle that had disappeared  from the Cottonwoods slopes during the last two years. Until Oldring had  driven the red herd his thefts of cattle for that time had not been  more than enough to supply meat for his men. Of late no drives had been  reported from Sterling or the villages north. And Venters knew that the  riders had wondered at Oldring's inactivity in that particular field.  He and his band had been active enough in their visits to Glaze and  Cottonwoods; they always had gold; but of late the amount gambled  away and drunk and thrown away in the villages had given rise to much  conjecture. Oldring's more frequent visits had resulted in new saloons,  and where there had formerly been one raid or shooting fray in the  little hamlets there were now many. Perhaps Oldring had another range  farther on up the pass, and from there drove the cattle to distant Utah  towns where he was little known But Venters came finally to doubt this.  And, from what he had learned in the last few days, a belief began to  form in Venters's mind that Oldring's intimidations of the villages and  the mystery of the Masked Rider, with his alleged evil deeds, and the  fierce resistance offered any trailing riders, and the rustling of  cattle--these things were only the craft of the rustler-chief to conceal  his real life and purpose and work in Deception Pass.    And like a scouting Indian Venters crawled through the sage of the oval  valley, crossed trail after trail on the north side, and at last entered  the canyon out of which headed the cattle trail, and into which he had  watched the rustlers disappear.    If he had used caution before, now he strained every nerve to force  himself to creeping stealth and to sensitiveness of ear. He crawled  along so hidden that he could not use his eyes except to aid himself in  the toilsome progress through the brakes and ruins of cliff-wall. Yet  from time to time, as he rested, he saw the massive red walls growing  higher and wilder, more looming and broken. He made note of the fact  that he was turning and climbing. The sage and thickets of oak and  brakes of alder gave place to pinyon pine growing out of rocky soil.  Suddenly a low, dull murmur assailed his ears. At first he thought it  was thunder, then the slipping of a weathered slope of rock. But it was  incessant, and as he progressed it filled out deeper and from a murmur  changed into a soft roar.    \"Falling water,\" he said. \"There's volume to that. I wonder if it's the  stream I lost.\"    The roar bothered him, for he could hear nothing else. Likewise,  however, no rustlers could hear him. Emboldened by this and sure that  nothing but a bird could see him, he arose from his hands and knees to  hurry on. An opening in the pinyons warned him that he was nearing the  height of slope.    He gained it, and dropped low with a burst of astonishment. Before him  stretched a short canyon with rounded stone floor bare of grass or sage  or tree, and with curved, shelving walls. A broad rippling stream flowed  toward him, and at the back of the canyon waterfall burst from a wide  rent in the cliff, and, bounding down in two green steps, spread into a  long white sheet.    If Venters had not been indubitably certain that he had entered the  right canyon his astonishment would not have been so great. There had  been no breaks in the walls, no side canyons entering this one where the  rustlers' tracks and the cattle trail had guided him, and, therefore, he  could not be wrong. But here the canyon ended, and presumably the trails  also.    \"That cattle trail headed out of here,\" Venters kept saying to himself.  \"It headed out. Now what I want to know is how on earth did cattle ever  get in here?\"    If he could be sure of anything it was of the careful scrutiny he had  given that cattle track, every hoofmark of which headed straight west.  He was now looking east at an immense round boxed corner of canyon down  which tumbled a thin, white veil of water, scarcely twenty yards wide.  Somehow, somewhere, his calculations had gone wrong. For the first time  in years he found himself doubting his rider's skill in finding tracks,  and his memory of what he had actually seen. In his anxiety to keep  under cover he must have lost himself in this offshoot of Deception  Pass, and thereby in some unaccountable manner, missed the canyon with  the trails. There was nothing else for him to think. Rustlers could not  fly, nor cattle jump down thousand-foot precipices. He was only proving  what the sage-riders had long said of this labyrinthine system of  deceitful canyons and valleys--trails led down into Deception Pass, but  no rider had ever followed them.    On a sudden he heard above the soft roar of the waterfall an unusual  sound that he could not define. He dropped flat behind a stone and  listened. From the direction he had come swelled something that  resembled a strange muffled pounding and splashing and ringing. Despite  his nerve the chill sweat began to dampen his forehead. What might not  be possible in this stonewalled maze of mystery? The unnatural sound  passed beyond him as he lay gripping his rifle and fighting for  coolness. Then from the open came the sound, now distinct and different.  Venters recognized a hobble-bell of a horse, and the cracking of iron on  submerged stones, and the hollow splash of hoofs in water.    Relief surged over him. His mind caught again at realities, and  curiosity prompted him to peep from behind the rock.    In the middle of the stream waded a long string of packed burros driven  by three superbly mounted men. Had Venters met these dark-clothed,  dark-visaged, heavily armed men anywhere in Utah, let alone in this  robbers' retreat, he would have recognized them as rustlers. The  discerning eye of a rider saw the signs of a long, arduous trip. These  men were packing in supplies from one of the northern villages. They  were tired, and their horses were almost played out, and the burros  plodded on, after the manner of their kind when exhausted, faithful and  patient, but as if every weary, splashing, slipping step would be their  last.    All this Venters noted in one glance. After that he watched with a  thrilling eagerness. Straight at the waterfall the rustlers drove the  burros, and straight through the middle, where the water spread into a  fleecy, thin film like dissolving smoke. Following closely, the rustlers  rode into this white mist, showing in bold black relief for an instant,  and then they vanished.    Venters drew a full breath that rushed out in brief and sudden  utterance.    \"Good Heaven! Of all the holes for a rustler!... There's a cavern under  that"]]]
