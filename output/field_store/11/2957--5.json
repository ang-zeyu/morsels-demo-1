The deep arch over this is seriously cracked in  several places, though it has already been much restored. It has an  outer label, which indicates that when it was built in there was then  no porch to protect it. The three orders, or main groups, of mouldings  do not run down on to the capitals, but finish by dying on to a plain  piece of stonework of circular form set immediately upon the capitals.  The Purbeck marble capitals themselves are rather large and heavily  moulded, and the shafts under them are sandstone restorations of  recent date. The west door and the woodwork about it is a poor  specimen of modern ingenuity.    The #South Side# of the church introduces many interesting  varieties of work. These may well be followed in the course of this  description from the west to the east end.    The lowest part of the south-west tower presents a treatment different  from that on the west side. There is here a doorway, and an  additional window. Both are round-arched. The doorway is one of the  most notable pieces of beautiful design on all the exterior of the  building. It is treated solely with variations of the well-known  chevron ornament. The cut work upon it is in no case at all deep, but  the total effect is truly delightful. There is none of the dead,  formal regularity invariable in modern attempts to imitate this type  of work. The voussoirs of the arch are not all of equal size in each  order, and on one member the chevrons are reversed on opposite sides  of the centre stone except for one accidental intermission. The  abacus, nearly six inches deep, has a flat upper part on which a  continuous diaper of Greek crosses has been cut. The lower part is a  plain, hollowed chamfer moulding. Though the small columns in the  jambs are new, and also parts of the inner reveal of the jamb, yet the  old carved capitals are still in position and also the bases. These  capitals bear distinct traces of Byzantine feeling in the design of  them. Above the doorway is a billet-moulded string-course, which stops  against the circular shafts by the buttresses, and forms the sill of  the window. The design of this opening is like that of the one over it  in the next stage, which is similar to that in the same position on  the west face of the tower. But the abaci of its capitals run from the  jambs across to the buttresses, as is the case with those of the  doorway. The billet-moulded sill evidently passed round the tower  completely, before the addition of the angle buttresses, since it  appears again on the north buttress of the west front of the same  tower; and the obvious inference is that there was once a window also  on the west in this same stage at the same level. The window  immediately below the upper division of the tower is of the same date  and character exactly as the one on the west in the like place; and it  should be noticed that the sills of the upper windows run on as  string-courses, which are continued round the circular angle-shafts of  the buttresses.    Passing eastward from the tower, the external #Roof# of the nave  becomes visible. The irregularly waved line of the ridge where the  lead rolls meet, as it were, against the sky, is a pretty indication  of the presence of the aged timbers underneath that support it above  the walls.    The oldest part of the building to be seen from this point is the  strip of walling at the clerestory level. The twelfth-century  round-arched windows are there almost complete. In detail they are  like those of the tower. Two of them, those in the fourth and fifth  bays from the tower, have had later work inserted in the same  openings.    The crest of the wall between the west and the central tower was  renewed in the fourteenth century. It consists of a parapet with a  weathered coping for the top course of stonework, so that the water  might not rest upon it and percolate through the walls. Three courses  below this is a simply moulded string-course, and immediately beneath  is the cusped arcade supported on the course of detached moulded and  shaped corbels. For five feet below the bottom of the corbels the  newer part of the wall is continued. It will be interesting later to  notice the way in which the parapet on the north side of the nave has  been dealt with. The reason for the presence of so much new walling at  this level is no doubt to be found in the fact that the roof timbers  at the time of the second fire were carried down over the walls.    The water from the gutter behind the parapet is carried out on to the  backs of the flying-buttresses by means of holes cut through the  stonework. Into these pipes are passed which convey the water through  to the open gutter channels of the buttresses. The backs of the raking  buttresses, though they are sharply weathered to throw the water from  them quickly, are also covered with lead as a further protection.  These buttresses have carried the thrust of the vaults down-wards with  safety for about six hundred years. But the presence of two distinct  arches under each of them indicates that they have been altered a  little since first they were put up. This was done when it became  necessary to carry their thrust farther out because of the new chapels  that were added long after the vaults were built over the nave. At the  foot of each raking slope is a horizontal piece which runs out until  it comes in contact with the octagon pinnacles of the vertical  exterior buttresses. It should be noted that where the  flying-buttresses meet the vertical wall of the clerestory there is in  some cases a portion of the flat buttressing of the twelfth century  visible.    Between the buttresses of the chapels are four two-light windows, The  outer arch of each of these windows is a beautiful example of late  thirteenth-century moulded detail. The main line of the arch curve is  excellent, and the whole opening between the head, jambs, and sill is  beautifully proportioned. Some fifteenth century tracery remained in  these windows until it was replaced by the present modern work. The  outer arch is in two orders, which are carried by slight attached  shafts, some of which are renewals. The capitals to these are carved,  and have square abaci, rounded at the angle, as they pass over the  capitals. These abaci, which are finely moulded, are not more than  about two and a half inches in depth. The bases of the jamb-shafts are  characteristic of the period during which this work was done. There  are two small rounded mouldings, and one larger one. These rest on the  square, lower part, of the base. Immediately below the sill is a  string-course; and this, as well as the projecting base to the whole  wall, is continued from the side of the tower buttress eastward. Each  is returned round the four buttresses till it stops against the outer  wall of the south walk of the cloisters. The vertical buttresses here  were originally completed with a weathering at a point about half-way  up their present height; and upon this old weathering the upper and  later part of the buttress has been added. This was probably done  during the fourteenth century, about the time that the adjoining  parapet of the aisles, the parapet of the nave, and the re-working of  the upper part of the flying-buttresses was undertaken. This change in  the design involved the removal of the range of pointed gables, by  which the roof over each bay of the aisle was completed southward.  Traces of the earlier gable copings are still bedded in their original  places in the walling. Upon three of these buttresses are remains of  the old gargoyles by which the water from the roofs was carried off.  The use of these is now superseded by the cheap and mean-looking  rain-water heads and pipes.    Close by the parapet of the aisle the square angles of each buttress  are cut off so as to form a base for the octagonal pinnacle above.  These, when in their complete state, were undoubtedly very beautiful;  for besides what can be now seen, it is known that they were once  completed each with a spirelet. Now they have the substitutes  suggested by parsimony to cover their incompleteness. As they are, in  their ruined condition, it may be seen that they were not all finished  in identically the same way. The three sides on the north of the  octagon of each one are left plain and flat. The other five sides are  treated as narrow, recessed panels, formed by the six groups of small  shafts at either angle. Every group has its capital and moulded base.  The capitals in some cases are carved, in others moulded only. Above  each capital is a small carved boss. This, doubtless, was the stop to  some member on the angles of the spirelets. Springing from the  capitals are moulded and cusped arches, which form on either side the  heads of the panelled divisions. The horizontal part of the weathering  of the flying-buttresses is stopped behind the octagons of the  pinnacles.    The parapet has a plain weathered coping, close under which is a  string-course which helps to throw the water clear from the top of the  wall; and two coupes below this one is another moulded string. Each is  about six inches in depth. If is not possible to state more concerning  these parts in detail, since they have been much repaired at various  times.    The stove-pipes which run up the north and south sides of the nave as  smoke-flues for the heating-apparatus do not add to the beauty of the  exterior.    In the fifth bay, eastward from the south-west tower, is the #South  Porch#, which opens directly into the west walk of the cloister.  Early in the nineteenth century it was in a ruinous condition; but  restoration has again given it stability, if not all its old beauty.  The idea of the design, as it is seen from the cloister, is identical  with that of the exterior of the west porch. But in the detail of its  mouldings and other features it is different entirely.

It is easy to condemn this kind of thing, and not very  difficult to refrain from imitation, but it is impossible not to  respect, and Brayle was liked none the less for the weakness which had  so heroic an expression. We wished he were not a fool, but he went on  that way to the end, sometimes hard hit, but always returning to duty  about as good as new.    Of course, it came at last; he who ignores the law of probabilities  challenges an adversary that is seldom beaten. It was at Resaca, in  Georgia, during the movement that resulted in the taking of Atlanta. In  front of our brigade the enemy's line of earthworks ran through open  fields along a slight crest. At each end of this open ground we were  close up to him in the woods, but the clear ground we could not hope to  occupy until night, when darkness would enable us to burrow like moles  and throw up earth. At this point our line was a quarter-mile away in  the edge of a wood. Roughly, we formed a semicircle, the enemy's  fortified line being the chord of the arc.    \"Lieutenant, go tell Colonel Ward to work up as close as he can get  cover, and not to waste much ammunition in unnecessary firing. You may  leave your horse.\"    When the general gave this direction we were in the fringe of the  forest, near the right extremity of the arc. Colonel Ward was at the  left. The suggestion to leave the horse obviously enough meant that  Brayle was to take the longer line, through the woods and among the men.  Indeed, the suggestion was needless; to go by the short route meant  absolutely certain failure to deliver the message. Before anybody could  interpose, Brayle had cantered lightly into the field and the enemy's  works were in crackling conflagration.    \"Stop that damned fool!\" shouted the general.    A private of the escort, with more ambition than brains, spurred forward  to obey, and within ten yards left himself and his horse dead on the  field of honor.    Brayle was beyond recall, galloping easily along, parallel to the enemy  and less than two hundred yards distant. He was a picture to see! His  hat had been blown or shot from his head, and his long, blond hair rose  and fell with the motion of his horse. He sat erect in the saddle,  holding the reins lightly in his left hand, his right hanging carelessly  at his side. An occasional glimpse of his handsome profile as he turned  his head one way or the other proved that the interest which he took in  what was going on was natural and without affectation.    The picture was intensely dramatic, but in no degree theatrical.  Successive scores of rifles spat at him viciously as he came within  range, and our own line in the edge of the timber broke out in visible  and audible defense. No longer regardful of themselves or their orders,  our fellows sprang to their feet, and swarming into the open sent broad  sheets of bullets against the blazing crest of the offending works,  which poured an answering fire into their unprotected groups with deadly  effect. The artillery on both sides joined the battle, punctuating the  rattle and roar with deep, earth-shaking explosions and tearing the air  with storms of screaming grape, which from the enemy's side splintered  the trees and spattered them with blood, and from ours defiled the smoke  of his arms with banks and clouds of dust from his parapet.    My attention had been for a moment drawn to the general combat, but now,  glancing down the unobscured avenue between these two thunderclouds, I  saw Brayle, the cause of the carnage. Invisible now from either side,  and equally doomed by friend and foe, he stood in the shot-swept space,  motionless, his face toward the enemy. At some little distance lay his  horse. I instantly saw what had stopped him.    As topographical engineer I had, early in the day, made a hasty  examination of the ground, and now remembered that at that point was a  deep and sinuous gully, crossing half the field from the enemy's line,  its general course at right angles to it. From where we now were it was  invisible, and Brayle had evidently not known about it. Clearly, it was  impassable. Its salient angles would have afforded him absolute security  if he had chosen to be satisfied with the miracle already wrought in his  favor and leapt into it. He could not go forward, he would not turn  back; he stood awaiting death. It did not keep him long waiting.    By some mysterious coincidence, almost instantaneously as he fell, the  firing ceased, a few desultory shots at long intervals serving rather to  accentuate than break the silence. It was as if both sides had suddenly  repented of their profitless crime. Four stretcher-bearers of ours,  following a sergeant with a white flag, soon afterward moved unmolested  into the field, and made straight for Brayle's body. Several Confederate  officers and men came out to meet them, and with uncovered heads  assisted them to take up their sacred burden. As it was borne toward us  we heard beyond the hostile works fifes and a muffled drum--a dirge. A  generous enemy honored the fallen brave.    Amongst the dead man's effects was a soiled Russia-leather pocketbook.  In the distribution of mementoes of our friend, which the general, as  administrator, decreed, this fell to me.    A year after the close of the war, on my way to California, I opened and  idly inspected it. Out of an overlooked compartment fell a letter  without envelope or address. It was in a woman's handwriting, and began  with words of endearment, but no name.    It had the following date line: \"San Francisco, Cal., July 9, 1862.\" The  signature was \"Darling,\" in marks of quotation. Incidentally, in the  body of the text, the writer's full name was given--Marian Mendenhall.    The letter showed evidence of cultivation and good breeding, but it was  an ordinary love letter, if a love letter can be ordinary. There was not  much in it, but there was something. It was this:    \"Mr. Winters, whom I shall always hate for it, has been telling that at  some battle in Virginia, where he got his hurt, you were seen crouching  behind a tree. I think he wants to injure you in my regard, which he  knows the story would do if I believed it. I could bear to hear of my  soldier lover's death, but not of his cowardice.\"    These were the words which on that sunny afternoon, in a distant region,  had slain a hundred men. Is woman weak?    One evening I called on Miss Mendenhall to return the letter to her. I  intended, also, to tell her what she had done--but not that she did it.  I found her in a handsome dwelling on Rincon Hill. She was beautiful,  well bred--in a word, charming.    \"You knew Lieutenant Herman Brayle,\" I said, rather abruptly. \"You know,  doubtless, that he fell in battle. Among his effects was found this  letter from you. My errand here is to place it in your hands.\"    She mechanically took the letter, glanced through it with deepening  color, and then, looking at me with a smile, said:    \"It is very good of you, though I am sure it was hardly worth while.\"  She started suddenly and changed color. \"This stain,\" she said, \"is it--  surely it is not--\"    \"Madam,\" I said, \"pardon me, but that is the blood of the truest and  bravest heart that ever beat.\"    She hastily flung the letter on the blazing coals. \"Uh! I cannot bear  the sight of blood!\" she said. \"How did he die?\"    I had involuntarily risen to rescue that scrap of paper, sacred even to  me, and now stood partly behind her. As she asked the question she  turned her face about and slightly upward. The light of the burning  letter was reflected in her eyes and touched her cheek with a tinge of  crimson like the stain upon its page. I had never seen anything so  beautiful as this detestable creature.    \"He was bitten by a snake,\" I replied.          THE AFFAIR AT COULTER'S NOTCH    \"Do you think, Colonel, that your brave Coulter would like to put one of  his guns in here?\" the general asked.    He was apparently not altogether serious; it certainly did not seem a  place where any artillerist, however brave, would like to put a gun. The  colonel thought that possibly his division commander meant  good-humoredly to intimate that in a recent conversation between them  Captain Coulter's courage had been too highly extolled.    \"General,\" he replied warmly, \"Coulter would like to put a gun anywhere  within reach of those people,\" with a motion of his hand in the  direction of the enemy.    \"It is the only place,\" said the general. He was serious, then.    The place was a depression, a \"notch,\" in the sharp crest of a hill. It  was a pass, and through it ran a turnpike, which reaching this highest  point in its course by a sinuous ascent through a thin forest made a  similar, though less steep, descent toward the enemy. For a mile to the  left and a mile to the right, the ridge, though occupied by Federal  infantry lying close behind the sharp crest and appearing as if held in  place by atmospheric pressure, was inaccessible to artillery. There was  no place but the bottom of the notch, and that was barely wide enough  for the roadbed. From the Confederate side this point was commanded by  two batteries posted on a slightly lower elevation beyond a creek, and a  half-mile away. All the guns but one were masked by the trees of an  orchard; that one--it seemed a bit of impudence--was on an open lawn  directly in front of a rather grandiose building, the planter's  dwelling. The gun was safe enough in its exposure--but only because the  Federal infantry had been forbidden to fire. Coulter's Notch--it came to  be called so--was not, that pleasant summer afternoon, a place where one  would \"like to put a gun.\"    Three or four dead horses lay there sprawling in the road, three or four  dead men in a trim row at one side of it, and a little back, down the  hill.
