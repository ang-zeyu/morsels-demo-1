And when amongst them looking round I came,  A yellow purse I saw with azure wrought,  That wore a lion's countenance and port.  Then still my sight pursuing its career,  Another I beheld, than blood more red.  A goose display of whiter wing than curd.  And one, who bore a fat and azure swine  Pictur'd on his white scrip, addressed me thus:  \"What dost thou in this deep?  Go now and know,  Since yet thou livest, that my neighbour here  Vitaliano on my left shall sit.  A Paduan with these Florentines am I.  Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming  \"O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch  With the three beaks will bring!\"  This said, he writh'd  The mouth, and loll'd the tongue out, like an ox  That licks his nostrils.  I, lest longer stay  He ill might brook, who bade me stay not long,  Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn'd.       My guide already seated on the haunch  Of the fierce animal I found; and thus  He me encourag'd.  \"Be thou stout; be bold.  Down such a steep flight must we now descend!  Mount thou before:  for that no power the tail  May have to harm thee, I will be i' th' midst.\"       As one, who hath an ague fit so near,  His nails already are turn'd blue, and he  Quivers all o'er, if he but eye the shade;  Such was my cheer at hearing of his words.  But shame soon interpos'd her threat, who makes  The servant bold in presence of his lord.       I settled me upon those shoulders huge,  And would have said, but that the words to aid  My purpose came not, \"Look thou clasp me firm!\"       But he whose succour then not first I prov'd,  Soon as I mounted, in his arms aloft,  Embracing, held me up, and thus he spake:  \"Geryon! now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres  Of ample circuit, easy thy descent.  Think on th' unusual burden thou sustain'st.\"       As a small vessel, back'ning out from land,  Her station quits; so thence the monster loos'd,  And when he felt himself at large, turn'd round  There where the breast had been, his forked tail.  Thus, like an eel, outstretch'd at length he steer'd,  Gath'ring the air up with retractile claws.       Not greater was the dread when Phaeton  The reins let drop at random, whence high heaven,  Whereof signs yet appear, was wrapt in flames;  Nor when ill-fated Icarus perceiv'd,  By liquefaction of the scalded wax,  The trusted pennons loosen'd from his loins,  His sire exclaiming loud, \"Ill way thou keep'st!\"  Than was my dread, when round me on each part  The air I view'd, and other object none  Save the fell beast.  He slowly sailing, wheels  His downward motion, unobserv'd of me,  But that the wind, arising to my face,  Breathes on me from below.  Now on our right  I heard the cataract beneath us leap  With hideous crash; whence bending down to' explore,  New terror I conceiv'd at the steep plunge:  For flames I saw, and wailings smote mine ear:  So that all trembling close I crouch'd my limbs,  And then distinguish'd, unperceiv'd before,  By the dread torments that on every side  Drew nearer, how our downward course we wound.       As falcon, that hath long been on the wing,  But lure nor bird hath seen, while in despair  The falconer cries, \"Ah me! thou stoop'st to earth!\"  Wearied descends, and swiftly down the sky  In many an orbit wheels, then lighting sits  At distance from his lord in angry mood;  So Geryon lighting places us on foot  Low down at base of the deep-furrow'd rock,  And, of his burden there discharg'd, forthwith  Sprang forward, like an arrow from the string.        CANTO XVIII    THERE is a place within the depths of hell  Call'd Malebolge, all of rock dark-stain'd  With hue ferruginous, e'en as the steep  That round it circling winds.  Right in the midst  Of that abominable region, yawns  A spacious gulf profound, whereof the frame  Due time shall tell.  The circle, that remains,  Throughout its round, between the gulf and base  Of the high craggy banks, successive forms  Ten trenches, in its hollow bottom sunk.       As where to guard the walls, full many a foss  Begirds some stately castle, sure defence  Affording to the space within, so here  Were model'd these; and as like fortresses  E'en from their threshold to the brink without,  Are flank'd with bridges; from the rock's low base  Thus flinty paths advanc'd, that 'cross the moles  And dikes, struck onward far as to the gulf,  That in one bound collected cuts them off.  Such was the place, wherein we found ourselves  From Geryon's back dislodg'd. The bard to left  Held on his way, and I behind him mov'd.       On our right hand new misery I saw,  New pains, new executioners of wrath,  That swarming peopled the first chasm.  Below  Were naked sinners.  Hitherward they came,  Meeting our faces from the middle point,  With us beyond but with a larger stride.  E'en thus the Romans, when the year returns  Of Jubilee, with better speed to rid  The thronging multitudes, their means devise  For such as pass the bridge; that on one side  All front toward the castle, and approach  Saint Peter's fane, on th' other towards the mount.       Each divers way along the grisly rock,  Horn'd demons I beheld, with lashes huge,  That on their back unmercifully smote.  Ah! how they made them bound at the first stripe!  None for the second waited nor the third.       Meantime as on I pass'd, one met my sight  Whom soon as view'd; \"Of him,\" cried I, \"not yet  Mine eye hath had his fill.\"  With fixed gaze  I therefore scann'd him.  Straight the teacher kind  Paus'd with me, and consented I should walk  Backward a space, and the tormented spirit,  Who thought to hide him, bent his visage down.  But it avail'd him nought; for I exclaim'd:  \"Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground,  Unless thy features do belie thee much,  Venedico art thou.  But what brings thee  Into this bitter seas'ning? \" He replied:  \"Unwillingly I answer to thy words.  But thy clear speech, that to my mind recalls  The world I once inhabited, constrains me.  Know then 'twas I who led fair Ghisola  To do the Marquis' will, however fame  The shameful tale have bruited.  Nor alone  Bologna hither sendeth me to mourn  Rather with us the place is so o'erthrong'd  That not so many tongues this day are taught,  Betwixt the Reno and Savena's stream,  To answer SIPA in their country's phrase.  And if of that securer proof thou need,  Remember but our craving thirst for gold.\"       Him speaking thus, a demon with his thong  Struck, and exclaim'd, \"Away! corrupter! here  Women are none for sale.\"  Forthwith I join'd  My escort, and few paces thence we came  To where a rock forth issued from the bank.  That easily ascended, to the right  Upon its splinter turning, we depart  From those eternal barriers. When arriv'd,  Where underneath the gaping arch lets pass  The scourged souls:  \"Pause here,\" the teacher said,  \"And let these others miserable, now  Strike on thy ken, faces not yet beheld,  For that together they with us have walk'd.\"       From the old bridge we ey'd the pack, who came  From th' other side towards us, like the rest,  Excoriate from the lash.  My gentle guide,  By me unquestion'd, thus his speech resum'd:  \"Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends,  And seems too woe-begone to drop a tear.  How yet the regal aspect he retains!  Jason is he, whose skill and prowess won  The ram from Colchos. To the Lemnian isle  His passage thither led him, when those bold  And pitiless women had slain all their males.  There he with tokens and fair witching words  Hypsipyle beguil'd, a virgin young,  Who first had all the rest herself beguil'd.  Impregnated he left her there forlorn.  Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain.  Here too Medea's inj'ries are avenged.  All bear him company, who like deceit  To his have practis'd.  And thus much to know  Of the first vale suffice thee, and of those  Whom its keen torments urge.\"  Now had we come  Where, crossing the next pier, the straighten'd path  Bestrides its shoulders to another arch.       Hence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts,  Who jibber in low melancholy sounds,  With wide-stretch'd nostrils snort, and on themselves  Smite with their palms.  Upon the banks a scurf  From the foul steam condens'd, encrusting hung,  That held sharp combat with the sight and smell.       So hollow is the depth, that from no part,  Save on the summit of the rocky span,  Could I distinguish aught.  Thus far we came;  And thence I saw, within the foss below,  A crowd immers'd in ordure, that appear'd  Draff of the human body.  There beneath  Searching with eye inquisitive, I mark'd  One with his head so grim'd, 't were hard to deem,  If he were clerk or layman.  Loud he cried:  \"Why greedily thus bendest more on me,  Than on these other filthy ones, thy ken?\"       \"Because if true my mem'ry,\" I replied,  \"I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks,  And thou Alessio art of Lucca sprung.  Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more.\"       Then beating on his brain these words he spake:  \"Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk,  Wherewith I ne'er enough could glut my tongue.\"       My leader thus:  \"A little further stretch  Thy face, that thou the visage well mayst note  Of that besotted, sluttish courtezan,  Who there doth rend her with defiled nails,  Now crouching down, now risen on her feet.  Thais is this, the harlot, whose false lip  Answer'd her doting paramour that ask'd,  'Thankest me much!'--'Say rather wondrously,'  And seeing this here satiate be our view.\"        CANTO XIX    WOE to thee, Simon Magus! woe to you,  His wretched followers! who the things of God,  Which should be wedded unto goodness, them,  Rapacious as ye are, do prostitute  For gold and silver in adultery!  Now must the trumpet sound for you, since yours  Is the third chasm.  Upon the following vault  We now had mounted, where the rock impends  Directly o'er the centre of the foss.

A few inches of snow impeded her as much as a  foot had done before. Little by little she dropped back. Kazan forged to  her side, every ounce of his magnificent strength in the traces. By the  time they were on the river channel again, Joan was at the back of the  sledge, following in the trail made by Kazan. She was powerless to help  him. She felt more and more the leaden weight of her legs. There was but  one hope--and that was the forest. If they did not reach it soon, within  half an hour, she would be able to go no farther. Over and over again  she moaned a prayer for her baby as she struggled on. She fell in the  snow-drifts. Kazan and the sledge became only a dark blotch to her. And  then, all at once, she saw that they were leaving her. They were not  more than twenty feet ahead of her--but the blotch seemed to be a vast  distance away. Every bit of life and strength in her body was now bent  upon reaching the sledge--and baby Joan.    It seemed an interminable time before she gained. With the sledge only  six feet ahead of her she struggled for what seemed to her to be an hour  before she could reach out and touch it. With a moan she flung herself  forward, and fell upon it. She no longer heard the wailing of the storm.  She no longer felt discomfort. With her face in the furs under which  baby Joan was buried, there came to her with swiftness and joy a vision  of warmth and home. And then the vision faded away, and was followed by  deep night.    Kazan stopped in the trail. He came back then and sat down upon his  haunches beside her, waiting for her to move and speak. But she was  very still. He thrust his nose into her loose hair. A whine rose in his  throat, and suddenly he raised his head and sniffed in the face of the  wind. Something came to him with that wind. He muzzled Joan again, hut  she did not stir. Then he went forward, and stood in his traces, ready  for the pull, and looked hack at her. Still she did not move or speak,  and Kazan's whine gave place to a sharp excited bark.    The strange thing in the wind came to him stronger for a moment. He  began to pull. The sledge-runners had frozen to the snow, and it took  every ounce of his strength to free them. Twice during the next five  minutes he stopped and sniffed the air. The third time that he halted,  in a drift of snow, he returned to Joan's side again, and whined to  awaken her. Then he tugged again at the end of his traces, and foot by  foot he dragged the sledge through the drift. Beyond the drift there was  a stretch of clear ice, and here Kazan rested. During a lull in the wind  the scent came to him stronger than before.    At the end of the clear ice was a narrow break in the shore, where a  creek ran into the main stream. If Joan had been conscious she would  have urged him straight ahead. But Kazan turned into the break, and for  ten minutes he struggled through the snow without a rest, whining more  and more frequently, until at last the whine broke into a joyous bark.  Ahead of him, close to the creek, was a small cabin. Smoke was rising  out of the chimney. It was the scent of smoke that had come to him in  the wind. A hard level slope reached to the cabin door, and with the  last strength that was in him Kazan dragged his burden up that. Then he  settled himself back beside Joan, lifted his shaggy head to the dark sky  and howled.    A moment later the door opened. A man came out. Kazan's reddened,  snow-shot eyes followed him watchfully as he ran to the sledge. He heard  his startled exclamation as he bent over Joan. In another lull of the  wind there came from out of the mass of furs on the sledge the wailing,  half-smothered voice of baby Joan.    A deep sigh of relief heaved up from Kazan's chest. He was exhausted.  His strength was gone. His feet were torn and bleeding. But the voice  of baby Joan filled him with a strange happiness, and he lay down in his  traces, while the man carried Joan and the baby into the life and warmth  of the cabin.    A few minutes later the man reappeared. He was not old, like Pierre  Radisson. He came close to Kazan, and looked down at him.    \"My God,\" he said. \"And you did that--_alone!_\"    He bent down fearlessly, unfastened him from the traces, and led him  toward the cabin door. Kazan hesitated but once--almost on the  threshold. He turned his head, swift and alert. From out of the moaning  and wailing of the storm it seemed to him that for a moment he had heard  the voice of Gray Wolf.    Then the cabin door closed behind him.    Back in a shadowy corner of the cabin he lay, while the man prepared  something over a hot stove for Joan. It was a long time before Joan rose  from the cot on which the man had placed her. After that Kazan heard her  sobbing; and then the man made her eat, and for a time they talked. Then  the stranger hung up a big blanket in front of the bunk, and sat down  close to the stove. Quietly Kazan slipped along the wall, and crept  under the bunk. For a long time he could hear the sobbing breath of the  girl. Then all was still.    The next morning he slipped out through the door when the man opened it,  and sped swiftly into the forest. Half a mile away he found the trail of  Gray Wolf, and called to her. From the frozen river came her reply, and  he went to her.    Vainly Gray Wolf tried to lure him back into their old haunts--away from  the cabin and the scent of man. Late that morning the man harnessed his  dogs, and from the fringe of the forest Kazan saw him tuck Joan and the  baby among the furs on the sledge, as old Pierre had done. All that day  he followed in the trail of the team, with Gray Wolf slinking behind  him. They traveled until dark; and then, under the stars and the moon  that had followed the storm, the man still urged on his team. It was  deep in the night when they came to another cabin, and the man beat upon  the door. A light, the opening of the door, the joyous welcome of a  man's voice, Joan's sobbing cry--Kazan heard these from the shadows in  which he was hidden, and then slipped back to Gray Wolf.    In the days and weeks that followed Joan's home-coming the lure of the  cabin and of the woman's hand held Kazan. As he had tolerated Pierre, so  now he tolerated the younger man who lived with Joan and the baby. He  knew that the man was very dear to Joan, and that the baby was very dear  to him, as it was to the girl. It was not until the third day that Joan  succeeded in coaxing him into the cabin--and that was the day on which  the man returned with the dead and frozen body of Pierre. It was Joan's  husband who first found the name on the collar he wore, and they began  calling him Kazan.    Half a mile away, at the summit of a huge mass of rock which the Indians  called the Sun Rock, he and Gray Wolf had found a home; and from here  they went down to their hunts on the plain, and often the girl's voice  reached up to them, calling, \"_Kazan! Kazan! Kazan_!\"    Through all the long winter Kazan hovered thus between the lure of Joan  and the cabin--and Gray Wolf.    Then came Spring--and the Great Change.          CHAPTER VIII    THE GREAT CHANGE      The rocks, the ridges and the valleys were taking on a warmer glow. The  poplar buds were ready to burst. The scent of balsam and of spruce grew  heavier in the air each day, and all through the wilderness, in plain  and forest, there was the rippling murmur of the spring floods finding  their way to Hudson's Bay. In that great bay there was the rumble and  crash of the ice fields thundering down in the early break-up through  the Roes Welcome--the doorway to the Arctic, and for that reason there  still came with the April wind an occasional sharp breath of winter.    Kazan had sheltered himself against that wind. Not a breath of air  stirred in the sunny spot the wolf-dog had chosen for himself. He was  more comfortable than he had been at any time during the six months of  terrible winter--and as he slept he dreamed.    Gray Wolf, his wild mate, lay near him, flat on her belly, her forepaws  reaching out, her eyes and nostrils as keen and alert as the smell of  man could make them. For there was that smell of man, as well as of  balsam and spruce, in the warm spring air. She gazed anxiously and  sometimes steadily, at Kazan as he slept. Her own gray spine stiffened  when she saw the tawny hair along Kazan's back bristle at some dream  vision. She whined softly as his upper lip snarled back, showing his  long white fangs. But for the most part Kazan lay quiet, save for the  muscular twitchings of legs, shoulders and muzzle, which always tell  when a dog is dreaming; and as he dreamed there came to the door of the  cabin out on the plain a blue-eyed girl-woman, with a big brown braid  over her shoulder, who called through the cup of her hands, \"Kazan,  Kazan, Kazan!\"    The voice reached faintly to the top of the Sun Rock, and Gray Wolf  flattened her ears. Kazan stirred, and in another instant he was awake  and on his feet. He leaped to an outcropping ledge, sniffing the air and  looking far out over the plain that lay below them.    Over the plain the woman's voice came to them again, and Kazan ran to  the edge of the rock and whined. Gray Wolf stepped softly to his side  and laid her muzzle on his shoulder. She had grown to know what the  Voice meant. Day and night she feared it, more than she feared the scent  or sound of man.    Since she had given up the pack and her old life for Kazan, the Voice  had become Gray Wolf's greatest enemy, and she hated it. It took Kazan  from her. And wherever it went, Kazan followed.    Night after night it robbed her of her mate, and left her to wander  alone under the stars and the moon, keeping faithfully to her  loneliness, and never once responding with her own tongue to the  hunt-calls of "]]]
