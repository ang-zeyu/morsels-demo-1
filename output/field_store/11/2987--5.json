The tracks that I saw at the Gap certainly indicated that the man  was carrying something very heavy when he returned to the boat.\"    \"But why should the man have climbed a rope up the cliff when he could  have walked up the Shepherd's Path?\" the magistrate asked.    \"Because,\" replied Thorndyke, \"there would then have been a set of  tracks leading out of the Bay without a corresponding set leading into  it; and this would have instantly suggested to a smart  police-officer--such as Sergeant Payne--a landing from a boat.\"    \"Your explanation is highly ingenious,\" said the magistrate, \"and  appears to cover all the very remarkable facts. Have you anything more  to tell us?\"    \"No, your Worship,\" was the reply, \"excepting\" (here he took from Polton  the last pair of moulds and passed them up to the magistrate) \"that you  will probably find these moulds of importance presently.\"    As Thorndyke stepped from the box--for there was no  cross-examination--the magistrates scrutinized the moulds with an air of  perplexity; but they were too discreet to make any remark.    When the evidence of Professor Copland (which showed that an  unquestionably lethal dose of morphia must have been swallowed) had been  taken, the clerk called out the--to me--unfamiliar name of Jacob Gummer.  Thereupon an enormous pair of brown dreadnought trousers, from the upper  end of which a smack-boy's head and shoulders protruded, walked into the  witness-box.    Jacob admitted at the outset that he was a smack-master's apprentice,  and that he had been \"hired out\" by his master to one Mr. Jezzard as  deck-hand and cabin-boy of the yacht _Otter_.    \"Now, Gummer,\" said Anstey, \"do you remember the prisoner coming on  board the yacht?\"    \"Yes. He has been on board twice. The first time was about a month ago.  He went for a sail with us then. The second time was on the night when  Mr. Hearn was murdered.\"    \"Do you remember what sort of boots the prisoner was wearing the first  time he came?\"    \"Yes. They were shoes with a lot of nails in the soles. I remember them  because Mr. Jezzard made him take them off and put on a canvas pair.\"    \"What was done with the nailed shoes?\"    \"Mr. Jezzard took 'em below to the cabin.\"    \"And did Mr. Jezzard come up on deck again directly?\"    \"No. He stayed down in the cabin about ten minutes.\"    \"Do you remember a parcel being delivered on board from a London  boot-maker?\"    \"Yes. The postman brought it about four or five days after Mr. Draper  had been on board. It was labelled 'Walker Bros., Boot and Shoe Makers,  London.' Mr. Jezzard took a pair of shoes from it, for I saw them on the  locker in the cabin the same day.\"    \"Did you ever see him wear them?\"    \"No. I never see 'em again.\"    \"Have you ever heard sounds of hammering on the yacht?\"    \"Yes. The night after the parcel came I was on the quay alongside, and I  heard someone a-hammering in the cabin.\"    \"What did the hammering sound like?\"    \"It sounded like a cobbler a-hammering in nails.\"    \"Have you over seen any boot-nails on the yacht?\"    \"Yes. When I was a-clearin' up the cabin the next mornin', I found a  hobnail on the floor in a corner by the locker.\"    \"Were you on board on the night when Mr. Hearn died?\"    \"Yes. I'd been ashore, but I came aboard about half-past nine.\"    \"Did you see Mr. Hearn go ashore?\"    \"I see him leave the yacht. I had turned into my bunk and gone to sleep,  when Mr. Jezzard calls down to me: 'We're putting Mr. Hearn ashore,'  says he; 'and then,' he says, 'we're a-going for an hour's fishing. You  needn't sit up,' he says, and with that he shuts the scuttle. Then I got  up and slid back the scuttle and put my head out, and I see Mr. Jezzard  and Mr. Leach a-helpin' Mr. Hearn acrost the deck. Mr. Hearn he looked  as if he was drunk. They got him into the boat--and a rare job they  had--and Mr. Pitford, what was in the boat already, he pushed off. And  then I popped my head in again, 'cause I didn't want them to see me.\"    \"Did they row to the steps?\"    \"No. I put my head out again when they were gone, and I heard 'em row  round the yacht, and then pull out towards the mouth of the harbour. I  couldn't see the boat, 'cause it was a very dark night.\"    \"Very well. Now I am going to ask you about another matter. Do you know  anyone of the name of Polton?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Gummer, turning a dusky red. \"I've just found out his  real name. I thought he was called Simmons.\"    \"Tell us what you know about him,\" said Anstey, with a mischievous  smile.    \"Well,\" said the boy, with a ferocious scowl at the bland and smiling  Polton, \"one day he come down to the yacht when the gentlemen had gone  ashore. I believe he'd seen 'em go. And he offers me ten shillin' to let  him see all the boots and shoes we'd got on board. I didn't see no harm,  so I turns out the whole lot in the cabin for him to look at. While he  was lookin' at 'em he asks me to fetch a pair of mine from the fo'c'sle,  so I fetches 'em. When I come back he was pitchin' the boots and shoes  back into the locker. Then, presently, he nips off, and when he was  gone I looked over the shoes, and then I found there was a pair missing.  They was an old pair of Mr. Jezzard's, and what made him nick 'em is  more than I can understand.\"    \"Would you know those shoes if you saw them!\"    \"Yes, I should,\" replied the lad.    \"Are these the pair?\" Anstey handed the boy a pair of dilapidated canvas  shoes, which he seized eagerly.    \"Yes, these is the ones what he stole!\" he exclaimed.    Anstey took them back from the boy's reluctant hands, and passed them up  to the magistrate's desk. \"I think,\" said he, \"that if your Worship will  compare these shoes with the last pair of moulds, you will have no doubt  that these are the shoes which made the footprints from the sea to  Sundersley Gap and back again.\"    The magistrates together compared the shoes and the moulds amidst a  breathless silence. At length the chairman laid them down on the desk.    \"It is impossible to doubt it,\" said he. \"The broken heel and the tear  in the rubber sole, with the remains of the chequered pattern, make the  identity practically certain.\"    As the chairman made this statement I involuntarily glanced round to the  place where Jezzard was sitting. But he was not there; neither he, nor  Pitford, nor Leach. Taking advantage of the preoccupation of the Court,  they had quietly slipped out of the door. But I was not the only person  who had noted their absence. The inspector and the sergeant were already  in earnest consultation, and a minute later they, too, hurriedly  departed.    The proceedings now speedily came to an end. After a brief discussion  with his brother-magistrates, the chairman addressed the Court.    \"The remarkable and I may say startling evidence, which has been heard  in this court to-day, if it has not fixed the guilt of this crime on any  individual, has, at any rate, made it clear to our satisfaction that the  prisoner is not the guilty person, and he is accordingly discharged. Mr.  Draper, I have great pleasure in informing you that you are at liberty  to leave the court, and that you do so entirely clear of all suspicion;  and I congratulate you very heartily on the skill and ingenuity of your  legal advisers, but for which the decision of the Court would, I am  afraid, have been very different.\"    That evening, lawyers, witnesses, and the jubilant and grateful client  gathered round a truly festive board to dine, and fight over again the  battle of the day. But we were scarcely halfway through our meal when,  to the indignation of the servants, Sergeant Payne burst breathlessly  into the room.    \"They've gone, sir!\" he exclaimed, addressing Thorndyke. \"They've given  us the slip for good.\"    \"Why, how can that be?\" asked Thorndyke.    \"They're dead, sir! All three of them!\"    \"Dead!\" we all exclaimed.    \"Yes. They made a burst for the yacht when they left the court, and they  got on board and put out to sea at once, hoping, no doubt, to get clear  as the light was just failing. But they were in such a hurry that they  did not see a steam trawler that was entering, and was hidden by the  pier. Then, just at the entrance, as the yacht was creeping out, the  trawler hit her amidships, and fairly cut her in two. The three men were  in the water in an instant, and were swept away in the eddy behind the  north pier; and before any boat could put out to them they had all gone  under. Jezzard's body came up on the beach just as I was coming away.\"    We were all silent and a little awed, but if any of us felt regret at  the catastrophe, it was at the thought that three such cold-blooded  villains should have made so easy an exit; and to one of us, at least,  the news came as a blessed relief.          II    THE STRANGER'S LATCHKEY      The contrariety of human nature is a subject that has given a surprising  amount of occupation to makers of proverbs and to those moral  philosophers who make it their province to discover and expound the  glaringly obvious; and especially have they been concerned to enlarge  upon that form of perverseness which engenders dislike of things offered  under compulsion, and arouses desire of them as soon as their attainment  becomes difficult or impossible. They assure us that a man who has had a  given thing within his reach and put it by, will, as soon as it is  beyond his reach, find it the one thing necessary and desirable; even as  the domestic cat which has turned disdainfully from the preferred  saucer, may presently be seen with her head jammed hard in the milk-jug,  or, secretly and with horrible relish, slaking her thirst at the  scullery sink.    To this peculiarity of the human mind was due, no doubt, the fact that  no sooner had I abandoned the clinical side of my profession in favour  of the legal, and taken up my abode in the chambers of my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13888"],[0,"Bacon (#11)"],[1,"obey the  call to do his best to bring a traitor to punishment.    Public duty has claims on a man as well as friendship, and in many  conceivable cases claims paramount to those of friendship. And yet  friendship, too, has claims, at least on a man's memory. Essex had been  a dear friend, if words could mean anything. He had done more than any  man had done for Bacon, generously and nobly, and Bacon had acknowledged  it in the amplest terms. Only a year before he had written, \"I am as  much yours as any man's, and as much yours as any man.\" It is not, and  it was not, a question of Essex's guilt. It may be a question whether  the whole matter was not exaggerated as to its purpose, as it certainly  was as to its real danger and mischief. We at least know that his  rivals dabbled in intrigue and foolish speeches as well as he; that  little more than two years afterwards Raleigh and Grey and Cobham were  condemned for treason in much the same fashion as he was; that Cecil to  the end of his days--with whatever purpose--was a pensioner of Spain.  The question was not whether Essex was guilty. The question for Bacon  was, whether it was becoming in him, having been what he had been to  Essex, to take a leading part in proceedings which were to end in his  ruin and death. He was not a judge. He was not a regular law officer  like Coke. His only employment had been casual and occasional. He might,  most naturally, on the score of his old friendship, have asked to be  excused. Condemning, as he did, his friend's guilt and folly, he might  have refused to take part in a cause of blood, in which his best friend  must perish. He might honestly have given up Essex as incorrigible, and  have retired to stand apart in sorrow and silence while the inevitable  tragedy was played out. The only answer to this is, that to have  declined would have incurred the Queen's displeasure: he would have  forfeited any chance of advancement; nay, closely connected as he had  been with Essex, he might have been involved in his friend's ruin. But  inferior men have marred their fortunes by standing by their friends in  not undeserved trouble, and no one knew better than Bacon what was  worthy and noble in human action. The choice lay before him. He seems  hardly to have gone through any struggle. He persuaded himself that he  could not help himself, under the constraint of his duty to the Queen,  and he did his best to get Essex condemned.    And this was not all. The death of Essex was a shock to the popularity  of Elizabeth greater than anything that had happened in her long reign.  Bacon's name also had come into men's mouths as that of a time-server  who played fast and loose with Essex and his enemies, and who, when he  had got what he could from Essex, turned to see what he could get from  those who put him to death. A justification of the whole affair was felt  to be necessary; and Bacon was fixed upon for the distinction and the  dishonour of doing it. No one could tell the story so well, and it was  felt that he would not shrink from it. Nor did he. In cold blood he sat  down to blacken Essex, using his intimate personal knowledge of the past  to strengthen his statements against a friend who was in his grave, and  for whom none could answer but Bacon himself. It is a well-compacted and  forcible account of Essex's misdoings, on which of course the colour of  deliberate and dangerous treason was placed. Much of it, no doubt, was  true; but even of the facts, and much more of the colour, there was no  check to be had, and it is certain that it was an object to the  Government to make out the worst. It is characteristic that Bacon  records that he did not lose sight of the claims of courtesy, and  studiously spoke of \"my Lord of Essex\" in the draft submitted for  correction to the Queen; but she was more unceremonious, and insisted  that the \"rebel\" should be spoken of simply as \"Essex.\"    After a business of this kind, fines and forfeitures flowed in  abundantly, and were \"usually bestowed on deserving servants or favoured  suitors by way of reward;\" and Bacon came in for his share. Out of one  of the fines he received L1200. \"The Queen hath done something for me,\"  he writes to a friendly creditor, \"though not in the proportion I had  hoped,\" and he afterwards asked for something more. It was rather under  the value of Essex's gift to him in 1594. But she still refused him all  promotion. He was without an official place in the Queen's service, and  he never was allowed to have it. It is clear that the \"Declaration of  the Treason of the Earl of Essex,\" if it justified the Government, did  not remove the odium which had fallen on Bacon. Mr. Spedding says that  he can find no signs of it. The proof of it is found in the \"Apology\"  which Bacon found it expedient to write after Elizabeth's death and  early in James's reign. He found that the recollection of the way in  which he had dealt with his friend hung heavy upon him; men hesitated to  trust him in spite of his now recognised ability. Accordingly, he drew  up an apology, which he addressed to Lord Mountjoy, the friend, in  reality half the accomplice, of Essex, in his wild, ill-defined plan for  putting pressure on Elizabeth. It is a clear, able, of course _ex parte_  statement of the doings of the three chief actors, two of whom could no  longer answer for themselves, or correct and contradict the third. It  represents the Queen as implacable and cruel, Essex as incorrigibly and  outrageously wilful, proud, and undutiful, Bacon himself as using every  effort and device to appease the Queen's anger and suspiciousness, and  to bring Essex to a wiser and humbler mind. The picture is indeed a  vivid one, and full of dramatic force, of an unrelenting and merciless  mistress bent on breaking and bowing down to the dust the haughty spirit  of a once-loved but rebellious favourite, whom, though he has deeply  offended, she yet wishes to bring once more under her yoke; and of the  calm, keen-witted looker-on, watching the dangerous game, not without  personal interest, but with undisturbed presence of mind, and doing his  best to avert an irreparable and fatal breach. How far he honestly did  his best for his misguided friend we can only know from his own report;  but there is no reason to think that he did Essex ill service, though  he notices in passing an allegation that the Queen in one of her angry  fits had charged him with this. But his interest clearly was to make up  the quarrel between the Queen and Essex. Bacon would have been a greater  man with both of them if he had been able to do so. He had been too  deeply in Essex's intimacy to make his new position of mediator, with a  strong bias on the Queen's side, quite safe and easy for a man of  honourable mind; but a cool-judging and prudent man may well have acted  as he represents himself acting without forgetting what he owed to his  friend. Till the last great moment of trial there is a good deal to be  said for Bacon: a man keenly alive to Essex's faults, with a strong  sense of what he owed to the Queen and the State, and with his own  reasonable chances of rising greatly prejudiced by Essex's folly. But at  length came the crisis which showed the man, and threw light on all that  had passed before, when he was picked out, out of his regular place, to  be charged with the task of bringing home the capital charge against  Essex. He does not say he hesitated. He does not say that he asked to be  excused the terrible office. He did not flinch as the minister of  vengeance for those who required that Essex should die. He did his work,  we are told by his admiring biographer, better than Coke, and repaired  the blunders of the prosecution. He passes over very shortly this part  of the business: \"It was laid upon me with the rest of my fellows;\" yet  it is the knot and key of the whole, as far as his own character is  concerned. Bacon had his public duty: his public duty may have compelled  him to stand apart from Essex. But it was his interest, it was no part  of his public duty, which required him to accept the task of accuser of  his friend, and in his friend's direst need calmly to drive home a  well-directed stroke that should extinguish chances and hopes, and make  his ruin certain. No one who reads his anxious letters about preferment  and the Queen's favour, about his disappointed hopes, about his  straitened means and distress for money, about his difficulties with his  creditors--he was twice arrested for debt--can doubt that the question  was between his own prospects and his friend; and that to his own  interest he sacrificed his friend and his own honour.          CHAPTER III.    BACON AND JAMES I.      Bacon's life was a double one. There was the life of high thinking, of  disinterested aims, of genuine enthusiasm, of genuine desire to delight  and benefit mankind, by opening new paths to wonder and knowledge and  power. And there was the put on and worldly life, the life of supposed  necessities for the provision of daily bread, the life of ambition and  self-seeking, which he followed, not without interest and satisfaction,  but at bottom because he thought he must--must be a great man, must be  rich, must live in the favour of the great, because without it his great  designs could not be accomplished. His original plan of life was  disclosed in his letter to Lord Burghley: to get some office with an  assured income and not much work, and then to devote the best of his  time to his own subjects. But this, if it was really his plan, was  gradually changed: first, because he could not get such a place; and  next because his connection with Essex, the efforts to gain him the  Attorney's place, and the use which the Queen made of him after Essex  could do no more for him, drew him more and more into public work, and  specially the career of the law. We know that he would not by preference  have chosen the"]]]
