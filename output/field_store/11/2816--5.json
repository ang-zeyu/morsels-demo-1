Such spots can be easily detected by the discoloration  of the skin and such a pineapple should not be selected.    [Illustration: FIG. 19]    101. PREPARATION OF PINEAPPLE.--Some persons consider pineapple a  difficult fruit to prepare, but no trouble will be experienced if the  method illustrated in Figs. 17 to 19 is followed. Place the pineapple on  a hard surface, such as a wooden cutting board, and with a large sharp  knife cut off the tuft of leaves at the top. Then, as shown in Fig. 17,  cut the pineapple into 1/2-inch slices crosswise of the head. When the  entire pineapple has been sliced, peel each slice with a sharp paring  knife, as in Fig. 18. With the peeling removed, it will be observed that  each slice contains a number of eyes. Remove these with the point of a  knife, as Fig. 19 shows. After cutting out the core from the center of  each slice, the slices may be allowed to remain whole or may be cut into  pieces of any desirable size or shape. Pineapple prepared in this way is  ready either for canning or for desserts in which it is used fresh.    102. PINEAPPLE PUDDING.--One of the most satisfactory desserts made from  pineapple is the pudding given here. It is in reality a corn-starch  pudding in which grated pineapple is used for the flavoring.    PINEAPPLE PUDDING  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2-1/2 c. scalded milk  1/3 c. corn starch  1/2 c. sugar  1/4 tsp. salt  1/4 c. cold milk  1-1/2 c. grated pineapple, canned or fresh  2 egg whites    Scald the milk by heating it over the fire in a double boiler. Mix the  corn starch, sugar, and salt, and dissolve in the cold milk. Add to the  scalded milk in the double boiler and cook for about 15 or 20 minutes.  Remove from the fire and add the grated pineapple from which all juice  has been drained. Then fold in the whites of the eggs beaten stiff. Pour  into molds previously dipped in cold water, allow to cool, and serve  with cream.      MISCELLANEOUS TROPICAL FRUITS    103. AVOCADOS.--The avocado, which is also known as the _alligator  pear_, is a large pear-shaped, pulpy fruit raised principally in the  West Indies. It has a purplish-brown skin and contains just one very  large seed in the center. The flesh contains considerable fat, and so  the food value of this fruit is rather high, being fully twice as great  as a like quantity of apples or oranges.    This fruit, which is gaining in popularity in the Northern States, is  very perishable and does not stand shipment well. As a rule, it reaches  the northern market green and is ripened after its arrival. It is an  expensive fruit and is used almost entirely for salads. As its flavor is  somewhat peculiar, a taste for it must usually be cultivated.    104. GUAVAS.--The guava is a tropical fruit that is extensively grown in  the southern part of the United States. Guavas come in two varieties:  _red guava_, which resembles the apple, and _white guava_, which  resembles the pear. The fruit, which has a pleasant acid pulp, is  characterized by a more or less peculiar flavor for which a liking must  be cultivated. It can be canned and preserved in much the same way as  peaches are.    Because guavas are very perishable, they cannot be shipped to northern  markets, but various products are made from them and sent to every  market. Preserved and pickled guavas and confections made from what is  known as guava paste are common, but guava jelly made from the pulp is  probably the best known product.    105. NECTARINES.--The tropical fruit called the nectarine is really a  variety of peach, but it differs from the common peach in that it has a  smooth, waxy skin. Also, the flesh of the nectarine is firmer and has a  stronger flavor than that of the peach. Nectarines are not shipped to  the northern markets to any extent, but they are canned in exactly the  same way as peaches are and can be secured in this form.    106. PERSIMMONS.--The persimmon is a semitropical plum-like fruit,  globular in shape and an orange-red or yellow in color. It comes in many  varieties, but few of them find their way into the northern markets. The  Japanese persimmon, which resembles a tomato in color, is the variety  most frequently purchased. Persimmons are characterized by a great deal  of very pungent acid, which has a puckery effect until the fruit is made  sweet and edible by exposure to the frost. In localities where they are  plentiful, persimmons are extensively used and are preserved for use  during the winter season.    107. POMEGRANATES.--The pomegranate is about as large as a full-sized  apple and has a hard reddish-yellow rind. Most varieties contain many  seeds and a comparatively small amount of red edible pulp. Pomegranates  of various kinds are grown in the southern part of the United States and  in other warm climates. They are used extensively in the localities  where they are grown and are much enjoyed by persons who learn to care  for their flavor. A cooling drink made from their pulp finds much favor.    108. TAMARINDS AND MANGOES.--Although tamarinds and mangoes are  practically unknown outside of tropical countries, they are considered  to be very delicious fruits and are used extensively in their native  localities.    The tamarind consists of a brown-shelled pod that contains a brown acid  pulp and from three to ten seeds. This fruit has various uses in  medicine and cookery and is found very satisfactory for a  cooling beverage.    Mangoes vary greatly in size, shape, flavor, and color. Some varieties  are large, fleshy, and luscious, while others are small and stringy and  have a peculiar flavor.      MELONS    109. CANTALOUPES AND MUSKMELONS.--The variety of melons known as  muskmelons consists of a juicy, edible fruit that is characterized by a  globular shape and a ribbed surface. Cantaloupes are a variety of  muskmelons, but the distinction between them is sometimes difficult to  understand. For the most part, these names are used interchangeably with  reference to melons.    Considerable variation occurs in this fruit. Some cantaloupes and  muskmelons are large and others are small; some have pink or yellow  flesh and others have white or light-green flesh. All the variations of  color and size are found between these two extremes. The flesh of these  fruits contains considerable water; therefore, their food value is not  high, being only a little over half as much as that of apples.    110. If melons suitable for the table are desired, they should be  selected with care. To be just at the right stage, the blossom end of  the melon should be a trifle soft when pressed with the fingers. If it  is very soft, the melon is perhaps too ripe; but if it does not give  with pressure, the melon is too green.    111. Various ways of serving muskmelons and cantaloupes are in practice.  When they are to be served plain as a breakfast food or a luncheon  dessert, cut them crosswise into halves, or, if they are large, divide  them into sections lengthwise. With the melons cut in the desired way,  remove all the seeds and keep the melons on ice until they are to be  served. The pulp of the melon may also be cut from the rind and then  diced and used in the making of fruit salads. Again, the pulp may be  partly scraped out of the melon and the rinds then filled with fruit  mixtures and served with a salad dressing for a salad or with fruit  juices for a cocktail. The pulp that is scraped out may be diced and  used in the fruit mixture, and what is left in the rind may be eaten  after the contents have been eaten.    112. CASABA MELONS.--The variety of melons known as casaba, or honeydew,  melons are a cross between a cucumber and a cantaloupe. They have white  flesh and a rind that is smoother than the rind of cantaloupes. Melons  of this kind are raised in the western part of the United States, but as  they stand shipment very well, they can usually be obtained in the  market in other regions. They are much enjoyed by those who are fond of  this class of fruit. Their particular advantage is that they come later  in the season than cantaloupes and muskmelons, and thus can be obtained  for the table long after these other fruits are out of season. Casaba  melons may be served in the same ways as cantaloupes.    113. WATERMELONS.--A very well-known type of melon is the watermelon. It  is grown principally in warm climates of the Southern States, as the  season in the North is not sufficiently long to allow it to develop.  This is a large fruit, having a smooth green skin that is often mottled  or striped, and a pinkish pulp containing many seeds and having a sweet,  watery juice. The large amount of water contained in this fruit makes  its food value very low, it being lower in this respect than muskmelons  and cantaloupes. The volatile oil it contains, which is responsible for  its flavor, proves irritating to some persons who eat it.    114. Watermelon is delicious when it is served ice cold. Therefore,  before it is served, it should be kept on ice for a sufficient time to  allow it to become thoroughly cold. Then it may be cut in any desirable  way. If it is cut in slices, the slices should be trimmed so that only  the pink pulp that is edible is served, the green rind being discarded.  As an appetizer, watermelon is delicious when cut into pieces and served  in a cocktail glass with fresh mint chopped fine and sprinkled over the  top. Small pieces of watermelon cut with a French vegetable cutter make  a very attractive garnish for fruit salads and other fruit mixtures.      FRUIT COCKTAILS    115. Cocktails made of a combination of fruits are often served as the  first course of a meal, usually a luncheon or a dinner, to precede the  soup course. In warm weather, they are an excellent substitute for heavy  cocktails made of lobster or crab, and they may even be used to replace  the soup course. The fruits used for this purpose should be the more  acid ones,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9943"],[0,"Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia, in Search of a (#10)"],[1," fortunate that we could encamp  under such circumstances on so favourable a spot. We placed our tents  amongst shady bushes--set up the blacksmith's forge, and soon all hands  were at work in their various avocations, whilst the cattle and horses  enjoyed the fresh grass, leisure to eat it, and abundance of water.    Amongst the bushes here, a HAKEA, with simple filiform mucronulate leaves  without flower, occurred, loaded with oblong hard galls resembling dry  plums. Also the SENECIO CUNNINGHAMI (D.C.), found by Allan Cunningham on  the shores of Lake George. Mr. Stephenson discovered here a very pretty  new TRICHINIUM, with heads of hoary pink flowers. [* T. SEMILANATUM  (Lindl.

E.  of us, or be a branch out of this. At all events, the creek surveyed by  Larmer is thus proved to have been a discovery of his, and a most useful  one it has thus proved to us on this emergency. That chain of ponds  (whence we had just come) was called Bellaringa; this \"Cannonba;\" and to  what I suppose must be Duck Creek, water to which the natives point  northward, they give the name of \"Marra.\" Therm. at sunrise, 78 deg.; at  noon, 115 deg.; at 4 P.M. 96 deg.; at 9, 88 deg.; with wet bulb, 73 deg..    28TH JANUARY.--Several kettles, a good spade, a Roman balance with large  chain complete, barrels, and other articles, were found at the bottom of  one of the ponds; and old tracks of cattle were numerous about the banks.  Thus it was clear that this favourable spot for a cattle station had not  been unheeded by the white man. It was vaguely asserted by some old gins  seen by Piper, that three men had been killed here when the place was  abandoned. We were about twelve or fourteen miles to the W.N.W. of Mount  Harris; and certainly the general bed of this watercourse was broader  than that of the Bogan, and moreover contained much granitic sand, all  but identifying its sources with those of the Macquarie. This day was  very hot; a thunder cloud passed over us, and a shower fell about 3 P.M.  Thermometer at sunrise, 78 deg.; at noon, 115 deg.; at 4 P.M. 108 deg.; at 9, 84 deg.;  with wet bulb, 63 deg..    29TH JANUARY.--A more than usually hot wind raised the thermometer to  115 deg. in the shade; but distant thunder was soon heard, and the horizon  became clouded. The day was very sultry, and although no rain fell near  us, it was evident that other parts to the north-east were receiving a  heavy shower. Thermometer at sunset, 102 deg..    30TH JANUARY.--An easterly wind brought a refreshing air from the quarter  where the thunder-cloud had exhausted itself last evening. This day the  doctor found the tree mentioned as bearing a nondescript fruit in my  former journal, Vol. I. page 82., but this tree bore neither flower nor  fruit. Thermometer at sunrise, 80 deg.; at noon, 103 deg.; at 4 P.M., 108 deg.; at 9,  100 1/2 deg.; with wet bulb, 79 deg..    31ST JANUARY.--The weather still very sultry. I commenced a series of  observations with a syphon barometer (made by Bunten of Paris). The table  for expansion of mercury and mean dilatation of glass, sent me by my  friend Captain P. P. King, came but to 88 deg. of Fahrenheit, whereas at 4  P.M., the centigrade thermometer stood at 441/2 deg., which is equal to 112 deg. of  Fahrenheit.    This day I was apprised of Piper's intention to leave the party, taking  with him the two younger and more useful natives. He had recently made  some very unreasonable demands. It was now obvious from various sayings  and doings thus brought to my recollection, that he had never any serious  intention of accompanying this expedition throughout its progress. The  services of other more intelligent natives might easily have been  obtained, having been proffered by many in the settled districts, but  Piper from having been with me before, was preferred as a matter of  course. He had not improved in speech or manners during the long interval  of ten years that had elapsed since our former acquaintance, although  during that time he had visited Adelaide, Sydney, Moreton Bay, the river  Hunter, etc., etc. From the day on which he had joined the party on this  last occasion, he had been allowed a horse, saddle, doublebarrelled gun,  clothing, and the same rations as the other men, blankets, place in a  tent with the men, etc. Unlike most other natives, he was a very bad  shot, and very awkward about a horse; it was impossible to obtain any  clear intelligence from his countrymen through him as interpreter; he  went very unwillingly about doing anything. He had drawn his rations and  those of the two young natives separately from the men's mess the week  before this, on the plea that they did not obtain their fair share; he  was thus premeditately preparing for his clandestine departure,  foreseeing that on the Saturday, when rations were issued, he could thus  obtain a week's provisions in advance, without suspicion. He also had it  in his power, like a true savage, to take the lion's share from the other  two, in thus drawing rations apart from the men's mess. He had heard of  the gins who had made the conflagration having retired towards the  cattle-stations on the Macquarie. Here, then, while other men were  actively at their work,--blacksmiths, carpenters, bullock-drivers,--this  man, who was as well fed and clothed as they, carried on a horse to boot,  and doing no work, was the only dissatisfied person. Me, whom he called  his \"old master,\" he would heartlessly leave, without a native guide,  just at the time when such guides were most required. The only difficulty  I felt on this occasion was how to secure the services of the two others,  and yet dismiss him. He had just received a week's ration in advance, and  he was baking the whole of the flour into bread. I sent to have him  instantly seized, and brought with the dough and the other native,  Yuranigh, before Mr. Kennedy and myself, as magistrates. He denied the  intention to decamp. The other declared he had proposed to him to leave  the party and go in search of gins, and that he could not understand him;  that he was afraid to accompany Piper in a country so far from his own  home (Buree). On this I ordered Piper to be sent to Bathurst, and the  rations he was about to carry off, to be given to the other two, and that  he should be kept apart from them during the night. Thermometer at  sunrise, 85 deg.; at noon, 111 deg.; at 4 P.M., 112 deg.; at 9, 101 deg.;--with wet bulb,  78 deg..    1ST FEBRUARY.--This morning Piper was sent off with Corporal Graham. Mr.  Kennedy rode on also in order to find out the nearest police station, and  make arrangements, if possible, there, for forwarding Piper to Bathurst,  his own district, which would put it out of his power to molest the party  by endeavouring to induce the other natives to leave it. On them this  measure appeared to have a salutary effect, Yuranigh calmly observing  that Piper had only himself to blame for what had befallen him, and that  he had acted like a fool. Mr. Kennedy undertook also to obtain, if he  could, some more kangaroo dogs to replace those which had died from  excessive heat. By that loss our party was left almost without dogs; and  dogs were useful not only to kill kangaroos and emus, but to afford  protection from, or to give notice of, nightly attacks by the natives, in  which attacks those on that part of the Darling we were approaching, had  been rather too successful against various armed parties of whites.  Thermometer at sunrise, 88 deg.; at noon, 104 deg.; at 4 P.M., 106 deg.; at 9 P.M.,  88 deg.;--with wet bulb, 76 deg..    2ND FEBRUARY.--The setting sun descended on a blue stratus cloud which  appeared along the edge of all other parts of the horizon, and eagerly  watching any indication of a change, I drew even from this a presage of  rain. Thermometer at sunrise, 88 deg.; at noon, 104 deg.; at 4 P.M., 106; at 9,  88 deg.;--with wet bulb, 72 deg..    3RD FEBRUARY.--High winds whistled among the trees this morning, and dark  clouds of stratus appeared in the sky. A substantial shower fell about 9  A.M., and the horizon was gradually shut in by clouds of nimbus. The high  wind had blown steadily from north both yesterday and this morning, and  in the same quarter a thunder cloud seemed busy. But when the rain began  to fall, the wind shifted to the S.W., from which quarter the rain seemed  to come. With it came a very peculiar smell, which I had noticed near  Mount Arapiles in 1836, about the time of the commencement of the rainy  weather there; and nothing could have been more welcome to us now, than  the prospect of rain, and the decided change in the temperature from 115 deg.  to 73 deg.. This was almost the first day during a month in which the air had  not been warmer than our blood; often had it been greater than fever  heat, so that 73 deg. felt to us as cool as 50 deg. would have been to a resident  of Sydney. Much rain did not fall at our camp, but it seemed that rain  was falling about the sources of the Bogan and other places at which a  supply of water was indispensable to enable us to proceed. At sunset,  glimpses of a clear sky appeared about the horizon, and during the night  the moon and stars came forth, and destroyed all hopes of more rain. We  were thankful, however, for the relief afforded by what had fallen, which  had lowered the temperature about 40 degrees, and enabled us to enjoy a  night of refreshing rest. Thermometer at sunrise, 85 deg.; at noon, 80 deg.; at 4  P.M., 73 deg.; at 9, 68 deg.;--with wet bulb, 67 deg..    4TH FEBRUARY.--The morning dawned in a most serene sky, with refreshing "]]]
