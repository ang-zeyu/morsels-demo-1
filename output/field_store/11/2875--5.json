Apparently, timber was used in this country almost exclusively for  humble buildings down to the 16th century. This is not surprising,  considering how well wooded England was; but stone served during the  same period for important buildings almost to the exclusion of brick.  This is more remarkable, as we find stone churches and the ruins of  stone castles in not a few spots remote from stone quarries, and to  which the stone must have been laboriously conveyed at a time when roads  were very bad and wheel carts were scarce.    About the time of the Tudors, say the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the  making of bricks was resumed in England, and many dwelling houses and  some few churches were built of good brickwork in that and succeeding  reigns. We find in such buildings as Hampton Court Palace, St. James'  Palace, and Chelsea Hospital examples of the use of brickwork in  important buildings near London at later dates. The fire of London, in  1666, gave a sudden check to the use of timber in house building in the  metropolis. Previous to that date the majority of houses had been of a  sort the most ornamental examples of which were copied in \"Old London\"  at the Colonial Exhibition. The rebuilding after the fire was largely in  brick; and in the suburbs, in the latter part of the 17th and the 18th  centuries, many dignified square brick mansions, with bold, overhanging  eaves and high roofs and carved ornaments, entered through a pair of  florid wrought iron high gates, were built, some few of which still  linger in Hampstead and other suburbs. The war time at the beginning of  this century was a trying time for builders, with its high prices and  heavy taxes, and some of the good-looking brick buildings of that day  turn out to have been very badly built when they are pulled about for  alterations. With the rapid, wonderful increase in population and wealth  in this metropolis during the last 50 years a vast consumption of bricks  has taken place, and a year or two back it was reported by the  commissioners of police that the extensions of London equaled in a year  70 miles of new house property, practically all of brick. Brick were  heavily taxed in the war time which I have referred to, and the tax was  levied before burning.    There was a maximum size for the raw brick, which it was supposed served  to keep bricks uniform, and the expectation was entertained that when  the duty came off, many fancy sizes of bricks would be used. This has  not, however, turned out to be the case. The duty has been taken off for  years; but the differences in the size of bricks in England are little  more than what is due to the different rate of shrinkage of brick earth  under burning. It must not, however, be supposed that they have always,  and in all countries, been of about the same dimensions.    The size and proportions of bricks have varied extremely in different  countries and in the same country at different periods. Some bricks of  unusual shapes have also been employed from time to time. Other  countries besides England possess districts which from various  circumstances have been more or less densely built on, but do not yield  much stone or timber; and, accordingly, brickwork is to be met with in  many localities. Holland and Belgium, for example, are countries of this  sort; and the old connection between Holland and England led to the  introduction among us, in the reign of William III., of the Dutch style  of building, which has been in our own day revived under the rather  incorrect title of Queen Anne architecture. Another great brick district  exists on the plains of Lombardy and the northern part of Italy  generally, and beautiful brickwork, often with enrichments in marble, is  to be found in such cities as Milan, Pavia, Cremona, and Bologna.    Many cities and towns in Northern Germany are also brick built, and  furnish good examples of the successful treatment of the material. In  some of these German buildings, indeed, very difficult pieces of  construction, such as we are in the habit of thinking can only be  executed in stone, are successfully attempted in brick. For example,  they execute large tracery windows in this material. Great brick gables,  often with the stepped outline known as crows' feet, are an excellent  architectural feature of these German brick-built towns. In parts of  France, also, ornamental brickwork was from time to time made use of,  but not extensively. It is not necessary to go very minutely into the  manufacture of bricks; but perhaps I ought to say a word or two on the  subject. Good brick earth is not simple clay, but a compound substance;  and what is essential is that it should burn hard or, in other words,  partly vitrify under the action of heat. The brick earth is usually dug  up in the autumn, left for the frosts of winter to break it up, and  worked up in the early spring.    The moulding is to a very large extent done by hand, sometimes in a wet  mould, sometimes in a dry sanded mould, and the bricks are first  air-dried, often under some slight shelter, as the rain or frost damages  them when fresh made; and then, when this process has made them solid  enough to handle, they are burned, and sorted into qualities. The  ordinary or stock brick of London and the neighborhood presents a  peculiarity the origin of which is not known, and which is not met with,  so far as I know, in other parts. Very fine coal or cinders is mixed  with the brick earth, and when the bricks are fired these minute  particles of fuel scattered through the material all of them burn, and  serve to bake the heart of the brick. Stock bricks are burnt in a clamp  made of the raw bricks themselves with layers of fuel, and erected on  earth slightly scooped out near the middle, so that as the bricks shrink  they drop together, and do not fall over sideways.    Most other varieties of bricks are kiln burnt. A very large number of  inventions for making bricks by machinery have been patented. If you  have occasion to look through the specifications of these patents, you  will find four or five main ideas appearing and reappearing, and only  here and there an invention which is to some extent different from the  others. A great majority of these inventions include machinery for  preparing the clay or brick earth, so that it may be dug up and filled  into a receptacle and worked up, screened from pebbles, and made fit for  use in a short time, so as not to have to wait a whole winter. This is  done in some sort of pug mill. A pug mill is a machine consisting of a  large cylinder with a central shaft passing through it from top to  bottom. Knives or blades are arranged spirally on the shaft, and other  blades project into the interior of the cylinder from the walls of it.  The material, after being screened, is fed into this at the top, and  properly moistened. The shaft is caused to rotate, and the blades divide  and subdivide the material, forcing it always downward, so that it at  last escapes at the bottom of the pug mill in a continuous stream of  moist, well worked up clay, issuing with some force. In one type of  machine this clay stream is forced through a square orifice, from which  it comes out of the section of a brick, and by a knife or wire or some  other means it is cut into lengths.    In another type of machine there is a large revolving drum working on a  horizontal axis, with open moulds all round its edge. The clay enters  these moulds, and there is an arrangement of plungers by which it is  first compressed within the mould and then forced out on to an endless  band or some other contrivance that receives it. A third type of machine  has the moulds in the flat top of a revolving table, which, as it turns,  carries each mould in succession first to a part where it is filled from  the pug mill, next to where its contents are compressed, and lastly to  where they are pushed out for removal. However made, the brick, when  moulded, dried, and burnt, and ready for market, belongs to some one  sort, and is distinguished from other sorts by its size, color, quality,  and peculiarities.    The sorts of brick that are to be met with in the London market are very  varied. To enumerate them all would make a tedious list; to describe  them all would be equally tedious. I will endeavor, however, to give  some idea of the most conspicuous of them. We will begin with that  family of bricks of which the London stock brick is the type. It has  been said these are clamp burnt, and almost all the internal  brickwork--and not a little of the external--of the metropolis is of  stock brickwork. A good London stock brick is an excellent brick for  general purposes, but cannot be called beautiful.    Considering the vast quantity of brickwork done in the metropolis, it is  a matter for congratulation that such sound materials as good stock  bricks, stone lime, and Thames sand are so easily procurable, and can be  had at a price that puts them within the reach of all respectable  builders. When a clamp has been burnt its contents are found to have  been unequally fired, and are part of them underburnt, part well burnt,  part overburnt. They are sorted accordingly into shuffs, grizzles,  stocks of two or three qualities, shippers, and burrs. Several sorts of  malm stocks, which are superior in color and texture, are made, and are  used for facing bricks and for cutting; and what are called paviors,  which are dark and strong bricks, are also made. The London stock is  erroneously, but usually, described as gray. It is really of a pie crust  yellow of various tones. Sometimes it is the same color when cut, but  the hardest stocks are of a dark, dirty purple or brown, or sometimes  nearly black inside. A stock brick is rarely quite square or quite true;  its surface is often disfigured by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1152"],[0,"The Story of the Volsungs (Volsunga Saga); with Excerpts from the Poetic Edda (#11)"],[1," king deemed he knew that the twain had come thither but for one  errand, and thought withal that war and trouble might be looked for  from the hands of him who brought not his end about; so he spake to his  daughter, and said--    \"Thou art a wise woman, and I have spoken it, that thou alone shalt  choose a husband for thyself; choose therefore between these two kings,  and my rede shall be even as thine.\"    \"A hard and troublous matter,\" says she; \"yet will I choose him who is  of greatest fame, King Sigmund to wife, albeit he is well stricken in  years.\"    So to him was she betrothed, and King Lyngi gat him gone. Then was  Sigmund wedded to Hjordis, and now each day was the feast better and  more glorious than on the day before it. But thereafter Sigmund went  back home to Hunland, and King Eylimi, his father-in-law, with him, and  King Sigmund betakes himself to the due ruling of his realm.    But King Lyngi and his brethren gather an army together to fall on  Sigmund, for as in all matters they were wont to have the worser lot,  so did this bite the sorest of all; and they would fain prevail over the  might and pride of the Volsungs. So they came to Hunland, and sent King  Sigmund word how that they would not steal upon him, and that they deemed  he would scarce slink away from them. So Sigmund said he would come and  meet them in battle, and drew his power together; but Hjordis was borne  into the wood with a certain bondmaid, and mighty wealth went with them;  and there she abode the while they fought.    Now the vikings rushed from their ships in numbers not to be borne up  against, but Sigmund the King, and Eylimi, set up their banners, and the  horns blew up to battle; but King Sigmund let blow the horn his father  erst had had, and cheered on his men to the fight, but his army was far  the fewest.    Now was that battle fierce and fell, and though Sigmund were old, yet  most hardily he fought, and was ever the foremost of his men; no shield  or byrny might hold against him, and he went ever through the ranks  of his foemen on that day, and no man might see how things would fare  between them; many an arrow and many a spear was aloft in air that day,  and so his spae-wrights wrought for him that he got no wound, and none  can tell over the tale of those who fell before him, and both his arms  were red with blood, even to the shoulders.    But now whenas the battle had dured a while, there came a man into  the fight clad in a blue cloak, and with a slouched hat on his head,  one-eyed he was, (1) and bare a bill in his hand; and he came against  Sigmund the King, and have up his bill against him, and as Sigmund smote  fiercely with the sword it fell upon the bill and burst asunder in the  midst: thenceforth the slaughter and dismay turned to his side, for the  good-hap of King Sigmund had departed from him, and his men fell fast  about him; naught did the king spare himself, but the rather cheered on  his men; but even as the saw says, \"No might 'gainst many\", so was it  now proven; and in this fight fell Sigmund the King, and King Eylimi,  his father-in-law, in the fore-front of their battle, and therewith the  more part of their folk.        ENDNOTES:    (1)  Odin coming to change the ownership of the sword he had         given Sigmund. See Chapter 3.        CHAPTER XII. Of the Shards of the Sword Gram, and how Hjordis went to  King Alf.    Now King Lyngi made for the king's abode, and was minded to take the  king's daughter there, but failed herein, for there he found neither  wife nor wealth: so he fared through all the realm, and gave his men  rule thereover, and now deemed that he had slain all the kin of the  Volsungs, and that he need dread them no more from henceforth.    Now Hjordis went amidst the slain that night of the battle, and came  whereas lay King Sigmund, and asked if he might be healed; but he  answered--    \"Many a man lives after hope has grown little; but my good-hap has  departed from me, nor will I suffer myself to be healed, nor wills Odin  that I should ever draw sword again, since this my sword and his is  broken; lo now, I have waged war while it was his will.\"    \"Naught ill would I deem matters,\" said she, \"if thou mightest be healed  and avenge my father.\"    The king said, \"That is fated for another man; behold now, thou art  great with a man-child; nourish him well and with good heed, and the  child shall be the noblest and most famed of all our kin: and keep well  withal the shards of the sword: thereof shall a goodly sword be made,  and it shall be called Gram, and our son shall bear it, and shall work  many a great work therewith, even such as eld shall never minish; for  his name shall abide and flourish as long as the world shall endure: and  let this be enow for thee. But now I grow weary with my wounds, and I  will go see our kin that have gone before me.\"    So Hjordis sat over him till he died at the day-dawning; and then she  looked, and behold, there came many ships sailing to the land: then she  spake to the handmaid--    \"Let us now change raiment, and be thou called by my name, and say that  thou art the king's daughter.\"    And thus they did; but now the vikings behold the great slaughter of men  there, and see where two women fare away thence into the wood; and they  deem that some great tidings must have befallen, and they leaped ashore  from out their ships. Now the captain of these folks was Alf, son of  Hjalprek, king of Denmark, who was sailing with his power along the  land. So they came into the field among the slain, and saw how many men  lay dead there; then the king bade go seek for the women and bring  them thither, and they did so. He asked them what women they were; and,  little as the thing seems like to be, the bondmaid answered for the  twain, telling of the fall of King Sigmund and King Eylimi, and many  another great man, and who they were withal who had wrought the deed.  Then the king asks if they wotted where the wealth of the king was  bestowed; and then says the bondmaid--    \"It may well be deemed that we know full surely thereof.\"    And therewith she guides them to the place where the treasure lay: and  there they found exceeding great wealth; so that men deem they have  never seen so many things of price heaped up together in one place. All  this they bore to the ships of King Alf, and Hjordis and the bondmaid  went with them. Therewith these sail away to their own realm, and talk  how that surely on that field had fallen the most renowned of kings.    So the king sits by the tiller, but the women abide in the forecastle;  but talk he had with the women and held their counsels of much account.    In such wise the king came home to his realm with great wealth, and he  himself was a man exceeding goodly to look on. But when he had been but  a little while at home, the queen, his mother, asked him why the fairest  of the two women had the fewer rings and the less worthy attire.    \"I deem,\" she said, \"that she whom ye have held of least account is the  noblest of the twain.\"    He answered: \"I too have misdoubted me, that she is little like a  bondwoman, and when we first met, in seemly wise she greeted noble men.  Lo now, we will make a trial of the thing.\"    So on a time as men sat at the drink, the king sat down to talk with the  women, and said:--    \"In what wise do ye note the wearing of the hours, whenas night grows  old, if ye may not see the lights of heaven?\"    Then says the bondwoman, \"This sign have I, that whenas in my youth I  was wont to drink much in the dawn, so now when I no longer use that  manner, I am yet wont to wake up at that very same tide, and by that  token do I know thereof.\"    Then the king laughed and said, \"Ill manners for a king's daughter!\" And  therewith he turned to Hjordis, and asked her even the same question;  but she answered--    \"My father erst gave me a little gold ring of such nature, that it  groweth cold on my finger in the day-dawning; and that is the sign that  I have to know thereof.\"    The king answered: \"Enow of gold there, where a very bondmaid bore it!  But come now, thou hast been long enow hid from me; yet if thou hadst  told me all from the beginning, I would have done to thee as though we  had both been one king's children: but better than thy deeds will I deal  with thee, for thou shalt be my wife, and due jointure will I pay thee  whenas thou hast borne me a child.\"    She spake therewith and told out the whole truth about herself: so there  was she held in great honour, and deemed the worthiest of women.        CHAPTER XIII. Of the Birth and Waxing of Sigurd Fafnir's-bane.    The tale tells that Hjordis brought forth a man-child, who was  straightly borne before King Hjalprek, and then was the king glad  thereof, when he saw the keen eyes in the head of him, and he said that  few men would be equal to him or like unto him in any wise. So he was  sprinkled with water, and had to name Sigurd, of whom all men speak  with one speech and say that none was ever his like for growth and  goodliness. He was brought up in the house of King Hjalprek in great  love and honour; and so it is, that whenso all the noblest men and  greatest kings are named in the olden tales, Sigurd is ever put before  them all, for might and prowess, for high mind and stout heart, wherewith  he was far more abundantly gifted than any man of the northern parts of  the wide world.    So Sigurd waxed in King Hjalprek's house, and there was no child but  loved him; through him was Hjordis betrothed to King Alf, and jointure  meted to her.    Now Sigurd's foster-father was hight Regin, the son of Hreidmar; he  taught him all manner of arts, the chess play, and the lore of runes,  and the talking of many tongues, even as the wont was with kings' sons  in those days. But on a day when they were together, Regin asked Sigurd,  if he knew how much wealth his father had owned, and who had the ward  thereof;"]]]
