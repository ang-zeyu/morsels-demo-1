Previous articles are summed up in that of  October, 1863, as a profession of the _Westminster's_ opinion  throughout: \"... the South are fighting for liberty to found a Slave  Power. Should it prove successful, truer devil's work, if we may use the  metaphor, will rarely have been done[61].\"    Fortunate would it have been for the Northern cause, if British opinion  generally sympathetic at first on anti-slavery grounds, had not soon  found cause to doubt the just basis of its sympathy, from the trend of  events in America. Lincoln had been elected on a platform opposing the  further territorial expansion of slavery. On that point the North was  fairly well united. But the great majority of those who voted for  Lincoln would have indignantly repudiated any purpose to take active  steps toward the extinction of slavery where it already existed. Lincoln  understood this perfectly, and whatever his opinion about the ultimate  fate of slavery if prohibited expansion, he from the first took the  ground that the terms of his election constituted a mandate limiting his  action. As secession developed he rightly centred his thought and effort  on the preservation of the Union, a duty imposed by his election to the  Presidency.    Naturally, as the crisis developed, there were many efforts at still  another great compromise. Among the friends of the outgoing President,  Buchanan, whose term of office would not expire until March 4, 1861,  there were still some Southern leaders, like Jefferson Davis, seeking  either a complete surrender to Southern will, or advantages for Southern  security in case secession was accomplished. Buchanan appealed  hysterically to the old-time love of the Union and to the spirit of  compromise. Great congressional committees of both Senate and House of  Representatives were formed seeking a solution. Crittenden for the  border states between North and South, where, more than anywhere else,  there was division of opinion, proposed pledges to be given to the  South. Seward, long-time champion of the anti-slavery North, was active  in the Senate in suggestion and intrigue seemingly intended to  conciliate by concessions. Charles Francis Adams, early a Free Soiler,  in the House of Representatives Committee conducted his Republican  colleagues along a path apparently leading to a guarantee of slavery as  then established[62]. A constitutional amendment was drafted to this  effect and received Lincoln's preliminary approval. Finally Lincoln, in  his inaugural address, March 4, 1861, declared:         \"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly to interfere with       the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I       believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no       inclination to do so.\"    It should be no matter for surprise, therefore, that, as these efforts  were observed in Great Britain, a note of uncertainty began to replace  the earlier unanimity of opinion that the future of slavery was at stake  in America. This offered an easy excuse for a switch-about of sympathy  as British commercial and other interests began to be developed, and  even dismayed the ardent friends of the anti-slavery North. Meanwhile  the Government of Great Britain, from the very first appearance of the  cloud of civil war, had focused its attention on the point of what the  events in America portended to British interests and policy. This is the  business of governments, and their agents would be condemned as  inefficient did they neglect it. But did British governmental policy go  beyond this entirely justifiable first thought for immediate British  interests to the point of positive hope that England would find an  advantage in the breaking up of the great American Republic? American  opinion, both then and later, believed Great Britain guilty of this  offence, but such criticism was tinged with the passions of the Civil  War. Yet a more impartial critic, though possibly an unfriendly one  because of his official position, made emphatic declaration to like  effect. On January 1, 1861, Baron de Brunow, Russian Ambassador at  London, reported to St. Petersburg that, \"the English Government, at the  bottom of its heart, desires the separation of North America into two  republics, which will watch each other jealously and counterbalance one  the other. Then England, on terms of peace and commerce with both,  would have nothing to fear from either; for she would dominate them,  restraining them by their rival ambitions[63].\"    If, however, one turns from the surmises of foreign diplomats as to the  springs of British policy, to the more authentic evidence of official  and private diplomatic correspondence, there is found no proof for such  accusations. Certainty neither Lord John Russell, Foreign Secretary, nor  Lord Lyons, British Minister at Washington, reveal any animus against  the United States. Considering his many personal ties with leaders of  both factions Lyons, from the first, reported events with wonderful  impartiality, and great clarity. On November 12, 1860, he sent to  Russell a full description of the clamour raised in the South over the  election of Lincoln, enumerated the resignation of Federal officials  (calling these \"ill-judged measures\"), and expressed the opinion that  Lincoln was no Radical. He hoped the storm would blow over without  damage to the Union[64]. Russell, for his part, was prompt to instruct  Lyons and the British consuls not \"to seem to favour one party rather  than the other,\" and not to express opinions or to give advice, unless  asked for by the State Governments, in which case the advice should be  against all violent action as tending toward civil war[65].    This bare statement may indeed be interpreted as indicating an eager  readiness on Russell's part to accept as final the dissolution of the  Union, but such an interpretation is not borne out by a reading of his  instructions. Rather he was perplexed, and anxious that British agents  should not gain the ill-will of either American faction, an ill-will  that would be alike detrimental in the future, whether the Union  remained unbroken or was destroyed.    Strict instructions against offering advice are therefore repeated  frequently[66]. Meanwhile the first concrete problem requiring British  action came from the seizure by South Carolina of the Federal customs  house at the port of Charleston, and the attempt of the State  authorities to collect port dues customarily paid to Federal officials.  British shipowners appealed to Consul Bunch for instructions, he to  Lyons, and the latter to the American Secretary of State, Judge Black.  This was on December 31, 1860, while Buchanan was still President, and  Black's answer was evasive, though asserting that the United States must  technically regard the events in South Carolina as acts of violent  rebellion[67]. Black refused to state what action would be taken if  Bunch advised British shipowners to pay, but a way out of the  embarrassment was found by advising such payment to State authorities  \"under protest\" as done \"under compulsion.\" To one of his letters to  Bunch on this topic, Lyons appended an expression indicative of his own  early attitude. \"The domestic slavery of the South is a bitter pill  which it will be hard enough to get the English to swallow. But if the  Slave Trade is to be added to the dose, the least squeamish British  stomach will reject it[68].\"    Nevertheless the vigorous action of South Carolina, soon followed by  other Southern States, made a deep impression on Russell, especially  when compared with the uncertainty and irresolution manifested in the  attempted compromise measures of Northern statesmen. In a private letter  to Lyons, January 10, 1861, he wrote \"I do not see how the United States  can be cobbled together again by any compromise.... I cannot see any  mode of reconciling such parties as these. The best thing _now_ would  be that the right to secede should be acknowledged.... I hope sensible  men will take this view.... But above all I hope no force will be  used[69].\" And again twelve days later, \"I suppose the break-up of the  Union is now inevitable[70].\" To Russell, as to most foreign observers,  it seemed that if the South with its great wealth, its enormous extent  of territory, and its five and one-half millions of population, were  determined to leave the Union, no force whatever could compel a return.  History failed to record any revolution on so large a scale which had  not succeeded. His desire, therefore, was that the North would yield to  the inevitable, and would not plunge into a useless civil war disastrous  alike to the prosperity of America and of foreign nations. Russell's  first hope was that the South would forgo secession; his second, this  accomplished, that there would be no war, and in this sense he  instructed Lyons. The latter, less expectant of peaceful separation, and  more aware of the latent power of the North, maintained throughout his  entire service at Washington that there was at least a _chance_ that the  North could subdue the South by might of arms[71], but he also, looking  to British interests, saw his early duty, before war broke, in cautious  suggestions against forcible Northern action. Thus from January to  March, 1861, British effort and indirect advice were based on the hope  that British trade interests might escape the tribulations inevitable  from a civil conflict in America. Beyond that point there was no grasp  of the complications likely to arise in case"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13796"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#11)"],[1,", but to produce conciliation;  he mingled in every one's affairs, not to pick up profit for himself,  but to prevent the villagers from running into losses and imprudent  speculations; he talked much, yet, it was not slander, but advice; he  thought more, yet it was not over mischief, but on schemes of good;  he was known to everybody, yet none that knew him respected him the  less on that account. He was a little, spare, merry-looking man, that  sought to appear grave when he was most inclined to merriment, and  if he considered himself a perfect genius in his plans for effecting  good, his vanity may be pardoned, because of the food it fed on.    M. Antoine Perron considered himself very ingenious, and if he had a  fault, it was his love of originality. He never liked to perform any  action in a common way, and never chuckled so gaily to himself, as  when he had achieved some charitable end by some extraordinary means.    It was seven months after the marriage of M. Pierre Lavalles, M.  Antoine Perron sat in his little parlor, and gazed with a glad eye  upon the cheerful fire, for the short winter was just terminating.  Leaning forward in his chair, he shaded his face with his hands, and  steadily perused the figures among the coals with a most pleasant  countenance. The room was small, neat, and comfortable, for the notary  prospered, in his humble way and seeking only comfort found it, and  was content.    Suddenly a violent knocking at the door aroused him from his reverie,  and he heard his old servant rushing to open it. In a moment, two  persons were ushered into the room, and the notary leaped to his  feet in astonishment at the extraordinary scene before him. Had a  thunderbolt cloven the roof, and passed through his hearth to its  grave in the center of the globe, or had the trees that nodded their  naked branches without the window commenced a dance upon the snowy  ground, he had not been more surprised.    Monsieur Pierre Lavalles, and Madame Pierre Lavalles stood just inside  the doorway. Never had Monsieur Perron seen them before, as he saw  them now. Like turtle-doves, with smiling eyes, and affectionate  caress, they had lived in happy harmony during the seven months of  their married life, and motherly dames, when they gave their daughters  away, bade them prosper and be pleasant in their union, as they had  been joyous in their love, pleasant and joyous, as neighbor Lavalles  and his wife.    Now, Pierre stood red and angry, with his right arm extended,  gesticulating toward his wife. Julie stood red and angry, with her  left arm extended, gesticulating toward her husband. Eyes, that had  only radiated smiles, flashed with fierce passion, as the turtle doves  remained near the door, each endeavoring to anticipate the other in  some address to the worthy notary. He, aghast and perplexed, waited  for the _denouement_.    \"Madame,\" said Monsieur Pierre Lavalles, \"allow me to speak.\"    \"Monsieur,\" said Madame Pierre Lavalles. \"I insist--\"    \"But, Madame, it is my--\"    \"But, Monsieur, I say I will.\"    \"And yet I will.\"    \"But no--\"    \"Madame, I shall.\"    \"Then be careful what you do; M. Perron, M. Lavalles is mad.\"    Then the lady, having thus emphatically declared herself, resigned the  right of speech to her husband, who began to jerk out in disconnected  phrases a statement of his case. Seven days ago he had annoyed his  wife by some incautious word; she had annoyed him by an incautious  answer; he had made matters worse by an aggravating retort; and she  had widened the breach by a bitter reply. This little squall was  succeeded by a cool calm, and that by a sullen silence, until some  sudden friction kindled a new flame, and finally, after successive  storms and lulls, there burst forth a furious conflagration, and  in the violent collision of their anger, the seven-months' married  pair vowed to separate, and with that resolve had visited M. Perron.  Reconciliation they declared was beyond possibility, and they  requested the notary at once to draw up the documents that should  consign them to different homes, to subsist on a divided patrimony,  in loveless and unhappy marriage. Each told a tale in turn, and the  manner of relation added fuel to the anger of the other. The man and  the woman seemed to have leaped out of their nature in the accession  of their passion. Pity that a quarrel should ever dilate thus, from a  cloud the size of a man's hand to a thunder-storm that covers heaven  with its black and dismal canopy.    Neither would listen to reason. The duty of the notary was to prepare  the process by which they were to be separated.    \"Monsieur,\" he said, \"I will arrange the affair for you; but you are  acquainted with the laws of France in this respect!\"    \"I know nothing of the law,\" replied M. Pierre Lavalles.    \"Madame,\" said the notary, \"your wish shall be complied with. But you  know what the law says on this head?\"    \"I never read a law book,\" sharply ejaculated Madame Pierre Lavalles.    \"Then,\" resumed the notary, \"the case is this. You must return to  your house, and I will proceed to settle the proceedings with the  Judicatory Court at Paris. They are very strict. You must furnish me  with all the documents relative to property.\"    \"I have them here,\" put in the husband, by way of parenthesis.    \"And the whole affair including correspondence, preparations of  instruments, &c., will be settled in less than three months.\"    \"Three months?\"    \"Three months. Yes, in less than three months.\"    \"Then I will live with a friend at the village, until it is finished,\"  said Madame Lavalles, in a decided, peremptory tone, usual with ladies  when they are a little ashamed of themselves, or any one else.    \"Oh, very well, Madame,--oh, very well.\"    \"Not at all well, Madame; not at all well, Monsieur,\" said the notary,  with a solid, immovable voice. \"You must live as usual. If you doubt  my knowledge of the law, you will, by reading through these seven  books, find that this fact is specified.\"    But the irritated couple were not disposed to undertake the  somniferous task, and shortly left the house, as they had come,  walking the same way, but at a distance of a yard or so one from  another.    Two months and twenty-seven days had passed, when the notary issued  from his house, and proceeded toward the house where Monsieur and  Madame Lavalles dwelt. Since the fatal night I have described, he  had not encountered them, and he now, with a bland face and confident  head, approached the dwelling.    It was a pretty place. Passing through the sunny vineyards where the  spring was just calling out the leaves, and the young shoots in their  tints of tender green were sprouting in the warmth of a pleasant day;  the notary entered a garden. Here the flowers, in infant bloom, had  prepared the earth for the coming season, for summer in her gay attire  was tripping from the south, and as she passed, nature wove garlands  to adorn her head, and wreathe about her arms. Early blossoms lent  sweetness to the breath of the idle winds that loitered in this  delightful spot, and the fair young primrose was sown over the  parterres, with other flowers of spring, the most delicate and softly  fragrant, that come out to live their hour in modesty and safety,  while the earth affords them room, and before the bright and gaudy  bloom of a riper season eclipses their beauty, bidding them, blushing,  close their petals.    Early roses twined on either side the porch, and as the notary  entered, nothing struck him more than the neat and cheerful appearance  of the place. A demoiselle ushered him into a little parlor, where  Monsieur Pierre Lavalles, and Madame Julie Lavalles, had just sat down  to partake breakfast.    A small table was drawn up close to the open window, and vernal  breezes found welcome in the chamber. A snowy cloth hung down to the  well-polished floor, and tall white cups were placed upon it to rival  it in purity and grace. Cakes of bread, such bread as is only had in  France, with delicious butter, and rich brown foaming coffee frothed  with cream, were spread before them, and a basket of fresh spring  flowers, sparkling with dew and beautifully odorous, scented the whole  chamber with a delicate perfume.    The husband and wife sat side by side, with pleasant looks, and so  engaged in light and amiable conversation, that they hardly noticed  the entrance of the notary. The storm had vanished and left no trace.  Flushes of anger, flashes of spite, quick breathings, and disordered  looks--all these had passed, and now smiles, and eyes lit only with  kindness, and bosoms beating with calm content, and looks all full of  love, were alone to be observed.    When M. Antoine Perron entered, they started; at length, and then  recollecting his mission, blushed crimson, looked one at another, and  then at the ground, awaiting his address.    \"Monsieur, and Madame,\" said the notary, \"according to your desires  I come with all the documents necessary for your separation, and the  division of your property. They only want your signature, and we will  call in your servant to be witness.\"    \"Stay,\" exclaimed Madame Julie, laughing at her husband, \"Pierre,  explain to M. Perron.\"    \"Ah, Monsieur Perron,\" said Monsieur Antoine Lavalles, \"we had  forgotten that, and hoped you had also. Say not a word of it to any  one.\"    \"No, not a word,\" said Madame Julie. \"We never quarreled but once  since we married, and we never mean to quarrel again.\"    \"Not unless you provoke it,\" said Monsieur Lavalles, audaciously. \"But  M. Perron, you will take breakfast with us?\"    \"You're a wicked wretch,\" said Madame Julie, tapping him on the cheek.  \"After breakfast, M. Perron, we will sign the papers.\"    \"After breakfast,\" said M. Pierre Lavalles, \"we will burn them.\"    \"We shall see,\" said the notary. \"Sign them or burn them. Madame Julie  Lavalles, your coffee is charming.\"           *   "]]]
