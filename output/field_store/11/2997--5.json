Teddy suggested a fillet  of green ribbon, and this Mr. Direck tried, but after prolonged  reflection before the glass rejected. He was still weighing the effect  of this fillet upon the mind of Miss Corner when Teddy left him to make  his own modest preparations. Teddy's departure gave him a chance for  profile studies by means of an arrangement of the long mirror and the  table looking-glass that he had been too shy to attempt in the presence  of the secretary. The general effect was quite satisfactory.    \"Wa-a-a-l,\" he said with a quaver of laughter, \"now who'd have thought  it?\" and smiled a consciously American smile at himself before going  down.    The company was assembling in the panelled hall, and made a brilliant  show in the light of the acetylene candles against the dark background.  Mr. Britling in a black velvet cloak and black silk tights was a deeper  shade among the shadows; the high lights were Miss Corner and her  sister, in glittering garments of peacock green and silver that gave a  snake-like quality to their lithe bodies. They were talking to the  German tutor, who had become a sort of cotton Cossack, a spectacled  Cossack in buff and bright green. Mrs. Britling was dignified and  beautiful in a purple djibbah, and her stepson had become a handsome  still figure of black and crimson. Teddy had contrived something  elaborate and effective in the Egyptian style, with a fish-basket and a  cuirass of that thin matting one finds behind washstands; the small boys  were brigands, with immensely baggy breeches and cummerbunds in which  they had stuck a selection of paper-knives and toy pistols and similar  weapons. Mr. Carmine and his young man had come provided with real  Indian costumes; the feeling of the company was that Mr. Carmine was a  mullah. The aunt-like lady with the noble nose stood out amidst these  levities in a black silk costume with a gold chain. She refused, it  seemed, to make herself absurd, though she encouraged the others to  extravagance by nods and enigmatical smiles. Nevertheless she had put  pink ribbons in her cap. A family of father, golden-haired mother, and  two young daughters, sympathetically attired, had just arrived, and were  discarding their outer wrappings with the assistance of host and  hostess.    It was all just exactly what Mr. Direck had never expected in England,  and equally unexpected was the supper on a long candle-lit table without  a cloth. No servants were present, but on a sideboard stood a cold  salmon and cold joints and kalter aufschnitt and kartoffel salat, and a  variety of other comestibles, and many bottles of beer and wine and  whisky. One helped oneself and anybody else one could, and Mr. Direck  did his best to be very attentive to Mrs. Britling and Miss Corner, and  was greatly assisted by the latter.    Everybody seemed unusually gay and bright-eyed. Mr. Direck found  something exhilarating and oddly exciting in all this unusual bright  costume and in this easy mutual service; it made everybody seem franker  and simpler. Even Mr. Britling had revealed a sturdy handsomeness that  had not been apparent to Mr. Direck before, and young Britling left no  doubts now about his good looks. Mr. Direck forgot his mission and his  position, and indeed things generally, in an irrational satisfaction  that his golden pheasants harmonised with the glitter of the warm and  smiling girl beside him. And he sat down beside her--\"You sit anywhere,\"  said Mrs. Britling--with far less compunction than in his ordinary  costume he would have felt for so direct a confession of preference. And  there was something in her eyes, it was quite indefinable and yet very  satisfying, that told him that now he escaped from the stern square  imperatives of his patriotic tailor in New York she had made a  discovery of him.    Everybody chattered gaily, though Mr. Direck would have found it  difficult to recall afterwards what it was they chattered about, except  that somehow he acquired the valuable knowledge that Miss Corner was  called Cecily, and her sister Letty, and then--so far old Essex custom  held--the masculine section was left for a few minutes for some  imaginary drinking, and a lighting of cigars and cigarettes, after which  everybody went through interwoven moonlight and afterglow to the barn.  Mr. Britling sat down to a pianola in the corner and began the familiar  cadences of \"Whistling Rufus.\"    \"You dance?\" said Miss Cecily Corner.    \"I've never been much of a dancing man,\" said Mr. Direck. \"What sort of  dance is this?\"    \"Just anything. A two-step.\"    Mr. Direck hesitated and regretted a well-spent youth, and then Hugh  came prancing forward with outstretched hands and swept her away.    Just for an instant Mr. Direck felt that this young man was a trifle  superfluous....    But it was very amusing dancing.    It wasn't any sort of taught formal dancing. It was a spontaneous retort  to the leaping American music that Mr. Britling footed out. You kept  time, and for the rest you did as your nature prompted. If you had a  partner you joined hands, you fluttered to and from one another, you  paced down the long floor together, you involved yourselves in romantic  pursuits and repulsions with other couples. There was no objection to  your dancing alone. Teddy, for example, danced alone in order to develop  certain Egyptian gestures that were germinating in his brain. There was  no objection to your joining hands in a cheerful serpent....    Mr. Direck hung on to Cissie and her partner. They danced very well  together; they seemed to like and understand each other. It was natural  of course for two young people like that, thrown very much together, to  develop an affection for one another.... Still, she was older by three  or four years.    It seemed unreasonable that the boy anyhow shouldn't be in love with  her....    It seemed unreasonable that any one shouldn't be in love with her....    Then Mr. Direck remarked that Cissie was watching Teddy's manoeuvres  over her partner's shoulder with real affection and admiration....    But then most refreshingly she picked up Mr. Direck's gaze and gave him  the slightest of smiles. She hadn't forgotten him.    The music stopped with an effect of shock, and all the bobbing, whirling  figures became walking glories.    \"Now that's not difficult, is it?\" said Miss Corner, glowing happily.    \"Not when you do it,\" said Mr. Direck.    \"I can't imagine an American not dancing a two-step. You must do the  next with me. Listen! It's 'Away Down Indiana' ... ah! I knew you  could.\"    Mr. Direck, too, understood now that he could, and they went off holding  hands rather after the fashion of two skaters.    \"My word!\" said Mr. Direck. \"To think I'd be dancing.\"    But he said no more because he needed his breath.    He liked it, and he had another attempt with one of the visitor  daughters, who danced rather more formally, and then Teddy took the  pianola and Mr. Direck was astonished by the spectacle of an eminent  British thinker in a whirl of black velvet and extremely active black  legs engaged in a kind of Apache dance in pursuit of the visitor wife.  In which Mr. Lawrence Carmine suddenly mingled.    \"In Germany,\" said Herr Heinrich, \"we do not dance like this. It could  not be considered seemly. But it is very pleasant.\"    And then there was a waltz, and Herr Heinrich bowed to and took the  visitor wife round three times, and returned her very punctually and  exactly to the point whence he had taken her, and the Indian young  gentleman (who must not be called \"coloured\") waltzed very well with  Cecily. Mr. Direck tried to take a tolerant European view of this brown  and white combination. But he secured her as soon as possible from this  Asiatic entanglement, and danced with her again, and then he danced with  her again.    \"Come and look at the moonlight,\" cried Mrs. Britling.    And presently Mr. Direck found himself strolling through the rose garden  with Cecily. She had the sweetest moonlight face, her white shining robe  made her a thing of moonlight altogether. If Mr. Direck had not been in  love with her before he was now altogether in love. Mamie Nelson, whose  freakish unkindness had been rankling like a poisoned thorn in his heart  all the way from Massachusetts, suddenly became Ancient History.    A tremendous desire for eloquence arose in Mr. Direck's soul, a desire  so tremendous that no conceivable phrase he could imagine satisfied it.  So he remained tongue-tied. And Cecily was tongue-tied, too. The scent  of the roses just tinted the clear sweetness of the air they breathed.    Mr. Direck's mood was an immense solemnity, like a dark ocean beneath  the vast dome of the sky, and something quivered in every fibre of his  being, like moonlit ripples on the sea. He felt at the same time a  portentous stillness and an immense enterprise....    Then suddenly the pianola, pounding a cake walk, burst out into ribald  invitation....    \"Come back to dance!\" cried Cecily, like one from whom a spell has just  been broken. And Mr. Direck, snatching at a vanishing scrap of  everything he had not said, remarked, \"I shall never forget this  evening.\"    She did not seem to hear that.    They danced together again. And then Mr. Direck danced with the visitor  lady, whose name he had never heard. And then he danced with Mrs.  Britling, and then he danced with Letty. And then it seemed time for him  to look for Miss Cecily again.    And so the cheerful evening passed until they were within a quarter of  an hour of Sunday morning. Mrs. Britling went to exert a restraining  influence upon the pianola.    \"Oh! one dance more!\" cried Cissie Corner.    \"Oh! one dance more!\" cried Letty.    \"One dance more,\" Mr. Direck supported, and then things really _had_ to  end.    There was a rapid putting out of candles and a stowing away of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14070"],[0,"English Grammar in Familiar Lectures (#11)"],[1,"     King                 queen        Lad                  lass        Lord                 lady        Man                  woman        Master               mistress        Milter               spawner        Nephew               niece        Ram                  ewe        Singer               songstress or singer        Sloven               slut        Son                  daughter        Stag                 hind        Uncle                aunt        Wizard               witch        Sir                  madam          2. _By a difference in termination_; as,        Abbot                abbess        Actor                actress        Administrator        administratrix        Adulterer            adulteress        Ambassador           ambassadress        Arbiter              arbitress        Auditor              auditress        Author               authoress        Baron                baroness        Benefactor           benefactress        Bridegroom           bride        Canon                canoness        Caterer              cateress        Chanter              chantress        Conductor            conductress        Count                countess        Czar                 czarina        Deacon               deaconess        Detracter            detractress        Director             directress        Duke                 dutchess        Elector              electress        Embassador           embassadress        Emperor              emperess        Enchanter            enchantress        Executor             executrix        Fornicator           fornicatress        God                  goddess        Governor             governess        Heir                 heiress        Hero                 heroine        Host                 hostess        Hunter               huntress        Inheritor            inheritress or inheritrix        Instructor           instructress        Jew                  Jewess        Lion                 lioness        Marquis              marchioness        Mayor                mayoress        Patron               patroness        Peer                 peeress        Poet                 poetess        Priest               priestess        Prince               princess        Prior                prioress        Prophet              prophetess        Proprietor           proprietress        Protector            protectress        Shepherd             shepherdess        Songster             songstress        Sorcerer             sorceress        Suiter               suitress        Sultan               sultaness or sultana        Tiger                tigress        Testator             testatrix        Traitor              traitress        Tutor                tutoress        Tyrant               tyranness        Victor               victress        Viscount             viscountess        Votary               votaress        Widower              widow          3. _By prefixing another word_; as,          A cock-sparrow        A hen-sparrow        A man-servant         A maid-servant        A he-goat             A she-goat        A he-bear             A she-bear        A male-child          A female-child        Male-descendants      Female-descendants      PERSON.    PERSON is a property of the noun and pronoun which varies the verb.    The _first person_ denotes the speaker.    The _second person_ denotes the person or thing spoken to; as, \"Listen,  _earth!\"_    The _third person_ denotes the person or thing spoken of; as, \"The  _earth_ thirsts.\"    Nouns have but _two_ persons, the second and third. When a man speaks,  the _pronoun I_ or _we_ is always used; therefore nouns can never be in  the _first_ person. In examples like the following, some philologists  suppose the noun to be in the _first_ person:--\"This may certify, that  I, _Jonas Taylor_, do hereby give and grant,\" &c. But it is evident,  that the speaker or writer, in introducing his own name, speaks _of_  himself; consequently the noun is of the _third person_.    If you wish to understand the persons of nouns, a little sober thought  is requisite; and, by exercising it, all difficulties will be removed.  If I say, my _son_, have you seen the young man? you perceive that the  noun _son_ is of the _second_ person, because I address myself _to_ him;  that is, he is spoken _to;_ but the noun _man_ is of the _third_  person, because he is spoken _of_. Again, if I say, young _man_, have  you seen my son? _man_ is of the _second_ person, and _son_ is of the  _third_.    \"Hast thou left thy blue course in the heavens, golden-haired _sun_ of  the sky?\"    \"_Father_, may the Great Spirit so brighten the chain of friendship  between us, that a child may find it, when the sun is asleep in his  wig-wam behind the western waters.\"      \"Lo, earth receives him from the bending skies!     Sink down, ye _mountains_, and, ye _valleys_, rise!\"    \"Eternal _Hope_, thy glittering wings explore     Earth's loneliest bounds, and ocean's wildest shore.\"    In these examples, the nouns, sun, father, mountains, valleys, and hope,  are of the _second_ person, and, as you will hereafter learn, in the  nominative case independent. Course, heavens, sky, Spirit, chain,  friendship, child, sun, wig-wam, waters, earth, skies, wings, earth,  bounds, ocean, and shore, are all of the _third_ person.    NUMBER.    Number is the distinction of objects, as one or more. Nouns are of two  numbers, the singular and the plural.    The _singular_ number implies but one; as, a _book_.    The _plural_ number implies more than one; as, _books_.        NOTES.        1. Some nouns are used only in the singular form; as, hemp, flax,      barley, wheat, pitch, gold, sloth, pride, honesty, meekness,      compassion, &c.; others only in the plural form; as, bellows,      scissors, ashes, riches, snuffers, tongs, thanks, wages, embers,      ides, pains, vespers, &c.        2. Some words are the same in both numbers; as, deer, sheep, swine;      and, also, hiatus, apparatus, series, species.        3. The plural number of nouns is generally formed by adding _s_ to      the singular; as, dove, doves; face, faces; but sometimes we add      _es_ in the plural; as, box, boxes; church, churches; lash, lashes;      cargo, cargoes.        4. Nouns ending in _f_ or _fe_, are rendered plural by a change of      that termination into _ves_; as, half, halves; wife, wives: except      grief, relief, reproof, and several others, which form their plurals      by the addition of _s_. Those ending in _ff_, have the regular      plural; as, ruff, ruffs; except staff, staves.        5. Nouns ending in _y_ in the singular, with no other vowel in the      same syllable, change it into _ies_ in the plural; as, beauty,      beauties; fly, flies. But the _y_ is not changed, where there is      another vowel in the syllable; as, key, keys; delay, delays;      attorney, attorneys; valley, valleys; chimney, chimneys.        6. _Mathematics, metaphysics, politics, optics, ethics, pneumatics,      hydraulics_, &c. are construed either as singular or plural nouns.        7. The word _news_ is always singular. The nouns _means, alms_, and      _amends_, though plural in form, may be either singular or plural in      signification. Antipodes, credenda, literati, and minutiae are      always plural. _Bandit_ is now used as the singular of Banditti.        8. The following nouns form their plurals not according to any      general rule; thus, man, men; woman, women; child, children; ox,      oxen; tooth, teeth; goose, geese; foot, feet; mouse, mice; louse,      lice; brother, brothers or brethren; cow, cows or kine; penny,      pence, or pennies when the coin is meant; die, dice _for play,_      dies _for coining;_ pea and fish, pease and fish when the species      is meant, but _peas_ and _fishes_ when we refer to the number; as,      six _peas_, ten _fishes_.        9. The following compounds form their plurals thus: handful,      handfuls; cupful, cupfuls; spoonful, spoonfuls:--brother-in-law,      brothers-in-law; court-martial, courts-martial.        The following words form their plurals according to the rules of the      languages from which they are adopted.            _Singular_         _Plural._        Antithesis        antitheses        Apex              apices        Appendix          appendixes _or_ appendices        Arcanum           arcana        Automaton         automata        Axis              axes        Basis             bases        Beau              beaux _or_ beaus        Calx              calces _or_ calxes        Cherub            cherubim _or_ cherubs        Crisis            crises        Criterion         criteria        Datum             data        Diaeresis          diaereses        Desideratum       desiderata        Effluvium         effluvia        Ellipsis          ellipses        Emphasis          emphases        Encomium          encomia _or_ encomiums        Erratum           errata        Genius            genii [2]        Genus             genera        Hypothesis        hypotheses        Ignis fatuus,     ignes fatui        Index             indices _or_ indexes [3]        Lamina            laminae        Magus             magi        Memorandum        memoranda _or_ memorandums        Metamorphosis     metamorphoses        Parenthesis       parentheses        Phenomenon        phenomena        Radius            radii _or_ radiuses        Stamen            stamina        Seraph            seraphim _or_ seraphs        Stimulus          stimuli        Stratum           strata        Thesis            theses        Vertex            vertices        Vortex            vortices _or_ vortexes      [2] Genii, imaginary spirits: geniuses, persons of great mental  abilities.
