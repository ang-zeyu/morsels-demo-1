His Majesty, having taken the said Memorial into consideration, was  pleased, by and with the advice of his Privy Council, to approve thereof  and the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty are to  give the necessary directions herein accordingly.    (Signed) JAMES HILLER.    Thus, it appeared that the Admiralty were to choose three persons from  among the Council of the Royal Society, who were to have a hundred a  year each during the pleasure of the Admiralty.    Such an open attack on the independence of the Council could not escape  the remarks of some of the members, and a kind of mild remonstrance was  made, in which the real ground of complaint was omitted.    MINUTE OF COUNCIL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY. December 18, 1823.    RESOLVED, That in acknowledging the communication of the Lords  Commissioners of the Admiralty, made to the Council of the Royal  Society, on the 20th of November last, it be represented to them that  inconvenience may arise from the plan therein specified, from the  circumstance of all the members of the Council being annually elected  by the Society at large; and that body being consequently subject to  continual changes from year to year.    This was answered by the following letter from the Secretary of the  Admiralty:    ADMIRALTY OFFICE, DEC. 30, 1828.    SIR, Having submitted to my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty your  Letter of the 18th instant, subjoining an extract from the Minutes of  the proceedings of the Council of the Royal Society, arising out of the  communication made to them by their Lordships, on the subject of his  Majesty's Order in Council, of the fifth of October last, I have their  Lordships' command to acquaint you, for the information of the President  and Council, and with reference to what they have stated as to the  inconvenience which may arise from the intended plan of limiting their  Lordships' choice of members of the Resident Committee of Scientific  Advice to the Council of the Royal Society, that their Lordships were  induced to recommend this plan to his Majesty as a mark of respect to  the Society, and as a pledge to the public of the qualification of the  persons chosen. Nor did their Lordships apprehend any inconvenience from  the circumstance stated in the Minute of the Council, of the Members  being annually elected, as the Resident Committee is also annually  appointed; and, in point of fact, no practical inconvenience has been  felt during the ten years that the Committee has been in existence,  as four of the distinguished gentlemen whom their Lordships have  successively appointed to this office, have continued during the whole  period to be members of the Council; and if any such difficulty or  inconvenience should hereafter arise, their Lordships will be ready to  take proper measures for remedying it.    Their Lordships' intention therefore is, to propose to Captain Kater and  Mr. Herschel, to continue to fill this office; and to Dr. Young, who had  resigned it, on receiving the appointment of Secretary to the late Board  of Longitude, to be appointed.    I am, Sir, Your obedient servant,    JOHN BARROW.    The representation made by the Council was not calculated to produce  much effect; but the Secretary of the Admiralty, who knew well the stuff  of which Councils of the Royal Society are composed, might have spared  the bitter irony of making their Lordships say, that they recommended  this plan \"AS A MARK OF RESPECT TO THE SOCIETY,\" and \"AS A PLEDGE TO  THE PUBLIC OF THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE PERSONS CHOSEN,\" whilst he  delicately hints to them their dependent situation, by observing, that  the \"RESIDENT COMMITTEE IS ALSO ANNUALLY APPOINTED.\"    The Secretary knew that, PRACTICALLY speaking, it had been the custom  for years for the President of the Royal Society to nominate the  Council, and consequently he knew that every scientific adviser must  first be indebted to the President for being qualified to advise, and  then to the Admiralty for deriving profit from his counsel. Thus then  their Lordships, as a \"MARK OF RESPECT FOR THE SOCIETY\" confirm the  dependence of the Council on the President, by making his nomination  a qualification for place, and establish a new dependence of the same  Council on themselves, by giving a hundred pounds each year to such  three members of that Council as they may select. \"THE PLEDGE\" they  offer \"TO THE PUBLIC, OF THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE PERSONS CHOSEN,\" is,  that Mr. Davies Gilbert had previously thought they would do for his  Council.    What the Society, when they are acquainted with it, may think of this  mark of respect, or what value the public may put upon this pledge, must  be left to themselves to express.    In looking over the list of officers and Council of the Royal Society  the weakest perhaps (for purposes of science) which was ever made, a  consolation arises from the possibility of some of those who were placed  there by way of compliment, occasionally attending. In that contracted  field Lord Melville's penetration may not be uselessly employed; and the  soldier who presides over our colonies may judge whether the principles  which pervade it are open and liberal as his own.    The inconvenience to the public service from such an arrangement is,  that the number out of which the advisers are selected must, in  any case, be very small; and may, from several circumstances, be  considerably reduced. In a council fairly selected, to judge of  the merits of the various subjects likely to be brought under the  consideration of the Society, anatomy, chemistry, and the different  branches of natural history, will share with the numerous departments of  physical science, in claiming to be represented by persons competently  skilled in those subjects. These claims being satisfied, but few places  will be left to fill up with mathematicians, astronomers, and persons  conversant with nautical astronomy.    Let us look at the present Council. Is there a single mathematician  amongst them, if we except Mr Barlow, whose deservedly high reputation  rests chiefly on his physical and experimental inquiries, and whom the  President and the Admiralty have clearly shown they do not look upon as  a mathematician, by not appointing him an adviser?    Small as the number of those persons on the Council, who are conversant  with the three subjects named in the Act of Parliament, must usually  be, it may be still further diminished. The President, when he forms  his Council, may decline naming those members who are most fit for such  situations. Or, on the other hand, some of those members who are best  qualified for them, from their knowledge, may decline the honour of  being the nominees of Mr. Gilbert, as Vice Presidents, Treasurers, or  Councillors, and thus lending their names to support a system of which  they disapprove.    Whether the first of these causes has ever operated can be best  explained by those gentlemen who have been on the Council. The refusals  are, notwithstanding the President's taciturnity on the subject, better  known than he is willing that they should be.    Having discussed the general policy of the measure, with reference both  to the Society and to the public, and without the slightest reference  to the individuals who may have refused or accepted those situations, I  shall now examine the propriety of the appointments that have been made.    Doubtless the gentlemen who now hold those situations either have never  considered the influence such a mode of selection would have on the  character of the Council; or, having considered it, they must have  arrived at a different conclusion from mine. There may, however,  be arguments which I have overlooked, and a discussion of them must  ultimately lead to truth: but I confess that it appears to me the  objections which have been stated rest on principles of human nature,  too deeply seated to be easily removed.    That I am not singular in the view I have taken of this subject, appears  from several circumstances. A question was asked respecting these  appointments at the Anniversary before the last; and, from the nature of  the answer, many of the members of the Society have been led to believe  the objections have been removed. Several Fellows of the Society, who  knew these facts, thought it inexpedient ever to vote for placing any  gentleman on the Council who had accepted these situations; and,  having myself the same view of the case, I applied to the Council to be  informed of the names of the present Scientific Advisers. But although  they remonstrated against the PRINCIPLE,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12169"],[0,"Sakoontala; Or, The Lost Ring: An Indian Drama (#11)"],[1,"but feign an idle passion, friend,    Take not in earnest what was said in jest.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Don't distress yourself; I quite understand.                                                           [_Exeunt_.           *       *       *       *       *          PRELUDE TO ACT III.    SCENE.--_The Hermitage_.    _Enter a_ YOUNG BRAHMAN _carrying bundles of ku[S']a-grass for the  use of the sacrificing priest_.    YOUNG BRAHMAN.    How wonderful is the power of King Dushyanta! No sooner did he  enter our hermitage, than we were able to proceed with our  sacrificial rites, unmolested by the evil demons.      No need to fix the arrow to the bow;    The mighty monarch sounds the quivering string,    And, by the thunder of his arms dismayed,    Our demon foes are scattered to the wind.    I must now, therefore, make haste and deliver to the sacrificing  priests these bundles of Ku[s']a-grass, to be strewn round the  altar.    [_Walking and looking about; then addressing some one off the  stage_.]    Why, Priyamvada, for whose use are you carrying that ointment of  Usira-root and those lotus-leaves with fibres attached to them?    [_Listening for her answer_.]    What Say you?--that [S']akoontala is suffering from fever produced  by exposure to the sun, and that this ointment is to cool her  burning frame? Nurse her with care, then, Priyamvada, for she is  cherished by our reverend Superior as the very breath of his  nostrils[46]. I, for my part, will contrive that soothing waters,  hallowed in the sacrifice, he administered to her by the hands of  Gautami.                                                             [_Exit_.      ACT III.      SCENE.--_The Sacred Grove_.    _Enter_ KING DUSHYANTA, _with the air of one in love_.    KING.                                    [_Sighing thoughtfully_.      The holy sage possesses magic power    In virtue of his penance; she, his ward,    Under the shadow of his tutelage,    Rests in security, I know it well;    Yet sooner shall the rushing cataract    In foaming eddies re-ascend the steep,    Than my fond heart turn back from its pursuit.    God of love! God of the flowery shafts [47]! we lovers are cruelly  deceived by thee, and by the Moon, however deserving of confidence  you may both appear.      For not to us do these thine arrows seem    Pointed with tender flowerets; not to us    Doth the pale Moon irradiate the earth    With beams of silver fraught with cooling dews;    But on our fevered frames the moon-beams fall    Like darts of fire, and every flower-tipt shaft    Of Kama[47], as it probes our throbbing hearts,    Seems to be barbed with hardest adamant.    Adorable god of love! hast thou no pity for me?    [_In a tone of anguish_.]    How can thy arrows be so sharp when they are pointed with  flowers? Ah! I know the reason:      E'en now in thine unbodied essence lurks    The fire of [S']iva's anger[48], like the flame    That ever hidden in the secret depths    Of ocean, smoulders there unseen[49]. How else    Could'st thou, all immaterial as thou art,    Inflame our hearts thus fiercely?--thou, whose form    Was scorched to ashes by a sudden flash    From the offended god's terrific eye.    Yet, methinks,      Welcome this anguish, welcome to my heart    These rankling wounds inflicted by the god,    Who on his scutcheon bears the monster-fish[50]    Slain by his prowess; welcome death itself,    So that, commissioned by the lord of love,    This fair one be my executioner.    Adorable divinity! Can I by no reproaches excite your commiseration?    Have I not daily offered at thy shrine    Innumerable vows, the only food    Of thine ethereal essence? Are my prayers    Thus to be slighted? Is it meet that thou    Should'st aim thy shafts at thy true votary's heart,    Drawing thy bow-string even to thy ear?    [_Pacing up and down in a melancholy manner_.]    Now that the holy men have completed their rites, and have no  more need of my services, how shall I dispel my melancholy?    [_Sighing_.]    I have but one resource. Oh for another sight of the Idol of my  soul! I will seek her.    [_Glancing at the sun_.]    In all probability, as the sun's heat is now at its height,  [S']akoontala is passing her time under the shade of the bowers on  the banks of the Malini, attended by her maidens. I will go and  look for her there.    [_Walking and looking about_.]    I suspect the fair one has but just passed by this avenue of  young trees.      Here, as she tripped along, her fingers plucked    The opening buds; these lacerated plants,    Shorn of their fairest blossoms by her hand,    Seem like dismembered trunks, whose recent wounds    Are still unclosed; while from the bleeding socket    Of many a severed stalk, the milky juice    Still slowly trickles, and betrays her path.    [_Feeling a breeze_.]    What a delicious breeze meets me in this spot!      Here may the zephyr, fragrant with the scent    Of lotuses, and laden with the spray    Caught from the waters of the rippling stream,    Fold in its close embrace my fevered limbs.    [_Walking and looking about_.]    She must be somewhere in the neighbourhood of this arbour of  overhanging creepers enclosed by plantations of cane;    [_Looking down_.]      For at the entrance here I plainly see    A line of footsteps printed in the sand.    Here are the fresh impressions of her feet;    Their well-known outline faintly marked in front,    More deeply towards the heel; betokening    The graceful undulation of her gait[51].    I will peep through those branches.     [_Walking and looking. With transport_.]    Ah! now my eyes are gratified by an entrancing sight. Yonder is  the beloved of my heart reclining on a rock strewn with flowers,  and attended by her two friends. How fortunate! Concealed behind  the leaves, I will listen to their conversation, without raising  their suspicions.                              [_Stands concealed, and gazes at them_.    [S']AKOONTALA _and her two attendants, holding fans in their hands,  are discovered as described_.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.                             [_Fanning her. In a tone of affection_.    Dearest [S']akoontala, is the breeze raised by these broad  lotus-leaves refreshing to you?    [S']AKOONTALA.    Dear friends, why should you trouble yourselves to fan me?    [PRIYAMVADA _and_ ANASUYA _look sorrowfully at one another_.    KING.    [S']akoontala seems indeed to be seriously ill.    [_Thoughtfully_.]    Can it be the intensity of the heat that has affected her? or  does my heart suggest the true cause of her malady?    [_Gazing at her passionately_.]    Why should I doubt it?      The maiden's spotless bosom is o'erspread    With cooling balsam; on her slender arm    Her only bracelet, twined with lotus-stalks,    Hangs loose and withered; her recumbent form    Betokens languor. Ne'er could noon-day sun    Inflict such fair disorder on a maid--    No, love, and love alone, is here to blame.      PRIYAMVADA.                                  [_Aside to_ ANASUYA.    I have observed, Anasuya, that [S']akoontala has been indisposed  ever since her first interview with King Dushyanta. Depend upon  it, her ailment is to be traced to that source.    ANASUYA.    The same suspicion, dear, has crossed my mind. But I will at once  ask her and ascertain the truth.    [_Aloud_.]    Dear [S']akoontala, I am about to put a question to you. Your  indisposition is really very serious.    [S']AKOONTALA.                       [_Half rising from her couch_.    What were you going to ask?    ANASUYA.    We know very little about love-matters, dear [S']akoontala; but for  all that, I cannot help suspecting your present state to be  something similar to that of the lovers we have heard about in  romances. Tell us frankly what is the cause of your disorder. It  is useless to apply a remedy, until the disease be understood.    KING.    Anasuya bears me out in my suspicion.    [S']AKOONTALA.                                            [_Aside_.    I am, indeed, deeply in love; but cannot rashly  disclose my passion to these young girls.    PRIYAMVADA.    What Anasuya says, dear [S']akoontala, is very just. Why give so  little heed to your ailment? Every day you are becoming thinner;  though I must confess your complexion is still as beautiful as  ever.    KING.    Priyamvada speaks most truly.      Sunk is her velvet cheek; her wasted bosom    Loses its fulness; e'en her slender waist    Grows more attenuate; her face is wan,    Her shoulders droop;--as when the vernal blasts    Sear the young blossoms of the Madhavi[52],    Blighting their bloom; so mournful is the change.    Yet in its sadness, fascinating still,    Inflicted by the mighty lord of love    On the fair figure of the hermit's daughter.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Dear friends, to no one would I rather reveal the nature of my  malady than to you; but I should only be troubling you.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    Nay, this is the very point about which we are so solicitous.  Sorrow shared with affectionate friends is relieved of half its  poignancy.    KING.      Pressed by the partners of her joys and griefs,    Her much beloved companions, to reveal    The cherished secret locked within her breast,    She needs must utter it; although her looks    Encourage me to hope, my bosom throbs    As anxiously I listen for her answer.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Know then, dear friends, that from the first moment the  illustrious Prince who is the guardian of our sacred grove  presented himself to my sight--                                [_Stops short, and appears confused_.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    Say on, dear [S']akoontala, say on.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Ever since that happy moment, my heart's affections have been  fixed upon him, and my energies of mind and body have all  deserted me, as you see.    KING.
