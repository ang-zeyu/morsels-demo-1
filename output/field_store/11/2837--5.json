At receiving this stab, the great fish appeared to feel  no hurt for it showed no signs of pain, and, at that, the bo'sun was  further emboldened to go nearer, so that he might deliver a more deadly  wound; yet scarce had he taken two steps before the hideous thing was  upon him, and, but for an agility wonderful in so great a man, he had  been destroyed. Yet, spite of so narrow an escape from death, he was not  the less determined to wound or destroy the creature, and, to this end,  he dispatched some of us to the grove of reeds to get half a dozen of the  strongest, and when we returned with these, he bade two of the men lash  their spears securely to them, and by this means they had now spears of a  length of between thirty and forty feet. With these, it was possible to  attack the devilfish without coming within reach of its tentacles. And  now being ready, he took one of the spears, telling the biggest of the  men to take the other. Then he directed him to aim for the right eye of  the huge fish whilst he would attack the left.    Now since the creature had so nearly captured the bo'sun, it had ceased  to tug at the boat, and lay silent, with its tentacles spread all about  it, and its great eyes appearing just over the stern, so that it  presented an appearance of watching our movements; though I doubt if it  saw us with any clearness; for it must have been dazed with the  brightness of the sunshine.    And now the bo'sun gave the signal to attack, at which he and the man ran  down upon the creature with their lances, as it were in rest. The  bo'sun's spear took the monster truly in its left eye; but the one  wielded by the man was too bendable, and sagged so much that it struck  the stern-post of the boat, the knife blade snapping off short. Yet it  mattered not; for the wound inflicted by the bo'sun's weapon was so  frightful, that the giant cuttlefish released the boat, and slid back  into deep water, churning it into foam, and gouting blood.    For some minutes we waited to make sure that the monster had indeed gone,  and after that, we hastened to the boat, and drew her up so far as we  were able; after which we unloaded the heaviest of her contents, and so  were able to get her right clear of the water.    And for an hour afterwards the sea all about the little beach was stained  black, and in places red.          VIII    The Noises in the Valley      Now, so soon as we had gotten the boat into safety, the which we did with  a most feverish haste, the bo'sun gave his attention to Job; for the boy  had not yet recovered from the blow which the loom of the oar had dealt  him beneath the chin when the monster snatched at it. For awhile, his  attentions produced no effect; but presently, having bathed the lad's  face with water from the sea, and rubbed rum into his chest over the  heart, the youth began to show signs of life, and soon opened his eyes,  whereupon the bo'sun gave him a stiff jorum of the rum, after which he  asked him how he seemed in himself. To this Job replied in a weak voice  that he was dizzy and his head and neck ached badly, on hearing which,  the bo'sun bade him keep lying until he had come more to himself. And so  we left him in quietness under a little shade of canvas and reeds; for  the air was warm and the sand dry, and he was not like to come to any  harm there.    At a little distance, under the directing of the bo'sun, we made to  prepare dinner, for we were now very hungry, it seeming a great while  since we had broken our fast. To this end, the bo'sun sent two of the men  across the island to gather some of the dry seaweed; for we intended to  cook some of the salt meat, this being the first cooked meal since ending  the meat which we had boiled before leaving the ship in the creek.    In the meanwhile, and until the return of the men with the fuel, the  bo'sun kept us busied in various ways. Two he sent to cut a bundle of the  reeds, and another couple to bring the meat and the iron boiler, the  latter being one that we had taken from the old brig.    Presently, the men returned with the dried seaweed, and very curious  stuff it seemed, some of it being in chunks near as thick as a man's  body; but exceeding brittle by reason of its dryness. And so in a little,  we had a very good fire going, which we fed with the seaweed and pieces  of the reeds, though we found the latter to be but indifferent fuel,  having too much sap, and being troublesome to break into convenient size.    Now when the fire had grown red and hot, the bo'sun half filled the  boiler with sea water, in which he placed the meat; and the pan, having a  stout lid, he did not scruple to place it in the very heart of the fire,  so that soon we had the contents boiling merrily.    Having gotten the dinner under way, the bo'sun set about preparing our  camp for the night, which we did by making a rough framework with the  reeds, over which we spread the boat's sails and the cover, pegging the  canvas down with tough splinters of the reed. When this was completed, we  set-to and carried there all our stores, after which the bo'sun took us  over to the other side of the island to gather fuel for the night, which  we did, each man bearing a great double armful.    Now by the time that we had brought over, each of us, two loads of the  fuel, we found the meat to be cooked, and so, without more to-do, set  ourselves down and made a very good meal off it and some biscuits, after  which we had each of us a sound tot of the rum. Having made an end of  eating and drinking, the bo'sun went over to where Job lay, to inquire  how he felt, and found him lying very quiet, though his breathing had a  heavy touch about it. However, we could conceive of nothing by which he  might be bettered, and so left him, being more hopeful that Nature would  bring him to health than any skill of which we were possessed.    By this time it was late afternoon, so that the bo'sun declared we might  please ourselves until sunset, deeming that we had earned a very good  right to rest; but that from sunset till the dawn we should, he told us,  have each of us to take turn and turn about to watch; for though we were  no longer upon the water, none might say whether we were out of danger or  not, as witness the happening of the morning; though, certainly, he  apprehended no danger from the devil-fish so long as we kept well away  from the water's edge.    And so from now until dark most of the men slept; but the bo'sun spent  much of that time in overhauling the boat, to see how it might chance to  have suffered during the storm, and also whether the struggles of the  devil-fish had strained it in any way. And, indeed, it was speedily  evident that the boat would need some attention; for the plank in her  bottom next but one to the keel, upon the starboard side, had been burst  inwards; this having been done, it would seem, by some rock in the beach  hidden just beneath the water's edge, the devil-fish having, no doubt,  ground the boat down upon it. Happily, the damage was not great; though  it would most certainly have to be carefully repaired before the boat  would be again seaworthy. For the rest, there seemed to be no other part  needing attention.    Now I had not felt any call to sleep, and so had followed the bo'sun to  the boat, giving him a hand to remove the bottom-boards, and finally to  slue her bottom a little upwards, so that he might examine the leak more  closely. When he had made an end with the boat, he went over to the  stores, and looked closely into their condition, and also to see how they  were lasting. And, after that, he sounded all the water-breakers; having  done which, he remarked that it would be well for us if we could discover  any fresh water upon the island.    By this time it was getting on towards evening, and the bo'sun went  across to look at Job, finding him much as he had been when we visited  him after dinner. At that, the bo'sun asked me to bring across one of the  longer of the bottom-boards, which I did, and we made use of it as a  stretcher to carry the lad into the tent. And afterwards, we carried all  the loose woodwork of the boat into the tent, emptying the lockers of  their contents, which included some oakum, a small boat's hatchet, a coil  of one-and-a-half-inch hemp line, a good saw, an empty colza-oil tin, a  bag of copper nails, some bolts and washers, two fishing-lines, three  spare tholes, a three-pronged grain without the shaft, two balls of spun  yarn, three hanks of roping-twine, a piece of canvas with four  roping-needles stuck in it, the boat's lamp, a spare plug, and a roll of  light duck for making boat's sails.    And so, presently, the dark came down upon the island, at which the  bo'sun waked the men, and bade them throw more fuel on to the fire, which  had burned down to a mound of glowing embers much shrouded in ash. After  that, one of them part filled the boiler with fresh water, and soon we  were occupied most pleasantly upon a supper of cold, boiled salt-meat,  hard biscuits, and rum mixed with hot water. During supper, the bo'sun  made clear to the men regarding the watches, arranging how they should  follow, so that I found I was set down to take my turn from midnight  until one of the clock. Then, he explained to them about the burst plank  in the bottom of the boat, and how that it would have to be put right  before we could hope to leave the island, and that after that night we  should have to go most strictly with the victuals; for there seemed to be  nothing upon the island, that we had up till then discovered, fit to  satisfy our bellies. More than this, if we could find no fresh water, he  should have to distil some to make up for that which we had drunk, and  this must be done before leaving the island.    Now by the time that the bo'sun had made an end of explaining these  matters, we had ceased from eating, and soon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10554"],[0,"Right Ho, Jeeves (#11)"],[1," about my side of the thing?\" he demanded, in a voice choked  with feeling.    \"Your side?\"    \"You don't suppose,\" said Tuppy, with rising vehemence, \"that I would  have exposed this dashed synthetic shark for the flatfish it undoubtedly  was if there had not been causes that led up to it. What induced me to  speak as I did was the fact that Angela, the little squirt, had just been  most offensive, and I seized the opportunity to get a bit of my own  back.\"    \"Offensive?\"    \"Exceedingly offensive. Purely on the strength of my having let fall some  casual remark--simply by way of saying something and keeping the  conversation going--to the effect that I wondered what Anatole was going  to give us for dinner, she said that I was too material and ought not  always to be thinking of food. Material, my elbow! As a matter of fact,  I'm particularly spiritual.\"    \"Quite.\"    \"I don't see any harm in wondering what Anatole was going to give us for  dinner. Do you?\"    \"Of course not. A mere ordinary tribute of respect to a great artist.\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"All the same----\"    \"Well?\"    \"I was only going to say that it seems a pity that the frail craft of  love should come a stinker like this when a few manly words of  contrition----\"    He stared at me.    \"You aren't suggesting that I should climb down?\"    \"It would be the fine, big thing, old egg.\"    \"I wouldn't dream of climbing down.\"    \"But, Tuppy----\"    \"No. I wouldn't do it.\"    \"But you love her, don't you?\"    This touched the spot. He quivered noticeably, and his mouth twisted.  Quite the tortured soul.    \"I'm not saying I don't love the little blighter,\" he said, obviously  moved. \"I love her passionately. But that doesn't alter the fact that I  consider that what she needs most in this world is a swift kick in the  pants.\"    A Wooster could scarcely pass this. \"Tuppy, old man!\"    \"It's no good saying 'Tuppy, old man'.\"    \"Well, I do say 'Tuppy, old man'. Your tone shocks me. One raises the  eyebrows. Where is the fine, old, chivalrous spirit of the Glossops.\"    \"That's all right about the fine, old, chivalrous spirit of the Glossops.  Where is the sweet, gentle, womanly spirit of the Angelas? Telling a  fellow he was getting a double chin!\"    \"Did she do that?\"    \"She did.\"    \"Oh, well, girls will be girls. Forget it, Tuppy. Go to her and make it  up.\"    He shook his head.    \"No. It is too late. Remarks have been passed about my tummy which it is  impossible to overlook.\"    \"But, Tummy--Tuppy, I mean--be fair. You once told her her new hat made  her look like a Pekingese.\"    \"It did make her look like a Pekingese. That was not vulgar abuse. It was  sound, constructive criticism, with no motive behind it but the kindly  desire to keep her from making an exhibition of herself in public.  Wantonly to accuse a man of puffing when he goes up a flight of stairs  is something very different.\"    I began to see that the situation would require all my address and  ingenuity. If the wedding bells were ever to ring out in the little  church of Market Snodsbury, Bertram had plainly got to put in some  shrewdish work. I had gathered, during my conversation with Aunt Dahlia,  that there had been a certain amount of frank speech between the two  contracting parties, but I had not realized till now that matters had  gone so far.    The pathos of the thing gave me the pip. Tuppy had admitted in so many  words that love still animated the Glossop bosom, and I was convinced  that, even after all that occurred, Angela had not ceased to love him. At  the moment, no doubt, she might be wishing that she could hit him with a  bottle, but deep down in her I was prepared to bet that there still  lingered all the old affection and tenderness. Only injured pride was  keeping these two apart, and I felt that if Tuppy would make the first  move, all would be well.    I had another whack at it.    \"She's broken-hearted about this rift, Tuppy.\"    \"How do you know? Have you seen her?\"    \"No, but I'll bet she is.\"    \"She doesn't look it.\"    \"Wearing the mask, no doubt. Jeeves does that when I assert my  authority.\"    \"She wrinkles her nose at me as if I were a drain that had got out of  order.\"    \"Merely the mask. I feel convinced she loves you still, and that a kindly  word from you is all that is required.\"    I could see that this had moved him. He plainly wavered. He did a sort of  twiddly on the turf with his foot. And, when he spoke, one spotted the  tremolo in the voice:    \"You really think that?\"    \"Absolutely.\"    \"H'm.\"    \"If you were to go to her----\"    He shook his head.    \"I can't do that. It would be fatal. Bing, instantly, would go my  prestige. I know girls. Grovel, and the best of them get uppish.\" He  mused. \"The only way to work the thing would be by tipping her off in  some indirect way that I am prepared to open negotiations. Should I sigh  a bit when we meet, do you think?\"    \"She would think you were puffing.\"    \"That's true.\"    I lit another cigarette and gave my mind to the matter. And first crack  out of the box, as is so often the way with the Woosters, I got an idea.  I remembered the counsel I had given Gussie in the matter of the sausages  and ham.    \"I've got it, Tuppy. There is one infallible method of indicating to a  girl that you love her, and it works just as well when you've had a row  and want to make it up. Don't eat any dinner tonight. You can see how  impressive that would be. She knows how devoted you are to food.\"    He started violently.    \"I am not devoted to food!\"    \"No, no.\"    \"I am not devoted to food at all.\"    \"Quite. All I meant----\"    \"This rot about me being devoted to food,\" said Tuppy warmly, \"has got to  stop. I am young and healthy and have a good appetite, but that's not the  same as being devoted to food. I admire Anatole as a master of his craft,  and am always willing to consider anything he may put before me, but when  you say I am devoted to food----\"    \"Quite, quite. All I meant was that if she sees you push away your dinner  untasted, she will realize that your heart is aching, and will probably  be the first to suggest blowing the all clear.\"    Tuppy was frowning thoughtfully.    \"Push my dinner away, eh?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Push away a dinner cooked by Anatole?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Push it away untasted?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Let us get this straight. Tonight, at dinner, when the butler offers me  a _ris de veau a la financiere_, or whatever it may be, hot from  Anatole's hands, you wish me to push it away untasted?\"    \"Yes.\"    He chewed his lip. One could sense the struggle going on within. And then  suddenly a sort of glow came into his face. The old martyrs probably used  to look like that.    \"All right.\"    \"You'll do it?\"    \"I will.\"    \"Fine.\"    \"Of course, it will be agony.\"    I pointed out the silver lining.    \"Only for the moment. You could slip down tonight, after everyone is in  bed, and raid the larder.\"    He brightened.    \"That's right. I could, couldn't I?\"    \"I expect there would be something cold there.\"    \"There is something cold there,\" said Tuppy, with growing cheerfulness. \"A  steak-and-kidney pie. We had it for lunch today. One of Anatole's ripest.  The thing I admire about that man,\" said Tuppy reverently, \"the thing  that I admire so enormously about Anatole is that, though a Frenchman, he  does not, like so many of these _chefs_, confine himself exclusively to  French dishes, but is always willing and ready to weigh in with some good  old simple English fare such as this steak-and-kidney pie to which I have  alluded. A masterly pie, Bertie, and it wasn't more than half finished.  It will do me nicely.\"    \"And at dinner you will push, as arranged?\"    \"Absolutely as arranged.\"    \"Fine.\"    \"It's an excellent idea. One of Jeeves's best. You can tell him from me,  when you see him, that I'm much obliged.\"    The cigarette fell from my fingers. It was as though somebody had slapped  Bertram Wooster across the face with a wet dish-rag.    \"You aren't suggesting that you think this scheme I have been sketching  out is Jeeves's?\"    \"Of course it is. It's no good trying to kid me, Bertie. You wouldn't  have thought of a wheeze like that in a million years.\"    There was a pause. I drew myself up to my full height; then, seeing that  he wasn't looking at me, lowered myself again.    \"Come, Glossop,\" I said coldly, \"we had better be going. It is time we  were dressing for dinner.\"        -9-      Tuppy's fatheaded words were still rankling in my bosom as I went up to  my room. They continued rankling as I shed the form-fitting, and had not  ceased to rankle when, clad in the old dressing-gown, I made my way along  the corridor to the _salle de bain_.    It is not too much to say that I was piqued to the tonsils.    I mean to say, one does not court praise. The adulation of the multitude  means very little to one. But, all the same, when one has taken the  trouble to whack out a highly juicy scheme to benefit an in-the-soup  friend in his hour of travail, it's pretty foul to find him giving the  credit to one's personal attendant, particularly if that personal  attendant is a man who goes about the place not packing mess-jackets.    But after I had been splashing about in the porcelain for a bit,  composure began to return. I have always found that in moments of  heart-bowed-downness there is nothing that calms the bruised spirit like  a good go at the soap and water. I don't say I actually sang in the tub,  but there were times when it was a mere spin of the coin whether I would  do so or not.    The spiritual anguish induced by that tactless speech had become  noticeably lessened.    The discovery of a toy duck in the soap dish, presumably the property of  some former juvenile visitor, contributed not a little to this new and  happier frame of mind. What with one thing and another, I hadn't played  with toy ducks in my bath for years, and I found the novel experience  "]]]
