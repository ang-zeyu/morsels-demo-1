There is not one of them who won his title in his sixteenth  winter. My son, it is a great thing for some brave of sixteen winters to  do.\"    Not a word had I to give in answer. I knew well the fame of my warrior  father. He had earned the right of speaking such words, though even he  himself was a brave only at my age. Refusing to smoke my grandmother's  pipe because my heart was too much stirred by their words, and sorely  troubled with a fear lest I should disappoint them, I arose to go.  Drawing my blanket over my shoulders, I said, as I stepped toward the  entranceway: \"I go to hobble my pony. It is now late in the night.\"          II.      Nine winters' snows had buried deep that night when my old grandmother,  together with my father and mother, designed my future with the glow of  a camp fire upon it.    Yet I did not grow up the warrior, huntsman, and husband I was to have  been. At the mission school I learned it was wrong to kill. Nine winters  I hunted for the soft heart of Christ, and prayed for the huntsmen who  chased the buffalo on the plains.    In the autumn of the tenth year I was sent back to my tribe to preach  Christianity to them. With the white man's Bible in my hand, and the  white man's tender heart in my breast, I returned to my own people.    Wearing a foreigner's dress, I walked, a stranger, into my father's  village.    Asking my way, for I had not forgotten my native tongue, an old man led  me toward the tepee where my father lay. From my old companion I learned  that my father had been sick many moons. As we drew near the tepee, I  heard the chanting of a medicine-man within it. At once I wished to  enter in and drive from my home the sorcerer of the plains, but the old  warrior checked me. \"Ho, wait outside until the medicine-man leaves your  father,\" he said. While talking he scanned me from head to feet. Then he  retraced his steps toward the heart of the camping-ground.    My father's dwelling was on the outer limits of the round-faced village.  With every heartthrob I grew more impatient to enter the wigwam.    While I turned the leaves of my Bible with nervous fingers, the  medicine-man came forth from the dwelling and walked hurriedly away. His  head and face were closely covered with the loose robe which draped his  entire figure.    He was tall and large. His long strides I have never forgot. They seemed  to me then the uncanny gait of eternal death. Quickly pocketing my  Bible, I went into the tepee.    Upon a mat lay my father, with furrowed face and gray hair. His eyes and  cheeks were sunken far into his head. His sallow skin lay thin upon his  pinched nose and high cheekbones. Stooping over him, I took his fevered  hand. \"How, Ate?\" I greeted him. A light flashed from his listless eyes  and his dried lips parted. \"My son!\" he murmured, in a feeble voice.  Then again the wave of joy and recognition receded. He closed his eyes,  and his hand dropped from my open palm to the ground.    Looking about, I saw an old woman sitting with bowed head. Shaking hands  with her, I recognized my mother. I sat down between my father and  mother as I used to do, but I did not feel at home. The place where my  old grandmother used to sit was now unoccupied. With my mother I bowed  my head. Alike our throats were choked and tears were streaming from our  eyes; but far apart in spirit our ideas and faiths separated us. My  grief was for the soul unsaved; and I thought my mother wept to see a  brave man's body broken by sickness.    Useless was my attempt to change the faith in the medicine-man to that  abstract power named God. Then one day I became righteously mad with  anger that the medicine-man should thus ensnare my father's soul. And  when he came to chant his sacred songs I pointed toward the door and  bade him go! The man's eyes glared upon me for an instant. Slowly  gathering his robe about him, he turned his back upon the sick man and  stepped out of our wigwam. \"Ha, ha, ha! my son, I can not live without  the medicine-man!\" I heard my father cry when the sacred man was gone.          III.      On a bright day, when the winged seeds of the prairie-grass were flying  hither and thither, I walked solemnly toward the centre of the  camping-ground. My heart beat hard and irregularly at my side. Tighter I  grasped the sacred book I carried under my arm. Now was the beginning of  life's work.    Though I knew it would be hard, I did not once feel that failure was to  be my reward. As I stepped unevenly on the rolling ground, I thought of  the warriors soon to wash off their war-paints and follow me.    At length I reached the place where the people had assembled to hear me  preach. In a large circle men and women sat upon the dry red grass.  Within the ring I stood, with the white man's Bible in my hand. I tried  to tell them of the soft heart of Christ.    In silence the vast circle of bareheaded warriors sat under an afternoon  sun. At last, wiping the wet from my brow, I took my place in the ring.  The hush of the assembly filled me with great hope.    I was turning my thoughts upward to the sky in gratitude, when a stir  called me to earth again.    A tall, strong man arose. His loose robe hung in folds over his right  shoulder. A pair of snapping black eyes fastened themselves like the  poisonous fangs of a serpent upon me. He was the medicine-man. A tremor  played about my heart and a chill cooled the fire in my veins.    Scornfully he pointed a long forefinger in my direction and asked:    \"What loyal son is he who, returning to his father's people, wears a  foreigner's dress?\" He paused a moment, and then continued: \"The dress  of that foreigner of whom a story says he bound a native of our land,  and heaping dry sticks around him, kindled a fire at his feet!\" Waving  his hand toward me, he exclaimed, \"Here is the traitor to his people!\"    I was helpless. Before the eyes of the crowd the cunning magician turned  my honest heart into a vile nest of treachery. Alas! the people frowned  as they looked upon me.    \"Listen!\" he went on. \"Which one of you who have eyed the young man can  see through his bosom and warn the people of the nest of young snakes  hatching there? Whose ear was so acute that he caught the hissing of  snakes whenever the young man opened his mouth? This one has not only  proven false to you, but even to the Great Spirit who made him. He is a  fool! Why do you sit here giving ear to a foolish man who could not  defend his people because he fears to kill, who could not bring venison  to renew the life of his sick father? With his prayers, let him drive  away the enemy! With his soft heart, let him keep off starvation! We  shall go elsewhere to dwell upon an untainted ground.\"    With this he disbanded the people. When the sun lowered in the west and  the winds were quiet, the village of cone-shaped tepees was gone. The  medicine-man had won the hearts of the people.    Only my father's dwelling was left to mark the fighting-ground.          IV.      From a long night at my father's bedside I came out to look upon the  morning. The yellow sun hung equally between the snow-covered land and  the cloudless blue sky. The light of the new day was cold. The strong  breath of winter crusted the snow and fitted crystal shells over the  rivers and lakes. As I stood in front of the tepee, thinking of the vast  prairies which separated us from our tribe, and wondering if the high  sky likewise separated the soft-hearted Son of God from us, the icy  blast from the North blew through my hair and skull. My neglected hair  had grown long and fell upon my neck.    My father had not risen from his bed since the day the medicine-man led  the people away. Though I read from the Bible and prayed beside him upon  my knees, my father would not listen. Yet I believed my prayers were not  unheeded in heaven.    \"Ha, ha, ha! my son,\" my father groaned upon the first snowfall. \"My  son, our food is gone. There is no one to bring me meat! My son, your  soft heart has unfitted you for everything!\" Then covering his face  with the buffalo-robe, he said no more. Now while I stood out in that  cold winter morning, I was starving. For two days I had not seen any  food. But my own cold and hunger did not harass my soul as did the  whining cry of the sick old man.    Stepping again into the tepee, I untied my snow-shoes, which were  fastened to the tent-poles.    My poor mother, watching by the sick one, and faithfully heaping wood  upon the centre fire, spoke to me:    \"My son, do not fail again to bring your father meat, or he will starve  to death.\"    \"How, Ina,\" I answered, sorrowfully. From the tepee I started forth  again to hunt food for my aged parents. All day I tracked the white  level lands in vain. Nowhere, nowhere were there any other footprints  but my own! In the evening of this third fast-day I came back without  meat. Only a bundle of sticks for the fire I brought on my back.  Dropping the wood outside, I lifted the door-flap and set one foot  within the tepee.    There I grew dizzy and numb. My eyes swam in tears. Before me lay my  old gray-haired father sobbing like a child. In his horny hands he  clutched the buffalo-robe, and with his teeth he was gnawing off the  edges. Chewing the dry stiff hair and buffalo-skin, my father's eyes  sought my hands. Upon seeing them empty, he cried out:    \"My son, your soft heart will let me starve before you bring me meat!  Two hills eastward stand a herd of cattle. Yet you will see me die  before you bring me food!\"    Leaving my mother lying with covered head upon her mat, I rushed out  into the night.    With a strange warmth in my heart and swiftness in my feet, I climbed  over the first hill, and soon the second one. The moonlight upon the  white country"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10380"],[0,"Bible Stories and Religious Classics (#11)"],[1,"from thence he  went in to Shalem, the town of Shechem which is in the land of Canaan,  and bought there a part of a field, in which he fixed his tabernacles,  of the sons of Hamor father of Shechem for an hundred lambs. And there  he raised an altar, and worshipped upon it the strongest God of Israel.    After this our Lord appeared to Jacob and said: Arise and go up to  Bethel and dwell there, and make there an altar to the Lord that  appeared to thee in the way when thou fleddest from thy brother Esau.  Jacob then called all them of his house and said: Cast away from you all  your strange gods that be among you, and make you clean and change your  clothes; arise and let us go into Bethel, and make we there an altar to  our Lord that heard me in the day of my tribulation, and was fellow of  my journey. Then they gave to him all their strange gods, and the gold  that hung on their ears, and he dalf a pit behind the city of Shechem  and threw them therein. And when they departed, all the countries  thereabout were afraid and durst not pursue them. Then Jacob came to a  place called Luz which is in the land of Canaan, and all the people with  him, which otherwise is called Bethel. He edified there an altar to our  Lord, and named that place the House of God. Our Lord appeared to him in  that place when he fled from his brother Esau. That same time died  Deborah, the nurse of Rebekah, and was buried at the root of Bethel  under an oak. Our Lord appeared again to Jacob after that he was  returned from Mesopotamia of Syria, and was come into Bethel, and  blessed him saying: Thou shalt no more be called Jacob but Israel shall  be thy name, and called him Israel, and said to him: I am God Almighty,  grow and multiply, folks and peoples of nations shall come of thee,  kings shall come of thy loins. The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac  I shall give to thee and thy seed; and vanished from him.    He then raised a stone for a remembrance in the place where God spake to  him, and anointed it with oil, calling the name of the place Bethel. He  went thence and came in veer time unto the land that goeth to Ephrath,  in which place Rachel bare a son. And the death drawing near, she named  him Benoni, which is as much to say as the son of my sorrow. The father  called him Benjamin, that is to say the son of the right hand. There  Rachel died and was buried in the way toward Ephrath, that is Bethlehem.  Jacob raised a title upon her tomb; this is the title of the monument of  Rachel unto this present day. Jacob went thence and came to Isaac his  father into Mamre the city of Arbah, that is Hebron, in which dwelled  Abraham and Isaac. And all the days of Isaac were complete, which were  an hundred and fourscore years, and he consumed and died in good mind,  and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.    Thus endeth the history of Isaac and his two sons Esau and Jacob.          HERE BEGINNETH THE HISTORY OF JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN    _Which is read the Third Sunday in Lent_      Joseph when he was sixteen years old began to keep and feed the flock  with his brethren, he being yet a child, and was accompanied with the  sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, wives of his father. Joseph complained on his  brethren, and accused them to their father of the most evil sin. Israel  loved Joseph above all his sons for as much as he had gotten him in his  old age, and made for him a motley coat. His brethren then seeing that  he was beloved of his father more than they were, hated him and might  not speak to him a peaceable word. It happed on a time that Joseph  dreamed, and saw a sweven [dream], and told it to his brethren, which  caused them to hate him yet more. Joseph said to his brethren: Hear ye  my dream that I had; methought that we bound sheaves in the field, and  my sheaf stood up and yours standing round about and worshipped my  sheaf. His brethren answered: Shalt thou be our king and shall we be  subject and obey thy commandment? Therefore this cause of dreams and of  these words ministered the more fume of hate and envy. Joseph saw  another sweven and told to his father and brethren: Methought I saw in  my sleep the sun, the moon, and eleven stars worship me. Which when his  father and his brethren had heard, the father blamed him, and said: What  may betoken this dream that thou sawest? Trowest thou that I, thy mother  and thy brethren, shall worship thee upon the earth? His brethren had  great envy hereat.    The father thought and considered a thing secretly in himself. On a time  when his brethren kept their flocks of sheep in Shechem, Israel said to  Joseph: Thy brethren feed their sheep in Shechem, come and I shall send  thee to them, which answered: I am ready, and he said: Go and see if all  things be well and prosperous at thy brethren and beasts, and come again  and tell me what they do. He went from the vale of Hebron and came unto  Shechem. There a man found him erring in the field, and asked him what  he sought, and he answered: I seek my brethren, tell me where they feed  their flocks. The man said to him: They been departed from this place, I  heard them say Let us go in to Dothan. Which then when his brethren saw  him come from far, tofore he approached to them they thought to slay  him, and spake together saying: Lo! see the dreamer cometh. Come and let  us slay him and put him into this old cistern. And we shall say that  some wild evil beast hath devoured him, and then shall appear what his  dreams shall profit him. Reuben hearing this, thought for to deliver him  from their hands, and said: Let us not slay him ne shed his blood, but  keep your hands undefouled. This he said, willing to keep him from their  hands and render him again to his father. Anon then as he came they  took off his motley coat, and set him into an old cistern that had no  water. As they sat for to eat bread they saw Ishmaelites coming from  Gilead, and their camels bringing spices and raisins into Egypt. Then  said Judah to his brethren: What should it profit us if we slew our  brother and shed his blood? It is better that he be sold to Ishmaelites  and our hands be not defouled, he is our own brother and our flesh. His  brethren agreed to his words, and drew him out of the cistern, and sold  him to the Midianitish merchants passing forth by to Ishmaelites for  thirty pieces of silver, which led him into Egypt. At this time when he  was sold Reuben was not there, but was in another field with his beasts.  And when he returned and came unto the cistern and found not Joseph, he  tare his clothes for sorrow, and came to his brethren and said: The  child is not yonder, whither shall I go to seek him? He had supposed his  brethren had slain him in his absence. They told him what they had done,  and took his coat, and besprinkled it with the blood of a kid which they  slew, and sent it to their father saying: See whether this be the coat  of thy son or not, this we have found. Which anon as the father saw it  said: This is my son's coat, an evil wild beast hath devoured him, some  beast hath eaten him; and rent his clothes and did on him a sackcloth,  bewailing and sorrowing his son a long time. All his sons gathered them,  together for to comfort their father and assuage his sorrow, but he  would take no comfort, but said: I shall descend to my son into hell for  to bewail him there. And thus, he abiding in sorrow, the Midianites  carried Joseph into Egypt, and sold him to Potiphar, eunuch of Pharaoh,  master of his knights.    Thus was Joseph led into Egypt, and Potiphar, prince of the host of  Pharaoh, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of Ishmaelites. Our Lord  God was always with Joseph, and he was wise, ready, and prosperous in  all manner of things. He dwelled in his lord's house and pleased so well  his lord, that he stood in his grace that he made him upperest and above  all other, and betook him the rule and governance of all his house,  which well and wisely governed the household and all that he had charge  of. Our Lord blessed the house of Egypt for Joseph's sake, and  multiplied as well in beasts as in fields all his substance. Joseph was  fair of visage and well favored.    After many days the lady, his master's wife, beheld and cast her eyes on  Joseph, and tempted him to sin. He refused that, and would not attend ne  listen to her words, ne would not consent to so sinful a work, and said  to her: Lo! hath not my lord delivered to me all that he hath in his  house? and he knoweth not what he hath, and there is nothing therein but  that it is in my power and at my commandment except thee, which art his  wife. How may I do this evil and sin to my lord? Such manner, or  semblable words, he said daily to her, and the woman was the more  desirous and grievous to the young man, and he always forsook and  refused the sin. And when the lady saw that she was refused, she cried  and called the men of the house and accused Joseph falsely. When the  lord heard this, anon he gave faith and believed his wife, and being  sore wroth, set Joseph in prison where the prisoners of the king were  kept and he was there fast set in. Our Lord God was with Joseph, and had  mercy on him, and made him in the favor and grace of the chief keeper of  the prison, in so much that he delivered to Joseph the keeping of all  the prisoners, and what he did was done, and the chief jailer was  pleased with all. Our Lord was with him and directed all his works.    After this it fell so that two officers of the king's trespassed unto  their lord, wherefore he was wroth with them and commanded them to the  prison whereas Joseph was. That one of them was the butler, and that  other the baker; and the keeper betook them to Joseph to keep, and he  served them. After a while that they had been in prison they both saw on  one night a dream of which they were astoned and abashed, and when  Joseph was come in to serve them, and saw them heavy, he demanded them  why they were"]]]
