The teeth that had  already left their mark on Inspector Verot's piece of chocolate! What a  coincidence! It can hardly be fortuitous. Must we not take it as certain  that the same person bit into this apple and into that cake of chocolate  which Inspector Verot brought to the police office as an incontestable  piece of evidence?\"    He hesitated a second. Should he keep this evidence for himself, for the  personal inquiry which he meant to conduct? Or should he surrender it to  the investigations of the police? But the touch of the object filled him  with such repugnance, with such a sense of physical discomfort, that he  flung away the apple and sent it rolling under the leaves of the shrubs.    And he repeated to himself:    \"The teeth of the tiger! The teeth of the wild beast!\"    He locked the garden door behind him, bolted it, put back the keys on the  table and said to Mazeroux:    \"Have you spoken to the Chief of Police?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Is he coming?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Didn't he order you to telephone for the commissary of police?\"    \"No.\"    \"That means that he wants to see everything by himself. So much the  better. But the detective office? The public prosecutor?\"    \"He's told them.\"    \"What's the matter with you, Alexandre? I have to drag your answers out  of you. Well, what is it? You're looking at me very queerly. What's up?\"    \"Nothing.\"    \"That's all right. I expect this business has turned your head. And no  wonder.... The Prefect won't enjoy himself, either, ... especially as he  put his faith in me a bit light-heartedly and will be called upon to give  an explanation of my presence here. By the way, it's much better that you  should take upon yourself the responsibility for all that we have done.  Don't you agree? Besides, it'll do you all the good in the world.    \"Put yourself forward, flatly; suppress me as much as you can; and, above  all--I don't suppose that you will have any objection to this little  detail--don't be such a fool as to say that you went to sleep for a  single second, last night, in the passage. First of all, you'd only be  blamed for it. And then ... well, that's understood, eh? So we have only  to say good-bye.    \"If the Prefect wants me, as I expect he will, telephone to my address,  Place du Palais-Bourbon. I shall be there. Good-bye. It is not necessary  for me to assist at the inquiry; my presence would be out of place.  Good-bye, old chap.\"    He turned toward the door of the passage.    \"Half a moment!\" cried Mazeroux.    \"Half a moment?... What do you mean?\"    The detective sergeant had flung himself between him and the door and was  blocking his way.    \"Yes, half a moment ... I am not of your opinion. It's far better that  you should wait until the Prefect comes.\"    \"But I don't care a hang about your opinion!\"    \"May be; but you shan't pass.\"    \"What! Why, Alexandre, you must be ill!\"    \"Look here, Chief,\" said Mazeroux feebly. \"What can it matter to you?  It's only natural that the Prefect should wish to speak to you.\"    \"Ah, it's the Prefect who wishes, is it?... Well, my lad, you can tell  him that I am not at his orders, that I am at nobody's orders, and that,  if the President of the Republic, if Napoleon I himself were to bar my  way ... Besides, rats! Enough said. Get out of the road!\"    \"You shall not pass!\" declared Mazeroux, in a resolute tone,  extending his arms.    \"Well, I like that!\"    \"You shall not pass.\"    \"Alexandre, just count ten.\"    \"A hundred, if you like, but you shall not....\"    \"Oh, blow your catchwords! Get out of this.\"    He seized Mazeroux by both shoulders, made him spin round on his  heels and, with a push, sent him floundering over the sofa. Then he  opened the door.    \"Halt, or I fire!\"    It was Mazeroux, who had scrambled to his feet and now stood with his  revolver in his hand and a determined expression on his face.    Don Luis stopped in amazement. The threat was absolutely indifferent to  him, and the barrel of that revolver aimed at him left him as cold as  could be. But by what prodigy did Mazeroux, his former accomplice, his  ardent disciple, his devoted servant, by what prodigy did Mazeroux dare  to act as he was doing?    Perenna went up to him and pressed gently on the detective's  outstretched arm.    \"Prefect's orders?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" muttered the sergeant, uncomfortably.    \"Orders to keep me here until he comes?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And if I betrayed an intention of leaving, to prevent me?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"By every means?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Even by putting a bullet through my skin?\"    \"Yes.\"    Perenna reflected; and then, in a serious voice:    \"Would you have fired, Mazeroux?\"    The sergeant lowered his head and said faintly:    \"Yes, Chief.\"    Perenna looked at him without anger, with a glance of affectionate  sympathy; and it was an absorbing sight for him to see his former  companion dominated by such a sense of discipline and duty. Nothing was  able to prevail against that sense, not even the fierce admiration, the  almost animal attachment which Mazeroux retained for his master.    \"I'm not angry, Mazeroux. In fact, I approve. Only you must tell me the  reason why the Prefect of Police--\"    The detective did not reply, but his eyes wore an expression of such  sadness that Don Luis started, suddenly understanding.    \"No,\" he cried, \"no!... It's absurd ... he can't have thought  that!... And you, Mazeroux, do you believe me guilty?\"    \"Oh, I, Chief, am as sure of you as I am of myself!... You don't take  life!... But, all the same, there are things ... coincidences--\"    \"Things ... coincidences ...\" repeated Don Luis slowly.    He remained pensive; and, in a low voice, he said:    \"Yes, after all, there's truth in what you say.... Yes, it all fits  in.... Why didn't I think of it?... My relations with Cosmo Mornington,  my arrival in Paris in time for the reading of the will, my insisting on  spending the night here, the fact that the death of the two Fauvilles  undoubtedly gives me the millions.... And then ... and then ... why, he's  absolutely right, your Prefect of Police!... All the more so as.... Well,  there, I'm a goner!\"    \"Come, come, Chief!\"    \"A dead-goner, old chap; you just get that into your head. Not as Arsene  Lupin, ex-burglar, ex-convict, ex-anything you please--I'm unattackable  on that ground--but as Don Luis Perenna, respectable man, residuary  legatee, and the rest of it. And it's too stupid! For, after all, who  will find the murderers of Cosmo, Verot, and the two Fauvilles, if they  go clapping me into jail?\"    \"Come, come, Chief--\"    \"Shut up! ... Listen!\"    A motor car was stopping on the boulevard, followed by another. It  was evidently the Prefect and the magistrates from the public  prosecutor's office.    Don Luis took Mazeroux by the arm.    \"There's only one way out of it, Alexandre! Don't say you went to sleep.\"    \"I must, Chief.\"    \"You silly ass!\" growled Don Luis. \"How is it possible to be such an ass!  It's enough to disgust one with honesty. What am I to do, then?\"    \"Discover the culprit, Chief.\"    \"What! ... What are you talking about?\"    Mazeroux, in his turn, took him by the arm and, clutching him with a sort  of despair, said, in a voice choked with tears:    \"Discover the culprit, Chief. If not, you're done for ... that's  certain ... the Prefect told me so. ... The police want a  culprit ... they want him this evening.... One has got to be  found.... It's up to you to find him.\"    \"What you have, Alexandre, is a merry wit.\"    \"It's child's play for you, Chief. You have only to set your mind to it.\"    \"But there's not the least clue, you ass!\"    \"You'll find one ... you must ... I entreat you, hand them over  somebody.... It would be more than I could bear if you were arrested.  You, the chief, accused of murder! No, no.... I entreat you, discover the  criminal and hand him over.... You have the whole day to do it in...and  Lupin has done greater things than that!\"    He was stammering, weeping, wringing his hands, grimacing with every  feature of his comic face. And it was really touching, this grief, this  dismay at the approach of the danger that threatened his master.    M. Desmalions's voice was heard in the hall, through the curtain that  closed the passage. A third motor car stopped on the boulevard, and a  fourth, both doubtless laden with policemen.    The house was surrounded, besieged.    Perenna was silent.    Beside him, anxious-faced, Mazeroux seemed to be imploring him.    A few seconds elapsed.    Then Perenna declared, deliberately:    \"Looking at things all round, Alexandre, I admit that you have seen the  position clearly and that your fears are fully justified. If I do not  manage to hand over the murderer or murderers of Hippolyte Fauville and  his son to the police in a few hours from now, it is I, Don Luis Perenna,  who will be lodged in durance vile on the evening of this Thursday, the  first of April.\"          CHAPTER FOUR    THE CLOUDED TURQUOISE      It was about nine o'clock in the morning when the Prefect of Police  entered the study in which the incomprehensible tragedy of that double  murder had been enacted.    He did not even bow to Don Luis; and the magistrates who accompanied him  might have thought that Don Luis was merely an assistant of Sergeant  Mazeroux, if the chief detective had not made it his business to tell  them, in a few words, the part played by the stranger.    M. Desmalions briefly examined the two corpses and received a rapid  explanation from Mazeroux. Then, returning to the hall, he went up to a  drawing-room on the first floor, where Mme. Fauville, who had been  informed of his visit, joined him almost at once.    Perenna, who had not stirred from the passage, slipped into the hall  himself.

I, the undersigned, am glad to bear testimony to young Carl Czerny having  made the most extraordinary progress on the pianoforte, far beyond what  might be expected at the age of fourteen. I consider him deserving of all  possible assistance, not only from what I have already referred to, but  from his astonishing memory, and more especially from his parents having  spent all their means in cultivating the talent of their promising son.

Milder, and say to  her previously from me, that I hope she will not sing anywhere else. I  intend to call on her to-morrow, to kiss the hem of her garment. Do not  also forget Marconi, and forgive me for giving you so much trouble.    Yours wholly,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Roeckel, in 1806 tenor at the Theatre \"an der Wien,\" sang the  part of Florestan in the spring of that year, when _Fidelio_ was revived.  Mdlle. Milder, afterwards Mdme.

MY ESTEEMED COLLIN,--    I hear that you are about to fulfil my greatest wish and your own purpose.  Much as I desire to express my delight to you in person, I cannot find time  to do so, having so much to occupy me. Pray do not then ascribe this to any  want of proper attention towards you. I send you the \"Armida\"; as soon as  you have entirely done with it, pray return it, as it does not belong to  me. I am, with sincere esteem,    Yours,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Collin, Court Secretary, was the author of _Coriolanus_, a  tragedy for which Beethoven in 1807 wrote the celebrated Overture dedicated  to that poet.

Beethoven's first intention was to dedicate Op. 58 to him, which is evident  from a large page in Schindler's work, on which is written in bold  characters, by the master's own hand, \"_Quatrieme Concerto pour le Piano,  avec accompagnement, etc., dedie a son ami Gleichenstein_,\" &c. The name of  the Archduke Rudolph had been previously written, and was eventually  adopted, and Gleichenstein afterwards received the dedication of the Grand  Sonata with violoncello, Op. 69.]      46.    TO THE DIRECTORS OF THE COURT THEATRE.[1]    Vienna, December, 1807.    The undersigned has cause to flatter himself that during the period of his  stay in Vienna he has gained some favor and approbation from the highest  nobility, as well as from the public at large, his works having met with an  honorable reception both in this and other countries. Nevertheless he has  had difficulties of every kind to contend against, and has not hitherto  been so fortunate as to acquire a position that would enable him _to live  solely for art_, and to develop his talents to a still higher degree of  perfection, which ought to be the aim of every artist, thus ensuring future  independence instead of mere casual profits.    The mere wish _to gain a livelihood_ has never been the leading clew that  has hitherto guided the undersigned on his path. His great aim has been the  _interest of art_ and the ennobling of taste, while his genius, soaring to  a higher ideal and greater perfection, frequently compelled him to  sacrifice his talents and profits to the Muse. Still works of this kind won  for him a reputation in distant lands, securing him the most favorable  reception in various places of distinction, and a position befitting his  talents and acquirements.    The undersigned does not, however, hesitate to say that this city is above  all others the most precious and desirable in his eyes, owing to the number  of years he has lived here, the favor and approval he has enjoyed from both  high and low, and his wish fully to realize the expectations he has had the  good fortune to excite, but most of all, he may truly say, from his  _patriotism as a German_. Before, therefore, making up his mind to leave a  place so dear to him, he begs to refer to a hint which the reigning Prince  Lichnowsky was so kind as to give him, to the effect that the directors of  the theatre were disposed to engage the undersigned on reasonable  conditions in the service of their theatre, and to ensure his remaining in  Vienna by securing to him a permanent position, more propitious to the  further exercise of his talents. As this assurance is entirely in  accordance with the wishes of the undersigned, he takes the liberty, with  all due respect, to place before the directors his readiness to enter into  such an engagement, and begs to state the following conditions for their  gracious consideration.    1. The undersigned undertakes and pledges himself to compose each year at  least _one grand opera_, to be selected by the directors and himself; in  return for this he demands a _fixed salary_ of 2400 florins a year, and  also a free benefit at the third performance of each such opera.    2. He also agrees to supply the directors annually with a little _operetta_  or a _divertissement_, with choruses or occasional music of the kind, as  may be required, _gratis_; he feels confident that on the other hand the  directors will not refuse, in return for these various labors, to grant him  _a benefit concert_ at all events once a year in one of the theatres.  Surely the above conditions cannot be thought exorbitant or unreasonable,  when the expenditure of time and energy entailed by the production of an  _opera_ is taken into account, as it entirely excludes the possibility of  all other mental exertion; in other places, too, the author and his family  have a share in the profits of every individual performance, so that even  _one_ successful work at once ensures the future fortunes of the composer.  It must also be considered how prejudicial the present rate of exchange is  to artists here, and likewise the high price of the necessaries of life,  while a residence in foreign countries is open to them.    But in any event, whether the directors accede to or decline this present  proposal, the undersigned ventures to request that he may be permitted to  give a concert for his own benefit in one of the theatres. For if his  conditions be accepted, the undersigned must devote all his time and  talents to the composition of such an opera, and thus be prevented working  in any other way for profit. In case of the non-acceptance of these  proposals, as the concert he was authorized to give last year did not take  place owing to various obstacles, he would entreat, as a parting token of  the favor hitherto vouchsafed to him, that the promise of last year may now  be fulfilled. In the former case, he would beg to suggest _Annunciation  Day_ [March 25.] for his concert, and in the latter a day during the  ensuing Christmas vacation.    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN, M.P.    [_Manu propria._]    [Footnote 1: This application was fruitless. See Reichardt's _Vertraute  Briefe_. \"These two (Lobkowitz and Esterhazy) are the heads of the great  theatrical direction, which consists entirely of princes and counts, who  conduct all the large theatres on their own account and at their own risk.\"  The close of this letter shows that it was written in December.]      47.    TO COUNT FRANZ VON OPPERSDORF.[1]    Vienna, Nov. 1, 1808 [_sic!_].    MY DEAR COUNT,--    I fear you will look on me with displeasure when I tell you that necessity  compelled me not only to dispose of the symphony I wrote for you, but to  transfer another also to some one else. Be assured, however, that you shall  soon receive the one I intend for you. I hope that both you and the  Countess, to whom I beg my kind regards, have been well since we met. I am  at this moment staying with Countess Erdoedy in the apartments below those  of Prince Lichnowsky. I mention this in case you do me the honor to call on  me when you are in Vienna. My circumstances are improving, without having  recourse to the intervention of people _who treat their friends  insultingly_. I have also the offer of being made _Kapellmeister_ to the  King of Westphalia, and it is possible that I may accept the proposal.  Farewell, and sometimes think of your attached friend,    BEETHOVEN.
