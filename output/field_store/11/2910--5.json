If the hunter heard the hoarse cries, or the words hissed into his  ears; if he saw the fiery glances of hatred, and sudden giving way  to ungovernable rage, unusual to the Indian nature; if he felt in  their fierce exultation the hopelessness of succor or mercy, he gave  not the slightest sign.    \"Atelang! Atelang! Atelang!\" rang out the strange Indian name.    The French traders, like real savages, ran along with the  procession, their feathers waving, their paint shining, their faces  expressive of as much excitement as the Indians' as they cried aloud  in their native tongue:    \"Le Vent de la Mort! Le Vent de la Mort! La Vent de la Mort!\"    The hunter, while yet some paces distant, saw the lofty figure of  the chieftain standing in front of his principal men. Well he knew  them all. There were the crafty Pipe, and his savage comrade, the  Half King; there was Shingiss, who wore on his forehead a scar--the  mark of the hunter's bullet; there were Kotoxen, the Lynx, and  Misseppa, the Source, and Winstonah, the War-cloud, chiefs of  sagacity and renown. Three renegades completed the circle; and these  three traitors represented a power which had for ten years left an  awful, bloody trail over the country. Simon Girty, the so-called  White Indian, with his keen, authoritative face turned expectantly;  Elliott, the Tory deserter, from Fort Pitt, a wiry, spider-like  little man; and last, the gaunt and gaudily arrayed form of the  demon of the frontier--Jim Girty.    The procession halted before this group, and two brawny braves  pushed the hunter forward. Simon Girty's face betrayed satisfaction;  Elliott's shifty eyes snapped, and the dark, repulsive face of the  other Girty exhibited an exultant joy. These desperadoes had feared  this hunter.    Wingenund, with a majestic wave of his arm, silenced the yelling  horde of frenzied savages and stepped before the captive.    The deadly foes were once again face to face. The chieftain's lofty  figure and dark, sleek head, now bare of plumes, towered over the  other Indians, but he was not obliged to lower his gaze in order to  look straight into the hunter's eyes.    Verily this hunter merited the respect which shone in the great  chieftain's glance. Like a mountain-ash he stood, straight and  strong, his magnificent frame tapering wedge-like from his broad  shoulders. The bulging line of his thick neck, the deep chest, the  knotty contour of his bared forearm, and the full curves of his  legs--all denoted a wonderful muscular development.    The power expressed in this man's body seemed intensified in his  features. His face was white and cold, his jaw square and set; his  coal-black eyes glittered with almost a superhuman fire. And his  hair, darker than the wing of a crow, fell far below his shoulders;  matted and tangled as it was, still it hung to his waist, and had it  been combed out, must have reached his knees.    One long moment Wingenund stood facing his foe, and then over the  multitude and through the valley rolled his sonorous voice:    \"Deathwind dies at dawn!\"    The hunter was tied to a tree and left in view of the Indian  populace. The children ran fearfully by; the braves gazed long at  the great foe of their race; the warriors passed in gloomy silence.  The savages' tricks of torture, all their diabolical ingenuity of  inflicting pain was suppressed, awaiting the hour of sunrise when  this hated Long Knife was to die.    Only one person offered an insult to the prisoner; he was a man of  his own color. Jim Girty stopped before him, his yellowish eyes  lighted by a tigerish glare, his lips curled in a snarl, and from  between them issuing the odor of the fir traders' vile rum.    \"You'll soon be feed fer the buzzards,\" he croaked, in his hoarse  voice. He had so often strewed the plains with human flesh for the  carrion birds that the thought had a deep fascination for him. \"D'ye  hear, scalp-hunter? Feed for buzzards!\" He deliberately spat in the  hunter's face. \"D'ye hear?\" he repeated.    There was no answer save that which glittered in the hunter's eye.  But the renegade could not read it because he did not meet that  flaming glance. Wild horses could not have dragged him to face this  man had he been free. Even now a chill crept over Girty. For a  moment he was enthralled by a mysterious fear, half paralyzed by a  foreshadowing of what would be this hunter's vengeance. Then he  shook off his craven fear. He was free; the hunter's doom was sure.  His sharp face was again wreathed in a savage leer, and he spat once  more on the prisoner.    His fierce impetuosity took him a step too far. The hunter's arms  and waist were fastened, but his feet were free. His powerful leg  was raised suddenly; his foot struck Girty in the pit of the  stomach. The renegade dropped limp and gasping. The braves carried  him away, his gaudy feathers trailing, his long arms hanging  inertly, and his face distorted with agony.    The maidens of the tribe, however, showed for the prisoner an  interest that had in it something of veiled sympathy. Indian girls  were always fascinated by white men. Many records of Indian maidens'  kindness, of love, of heroism for white prisoners brighten the dark  pages of frontier history. These girls walked past the hunter,  averting their eyes when within his range of vision, but stealing  many a sidelong glance at his impressive face and noble proportions.  One of them, particularly, attracted the hunter's eye.    This was because, as she came by with her companions, while they all  turned away, she looked at him with her soft, dark eyes. She was a  young girl, whose delicate beauty bloomed fresh and sweet as that of  a wild rose. Her costume, fringed, beaded, and exquisitely wrought  with fanciful design, betrayed her rank, she was Wingenund's  daughter. The hunter had seen her when she was a child, and he  recognized her now. He knew that the beauty of Aola, of Whispering  Winds Among the Leaves, had been sung from the Ohio to the Great  Lakes.    Often she passed him that afternoon. At sunset, as the braves untied  him and led him away, he once more caught the full, intense gaze of  her lovely eyes.    That night as he lay securely bound in the corner of a lodge, and  the long hours wore slowly away, he strained at his stout bonds, and  in his mind revolved different plans of escape. It was not in this  man's nature to despair; while he had life he would fight. From time  to time he expanded his muscles, striving to loosen the wet buckskin  thongs.    The dark hours slowly passed, no sound coming to him save the  distant bark of a dog and the monotonous tread of his guard; a dim  grayness pervaded the lodge. Dawn was close at hand--his hour was  nearly come.    Suddenly his hearing, trained to a most acute sensibility, caught a  faint sound, almost inaudible. It came from without on the other  side of the lodge. There it was again, a slight tearing sound, such  as is caused by a knife when it cuts through soft material.    Some one was slitting the wall of the lodge.    The hunter rolled noiselessly over and over until he lay against the  skins. In the dim grayness he saw a bright blade moving carefully  upward through the deer-hide. Then a long knife was pushed into the  opening; a small, brown hand grasped the hilt. Another little hand  followed and felt of the wall and floor, reaching out with groping  fingers.    The, hunter rolled again so that his back was against the wall and  his wrists in front of the opening. He felt the little hand on his  arm; then it slipped down to his wrists. The contact of cold steel  set a tremor of joy through his heart. The pressure of his bonds  relaxed, ceased; his arms were free. He turned to find the  long-bladed knife on the ground. The little hands were gone.    In a tinkling he rose unbound, armed, desperate. In another second  an Indian warrior lay upon the ground in his death-throes, while a  fleeing form vanished in the gray morning mist.        Chapter VII.    Joe felt the heavy lethargy rise from him like the removal of a  blanket; his eyes became clear, and he saw the trees and the forest  gloom; slowly he realized his actual position.    He was a prisoner, lying helpless among his sleeping captors.  Silvertip and the guard had fled into the woods, frightened by the  appalling moan which they believed sounded their death-knell. And  Joe believed he might have fled himself had he been free. What could  have caused that sound? He fought off the numbing chill that once  again began to creep over him. He was wide-awake now; his head was  clear, and he resolved to retain his senses. He told himself there  could be nothing supernatural in that wind, or wail, or whatever it  was, which had risen murmuring from out the forest-depths.    Yet, despite his reasoning, Joe could not allay his fears. That  thrilling cry haunted him. The frantic flight of an Indian  brave--nay, of a cunning, experienced chief--was not to be lightly  considered. The savages were at home in these untracked wilds.  Trained from infancy to scent danger and to fight when they had an  equal chance they surely would not run without good cause.    Joe knew that something moved under those dark trees. He had no idea  what. It might be the fretting night wind, or a stealthy, prowling,  soft-footed beast, or a savage alien to these wild Indians, and  wilder than they by far. The chirp of a bird awoke the stillness.  Night had given way to morning. Welcoming the light that was chasing  away the gloom, Joe raised his head with a deep sigh of relief. As  he did so he saw a bush move; then a shadow seemed to sink into the  ground. He had seen an object lighter than the trees, darker than  the gray background. Again, that strange sense of the nearness of  something thrilled him.    Moments, passed--to him long as hours. He saw a tall fern waver and  tremble.

Bismarck was  never a great nobleman like Stein and he did not dislike receiving a  salary; but he felt that the Civil Servants were the enemies of the  order to which he belonged. He speaks a few years later of \"the biting  acid of Prussian legislation which in a single generation can reduce a  mediatised Prince to an ordinary voter.\" He is never tired of saying  that it was the bureaucracy which was the real introducer of the  Revolution into Prussia. In one of his speeches he defends himself and  his friends against the charge of being enemies to freedom; \"that they  were not,\" he says;      \"Absolutism with us is closely connected with the omnipotence of    the _Geheimrath_ and the conceited omniscience of the Professors    who sit behind the green table, a product, and I venture to    maintain a necessary product, of the Prussian method of    education. This product, the bureaucracy, I have never loved.\"    When, as he often does, he maintains that the Prussian Parliament does  not represent the people, he is thinking of the predominance among them  of officials, for we must always remember that many of the extreme  Liberal party and some of their most active leaders were men who were  actually at that time in the service of the Crown.    It was the introduction of a Representative Assembly that for the first  time in Prussian history made possible a Conservative opposition against  the Liberalism of the Prussian Government. There are two kinds of  Liberalism. In one sense of the word it means freedom of debate, freedom  of the press, the power of the individual as against the Government,  independence of character, and personal freedom. Of Liberalism in this  sense of the word there was indeed little in the Prussian Government.  But Liberalism also meant the overthrow of the old established  institutions inherited from the Middle Ages, especially the destruction  of all privileges held by the nobility; it meant on the Continent  opposition to all form of dogmatic religious teaching; it meant the  complete subjection of the Church to the State; it meant the abolition  of all local distinctions and the introduction of a uniform system of  government chiefly imitated from French institutions. It was in this  sense of the word that, with the exception of the first few years of the  reign of Frederick William IV., the Prussian Government had been  Liberal, and it was this Liberalism which Bismarck and his friends hated  almost as much as they did the Liberalism of the Revolution.    The clearest instance of his attitude on such matters is to be found in  his opposition to the Bill introduced for making civil marriage  compulsory. He opposed it in a speech which was many years later to be  quoted against him when he himself introduced a measure almost identical  with that which he now opposed. Civil marriage, he said, was a foreign  institution, an imitation of French legislation; it would simply serve  to undermine the belief in Christianity among the people, \"and\" he said,  \"I have seen many friends of the illumination during the last year or  two come to recognise that a certain degree of positive Christianity is  necessary for the common man, if he is not to become dangerous to human  society.\" The desire for introducing this custom was merely an instance  of the constant wish to imitate what is foreign.      \"It would be amusing,\" he said, \"if it were not just our own    country which was subjected to these experiments of French    charlatanism. In the course of the discussion it has often been    said by gentlemen standing in this place that Europe holds us for    a people of thinkers. Gentlemen, that was in old days. The    popular representation of the last two years has deprived us of    this reputation. They have shown to a disappointed Europe only    translators of French stucco but no original thinkers. It may be    that when civil marriage also rejoices in its majority, the    people will have their eyes opened to the swindle to which they    have been sacrificed; when one after another the old Christian    fundamental rights have been taken from them: the right to be    governed by Christian magistrates; the right to know that they    have secured to their children a Christian education in schools    which Christian parents are compelled to maintain and to use;    the right of being married in the Christian fashion which his    faith requires from everyone, without being dependent on    constitutional ceremonies. If we go on in this way I hope still    to see the day when the fool's ship of the time will be wrecked    on the rock of the Christian Church; for the belief in the    revealed Word of God still stands firmer among the people than    the belief in the saving power of any article of the    Constitution.\"    In the same way he was able from his place in Parliament to criticise  the proposals of the Government for freeing the peasants from those  payments in kind, and personal service which in some of the provinces  still adhered to their property; he attacked their financial proposals;  he exposed the injustice of the land tax; he defended the manorial  jurisdiction of the country gentlemen. Especially he defended the nobles  of Prussia themselves, a class against whom so many attacks had been  made. He pointed out that by them and by their blood the Prussian State  had been built up; the Prussian nobles were, he maintained, not, as so  often was said, unpopular; a third of the House belonged to them; they  were not necessarily opposed to freedom; they were, at least, the truest  defenders of the State. Let people not confuse patriotism and  Liberalism. Who had done more for the true political independence of the  State, that independence without which all freedom was impossible, than  the Prussian nobles? At the end of the Seven Years' War boys had stood  at the head of the army, the only survivors of their families. The  privileges of the nobles had been taken from them, but they had not  behaved like the democrats; their loyalty to the State had never  wavered; they had not even formed a Fronde. He was not ashamed of the  name of Junker: \"We will bring the name to glory and honour,\" were  almost the last words he spoke in Parliament.    Bismarck soon became completely at home in the House. Notwithstanding  the strength of his opinions and the vigour with which he gave  expression to them, he was not unpopular, even among his opponents. He  was always a gentleman and a man of the world; he did not dislike mixing  with men of all classes and all parties; he had none of that stiffness  and hauteur which many of his friends had acquired from their military  pursuits. His relations with his opponents are illustrated by an  anecdote of which there are many versions. He found himself one day  while in the refreshment room standing side by side with d'Ester, one of  the most extreme of the Republican party. They fell into conversation,  and d'Ester suggested that they should make a compact and, whichever  party succeeded in the struggle for power, they should each agree to  spare the other. If the Republicans won, Bismarck should not be  guillotined; if the monarchists, d'Ester should not be hung. \"No,\"  answered Bismarck, \"that is no use; if you come into power, life would  not be worth living. There must be hanging, but courtesy to the foot of  the gallows.\"    If he was in after years to become known as the great adversary of  Parliamentary government, this did not arise from any incapacity to  hold his own in Parliamentary debate. He did not indeed aim at oratory;  then, as in later years, he always spoke with great contempt of men who  depended for power on their rhetorical ability. He was himself deficient  in the physical gifts of a great speaker; powerful as was his frame, his  voice was thin and weak. He had nothing of the actor in him; he could  not command the deep voice, the solemn tones, the imposing gestures, the  Olympian mien by which men like Waldeck and Radowitz and Gagern  dominated and controlled their audience. His own mind was essentially  critical; he appealed more to the intellect than the emotions. His  speeches were always controversial, but he was an admirable debater. It  is curious to see how quickly he adopts the natural Parliamentary tone.  His speeches are all subdued in tone and conversational in manner. Many  of them were very carefully prepared, for though he did not generally  write them out, he said them over and over again to himself or to  Kleist, with whom he lived in Berlin. They are entirely unlike any other  speeches--he has, in fact, in them, as in his letters, added a new  chapter to the literature of his country, hitherto so poor in prose.    They shew a vivid imagination and an almost unequalled power of  illustration. The thought is always concrete, and he is never satisfied  with the vague ideas and abstract conceptions which so easily moved his  contemporaries. No speeches, either in English or in German, preserve so  much of their freshness. He is almost the only Parliamentary orator  whose speeches have become to some extent a popular book; no other  orator has enriched the language as he has done with new phrases and  images. The great characteristic of his speeches, as of his letters, is  the complete absence of affectation and the very remarkable intellectual  honesty. They are often deficient in order and arrangement; he did not  excel in the logical exposition of a connected argument, but he never  was satisfied till he had presented the idea which influenced him in  words so forcible and original that it was impressed on the minds of his  audience, and he was often able to find expressions which will not be  forgotten so long as the German language is spoken.    We can easily imagine that under other circumstances, or in another  country, he"]]]
