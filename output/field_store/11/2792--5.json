Besides  these memories of an older generation, most of the officers had  themselves taken part, when younger in years and rank, in deeds  not a whit less glorious. Almost every man had had a share in some  gallant feat, to which he, in part at least, owed his present  position. The captain had perhaps been a midshipman under Truxtun  when he took the _Vengeance_, and had been sent aboard the captured  French frigate with the prize-master; the lieutenant had borne a  part in the various attacks on Tripoli, and had led his men in the  desperate hand-to-hand fights in which the Yankee cutlass proved  an overmatch for the Turkish and Moorish scimitars. Nearly every  senior officer had extricated himself by his own prowess or skill  from the dangers of battle or storm; he owed his rank to the fact  that he had proved worthy of it. Thrown upon his own resources, he  had learned self-reliance; he was a first-rate practical seaman,  and prided himself on the way his vessel was handled. Having reached  his rank by hard work, and knowing what real fighting meant, he was  careful to see that his men were trained in the _essentials_ of  discipline, and that they knew how to handle the guns in battle as  well as polish them in peace. Beyond almost any of his countrymen,  he worshipped the \"Gridiron Flag,\" and, having been brought up in  the Navy, regarded its honor as his own. It was, perhaps, the Navy  alone that thought itself a match, ship against ship, for Great  Britain. The remainder of the nation pinned its faith to the army,  or rather to that weakest of weak reeds, the militia. The officers  of the navy, with their strong _esprit de corps,_ their jealousy  of their own name and record, and the knowledge, by actual experience,  that the British ships sailed no faster and were no better handled  than their own, had no desire to shirk a conflict with any foe, and  having tried their bravery in actual service, they made it doubly  formidable by cool, wary skill. Even the younger men, who had never  been in action, had been so well trained by the tried veterans over  them that the lack of experience was not sensibly felt.    The sailors comprising the crews of our ships were well worthy of  their leaders. There was no better seaman in the world than American  Jack; he had been bred to his work from infancy, and had been off  in a fishing dory almost as soon as he could walk. When he grew  older, he shipped on a merchant-man or whaler, and in those warlike  times, when our large merchant-marine was compelled to rely pretty  much on itself for protection, each craft _had_ to be well handled;  all who were not were soon weeded out by a process of natural  selection, of which the agents were French picaroons, Spanish  buccaneers, and Malay pirates. It was a rough school, but it  taught Jack to be both skilful and self-reliant; and he was all the  better fitted to become a man-of-war's man, because he knew more  about fire-arms than most of his kind in foreign lands. At home he  had used his ponderous ducking gun with good effect on the flocks  of canvasbacks in the reedy flats of the Chesapeake, or among the  sea-coots in the rough water off the New England cliffs; and when  he went on a sailing voyage the chances were even that there would  be some use for the long guns before he returned, for the American  merchant sailor could trust to no armed escort.    The wonderful effectiveness of our seamen at the date of which I  am writing as well as long subsequently to it was largely due to  the curious condition of things in Europe. For thirty years all  the European nations had been in a state of continuous and very  complicated warfare, during the course of which each nation in turn  fought almost every other, England being usually at loggerheads  with all. One effect of this was to force an enormous proportion  of the carrying trade of the world into American bottoms. The old  Massachusetts town of Salem was then one of the main depots of  the East India trade; the Baltimore clippers carried goods into the  French and German ports with small regard to the blockade; New  Bedford and Sag Harbor fitted out whalers for the Arctic seas as  well as for the South Pacific; the rich merchants of Philadelphia  and New York sent their ships to all parts of the world; and every  small port had some craft in the coasting trade. On the New England  seaboard but few of the boys would reach manhood without having  made at least one voyage to the Newfoundland Banks after codfish;  and in the whaling towns of Long Island it used to be an old saying  that no man could marry till he struck his whale. The wealthy merchants  of the large cities would often send their sons on a voyage or two  before they let them enter their counting-houses. Thus it came about  that a large portion of our population was engaged in seafaring  pursuits of a nature strongly tending to develop a resolute and  hardy character in the men that followed them. The British  merchant-men sailed in huge convoys, guarded by men-of-war, while,  as said before, our vessels went alone, and relied for protection  on themselves. If a fishing smack went to the Banks it knew that it  ran a chance of falling in with some not over-scrupulous Nova  Scotian privateer. The barques that sailed from Salem to the Spice  Islands kept their men well trained both at great guns and musketry,  so as to be able to beat off either Malay proas, or Chinese junks.  The New York ships, loaded for the West Indies, were prepared to  do battle with the picaroons that swarmed in the Spanish main;  while the fast craft from Baltimore could fight as well as they  could run. Wherever an American seaman went, he not only had to  contend with all the legitimate perils of the sea, but he had also  to regard almost every stranger as a foe. Whether this foe called  himself pirate or privateer mattered but little. French, Spaniards,  Algerines, Malays, from all alike our commerce suffered, and against  all, our merchants were forced to defend themselves. The effect of  such a state of things, which made commerce so remunerative that  the bolder spirits could hardly keep out of it, and so hazardous  that only the most skilful and daring could succeed in it, was to  raise up as fine a set of seamen as ever manned a navy. The stern  school in which the American was brought up, forced him into habits  of independent thought and action which it was impossible that the  more protected Briton could possess. He worked more intelligently  and less from routine, and while perfectly obedient and amenable  to discipline, was yet able to judge for himself in an emergency.  He was more easily managed than most of his kind--being shrewd,  quiet, and, in fact, comparatively speaking, rather moral than  otherwise; if he was a New Englander, when he retired from a sea  life he was not unapt to end his days as a deacon. Altogether there  could not have been better material for a fighting crew than cool,  gritty American Jack. Moreover, there was a good nucleus of veterans  to begin with, who were well fitted to fill the more responsible  positions, such as captains of guns, etc. These were men who had  cruised in the little _Enterprise_ after French privateers, who had  been in the _Constellation_ in her two victorious fights, or who,  perhaps, had followed Decatur when with only eighty men he cut out  the _Philadelphia_, manned by fivefold his force and surrounded by  hostile batteries and war vessels,--one of the boldest expeditions  of the kind on record.    It is to be noted, furthermore, in this connection, that by a  singular turn of fortune, Great Britain, whose system of impressing  American sailors had been one of the chief causes of the war, herself  became, in consequence of that very system, in some sort, a nursery  for the seamen of the young Republican navy. The American sailor  feared nothing more than being impressed on a British ship--dreading  beyond measure the hard life and cruel discipline aboard of her;  but once there, he usually did well enough, and in course of time  often rose to be of some little consequence. For years before 1812,  the number of these impressed sailors was in reality greater than  the entire number serving in the American navy, from which it will  readily be seen that they formed a good stock to draw upon. Very  much to their credit, they never lost their devotion to the home  of their birth, more than two thousand of them being imprisoned at  the beginning of the war because they refused to serve against their  country. When Commodore Decatur captured the _Macedonian_, that  officer, as we learn from Marshall's \"Naval Biography\" (ii. 1019),  stated that most of the seamen of his own frigate, the _United  States_, had served in British war vessels, and that some had been  with Lord Nelson in the _Victory_, and had even been bargemen to  the great Admiral,--a pretty sure proof that the American sailors  did not show a disadvantage when compared with others. [Footnote:  With perfect gravity, James and his followers assume Decatur's  statement to be equivalent to saying that he had chiefly British  seamen on board; whereas, even as quoted by Marshall, Decatur  merely said that \"his seamen had served on board a British  man-of-war,\" and that some \"had served under Lord Nelson.\" Like  the _Constitution_, the _United States_ had rid herself of most of  the British subjects on board, before sailing. Decatur's remark  simply referred to the number of his American seamen who had been  impressed on board British ships. Whenever James says that an  American ship had a large proportion of British sailors aboard,  the explanation is that a large number of the crew were Americans  who had been impressed on British ships. It would be no more absurd  to claim Trafalgar as an American victory because there was a  certain number of Americans in Nelson's fleet, than it is to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/917"],[0,"Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty (#10)"],[1,"their seats at table, 'what is this I hear about last night?'    'All true, my dear; true as the Gospel, Doll.'    'Young Mr Chester robbed, and lying wounded in the road, when you came  up!'    'Ay--Mr Edward. And beside him, Barnaby, calling for help with all his  might. It was well it happened as it did; for the road's a lonely one,  the hour was late, and, the night being cold, and poor Barnaby even less  sensible than usual from surprise and fright, the young gentleman might  have met his death in a very short time.'    'I dread to think of it!' cried his daughter with a shudder. 'How did  you know him?'    'Know him!' returned the locksmith. 'I didn't know him--how could I? I  had never seen him, often as I had heard and spoken of him. I took him  to Mrs Rudge's; and she no sooner saw him than the truth came out.'    'Miss Emma, father--If this news should reach her, enlarged upon as it  is sure to be, she will go distracted.'    'Why, lookye there again, how a man suffers for being good-natured,'  said the locksmith. 'Miss Emma was with her uncle at the masquerade at  Carlisle House, where she had gone, as the people at the Warren told me,  sorely against her will. What does your blockhead father when he and Mrs  Rudge have laid their heads together, but goes there when he ought to be  abed, makes interest with his friend the doorkeeper, slips him on a mask  and domino, and mixes with the masquers.'    'And like himself to do so!' cried the girl, putting her fair arm round  his neck, and giving him a most enthusiastic kiss.    'Like himself!' repeated Gabriel, affecting to grumble, but evidently  delighted with the part he had taken, and with her praise. 'Very like  himself--so your mother said. However, he mingled with the crowd,  and prettily worried and badgered he was, I warrant you, with people  squeaking, \"Don't you know me?\" and \"I've found you out,\" and all that  kind of nonsense in his ears. He might have wandered on till now, but  in a little room there was a young lady who had taken off her mask, on  account of the place being very warm, and was sitting there alone.'    'And that was she?' said his daughter hastily.    'And that was she,' replied the locksmith; 'and I no sooner whispered to  her what the matter was--as softly, Doll, and with nearly as much art as  you could have used yourself--than she gives a kind of scream and faints  away.'    'What did you do--what happened next?' asked his daughter. 'Why, the  masks came flocking round, with a general noise and hubbub, and I  thought myself in luck to get clear off, that's all,' rejoined the  locksmith. 'What happened when I reached home you may guess, if you  didn't hear it. Ah! Well, it's a poor heart that never rejoices.--Put  Toby this way, my dear.'    This Toby was the brown jug of which previous mention has been made.  Applying his lips to the worthy old gentleman's benevolent forehead, the  locksmith, who had all this time been ravaging among the eatables, kept  them there so long, at the same time raising the vessel slowly in  the air, that at length Toby stood on his head upon his nose, when he  smacked his lips, and set him on the table again with fond reluctance.    Although Sim Tappertit had taken no share in this conversation, no part  of it being addressed to him, he had not been wanting in such silent  manifestations of astonishment, as he deemed most compatible with the  favourable display of his eyes. Regarding the pause which now ensued, as  a particularly advantageous opportunity for doing great execution with  them upon the locksmith's daughter (who he had no doubt was looking  at him in mute admiration), he began to screw and twist his face,  and especially those features, into such extraordinary, hideous, and  unparalleled contortions, that Gabriel, who happened to look towards  him, was stricken with amazement.    'Why, what the devil's the matter with the lad?' cried the locksmith.  'Is he choking?'    'Who?' demanded Sim, with some disdain.    'Who? Why, you,' returned his master. 'What do you mean by making those  horrible faces over your breakfast?'    'Faces are matters of taste, sir,' said Mr Tappertit, rather  discomfited; not the less so because he saw the locksmith's daughter  smiling.    'Sim,' rejoined Gabriel, laughing heartily. 'Don't be a fool, for I'd  rather see you in your senses. These young fellows,' he added, turning  to his daughter, 'are always committing some folly or another. There was  a quarrel between Joe Willet and old John last night though I can't say  Joe was much in fault either. He'll be missing one of these mornings,  and will have gone away upon some wild-goose errand, seeking his  fortune.--Why, what's the matter, Doll? YOU are making faces now. The  girls are as bad as the boys every bit!'    'It's the tea,' said Dolly, turning alternately very red and very white,  which is no doubt the effect of a slight scald--'so very hot.'    Mr Tappertit looked immensely big at a quartern loaf on the table, and  breathed hard.    'Is that all?' returned the locksmith. 'Put some more milk in it.--Yes,  I am sorry for Joe, because he is a likely young fellow, and gains upon  one every time one sees him. But he'll start off, you'll find. Indeed he  told me as much himself!'    'Indeed!' cried Dolly in a faint voice. 'In-deed!'    'Is the tea tickling your throat still, my dear?' said the locksmith.    But, before his daughter could make him any answer, she was taken with  a troublesome cough, and it was such a very unpleasant cough, that,  when she left off, the tears were starting in her bright eyes. The  good-natured locksmith was still patting her on the back and applying  such gentle restoratives, when a message arrived from Mrs Varden, making  known to all whom it might concern, that she felt too much indisposed  to rise after her great agitation and anxiety of the previous night; and  therefore desired to be immediately accommodated with the little black  teapot of strong mixed tea, a couple of rounds of buttered toast, a  middling-sized dish of beef and ham cut thin, and the Protestant Manual  in two volumes post octavo. Like some other ladies who in remote  ages flourished upon this globe, Mrs Varden was most devout when most  ill-tempered. Whenever she and her husband were at unusual variance,  then the Protestant Manual was in high feather.    Knowing from experience what these requests portended, the triumvirate  broke up; Dolly, to see the orders executed with all despatch; Gabriel,  to some out-of-door work in his little chaise; and Sim, to his daily  duty in the workshop, to which retreat he carried the big look, although  the loaf remained behind.    Indeed the big look increased immensely, and when he had tied his apron  on, became quite gigantic. It was not until he had several times walked  up and down with folded arms, and the longest strides he could take,  and had kicked a great many small articles out of his way, that his lip  began to curl. At length, a gloomy derision came upon his features, and  he smiled; uttering meanwhile with supreme contempt the monosyllable  'Joe!'    'I eyed her over, while he talked about the fellow,' he said, 'and that  was of course the reason of her being confused. Joe!'    He walked up and down again much quicker than before, and if possible  with longer strides; sometimes stopping to take a glance at his legs,  and sometimes to jerk out, and cast from him, another 'Joe!' In the  course of a quarter of an hour or so he again assumed the paper cap and  tried to work. No. It could not be done.    'I'll do nothing to-day,' said Mr Tappertit, dashing it down again, 'but  grind. I'll grind up all the tools. Grinding will suit my present humour  well. Joe!'    Whirr-r-r-r. The grindstone was soon in motion; the sparks were flying  off in showers. This was the occupation for his heated spirit.    Whirr-r-r-r-r-r-r.    'Something will come of this!' said Mr Tappertit, pausing as if in  triumph, and wiping his heated face upon his sleeve. 'Something will  come of this. I hope it mayn't be human gore!'    Whirr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r.        Chapter 5      As soon as the business of the day was over, the locksmith sallied  forth, alone, to visit the wounded gentleman and ascertain the progress  of his recovery. The house where he had left him was in a by-street  in Southwark, not far from London Bridge; and thither he hied with all  speed, bent upon returning with as little delay as might be, and getting  to bed betimes.    The evening was boisterous--scarcely better than the previous night had  been. It was not easy for a stout man like Gabriel to keep his legs at  the street corners, or to make head against the high wind, which often  fairly got the better of him, and drove him back some paces, or, in  defiance of all his energy, forced him to take shelter in an arch or  doorway until the fury of the gust was spent. Occasionally a hat or wig,  or both, came spinning and trundling past him, like a mad thing; while  the more serious spectacle of falling tiles and slates, or of masses of  brick and mortar or fragments of stone-coping rattling upon the pavement  near at hand, and splitting into fragments, did not increase the  pleasure of the journey, or make the way less dreary.    'A trying night for a man like me to walk in!' said the locksmith, as  he knocked softly at the widow's door. 'I'd rather be in old John's  chimney-corner, faith!'    'Who's there?' demanded a woman's voice from within. Being answered, it  added a hasty word of welcome, and the door was quickly opened.    She was about forty--perhaps two or three years older--with a cheerful  aspect, and a face that had once been pretty. It bore traces of  affliction and care, but they were of an old date, and Time had smoothed  them. Any one who had bestowed but a casual glance on Barnaby might  have known that this was his mother, from the strong resemblance between  them; but where in his"]]]
