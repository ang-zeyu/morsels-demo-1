[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1271"],[0,"Bygone Beliefs: Being a Series of Excursions in the Byways of Thought (#11)"],[1,"turn our attention, however, to the art of preparing talismans  proper: I may remark at the outset that it was necessary for the  talisman to be prepared by one's own self--a task by no means easy as  a rule. Indeed, the right mental attitude of the occultist was insisted  upon as essential to the operation.    As to the various signs to be engraver on the talismans, various  authorities differ, though there are certain points connected with the  art of talismanic magic on which they all agree. It so happened that the  ancients were acquainted with seven metals and seven planets (including  the sun and moon as planets), and the days of the week are also seven.  It was concluded, therefore, that there was some occult connection  between the planets, metals, and days of the week. Each of the seven  days of the week was supposed to be under the auspices of the spirits of  one of the planets; so also was the generation in the womb of Nature of  each of the seven chief metals.    In the following table are shown these particulars in detail:--           Planet.  Symbol.   Day of    Metal.       Colour.         Sun.    {}        Sunday    Gold         Gold or yellow.       Moon.   {}        Monday    Silver       Silver or white.       Mars.   {}        Tuesday   Iron         Red.       Mercury  {}        Wednesday (1)Mercury   Mixed colours or purple.

(1) Used in the form of a solid amalgam for talismans.    Consequently, the metal of which a talisman was to be made, and also the  time of its preparation, had to be chosen with due regard to the planet  under which it was to be prepared.(1) The power of such a talisman was  thought to be due to the genie of this planet--a talisman, was, in fact,  a silent evocation of an astral spirit. Examples of the belief that a  genie can be bound up in an amulet in some way are afforded by the story  of ALADDIN'S lamp and ring and other stories in the _Thousand and  One Nights_. Sometimes the talismanic signs were engraved on precious  stones, sometimes they were inscribed on parchment; in both cases the  same principle held good, the nature of the stone chosen, or the colour  of the ink employed, being that in correspondence with the planet under  whose auspices the talisman was prepared.      (1) In this connection a rather surprising discovery made by Mr W.  GORNOLD (see his _A Manual of Occultism_, 1911, pp. 7 and 8) must be  mentioned. The ancient Chaldeans appear invariably to have enumerated  the planets in the following order: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus,  Mercury, Moon--which order was adopted by the mediaeval astrologers.  Let us commence with the Sun in the above sequence, and write down every  third planet; we then have--          Sun .   .   .   . Sunday.            Moon.   .   .   . Monday.            Mars.   .   .   . Tuesday.            Mercury. .   .   . Wednesday.            Jupiter..   .   . Thursday.            Venus.  .   .   . Friday.            Saturn. .   .   . Saturday.    That is to say, we have the planets in the order in which they were  supposed to rule over the days of the week. This is perhaps, not so  surprising, because it seems probable that, each day being first divided  into twenty-four hours, it was assumed that the planets ruled for one  hour in turn, in the order first mentioned above. Each day was then  named after the planet which ruled during its first hour. It will be  found that if we start with the Sun and write down every twenty-fourth  planet, the result is exactly the same as if we write down every third.  But Mr OLD points out further, doing so by means of a diagram which  seems to be rather cumbersome that if we start with Saturn in the first  place, and write down every fifth planet, and then for each planet  substitute the metal over which it was supposed to rule, we then have  these metals arranged in descending order of atomic weights, thus:--         Saturn   .   .   . Lead (=207).       Mercury  .   .   . Mercury (=200).       Sun.    .   .   . Gold (=197).       Jupiter  .   .   . Tin (=119).       Moon.   .   .   . Silver (=108).       Venus         .   . Copper (=64).       Mars.   .   .   . Iron (=56).      Similarly we can, starting from any one of these orders, pass to the  other two. The fact is a very surprising one, because the ancients could  not possibly have been acquainted with the atomic weights of the metals,  and, it is important to note, the order of the densities of these  metals, which might possibly have been known to them, is by no means the  same as the order of their atomic weights. Whether the fact indicates a  real relationship between the planets and the metals, or whether there  is some other explanation, I am not prepared to say. Certainly some  explanation is needed: to say that the fact is mere coincidence is  unsatisfactory, seeing that the odds against, not merely this, but any  such regularity occurring by chance--as calculated by the mathematical  theory of probability--are 119 to 1.      All the instruments employed in the art had to be specially prepared and  consecrated. Special robes had to be worn, perfumes and incense burnt,  and invocations, conjurations, _etc_., recited, all of which depended  on the planet ruling the operation. A description of a few typical  talismans in detail will not here be out of place.    In _The Key of Solomon the King_ (translated by S. L. M. MATHERS,  1889)(1) are described five, six, or seven talismans for each planet.  Each of these was supposed to have its own peculiar virtues, and many of  them are stated to be of use in the evocation of spirits. The majority  of them consist of a central design encircled by a verse of Hebrew  Scripture. The central designs are of a varied character, generally  geometrical figures and Hebrew letters or words, or magical characters.  Five of these talismans are here portrayed, the first three described  differing from the above. The translations of the Hebrew verses, _etc_.,  given below are due to Mr MATHERS.      (1) The _Clavicula Salomonis_, or _Key of Solomon the King_, consists  mainly of an elaborate ritual for the evocation of the various planetary  spirits, in which process the use of talismans or pentacles plays a  prominent part. It is claimed to be a work of white magic, but, inasmuch  as it, like other old books making the same claim, gives descriptions  of a pentacle for causing ruin, destruction, and death, and another for  causing earthquakes--to give only two examples,--the distinction between  black and white magic, which we shall no doubt encounter again in later  excursions, appears to be somewhat arbitrary.    Regarding the authorship of the work, Mr MATHERS, translator and editor  of the first printed copy of the book, says, \"I see no reason to  doubt the tradition which assigns the authorship of the 'Key' to King  Solomon.\" If this view be accepted, however, it is abundantly evident  that the _Key_ as it stands at present (in which we find S. JOHN  quoted, and mention made of SS. PETER and PAUL) must have received some  considerable alterations and additions at the hands of later editors.  But even if we are compelled to assign the _Clavicula Salomonis_ in its  present form to the fourteenth or fifteenth century, we must, I think,  allow that it was based upon traditions of the past, and, of course,  the possibility remains that it might have been based upon some earlier  work. With regard to the antiquity of the planetary sigils, Mr MATHERS  notes \"that, among the Gnostic talismans in the British Museum, there is  a ring of copper with the sigils of Venus, which are exactly the same as  those given by mediaeval writers on magic.\"    In spite of the absurdity of its claims, viewed in the light of modern  knowledge, the _Clavicula Salomonis_ exercised a considerable influence  in the past, and is to be regarded as one of the chief sources of  mediaeval ceremonial magic. Historically speaking, therefore, it is a  book of no little importance.      _The First Pentacle of the Sun_.--\"The Countenance of Shaddai the  Almighty, at Whose aspect all creatures obey, and the Angelic Spirits  do reverence on bended knees.\" About the face is the name \"El Shaddai\".  Around is written in Latin: \"Behold His face and form by Whom all things  were made, and Whom all creatures obey\" (see fig. 21).      _The Fifth Pentacle of Mars_.--\"Write thou this Pentacle upon virgin  parchment or paper because it is terrible unto the Demons, and at  its sight and aspect they will obey thee, for they cannot resist its  presence.\" The design is a Scorpion,(1) around which the word Hvl is  repeated. The Hebrew versicle is from _Psalm_ xci. 13: \"Thou shalt go  upon the lion and adder, the young lion and the dragon shalt thou tread  under thy feet\" (see fig. 22).      (1) In astrology the zodiacal sign of the scorpion is the \"night house\"  of the planet Mars.      _The Third Pentacle of the Moon_.--\"This being duly borne with thee when  upon a journey, if it be properly made, serveth against all attacks by  night, and against every kind of danger and peril by Water.\" The design  consists of a hand and sleeved forearm (this occurs on three other  moon talismans), together with the Hebrew names Aub and Vevaphel. The  versicle is from _Psalm_ xl. 13: \"Be pleased O IHVH to deliver me, O  IHVH make haste to help me\" (see fig 23)    _The Third Pentacle of Venus_.--\"This, if it be only shown unto any  person, serveth to attract love. Its Angel Monachiel should be invoked  in the day and hour of Venus, at one o'clock or at eight.\" The design  consists of two triangles joined at their apices, with the following  names--IHVH, Adonai, Ruach, Achides, AEgalmiel, Monachiel, and Degaliel.  The versicle is from _Genesis_ i. 28: \"And the Elohim"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12753"],[0,"The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (#11)"],[1,"to come forward in the press of  knights and nobles. But in his heart he felt assured that he could do  better--if Heaven willed--than any knight among them all.    So as the damsel left the king, he called to her and said, \"Damsel, I pray  thee of thy courtesy, suffer me to try the sword as well as all these  lords; for though I be but poorly clad, I feel assurance in my heart.\"    The damsel looking at him, saw in him a likely an honest man, but because  of his poor garments could not think him to be any knight of worship, and  said, \"Sir, there is no need to put me to any more pain or labour; why  shouldst thou succeed where so many worthy ones have failed?\"    \"Ah, fair lady,\" answered Balin, \"worthiness and brave deeds are not shown  by fair raiment, but manhood and truth lie hid within the heart. There be  many worshipful knights unknown to all the people.\"    \"By my faith, thou sayest truth,\" replied the damsel; \"try therefore, if  thou wilt, what thou canst do.\"    So Balin took the sword by the girdle and hilt, and drew it lightly out,  and looking on its workmanship and brightness, it pleased him greatly.    But the king and all the barons marvelled at Sir Balin's fortune, and many  knights were envious of him, for, \"Truly,\" said the damsel, \"this is a  passing good knight, and the best man I have ever found, and the most  worshipfully free from treason, treachery, or villainy, and many wonders  shall he achieve.\"    \"Now, gentle and courteous knight,\" continued she, turning to Balin, \"give  me the sword again.\"    \"Nay,\" said Sir Balin, \"save it be taken from me by force, I shall  preserve this sword for evermore.\"    \"Thou art not wise,\" replied the damsel, \"to keep it from me; for if thou  wilt do so, thou shalt slay with it the best friend thou hast, and the  sword shall be thine destruction also.\"    \"I will take whatever adventure God may send,\" said Balin; \"but the sword  will I keep, by the faith of my body.\"    \"Thou will repent it shortly,\" said the damsel; \"I would take the sword  for thy sake rather than for mine for I am passing grieved and heavy for  thy sake, who wilt not believe the peril I foretell thee.\" With that she  departed, making great lamentation.    Then Balin sent for his horse and armour, and took his leave of King  Arthur, who urged him to stay at his court. \"For,\" said he, \"I believe  that thou art displeased that I showed thee unkindness; blame me not  overmuch, for I was misinformed against thee, and knew not truly what a  knight of worship thou art. Abide in this court with my good knights, and  I will so advance thee that thou shalt be well pleased.\"    \"God thank thee, Lord,\" said Balin, \"for no man can reward thy bounty and  thy nobleness; but at this time I must needs depart, praying thee ever to  hold me in thy favour.\"    \"Truly,\" said King Arthur, \"I am grieved for thy departure; but tarry not  long, and thou shalt be right welcome to me and all my knights when thou  returnest, and I will repair my neglect and all that I have done amiss  against thee.\"    \"God thank thee, Lord,\" again said Balin, and made ready to depart.    But meanwhile came into the court a lady upon horseback, full richly  dressed, and saluted King Arthur, and asked him for the gift that he had  promised her when she gave him his sword Excalibur, \"for,\" said she, \"I am  the lady of the lake.\"    \"Ask what thou wilt,\" said the king, \"and thou shalt have it, if I have  power to give.\"    \"I ask,\" said she, \"the head of that knight who hath just achieved the  sword, or else the damsel's head who brought it, or else both; for the  knight slew my brother, and the lady caused my father's death.\"    \"Truly,\" said King Arthur, \"I cannot grant thee this desire; it were  against my nature and against my name; but ask whatever else thou wilt,  and I will do it.\"    \"I will demand no other thing,\" said she.    And as she spake came Balin, on his way to leave the court, and saw her  where she stood, and knew her straightway for his mother's murderess, whom  he had sought in vain three years. And when they told him that she had  asked King Arthur for his head, he went up straight to her and said, \"May  evil have thee! Thou desirest my head, therefore shalt thou lose thine;\"  and with his sword he lightly smote her head off, in the presence of the  king and all the court.    \"Alas, for shame!\" cried out King Arthur, rising up in wrath; \"why hast  thou done this, shaming both me and my court? I am beholden greatly to  this lady, and under my safe conduct came she here; thy deed is passing  shameful; never shall I forgive thy villainy.\"    \"Lord,\" cried Sir Balin, \"hear me; this lady was the falsest living, and  by her witchcraft hath destroyed many, and caused my mother also to be  burnt to death by her false arts and treachery.\"    \"What cause soever thou mightest have had,\" said the king, \"thou shouldst  have forborne her in my presence. Deceive not thyself, thou shalt repent  this sin, for such a shame was never brought upon my court; depart now  from my face with all the haste thou mayest.\"    Then Balin took up the head of the lady and carried it to his lodgings,  and rode forth with his squire from out the town. Then said he, \"Now must  we part; take ye this head and bear it to my friends in Northumberland,  and tell them how I speed, and that our worst foe is dead; also tell them  that I am free from prison, and of the adventure of my sword.\"    \"Alas!\" said the squire, \"ye are greatly to blame to have so displeased  King Arthur.\"    \"As for that,\" said Sir Balin, \"I go now to find King Ryence, and destroy  him or lose my life; for should I take him prisoner, and lead him to the  court, perchance King Arthur would forgive me, and become my good and  gracious lord.\"    \"Where shall I meet thee again?\" said the squire.    \"In King Arthur's court,\" said Balin.          CHAPTER V    _Sir Balin Smites the Dolorous Stroke, and Fights with his Brother, Sir  Balan_      Now there was a knight at the court more envious than the others of Sir  Balin, for he counted himself one of the best knights in Britain. His name  was Lancear; and going to the king, he begged leave to follow after Sir  Balin and avenge the insult he had put upon the court. \"Do thy best,\"  replied the king, \"for I am passing wroth with Balin.\"    In the meantime came Merlin, and was told of this adventure of the sword  and lady of the lake.    \"Now hear me,\" said he, \"when I tell ye that this lady who hath brought  the sword is the falsest damsel living.\"    \"Say not so,\" they answered, \"for she hath a brother a good knight, who  slew another knight this damsel loved; so she, to be revenged upon her  brother, went to the Lady Lile, of Avilion, and besought her help. Then  Lady Lile gave her the sword, and told her that no man should draw it  forth but one, a valiant knight and strong, who should avenge her on her  brother. This, therefore, was the reason why the damsel came here.\" \"I  know it all as well as ye do,\" answered Merlin; \"and would to God she had  never come hither, for never came she into any company but to do harm; and  that good knight who hath achieved the sword shall be himself slain by it,  which shall be great harm and loss, for a better knight there liveth not;  and he shall do unto my lord the king great honour and service.\"    Then Sir Lancear, having armed himself at all points, mounted, and rode  after Sir Balin, as fast as he could go, and overtaking him, he cried  aloud, \"Abide, Sir knight! wait yet awhile, or I shall make thee do so.\"    Hearing him cry, Sir Balin fiercely turned his horse, and said, \"Fair  knight, what wilt thou with me? wilt thou joust?\"    \"Yea,\" said Sir Lancear, \"it is for that I have pursued thee.\"    \"Peradventure,\" answered Balin, \"thou hadst best have staid at home, for  many a man who thinketh himself already victor, endeth by his own  downfall. Of what court art thou?\"    \"Of King Arthur's court,\" cried Lancear, \"and I am come to revenge the  insult thou hast put on it this day.\"    \"Well,\" said Sir Balin, \"I see that I must fight thee, and I repent to be  obliged to grieve King Arthur or his knights; and thy quarrel seemeth full  foolish to me, for the damsel that is dead worked endless evils through  the land, or else I had been loath as any knight that liveth to have slain  a lady.\"    \"Make thee ready,\" shouted Lancear, \"for one of us shall rest for ever in  this field.\"    But at their first encounter Sir Lancear's spear flew into splinters from  Sir Balin's shield, and Sir Balin's lance pierced with such might through  Sir Lancear's shield that it rove the hauberk also, and passed through the  knight's body and the horse's crupper. And Sir Balin turning fiercely  round again, drew out his sword, and knew not that he had already slain  him; and then he saw him lie a corpse upon the ground.    At that same moment came a damsel riding towards him as fast as her horse  could gallop, who, when she saw Sir Lancear dead, wept and sorrowed out of  measure, crying, \"O, Sir Balin, two bodies hast thou slain, and one heart;  and two hearts in one body; and two souls also hast thou lost.\"    Therewith she took the sword from her dead lover's side--for she was Sir  Lancear's lady-love--and setting the pommel of it on the ground, ran  herself through the body with the blade.    When Sir Balin saw her dead he was sorely hurt and grieved in spirit, and  repented the death of Lancear, which had also caused so fair a lady's  death. And being unable to look on their bodies for sorrow, he turned  aside into a forest, where presently as he rode, he saw the arms of his  brother, Sir Balan. And when they were met they put off their helms, and  embraced each other, kissing, and weeping for joy and pity. Then Sir Balin  told Sir Balan all his late adventures, and that he was on his way to King  Ryence, who at that time was besieging Castle Terrabil. \"I will be with  thee,\" answered Sir Balan, \"and we"]]]
