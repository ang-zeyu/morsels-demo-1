And for a while this humiliation ate into his untamed soul. It was his  lugubrious lot to accompany me in my rambles, preside over my blunders,  and save me from calamitously passing into the next world. He bore it in  courteous silence, except when speaking was necessary. He would show me  the lower ford, which I could never find for myself, generally mistaking  a quicksand for it. He would tie my horse properly. He would recommend  me not to shoot my rifle at a white-tailed deer in the particular moment  that the outfit wagon was passing behind the animal on the further side  of the brush. There was seldom a day that he was not obliged to hasten  and save me from sudden death or from ridicule, which is worse. Yet  never once did he lose his patience and his gentle, slow voice, and  apparently lazy manner remained the same, whether we were sitting at  lunch together, or up in the mountain during a hunt, or whether he  was bringing me back my horse, which had run away because I had again  forgotten to throw the reins over his head and let them trail.    \"He'll always stand if yu' do that,\" the Virginian would say. \"See how  my hawss stays right quiet yondeh.\"    After such admonition he would say no more to me. But this tame  nursery business was assuredly gall to him. For though utterly a man  in countenance and in his self-possession and incapacity to be put at  a loss, he was still boyishly proud of his wild calling, and wore his  leather straps and jingled his spurs with obvious pleasure. His tiger  limberness and his beauty were rich with unabated youth; and that force  which lurked beneath his surface must often have curbed his intolerance  of me. In spite of what I knew must be his opinion of me, the  tenderfoot, my liking for him grew, and I found his silent company more  and more agreeable. That he had spells of talking, I had already learned  at Medicine Bow. But his present taciturnity might almost have effaced  this impression, had I not happened to pass by the bunk-house one  evening after dark, when Honey Wiggin and the rest of the cow-boys were  gathered inside it.    That afternoon the Virginian and I had gone duck shooting. We had  found several in a beaver dam, and I had killed two as they sat close  together; but they floated against the breastwork of sticks out in the  water some four feet deep, where the escaping current might carry them  down the stream. The Judge's red setter had not accompanied us, because  she was expecting a family.    \"We don't want her along anyways,\" the cow-puncher had explained to me.  \"She runs around mighty irresponsible, and she'll stand a prairie-dog  'bout as often as she'll stand a bird. She's a triflin' animal.\"    My anxiety to own the ducks caused me to pitch into the water with  all my clothes on, and subsequently crawl out a slippery, triumphant,  weltering heap. The Virginian's serious eyes had rested upon this  spectacle of mud; but he expressed nothing, as usual.    \"They ain't overly good eatin',\" he observed, tying the birds to his  saddle. \"They're divers.\"    \"Divers!\" I exclaimed. \"Why didn't they dive?\"    \"I reckon they was young ones and hadn't experience.\"    \"Well,\" I said, crestfallen, but attempting to be humorous, \"I did the  diving myself.\"    But the Virginian made no comment. He handed me my double-barrelled  English gun, which I was about to leave deserted on the ground  behind me, and we rode home in our usual silence, the mean little  white-breasted, sharp-billed divers dangling from his saddle.    It was in the bunk-house that he took his revenge. As I passed I heard  his gentle voice silently achieving some narrative to an attentive  audience, and just as I came by the open window where he sat on his bed  in shirt and drawers, his back to me, I heard his concluding words,  \"And the hat on his haid was the one mark showed yu' he weren't a  snappin'-turtle.\"    The anecdote met with instantaneous success, and I hurried away into the  dark. The next morning I was occupied with the chickens. Two hens were  fighting to sit on some eggs that a third was daily laying, and which  I did not want hatched, and for the third time I had kicked Em'ly off  seven potatoes she had rolled together and was determined to raise I  know not what sort of family from. She was shrieking about the hen-house  as the Virginian came in to observe (I suspect) what I might be doing  now that could be useful for him to mention in the bunk-house.    He stood awhile, and at length said, \"We lost our best rooster when Mrs.  Henry came to live hyeh.\"    I paid no attention.    \"He was a right elegant Dominicker,\" he continued.    I felt a little riled about the snapping-turtle, and showed no interest  in what he was saying, but continued my functions among the hens. This  unusual silence of mine seemed to elicit unusual speech from him.    \"Yu' see, that rooster he'd always lived round hyeh when the Judge was  a bachelor, and he never seen no ladies or any persons wearing female  gyarments. You ain't got rheumatism, seh?\"    \"Me? No.\"    \"I reckoned maybe them little odd divers yu' got damp goin' afteh--\" He  paused.    \"Oh, no, not in the least, thank you.\"    \"Yu' seemed sort o' grave this mawnin', and I'm cert'nly glad it ain't  them divers.\"    \"Well, the rooster?\" I inquired finally.    \"Oh, him! He weren't raised where he could see petticoats. Mrs. Henry  she come hyeh from the railroad with the Judge afteh dark. Next mawnin'  early she walked out to view her new home, and the rooster was a-feedin'  by the door, and he seen her. Well, seh, he screeched that awful I run  out of the bunk-house; and he jus' went over the fence and took down  Sunk Creek shoutin' fire, right along. He has never come back.\"    \"There's a hen over there now that has no judgment,\" I said, indicating  Em'ly. She had got herself outside the house, and was on the bars of a  corral, her vociferations reduced to an occasional squawk. I told him  about the potatoes.    \"I never knowed her name before,\" said he. \"That runaway rooster, he  hated her. And she hated him same as she hates 'em all.\"    \"I named her myself,\" said I, \"after I came to notice her particularly.  There's an old maid at home who's charitable, and belongs to the Cruelty  to Animals, and she never knows whether she had better cross in front  of a street car or wait. I named the hen after her. Does she ever lay  eggs?\"    The Virginian had not \"troubled his haid\" over the poultry.    \"Well, I don't believe she knows how. I think she came near being a  rooster.\"    \"She's sure manly-lookin',\" said the Virginian. We had walked toward the  corral, and he was now scrutinizing Em'ly with interest.    She was an egregious fowl. She was huge and gaunt, with great yellow  beak, and she stood straight and alert in the manner of responsible  people. There was something wrong with her tail. It slanted far to  one side, one feather in it twice as long as the rest. Feathers on her  breast there were none. These had been worn entirely off by her habit of  sitting upon potatoes and other rough abnormal objects. And this lent  to her appearance an air of being decollete, singularly at variance  with her otherwise prudish ensemble. Her eye was remarkably bright, but  somehow it had an outraged expression. It was as if she went about the  world perpetually scandalized over the doings that fell beneath her  notice. Her legs were blue, long, and remarkably stout.    \"She'd ought to wear knickerbockers,\" murmured the Virginian. \"She'd  look a heap better 'n some o' them college students. And she'll set on  potatoes, yu' say?\"    \"She thinks she can hatch out anything. I've found her with onions, and  last Tuesday I caught her on two balls of soap.\"    In the afternoon the tall cow-puncher and I rode out to get an antelope.    After an hour, during which he was completely taciturn, he said: \"I  reckon maybe this hyeh lonesome country ain't been healthy for Em'ly to  live in. It ain't for some humans. Them old trappers in the mountains  gets skewed in the haid mighty often, an' talks out loud when nobody's  nigher 'n a hundred miles.\"    \"Em'ly has not been solitary,\" I replied. \"There are forty chickens  here.\"    \"That's so,\" said he. \"It don't explain her.\"    He fell silent again, riding beside me, easy and indolent in the saddle.  His long figure looked so loose and inert that the swift, light spring  he made to the ground seemed an impossible feat. He had seen an antelope  where I saw none.    \"Take a shot yourself,\" I urged him, as he motioned me to be quick. \"You  never shoot when I'm with you.\"    \"I ain't hyeh for that,\" he answered. \"Now you've let him get away on  yu'!\"    The antelope had in truth departed.    \"Why,\" he said to my protest, \"I can hit them things any day. What's  your notion as to Em'ly?\"    \"I can't account for her,\" I replied.    \"Well,\" he said musingly, and then his mind took one of those particular  turns that made me love him, \"Taylor ought to see her. She'd be just the  schoolmarm for Bear Creek!\"    \"She's not much like the eating-house lady at Medicine Bow,\" I said.    He gave a hilarious chuckle. \"No, Em'ly knows nothing o' them joys. So  yu' have no notion about her? Well, I've got one. I reckon maybe she was  hatched after a big thunderstorm.\"    \"In a big thunderstorm!\" I exclaimed.    \"Yes. Don't yu' know about them, and what they'll do to aiggs? A  big case o' lightnin' and thunder will addle aiggs and keep 'em from  hatchin'. And I expect one came along, and all the other aiggs of  Em'ly's set didn't hatch out, but got plumb addled, and she happened not  to get addled that far, and so she just managed to make it through. But  she cert'nly ain't got a strong haid.\"    \"I fear she has not,\" said I.    \"Mighty hon'ble intentions,\" he observed. \"If she can't make out to lay  anything, she wants to hatch somethin', and be a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12982"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science — Volume 1, No. (#11)"],[1,"to  plead; and his aunt dying inopportunely, first his resources failed,  and then his health. He had no sooner returned to his home, than,  to complicate his difficulties completely, he fell in love with  Mademoiselle Natalie de Bellefonds, who had just returned from Paris,  where she had been completing her education. To expatiate on the  perfections of Mademoiselle Natalie, would be a waste of ink and  paper: it is sufficient to say that she really was a very charming  girl, with a fortune which, though not large, would have been a most  desirable acquisition to de Chaulieu, who had nothing. Neither was  the fair Natalie indisposed to listen to his addresses, but her father  could not be expected to countenance the suit of a gentleman, however  well-born, who had not a ten-sous piece in the world, and whose  prospects were a blank.    Whilst the ambitious and love-sick young barrister was thus pining in  unwelcome obscurity, his old acquaintance, Jacques Rollet, had been  acquiring an undesirable notoriety. There was nothing really bad  in Jacques' disposition, but having been bred up a democrat, with  a hatred of the nobility, he could not easily accommodate his rough  humor to treat them with civility when it was no longer safe to insult  them. The liberties he allowed himself whenever circumstances brought  him into contact with the higher classes of society, had led him into  many scrapes, out of which his father's money had one way or another  released him; but that source of safety had now failed. Old Rollet  having been too busy with the affairs of the nation to attend to his  business, had died insolvent, leaving his son with nothing but his  own wits to help him out of future difficulties, and it was not long  before their exercise was called for. Claudine Rollet, his sister, who  was a very pretty girl, had attracted the attention of Mademoiselle de  Bellefonds' brother, Alphonso; and as he paid her more attention than  from such a quarter was agreeable to Jacques, the young men had had  more than one quarrel on the subject, on which occasions they had  each, characteristically, given vent to their enmity, the one in  contemptuous monosyllables, and the other in a volley of insulting  words. But Claudine had another lover more nearly of her own condition  of life; this was Claperon, the deputy governor of Rouen jail, with  whom she had made acquaintance during one or two compulsory visits  paid by her brother to that functionary; but Claudine, who was a bit  of a coquette, though she did not altogether reject his suit, gave him  little encouragement, so that betwixt hopes, and fears, and doubts,  and jealousies, pour Claperon led a very uneasy kind of life.    Affairs had been for some time in this position, when, one fine  morning, Alphonse de Bellefonds was not to be found in his chamber  when his servant went to call him; neither had his bed been slept in.  He had been observed to go out rather late on the preceding evening,  but whether or not he had returned, nobody could tell. He had not  appeared at supper, but that was too ordinary an event to awaken  suspicion; and little alarm was excited till several hours had  elapsed, when inquiries were instituted and a search commenced, which  terminated in the discovery of his body, a good deal mangled, lying  at the bottom of a pond which had belonged to the old brewery. Before  any investigations had been made, every person had jumped to the  conclusion that the young man had been murdered, and that Jacques  Rollet was the assassin. There was a strong presumption in favor of  that opinion, which further perquisitions tended to confirm. Only the  day before, Jacques had been heard to threaten Mons. de Bellefonds  with speedy vengeance. On the fatal evening, Alphonse and Claudine had  been seen together in the neighborhood of the now dismantled brewery;  and as Jacques, betwixt poverty and democracy, was in bad odor with  the prudent and respectable part of society, it was not easy for him  to bring witnesses to character, or prove an unexceptionable alibi. As  for the Bellefonds and De Chaulieus, and the aristocracy in general,  they entertained no doubt of his guilt; and finally, the magistrates  coming to the same opinion, Jacques Rollet was committed for trial,  and as a testimony of good will, Antoine de Chaulieu was selected by  the injured family to conduct the prosecution.    Here, at last, was the opportunity he had sighed for! So interesting  a case, too, furnishing such ample occasion for passion, pathos,  indignation! And how eminently fortunate that the speech which he set  himself with ardor to prepare, would be delivered in the presence  of the father and brother of his mistress, and perhaps of the lady  herself! The evidence against Jacques, it is true, was altogether  presumptive; there was no proof whatever that he had committed the  crime; and for his own part he stoutly denied it. But Antoine de  Chaulieu entertained no doubt of his guilt, and his speech was  certainly well calculated to carry that conviction into the bosom of  others. It was of the highest importance to his own reputation that he  should procure a verdict, and he confidently assured the afflicted and  enraged family of the victim that their vengeance should be satisfied.  Under these circumstances could anything be more unwelcome than a  piece of intelligence that was privately conveyed to him late on the  evening before the trial was to come on, which tended strongly to  exculpate the prisoner, without indicating any other person as the  criminal. Here was an opportunity lost. The first step of the ladder  on which he was to rise to fame, fortune, and a wife, was slipping  from under his feet!    Of course, so interesting a trial was anticipated with great eagerness  by the public, and the court was crowded with all the beauty and  fashion of Rouen. Though Jacques Rollet persisted in asserting his  innocence, founding his defense chiefly on circumstances which were  strongly corroborated by the information that had reached De Chaulieu  the preceding evening,--he was convicted.    In spite of the very strong doubts he privately entertained respecting  the justice of the verdict, even De Chaulieu himself, in the first  flush of success, amidst a crowd of congratulating friends, and the  approving smiles of his mistress, felt gratified and happy; his speech  had, for the time being, not only convinced others, but himself;  warmed with his own eloquence, he believed what he said. But when  the glow was over, and he found himself alone, he did not feel so  comfortable. A latent doubt of Rollet's guilt now burnt strongly in  his mind, and he felt that the blood of the innocent would be on his  head. It is true there was yet time to save the life of the prisoner,  but to admit Jacques innocent, was to take the glory out of his own  speech, and turn the sting of his argument against himself. Besides,  if he produced the witness who had secretly given him the information,  he should be self-condemned, for he could not conceal that he had been  aware of the circumstance before the trial.    Matters having gone so far, therefore, it was necessary that Jacques  Rollet should die; so the affair took its course; and early one  morning the guillotine was erected in the court-yard of the jail,  three criminals ascended the scaffold, and three heads fell into the  basket, which were presently afterward, with the trunks that had been  attached to them, buried in a corner of the cemetery.    Antoine de Chaulieu was now fairly started in his career, and his  success was as rapid as the first step toward it had been tardy. He  took a pretty apartment in the Hotel Marboeuf, Rue Grange-Bateliere,  and in a short time was looked upon as one of the most rising young  advocates in Paris. His success in one line brought him success in  another; he was soon a favorite in society, and an object of interest  to speculating mothers; but his affections still adhered to his old  love Natalie de Bellefonds, whose family now gave their assent to the  match--at least, prospectively--a circumstance which furnished such  an additional incentive to his exertions, that in about two years  from the date of his first brilliant speech, he was in a sufficiently  flourishing condition to offer the young lady a suitable home. In  anticipation of the happy event, he engaged and furnished a suite  of apartments in the Rue du Helder; and as it was necessary that the  bride should come to Paris to provide her trousseau, it was agreed  that the wedding should take place there, instead of at Bellefonds,  as had been first projected; an arrangement the more desirable, that  a press of business rendered Mons. de Chaulieu's absence from Paris  inconvenient.    Brides and bridegrooms in France, except of the very high classes,  are not much in the habit of making those honeymoon excursions so  universal in this country. A day spent in visiting Versailles or St.  Cloud, or even the public places of the city, is generally all that  precedes the settling down into the habits of daily life. In the  present instance St. Denis was selected, from the circumstance of  Natalie's having a younger sister at school there; and also because  she had a particular desire to see the Abbey.    The wedding was to take place on a Thursday; and on the Wednesday  evening, having spent some hours most agreeably with Natalie,  Antoine de Chaulieu returned to spend his last night in his bachelor  apartments. His wardrobe and other small possessions, had already been  packed up and sent to his future home; and there was nothing left  in his room now, but his new wedding suit, which he inspected with  considerable satisfaction before he undressed and lay down to sleep.  Sleep, however, was somewhat slow to visit him; and the clock had  struck one, before he closed his eyes. When he opened them again,  it was broad daylight; and his"]]]
