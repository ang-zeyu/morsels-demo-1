For now the pestilence fell  among the Athenians, and cut off the flower of their youth. Suffering  both in body and mind they raved against Pericles, just as people when  delirious with disease attack their fathers or their physicians. They  endeavored to ruin him, urged on by his personal enemies, who assured  them that he was the author of the plague, because he had brought all  the country people into the city, where they were compelled to live  during the heat of summer, crowded together in small rooms and stifling  tents, living an idle life too, and breathing foul air instead of the  pure country breeze to which they were accustomed. The cause of this,  they said, was the man who, when the war began, admitted the masses of  the country people into the city, and then made no use of them, but  allowed them to be penned up together like cattle, and transmit the  contagion from one to another, without devising any remedy or  alleviation of their sufferings.    Hoping to relieve them somewhat, and also to annoy the enemy, Pericles  manned a hundred and fifty ships, placed on board, besides the sailors,  many brave infantry and cavalry soldiers, and was about to put to sea.  The Athenians conceived great hopes, and the enemy no less terror from  so large an armament. When all was ready, and Pericles himself had just  embarked in his own trireme, an eclipse of the sun took place, producing  total darkness, and all men were terrified at so great a portent.  Pericles sailed with the fleet, but did nothing worthy of so great a  force. He besieged the sacred city of Epidaurus, but, although he had  great hopes of taking it, he failed on account of the plague, which  destroyed not only his own men, but every one who came in contact with  them. After this he again endeavored to encourage the Athenians, to whom  he had become an object of dislike. However, he did not succeed in  pacifying them, but they condemned him by a public vote to be general no  more, and to pay a fine which is stated at the lowest estimate to have  been fifteen talents, and at the highest fifty. This was carried,  according to Idomeneus, by Cleon, but, according to Theophrastus, by  Simmias; while Heraclides of Pontus says that it was effected by  Lacratides.    He soon regained his public position, for the people's outburst of anger  was quenched by the blow they had dealt him, just as a bee leaves its  sting in the wound; but his private affairs were in great distress and  disorder, as he had lost many of his relatives during the plague, while  others were estranged from him on political grounds. Yet he would not  yield, nor abate his firmness and constancy of spirit because of these  afflictions, but was not observed to weep or mourn, or attend the  funeral of any of his relations, until he lost Paralus, the last of his  legitimate offspring. Crushed by this blow, he tried in vain to keep up  his grand air of indifference, and when carrying a garland to lay upon  the corpse he was overpowered by his feelings, so as to burst into a  passion of tears and sobs, which he had never done before in his whole  life.    Athens made trial of her other generals and public men to conduct her  affairs, but none appeared to be of sufficient weight or reputation to  have such a charge intrusted to him. The city longed for Pericles, and  invited him again to lead its counsels and direct its armies; and he,  although dejected in spirits and living in seclusion in his own house,  was yet persuaded by Alcibiades and his other friends to resume the  direction of affairs.    After this it appears that Pericles was attacked by the plague, not  acutely or continuously, as in most cases, but in a slow wasting  fashion, exhibiting many varieties of symptoms, and gradually  undermining his strength. As he was now on his death-bed, the most  distinguished of the citizens and his surviving friends collected round  him and spoke admiringly of his nobleness and immense power, enumerating  also the number of his exploits, and the trophies which he had set up  for victories gained; for while in chief command he had won no less than  nine victories for Athens.    Events soon made the loss of Pericles felt and regretted by the  Athenians. Those who during his lifetime had complained that his power  completely threw them into the shade, when after his death they had made  trial of other orators and statesmen, were obliged to confess that with  all his arrogance no man ever was really more moderate, and that his  real mildness in dealing with men was as remarkable as his apparent  pride and assumption. His power, which had been so grudged and envied,  and called monarchy and despotism, now was proved to have been the  saving of the State; such an amount of corrupt dealing and wickedness  suddenly broke out in public affairs, which he before had crushed and  forced to hide itself, and so prevented its becoming incurable through  impunity and license.          GREAT PLAGUE AT ATHENS    B.C. 430    GEORGE GROTE      (Almost at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war, when the prosperity  of Athens had placed her at the height of her power and given her  unquestioned supremacy among the Grecian states, her strength was  greatly impaired by a visitation against which there was nothing in  military prowess or patriotic pride and devotion that could prevail.    It is one of the tragic contrasts of history--the picture of Athens, in  her full triumph and glory, smitten, at a moment when she needed to put  forth her full strength, by a deadly foe against whose might mortal arms  were vain. Her citizens were rejoicing in her social no less than her  military preeminence, and they had already been trained in the hardships  necessary to be endured in defence of an invaded country. Again they  were prepared to undergo whatever service might be laid upon them in her  behalf. They could foresee the arduous tasks and inevitable sufferings  of a great war, but had no warning of an impending calamity far worse  than those which even war, though always attended with horrors, usually  entails. Pericles had lately delivered his great funeral oration at the  public interment of soldiers who had fallen for Athens. \"The bright  colors and tone of cheerful confidence,\" says Grote, whose account of  the plague follows, \"which pervaded the discourse of Pericles, appear  the more striking from being in immediate antecedence to the awful  description of this distemper.\"    The death of Pericles himself, who directly or indirectly fell a victim  to the prevailing pestilence, marked a grievous crisis for Athens in  what was already become a measureless public woe. During the autumn of  the year B.C. 427 the epidemic again broke out, after a considerable  intermission, and for one year continued, \"to the sad ruin both of the  strength and the comfort of the city.\")      At the close of one year after the attempted surprise of Plataea by the  Thebans, the belligerent parties in Greece remained in an unaltered  position as to relative strength. Nothing decisive had been accomplished  on either side, either by the invasion of Attica or by the flying  descents round the coast of Peloponnesus. In spite of mutual damage  inflicted--doubtless in the greatest measure upon Attica--no progress  was yet made toward the fulfilment of those objects which had induced  the Peloponnesians to go to war. Especially the most pressing among all  their wishes--the relief of Potidaea--was in no way advanced; for the  Athenians had not found it necessary to relax the blockade of that city,  The result of the first year's operations had thus been to disappoint  the hopes of the Corinthians and the other ardent instigators of war,  while it justified the anticipations both of Pericles and of Archidamus.    A second devastation of Attica was resolved upon for the commencement of  spring; and measures were taken for carrying it all over that territory,  since the settled policy of Athens, not to hazard a battle with the  invaders, was now ascertained. About the end of March or beginning of  April the entire Peloponnesian force--two-thirds from each confederate  city as before--was assembled under the command of Archidamus and  marched into Attica. This time they carried the work of systematic  destruction not merely over the Thriasian plain and the plain  immediately near to Athens, as before; but also to the more southerly  portions of Attica, down even as far as the mines of Laurium. They  traversed and ravaged both the eastern and the western coast, remaining  not less than forty days in the country. They found the territory  deserted as before, all the population having retired within the walls.    In regard to this second invasion, Pericles recommended the same  defensive policy as he had applied to the first; and apparently the  citizens had now come to acquiesce in it, if not willingly, at least  with a full conviction of its necessity. But a new visitation had now  occurred, diverting their attention from the invader, though enormously  aggravating their sufferings. A few days after Archidamus entered  Attica, a pestilence or epidemic sickness broke out unexpectedly at  Athens.    It appears that this terrific disorder had been raging for some time  throughout the regions round the Mediterranean; having begun, as was  believed, in Ethiopia--thence passing into Egypt and Libya, and  overrunning a considerable portion of Asia under the Persian government.  About sixteen years before, there had been a similar calamity in Rome  and in various parts of Italy. Recently it had been felt in Lemnos and  some other islands of the Aegean, yet seemingly not with such intensity  as to excite much notice"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10136"],[0,"The Book of Household Management (#11)"],[1,"of practising economy  should be evident to every one, whether in the possession of an income  no more than sufficient for a family's requirements, or of a large  fortune, which puts financial adversity out of the question. We must  always remember that it is a great merit in housekeeping to manage a  little well. \"He is a good waggoner,\" says Bishop Hall, \"that can turn  in a little room. To live well in abundance is the praise of the estate,  not of the person. I will study more how to give a good account of my  little, than how to make it more.\" In this there is true wisdom, and it  may be added, that those who can manage a little well, are most likely  to succeed in their management of larger matters. Economy and frugality  must never, however, be allowed to degenerate into parsimony and  meanness.    6. THE CHOICE OF ACQUAINTANCES is very important to the happiness of a  mistress and her family. A gossiping acquaintance, who indulges in the  scandal and ridicule of her neighbours, should be avoided as a  pestilence. It is likewise all-necessary to beware, as Thomson sings,                                     \"The whisper'd tale,    That, like the fabling Nile, no fountain knows;--    Fair-laced Deceit, whose wily, conscious aye    Ne'er looks direct; the tongue that licks the dust    But, when it safely dares, as prompt to sting.\"    If the duties of a family do not sufficiently occupy the time of a  mistress, society should be formed of such a kind as will tend to the  mutual interchange of general and interesting information.    7. FRIENDSHIPS SHOULD NOT BE HASTILY FORMED, nor the heart given, at  once, to every new-comer. There are ladies who uniformly smile at, and  approve everything and everybody, and who possess neither the courage to  reprehend vice, nor the generous warmth to defend virtue. The friendship  of such persons is without attachment, and their love without affection  or even preference. They imagine that every one who has any penetration  is ill-natured, and look coldly on a discriminating judgment. It should  be remembered, however, that this discernment does not always proceed  from an uncharitable temper, but that those who possess a long  experience and thorough knowledge of the world, scrutinize the conduct  and dispositions of people before they trust themselves to the first  fair appearances. Addison, who was not deficient in a knowledge of  mankind, observes that \"a friendship, which makes the least noise, is  very often the most useful; for which reason, I should prefer a prudent  friend to a zealous one.\" And Joanna Baillie tells us that      \"Friendship is no plant of hasty growth,     Though planted in esteem's deep-fixed soil,     The gradual culture of kind intercourse     Must bring it to perfection.\"    8. HOSPITALITY IS A MOST EXCELLENT VIRTUE; but care must be taken that  the love of company, for its own sake, does not become a prevailing  passion; for then the habit is no longer hospitality, but dissipation.  Reality and truthfulness in this, as in all other duties of life, are  the points to be studied; for, as Washington Irving well says, \"There is  an emanation from the heart in genuine hospitality, which cannot be  described, but is immediately felt, and puts the stranger at once at his  ease.\" With respect to the continuance of friendships, however, it may  be found necessary, in some cases, for a mistress to relinquish, on  assuming the responsibility of a household, many of those commenced in  the earlier part of her life. This will be the more requisite, if the  number still retained be quite equal to her means and opportunities.    9. IN CONVERSATION, TRIFLING OCCURRENCES, such as small disappointments,  petty annoyances, and other every-day incidents, should never be  mentioned to your friends. The extreme injudiciousness of repeating  these will be at once apparent, when we reflect on the unsatisfactory  discussions which they too frequently occasion, and on the load of  advice which they are the cause of being tendered, and which is, too  often, of a kind neither to be useful nor agreeable. Greater events,  whether of joy or sorrow, should be communicated to friends; and, on  such occasions, their sympathy gratifies and comforts. If the mistress  be a wife, never let an account of her husband's failings pass her lips;  and in cultivating the power of conversation, she should keep the  versified advice of Cowper continually in her memory, that it      \"Should flow like water after summer showers,     Not as if raised by mere mechanic powers.\"    In reference to its style, Dr. Johnson, who was himself greatly  distinguished for his colloquial abilities, says that \"no style is more  extensively acceptable than the narrative, because this does not carry  an air of superiority over the rest of the company; and, therefore, is  most likely to please them. For this purpose we should store our memory  with short anecdotes and entertaining pieces of history. Almost every  one listens with eagerness to extemporary history. Vanity often  co-operates with curiosity; for he that is a hearer in one place wishes  to qualify himself to be a principal speaker in some inferior company;  and therefore more attention is given to narrations than anything else  in conversation. It is true, indeed, that sallies of wit and quick  replies are very pleasing in conversation; but they frequently tend to  raise envy in some of the company: but the narrative way neither raises  this, nor any other evil passion, but keeps all the company nearly upon  an equality, and, if judiciously managed, will at once entertain and  improve them all.\"    10. GOOD TEMPER SHOULD BE CULTIVATED by every mistress, as upon it the  welfare of the household may be said to turn; indeed, its influence can  hardly be over-estimated, as it has the effect of moulding the  characters of those around her, and of acting most beneficially on the  happiness of the domestic circle. Every head of a household should  strive to be cheerful, and should never fail to show a deep interest in  all that appertains to the well-being of those who claim the protection  of her roof. Gentleness, not partial and temporary, but universal and  regular, should pervade her conduct; for where such a spirit is  habitually manifested, it not only delights her children, but makes her  domestics attentive and respectful; her visitors are also pleased by it,  and their happiness is increased.    11. ON THE IMPORTANT SUBJECT OF DRESS AND FASHION we cannot do better  than quote an opinion from the eighth volume of the \"Englishwoman's  Domestic Magazine.\" The writer there says, \"Let people write, talk,  lecture, satirize, as they may, it cannot be denied that, whatever is  the prevailing mode in attire, let it intrinsically be ever so absurd,  it will never _look_ as ridiculous as another, or as any other, which,  however convenient, comfortable, or even becoming, is totally opposite  in style to that generally worn.\"    12. IN PURCHASING ARTICLES OF WEARING APPAREL, whether it be a silk  dress, a bonnet, shawl, or riband, it is well for the buyer to consider  three things: I. That it be not too expensive for her purse. II. That  its colour harmonize with her complexion, and its size and pattern with  her figure. III. That its tint allow of its being worn with the other  garments she possesses. The quaint Fuller observes, that the good wife  is none of our dainty dames, who love to appear in a variety of suits  every day new, as if a gown, like a stratagem in war, were to be used  but once. But our good wife sets up a sail according to the keel of her  husband's estate; and, if of high parentage, she doth not so remember  what she was by birth, that she forgets what she is by match.        To _Brunettes_, or those ladies having dark complexions, silks      of a grave hue are adapted. For _Blondes_, or those having fair      complexions, lighter colours are preferable, as the richer,      deeper hues are too overpowering for the latter. The colours      which go best together are green with violet; gold-colour with      dark crimson or lilac; pale blue with scarlet; pink with black      or white; and gray with scarlet or pink. A cold colour generally      requires a warm tint to give life to it. Gray and pale blue, for      instance, do not combine well, both being cold colours.    13. THE DRESS OF THE MISTRESS should always be adapted to her  circumstances, and be varied with different occasions. Thus, at  breakfast she should be attired in a very neat and simple manner,  wearing no ornaments. If this dress should decidedly pertain only to the  breakfast-hour, and be specially suited for such domestic occupations as  usually follow that meal, then it would be well to exchange it before  the time for receiving visitors, if the mistress be in the habit of  doing so. It is still to be remembered, however, that, in changing the  dress, jewellery and ornaments are not to be worn until the full dress  for dinner is assumed. Further information and hints on the subject of  the toilet will appear under the department of the \"LADY'S-MAID.\"        The advice of Polonius to his son Laertes, in Shakspeare's      tragedy of \"Hamlet,\" is most excellent; and although given to      one of the male sex, will equally apply to a \"fayre ladye:\"--      \"Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,     But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;     For the apparel oft proclaims the man.\"    14. CHARITY AND BENEVOLENCE ARE DUTIES which a mistress owes to herself  as well as to her fellow-creatures; and there is scarcely any income so  small, but something may be spared from it, even if it be but \"the  widow's mite.\" It is to be always remembered, however, that it is the  _spirit_ of charity which imparts to the gift a value far beyond its  actual amount, and is by far its better part.      True Charity, a plant divinely nursed,    Fed by the love from which it"]]]
