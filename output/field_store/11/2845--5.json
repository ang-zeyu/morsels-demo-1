When by the art of the Painter or Poet a train of ideas is suggested  to our imaginations, which interests us so much by the pain or pleasure  it affords, that we cease to attend to the irritations of common external  objects, and cease also to use any voluntary efforts to compare these  interesting trains of ideas with our previous knowledge of things, a  compleat reverie is produced: during which time, however short, if it be  but for a moment, the objects themselves appear to exist before us. This,  I think, has been called by an ingenious critic \"the ideal presence\" of  such objects. (Elements of Criticism by Lord Kaimes). And in respect to  the compliment intended by Mr. Fielding to Mr. Garrick, it would seem  that an ignorant Rustic at the play of Hamlet, who has some previous  belief in the appearance of Ghosts, would sooner be liable to fall into  reverie, and continue in it longer, than one who possessed more knowledge  of the real nature of things, and had a greater facility of  exercising his reason.    _B_. It must require great art in the Painter or Poet to produce this  kind of deception?    _P_. The matter must be interesting from its sublimity, beauty, or  novelty; this is the scientific part; and the art consists in bringing  these distinctly before the eye, so as to produce (as above-mentioned)  the ideal presence of the object, in which the great Shakespear  particularly excells.    _B_. Then it is not of any consequence whether the representations  correspond with nature?    _P_. Not if they so much interest the reader or spectator as to induce  the reverie above described. Nature may be seen in the market-place,  or at the card-table; but we expect something more than this in the  play-house or picture-room. The further the artists recedes from nature,  the greater novelty he is likely to produce; if he rises above nature,  he produces the sublime; and beauty is probably a selection and new  combination of her most agreeable parts. Yourself will be sensible of the  truth of this doctrine by recollecting over in your mind the works of  three of our celebrated artists. Sir Joshua Reynolds has introduced  sublimity even into its portraits;  we admire the representation of  persons, whose reality we should have passed by unnoticed. Mrs. Angelica  Kauffman attracts our eyes with beauty, which I suppose no where exists;  certainly few Grecian faces are seen in this country. And the daring  pencil of Fuseli transports us beyond the boundaries of nature, and  ravishes us with the charm of the most interesting novelty. And  Shakespear, who excells in all these together, so far captivates the  spectator, as to make him unmindful of every kind of violation of Time,  Place, or Existence. As at the first appearance of the Ghost of Hamlet,  \"his ear must be dull as the fat weed, which roots itself on Lethe's  brink,\" who can attend to the improbablity of the exhibition. So in many  scenes of the Tempest we perpetually believe the action passing before  our eyes, and relapse with somewhat of distaste into common life at the  intervals of the representation.    _B_. I suppose a poet of less ability would find such great machinery  difficult and cumbersome to manage?    _P_. Just so, we should be mocked at the apparent improbabilities. As in  the gardens of a Scicilian nobleman, described in Mr. Brydone's and in  Mr. Swinburn's travels, there are said to be six hundred statues of  imaginary monsters, which so disgust the spectators, that the state had  once a serious design of destroying them; and yet the very improbable  monsters in Ovid's Metamorphoses have entertained the world for many  centuries.    _B._ The monsters in your Botanic Garden, I hope, are of the latter kind?    _P._ The candid reader must determine.

[_Carlina._ l. 7. Carline Thistle. Of the class Confederate Males. The  seeds of this and of many other plants of the same class are furnished  with a plume, by which admirable mechanism they perform long aerial  journeys, crossing lakes and deserts, and are thus disseminated far from  the original plant, and have much the appearance of a Shuttlecock as they  fly. The wings are of different construction, some being like a divergent  tuft of hairs, others are branched like feathers, some are elevated from  the crown of the seed by a slender foot-stalk, which gives, than a very  elegant appearance, others sit immediately on the crown of the seed.    Nature has many other curious vegetable contrivances for the dispersion  of seeds: see note on Helianthus. But perhaps none of them has more the  appearance of design than the admirable apparatus of Tillandsia for this  purpose. This plant grows on the branches of trees, like the misleto, and  never on the ground; the seeds are furnished with many long threads on  their crowns; which, as they are driven forwards by the winds, wrap round  the arms of trees, and thus hold them fast till they vegetate.

Branches, like the Rose, that go on  growing all summer grow indefinitely.    The bud-scale scar is quite different from the other trees which we have  examined. It is not composed of definite rings, but of leaf-scars with  long ridges running from each side of them, showing the scales to be  modified stipules. The leaf-scars have become somewhat separated by the  growth of the internodes. In the Beech, there are eight, or more, pairs of  scales with no leaves, so that the internodes do not develop, and a ring  is left on the branch.    The flower-cluster leaves a concave, semicircular scar, in the leaf-axil.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Balm-of-Gilead. 1. Branch in winter state: _a_,  leaf-scar; _b_, bud-scar. 2. Branch, with leaf-buds expanded. 3. Branch,  with catkin appearing from the bud.]    The terminal buds are the strongest and not very many axillary buds  develop, so that the tree has not fine spray.    The leaf-arrangement is alternate, on the 2/5 plan. Phyllotaxy is not yet  to be taken up, but the pupils should be shown the different angles of the  branching of the twigs, and told to compare them with Beech and Elm.    QUESTIONS ON THE BALM OF GILEAD.    In which buds are the flower-clusters?    Are there flowers and leaves in the same buds?    What are the scales of the bud?    How are the leaves folded in the bud?    How do the axillary and terminal buds differ?    What are the dots on the leaf-scars?    Why is there no distinct band of rings as in Beech?    How old is your branch?    Where do you look for flower-cluster scars?    Which buds are the strongest?    How does this affect the appearance of the tree?    What makes the ends of the branches so rough?    Compare the arrangement of the twigs and branches with Beech and Elm, with  Horsechestnut and Lilac.      TULIP-TREE (_Liriodendron Tulipifera_).    The buds are small, flat, and rounded at the apex. They are sheathed by  scales, each leaf being covered by a pair, whose edges cohere. The outer  pair are brown and are the stipules of the last leaf of the preceding  year. The leaves are conduplicate, as in Magnolia, and have the blade bent  inwards on the petiole (_inflexed_). Their shape is very clearly to be  seen, and no bud is more interesting in the closeness of its packing.  Axillary buds are often found within. The flowers grow high upon the trees  and towards the ends of the branches.    The leaf-scars are round with many dots. The scar of the stipules is a  continuous line around the stem, as in Magnolia.      CHERRY _(Prunus Cerasus_).    The leaf-buds are terminal, or in the axils of the upper leaves of the  preceding year; the flower buds are axillary. There is but one bud in each  axil, and usually two or three flowers in each bud, but the leaves on  the twigs are crowded and the flowers therefore appear in clusters. The  blossom-buds are larger and more rounded than the leaf-buds.    The buds of the tree develop very easily in the house, and as they are  so small they can be better studied in watching them come out, than by  attempting to dissect them, unless the scholars are sufficiently advanced  to use the microscope easily. It is always bad for a pupil to attempt to  describe what he sees but imperfectly. He will be sure to jump at any  conclusions which he thinks ought to be correct.    The leaf-scars are semicircular, small and swollen.    The bud-rings are plain. The twigs make a very small growth in a season,  so that the leaf-scars and rings make them exceedingly rough.    The flower-cluster scars are small circles, with a dot in the centre, in  the leaf-axils. The flowers come before the leaves.    The leaf-arrangement is alternate on the 2/5 plan. The pupils may compare  the branching with that of their other specimens.      RED MAPLE (_Acer rubrum_).    This is a good specimen for the study of accessory buds. There is usually  a bud in the axil of each lower scale of the axillary buds, making three  side by side. We have already noticed this as occurring sometimes in  Lilac. It is habitually the case with the Red Maple. The middle bud, which  is smaller and develops later, is a leaf-bud. The others are flower-buds.    The leaf-scars are small, with three dots on each scar. The rings are very  plain. The flower-cluster leaves a round scar in the leaf-axil, as in  Cherry.    The leaves are opposite and the tree branches freely. The twigs seem to  be found just below the bud-rings, as the upper leaf-buds usually develop  best and the lower buds are single, containing flowers only.      NORWAY SPRUCE (_Picea excelsa_).    The buds are terminal, and axillary, from the axils of the leaves of the  preceding year, usually from those at the ends of the branchlets. They  are covered with brown scales and contain many leaves.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Branch of Cherry in winter state: _a_, leaf-scar;  _b_, bud-scar; _c_, flower-scar.]    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Branch of Red Maple in winter state (reduced). 2.  Flower-buds]    The leaves are needle-shaped and short.[1] They are arranged densely on  the branches, alternately on the 8/21 plan (see section on phyllotaxy).  When they drop off they leave a hard, blunt projection which makes the  stem very rough. As the terminal bud always develops unless injured, the  tree is excurrent, forming a straight trunk, throwing out branches on  every side. The axillary buds develop near the ends of the branchlets,  forming apparent whorls of branches around the trunk. In the smaller  branches, as the tree grows older, the tendency is for only two buds to  develop nearly opposite each other, forming a symmetrical branch.    [Footnote 1: The pupils should observe how much more crowded the leaves  are than in the other trees they have studied. The leaves being smaller,  it is necessary to have more of them. Large-leaved trees have longer  internodes than those with small leaves.]    The bud-scales are persistent on the branches and the growth from year to  year can be traced a long way back.    The cones hang on the ends of the upper branches. They are much larger  than in our native species of Black and White Spruce.    The Evergreens are a very interesting study and an excellent exercise in  morphology for the older scholars.      2. _Vernation_. This term signifies the disposition of leaves in the bud,  either in respect to the way in which each leaf is folded, or to the  manner in which the leaves are arranged with reference to each other.  The pupils have described the folding of the leaves in some of their  specimens.    In the Beech, the leaf is _plicate_, or plaited on the veins. In the Elm,  Magnolia, and Tulip-tree, it is _conduplicate_, that is, folded on  the midrib with the inner face within. In the Tulip-tree, it is also  _inflexed_, the blade bent forwards on the petiole. In the Balm of Gilead,  the leaf is _involute_, rolled towards the midrib on the upper face.    Other kinds of vernation are _revolute_, the opposite of involute, where  the leaf is rolled backwards towards the midrib; _circinate_, rolled from  the apex downwards, as we see in ferns; and _corrugate_, when the leaf is  crumpled in the bud.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Branch of Norway Spruce.]    In all the trees we have studied, the leaves simply succeed each other,  each leaf, or pair of leaves, overlapping the next in order. The names of  the overlapping of the leaves among themselves, _imbricated, convolute,  etc_., will not be treated here, as they are not needed. They will come  under _aestivation_, the term used to describe the overlapping of the  modified leaves, which make up the flower.[1]    [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. VIII. Young and Old Leaves.]      3. _Phyllotaxy_. The subject of leaf-arrangement is an extremely difficult  one, and it is best, even with the older pupils, to touch it lightly. The  point to be especially brought out is the disposition of the leaves so  that each can get the benefit of the light. This can be seen in any plant  and there are many ways in which the desired result is brought about. The  chief way is the distribution of the leaves about the stem, and this is  well studied from the leaf-scars.    The scholars should keep the branches they have studied. It is well to  have them marked with the respective names, that the teacher may examine  and return them without fear of mistakes.    In the various branches that the pupils have studied, they have seen that  the arrangement of the leaves differs greatly. The arrangement of leaves  is usually classed under three modes: the _alternate_, the _opposite_,  and the _whorled_; but the opposite is the simplest form of the whorled  arrangement, the leaves being in circles of two. In this arrangement, the  leaves of each whorl stand over the spaces of the whorl just below. The  pupils have observed and noted this in Horsechestnut and Lilac. In these  there are four vertical rows or ranks of leaves. In whorls of three leaves  there would be six ranks, in whorls of four, eight, and so on.    When the leaves are alternate, or single at each node of the stem, they  are arranged in many different ways. Ask the pupils to look at all the  branches with alternate leaves that they have studied, and determine in  each case what leaves stand directly over each other. That is, beginning  with any leaf, count the number of leaves passed on the stem, till one is  reached that stands directly over the first.[1] In the Beech and the Elm  the leaves are on opposite sides of the stem, so that the third stands  directly over the first. This makes two vertical ranks, or rows, of  leaves, dividing the circle into halves. It is, therefore, called the  1/2 arrangement. Another way of expressing it is to say that the angular  divergence between the leaves is 180 deg., or one-half the circumference.    [Footnote 1: The pupils must be careful not to pass the bud-rings when  they are counting the leaves.]    The "]]]
