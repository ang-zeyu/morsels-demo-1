[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8220"],[0,"Remarks (#10)"],[1,"Franklin's other scientific experiments were productive  of more lasting benefit to mankind than this, but I do not agree with  them.    This paper was called the _New England Courant_. It was edited jointly by  James and Benjamin Franklin, and was started to supply a long-felt want.  Benjamin edited a part of the time and James a part of the time. The idea  of having two editors was not for the purpose of giving volume to the  editorial page, but it was necessary for one to run the paper while the  other was in jail. In those days you couldn't sass the king, and then,  when the king came in the office the next day and stopped his paper, and  took out his ad., you couldn't put it off on \"our informant\" and go right  along with the paper. You had to go to jail, while your subscribers  wondered why their paper did not come, and the paste soured in the tin  dippers in the sanctum, and the circus passed by on the other side.    [Illustration: STOPPING HIS PAPER.]    How many of us to-day, fellow journalists, would be willing to stay in  jail while the lawn festival and the kangaroo came and went? Who, of all  our company, would go to a prison cell for the cause of freedom while a  double-column ad. of sixteen aggregated circuses, and eleven congresses of  ferocious beasts, fierce and fragrant from their native lair, went by us?    At the age of 17, Ben got disgusted with his brother, and went to  Philadelphia and New York, where he got a chance to \"sub\" for a few weeks,  and then got a regular \"sit.\" Franklin was a good printer, and finally got  to be a foreman. He made an excellent foreman, sitting by the hour in the  composing room and spitting on the stone, while he cussed the make-up and  press work of the other papers. Then he would go into the editorial rooms  and scare the editors to death with a wild shriek for more copy. He knew  just how to conduct himself as a foreman, so that strangers would think he  owned the paper.    In 1730, at the age of 24, Franklin married and established the  _Pennsylvania Gazette_. He was then regarded as a great man, and most  everyone took his paper. Franklin grew to be a great journalist, and  spelled hard words with great fluency. He never tried to be a humorist in  any of his newspaper work, and everybody respected him.    Along about 1746 he began to study the construction and habits of  lightning, and inserted a local in his paper, in which he said that he  would be obliged to any of his readers who might notice any new or odd  specimens of lightning, if they would send them into the _Gazette_ office  by express for examination. Every time there was a thunder storm, Franklin  would tell the foreman to edit the paper, and, armed with a string and an  old fruit jar, he would go out on the hills and get enough lightning for a  mess.    [Illustration: \"HOW'S TRADE?\"]    In 1753 Franklin was made postmaster-general of the colonies. He made a  good postmaster-general, and people say there were less mistakes in  distributing their mail than there has ever been since. If a man mailed a  letter in those days, old Ben Franklin saw that it went where it was  addressed.    Franklin frequently went over to England in those days, partly on  business, and partly to shock the king. He used to delight in going to the  castle with his breeches tucked in his boots, figuratively speaking, and  attract a good deal of attention. It looked odd to the English, of course,  to see him come into the royal presence, and, leaving his wet umbrella up  against the throne, ask the king: \"How's trade?\" Franklin never put on any  frills, but he was not afraid of a crowned head. He used to say,  frequently, that to him a king was no more than a seven spot.    He did his best to prevent the Revolutionary war, but he couldn't do it,  Patrick Henry had said that the war was inevitable, and given it  permission to come, and it came. He also went to Paris and got acquainted  with a few crowned heads there. They thought a good deal of him in Paris,  and offered him a corner lot if he would build there and start a paper.  They also promised him the county printing, but he said no, he would have  to go back to America, or his wife might get uneasy about him.    Franklin wrote \"Poor Richard's Almanac\" in 1732-57, and it was republished  in England. Benjamin Franklin had but one son, and his name was William.  William was an illegitimate son, and, though he lived to be quite an old  man, he never got over it entirely, but continued to be but an  illegitimate son all his life. Everybody urged him to do differently, but  he steadily refused to do so.          Life Insurance as a Health Restorer.    Life insurance is a great thing. I would not be without it. My health is  greatly improved since I got my new policy. Formerly I used to have a  seal-brown taste in my mouth when I arose in the morning, but that has  entirely disappeared. I am more hopeful and happy, and my hair is getting  thicker on top. I would not try to keep house without life insurance. Last  September I was caught in one of the most destructive cyclones that ever  visited a republican form of government. A great deal of property was  destroyed and many lives were lost, but I was spared. People who had no  insurance were mowed down on every hand, but aside from a broken leg I was  entirely unharmed.    [Illustration: PROTECTED BY LIFE INSURANCE.]    I look upon life insurance as a great comfort, not only to the  beneficiary, but to the insured, who very rarely lives to realize anything  pecuniarily from his venture. Twice I have almost raised my wife to  affluence and cast a gloom over the community in which I lived, but  something happened to the physician for a few days so that he could not  attend to me, and I recovered. For nearly two years I was under the  doctor's care. He had his finger on my pulse or in my pocket all the time.  He was a young western physician, who attended me on Tuesdays and Fridays.  The rest of the week he devoted his medical skill to horses that were  mentally broken down. He said he attended me largely for my society. I  felt flattered to know that he enjoyed my society after he had been thrown  among horses all the week that had much greater advantages than I.    My wife at first objected seriously to an insurance on my life, and said  she would never, never touch a dollar of the money if I were to die, but  after I had been sick nearly two years, and my disposition had suffered a  good deal, she said that I need not delay the obsequies on that account.  But the life insurance slipped through my fingers somehow, and I  recovered.    In these days of dynamite and roller rinks, and the gory meat-ax of a new  administration, we ought to make some provision for the future.          The Opium Habit.    I have always had a horror of opiates of all kinds. They are so seductive  and so still in their operations. They steal through the blood like a wolf  on the trail, and they seize upon the heart at last with their white fangs  till it is still forever.    Up the Laramie there is a cluster of ranches at the base of the Medicine  Bow, near the north end of Sheep Mountain, and in sight of the glittering,  eternal frost of the snowy range. These ranches are the homes of the young  men from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Ohio, and now there are several  \"younger sons\" of Old England, with herds of horses, steers and sheep,  worth millions of dollars. These young men are not of the kind of whom the  metropolitan ass writes as saying \"youbetcherlife,\" and calling everybody  \"pardner.\" They are many of them college graduates, who can brand a wild  Maverick or furnish the easy gestures for a Strauss waltz.    They wear human clothes, talk in the United States language, and have a  bank account. This spring they may be wearing chaparajos and swinging a  quirt through the thin air, and in July they may be at Long Branch, or  coloring a meerschaum pipe among the Alps.    Well, a young man whom we will call Curtis lived at one of these ranches  years ago, and, though a quiet, mind-your-own-business fellow, who had  absolutely no enemies among his companions, he had the misfortune to incur  the wrath of a tramp sheep-herder, who waylaid Curtis one afternoon and  shot him dead as he sat in his buggy. Curtis wasn't armed. He didn't dream  of trouble till he drove home from town, and, as he passed through the  gates of a corral, saw the hairy face of the herder, and at the same  moment the flash of a Winchester rifle. That was all.    A rancher came into town and telegraphed to Curtis' father, and then a  half dozen citizens went out to help capture the herder, who had fled to  the sage brush of the foot-hills.    They didn't get back till toward daybreak, but they brought the herder  with them, I saw him in the gray of the morning, lying in a coarse gray  blanket, on the floor of the engine house. He was dead.    I asked, as a reporter, how he came to his death, and they told me--opium!  I said, did I understand you to say \"ropium?\" They said no, it was opium.  The murderer had taken poison when he found that escape was impossible.    I was present at the inquest, so that I could report the case. There was  very little testimony, but all the evidence seemed to point to the fact  that life was extinct, and a verdict of death by his own hand was  rendered.    It was the first opium work I had ever seen, and it aroused my curiosity.  Death by opium, it seems, leaves a dark purple ring around the neck. I did  not know this before. People who die by opium also tie their hands  together before they die. This is one of the eccentricities of opium  poisoning that I have never seen laid down in the books. I bequeath it to  medical science. Whenever I run up against a new scientific discovery, I  just hand it right over to the public without cost.    Ever since the above incident, I have been very apprehensive about people  who seem to be likely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8299"],[0,"Filipino Popular Tales (#10)"],[1,"its appearance in one hundred and  eighty-three Western and Eastern stories. As Panzer has shown (p. 77)  that the mistreatment of the companions by the demon in the woods  usually takes place while the one left behind is cooking food for the  others out on the hunt, this motif might more exactly be called the  \"interrupted-cooking\" episode than \"Der Daemon im Waldhaus\" (Panzer's  name for it). For Mexican and American Indian variants, see JAFL 25  : 244-254, 255. Spanish and Hindoo versions are cited by Bolte and  Polivka (2 : 305, 314).    It is pretty clear that the episode as narrated in our stories 3 and  4 owes nothing to the Spanish variants mentioned by Bolte.    F2-5 The removal of an enormous stone is a task that Carancal has  to perform twice. This exhibition of superhuman strength is of a  piece with the strong hero's other exploits, and has nothing in  common with the transplanting of mountains by means of magic. (F3)  The removal of a monstrous decaying fish is found in b as well as in  3. Cabagboc catches up the fish on the end of his sword, and hurls  the carcass into the middle of the ocean. These exploits of the  rock and the fish are not unlike the feat of the Santal hero Gumda,  who throws the king's elephant over seven seas (Campbell, 59). (F4)  In b the task of slaying the man-eating giant falls upon Cabagboc,  and his companion Uprooter, as the other comrade, Breaker, has been  married to the king's daughter. The giants are finally despatched  by the hero, who cuts off their heads with his sword. In g the two  strong men Paridis and Aolo are about to be slain by the man-eating  giant against whom they have been sent by the hero to fight, when the  hero suddenly appears and cuts off the monster's head with his mighty  bolo. (F5) The killing of a seven-headed dragon is a commonplace in  folk-tales; a seven-headed man is not so usual. Cabagboc, after both  of his comrades have been given royal wives, journeys alone. He comes  to a river guarded by a seven-headed man who proves invulnerable for  a whole day. Then a mysterious voice tells the hero to strike the  monster in the middle of the forehead, as this is the only place in  which it can be mortally wounded. Cabagboc does so and conquers. (F6)  The hero's wagering his strong men against a king's strong men will  be discussed in the notes to No. 11. The task of Pusong (a) has not  been mentioned yet. After Pusong leaves home, he journeys by himself,  and finally comes to a place where the inhabitants are feverishly  building fortifications against the Moros, who are threatening the  island. By lending his phenomenal strength, Pusong enables the people  to finish their forts in one night. Out of gratitude they later make  him their leader. Months later, when the Moros make their raid, they  are defeated by Pusong, and captured with all their slaves. Among the  wounded slaves are the parents of Pusong. On recognizing their son,  they instantly die of shame for their past cruelty to him. Nor can  the hero bear the shock any better than they: he too falls dead.    ADDITIONAL NOTES.--The three weeks' swim in 3 suggests Beowulf's  swim of a week and his fight with the sea-monsters (Beowulf 535  ff.). The mistaking of a monster fish for an island seems to be an  Oriental notion. It occurs in the \"1001 Nights\" (\"First Voyage of  Sindbad the Sailor;\" see Lane's note 8 to this story).    G The denouement. Cabagboc finally reaches home, and spends the  rest of his life with his parents (b); Sandapal (c) is bought by the  king, and amuses the court lords and ladies by his feats of strength;  Sandangcal (d) distributes ten billion pesos among his three helpers,  and lives the rest of his days feasting on carabao-livers; Greedy  Juan (e) comes back home with a magic money-producing goat, which he  leaves to his parents, while he by chance finds a wonderful house in  the forest with plenty to eat, and there he remains; Juan Tapon (f)  joins the king's army to fight a neighboring monarch; Dangandangan  (g) becomes a general in the king's army; Tangarangan (h) performs  marvellous deeds abroad, but never returns home again.      Two other variants remain to be noticed briefly. One of these I have  only in abstract, the other is avowedly a confusion of two stories  by the narrator. Both are Ilocano tales. The hero's name in both is  Kakarangkang (from kaka, a term of respect given to either a senior  or a junior; and dangkang, \"a span\"). In both, the hero is a great  eater and prodigiously strong. The only adventure of Kakarangkang  recorded in the abstract is an adventure with a crocodile. Kakarangkang  goes fishing and hooks a crocodile; but, while trying to draw it to  shore, he is thrown into the air, falls into the reptile's mouth,  and is swallowed. He manages, however, to cut his way out. In the  other story, besides some incidents properly belonging to the story  of \"The Monkey and the Turtle\" (cf. also 4 [b]), we find this same  adventure with the crocodile, the slaying of a seven-headed giant  (F5), and the removal of an enormous decaying fish (F3). The diminutive  hero receives the hand of the king's daughter in return for this last  service,--an honor which the heroes of our other versions decline. The  incident of the small hero being swallowed by an animal and ultimately  emerging into the light of day alive, at once suggests Tom Thumb's  adventure in the cow and the wolf. For \"swallow\" tales in general,  see Macculloch, 47-51; Bolte-Polivka, 1 : 395-398; Cosquin, 2 :  150-155. The combination of the \"interrupted-cooking\"  episode (F1),  which properly belongs to the \"John the Bear\" cycle, with motifs from  \"The Monkey and the Turtle\" and \"The Monkey and the Crocodile\" stories,  will be discussed in the notes to Nos. 4, 55, and 56.        TALE 4    SUAC AND HIS ADVENTURES.      Narrated by Anastacia Villegas of Arayat, Pampanga, who heard the  story from her grandmother.      Once upon a time, in a certain town in Pampanga, there lived a boy  named Suac. In order to try his fortune, one day he went a-hunting with  Sunga and Sacu in Mount Telapayong. When they reached the mountain,  they spread their nets, and made their dogs ready for the chase, to  see if any wild animals would come to that place. Not long afterwards  they captured a large hog. They took it under a large tree and killed  it. Then Sunga and Suac went out into the forest again.    Sacu was left to prepare their food. While he was busy cooking,  he heard a voice saying, \"Ha, ha! what a nice meal you are  preparing! Hurry up! I am hungry.\" On looking up, Sacu saw on the top  of the tree a horrible creature,--a very large black man with a long  beard. This was Pugut.    Sacu said to him, \"Aba! [18] I am not cooking this food for you. My  companions and I are hungry.\"    \"Well, let us see who shall have it, then,\" said Pugut as he came  down the tree. At first Sacu did not want to give him the food; but  Pugut knocked the hunter down, and before he had time to recover had  eaten up all the food. Then he climbed the tree again. When Sunga  and Suac came back, Sunga said to Sacu, \"Is the food ready? Here is  a deer that we have caught.\"    Sacu answered, \"When the food was ready, Pugut came and ate it all. I  tried to prevent him, but in vain: I could not resist him.\"    \"Well,\" said Sunga, \"let me be the cook while you and Suac are the  hunters.\" Then Sacu and Suac went out, and Sunga was left to cook. The  food was no sooner ready than Pugut came again, and ate it all as  before. So when the hunters returned, bringing a hog with them,  they still had nothing to eat.    Accordingly Suac was left to cook, and his companions went away to  hunt again. Suac roasted the hog. Pugut smelled it. He looked down,  and said, \"Ha, ha! I have another cook; hurry up! boy, I am hungry.\"    \"I pray you, please do not deprive us of this food too,\" said Suac.    \"I must have it, for I am hungry,\" said Pugut. \"Otherwise I shall eat  you up.\" When the hog was roasted a nice brown, Pugut came down the  tree. But Suac placed the food near the fire and stood by it; and when  Pugut tried to seize it, the boy pushed him into the fire. Pugut's  beard was burnt, and it became kinky. [19] The boy then ran to a  deep pit. He covered it on the top with grass. Pugut did not stay to  eat the food, but followed Suac. Suac was very cunning. He stood on  the opposite side of the pit, and said, \"I pray you, do not step on  my grass!\"    \"I am going to eat you up,\" said Pugut angrily, as he stepped on the  grass and fell into the pit. The boy covered the pit with stones  and earth, thinking that Pugut would perish there; but he was  mistaken. Suac had not gone far when he saw Pugut following him;  but just then he saw, too, a crocodile. He stopped and resolutely  waited for Pugut, whom he gave a blow and pushed into the mouth of  the crocodile. Thus Pugut was destroyed.    Suac then took his victim's club, and returned under the tree. After a  while his companions came back. He related to them how he had overcome  Pugut, and then they ate. The next day they returned to town.    Suac, on hearing that there was a giant who came every night into  the neighborhood to devour people, went one night to encounter the  giant. When the giant came, he said, \"You are just the thing for me  to eat.\" But Suac gave him a deadly blow with Pugut's club, and the  giant tumbled down dead.    Later Suac rid the islands of all the wild monsters, and became the  ruler over his people.      The Three Friends,--The Monkey, the Dog, and the Carabao.    Narrated by Jose M. Hilario, a Tagalog from Batangas, Batangas.    Once there lived three friends,--a monkey, a dog, and a carabao. They  were getting tired of city life, so they decided to go to the  country to hunt. They took along with them rice, meat, and some  kitchen utensils.    The first day the carabao was left at home to cook the food,  so that his two companions might have"]]]
