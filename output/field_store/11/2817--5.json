Do you get a ferruling every time you  miss a word?--and enjoy the pain because it pleases papa to inflict  it?\"    \"Oh, Lucy, how can you be so ridiculous?\" and a quick, vivid blush  mounted to Elsie's very hair.    \"I beg your pardon, Elsie, dear, I had no business to say such a  thing,\" cried Lucy, springing up to throw her arms round her friend  and kiss her warmly; \"but of course it was nothing but the merest  nonsense. I know well enough your papa never does anything of the  kind.\"    \"No; if my lessons are not well prepared they have to be learned over  again, that is all; and if I see that papa is displeased with me, I  assure you it is punishment enough.\"    \"Do you think he'll let you accept my invitation?\"    \"I don't know, indeed, Lucy. I think he will hardly like to have me  give up my studies for that length of time, and in fact I hardly like  to do so myself.\"    \"Oh, you must come. You can practise on my piano every day for an hour  or two, if you like. We'll learn some duets. And you can bring your  sketch-book and carry it along when we walk or ride, as we shall  every day. And we might read some improving books together,--you and  Herbert, and I. He is worse again, poor fellow! so that some days he  hardly leaves his couch even to limp across the room, and it's partly  to cheer him up that we want you to come. There's nothing puts him  into better spirits than a sight of your face.\"    \"You don't expect other company?\"    \"No, except on our birthday; but then we're going to have a little  party, just of our own set,--we boys and girls that have grown up--or  are growing up--together, as one may say. Oh, yes, I want to have  Carrie Howard, Mary Leslie, and Enna stay a day or two after the  party. Now coax your papa hard, for we must have you,\" she added,  rising to go.    \"That would be a sure way to make him say no,\" said Elsie, smiling;  \"he never allows me to coax or tease; at least, not after he has once  answered my request.\"    \"Then don't think of it. Good-bye. No, don't waste time in coming to  see me off, but go back to your books like a good child. I mean to  have a little chat with your mamma before I go.\"    Elsie returned to her lessons with redoubled energy. She was longing  to become more intimately acquainted with Ellen Montgomery, but  resolutely denied herself even so much as a peep at the pages of the  fascinating story-book until her allotted tasks should be faithfully  performed.    These, with her regular daily exercise in the open air, filled up the  morning; there was a half hour before, and another after dinner, which  she could call her own; then two hours for needlework, music, and  drawing, and she was free to employ herself as she would till  bed-time.    That was very apt to be in reading, and if the weather was fine she  usually carried her book to an arbor at some distance from the house.  It was reached by a long shaded walk that led to it from the lawn, on  which the glass doors of her pretty boudoir opened. It was a cool,  breezy, quiet spot, on a terraced hillside, commanding a lovely view  of vale, river, and woodland, and from being so constantly frequented  by our heroine, had come to be called by her name,--\"Elsie's Arbor.\"  Arthur, well acquainted with these tastes and habits, sought, and  found her here on the afternoon of this day--found her so deeply  absorbed in Miss Warner's sweet story that she was not aware of his  approach--so full of sympathy for little Ellen that her tears were  dropping upon the page as she read.    \"What, crying, eh?\" he said with a sneer, as he seated himself by her  side, and rudely pulled one of her curls, very much as he had been  used to do years ago. \"Well, I needn't be surprised, for you always  were the greatest baby I ever saw.\"    \"Please let my hair alone, Arthur; you are not very polite in either  speech or action,\" she answered, brushing away her tears and moving a  little farther from him.    \"It's not worth while to waste politeness on you. What's that you're  reading?\"    \"A new book Mr. Travilla gave me.\"    \"Has no name, eh?\"    \"Yes, 'Wide, Wide World.'\"    \"Some namby-pamby girl's story, I s'pose, since you're allowed to read  it; or are you doing it on the sly?\"    \"No, I never do such things, and hope I never shall; papa gave me  permission.\"    \"Oh; ah! then I haven't got you in my power: wish I had.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because I might turn it to good account. I know you are as afraid as  death of Horace.\"    \"No, I am not!\" dried Elsie indignantly, rich color rushing all over  her fair face and neck; \"for I know that he loves me dearly and if I  had been disobeying or deceiving him I would far sooner throw myself  on his mercy than on yours.\"    \"You would, eh? How mad you are; your face is as red as a beet. A  pretty sort of Christian you are, aren't you?\"    \"I am not perfect, Arthur; but you mustn't judge of religion by me.\"    \"I shall, though. Don't you wish I'd go away?\" he added teasingly,  again snatching at her curls.    But she eluded his grasp, and rising, stood before him with an air of  gentle dignity. \"Yes,\" she said, \"since you ask me, I'll own that I  do. I don't know why it is that, though your manners are polished when  you choose to make them so, you are always rude and ungentlemanly to  me when you find me alone. So I shall be very glad if you'll just go  away and leave me to solitude and the enjoyment of my book.\"    \"I'll do so when I get ready; not a minute sooner. But you can get rid  of me just as soon as you like. I see you take. Yes, I want that money  I asked you for yesterday, and I am bound to have it.\"    \"Arthur, my answer must be just the same that it was then; I can give  you no other.\"    \"You're the meanest girl alive! To my certain knowledge you are worth  at least a million and a half, and yet you refuse to lend me the  pitiful sum of fifty dollars.\"    \"Arthur, you know I have no choice in the matter. Papa has forbidden  me to lend you money without his knowledge and consent, and I cannot  disobey him.\"    \"When did he forbid you?\"    \"A long while ago; and though he has said nothing about it lately, he  has told me again and again that his commands are always binding until  he revokes them.\"    \"Fifteen years old, and not allowed to do as you please even with  your pocket money!\" he said contemptuously. \"Do you expect to be in  leading-strings all your life?\"    \"I shall of course have control of my own money matters on coming of  age; but I expect to obey my father as long as we both live,\" she  answered, with gentle but firm decision.    \"Do you have to show your balance in hand when you give in your  account?\"    \"No; do you suppose papa cannot trust my word?\" she answered, somewhat  indignantly.    \"Then you could manage it just as easily as not. There's no occasion  for him to know whether your balance in hand is at that moment in your  possession or mine; as I told you before, I only want to borrow it for  two weeks. Come, let me have it. If you don't, the day will come when  you'll wish you had.\"    She repeated her refusal; he grew very angry and abusive, and at  length went so far as to strike her.    A quick step sounded on the gravel walk, a strong grasp was laid on  Arthur's arm, he felt himself suddenly jerked aside and flung upon  his knees, while a perfect rain of stinging, smarting blows descended  rapidly upon his back and shoulders.    \"There, you unmitigated scoundrel, you mean, miserable caitiff; lay  your hand upon her again if you dare!\" cried Mr. Travilla, finishing  the castigation by applying the toe of his boot to Arthur's nether  parts with a force that sent him reeling some distance down the walk,  to fall with a heavy thud upon the ground.    The lad rose, white with rage, and shook his fist at his antagonist.  \"I'll strike her when I please,\" he said with an oath, \"and not be  called to account by you for it either; she's my niece, and nothing to  you.\"    \"I'll defend her nevertheless, and see to it that you come to grief if  you attempt to harm her in any way whatever. Did he hurt you much, my  child?\" And Mr. Travilla's tone changed to one of tender concern as he  turned and addressed Elsie, who had sunk pale and trembling upon the  rustic seat where Arthur had found her.    \"No, sir, but I fear you have hurt him a good deal, in your kind zeal  for my defence,\" she answered, looking after Arthur, as he limped away  down the path.    \"I have broken my cane, that is the worst of it,\" said her protector  coolly, looking regretfully down at the fragment he still held in his  hand.    \"You must have struck very hard, and oh, Mr. Travilla, what if he  should take it into his head to challenge you?\" and Elsie turned pale  with terror.    \"Never fear; he is too arrant a coward for that; he knows I am a good  shot, and that, as the challenged party, I would have the right to  the choice of weapons.\"    \"But you wouldn't fight, Mr. Travilla? you do not approve of  duelling?\"    \"So, no indeed, Elsie; both the laws of God and of the land are  against it, and I could not engage in it either as a good citizen or a  Christian.\"    \"Oh, I am so glad of that, and that you came to my rescue; for I was  really growing frightened, Arthur seemed in such a fury with me.\"    \"What was it about?\"    Elsie explained, then asked how he had happened to come to her aid.    \"I had learned from the servants that your father and mother were both  out, so came here in search of you,\" he said. \"As I drew near I saw  that Arthur was with you, and not wishing to overhear your talk, I  waited at a little distance up there on the bank, watching you through  the trees. I perceived at once that he was in a towering passion, and  fearing he would ill-treat you in some way, I held myself in readiness  to come to your rescue; and when I saw him strike you, such a fury  suddenly came over me that I could not possibly refrain from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9966"],[0,"The Spartan Twins (#10)"],[1,"different. But she did  sneeze! The air was damp and chill, she was sitting on a cold stone step,  and a loud \"kerchoo\" suddenly startled the two plotters on the porch. The  children were so frightened they could not move, but they rolled up their  eyes, and over the edge of the balustrade they saw two shadowy heads  looking down at them.    \"Who's there?\" said the voice of Lampon.    The children were too frightened to answer.    \"Bring a torch,\" cried the voice of the other priest, and soon the two  heads were again hanging over the balustrade and a torch in the hand of  Lampon threw light on the upturned faces of the Twins.    \"Who are you?\" said the priest of the Erechtheum, \"and what are you doing  here at this hour, you miserable little spies?\"    \"Oh, please, we aren't spies at all,\" cried Dion. He didn't know what a  spy was, but he thought it safe to say he wasn't one. \"We are lost.\"    \"Come up here at once.\" It was Lampon who spoke.    The children, half dead with terror, went round to the other side of the  porch, climbed the steps to the entrance, and stood trembling before the  priests. Lampon lifted his torch and looked at them carefully.    \"Didn't I see you this morning at the house of Pericles?\" he asked  sternly. The Twins nodded.    \"Who sent you here?\" he asked.    \"Nobody sent us. We're lost,\" cried poor Daphne.    \"Humph!\" said the other priest. \"That's a likely story.\"    \"Did you hear what we were talking about?\" asked Lampon. He took Dion by  the shoulder, and as he did not answer at once, shook him.    \"Come, yes or no,\" he said.    \"Ye-e-es,\" stammered Dion.    The two priests looked at each other, and Lampon said: \"They are the  children of the farmer who brought the lamb to Pericles. They live on his  farm.\"    \"It will be a long time before they see the farm again,\" answered the  other shortly. \"They say they are lost. Very well, we will see to it that  those words are made true. What do you say to shipping them to Africa?  They would make a pretty pair of slaves, and a ship sails for Alexandria  to-morrow. It can easily be arranged. I know the captain.\"    \"A good idea!\" said Lampon. \"Since these children are in a sense wards of  Pericles, they are for that reason the more likely to be enemies of the  Gods. It would be an act of piety to send them where they could do no  harm by betraying the secrets of the temple.\"    The children were speechless with fright. Their two captors pushed them  roughly before them into the temple and drove them through the great  gloomy interior, lighted only by a few torches, to a small closet-like  room somewhere in the rear. As they walked, huge black shadows cast by  the torch of Lampon danced grotesquely before them. At the closet the two  priests stopped to unlock the door.    \"Here is a safe harbor for you for the night,\" said Lampon, as he pushed  the children into the closet. \"To-morrow we may find a yet safer place  for you,\" and with these words he locked them in.    The children were so exhausted by hunger and fright that, even though  they were Spartans, they sat down on the cold stone floor and wept in  each other's arms.    \"Oh, Mother, Mother,\" sobbed Daphne, \"why did we ever leave you?\"    \"Don't you remember,\" said Dion, struggling with his tears, \"that the  signs were favorable? It must be all right somehow, for the word Mother  heard was 'Go.'\"    \"If I only hadn't sneezed!\" sobbed Daphne.    \"But a sneeze is always a good sign,\" said Dion.    \"Well, anyway,\" said Daphne bravely, though her voice shook and her teeth  chattered, \"crying won't do any good. Let's feel around and see if there  is anything in this room.\"    It was dark, except for a gray patch of dim light from a window high up  in the wall. Dion and Daphne kept close together and went carefully round  the room, feeling the wall with their hands. Dion stumbled against  something. It was a chest where the priests' robes were kept.    \"Do you suppose we could move it?\" whispered Daphne. \"If we could, maybe  we could look out of the window and see where we are.\"    They both got on the same side of it and pushed with all their strength.  The chest moved a little and made a horrible screeching sound on the  stone floor.    \"Sh-sh-sh,\" whispered Daphne, as if the chest could hear. They held their  breath to listen for footsteps. There was no sound outside. They waited a  little while and pushed again. Again the chest screeched, and again they  stopped to listen. After many such efforts it was finally moved under  the window, and the two sprang up on the top of it to look out. By  standing on tiptoe they could just see over the sill. There was no glass,  for there was no window-glass anywhere at that time, and the cool night  air blew in on their faces. The Acropolis was bathed in moonlight. There  was no sound outside, and no one in sight anywhere. Apparently the world  was asleep. Suddenly the stillness was broken by the hoot of an owl, and  they could see the great bird flying toward them.    \"It's Athena's own bird,\" whispered Dion, \"and it's flying from the east.  That means good luck. Oh, maybe we can get away from this dreadful place  after all!\"    \"Let's pray to Athena,\" quavered Daphne. \"We can't sacrifice, but maybe  she'll hear us just the same.\"    The two little prisoners spread their hands toward the sky, and Dion  whispered, \"Help us, O Athena, just the way you helped Perseus kill the  Gorgon.\"    \"Give us wisdom to get out of this place and to save Pericles from these  wicked men,\" added Daphne.    \"Sh-sh,\" whispered Dion, \"they're priests.\"    \"They are wicked, anyway, whatever they are, to want to kill Pericles,\"  said Daphne stoutly. Then she added: \"Maybe that's why we're here! Maybe  we could warn him about the priests if we could just get out. Anyway,  we're Spartans, and we've got to stop crying and do our best.\"    Dion put his hands on the window-sill and gave a jump.    \"I believe I could get up here if you'd give me a boost,\" he said.    \"But how shall I getup?\" asked Daphne. \"There'll be nobody to boost me.\"    \"I'll pull you,\" said Dion.    \"You might fall out backwards, or fall in head first doing it,\" said  Daphne.    \"Let's try, anyway,\" said Dion.    Daphne boosted, and Dion climbed, and in another minute he was sitting on  the window-sill with one foot hanging down outside and the other firmly  braced against the side of the window. He held on with his left hand and,  leaning over, was able with his right to clasp Daphne. She hooked her  left arm on his, put her hand on the sill and leaped. The next instant  she was lying on her stomach over the sill, and Dion was helping her to a  sitting position.    \"It isn't so very far to drop,\" whispered Dion. \"I've dropped from the  balustrade into the court lots of times at home.\"    \"All right,\" said Daphne, \"You drop first, and I'll follow.\"    Dion turned, stuck his head out as far as possible, and looked in every  direction. Then he let himself down from the sill, hung to it for a  moment by his hands, and dropped like a cat to the ground. He flattened  himself against the wall of the temple, and in another moment Daphne was  safe beside him.    \"Now,\" whispered Dion, \"we'll run like everything around behind the  temple to the statue of Athena.\"    Hand in hand through the moonlight they sped, and were soon in the shadow  of the great bronze statue.    \"Let's wait here a minute and look around,\" whispered Dion.    They crouched down in the shadow and looked back. Their hearts almost  stopped beating when they saw two cloaked figures emerge from the temple,  and they recognized Lampon and the priest of the Erechthcum. The two men  passed so near the statue that the children could plainly hear their  voices, though they spoke in low tones.    \"We will wait at the head of the street of the Amphorae,\" they heard  Lampon say. \"He is sure to pass that way. It will relieve my tongue to  tell him some things in the guise of a common ruffian which I could not  say as a priest.\"    \"You did well to recognize those brats,\" said the priest of the  Erechtheum. \"They might have upset all our plans if we had not kept them  safe.\"    The two brats behind the statue shook their fists at the retreating  figures. They waited until the sound of footsteps had died away, and then  they made a quick dash from the shadow and flew down the incline  up which the procession had come in the morning. In a moment they were at  the bottom. They could just see the dark figures of the priests  disappearing toward the north. The children shrank back again into  the shadow.    \"What shall we do next?\" said Daphne. \"We don't know our way anywhere at  all. We don't even know where our uncle lives.\"    \"What was the name of that rich man at whose house they said Pericles was  going to the banquet?\" asked Dion, with a sudden inspiration.    \"Oh, dear,\" said Daphne, \"I can't think. Let me see. Hip---Hip--\"    \"Ponicus,\" finished Dion, \"that's it! Surely any Athenian would know  where a rich man like Hipponicus lives. We must just go along until we  meet some one we can ask.\"    \"Suppose we should meet Lampon!\" shuddered Daphne.    \"We shan't,\" said Dion; \"they've gone off that way. They are going to the  street of the Amphorae. We should recognize that street. It has the long  row of vases, don't you remember? We went through it this morning.\"    \"If we can find the house of Hipponicus and warn Pericles about the  priests, I'm sure he'll take care of us,\" said Daphne.    Encouraged by this thought, the two children passed boldly out of the  shadow and ran westward. They passed a few people, but for the most part,  the street was deserted, and they met no one they dared speak to. At last  they came to the city wall and a gate.    \"Now what shall we do?\" murmured Daphne. \"We can't go any farther this  way.\"    \"Why, I know this place,\" Dion whispered joyfully. \"It's the gate that  opens into the paved road to the Piraeus. It's"]]]
