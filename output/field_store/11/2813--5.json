Marionetta called him  ungrateful, cruel, cold-hearted, and accompanied her reproaches with  many sobs and tears; poor Scythrop growing every moment more soft  and submissive--till, at length, he threw himself at her feet, and  declared that no competition of beauty, however dazzling, genius,  however transcendent, talents, however cultivated, or philosophy,  however enlightened, should ever make him renounce his divine  Marionetta.    'Competition!' thought Marionetta, and suddenly, with an air of the  most freezing indifference, she said, 'You are perfectly at liberty,  sir, to do as you please; I beg you will follow your own plans,  without any reference to me.'    Scythrop was confounded. What was become of all her passion and her  tears? Still kneeling, he kissed her hand with rueful timidity, and  said, in most pathetic accents, 'Do you not love me, Marionetta?'    'No,' said Marionetta, with a look of cold composure: 'No.' Scythrop  still looked up incredulously. 'No, I tell you.'    'Oh! very well, madam,' said Scythrop, rising, 'if that is the case,  there are those in the world--'    'To be sure there are, sir;--and do you suppose I do not see through  your designs, you ungenerous monster?'    'My designs? Marionetta!'    'Yes, your designs, Scythrop. You have come here to cast me off, and  artfully contrive that it should appear to be my doing, and not yours,  thinking to quiet your tender conscience with this pitiful stratagem.  But do not suppose that you are of so much consequence to me: do not  suppose it: you are of no consequence to me at all--none at all:  therefore, leave me: I renounce you: leave me; why do you not leave  me?'    Scythrop endeavoured to remonstrate, but without success. She  reiterated her injunctions to him to leave her, till, in the  simplicity of his spirit, he was preparing to comply. When he had  nearly reached the door, Marionetta said, 'Farewell.' Scythrop looked  back. 'Farewell, Scythrop,' she repeated, 'you will never see me  again.'    'Never see you again, Marionetta?'    'I shall go from hence to-morrow, perhaps to-day; and before we meet  again, one of us will be married, and we might as well be dead, you  know, Scythrop.'    The sudden change of her voice in the last few words, and the burst  of tears that accompanied them, acted like electricity on the  tender-hearted youth; and, in another instant, a complete  reconciliation was accomplished without the intervention of words.    There are, indeed, some learned casuists, who maintain that love has  no language, and that all the misunderstandings and dissensions of  lovers arise from the fatal habit of employing words on a subject to  which words are inapplicable; that love, beginning with looks, that  is to say, with the physiognomical expression of congenial mental  dispositions, tends through a regular gradation of signs and symbols  of affection, to that consummation which is most devoutly to be  wished; and that it neither is necessary that there should be, nor  probable that there would be, a single word spoken from first to  last between two sympathetic spirits, were it not that the arbitrary  institutions of society have raised, at every step of this very simple  process, so many complicated impediments and barriers in the shape  of settlements and ceremonies, parents and guardians, lawyers,  Jew-brokers, and parsons, that many an adventurous knight (who, in  order to obtain the conquest of the Hesperian fruit, is obliged to  fight his way through all these monsters), is either repulsed at the  onset, or vanquished before the achievement of his enterprise: and  such a quantity of unnatural talking is rendered inevitably necessary  through all the stages of the progression, that the tender and  volatile spirit of love often takes flight on the pinions of some of  the [Greek: epea pteroenta], or _winged words_ which are pressed into  his service in despite of himself.    At this conjuncture, Mr Glowry entered, and sitting down near them,  said, 'I see how it is; and, as we are all sure to be miserable do  what we may, there is no need of taking pains to make one another more  so; therefore, with God's blessing and mine, there'--joining their  hands as he spoke.    Scythrop was not exactly prepared for this decisive step; but he could  only stammer out, 'Really, sir, you are too good;' and Mr Glowry  departed to bring Mr Hilary to ratify the act.    Now, whatever truth there may be in the theory of love and language,  of which we have so recently spoken, certain it is, that during Mr  Glowry's absence, which lasted half an hour, not a single word was  said by either Scythrop or Marionetta.    Mr Glowry returned with Mr Hilary, who was delighted at the prospect  of so advantageous an establishment for his orphan niece, of whom he  considered himself in some manner the guardian, and nothing remained,  as Mr Glowry observed, but to fix the day.    Marionetta blushed, and was silent. Scythrop was also silent for a  time, and at length hesitatingly said, 'My dear sir, your goodness  overpowers me; but really you are so precipitate.'    Now, this remark, if the young lady had made it, would, whether she  thought it or not--for sincerity is a thing of no account on these  occasions, nor indeed on any other, according to Mr Flosky--this  remark, if the young lady had made it, would have been perfectly  _comme il faut_; but, being made by the young gentleman, it was _toute  autre chose_, and was, indeed, in the eyes of his mistress, a most  heinous and irremissible offence. Marionetta was angry, very angry,  but she concealed her anger, and said, calmly and coldly, 'Certainly,  you are much too precipitate, Mr Glowry. I assure you, sir, I have  by no means made up my mind; and, indeed, as far as I know it, it  inclines the other way; but it will be quite time enough to think of  these matters seven years hence. Before surprise permitted reply, the  young lady had locked herself up in her own apartment.    'Why, Scythrop,' said Mr Glowry, elongating his face exceedingly, 'the  devil is come among us sure enough, as Mr Toobad observes: I thought  you and Marionetta were both of a mind.'    'So we are, I believe, sir,' said Scythrop, gloomily, and stalked away  to his tower.    'Mr Glowry,' said Mr Hilary, 'I do not very well understand all this.'    'Whims, brother Hilary,' said Mr Glowry; 'some little foolish love  quarrel, nothing more. Whims, freaks, April showers. They will be  blown over by to-morrow.'    'If not,' said Mr Hilary, 'these April showers have made us April  fools.'    'Ah!' said Mr Glowry, 'you are a happy man, and in all your  afflictions you can console yourself with a joke, let it be ever so  bad, provided you crack it yourself. I should be very happy to laugh  with you, if it would give you any satisfaction; but, really, at  present, my heart is so sad, that I find it impossible to levy a  contribution on my muscles.'           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER X      On the evening on which Mr Asterias had caught a glimpse of a female  figure on the sea-shore, which he had translated into the visual sign  of his interior cognition of a mermaid, Scythrop, retiring to his  tower, found his study preoccupied. A stranger, muffled in a cloak,  was sitting at his table. Scythrop paused in surprise. The stranger  rose at his entrance, and looked at him intently a few minutes, in  silence. The eyes of the stranger alone were visible. All the rest  of the figure was muffled and mantled in the folds of a black cloak,  which was raised, by the right hand, to the level of the eyes. This  scrutiny being completed, the stranger, dropping the cloak, said, 'I  see, by your physiognomy, that you may be trusted;' and revealed to  the astonished Scythrop a female form and countenance of dazzling  grace and beauty, with long flowing hair of raven blackness, and  large black eyes of almost oppressive brilliancy, which strikingly  contrasted with a complexion of snowy whiteness. Her dress was  extremely elegant, but had an appearance of foreign fashion, as if  both the lady and her mantua-maker were of 'a far countree.'      'I guess 'twas frightful there to see    A lady so richly clad as she,    Beautiful exceedingly.'    For, if it be terrible to one young lady to find another under a tree  at midnight, it must, _a fortiori_, be much more terrible to a young  gentleman to find a young lady in his study at that hour. If the  logical consecutiveness of this conclusion be not manifest to my  readers, I am sorry for their dulness, and must refer them, for more  ample elucidation, to a treatise which Mr Flosky intends to write, on  the Categories of Relation, which comprehend Substance and Accident,  Cause and Effect, Action and Re-action.    Scythrop, therefore, either was or ought to have been frightened; at  all events, he was astonished; and astonishment, though not in itself  fear, is nevertheless a good stage towards it, and is, indeed, as it  were, the half-way house between respect and terror, according to Mr  Burke's graduated scale of the sublime.[7]    'You are surprised,' said the lady; 'yet why should you be surprised?  If you had met me in a drawing-room, and I had been introduced to  you by an old woman, it would have been a matter of course: can the  division of two or three walls, and the absence of an unimportant  personage, make the same object essentially different in the  perception of a philosopher?'    'Certainly not,' said Scythrop; 'but when any class of objects  has habitually presented itself to our perceptions in invariable  conjunction with particular relations, then, on the sudden appearance  of one object of the class divested of those accompaniments, the  essential difference of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9914"],[0,"The Babylonian Legends of the Creation (#10)"],[1,"counsel [saying]:    3. \"I will solidify blood, I will form bone.    4. \"I will set up man, 'Man' [shall be] his name.    5. \"I will create the man 'Man.'    6. \"The service of the gods shall be established, and I will set them  (i.e., the gods) free.    7. \"I will make twofold the ways of the gods, and I will beautify  [them].    8. \"They are [now] grouped together in one place, but they shall be  partitioned in two.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Reading, _ishtenish lu kuppudu-ma ana shina lu  uzizu_.]    9.

It was  destroyed probably soon after the capture of Babylon by Cyrus (539  B.C.) and when Alexander the Great reached Babylon he found it ruins.]    49.

Next Marduk assigns seats to the Seven  Gods of Fate and to Enlil and Anu, and then he lays up in E-Sagila the  famous bow which he bore during his fight against Tiamat.
