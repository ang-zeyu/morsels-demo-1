You seem cool enough, and still you act as  if you actually meant to meet him with deadly weapons.\"    \"I shall meet him with any kind of weapons he may name.\"    Roll Ditson came forward.    \"Of course you understand that I have no feeling, Merry, old man,\" he  said; \"but Diamond has chosen me as his second once more, and so I can't  refuse to serve him. It is a most unfortunate affair, but he insists  that you fight him with rapiers.\"    \"Very well; I agree to that. Arrange the time and place with my second,  Mr. Rattleton.\"    Frank sat down, picked up an illustrated paper, and seemed deeply  interested in the pictures.    Ditson drew Rattleton aside.    \"My principal,\" said he, swelling with importance, \"demands that this  meeting take place at once.\"    \"Great Scott!\" exploded Harry. \"I object to this sort of business. It is  outrageous! If one of them should be seriously wounded, what excuse can  be made?\"    \"We'll find some excuse that will go.\"    \"But what if one of them should be killed?\"    \"I hardly think anything as serious as that will occur.\"    \"But should it, there would be an investigation, and expulsion and  disgrace, if nothing worse, would overtake us.\"    \"Oh, well, if you are afraid, just go back and tell Mr. Merriwell to  apologize here and now, and I think Mr. Diamond will let him off.\"    Harry looked at Merriwell and then shook his head.    \"He'll never do that,\" he said, hoarsely. \"We'll have to arrange this  duel. There is no other way for it.\"    Between the ages of sixteen and twenty-three blood runs hot and swift in  the veins of a youth. It is then that he will do many wild and reckless  things--things which will cause him to stand appalled when he considers  them in after years.    Frank believed that in order to retain his own self respect and the  respect of his comrades he must meet Diamond and give him satisfaction  in any manner he might designate.    But there was another reason why Frank was so willing to meet the  Virginian. Merriwell was an expert fencer. At Fardale he had been the  champion of the school, and he had taken some lessons while traveling.  He had thoroughly studied the trick of disarming his adversary, a trick  which is known to every French fencing master, but is thought little of  by them.    He believed that he could repeatedly disarm Diamond.    His adventures in various parts of the world had made him somewhat less  cautious than he naturally would have been and so he trusted everything  to his ability to get the best of the Virginian.    Roland Ditson longed to force Merriwell to squeal. He did not fancy  Frank knew anything of fencing, and he thought Merriwell would soon lose  his nerve when he saw himself toyed with by Diamond.    And Diamond had promised not to seriously wound the fellow he hated.    The meeting was arranged as quietly as possible, and the freshmen who  were to witness it slipped out of Billy's by twos and threes and strode  away.    Thirty minutes later, in a small, stuffy room, two lads, with their  coats and vests off and their sleeves turned back, faced each other,  rapiers in hand.    \"Ready, gentlemen!\" called Ditson.    They made ready.    \"On guard!\"    The position was assumed.    Then came the command that set them at it.    In less than twenty seconds the spectators, who kept back as well as  possible, had seen something they never beheld before. They saw two  beardless lads fighting with deadly weapons and using skill that was  marvelous.    It took Jack Diamond far less than twenty seconds to discover that  Frank Merriwell was a swordsman of astonishing skill. He had expected to  toy with the Northerner, but he found himself engaged with one who met  every stroke like a professional.    A great feeling of relief came over Harry Rattleton.    \"Whee jiz!\" he muttered. \"Merry is a cooler at it! I believe he's  Diamond's match!\"    With Diamond astonishment gave way to fury. Was it possible that this  fellow was to get the best of him at everything? He fought savagely, and  Ditson turned white as a ghost when he saw the Virginian making mad  thrusts at the breast of the lad he hated.    \"He's forgotten his promise--he's forgotten!\" huskily whispered Ditson.  \"What if he should run Merriwell through the body?\"    Then came a cry of anger from Diamond and a cry of surprise and relief  from the spectators.    Frank Merriwell, with that peculiar twisting movement of his wrist, had  torn the rapier from the Virginian's hand.    The blade fell clanging to the floor, and Merriwell stepped back, with  the point of his rapier lowered.    Snarling savagely, Diamond made a catlike spring and snatched up the  weapon he had lost.    \"On guard!\" he cried, madly. \"The end is not yet! I'll kill you or  you'll kill me!\"    There was a clash of steel, and then the fight was on with more fury  than before.    Diamond was utterly reckless. He left a dozen openings where Frank could  have run him through. But Merriwell was working to repeat the trick of a  few seconds before.    The frightened spectators were beginning to think of intervening, when  once again Diamond was disarmed.    At the same moment there came a heavy knocking at the door.    One fellow, who had been on guard, ran in from a corridor and cried:    \"It's the faculty! Somebody has given them wind of this!\"    \"Here! here!\" called a freshman. \"Follow me!\"    They did so, and he led them to a back window, out of which they  clambered.    Diamond was the last to get out, and just as he touched the ground  somebody came around the corner and grabbed him.    \"I have one of them!\" shouted a voice, which he recognized as belonging  to one of the faculty.    He struggled to break away, but could not.    Then somebody dashed back to his side, caught hold of him, and with  wonderful strength tore him from the grasp of the man.    \"Run!\" panted Frank Merriwell's voice in his ear.    And they ran away together, and in a short while were safe in their  rooms.    It turned out that it was not the faculty that had tried to get in where  the duel was taking place, but some of the sophs. At the time he turned  back to rescue Diamond, however, Frank had believed the Virginian was in  the grasp of one of the professors.    Merriwell was regarded as more of a wonder than ever when it became  generally known that he had twice disarmed the Virginian in a duel with  rapiers--or a \"fencing contest,\" as the matter was openly spoken of by  those who discussed it.    But Bruce Browning, king of sophomores, was awaiting an opportunity to  get at Frank.          CHAPTER X.    AT MOREY'S.      \"Say, fellows, this thing must stop!\"    Puss Parker banged his fist down upon the table as he made this emphatic  declaration, the blow causing the partly emptied glass of ale to dance  and vibrate.    \"Aw, say,\" yawned Willis Paulding, \"you want to be a little cawful or  you will slop the good stuff, don't yer know.\"    Willis affected a drawl, had his clothes made in London, and considered  himself \"deucedly English,\" although he sometimes forgot himself for a  short time and dropped his mannerisms.    Tad Horner gave Paulding a look of scorn.    \"Come off your perch, Paul!\" he invited. \"You give me severe pains! Get  onto yourself! I don't wonder Parker is excited over this matter.\"    \"Who wouldn't be excited?\" exclaimed Puss. \"These confounded freshmen  have overthrown all the established customs of the college. They have  been running things with a high hand. Why, they have really been cocks  of the walk ever since that little affair out at East Rock.\"    \"'Sh!\" cautioned Punch Swallows, a lad with fiery red hair. \"Don't  speak of that, for the love of goodness! Just think of a gang of sophs  being captured by freshmen disguised as Indians, taken out into the  country, tied to stakes and nearly roasted, while the freshmen dance a  gleeful _cancan_ around them! It's awful! The mere thought of it gives  me nervous prostration!\"    It was two weeks after the duel, and the five sophomores had gathered in  the little back room at Morey's, They looked at each other and were  silent, but their silence was very suggestive.    \"By Jawve!\" drawled Paulding, \"it is awful! I wasn't in the crowd. If I  had been--\"    \"You'd been roasted like the rest of us,\" cut in Parker.    \"But I'd made it warm faw some of the blooming cads.\"    \"Haven't we been doing our level best to make it warm for them?\" cried  Horner. \"But no matter what we do, they see us and go us one better.\"    \"It all comes from Merriwell,\" asserted Swallows. \"He's king of the  freshmen, the same as Browning is king of the sophomores.\"    \"And he's a terror,\" nodded Horner. \"He can put up more jokes than one.\"    \"And they say he can fight.\"    \"They say! Why, didn't you see him do Diamond, the fresh from Virginia?  Oh, no. I remember you were not with us that night. Yes, he can fight,  and he doesn't seem to be easily scared.\"    \"I think he is a blawsted upstart,\" said Paulding, lazily puffing at his  cigarette. \"He needs to be called down, don't yer know.\"    \"Some time when he is upstairs, call him down,\" suggested Horner.    \"Fists are not the only things that fellows can fight with,\" said  Parker. \"The matter has been kept quiet, but it is said to be a fact  that Diamond forced him into a duel with rapiers, and he disarmed the  Southerner twice, having him completely at his mercy each time.\"    \"And Diamond prides himself on being an expert with that kind of  weapon,\" nodded Horner.    \"Why doesn't Browning do something?\" asked Paulding. \"It is outrageous  faw a lot of freshies to run things this way.\"    \"Browning is in training,\" said Parker.    \"In training? What faw? Why, he is so lazy--\"    \"He's training to get some of the flesh off him. It is my opinion that  somebody must check Merriwell's wild career, and he is getting in  condition to do it. You know that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1112"],[0,"The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet (#11)"],[1,"'ll not come down to-night.      I promise you, but for your company,      I would have been abed an hour ago.      Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.      Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.      Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;      To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.      Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender      Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd      In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.      Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;      Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love      And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-      But, soft! what day is this?      Par. Monday, my lord.      Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.      Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her      She shall be married to this noble earl.      Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?      We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;      For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,      It may be thought we held him carelessly,      Being our kinsman, if we revel much.      Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,      And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?      Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.      Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.      Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;      Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.      Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!      Afore me, It is so very very late      That we may call it early by-and-by.      Good night.                                                            Exeunt          Scene V.  Capulet's orchard.    Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.        Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.      It was the nightingale, and not the lark,      That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.      Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.      Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.      Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;      No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks      Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.      Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day      Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.      I must be gone and live, or stay and die.      Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.      It is some meteor that the sun exhales      To be to thee this night a torchbearer      And light thee on the way to Mantua.      Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.      Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.      I am content, so thou wilt have it so.      I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,      'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;      Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat      The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.      I have more care to stay than will to go.      Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.      How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.      Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!      It is the lark that sings so out of tune,      Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.      Some say the lark makes sweet division;      This doth not so, for she divideth us.      Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;      O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,      Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,      Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!      O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.      Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!                              Enter Nurse.        Nurse. Madam!      Jul. Nurse?      Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.      The day is broke; be wary, look about.      Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.                                                           [Exit.]      Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.                                                    He goeth down.      Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?      I must hear from thee every day in the hour,      For in a minute there are many days.      O, by this count I shall be much in years      Ere I again behold my Romeo!      Rom. Farewell!      I will omit no opportunity      That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.      Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?      Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve      For sweet discourses in our time to come.      Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!      Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,      As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.      Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.      Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.      Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!  Exit.      Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.      If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him      That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,      For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long      But send him back.      Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?      Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.      Is she not down so late, or up so early?      What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?                           Enter Mother.        Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?      Jul. Madam, I am not well.      Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?      What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?      An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.      Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;      But much of grief shows still some want of wit.      Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.      Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend      Which you weep for.      Jul. Feeling so the loss,      I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.      Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death      As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.      Jul. What villain, madam?      Lady. That same villain Romeo.      Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-      God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;      And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.      Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.      Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.      Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!      Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.      Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,      Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,      Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram      That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;      And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.      Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied      With Romeo till I behold him- dead-      Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.      Madam, if you could find out but a man      To bear a poison, I would temper it;      That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,      Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors      To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,      To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt      Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!      Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.      But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.      Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.      What are they, I beseech your ladyship?      Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;      One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,      Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy      That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.      Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?      Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn      The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,      The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,      Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.      Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,      He shall not make me there a joyful bride!      I wonder at this haste, that I must wed      Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.      I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,      I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear      It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,      Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!      Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,      And see how he will take it at your hands.                       Enter Capulet and Nurse.        Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,      But for the sunset of my brother's son      It rains downright.      How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?      Evermore show'ring? In one little body      Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:      For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,      Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is      Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,      Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,      Without a sudden calm will overset      Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?      Have you delivered to her our decree?      Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.      I would the fool were married to her grave!      Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.      How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?      Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,      Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought      So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?      Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.      Proud can I never be of what I hate,      But thankful even for hate that is meant love.      Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?      'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-      And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,      Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,      But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next      To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,      Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.      Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!      You tallow-face!      Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?      Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,      Hear me with patience but to speak a word.      Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!      I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday      Or never after look me in the face.      Speak not, reply not, do not answer"]]]
