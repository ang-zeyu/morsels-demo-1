[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10066"],[0,"Gunman's Reckoning (#11)"],[1,"Lebrun's!\"    The command brought an immediate protest. A big fellow stepped from the  bar, his sombrero pushed to the back of his head, his shirt sleeves  rolled to the elbow away from vast hairy forearms. One of his long arms  swept out and brought Donnegan to the bar.    \"I ain't no prophet,\" declared the giant, \"but I can spot a man that's  dry. What'll you have, bud?\" And to the bartender he added: \"Leave him  be, pardner, unless you're all set for considerable noise in here.\"    \"Long as his drinks are paid for,\" muttered the bartender, \"here he  stays. But these floaters do make me tired!\"    He jabbed the bottle across the bar at Donnegan and spun a glass noisily  at him, and the \"floater\" observed the angry bartender with a frightened  side glance, and then poured his drink gingerly. When the glass was half  full he hesitated and sought the face of the bartender again, for  permission to go on.    \"Fill her up!\" commanded the giant. \"Fill her up, lad, and drink  hearty.\"    \"I never yet,\" observed the bartender darkly, \"seen a beggar that wasn't  a hog.\"    At this Donnegan's protector shifted his belt so that the holster came a  little more forward on his thigh.    \"Son,\" he said, \"how long you been in these parts?\"    \"Long enough,\" declared the other, and lowered his black brows. \"Long  enough to be sick of it.\"    \"Maybe, maybe,\" returned the cowpuncher-miner, \"meantime you tie to  this. We got queer ways out here. When a gent drinks with us he's our  friend. This lad here is my pardner, just now. If I was him I would of  knocked your head off before now for what you've said--\"    \"I don't want no trouble,\" Donnegan said whiningly.    At this the bartender chuckled, and the miner showed his teeth in his  disgust.    \"Every gent has got his own way,\" he said sourly. \"But while you drink  with Hal Stern you drink with your chin up, bud. And don't forget it.  And them that tries to run over you got to run over me.\"    Saying this, he laid his large left hand on the bar and leaned a little  toward the bartender, but his right hand remained hanging loosely at his  side. It was near the holster, as Donnegan noticed. And the bartender,  having met the boring glance of the big man for a moment, turned surlily  away. The giant looked to Donnegan and observed: \"Know a good definition  of the word, skunk?\"    \"Nope,\" said Donnegan, brightening now that the stern eye, of the  bartender was turned away.    \"Here's one that might do. A skunk is a critter that bites when your  back is turned and runs when you look it in the eye. Here's how!\"    He drained his own glass, and Donnegan dexterously followed the example.    \"And what might you be doing around these parts?\" asked the big man,  veiling his contempt under a mild geniality.    \"Me? Oh, nothing.\"    \"Looking for a job, eh?\"    Donnegan shrugged.    \"Work ain't my line,\" he confided.    \"H'm-m-m,\" said Hal Stern. \"Well, you don't make no bones about it.\"    \"But just now,\" continued Donnegan, \"I thought maybe I'd pick up some  sort of a job for a while.\" He looked ruefully at the palms of his hands  which were as tender as the hands of a woman. \"Heard a fellow say that  Jack Landis was a good sort to work for--didn't rush his men none. They  said I might find him here.\"    The big man grunted.    \"Too early for him. He don't circulate around much till the sun goes  down. Kind of hard on his skin, the sun, maybe. So you're going to work  for him?\"    \"I was figuring on it.\"    \"Well, tie to this, bud. If you work for him you won't have him over  you.\"    \"No?\"    \"No, you'll have\"--he glanced a little uneasily around him--\"Lord Nick.\"    \"Who's he?\"    \"Who's he?\" The big man started in astonishment. \"Sufferin' catamounts!  Who is he?\" He laughed in a disagreeable manner. \"Well, son, you'll  find out, right enough!\"    \"The way you talk, he don't sound none too good.\"    Hal Stern grew anxious. \"The way I talk? Have I said anything agin' him?  Not a word! He's--he's--well, there ain't ever been trouble between us  and there never ain't going to be.\" He flushed and looked steadily at  Donnegan. \"Maybe he sent you to talk to me?\" he asked coldly.    But Donnegan's eyes took on a childish wideness.    \"Why, I never seen him,\" he declared. Hall Stern allowed the muscles of  his face to relax. \"All right,\" he said, \"they's no harm done. But Lord  Nick is a name that ain't handled none too free in these here parts.  Remember that!\"    \"But how,\" pondered Donnegan, \"can I be working for Lord Nick when I  sign up to work under Jack Landis?\"    \"I'll tell you how. Nick and Lebrun work together. Split profits. And  Nelly Lebrun works Landis for his dust. So the stuff goes in a  circle--Landis to Nelly to Lebrun to Nick. That clear?\"    \"I don't quite see it,\" murmured Donnegan.    \"I didn't think you would,\" declared the other, and snorted his disgust.  \"But that's all I'm going to say. Here come the boys--and dead dry!\"    For the afternoon was verging upon evening, and the first drift of  laborers from the mines was pouring into The Corner. One thing at least  was clear to Donnegan: that everyone knew how infatuated Landis had  become with Nelly Lebrun and that Landis had not built up an  extraordinarily good name for himself.          12      By the time absolute darkness had set in, Donnegan, in the new role of  lady's chaperon, sat before a dying fire with Louise Macon beside him.  He had easily seen from his talk with Stern that Landis was a public  figure, whether from the richness of his claims or his relations with  Lord Nick and Lebrun, or because of all these things; but as a public  figure it would be impossible to see him alone in his own tent, and  unless Louise could meet him alone half her power over him--supposing  that she still retained any--would be lost. Better by far that Landis  should come to her than that she should come to him, so Donnegan had  rented two tents by the day at an outrageous figure from the  enterprising real estate company of The Corner and to this new home he  brought the girl.    She accepted the arrangement with surprising equanimity. It seemed that  her father's training had eliminated from her mind any questioning of  the motives of others. She became even cheerful as she set about  arranging the pack which Donnegan put in her tent. Afterward she cooked  their supper over the fire which he built for her. Never was there such  a quick house-settling. And by the time it was absolutely dark they had  washed the dishes and sat before Lou's tent looking over the night  lights of The Corner and hearing the voice of its Great White Way  opening.    She had not even asked why he did not bring her straight to Jack Landis.  She had looked into Donnegan's tent, furnished with a single blanket and  his canvas kit, and had offered to share her pack with him. And now they  sat side by side before the tent and still she asked no questions about  what was to come.    Her silence was to Donnegan the dropping of the water upon the hard  rock. He was crumbling under it, and a wild hatred for the colonel rose  in him. No doubt that spirit of evil had foreseen all this; and he knew  that every moment spent with the girl would drive Donnegan on closer to  the accomplishment of the colonel's great purpose--the death of Jack  Landis. For the colonel, as Jack's next of kin, would take over all his  mining interests and free them at a stroke from the silent partnership  which apparently existed with Lord Nick and Lester. One bullet would do  all this: and with Jack dead, who else stood close to the girl? It was  only necessary that she should not know who sped the bullet home.    A horrible fancy grew up in Donnegan, as he sat there, that between him  and the girl lay a dead body.    He was glad when the time came and he could tell her that he was going  down to The Corner to find Jack Landis and bring him to her. She rose to  watch him go and he heard her say \"Come soon!\"    It shocked Donnegan into realization that for all her calm exterior she  was perfectly aware of the danger of her position in the wild mining  camp. She must know, also, that her reputation would be compromised; yet  never once had she winced, and Donnegan was filled with wonder as he  went down the hill toward the camp which was spread beneath him; for  their tents were a little detached from the main body of the town.  Behind her gentle eyes, he now felt, and under the softness of her  voice, there was the same iron nerve that was in her father. Her hatred  could be a deathless passion, and her love also; and the great question  to be answered now was, did she truly love Jack Landis?    The Corner at night was like a scene at a circus. There was the same  rush of people, the same irregular flush of lights, the same glimmer of  lanterns through canvas, the same air of impermanence. Once, in one of  those hushes which will fall upon every crowd, he heard a coyote wailing  sharply and far away, as though the desert had sent out this voice to  mock at The Corner and all it contained.    He had only to ask once to discover where Landis was: Milligan's dance  hall. Before Milligan's place a bonfire burned from the beginning of  dusk to the coming of day; and until the time when that fire was  quenched with buckets of water, it was a sign to all that the merriment  was under way in the dance hall. If Lebrun's was the sun of the  amusement world in The Corner, Milligan's was the moon. Everybody who  had money to lose went to Lebrun's. Every one who was out for gayety  went to Milligan's. Milligan was a plunger. He had brought up an  orchestra which demanded fifteen dollars a day and he paid them that and  more. He not only was able to do this, but he established a bar at the  entrance from which all who entered were served with a free drink. The  entrance, also, was not subject to charge. The initial drink at the door  was spiced to encourage thirst, so Milligan made money as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1007"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Paradise (#11)"],[1,"squar'd to fortune's blows.  Therefore my will  Were satisfied to know the lot awaits me,  The arrow, seen beforehand, slacks its flight.\"    So said I to the brightness, which erewhile  To me had spoken, and my will declar'd,  As Beatrice will'd, explicitly.  Nor with oracular response obscure,  Such, as or ere the Lamb of God was slain,  Beguil'd the credulous nations; but, in terms  Precise and unambiguous lore, replied  The spirit of paternal love, enshrin'd,  Yet in his smile apparent; and thus spake:  \"Contingency, unfolded not to view  Upon the tablet of your mortal mold,  Is all depictur'd in the' eternal sight;  But hence deriveth not necessity,  More then the tall ship, hurried down the flood,  Doth from the vision, that reflects the scene.  From thence, as to the ear sweet harmony  From organ comes, so comes before mine eye  The time prepar'd for thee.  Such as driv'n out  From Athens, by his cruel stepdame's wiles,  Hippolytus departed, such must thou  Depart from Florence.  This they wish, and this  Contrive, and will ere long effectuate, there,  Where gainful merchandize is made of Christ,  Throughout the livelong day.  The common cry,  Will, as 't is ever wont, affix the blame  Unto the party injur'd: but the truth  Shall, in the vengeance it dispenseth, find  A faithful witness.  Thou shall leave each thing  Belov'd most dearly: this is the first shaft  Shot from the bow of exile.  Thou shalt prove  How salt the savour is of other's bread,  How hard the passage to descend and climb  By other's stairs, But that shall gall thee most  Will be the worthless and vile company,  With whom thou must be thrown into these straits.  For all ungrateful, impious all and mad,  Shall turn 'gainst thee: but in a little while  Theirs and not thine shall be the crimson'd brow  Their course shall so evince their brutishness  T' have ta'en thy stand apart shall well become thee.    \"First refuge thou must find, first place of rest,  In the great Lombard's courtesy, who bears  Upon the ladder perch'd the sacred bird.  He shall behold thee with such kind regard,  That 'twixt ye two, the contrary to that  Which falls 'twixt other men, the granting shall  Forerun the asking.  With him shalt thou see  That mortal, who was at his birth impress  So strongly from this star, that of his deeds  The nations shall take note.  His unripe age  Yet holds him from observance; for these wheels  Only nine years have compass him about.  But, ere the Gascon practice on great Harry,  Sparkles of virtue shall shoot forth in him,  In equal scorn of labours and of gold.  His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely,  As not to let the tongues e'en of his foes  Be idle in its praise.  Look thou to him  And his beneficence: for he shall cause  Reversal of their lot to many people,  Rich men and beggars interchanging fortunes.  And thou shalt bear this written in thy soul  Of him, but tell it not;\" and things he told  Incredible to those who witness them;  Then added: \"So interpret thou, my son,  What hath been told thee.--Lo! the ambushment  That a few circling seasons hide for thee!  Yet envy not thy neighbours: time extends  Thy span beyond their treason's chastisement.\"    Soon, as the saintly spirit, by his silence,  Had shown the web, which I had streteh'd for him  Upon the warp, was woven, I began,  As one, who in perplexity desires  Counsel of other, wise, benign and friendly:  \"My father! well I mark how time spurs on  Toward me, ready to inflict the blow,  Which falls most heavily on him, who most  Abandoned himself.  Therefore 't is good  I should forecast, that driven from the place  Most dear to me, I may not lose myself  All others by my song.  Down through the world  Of infinite mourning, and along the mount  From whose fair height my lady's eyes did lift me,  And after through this heav'n from light to light,  Have I learnt that, which if I tell again,  It may with many woefully disrelish;  And, if I am a timid friend to truth,  I fear my life may perish among those,  To whom these days shall be of ancient date.\"    The brightness, where enclos'd the treasure smil'd,  Which I had found there, first shone glisteningly,  Like to a golden mirror in the sun;  Next answer'd: \"Conscience, dimm'd or by its own  Or other's shame, will feel thy saying sharp.  Thou, notwithstanding, all deceit remov'd,  See the whole vision be made manifest.  And let them wince who have their withers wrung.  What though, when tasted first, thy voice shall prove  Unwelcome, on digestion it will turn  To vital nourishment.  The cry thou raisest,  Shall, as the wind doth, smite the proudest summits;  Which is of honour no light argument,  For this there only have been shown to thee,  Throughout these orbs, the mountain, and the deep,  Spirits, whom fame hath note of.  For the mind  Of him, who hears, is loth to acquiesce  And fix its faith, unless the instance brought  Be palpable, and proof apparent urge.\"          CANTO XVIII    CANTO XVIII    Now in his word, sole, ruminating, joy'd  That blessed spirit; and I fed on mine,  Tempting the sweet with bitter: she meanwhile,  Who led me unto God, admonish'd: \"Muse  On other thoughts: bethink thee, that near Him  I dwell, who recompenseth every wrong.\"    At the sweet sounds of comfort straight I turn'd;  And, in the saintly eyes what love was seen,  I leave in silence here: nor through distrust  Of my words only, but that to such bliss  The mind remounts not without aid.  Thus much  Yet may I speak; that, as I gaz'd on her,  Affection found no room for other wish.  While the everlasting pleasure, that did full  On Beatrice shine, with second view  From her fair countenance my gladden'd soul  Contented; vanquishing me with a beam  Of her soft smile, she spake: \"Turn thee, and list.  These eyes are not thy only Paradise.\"    As here we sometimes in the looks may see  Th' affection mark'd, when that its sway hath ta'en  The spirit wholly; thus the hallow'd light,  To whom I turn'd, flashing, bewray'd its will  To talk yet further with me, and began:  \"On this fifth lodgment of the tree, whose life  Is from its top, whose fruit is ever fair  And leaf unwith'ring, blessed spirits abide,  That were below, ere they arriv'd in heav'n,  So mighty in renown, as every muse  Might grace her triumph with them.  On the horns  Look therefore of the cross: he, whom I name,  Shall there enact, as doth in summer cloud  Its nimble fire.\"  Along the cross I saw,  At the repeated name of Joshua,  A splendour gliding; nor, the word was said,  Ere it was done: then, at the naming saw  Of the great Maccabee, another move  With whirling speed; and gladness was the scourge  Unto that top.  The next for Charlemagne  And for the peer Orlando, two my gaze  Pursued, intently, as the eye pursues  A falcon flying.  Last, along the cross,  William, and Renard, and Duke Godfrey drew  My ken, and Robert Guiscard.  And the soul,  Who spake with me among the other lights  Did move away, and mix; and with the choir  Of heav'nly songsters prov'd his tuneful skill.    To Beatrice on my right l bent,  Looking for intimation or by word  Or act, what next behoov'd; and did descry  Such mere effulgence in her eyes, such joy,  It past all former wont.  And, as by sense  Of new delight, the man, who perseveres  In good deeds doth perceive from day to day  His virtue growing; I e'en thus perceiv'd  Of my ascent, together with the heav'n  The circuit widen'd, noting the increase  Of beauty in that wonder.  Like the change  In a brief moment on some maiden's cheek,  Which from its fairness doth discharge the weight  Of pudency, that stain'd it; such in her,  And to mine eyes so sudden was the change,  Through silvery whiteness of that temperate star,  Whose sixth orb now enfolded us.  I saw,  Within that Jovial cresset, the clear sparks  Of love, that reign'd there, fashion to my view  Our language.  And as birds, from river banks  Arisen, now in round, now lengthen'd troop,  Array them in their flight, greeting, as seems,  Their new-found pastures; so, within the lights,  The saintly creatures flying, sang, and made  Now D. now I. now L. figur'd I' th' air.    First, singing, to their notes they mov'd, then one  Becoming of these signs, a little while  Did rest them, and were mute.  O nymph divine  Of Pegasean race! whose souls, which thou  Inspir'st, mak'st glorious and long-liv'd, as they  Cities and realms by thee! thou with thyself  Inform me; that I may set forth the shapes,  As fancy doth present them.  Be thy power  Display'd in this brief song.  The characters,  Vocal and consonant, were five-fold seven.  In order each, as they appear'd, I mark'd.  Diligite Justitiam, the first,  Both verb and noun all blazon'd; and the extreme  Qui judicatis terram.  In the M.  Of the fifth word they held their station,  Making the star seem silver streak'd with gold.  And on the summit of the M. I saw  Descending other lights, that rested there,  Singing, methinks, their bliss and primal good.  Then, as at shaking of a lighted brand,  Sparkles innumerable on all sides  Rise scatter'd, source of augury to th' unwise;  Thus more than thousand twinkling lustres hence  Seem'd reascending, and a higher pitch  Some mounting, and some less; e'en as the sun,  Which kindleth them, decreed.  And when each one  Had settled in his place, the head and neck  Then saw I of an eagle, lively  Grav'd in that streaky fire.  Who painteth there,  Hath none to guide him; of himself he guides;  And every line and texture of the nest  Doth own from him the virtue, fashions it.  The other bright beatitude, that seem'd  Erewhile, with lilied crowning, well content  To over-canopy the M. mov'd forth,  Following gently the impress of the bird.     Sweet star! what glorious and thick-studded gems  Declar'd to me our justice on the earth  To be the effluence of that heav'n, which thou,  Thyself a costly jewel, dost inlay!
