Captives, who were able to earn a pittance by hard labor on labor  details or on the farm, could supplement their diet with an occasional  banana, egg, a few peanuts, or a few mongo beans.    A few captives raised small gardens growing vegetables for their own  use. As they ripened, the produce had to be carefully watched to  prevent theft. Some captives trapped stray dogs, some ate lizards,  grasshoppers and even earthworms.    With food from every available source, the daily diet rarely reached  one thousand calories. Fat and salt were almost never available.    Slow Starvation: Starvation, the scourge of the Orient for centuries,  devastated the captives held by the Japanese; it was not a starvation  bred of poverty, but starvation bred of brutality, sadism and neglect.  Murder would have been more humane; execution more legal. A slow,  tortured death, however, was more in keeping with the desire of the  Japanese to make the \"Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor pay dearly  for having challenged 'Dai Nippon.\"    We were hearing so much about the \"Death March\" and \"Camp O'Donnell,\"  I have decided to include several paragraphs on each:    Bataan \"Death March\": The \"Death March\" began April 9th, when the  Japanese General Homma demanded that General King surrender his 80,000  Fil-American forces on Bataan \"Unconditionally.\"    Since Gen. Homma's prizes, Corregidor and the Philippine Islands,  still lay before him, he had no time to worry about the captured  Fil-American forces. His shock troops, tanks, trucks, cars, cavalry,  artillery, and infantry occupied the only highway from Bataan to the  central plain. They were getting into position (on the grounds of  Hospitals I and II) to shell and bomb Corregidor into submission. \"Why  the dirty bastards! They're using us as shields to fire on  Corregidor.\"    At the same time, Japanese guards between Marivales and Limay were  rounding up the 80,000 hungry, sick, confused, and exhausted captives  to march them north on the same highway in groups of one hundred in  columns of four.    Guards were continually barking orders: \"Get on the highway!    Hully! Hully! Hully! Kura! Stop! Get off the load! Speedo! Sona bitch!  Kura! Get on the highway! Stop!\" They used their weapons to enforce  their directives.    The \"March\" began at Marivales, proceeded \"on foot\" for about sixty  miles, then by box car for some twenty miles and finally another ten  miles \"by foot\" to Camp O'Donnell. \"It was hot, hot, hot and dusty!  There was no food; there was no water!\" Most captives did not have  canteens. Those who attempted to fill their canteens in the ditches  besides the road were frequently bayoneted; anyone who couldn't keep  up was slapped, clubbed or    bayoneted in full view of the others.    Heard along the march: \"During the day, we had to travel along the  highway when it was not being used by heavy equipment going south.\"  \"At night, we were placed in barbed wire enclosures; sometimes there  was water; more often there was none.\" \"As the days passed, the stench  of death became very pronounced; bodies were laying along the highway  in all stages of decomposition swollen, bursting open, and covered by  thousands of maggots.\"    The Korean guards were the most abusive. The Japs didn't trust them in  battle, so used them as service troops; the Koreans were anxious to  get blood on their bayonets; and then they thought they were veterans.    \"If you fell, you were dead!\"       \"There were things you didn't want to see! There was the captive  that the Jap trucks and tanks had rolled over until he was just a flat  'silhouette' in the pavement.\"    \"The heat was terrible!\"    \"The Jap kept poking me with his bayonet; fear gave me the strength to  go on.\"       \"To have a close friend a buddy to help you might be the difference  between survival and death.\"    \"As the days passed, the compounds holding captives at night became  filthy; sick and dying almost filled the areas. The dead were not  being buried. The terrible odor was sickening.\"    \"Sometimes when the compounds were crowded, they marched us all  night.\"    \"I had 10,000 teeny blisters on the bottom of my feet.\"       \"The compound was full of people a lot of dust, dirt and filth; I  just fell into the dirt and slept.\"       \"People were going crazy they were 'nuts!' sometimes talking to  themselves, sometimes screaming!\"       \"We all had dysentery, and there was no water. Usually there was no  food.\"       \"We finally reached the train a few box cars with doors closed in  the hot sun they were stifling hot like a furnace.\"       \"We were jammed one hundred to a car standing room only. Men  fainted, but there was no place to fall down.\"       \"They didn't open the door until we reached the destination.    The living and the dead just fell out.\"       \"Sit down and be counted!\"    \"When we had reached Capas, it was pandemonium, Japs and captives all  milling around. They tried to count us as we rested.\"       \"Then we were told to line up-in columns of twos. We started the  march on a dirt road some six miles to Camp O'Donnell.\"       \"Some captives had marched all the way from Bataan close to one  hundred miles.\"    \"It wasn't the march that killed us; it was the continual delays along  the march the standing in place for two or three hours at a time  without food or water.\"          \"If you stepped out of line, you were apt to have a bayonet in  your gut.\"    The exact number of dead from the \"Death March\" was probably known  only to God. The best estimates were anywhere from 12,000 to 17,000.    Deaths at Cabanatuan: During the first eight months of camp, deaths  totaled 2,400. Some thirty to fifty skeletons, covered by leathery  skin, were buried in common graves each day. The Japs issued documents  certifying that each death was caused by malaria, beriberi, pellagra,  diphtheria, in fact, anything but the real cause starvation and  malnutrition.       After the war, when the Graves Registration searched the Cabanatuan  cemeteries, they found and disinterred 2,637 bodies.    Sanitation: From the beginning of camp, sanitation was a serious  problem. Flies, including the blue and green bottle types, were  present everywhere. Maggots thrived in the latrines, weakened the  walls, resulting in cave-ins, and sometimes engulfing the visitor.  Daily rains further weakened the walls.    After several months some engineer officers, under the leadership of  Major Fred Saint of Elmhurst, Illinois, organized a sanitary detail,  and succeeded in building deep septic tank type latrines that would  not cave in. They applied lime daily to control flies and maggots.  Gradually they dug ditches along all walks and around all buildings in  order to promote draining and to prevent quagmires.    Labor Details: The camp had not been in operation many days before the  Japanese requested that the American headquarters furnish labor  details of various sizes and types to work both inside and outside the  camp. Although an occasional detail would be commanded by a very cruel  Jap guard and unbelievable brutality followed, the men on some details  had reasonable guards, received extra food and remained relatively  healthy.    Wood Detail: On good days, a firewood detail went to the forests to  get wood for the mess hall stoves.    Rice Detail: One to three times each week, a rice detail composed of  from five to ten carabao carts, an American driver for each cart, and  several Jap guards, drove to market in the town of Cabanatuan to pick  up one hundred pound bags of rice for the mess halls.    Outside Details: Details were taken to many places in the Philippines  to build and repair roads, bridges and airfields and to load and  unload ships in the port area of Manila. Several details of Americans  were taken to Bataan to make a Japanese movie, entitled Down with the  Stars and Stripes! Periodically, a detail was taken to Japan.    The Farm: After several months of starvation, some hungry captives  suggested to the Japanese that a farm could supply extra food for the  captives and might reduce the high morbidity and mortality rates.    The farm was started with a few farmers and expanded very rapidly.  Groups of one hundred men each were marched out of camp every morning  barefooted to spend the day on the farm.    The farmers worked under many difficulties; the sun became very hot.  Farmers were not allowed to squat down or to bend the knees. They had  to work bent over from the waist. They received only a fifteen minute  yasume (rest period) in the morning and another in the afternoon.  There was much language confusion; much misunderstanding followed by  frequent slapping, kicking or beating.    Nearly every day the Japanese insisted upon larger and larger details  insisted that more and more patients be returned to duty from the  hospital in order to work on the farm. The workers received a small  amount of extra food.       Much to my surprise, many sick patients, that we thought were too  sick for duty, were becoming rather husky farmers.    More to my surprise, the Jap guards soon found they could make extra  money by taking farm products to the market in Cabanatuan city, where  they were sold to the civilians.    Camp Hospital: The hospital was first opened in June, 1942, by Col.  James Gillespie with the mess halls under Major Jim Rinaman. There  were sixty six officers and 183 enlisted men. By July 1st there were  2,300 patients and by August, 2,500.       There were thirty wards (made to hold forty soldiers), often    holding up to one hundred patients. There were upper and lower decks  made of bamboo slats. Each patient was allotted a two-by-six foot  space. Seriously ill were kept on the lower decks.    By Dec. 1st, I had been appointed chief of the medical service; I  tried to see every patient each day. Since medicines were very scarce,  there was actually very little I could do, except give some hope of"]]]
