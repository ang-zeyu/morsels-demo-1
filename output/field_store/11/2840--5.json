His return into England being procured, in order to take possession of  the vast inheritance his father left him, he was knighted by the duke  of Norfolk in her Majesty's presence[3] 1567, and at the same day  advanced to the degree and dignity of a baron of this realm, by the  title of lord Buckhurst: He was of so profuse a temper, that though he  then enjoyed a great estate, yet by his magnificent way of living he  spent more than the income of it, and[4] a story is told of him, 'That  calling on an alderman of London, who had got very considerably by the  loan of his money to him, he was obliged to wait his coming down  so long, as made such an impression on his generous humour, that  thereupon he turned a thrifty improver of his estate.' But others  make him the convert of Queen Elizabeth, (to whom he was allied, his  grandfather having married a lady related to Ann Bullen) who by her  frequent admonitions diverted the torrent of his profusion, and then  received him into her particular favour. Camden says, that in the 14th  of that Princess, he was sent ambassador to Charles IX King of France,  to congratulate his marriage with the Emperor Maximilian's daughter,  and on other important affairs where he was honourably received,  according to his Queen's merit and his own; and having in company  Guido Cavalcanti, a Gentleman of Florence, a person of great  experience, and the Queen-mother being a Florentine, a treaty of  marriage was publickly transacted between Queen Elizabeth and her  son the duke of Anjou. In the 15th of her Majesty he was one of the  peers[5] that sat on the trial of Thomas Howard duke of Norfolk,[6]  and on the 29th of Elizabeth, was nominated one of the commissioners  for the trial of Mary Queen of Scots, and at that time was of the  privy council, but his lordship is not mentioned amongst the peers  who met at Fotheringay Castle and condemned the Queen; yet when the  parliament had confirmed the sentence, he was made choice of to convey  the news to her Majesty, and see their determination put in execution  against that beauteous Princess; possibly because he was a man of fine  accomplishments, and tenderness of disposition, and could manage so  delicate a point with more address than any other courtier. In the  succeeding year he was sent ambassador to the States of the United  Provinces, upon their dislike of the earl of Leicester's proceedings  in a great many respects, there to examine the business, and compose  the difference: He faithfully discharged this invidious office, but  thereby incurred the earl of Leicester's displeasure; who prevailed  with the Queen, as he was her favourite, to call the lord Buckhurst  home, and confine him to his house for nine months; but surviving  that earl, the Queen's favour returned, and he was elected the April  following, without his knowledge, one of the Knights of the most noble  Order of the Garter. He was one of the peers that sat on the trial of  Philip Howard, earl of Arundel. In the 4th year of the Queen's reign  he was joined with the Lord Treasurer Burleigh, in promoting a peace  with Spain; in which trust he was so successful, that the High Admiral  of Holland was sent over by the States, of the United Provinces, to  renew their treaty with the crown of England, being afraid of its  union with Spain. Lord Buckhurst had the sole management of that  negotiation (as Burleigh then lay sick) and Concluded a treaty with  him, by which his mistress was eased of no less than 120,000 l. per  annum, besides other advantages.    His lordship succeeded Sir Christopher Hatton, in the Chancellorship  of the university of Oxford, in opposition to Robert Devereux, earl  of Essex, Master of the Horse to the Queen, who a little before was  incorporated master of arts in the said university, to capacitate him  for that office; but on receipt of letters from her Majesty in favour  of lord Buckhurst, the Academicians elected him Chancellor on the  17th of December following. On the death of lord Burleigh, the Queen  considering the great services he had done his country, which had cost  him immense expences, was pleased to constitute him in the 41st year  of her reign, Lord High Treasurer of England: In the succeeding year  1599, he was in commission with Sir Thomas Egerton, Lord Chancellor,  and the earl of Essex, Earl-Marshal, for negotiating affairs with the  Senate of Denmark, as also in a special commission for suppressing  schism, and afterwards when libels were dispersed by the earl of Essex  and his faction against the Queen, intimating that her Majesty took  little care of the government, and altogether neglected the state of  Ireland,[7] his lordship engaged in a vindication of her Majesty,  and made answers to these libels, representing how brave and well  regulated an army had been sent into Ireland, compleatly furnished  with all manner of provisions, and like wise that her Majesty had  expended on that war in six months time, the sum of 600,000 l. which  lord Essex must own to be true. He suspected that earl's mutinous  designs, by a greater concourse of people resorting to his house than  ordinary, and sent his son to pay him a visit,[8] and to desire him  to be careful of the company he kept. Essex being sensible that  his scheme was already discovered by the penetrating eye of lord  Buckhurst, he and his friends entered upon new measures, and breaking  out into an open rebellion, were obliged to surrender themselves  prisoners. When that unfortunate favourite, together with the earl of  Southampton, was brought to trial, lord Buckhurst was constituted on  that occasion Lord High Steward of England, and passing sentence on  the earl of Essex, his Lordship in a very eloquent speech desired him  to implore the Queen's mercy. After this, it being thought necessary  for the safety of the nation, that some of the leading conspirators  should suffer death, his Lordship advised her Majesty to pardon the  rest. Upon this he had a special commission granted him, together with  secretary Cecil, and the earl of Nottingham, Lord High Admiral, to  call before them all such as were concerned in the conspiracy with the  earls of Essex and Southampton, and to treat and compound with such  offenders for the redemption and composition of their lands. After the  death of Queen Elizabeth, his lordship was concerned in taking the  necessary measures for the security of the kingdom, the administration  being devolved on him and other counsellors, who unanimously  proclaimed King James, and signed a letter March 28, 1603 to the lord  Eure, and the rest of the commissioners, for the treaty of Breme,  notifying her majesty's decease, and the recognition and proclamation  of King James of Scotland: who had such a sense of lord Buckhurst's  services, and superior abilities, that before his arrival in England,  he ordered the renewal of his patent, as Lord High Treasurer for life.  On the 13th of March next ensuing, he was created earl of Dorset,  and constituted one of the commissioners for executing the office  of Earl-Marshal of England, and for reforming sundry abuses in the  College of Arms.    In the year 1608, this great man died suddenly at the Council-Table,  Whitehall, after a bustling life devoted to the public weal; and the  26th of May following, his remains were deposited with great solemnity  in Westminster Abbey, his funeral sermon being preached by Dr. Abbot,  his chaplain, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. Besides this  celebrated sermon of the primate's, in which he is very lavish in  his praise, Lord Chancellor Bacon, and Sir Robert Naunton, bestow  particular encomiums upon him; and Sir Richard Paker observes, \"That  he had excellent parts, and in his place was exceeding industrious,  and that he had heard many exchequer men say, there never was a better  Treasurer, both for the King's profit, and the good of the subject.\"    By his dying suddenly at the Council-Table, his death was interpreted  by some people in a mysterious manner;[9] but his head being opened,  there were found in it certain little bags of water, which, whether by  straining in his study the night before, in which he sat up till 11  o'clock, or otherwise by their own maturity, suddenly breaking, and  falling upon his brain, produced his death, to the universal grief  of the nation, for which he had spent his strength, and for whose  interest, in a very immediate manner, he may be justly said to have  fallen a sacrifice. Of all our court poets he seems to have united the  greatest industry and variety of genius: It is seldom found, that the  sons of Parnassus can devote themselves to public business, or execute  it with success. I have already observed, that the world has lost many  excellent works, which no doubt this cultivated genius would have  accomplished, had he been less involved in court-affairs: but as  he acted in so public a sphere, and discharged every office with  inviolable honour, and consummate prudence, it is perhaps somewhat  selfish in the lovers of poetry, to wish he had wrote more, and acted  less. From him is descended the present noble family of the Dorsets;  and it is remarkable, that all the descendants of this great man have  inherited his taste for liberal arts and sciences, as well as his  capacity for public business. An heir of his was the friend and patron  of Dryden, and is stiled by Congreve the monarch of wit in his time,  and the present age is happy in his illustrious posterity, rivalling  for deeds of honour and renown the most famous of their ancestors.           *       *       *       *       *    INDUCTION to the MIRROR Of MAGISTRATES.

And so Tarzan harangued the moon, and when Goro did not reply, Tarzan  of the Apes waxed wroth.  He swelled his giant chest and bared his  fighting fangs, and hurled into the teeth of the dead satellite the  challenge of the bull ape.    \"You are not Bulamutumumo,\" he cried.  \"You are not king of the jungle  folk.  You are not so great as Tarzan, mighty fighter, mighty hunter.  None there is so great as Tarzan.  If there be a Bulamutumumo, Tarzan  can kill him.  Come down, Goro, great coward, and fight with Tarzan.  Tarzan will kill you.  I am Tarzan, the killer.\"    But the moon made no answer to the boasting of the ape-man, and when a  cloud came and obscured her face, Tarzan thought that Goro was indeed  afraid, and was hiding from him, so he came down out of the trees and  awoke Numgo and told him how great was Tarzan--how he had frightened  Goro out of the sky and made him tremble.  Tarzan spoke of the moon as  HE, for all things large or awe inspiring are male to the ape folk.    Numgo was not much impressed; but he was very sleepy, so he told Tarzan  to go away and leave his betters alone.    \"But where shall I find God?\" insisted Tarzan.  \"You are very old; if  there is a God you must have seen Him.  What does He look like? Where  does He live?\"    \"I am God,\" replied Numgo.  \"Now sleep and disturb me no more.\"    Tarzan looked at Numgo steadily for several minutes, his shapely head  sank just a trifle between his great shoulders, his square chin shot  forward and his short upper lip drew back, exposing his white teeth.  Then, with a low growl he leaped upon the ape and buried his fangs in  the other's hairy shoulder, clutching the great neck in his mighty  fingers.  Twice he shook the old ape, then he released his tooth-hold.    \"Are you God?\" he demanded.    \"No,\" wailed Numgo.  \"I am only a poor, old ape.  Leave me alone.  Go  ask the Gomangani where God is.  They are hairless like yourself and  very wise, too.  They should know.\"    Tarzan released Numgo and turned away.  The suggestion that he consult  the blacks appealed to him, and though his relations with the people of  Mbonga, the chief, were the antithesis of friendly, he could at least  spy upon his hated enemies and discover if they had intercourse with  God.    So it was that Tarzan set forth through the trees toward the village of  the blacks, all excitement at the prospect of discovering the Supreme  Being, the Creator of all things.  As he traveled he reviewed,  mentally, his armament--the condition of his hunting knife, the number  of his arrows, the newness of the gut which strung his bow--he hefted  the war spear which had once been the pride of some black warrior of  Mbonga's tribe.    If he met God, Tarzan would be prepared.  One could never tell whether  a grass rope, a war spear, or a poisoned arrow would be most  efficacious against an unfamiliar foe.  Tarzan of the Apes was quite  content--if God wished to fight, the ape-man had no doubt as to the  outcome of the struggle.  There were many questions Tarzan wished to  put to the Creator of the Universe and so he hoped that God would not  prove a belligerent God; but his experience of life and the ways of  living things had taught him that any creature with the means for  offense and defense was quite likely to provoke attack if in the proper  mood.    It was dark when Tarzan came to the village of Mbonga.  As silently as  the silent shadows of the night he sought his accustomed place among  the branches of the great tree which overhung the palisade.  Below him,  in the village street, he saw men and women.  The men were hideously  painted--more hideously than usual.  Among them moved a weird and  grotesque figure, a tall figure that went upon the two legs of a man  and yet had the head of a buffalo.  A tail dangled to his ankles behind  him, and in one hand he carried a zebra's tail while the other clutched  a bunch of small arrows.    Tarzan was electrified.  Could it be that chance had given him thus  early an opportunity to look upon God? Surely this thing was neither  man nor beast, so what could it be then other than the Creator of the  Universe! The ape-man watched the every move of the strange creature.  He saw the black men and women fall back at its approach as though they  stood in terror of its mysterious powers.    Presently he discovered that the deity was speaking and that all  listened in silence to his words.  Tarzan was sure that none other than  God could inspire such awe in the hearts of the Gomangani, or stop  their mouths so effectually without recourse to arrows or spears.  Tarzan had come to look with contempt upon the blacks, principally  because of their garrulity.  The small apes talked a great deal and ran  away from an enemy.  The big, old bulls of Kerchak talked but little  and fought upon the slightest provocation.  Numa, the lion, was not  given to loquacity, yet of all the jungle folk there were few who  fought more often than he.    Tarzan witnessed strange things that night, none of which he  understood, and, perhaps because they were strange, he thought that  they must have to do with the God he could not understand.  He saw  three youths receive their first war spears in a weird ceremony which  the grotesque witch-doctor strove successfully to render uncanny and  awesome.    Hugely interested, he watched the slashing of the three brown arms and  the exchange of blood with Mbonga, the chief, in the rites of the  ceremony of blood brotherhood.  He saw the zebra's tail dipped into a  caldron of water above which the witch-doctor had made magical passes  the while he danced and leaped about it, and he saw the breasts and  foreheads of each of the three novitiates sprinkled with the charmed  liquid.  Could the ape-man have known the purpose of this act, that it  was intended to render the recipient invulnerable to the attacks of his  enemies and fearless in the face of any danger, he would doubtless have  leaped into the village street and appropriated the zebra's tail and a  portion of the contents of the caldron.    But he did not know, and so he only wondered, not alone at what he saw  but at the strange sensations which played up and down his naked spine,  sensations induced, doubtless, by the same hypnotic influence which  held the black spectators in tense awe upon the verge of a hysteric  upheaval.    The longer Tarzan watched, the more convinced he became that his eyes  were upon God, and with the conviction came determination to have word  with the deity.  With Tarzan of the Apes, to think was to act.    The people of Mbonga were keyed to the highest pitch of hysterical  excitement.  They needed little to release the accumulated pressure of  static nerve force which the terrorizing mummery of the witch-doctor  had induced.    A lion roared, suddenly and loud, close without the palisade.  The  blacks started nervously, dropping into utter silence as they listened  for a repetition of that all-too-familiar and always terrorizing voice.  Even the witch-doctor paused in the midst of an intricate step,  remaining momentarily rigid and statuesque as he plumbed his cunning  mind for a suggestion as how best he might take advantage of the  condition of his audience and the timely interruption.    Already the evening had been vastly profitable to him.  There would be  three goats for the initiation of the three youths into full-fledged  warriorship, and besides these he had received several gifts of grain  and beads, together with a piece of copper wire from admiring and  terrified members of his audience.    Numa's roar still reverberated along taut nerves when a woman's laugh,  shrill and piercing, shattered the silence of the village.  It was this  moment that Tarzan chose to drop lightly from his tree into the village  street.  Fearless among his blood enemies he stood, taller by a full  head than many of Mbonga's warriors, straight as their straightest  arrow, muscled like Numa, the lion.    For a moment Tarzan stood looking straight at the witch-doctor. Every  eye was upon him, yet no one had moved--a paralysis of terror held  them, to be broken a moment later as the ape-man, with a toss of head,  stepped straight toward the hideous figure beneath the buffalo head.    Then the nerves of the blacks could stand no more.  For months the  terror of the strange, white, jungle god had been upon them.  Their  arrows had been stolen from the very center of the village; their  warriors had been silently slain upon the jungle trails and their dead  bodies dropped mysteriously and by night into the village street as  from the heavens above.    One or two there were who had glimpsed the strange figure of the new  demon and it was from their oft-repeated descriptions that the entire  village now recognized Tarzan as the author of many of their ills.  Upon another occasion and by daylight, the warriors would doubtless  have leaped to attack him, but at night, and this night of all others,  when they were wrought to such a pitch of nervous dread by the uncanny  artistry of their witch-doctor, they were helpless with terror.  As one  man they turned and fled, scattering for their huts, as Tarzan  advanced.  For a moment one and one only held his ground.  It was the  witch-doctor. More than half self-hypnotized into a belief in his own  charlatanry he faced this new demon who threatened to undermine his  ancient and lucrative profession.      \"Are you God?\" asked Tarzan.    The witch-doctor, having no idea of the meaning of the other's words,  danced a few strange steps, leaped high in the air, turning completely  around and alighting in a stooping posture with feet far outspread and  head thrust out toward the ape-man. Thus he remained for an instant  before he uttered a loud \"Boo!\" which was evidently intended to  frighten Tarzan away; but in reality had no such effect.    Tarzan did not pause. "]]]
