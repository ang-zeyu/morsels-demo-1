It  was there, and her brother's was fading.    \"I wonder--will he and Jim--meet over there--on the battle-field!\" she  whispered. She hoped they would. Like tigers those boys would fight the  Germans. Her heart beat high. Then a cold wind seemed to blow over her.  It had a sickening weight. If that icy and somber wind could have been  traced to its source, then the mystery of life would have been clear.  But that source was the cause of war, as its effect was the horror of  women. A hideous and monstrous thing existed out there in the darkness.  Lenore passionately loved her brother, and this black thing had taken  him away. Why could not women, who suffered most, have some word in the  regulation of events? If women could help govern the world there would  be no wars.    At last encroaching drowsiness dulled the poignancy of her feelings and  she sank to sleep.          CHAPTER VI    Singing of birds at her window awakened Lenore. The dawn streamed in  bright and sweetly fragrant. The wheat-fields seemed a rosy gold, and  all that open slope called to her thrillingly of the beauty of the world  and the happiness of youth. It was not possible to be morbid at dawn. \"I  hear! I hear!\" she whispered. \"From a thousand slopes far and wide!\"    At the breakfast-table, when there came opportunity, she looked up  serenely and said, \"Father, on second thought I will go the Bend, thank  you!\"    Anderson laid down his knife and fork and his eyes opened wide in  surprise. \"Changed your mind!\" he exclaimed.    \"That's a privilege I have, you know,\" she replied, calmly.    Mrs. Anderson appeared more anxious than surprised. \"Daughter, don't go.  That will be a fearful ride.\"    \"Hum! Sure glad to have you, lass,\" added Anderson, with his keen eyes  on her.    \"Let me go, too,\" begged Rose.    Kathleen was solemnly gazing at Lenore, with the wise, penetrating eyes  of extreme youth.    \"Lenore, I'll bet you've got a new beau up there,\" she declared.    Lenore flushed scarlet. She was less angry with her little sister than  with the incomprehensible fact of a playful word bringing the blood  stingingly to her neck and face.    \"Kitty, you forget your manners,\" she said, sharply.    \"Kit is fresh. She's an awful child,\" added Rose, with a superior air.    \"I didn't say a thing,\" cried Kathleen, hotly. \"Lenore, if it isn't  true, why'd you blush so red?\"    \"Hush, you silly children!\" ordered the mother, reprovingly.    Lenore was glad to finish that meal and to get outdoors. She could smile  now at that shrewd and terrible Kitty, but recollection of her father's  keen eyes was confusing. Lenore felt there was really nothing to blush  for; still, she could scarcely tell her father that upon awakening this  morning she had found her mind made up--that only by going to the Bend  country could she determine the true state of her feelings. She simply  dared not accuse herself of being in unusually radiant spirits because  she was going to undertake a long, hard ride into a barren, desert  country.    The grave and thoughtful mood of last night had gone with her slumbers.  Often Lenore had found problems decided for her while she slept. On this  fresh, sweet summer morning, with the sun bright and warm, presaging a  hot and glorious day, Lenore wanted to run with the winds, to wade  through the alfalfa, to watch with strange and renewed pleasure the  waves of shadow as they went over the wheat. All her life she had known  and loved the fields of waving gold. But they had never been to her what  they had become overnight. Perhaps this was because it had been said  that the issue of the great war, the salvation of the world, and its  happiness, its hope, depended upon the millions of broad acres of golden  grain. Bread was the staff of life. Lenore felt that she was changing  and growing. If anything should happen to her brother Jim she would be  heiress to thousands of acres of wheat. A pang shot through her heart.  She had to drive the cold thought away. And she must learn--must know  the bigness of this question. The women of the country would be called  upon to help, to do their share.    She ran down through the grove and across the bridge, coming abruptly  upon Nash, her father's driver. He had the car out.    \"Good morning,\" he said, with a smile, doffing his cap.    Lenore returned his greeting and asked if her father intended to go  anywhere.    \"No. I'm taking telegrams to Huntington.\"    \"Telegrams? What's the matter with the 'phone?\" she queried.    \"Wire was cut yesterday.\"    \"By I.W.W. men?\"    \"So your father says. I don't know.\"    \"Something ought to be done to those men,\" said Lenore, severely.    Nash was a dark-browed, heavy-jawed young man, with light eyes and hair.  He appeared to be intelligent and had some breeding, but his manner when  alone with Lenore--he had driven her to town several times--was not the  same as when her father was present. Lenore had not bothered her mind  about it. But to-day the look in his eyes was offensive to her.    \"Between you and me, Lenore, I've sympathy for those poor devils,\" he  said.    Lenore drew back rather haughtily at this familiar use of her first  name. \"It doesn't concern me,\" she said, coldly and turned away.    \"Won't you ride along with me? I'm driving around for the mail,\" he  called after her.    \"No,\" returned Lenore, shortly, and hurried on out of earshot. The  impertinence of the fellow!    \"Mawnin', Miss Lenore!\" drawled a cheery voice. The voice and the jingle  of spurs behind her told Lenore of the presence of the best liked of all  her father's men.    \"Good morning, Jake! Where's my dad?\"    \"Wal, he's with Adams, an' I wouldn't be Adams for no money,\" replied  the cowboy.    \"Neither would I,\" laughed Lenore.    \"Reckon you ain't ridin' this mawnin'. You sure look powerful fine, Miss  Lenore, but you can't ride in thet dress.\"    \"Jake, nothing but an aeroplane would satisfy me to-day.\"    \"Want to fly, hey? Wal, excuse me from them birds. I seen one, an'  thet's enough for me.... An', changin' the subject, Miss Lenore, beggin'  your pardon--you ain't ridin' in the car much these days.\"    \"No, Jake, I'm not,\" she replied, and looked at the cowboy. She would  have trusted Jake as she would her brother Jim. And now he looked  earnest.    \"Wal, I'm sure glad. I heerd Nash call an' ask you to go with him. I  seen his eyes when he said it.... Sure I know you'd never look at the  likes of him. But I want to tell you--he ain't no good. I've been  watchin' him. Your dad's orders. He's mixed up with the I.W.W.'s. But  thet ain't what I mean. It's--He's--I--\"    \"Thank you, Jake,\" replied Lenore, as the cowboy floundered. \"I  appreciate your thought of me. But you needn't worry.\"    \"I was worryin' a little,\" he said. \"You see, I know men better 'n your  dad, an' I reckon this Nash would do anythin'.\"    \"What's father keeping him for?\"    \"Wal, Anderson wants to find out a lot about thet I.W.W., an' he ain't  above takin' risks to do it, either.\"    The stable-boys and men Lenore passed all had an eager good morning for  her. She often boasted to her father that she could run \"Many Waters\" as  well as he. Sometimes there were difficulties that Lenore had no little  part in smoothing over. The barns and corrals were familiar places to  her, and she insisted upon petting every horse, in some instances to  Jake's manifest concern.    \"Some of them bosses are bad,\" he insisted.    \"To be sure they are--when wicked cowboys cuff and kick them,\" replied  Lenore, laughingly.    \"Wal, if I'm wicked, I'm a-goin' to war,\" said Jake, reflectively. \"Them  Germans bother me.\"    \"But, Jake, you don't come in the draft age, do you?\"    \"Jest how old do you think I am?\"    \"Sometimes about fourteen, Jake.\"    \"Much obliged. Wal, the fact is I'm over age, but I'll gamble I can pack  a gun an' shoot as straight an' eat as much as any young feller.\"    \"I'll bet so, too, Jake. But I hope you won't go. We absolutely could  not run this ranch without you.\"    \"Sure I knew thet. Wal then, I reckon I'll hang around till you're  married, Miss Lenore,\" he drawled.    Again the scarlet mantled Lenore's cheeks.    \"Good. We'll have many harvests then, Jake, and many rides,\" she  replied.    \"Aw, I don't know--\" he began.    But Lenore ran away so that she could hear no more.    \"What's the matter with me that people--that Jake should--?\" she began,  and ended with a hand on each soft, hot cheek. There was something  different about her, that seemed certain. And if her eyes were as bright  as the day, with its deep blue and white clouds and shining green and  golden fields, then any one might think what he liked and have proof for  his tormenting.    \"But married! I? Not much. Do I want a husband getting shot?\"    The path Lenore trod so lightly led along a great peach and apple  orchard where the trees were set far apart and the soil was cultivated,  so that not a weed nor a blade of grass showed. The fragrance of fruit  in the air, however, did not come from this orchard, for the trees were  young and the reddening fruit rare. Down the wide aisles she saw the  thick and abundant green of the older orchards.    At length Lenore reached the alfalfa-fields, and here among the mounds  of newly cut hay that smelled so fresh and sweet she wanted to roll, and  she had to run. Two great wagons with four horses each were being  loaded. Lenore knew all the workmen except one. Silas Warner, an old,  gray-headed farmer, had been with her father as long as she could  remember.    \"Whar you goin', lass?\" he called, as he halted to wipe his red face  with a huge bandana. \"It's too hot to run the way you're a-doin'.\"    \"Oh, Silas, it's a grand morning!\" she replied.    \"Why, so 'tis! Pitchin' hay hyar made me think it was hot,\" he said, as  she tripped on. \"Now, lass, don't go up to the wheat-fields.\"    But Lenore heard heedlessly, and she ran on till she came to the uncut"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],[0,"Town Geology (#11)"],[1,"inations.  Have you not played with us, as well   as argued with us, till you have inveigled us step by step into a   conclusion which we cannot and will not believe?  That all this land   should have been sunk beneath an icy sea?  That Britain should have   been as Greenland is now?  We can't believe it, and we won't.    If you say so, like stout common-sense Britons, who have a wholesome   dread of being taken in with fine words and wild speculations, I   assure you I shall not laugh at you even in private.  On the   contrary, I shall say--what I am sure every scientific man will say--  So much the better.  That is the sort of audience which we want, if   we are teaching natural science.  We do not want haste, enthusiasm,   gobe-moucherie, as the French call it, which is agape to snap up any   new and vast fancy, just because it is new and vast.  We want our   readers to be slow, suspicious, conservative, ready to \"gib,\" as we   say of a horse, and refuse the collar up a steep place, saying--I   must stop and think.  I don't like the look of the path ahead of me.    It seems an ugly place to get up.  I don't know this road, and I   shall not hurry over it.  I must go back a few steps, and make sure.    I must see whether it is the right road; whether there are not other   roads, a dozen of them perhaps, which would do as well and better   than this.    This is the temper which finds out truth, slowly, but once and for   all; and I shall be glad, not sorry, to see it in my readers.    And I am bound to say that it has been by that temper that this   theory has been worked out, and the existence of this past age of   ice, or glacial epoch, has been discovered, through many mistakes,   many corrections, and many changes of opinion about details, for   nearly forty years of hard work, by many men, in many lands.    As a very humble student of this subject, I may say that I have been   looking these facts in the face earnestly enough for more than twenty   years, and that I am about as certain that they can only be explained   by ice, as I am that my having got home by rail can only be explained   by steam.    But I think I know what startles you.  It is the being asked to   believe in such an enormous change in climate, and in the height of   the land above the sea.  Well--it is very astonishing, appalling--all   but incredible, if we had not the facts to prove it.  But of the   facts there can be no doubt.  There can be no doubt that the climate   of this northern hemisphere has changed enormously more than once.    There can be no doubt that the distribution of land and water, the   shape and size of its continents and seas, have changed again and   again.  There can be no doubt that, for instance, long before the age   of ice, the whole North of Europe was much warmer than it is now.    Take Greenland, for instance.  Disco Island lies in Baffin's Bay, off   the west coast of Greenland, in latitude 70 degrees, far within the   Arctic circle.  Now there certain strata of rock, older than the ice,   have not been destroyed by the grinding of the ice-cap; and they are   full of fossil plants.  But of what kind of plants?  Of the same   families as now grow in the warmer parts of the United States.  Even   a tulip-tree has been found among them.  Now how is this to be   explained?    Either we must say that the climate of Greenland was then so much   warmer than now, that it had summers probably as hot as those of New   York; or we must say that these leaves and stems were floated thither   from the United States.  But if we say the latter, we must allow a   change in the shape of the land which is enormous.  For nothing now   can float northward from the United States into Baffin's Bay.  The   polar current sets OUT of Baffin's Bay southward, bringing icebergs   down, not leaves up, through Davis's Straits.  And in any case we   must allow that the hills of Disco Island were then the bottom of a   sea:  or how would the leaves have been deposited in them at all?    So much for the change of climate and land which can be proved to   have gone on in Greenland.  It has become colder.  Why should it not   some day become warmer again?    Now for England.  It can be proved, as far as common sense can prove   anything, that England was, before the age of ice, much warmer than   it is now, and grew gradually cooler and cooler, just as, while the   age of ice was dying out, it grew warmer again.    Now what proof is there of that?    This.  Underneath London--as, I dare say, many of you know--there   lies four or five hundred feet of clay.  But not ice-clay.  Anything   but that, as you will see.  It belongs to a formation late   (geologically speaking), but somewhat older than those Disco Island   beds.    And what sort of fossils do we find in it?    In the first place, the shells, which are abundant, are tropical--  Nautili, Cones, and such like.  And more, fruits and seeds are found   in it, especially at the Isle of Sheppey.  And what are they?  Fruits   of Nipa palms, a form only found now at river-mouths in Eastern India   and the Indian islands; Anona-seeds; gourd-seeds; Acacia fruits--all   tropical again; and Proteaceous plants too--of an Australian type.    Surely your common sense would hint to you, that this London clay   must be mud laid down off the mouth of a tropical river.  But your   common sense would be all but certain of that, when you found, as you   would find, the teeth and bones of crocodiles and turtles, who come   to land, remember, to lay their eggs; the bones, too, of large   mammals, allied to the tapir of India and South America, and the   water-hog of the Cape.  If all this does not mean that there was once   a tropic climate and a tropic river running into some sea or other   where London now stands, I must give up common sense and reason as   deceitful and useless faculties; and believe nothing, not even the   evidence of my own senses.    And now, have I, or have I not, fulfilled the promise which I made--  rashly, I dare say some of you thought--in my first paper?  Have I,   or have I not, made you prove to yourself, by your own common sense,   that the lowlands of Britain were underneath the sea in the days in   which these pebbles and boulders were laid down over your plains?    Nay, have we not proved more?  Have we not found that that old sea   was an icy sea?  Have we not wandered on, step by step, into a whole   true fairyland of wonders? to a time when all England, Scotland, and   Ireland were as Greenland is now? when mud streams have rushed down   from under glaciers on to a cold sea-bottom, when \"ice, mast high,   came floating by, as green as emerald?\" when Snowdon was sunk for at   least fourteen hundred feet of its height? when (as I could prove to   you, had I time) the peaks of the highest Cumberland and Scotch   mountains alone stood out, as islets in a frozen sea?    We want to get an answer to one strange question, and we have found a   group of questions stranger still, and got them answered too.  But so   it is always in science.  We know not what we shall discover.  But   this, at least, we know, that it will be far more wonderful than we   had dreamed.  The scientific explorer is always like Saul of old, who   set out simply to find his father's asses, and found them--and a   kingdom besides.    I should have liked to have told you more about this bygone age of   ice.  I should have liked to say something to you on the curious   question--which is still an open one--whether there were not two ages   of ice; whether the climate here did not, after perhaps thousands of   years of Arctic cold, soften somewhat for a while--a few thousand   years, perhaps--and then harden again into a second age of ice,   somewhat less severe, probably, than the first.  I should have liked   to have hinted at the probable causes of this change--indeed, of the   age of ice altogether--whether it was caused by a change in the   distribution of land and water, or by change in the height and size   of these islands, which made them large enough, and high enough, to   carry a sheet of eternal snow inland; or whether, finally, the age of   ice was caused by an actual change in the position of the whole   planet with regard to its orbit round the sun--shifting at once the   poles and the tropics; a deep question that latter, on which   astronomers, whose business it is, are still at work, and on which,   ere young folk are old, they will have discovered, I expect, some   startling facts.  On that last question, I, being no astronomer,   cannot speak.  But I should have liked to have said somewhat on   matters on which I have knowledge enough, at least, to teach you how   much there is to be learnt.  I should have liked to tell the student   of sea-animals--how the ice-age helps to explain, and is again   explained by, the remarkable discoveries which Dr. Carpenter and Mr.   Wyville Thompson have just made, in the deep-sea dredgings in the   North Atlantic.  I should have liked to tell the botanist somewhat of   the pro-glacial flora--the plants which lived here before the ice,   and lasted, some of them at least, through all those ages of fearful   cold, and linger still on the summits of Snowdon, and the highest   peaks of Cumberland and Scotland.  I should have liked to have told   the lovers of zoology about the animals which lived before the ice--  of the mammoth, or woolly elephant; the woolly rhinoceros, the cave   lion and bear, the reindeer, the musk oxen, the lemmings and the   marmots which inhabited Britain till the ice drove them out   southward, even into the South of France; and how as the ice   retreated, and the climate became tolerable once more, some of them--  the mammoth and rhinoceros, the bison, the lion, and many another   mighty beast reoccupied our lowlands, at a time when the   hippopotamus, at least in summer, ranged freely from Africa and Spain   across what was "]]]
