The ambassadors had a magnificent reception; splendid presents  and entertainments were given them; but no answer was made to their  demands; they were only told that the King of France was about to send an  embassy to the King of England.  It did not set out before the 27th of  the following April; the Archbishop of Bourges, the most eloquent prelate  in the council, was its spokesman; and it had orders to offer the King of  England the hand of the Princess Catherine with a dowry of eight hundred  and forty thousand golden crowns, besides fifteen towns in Aquitaine and  the seneschalty of Limoges.  Henry V. rejected these offers, declaring  that, if he did not get Normandy and all the districts ceded by the  treaty of Bretigny, he would have recourse to war to recover a crown  which belonged to him.  To this arrogant language the Archbishop of  Bourges replied, \"O king, what canst thou be thinking of that thou  wouldst fain thus oust the King of the French, our lord, the most noble  and excellent of Christian kings, from the throne of so powerful a  kingdom?  Thinkest thou that it is for fear of thee and of the English  that he hath made thee an offer of his daughter together with so great a  sum and a portion of his land?  Nay, verily; he was moved by pity and the  love of peace; he would not that the innocent blood should be spilt and  Christian people destroyed in the hurly-burly of battle.  He will invoke  the aid of God Almighty, of the blessed virgin Mary, and of all the  saints.  Then by his own arms and those of his loyal subjects, vassals,  and allies, thou wilt be driven from his kingdom, and, peradventure, meet  with death or capture.\"    On returning to Paris the ambassadors, in presence of the king's council  and a numerous assembly of clergy, nobility, and people, gave an account  of their embassy and advised instant preparation for war without  listening to a single word of peace.  \"They loudly declared,\" says the  monk of St. Denis, \"that King Henry's letters, though they were  apparently full of moderation, had lurking at the bottom of them a great  deal of perfidy, and that this king, all the time that he was offering  peace and union in the most honeyed terms, was thinking only how he might  destroy the kingdom, and was levying troops in all quarters.\"  Henry V.,  indeed, in November, 1414, demanded of his Parliament a large subsidy,  which was at once voted without any precise mention of the use to be made  of it, and merely in the terms following: \"For the defence of the realm  of England and the security of the seas.\"  At the commencement of the  following year, Henry resumed negotiations with France, renouncing his  claims to Normandy, Anjou, and Maine; but Charles VI. and his council  adhered to their former offers.  On the 16th of April, 1415, Henry  announced to a grand council of spiritual and temporal peers, assembled  at Westminster, his determination \"of setting out in person to go and, by  God's grace, recover his heritage.\"  He appointed one of his brothers,  the Duke of Bedford, to be regent in his absence, and the peers,  ecclesiastical and laical, applauded his design, promising him their  sincere co-operation.  Thus France, under a poor mad king and amidst  civil dissensions of the most obstinate character, found the question  renewed for her of French versus English king-ship and national  independence versus foreign conquest.    On the 14th of August, 1415, an English fleet, having on board, together  with King Henry V., six thousand men-at-arms, twenty-four thousand  archers, powerful war-machines, and a multitude of artisans and \"small  folk,\" came to land near Harfleur, not far from the mouth of the Seine.  It was the most formidable expedition that had ever issued from the ports  of England.  The English spent several days in effecting their landing  and setting up their siege-train around the walls of the city.  \"It would  have been easy,\" says the monk of St. Denis, \"to hinder their operations,  and the inhabitants of the town and neighborhood would have worked  thereat with zeal, if they had not counted that the nobility of the  district and the royal army commanded by the constable, Charles d'Albret,  would come to their aid.\"  No one came.  The burgesses and the small  garrison of Harfleur made a gallant defence; but, on the 22d of  September, not receiving from Vernon, where the king and the _dauphin_  were massing their troops, any other assistance than the advice to \"take  courage and trust to the king's discretion,\" they capitulated; and Henry  V., after taking possession of the place, advanced into the country with  an army already much reduced by sickness, looking for a favorable point  at which to cross the Somme and push his invasion still farther.  It was  not until the 19th of October that he succeeded, at Bethencourt, near St.  Quentin.  Charles VI., who at that time had a lucid interval, after  holding at Rouen a council of war, at which it was resolved to give the  English battle, wished to repair with the _dauphin_, his son, to Bapaume,  where the French army had taken position; but his uncle, the Duke of  Berry, having still quite a lively recollection of the battle of  Poitiers, fought fifty-nine' years before, made opposition, saying,  \"Better lose the battle than the king and the battle.\"  All the princes  of the royal blood and all the flower of the French nobility, except the  king and his three sons, and the Dukes of Berry, Brittany, and Burgundy,  joined the army.  The Dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, and the Constable  d'Albret, who was in command, sent to ask the King of England on what day  and at what place he would be pleased to give them battle.  \"I do not  shut myself up in walled towns,\" replied Henry; \"I shall be found at any  time and any where ready to fight, if any attempt be made to cut off my  march.\"  The French resolved to stop him between Agincourt and  Framecourt, a little north of St. Paul and Hesdin.  The encounter took  place on the 25th of October, 1415.  It was a monotonous and lamentable  repetition of the disasters of Crecy and Poitiers; disasters almost  inevitable, owing to the incapacity of the leaders and ever the same  defects on the part of the French nobility, defects which rendered their  valorous and generous qualities not only fruitless, but fatal.  Never had  that nobility been more numerous and more brilliant than in this  premeditated struggle.  On the eve of the battle, Marshal de Boucicaut  had armed five hundred new knights; the greater part passed the night on  horse-back, under arms, on ground soaked with rain; and men and horses  were already distressed in the morning, when the battle began.  It were  tedious to describe the faulty manoeuvres of the French army and their  deplorable consequences on that day.  Never was battle more stubborn or  defeat more complete and bloody.  Eight thousand men of family, amongst  whom were a hundred and twenty lords bearing their own banners, were left  on the field of battle.  The Duke of Brabant, the Count of Nevers, the  Duke of Bar, the Duke of Alencon, and the Constable d'Albret were killed.  The Duke of Orleans was dragged out wounded from under the dead.  When  Henry V., after having spent several hours on the field of battle,  retired to his quarters, he was told that the Duke of Orleans would  neither eat nor drink.  He went to see him.  \"What fare, cousin?\" said  he.  \"Good, my lord.\"  \"Why will you not eat or drink?\" \"I wish to fast.\"  \"Cousin,\" said the king, gently, \"make good cheer: if God has granted me  grace to gain the victory, I know it is not owing to my deserts; I  believe that God wished to punish the French; and, if all I have heard  is true, it is no wonder, for they say that never were seen disorder,  licentiousness, sins, and vices like what is going on in France just now.  Surely, God did well to be angry.\"  It appears that the King of England's  feeling was that also of many amongst the people of France.  \"On  reflecting upon this cruel mishap,\" says the monk of St. Denis, \"all the  inhabitants of the kingdom, men and women, said, 'In what evil days are  we come into this world that we should be witnesses of such confusion and  shame!'\"  During the battle the eldest son of Duke John the Fearless, the  young Count of Charolais (at that time nineteen), who was afterwards  Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, was at the castle of Aire, where his  governors kept him by his father's orders and prevented him from joining  the king's army.  His servants were leaving him one after another to go  and defend the kingdom against the English.    [Illustration: Already distressed----57]    When he heard of the disaster at Agincourt he was seized with profound  despair at having failed in that patriotic duty; he would fain have  starved himself to death, and he spent three whole days in tears, none  being able to comfort him.  When, four years afterwards, he became Duke  of Burgundy, and during his whole life, he continued to testify his keen  regret at not having fought in that cruel battle, though it should have  cost him his life, and he often talked with his servants about that event  of grievous memory.  When his father, Duke John, received the news of the  disaster at Agincourt, he also exhibited great sorrow and irritation; he  had lost by it his two brothers, the Duke of Brabant and the Count of  Nevers; and he sent forthwith a herald to the King of England, who was  still at Calais, with orders to say, that in consequence of the death of  his brother, the Duke of Brabant, who was no vassal of France, and held  nothing in fief there, he, the Duke of Burgundy, did defy him mortally  (fire and sword) and sent him his gauntlet.  \"I will not accept the  gauntlet of so noble and puissant a prince as the Duke of Burgundy,\" was  Henry V.'s soft answer; \"I am of no account"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11954"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 4 (#11)"],[1," which the king's government  treated him soon revealed to him his real position: the advances he had  made and the debts he had contracted for the service of the crown in  Milaness, nay, his salary as constable and his personal pensions, were  unpaid.  Was this the effect of secret wrath on the part of the  queen-mother, hurt because he seemed to disdain her good graces, or an  act arising may be from mistrust and may be from carelessness on the  king's part, or merely a result of the financial disorder into which the  affairs of Francis I. were always falling?  These questions cannot be  solved with certainty.  Anyhow the constable, though thus maltreated,  did not cry out; but his royal patroness and mother-in-law, Anne of  France, daughter of Louis XI., dowager-duchess of the house of Bourbon,  complained of these proceedings to the king's mother, and uttered the  word ingratitude. The dispute between the two princesses grew rancorous;  the king intervened to reconcile them; speedy payment was promised of  all that was due to the constable, but the promise was not kept.  The  constable did not consider it seemly to wait about; so he quitted the  court and withdrew into his own duchy, to Moulins, not openly disgraced,  but resolved to set himself, by his proud independence, above the reach  of ill-will, whether on the king's part or his mother's.    Moulins was an almost kingly residence.  \"The dukes,\" said the Venetian  traveller Andrew Navagero, in 1528, \"have built there fortress-wise a  magnificent palace, with beautiful gardens, groves, fountains, and all  the sumptuous appliances of a prince's dwelling.\"  No sooner did the  constable go to reside there than numbers of the nobility flocked thither  around him.  The feudal splendor of this abode was shortly afterwards  enhanced by an auspicious domestic incident.  In 1517 the Duchess of  Bourbon was confined there of a son, a blessing for some time past  unhoped for.  The delighted constable determined to make of the child's  baptism a great and striking event; and he begged the king to come and be  godfather, with the dowager Duchess of Bourbon as godmother.  Francis I.  consented and repaired to Moulins with his mother and nearly all his  court.  The constable's magnificence astonished even the magnificent king  \"five hundred gentlemen, all clad in velvet, and all wearing a chain of  gold going three times round the neck,\" were in habitual attendance upon  the duke; \"the throng of the invited was so great that neither the castle  of Moulins nor the town itself sufficed to lodge them; tents had to be  pitched in the public places, in the streets, in the park.\"  Francis I.  could not refrain from saying that a King of France would have much  difficulty in making such a show; the queen-mother did not hide her  jealousy; regal temper came into collision with feudal pride.  Admiral  Bonnivet, a vassal of the constable and a favorite of the king, was  having built, hard by Chatellerault, a castle so vast and so magnificent,  \"that he seemed,\" says Brantome, \"to be minded to ride the high horse  over the house of M. de Bourbon, in such wise that it should appear only  a nest beside his own.\"  Francis I., during a royal promenade, took the  constable one day to see the edifice the admiral was building, and asked  him what he thought of it.  \"I think,\" said Bourbon, \"that the cage is  too big and too fine for the bird.\"  \"Ah!\" said the king, \"do you not  speak with somewhat of envy?\"  \"I!\" cried the constable; \"I feel envy of  a gentleman whose ancestors thought themselves right happy to be squires  to mine!\"  In their casual and familiar conversations the least pretext  would lead to sharp words between the Duke of Bourbon and his kingly  guest.  The king was rallying him one day on the attachment he was  suspected of having felt for a lady of the court.  \"Sir,\" said the  constable, \"what you have just said has no point for me, but a good deal  for those who were not so forward as I was in the lady's good graces.\"  [At this period princes of the blood, when speaking to the king, said  Monsieur; when they wrote to him, they called him Monseigneur.]  Francis  I., to whom this scarcely veiled allusion referred, was content to reply,  \"Ah! my dear cousin, you fly out at everything, and you are mighty  short-tempered.\"  The nickname of short-tempered stuck to the constable  from that day, and not without reason.  With anybody but the king the  constable was a good deal more than short-tempered the chancellor,  Duprat, who happened to be at Moulins, and who had a wish to become  possessed of two estates belonging to the constable, tried to worm  himself into his good graces; but Bourbon gave him sternly to understand  with what contempt he regarded him, and Duprat, who had hitherto been  merely the instrument of Louise of Savoy's passions, so far as the duke  was concerned, became henceforth his personal enemy, and did not wait  long for an opportunity of making the full weight of his enmity felt.  The king's visit to Moulins came to an end without any settlement of  the debts due from the royal treasury to the constable.  Three years  afterwards, in 1520, he appeared with not a whit the less magnificence  at the Field of Cloth of Gold, where he was one of the two great lords  chosen by Francis I. to accompany him at his interview with Henry VIII.;  but the constable had to put up with the disagreeableness of having for  his associate upon that state occasion Admiral Bonnivet, whom he had but  lately treated with so much hauteur, and his relations towards the court  were by no means improved by the honor which the king conferred upon him  in summoning him to his side that day.  Henry VIII., who was struck by  this vassal's haughty bearing and looks, said to Francis I., \"If I had a  subject like that in my kingdom, I would not leave his head very long on  his shoulders.\"    More serious causes of resentment came to aggravate a situation already  so uncomfortable.  The war, which had been a-hatching ever since the  imperial election at Frankfort, burst out in 1521, between Francis I.  and Charles V.  Francis raised four armies in order to face it on all his  frontiers, in Guienne, in Burgundy, in Champagne, and in Picardy, \"where  there was no army,\" says Du Bellai, \"however small.\"  None of these great  commands was given to the Duke of Bourbon; and when the king summoned him  to the army of Picardy, whither he repaired in all haste with six  thousand foot and three hundred men-at-arms raised in his own states,  the command of the advance-guard, which belonged to him by right of his  constableship, was given to the Duke of Alencon, who had nothing to  recommend him beyond the fact that he was the husband of Marguerite de  Valois and brother-in-law of the king.  Bourbon deeply resented this  slight; and it was remarked that he frequently quoted with peculiar  meaning a reply made by a Gascon gentleman to King Charles VII., who had  asked him if anything could shake his fidelity, \"Nothing, sir, nothing;  not even an offer of three such kingdoms as yours; but an affront might.\"  The constable did not serve a whit the less valiantly and brilliantly in  this campaign of Picardy; he surprised and carried the town of Hesdin,  which was defended by a strong garrison; but after the victory he treated  with a generosity which was not perhaps free from calculation the  imperialist nobility shut up in the castle; he set all his prisoners at  large, and paid particular attention to the Countess de Roeux, of the  house of Croy, whom he knew to have influence with Charles V.  He was  certainly not preparing just then to abandon the King of France and go  over to the camp of the emperor; but he was sufficiently irritated  against Francis I. to gladly seize an opportunity of making new friends  on the rival side.    Meanwhile there occurred the event which was to decide his conduct and  his destiny.  His wife, Suzanne of Bourbon, died at Chatellerault, in  April, 1521, after having lost the son whose birth had been celebrated  with such brilliancy at Moulins, and having confirmed by her will the  settlement upon her husband of all her possessions, which had already  been conferred upon him by their marriage contract.  From whom came the  first idea of the proposal to which this death was ere long to lead?  Was  it the chancellor, Duprat, who told the mother of Francis I. that the  will and the settlement might be disputed at law, and that she would then  enter into possession of a great part of what belonged to the House of  Bourbon?  Was it Louise of Savoy herself who conceived the hope of  satisfying at one and the same time her cupidity and the passion she felt  for the constable, by having an offer made to him of her hand, with the  retention secured to him of those great possessions which, otherwise,  would be disputed, and which a decree of Parliament might take away from  him?  Between these two explanations of what occurred at that time, there  is no certain choice afforded by historical documents; but the more  reasonable conviction is, that the passion of Louise of Savoy was the  first and the decisive cause of the proposal made to the constable.  He  was then thirty years old; Louise of Savoy was forty-five, but she was  still beautiful, attractive, and puissant; she had given the constable  unmistakable proofs of her inclination for him and of the influence which  his inclinations exercised over her: she might well flatter herself that  he would be attracted by the prospect of becoming the king's step-father  and almost a sharer in the kingly power, whilst retaining that of the  great feudal lord.  The chancellor, Duprat, full of ability and  servility, put all his knowledge, all his subtlety in argument, and all  his influence in the Parliament at the disposal of Madame Louise, who, as  a nearer relative than the constable, claimed the possessions left by his  wife,"]]]
