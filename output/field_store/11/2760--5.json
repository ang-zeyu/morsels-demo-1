And I had a liking too  for the tender way in which they often spoke of Durl and Duz, for it is  good that men should love their native cities and the little hills that  hold those cities up.    And I had come to know who would meet them when they returned to their  homes, and where they thought the meetings would take place, some in a  valley of the Acroctian hills where the road comes up from Yann, others in  the gateway of one or another of the three cities, and others by the  fireside in the home. And I thought of the danger that had menaced us all  alike outside Perdondaris, a danger that, as things have happened, was  very real.    And I thought too of the helmsman's cheery song in the cold and lonely  night, and how he had held our lives in his careful hands. And as I  thought of this the helmsman ceased to sing, and I looked up and saw a  pale light had appeared in the sky, and the lonely night had passed; and  the dawn widened, and the sailors awoke.    And soon we saw the tide of the Sea himself advancing resolute between  Yann's borders, and Yann sprang lithely at him and they struggled awhile;  then Yann and all that was his were pushed back northward, so that the  sailors had to hoist the sails and, the wind being favorable, we still  held onwards.    And we passed Gondara and Narl and Haz. And we saw memorable, holy Golnuz,  and heard the pilgrims praying.    When we awoke after the midday rest we were coming near to Nen, the last  of the cities on the River Yann. And the jungle was all about us once  again, and about Nen; but the great Mloon ranges stood up over all things,  and watched the city from beyond the jungle.    Here we anchored, and the captain and I went up into the city and found  that the Wanderers had come into Nen.    And the Wanderers were a weird, dark, tribe, that once in every seven  years came down from the peaks of Mloon, having crossed by a pass that is  known to them from some fantastic land that lies beyond. And the people of  Nen were all outside their houses, and all stood wondering at their own  streets. For the men and women of the Wanderers had crowded all the ways,  and every one was doing some strange thing. Some danced astounding dances  that they had learned from the desert wind, rapidly curving and swirling  till the eye could follow no longer. Others played upon instruments  beautiful wailing tunes that were full of horror, which souls had taught  them lost by night in the desert, that strange far desert from which the  Wanderers came.    None of their instruments were such as were known in Nen nor in any part  of the region of the Yann; even the horns out of which some were made were  of beasts that none had seen along the river, for they were barbed at the  tips. And they sang, in the language of none, songs that seemed to be akin  to the mysteries of night and to the unreasoned fear that haunts dark  places.    Bitterly all the dogs of Nen distrusted them. And the Wanderers told one  another fearful tales, for though no one in Nen knew ought of their  language yet they could see the fear on the listeners' faces, and as the  tale wound on the whites of their eyes showed vividly in terror as the  eyes of some little beast whom the hawk has seized. Then the teller of the  tale would smile and stop, and another would tell his story, and the  teller of the first tale's lips would chatter with fear. And if some  deadly snake chanced to appear the Wanderers would greet him as a brother,  and the snake would seem to give his greetings to them before he passed on  again. Once that most fierce and lethal of tropic snakes, the giant  lythra, came out of the jungle and all down the street, the central street  of Nen, and none of the Wanderers moved away from him, but they all played  sonorously on drums, as though he had been a person of much honour; and  the snake moved through the midst of them and smote none.    Even the Wanderers' children could do strange things, for if any one of  them met with a child of Nen the two would stare at each other in silence  with large grave eyes; then the Wanderers' child would slowly draw from  his turban a live fish or snake. And the children of Nen could do nothing  of that kind at all.    Much I should have wished to stay and hear the hymn with which they greet  the night, that is answered by the wolves on the heights of Mloon, but it  was now time to raise the anchor again that the captain might return from  Bar-Wul-Yann upon the landward tide. So we went on board and continued  down the Yann. And the captain and I spoke little, for we were thinking of  our parting, which should be for long, and we watched instead the  splendour of the westerning sun. For the sun was a ruddy gold, but a faint  mist cloaked the jungle, lying low, and into it poured the smoke of the  little jungle cities, and the smoke of them met together in the mist and  joined into one haze, which became purple, and was lit by the sun, as the  thoughts of men become hallowed by some great and sacred thing. Some times  one column from a lonely house would rise up higher than the cities'  smoke, and gleam by itself in the sun.    And now as the sun's last rays were nearly level, we saw the sight that I  had come to see, for from two mountains that stood on either shore two  cliffs of pink marble came out into the river, all glowing in the light of  the low sun, and they were quite smooth and of mountainous altitude, and  they nearly met, and Yann went tumbling between them and found the sea.    And this was Bar-Wul-Yann, the Gate of Yann, and in the distance through  that barrier's gap I saw the azure indescribable sea, where little  fishing-boats went gleaming by.    And the sun set, and the brief twilight came, and the exultation of the  glory of Bar-Wul-Yann was gone, yet still the pink cliffs glowed, the  fairest marvel that the eye beheld--and this in a land of wonders. And  soon the twilight gave place to the coming out of stars, and the colours  of Bar-Wul-Yann went dwindling away. And the sight of those cliffs was to  me as some chord of music that a master's hand had launched from the  violin, and which carries to Heaven or Faery the tremulous spirits of men.    And now by the shore they anchored and went no further, for they were  sailors of the river and not of the sea, and knew the Yann but not the  tides beyond.    And the time was come when the captain and I must part, he to go back to  his fair Belzoond in sight of the distant peaks of the Hian Min, and I to  find my way by strange means back to those hazy fields that all poets  know, wherein stand small mysterious cottages through whose windows,  looking westwards, you may see the fields of men, and looking eastwards  see glittering elfin mountains, tipped with snow, going range on range  into the region of Myth, and beyond it into the kingdom of Fantasy, which  pertain to the Lands of Dream. Long we regarded one another, knowing that  we should meet no more, for my fancy is weakening as the years slip by,  and I go ever more seldom into the Lands of Dream. Then we clasped hands,  uncouthly on his part, for it is not the method of greeting in his  country, and he commended my soul to the care of his own gods, to his  little lesser gods, the humble ones, to the gods that bless Belzoond.          THE SWORD AND THE IDOL      It was a cold winter's evening late in the Stone Age; the sun had gone  down blazing over the plains of Thold; there were no clouds, only the  chill blue sky and the imminence of stars; and the surface of the sleeping  Earth began to harden against the cold of the night. Presently from their  lairs arose, and shook themselves and went stealthily forth, those of  Earth's children to whom it is the law to prowl abroad as soon as the dusk  has fallen. And they went pattering softly over the plain, and their eyes  shone in the dark, and crossed and recrossed one another in their courses.  Suddenly there became manifest in the midst of the plain that fearful  portent of the presence of Man--a little flickering fire. And the children  of Earth who prowl abroad by night looked sideways at it and snarled and  edged away; all but the wolves, who came a little nearer, for it was  winter and the wolves were hungry, and they had come in thousands from the  mountains, and they said in their hearts, \"We are strong.\" Around the fire  a little tribe was encamped. They, too, had come from the mountains, and  from lands beyond them, but it was in the mountains that the wolves first  winded them; they picked up bones at first that the tribe had dropped, but  they were closer now and on all sides. It was Loz who had lit the fire. He  had killed a small furry beast, hurling his stone axe at it, and had  gathered a quantity of reddish-brown stones, and had laid them in a long  row, and placed bits of the small beast all along it; then he lit a fire  on each side, and the stones heated, and the bits began to cook. It was at  this time that the tribe noticed that the wolves who had followed them so  far were no longer content with the scraps of deserted encampments. A line  of yellow eyes surrounded them, and when it moved it was to come nearer.  So the men of the tribe hastily tore up brushwood, and felled a small tree  with their flint axes, and heaped it all over the fire that Loz had made,  and for a while the great heap hid the flame, and the wolves came trotting  in and sat down again on their haunches much closer than before; and the  fierce and valiant dogs that belonged to the tribe believed that their end  was about to come while fighting, as they had long since prophesied it  would. Then the flame caught the lofty stack of brushwood, and rushed out  of it, and ran up the side of it, and stood up haughtily far over the top,  and the wolves seeing this terrible ally of Man reveling there in his  strength,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/813"],[0,"Reminiscences of Tolstoy, (#10)"],[1,"you. That is my  fault. And I wish to remedy it. I know much in you that I do not like,  but I do not know everything. As for your proposed journey home, I think  that in your position of student, not only student of a gymnase, but  at the age of study, it is better to gad about as little as possible;  moreover, all useless expenditure of money that you can easily refrain  from is immoral, in my opinion, and in yours, too, if you only consider  it. If you come, I shall be glad for my own sake, so long as you are not  inseparable from G----.    Do as you think best. But you must work, both with your head, thinking  and reading, and with your heart; that is, find out for yourself what is  really good and what is bad, although it seems to be good. I kiss you.                                                           L. T.    Dear Friend Ilya:    There is always somebody or something that prevents me from answering  your two letters, which are important and dear to me, especially the  last. First it was Baturlin, then bad health, insomnia, then the arrival  of D----, the friend of H---- that I wrote you about. He is sitting at  tea talking to the ladies, neither understanding the other; so I left  them, and want to write what little I can of all that I think about you.    Even supposing that S---- A---- demands too much of you, [19] there is  no harm in waiting; especially from the point of view of fortifying your  opinions, your faith. That is the one important thing. If you don't, it  is a fearful disaster to put off from one shore and not reach the other.    The one shore is an honest and good life, for your own delight and the  profit of others. But there is a bad life, too--a life so sugared, so  common to all, that if you follow it, you do not notice that it is a bad  life, and suffer only in your conscience, if you have one; but if you  leave it, and do not reach the real shore, you will be made miserable  by solitude and by the reproach of having deserted your fellows, and you  will be ashamed. In short, I want to say that it is out of the question  to want to be rather good; it is out of the question to jump into the  water unless you know how to swim. One must be truthful and wish to be  good with all one's might, too. Do you feel this in you? The drift of  what I say is that we all know what PRINCESS MARYA ALEXEVNA [20] verdict  about your marriage would be: that if young people marry without a  sufficient fortune, it means children, poverty, getting tired of each  other in a year or two; in ten years, quarrels, want--hell. And in  all this PRINCESS MARYA ALEXEVNA is perfectly right and plays the true  prophet, unless these young people who are getting married have another  purpose, their one and only one, unknown to PRINCESS MARYA ALEXEVNA, and  that not a brainish purpose, not one recognized by the intellect, but  one that gives life its color and the attainment of which is more moving  than any other. If you have this, good; marry at once, and give the lie  to PRINCESS MARYA ALEXEVNA. If not, it is a hundred to one that your  marriage will lead to nothing but misery. I am speaking to you from the  bottom of my heart. Receive my words into the bottom of yours, and weigh  them well. Besides love for you as a son, I have love for you also as a  man standing at the cross-ways. I kiss you and Lyolya and Noletchka and  Seryozha, if he is back. We are all alive and well.      The following letter belongs to the same period:    Your letter to Tanya has arrived, my dear friend Ilya, and I see  that you are still advancing toward that purpose which you set up for  yourself; and I want to write to you and to her--for no doubt you tell  her everything--what I think about it. Well, I think about it a great  deal, with joy and with fear mixed. This is what I think. If one marries  in order to enjoy oneself more, no good will ever come of it. To set up  as one's main object, ousting everything else, marriage, union with the  being you love, is a great mistake. And an obvious one, if you think  about it. Object, marriage. Well, you marry; and what then? If you had  no other object in life before your marriage, it will be twice as hard  to find one.    As a rule, people who are getting married completely forget this.    So many joyful events await them in the future, in wedlock and the  arrival of children, that those events seem to constitute life itself.  But this is indeed a dangerous illusion.    If parents merely live from day to day, begetting children, and have no  purpose in life, they are only putting off the question of the purpose  of life and that punishment which is allotted to people who live without  knowing why; they are only putting it off and not escaping it, because  they will have to bring up their children and guide their steps, but  they will have nothing to guide them by. And then the parents lose their  human qualities and the happiness which depends on the possession of  them, and turn into mere breeding cattle.    That is why I say that people who are proposing to marry because their  life SEEMS to them to be full must more than ever set themselves to  think and make clear to their own minds for the sake of what each of  them lives.    And in order to make this clear, you must consider the circumstances  in which you live, your past. Reckon up what you consider important and  what unimportant in life. Find out what you believe in; that is, what  you look on as eternal and immutable truth, and what you will take for  your guide in life. And not only find out, but make clear to your own  mind, and try to practise or to learn to practise in your daily life;  because until you practise what you believe you cannot tell whether you  believe it or not.    I know your faith, and that faith, or those sides of it which can be  expressed in deeds, you must now more than ever make clear to your own  mind, by putting them into practice.    Your faith is that your welfare consists in loving people and being  loved by them. For the attainment of this end I know of three lines of  action in which I perpetually exercise myself, in which one can never  exercise oneself enough and which are specially necessary to you now.    First, in order to be able to love people and to be loved by them, one  must accustom oneself to expect as little as possible from them, and  that is very hard work; for if I expect much, and am often disappointed,  I am inclined rather to reproach them than to love them.    Second, in order to love people not in words, but in deed, one must  train oneself to do what benefits them. That needs still harder  work, especially at your age, when it is one's natural business to be  studying.    Third, in order to love people and to b. l. b. t., [21] one must train  oneself to gentleness, humility, the art of bearing with disagreeable  people and things, the art of behaving to them so as not to offend any  one, of being able to choose the least offense. And this is the hardest  work of all--work that never ceases from the time you wake till the time  you go to sleep, and the most joyful work of all, because day after day  you rejoice in your growing success in it, and receive a further reward,  unperceived at first, but very joyful after, in being loved by others.    So I advise you, Friend Ilya, and both of you, to live and to think as  sincerely as you can, because it is the only way you can discover if  you are really going along the same road, and whether it is wise to  join hands or not; and at the same time, if you are sincere, you must be  making your future ready.    Your purpose in life must not be the joy of wedlock, but, by your life  to bring more love and truth into the world. The object of marriage is  to help one another in the attainment of that purpose.    The vilest and most selfish life is the life of the people who have  joined together only in order to enjoy life; and the highest vocation  in the world is that of those who live in order to serve God by bringing  good into the world, and who have joined together for that very purpose.  Don't mistake half-measures for the real thing. Why should a man not  choose the highest? Only when you have chosen the highest, you must set  your whole heart on it, and not just a little. Just a little leads to  nothing. There, I am tired of writing, and still have much left that I  wanted to say. I kiss you.          HELP FOR THE FAMINE-STRICKEN    AFTER my father had come to the conclusion that it was not only useless  to help people with money, but immoral, the part he took in distributing  food among the peasants during the famines of 1890, 1891, and 1898 may  seem to have shown inconsistency and contradiction of thought.    \"If a horseman sees that his horse is tired out, he must not remain  seated on its back and hold up its head, but simply get off,\" he used to  say, condemning all the charities of the well-fed people who sit on the  back of the working classes, continue to enjoy all the benefits of their  privileged position, and merely give from their superfluity.    He did not believe in the good of such charity and considered it a  form of self-hallucination, all the more harmful because people thereby  acquire a sort of moral right to continue that idle, aristocratic life  and get to go on increasing the poverty of the people.    In the autumn of 1890 my father thought of writing an article on the  famine, which had then spread over nearly all Russia.    Although from the newspapers and from the accounts brought by those who  came from the famine-stricken parts he already knew about the extent of  the peasantry's disaster, nevertheless, when his old friend Ivanovitch  Rayovsky called on him at Yasnaya Polyana and proposed that he should  drive through to the Dankovski District with him in order to see the  state of things in the villages for himself, he readily agreed, and went  with him to his property at Begitchovka.    He went "]]]
