APPENDIX II.    BIBLIOGRAPHY.      For a full account of the various systems of Kepler and his predecessors  the reader cannot do better than consult the \"History of the Planetary  Systems, from Thales to Kepler,\" by Dr. J.L.E. Dreyer (Cambridge Univ.  Press, 1906). The same author's \"Tycho Brahe\" gives a wealth of detail  about that \"Phoenix of Astronomers,\" as Kepler styles him. A great  proportion of the literature relating to Kepler is German, but he has  his place in the histories of astronomy, from Delambre and the more  modern R. Wolfs \"Geschichte\" to those of A. Berry, \"History of  Astronomy\" (University Extension Manuals, Murray, 1898), and Professor  G. Forbes, \"History of Astronomy\" (History of Science Series, Watts,  1909).              GLOSSARY.      Apogee: The point in the orbit of a celestial body when it is furthest      from the earth.    Apse: An extremity of the major axis of the orbit of a body; a body is      at its greatest and least distances from the body about which it      revolves, when at one or other apse.    Conjunction: When a plane containing the earth's axis and passing      through the centre of the sun also passes through that of the moon      or a planet, at the same side of the earth, the moon or planet is in      conjunction, or if on opposite sides of the earth, the moon or      planet is in opposition. Mercury and Venus cannot be in opposition,      but are in inferior or superior conjunction according as they are      nearer or further than the sun.    Deferent: In the epicyclic theory, uneven motion is represented by      motion round a circle whose centre travels round another circle, the      latter is called the deferent.    Ecliptic: The plane of the earth's orbital motion about the sun, which      cuts the heavens in a great circle. It is so called because      obviously eclipses can only occur when the moon is also      approximately in this plane, besides being in conjunction or      opposition with the sun.    Epicycle: A point moving on the circumference of a circle whose centre      describes another circle, traces an epicycle with reference to the      centre of the second circle.    Equant: In Ptolemy's excentric theory, when a planet is describing a      circle about a centre which is not the earth, in order to satisfy      the convention that the motion must be uniform, a point was found      about which the motion was apparently uniform,[4] and this point was      called the equant.    [Footnote 4: I.e. the _angular_ motion about the equant was uniform.]    Equinox: When the sun is in the plane of the earth's equator the lengths      of day and night are equal. This happens twice a year, and the times      when the sun passes the equator are called the vernal or spring      equinox and the autumnal equinox respectively.    Evection: The second inequality of the moon, which vanishes at new and      full moon and is a maximum at first and last quarter.    Excentric: As an alternative to epicycles, planets whose motion round      the earth was not uniform could be represented as moving round a      point some distance from the earth called the excentric.    Geocentric: Referred to the centre of the earth; e.g. Ptolemy's theory.    Heliocentric: Referred to the centre of the sun; e.g. the theory      commonly called Copernican.    Inequality: The difference between the actual position of a planet and      its theoretical position on the hypothesis of uniform circular      motion.    Node: The points where the orbit of the moon or a planet intersect the      plane of the ecliptic. The ascending node is the one when the planet      is moving northwards, and the line of intersection of the orbital      plane with the ecliptic is the line of nodes.    Occultation: Usually means when a planet or star is hidden by the moon,      but it also includes \"occultation\" of a star by a planet or of a      satellite by a planet or of one planet by another.    Opposition v. Conjunction.    Parallax: The error introduced by observing from some point other than      that required in theory, e.g. in geocentric places because the      observations are made from the surface of the earth instead of the      centre, or in heliocentric places because observations are made from      the earth and not from the sun.    Perigee: The point in the orbit of a celestial body when it is nearest      to the earth.    Precession: Owing to the slow motion of the earth's pole around the pole      of the ecliptic, the equator cuts the ecliptic a little earlier      every year, so that the equinox each year slightly precedes, with      reference to the stars, that of the previous year."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12422"],[0,"Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation: 1838-1839 (#11)"],[1," or may not be put in the place of _justice_, and  which these slaveholders attempt to persuade others, and perhaps  themselves, effectually supply its want. After church hours the people  came back from Darien. They are only permitted to go to Darien to church  once a month. On the intermediate Sundays they assemble in the house of  London, Mr. ----'s head cooper, an excellent and pious man, who, Heaven  alone knows how, has obtained some little knowledge of reading, and who  reads prayers and the Bible to his fellow slaves, and addresses them with  extemporaneous exhortations. I have the greatest desire to attend one of  these religious meetings, but fear to put the people under any, the  slightest restraint. However, I shall see, by and by, how they feel about  it themselves.    You have heard, of course, many and contradictory statements as to the  degree of religious instruction afforded to the negroes of the South, and  their opportunities of worship, &c. Until the late abolition movement, the  spiritual interests of the slaves were about as little regarded as their  physical necessities. The outcry which has been raised with threefold  force within the last few years against the whole system, has induced its  upholders and defenders to adopt, as measures of personal extenuation,  some appearance of religious instruction (such as it is), and some  pretence at physical indulgences (such as they are), bestowed apparently  voluntarily upon their dependants. At Darien, a church is appropriated to  the especial use of the slaves, who are almost all of them Baptists here;  and a gentleman officiates in it (of course white), who, I understand, is  very zealous in the cause of their spiritual well-being. He, like most  Southern men, clergy or others, jump the present life in their charities  to the slaves, and go on to furnish them with all requisite conveniences  for the next. There were a short time ago two free black preachers in this  neighbourhood, but they have lately been ejected from the place. I could  not clearly learn, but one may possibly imagine, upon what grounds.    I do not think that a residence on a slave plantation is likely to be  peculiarly advantageous to a child like my eldest. I was observing her  to-day among her swarthy worshippers, for they follow her as such, and  saw, with dismay, the universal eagerness with which they sprang to obey  her little gestures of command. She said something about a swing, and in  less than five minutes head-man Frank had erected it for her, and a  dozen young slaves were ready to swing little 'missis.' ----, think of  learning to rule despotically your fellow creatures before the first  lesson of self-government has been well spelt over! It makes me tremble;  but I shall find a remedy, or remove myself and the child from this  misery and ruin.    You cannot conceive anything more grotesque than the Sunday trim of the  poor people; their ideality, as Mr. Combe would say, being, I should  think, twice as big as any rational bump in their head. Their Sabbath  toilet really presents the most ludicrous combination of incongruities  that you can conceive--frills, flounces, ribbands, combs stuck in their  woolly heads, as if they held up any portion of the stiff and ungovernable  hair, filthy finery, every colour in the rainbow, and the deepest possible  shades blended in fierce companionship round one dusky visage, head  handkerchiefs, that put one's very eyes out from a mile off, chintzes with  sprawling patterns, that might be seen if the clouds were printed with  them--beads, bugles, flaring sashes, and above all, little fanciful  aprons, which finish these incongruous toilets with a sort of airy grace,  which I assure you is perfectly indescribable. One young man, the eldest  son and heir of our washerwoman Hannah, came to pay his respects to me in  a magnificent black satin waistcoat, shirt gills which absolutely  engulphed his black visage, and neither shoes nor stockings on his feet.    Among our visitors from St. Simons to-day was Hannah's mother (it seems to  me that there is not a girl of sixteen on the plantations but has  children, nor a woman of thirty but has grandchildren). Old House Molly,  as she is called, from the circumstance of her having been one of the  slaves employed in domestic offices during Major ----'s residence on the  island, is one of the oldest and most respected slaves on the estate, and  was introduced to me by Mr. ---- with especial marks of attention and  regard; she absolutely embraced him, and seemed unable sufficiently to  express her ecstacy at seeing him again. Her dress, like that of her  daughter, and all the servants who have at any time been employed about  the family, bore witness to a far more improved taste than the half savage  adornment of the other poor blacks, and upon my observing to her how  agreeable her neat and cleanly appearance was to me, she replied, that her  old master (Major ----) was extremely particular in this respect, and that  in his time all the house servants were obliged to be very nice and  careful about their persons.    She named to me all her children, an immense tribe; and, by the by, E----,  it has occurred to me that whereas the increase of this ill-fated race is  frequently adduced as a proof of their good treatment and well being, it  really and truly is no such thing, and springs from quite other causes  than the peace and plenty which a rapidly increasing population are  supposed to indicate. If you will reflect for a moment upon the overgrown  families of the half-starved Irish peasantry and English manufacturers,  you will agree with me that these prolific shoots by no means necessarily  spring from a rich or healthy soil. Peace and plenty are certainly causes  of human increase, and so is recklessness; and this, I take it, is the  impulse in the instance of the English manufacturer, the Irish peasant,  and the negro slave. Indeed here it is more than recklessness, for there  are certain indirect premiums held out to obey the early commandment of  replenishing the earth, which do not fail to have their full effect. In  the first place, none of the cares, those noble cares, that holy  thoughtfulness which lifts the human above the brute parent, are ever  incurred here by either father or mother. The relation indeed resembles,  as far as circumstances can possibly make it do so, the short-lived  connection between the animal and its young. The father, having neither  authority, power, responsibility, or charge in his children, is of course,  as among brutes, the least attached to his offspring; the mother, by the  natural law which renders the infant dependent on her for its first year's  nourishment, is more so; but as neither of them is bound to educate or to  support their children, all the unspeakable tenderness and solemnity, all  the rational, and all the spiritual grace and glory of the connection is  lost, and it becomes mere breeding, bearing, suckling, and there an end.  But it is not only the absence of the conditions which God has affixed to  the relation, which tends to encourage the reckless increase of the race;  they enjoy, by means of numerous children, certain positive advantages. In  the first place, every woman who is pregnant, as soon as she chooses to  make the fact known to the overseer, is relieved of a certain portion of  her work in the field, which lightening of labour continues, of course, as  long as she is so burthened. On the birth of a child certain additions of  clothing and an additional weekly ration are bestowed on the family; and  these matters, small as they may seem, act as powerful inducements to  creatures who have none of the restraining influences actuating them  which belong to the parental relation among all other people, whether  civilised or savage. Moreover, they have all of them a most distinct and  perfect knowledge of their value to their owners as property; and a woman  thinks, and not much amiss, that the more frequently she adds to the  number of her master's live stock by bringing new slaves into the world,  the more claims she will have upon his consideration and goodwill. This  was perfectly evident to me from the meritorious air with which the women  always made haste to inform me of the number of children they had borne,  and the frequent occasions on which the older slaves would direct my  attention to their children, exclaiming, 'Look, missis! little niggers for  you and massa, plenty little niggers for you and little missis!' A very  agreeable apostrophe to me indeed, as you will believe.    I have let this letter lie for a day or two, dear, E---- from press of  more immediate avocations. I have nothing very particular to add to it. On  Monday evening I rowed over to Darien with Mr. ---- to fetch over the  doctor, who was coming to visit some of our people. As I sat waiting in  the boat for the return of the gentlemen, the sun went down, or rather  seemed to dissolve bodily into the glowing clouds, which appeared but a  fusion of the great orb of light; the stars twinkled out in the  rose-coloured sky, and the evening air, as it fanned the earth to sleep,  was as soft as a summer's evening breeze in the north. A sort of dreamy  stillness seemed creeping over the world and into my spirit, as the canoe  just tilted against the steps that led to the wharf, raised by the scarce  perceptible heaving of the water. A melancholy, monotonous boat-horn  sounded from a distance up the stream, and presently, floating slowly down  with the current, huge, shapeless, black relieved against the sky, came  one of those rough barges piled with cotton, called, hereabouts, Ocone  boxes. The vessel itself is really nothing but a monstrous square box,  made of rough planks, put together in the roughest manner possible to  attain the necessary object of keeping the cotton dry. Upon this great  tray are piled the swollen apoplectic looking"]]]
