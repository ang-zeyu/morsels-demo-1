UN BEAU TRIOMPHE    La celebre cantatrice australienne, Madame Melba, raconte l'anecdote  suivante:    Lors de mon dernier sejour a New-York, j'etais descendue au Savoy  Hotel. Un jour, en repassant mon role de la reine dans \"Les  Huguenots\" je travaillais mes vocalises et mes trilles, quand  tout a coup je fus interrompue. J'ouvris vivement ma porte et  j'apercus un tout petit bebe de trois ans a peine, courant dans  le corridor en criant tout excite: \"Maman, maman! petit oiseau,  petit oiseau!\" C'est le plus beau de tous mes triomphes, ajoute  la charmante femme.

Pour le coup, c'etait trop fort. \"Qu'y a-t-il? s'ecria-t-il  avec colere.--Docteur... vite!...

QUI VEUT LA FIN VEUT LES MOYENS    La femme d'un habitant de Nantes, _morte_ il y a quelques annees,  lui laissa par _testament_ une rente viagere de vingt mille francs  pour tout le temps qu'il resterait _veuf,_ ajoutant qu'au cas  ou il se remarierait cette somme reviendrait aux enfants de la  premiere femme.

Adosse a la cheminee, un danseur  etouffe un baillement.    \"Vous vous ennuyez, monsieur? demande un voisin.--Oui, monsieur,  et vous?--Moi de meme.--Alors si nous nous en allions?--Je ne  peux pas, moi, je"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11758"],[0,"Baldy of Nome (#11)"],[1,"time  he took Baldy out for exercise. One was as eager for improvement as the  other, and \"Scotty\" and the Woman often remarked the unflagging energy  both displayed toward that end.    \"Too bad that Ben's efforts are wasted on a dog that will never be much  to boast of, at best. He has strength and patience, but that is about  all. I believe, like George, that he lacks spirit.\"    Of course there had been no dramatic incidents in his life like those  of Jack McMillan's; he was no paragon like Kid; nor had he manifested  the marvelous intelligence of old Dubby. But on the other hand, there  was really nothing tangible so far in his career to make her feel that  he was incapable of development.    \"You're wrong about Baldy,\" said \"Scotty\" thoughtfully. \"I have been  watching him ever since the Juvenile Race; and he has certain latent  qualities that will make a good general utility dog of him for even a  racing team. He may not prove a leader, but he's dependable, not apt to  lose his head and stampede, as do some of the more spirited ones. He'll  do his modest part yet, in a big event.\"    \"Well, you'll have to show me,\" exclaimed the Woman, whose speech was  now and then tinged unconsciously by her close fellowship with the  Wonder Workers.    Even Dubby's favorable notice was now frequently attracted toward Baldy;  and the fact that he was aspiring to belong to the Racing Team was  mitigated to a certain extent in the venerable huskie's sight by a  puppy-hood spent amongst the working classes. He was not born to an  exalted position, a natural aristocrat, like Tom, Dick or Harry; and  would not, as did they, glory in it ostentatiously. But if it came, he  would accept it with a solemn sense of obligation to do his best  anywhere it pleased his master to place him.    Unlike the Tolman brothers, McMillan, Irish and Rover, he did not curry  favor by the happy accident of birth, beauty, or personal magnetism; and  so Dubby began to bestow upon Baldy, for his modesty and industry, an  approbation not accorded by him to many of the others in the Kennel. And  Dubby's opinion of a new dog was worth much, for \"Scotty\" Allan himself  respected the experience and sagacity that governed it.    Possessed of the colorings and markings of his wolf forbears, as well as  their keen instinct in trail emergencies, Dubby combined with this the  faithful, loving nature of the dog branch of the family.    In his merest infancy he had given promise of unusual ability--a promise  more than fulfilled.    When hardly more than three months old he had learned the orders \"Gee,\"  \"Haw,\" \"Mush\" and \"Whoa\" perfectly. And he was beginning to think a  little for himself when the rest of the litter were still undecided  whether \"Gee\" meant to turn to the right paw side, or the left paw side;  and were hardly convinced that \"Mush\" was \"Go on\" and not a terse  invitation to breakfast.    His later accomplishments were many. He could pick up an uncertain trail  when concealed by three feet of soft, freshly fallen snow; he could tell  if ice was thick enough to carry the weight of a loaded sled, when the  most seasoned trailsman was deceived, and he could scent a camp for four  or five miles with the wind in the right direction. Never but once in  his life had he been known to take the wrong route to a given point.  Then he mistook the faint glimmer of Venus, as she dimly showed above  the dark horizon, for the lantern on the ridge-pole of a road house;  which was poetic, but misleading, and proves that even dogs can come to  grief through too much star gazing.    He was always driven \"loose\" on the rare and gala occasions when, at his  own plainly expressed desire, he was placed again in temporary service.  With that liberty he made it his business to see that no dog was  shirking. A glance at a slack strap was enough to betray the idler; and  an admonishing nip on the culprit's ear or flank was the cause of a  reformation that was sudden and abject for a while at least.    The only punishment that had ever been meted out to Dubby for some  indiscretion, or an act of insubordination, was to hitch him up with the  rest of the team. There were no depths of humiliation greater, no shame  more poignant, and for days after such an ordeal he would show a  brooding melancholy that almost made the Woman weep in sympathy.    Now, pensioned and retired, with a record of over thirty thousand miles  in harness to his credit, he lived a delightful and exclusive existence  in his own apartments over the barn.    As he had taken Baldy into his favor, so too he included Ben in his  rather limited list of favorites; and the boy never wearied of hearing  from \"Scotty\" and the Woman their many tales of the huskie's remarkable  achievements.    \"Even if he ain't a Racer,\" was the child's admiring assertion,  \"everybody in the whole North knows Dub, and what he's done. I hope,\"  wistfully, \"that some day people'll speak o' Baldy jest like that.\"    \"You can hardly expect that, Ben! Think of the hundreds and hundreds of  good dogs that are never known outside of their own kennels. Baldy is  obedient and willing, but it takes something extraordinary, really  brilliant, or dramatic, to give a dog more than a local reputation. Of  course there are a few, but very few, who have won such distinction.  John Johnson's Blue Eyed Kolma was a wonder for his docile disposition  and staying qualities. You can't match our Kid for all round good work,  nor Irish for speed. And Jack McMillan--\"    \"I don't believe I'd specify McMillan's claims to fame, or shall we say  notoriety,\" observed \"Scotty,\" with a twinkle in his eye. \"Then,\" he  resumed, \"there were Morte Atkinson's Blue Leaders, that Percy  Blatchford drove in the second big race. When we met at Last Chance on  the way back, Blatchford nearly cried when he told me how those setters  had saved his hands from freezing. He had turned them loose to rest and  run behind at will, knowing they would catch up at the next stop. In  some way he had dropped the fur gloves he wore over his mittens, when he  took them off to adjust a sled pack, and did not miss them for some  time, until he ran into a fierce blizzard. Of course he could not go  back for them, and he feared his hands would become useless from the  cold. He was in a pretty bad fix, when up came the Blue Leaders, almost  exhausted, but each with a glove in his mouth.\"    \"Oh, that was fine,\" murmured Ben.    \"Give me bird-dog stock every time,\" continued Allan, \"with a native  strain for strength and trail instincts. It's a combination that makes  our Alaskans just about right, to my idea.\"    \"Naturally I feel that our half-breeds are best, too. But I do wish,\"  regretfully, \"that they could all be the same sort of half-breeds--to  make them more uniform as to size and style. With Kid and Spot part  pointer, Irish and Rover part setter, Jack McMillan verging on the  mastiff, and all the rest of them part something else, don't you think  it looks the least little bit as if we had picked them up at a remnant  sale?\"    She caught sight of \"Scotty's\" face, full of shocked surprise.    \"Don't say it,\" she exclaimed quickly; \"both Ben and I know perfectly  well that 'handsome is as handsome does.' I learned it in my copy-book,  ages and ages ago. And it's true that they are the greatest dogs in all  the world, but they don't quite look it. Of course the year you won with  Berger's 'Brutes,' with that awkward, high-shouldered native, Mukluk, in  the lead, I learned that looks do not go very far in Arctic racing. But  certainly Fink's 'Prides' in their gay trappings of scarlet and gold did  seem more to suit the role of Winners when Hegness came in victorious  with them in the first race.\"    \"At that, the 'Brutes' were the best dogs, and if it had not been for  our delay of eighteen hours at Brown's Road House, where all of the  teams had to lay up because of a howling gale, I am not at all sure that  the 'Prides' would not have lost out to the 'Brutes' in that race too.\"    \"That must have been a strange night. I know after that every one called  Brown's 'The House of a Thousand Bow Wows.' How many were there?\"    \"Let me see; there were fifty-four racing dogs, thirty-five freighters,  twenty-six belonging to the mail carriers, ten or twelve to casual  mushers, and I think about the same number to Eskimo trappers. And  all--men and dogs--in the one room, which, fortunately, was of pretty  good size.\"    \"Scotty\" laughed heartily at the remembrance. \"We, who were driving the  Racing Teams, had put our leaders to bed in the few bunks there were;  for we could not afford to take any chances of our leaders scrapping in  such close quarters, and possibly being put out of commission. But an  Outsider, a government official, I think, who was on his way to Nome as  a passenger with the Mail Team, was pretty sore about it. Said 'it was a  deuce of a country where the dogs slept in beds and the men on the  floor.'\"    \"How perfectly ridiculous,\" said the Woman indignantly. \"You might know  he was not an Alaskan. He was as bad as that squaw who wouldn't give you  her mukluks.\"    \"What was that, Mr. Allan?\" questioned the boy, eagerly.    \"I'm afraid, Ben, that some of these incidents look a little  high-handed, as though everything was allowable in a race, regardless of  other people's rights; but they really don't happen often. This time I  tore one of my water boots on a stump going through the trees by  Council. At a near-by cabin I tried to buy a pair of mukluks a native  woman had on, as I saw they were about the size I needed. She refused to  sell, though I offered her three times their value. There was no time to  argue, nor persuade, so finally in desperation her Eskimo husband and I  took them off her feet, though she kicked vigorously. It saved the day  for me, but it seemed a bit ungallant.\"    \"It served her right for not being as good a sport as most of the"]]]
