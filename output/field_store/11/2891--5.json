We shall soon be with them.\"    Marius, too, struck his camp, and followed them.  They halted, both of  them, near Aix, on the borders of the Coenus, the barbarians in the  valley, Marius on a hill which commanded it.  The ardor of the Romans was  at its height; it was warm weather; there was a want of water on the  hill, and the soldiers murmured.  \"You are men,\" said Marius, pointing to  the river below, \"and there is water to be bought with blood.\"  \"Why  don't you lead us against them at once, then,\" said a soldier, \"whilst we  still have blood in our veins?\"  \"We must first fortify our camp,\"  answered Marius quietly.    The soldiers obeyed: but the hour of battle had come, and well did Marius  know it.  It commenced on the brink of the Coenus, between some Ambrons  who were bathing and some Roman slaves gone down to draw water.  When the  whole horde of the Ambrons advanced to the battle, shouting their war-cry  of Ambra! Ambra! a body of Gallic auxiliaries in the Roman army, and in  the first rank, heard them with great amazement; for it was their own  name and their own cry; there were tribes of Ambrons in the Alps  subjected to Rome as well as in the Helvetic Alps; and Ambra! Ambra!  resounded on both sides.    The battle lasted two days, the first against the Ambrons, the second  against the Teutons.  Both were beaten, in spite of their savage bravery,  and the equal bravery of their women, who defended, with indomitable  obstinacy, the cars with which they had remained almost alone, in charge  of the children and the booty.  After the women, it was necessary to  exterminate the hounds who defended their masters' bodies.  Here again  the figures of the historians are absurd, although they differ; the most  extravagant raise the number of barbarians slain to two hundred thousand,  and that of the prisoners to eighty thousand; the most moderate stop at  one hundred thousand.  In any case, the carnage was great, for the  battle-field, where all these corpses rested without burial, rotting in  the sun and rain, got the name of Campi Putridi, or Fields of  Putrefaction, a name traceable even nowadays in that of Pourrires, a  neighboring village.    [Illustration: The Women defending the Cars----58]    As to the booty, the Roman army with one voice made a free gift of it to  Marius; but he, remembering, perhaps, what had been lately done by the  barbarians after the defeat of the consuls Manlius and Czepio, determined  to have it all burned in honor of the gods.  He had a great sacrifice  prepared.  The soldiers, crowned with laurel, were ranged about the pyre;  their general, holding on high a blazing torch, was about to apply the  light with his own hand, when suddenly, on the very spot, whether by  design or accident, came from Rome the news that Marius had just been for  the fifth time elected consul.  In the midst of acclamations from his  army, and with a fresh chaplet bound upon his brow, he applied the torch  in person, and completed the sacrifice.    Were we travelling in Provence, in the neighborhood of Aix, we should  encounter, peradventure, some peasant who, whilst pointing out to us the  summit of a lull whereon, in all probability, Marius offered, nineteen  hundred and forty years ago, that glorious sacrifice, would say to us in  his native dialect, \"Aqui es lou deloubre do la Vittoria:\"  \"There is the  temple of victory.\"  There, indeed, was built, not far from a pyramid  erected in honor of Marius, a little temple dedicated to Victory.  Thither, every year, in the month of May, the population used to come and  celebrate a festival and light a bonfire, answered by other bonfires on  the neighboring heights.  When Gaul became Christian, neither monument  nor festival perished; a saint took the place of the goddess, and the  temple of Victory became the church of St. Victoire.  There are still  ruins of it to this day; the religious procession which succeeded the  pagan festival ceased only at the first outburst of the Revolution; and  the vague memory of a great national event still mingles in popular  tradition with the legends of the saint.    The Ambrons and Teutons beaten, there remained the Kymrians, who,  according to agreement, had repassed the Helvetic Alps and entered Italy  on the north-east, by way of the Adige.  Marius marched against them in  July of the following year, 101 B.C.  Ignorant of what had occurred in  Gaul, and possessed, as ever, with the desire of a settlement, they again  sent to him a deputation, saying, \"Give us lands and towns for us and our  brethren.\"  \"What brethren?\" asked Marius.  \"The Teutons.\"  The Romans  who were about Marius began to laugh.  \"Let your brethren be,\" said  Marius; \"they have land, and will always have it; they received it from  us.\"  The Kymrians, perceiving the irony of his tone, burst out into  threats, telling Marius that he should suffer for it at their hands  first, and afterwards at those of the Teutons when they arrived.  \"They  are here,\" rejoined Marius; \"you must not depart without saluting your  brethren;\" and he had Teutobod, King of the Teutons, brought out with  other captive chieftains.  The envoys reported the sad news in their own  camp, and three days afterwards, July 30, a great battle took place  between the Kymrians and the Romans in the Raudine Plains, a large tract  near Verceil.    It were unnecessary to dwell on the details of the battle, which  resembled that of Aix; besides, fought as it was in Italy and by none but  Romans, it has but little to do with a history of Gaul.  It has been  mentioned only to make known the issue of that famous invasion, of which  Gaul was the principal theatre.  For a moment it threatened the very  existence of the Roman Republic.  The victories of Marius arrested the  torrent, but did not dry up its source.  The great movement which drove  from Asia to Europe, and from eastern to western Europe, masses of roving  populations, followed its course, bringing incessantly upon the Roman  frontiers new comers and new perils.  A greater man than Marius, Julius  Caesar in fact, saw that to effectually resist these clouds of barbaric  assailants, the country into which they poured must be conquered and made  Roman.  The conquest of Gaul was the accomplishment of that idea, and the  decisive step towards the transformation of the Roman republic into a  Roman empire.          CHAPTER IV.----GAUL CONQUERED BY JULIUS CAESAR.    Historians, ancient and modern, have attributed to the Roman Senate,  from the time of the establishment of the Roman province in Gaul, a  long-premeditated design of conquering Gaul altogether.  Others have said  that when Julius Caesar, in the year of Rome 696, (58 B C.) got himself  appointed proconsul in Gaul, his single aim was to form for himself there  an army devoted to his person, of which he might avail himself to satisfy  his ambition and make himself master of Rome.  We should not be too ready  to believe in these far-reaching and precise plans, conceived and settled  so long beforehand, whether by a senate or a single man.  Prevision and  exact calculation do not count for so much in the lives of governments  and of peoples.  It is unexpected events, inevitable situations, the  imperious necessities of successive epochs, which most often decide the  conduct of the greatest powers and the most able politicians.  It is  after the fair, when the course of facts and their consequences has  received full development, that, amidst their tranquil meditations,  annalists and historians, in their learned way, attribute everything to  systematic plans and personal calculations on the part of the chief  actors.  There is much less of combination than of momentary inspiration,  derived from circumstances, in the resolutions and conduct of political  chiefs, kings, senators, or great men.  From the time that discord and  corruption had turned the Roman Republic into a bloody and tyrannical  anarchy, the Roman Senate no longer meditated grand designs, and its  members were preoccupied only with the question of escaping or avenging  proscriptions.  When Caesar procured for himself the government for five  years of the Gauls, the fact was, that, not desiring to be a sanguinary  dictator like Scylla, or a gala chieftain like Pompey, he went and sought  abroad, for his own glory and fortune's sake, in a war of general Roman  interest, the means and chances of success which were not furnished to  him in Rome itself by the dogged and monotonous struggle of the factions.    [Illustration: The Roman Army invading Gaul----61]    In spite of the victories of Marius, and the destruction or dispersion of  the Teutons and Cimbrians, the whole of Gaul remained seriously disturbed  and threatened.  At the north-east, in Belgica, some bands of other  Teutons, who had begun to be called Germans (men of war), had passed over  the left bank of the Rhine, and were settling or wandering there without  definite purpose.  In eastern and central Gaul, in the valleys of the  Jura and Auvergne, on the banks of the Saone, the Allier, and the Doubs,  the two great Gallic confederations, that of the AEduans and that of the  Arvernians, were disputing the preponderance, and making war one upon  another, seeking the aid, respectively, of the Romans and of the Germans.  At the foot of the Alps, the little nation of Allobrogians, having fallen  a prey to civil dissension, had given up its independence to Rome.  Even  in southern and western Gaul the populations of Agnitania were rising,  vexing the Roman province, and rendering necessary, on both sides of the  Pyrenees, the intervention of Roman legions.  Everywhere floods of  barbaric populations were pressing upon Gaul, were carrying disgnietude  even where they had not themselves yet penetrated, and causing  presentiments of a general commotion.

I pray you, therefore, to give it thought, for it is a  grave matter, and I grant you nine days for to answer me whatever shall  seem to you good.\"  Eight days after, they returned; and Guy de  Mauvoisin, speaking in their name, said to the king, \"Sir, your brothers  and the rich men who be here have had regard unto your condition, and  they see that you cannot remain in this country to your own and your  kingdom's honor, for of all the knights who came in your train, and of  whom you led into Cyprus twenty-eight hundred, there remain not one  hundred in this city.  Wherefore they do counsel you, sir, to get you  hence to France, and to provide troops and money wherewith you may return  speedily to this country, to take vengeance on these enemies of God who  have kept you in prison.\"  Louis, without any discussion, interrogated  all present, one after another, and all, even the pope's legate, agreed  with Guy de Mauvoisin.  \"I was seated just fourteenth, facing the  legate,\" says Joinville, \"and when he asked me how it seemed to me, I  answered him that if the king could hold out so far as to keep the field  for a year, he would do himself great honor if he remained.\"    [Illustration: Sire de Joinville----55]    Only two knights, William de Beaumont and Sire de Chatenay, had the  courage to support the opinion of Joinville, which was bolder for the  time being, but not less indecisive in respect of the immediate future  than the contrary opinion.  \"I have heard you out, sirs,\" said the king:  \"and I will answer you, within eight clays from this time, touching that  which it shall please me to do.\"  \"Next Sunday,\" says Joinville, \"we came  again, all of us, before the king.  'Sirs,' said he, 'I thank very much  all those who have counselled me to get me gone to France, and likewise  those who have counselled me to bide.  But I have bethought me that, if I  bide, I see no danger lest my kingdom of France be lost, for the queen,  my mother, hath a many folk to defend it.  I have noted likewise that the  barons of this land do say that, if I go hence, the kingdom of Jerusalem  is lost.  At no price will I suffer to be lost the kingdom of Jerusalem,  which I came to guard and conquer.  My resolve, then, is, that I bide for  the present.  So I say unto you, ye rich men who are here, and to all  other knights who shall have a mind to bide with me, come and speak  boldly unto me, and I will give ye so much that it shall not be my fault  if ye have no mind to bide.'\"    Thus none, save Louis himself, dared go to the root of the question.  The  most discreet advised him to depart, only for the purpose of coming back,  and recommencing what had been so unsuccessful; and the boldest only  urged him to remain a year longer.  None took the risk of saying, even  after so many mighty but vain experiments, that the enterprise was  chimerical, and must be given up.  Louis alone was, in word and deed,  perfectly true to his own absorbing idea of recovering the Holy Sepulchre  from the Mussulmans and re-establishing the kingdom of Jerusalem.  His  was one of those pure and majestic souls, which are almost alien to the  world in which they live, and in which disinterested passion is so strong  that it puts judgment to silence, extinguishes all fear, and keeps up  hope to infinity.  The king's two brothers embarked with a numerous  retinue.  How many crusaders, knights, or men-at-arms, remained with  Louis, there is nothing to show; but they were, assuredly, far from  sufficient for the attainment of the twofold end he had in view, and even  for insuring less grand results, such as the deliverance of the crusaders  still remaining prisoners in the hands of the Mussulmans, and anything  like an effectual protection for the Christians settled in Palestine and  Syria.    Twice Louis believed he was on the point of accomplishing his desire.  Towards the end of 1250, and again in 1252, the Sultan of Aleppo and  Damascus, and the Emirs of Egypt, being engaged in a violent struggle,  made offers to him, by turns, of restoring the kingdom of Jerusalem if he  would form an active alliance with one or the other party against its  enemies.  Louis sought means of accepting either of these offers without  neglecting his previous engagements, and without compromising the fate of  the Christians still prisoners in Egypt, or living in the territories of  Aleppo and Damascus; but, during the negotiations entered upon with a  view to this end, the Mussulmans of Syria and Egypt suspended their  differences, and made common cause against the remnants of the Christian  crusaders; and all hope of re-entering Jerusalem by these means vanished  away.  Another time, the Sultan of Damascus, touched by Louis's pious  perseverance, had word sent to him that he, if he wished, could go on a  pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and should find himself in perfect safety.  \"The  king,\" says Joinville, \"held a great council; and none urged him to go.  It was shown unto him that if he, who was the greatest king in  Christendom, performed his pilgrimage without delivering the Holy City  from the enemies of God, all the other kings and other pilgrims who came  after him would hold themselves content with doing just as much, and  would trouble themselves no more about the deliverance of Jerusalem.\"  He  was reminded of the example set by Richard Coeur de Lion, who, sixty  years before, had refused to cast even a look upon Jerusalem, when he was  unable to deliver her from her enemies.  Louis, just as Richard had,  refused the incomplete satisfaction which had been offered him, and for  nearly four years, spent by him on the coasts of Palestine and Syria  since his departure from Damietta, from 1250 to 1254, he expended, in  small works of piety, sympathy, protection, and care for the future of  the Christian populations in Asia, his time, his strength, his pecuniary  resources, and the ardor of a soul which could not remain icily abandoned  to sorrowing over great desires unsatisfied.    An unexpected event occurred and brought about all at once a change in  his position and his plans.  At the commencement of the year 1253, at  Sidon, the ramparts of which he was engaged in repairing, he heard that  his mother, Queen Blanche, had died at Paris on the 27th of November,  1252.  \"He made so great mourning thereat,\" says Joinville, \"that for two  days no speech could be gotten of him.  After that he sent a chamber-man  for to fetch me.  When I carne before him, in his chamber where he was  alone, so soon as he got sight of me, he stretched forth his arms, and  said to me, 'O, seneschal, I have lost my mother!'\"  It was a great loss  both for the son and for the king.  Imperious, exacting, jealous, and  often disagreeable in private life and in the bosom of her family,  Blanche was, nevertheless, according to all contemporary authority, even  the least favorable to her, \"the most discreet woman of her time, with a  mind singularly quick and penetrating, and with a man's heart to leaven  her Woman's sex and ideas; personally magnanimous, of indomitable energy,  sovereign mistress in all the affairs of her age, guardian and  protectress of France, worthy of comparison with Semiramis, the most  eminent of her sex.\"  From the time of Louis's departure on the crusade  as well as during his minority she had given him constant proofs of a  devotion as intelligent as it was impassioned, as useful as it was  masterful.  All letters from France demanded the speedy return of the  king.  The Christians of Syria were themselves of the same opinion; the  king, they said, has done for us, here, all he could do; he will serve us  far better by sending us strong re-enforcements from France.  Louis  embarked at  St. Jean d'Acre, on the 24th of April, 1254, carrying away  with him, on thirteen vessels, large and small, Queen Marguerite, his  children, his personal retinue, and his own more immediate men-at-arms,  and leaving the Christians of Syria, for their protection in his name,  a hundred knights under the orders of Geoffrey de Sargines, that comrade  of his in whose bravery and pious fealty he had the most entire  confidence.  After two months and a half at sea, the king and his fleet  arrived, on the 8th of July, 1254, off the port of Hyeres, which at that  time belonged to the Empire, and not to France.  For two days Louis  refused to land at this point; for his heart was set upon not putting his  foot upon land again save on the soil of his own kingdom, at Aigues-  Mortes, whence he had, six years before, set out.  At last he yielded to  the entreaties of the queen and those who were about him, landed at  Hyeres, passed slowly through France, and made his solemn entry into  Paris on the 7th of September, 1254.  \"The burgesses and all those who  were in the city were there to meet him, clad and bedecked in all their  best according to their condition.  If the other towns had received him  with great joy, Paris evinced even more than any other. For several days  there were bonfires, dances, and other public rejoicings, which ended  sooner than the people wished; for the king, who was pained to see the  expense, the dances, and the vanities indulged in, went off to the wood  of Vincennes to put a stop to them.    So soon as he had resumed the government of his kingdom, after six years'  absence and adventures, heroic, indeed, but all in vain for the cause of  Christendom, those of his counsellors and servants who lived most closely  with him and knew him best were struck at the same time with what he had  remained and what he had become during this long and cruel trial.  \"When  the king had happily returned to France, how piously he bare himself  towards God, how justly towards his subjects, how compassionately towards  the afflicted, and how humbly in his own respect, and with what zeal he  labored to make progress, according to his power, in every virtue, all  this can be attested by"]]]
