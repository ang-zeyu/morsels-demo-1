The slavery of the Israelites in  Egypt may have been a blessing in disguise, from which they emerged when  they were able to take care of themselves. Moses led them out of  bondage; but Moses also incorporated in his institutions the \"wisdom of  the Egyptians.\" He was indeed inspired to declare certain fundamental  truths, but he also taught the lessons of experience which a great  nation had acquired by two thousand years of prosperity. Who can tell,  who can measure, the civilization which the Israelites must have carried  out of Egypt, with the wealth of which they despoiled their masters?  Where else at that period could they have found such teachers? The  Persians at that time were shepherds like themselves in Canaan, the  Assyrians were hunters, and the Greeks had no historical existence. Only  the discipline of forty years in the wilderness, under Moses, was  necessary to make them a nation of conquerors, for they had already  learned the arts of agriculture, and knew how to protect themselves in  walled cities. A nomadic people were they no longer, as in the time of  Jacob, but small farmers, who had learned to irrigate their barren hills  and till their fertile valleys; and they became a powerful though  peaceful nation, unconquered by invaders for a thousand years, and  unconquerable for all time in their traditions, habits, and mental  characteristics. From one man--the patriarch Jacob--did this great  nation rise, and did not lose its national unity and independence until  from the tribe of Judah a deliverer arose who redeemed the human race.  Surely, how favored was Joseph, in being the instrument under Providence  of preserving this nation in its infancy, and placing its people in a  rich and fertile country where they could grow and multiply, and learn  principles of civilization which would make them a permanent power in  the progress of humanity!          MOSES.      1571-1451 B.C. [USHER].    HEBREW JURISPRUDENCE.      Among the great actors in the world's history must surely be presented  the man who gave the first recorded impulse to civilization, and who is  the most august character of antiquity. I think Moses and his  legislation should be considered from the standpoint of the Scriptures  rather than from that of science and criticism. It is very true that the  legislation and ritualism we have been accustomed to ascribe to Moses  are thought by many great modern critics, including Ewald, to be the  work of writers whose names are unknown, in the time of Hezekiah and  even later, as Jewish literature was developed. But I remain unconvinced  by the modern theories, plausible as they are, and weighty as is their  authority; and hence I have presented the greatest man in the history of  the Jews as our fathers regarded him, and as the Bible represents him.  Nor is there any subject which bears more directly on the elemental  principles of theological belief and practical morality, or is more  closely connected with the progress of modern religious and social  thought, than a consideration of the Mosaic writings. Whether as a \"man  of God,\" or as a meditative sage, or as a sacred historian, or as an  inspired prophet, or as an heroic liberator and leader of a favored  nation, or as a profound and original legislator, Moses alike stands out  as a wonderful man, not to the eyes of Jews merely, but to all  enlightened nations and ages. He was evidently raised up for a  remarkable and exalted mission,--not only to deliver a debased and  superstitious people from bondage, but to impress his mind and character  upon them and upon all other nations, and to link his name with the  progress of the human race.    He arose at a great crisis, when a new dynasty reigned in Egypt,--not  friendly, as the preceding one had been, to the children of Israel; but  a dynasty which had expelled the Shepherd Kings, and looked with fear  and jealousy upon this alien race, already powerful, in sympathy with  the old regime, located in the most fertile sections of the land, and  acquainted not merely with agriculture, but with the arts of the  Egyptians,--a population of over two millions of souls; so that the  reigning monarch, probably a son of the Sesostris of the Greeks,  bitterly exclaimed to his courtiers, \"The children of Israel are more  and mightier than we!\" And the consequence of this jealousy was a  persecution based on the elemental principle of all persecution,--that  of fear blended with envy, carried out with remorseless severity; for in  case of war (and the new dynasty scarcely felt secure on the throne) it  was feared the Hebrews might side with enemies. So the new Pharaoh  (Rameses II., as is thought by Rawlinson) attempted to crush their  spirit by hard toils and unjust exactions. And as they still continued  to multiply, there came forth the dreadful edict that every male child  of the Hebrews should be destroyed as soon as born.    It was then that Moses, descended from a family of the tribe of Levi,  was born,--1571 B.C., according to Usher. I need not relate in detail  the beautiful story of his concealment for three months by his mother  Jochebed, his exposure in a basket of papyrus on the banks of the Nile,  his rescue by the daughter of Pharaoh, at that time regent of the  kingdom in the absence of her father,--or, as Wilberforce thinks, the  wife of the king of Lower Egypt,--his adoption by this powerful  princess, his education in the royal household among those learned  priests to whose caste even the King belonged. Moses himself, a great  master of historical composition, has in six verses told that story,  with singular pathos and beauty; yet he directly relates nothing further  of his life until, at the age of forty, he killed an Egyptian overseer  who was smiting one of his oppressed brethren, and buried him in the  sands,--thereby showing that he was indignant at injustice, or clung in  his heart to his race of slaves. But what a history might have been  written of those forty years of luxury, study, power, and honor!--since  Josephus speaks of his successful and brilliant exploits as a conqueror  of the Ethiopians. What a career did the son of the Hebrew bondwoman  probably lead in the palaces of Memphis, sitting at the monarch's table,  feted as a conqueror, adopted as grandson and perhaps as heir, a  proficient in all the learning and arts of the most civilized nation of  the earth, enrolled in the college of priests, discoursing with the most  accomplished of his peers on the wonders of magical enchantment, the  hidden meaning of religious rites, and even the being and attributes of  a Supreme God,--the esoteric wisdom from which even a Pythagoras drew  his inspiration; possibly tasting, with generals and nobles, all the  pleasures of sin. But whether in pleasure or honor, the soul of Moses,  fortified by the maternal instructions of his early days,--for his  mother was doubtless a good as well as a brave woman,--soars beyond his  circumstances, and he seeks to avenge the wrongs of his brethren. Not  wisely, however, for he slays a government official, and is forced to  flee,--a necessity which we can hardly comprehend in view of his rank  and power, unless it revealed all at once to the astonished king his  Hebrew birth, and his dangerous sympathies with an oppressed people, the  act showing that he may have sought, in his earnest soul, to break their  intolerable bonds.    Certainly Moses aspires prematurely to be a deliverer. He is not yet  prepared for such a mighty task. He is too impulsive and inexperienced.  It must need be that he pass through a period of preparation, learn  patience, mature his knowledge, and gain moral force, which preparation  could be best made in severe contemplation; for it is in retirement and  study that great men forge the weapons which demolish principalities and  powers, and master those _principia_ which are the foundation of thrones  and empires. So he retires to the deserts of Midian, among a scattered  pastoral people, on the eastern shore of the Red Sea, and is received by  Jethro, a priest of Midian, whose flocks he tends, and whose daughter  he marries.    The land of Midian, to which he fled, is not fertile like Egypt, nor  rich in unnumbered monuments of pride and splendor, with pyramids for  mausoleums, and colossal statues to perpetuate kingly memories. It is  not scented with flowers and variegated with landscapes of beauty and  fertility, but is for the most part, with here and there a patch of  verdure, a land of utter barrenness and dreariness, and, as Hamilton  paints it, \"a great and terrible wilderness, where no soft features  mitigated the unbroken horror, but dark and brown ridges, red peaks like  pyramids of fire; no rounded hillocks or soft mountain curves, but  monstrous and misshapen cliffs, rising tier above tier, and serrated for  miles into rugged grandeur, and grooved by the winter torrents cutting  into the veins of the fiery rock: a land dreary and desolate, yet  sublime in its boldness and ruggedness,--a labyrinth of wild and blasted  mountains, a terrific and howling desolation.\"    It is here that Moses seeks safety, and finds it in the home of a  priest, where his affections may be cultivated, and where he may indulge  in lofty speculations and commune with the Elohim whom he adores;  isolated yet social, active in body but more active in mind, still fresh  in all the learning of the schools of Egypt, and wise in all the  experiences of forty years. And the result of his studies and  inspirations was, it is supposed, the book of Genesis, in which he  narrates more important events, and reveals more lofty truths than all  the historians of Greece unfolded in their collective volumes,--a marvel  of historic art, a model of composition, an immortal work of genius, the  oldest and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10479"],[0,"Our Churches and Chapels: Their Parsons, Priests, & Congregations (#11)"],[1,"with apparent pleasure. We have not  inquired specially as to the fate of this cockle. It may still have  an existence in the sacred edifice, or it may have given way, as all  cockles must do in the end, whether in churches or private houses,  to hot-water arrangements. The pews in St. George's are of the old,  fashioned, patriarchal character. They are of all sizes an  irregularity quite refreshing peculiarises them; there are hardly  two alike in the building; and a study of the laws of variety must  have been made by those who had the management of their  construction. Private interests and family requirements have  probably regulated the size of them. Some of the pews are narrow and  hard to get into--a struggle has to be made before you can fairly  take possession; others are broader and easier to enter:  a few are  very capacious and might be legitimately licensed to carry a dozen  inside with safety; nearly all or them are lined with green baize,  much of which is now getting into the sere and yellow leaf period of  life; many of them are well-cushioned--green being the favourite  colour; and in about the same number Brussels carpets may be found.  There is a quiet, secluded coziness about the pews; the sides are  high; the fronts come up well; nobody can see much of you if care is  taken; and a position favourable to either recumbent ease or  horizontal sleep may be assumed in several of them with safety. The  general windows, excepting those in the chancel, are very plain; and  if it were not for a rim of amber-coloured glass here and there and  a fair average accumulation of dust on several of the squares, there  would be nothing at all to relieve their native simplicity. The  pillars supporting the nave are equally plain; the walls and ceiling  are almost entirely devoid of ornament:  and primitive white-wash  forms the most prominent colouring material. The gas stands, often  very elaborate in places of worship, have been made solely for use  here. Simple upright pipes, surmounted by ordinary burners  constitute their sum and substance. The pulpit lights are simpler.  Gas has not yet reached the place where the law and the prophets are  expounded. The orthodox mould candle reigns paramount on each side  of the pulpit; and its light appears to give satisfaction.    There is no Sunday school in connection with St. George's. In some  respects this may be a disadvantage to the neighbourhood; but it is  a source of comfort to the congregation, for all the noise which  irrepressible children create during service hours at every place  where they are penned up, is obviated. Neither children nor babes  are seen at St. George's. It is considered they are best at home,  and that they ought to stay there until the second teeth have been  fairly cut. The congregation of St. George's is specifically  fashionable. A few poor people may be seen on low seats in the  centre aisle; but the great majority of worshippers either  represent, or are connected with, what are termed \"good families.\"  Young ladies wearing on just one hair the latest of bonnets, and  elaborated with costly silks and ribbons; tender gentlemen of the  silver-headed cane school and the \"my deah fellah\" region; quiet  substantial looking men of advanced years, who believe in good  breeding and properly brushed clothes; elderly matrons, \"awfully  spiff\" as Lady Wortley Montague would say; and a few well-disposed  tradespeople who judiciously mingle piety with business, and never  make startling noises during their devotional moments--these make up  the congregational elements of St. George's. They may be described  in three words--few, serene, select. And this seems to have always  been the case. Years since, the historian of Lancashire said that  St. George's \"has at all times had a respectable, though not a very  numerous, congregation.\" The definition is as correct now as it was  then. The worshippers move in high spheres; the bulk of them toil  not, neither do they spin; and if they can afford it they are quite  justified in making life genteel and easy, and giving instructions  for other people to wait upon them. We dare say that if their piety  is not as rampant, it is quite as good, as that of other people.  Vehemence is not an indication of excellence, and people may be good  without either giving way to solemn war-whoops or damaging the  hearing faculties of their neighbours. Considering the situation of  St. George's Church--its proximity to Friargate and the unhallowed  passages running therefrom--there ought to be a better congregation.  Churches like beefsteaks are intended to benefit those around them.  It is not healthy for a church to have a congregation too select and  too fashionable. Souls are of more value than either purses or  clothes. More of the people living in the immediate neighbourhood of  St. George's ought to regularly visit it; very few of them ever go  near the place; but the fault may be their own, and neither the  parson's, nor the beadle's.    The choir of St. George's is a wonderfully good one, and whether the  members sing for love or money, or both, they deserve praise. Their  melody is fine; their precision good; their expression excellent.  They can give you a solemn piece with true abbandonatamente; they  can observe an accelerando with becoming taste; they can get into a  vigorosamente humour potently and on the shortest notice. They will  never be able to knock down masonry with their musical force like  the Jericho trumpeters, nor build up walls with their harmony like  Amphion; but they will always possess ability to sing psalms, hymns,  spiritual songs, and whatever may be contained in popular music  books, with taste and commendable exactitude. We recommend them to  the favourable consideration of the public. In St. George's Church  there is an organ which may be placed in the \"h c\" category. It is a  splendid instrument--can't be equalled in this part of the country  for either finery or music--and is played by a gentleman whose name  ranks in St. George's anthem book, with those of Beethoven, Handel,  and Mozart. We have heard excellent music sung and played at St.  George's; but matters would be improved if the efforts of the choir  were seconded. At present the singers have some time been what we  must term, for want of a better phrase, musical performers. They are  tremendously ahead of the congregation. Much of what they sing  cannot be joined in by the people. Many a time the congregation have  to look on and listen--ecstacised with what is being sung, wondering  what is coming next, and delightfully bewildered as to the whole  affair.    The minister at St. George's is the Rev. C. H. Wood--a quiet,  homely, well-built man, who is neither too finely dressed nor too  well paid. His salary is considerably under 200 pounds a year. Mr.  Wood is frank and unostentatious in manner; candid and calm in  language; and of a temperament so even that he gets into hot water  with nobody. You will never catch him with his virtuous blood up,  theologically or politically. He has a cool head and a quiet tongue-  -two excellent articles for general wear which three-fourths of the  parsons in this country have not yet heard of. He is well liked by  the male portion of his congregation, and is on excellent terms with  the fair sex. He is a batchelor, but that is his own fault. He could  be married any day, but prefers being his own master. He may have an  ideal like Dante, or a love phantom like Tasso, or an Imogene like  the brave Alonzo; but he has published neither poetry nor prose on  the subject yet, and has made no allusion to the matter in any of  his sermons. No minister in Preston, with similar means, is more  charitably disposed than Mr. Wood. He behaves well to poor people,  and the virtue of that is worth more than the lugubriousness or  eloquence of many homilies. Charity in purse as well as in speech is  one of his characteristics; and if that doth not cover a multitude  of ordinary defects nothing will. In the reading desk Mr Wood gets  through his work quickly and with a good voice. There is no effort  at elocution in his expression:  he goes right on with the business,  and if people miss the force of it they will have to be responsible  for the consequences. In the pulpit he drives forward in the same  earnest, matter-of-fact style. There is no hand flinging, hair-  wringing, or dramatic raging in his style. The matter of his sermons  is orthodox and homely--systematically arranged, innocently  illustrated at intervals, and offensive to nobody. His manner is  calculated to genially persuade rather than fiercely arouse; and it  will sooner rock you to sleep than lash you to tears. There is a  slight touch of sanctity at the end of his sentences--a mild  elevation of voice indicative of pious oiliness; but, altogether, we  like his quiet, straightforward, simple, English style. People fond  of Church of England ideas could not have a more genial place of  worship than St. George's:  the seats are easy and well lined, the  sermons short and placid, and the company good.        ST. AUGUSTINE'S CATHOLIC CHURCH.        St. Augustine's Catholic Church, Preston, is of a retiring  disposition; it occupies a very southern position; is neither in the  town nor out of it; and unlike many sacred edifices is more than 50  yards from either a public-house or a beershop. Clean-looking  dwellings immediately confront it; green fields take up the  background; an air of quietude, half pastoral, half genteel,  pervades it; but this ecclesiastical rose has its thorn. Only in its  proximate surroundings is the place semi-rural and select. As the  circle widens--townwards at any rate--you soon get into a region of  murky houses, ragged children, running beer jugs, poverty; and as  you move onwards, in certain directions, the plot thickens, until  you get into the very lairs of ignorance, depravity, and misery.
