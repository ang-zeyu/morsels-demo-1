This apology for a steam-boat formed a considerable contrast with the  superbly-appointed vessels we had lately been passengers in on the  Ontario and the St. Laurence. But the circumstance of a steamer at all  on the Otanabee was a matter of surprise to us, and of exultation to the  first settlers along its shores, who for many years had been contented  with no better mode of transport than a scow or a canoe for themselves  and their marketable produce, or through the worst possible roads with a  waggon or sleigh.    The Otanabee is a fine broad, clear stream, divided into two mouths at  its entrance to the Rice Lake by a low tongue of land, too swampy to be  put under cultivation. This beautiful river (for such I consider it to  be) winds its way between thickly-wooded banks, which rise gradually as  you advance higher up the country.    Towards noon the mists cleared off, and the sun came forth in all the  brilliant beauty of a September day. So completely were we sheltered  from the wind by the thick wall of pines on either side, that I no  longer felt the least inconvenience from the cold that had chilled me on  crossing the lake in the morning.    To the mere passing traveller, who cares little for the minute beauties  of scenery, there is certainly a monotony in the long and unbroken line  of woods, which insensibly inspires a feeling of gloom almost touching  on sadness. Still there are objects to charm and delight the close  observer of nature. His eye will be attracted by fantastic bowers, which  are formed by the scarlet creeper (or Canadian ivy) and the wild vine,  flinging their closely-entwined wreaths of richly tinted foliage from  bough to bough of the forest trees, mingling their hues with the  splendid rose-tipped branches of the soft maple, the autumnal tints of  which are unrivalled in beauty by any of our forest trees at home.    The purple clusters of the grape, by no means so contemptible in size as  I had been led to imagine, looked tempting to my longing eyes, as they  appeared just ripening among these forest bowers. I am told the juice  forms a delicious and highly-flavoured jelly, boiled with sufficient  quantity of sugar; the seeds are too large to make any other preparation  of them practicable. I shall endeavour, at some time or other, to try  the improvement that can be effected by cultivation. One is apt to  imagine where Nature has so abundantly bestowed fruits, that is the most  favourable climate for their attaining perfection with the assistance of  culture and soil.    [Illustration: Silver Pine]    The waters of the Otanabee are so clear and free from impurity that you  distinctly see every stone-pebble or shell at the bottom. Here and there  an opening in the forest reveals some tributary stream, working its way  beneath the gigantic trees that meet above it. The silence of the scene  is unbroken but by the sudden rush of the wild duck, disturbed from its  retreat among the shrubby willows, that in some parts fringe the left  bank, or the shrill cry of the kingfisher, as it darts across the water.  The steam-boat put in for a supply of fire-wood at a clearing about  half-way from Peterborough, and I gladly availed myself of the  opportunity of indulging my inclination for gathering some of the  splendid cardinal flowers that grew among the stones by the river's  brink. Here, too, I plucked as sweet a rose as ever graced an English  garden. I also found, among the grass of the meadow-land, spearmint,  and, nearer to the bank, peppermint. There was a bush resembling our  hawthorn, which, on examination, proved to be the cockspur hawthorn,  with fruit as large as cherries, pulpy, and of a pleasant tartness not  much unlike to tamarinds. The thorns of this tree were of formidable  length and strength. I should think it might be introduced with great  advantage to form live fences; the fruit, too, would prove by no means  contemptible as a preserve.    As I felt a great curiosity to see the interior of a log-house, I  entered the open door-way of the tavern, as the people termed it, under  the pretext of buying a draught of milk. The interior of this rude  dwelling presented no very inviting aspect. The walls were of rough  unhewn logs, filled between the chinks with moss and irregular wedges of  wood to keep out the wind and rain. The unplastered roof displayed the  rafters, covered with moss and lichens, green, yellow, and grey; above  which might be seen the shingles, dyed to a fine mahogany-red by the  smoke which refused to ascend the wide clay and stone chimney, to curl  gracefully about the roof, and seek its exit in the various crannies and  apertures with which the roof and sides of the building abounded.    The floor was of earth, which had become pretty hard and smooth through  use. This hut reminded me of the one described by the four Russian  sailors that were left to winter on the island of Spitzbergen. Its  furniture was of corresponding rudeness; a few stools, rough and  unplaned; a deal table, which, from being manufactured from unseasoned  wood, was divided by three wide open seams, and was only held together  by its ill-shaped legs; two or three blocks of grey granite placed  beside the hearth served for seats for the children, with the addition  of two beds raised a little above the ground by a frame of split cedars.  On these lowly couches lay extended two poor men, suffering under the  wasting effects of lake-fever. Their yellow bilious faces strangely  contrasted with the gay patchwork-quilts that covered them. I felt much  concerned for the poor emigrants, who told me they had not been many  weeks in the country when they were seized with the fever and ague. They  both had wives and small children, who seemed very miserable. The wives  also had been sick with ague, and had not a house or even shanty of  their own up; the husbands having fallen ill were unable to do anything;  and much of the little money they had brought out with them had been  expended in board and lodging in this miserable place, which they  dignified by the name of tavern. I cannot say I was greatly prepossessed  in favour of their hostess, a harsh, covetous woman. Besides the various  emigrants, men, women, and children, that lodged within the walls, the  log-house had tenants of another description. A fine calf occupied a pen  in a corner; some pigs roamed grunting about in company with some half-  dozen fowls. The most attractive objects were three snow-white pigeons,  that were meekly picking up crumbs, and looking as if they were too pure  and innocent to be inhabitants of such a place.    Owing to the shallowness of the river at this season, and to the rapids,  the steam-boat is unable to go up the whole way to Peterborough, and a  scow or rowboat, as it is sometimes termed--a huge, unwieldy, flat-  bottomed machine--meets the passengers at a certain part of the river,  within sight of a singular pine tree on the right bank; this is termed  the \"Yankee bonnet,\" from the fancied resemblance of the topmost boughs  to a sort of cap worn by the Yankees, not much unlike the blue bonnet of  Scotland.    Unfortunately, the steamer ran aground some four miles below the usual  place of rendezvous, and we waited till near four o'clock for the scow.  When it made its appearance, we found, to our discomfort, the rowers  (eight in number, and all Irishmen) were under the exciting influence of  a cag of whiskey, which they had drunk dry on the voyage. They were  moreover exasperated by the delay on the part of the steamer, which gave  them four miles additional heavy rowing. Beside a number of passengers  there was an enormous load of furniture, trunks, boxes, chests, sacks of  wheat, barrels of flour, salt, and pork, with many miscellaneous  packages and articles, small and great, which were piled to a height  that I thought very unsafe both to goods and passengers.    With a marvellous ill grace the men took up their oars when their load  was completed, but declared they would go on shore and make a fire and  cook their dinners, they not having eaten any food, though they had  taken large potations of the whiskey. This measure was opposed by some  of the gentlemen, and a fierce and angry scene ensued, which ended in  the mutineers flinging down their oars, and positively refusing to row  another stroke till they had satisfied their hunger.    Perhaps I had a fellow-feeling for them, as I began to be exceedingly  hungry, almost ravenous, myself, having fasted since six that morning;  indeed, so faint was I, that I was fain to get my husband to procure me  a morsel of the coarse uninviting bread that was produced by the rowers,  and which they ate with huge slices of raw pickled pork, seasoning this  unseemly meal with curses \"not loud but deep,\" and bitter taunts against  those who prevented them from cooking their food like _Christians_.    While I was eagerly eating the bit of bread, an old farmer, who had eyed  me for some time with a mixture of curiosity and compassion, said, \"Poor  thing: well, you do seem hungry indeed, and I dare say are just out from  the _ould_ country, and so little used to such hard fare. Here are some  cakes that my woman (i.e. wife) put in my pocket when I left home; I  care nothing for them, but they are better than that bad bread; take  'em, and welcome.\" With these words he tossed some very respectable  home-made seed-cakes into my lap, and truly never was anything more  welcome than this seasonable refreshment.    A sullen and gloomy spirit seemed to prevail among our boatmen, which by  no means diminished as the evening drew on, and \"the rapids were near.\"  The sun had set, and the moon and stars rose brilliantly over the still  waters, which gave back the reflections"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13568"],[0,"Woman Suffrage By Federal Constitutional Amendment (#11)"],[1,"has been some attempt on the part of those opposed      to women voting to make it appear that in San Francisco      particularly, women were slow to register and loth to vote.      The fact is always suppressed that there are never less      than 132 men to every 100 women in the city and that women      therefore should properly be only forty-three per cent. of the      total number of voting adults. At the last mayoralty election      the women unquestionably re-elected the incumbent as against      Eugene Schmitz of graft-prosecution fame, who tried to 'come      back.' In this election women constituted thirty-seven per      cent. of the total registered vote and the women of the best      residence districts voted in the proportion of forty-two      to forty-four per cent. of the total vote cast in those      precincts; while in the downtown, tenderloin and dance-hall      districts women constituted only twenty-seven per cent. of      the registration and negligible portion of the vote. These      proportions have been substantially maintained in minor      elections since, and were slightly increased in the National      election of November, 1916, when they comprised thirty-nine      per cent. of the registration and voted within two per cent.      as heavily as men.\"    From no state comes the report that women have not used their vote.  The evidence that they do use it has been so largely distributed  through the press, that more definite proof seems unnecessary, even  were it possible to secure it. The following bits of testimony taken  from press reports are of interest:    In WYOMING, out of 45,000 registered voters, 20,000 are reported  as women. But Wyoming has 219 men to every 100 women of voting age.  Therefore to compare favorably with Wyoming's 20,000 women voters  there should the 53,800 men.           *       *       *       *       *    In MONTANA, one-third of a registration of 255,000 is made up of  women. Montana has 189.6 men to every 100 women. As there were only  81,741 women of voting age in Montana in 1910, the present number,  85,000, must mean that nearly every woman in the state voted in 1916.           *       *       *       *       *    About 40% of UTAH'S 130,000 registration is made up of women. Utah has  6 men of voting age to every 5 women, 20% more men than women.           *       *       *       *       *    In IDAHO, out of a registration of 95,000, there are 40,000 women.  Idaho has more than half as many again men as women. Therefore to  have a fifty-fifty representation at the polls, Idaho should have  registered 60,000 men instead of 55,000 to match its 40,000 women.      IV. CONSTITUENCY HAS INSTRUCTED AGAINST SUFFRAGE.    This objection is urged by members in whose states there have been  referenda on the subject in recent years with adverse results. Members  of Congress are apportioned among the several states according to  population and are constitutionally obligated to represent women as  well as men. As the electors of no constituency have voted solidly  against woman suffrage, such objectors are accepting instructions  from less than half their adult constituents and often from less than  one-fourth. Women have had no opportunity to speak for themselves. As  a matter of very suggestive fact, thirty-five members of Congress,  who upon interview have expressed opposition to the Federal Amendment,  were elected by minorities. Some of these represent states which  have had a referendum on woman suffrage and were elected by a smaller  number of total votes than their respective districts gave the  suffrage amendment. These are such curious facts, that it is difficult  to believe in the sincerity of the objection. That men and elements  which have contributed money and work to secure the election of a  member of Congress instruct him how to vote is more believable. For  the sake of the common welfare of the American people, it is well,  that the number of such members is probably few.      V. POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY. The South professes to fear the increased  Negro vote; the North, the increased Foreign vote; the rich, the  increased labor vote; the conservative, the increased illiterate  vote. The Republicans since the recent presidential election fear  the increased Democratic vote; the Democrats fear the woman voters'  support was only temporary. The \"wet\" fears the increased dry vote;  the \"dry\" the increased controlled wet vote. Certain very numerous  elements fear the increased Catholic vote and still others the  increased Jewish vote. The Orthodox Protestant and Catholic fear  the increased free-thinking vote and the free-thinkers are decidedly  afraid of the increased church vote. Labor fears the increased  influence of the capitalistic class, and capitalists, especially of  the manufacturing group, are extremely disturbed at the prospect of  votes being extended to their women employees. Certain groups fear the  increased Socialist vote and certain Socialists fear the \"lady vote.\"  Party men fear women voters will have no party consciousness and prove  so independent as to disintegrate the party. Radical or progressive  elements fear that women will be \"stand-pat\" partisans. Ballot  reformers fear the increased corrupt vote and corruptionists fear  the increased reform vote. Militarists are much alarmed lest women  increase the peace vote and, despite the fact that the press of the  country has poured forth increasing evidence that the women of every  belligerent country have borne their full share of the war burden  with such unexpected skill and ability that the authorities have been  lavish in acknowledgment, seem certain that women of the United  States will prove the exception to the world's rule and show the white  feather if war threatens.    Ridiculous as this list of objections may appear, each is supported  earnestly by a considerable group, and collectively they furnish the  basis of opposition to woman suffrage in and out of Congress.    The answer to one is the answer to all.    Government by \"the people\" is expedient or it is not. If it is  expedient, then obviously _all_ the people must be included. If it  is not expedient, the simplest logic leads to the conclusion that the  classes to be deprived of the franchise should be determined by their  qualities of unfitness for the vote. If education, intelligence,  grasp of public questions, patriotism, willingness and ability to give  public service, respect of law, are selected as fair qualifications  for those to be entrusted with the vote and the opposite as the  qualities of those to be denied the vote, it follows that men and  women will be included in the classes adjudged fit to vote, and also  in those adjudged unfit to vote. Meanwhile the system which admits the  unworthy to the vote provided they are men, and shuts out the  worthy provided they are women, is so unjust and illogical that its  perpetuation is a sad reflection upon American thinking.    The clear thinker will arrive at the conclusion that women must be  included in the electorate if our country wishes to be consistent with  the principles it boasts as fundamental. The shortest method to secure  this enfranchisement is the quickest method to extricate our country  from the absurdity of its present position.      VI. THE LOW STANDARDS OF CITIZENSHIP which lead to controlled votes,  bribery and various forms of corruptions, will be accentuated by  woman suffrage with the doubling of every dangerous element, hence  any effort to postpone its coming is justifiable. Woman suffrage will  increase the proportion of _intelligent voters_. According to the  Commissioners of Education there are now one-third more girls in the  high schools of the country than boys. In 1914, the latest figures,  64,491 boys were graduated from the high schools of the United States  and 96,115 girls. In the normal schools the educational report for  1915 states that 80 per cent. of the pupils were girls. The Census of  1910 reports a larger number of illiterate men than illiterate women.    Woman suffrage would increase the _moral_ vote. Only one out of every  twenty criminals are women. Women constitute a minority of drunkards  and petty misdemeanants, and in all the factors that tend to handicap  the progress of society women form a minority; whereas in churches,  schools and all organizations working for the uplift of humanity,  women are a majority. In all American states and countries that  have adopted equal suffrage the vote of the disreputable woman is  practically negligible, the slum wards of cities invariably having the  lightest woman vote and the respectable residence wards the heaviest.  Woman suffrage would increase the number of _native born voters_ as  for every 100 foreign white women immigrants coming to this country  there are 129 men, while among Asiatic immigrants the men outnumber  the women two to one, according to the Census of 1910.    Woman suffrage would help to _correct election procedure_. In all  states where women vote, the polling booths have been moved into  homes, church parlors, school houses or other similar respectable  places. Women serve as election officials and the subduing influence  of woman's presence elsewhere has had its effect upon the elections.  Women greatly increase the number of competent persons who can be  drawn upon as election officials. No class of persons in the nation  is so well trained as school teachers for this work. The presence of  women as voters and officials would in itself eliminate certain  types of irregularity and go a long way toward establishing a higher  standard of election procedure. Woman suffrage cannot possibly make  political conditions worse, since all the elements which combine to  produce those conditions are less conspicuous among women than men. On  the other hand the introduction of a new class possessing a very  large number of persons who would unwillingly"]]]
