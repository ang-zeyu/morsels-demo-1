Long were his arms, pallid his hands; his mouth    Looked ghastly in the moonlight: from behind,    A mile-stone propped him; I could also ken    That he was clothed in military garb.    Though faded, yet entire. Companionless,    No dog attending, by no staff sustained,    He stood, and in his very dress appeared    A desolation, a simplicity,    To which the trappings of a gaudy world    Make a strange back-ground. From his lips, ere long,    Issued low muttered sounds, as if of pain    Or some uneasy thought; yet still his form    Kept the same awful steadiness--at his feet    His shadow lay, and moved not. From self-blame    Not wholly free, I watched him thus; at length    Subduing my heart's specious cowardice,    I left the shady nook where I had stood    And hailed him. Slowly from his resting-place    He rose, and with a lean and wasted arm    In measured gesture lifted to his head    Returned my salutation; then resumed    His station as before: and when I asked    His history, the veteran, in reply,    Was neither slow nor eager; but, unmoved,    And with a quiet, uncomplaining voice,    A stately air of mild indifference,    He told in few plain words a soldier's tale--    That in the Tropic Islands he had served,    Whence he had landed scarcely three weeks past;    That on his landing he had been dismissed,    And now was traveling toward his native home.    This heard, I said, in pity, \"Come with me.\"    He stooped, and straightway from the ground took up,    An oaken staff by me yet unobserved--    A staff which must have dropt from his slack hand    And lay till now neglected in the grass.    Though weak his step and cautious, he appeared    To travel without pain, and I beheld,    With an astonishment but ill-suppressed,    His ghostly figure moving at my side;    Nor could I, while we journeyed thus, forbear    To turn from present hardships to the past,    And speak of war, battle, and pestilence,    Sprinkling this talk with questions, better spared.    On what he might himself have seen or felt    He all the while was in demeanor calm.    Concise in answer: solemn and sublime    He might have seen, but that in all he said    There was a strange half-absence, as of one    Knowing too well the importance of his theme    But feeling it no longer. Our discourse    Soon ended, and together on we passed    In silence through a wood gloomy and still.    Up-turning, then, along an open field,    We reached a cottage. At the door I knocked.    And earnestly to charitable care    Commended him as a poor friendless man,    Belated and by sickness overcome.    Assured that now the traveler would repose    In comfort, I entreated that henceforth    He would not linger in the public ways,    But ask for timely furtherance and help    Such as his state required. At this reproof,    With the same ghastly mildness in his look,    He said, \"My trust is in the God of Heaven,    And in the eye of him who passes me!\"      The cottage door was speedily unbarred,    And now the soldier touched his hat once more    With his lean hand, and in a faltering voice,    Whose tone bespake reviving interests    Till then unfelt, he thanked me; I returned    The farewell blessing of the patient man,    And so we parted. Back I cast a look,    And lingered near the door a little space,    Then sought with quiet heart my distant home.

The end of so perilous and novel a journey, which must necessarily,  under the most favorable circumstances, have produced more honor  than profit, was attained; and yet the success of the adventure was  doubtful. The season was still too cold for any search for fossil  ivory, and the first serious duty was the erection of a winter  residence. Fortunately there was an ample supply of logs of wood, some  half-rotten, some green, lying under the snow on the shores of the bay  into which the river poured, and which had been deposited there by  the currents and waves. A regular pile, too, was found, which had been  laid up by some of the provident natives of New Siberia, who, like  the Esquimaux, live in the snow. Under this was a large supply of  frozen fish, which was taken without ceremony, the party being near  starvation. Of course Sakalar and Ivan intended replacing the hoard,  if possible, in the short summer.    Wood was made the groundwork of the winter hut which was to be  erected, but snow and ice formed by far the larger portion of the  building materials. So hard and compact did the whole mass become when  finished, and lined with bear-skins and other furs, that a huge lamp  sufficed for warmth during the day and night, and the cooking was  done in a small shed by the side. The dogs were now set to shift for  themselves as to cover, and were soon buried in the snow. They were  placed on short allowance, now they had no work to do, for no one yet  knew what were the resources of this wild place.    As soon as the more immediate duties connected with a camp had been  completed, the whole party occupied themselves with preparing traps  for foxes, and in other hunting details. A hole was broken in the  ice in the bay, and this the Kolimsk men watched with assiduity for  seals. One or two rewarded their efforts, but no fish were taken.  Sakalar and Ivan, after a day or two of repose, started with some  carefully-selected dogs in search of game, and soon found that the  great white bear took up his quarters even in that northern latitude.  They succeeded in killing several, which the dogs dragged home.    About ten days after their arrival in the great island, Sakalar, who  was always the first to be moving, roused his comrades round him just  as a party of a dozen strange men appeared in the distance. They were  short, stout fellows, with long lances in their hands, and by their  dress very much resembled the Esquimaux. Their attitude was menacing  in the extreme, and by the advice of Sakalar, a general volley was  fired over their heads. The invaders halted, looked confusedly around,  and then ran away. Firearms retained. therefore, all their pristine  qualities with these savages.    \"They will return,\" said Sakalar, moodily; \"they did the same when  I was here before, and then came back and killed my friend at night.  Sakalar escaped.\"    Counsel was now held, and it was determined, after due deliberation,  that strict watch should be kept at all hours, while much was  necessarily trusted to the dogs. All day one of the party was on the  lookout, while at night the hut had its entrance well barred. Several  days, however, were thus passed without molestation, and then Sakalar  took the Kolimsk men out to hunt, and left Ivan and Kolina together.  The young man had learned the value of his half-savage friend: her  devotion to her father and the party generally was unbounded. She  murmured neither at privations nor at sufferings, and kept up the  courage of Ivan by painting in glowing terms all his brilliant future.  She seemed to have laid aside her personal feelings, and to look on  him only as one doing battle with fortune in the hope of earning the  hand of the rich widow of Yakoutsk. But Ivan was much disposed to  gloomy fits; he supposed himself forgotten, and slighted, and looked  on the time of his probation as interminable. It was in this mood that  one day he was roused from his fit by a challenge from Kolina to go  and see if the seals had come up to breathe at the hole which every  morning was freshly broken in the ice. Ivan assented, and away they  went gaily down to the bay. No seals were there, and after a short  stay they returned toward the hut, recalled by the distant howling  of the dogs. But as they came near, they could see no sign of men or  animals, though the sensible brutes still whined under the shelter  of their snow-heaps. Ivan, much surprised, raised the curtain of the  door, his gun in hand, expecting to find that some animal was inside.  The lamp was out, and the hut in total darkness. Before Ivan could  recover his upright position, four men leaped on him, and he was a  prisoner.    Kolina drew back, and cocked her gun; but the natives, satisfied  with their present prey, formed round Ivan in a compact body, tied  his hands, and bade him walk. Their looks were sufficiently wild  and menacing to make him move, especially as he recognized them  as belonging to the warlike party of the Tchouktchas--a tribe of  Siberians who wander about the Polar Seas in search of game, who cross  Behring's Straits in skin-boats, and who probably are the only persons  who by their temporary sojourn in New Siberia, have caused some to  suppose it inhabited. Kolina stood uncertain what to do, but in a few  minutes she roused four of the dogs, and followed. Ivan bawled to her  to go back, but the girl paid no attention to his request, determined,  as it seemed, to know his fate.    The savages hurried Ivan along as rapidly as they could; and soon  entered a deep and narrow ravine, which about the middle parted into  two. The narrowest path was selected, and the dwelling of the natives  soon reached. It was a cavern, the narrow entrance of which they  crawled through; Ivan followed the leader, and soon found himself in  a large and wonderful cave. It was by nature divided into several  compartments, and contained a party of twenty men, as many or more  women, and numerous children. It was warmed in two ways--by wood-fires  and grease-lamps, and by a bubbling semi-sulphurous spring, that  rushed up through a narrow hole, and then fell away into a deep well,  that carried its warm waters to mingle with the icy sea.

An _enormously large  proportion_ flounder blindly into the mire before they know what it  is, not necessarily, but very often into the defilement of evil habit,  but, still more often, into the tainted air of diseased opinion, and  after a few years _some of them_ emerge saved, but so as by fire.\"[B]    [Footnote B: Pages 4 _et seq._: the italics are mine.]    The following are quotations from the _Upton Letters_, written by Mr.  A.C. Benson. Mr. Benson is one of the most distinguished of modern  teachers: he has had long experience of public-school life both as a  boy and as a master: he has that insight into the heart of boyhood  which can come only to one who has affectionate sympathy with boys and  has been the recipient of their confidences. It will be abundantly  evident from the passages which follow that in Mr. Benson's opinion no  boy is likely to preserve his \"innocence\" in passing through a public  school.    \"The subject is so unpleasant that many masters dare not speak of it  at all, and excuse themselves by saying that they don't want to put  ideas into boys' heads. I cannot conscientiously believe that a man  who has been through a big public school himself can honestly be  afraid of that.\" \"The standard of purity is low: a vicious boy does  not find his vicious tendencies by any means a bar to social success.\"  This, of course, assumes that the vicious tendencies are a matter of  notoriety. A similar implication is involved in the following: \"I do  not mean to say that there are not many boys who are both pure-minded  and honest; but they treat such virtues as a secret preference of  their own, and do not consider that it is in the least necessary to  interfere with the practice of others or even to disapprove of it.\" He  further gives it as his opinion that \"The deadly and insidious  temptation of impurity has, as far as one can learn, increased,\" and  tells us \"An innocent-minded boy whose natural inclination to purity  gave way before perpetual temptation and even compulsion might be  thought to have erred, but would have scanty, if any, expression of  either sympathy or pity from other boys; while if he breathed the  least hint of his miserable position to a master and the fact came  out, he would be universally scouted.... One hears of simply  heart-rending cases where a boy dare not even tell his parents of what  he endures.\" It would thus appear that in some of the premier schools  of the world impurity is a matter of notoriety, sometimes of  compulsion; and that, to a boy's own strong inclination to  concealment, is superadded, by the public opinion of the school, an  imperious command that this concealment shall, even in heart-rending  cases, be maintained.    No one, I think, will maintain that private schools _as a class_ are  in the least degree lees corrupt than public schools; while there are,  I am sure, at least a few schools in which public opinion condemns  _open_ impurity, and will not tolerate impure talk. And while I am  confident that it is possible, not merely to attain this condition in  a school, but also to reduce private impurity to a negligible  quantity, impurity--in one form or another--is, in general, so widely  spread in boys' schools of every type, that it is difficult to  understand how anyone familiar with school life can doubt its  prevalence.    Let us now consider the opinion of Dr. Clement Dukes, the medical  officer of Rugby School and the greatest English authority on school  hygiene. In the preface to the fourth edition of his well-known work  _Health at School_, Dr. Dukes writes: \"I have studied children in all  their phases and stages for many years--two years at the Hospital for  Sick Children in 61 Ormond Street, London, followed by thirty-three  years at Rugby School--a professional history which has provided me  with an almost unique experience in all that relates to the Health and  Disease of Childhood and Youth, and has compelled constant and steady  thought upon every aspect of this problem.\" In an earlier work, _The  Preservation of Health_, Dr. Dukes gives his estimate of the  prevalence of masturbation, and quotes the opinion of other  authorities whose credentials he has verified; In this work, on page  150, he writes of masturbation: \"I believe that the reason why it is  so widespread an evil--amounting, I gather, although from the nature  of the case no complete evidence can ever be accurately obtained, to  somewhere _about 90 to 95 per cent. of all boys at boarding-schools_--is  because the boy leaves his home in the first instance without one word  of warning from his parents ... and thus falls into evil ways from his  innocence and ignorance alone.... This immorality is estimated by some  at 80 per cent., by others at 90 per cent. Another says that not 10  per cent. are innocent. Another that it has always begun at from eight  to twelve years of age. Others that it is always worst amongst the  elder boys. Others that 'it is universal.'\" Professor Stanley Hall,  in his great work on _Adolescence_, after a similar and exhaustive  review of the numerous works on this subject in different languages,  concludes: \"The whole literature on the subject attests that whenever  careful researches have been undertaken the results are appalling as  to prevalence.\" And yet there are people who deprecate purity-teaching  for boys because they feel that a boy's natural modesty is quite a  sufficient protection, and that there is danger of destroying a boy's  innocence by putting ideas into his head! To hear such people talk,  and to listen to the way in which they speak of self-abuse as though  it implied monstrous moral perversion, one would think that the  condition of morals when they were young was wholly different. The  great novelist Thackeray gives little countenance to this opinion when  he writes in _Pendennis_: \"And, by the way, ye tender mothers and  sober fathers of Christian families, a prodigious thing that theory of  life is as orally learned at a great public school. Why if you could  hear those boys of fourteen who blush before mothers and sneak off in  silence in the presence of their daughters, talking among each  other--it would be the woman's turn to blush then. Before he was  twelve years old little Pen had heard talk enough to make him quite  awfully wise upon certain points--and so, madam, has your pretty  rosy-cheeked son, who is coming home from school for the ensuing  holidays. I don't say that the boy is lost, or that the innocence has  left him which he had from 'Heaven, which is our home,' but that the  shades of the prison-house are closing fast over him, and that we are  helping as much as possible to corrupt him.\"    Before concluding this chapter I would caution the reader against the  error of supposing that the opinions expressed by Canon Lyttelton and  Dr. Dukes are indicative merely of the conditions they have met at  Haileybury, Eton, and Rugby. They are equally significant of the  conditions which obtain in the innumerable schools from which  Haileybury, Eton, and Rugby are recruited; and as there is no reason  why other preparatory schools should differ from these, they are  significant of the almost universal condition of boys' schools.          CHAPTER III.    CAUSES OF THE PREVALENCE OF IMPURITY AMONG BOYS.      The evidence I have adduced in the previous chapters will convince  most of my readers that few boys retain their innocence after they are  of school age. There may, however, be a few who find it impossible to  reconcile this conclusion with their ideas of boy nature. I will  therefore now examine current conceptions on this subject and expose  their fundamental inaccuracy.    There are some people who imagine that a boy's innate modesty is quite  sufficient protection against defilement. Does experience really  warrant any such conclusion? Those who know much of children will  recognise the fact that even the cardinal virtues of truthfulness and  honesty have often to be learned, and that ideas of personal  cleanliness, of self-restraint in relation to food, and of  consideration for others have usually to be implanted and fostered.  Among people of refinement these virtues are often so early learned  that there is danger lest we should consider them innate. The  susceptibility of some children to suggestions conveyed to them by the  example and precept of their elders is almost unlimited. Hence a  child may, at two, have given up the trick of clearing its nostrils  with the finger-nail, and may, before five, have learned most of the  manners and virtues of refined people. The majority, however, take  longer to learn these things, so that a jolly little chap of ten or  twelve is often by no means scrupulously clean in hands, nails, ears,  and teeth, is often distinctly greedy, and sometimes far from  truthful.    That cleanliness and virtue are acquired and not innate is obvious  enough from the fact that children who grow up among dirty and  unprincipled people are rarely clean and virtuous. Were it possible  for the child of refined parents to grow up without example or precept  in relation to table manners and morals, except the example and advice  of vulgar people, who would expect refinement and consideration from  him? Is there anyone who has such faith in innate refinement that he  would be content to let a child of his own, grow up without a hint on  these matters, and with such example only as was supplied by  association with vulgar people? Yet this is precisely what we do in  relation to the subject of personal purity. The child has no good  example to guide him. The extent to which temptation comes to those  whom he respects, the manner in which they comport themselves when  tempted, the character of their sex"]]]
