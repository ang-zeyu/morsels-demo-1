In the  foreground we could see the soldiers standing like so many gray  wolves silhouetted against the red flames. In that light it did seem  that motives other than pure affection might have prompted the  Police Commissioner's action. The hectic sleep of the night was  broken by the endless clatter of the hoofs of the German cavalry  pushing south.    My courage rose, however, with the rising sun. In the morning I  climbed to the lookout on the hill. The hosts had vanished. A  trampled, smoldering fire-blackened land lay before me. But there  was the lure of the unknown. I walked down to where the great  Netherlands flag proclaimed neutral soil. The worried Dutch  pickets honored the signature of Souten and with one step I was  over the border into Belgium, now under German jurisdiction. The  helmeted soldiers across the way were a distinct disappointment.  They looked neither fierce nor fiery. In fact, they greeted me with a  smile. They were a bit puzzled by my paper, but the seal seemed  echt-Deutsch and they pronounced it \"gut, sehr gut.\" I explained  that I wished to go forwards to Liege.    \"Was it possible?\"    For answer they shrugged their shoulders.    \"Was it dangerous?\"    \"Not in the least,\" they assured me.    The Germans were right. It was not dangerous--that is, for the  Germans. By repeatedly proclaiming the everlasting friendship of  Germany and America, and passing out some chocolate, I made  good friends on the home base. They charged me only not to  return after sundown, giving point to their advice by relating how,  on the previous night, they had shot down a peasant woman and  her two children who, under the cloak of darkness, sought to  scurry past the sentinels. They told this with a genuine note of grief  in their voices. So, with a hearty hand-shake and wishes for the  best of luck, they waved adieu to me as I went swinging out on the  highroad to Liege.          Chapter VI    In The Black Wake Of The War        A half mile and I came for the first time actually face to face with  the wastage of war. There was what once was Mouland, the little  village I had seen burning the night before. The houses stood  roofless and open to the sky, like so many tombstones over a  departed people. The whitewashed outer walls were all shining in  the morning sun. Inside they were charred black, or blazing yet  with coals from the fire still slowly burning its way through wood  and plaster. Here and there a house had escaped the torch.    By some miracle in the smashed window of one of these houses a  bright red geranium blossomed. It seemed to cry for water, but I  dared not turn aside, for fear of a bullet from a lurking sentry. In  another a sewing-machine of American make testified to the thrift  and progressiveness of one household. In the last house as I left  the village a rocking-horse with its head stuck through the open  door smiled its wooden smile, as if at any rate it could keep good  cheer even though the roofs might fall.    My road now wound into the open country; and I was heartily glad  of it, for the hedges and the houses at Mouland provided fine  coverts for prowling German foragers or for Belgians looking for  revenge. Dead cows and horses and dogs with their sides ripped  open by bullets lay along the wayside. The roads were deep  printed with the hoofs of the cavalry. The grain-fields were  flattened out. Nine little crosses marked the place where nine  soldiers of the Kaiser fell.    This smiling countryside, teeming with one of the densest  populations in the world, had been stripped clean of every  inhabitant. Along the wasted way not the sign of a civilian, or for  that matter even a soldier, was to be seen. I was glad even of the  presence of a pig which, with her litter, was enjoying the unwonted  pleasure of rooting out her morning meal in a rich flower-garden.  She did not reciprocate, however, with any such fellow feeling.  Perhaps of late she had seen enough of the doings of the genus  homo. Surveying me as though I had been the author of all this  destruction, she gave a frightened snort and plunged into a nearby  thicket.    I craved companionship of any living creature to break the spell of  death and silence. I was destined to have the wish gratified in  abundance. Fifteen minutes brought me to the outskirts of Vise,  and there, coming over the hills and wending their way down to the  river, were two long lines of German soldiers escorting wagons of  the artillery and the commissariat. They came slowly and  noiselessly trudging on and I was upon them as they crossed the  main road before I realized it. The men were covered with dust; so  were the horses. The wagons were in their somber paint of gray.  There was something ominous and threatening in the long sullen  line which wound down over the hill. The soldiers were evidently  tired with the tedious uneventful march, and the drivers were  goaded to irritability by the difficulty of the descent. Could I have  retreated I would have done so with joy and would never have  stopped until my feet were set on Holland soil.    But I dared not do it. As the train came to a stop, I started bravely  across the road. A soldier, dropping his gun from his shoulder,  cried:    \"Halt!\"    \"Is this the way to Vise?\" I asked.    \"Perhaps it is,\" he replied, \"but what do you want in Vise?\"    As he spoke, he kept edging up, pointing his bayonet directly at  me. A bayonet will never look quite the same to me again. Total  retreat, as I remarked, was out of the question. My inward  anatomy, however, did the next best thing. As the bayonet point  came pressing forward, my stomach retired backward. I could feel  it distinctly making efforts to crawl behind my spine. At my first  word of German his face relaxed. Ditto my stomach.    \"You are an American,\" he said. \"Well, good for that. I don't know  what we would have done were you a Belgian. Our orders are to  suffer no Belgian in this whole district.\"    Then he began an apologia which I heard repeated identically  again and again, as if it were learned by rote: \"The Germans had  peacefully entered the land; boiling hot water was showered on  them from upper stories; they were shot at from houses and  hedges; many soldiers had thus been killed; the wells had been  poisoned. Such acts of treachery had necessarily brought  reprisals, etc., etc.\" It was the defense so regularly served up to  neutrals that we learned in time to reproduce it almost word for  word ourselves.    We all rise to the glorification of suffering little Belgium. Whatever  brief we may hold for her though, we ought not to picture even her  peasant people as a mild, meek and inoffensive lot. That isn't the  sort of stuff out of which her dogged and continuing resistance was  wrought. That isn't the mettle which for two weeks stopped up the  German tide before the Liege forts, giving the allies two weeks to  mobilize, and all they had asked the Belgians for was two or three  days of grace. But before the German avalanche hurled itself on  Liege it was this peasant population which bore the first brunt of  the battle.    A mistake in the branching roads brought this home to me. I  turned off in the direction of Verviers and was puzzled to see the  road on either side strewn with tree-trunks, their sprawling limbs  still green with leaves. It was along this highway that the invaders  first entered Belgium. The peasants, turning their axes loose on  the poplars and the royal elms that lined the road, had filled it with  a tangle of interlocking limbs.    The Imperial army arrived with cannon which could smash a fort to  pieces as though it were made of blue china, but of what avail  were these against such yielding obstructions? Maddened that  these shambling creatures of the soil should delay the military  promenade through this little land, officers rushed out and held  their pistols at the heads of the offenders, threatening to blow their  brains out if they did not speedily clear the way. Many a peasant  did not live to see his house go up in flames--his dwelling dyed by  his own blood was now turned into a funeral pyre. These were the  first sacrificial offerings of Belgium on the altar of her  independence.    I now entered Vise, or rather what once had been the little city of  Vise. It was almost completely annihilated and its three thousand  inhabitants scattered. Through the mass of smoking ruins I  pushed, with the paving-stones still hot beneath my feet. Quite  unawares I ran full tilt into a group of soldiers, looking as ugly and  dirty as the ruins amongst which they were prowling.    The green-gray field-uniform is a remarkable piece of obliterative  coloration. I had seen it blend with grass and trees, but in this  instance it fitted in so well with the stones and debris they were  poking over that I was right amongst them without warning. They  straightened up with a sudden start and scowled at me. Hollanders  and Belgians had faithfully assured me that such marauding bands  would shoot at sight. Here was an excellent test-case. Three  hundred marks, a gold watch and a lot of food which crammed my  pockets would be their booty.    I took the initiative with the bland inquiry, \"What are you hunting  for, corpses?\"    \"No,\" they responded, pointing to their mouths and stomachs,  \"awful hungry. Hunting something to eat.\"    I bade a mental farewell to my food-supplies as I emptied out my  pockets before these ravagers. I expected everything to be  grabbed with a summary demand for more. From these despoilers  of a countryside I was ready for any sort of a manifestation--any,  except the one that I received. With one accord they refused to  take any of my provisions. I recovered from my surprise sufficiently  to understand that they were thanking me for my good will while  they were constantly reiterating:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11431"],[0,"Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 1 (#11)"],[1,"by Shakespeare (1598).

When the wedding party stepped in, Robin Hood exclaimed, \"This  is no fit match; the bride shall be married only to the man of her  choice.\" Then, sounding his horn, Allin-a-Dale with four and twenty  bowmen entered the church. The bishop refused to marry the woman to  Allin till the banns had been asked three times, whereupon Robin  pulled off the bishop's gown, and invested Little John in it, who  asked the banns seven times, and performed the ceremony.--_Robin Hood  and Allin-a-Dale_ (a ballad).

Similar stories are told of admiral Benbow, Cynaegeros brother of the  poet AEschylos, Jaafer who carried the sacred banner of \"the prophet\"  in the battle of Muta, and of some others.      Whirled by the cannons' rage, in shivers torn,    His thighs far scattered o'er the waves are borne;    Bound to the mast the godlike hero stands,    Waves his proud sword and cheers his woeful hands:    Tho' winds and seas their wonted aid deny,    To yield he knows not; but he knows to die.
