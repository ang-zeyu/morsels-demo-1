My task, therefore, is to liberate the  Skeezers and the Flatheads and secure for them freedom and happiness. I  have no doubt I can accomplish this in time.\"    \"Just now, though, we're in a bad fix,\" asserted Dorothy. \"If Queen  Coo-ee-oh conquers to-morrow, she won't be nice to us, and if the  Su-dic conquers, he'll be worse.\"    \"Do not worry, dear,\" said Ozma, \"I do not think we are in danger,  whatever happens, and the result of our adventure is sure to be good.\"    Dorothy was not worrying, especially. She had confidence in her friend,  the fairy Princess of Oz, and she enjoyed the excitement of the events  in which she was taking part. So she crept into bed and fell asleep as  easily as if she had been in her own cosy room in Ozma's palace.    A sort of grating, grinding sound awakened her. The whole island seemed  to tremble and sway, as it might do in an earthquake. Dorothy sat up in  bed, rubbing her eyes to get the sleep out of them, and then found it  was daybreak.    Ozma was hurriedly dressing herself.    \"What is it?\" asked Dorothy, jumping out of bed.    \"I'm not sure,\" answered Ozma \"but it feels as if the island is  sinking.\"    As soon as possible they finished dressing, while the creaking and  swaying continued. Then they rushed into the living room of the house  and found Lady Aurex, fully dressed, awaiting them.    \"Do not be alarmed,\" said their hostess. \"Coo-ee-oh has decided to  submerge the island, that is all. But it proves the Flatheads are  coming to attack us.\"    \"What do you mean by sub-sub-merging the island?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Come here and see,\" was the reply.    Lady Aurex led them to a window which faced the side of the great dome  which covered all the village, and they could see that the island was  indeed sinking, for the water of the lake was already half way up the  side of the dome. Through the glass could be seen swimming fishes, and  tall stalks of swaying seaweeds, for the water was clear as crystal and  through it they could distinguish even the farther shore of the lake.    \"The Flatheads are not here yet,\" said Lady Aurex. \"They will come  soon, but not until all of this dome is under the surface of the water.\"    \"Won't the dome leak?\" Dorothy inquired anxiously.    \"No, indeed.\"    \"Was the island ever sub-sub-sunk before?\"    \"Oh, yes; on several occasions. But Coo-ee-oh doesn't care to do that  often, for it requires a lot of hard work to operate the machinery. The  dome was built so that the island could disappear. I think,\" she  continued, \"that our Queen fears the Flatheads will attack the island  and try to break the glass of the dome.\"    \"Well, if we're under water, they can't fight us, and we can't fight  them,\" asserted Dorothy.    \"They could kill the fishes, however,\" said Ozma gravely.    \"We have ways to fight, also, even though our island is under water,\"  claimed Lady Aurex. \"I cannot tell you all our secrets, but this island  is full of surprises. Also our Queen's magic is astonishing.\"    \"Did she steal it all from the three Adepts in Sorcery that are now  fishes?\"    \"She stole the knowledge and the magic tools, but she has used them as  the three Adepts never would have done.\"    By this time the top of the dome was quite under water and suddenly the  island stopped sinking and became stationary.    \"See!\" cried Lady Aurex, pointing to the shore. \"The Flatheads have  come.\"    On the bank, which was now far above their heads, a crowd of dark  figures could be seen.    \"Now let us see what Coo-ee-oh will do to oppose them,\" continued Lady  Aurex, in a voice that betrayed her excitement.       *     *     *     *     *    The Flatheads, pushing their way through the line of palm trees, had  reached the shore of the lake just as the top of the island's dome  disappeared beneath the surface. The water now flowed from shore to  shore, but through the clear water the dome was still visible and the  houses of the Skeezers could be dimly seen through the panes of glass.    \"Good!\" exclaimed the Su-dic, who had armed all his followers and had  brought with him two copper vessels, which he carefully set down upon  the ground beside him. \"If Coo-ee-oh wants to hide instead of fighting  our job will be easy, for in one of these copper vessels I have enough  poison to kill every fish in the lake.\"    \"Kill them, then, while we have time, and then we can go home again,\"  advised one of the chief officers.    \"Not yet,\" objected the Su-dic. \"The Queen of the Skeezers has defied  me, and I want to get her into my power, as well as to destroy her  magic. She transformed my poor wife into a Golden Pig, and I must have  revenge for that, whatever else we do.\"    \"Look out!\" suddenly exclaimed the officers, pointing into the lake;  \"something's going to happen.\"    From the submerged dome a door opened and something black shot swiftly  out into the water. The door instantly closed behind it and the dark  object cleaved its way through the water, without rising to the  surface, directly toward the place where the Flatheads were standing.    \"What is that?\" Dorothy asked the Lady Aurex.    \"That is one of the Queen's submarines,\" was the reply. \"It is all  enclosed, and can move under water. Coo-ee-oh has several of these  boats which are kept in little rooms in the basement under our village.  When the island is submerged, the Queen uses these boats to reach the  shore, and I believe she now intends to fight the Flatheads with them.\"    The Su-dic and his people knew nothing of Coo-ee-oh's submarines, so  they watched with surprise as the under-water boat approached them.  When it was quite near the shore it rose to the surface and the top  parted and fell back, disclosing a boat full of armed Skeezers. At the  head was the Queen, standing up in the bow and holding in one hand a  coil of magic rope that gleamed like silver.    The boat halted and Coo-ee-oh drew back her arm to throw the silver  rope toward the Su-dic, who was now but a few feet from her. But the  wily Flathead leader quickly realized his danger and before the Queen  could throw the rope he caught up one of the copper vessels and dashed  its contents full in her face!          Chapter Eleven    The Conquest of the Skeezers      Queen Coo-ee-oh dropped the rope, tottered and fell headlong into the  water, sinking beneath the surface, while the Skeezers in the submarine  were too bewildered toassist her and only stared at the ripples in the  water where she had disappeared. A moment later there arose to the  surface a beautiful White Swan. This Swan was of large size, very  gracefully formed, and scattered all over its white feathers were tiny  diamonds, so thickly placed that as the rays of the morning sun fell  upon them the entire body of the Swan glistened like one brilliant  diamond. The head of the Diamond Swan had a bill of polished gold and  its eyes were two sparkling amethysts.    \"Hooray!\" cried the Su-dic, dancing up and down with wicked glee. \"My  poor wife, Rora, is avenged at last. You made her a Golden Pig,  Coo-ee-oh, and now I have made you a Diamond Swan. Float on your lake  forever, if you like, for your web feet can do no more magic and you  are as powerless as the Pig you made of my wife!    \"Villain! Scoundrel!\" croaked the Diamond Swan. \"You will be punished  for this. Oh, what a fool I was to let you enchant me!    \"A fool you were, and a fool you are!\" laughed the Su-dic, dancing  madly in his delight. And then he carelessly tipped over the other  copper vessel with his heel and its contents spilled on the sands and  were lost to the last drop.    The Su-dic stopped short and looked at the overturned vessel with a  rueful countenance.    \"That's too bad--too bad!\" he exclaimed sorrowfully. \"I've lost all the  poison I had to kill the fishes with, and I can't make any more because  only my wife knew the secret of it, and she is now a foolish Pig and  has forgotten all her magic.\"    \"Very well,\" said the Diamond Swan scornfully, as she floated upon the  water and swam gracefully here and there. \"I'm glad to see you are  foiled. Your punishment is just beginning, for although you have  enchanted me and taken away my powers of sorcery you have still the  three magic fishes to deal with, and they'll destroy you in time, mark  my words.\"    The Su-dic stared at the Swan a moment. Then he yelled to his men:    \"Shoot her! Shoot the saucy bird!\"    They let fly some arrows at the Diamond Swan, but she dove under the  water and the missiles fell harmless. When Coo-ce-oh rose to the  surface she was far from the shore and she swiftly swam across the lake  to where no arrows or spears could reach her.    The Su-dic rubbed his chin and thought what to do next. Near by floated  the submarine in which the Queen had come, but the Skeezers who were in  it were puzzled what to do with themselves. Perhaps they were not sorry  their cruel mistress had been transformed into a Diamond Swan, but the  transformation had left them quite helpless. The under-water boat was  not operated by machinery, but by certain mystic words uttered by  Coo-ee-oh. They didn't know how to submerge it, or how to make the  water-tight shield cover them again, or how to make the boat go back to  the castle, or make it enter the little basement room where it was  usually kept. As a matter of fact, they were now shut out of their  village under the Great Dome and could not get back again. So one of  the men called to the Supreme Dictator of the Flatheads, saying:    \"Please make us prisoners and take us to your mountain, and feed and  keep us, for we have nowhere to go.\"    Then the Su-dic laughed and answered:    \"Not so. I can't be bothered by caring for a lot of stupid Skeezers.  Stay where you are, or go wherever you please, so long as you keep away  from our mountain.\" He turned to his men and added: \"We have conquered  Queen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9612"],[0,"The Botanic Garden (#10)"],[1,"one of them becomes green, and the other  red; but what is more wonderful, they again lose these colours, (unless  the heat has been too great,) on their being again withdrawn from the  fire.

[_On ice-built isles_. l. 529. There are many reasons to believe from  the accounts of travellers and navigators, that the islands of ice in  the higher northern latitudes as well as the Glaciers on the Alps  continue perpetually to increase in bulk. At certain times in the ice-  mountains of Switzerland there happen cracks which have shewn the great  thickness of the ice, as some of these cracks have measured three or  four hundred ells deep. The great islands of ice in the northern seas  near Hudson's bay have been observed to have been immersed above one  hundred fathoms beneath the surface of the sea, and to have risen a  fifth or sixth part above the surface, and to have measured between  three and four miles in circumference. Phil. Trans. No. 465. Sect. 2.    Dr. Lister endeavoured to shew that the ice of sea-water contains some  salt and perhaps less air than common ice, and that it is therefore much  more difficult of solution; whence he accounts for the perpetual and  great increase of these floating islands of ice. Philos. Trans. No. 169.    As by a famous experiment of Mr. Boyles it appears that ice evaporates  very fast in severe frosty weather when the wind blows upon it; and as  ice in a thawing state is known to contain six times more cold than  water at the same degree of sensible coldness, it is easy to understand  that winds blowing over islands and continents of ice perhaps much below  nothing on Farenheit's scale, and coming from thence into our latitude  must bring great degrees of cold along with them. If we add to this the  quantity of cold produced by the evaporation of the water as well as by  the solution of the ice, we cannot doubt but that the northern ice is  the principle source of the coldness of our winters, and that it is  brought hither by the regions of air blowing from the north, and which  take an apparent easterly direction by their coming to a part of the  surface of the earth which moves faster than the latitude they come  from. Hence the increase of the ice in the polar regions by increasing  the cold of our climate adds at the same time to the bulk of the  Glaciers of Italy and Switzerland.    If the nations who inhabit this hemisphere of the globe, instead of  destroying their sea-men and exhausting their wealth in unnecessary  wars, could be induced to unite their labours to navigate these immense  masses of ice into the more southern oceans, two great advantages would  result to mankind, the tropic countries would be much cooled by their  solution, and our winters in this latitude would be rendered much milder  for perhaps a century or two, till the masses of ice became again  enormous.    Mr. Bradley describes the cold winds and wet weather which sometimes  happen in May and June to the solution of ice-islands accidentally  floating from the north. Treatise on Husbandry and Gardening, Vol. II.  p. 437. And adds, that Mr. Barham about the year 1718, in his voyage  from Jamaica to England in the beginning of June, met with ice-islands  coming from the north, which were surrounded with so great a fog that  the ship was in danger of striking upon them, and that one of them  measured fifty miles in length.    We have lately experienced an instance of ice-islands brought from the  Southern polar regions, on which the Guardian struck at the beginning of  her passage from the Cape of Good Hope towards Botany Bay, on December  22, 1789. These islands were involved in mist, were about one hundred  and fifty fathoms long, and about fifty fathoms above the surface of the  water. A part from the top of one of them broke off and fell into the  sea, causing an extraordinary commotion in the water and a thick smoke  all round it.]    [_Threefold train_. l. 539.

When the sun is in the Southern tropic  36 deg. distant from the zenith, the thermometer is seldom lower than 72  deg. at Gondar in Abyssinia, but it falls to 60 or 53 deg. when the sun  is immediately vertical; so much does the approach of rain counteract  the heat of the sun.

[_Ten thousand points erect_. l. 553. The solution of water in air or in  calorique, seems to acquire electric matter at the same time, as appears  from an experiment of Mr. Bennet. He put some live coals into an  insulated funnel of metal, and throwing on them a little water observed  that the ascending steam was electrised plus, and the water which  descended through the funnel was electrised minus. Hence it appears that  though clouds by their change of form may sometimes become electrised  minus yet they have in general an accumulation of electricity. This  accumulation of electric matter also evidently contributes to support  the atmospheric vapour when it is condensed into the form of clouds,  because it is seen to descend rapidly after the flashes of lightning  have diminished its quantity; whence there is reason to conclude that  very numerous metallic rods with fine points erected high in the air  might induce it at any time to part with some of its water.
