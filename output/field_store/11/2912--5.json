The bearer of this  letter was George Washington, a young Virginia surveyor.    [Sidenote: George Washington. Scudder's _Washington; Hero Tales_ 1-15.]    [Sidenote: He warns the French to leave the Ohio.]    97. George Washington.--Of an old Virginia family, George  Washington grew up with the idea that he must earn his own living. His  father was a well-to-do planter. But Augustine Washington was the eldest  son, and, as was the custom then in Virginia, he inherited most of the  property. Augustine Washington was very kind to his younger brother, and  gave him a good practical education as a land surveyor. The younger man  was a bold athlete and fond of studying military campaigns. He was full  of courage, industrious, honest, and of great common sense. Before he  was twenty he had surveyed large tracts of wilderness, and had done his  work well amidst great difficulties. When Dinwiddie wanted a messenger  to take his letter to the French commander on the Ohio, George  Washington's employer at once suggested him as the best person to send  on the dangerous journey.    [Sidenote: The French build Fort Duquesne.]    [Sidenote: Washington's first military expedition, 1754.]    98. Fort Duquesne.--Instead of heeding Dinwiddie's warning, the  French set to work to build Fort Duquesne (Due-kan') at the spot where  the Alleghany and Monongahela join to form the Ohio,--on the site of  the present city of Pittsburg. Dinwiddie therefore sent Washington with  a small force of soldiers to drive them away. But the French were too  strong for Washington. They besieged him in Fort Necessity and compelled  him to surrender (July 4, 1754).    [Illustration: BRADDOCK'S CAMPAIGN.]    [Sidenote: Braddock's expedition, 1755. _Higginson_, 152-154;  _Eggleston_, 129-131; _Source-book_, 103-105.]    99. Braddock's Defeat, 1755.--The English government now sent  General Braddock with a small army of regular soldiers to Virginia.  Slowly and painfully Braddock marched westward. Learning of his  approach, the French and Indians left Fort Duquesne to draw him into  ambush. But the two forces came together before either party was  prepared for battle. For some time the contest was even, then the  regulars broke and fled. Braddock was fatally wounded. With great skill,  Washington saved the survivors,--but not until four shots had pierced  his coat and only thirty of his three companies of Virginians were  left alive.    [Sidenote: The French and Indian War.]    [Sidenote: William Pitt, war minister, 1757.]    100. The War to 1759.--All the earlier French and Indian wars had  begun in Europe and had spread to America. This war began in America and  soon spread to Europe. At first affairs went very ill. But in 1757  William Pitt became the British war minister, and the war began to be  waged with vigor and success. The old generals were called home, and new  men placed in command. In 1758 Amherst and Wolfe captured Louisburg, and  Forbes, greatly aided by Washington, seized Fort Duquesne. Bradstreet  captured Fort Frontenac, on Lake Ontario. There was only one bad  failure, that of Abercrombie at Ticonderoga. But the next year Amherst  captured Ticonderoga and Crown Point and opened the way to Canada by  Lake Champlain.    [Illustration: WOLFE'S RAVINE. This shows the gradual ascent of the path  from the river to the top of the bluff.]    [Sidenote: Capture of Quebec, 1759. _Higginson_, 154-156; _Eggleston_,  137-139; _Source-Book_, 105-107.]    [Sidenote: Battle of Quebec.]    101. Capture of Quebec, 1759.--Of all the younger generals James  Wolfe was foremost. To him was given the task of capturing Quebec.  Seated on a high bluff, Quebec could not be captured from the river. The  only way to approach it was to gain the Plains of Abraham in its rear  and besiege it on the land side. Again and again Wolfe sent his men to  storm the bluffs below the town. Every time they failed. Wolfe felt that  he must give up the task, when he was told that a path led from the  river to the top of the bluff above the town. Putting his men into  boats, they gained the path in the darkness of night. There was a guard  at the top of the bluff, but the officer in command was a coward and ran  away. In the morning the British army was drawn up on the Plains of  Abraham. The French now attacked the British, and a fierce battle took  place. The result was doubtful when Wolfe led a charge at the head of  the Louisburg Grenadiers. He was killed, but the French were beaten.  Five days later Quebec surrendered. Montreal was captured in 1760, and  in 1763 the war came to an end.    [Sidenote: Peace of Paris, 1763.]    102. Peace of Paris, 1763.--By this great treaty, or set of  treaties, the French withdrew from the continent of North America. To  Spain, who had lost Florida, the French gave the island of New Orleans  and all of Louisiana west of the Mississippi. To Great Britain the  French gave up all the rest of their American possessions except two  small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Spain, on her part, gave up  Florida to the British. There were now practically only two powers in  America,--the British in the eastern part of the continent, and the  Spaniards west of the Mississippi. The Spaniards also owned the island  of New Orleans and controlled both sides of the river for more than a  hundred miles from its mouth. But the treaty gave the British the free  navigation of the Mississippi throughout its length.      QUESTIONS AND TOPICS      CHAPTER 8    Sec.Sec. 65, 66.--_a_.

SUGGESTIONS TO THE TEACHER    In this period the growing difficulties between England and the colonies  can be traced--especially in commercial affairs and in governmental  institutions. Thus many of the causes of the Revolution may be brought  out as well as the difficulties in the way of colonial union. This may  be emphasized by noting the difference between the English and  French colonies.

You will, perhaps, be urged to remain, but, having  once risen, it is always best to go. There is always a certain air  of _gaucherie_ in resuming your seat and repeating the ceremony of  leave-taking.    If you have occasion to look at your watch during a call, ask  permission to do so, and apologise for it on the plea of other  appointments.           *       *       *       *       *    IV.--CONVERSATION.      Let your conversation be adapted as skilfully as may be to your  company. Some men make a point of talking commonplaces to all ladies  alike, as if a woman could only be a trifler. Others, on the contrary,  seem to forget in what respects the education of a lady differs from  that of a gentleman, and commit the opposite error of conversing on  topics with which ladies are seldom acquainted. A woman of sense  has as much right to be annoyed by the one, as a lady of ordinary  education by the other. You cannot pay a finer compliment to a woman  of refinement and _esprit_ than by leading the conversation into such  a channel as may mark your appreciation of her superior attainments.    In talking with ladies of ordinary education, avoid political,  scientific, or commercial topics, and choose only such subjects as are  likely to be of interest to them.    Remember that people take more interest in their own affairs than in  anything else which you can name. If you wish your conversation to be  thoroughly agreeable, lead a mother to talk of her children, a young  lady of her last ball, an author of his forthcoming book, or an artist  of his exhibition picture. Having furnished the topic, you need  only listen; and you are sure to be thought not only agreeable, but  thoroughly sensible and well-informed.    Be careful, however, on the other hand, not always to make a point of  talking to persons upon general matters relating to their professions.  To show an interest in their immediate concerns is flattering; but  to converse with them too much about their own arts looks as if you  thought them ignorant of other topics.    Do not use a classical quotation in the presence of ladies without  apologising for, or translating it. Even this should only be done when  no other phrase would so aptly express your meaning. Whether in the  presence of ladies or gentlemen, much display of learning is pedantic  and out of place.    There is a certain distinct but subdued tone of voice which is  peculiar to only well-bred persons. A loud voice is both disagreeable  and vulgar. It is better to err by the use of too low than too loud a  tone.    Remember that all \"slang\" is vulgar. It has become of late  unfortunately prevalent, and we have known even ladies pride  themselves on the saucy _chique_ with which they adopt certain  Americanisms, and other cant phrases of the day.    Such habits cannot be too severely reprehended. They lower the tone of  society and the standard of thought. It is a great mistake to suppose  that slang is in any way a substitute for wit.    The use of proverbs is equally vulgar in conversation; and puns,  unless they rise to the rank of witticisms, are to be scrupulously  avoided. There is no greater nuisance in society than a dull and  persevering punster.    Long arguments in general company, however entertaining to the  disputants, are tiresome to the last degree to all others. You should  always endeavour to prevent the conversation from dwelling too long  upon one topic.    Religion is a topic which should never be introduced in society. It is  the one subject on which persons are most likely to differ, and least  able to preserve temper.    Never interrupt a person who is speaking. It has been aptly said that  \"if you interrupt a speaker in the middle of his sentence, you act  almost as rudely as if, when walking with a companion, you were to  thrust yourself before him, and stop his progress.\"    To listen well, is almost as great an art as to talk well. It is not  enough _only_ to listen. You must endeavour to seem interested in the  conversation of others.    It is considered extremely ill-bred when two persons whisper in  society, or converse in a language with which all present are not  familiar. If you have private matters to discuss, you should appoint  a proper time and place to do so, without paying others the ill  compliment of excluding them from your conversation.    If a foreigner be one of the guests at a small party, and does not  understand English sufficiently to follow what is said, good-breeding  demands that conversation shall be carried on in his own language. If  at a dinner-party, the same rule applies to those at his end of the  table.    If upon the entrance of a visitor you carry on the thread of a  previous conversation, you should briefly recapitulate to him what has  been said before he arrived.    Do not be _always_ witty, even though you should be so happily gifted  as to need the caution. To outshine others on every occasion is the  surest road to unpopularity.    Always look, but never stare, at those with whom you converse.    In order to meet the general needs of conversation in society, it is  necessary that a man should be well acquainted with the current news  and historical events of at least the last few years.    Never talk upon subjects of which you know nothing, unless it be for  the purpose of acquiring information. Many young men imagine that  because they frequent exhibitions and operas they are qualified judges  of art. No mistake is more egregious or universal.    Those who introduce anecdotes into their conversation are warned  that these should invariably be \"short, witty, eloquent, new, and not  far-fetched.\"    Scandal is the least excusable of all conversational vulgarities.    In conversing with a man of rank, do not too frequently give him his  title. Only a servant interlards every sentence with \"my Lord,\" or \"my  Lady.\" It is, however, well to show that you remember his station by  now and then introducing some such phrase as--\"I think I have already  mentioned to your Lordship\"--or, \"I believe your Grace was observing\"... In  general, however, you should address a nobleman as you would any other  gentleman. The Prince of Wales himself is only addressed as \"Sir,\" in  conversation, and the Queen as \"Madam.\"           *       *       *       *       *    V.--NOTES OF INVITATION, &c.      Notes of invitation and acceptance are written in the third person  and the simplest style. The old-fashioned preliminary of \"presenting  compliments\" is discontinued by the most elegant letter-writers.    All notes of invitation are now issued in the name of the mistress of  the house only, as follows;--    \"Mrs. Norman requests the honour of Sir George and Lady Thurlow's  company at an evening party, on Monday, 14th of June.\"    Others prefer the subjoined form, which is purchaseable ready printed  upon either cards or note-paper, with blanks for names or dates:--                         \"Mrs. Norman,                         \"At home,              \"Monday evening, June 14th inst.\"    An \"At home\" is, however, considered somewhat less stately than  an evening party, and partakes more of the character of a  _conversazione_.    The reply to a note of invitation should be couched as follows:--    \"Mr. Berkeley has much pleasure in accepting Mrs. Norman's polite  invitation for Monday evening, June the 14th inst.\"    Never \"avail\" yourself of an invitation. Above all, never speak or  write of an invitation as \"an invite.\" It is neither good breeding nor  good English.    Notes of invitation and reply should be written on small paper of the  best quality, and enclosed in envelopes to correspond.    A gentleman should never use sealing-wax of any colour but red, nor  paper of any hue but white. Fancy papers, fantastic borders, dainty  coloured wax, and the like elegant follies, are only admissible in the  desk of a lady.    Never omit the address and date from any letter, whether of business,  friendship, or ceremony.    Letters in the first person, addressed to strangers, should begin with  \"Sir,\" or \"Madam,\" and end with \"I have the honour to be your very  obedient servant.\" Some object to this form of words from a mistaken  sense of pride; but it is merely a form, and, rightly apprehended,  evinces a \"proud humility,\" which implies more condescension than a  less formal phrase.    At the end of your letter, at some little distance below your  signature, and in the left corner of your paper, write the name of the  person to whom your letter is addressed; as \"Sir James Dalhousie,\" or  \"Edward Munroe, Esquire.\"    It is more polite to write Esquire at full length than to curtail it  to Esq.    In writing to persons much your superior or inferior, use as few words  as possible. In the former case, to take up much of a great man's  time is to take a liberty; in the latter to be diffuse is to be too  familiar. It is only in familiar correspondence that long letters are  permissible.    In writing to a tradesman, begin your letter by addressing him by  name, as--    \"Mr. Jones,--Sir.\"    A letter thus begun may, with propriety, be ended with--    \"Sir, yours truly.\"    Letters to persons whom you meet frequently in society, without having  arrived at intimacy, may commence with \"Dear Sir,\" and end with \"I am,  dear Sir, yours very truly.\"    Letters commencing \"My dear Sir,\" addressed to persons whom you  appreciate, and with whom you are on friendly terms, may end with \"I  am, my dear Sir, yours very faithfully,\" or \"yours very sincerely.\"    To be prompt in replying to a letter is to be polite.           *       *       *       *       *    VI.--THE PROMENADE.      A well-bred man must entertain no respect for the brim of his hat. \"A  bow,\" says La Fontaine, \"is a note drawn at sight.\" You are bound  to acknowledge it immediately, and to the full amount.
