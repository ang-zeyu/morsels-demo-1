To help unhappy commoners, and add to their enjoyment,         Affords a man of noble rank congenial employment;         Of our attempts we offer you examples illustrative:         The work is light, and, I may add, it's most remunerative.                           DUETDUKE and DUCHESS.      DUKE.          Small titles and orders                   For Mayors and Recorders                        I getand they're highly delighted      DUCH.               They're highly delighted!      DUKE.          M.P.'s baronetted,                   Sham Colonels gazetted,                        And second-rate Aldermen knighted      DUCH.               Yes, Aldermen knighted.      DUKE.          Foundation-stone laying                   I find very paying:                        It adds a large sum to my makings      DUCH.               Large sums to his makings.      DUKE.          At charity dinners                   The best of speech-spinners,                        I get ten per cent on the takings      DUCH.               One-tenth of the takings.      DUCH.          I present any lady                   Whose conduct is shady                        Or smacking of doubtful propriety      DUKE.          Doubtful propriety.      DUCH.          When Virtue would quash her,                   I take and whitewash her,                        And launch her in first-rate society      DUKE.               First-rate society!      DUCH.          I recommend acres                   Of clumsy dressmakers                        Their fit and their finishing touches      DUKE.               Their finishing touches.      DUCH.          A sum in addition                   They pay for permission                        To say that they make for the Duchess      DUKE.               They make for the Duchess!      DUKE.          Those pressing prevailers,                   The ready-made tailors,                        Quote me as their great double-barrel      DUCH.               Their great double-barrel      DUKE.          I allow them to do so,                   Though Robinson Crusoe                        Would jib at their wearing apparel      DUCH.               Such wearing apparel!      DUKE.          I sit, by selection,                   Upon the direction                        Of several Companies bubble      DUCH.               All Companies bubble!      DUKE.          As soon as they're floated                   I'm freely bank-noted                        I'm pretty well paid for my trouble      DUCH.               He's paid for his trouble!      DUCH.          At middle-class party                   I play at ecarte                        And I'm by no means a beginner      DUKE (significantly).    She's not a beginner.      DUCH.          To one of my station                   The remuneration                        Five guineas a night and my dinner      DUKE.               And wine with her dinner.      DUCH.          I write letters blatant                   On medicines patent                        And use any other you mustn't      DUKE.               Believe me, you mustn't      DUCH.          And vow my complexion                   Derives its perfection                        From somebody's soapwhich it doesn't      DUKE. (significantly).   It certainly doesn't!      DUKE.          We're ready as witness                   To any one's fitness                        To fill any place or preferment      DUCH.          A place or preferment.      DUCH.          We're often in waiting                   At junket or feting,                        And sometimes attend an interment      DUKE.          We enjoy an interment.      BOTH.          In short, if you'd kindle                   The spark of a swindle,                        Lure simpletons into your clutches                             Yes; into your clutches.                   Or hoodwink a debtor,                   You cannot do better      DUCH.               Than trot out a Duke or a Duchess      DUKE.                    A Duke or a Duchess!      (Enter Marco and Giuseppe.)           DUKE.  Ah!  Their Majesties.  Your Majesty!  (Bows with    great ceremony.)         MAR.  The Duke of Plaza-Toro, I believe?         DUKE.  The same.  (Marco and Giuseppe offer to shake hands    with him.  The Duke bows ceremoniously.  They endeavour to    imitate him.)  Allow me to present         GIU.  The young lady one of us married?      (Marco and Giuseppe offer to shake hands with her.  Casilda    curtsies formally.  They endeavour to imitate her.)           CAS.  Gentlemen, I am the most obedient servant of one of    you.  (Aside.)  Oh, Luiz!         DUKE.  I am now about to address myself to the gentleman    whom my daughter married; the other may allow his attention to    wander if he likes, for what I am about to say does not concern    him.  Sir, you will find in this young lady a combination of    excellences which you would search for in vain in any young lady    who had not the good fortune to be my daughter.  There is some    little doubt as to which of you is the gentleman I am addressing,    and which is the gentleman who is allowing his attention to    wander; but when that doubt is solved, I shall say (still    addressing the attentive gentleman), \"Take her, and may she make    you happier than her mother has made me.\"         DUCH.  Sir!         DUKE.  If possible.  And now there is a little matter to    which I think I am entitled to take exception.  I come here in    state with Her Grace the Duchess and Her Majesty my daughter, and    what do I find?  Do I find, for instance, a guard of honour to    receive me?  No!         MAR. and GIU.  No.         DUKE.  The town illuminated?  No!         MAR. and GIU.  No.         DUKE.  Refreshment provided?  No!         MAR. and GIU.  No.         DUKE.  A Royal salute fired?  No!         MAR. and GIU.  No.         DUKE.  Triumphal arches erected?  No!         MAR. and GIU.  No.         DUKE.  The bells set ringing?         MAR. and GIU.  No.         DUKE.  Yesonethe Visitors', and I rang it myself.  It is    not enough!  It is not enough!         GIU.  Upon my honour, I'm very sorry; but you see, I was    brought up in a gondola, and my ideas of politeness are confined    to taking off my cap to my passengers when they tip me.         DUCH.  That's all very well in its way, but it is not    enough.         GIU.  I'll take off anything else in reason.         DUKE.  But a Royal Salute to my daughterit costs so    little.         CAS.  Papa, I don't want a salute.         GIU.  My dear sir, as soon as we know which of us is    entitled to take that liberty she shall have as many salutes as    she likes.         MAR.  As for guards of honour and triumphal arches, you    don't know our peoplethey wouldn't stand it.         GIU.  They are very off-hand with usvery off-hand indeed.         DUKE.  Oh, but you mustn't allow thatyou must keep them in    proper discipline, you must impress your Court with your    importance.  You want deportmentcarriage         GIU.  We've got a carriage.         DUKE.  Mannerdignity.  There must be a good deal of this    sort of thing(business)and a little of this sort of    thing(business)and possibly just a Soupcon of this sort of    thing!(business)and so on.  Oh, it's very useful, and most    effective.  Just attend to me.  You are a KingI am a subject.    Very good                               (Gavotte.)                  DUKE, DUCHESS, CASILDA, MARCO, GIUSEPPE.      DUKE.          I am a courtier grave and serious                        Who is about to kiss your hand:                   Try to combine a pose imperious                        With a demeanour nobly bland.      MAR. and       Let us combine a pose imperious    GIU.                With a demeanour nobly bland.      (Marco and Giuseppe endeavour to carry out his instructions.)      DUKE.          That's, if anything, too unbending                        Too aggressively stiff and grand;      (They suddenly modify their attitudes.)                     Now to the other extreme you're tending                   Don't be so deucedly condescending!      DUCH. and      Now to the other extreme you're tending    CAS.           Don't be so dreadfully condescending!      MAR. and       Oh, hard to please some noblemen seem!    GIU.                At first, if anything, too unbending;                   Off we go to the other extreme                        Too confoundedly condescending!      DUKE.          Now a gavotte perform sedately                        Offer your hand with conscious pride;                   Take an attitude not too stately,                        Still sufficiently dignified.      MAR. and       Now for an attitude not too stately,    GIU.                Still sufficiently dignified.      (They endeavour to carry out his instructions.)      DUKE (beating  Oncely, twicelyoncely, twicely    time).              Bow impressively ere you glide.                                                                (They    do so.)                                       Capital both, capital    bothyou've caught it nicely!                        That is the style of thing precisely!      DUCH. and                Capital both, capital boththey've    caught it nicely!    CAS.                That is the style of thing precisely!      MAR. and       Oh, sweet to earn a nobleman's praise!    GIU.                Capital both, capital bothwe've caught it    nicely!                   Supposing he's right in what he says,                                              This is the style of    thing precisely!      (Gavotte.  At the end exeunt Duke and Duchess, leaving Casilda    with Marco and Giuseppe.)           GIU. (to Marco).  The old birds have gone away and left the    young chickens together.  That's called tact.         MAR.  It's very awkward.
