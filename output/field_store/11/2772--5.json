Thus these appliances of art supply a protection, perhaps our chief  protection, against a recrudescence of these superstitious beliefs,  those fanciful myths and infertile imaginings about nature in which so  much of the best intellectual power of the past has been spent. If we  add one other factor, namely, that such appliances be not only used,  but used in the interests of a truly shared or associated life, then  the appliances become the positive resources of civilization. If Greece,  with a scant tithe of our material resources, achieved a worthy and  noble intellectual and artistic career, it is because Greece operated  for social ends such resources as it had. But whatever the situation,  whether one of barbarism or civilization, whether one of stinted control  of physical forces, or of partial enslavement to a mechanism not yet  made tributary to a shared experience, things as they enter into action  furnish the educative conditions of daily life and direct the formation  of mental and moral disposition.    Intentional education signifies, as we have already seen, a specially  selected environment, the selection being made on the basis of materials  and method specifically promoting growth in the desired direction. Since  language represents the physical conditions that have been subjected  to the maximum transformation in the interests of social life--physical  things which have lost their original quality in becoming social  tools--it is appropriate that language should play a large part compared  with other appliances. By it we are led to share vicariously in past  human experience, thus widening and enriching the experience of the  present. We are enabled, symbolically and imaginatively, to anticipate  situations. In countless ways, language condenses meanings that record  social outcomes and presage social outlooks. So significant is it of  a liberal share in what is worth while in life that unlettered and  uneducated have become almost synonymous.    The emphasis in school upon this particular tool has, however, its  dangers--dangers which are not theoretical but exhibited in practice.  Why is it, in spite of the fact that teaching by pouring in, learning by  a passive absorption, are universally condemned, that they are still so  entrenched in practice? That education is not an affair of \"telling\"  and being told, but an active and constructive process, is a principle  almost as generally violated in practice as conceded in theory. Is not  this deplorable situation due to the fact that the doctrine is itself  merely told? It is preached; it is lectured; it is written about. But  its enactment into practice requires that the school environment be  equipped with agencies for doing, with tools and physical materials, to  an extent rarely attained. It requires that methods of instruction and  administration be modified to allow and to secure direct and continuous  occupations with things. Not that the use of language as an educational  resource should lessen; but that its use should be more vital and  fruitful by having its normal connection with shared activities. \"These  things ought ye to have done, and not to have left the others  undone.\" And for the school \"these things\" mean equipment with the  instrumentalities of cooperative or joint activity.    For when the schools depart from the educational conditions effective in  the out-of-school environment, they necessarily substitute a bookish, a  pseudo-intellectual spirit for a social spirit. Children doubtless go to  school to learn, but it has yet to be proved that learning occurs most  adequately when it is made a separate conscious business. When treating  it as a business of this sort tends to preclude the social sense which  comes from sharing in an activity of common concern and value, the  effort at isolated intellectual learning contradicts its own aim. We may  secure motor activity and sensory excitation by keeping an individual by  himself, but we cannot thereby get him to understand the meaning which  things have in the life of which he is a part. We may secure technical  specialized ability in algebra, Latin, or botany, but not the kind of  intelligence which directs ability to useful ends. Only by engaging in  a joint activity, where one person's use of material and tools is  consciously referred to the use other persons are making of their  capacities and appliances, is a social direction of disposition  attained.    Summary. The natural or native impulses of the young do not agree with  the life-customs of the group into which they are born. Consequently  they have to be directed or guided. This control is not the same thing  as physical compulsion; it consists in centering the impulses acting  at any one time upon some specific end and in introducing an order of  continuity into the sequence of acts. The action of others is always  influenced by deciding what stimuli shall call out their actions. But  in some cases as in commands, prohibitions, approvals, and disapprovals,  the stimuli proceed from persons with a direct view to influencing  action. Since in such cases we are most conscious of controlling the  action of others, we are likely to exaggerate the importance of this  sort of control at the expense of a more permanent and effective method.  The basic control resides in the nature of the situations in which the  young take part. In social situations the young have to refer their  way of acting to what others are doing and make it fit in. This directs  their action to a common result, and gives an understanding common to  the participants. For all mean the same thing, even when performing  different acts. This common understanding of the means and ends of  action is the essence of social control. It is indirect, or emotional  and intellectual, not direct or personal. Moreover it is intrinsic to  the disposition of the person, not external and coercive. To achieve  this internal control through identity of interest and understanding  is the business of education. While books and conversation can do much,  these agencies are usually relied upon too exclusively. Schools require  for their full efficiency more opportunity for conjoint activities in  which those instructed take part, so that they may acquire a social  sense of their own powers and of the materials and appliances used.          Chapter Four: Education as Growth    1. The Conditions of Growth.    In directing the activities of the young, society determines its own  future in determining that of the young. Since the young at a given time  will at some later date compose the society of that period, the latter's  nature will largely turn upon the direction children's activities were  given at an earlier period. This cumulative movement of action toward a  later result is what is meant by growth.    The primary condition of growth is immaturity. This may seem to be a  mere truism--saying that a being can develop only in some point in which  he is undeveloped. But the prefix \"im\" of the word immaturity means  something positive, not a mere void or lack. It is noteworthy that the  terms \"capacity\" and \"potentiality\" have a double meaning, one  sense being negative, the other positive. Capacity may denote mere  receptivity, like the capacity of a quart measure. We may mean by  potentiality a merely dormant or quiescent state--a capacity to become  something different under external influences. But we also mean by  capacity an ability, a power; and by potentiality potency, force. Now  when we say that immaturity means the possibility of growth, we are  not referring to absence of powers which may exist at a later time; we  express a force positively present--the ability to develop.    Our tendency to take immaturity as mere lack, and growth as something  which fills up the gap between the immature and the mature is due to  regarding childhood comparatively, instead of intrinsically. We treat  it simply as a privation because we are measuring it by adulthood as a  fixed standard. This fixes attention upon what the child has not, and  will not have till he becomes a man. This comparative standpoint is  legitimate enough for some purposes, but if we make it final, the  question arises whether we are not guilty of an overweening presumption.  Children, if they could express themselves articulately and sincerely,  would tell a different tale; and there is excellent adult authority for  the conviction that for certain moral and intellectual purposes adults  must become as little children. The seriousness of the assumption of the  negative quality of the possibilities of immaturity is apparent when  we reflect that it sets up as an ideal and standard a static end. The  fulfillment of growing is taken to mean an accomplished growth: that is  to say, an Ungrowth, something which is no longer growing. The futility  of the assumption is seen in the fact that every adult resents the  imputation of having no further possibilities of growth; and so far  as he finds that they are closed to him mourns the fact as evidence of  loss, instead of falling back on the achieved as adequate manifestation  of power. Why an unequal measure for child and man?    Taken absolutely, instead of comparatively, immaturity designates a  positive force or ability,--the pouter to grow. We do not have to draw  out or educe positive activities from a child, as some educational  doctrines would have it. Where there is life, there are already eager  and impassioned activities. Growth is not something done to them; it is  something they do. The positive and constructive aspect of possibility  gives the key to understanding the two chief traits of immaturity,  dependence and plasticity.

With a smile of bitter amusement, she tucked her skirts tightly around her,  crept through the fence, and filled a chipped granite cup which stood upon  a rock ledge, and drank slowly. Then she laughed aloud.    \"The water really _is_ cold,\" she said. \"Anywhere else it would be  delicious. And that's a spring, I suppose.\" Mercilessly she was stripping  her mind of her illusions, and was clothing it in the harsher weave of  reality. \"All these hills are Manley's--our ranch.\" She took another sip  and set down the cup. \"And so Cold Spring Ranch means--all this.\"    Down the coulee she heard Manley call. She stood still, pushing back a  fallen lock of fine, yellow hair. She turned toward the sound, and the sun  in her eyes turned them yellow as the hair above them. She was beautiful,  in an odd, white-and-gold way. If her eyes had been blue, or gray--or even  brown--she would have been merely pretty; but as they were, that amber tint  where one looked for something else struck one unexpectedly and made her  whole face unforgettably lovely. However, the color of her eyes and her  hair did not interest her then, or make life any easier. She was quite  ordinarily miserable and homesick, as she went reluctantly back along the  grassy trails The odor of fried bacon came up to her, and she hated bacon.  She hated everything.    \"I've been to the spring,\" she called out, resolutely cheerful, as soon as  she came in sight of Manley, waiting in the kitchen door; she ran toward  him lightly. \"However does the water keep so deliciously cool through this  hot weather? I don't wonder you call this Cold Spring Ranch.\"    Manley straightened proudly. \"I'm glad you like it; I was afraid you might  not, just at first. But you're the right stuff--I might have known it. Not  every woman could come out here and appreciate this country right at the  start.\"    Val stopped at the steps, panting a little from her run, and smiled  unflinchingly up into his face.          CHAPTER VI. MANLEY'S FIRE GUARD    Hot sunlight, winds as hot, a shimmering heat which distorted objects at a  distance and made the sky line a dazzling, wavering ribbon of faded blue;  and then the dull haze of smoke which hung over the land, and, without  tempering the heat, turned the sun into a huge coppery balloon, which  drifted imperceptibly from the east to the west, and at evening time  settled softly down upon a parched hilltop and disappeared, leaving behind  it an ominous red glow as of hidden fires.    When the wind blew, the touch of it seared the face, as the smoke tang  assailed the nostrils. All the world was a weird, unnatural tint, hard to  name, never to be forgotten. The far horizons drew steadily closer as the  days passed slowly and thickened the veil of smoke. The distant mountains  drew daily back into dimmer distance; became an obscure, formless blot  against the sky, and vanished completely. The horizon crouched then upon  the bluffs across the river, moved up to the line of trees along its banks,  blotted them out one day, and impudently established itself half-way up the  coulee.    Time ceased to be measured accurately; events moved slowly in an unreal  world of sultry heat and smoke and a red sun wading heavily through the  copper-brown sky from the east to the west, and a moon as red which  followed meekly after.    Men rode uneasily here and there, and when they met they talked of prairie  fires and of fire guards and the direction of the wind, and of the faint  prospect of rain. Cattle, driven from their accustomed feeding grounds,  wandered aimlessly over the still-unburned range, and lowed often in the  night as they drifted before the flame-heated wind.    Fifteen miles to the east of Cold Spring Coulee, the Wishbone outfit  watched uneasily the deepening haze. Kent and Bob Royden were put to riding  the range from the river north and west, and Polycarp Jenks, who had taken  a claim where were good water and some shelter, and who never seemed to  be there for more than a few hours at a time, because of his boundless  curiosity, wandered about on his great, raw-boned sorrel with the white  legs, and seemed always to have the latest fire news on the tip of his  tongue, and always eager to impart it to somebody.    To the northwest there was the Double Diamond, also sleeping with both eyes  open, so to speak. They also had two men out watching the range, though  the fires were said to be all across the river. But there was the railroad  seaming the country straight through the grassland, and though the company  was prompt at plowing fire guards, contract work would always bear  watching, said the stockmen, and with the high winds that prevailed there  was no telling what might happen.    So Fred De Garmo and Bill Madison patrolled the country in rather desultory  fashion, if the truth be known. They liked best to ride to the north and  east--which, while following faithfully the railroad and the danger line,  would bring them eventually to Hope, where they never failed to stop as  long as they dared. For, although they never analyzed their feelings, they  knew that as long as they kept their jobs and their pay was forthcoming, a  few miles of blackened range concerned them personally not at all.  Still, barring a fondness for the trail which led to town, they were not  unfaithful to their trust.    One day Kent and Polycarp met on the brink of a deep coulee, and, as is the  way of men who ride the dim trails, they stopped to talk a bit.    Polycarp, cracking his face across the middle with his habitual grin,  straightened his right leg to its full length, slid his hand with  difficulty into his pocket, brought up a dirty fragment of \"plug\" tobacco,  looked it over inquiringly, and pried off the corner with his teeth. When  he had rolled it comfortably into his cheek and had straightened his leg  and replaced the tobacco in his pocket, he was \"all set\" and ready for  conversation.    Kent had taken the opportunity to roll a cigarette, though smoking on the  range was a weakness to be indulged in with much care. He pinched out the  blaze of his match, as usual, and then spat upon it for added safety before  throwing it away.    \"If this heat doesn't let up,\" he remarked, \"the grass is going to blaze up  from sunburn.\"    \"It won't need to, if you ask me. I wouldn't be su'prised to see this hull  range afire any time. Between you an' me, Kenneth, them Double Diamond  fellers ain't watching it as close as they might. I was away over Dry Creek  way yesterday, and I seen where there was two different fires got through  the company's guards, and kited off across the country. It jest _happened_  that the grass give out in that red day soil, and starved 'em both out.  They wa'n't _put_ out. I looked close all around, and there wasn't nary a  track of man or horse. That's their business--ridin' line on the railroad.  The section men's been workin' off down the other way, where a culvert got  scorched up pretty bad. By granny, Fred 'n' Bill Madison spend might' nigh  all their time ridin' the trail to town. They're might' p'ticular about  watchin' the railroad between the switches--_he-he!_\"    \"That's something for the Double Diamond to worry over,\" Kent rebuffed. He  hated that sort of gossip which must speak ill of somebody. \"Our winter  range lays mostly south and east; we could stop a fire between here and the  Double Diamond, even if they let one get past 'em.\"    Polycarp regarded him cunningly with his little, slitlike eyes. \"Mebbe you  could,\" he said doubtfully. \"And then again, mebbe you couldn't. Oncet  it got past Cold Spring--\" He shook his wizened head slowly, leaned, and  expectorated gravely.    \"Man Fleetwood's keeping tab pretty close over that way.\"    Polycarp gave a grunt that was half a chuckle. \"Man Fleetwood's keeping tab  on what runs down his gullet,\" he corrected. \"I seen him an' his wife out  burnin' guards t' other day--over on his west line--and, by granny, it  wouldn't stop nothing! A toad could jump it--_he-he!_\" He sent another  stream of tobacco juice afar, with the grave air as before.    \"And I told him so. 'Man,' I says, 'what you think you're doing?'    \"'Buildin' a fire guard,' he says. 'My wife, Mr. Jenks.'    \"'Polycarp Jenks is my cognomen,' I says. 'And I don't want no misterin'  in mine. Polycarp's good enough for me,' I says, and I took off my hat and  bowed to 'is wife. Funny kinda eyes, she's got--ever take notice? Yeller,  by granny! first time I ever seen yeller eyes in a human's face. Mebbe it  was the sun in 'em, but they sure was yeller. I dunno as they hurt her  looks none, either. Kinda queer lookin', but when you git used to 'em you  kinda like 'em.    \"'N' I says: 'Tain't half wide enough, nor a third'--spoke right up to 'im!  I was thinkin' of the hull blamed country, and I didn't care how he took  it. 'Any good, able-bodied wind'll jump a fire across that guard so quick  it won't reelize there was any there,' I says.    \"Man didn't like it none too well, either. He says to me: 'That guard'll  stop any fire I ever saw,' and I got right back at him--_he-he!_ 'Man,' I  says, 'you ain't never saw a prairie fire'--just like that. 'You wait,' I  says, 'till the real thing comes along. We ain't had any fires since you  come into the country,' I says, 'and you don't know what they're like. Now,  you take my advice and plow another four or five furrows--and plow 'em out,  seventy-five or a hundred feet from here,' I says, 'an' make sure you  git all the grass burned off between--and do it on a still day,' I says.  'You'll burn up the hull country if you keep on this here way you're  doing,' I told him--straight out, just like that. 'And when you do it,' I  says, 'you better let somebody know, so's they can come an' help,' I says.  ''Tain't any job a man oughta tackle alone,' I says to him. 'Git help, Man,  git help.'    \"Well, by granny--_he-he!_ Man's wife brustled up at me like a--a"]]]
