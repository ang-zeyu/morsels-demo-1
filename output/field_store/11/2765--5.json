Hereupon the son of  Tyndareus laid aside his mantle, closely-woven, delicately-wrought,  which one of the Lemnian maidens had given him as a pledge of  hospitality; and the king threw down his dark cloak of double fold with  its clasps and the knotted crook of mountain olive which he carried.  Then straightway they looked and chose close by a spot that pleased them  and bade their comrades sit upon the sand in two lines; nor were they  alike to behold in form or in stature. The one seemed to be a monstrous  son of baleful Typhoeus or of Earth herself, such as she brought  forth aforetime, in her wrath against Zeus; but the other, the son of  Tyndareus, was like a star of heaven, whose beams are fairest as it  shines through the nightly sky at eventide. Such was the son of Zeus,  the bloom of the first down still on his cheeks, still with the look of  gladness in his eyes. But his might and fury waxed like a wild beast's;  and he poised his hands to see if they were pliant as before and were  not altogether numbed by toil and rowing. But Amycus on his side made no  trial; but standing apart in silence he kept his eyes upon his foe, and  his spirit surged within him all eager to dash the life-blood from his  breast. And between them Lyeoreus, the henchman of Amycus, placed at  their feet on each side two pairs of gauntlets made of raw hide, dry,  exceeding tough. And the king addressed the hero with arrogant words:    (ll. 55-59) \"Whichever of these thou wilt, without casting lots, I grant  thee freely, that thou mayst not blame me hereafter. Bind them about thy  hands; thou shalt learn and tell another how skilled I am to carve the  dry oxhides and to spatter men's cheeks with blood.\"    (ll. 60-66) Thus he spake; but the other gave back no taunt in answer,  but with a light smile readily took up the gauntlets that lay at his  feet; and to him came Castor and mighty Talaus, son of Bias, and they  quickly bound the gauntlets about his hands, often bidding him be of  good courage. And to Amycus came Aretus and Ornytus, but little they  knew, poor fools, that they had bound them for the last time on their  champion, a victim of evil fate.    (ll. 67-97) Now when they stood apart and were ready with their  gauntlets, straightway in front of their faces they raised their heavy  hands and matched their might in deadly strife. Hereupon the Bebrycian  king even as a fierce wave of the sea rises in a crest against a swift  ship, but she by the skill of the crafty pilot just escapes the shock  when the billow is eager to break over the bulwark--so he followed up  the son of Tyndareus, trying to daunt him, and gave him no respite. But  the hero, ever unwounded, by his skill baffled the rush of his foe,  and he quickly noted the brutal play of his fists to see where he was  invincible in strength, and where inferior, and stood unceasingly and  returned blow for blow. And as when shipwrights with their hammers smite  ships' timbers to meet the sharp clamps, fixing layer upon layer; and  the blows resound one after another; so cheeks and jaws crashed on both  sides, and a huge clattering of teeth arose, nor did they cease ever  from striking their blows until laboured gasping overcame both. And  standing a little apart they wiped from their foreheads sweat in  abundance, wearily panting for breath. Then back they rushed together  again, as two bulls fight in furious rivalry for a grazing heifer. Next  Amycus rising on tiptoe, like one who slays an ox, sprung to his full  height and swung his heavy hand down upon his rival; but the hero  swerved aside from the rush, turning his head, and just received the arm  on his shoulder; and coming near and slipping his knee past the king's,  with a rush he struck him above the ear, and broke the bones inside, and  the king in agony fell upon his knees; and the Minyan heroes shouted for  joy; and his life was poured forth all at once.    (ll. 98-144) Nor were the Bebrycians reckless of their king; but  all together took up rough clubs and spears and rushed straight on  Polydeuces. But in front of him stood his comrades, their keen swords  drawn from the sheath. First Castor struck upon the head a man as he  rushed at him: and it was cleft in twain and fell on each side upon his  shoulders. And Polydeuces slew huge Itymoneus and Mimas. The one, with  a sudden leap, he smote beneath the breast with his swift foot and threw  him in the dust; and as the other drew near he struck him with his right  hand above the left eyebrow, and tore away his eyelid and the eyeball  was left bare. But Oreides, insolent henchman of Amycus, wounded Talaus  son of Bias in the side, but did not slay him, but only grazing the  skin the bronze sped under his belt and touched not the flesh. Likewise  Aretus with well-seasoned club smote Iphitus, the steadfast son of  Eurytus, not yet destined to an evil death; assuredly soon was he  himself to be slain by the sword of Clytius. Then Ancaeus, the dauntless  son of Lycurgus, quickly seized his huge axe, and in his left hand  holding a bear's dark hide, plunged into the midst of the Bebrycians  with furious onset; and with him charged the sons of Aeacus, and with  them started warlike Jason. And as when amid the folds grey wolves  rush down on a winter's day and scare countless sheep, unmarked by the  keen-scented dogs and the shepherds too, and they seek what first to  attack and carry off; often glaring around, but the sheep are just  huddled together and trample on one another; so the heroes grievously  scared the arrogant Bebrycians. And as shepherds or beekeepers smoke  out a huge swarm of bees in a rock, and they meanwhile, pent up in their  hive, murmur with droning hum, till, stupefied by the murky smoke, they  fly forth far from the rock; so they stayed steadfast no longer, but  scattered themselves inland through Bebrycia, proclaiming the death of  Amycus; fools, not to perceive that another woe all unforeseen was hard  upon them. For at that hour their vineyards and villages were being  ravaged by the hostile spear of Lycus and the Mariandyni, now that their  king was gone. For they were ever at strife about the ironbearing land.  And now the foe was destroying their steadings and farms, and now the  heroes from all sides were driving off their countless sheep, and one  spake among his fellows thus:    (ll. 145-153) \"Bethink ye what they would have done in their cowardice  if haply some god had brought Heracles hither. Assuredly, if he had been  here, no trial would there have been of fists, I ween, but when the king  drew near to proclaim his rules, the club would have made him forget his  pride and the rules to boot. Yea, we left him uncared for on the strand  and we sailed oversea; and full well each one of us shall know our  baneful folly, now that he is far away.\"    (ll. 154-163) Thus he spake, but all these things had been wrought by  the counsels of Zeus. Then they remained there through the night and  tended the hurts of the wounded men, and offered sacrifice to the  immortals, and made ready a mighty meal; and sleep fell upon no man  beside the bowl and the blazing sacrifice. They wreathed their fair  brows with the bay that grew by the shore, whereto their hawsers were  bound, and chanted a song to the lyre of Orpheus in sweet harmony; and  the windless shore was charmed by their song; and they celebrated the  Therapnaean son of Zeus. [1201]    (ll. 164-177) But when the sun rising from far lands lighted up the dewy  hills and wakened the shepherds, then they loosed their hawsers from  the stem of the baytree and put on board all the spoil they had need  to take; and with a favouring wind they steered through the eddying  Bosporus. Hereupon a wave like a steep mountain rose aloft in front as  though rushing upon them, ever upheaved above the clouds; nor would you  say that they could escape grim death, for in its fury it hangs over  the middle of the ship, like a cloud, yet it sinks away into calm if it  meets with a skilful helmsman. So they by the steering-craft of Tiphys  escaped, unhurt but sore dismayed. And on the next day they fastened the  hawsers to the coast opposite the Bithynian land.    (ll. 178-208) There Phineus, son of Agenor, had his home by the sea,  Phineus who above all men endured most bitter woes because of the  gift of prophecy which Leto's son had granted him aforetime. And he  reverenced not a whit even Zeus himself, for he foretold unerringly to  men his sacred will. Wherefore Zeus sent upon him a lingering old age,  and took from his eyes the pleasant light, and suffered him not to have  joy of the dainties untold that the dwellers around ever brought to his  house, when they came to enquire the will of heaven. But on a sudden,  swooping through the clouds, the Harpies with their crooked beaks  incessantly snatched the food away from his mouth and hands. And at  times not a morsel of food was left, at others but a little, in order  that he might live and be tormented. And they poured forth over all a  loathsome stench; and no one dared not merely to carry food to his mouth  but even to stand at a distance; so foully reeked the remnants of the  meal. But straightway when he heard the voice and the tramp of the band  he knew that they were the men passing by, at whose coming Zeus' oracle  had declared to him that he should have joy of his food. And he rose  from his couch, like a lifeless dream, bowed over his staff, and crept  to the door on his withered feet, feeling the walls; and as he moved,  his limbs trembled for weakness and age; and his parched skin was caked  with dirt, and naught but the skill held his bones together. And he came  forth from the hall with wearied knees and sat on the threshold of the  courtyard; and a dark stupor covered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/831"],[0,"Four Arthurian Romances (#10)"],[1,"that her face blushed all crimson. But her confusion was so  becoming to her that she looked all the more lovely. When the King saw  that she was embarrassed, he did not wish to leave her side. Taking her  gently by the hand, he made her sit down on his right hand; and on his  left sat the Queen, speaking thus to the King the while. \"Sire, in my  opinion he who can win such a fair lady by his arms in another land  ought by right to come to a royal court. It was well we waited for Erec;  for now you can bestow the kiss upon the fairest of the court. I should  think none would find fault with you! for none can say, unless he lie,  that this maiden is not the most charming of all the damsels here, or  indeed in all the world.\" The King makes answer: \"That is no lie; and  upon her, if there is no remonstrance, I shall bestow the honour of the  White Stag.\" Then he added to the knights: \"My lords, what say you? What  is your opinion? In body, in face, and in whatever a maid should have,  this one is the most charming and beautiful to be found, as I may say,  before you come to where Heaven and earth meet. I say it is meet that  she should receive the honour of the Stag. And you, my lords, what do  you think about it? Can you make any objection? If any one wishes to  protest, let him straightway speak his mind. I am King, and must keep  my word and must not permit any baseness, falsity, or arrogance. I must  maintain truth and righteousness. It is the business of a loyal king  to support the law, truth, faith, and justice. I would not in any wise  commit a disloyal deed or wrong to either weak or strong. It is not meet  that any one should complain of me; nor do I wish the custom and the  practice to lapse, which my family has been wont to foster. You, too,  would doubtless regret to see me strive to introduce other customs  and other laws than those my royal sire observed. Regardless of  consequences, I am bound to keep and maintain the institution of my  father Pendragon, who was a just king and emperor. Now tell me fully  what you think! Let none be slow to speak his mind, if this damsel is  not the fairest of my household and ought not by right to receive the  kiss of the White Stag: I wish to know what you truly think.\" Then they  all cry with one accord: \"Sire, by the Lord and his Cross! you may well  kiss her with good reason, for she is the fairest one there is. In this  damsel there is more beauty than there is of radiance in the sun. You  may kiss her freely, for we all agree in sanctioning it.\" When the King  hears that this is well pleasing to them all, he will no longer delay in  bestowing the kiss, but turns toward her and embraces her. The maid was  sensible, and perfectly willing that the King should kiss her; she would  have been discourteous, indeed, to resent it. In courteous fashion and  in the presence of all his knights the King kissed her, and said: \"My  dear. I give you my love in all honesty. I will love you with true  heart, without malice and without guile.\" By this adventure the King  carried out the practice and the usage to which the White Stag was  entitled at his court.    Here ends the first part of my story. [119]    (Vv. 1845-1914.) When the kiss of the Stag was taken according to the  custom of the country, Erec, like a polite and kind man, was solicitous  for his poor host. It was not his intention to fail to execute what he  had promised. Hear how he kept his covenant: for he sent him now five  sumpter mules, strong and sleek, loaded with dresses and clothes,  buckrams and scarlets, marks of gold and silver plate, furs both vair  and grey, skins of sable, purple stuffs, and silks. When the mules were  loaded with all that a gentleman can need, he sent with them an escort  of ten knights and sergeants chosen from his own men, and straightly  charged them to salute his host and show great honour both to him and to  his lady, as if it were to himself in person; and when they should have  presented to them the sumpters which they brought them, the gold, the  silver, and money, and all the other furnishings which were in the  boxes, they should escort the lady and the vavasor with great honour  into his kingdom of Farther Wales. [120] Two towns there he had promised  them, the most choice and the best situated that there were in all his  land, with nothing to fear from attack. Montrevel was the name of one,  and the other's name was Roadan. When they should arrive in his kingdom,  they should make over to them these two towns, together with their rents  and their jurisdiction, in accordance with what he had promised them.  All was carried out as Erec had ordered. The messengers made no delay,  and in good time they presented to his host the gold and the silver  and the sumpters and the robes and the money, of which there was great  plenty. They escorted them into Erec's kingdom, and strove to serve them  well. They came into the country on the third day, and transferred to  them the towers of the towns; for King Lac made no objection. He gave  them a warm welcome and showed them honour, loving them for the sake  of his son Erec. He made over to them the title to the towns, and  established their suzerainty by making knights and bourgeois swear that  they would reverence them as their true liege lords. When this was  done and accomplished, the messengers returned to their lord Erec, who  received them gladly. When he asked for news of the vavasor and his  lady, of his own father and of his kingdom, the report they gave him was  good and fair.    (Vv. 1915-2024.) Not long after this, the time drew near when Erec was  to celebrate his marriage. The delay was irksome to him, and he resolved  no longer to suffer and wait. So he went and asked of the King that  it might please him to allow him to be married at the court. The King  vouchsafed him the boon, and sent through all his kingdom to search for  the kings and counts who were his liege-men, bidding them that none be  so bold as not to be present at Pentecost. None dares to hold back and  not go to court at the King's summons. Now I will tell you, and listen  well, who were these counts and kings. With a rich escort and one  hundred extra mounts Count Brandes of Gloucester came. After him came  Menagormon, who was Count of Clivelon. And he of the Haute Montagne came  with a very rich following. The Count of Treverain came, too, with a  hundred of his knights, and Count Godegrain with as many more. Along  with those whom I have just mentioned came Maheloas, a great baron, lord  of the Isle of Voirre. In this island no thunder is heard, no lightning  strikes, nor tempests rage, nor do toads or serpents exist there, nor is  it ever too hot or too cold. [121] Graislemier of Fine Posterne brought  twenty companions, and had with him his brother Guigomar, lord of the  Isle of Avalon. Of the latter we have heard it said that he was a friend  of Morgan the Fay, and such he was in very truth. Davit of Tintagel  came, who never suffered woe or grief. Guergesin, the Duke of Haut Bois,  came with a very rich equipment. There was no lack of counts and dukes,  but of kings there were still more. Garras of Cork, a doughty king, was  there with five hundred knights clad in mantles, hose, and tunics of  brocade and silk. Upon a Cappadocian steed came Aguisel, the Scottish  king, and brought with him his two sons, Cadret and Coi--two much  respected knights. Along with those whom I have named came King Ban of  Gomeret, and he had in his company only young men, beardless as yet on  chin and lip. A numerous and gay band he brought two hundred of them  in his suite; and there was none, whoever he be, but had a falcon or  tercel, a merlin or a sparrow-hawk, or some precious pigeon-hawk, golden  or mewed. Kerrin, the old King of Riel, brought no youth, but rather  three hundred companions of whom the youngest was seven score years old.  Because of their great age, their heads were all as white as snow, and  their beards reached down to their girdles. Arthur held them in great  respect. The lord of the dwarfs came next, Bilis, the king of Antipodes.  This king of whom I speak was a dwarf himself and own brother of Brien.  Bilis, on the one hand, was the smallest of all the dwarfs, while his  brother Brien was a half-foot or full palm taller than any other knight  in the kingdom. To display his wealth and power, Bilis brought with him  two kings who were also dwarfs and who were vassals of his, Grigoras and  Glecidalan. Every one looked at them as marvels. When they had arrived  at court, they were treated with great esteem. All three were honoured  and served at the court like kings, for they were very perfect  gentlemen. In brief, when King Arthur saw all his lords assembled, his  heart was glad. Then, to heighten the joy, he ordered a hundred squires  to be bathed whom he wished to dub knights. There was none of them  but had a parti-coloured robe of rich brocade of Alexandria, each one  choosing such as pleased his fancy. All had arms of a uniform pattern,  and horses swift and full of mettle, of which the worst was worth a  hundred livres.    (Vv. 2025-2068.) When Erec received his wife, he must needs call her by  her right name. For a wife is not espoused unless she is called by her  proper name. As yet no one knew her name, but now for the first time it  was made known: Enide was her baptismal name. [122] The Archbishop of  Canterbury, who had come to the court, blessed them, as is his right.  When the court was all assembled, there was not a minstrel in the  countryside who possessed any pleasing accomplishment that did not come  to the court. In the great hall there was much merry-making, each one  contributing what he could to the entertainment: one jumps, another  tumbles, another does magic; there is story-telling, singing, whistling,  playing from notes; they play on the harp, the rote, the fiddle, the  violin, the flute, and pipe.
