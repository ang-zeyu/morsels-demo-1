[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13166"],[0,"The Psalms of David (#11)"],[1,"d.      Psalm 36:2. 1 2 5 6 7 9 C. M.  Practical atheism exposed; or,  The being and attributes of God asserted.    1 While men grow bold in wicked ways!  And yet a God they own,  My heart within me often says,  \"Their thoughts believe there's none.\"    2 Their thoughts and ways at once declare  (Whate'er their lips profess)  God hath no wrath for them to fear,  Nor will they seek his grace.    3 What strange self-flattery blinds their eyes!  But there's an hastening hour  When they shall see with sore surprise  The terrors of thy power.    4 Thy justice shall maintain its throne,  Tho' mountains melt away;  Thy judgments are a world unknown,  A deep unfathom'd sea.    5 Above the heavens' created rounds,  Thy mercies, Lord, extend;  Thy truth outlives the narrow bounds,  Where time and nature end.    6 Safety to man thy goodness brings,  Nor overlooks the beast;  Beneath the shadow of thy wings  Thy children choose to rest.    7 [From thee, when creature-streams run low,  And mortal comforts die,  Perpetual springs of life shall flow,  And raise our pleasures high.    8 Tho' all created light decay,  And death close up our eyes  Thy presence makes eternal day  Where clouds can never rise.]      Psalm 36:3. 1-7. S. M.  The wickedness of man, and the majesty of God;  or. Practical atheism exposed.    1 When man grows bold in sin  My heart within me cries,  \"He hath no faith of God within,  Nor fear before his eyes.\"    2 [He walks awhile conceal'd  In a self-flattering dream,  Till his dark crimes at once reveal'd  Expose his hateful name.]    3 His heart is false and foul,  His words are smooth and fair;  Wisdom is banish'd from his soul,  And leaves no goodness there.    4 He plots upon his bed  New mischiefs to fulfil;  He sets his heart, and hand, and head,  To practise all that's ill.    5 But there's a dreadful God,  Tho' men renounce his fear;  His justice hid behind the cloud  Shall one great day appear.    6 His truth transcends the sky;  In heaven his mercies dwell;  Deep as the sea his judgments lie,  His anger burns to hell.    7 How excellent his love,  Whence all our safety springs!  O never let my soul remove  From underneath his wings.      Psalm 37:1. 1-15. First Part.  The cure of envy, fretfulness, and unbelief;  or, The rewards of the righteous, and the wicked;  or, The world's hatred, and the saint's patience.    1 Why should I vex my soul and fret  To see the wicked rise?  Or envy sinners waxing great,  By violence and lies.    2 As flowery grass cut down at noon,  Before the evening fades  So shall their glories vanish soon  In everlasting shades.    3 Then let me make the Lord my trust,  And practise all that's good;  So shall I dwell among the just,  And he'll provide me food.    4 I to my God my ways commit,  And cheerful wait his will;  Thy hand, which guides my doubtful feet,  Shall my desires fulfil.    3 Mine innocence shalt thou display,  And make thy judgments known,  Fair as the light of dawning day,  And glorious as the noon.    6 The meek at last the earth possess,  And are the heirs of heav'n;  True riches with abundant peace,  To humble souls are given.    PAUSE.    7 Rest in the Lord and keep his way,  Nor let your anger rise,  Tho' providence should long delay  To punish haughty vice.    8 Let sinners join to break your peace,  And plot, and rage, and foam;  The Lord derides them, for he sees  Their day of vengeance come.    9 They have drawn out the threatening sword,  Have bent the murderous bow,  To slay the men that fear the Lord,  And bring the righteous low.    10 My God shall break their bows, and burn  Their persecuting darts,  Shall their own swords against them turn,  And pain surprise their hearts.      Psalm 37:2. 16 21 26-31. Second Part.  Charity to the poor; or, Religion in words and deeds.    1 Why do the wealthy wicked boast,  And grow profanely bold?  The meanest portion of the just  Excels the sinner's gold.    2 The wicked borrows of his friends,  But ne'er designs to pay;  The saint is merciful and lends,  Nor turns the poor away.    3 His alms with liberal heart he gives  Amongst the sons of need;  His memory to long ages lives,  And blessed is his seed.    4 His lips abhor to talk profane,  To slander or defraud;  His ready tongue declares to men  What he has learn'd of God.    5 The law and gospel of the Lord  Deep in his heart abide;  Led by the Spirit and the word,  His feet shall never slide.    6 When sinners fall, the righteous stand,  Preserv'd from every snare;  They shall possess the promis'd land,  And dwell for ever there.      Psalm 37:3. 23-27. Third Part.  The way and end of the righteous and the wicked.    1 My God, the steps of pious men  Are order'd by thy will;  Tho' they should fall, they rise again,  Thy hand supports them still.    2 The Lord delights to see their ways,  Their virtue he approves;  He'll ne'er deprive them of his grace,  Nor leave the men he loves.    3 The heavenly heritage is theirs,  Their portion and their home;  He feeds them now, and makes them heirs  Of blessings long to come.    4 Wait on the Lord, ye sons of men,  Nor fear when tyrants frown;  Ye shall confess their pride was vain,  When justice casts them down.    PAUSE.    5 The haughty sinner have I seen,  Nor fearing man nor God,  Like a tall bay-tree fair and green,  Spreading his arms abroad.    6 And lo! he vanish'd from the ground,  Destroy'd by hands unseen:  Nor root, nor branch, nor leaf was found  Where all that pride had been.    7 But mark the man of righteousness,  His several steps attend;  True pleasure runs thro' all his ways,  And peaceful is his end.      Psalm 38.  Guilt of conscience and relief; or, Repentance,  and prayer for pardon and health.    1 Amidst thy wrath remember love,  Restore thy servant, Lord;  Nor let a father's chastening prove  Like an avenger's sword.    2 Thine arrows stick within my heart,  My flesh is sorely prest;  Between the sorrow and the smart  My spirit finds no rest.    3 My sins a heavy load appear,  And o'er my head are gone;  Too heavy they for me to bear,  Too hard for me t' atone.    4 My thoughts are like a troubled sea,  My head still bending down;  And I go mourning all the day  Beneath my Father's frown.    5 Lord, I am weak, and broken sore,  None of my powers are whole;  The inward anguish makes me roar,  The anguish of my soul.    6 All my desire to thee is known,  Thine eye counts every tear,  And every sigh, and every groan  Is notic'd by thine ear.    7 Thou art my God, my only hope;  My God will hear my cry;  My God will bear my spirit up  When Satan bids me die.    8 [My foot is ever apt to slide,  My foes rejoice to see't;  They raise their pleasure and their pride  When they supplant my feet.    9 But I'll confess my guilt to thee,  And grieve for all my sin,  I'll mourn how weak my graces be,  And beg support divine.    10 My God, forgive my follies past,  And be for ever nigh;  O Lord of my salvation, haste,  Before thy servant die.]      Psalm 39:1. 1 2 3. First Part.  Watchfulness over the tongue;  or, Prudence and zeal.    1 Thus I resolv'd before the Lord,  \"Now will I watch my tongue,  \"Lest I let slip one sinful word,  \"Or do my neighbour wrong.\"    2 And if I'm e'er constrain'd to stay  With men of lives profane  I'll set a double guard that day,  Nor let my talk be vain.    3 I'll scarce allow my lips to speak  The pious thoughts I feel,  Lest scoffers should th' occasion take  To mock my holy zeal.    4 Yet if some proper hour appear,  I'll not be overaw'd,  But let the scoffing sinners hear  That I can speak for God.      Psalm 39:2. 4-7. Second Part.  The vanity of man as mortal.    1 Teach me the measure of my days,  Thou maker of my frame;  I would survey life's narrow space,  And learn' how frail I am.    2 A span is all that we can boast,  An inch or two of time;  Man is but vanity and dust  In all his flower and prime.    3 See the vain race of mortals move  Like shadows o'er the plain;  They rage and strive, desire and love,  But all the noise is vain.    4 Some walk in honour's gaudy show,  Some dig for golden ore,  They toil for heirs, they know not who,  And straight are seen no more.    5 What should I wish or wait for then  From creatures, earth and dust?  They make our expectations vain,  And disappoint our trust.    6 Now I forbid my carnal hope,  My fond desires recall;  I give my mortal interest up,  And make my God my all.      Psalm 39:3. 9-13. Third Part.  Sick-bed devotion; or, Pleading without repining.    1 God of my life, look gently down,  Behold the pains I feel;  But I am dumb before thy throne,  Nor dare dispute thy will.    2 Diseases are thy servants, Lord,  They come at thy command;  I'll not attempt a murmuring word  Against thy chastening hand.    3 Yet I may plead with humble cries,  Remove thy sharp rebukes;  My strength consumes, my spirit dies  Thro' thy repeated strokes.    4 Crush'd as a moth beneath thy hand,  We moulder to the dust;  Our feeble powers can ne'er withstand,  And all our beauty's lost.    5 [This mortal life decays apace,  How soon the bubble's broke!  Adam and all his numerous race  Are vanity and smoke.]    6 I'm but a sojourner below,  As all my fathers were,  May I be well prepar'd to go  When I the summons hear.    7 But if my life be spar'd awhile,  Before my last remove,  Thy praise shall be my business still,  And I'll declare thy love.      Psalm 40:1. 1 3 5 17. First Part. C. M.  A song of deliverance from great distress.    1 I waited patient for the Lord,  He bow'd to hear my cry;  He saw me resting on his word,  And brought salvation nigh.    2 He rais'd me from a horrid pit  Where mourning long I lay,  And from my bonds releas'd my feet,  Deep bonds of miry clay.    3 Firm on a rock he made me stand,  And taught my cheerful tongue  To praise the wonders of his hand,  In a new thankful song.    4 I'll spread his works of grace abroad;  The saints with joy shall hear,  And sinners learn to make my God"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13172"],[0,"True Stories of Crime From the District Attorney's Office (#11)"],[1,"brother-in-law,  John D. Abraham, had written it. Mrs. Bott, he alleged, was an old lady  and was mistaken in her testimony when she swore that he had said, \"I  have written down something.\" He had not said so. Mr. Abraham  corroborated him. He had written it himself sitting in an armchair, all  but the words \"355 West Thirty-first Street,\" which had been put in by a  certain Mr. Jopling who had been present. Mr. Jopling swore that that  was so, too. But, on cross-examination, it developed that Mr. Abraham  had been practicing making copies of the notice at the suggestion of the  lawyer for the defense, and, when Mr. Jopling took the stand, he was  called upon to explain an affidavit made by him for Assistant District  Attorney Allen, in which he affirmed that he did not know _who_ wrote  the words \"355 West Thirty-first Street.\" His explanation did not  explain, and, anyhow, there did not seem to be any particular reason why  Abraham and Jopling should have written Flechter's notice for him.  Besides, even if Flechter did _not_ write it and Abraham _did_, it would  still remain almost as bad for Flechter if it was shown that \"Cave  Dweller\" was his own brother-in-law.    But Mrs. Bott was a woman who appealed strongly to a jury's sympathies,  and she was clear that Flechter had said that he had written the notice.  Moreover, she recalled that the date had first been written _May_ and  that Flechter had erased it and inserted _March_ in its place. A  microscopic examination revealed the fact that such an erasure had been  made. When the smoke cleared the credibility of the defense appeared  badly damaged. But the precise point was of little importance, after  all. The great question was: the identity of 'CAVE DWELLER.' On this  point a number of witnesses testified from a general knowledge of  Flechter's handwriting that the \"Cave Dweller\" letter was his, and three  well-known handwriting \"experts\" (Dr. Persifor Frazer, Mr. Daniel T.  Ames and Mr. David Carvalho) swore that, in their opinion, the same hand  had written it that had penned the notice.    It is not unlikely that Flechter's fear of a conviction led him to  invite testimony in his behalf which would not bear the test of careful  scrutiny. Many an innocent man has paid the penalty for uncommitted  crime because he has sought to bolster up his defense with doubtful  evidence without the incubus of which he would have been acquitted.    Naturally the chief point against Flechter, if it could be established,  was his actual possession of the Bott Stradivarius when he was arrested.  Upon this proposition Mrs. Bott was absolutely positive beyond the  possibility of error. So were eight other witnesses for the prosecution.  Then the defense produced a violin alleged to be the same one exhibited  in the police court and brought by Flechter to Durden's house, and asked  Mrs. Bott and her witnesses what they thought of it. Mrs. Bott could not  identify it, but she swore no less positively that it was an entirely  _different_ violin from the one which she had seen before the  magistrate. Then Osborne hurled his bomb over his enemy's parapet and  cried loudly that a monstrous wicked fraud had been perpetrated to  thwart Justice--that the defense had \"faked\" another violin and were now  trying to foist the bogus thing in evidence to deceive the Court. _Ten  witnesses_ for the prosecution now swore that the violin so produced  was _not_ the one which Flechter had tried to sell Durden. Of course it  would have been comparatively easy to \"fake\" a violin, just as Osborne  claimed, and the case sheds some light upon the possibilities of the  \"old violin\" industry.    The star witness for the prosecution to prove that the instrument  produced in the police court _was_ the Bott violin was August M.  Gemunder, and his testimony upon the trial before Recorder Goff is  worthy of careful examination, since the jury considered it of great  importance in reaching a verdict, even requesting that it should be  re-read to them some hours after retiring to deliberate. Gemunder  testified, in substance, that he belonged to a family which had been  making violins for three generations and had himself been making them  for twenty years, that he was familiar with Bott's Stradivarius, having  seen it three times, and that he firmly believed a large part of the  violin produced before the magistrate _was_ the missing Bott--certainly  the back and scroll. Moreover, he was able to describe the markings of  the Bott violin even to the label inside it. It should be mentioned,  however, that in the magistrate's court he had been called only to  _describe_ the Bott violin and not to _identify_ the one produced as the  Bott itself. He further swore that the violin now offered by the defense  on the trial was _not_ the one in evidence before the magistrate, but  was one which he had sold some years before to one Charles Palm.    The defense, on the other hand, called among its witnesses John P.  Frederick, a violin maker, who testified that he was familiar with the  Bott Strad. and had seen it in 1873 at Bott's house, Grenecher Castle,  in Germany; that he had repaired it in this country in 1885; that the  instrument in court was not a Strad. nor even a good imitation of one,  and, of course, was not the \"Duke of Cambridge,\" but that it _was_ the  identical instrument produced before the magistrate, and one which he  recognized as having been sent him for repair by Charles Palm in 1885.    Thus both sides agreed that the fiddle now offered in evidence was a  bogus Strad. once belonging to a man named Palm, the only element of  conflict being as to whether or not the violin which Flechter had  offered for sale was the Palm instrument, or, in fact, Bott's famous  \"Duke of Cambridge.\"    All this technical testimony about violins and violin structure  naturally bored the jury almost to extinction, and even the bitter  personal encounters of counsel did not serve to relieve the dreariness  of the trial. One oasis of humor in this desert of dry evidence gave  them passing refreshment, when a picturesque witness for the defense, an  instrument maker named Franz Bruckner, from South Germany, having been  asked if the violin shown him was a Strad., replied, with a grunt of  disgust: \"Ach Himmel, nein!\" Being then invited to describe all the  characteristics of genuine Stradivarius workmanship, he tore his hair  and, with an expression of utter hopelessness upon his wrinkled face,  exclaimed despairingly to the interpreter:    \"Doctor, if I gave you lessons in this every day for three weeks you  would know no more than you do now!\"--an answer which was probably true,  and equally so of the jury who were shouldered with the almost  impossible task of determining from this mass of conflicting opinion  just where the truth really lay.    The chief witness for the defense was John J. Eller, who testified that  he had been a musician for thirty years and a collector of violins; that  the violin in court was the same one produced before the magistrate, and  was not Bott's, but _his own_; that he had first seen it in the  possession of Charles Palm in 1886 in his house in Eighth Street and St.  Mark's Place, New York City, had borrowed it from Palm and played on it  for two months in Seabright, and had finally purchased it from Palm in  1891, and continued to play in concerts upon it, until having been  loaned by him to a music teacher named Perotti, in Twenty-third Street,  it was stolen by the latter and sold to Flechter.    It appeared that Eller had at once brought suit against Flechter for the  possession of the instrument, which suit, he asserted, he was still  pressing in the courts, and he now declared that the violin was in  exactly the same condition in every respect as when produced in the  police court, although it had been changed in some respects since it had  been stolen. It had originally been made of baked wood by one Dedier  Nicholas (an instrument maker of the first half of the nineteenth  century), and stamped with the maker's name, but this inscription was  now covered by a Stradivarius label. Eller scornfully pointed out that  no Strad. had ever been made of baked wood, and showed the jury certain  pegs used by no other maker than Nicholas, and certain marks worn upon  the instrument by his, the witness', own playing. He also exhibited the  check with which he had paid for it.    In support of this evidence Charles Palm himself was called by the  defense and identified the violin as one which he had bought some twelve  years before for fifteen or twenty dollars and later sold to Eller. Upon  the question of the identity of the instrument then lying before the  jury this evidence was conclusive, but, of course, it did not satisfy  the jury as to whether Flechter had tried to sell the Palm violin or  Bott's violin to Durden. Unfortunately Eller's evidence threw a side  light on the defence without which the trial might well have resulted in  an acquittal.    Eller had sworn that he was still vigorously endeavoring to get the Palm  violin back from Flechter. As contradicting him in this respect, and as  tending to show that the suit had not only been compromised but that he  and Flechter were engaged in trying to put off the Palm violin as a  genuine Stradivarius and share the profit of the fraud, the prosecution  introduced the following letter from the witness to his lawyer:        CLIFTON HOUSE, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.        _March 23, 1896._        _Dear Counsellor_: Received your letter just now. I have been      expecting Mr. Flechter's lawyer would settle with you; he got nine      hundred dollars for the violin and Mr. Meyer arranged with myself      for the half, four hundred and fifty dollars, which he proposed      himself and have been expecting a settlement on their part long ago.      I have assisted Mr. Palmer, his able lawyer, with the best of my      ability, _and have"]]]
