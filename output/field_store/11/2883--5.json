Proud the boast the proud lips breathe:--          \"My house is built upon a rock,          And sees unmoved the stormy shock            Of waves that fret below!\"          What chain so strong, what girth so great,          To bind the giant form of Fate?--            Swift are the steps of Woe.      V            Now the casting may begin;            See the breach indented there:          Ere we run the fusion in,            Halt--and speed the pious prayer!              Pull the bung out--              See around and about    What vapor, what vapor--God help us!--has risen?--    Ha! the flame like a torrent leaps forth from its prison!            What friend is like the might of fire            When man can watch and wield the ire?            Whate'er we shape or work, we owe            Still to that heaven-descended glow.    But dread the heaven-descended glow,    When from their chain its wild wings go,    When, where it listeth, wide and wild    Sweeps the Free Nature's free-born Child!    When the Frantic One fleets,     While no force can withstand,    Through the populous streets     Whirling ghastly the brand;    For the Element hates    What man's labor creates,     And the work of his hand!    Impartially out from the cloud,    Or the curse or the blessing may fall!    Benignantly out from the cloud,     Come the dews, the revivers of all!    Avengingly out from the cloud     Come the levin, the bolt, and the ball!    Hark--a wail from the steeple!--aloud    The bell shrills its voice to the crowd!        Look--look--red as blood           All on high!    It is not the daylight that fills with its flood     The sky!    What a clamor awaking     Roars up through the street!    What a hell-vapor breaking     Rolls on through the street!     And higher and higher     Aloft moves the Column of Fire!     Through the vistas and rows     Like a whirlwind it goes,     And the air like the steam from a furnace glows.    Beams are crackling--posts are shrinking--    Walls are sinking--windows clinking      Children crying--      Mothers flying--    And the beast (the black ruin yet smoldering under)    Yells the howl of its pain and its ghastly wonder!    Hurry and skurry--away--away,    The face of the night is as clear as day!            As the links in a chain,            Again and again          Flies the bucket from hand to hand;            High in arches up-rushing            The engines are gushing,    And the flood, as a beast on the prey that it hounds,    With a roar on the breast of the element bounds.            To the grain and the fruits,            Through the rafters and beams,    Through the barns and the garners it crackles and streams!    As if they would rend up the earth from its roots,            Rush the flames to the sky            Giant-high;    And at length,    Wearied out and despairing, man bows to their strength!    With an idle gaze sees their wrath consume,    And submits to his doom!      Desolate    The place, and dread    For storms the barren bed!    In the blank voids that cheerful casements were,    Comes to and fro the melancholy air,      And sits despair;    And through the ruin, blackening in its shroud,    Peers, as it flits, the melancholy cloud.      One human glance of grief upon the grave      Of all that Fortune gave      The loiterer takes--then turns him to depart,      And grasps the wanderer's staff and mans his heart:      Whatever else the element bereaves      One blessing more than all it reft--it leaves      The face that he loves!--He counts them o'er,      See--not one look is missing from that store!      VI        Now clasped the bell within the clay--        The mold the mingled metals fill--        Oh, may it, sparkling into day,      Reward the labor and the skill!        Alas! should it fail,        For the mold may be frail--    And still with our hope must be mingled the fear--    And, ev'n now, while we speak, the mishap may be near!      To the dark womb of sacred earth        This labor of our hands is given,      As seeds that wait the second birth,        And turn to blessings watched by heaven!      Ah seeds, how dearer far than they        We bury in the dismal tomb,      Where Hope and Sorrow bend to pray      That suns beyond the realm of day        May warm them into bloom!              From the steeple                Tolls the bell,              Deep and heavy,                The death-knell,    Guiding with dirge-note--solemn, sad, and slow,    To the last home earth's weary wanderers know.      It is that worshipped wife--      It is that faithful mother![14]    Whom the dark Prince of Shadows leads benighted,    From that dear arm where oft she hung delighted.    Far from those blithe companions, born    Of her, and blooming in their morn;    On whom, when couched her heart above,    So often looked the Mother-Love!      Ah! rent the sweet Home's union-band,        And never, never more to come--      She dwells within the shadowy land,        Who was the Mother of that Home!      How oft they miss that tender guide,        The care--the watch--the face--the MOTHER--    And where she sate the babes beside,      Sits with unloving looks--ANOTHER!      VII      While the mass is cooling now,      Let the labor yield to leisure,    As the bird upon the bough,      Loose the travail to the pleasure.        When the soft stars awaken!        Each task be forsaken!    And the vesper-bell, lulling the earth into peace,    If the master still toil, chimes the workman's release!    Homeward from the tasks of day,    Through the greenwood's welcome way    Wends the wanderer, blithe and cheerily,    To the cottage loved so dearly!    And the eye and ear are meeting,    Now, the slow sheep homeward bleating;    Now, the wonted shelter near,    Lowing the lusty-fronted steer    Creaking now the heavy wain,    Reels with the happy harvest grain;    While, with many-colored leaves,    Glitters the garland on the sheaves;    For the mower's work is done,    And the young folks' dance begun!    Desert street, and quiet mart;--    Silence is in the city's heart;    And the social taper lighteth    Each dear face that HOME uniteth;    While the gate the town before    Heavily swings with sullen roar!    Though darkness is spreading    O'er earth--the Upright    And the Honest, undreading,    Look safe on the night    Which the evil man watches in awe,    For the eye of the Night is the Law!    Bliss-dowered! O daughter of the skies,    Hail, holy ORDER, whose employ    Blends like to like in light and joy--    Builder of cities, who of old    Called the wild man from waste and wold,    And, in his but thy presence stealing,    Roused each familiar household feeling,    And, best of all, the happy ties,    The centre of the social band--    _The Instinct of the Fatherland!_    United thus--each helping each,    Brisk work the countless hands forever;    For naught its power to Strength can teach,    Like Emulation and Endeavor!    Thus linked the master with the man,    Each in his rights can each revere,    And while they march in freedom's van,    Scorn the lewd rout that dogs the rear!    To freemen labor is renown!    Who works--gives blessings and commands;    Kings glory in the orb and crown--    Be ours the glory of our hands,    Long in these walls--long may we greet    Your footfalls, Peace and Concord sweet!    Distant the day, oh! distant far,    When the rude hordes of trampling War    Shall scare the silent vale--    The where    Now the sweet heaven, when day doth leave    The air,    Limns its soft rose-hues on the veil of Eve--    Shall the fierce war-brand, tossing in the gale,    From town and hamlet shake the horrent glare!      VIII      Now, its destined task fulfilled,    Asunder break the prison-mold;    Let the goodly Bell we build,        Eye and heart alike behold.          The hammer down heave,          Till the cover it cleave:--    For not till we shatter the wall of its cell    Can we lift from its darkness and bondage the Bell.      To break the mold the master may,        If skilled the hand and ripe the hour;      But woe, when on its fiery way        The metal seeks itself to pour,      Frantic and blind, with thunder-knell,        Exploding from its shattered home,      And glaring forth, as from a hell,        Behold the red Destruction come!      When rages strength that has no reason,      There breaks the mold before the season;      When numbers burst what bound before,      Woe to the State that thrives no more!      Yea, woe, when in the City's heart,        The latent spark to flame is blown,     \"Freedom! Equality!\"--to blood      And Millions from their silence start,        To claim, without a guide, their own!      Discordant howls the warning Bell,        Proclaiming discord wide and far,      And, born but things of peace to tell,        Becomes the ghastliest voice of war:     \"Freedom! Equality!\"--to blood        Rush the roused people at the sound!      Through street, hall, palace, roars the flood,        And banded murder closes round!      The hyena-shapes (that women were!)        Jest with the horrors they survey;      They hound--they rend--they mangle there,        As panthers with their prey!      Naught rests to hallow--burst the ties        Of life's sublime and reverent awe;    Before the Vice the Virtue flies,          And Universal Crime is Law!        Man fears the lion's kingly tread;          Man fears the tiger's fangs of terror;        And still, the dreadliest of the dread,          Is Man himself in error!        No torch, though lit from Heaven, illumes          The Blind!--Why place it in his hands?        It lights not him--it but consumes          The City and the Land!

His estates in the south of Hungary constantly required his attention, and  he was a frequent visitor in Vienna. The German Emperor, though he could  not help admiring Ferdinand's success, was always a little afraid of him;  he felt that Ferdinand's gifts were so similar to his own that he would be  unable to count on him in an emergency. Moreover, it was difficult to  reconcile Ferdinand's ambitions in extreme south-eastern Europe with his  own. Ferdinand's relations with Vienna, on the other hand, and especially  with the late Archduke Francis Ferdinand, were both cordial and intimate.    The gradual aggravation of the condition of the Turkish Empire, notably in  Macedonia, the unredeemed Bulgaria, where since the insurrection of 1902-3  anarchy, always endemic, had deteriorated into a reign of terror, and,  also the unmistakably growing power and spirit of Serbia since the  accession of the Karageorgevich dynasty in 1903, caused uneasiness in  Sofia, no less than in Vienna and Budapest. The Young Turkish revolution  of July 1908, and the triumph of the Committee of Union and Progress,  disarmed the critics of Turkey who wished to make the forcible  introduction of reforms a pretext for their interference; but the  potential rejuvenation of the Ottoman Empire which it foreshadowed  indicated the desirability of rapid and decisive action. In September,  after fomenting a strike on the Oriental Railway in eastern Roumelia  (which railway was Turkish property), the Sofia Cabinet seized the line  with a military force on the plea of political necessity. At the same time  Ferdinand, with his second wife, the Protestant Princess Eleonora of  Reuss, whom he had married in March of that year, was received with regal  honours by the Emperor of Austria at Budapest. On October 5, 1908, at  Tirnovo, the ancient capital, Ferdinand proclaimed the complete  independence of Bulgaria and eastern Rumelia under himself as King (_Tsar_  in Bulgarian), and on October 7 Austria-Hungary announced the annexation  of Bosnia and Hercegovina, the two Turkish provinces administered by it  since 1879, nominally under Turkish suzerainty.        13    _The Kingdom_, 1908-13    (cf. Chaps. 14, 20)      The events which have taken place in Bulgaria since 1908 hinge on the  Macedonian question, which has not till now been mentioned. The Macedonian  question was extremely complicated; it started on the assumption that the  disintegration of Turkey, which had been proceeding throughout the  nineteenth century, would eventually be completed, and the question was  how in this eventuality to satisfy the territorial claims of the three  neighbouring countries, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece, claims both  historical and ethnological, based on the numbers and distribution of  their 'unredeemed' compatriots in Macedonia, and at the same time avoid  causing the armed interference of Europe.    The beginnings of the Macedonian question in its modern form do not go  farther back than 1885, when the ease with which eastern Rumelia (i.e.  southern Bulgaria) threw off the Turkish yoke and was spontaneously united  with the semi-independent principality of northern Bulgaria affected the  imagination of the Balkan statesmen. From that time Sofia began to cast  longing eyes on Macedonia, the whole of which was claimed as 'unredeemed  Bulgaria', and Stambulov's last success in 1894 was to obtain from Turkey  the consent to the establishment of two bishops of the Bulgarian  (Exarchist) Church in Macedonia, which was a heavy blow for the Greek  Patriarchate at Constantinople.    Macedonia had been envisaged by the Treaty of Berlin, article 23 of which  stipulated for reforms in that province; but in those days the Balkan  States were too young and weak to worry themselves or the European powers  over the troubles of their co-religionists in Turkey; their hands were  more than full setting their own houses in some sort of order, and it was  in nobody's interest to reform Macedonia, so article 23 remained the  expression of a philanthropic sentiment. This indifference on the part of  Europe left the door open for the Balkan States, as soon as they had  energy to spare, to initiate their campaign for extending their spheres of  influence in Macedonia.    From 1894 onwards Bulgarian propaganda in Macedonia increased, and the  Bulgarians were soon followed by Greeks and Serbians. The reason for this  passionate pegging out of claims and the bitter rivalry of the three  nations which it engendered was the following: The population of Macedonia  was nowhere, except in the immediate vicinity of the borders of these  three countries, either purely Bulgar or purely Greek or purely Serb; most  of the towns contained a percentage of at least two of these  nationalities, not to mention the Turks (who after all were still the  owners of the country by right of conquest), Albanians, Tartars, Rumanians  (Vlakhs), and others; the city of Salonika was and is almost purely  Jewish, while in the country districts Turkish, Albanian, Greek, Bulgar,  and Serb villages were inextricably confused. Generally speaking, the  coastal strip was mainly Greek (the coast itself purely so), the interior  mainly Slav. The problem was for each country to peg out as large a claim  as possible, and so effectively, by any means in their power, to make the  majority of the population contained in that claim acknowledge itself to  be Bulgar, or Serb, or Greek, that when the agony of the Ottoman Empire  was over, each part of Macedonia would automatically fall into the arms of  its respective deliverers. The game was played through the appropriate  media of churches and schools, for the unfortunate Macedonian peasants had  first of all to be enlightened as to who they were, or rather as to who  they were told they had got to consider themselves, while the Church, as  always, conveniently covered a multitude of political aims; when those  methods flagged, a bomb would be thrown at, let us say, a Turkish official  by an _agent provocateur_ of one of the three players, inevitably  resulting in the necessary massacre of innocent Christians by the  ostensibly brutal but really equally innocent Turks, and an outcry in the  European press.    Bulgaria was first in the field and had a considerable start of the other  two rivals. The Bulgars claimed the whole of Macedonia, including Salonika  and all the Aegean coast (except Chalcidice), Okhrida, and Monastir;  Greece claimed all southern Macedonia, and Serbia parts of northern and  central Macedonia known as Old Serbia. The crux of the whole problem was,  and is, that the claims of Serbia and Greece do not clash, while that of  Bulgaria, driving a thick wedge between Greece and Serbia, and thus giving  Bulgaria the undoubted hegemony of the peninsula, came into irreconcilable  conflict with those of its rivals. The importance of this point was  greatly emphasized by the existence of the Nish-Salonika railway, which is  Serbia's only direct outlet to the sea, and runs through Macedonia from  north to south, following the right or western bank of the river Vardar.  Should Bulgaria straddle that, Serbia would be economically at its mercy,  just as in the north it was already, to its bitter cost, at the mercy of  Austria-Hungary. Nevertheless, Bulgarian propaganda had been so effectual  that Serbia and Greece never expected they would eventually be able to  join hands so easily and successfully as they afterwards did.    The then unknown quantity of Albania was also a factor. This people,  though small in numbers, was formidable in character, and had never been  effectually subdued by the Turks. They would have been glad to have a  boundary contiguous with that of Bulgaria (with whom they had no quarrel)  as a support against their hereditary enemies, Serbs in the north and  Greeks in the south, who were more than inclined to encroach on their  territory. The population of Macedonia, being still under Turkish rule,  was uneducated and ignorant; needless to say it had no national  consciousness, though this was less true of the Greeks than of the Slavs.  It is the Slav population of Macedonia that has engendered so much heat  and caused so much blood to be spilt. The dispute as to whether it is  rather Serb or Bulgar has caused interminable and most bitter controversy.  The truth is that it _was_ neither the one nor the other, but that, the  ethnological and linguistic missionaries of Bulgaria having been first in  the field, a majority of the Macedonian Slavs had been so long and so  persistently told that they were Bulgars, that after a few years Bulgaria  could, with some truth, claim that this fact was so.    Macedonia had been successively under Greek, Bulgar, and Serb, before  Turkish, rule, but the Macedonian Slavs had, under the last, been so cut  off both from Bulgars and Serbs, that ethnologically and linguistically  they did not develop the characteristics of either of these two races,  which originally belonged to the same southern Slav stock, but remained a  primitive neutral Slav type. If the Serbs had been first in the field  instead of the Bulgars, the Macedonian Slavs could just as easily have  been made into Serbs, sufficiently plausibly to convince the most knowing  expert. The well-known recipe for making a Macedonian Slav village Bulgar  is to add _-ov_ or _-ev_ (pronounced _-off, -yeff_) on to the names of all  the male inhabitants, and to make it Serb it is only necessary to add  further the syllable _-ich, -ov_ and _-ovich_ being respectively the  equivalent in Bulgarian and Serbian of our termination _-son,_ e. g.  _Ivanov_ in Bulgarian, and _Jovanovit_ in Serbian = _Johnson_.    In addition to these three nations Rumania also entered the lists,  suddenly horrified at discovering the sad plight of the Vlakh shepherds,  who had probably wandered with unconcern about Macedonia with their herds  since Roman times.
