[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11252"],[0,"Martin Hewitt, Investigator (#11)"],[1,"III.      THE CASE OF MR. FOGGATT.    Almost the only dogmatism that Martin Hewitt permitted himself in regard  to his professional methods was one on the matter of accumulative  probabilities. Often when I have remarked upon the apparently trivial  nature of the clews by which he allowed himself to be guided--sometimes,  to all seeming, in the very face of all likelihood--he has replied that  two trivialities, pointing in the same direction, became at once, by their  mere agreement, no trivialities at all, but enormously important  considerations. \"If I were in search of a man,\" he would say, \"of whom I  knew nothing but that he squinted, bore a birthmark on his right hand, and  limped, and I observed a man who answered to the first peculiarity, so far  the clue would be trivial, because thousands of men squint. Now, if that  man presently moved and exhibited a birthmark on his right hand, the  value of that squint and that mark would increase at once a hundred or  a thousand fold. Apart they are little; together much. The weight of  evidence is not doubled merely; it would be only doubled if half the men  who squinted had right-hand birthmarks; whereas the proportion, if it  could be ascertained, would be, perhaps, more like one in ten thousand.  The two trivialities, pointing in the same direction, become very strong  evidence. And, when the man is seen to walk with a limp, that limp  (another triviality), re-enforcing the others, brings the matter to the  rank of a practical certainty. The Bertillon system of identification--what  is it but a summary of trivialities? Thousands of men are of the same  height, thousands of the same length of foot, thousands of the same girth  of head--thousands correspond in any separate measurement you may name. It  is when the measurements are taken _together_ that you have your man  identified forever. Just consider how few, if any, of your friends  correspond exactly in any two personal peculiarities.\" Hewitt's dogma  received its illustration unexpectedly close at home.    The old house wherein my chambers and Hewitt's office were situated  contained, besides my own, two or three more bachelors' dens, in addition  to the offices on the ground and first and second floors. At the very top  of all, at the back, a fat, middle-aged man, named Foggatt, occupied a set  of four rooms. It was only after a long residence, by an accidental remark  of the housekeeper's, that I learned the man's name, which was not painted  on his door or displayed, with all the others, on the wall of the  ground-floor porch.    Mr. Foggatt appeared to have few friends, but lived in something as nearly  approaching luxury as an old bachelor living in chambers can live. An  ascending case of champagne was a common phenomenon of the staircase, and  I have more than once seen a picture, destined for the top floor, of a  sort that went far to awaken green covetousness in the heart of a poor  journalist.    The man himself was not altogether prepossessing. Fat as he was, he had a  way of carrying his head forward on his extended neck and gazing widely  about with a pair of the roundest and most prominent eyes I remember to  have ever seen, except in a fish. On the whole, his appearance was rather  vulgar, rather arrogant, and rather suspicious, without any very  pronounced quality of any sort. But certainly he was not pretty. In the  end, however, he was found shot dead in his sitting-room.    It was in this way: Hewitt and I had dined together at my club, and late  in the evening had returned to my rooms to smoke and discuss whatever came  uppermost. I had made a bargain that day with two speculative odd lots at  a book sale, each of which contained a hidden prize. We sat talking and  turning over these books while time went unperceived, when suddenly we  were startled by a loud report. Clearly it was in the building. We  listened for a moment, but heard nothing else, and then Hewitt expressed  his opinion that the report was that of a gunshot. Gunshots in residential  chambers are not common things, wherefore I got up and went to the  landing, looking up the stairs and down.    At the top of the next flight I saw Mrs. Clayton, the housekeeper. She  appeared to be frightened, and told me that the report came from Mr.  Foggatt's room. She thought he might have had an accident with the pistol  that usually lay on his mantel-piece. We went upstairs with her, and she  knocked at Mr. Foggatt's door.    There was no reply. Through the ventilating fanlight over the door it  could be seen that there were lights within, a sign, Mrs. Clayton  maintained, that Mr. Foggatt was not out. We knocked again, much more  loudly, and called, but still ineffectually. The door was locked, and an  application of the housekeeper's key proved that the tenant's key had been  left in the lock inside. Mrs. Clayton's conviction that \"something had  happened\" became distressing, and in the end Hewitt pried open the door  with a small poker.    Something _had_ happened. In the sitting-room Mr. Foggatt sat with his  head bowed over the table, quiet and still. The head was ill to look at,  and by it lay a large revolver, of the full-sized army pattern. Mrs.  Clayton ran back toward the landing with faint screams.    \"Run, Brett!\" said Hewitt; \"a doctor and a policeman!\"    I bounced down the stairs half a flight at a time. \"First,\" I thought, \"a  doctor. He may not be dead.\" I could think of no doctor in the immediate  neighborhood, but ran up the street away from the Strand, as being the  more likely direction for the doctor, although less so for the policeman.  It took me a good five minutes to find the medico, after being led astray  by a red lamp at a private hotel, and another five to get back, with a  policeman.    Foggatt was dead, without a doubt. Probably had shot himself, the doctor  thought, from the powder-blackening and other circumstances. Certainly  nobody could have left the room by the door, or he must have passed my  landing, while the fact of the door being found locked from the inside  made the thing impossible. There were two windows to the room, both of  which were shut, one being fastened by the catch, while the catch of the  other was broken--an old fracture. Below these windows was a sheer drop of  fifty feet or more, without a foot or hand-hold near. The windows in the  other rooms were shut and fastened. Certainly it seemed suicide--unless it  were one of those accidents that will occur to people who fiddle  ignorantly with firearms. Soon the rooms were in possession of the police,  and we were turned out.    We looked in at the housekeeper's kitchen, where her daughter was reviving  and calming Mrs. Clayton with gin and water.    \"You mustn't upset yourself, Mrs. Clayton,\" Hewitt said, \"or what will  become of us all? The doctor thinks it was an accident.\"    He took a small bottle of sewing-machine oil from his pocket and handed it  to the daughter, thanking her for the loan.           *       *       *       *       *    There was little evidence at the inquest. The shot had been heard, the  body had been found--that was the practical sum of the matter. No friends  or relatives of the dead man came forward. The doctor gave his opinion as  to the probability of suicide or an accident, and the police evidence  tended in the same direction. Nothing had been found to indicate that any  other person had been near the dead man's rooms on the night of the  fatality. On the other hand, his papers, bankbook, etc., proved him to be  a man of considerable substance, with no apparent motive for suicide. The  police had been unable to trace any relatives, or, indeed, any nearer  connections than casual acquaintances, fellow-clubmen, and so on. The jury  found that Mr. Foggatt had died by accident.    \"Well, Brett,\" Hewitt asked me afterward, \"what do you think of the  verdict?\"    I said that it seemed to be the most reasonable one possible, and to  square with the common-sense view of the case.    \"Yes,\" he replied, \"perhaps it does. From the point of view of the jury,  and on their information, their verdict was quite reasonable.  Nevertheless, Mr. Foggatt did not shoot himself. He was shot by a rather  tall, active young man, perhaps a sailor, but certainly a gymnast--a young  man whom I think I could identify if I saw him.\"    \"But how do you know this?\"    \"By the simplest possible inferences, which you may easily guess, if you  will but think.\"    \"But, then, why didn't you say this at the inquest?\"    \"My dear fellow, they don't want any inferences and conjectures at an  inquest; they only want evidence. If I had traced the murderer, of course  then I should have communicated with the police. As a matter of fact, it  is quite possible that the police have observed and know as much as I  do--or more. They don't give everything away at an inquest, you know. It  wouldn't do.\"    \"But, if you are right, how did the man get away?\"    \"Come, we are near home now. Let us take a look at the back of the house.  He _couldn't_ have left by Foggatt's landing door, as we know; and as he  _was_ there (I am certain of that), and as the chimney is out of the  question--for there was a good fire in the grate--he must have gone out by  the window. Only one window is possible--that with the broken catch--for  all the others were fastened inside. Out of that window, then, he went.\"    \"But how? The window is fifty feet up.\"    \"Of course it is. But why _will_ you persist in assuming that the only way  of escape by a window is downward? See, now, look up there. The window is  at the top floor, and it has a very broad sill. Over the window is nothing  but the flat face of the gable-end; but to the right, and a foot or two  above the level of the top of the window, an iron gutter ends. Observe, it  is not of lead composition, but a strong iron gutter, supported, just at  its end, by an iron bracket.

Self-Support and Support of Aged Slaves in Slave Times    \"A white man asked me how much they givin' me. I said, 'Eight dollars.'  He said, 'You ought to be gittin' twenty-five.' I said, 'Maybe I ought  to be but I ain't.'    \"I ain't able to do no work now. I ain't able to tote that wood hardly.  I don't git as much consideration as they give the slaves back yonder.  They didn't make the old people in slavery work when they was my age. My  daddy when he was my age, they turned him out. They give him a rice  patch where he could make his rice. When he died, he had a whole lot of  rice. They stopped putting all the slaves out at hard labor when they  got old. That's one thing. White folks will take care of their old ones.  Our folks won't do it. They'll take a stick and kill you. They don't  recognize you're human. Their parents don't teach them. Folks done quit  teaching their children. They don't teach them the right thing no more.  If they don't do, then they ought to make them do.      Little Rock    \"I been here about twenty years in Little Rock. I went and bought this  place and paid for it. Somebody stole seventy-five dollars from me right  here in this house. And that got me down. I ain't never been able to git  up since.    \"I paid a man for what he did for me. He said, 'Well, you owe me fifteen  cents.' When he got done he said, 'You owe me fifty cents.' You can't  trust a man in the city.    \"I was living down in England. That's a little old country town. I come  here to Little Rock where I could be in a city. I done well. I bought  this place.    \"I reckon I lived in Arkansas about thirty years before I left and come  here to Little Rock. When I left Georgia, I come to Arkansas and settled  down in Lonoke County, made crops there. I couldn't tell you how long I  stayed there. I didn't keep no record of it at all. I come out of Lonoke  County and went into Jefferson.    \"Man, I was never in such shape as I am in now. That devilish stock law  killed me. It killed all the people. Nobody ain't been able to do  nothin' since they passed the stock law. I had seventy-five hogs and  twenty cows. They made a law you had to keep them chickens up, keep them  hogs up, keep them cows up. They shoots at every right thing, and the  wrong things they don't shoot at.

Arkansas      _EX-SLAVE AND RIDDLES_    \"I was born in the Junction city community and belonged to the Cooks. I  was ten years old at surrender. Mother and father had 12 children and we  lived in a one room log cabin and cooked on a fireplace and oven. Mos  and Miss Cook did not allow ma and pa to whip me. When ever I do  something and I knew I was going to get a whipping I would make it to  old Miss. She would keep me from getting that whipping. I was a devilish  boy. I would do everything in the world I could think of just for  devilment. Old mos was sure good to his slaves. I never went to school  a day in my life. Old Miss would carry me to church sometimes when it  was hot so we could fan for her. We used palmeter fan leaves for fans.  We ate pretty good in slavery time, but we did not have all of this late  stuff. Some of our dishes was possum stew, vegetables, persimmon pie and  tato bread. Ma did not allow us to sit around grown folks. When they  were talking she always made us get under the bed. Our bed was made from  pine poles. We children slept on pallets on the floor. The way slaves  married in slavery time they jumped over the broom and when they  separated they jumped backward over the broom. Times were better in  slavery time to my notion than they are now because they did not go  hungry, neither necked. They ate common and wore one kind of clothes.\"    A duck, a bullfrog and a skunk went to a circus, the duck and the  bullfrog got in, why didn't the skunk get in?    (Answer).

Persistence of Slave Customs    \"While I was a slave and was born close to the end of the Civil War, I  remember seeing many of the soldiers down here. I remember much of the  treatment given to the slaves. I used to say 'master' myself in my day.  We had to do that till after '69 or '70. I remember the time when I  couldn't go nowhere without asking the 'white folks.' I wasn't a slave  then but I couldn't go off without asking the white people. I didn't  know no better.    \"I have known the time in the southern part of this state when if you  wanted to give an entertainment you would have to ask the white folks.  Didn't know no better. For years and years, most of the niggers just  stayed with the white folks. Didn't want to leave them.
