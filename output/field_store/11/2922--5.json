A knowledge of it  formed part of the equipment of the painters who made glorious the  golden noon of pictorial art in Italy during the Renaissance. The  problem which preoccupied them was, as Symonds says of Leonardo,  \"to submit the freest play of form to simple figures of geometry in  grouping.\" Alberti held that the painter should above all things have  mastered geometry, and it is known that the study of perspective and  kindred subjects was widespread and popular.    [Illustration 54]    The first painter who deliberately rather than instinctively based  his compositions on geometrical principles seems to have been Fra  Bartolommeo, in his Last Judgment, in the church of St. Maria Nuova,  in Florence. Symonds says of this picture, \"Simple figures--the  pyramid and triangle, upright, inverted, and interwoven like the  rhymes of a sonnet--form the basis of the composition. This system was  adhered to by the Fratre in all his subsequent works\" (Illustration  54). Raphael, with that power of assimilation which distinguishes  him among men of genius, learned from Fra Bartolommeo this method  of disposing figures and combining them in masses with almost  mathematical precision. It would have been indeed surprising if  Leonardo da Vinci, in whom the artist and the man of science were  so wonderfully united, had not been greatly preoccupied with the  mathematics of the art of painting. His Madonna of the Rocks, and  Virgin on the Lap of Saint Anne, in the Louvre, exhibit the very  perfection of pyramidal composition. It is however in his masterpiece,  The Last Supper, that he combines geometrical symmetry and precision  with perfect naturalness and freedom in the grouping of individually  interesting and dramatic figures. Michael Angelo, Andrea del Sarto,  and the great Venetians, in whose work the art of painting may be said  to have culminated, recognized and obeyed those mathematical laws of  composition known to their immediate predecessors, and the decadence  of the art in the ensuing period may be traced not alone to the false  sentiment and affectation of the times, but also in the abandonment by  the artists of those obscurely geometrical arrangements and groupings  which in the works of the greatest masters so satisfy the eye and  haunt the memory of the beholder (Illustrations 55, 56).    [Illustration 55: THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE IN  RENAISSANCE PAINTING]    [Illustration 56: GEOMETRICAL BASIS OF THE SISTINE CEILING PAINTINGS]    [Illustration 57: ASSYRIAN; GREEK]    [Illustration 58: THE GEOMETRICAL BASIS OF THE PLAN IN ARCHITECTURAL  DESIGN]    [Illustration 59]    Sculpture, even more than painting, is based on geometry. The colossi  of Egypt, the bas-reliefs of Assyria, the figured pediments and  metopes of the temples of Greece, the carved tombs of Revenna,  the Della Robbia lunettes, the sculptured tympani of Gothic church  portals, all alike lend themselves in greater or less degree to a  geometrical synopsis (Illustration 57). Whenever sculpture suffered  divorce from architecture the geometrical element became less  prominent, doubtless because of all the arts architecture is the most  clearly and closely related to geometry. Indeed, it may be said that  architecture is geometry made visible, in the same sense that music  is number made audible. A building is an aggregation of the commonest  geometrical forms: parallelograms, prisms, pyramids and cones--the  cylinder appearing in the column, and the hemisphere in the dome.  The plans likewise of the world's famous buildings reduced to their  simplest expression are discovered to resolve themselves into a few  simple geometrical figures. (Illustration 58). This is the \"bed rock\"  of all excellent design.    [Illustration 60: EGYPTIAN; GREEK; ROMAN; MEDIAEVAL]    [Illustration 61: JEFFERSON'S PEN SKETCH FOR THE ROTUNDA OF THE  UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA]    [Illustration 62: APPLICATION OF THE EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE TO THE  ERECHTHEUM AT ATHENS]    [Illustration 63]    [Illustration 64: THE EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE IN ROMAN ARCHITECTURE]    But architecture is geometrical in another and a higher sense than  this. Emerson says: \"The pleasure a palace or a temple gives the eye  is that an order and a method has been communicated to stones, so that  they speak and geometrize, become tender or sublime with expression.\"  All truly great and beautiful works of architecture from the Egyptian  pyramids to the cathedrals of Ile-de-France--are harmoniously  proportioned, their principal and subsidiary masses being related,  sometimes obviously, more often obscurely, to certain symmetrical  figures of geometry, which though invisible to the sight and not  consciously present in the mind of the beholder, yet perform the  important function of cooerdinating the entire fabric into one easily  remembered whole. Upon some such principle is surely founded what  Symonds calls \"that severe and lofty art of composition which seeks  the highest beauty of design in architectural harmony supreme, above  the melodies of gracefulness of detail.\"    [Illustration 65: THE EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE IN ITALIAN ARCHITECTURE]    [Illustration 66: THE HEXAGRAM IN GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE]    There is abundant evidence in support of the theory that the  builders of antiquity, the masonic guilds of the Middle Ages, and  the architects of the Italian Renaissance, knew and followed certain  rules, but though this theory be denied or even disproved--if after  all these men obtained their results unconsciously--their creations  so lend themselves to a geometrical analysis that the claim for the  existence of certain canons of proportion, based on geometry, remains  unimpeached.    [Illustration 67]    [Illustration 68]    The plane figures principally employed in determining architectural  proportion are the circle, the equilateral triangle, and the  square--which also yields the right angled isosceles triangle. It  will be noted that these are the two dimensional correlatives of the  sphere, the tetrahedron and the cube, mentioned as being among the  determining forms in molecular structure. The question naturally  arises, why the circle, the equilateral triangle and the square?  Because, aside from the fact that they are of all plane figures the  most elementary, they are intimately related to the body of man, as  has been shown (Illustration 45), and the body of man is as it were  the architectural archetype. But this simply removes the inquiry to  a different field, it is not an answer. Why is the body of man so  constructed and related? This leads us, as does every question, to  the threshold of a mystery upon which theosophy alone is able to throw  light. Any extended elucidation would be out of place here: it is  sufficient to remind the reader that the circle is the symbol of the  universe; the equilateral triangle, of the higher trinity (_atma,  buddhi, manas_); and the square, of the lower quaternary of man's  sevenfold nature.    [Illustration 69]    [Illustration 70]    The square is principally used in preliminary plotting: it is the  determining figure in many of the palaces of the Italian Renaissance;  the Arc de Triomphe, in Paris is a modern example of its use  (Illustrations 59, 60). The circle is often employed in conjunction  with the square and the triangle. In Thomas Jefferson's Rotunda for  the University of Virginia, a single great circle was the determining  figure, as his original pen sketch of the building shows (Illustration  61). Some of the best Roman triumphal arches submit themselves to a  circular synopsis, and a system of double intersecting circles has  been applied, with interesting results, to facades as widely different  as those of the Parthenon and the Farnese Palace in Rome, though  it would be fatuous to claim that these figures determined the  proportions of the facades.    By far the most important figure in architectural proportion,  considered from the standpoint of geometry, is the equilateral  triangle. It would seem that the eye has an especial fondness for  this figure, just as the ear has for certain related sounds. Indeed it  might not be too fanciful to assert that the common chord of any key  (the tonic with its third and fifth) is the musical equivalent of  the equilateral triangle. It is scarcely necessary to dwell upon  the properties and unique perfection of this figure. Of all regular  polygons it is the simplest: its three equal sides subtend equal  angles, each of 60 degrees; it trisects the circumference of a circle;  it is the graphic symbol of the number three, and hence of every  threefold thing; doubled, its generating arcs form the _vesica  piscis_, of so frequent occurrence in early Christian art; two  symmetrically intersecting equilateral triangles yield the figure  known as \"Solomon's Seal,\" or the \"Shield of David,\" to which mystic  properties have always been ascribed.    It may be stated as a general rule that whenever three important  points in any architectural composition coincide (approximately or  exactly) with the three extremities of an equilateral triangle, it  makes for beauty of proportion. An ancient and notable example occurs  in the pyramids of Egypt, the sides of which, in their original  condition, are believed to have been equilateral triangles. It is a  demonstrable fact that certain geometrical intersections yield the  important proportions of Greek architecture. The perfect little  Erechtheum would seem to have been proportioned by means of the  equilateral triangle and the angle of 60 degrees, both in general and  in detail (Illustration 62). The same angle, erected from the central  axis of a column at the point where it intersects the architrave,  determines both the projection of the cornice and the height of  the architrave in many of the finest Greek and Roman"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1265"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#11)"],[1,"him beauty and brains; the unexpected death of an  elder brother brought him wealth, a peerage, and the possibility of  high advancement. Within that charmed circle, whatever one's personal  disabilities, it was difficult to fail; and to him, with all his  advantages, success was well-nigh unavoidable. With little effort, he  attained political eminence. On the triumph of the Whigs he became one  of the leading members of the Government; and when Lord Grey retired  from the premiership he quietly stepped into the vacant place. Nor was  it only in the visible signs of fortune that Fate had been kind to him.  Bound to succeed, and to succeed easily, he was gifted with so fine  a nature that his success became him. His mind, at once supple and  copious, his temperament, at once calm and sensitive, enabled him not  merely to work, but to live with perfect facility and with the grace of  strength. In society he was a notable talker, a captivating companion,  a charming man. If one looked deeper, one saw at once that he was not  ordinary, that the piquancies of his conversation and his manner--his  free-and-easy vaguenesses, his abrupt questions, his lollings and  loungings, his innumerable oaths--were something more than an amusing  ornament, were the outward manifestation of an individuality that was  fundamental.    The precise nature of this individuality was very difficult to gauge: it  was dubious, complex, perhaps self--contradictory. Certainly there was  an ironical discordance between the inner history of the man and his  apparent fortunes. He owed all he had to his birth, and his birth was  shameful; it was known well enough that his mother had passionately  loved Lord Egremont, and that Lord Melbourne was not his father. His  marriage, which had seemed to be the crown of his youthful ardours,  was a long, miserable, desperate failure: the incredible Lady Caroline,  \"With pleasures too refined to please, With too much spirit to be  e'er at ease, With too much quickness to be ever taught, With too much  thinking to have common thought,\" was very nearly the destruction of  his life. When at last he emerged from the anguish and confusion of her  folly, her extravagance, her rage, her despair, and her devotion, he was  left alone with endless memories of intermingled farce and tragedy, and  an only son, who was an imbecile. But there was something else that he  owed to Lady Caroline. While she whirled with Byron in a hectic frenzy  of love and fashion, he had stayed at home in an indulgence bordering  on cynicism, and occupied his solitude with reading. It was thus that he  had acquired those habits of study, that love of learning, and that wide  and accurate knowledge of ancient and modern literature, which formed so  unexpected a part of his mental equipment. His passion for reading never  deserted him; even when he was Prime Minister he found time to  master every new important book. With an incongruousness that was  characteristic, his favourite study was theology. An accomplished  classical scholar, he was deeply read in the Fathers of the Church;  heavy volumes of commentary and exegesis he examined with scrupulous  diligence; and at any odd moment he might be found turning over the  pages of the Bible. To the ladies whom he most liked, he would lend some  learned work on the Revelation, crammed with marginal notes in his own  hand, or Dr. Lardner's \"Observations upon the Jewish Errors with respect  to the Conversion of Mary Magdalene.\" The more pious among them had high  hopes that these studies would lead him into the right way; but of this  there were no symptoms in his after-dinner conversations.    The paradox of his political career was no less curious. By temperament  an aristocrat, by conviction a conservative, he came to power as the  leader of the popular party, the party of change. He had profoundly  disliked the Reform Bill, which he had only accepted at last as  a necessary evil; and the Reform Bill lay at the root of the very  existence, of the very meaning, of his government. He was far too  sceptical to believe in progress of any kind. Things were best as they  were or rather, they were least bad. \"You'd better try to do no good,\"  was one of his dictums, \"and then you'll get into no scrapes.\" Education  at best was futile; education of the poor was positively dangerous. The  factory children? \"Oh, if you'd only have the goodness to leave them  alone!\" Free Trade was a delusion; the ballot was nonsense; and there  was no such thing as a democracy.    Nevertheless, he was not a reactionary; he was simply an opportunist.  The whole duty of government, he said, was \"to prevent crime and to  preserve contracts.\" All one could really hope to do was to carry on. He  himself carried on in a remarkable manner--with perpetual compromises,  with fluctuations and contradictions, with every kind of weakness, and  yet with shrewdness, with gentleness, even with conscientiousness, and  a light and airy mastery of men and of events. He conducted the  transactions of business with extraordinary nonchalance. Important  persons, ushered up for some grave interview, found him in a  towselled bed, littered with books and papers, or vaguely shaving in a  dressing-room; but, when they went downstairs again, they would realise  that somehow or other they had been pumped. When he had to receive a  deputation, he could hardly ever do so with becoming gravity. The worthy  delegates of the tallow-chandlers, or the Society for the Abolition of  Capital Punishment, were distressed and mortified when, in the midst of  their speeches, the Prime Minister became absorbed in blowing a feather,  or suddenly cracked an unseemly joke. How could they have guessed that  he had spent the night before diligently getting up the details of their  case? He hated patronage and the making of appointments--a feeling rare  in Ministers. \"As for the Bishops,\" he burst out, \"I positively believe  they die to vex me.\" But when at last the appointment was made, it  was made with keen discrimination. His colleagues observed another  symptom--was it of his irresponsibility or his wisdom? He went to sleep  in the Cabinet.    Probably, if he had been born a little earlier, he would have been a  simpler and a happier man. As it was, he was a child of the eighteenth  century whose lot was cast in a new, difficult, unsympathetic age.  He was an autumn rose. With all his gracious amenity, his humour, his  happy-go-lucky ways, a deep disquietude possessed him. A sentimental  cynic, a sceptical believer, he was restless and melancholy at heart.  Above all, he could never harden himself; those sensitive petals  shivered in every wind. Whatever else he might be, one thing was  certain: Lord Melbourne was always human, supremely human--too human,  perhaps.    And now, with old age upon him, his life took a sudden, new,  extraordinary turn. He became, in the twinkling of an eye, the intimate  adviser and the daily companion of a young girl who had stepped all at  once from a nursery to a throne. His relations with women had been, like  everything else about him, ambiguous. Nobody had ever been able quite  to gauge the shifting, emotional complexities of his married life; Lady  Caroline vanished; but his peculiar susceptibilities remained. Female  society of some kind or other was necessary to him, and he did not  stint himself; a great part of every day was invariably spent in it. The  feminine element in him made it easy, made it natural and inevitable for  him to be the friend of a great many women; but the masculine element  in him was strong as well. In such circumstances it is also easy, it is  even natural, perhaps it is even inevitable, to be something more than  a friend. There were rumours and combustions. Lord Melbourne was twice a  co-respondent in a divorce action; but on each occasion he won his suit.  The lovely Lady Brandon, the unhappy and brilliant Mrs. Norton... the  law exonerated them both. Beyond that hung an impenetrable veil. But  at any rate it was clear that, with such a record, the Prime Minister's  position in Buckingham Palace must be a highly delicate one. However,  he was used to delicacies, and he met the situation with consummate  success. His behaviour was from the first moment impeccable. His manner  towards the young Queen mingled, with perfect facility, the watchfulness  and the respect of a statesman and a courtier with the tender solicitude  of a parent. He was at once reverential and affectionate, at once the  servant and the guide. At the same time the habits of his life underwent  a surprising change. His comfortable, unpunctual days became subject to  the unaltering routine of a palace; no longer did he sprawl on sofas;  not a single \"damn\" escaped his lips. The man of the world who had been  the friend of Byron and the regent, the talker whose paradoxes had held  Holland House enthralled, the cynic whose ribaldries had enlivened so  many deep potations, the lover whose soft words had captivated such  beauty and such passion and such wit, might now be seen, evening after  evening, talking with infinite politeness to a schoolgirl, bolt upright,  amid the silence and the rigidity of Court etiquette.    IV    On her side, Victoria was instantaneously fascinated by Lord Melbourne.  The good report of Stockmar had no doubt prepared the way; Lehzen was  wisely propitiated; and the first highly favourable impression was never  afterwards belied. She found him perfect; and perfect in her sight he  remained. Her absolute and unconcealed adoration was very natural; what  innocent young creature could have resisted, in any circumstances, the  charm and the devotion of such a man? But, in her situation, there was  a special influence which gave a peculiar glow to all she felt. After  years of emptiness and dullness and suppression, she had come suddenly,  in the heyday of youth, into freedom and power. She was"]]]
