On such evidence, October 12, 1669, the jury being called to give in  their verdict upon the indictment of Katherine Harrison, returned that  they find the prisoner guilty of the indictment.    But meanwhile important things in the history of the case had come to  pass. Serious doubts arose in the minds of the magistrates as to  accepting the verdict, and in their dilemma they took counsel not only  of the law but of the gospel, and presented a series of questions to  certain ministers--the same expedient adopted by the court at Salem  twenty-three years later.    The answer of the ministers is in the handwriting of Rev. Gershom  Bulkeley of Wethersfield, the author of the unique treatise _Will and  Doom_. It was a remarkable paper as to preternatural apparitions, the  character of evidence for conviction, and its cautions as to its  acceptance. It was this:    \"The answer of some ministers to the questions pr-pounded to them by  the Honored Magistrates, Octobr 20, 1669. To ye 1st Quest whether a  plurality of witnesses be necessary, legally to evidence one and ye same  individual fact? Wee answer.\"    \"That if the proofe of the fact do depend wholly upon testimony, there  is then a necessity of a plurality of witnesses, to testify to one & ye  same individual fact; & without such a plurality, there can be no legall  evidence of it. Jno 8, 17. The testimony of two men is true; that is  legally true, or the truth of order. & this Cht alledges to vindicate ye  sufficiency of the testimony given to prove that individual facte, that  he himselfe was ye Messias or Light of the World. Mat. 26, 59, 60.\"    \"To the 2nd quest. Whether the preternatural apparitions of a person  legally proved, be a demonstration of familiarity with ye devill? Wee  anser, that it is not the pleasure of ye Most High, to suffer the wicked  one to make an undistinguishable representation of any innocent person  in a way of doing mischiefe, before a plurality of witnesses. The reason  is because, this would utterly evacuate all human testimony; no man  could testify, that he saw this pson do this or that thing, for it might  be said, that it was ye devill in his shape.\"    \"To the 3d & 4th quests together: Whether a vitious pson foretelling  some future event, or revealing of a secret, be a demonstration of  familiarity with the devill? Wee say thus much.\"    \"That those things, whither past, present or to come, which are indeed  secret, that is, cannot be knowne by human skill in arts, or strength of  reason arguing from ye corse of nature, nor are made knowne by divine  revelation either mediate or immediate, nor by information from man,  must needes be knowne (if at all) by information from ye devill: & hence  the comunication of such things, in way of divination (the pson  prtending the certaine knowledge of them) seemes to us, to argue  familiarity with ye devill, in as much as such a pson doth thereby  declare his receiving the devills testimony, & yeeld up himselfe as ye  devills instrument to comunicate the same to others.\"    And meanwhile Katherine herself had not been idle even in durance. With  a dignity becoming such a communication, and in a desperate hope that  justice and mercy might be meted out to her, she addressed a petition to  the court setting forth with unconscious pathos some of the wrongs and  sufferings she had endured in person and estate; and one may well  understand why under such great provocation she told Michael Griswold  that he would hang her though he damned a thousand souls, and as for his  own soul it was damned long ago. Vigorous and emphatic words, for which  perhaps Katherine was punished enough, as she was adjudged to pay  Michael in two actions for slander, L25 and costs in one and L15 and  costs in the other.    This was Katherine's appeal:    Filed: Wid. Harrisons greuances presented to the court 6th of Octobr  1669.    \"A complaint of severall greiuances of the widow Harrisons which she  desires the honored court to take cognizance of and as far as maybe to  give her reliefe in.\"    \"May it please this honored court, to have patience with mee a little:  having none to complain to but the Fathers of the Commonweale; and yet  meetting with many injurys, which necessitate mee to look out for some  releeife. I am told to present you with these few lines, as a relation  of the wrongs that I suffer, humbly crauing your serious consideration  of my state a widdow; of my wrongs, (wch I conceive are great) and that  as far as the rules of justice and equitie will allow, I may have right  and a due recompence.\"    \"That that I would present to you in the first place is we had a yoke of  oxen one of wch spoyled at our stile before our doore, with blows upon  the backe and side, so bruised that he was altogether unserviceable;  about a fortnight or three weeks after the former, we had a cow spoyled,  her back broke and two of her ribs, nextly I had a heifer in my barne  yard, my ear mark of wch was cutt out and other ear marks set on;  nextly I had a sow that had young pigs ear marked (in the stie) after  the same manner; nextly I had a cow at the side of my yard, her jaw bone  broke and one of her hoofs and a hole bored in her side, nextly I had a  three yeare old heifer in the meadow stuck with knife or some weapon and  wounded to death; nextly I had a cow in the street wounded in the bag as  she stood before my door, in the street, nextly I had a sow went out  into the woods, came home with ears luged and one of her hind legs cutt  offe, lastly my corne in Mile Meadow much damnified with horses, they  being staked upon it; it was wheat; All wch injurys, as they do sauor of  enemy so I hope they will be looked upon by this honored court according  to their natuer and judged according to there demerit, that so your poor  suppliant may find some redrese; who is bold to subscribe.\"    \"Your servant and supplyant,  \"KATHERINE HARRISON.    \"Postscript. I had my horse wounded in the night, as he was in my  pasture no creature save thre calves with him: More I had one two yeare  old steer the back of it broke, in the barne yard, more I had a matter  of 30 poles of hops cutt and spoyled; all wch things have hapened since  my husband death, wch was last August was two yeare.

Being under  suspicion of witchcraft, her presence was unwelcome to the inhabitants  there and complaint was made to Governor Lovelace. She gave security for  her civil carriage and good behavior, and at the General Court of  Assizes held in New York in October, 1670, in the case of Katherine  Harrison, widow, who was bound to the good behavior upon complaint of  some of the inhabitants of Westchester, it was ordered, \"that in regard  there is nothing appears against her deserving the continuance of that  obligation she is to be released from it, & hath liberty to remain in  the town of Westchester where she now resides, or anywhere else in the  government during her pleasure.\"          CHAPTER VII    \"Although our fathers cannot be charged with having regarded the Devil  in his respectful and deferential light, it must be acknowledged, that  they gave him a conspicuous and distinguished--we might almost say a  dignified--agency in the affairs of life and the government of the  world: they were prone to confess, if not to revere, his presence, in  all scenes and at all times. He occupied a wide space, not merely in  their theology and philosophy, but in their daily and familiar  thoughts.\" UPHAM'S _Salem Witchcraft_.    \"There are in every community those who for one cause or another  unfortunately incur the dislike and suspicion of the neighbors, and when  belief in witchcraft prevailed such persons were easily believed to have  familiarity with the evil one.\" _A Case of Witchcraft in Hartford_  (Connecticut Magazine, November, 1899), HOADLEY.      Witchcraft in the Connecticut towns reached its climax in 1692--the  fateful year at Salem, Massachusetts--and the chief center of its  activity was in the border settlements at Fairfield. There, several  women early in the year were accused of the crime, and among them Mercy  Disborough. The testimonies against her were unique, and yet so typical  that they are given in part as the second illustration.      MERCY (DISBRO) DISBOROUGH    A special court, presided over by Robert Treat, Governor, was held at  Fairfield by order of the General Court, to try the witch cases, and  September 14, 1692, a true bill was exhibited against Mercy Disborough,  wife of Thomas Disborough of Compo in Fairfield, in these words:    \"Mercy Disborough is complayned of & accused as guilty of witchcraft for  that on the 25t of Aprill 1692 & in the 4th year of their Maties reigne  & at sundry other times she hath by the instigation & help of the diuill  in a preternaturall way afflicted & don harme to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12293"],[0,"Old Cookery Books and Ancient Cuisine (#11)"],[1,"for a reward (though not by way of  merit) in the world to come.    \"As the whole of this collection has cost me much pains and a thirty  years' diligent application, and I have had experience of their use  and efficacy, I hope they will be as kindly accepted, as by me they  are generously offered to the publick: and if they prove to the  advantage of many, the end will be answered that is proposed by her  that is ready to serve the publick in what she may.\"          COOKERY BOOKS.    PART II.    SELECT EXTRACTS FROM AN EARLY RECEIPT-BOOK.      The earliest school of English Cookery, which had such a marked  Anglo-Norman complexion, has been familiarised to us by the  publication of Warner's _Antiquitates Culinaricae_, 1791, and more  recently by the appearance of the \"Noble Book of Cookery\" in Mrs.  Napier's edition, not to mention other aids in the same way, which are  accessible; and it seemed to be doing a better service, when it became  a question of selecting a few specimens of old receipts, to resort  to the representative of a type of culinary philosophy and sentiment  somewhere midway between those which have been rendered easy of  reference and our own. I have therefore given in the few following  pages, in a classified shape, some of the highly curious contents of  E. Smith's \"Compleat Housewife,\" 1736, which maybe securely taken to  exhibit the state of knowledge in England upon this subject in the  last quarter of the seventeenth century and first quarter of the  succeeding one. In the work itself no attempt at arrangement is  offered.      I.--MEAT, POULTRY, ETC.    _To make Dutch-beef_:--Take the lean part of a buttock of beef raw;  rub it well with brown sugar all over, and let it lie in a pan or tray  two or three hours, turning it three or four times; then salt it well  with common salt and salt-petre, and let it lie a fortnight, turning  it every day; then roll it very strait in a coarse cloth, and put it  in a cheese-press a day and a night, and hang it to dry in a chimney.  When you boil it, you must put it in a cloth: when 'tis cold, it will  cut out into shivers as Dutch-beef.    _To dry Mutton to cut out in Shivers as Dutch-Beef_:--Take a middling  leg of mutton, then take half a pound of brown sugar, and rub it hard  all over your mutton, and let it lie twenty-four hours; then take an  ounce and half of saltpetre, and mix it with a pound of common salt,  and rub that all over the mutton every other day, till 'tis all on,  and let it lie nine days longer; keep the place free from brine, then  hang it up to dry three days, then smoke it in a chimney where wood is  burnt; the fire must not be too hot; a fortnight will dry it. Boil  it like other hams, and when 'tis cold, cut it out in shivers like  Dutch-beef.    _To stuff a Shoulder or Leg of Mutton with Oysters_:--Take a little  grated bread, some beef-suet, yolks of hard eggs, three anchovies,  a bit of an onion, salt and pepper, thyme and winter-savoury, twelve  oysters, some nutmeg grated; mix all these together, and shred them  very fine, and work them up with raw eggs like a paste, and stuff your  mutton under the skin in the thickest place, or where you please, and  roast it; and for sauce take some of the oyster-liquor, some claret,  two or three anchovies, a little nutmeg, a bit of an onion, the rest  of the oysters: stew all these together, then take out the onion, and  put it under the mutton.    _To marinade a Leg of Lamb_:--Take a leg of lamb, cut it in pieces the  bigness of a half-crown; hack them with the back of a knife; then take  an eschalot, three or four anchovies, some cloves, mace, nutmeg, all  beaten; put your meat in a dish, and strew the seasoning over it, and  put it in a stew-pan, with as much white-wine as will cover it, and  let it be two hours; then put it all together in a frying-pan, and let  it be half enough; then take it out and drain it through a colander,  saving the liquor, and put to your liquor a little pepper and salt,  and half a pint of gravy; dip your meat in yolks of eggs, and fry it  brown in butter; thicken up your sauce with yolks of eggs and  butter, and pour it in the dish with your meat: lay sweet-breads and  forc'd-meat balls over your meat; dip them in eggs, and fry them.  Garnish with lemon.    _A Leg of Mutton a-la-Daube_:--Lard your meat with bacon through, but  slant-way; half roast it; take it off the spit, and put it in a small  pot as will boil it; two quarts of strong broth, a pint of white-wine,  some vinegar, whole spice, bay-leaves, green onions, savoury,  sweet-marjoram; when 'tis stew'd enough, make sauce of some of the  liquor, mushrooms, lemon cut like dice, two or three anchovies:  thicken it with browned butter. Garnish with lemon.    _To fry Cucumbers for Mutton Sauce_:--You must brown some butter in a  pan, and cut the cucumbers in thin slices; drain them from the water,  then fling them into the pan, and when they are fried brown, put in a  little pepper and salt, a bit of an onion and gravy, and let them stew  together, and squeeze in some juice of lemon; shake them well, and put  them under your mutton.    _To make Pockets_:--Cut three slices out of a leg of veal, the length  of a finger, the breadth of three fingers, the thickness of a thumb,  with a sharp penknife; give it a slit through the middle, leaving the  bottom and each side whole, the thickness of a straw; then lard the  top with small fine lards of bacon; then make a forc'd-meat of marrow,  sweet-breads, and lamb-stones just boiled, and make it up after 'tis  seasoned and beaten together with the yolks of two eggs, and put it  into your pockets as if you were filling a pincushion; then sew up the  top with fine thread, flour them, and put melted butter on them, and  bake them; roast three sweet-breads to put between, and serve them  with gravy-sauce.    _To make a Florendine of Veal_:--Take the kidney of a loin of veal,  fat and all, and mince it very fine; then chop a few herbs, and put to  it, and add a few currants; season it with cloves, mace, nutmeg, and  a little salt; and put in some yolks of eggs, and a handful of grated  bread, a pippin or two chopt, some candied lemon-peel minced small,  some sack, sugar, and orange-flower-water. Put a sheet of puff-paste  at the bottom of your dish; put this in, and cover it with another;  close it up, and when 'tis baked, scrape sugar on it; and serve it  hot.    _To make a Tureiner_:--Take a china pot or bowl, and fill it as  follows: at the bottom lay some fresh butter; then put in three or  four beef-steaks larded with bacon; then cut some veal-steaks from  the leg; hack them, and wash them over with the yolk of an egg, and  afterwards lay it over with forc'd-meat, and roll it up, and lay it  in with young chickens, pigeons and rabbets, some in quarters, some in  halves; sweet-breads, lamb-stones, cocks-combs, palates after they  are boiled, peeled, and cut in slices: tongues, either hogs or  calves, sliced, and some larded with bacon: whole yolks of hard eggs,  pistachia-nuts peeled, forced balls, some round, some like an olive,  lemon sliced, some with the rind on, barberries and oysters: season  all these with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and sweet-herbs, mix'd together  after they are cut very small, and strew it on every thing as you put  it in your pot: then put in a quart of gravy, and some butter on the  top, and cover it close with a lid of puff-paste, pretty thick. Eight  hours will bake it.    _To make Hams of Pork like Westphalia_:--To two large hams, or three  small ones, take three pounds of common salt, and two pounds and half  of brown coarse sugar; mix both together, and rub it well into the  hams, and let them lie seven days, turning them every day, and rub the  salt in them, when you turn them; then take four ounces of salt-petre  beat small, and mix with two handfuls of common salt, and rub that  well in your hams, and let them lie a fortnight longer: then hang them  up high in a chimney to smoke.    _To make a Ragoo of Pigs-Ears_:--Take a quantity of pigs-ears, and  boil them in one half wine and the other water; cut them in small  pieces, then brown a little butter, and put them in, and a pretty deal  of gravy, two anchovies, an eschalot or two, a little mustard, and  some slices of lemon, some salt, and nutmeg; stew all these together,  and shake it up thick. Garnish the dish with barberries.    _To collar a Pig_:--Cut off the head of your pig; then cut the body  asunder; bone it, and cut two collars off each side; then lay it in  water to take out the blood; then take sage and parsley, and shred  them very small, and mix them with pepper, salt, and nutmeg, and strew  some on every side, or collar, and roll it up, and tye it with coarse  tape; so boil them in fair water and salt, till they are very tender:  put two or three blades of mace in the kettle, and when they are  enough, take them up, and lay them in something to cool; strain out  some of the liquor, and add to it some vinegar and salt, a little  white-wine, and three or four bay-leaves; give it a boil up, and when  'tis cold put it to the collars, and keep them for use.    _A Fricasy of Double Tripe_:--Cut your tripe in slices, two inches  long, and put it into a stew-pan; put to it a quarter of a pound of  capers, as much samphire shred, half a pint of strong broth, as much  white-wine, a bunch of sweet-herbs, a lemon shred small; stew all  these together till 'tis tender; then take it off the fire, and  thicken up the liquor with the yolks of three or four eggs, a little  parsley boiled green and chopp'd, some grated nutmeg and salt; shake  it well together. Serve it on sippets. Garnish with lemon.    _To pot a Swan_:--Bone and skin your swan, and beat the flesh in a  mortar, taking out the strings as you beat it; then take some clear  fat bacon, and beat with the swan, and when 'tis of a light flesh  colour, there is bacon enough in it; and when 'tis beaten till 'tis"]]]
