These engines are magnificent samples of the most powerful express engines  of the present day.    The London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company has in the last few  years had its locomotive stock almost entirely replaced, and instead of  seventy-two different varieties of engines out of a total of 233, which  was the state of locomotive stock in 1871. a small number of  well-considered types, suited to the different class of work required, are  now in use. Mr. Stroudley considers--contrary to the opinion once almost  universally held--that engines with a high center of gravity are the  safest to traverse curves at high speed, as the centrifugal force throws  the greatest weight on the outer wheels, and prevents their mounting; also  that the greatest weight should be on the leading wheels, and that there  is no objection to these wheels being of a much larger diameter than that  usually adopted; in fact, by coupling the leading and driving wheels where  the main weight is placed a lighter load is thrown on the trailing wheels,  thus enabling them to traverse curves at a high speed with safety, while  it permits of a larger fire-box being used; and these principles have been  carried out in the newest class of engines, especially designed for  working the heavy fast passenger traffic of the line.    The modern express engines are of two types. The first is a single engine  with 6 ft. 6 in. driving wheels, and leading and trailing wheels 4 ft. 6  in. in diameter and a wheel base of 15 ft. 9 in. The frames are single,  with inside bearings to all the wheels; the cylinders are inside, 17 in.  diameter and 24 in. stroke. The boiler is 10 ft. 2 in. long and 4 ft. 3  in. diameter; the fire-box is of copper with a fire-grate area of 17.8  square feet, and the heating surface is in the tubes 1,080 square feet,  fire-box 102 square feet; total, 1182 square feet. The weight in working  order is about 35 tons. These engines have a tractive power of 89 lb. per  pound of mean steam pressure in the cylinders, and their consumption of  coal with trains averaging nine coaches is about 20 lb. per mile. The next  type of engine designed has coupled wheels under the barrel of the boiler  6 ft. 6 in. diameter, with cylinders 171/4 in. diameter and 26 in. stroke,  and were found so successful that Mr. Stroudley designed a more powerful  engine of the same class, especially to take the heaviest fast trains in  all weathers.    The 8:45 A.M. train from Brighton has grown to be one of the heaviest fast  trains in the kingdom, although the distance it runs is but very short,  while it is also exceptional in consisting entirely of first class  coaches, and the passengers mainly season ticket holders; it often weighs  in the gross 350 tons, and to take this weight at a mean speed of  forty-five to fifty miles an hour over gradients of 1 in 264 is no light  work.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--LONDON, BRIGHTON, AND SOUTH COAST RAILWAY.]    The engines known as the \"Gladstone\" type have inside cylinders 181/4 in.  diameter and 26 in. stroke, with coupled wheels 6 ft. 6 in. diameter under  the barrel of the boiler; the trailing wheels are 4 ft. 6 in. diameter,  and the total wheel base is 15 ft. 7 in. The frames are inside, of steel 1  in. thick, with inside bearings to all the axles. The cylinders are cast  in one piece 2 ft. 1 in. apart, but in order to get them so close together  the valves are placed below the cylinders, the leading axle coming between  the piston and slide valve. The boiler is of iron, 10 ft. 2 in. long, and  4 ft. 6 in. diameter; and the heating surface is, in the tubes, 1,373  square feet; fire-box, 112 square feet; total, 1,485 square feet. The  grate area is 20.65 square feet, and the tractive power per pound of mean  cylinder pressure is 111 lb. The weight in full working order is--leading  wheels, 13 tons 16 cwt.; driving wheels, 14 tons 10 cwt.; trailing wheels,  10 tons 8 cwt.; total, 38 tons 14 cwt. The tender weighs 27 tons.    To enable these engines to traverse curves easily a special arrangement of  draw-bar is used, consisting of a T-piece with a wheel at each end working  in a curved path in the back of the frame under the foot plate; on the  back buffer beam a curved plate abuts against a rubbing piece on the  tender, through which the draw-bar is passed and screwed up against an  India-rubber washer, thus allowing the engine to move free of the tender  as the curvature of the road road requires; the flanges on the driving  wheel are also cut away, so as not to touch the rail. In order to reduce  the wear of the leading flanges, a jet of steam from the exhaust is  directed against the outer side of each wheel. The center line of the  boiler is 7 ft. 5 in. above the rails, and the tubes, of which there are  as many as 331, are bent upward 11/2 in., which permits expansion and  contraction to take place without starting the tubes, and they are stated  never to leak or give trouble. The feed-water is heated by a portion of  the exhaust steam and the exhaust from the Westinghouse brake, and the  boiler is consequently fed by pumps, is kept cleaner, and makes steam  better. The reversing gear is automatic and exceedingly ingenious, the  compressed air from the Westinghouse brake reservoir being employed to do  the heavy work. A cylinder 41/2 in. diameter is fitted with a piston and  rod attached to the nut of the reversing screw, and a three-way cock  supplies the compressed air behind the piston; this forces the engine into  back gear, and by allowing the air to escape, the weight of the valve  motion puts the engine in forward gear. There are no balance weights, and  the screw regulates the movement. There is also a very ingenious speed  indicator, which consists of a small brass case filled with water, in  which is a small fan driven by a cord from the driving wheel; a copper  pipe leads from the fan case to a glass gauge tube; the faster the fan  runs the higher the water will stand in the tube, thus indicating the  speed.    The author has been led to describe this engine fully on account of the  numerous ingenious appliances which have been adopted in its design. In a  trial trip on October 3, 1883, from Brighton to London Bridge and back,  with an average load of 191/2 coaches, or 285 tons gross, and with a speed  of 45 miles per hour, the consumption of coal was 31 lb. per train mile,  evaporating 8.45 lb. of water per pound of coal, and with as much as 1,100  indicated horse-power at one portion of the run. The finish and painting  of these engines is well considered, but the large coupled wheels give a  very high shouldered appearance, and as a type they are not nearly as  handsome as the single engines previously described.    From the Brighton to the South-Western Railway is but a step; but here a  totally different practice obtains to that adopted on most lines, all the  passenger engines having outside cylinders, where they are more exposed to  damage in case of accident, and, from being less protected, there is more  condensation of steam, while the width between the cylinders tends to make  an unsteady running engine at high speeds, unless the balancing is  perfect; but the costly crank axle, with its risk of fracture, is avoided,  and the center of gravity of the boiler may be consequently lowered, while  larger cylinders may be employed. On the other hand, inside cylinders are  well secured, protected, and kept hot in the smoke-box, thus minimizing  the condensation of steam. The steam ports are short, and the engine runs  steadier at high speeds, while with Joy's valve gear much larger cylinders  can be got in than with the link motion. Thus modern improvements have  minimized the advantages of the outside class.    The passenger engines for the fast traffic are of two types, the six-wheel  engines with 7 ft. coupled wheels, and the new bogie engines which are  being built to replace them. The former have 17 in. cylinders with 22 in.  stroke, and a pair of coupled wheels 7 ft. in diameter, the leading wheels  being 4 ft. diameter, and the wheel base 14 ft. 3 in. The grate area is  16.1 square feet, and the heating surface 1,141 square feet. The total  weight in working order is 33 tons. The chief peculiarity of this type of  engine consists in the boiler, which is fitted with a combustion chamber  stocked with perforated bricks, the tubes being only 5 ft. 4 in. long.  These engines are very expensive to build and maintain, owing to the  complicated character of the boiler and fire-box, but as a coal burning  engine there is no doubt the class was very efficient, but no more are  being built, and a new type has been substituted. This is an outside  cylinder bogie engine, with cylinders 181/2 in. diameter and 26 in. stroke;  the driving and trailing coupled wheels are 6 ft. 6 in. diameter, and the  bogie wheels 3 ft. 3 in. The wheel base to the center of the bogie pin is  18 ft. 6 in.; the heating surface is, in the tubes, 1,112; fire box, 104;  total, 1,216 sq. ft. The weight of the engine in working order is 42 tons.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--MIDLAND RAILWAY.]    The Midland Railway route to the North is distinguished by the heavy  nature of its gradients; between Settle and Carlisle, running through the  Cumberland hills, attaining a height of 1,170 ft. above sea level, the  highest point of any express route in the kingdom; and to work heavy fast  traffic over such a line necessitates the employment of coupled engines.  The standard express locomotive of this company has inside cylinders 18  in. in diameter and 26 in. stroke. The coupled wheels are 6 ft. 9 in.  diameter,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11649"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 799, April 25, 1891 (#11)"],[1," construction. All the parts must be larger and  heavier. The fly wheels are increased enormously in diameter and weight,  and the strength of bearings must be enlarged in proportion. It is  difficult to equalize power and resistance in air compressors with long  strokes. The speed will be jerky, and when slow, the fly wheel rather  retards than assists in the work of compression. This action tends to  derange the parts and makes large bearings a necessity. The piston in a  long-stroke compressor travels through considerable space before the  pressure reaches a point where the discharge valve opens, and after  reaching that point it has to go on still further against a prolonged  uniform resistance. This makes rotative speed difficult. During the  early part of the stroke, the energy of the steam piston must be stored  up in the moving parts, to be given out when the steam pressure has been  reduced through an early cut-off. With a short stroke and a large  diameter of steam cylinder we are able to get steam economy or early  cut-off and expansion without the complications of compounding.           *       *       *       *       *    [Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 793, page 12677.]          THE POWER OF WATER, OR HYDRAULICS SIMPLIFIED.    By G.D. Hiscox.    CURRENT WHEELS FOR POWER AND RAISING WATER.      The natural flow of water in a current is probably one of the oldest and  cheapest of the methods for obtaining power, or the lifting of water  within moderate elevations, for a supply for irrigation and domestic  purposes; and we propose, apart from the current wheel, to treat only of  self-water-raising devices in this chapter.    Water wheels of various forms for this purpose have been used from time  immemorial in Europe, Asia and Egypt, where the record gives examples of  wheels of the noria class from 30 to 90 feet in diameter; the term  _noria_ having been applied to water wheels carrying buckets for raising  water; the Spanish _noria_ having buckets on an endless chain.    Records of a Chinese noria, of 30 feet diameter, made of bamboo, show a  lifting capacity of 300 tons of water per day to a height of 3/4 of the  diameter of the wheel--velocity of current not stated.    For less quantity and greater elevation, these forms of wheel may have  pumps attached to the shaft, by crank, that will give a fair duty for a  high water supply.    For power purposes, as in the plain current wheel, Fig. 23, there are  two principal factors in the problem of power--the velocity of the  current and the area of the buckets or blades.    [Illustration: Fig. 23]    Their efficiency is very low, from 25 to 36 per cent., according to  their lightness of make and form of buckets. A slightly curved plate  iron bucket gives the highest efficiency, thus ( to the current, and an  additional value may also be given by slightly shrouding the ends of the  buckets.    The relative velocity of the periphery of the wheel to the velocity of  the current should be 50 per cent. with curved blades for best effect.    The most useful and convenient sizes for power purposes are from 10 to  20 feet, and from 2 to 20 feet wide, although, as before stated, there  is scarcely a limit under 100 feet diameter for special purposes.    In designing this class of wheels special attention should be given to  the concentration and increase of the velocity of the current by wing  dams or by the narrowing of shallow streams; always bearing in mind that  any increase in the velocity of the current is economy in increased  power, as well as in the size and cost of a wheel for a given power.    The blades in the smaller size wheels should be 1/4 of the radius in  width, and for the larger sizes up to 20 feet, 1/5 to 1/6 of the radius  in width and spaced equal to from 1/4 to 1/3 of the radius.    They should be completely submerged at the lowest point.    For obtaining the horse power of a current wheel, the formula is    Area of 1 blade x velocity of the current in ft. per sec.  ----------------------------------------------------------                            400    x by the square of difference of velocities of current and wheel  periphery = the horse power; or      A x V            2    ------  x (V - v)  = h. p.     400    [TEX: \\frac{A \\times V}{400} \\times (V - v)^2 = h. p.]    in which A equals the area of blade in square feet, V and v velocities  of current and wheel periphery respectively, in feet per second. Thus,  for example, a wheel 10 feet in diameter with blades 6 feet long and 1  foot in width, running in a stream of 5 feet per second--assuming the  wheel to be giving as much power as will reduce its velocity to one half  that of the stream--the figures will be      6' x 5'       2    -------  x 2.5  = 0.468      400    [TEX: \\frac{6' \\times 5'}{400} \\times 2.5^2 = 0.468]    horse power of the wheel.    The total power of the stream due to the area of the blade equals the      Square of the velocity of the stream    ------------------------------------ x           Twice gravity (64.33)    volume of water in cubic feet per second x 62.5 (weight of 1 C') = the  value or gross effect in pounds falling 1 foot per second. This sum  divided by 550 = horse power. Thus, as per last example,         2      5    ------ x 30 x 62.5    64.33    ----------------------  = 1.32 the horse power of the current             550    [TEX: \\frac{\\frac{5^2}{64.33} \\times 30 \\times 62.5}{550} = 1.32 \\text{  the horse power of the current}]    due to the area of the blades of the water wheel.    For the efficiency of this class of wheel, with slightly curved and thin  blades, divide the horse power of the wheel by the horse power of the  current area, equals the percentage of efficiency.    As in the last case,      0.468 /  1.32 = 0.351/2    per cent. efficiency of the water wheel.    With higher velocities of stream and wheel the efficiency will be from 2  to 3 per cent. less, although the horse power will increase nearly with  the increase in velocity of the current.    For details of application of various forms of current wheels for power  purposes see illustrated description Yagn's and Roman's floating motors  in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT, No. 463.    A very good example of a floating motor of the propeller class is  Nossian's fluviatile motor, illustrated and described in SCIENTIFIC  AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT, No. 656.    [Illustration: Fig. 24.]    Fig. 24 represents a very complete floating motor, in which the floats  are wedge shaped at the stem, for the purpose of increasing the current  between them, the wheel being an ordinary current wheel, as shown in  Fig. 23, with a curved shield or gate in front, which can be moved  around the periphery of the wheel for the purpose of regulating its  speed or stopping its motion by cutting off the stream from the buckets.    The float, rising and falling with the stream, is held in position by a  braced frame swinging on anchorages within the mill on shore, and  parallel with a swiveled shaft.    Tide wheels and tidal current wheels have been in use for more than 800  years, and were largely in use in Europe and the United States during  the first half of the present century. No less than three were running  in the immediate vicinity of New York, in 1840, for milling purposes.    Their day seems to be past, except in some special localities. We will  also pass them, and illustrate some of the      SELF-ACTING WATER-RAISING DEVICES.    The tympanum derives its name from its similarity to a drum as made by  the Romans, but its origin was Egyptian. It is a current wheel with  frame like Fig. 23, to the outside of which a set of chambers or tubes  are fixed, radiating spirally, so as to lead the water to the shaft as  the wheel revolves, as shown in Fig. 25. It has a lift of a little less  than half its diameter, and answers an excellent purpose for the  irrigation of rice and cranberry fields, or on streams running through  low lands in arid districts. It is still one of the Nile irrigating  wheels.    [Illustration: Fig. 25]    The building of these wheels is within the scope of the carpenter and  the tinsmith. A short wooden shaft made square or octagonal, as  convenient, with gudgeons in the ends and arms of wood bolted across  each of the sides of the shaft, or as shown in the cut, will form a  frame work upon which a rim may be fastened, to which the blades and  tubular buckets can be attached.    The directions in regard to the current wheel, Fig. 23, may be followed  as to number and form of blades, which must be made in length and width  proportional to the velocity of the stream and the quantity of water to  be lifted by each tubular arm. The tubes may be made of galvanized sheet  iron and attached to the outside of the wheel, as shown in Fig. 25.      THE NORIA OR BUCKET WHEEL.    This is a simple current wheel with pot buckets, rigid or swinging,  arranged on the rim of the wheel, to carry up and discharge the water  nearly at the top of the wheel, and through the long ages that it has  been in use for irrigation, village water supply, and even for private  establishments, has assumed a variety of forms in detail of construction  ranging from the bamboo wheels of the Chinese to the light iron wheels  of modern construction.    We illustrate the most simple of these forms in Figs. 26 and 27, in  which the first is a series of boxes or chambers in the rim of the wheel  with side openings in the forward part of the box as the wheel revolves,  and a lip extending from the inner edge of the opening to direct the  outflow into the trough.    [Illustration: Fig. 26.]    Another form, Fig. 27, is arranged with swing buckets or pots, pivoted  just above their centers, and with the catch trough so fixed as to tip  the buckets at the highest point, thus giving this wheel the greatest  possible advantage as to height of discharge for a given diameter.
