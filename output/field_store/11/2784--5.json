TURN O LIBERTAD.        Turn O Libertad, for the war is over,    From it and all henceforth expanding, doubting no more, resolute,              sweeping the world,    Turn from lands retrospective recording proofs of the past,    From the singers that sing the trailing glories of the past,    From the chants of the feudal world, the triumphs of kings, slavery,              caste,    Turn to the world, the triumphs reserv'd and to come--give up that              backward world,    Leave to the singers of hitherto, give them the trailing past,    But what remains remains for singers for you--wars to come are for              you,    (Lo, how the wars of the past have duly inured to you, and the wars              of the present also inure;)    Then turn, and be not alarm'd O Libertad--turn your undying face,    To where the future, greater than all the past,    Is swiftly, surely preparing for you.

During his learned leisure at Spannheim, he wrote several works upon  the occult sciences, the chief of which are an essay on geomancy, or  divination by means of lines and circles on the ground; another upon  sorcery; a third upon alchymy; and a fourth upon the government of the  world by its presiding angels, which was translated into English, and  published by the famous William Lilly in 1647.    It has been alleged by the believers in the possibility of  transmutation, that the prosperity of the abbey of Spannheim, while  under his superintendence, was owing more to the philosopher's stone  than to wise economy. Trithemius, in common with many other learned men,  has been accused of magic; and a marvellous story is told of his having  raised from the grave the form of Mary of Burgundy, at the intercession  of her widowed husband, the Emperor Maximilian. His work on  steganographia, or cabalistic writing, was denounced to the Count  Palatine, Frederic II, as magical and devilish; and it was by him taken  from the shelves of his library and thrown into the fire. Trithemius is  said to be the first writer who makes mention of the wonderful story  of the devil and Dr. Faustus, the truth of which he firmly believed. He  also recounts the freaks of a spirit, named Hudekin, by whom he was at  times tormented. [Biographie Universelle]      THE MARECHAL DE RAYS.    One of the greatest encouragers of alchymy in the fifteenth century  was Gilles de Laval, Lord of Rays and a Marshal of France. His name and  deeds are little known; but in the annals of crime and folly, they might  claim the highest and worst pro-eminence. Fiction has never invented  anything wilder or more horrible than his career; and were not the  details but too well authenticated by legal and other documents which  admit no doubt, the lover of romance might easily imagine they were  drawn to please him from the stores of the prolific brain, and not from  the page of history.    He was born about the year 1420, of one of the noblest families of  Brittany. His father dying when Gilles had attained his twentieth year,  he came into uncontrolled possession, at that early age, of a fortune  which the monarchs of France might have envied him. He was a near  kinsman of the Montmorencys, the Roncys, and the Craons; possessed  fifteen princely domains, and had an annual revenue of about three  hundred thousand livres. Besides this, he was handsome, learned, and  brave. He distinguished himself greatly in the wars of Charles VII, and  was rewarded by that monarch with the dignity of a marshal of France.  But he was extravagant and magnificent in his style of living, and  accustomed from his earliest years to the gratification of every wish  and passion; and this, at last, led him from vice to vice, and from  crime to crime, till a blacker name than his is not to be found in any  record of human iniquity.    In his castle of Champtoce, he lived with all the splendour of an  Eastern Caliph. He kept up a troop of two hundred horsemen to accompany  him wherever he went; and his excursions for the purposes of hawking and  hunting were the wonder of all the country around, so magnificent were  the caparisons of his steeds and the dresses of his retainers. Day and  night, his castle was open all the year round to comers of every degree.  He made it a rule to regale even the poorest beggar with wine and  hippocrass. Every day an ox was roasted whole in his spacious kitchens,  besides sheep, pigs, and poultry sufficient to feed five hundred  persons. He was equally magnificent in his devotions. His private chapel  at Champtoce was the most beautiful in France, and far surpassed any  of those in the richly-endowed cathedrals of Notre Dame in Paris, of  Amiens, of Beauvais, or of Rouen. It was hung with cloth of gold and  rich velvet. All the chandeliers were of pure gold, curiously inlaid  with silver. The great crucifix over the altar was of solid silver, and  the chalices and incense-burners were of pure gold. He had, besides, a  fine organ, which he caused to be carried from one castle to another, on  the shoulders of six men, whenever he changed his residence. He kept up  a choir of twenty-five young children of both sexes, who were instructed  in singing by the first musicians of the day. The master of his chapel  he called a bishop, who had under him his deans, archdeacons, and  vicars, each receiving great salaries; the bishop four hundred crowns a  year, and the rest in proportion.    He also maintained a whole troop of players, including ten dancing-girls  and as many ballad-singers, besides morris-dancers, jugglers, and  mountebanks of every description. The theatre on which they performed  was fitted up without any regard to expense; and they played mysteries,  or danced the morris-dance, every evening, for the amusement of  himself and household, and such strangers as were sharing his prodigal  hospitality.    At the age of twenty-three, he married Catherine, the wealthy heiress of  the house of Touars, for whom he refurnished his castle at an expense  of a hundred thousand crowns. His marriage was the signal for new  extravagance, and he launched out more madly than ever he had done  before; sending for fine singers or celebrated dancers from foreign  countries to amuse him and his spouse, and instituting tilts and  tournaments in his great court-yard almost every week for all the  knights and nobles of the province of Brittany. The Duke of Brittany's  court was not half so splendid as that of the Marechal de Rays. His  utter disregard of wealth was so well known that he was made to pay  three times its value for everything he purchased. His castle was filled  with needy parasites and panderers to his pleasures, amongst whom he  lavished rewards with an unsparing hand. But the ordinary round of  sensual gratification ceased at last to afford him delight: he was  observed to be more abstemious in the pleasures of the table, and to  neglect the beauteous dancing-girls who used formerly to occupy so much  of his attention. He was sometimes gloomy and reserved; and there was  an unnatural wildness in his eye which gave indications of incipient  madness. Still, his discourse was as reasonable as ever; his urbanity  to the guests that flocked from far and near to Champtoce suffered no  diminution; and learned priests, when they conversed with him, thought  to themselves that few of the nobles of France were so well-informed  as Gilles de Laval. But dark rumours spread gradually over the country;  murder, and, if possible, still more atrocious deeds were hinted at;  and it was remarked that many young children, of both sexes, suddenly  disappeared, and were never afterwards heard of. One or two had been  traced to the castle of Champtoce, and had never been seen to leave it;  but no one dared to accuse openly so powerful a man as the Marechal de  Rays. Whenever the subject of the lost children was mentioned in his  presence, he manifested the greatest astonishment at the mystery which  involved their fate, and indignation against those who might be guilty  of kidnapping them. Still the world was not wholly deceived; his name  became as formidable to young children as that of the devouring ogre in  fairy tales; and they were taught to go miles round, rather than pass  under the turrets of Champtoce.    In the course of a very few years, the reckless extravagance of the  Marshal drained him of all his funds, and he was obliged to put up some  of his estates for sale. The Duke of Brittany entered into a treaty  with him for the valuable seignory of Ingrande; but the heirs of Gilles  implored the interference of Charles VII. to stay the sale. Charles  immediately issued an edict, which was confirmed by the Provincial  Parliament of Brittany, forbidding him to alienate his paternal estates.  Gilles had no alternative but to submit. He had nothing to support his  extravagance but his allowance as a Marshal of France, which did not  cover the one-tenth of his expenses. A man of his habits and character  could not retrench his wasteful expenditure and live reasonably;  he could not dismiss without a pang his horsemen, his jesters, his  morris-dancers, his choristers, and his parasites, or confine his  hospitality to those who really needed it. Notwithstanding his  diminished resources, he resolved to live as he had lived before, and  turn alchymist, that he might make gold out of iron, and be still the  wealthiest and most magnificent among the nobles of Brittany.    In pursuance of this determination he sent to Paris, Italy, Germany, and  Spain, inviting all the adepts in the science to visit him at Champtoce.  The messengers he despatched on this mission were two of his most needy  and unprincipled dependants, Gilles de Sille and Roger de Bricqueville.  The latter, the obsequious panderer to his most secret and abominable  pleasures, he had intrusted with the education of his motherless  daughter, a child but five years of age, with permission, that he might  marry her at the proper time to any person he chose, or to himself if he  liked it better. This man entered into the new plans of his master with  great zeal, and introduced to him one Prelati, an alchymist of Padua,  and a physician of Poitou, who was addicted to the same pursuits. The  Marshal caused a splendid laboratory to be fitted up for them, and the  three commenced the search for the philosopher's stone. They were soon  afterwards joined by another pretended philosopher, named Anthony of  Palermo, who aided in their operations for upwards of a year. They all  fared sumptuously at the Marshal's expense, draining him of the ready  money he possessed, and leading him on from day to day with the hope  that they would succeed in the object of their search. From time to time  new aspirants from the remotest parts of Europe arrived at his castle, "]]]
