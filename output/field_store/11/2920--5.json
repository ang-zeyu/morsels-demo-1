[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1261"],[0,"Betty Zane (#11)"],[1,"was  the unconscious awakening of the heart.    One afternoon, near the end of Betty's siege indoors, two of her  friends, Lydia Boggs and Alice Reynolds, called to see her.    Alice had bright blue eyes, and her nut brown hair hung in  rebellious curls around her demure and pretty face. An adorable  dimple lay hidden in her rosy cheek and flashed into light with her  smiles.    \"Betty, you are a lazy thing!\" exclaimed Lydia. \"Lying here all day  long doing nothing but gaze out of the window.\"    \"Girls, I am glad you came over,\" said Betty. \"I am blue. Perhaps  you will cheer me up.\"    \"Betty needs some one of the sterner sex to cheer her,\" said Alice,  mischievously, her eyes twinkling. \"Don't you think so, Lydia?\"    \"Of course,\" answered Lydia. \"When I get blue--\"    \"Please spare me,\" interrupted Betty, holding up her hands in  protest. \"I have not a single doubt that your masculine remedies are  sufficient for all your ills. Girls who have lost their interest in  the old pleasures, who spend their spare time in making linen and  quilts, and who have sunk their very personalities in a great big  tyrant of a man, are not liable to get blue. They are afraid he may  see a tear or a frown. But thank goodness, I have not yet reached  that stage.\"    \"Oh, Betty Zane! Just you wait! Wait!\" exclaimed Lydia, shaking her  finger at Betty. \"Your turn is coming. When it does do not expect  any mercy from us, for you shalt never get it.\"    \"Unfortunately, you and Alice have monopolized the attentions of the  only two eligible young men at the fort,\" said Betty, with a laugh.    \"Nonsense there plenty of young men all eager for our favor, you  little coquette,\" answered Lydia. \"Harry Martin, Will Metzer,  Captain Swearengen, of Short Creek, and others too numerous to  count. Look at Lew Wetzel and Billy Bennet.\"    \"Lew cares for nothing except hunting Indians and Billy's only a  boy,\" said Betty.    \"Well, have it your own way,\" said Lydia. \"Only this, I know Billy  adores you, for he told me so, and a better lad never lived.\"    \"Lyde, you forget to include one other among those prostrate before  Betty's charms,\" said Alice.    \"Oh, yes, you mean Mr. Clarke. To be sure, I had forgotten him,\"  answered Lydia. \"How odd that he should be the one to find you the  day you hurt your foot. Was it an accident?\"    \"Of course. I slipped off the bank,\" said Betty.    \"No, no. I don't mean that. Was his finding you an accident?\"    \"Do you imagine I waylaid Mr. Clarke, and then sprained my ankle on  purpose?\" said Betty, who began to look dangerous.    \"Certainly not that; only it seems so odd that he should be the one  to rescue all the damsels in distress. Day before yesterday he  stopped a runaway horse, and saved Nell Metzer who was in the wagon,  a severe shaking up, if not something more serious. She is  desperately in love with him. She told me Mr. Clarke--\"    \"I really do not care to hear about it,\" interrupted Betty.    \"But, Betty, tell us. Wasn't it dreadful, his carrying you?\" asked  Alice, with a sly glance at Betty. \"You know you are so--so prudish,  one may say. Did he take you in his arms? It must have been very  embarrassing for you, considering your dislike of Mr. Clarke, and  he so much in love with--\"    \"You hateful girls,\" cried Betty, throwing a pillow at Alice, who  just managed to dodge it. \"I wish you would go home.\"    \"Never mind, Betty. We will not tease anymore,\" said Lydia, putting  her arm around Betty. \"Come, Alice, we will tell Betty you have  named the day for your wedding. See! She is all eyes now.\"               * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *    The young people of the frontier settlements were usually married  before they were twenty. This was owing to the fact that there was  little distinction of rank and family pride. The object of the  pioneers in moving West was, of course, to better their condition;  but, the realization of their dependence on one another, the common  cause of their labors, and the terrible dangers to which they were  continually exposed, brought them together as one large family.    Therefore, early love affairs were encouraged--not frowned upon as  they are to-day--and they usually resulted in early marriages.    However, do not let it be imagined that the path of the youthful  swain was strewn with flowers. Courting or \"sparking\" his sweetheart  had a painful as well as a joyous side. Many and varied were the  tricks played on the fortunate lover by the gallants who had vied  with him for the favor of the maid. Brave, indeed, he who won her.  If he marched up to her home in the early evening he was made the  object of innumerable jests, even the young lady's family indulging  in and enjoying the banter. Later, when he come out of the door, it  was more than likely that, if it were winter, he would be met by a  volley of water soaked snowballs, or big buckets of icewater, or a  mountain of snow shoved off the roof by some trickster, who had  waited patiently for such an opportunity. On summer nights his horse  would be stolen, led far into the woods and tied, or the wheels of  his wagon would be taken off and hidden, leaving him to walk home.  Usually the successful lover, and especially if he lived at a  distance, would make his way only once a week and then late at night  to the home of his betrothed. Silently, like a thief in the dark, he  would crawl through the grass and shrubs until beneath her window.  At a low signal, prearranged between them, she would slip to the  door and let him in without disturbing the parents. Fearing to make  a light, and perhaps welcoming that excuse to enjoy the darkness  beloved by sweethearts, they would sit quietly, whispering low,  until the brightening in the east betokened the break of day, and  then he was off, happy and lighthearted, to his labors.    A wedding was looked forward to with much pleasure by old and young.  Practically, it meant the only gathering of the settlers which was  not accompanied by the work of reaping the harvest, building a  cabin, planning an expedition to relieve some distant settlement, or  a defense for themselves. For all, it meant a rollicking good time;  to the old people a feast, and the looking on at the merriment of  their children--to the young folk, a pleasing break in the monotony  of their busy lives, a day given up to fun and gossip, a day of  romance, a wedding, and best of all, a dance. Therefore Alice  Reynold's wedding proved a great event to the inhabitants of Fort  Henry.    The day dawned bright and clear. The sun, rising like a ball of red  gold, cast its yellow beams over the bare, brown hills, shining on  the cabin roofs white with frost, and making the delicate weblike  coat of ice on the river sparkle as if it had been sprinkled with  powdered diamonds. William Martin, the groom, and his attendants,  met at an appointed time to celebrate an old time-honored custom  which always took place before the party started for the house of  the bride. This performance was called \"the race for the bottle.\"    A number of young men, selected by the groom, were asked to take  part in this race, which was to be run over as rough and dangerous a  track as could be found. The worse the road, the more ditches, bogs,  trees, stumps, brush, in fact, the more obstacles of every kind, the  better, as all these afforded opportunity for daring and expert  horsemanship. The English fox race, now famous on three continents,  while it involves risk and is sometimes dangerous, cannot, in the  sense of hazard to life and limb, be compared to this race for the  bottle.    On this day the run was not less exciting than usual. The horses  were placed as nearly abreast as possible and the starter gave an  Indian yell. Then followed the cracking of whips, the furious  pounding of heavy hoofs, the commands of the contestants, and the  yells of the onlookers. Away they went at a mad pace down the road.  The course extended a mile straight away down the creek bottom. The  first hundred yards the horses were bunched. At the ditch beyond the  creek bridge a beautiful, clean limbed animal darted from among the  furiously galloping horses and sailed over the deep furrow like a  bird. All recognized the rider as Alfred Clarke on his black  thoroughbred. Close behind was George Martin mounted on a large roan  of powerful frame and long stride. Through the willows they dashed,  over logs and brush heaps, up the little ridges of rising ground,  and down the shallow gullies, unheeding the stinging branches and  the splashing water. Half the distance covered and Alfred turned, to  find the roan close behind. On a level road he would have laughed at  the attempt of that horse to keep up with his racer, but he was  beginning to fear that the strong limbed stallion deserved his  reputation. Directly before them rose a pile of logs and matted  brush, placed there by the daredevil settlers who had mapped out the  route. It was too high for any horse to be put at. With pale cheek  and clinched teeth Alfred touched the spurs to Roger and then threw  himself forward. The gallant beast responded nobly. Up, up, up he  rose, clearing all but the topmost branches. Alfred turned again and  saw the giant roan make the leap without touching a twig. The next  instant Roger went splash into a swamp. He sank to his knees in the  soft black soil. He could move but one foot at a time, and Alfred  saw at a glance he had won the race. The great weight of the roan  handicapped him here. When Alfred reached the other side of the bog,  where the bottle was swinging from a branch of a tree, his rival's  horse was floundering hopelessly in the middle of the treacherous  mire. The remaining three horsemen, who had come up by this time,  seeing that it would be useless to attempt further efforts, had  drawn up on the bank. With friendly shouts to Clarke, they  acknowledged themselves beaten. There were no judges required for  this "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1262"],[0,"The Heritage of the Desert: A Novel (#11)"],[1," I know. You see this point commands the farm, the crossing,  the Navajo Trail over the river, the Echo Cliffs opposite, where the  Navajos signal to me, and also the White Sage Trail.\"    The oasis shone under the triangular promontory; the river with its  rising roar wound in bold curve from the split in the cliffs. To the  right white-sloped Coconina breasted the horizon. Forward across the  Canyon line opened the many-hued desert.    \"With this peon watching here I'm not likely to be surprised,\" said  Naab. \"That strip of sand protects me at night from approach, and I've  never had anything to fear from across the river.\"    Naab's peon came from a little cave in the wall; and grinned the  greeting he could not speak. To Hare's uneducated eye all Indians  resembled each other. Yet this one stood apart from the others, not  differing in blanketed leanness, or straggling black hair, or bronze  skin, but in the bird-of-prey cast of his features and the wildness of  his glittering eyes. Naab gave him a bag from one of the packs, spoke a  few words in Navajo, and then slapped the burros into the trail.    The climb thenceforth was more rapid because less steep, and the trail  now led among broken fragments of cliff. The color of the stones had  changed from red to yellow, and small cedars grew in protected places.  Hare's judgment of height had such frequent cause for correction that he  gave up trying to estimate the altitude. The ride had begun to tell on  his strength, and toward the end he thought he could not manage to stay  longer upon Noddle. The air had grown thin and cold, and though the sun  was yet an hour high, his fingers were numb.    \"Hang on, Jack,\" cheered August. \"We're almost up.\"    At last Black Bolly disappeared, likewise the bobbing burros, one by  one, then Noddle, wagging his ears, reached a level. Then Hare saw a  gray-green cedar forest, with yellow crags rising in the background, and  a rush of cold wind smote his face. For a moment he choked; he could not  get his breath. The air was thin and rare, and he inhaled deeply trying  to overcome the suffocation. Presently he realized that the trouble was  not with the rarity of the atmosphere, but with the bitter-sweet  penetrating odor it carried. He was almost stifled. It was not like the  smell of pine, though it made him think of pine-trees.    \"Ha! that's good!\" said Naab, expanding his great chest. \"That's air for  you, my lad. Can you taste it? Well, here's camp, your home for many a  day, Jack. There's Piute--how do? how're the sheep?\"    A short, squat Indian, good-humored of face, shook his black head till  the silver rings danced in his ears, and replied: \"Bad--damn coyotee!\"    \"Piute--shake with Jack. Him shoot coyote--got big gun,\" said Naab.    \"How-do-Jack?\" replied Piute, extending his hand, and then straightway  began examining the new rifle. \"Damn--heap big gun!\"    \"Jack, you'll find this Indian one you can trust, for all he's a Piute  outcast,\" went on August. \"I've had him with me ever since Mescal found  him on the Coconina Trail five years ago. What Piute doesn't know about  this side of Coconina isn't worth learning.\"    In a depression sheltered from the wind lay the camp. A fire burned in  the centre; a conical tent, like a tepee in shape, hung suspended from a  cedar branch and was staked at its four points; a leaning slab of rock  furnished shelter for camp supplies and for the Indian, and at one end a  spring gushed out. A gray-sheathed cedar-tree marked the entrance to  this hollow glade, and under it August began preparing Hare's bed.    \"Here's the place you're to sleep, rain or shine or snow,\" he said. \"Now  I've spent my life sleeping on the ground, and mother earth makes the  best bed. I'll dig out a little pit in this soft mat of needles; that's  for your hips. Then the tarpaulin so; a blanket so. Now the other  blankets. Your feet must be a little higher than your head; you really  sleep down hill, which breaks the wind. So you never catch cold. All you  need do is to change your position according to the direction of the  wind. Pull up the blankets, and then the long end of the tarpaulin. If  it rains or snows cover your head, and sleep, my lad, sleep to the song  of the wind!\"    From where Hare lay, resting a weary body, he could see down into the  depression which his position guarded. Naab built up the fire; Piute  peeled potatoes with deliberate care; Mescal, on her knees, her brown  arms bare, kneaded dough in a basin; Wolf crouched on the ground, and  watched his mistress; Black Bolly tossed her head, elevating the bag on  her nose so as to get all the grain.    Naab called him to supper, and when Hare set to with a will on the bacon  and eggs, and hot biscuits, he nodded approvingly. \"That's what I want  to see,\" he said approvingly. \"You must eat. Piute will get deer, or you  may shoot them yourself; eat all the venison you can. Remember what  Scarbreast said. Then rest. That's the secret. If you eat and rest you  will gain strength.\"    The edge of the wall was not a hundred paces from the camp; and when  Hare strolled out to it after supper, the sun had dipped the under side  of its red disc behind the desert. He watched it sink, while the golden-  red flood of light grew darker and darker. Thought seemed remote from  him then; he watched, and watched, until he saw the last spark of fire  die from the snow-slopes of Coconina. The desert became dimmer and  dimmer; the oasis lost its outline in a bottomless purple pit, except  for a faint light, like a star.    The bleating of sheep aroused him and he returned to camp. The fire was  still bright. Wolf slept close to Mescal's tent; Piute was not in sight;  and Naab had rolled himself in blankets. Crawling into his bed, Hare  stretched aching legs and lay still, as if he would never move again.  Tired as he was, the bleating of the sheep, the clear ring of the bell  on Black Bolly, and the faint tinkle of lighter bells on some of the  rams, drove away sleep for a while. Accompanied by the sough of the wind  through the cedars the music of the bells was sweet, and he listened  till he heard no more.    A thin coating of frost crackled on his bed when he awakened; and out  from under the shelter of the cedar all the ground was hoar-white. As he  slipped from his blankets the same strong smell of black sage and  juniper smote him, almost like a blow. His nostrils seemed glued  together by some rich piny pitch; and when he opened his lips to breathe  a sudden pain, as of a knife-thrust, pierced his lungs. The thought  following was as sharp as the pain. Pneumonia! What he had long  expected! He sank against the cedar, overcome by the shock. But he  rallied presently, for with the reestablishment of the old settled  bitterness, which had been forgotten in the interest of his situation,  he remembered that he had given up hope. Still, he could not get back at  once to his former resignation. He hated to acknowledge that the  wildness of this desert canyon country, and the spirit it sought to  instil in him, had wakened a desire to live. For it meant only more to  give up. And after one short instant of battle he was himself again. He  put his hand under his flannel shirt and felt of the soreness of his  lungs. He found it not at the apex of the right lung, always the one  sensitive spot, but all through his breast. Little panting breaths did  not hurt; but the deep inhalation, which alone satisfied him filled his  whole chest with thousands of pricking needles. In the depth of his  breast was a hollow that burned.    When he had pulled on his boots and coat, and had washed himself in the  runway of the spring, his hands were so numb with cold they refused to  hold his comb and brush; and he presented himself at the roaring fire  half-frozen, dishevelled, trembling, but cheerful. He would not tell  Naab. If he had to die to-day, to-morrow or next week, he would lie down  under a cedar and die; he could not whine about it to this man.    \"Up with the sun!\" was Naab's greeting. His cheerfulness was as  impelling as his splendid virility. Following the wave of his hand Hare  saw the sun, a pale-pink globe through a misty blue, rising between the  golden crags of the eastern wall.    Mescal had a shy \"good-morning\" for him, and Piute a broad smile, and  familiar \"how-do\"; the peon slave, who had finished breakfast and was  about to depart, moved his lips in friendly greeting that had no sound.    \"Did you hear the coyotes last night?\" inquired August. \"No! Well, of  all the choruses I ever heard. There must be a thousand on the bench.  Jack, I wish I could spare the time to stay up here with you and shoot  some. You'll have practice with the rifle, but don't neglect the Colt.  Practice particularly the draw I taught you. Piute has a carbine, and he  shoots at the coyotes, but who ever saw an Indian that could hit  anything?\"    \"Damn--gun no good!\" growled Piute, who evidently understood English  pretty well. Naab laughed, and while Hare ate breakfast he talked of the  sheep. The flock he had numbered three thousand. They were a goodly part  of them Navajo stock: small, hardy sheep that could live on anything but  cactus, and needed little water. This flock had grown from a small  number to its present size in a few years. Being remarkably free from  the diseases and pests which retard increase in low countries, the sheep  had multiplied almost one for one for every year. But for the ravages of  wild beasts Naab believed he could raise a flock of many thousands and  in a brief time be rich in sheep alone. In the winter he drove them down  into the oasis; the other seasons he herded them on the high ranges  where the cattle could not climb. There was grass enough on this plateau  for a million sheep. After the spring thaw in early March, occasional  snows fell till the end of May, and frost hung on until early summer;  then the July rains made the"]]]
