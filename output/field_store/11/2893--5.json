The Duke  of Maine, despoiled of the command of the king's household, declared  that, under such conditions, it was impossible for him to be answerable  for the king's person, and that he \"demanded to be relieved of that  duty.\"  \"Most willingly, Sir,\" replied the Regent; \"your services are no  longer required;\" and he forthwith explained to the Parliament his  intention of governing affairs according to the plan which had been found  among the papers of the Duke of Burgundy.  \"Those gentry know little or  nothing of the French, and of the way to govern them,\" had been the  remark of Louis XIV. on reading the schemes of Fenelon, the Duke of  Beauvilliers, and St. Simon.  The Parliament applauded the formation of  the six councils of foreign affairs, of finance, of war, of the marine,  of home or the interior, of conscience or ecclesiastical affairs; the  Regent was intrusted with the free disposal of graces.  \"I want to be  free for good,\" said he, adroitly repeating a phrase from Telemaque, \"I  consent to have my hands tied for evil.\"    The victory was complete.  Not a shred remained of Louis XIV.'s will.  The Duke of Maine, confounded and humiliated, retired to his Castle of  Sceaux, there to endure the reproaches of his wife.  The king's affection  and Madame de Maintenon's clever tactics had not sufficed to found his  power; the remaining vestiges of his greatness were themselves about to  vanish before long in their turn.    [Illustration: The Bed of Justice----57]    On the 12th of September, the little king held a bed of justice; his  governess, Madame de Ventadour, sat alone at the feet of the poor orphan,  abandoned on the pinnacle of power.  All the decisions of September 2  were ratified in the child's name.  Louis XIV. had just descended to the  tomb without pomp and without regret.  The joy of the people broke out  indecently as the funeral train passed by; the nation had forgotten the  glory of the great king; it remembered only the evils which had for so  long oppressed it during his reign.    The new councils had already been constituted, when it was discovered  that commerce had been forgotten; and to it was assigned a seventh body.  \"Three sorts of men, the choice of whom was dictated by propriety,  weakness, and necessity, filled the lists: in the first place, great  lords, veterans in intrigue but novices in affairs, and less useful from  their influence than embarrassing from their pride and their pettinesses;  next, the Regent's friends, the cream of the rows, possessed with the  spirit of opposition and corruption, ignorant and clever, bold and lazy,  and far better calculated to harass than to conduct a government; lastly,  below them, were pitch-forked in, pell-mell, councillors of State,  masters of requests, members of Parliament, well-informed and industrious  gentlemen, fated henceforth to crawl about at the bottom of the  committees, and, without the spur of glory or emulation, to repair the  blunders which must be expected from the incapacity of the first and the  recklessness of the second class amongst their colleagues.\"  [Lemontey,  _Histoire de la Regence,_ t. i.  p. 67.]  \"It is necessary,\" the young  king was made to say in the preamble to the ordinance which established  the councils, \"that affairs should be regulated rather by unanimous  consent than by way of authority.\"    How singular are the monstrosities of experience!  At the head of the  council of finance, a place was found for the Duke of Noailles, active in  mind and restless in character, without any fixed principles, an adroit  and a shameless courtier, strict in all religious observances under Louis  XIV., and a notorious debauchee under the Regency, but intelligent,  insolent, ambitious, hungering and thirsting to do good if he could, but  evil if need were, and in order to arrive at his ends.  His uncle,  Cardinal Noailles, who had been but lately threatened by the court of  Rome with the loss of his hat, and who had seen himself forbidden to  approach the dying king, was now president of the council of conscience.  Marshal d'Huxelles, one of the negotiators who had managed the treaty of  Utrecht, was at the head of foreign affairs.  The Regent had reserved to  himself one single department, the Academy of Sciences.  \"I quite  intend,\" said he, gayly, \"to ask the king, on his majority, to let me  still be Secretary of State of the Academy.\"    The Regent's predilection, consolidating the work of Colbert, contributed  to the development of scientific researches, for which the neatness and  clearness of French thought rendered it thenceforth so singularly well  adapted.    The gates of the prison were meanwhile being thrown open to many a poor  creature; the Jansenists left the Bastille; others, who had been for a  long time past in confinement, were still ignorant of the grounds for  their captivity, which was by this time forgotten by everybody.  A  wretched Italian, who had been arrested the very day of his arrival in  Paris, thirty-five years before, begged to remain in prison; he had no  longer any family, or relatives, or resources.  For a while the  Protestants thought they saw their advantage in the clemency with which  the new reign appeared to be inaugurated, and began to meet again in  their assemblies; the Regent had some idea of doing them justice,  re-establishing the Edict of Nantes, and re-opening to the exiles the  doors of their country, but his councillors dissuaded him; the more  virtuous, like St. Simon, from Catholic piety, the more depraved from  policy and indifference.  However, the lot of the Protestants remained  under the Regency less hard than it had been under Louis XIV., and than  it became under the Duke of Bourbon.    The chancellor, Voysin, had just died.  To this post the Regent summoned  the attorney-general, D'Aguesseau, beloved and esteemed of all, learned,  eloquent, virtuous, but too exclusively a man of Parliament for the  functions which had been confided to him.  \"He would have made a sublime  premier president,\" said St. Simon, who did not like him.  The magistrate  was attending mass at St. Andre-des-Arts; he was not ignorant of the  chancellor's death, when a valet came in great haste to inform him that  the Regent wanted him at the Palais-Royal.  D'Aguesseau piously heard out  the remainder of the mass before obeying the prince's orders.  The casket  containing the seals was already upon the table.  The Duke of Orleans  took the attorney-general by the arm and, going out with him into the  gallery thronged with courtiers, said, \"Gentlemen, here is your new and  most worthy chancellor!\" and he took him away with him to the Tuileries,  to pay his respects to the little king.    On returning home, still all in a whirl, D'Aguesseau went up to the room  of his brother, \"M. de Valjouan, a sort of Epicurean (_voluptueux_)  philosopher, with plenty of wit and learning, but altogether one of the  oddest creatures.\"  He found him in his dressing-gown, smoking in front  of the fire.  \"Brother,\" said he, as he entered, \"I have come to tell you  that I am chancellor.\"  \"Chancellor!\" said the other, turning round; \"and  what have you done with the other one?\"  \"He died suddenly to-night.\"  \"O, very well, brother, I am very glad; I would rather it were you than  I;\" and he resumed his pipe.  Madame D'Aguesseau was better pleased.  Her  husband has eulogized her handsomely.  \"A wife like mine,\" he said, \"is a  good man's highest reward.\"    The new system of government, as yet untried, and confided to men for  the most part little accustomed to affairs, had to put up with the most  formidable difficulties, and to struggle against the most painful  position.  The treasury was empty, and the country exhausted; the army  was not paid, and the most honorable men, such as the Duke of St. Simon,  saw no other remedy for the evils of the state but a total bankruptcy,  and the convocation of the States-general.  Both expedients were equally  repugnant to the Duke of Orleans.  The Duke of Noailles had entered upon  a course of severe economy; the king's household was diminished, twenty-  five thousand men were struck off the strength of the army, exemption  from talliage for six years was promised to all such discharged soldiers  as should restore a deserted house, and should put into cultivation the  fields lying waste.  At the same time something was being taken off the  crushing weight of the taxes, and the state was assuming the charge of  recovering them directly, without any regard for the real or supposed  advances of the receivers-general; their accounts were submitted to the  revision of the brothers Paris, sons of an innkeeper in the Dauphinese  Alps, who had made fortunes by military contracts, and were all four  reputed to be very able in matters of finance.  They were likewise  commissioned to revise the bills circulating in the name of the state, in  other words, to suppress a great number without re-imbursement to the  holder, a sort of bankruptcy in disguise, which did not help to raise the  public credit.  At the same time also a chamber of justice, instituted  for that purpose, was prosecuting the tax-farmers (_traitants_), as Louis  XIV. had done at the commencement of his reign, during the suit against  Fouquet.  All were obliged to account for their acquisitions and the  state of their fortunes; the notaries were compelled to bring their books  before the court.  Several tax-farmers (_traitants_) killed themselves to  escape the violence and severity of the procedure.  The Parliament,  anything but favorable to the speculators, but still less disposed to  suffer its judicial privileges to be encroached upon, found fault with  the degrees of the Chamber.  The Regent's friends were eager to profit by  the reaction which was manifesting itself in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12014"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume IV.

After the Dr's. death, his  eldest son, who is now a clergyman, published three other Volumes of  his father's Sermons, each also consisting of 14, printed in London  1730, 8vo. Amongst his sermons there is one preached on St. Cecilia's  day, in vindication of Church-music, first printed in 1697, in 4to.      PSALM CIV.        1. Bless God my soul; thou, Lord alone,      Possessest empire without bounds:    With honour thou art crown'd, thy throne      Eternal Majesty surrounds.    2. With light thou dost thy self enrobe,      And glory for a garment take;    Heav'n's curtain stretch'd beyond the globe,      The canopy of state to make.      3. God builds on liquid air, and forms      His palace-chambers in the skies:    The clouds his chariots are, and storms      The swift-wing'd steeds with which he flies.    4. As bright as flame, as swift as wind      His ministers Heav'ns palace fill;    To have their sundry tasks assign'd,      All proud to serve their Sovereign's will.      5., 6. Earth on her center fix'd he set,      Her face with waters over spread;    Not proudest mountains dar'd as yet      To lift above the waves their head!    7. But when thy awful face appear'd,      Th' insulting waves dispers'd; they fled    When once thy thunder's voice they heard,      And by their haste confess'd their dread.      8. Thence up by secret tracts they creep,      And gushing from the mountain's side,    Thro' vallies travel to the deep;      Appointed to receive their tide.    9. There hast thou fix'd the ocean's mounds,      The threat'ning surges to repel:    That they no more o'erpass their bounds,      Nor to a second deluge swell.    PART II.      10. Yet, thence in smaller parties drawn,      The sea recovers her lost hills:    And starting springs from every lawn,      Surprize the vales with plenteous rills.    11. The fields tame beasts are thither led      Weary with labour, faint with drought,    And asses on wild mountains bred,      Have sense to find these currents out.      12. There shady trees from scorching beams,      Yield shelter to the feather'd throng:    They drink, and to the bounteous streams      Return the tribute of their song.    13. His rains from heav'n parch'd hills recruit,      That soon transmit the liquid store:    'Till earth is burthen'd with her fruit,      And nature's lap can hold no more.      14. Grass for our cattle to devour,      He makes the growth of every field:    Herbs, for man's use, of various pow'r,      That either food or physic yield.    15. With cluster'd grapes he crowns the vine      To cheer man's heart oppress'd with cares:    Gives oil that makes his face to shine.      And corn that wasted strength repairs.      PSALM CIV. imitated by THOMAS BLACKCLOCK.      Arise my soul! on wings seraphic rise!    And praise th' Almighty sov'reign of the skies!    In whom alone essential glory shines,    Which not the Heav'n of Heav'ns, nor boundless space confines!    When darkness rul'd with universal sway,    He spoke, and kindled up the blaze of day;    First fairest offspring of th' omnific word!    Which like a garment cloath'd it's sovereign lord.    He stretch'd the blue expanse, from pole to pole,    And spread circumfluent aether round the whole.    Of liquid air he bad the columns rise,    Which prop the starry concave of the skies.    Soon as he bids, impetuous whirlwinds fly,    To bear his sounding chariot thro' the sky:    Impetuous whirlwinds the command obey,    Sustain his flight, and sweep th' aerial way.    Fraught with his mandates from the realms on high,    Unnumber'd hosts of radiant heralds fly;    From orb to orb, with progress unconfin'd,    As lightn'ing swift, resistless as the wind.    His word in air this pondr'ous ball sustain'd.    \"Be fixt, he said.\"--And fix'd the ball remain'd.    Heav'n, air, and sea, tho' all their stores combine.    Shake not its base, nor break the law divine.    At thy almighty voice, old ocean raves,    Wakes all his force, and gathers all his waves;    Nature lies mantled in a watry robe,    And shoreless ocean roils around the globe;    O'er highest hills, the higher surges rise,    Mix with the clouds, and leave the vaulted skies.    But when in thunder, the rebuke was giv'n,    That shook th' eternal firmament of heav'n,    The dread rebuke, the frighted waves obey,    They fled, confus'd, along th' appointed way,    Impetuous rushing to the place decreed,    Climb the steep hill, and sweep the humble mead:    And now reluctant in their bounds subside;    Th' eternal bounds restrain the raging tide:    Yet still tumultuous with incessant roar,    It shakes the caverns, and assaults the shore.    By him, from mountains, cloth'd in livid snow,    Thro' verdant vales, the mazy fountains flow.    Here the wild horse, unconscious of the rein,    That revels boundless, o'er the wide champaign,    Imbibes the silver stream, with heat opprest    To cool the fervour of his glowing breast.    Here verdant boughs adorn'd with summer's pride,    Spread their broad shadows o'er the silver tide:    While, gently perching on the leafy spray,    Each feather'd songster tunes his various lay:    And while thy praise, they symphonize around,    Creation ecchoes to the grateful sound.    Wide o'er the heav'ns the various bow he bends.    Its tincture brightens, and its arch extends:    At the glad sign, aerial conduits flow,    The hills relent, the meads rejoice below:    By genial fervour, and prolific rain,    Gay vegetation cloaths the fertile plain;    Nature profusely good, with bliss o'er-flows,    And still she's pregnant, tho' she still bestows:    Here verdant pastures, far extended lie,    And yield the grazing herd a rich supply!    Luxuriant waving in the wanton air,    Here golden grain rewards the peasant's care!    Here vines mature, in purple clusters glow,    And heav'n above, diffuses heav'n below!    Erect and tall, here mountain cedars rise,    High o'er the clouds, and emulate the skies!    Here the winged crowds, that skim the air,    with artful toil, their little dams prepare,    Here, hatch their young, and nurse their rising care!    Up the steep-hill ascends the nimble doe,    While timid conies scour the plains below;    Or in the pendent rocks elude the scenting foe.    He bade the silver majesty of night,    Revolve her circle, and increase her light.    But if one moment thou thy face should'st hide,    Thy glory clouded, or thy smiles denied,    Then widow'd nature veils her mournful eyes,    And vents her grief, in universal cries!    Then gloomy death, with all his meagre train;    Wide o'er the nations spreads his iron reign!    Sea, earth, and air, the bounteous ravage mourn,    And all their hosts to native dust return!    Again thy glorious quickning influence shed,    The glad creation rears its drooping head:    New rising forms, thy potent smiles obey,    And life re-kindles at the genial ray;    United thanks replenish'd nature pays,    And heaven and earth resound their Maker's praise.        When time shall in eternity be lost,    And hoary nature languish into dust,    Forever young, thy glories shall remain,    Vast as thy being, endless as thy reign!    Thou from the realms of everlasting day,    See'st all thy works, at one immense survey!    Pleas'd at one view, the whole to comprehend,    Part join'd to part, concurring to one end.    If thou to earth, but turn'st thy wrathful eyes,    Her basis trembles, and her offspring dies.    Thou smit'st the hills, and at th' almighty blow,    Their summits kindle, and their entrails glow.    While this immortal spark of heav'nly flame,    Distends my breast, and animates my frame,    To thee my ardent praises shall be born,    On the first breeze, that wakes the blushing morn:    The latest star shall hear the pleasing sound,    And nature, in full choir shall join around!    When full of thee, my soul excursive flies,    Thro' earth, air, ocean or thy regal skies,    From world, to world, new wonders still I find!    And all the Godhead bursts upon my mind!    When, wing'd with whirlwinds, vice shall take her flight,    To the wide bosom of eternal night,    To thee my soul shall endless praises pay;    Join! men and angels! join th' exalted day!    Assign'd a province to each rolling sphere,    And taught the sun to regulate the year.    At his command wide hov'ring o'er the plain,    Primaeval night resumes her gloomy reign.    Then from their dens impatient of delay,    The savage monsters bend their speedy way,    Howl thro' the spacious waste and chase the frighted prey.    Here walks the shaggy monarch of the wood,    Taught from thy providence to ask his food:    To thee O Father! to thy bounteous skies,    He rears his main, and rolls his glaring eyes.    He roars, the desarts tremble wide around!    And repercusive hills repeat the sound.    Now purple gems, the eastern skies adorn,    And joyful nature hails th' opening morn;    The rovers conscious of approaching day,    Fly to their shelters, and forget their prey.    Laborious man, with moderate slumber blest,    Springs chearful to his toil, from downy rest;    Till grateful ev'ning with her silver train,    Bid labour cease, and ease the weary swain!    Hail, sovereign Goodness! All productive mind!    On all thy works, thyself inscribed we find!    How various all! how variously endow'd!    How great their number! and each part how good!    How perfect then must the great parent shine!    Who with one act of energy divine,    Laid the vast plan, and finish'd the design.    Where e'er the pleasing search my thoughts pursue,    Unbounded goodness opens to my view.    Nor does our world alone, its influence share;    Exhaustless bounty, and unwearied care,    Extend thro' all th' infinitude of space,"]]]
