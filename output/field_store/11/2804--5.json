All other pieces are, for this purpose,  comparatively hard and tough.    The round is generally corned or salted, and boiled. It is also  used for the dish called beef a-la-mode.    The legs make excellent soup; the head and tail are also used for  that purpose.    The tongue when fresh is never cooked except for mince-pies.  Corned or salted it is seldom liked, as in that state it has a  faint sickly taste that few persons can relish. But when pickled  and afterwards smoked (the only good way of preparing a tongue) it  is highly and deservedly esteemed.    The other pieces of the animal are generally salted and boiled. Or  when fresh they may be used for soup or stews, if not too fat.    If the state of the weather will allow you to keep fresh beef two  or three days, rub it with salt, and wrap it in a cloth.    In summer do not attempt to keep it more than twenty-four hours;  and not then unless you can conveniently lay it in ice, or in a  spring-house.    In winter if the beef is brought from market frozen, do not cook  it that day unless you dine very late, as it will be impossible to  get it sufficiently done--meat that has been frozen requiring  double the usual time. To thaw it, lay it in cold water, which is  the only way to extract the frost without injuring the meat. It  should remain in the water three hours, or more.      TO ROAST BEEF.    The fire should be prepared at least half an hour before the beef  is put down, and it should be large, steady, clear, and bright,  with plenty of fine hot coals at the bottom.    The best apparatus for the purpose is the well-known roaster  frequently called a tin-kitchen.    Wash the meat in cold water, and then wipe it dry, and rub it with  salt. Take care not to run the spit through the best parts of it.  It is customary with some cooks to tie blank paper over the fat,  to prevent it from melting and wasting too fast.    Put it evenly into the roaster, and do not set it too near the  fire, lest the outside of the meat should be burned before the  inside is heated.    Put some nice beef-dripping or some lard into the pan or bottom of  the roaster, and as soon as it melts begin to baste the beef with  it; taking up the liquid with a long spoon, and pouring it over  the meat so as to let it trickle down again, into the pan. Repeat  this frequently while it is roasting; after a while you can baste  it with its own fat. Turn the spit often, so that the meat may be  equally done on all sides.    Once or twice draw back the roaster, and improve the fire by  clearing away the ashes, bringing forward the hot coals, and  putting on fresh fuel at the back. Should a coal fall into the  dripping-pan take it out immediately. An allowance of about twenty  minutes to each pound of meat is the time commonly given for  roasting; but this rule, like most others, admits of exceptions  according to circumstances. Also, some persons like their meat  very much done; others prefer it rare, as it is called. In summer,  meat will roast in a shorter time than in winter.    When the beef is nearly done, and the steam draws towards the  fire, remove the paper that has covered the fat part, sprinkle on  a little salt, and having basted the meat well with the dripping,  pour off nicely (through the spout of the roaster) all the liquid  fat from the top of the gravy.    Lastly, dredge the meat very lightly with a little flour, and  baste it with fresh butter. This will give it a delicate froth. To  the gravy that is now running from the meat add nothing but a tea-cup  of boiling water. Skim it, and send it to table in a boat.  Serve up with the beef in a small deep plate, scraped horseradish  moistened with vinegar.    Fat meat requires more roasting than lean, and meat that has been  frozen will take nearly double the usual time.    Basting the meat continually with flour and water is a bad  practice, as it gives it a coddled parboiled appearance, and  diminishes the flavour.    These directions for roasting beef will apply equally to mutton.    Pickles are generally eaten with roast beef. French mustard is an  excellent condiment for it. In carving begin by cutting a slice  from the side.      TO SAVE BEEF-DRIPPING.    Pour off through the spout of the roaster or tin-kitchen, all the  fat from the top of the gravy, after you have done basting the  meat with it. Hold a little sieve under the spout, and strain the  dripping through it into a pan. Set it away in a cool place; and  next day when it is cold and congealed, turn the cake of fat, and  scrape with a knife the sediment from the bottom. Pat the dripping  into a jar; cover it tightly, and set it away in the refrigerator,  or in the coldest place you have. It will be found useful for  frying, and for many other purposes.    Mutton-dripping cannot be used for any sort of cooking, as it  communicates to every thing the taste of tallow.      BAKED BEEF.    This is a plain family dish, and is never provided for company.    Take a nice but not a fat piece of fresh beef. Wash it, rub it  with salt, and place it on a trivet in a deep block tin or iron  pan. Pour a little water into the bottom, and put under and round  the trivet a sufficiency of pared potatoes, either white or sweet  ones. Put it into a hot oven, and let it bake till thoroughly  done, basting it frequently with its own gravy. Then transfer it  to a hot dish, and serve up the potatoes in another. Skim the  gravy, and send it to table in a boat.    Or you may boil the potatoes, mash them with milk, and put them  into the bottom of the pan about half an hour before the meat is  done baking. Press down the mashed potatoes hard with the back of  a spoon, score them in cross lines over the top, and let them,  brown under the meat, serving them up laid round it.    Instead of potatoes, you may put in the bottom of the pan what is  called a Yorkshire pudding, to be baked under the meat.    To make this pudding,--stir gradually four table-spoonfuls of  flour into a pint of milk, adding a salt-spoon of salt. Beat three  eggs very light, and mix them gradually with the milk and flour.  See that the batter is not lumpy. Do not put the pudding under the  meat at first, as if baked too long it will be hard and solid.  After the meat has baked till the pan is quite hot and well  greased with the drippings, you may put in the batter; having  continued stirring it till the last moment.    If the pudding is so spread over the pan as to be but an inch  thick, it will require about two hours baking, and need not be  turned. If it is thicker than an inch, you must (after it is brown  on the top) loosen it in the pan, by inserting a knife beneath it,  and having cut it across into four pieces, turn them all nicely  that the other side may be equally done. But this pudding is  lighter and better if laid so thin as not to require turning.    When you serve up the beef lay the pieces of pudding round it, to  be eaten with the meat.    Veal may be baked in this manner with potatoes or a pudding. Also  fresh pork.      TO BOIL CORNED OR SALTED BEEF.    The best piece is the round. You may either boil it whole, or  divide it into two, or even three pieces if it is large, taking  care that each piece shall have a portion of the fat. Wash it  well; and, if very salt, soak it in two waters. Skewer it up  tightly and in a good compact shape, wrapping the flap piece  firmly round it. Tie it round with broad strong tape, or with a  strip of coarse linen. Put it into a large pot, and cover it well  with water. It will be found a convenience to lay it on a fish  drainer.    Hang it over a moderate fire that it may heat gradually all  through. Carefully take off the scum as it rises, and when no more  appears, keep the pot closely covered, and let it boil slowly and  regularly, with the fire at an equal temperature. Allow three  hours and a half to a piece weighing about twelve pounds, and from  that to four or five hours in proportion to the size. Turn the  meat twice in the pot while it is boiling. Put in some carrots and  turnips about two hours after the meat. Many persons boil cabbage  in the same pot with the beef, but it is a much nicer way to do  the greens in a separate vessel, lest they become saturated with  the liquid fat. Cauliflower or brocoli (which are frequent  accompaniments to corned beef) should never be boiled with it.    Wash the cabbage in cold water, removing the outside leaves, and  cutting the stalk close. Examine all the leaves carefully, lest  insects should be lodged among them. If the cabbage is large,  divide it into quarters. Put it into a pot of boiling water with a  handful of salt, and boil it till the stalk is quite tender. Half  an hour will generally be sufficient for a small young cabbage; an  hour for a large full-grown one. Drain it well before you dish it.  If boiled separately from the meat, have ready some melted butter  to eat with it.    Should you find the beef under-done, you may reboil it next day;  putting it into boiling-water and letting it simmer for half an  hour or more, according to its size.    Cold corned beef will keep very well for some days wrapped in  several folds of a thick linen cloth, and set away in a cool dry  place.    In carving a round of beef, slice it horizontally and very thin.  Do not help any one to the outside pieces, as they are generally  too hard and salt. French mustard is very nice with corned beef.  [Footnote: French mustard is made of the very best mustard powder,  diluted with vinegar, and flavoured with minced tarragon leaves,  and a minced clove of garlic; all mixed with a wooden spoon.]    This receipt will apply equally to any piece of corned beef,  except that being less solid than the round, they will, in  proportion to their weight, require rather less time to boil.    In dishing the meat, remove the wooden skewers and substitute  plated or silver ones.

That was the god's portion. A slave spread down a rug for his master  to lie upon and put cushions under his elbow. Glaucon did the same for  Charmides, and the meal began. Menon talked gaily about their journey,  the games to-morrow, Creon's training. But Charmides was silent. At last  his father said:    \"Well, little wolf, you surely are gulping! Are you so starved?\"    \"No,\" said Charmides with full mouth. \"I'm in a hurry. I want to see  things.\"    His father laughed and leaped to his feet.    \"Just like me, lad. Come on!\"    Charmides snatched a handful of figs and rolled out of the tent  squealing with joy. Menon came after him, laughing, and Glaucon followed  to care for them. \"The sun is setting,\" said Menon. \"It will soon be  dark, and to-morrow are the games. They will keep us busy when they  begin, so you must use your eyes to-day if you want to see the fair.\"    He stopped on the hillside and looked down into the sacred place.    \"It is wonderful!\" he said, half to himself. \"The home of glory! I love  every stone of it. I have not been here since I myself won the single  race. And now my son is to win it. That was when you were a baby,  Charmides.\"    \"I know, father,\" whispered the boy with shining eyes. \"I have kissed  your olive wreath, where it hangs above our altar at home.\"    The father put his hand lovingly on the boy's yellow head.    \"By the help of Hermes there soon will be a green one there for you to  kiss, lad. The gods are very good to crown our family twice.\"    \"I wish there were crowns for lame boys to win,\" said Charmides. \"I  would win one!\"    He said that fiercely and clenched his fist. His father looked kindly  into his eyes and spoke solemnly.    \"I think you would, my son. Perhaps there are such crowns.\"    They started on thoughtfully and soon were among the crowd. There were  a hundred interesting sights. They passed an outdoor oven like a little  round hill of stones and clay. The baker was just raking the fire out of  the little door on the side. Charmides waited to see him put the loaves  into the hot cave. But before it was done a horn blew and called him  away to a little table covered with cakes.    \"Honey cakes! Almond cakes! Fig cakes!\" sang the man. \"Come buy!\"    There they lay--stars and fish and ships and temples. Charmides picked  up one in the shape of a lyre.    \"I will take this one,\" he said, and solemnly ate it.    \"Why are you so solemn, son?\" laughed Menon.    The boy did not answer. He only looked up at his father with deep eyes  and said nothing. But in a moment he was racing off to see some rope  dancers.    \"Glaucon,\" said the master to the slave, \"take care of the boy. Give him  a good time. Buy him what he wants. Take him back to camp when he is  tired. I have business to do.\"    Then he turned to talk with a friend, who had come up, and Glaucon  followed his little master.    What a good time the boy had! The rope dancers, the sword swallowers,  the Egyptian with his painted scroll, a trained bear that wrestled with  a wild-looking man dressed in skins, a cooking tent where whole sheep  were roasting and turning over a fire, another where tiny fish were  boiling in a great pot of oil and jumping as if alive--he saw them all.  He stood under the sculptors' awning and gazed at the marble people more  beautiful than life. And when he came upon Apollo striking his lyre, his  heart leaped into his mouth. He stood quiet for a long time gazing at  this god of song. Then he walked out of the tent with shining eyes.    At last it grew dark, and torches began to blaze in front of the booths.    \"Shall we go home, Charmides?\" said Glaucon.    \"Oh, no!\" cried the boy. \"I haven't seen it all. I am not tired. It is  gayer now than ever with the torches. See all those shining flames.\"    And he ran to a booth where a hundred little bronze lamps hung, each  with its tongue of clear light. It was an imagemaker's booth. The table  stood full of little clay statues of the gods. Charmides took up one. It  was a young man leaning against a tree trunk. On his arm he held a baby.    \"It is a model of the great marble Hermes in the temple of Hera, my  little master,\" said the image maker. \"Great Praxiteles made that one,  poor Philo made this one.\"    \"It is beautiful,\" said Charmides and turned away, holding it tenderly  in his hand.    Glaucon waited a moment to pay for the figure. Then he followed  Charmides who had walked on. He was standing on the bridge gazing at the  water.    \"Glaucon,\" he said, \"I must see that statue of Hermes.\"    They stood there talking about the wonderful works of Praxiteles and of  many another artist. Glaucon pointed to a little wooden shed lying in  the meadow.    \"That,\" he said, \"is the workshop of Phidias. There he made the gold and  ivory statue of Zeus that you shall see in Zeus's temple. That workshop  will stay there many a year, I think, for people to love because so  great a thing was done there.\"    \"Is it so wonderful?\" asked Charmides.    \"When it was finished,\" Glaucon answered solemnly, \"Phidias stood before  it and prayed to Zeus to tell him whether it pleased the god. Great Zeus  heard the prayer, and in his joy at the beautiful thing he hurled a  blazing thunderbolt and smote the floor before the statue as if to say,  'This image is Zeus himself.' But I have never seen it, for a slave may  not pass the sacred wall.\"    Now the full moon had risen, and the world was swimming in silver light.  The statue of Victory hung over the sacred place on spread wings. Many  another great form on its high pillar seemed standing in the deep sky  above the world. The little pool in the pebbly river had stars in the  bottom.    \"This Kladeos is a savage little river in the spring,\" said Glaucon. \"It  tries to tear away our Olympia or drown it or cover it with sand. You  see, men have had to fence it in with stone walls.\"    But Charmides was looking at the sacred place and its soft shining  statues in the sky.    \"Let us walk around the wall,\" he said.    So they left the river and passed the gymnasium and the gate. Along this  side the wall cast a wide shadow. Here they walked in silence. Here  there were no tents, no torches, no noisy people. Everything was quiet  in the evening air. The far-off sounds of the fair were a gentle hum. A  hundred pictures were floating in Charmides' mind--Phidias, Zeus, Creon  with the strigil, his own little Hermes, the strange people in the fair,  the marble Apollo under the sculptor's tent. In a few moments they  turned a corner and came out into the soft moonlight. A little beyond  gleamed a broad river, the Alphaeus. Charmides and the slave went over  and strolled along its banks. Here they were again in the crowd and  among tents. They saw a group of people and went toward them. A man  sat on a low knoll a little above the crowd. His hair hung about his  shoulders and his long robe lay in glistening folds about his feet. A  lyre rested on his knees, and he was striking the strings softly. The  sweet notes floated high in the moonlit air. At last he lifted his voice  and sang:      When the swan spreadeth out his wings to alight    On the whirling pools of the foaming stream,    He sendeth to thee, Apollo, a note.    When the sweet-voiced minstrel lifteth his lyre    And stretcheth his hand on the singing string,    He sendeth to thee, Apollo, a prayer.    Even so do I now, a worshiping bard,    With my heart lifted up to begin my lay,    Cry aloud to Apollo, the lord of song.    Then he sang of that lordliest of all minstrels, Orpheus--how the trees  swung circling about to his music; how the savage beasts lay down at his  feet to listen; how the rocks rose up at his bidding and followed him,  dancing, to build a town without hands; how he went to the dismal land  of the dead to seek his wife and with his clear lyre and sweet voice  drew tears from the iron heart of the king of hell and won back his  loved Eurydice and lost her again the same hour.    The boy, sitting there in the moonlight, went floating away on the song  until he felt himself straying through that fair garden of the dead with  singing lyre or riding with Artemis through the sky in her moon chariot.    When the song was ended, Glaucon said, \"Come, little master, you have  fallen asleep. Let us go home.\"    And Charmides rose and went, still clutching his image of Hermes in his  hand and still holding the song fast in his heart.    In the morning the whole great camp was awake and moving long before  daylight. Every man and boy was in his fairest clothes. On every head  was a fresh fillet. Every hand bore some beautiful gift for the gods--a  vase, a plate of gold, an embroidered robe, a basket of silver. All were  pouring to the open gate in the sacred wall. Here a procession formed.  Young men led cattle with gilded horns and swinging garlands, or sheep  with clean, combed wool. Stately priests in long chitons paced to the  music of flutes. The judges glowed in their purple robes. Then walked  the athletes, their eyes burning with excitement. And last came all the  visitors with gift-laden hands. The slaves and foreigners crowded at  the gate to see the procession pass, for on this first holy day only  freedmen and Greeks of pure blood might visit the sacred shrines. When  Charmides passed through, his heart leaped. Here was no empty field with  a few altars. He had never seen a greater crowd in the busy market place  at home in Athens. But here the people were even more beautiful than  the Athenians. Their limbs were round and perfect. They stood always  gracefully. Their garments hung in delicate folds, for they were people  made by great artists--people of marble and of bronze. All the gods of  Olympos were there, and athletes of years gone by, wrestling, running,  hurling the disc. There were bronze"]]]
