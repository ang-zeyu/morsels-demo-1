Yet there was none. Each of  us purposely, and with various skill, ignored it. We talked little, and  when we did it was of anything in the world but that. Personally, I  experienced a touch of that same bewilderment which had come over me  during my first talk with Frances on the evening of my arrival, for I  recall now the acute tension, and the hope, yet dread, that one or other  of us must sooner or later introduce the subject. It did not happen,  however; no reference was made to it even remotely. It was the presence  of Mabel, I felt positive, that prohibited. As soon might we have  discussed Death in the bedroom of a dying woman.    The only scrap of conversation I remember, where all was ordinary and  commonplace, was when Mabel spoke casually to the grenadier asking why  Mrs. Marsh had omitted to do something or other--what it was I forget--  and that the maid replied respectfully that \"Mrs. Marsh was very sorry,  but her 'and still pained her.\" I enquired, though so casually that I  scarcely know what prompted the words, whether she had injured herself  severely, and the reply, \"She upset a lamp and burnt herself,\" was said  in a tone that made me feel my curiosity was indiscreet, \"but she always  has an excuse for not doing things she ought to do.\" The little bit of  conversation remained with me, and I remember particularly the quick way  Frances interrupted and turned the talk upon the delinquencies of  servants in general, telling incidents of her own at our flat with a  volubility that perhaps seemed forced, and that certainly did not  encourage general talk as it may have been intended to do. We lapsed  into silence immediately she finished.    But for all our care and all our calculated silence, each knew that  something had, in these last moments, come very close; it had brushed us  in passing; it had retired; and I am inclined to think now that the  large dark thing I saw, riding the dusk, probably bird of prey, was in  some sense a symbol of it in my mind--that actually there had been no  bird at all, I mean, but that my mood of apprehension and dismay had  formed the vivid picture in my thoughts. It had swept past us, it had  retreated, but it was now, at this moment, in hiding very close. And it  was watching us.    Perhaps, too, it was mere coincidence that I encountered Mrs. Marsh, his  housekeeper, several times that evening in the short interval between  tea and dinner, and that on each occasion the sight of this gaunt,  half-saturnine woman fed my prejudice against her. Once, on my way to the  telephone, I ran into her just where the passage is somewhat jammed by a  square table carrying the Chinese gong, a grandfather's clock and a box  of croquet mallets. We both gave way, then both advanced, then again  gave way--simultaneously. It seemed, impossible to pass. We stepped with  decision to the same side, finally colliding in the middle, while saying  those futile little things, half apology, half excuse, that are  inevitable at such times. In the end she stood upright against the wall  for me to pass, taking her place against the very door I wished to open.  It was ludicrous.    \"Excuse me--I was just going in--to telephone,\" I explained. And she  sidled off, murmuring apologies, but opening the door for me while she  did so. Our hands met a moment on the handle.    There was a second's awkwardness--it was too stupid. I remembered her  injury, and by way of something to say, I enquired after it. She thanked  me; it was entirely healed now, but it might have been much worse; and  there was something about the \"mercy of the Lord\" that I didn't quite  catch. While telephoning, however--London call, and my attention focused  on it--realized sharply that this was the first time I had spoken with  her; also, that I had--touched her.    It happened to be a Sunday, and the lines were clear. I got my  connection quickly, and the incident was forgotten while my thoughts  went up to London. On my way upstairs, then, the woman came back into my  mind, so that I recalled other things about her--how she seemed all over  the house, in unlikely places often; how I had caught her sitting in the  hall alone that night; how she was forever coming and going with her  lugubrious visage and that untidy hair at the back that had made me  laugh three years ago with the idea that it looked singed or burnt; and  how the impression on my first arrival at The Towers was that this woman  somehow kept alive, though its evidence was outwardly suppressed, the  influence of her late employer and of his somber teachings. Somewhere  with her was associated the idea of punishment, vindictiveness, revenge.  I remembered again suddenly my odd notion that she sought to keep her  present mistress here, a prisoner in this bleak and comfortless house,  and that really, in spite of her obsequious silence, she was intensely  opposed to the change of thought that had reclaimed Mabel to a happier  view of life.    All this in a passing second flashed in review before me, and I  discovered, or at any rate reconstructed, the real Mrs. Marsh. She was  decidedly in the Shadow. More, she stood in the forefront of it,  stealthily leading an assault, as it were, against The Towers and its  occupants, as though, consciously or unconsciously, she labored  incessantly to this hateful end.    I can only judge that some state of nervousness in me permitted the  series of insignificant thoughts to assume this dramatic shape, and that  what had gone before prepared the way and led her up at the head of so  formidable a procession. I relate it exactly as it came to me. My nerves  were doubtless somewhat on edge by now. Otherwise I should hardly have  been a prey to the exaggeration at all. I seemed open to so many  strange, impressions.    Nothing else, perhaps, can explain my ridiculous conversation with her,  when, for the third time that evening, I came suddenly upon the woman  half-way down the stairs, standing by an open window as if in the act of  listening. She was dressed in black, a black shawl over her square  shoulders and black gloves on her big, broad hands. Two black objects,  prayer books apparently, she clasped, and on her head she wore a bonnet  with shaking beads of jet. At first I did not know her, as I came  running down upon her from the landing; it was only when she stood aside  to let me pass that I saw her profile against the tapestry and  recognized Mrs. Marsh. And to catch her on the front stairs, dressed  like this, struck me as incongruous--impertinent. I paused in my  dangerous descent. Through the opened window came the sound of bells--  church bells--a sound more depressing to me than superstition, and as  nauseating. Though the action was ill judged, I obeyed the sudden  prompting--was it a secret desire to attack, perhaps?--and spoke to her.    \"Been to church, I suppose, Mrs. Marsh?\" I said. \"Or just going,  perhaps?\"    Her face, as she looked up a second to reply, was like an iron doll that  moved its lips and turned its eyes, but made no other imitation of life  at all.    \"Some of us still goes, sir,\" she said unctuously.    It was respectful enough, yet the implied judgment of the rest of the  world made me almost angry. A deferential insolence lay behind the  affected meekness.    \"For those who believe no doubt it is helpful,\" I smiled. \"True religion  brings peace and happiness, I'm sure--joy, Mrs. Marsh, joy!\" I found  keen satisfaction in the emphasis.    She looked at me like a knife. I cannot describe the implacable thing  that shone in her fixed, stern eyes, nor the shadow of felt darkness  that stole across her face. She glittered. I felt hate in her. I knew--  she knew too--who was in the thoughts of us both at that moment.    She replied softly, never forgetting her place for an instant:    \"There is joy, sir--in 'eaven--over one sinner that repenteth, and in  church there goes up prayer to Gawd for those 'oo--well, for the others,  sir, 'oo--\"    She cut short her sentence thus. The gloom about her as she said it was  like the gloom about a hearse, a tomb, a darkness of great hopeless  dungeons. My tongue ran on of itself with a kind of bitter satisfaction:    \"We must believe there are no others, Mrs. Marsh. Salvation, you know,  would be such a failure if there were. No merciful, all-foreseeing God  could ever have devised such a fearful plan--\"    Her voice, interrupting me, seemed to rise out of the bowels of the  earth:    \"They rejected the salvation when it was offered to them, sir, on  earth.\"    \"But you wouldn't have them tortured forever because of one mistake in  ignorance,\" I said, fixing her with my eye. \"Come now, would you, Mrs.  Marsh? No God worth worshipping could permit such cruelty. Think a  moment what it means.\"    She stared at me, a curious expression in her stupid eyes. It seemed to  me as though the \"woman\" in her revolted, while yet she dared not suffer  her grim belief to trip. That is, she would willingly have had it  otherwise but for a terror that prevented.    \"We may pray for them, sir, and we do--we may 'ope.\" She dropped her  eyes to the carpet.    \"Good, good!\" I put in cheerfully, sorry now that I had spoken at all.  \"That's more hopeful, at any rate isn't it?\"    She murmured something about Abraham's bosom, and the \"time of salvation  not being forever,\" as I tried to pass her. Then a half gesture that she  made stopped me. There was something more she wished to say--to ask. She  looked up furtively. In her eyes I saw the \"woman\" peering out through  fear.    \"Per'aps, sir.\" she faltered, as though lightning must strike her dead,  \"per'aps, would you think, a drop of cold water, given in His name,  might moisten--?\"    But I stopped her, for the foolish talk had lasted long enough. \"Of  course,\" I exclaimed, \"of course.

She begins where the rest of the calico leaves off.\"    \"H-m! that sounds familiar, somehow. Well, Steve, you've said that if  you had a good start you think the girl would marry you.\"    \"I think she might.\"    \"She pretty fond of you?\"    \"She knows that if I can't have her I'm fast enough to keep everyone  else away.\"    \"I see. A process of elimination with you as the eliminator. Rather an  odd courtship, Steve?\"    The cowpuncher grew deadly serious.    \"You see, I love her. There ain't no way of bucking out of that. So do  nine out of ten of all the boys that've seen her. Which one will she  pick? That's the question we all keep askin', because of all the  contrary, freckle-faced devils with the heart of a man an' the smile of  a woman, Sally has 'em all beat from the drop of the barrier. One feller  has money; another has looks; another has a funny line of talk. But I've  got the fastest gun. So Sally sees she's due for a complete outfit of  black mournin' if she marries another man while I'm alive; an' that  keeps her thinkin'. But if I had the price of a start in the world--why,  maybe she'd take a long look at me.\"    \"Would she call one thousand dollars in cash a start in the world--and  your job as foreman of my place, with twice the salary you have now?\"    Steve Nash wiped his forehead.    He said huskily: \"A joke along this line don't bring no laugh from me,  governor.\"    \"I mean it, Steve. Get Anthony Bard tied hand and foot into this house  so that I can talk to him safely for ten minutes, and you'll have  everything I promise. Perhaps more. But that depends.\"    The blunt-fingered hand of Nash stole across the table.    \"If it's a go, shake, Mr. Drew.\"    A mighty hand fell in his, and under the pressure he set his teeth.  Afterward he covertly moved his fingers and sighed with relief to see  that no permanent harm had been done.    \"Me speakin' personal, Mr. Drew, I'd of give a lot to seen you when you  was ridin' the range. This Bard--he'll be here before sunset to-morrow.\"    \"Don't jump to conclusions, Steve. I've an idea that before you count  your thousand you'll think that you've been underpaid. That's straight.\"    \"This Bard is something of a man?\"    \"I can say that without stopping to think.\"    \"Texas?\"    \"No. He's a tenderfoot, but he can ride a horse as if he was sewed to  the skin, and I've an idea that he can do other things up to the same  standard. If you can find two or three men who have silent tongues and  strong hands, you'd better take them along. I'll pay their wages, and  big ones. You can name your price.\"    But Nash was frowning.    \"Now and then I talk to the cards a bit, Mr. Drew, and you'll hear  fellers say some pretty rough things about me, but I've never asked for  no odds against any man. I'm not going to start now.\"    \"You're a hard man, Steve, but so am I; and hard men are the kind I take  to. I know that you're the best foreman who ever rode this range and I  know that when you start things you generally finish them. All that I  ask is that you bring Bard to me in this house. The way you do it is  your own problem. Drunk or drugged, I don't care how, but get him here  unharmed. Understand?\"    \"Mr. Drew, you can start figurin' what you want to say to him now. I'll  get him here--safe! And then Sally--\"    \"If money will buy her you'll have me behind you when you bid.\"    \"When shall I start?\"    \"Now.\"    \"So-long, then.\"    He rose and passed hastily from the room, leaning forward from the hips  like a man who is making a start in a foot-race.    Straight up the stairs he went to his room, for the foreman lived in the  big house of the rancher. There he took a quantity of equipment from a  closet and flung it on the bed. Over three selections he lingered long.    The first was the cartridge belt, and he tried over several with  conscientious care until he found the one which received the cartridges  with the greatest ease. He could flip them out in the night,  automatically as a pianist fingers the scale in the dark.    Next he examined lariats painfully, inch by inch, as though he were  going out to rope the stanchest steer that ever roamed the range.  Already he knew that those ropes were sound and true throughout, but he  took no chances now. One of the ropes he discarded because one or two  strands in it were, or might be, a trifle frayed. The others he took  alternately and whirled with a broad loop, standing in the centre of the  room. Of the set one was a little more supple, a little more durable, it  seemed. This he selected and coiled swiftly.    Last of all he lingered--and longest--over his revolvers. Six in all, he  set them in a row along the bed and without delay threw out two to begin  with. Then he fingered the others, tried their weight and balance,  slipped cartridges into the cylinders and extracted them again, whirled  the cylinders, examined the minutest parts of the actions.    They were all such guns as an expert would have turned over with shining  eyes, but finally he threw one aside into the discard; the cylinder  revolved just a little too hard. Another was abandoned after much  handling of the remaining three because to the delicate touch of Nash it  seemed that the weight of the barrel was a gram more than in the other  two; but after this selection it seemed that there was no possible  choice between the final two.    So he stood in the centre of the room and went through a series of odd  gymnastics. Each gun in turn he placed in the holster and then jerked it  out, spinning it on the trigger guard around his second finger, while  his left hand shot diagonally across his body and \"fanned\" the hammer.  Still he could not make his choice, but he would not abandon the effort.  It was an old maxim with him that there is in all the world one gun  which is the best of all and with which even a novice can become a  \"killer.\"    He tried walking away, whirling as he made his draw, and levelling the  gun on the door-knob. Then without moving his hand, he lowered his head  and squinted down the sights. In each case the bead was drawn to a  centre shot. Last of all he weighed each gun; one seemed a trifle  lighter--the merest shade lighter than the other. This he slipped into  the holster and carried the rest of his apparatus back to the closet  from which he had taken it.    Still the preparation had not ended. Filling his cartridge belt, every  cartridge was subject to a rigid inspection. A full half hour was wasted  in this manner. Wasted, because he rejected not one of the many he  examined. Yet he seemed happier after having made his selection, and  went down the stairs, humming softly.    Out to the barn he went, lantern in hand. This time he made no  comparison of horses but went directly to an ugly-headed roan, long of  leg, vicious of eye, thin-shouldered, and with hips that slanted sharply  down. No one with a knowledge of fine horse-flesh could have looked on  this brute without aversion. It did not have even size in its favour. A  wild, free spirit, perhaps, might be the reason; but the animal stood  with hanging head and pendant lower lip. One eye was closed and the  other only half opened. A blind affection, then, made him go to this  horse first of all.    No, his greeting was to jerk his knee sharply into the ribs of the roan,  which answered with a grunt and swung its head around with bared teeth,  like an angry dog. \"Damn your eyes!\" roared the hoarse voice of Steve  Nash, \"stand still or I'll knock you for a goal!\"    The ears of the mustang flattened close to its neck and a devil of hate  came up in its eyes, but it stood quiet, while Nash went about at a  judicious distance and examined all the vital points. The hoofs were  sound, the backbone prominent, but not a high ridge from famine or much  hard riding, and the indomitable hate in the eyes of the mustang seemed  to please the cowpuncher.    It was a struggle to bridle the beast, which was accomplished only by  grinding the points of his knuckles into a tender part of the jowl to  make the locked teeth open.    In saddling, the knee came into play again, rapping the ribs of the  brute repeatedly before the wind, which swelled out the chest to false  proportions, was expelled in a sudden grunt, and the cinch whipped up  taut. After that Nash dodged the flying heels, chose his time, and  vaulted into the saddle.    The mustang trotted quietly out of the barn. Perhaps he had had his fill  of bucking on that treacherous, slippery wooden floor, but once outside  he turned loose the full assortment of the cattle-pony's tricks. It was  only ten minutes, but while it lasted the cursing of Nash was loud and  steady, mixed with the crack of his murderous quirt against the roan's  flanks. The bucking ended as quickly as it had begun, and they started  at a long canter over the trail.          CHAPTER XII      THE FIRST DAY    Mile after mile of the rough trail fell behind him, and still the pony  shambled along at a loose trot or a swinging canter; the steep upgrades  it took at a steady jog and where the slopes pitched sharply down, it  wound among the rocks with a faultless sureness of foot.    Certainly the choice of Nash was well made. An Eastern horse of blood  over a level course could have covered the same distance in half the  time, but it would have broken down after ten miles of that hard trail.    Dawn came while they wound over the crest of the range, and with the sun  in their faces they took the downgrade. It was well into the morning  before Nash reached Logan. He forced from his eye the contempt which all  cattlemen feel for sheepherders.    \"I s'pose you're"]]]
