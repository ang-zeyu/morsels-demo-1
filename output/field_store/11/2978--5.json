To be set afoot _naked_--it was horrible, and  unbelievable. He thought of tramping, barefooted and bare-legged,  through fifteen miles of sage-covered Badlands to camp, with the sun  beating down on his unprotected back, and groaned in anticipation. Not  even his pessimism had ever pictured a thing so terrible.    He gazed at the gray-blue river which had caused this trouble that he  must face, and forgetting the luxury of its coolness, cursed it  venomously. Little waves washed up on the pebbly bank, and glinted in  the sun while they whispered mocking things to him. Happy Jack gave  over swearing at the river, and turned his wrath upon Stranger--Stranger,  hurtling along somewhere through the breaks, with all Happy's clothes  tied firmly to the saddle. Happy Jack sighed lugubriously when he  remembered how firmly. A fleeting hope that, if he followed the trail  of Stranger, he might glean a garment or two that had slipped loose,  died almost before it lived. Happy Jack knew too well the kind of  knots he always tied. His favorite boast that nothing ever worked  loose on his saddle, came back now to mock him with its absolute  truth.    The sun, dropping a bit lower, robbed him inch by inch of the shade to  which he clung foolishly. He hunched himself into as small a space as  his big frame would permit, and hung his hat upon his knees where they  stuck out into the sunlight. It was very hot, and his position was  cramped, but he would not go yet; he was still thinking--and the brain  of Happy Jack worked ever slowly. In such an unheard-of predicament he  felt dimly that he had need of much thought.    When not even his hat could shield him from the sun glare, he got up  and went nipping awkwardly over the hot beach. He was going into the  next river-bottom--wherever that was--on the chance of finding a  cow-camp, or some cabin where he could, by some means, clothe himself.  He did not like the idea of facing the Happy Family in his present  condition; he knew the Happy Family. Perhaps he might find someone  living down here next the river. He hoped so--for Happy Jack, when  things were so bad they could not well be worse, was forced to give  over the prediction of further evil, and pursue blindly the faintest  whisper of hope. He got up on the bank, where the grass was kinder to  his unaccustomed feet than were the hot stones below, and hurried away  with his back to the sun, that scorched him cruelly.    In the next bottom--and he was long getting to it--the sage brush grew  dishearteningly thick. Happy began to be afraid of snakes. He went  slowly, stepping painfully where the ground seemed smoothest; he never  could walk fifteen miles in his bare feet, he owned dismally to  himself. His only hope lay in getting clothes.    Halfway down the bottom, he joyfully came upon a camp, but it had long  been deserted; from the low, tumble-down corrals, and the unmistakable  atmosphere of the place, Happy Jack knew it for a sheep camp. But  nothing save the musty odor and the bare cabin walls seemed to have  been left behind. He searched gloomily, thankful for the brief shade  the cabin offered. Then, tossed up on the rafters and forgotten, he  discovered a couple of dried sheep pelts, untanned and stiff, almost,  as shingles. Still, they were better than nothing, and he grinned in  sickly fashion at the find.    Realizing, in much pain, that some protection for his feet was an  absolute necessity, he tore a pelt in two for sandals. Much search  resulted in the discovery of a bit of rotted rope, which he unraveled  and thereby bound a piece of sheepskin upon each bruised foot. They  were not pretty, but they answered the purpose. The other pelt he  disposed of easily by tying the two front legs together around his  neck and letting the pelt hang down his back as far as it would reach.  There being nothing more that he could do in the way of  self-adornment, Happy Jack went out again into the hot afternoon. At  his best, Happy Jack could never truthfully be called handsome; just  now, clothed inadequately in gray Stetson hat and two meager  sheepskins, he looked scarce human.    Cheered a bit, he set out sturdily over the hills toward the mouth of  Suction Creek. The Happy Family would make all kinds of fools of  themselves, he supposed, if he showed up like this; but he might not  be obliged to appear before them in his present state of undress; he  might strike some other camp, first. Happy Jack was still forced to be  hopeful. He quite counted on striking another camp before reaching the  wagons of the Flying U.    The sun slid farther and farther toward the western rim of tumbled  ridges as Happy Jack, in his strange raiment, plodded laboriously to  the north. The mantle he was forced to shift constantly into a new  position as the sun's rays burned deep a new place, or the stiff hide  galled his blistered shoulders. The sandals did better, except that  the rotten strands of rope were continually wearing through on the  bottom, so that he must stop and tie fresh knots, or replace the bit  from the scant surplus which he had prudently brought along.    Till sundown he climbed toilfully up the steep hills and then  scrambled as toilfully into the coulees, taking the straightest course  he knew for the mouth of Suction Creek; that, as a last resort, while  he watched keenly for the white flake against green which would tell  of a tent pitched there in the wilderness. He was hungry--when he  forgot other discomforts long enough to think of it. Worst, perhaps,  was the way in which the gaunt sage brush scratched his unclothed legs  when he was compelled to cross a patch on some coulee bottom. Happy  Jack swore a great deal, in those long, heat-laden hours, and never  did he so completely belie the name men had in sarcasm given him.    Just when he was given over to the most gloomy forebodings, a white  square stood out for a moment sharply against a background of pines,  far below him in a coulee where the sun was peering fleetingly before  it dove out of sight over a hill. Happy Jack--of a truth, the most  unhappy Jack one could find, though he searched far and long--stood  still and eyed the white patch critically. There was only the one; but  another might be hidden in the trees. Still, there was no herd grazing  anywhere in the coulee, and no jingle of cavvy bells came to his ears,  though he listened long. He was sure that it was not the camp of the  Flying U, where he would be ministered unto faithfully, to be sure,  yet where the ministrations would be mingled with much wit-sharpened  raillery harder even to bear than was his present condition of  sun-blisters and scratches. He thanked the Lord in sincere if  unorthodox terms, and went down the hill in long, ungraceful strides.    It was far down that hill, and it was farther across the coulee. Each  step grew more wearisome to Happy Jack, unaccustomed as he was to  using his own feet as a mode of travel. But away in the edge of the  pine grove were food and raiment, and a shelter from the night that  was creeping down on him with the hurried stealth of a mountain lion  after its quarry. He shifted the sheepskin mantle for the thousandth  time; this time he untied it from his galled shoulders and festooned  it modestly if unbecomingly about his middle.    Feeling sure of the unfailing hospitality of the rangeland, be the  tent-dweller whom he might, Happy Jack walked boldly through the soft,  spring twilight that lasts long in Montana, and up to the very door of  the tent. A figure--a female figure--slender and topped by thin face  and eyes sheltered behind glasses, rose up, gazed upon him in horror,  shrieked till one could hear her a mile, and fell backward into the  tent. Another female figure appeared, looked, and shrieked also--and  even louder than did the first. Happy Jack, with a squawk of dismay,  turned and flew incontinently afar into the dusk. A man's voice he  heard, shouting inquiry; another, shouting what, from a distance,  sounded like threats. Happy Jack did not wait to make sure; he ran  blindly, until he brought up in a patch of prickly-pear, at which he  yelled, forgetting for the instant that he was pursued. Somehow he  floundered out and away from the torture of the stinging spines, and  took to the hills. A moon, big as the mouth of a barrel, climbed over  a ridge and betrayed him to the men searching below, and they shouted  and fired a gun. Happy Jack did not believe they could shoot very  straight, but he was in no mood to take chances; he sought refuge  among a jumble of great, gray bowlders; sat himself down in the shadow  and caressed gingerly the places where the prickly-pear had punctured  his skin, and gave himself riotously over to blasphemy.    The men below were prowling half-heartedly, it seemed to him--as if  they were afraid of running upon him too suddenly. It came to him that  they were afraid of him--and he grinned feebly at the joke. He had not  before stopped to consider his appearance, being concerned with more  important matters. Now, however, as he pulled the scant covering of  the pelt over his shoulders to keep off the chill of the night, he  could not wonder that the woman at the tent had fainted. Happy Jack  suspected shrewdly that he could, in that rig, startle almost any one.    He watched the coulee wistfully. They were making fires, down there  below him; great, revealing bonfires at intervals that would make it  impossible to pass their line unseen. He could not doubt that some one  was _cached_ in the shadows with a gun. There were more than two men;  Happy Jack thought that there must be at least four or five. He would  have liked to go down, just out of gun range, and shout explanations  and a request for some clothes--only for the women. Happy was always  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13678"],[0,"Chapters on Jewish Literature (#11)"],[1,"  And wait for them at heaven's high door.       But no good deeds have I to bring,       No righteousness for offering.       No service for my Lord and King.         Yet hide not thou thy face from me,       Nor cast me out afar from thee;       But when thou bidd'st my life to cease,       O may'st thou lead me forth in peace       Unto the world to come, to dwell       Among thy pious ones, who tell       Thy glories inexhaustible.         There let my portion be with those       Who to eternal life arose;       There purify my heart aright,       In thy light to behold the light.       Raise me from deepest depths to share       Heaven's endless joys of praise and prayer,       That I may evermore declare:  Though thou wast angered, Lord, I will give thanks to thee,  For past is now thy wrath, and thou dost comfort me.    Ibn Gebirol stood a little outside and a good deal above the circle of  the Jewish poets who made this era so brilliant. Many of them are now  forgotten; they had their day of popularity in Toledo, Cordova, Seville,  and Granada, but their poems have not survived.    In the very year of Ibn Gebirol's death Moses Ibn Ezra was born. Of his  life little is certain, but it is known that he was still alive in  1138. He is called the \"poet of penitence,\" and a gloomy turn was given  to his thought by an unhappy love attachment in his youth. A few stanzas  of one of his poems run thus:        Sleepless, upon my bed the hours I number,      And, rising, seek the house of God, while slumber      Lies heavy on men's eyes, and dreams encumber      Their souls in visions of the night.        In sin and folly passed my early years,      Wherefore I am ashamed, and life's arrears      Now strive to pay, the while my tears      Have been my food by day and night.          *       *       *       *       *        Short is man's life, and full of care and sorrow,      This way and that he turns some ease to borrow,      Like to a flower he blooms, and on the morrow      Is gone--a vision of the night.        How does the weight of sin my soul oppress,      Because God's law too often I transgress;      I mourn and sigh, with tears of bitterness      My bed I water all the night.          *       *       *       *       *        My youth wanes like a shadow that's cast,      Swifter than eagle's wings my years fly fast,      And I remember not my gladness past,      Either by day or yet by night.        Proclaim we then a fast, a holy day,      Make pure our hearts from sin, God's will obey,      And unto him, with humbled spirit pray      Unceasingly, by day and night.        May we yet hear his words: \"Thou art my own,      My grace is thine, the shelter of my throne,      For I am thy Redeemer, I alone;      Endure but patiently this night!\"    But his hymns, many of which won a permanent place in the prayer-book,  are not always sad. Often they are warm with hope, and there is a lilt  about them which is almost gay. His chief secular poem, \"The Topaz\"  (_Tarshish_), is in ten parts, and contains 1210 lines. It is written on  an Arabic model: it contains no rhymes, but is metrical, and the same  word, with entirely different meanings, occurs at the end of several  lines. It needs a good deal of imagination to appreciate Moses Ibn Ezra,  and this is perhaps what Charizi meant when he called him \"the poet's  poet.\"    Another Ibn Ezra, Abraham, one of the greatest Jews of the Middle Ages,  was born in Toledo before 1100. He passed a hard life, but he laughed at  his fate. He said of himself:        If I sold shrouds,        No one would die.      If I sold lamps,        Then, in the sky,      The sun, for spite,      Would shine by night.    Several of Abraham Ibn Ezra's hymns are instinct with the spirit of  resignation. Here is one of them:        I hope for the salvation of the Lord,        In him I trust, when fears my being thrill,      Come life, come death, according to his word,        He is my portion still.        Hence, doubting heart! I will the Lord extol        With gladness, for in him is my desire,      Which, as with fatness, satisfies my soul,        That doth to heaven aspire.        All that is hidden shall mine eyes behold,        And the great Lord of all be known to me,      Him will I serve, his am I as of old;        I ask not to be free.        Sweet is ev'n sorrow coming in his name,        Nor will I seek its purpose to explore,      His praise will I continually proclaim,        And bless him evermore.    Ibn Ezra wandered over many lands, and even visited London, where he  stayed in 1158. Ibn Ezra was famed, not only for his poetry, but also  for his brilliant wit and many-sided learning. As a mathematician, as a  poet, as an expounder of Scriptures, he won a high place in Jewish  annals. In his commentaries he rejected the current digressive and  allegorical methods, and steered a middle course between free research  on the one hand, and blind adherence to tradition on the other. Ibn Ezra  was the first to maintain that the Book of Isaiah contains the work of  two prophets--a view now almost universal. He never for a moment  doubted, however, that the Bible was in every part inspired and in every  part the word of God. But he was also the father of the \"Higher  Criticism.\" Ibn Ezra's pioneer work in spreading scientific methods of  study in France was shared by Joseph Kimchi, who settled in Narbonne in  the middle of the twelfth century. His sons, Moses and David, were  afterwards famous as grammarians and interpreters of the Scriptures.  David Kimchi (1160-1235) by his lucidity and thoroughness established  for his grammar, \"Perfection\" (_Michlol_), and his dictionary, \"Book of  Roots,\" complete supremacy in the field of exegesis. He was the favorite  authority of the Christian students of Hebrew at the time of the  Reformation, and the English Authorized Version of 1611 owed much to  him.    At this point, however, we must retrace our steps, and cast a glance at  Hebrew literature in France at a period earlier than the era of Ibn  Ezra.

Before Hebrew poets, scientists, philosophers, and statesmen had made  Spain famous in Jewish annals, Rashi and his school were building up a  reputation destined to associate Jewish learning with France. In France  there was none of the width of culture which distinguished Spain. Rashi  did not shine as anything but an exponent of traditional Judaism. He  possessed no graces of style, created no new literature. But he  represented Judaism at its simplest, its warmest, its intensest. Rashi  was a great writer because his subject was great, not because he wrote  greatly.    But it is only a half-truth to assert that Rashi had no graces of style.  For, if grace be the quality of producing effects with the least  display of effort, then there was no writer more graceful than Rashi.  His famous Commentary on the Talmud is necessarily long and intricate,  but there is never a word too much. No commentator on any classic ever  surpassed Rashi in the power of saying enough and only enough. He owed  this faculty in the first place to his intellectual grasp. He edited the  Talmud as well as explained it. He restored the original text with the  surest of critical instincts. And his conscience was in his work. So  thoroughly honest was he that, instead of slurring over difficulties, he  frankly said: \"I cannot understand ... I do not know,\" in the rare cases  in which he was at a loss. Rashi moreover possessed that wondrous  sympathy with author and reader which alone qualifies a third mind to  interpret author to reader. Probing the depth of the Talmud, Rashi  probed the depth of the learned student, and realized the needs of the  beginner. Thus the beginner finds Rashi useful, and the specialist  turns to him for help. His immediate disciples rarely quote him by name;  to them he is \"_the_ Commentator.\"    Rashi was not the first to subject the Talmud to critical analysis. The  Gaonim had begun the task, and Nathan, the son of Yechiel of Rome,  compiled, in about the year 1000, a dictionary (_Aruch_) which is still  the standard work of reference. But Rashi's nearest predecessor,  Alfassi, was not an expounder of the Talmud; he extracted, with much  skill, the practical results from the logical mazes in which they were  enveloped. Isaac, the son of Jacob Alfassi, derived his name from Fez,  where he was born in 1013. He gave his intellect entirely to the Talmud,  but he acquired from the Moorish culture of his day a sense of order and  system. He dealt exclusively with the _Halachah_, or practical contents  of the Rabbinic law, and the guide which he compiled to the Talmud soon  superseded all previous works of its kind. Solomon, the son of Isaac,  best known as _R_abbi _Sh_elomo _Iz_chaki (Rashi), was born in 1040, and  died in 1105, in Troyes, in Champagne. From his mother, who came of a  family of poets, he inherited his warm humanity, his love for Judaism.  From his father, he"]]]
