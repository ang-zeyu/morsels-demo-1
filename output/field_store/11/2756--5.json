Selah.    19:049:016 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of             his house is increased;    19:049:017 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall             not descend after him.    19:049:018 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise             thee, when thou doest well to thyself.    19:049:019 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never             see light.    19:049:020 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the             beasts that perish.    19:050:001 The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the             earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.    19:050:002 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.    19:050:003 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall             devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round             about him.    19:050:004 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth,             that he may judge his people.    19:050:005 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a             covenant with me by sacrifice.    19:050:006 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is             judge himself. Selah.    19:050:007 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will             testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.    19:050:008 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt             offerings, to have been continually before me.    19:050:009 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of             thy folds.    19:050:010 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a             thousand hills.    19:050:011 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of             the field are mine.    19:050:012 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is             mine, and the fulness thereof.    19:050:013 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?    19:050:014 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most             High:    19:050:015 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee,             and thou shalt glorify me.    19:050:016 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare             my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy             mouth?    19:050:017 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind             thee.    19:050:018 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and             hast been partaker with adulterers.    19:050:019 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.    19:050:020 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest             thine own mother's son.    19:050:021 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou             thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I             will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.    19:050:022 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in             pieces, and there be none to deliver.    19:050:023 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth             his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.    19:051:001 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:             according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my             transgressions.    19:051:002 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my             sin.    19:051:003 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before             me.    19:051:004 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in             thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest,             and be clear when thou judgest.    19:051:005 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother             conceive me.    19:051:006 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the             hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.    19:051:007 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I             shall be whiter than snow.    19:051:008 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou             hast broken may rejoice.    19:051:009 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.    19:051:010 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit             within me.    19:051:011 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy             spirit from me.    19:051:012 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with             thy free spirit.    19:051:013 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be             converted unto thee.    19:051:014 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my             salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy             righteousness.    19:051:015 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy             praise.    19:051:016 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou             delightest not in burnt offering.    19:051:017 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a             contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.    19:051:018 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls             of Jerusalem.    19:051:019 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of             righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering:             then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.    19:052:001 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the             goodness of God endureth continually.    19:052:002 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working             deceitfully.    19:052:003 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to             speak righteousness. Selah.    19:052:004 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.    19:052:005 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee             away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee             out of the land of the living. Selah.    19:052:006 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at             him:    19:052:007 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but             trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened             himself in his wickedness.    19:052:008 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust             in the mercy of God for ever and ever.    19:052:009 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I             will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.    19:053:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are             they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that             doeth good.    19:053:002 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see             if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.    19:053:003 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become             filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.    19:053:004 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my             people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.    19:053:005 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath             scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou             hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.    19:053:006 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When             God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall             rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.    19:054:001 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.    19:054:002 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.    19:054:003 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek             after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.    19:054:004 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold             my soul.    19:054:005 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy             truth.    19:054:006 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O             LORD; for it is good.    19:054:007 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath             seen his desire upon mine enemies.    19:055:001 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my             supplication.    19:055:002 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make             a noise;    19:055:003 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression             of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath             they hate me.    19:055:004 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death             are fallen upon me.    19:055:005 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath             overwhelmed me.    19:055:006 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I             fly away, and be at rest.    19:055:007 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.             Selah.    19:055:008 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.    19:055:009 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen             violence and strife in the city.    19:055:010 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:             mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.    19:055:011 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart             not from her streets.    19:055:012 For it was not an enemy that reproached me;

but the poor that             hath understanding searcheth him out.    20:028:012 When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when             the wicked rise, a man is hidden.    20:028:013 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso             confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.    20:028:014 Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his             heart shall fall into mischief.    20:028:015 As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler             over the poor people.    20:028:016 The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great             oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his             days.    20:028:017 A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall             flee to the pit; let no man stay him.    20:028:018 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is             perverse in his ways shall fall at once.    20:028:019 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he             that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.    20:028:020 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh             haste to be rich shall not be innocent.    20:028:021 To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of             bread that man will transgress.    20:028:022 He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth             not that poverty shall come upon him.    20:028:023 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than             he that flattereth with the tongue.    20:028:024 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no             transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.    20:028:025 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that             putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.    20:028:026 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh             wisely, he shall be delivered.    20:028:027 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that             hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.    20:028:028 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they             perish, the righteous increase.    20:029:001 He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall             suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.    20:029:002 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but             when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.    20:029:003 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth             company with harlots spendeth his substance.    20:029:004 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that             receiveth gifts overthroweth it.    20:029:005 A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his             feet.    20:029:006 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the             righteous doth sing and rejoice.    20:029:007 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the             wicked regardeth not to know it.    20:029:008 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away             wrath.    20:029:009 If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage             or laugh, there is no rest.    20:029:010 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.    20:029:011 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in             till afterwards.    20:029:012 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.    20:029:013 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD             lighteneth both their eyes.    20:029:014 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be             established for ever.    20:029:015 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself             bringeth his mother to shame.    20:029:016 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but             the righteous shall see their fall.    20:029:017 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall             give delight unto thy soul.    20:029:018 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that             keepeth the law, happy is he.    20:029:019 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he             understand he will not answer.    20:029:020 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more             hope of a fool than of him.    20:029:021 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall             have him become his son at the length.    20:029:022 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth             in transgression.    20:029:023 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the             humble in spirit.    20:029:024 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth             cursing, and bewrayeth it not.    20:029:025 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust             in the LORD shall be safe.    20:029:026 Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh             from the LORD.    20:029:027 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is             upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.    20:030:001 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man             spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,    20:030:002 Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the             understanding of a man.    20:030:003 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.    20:030:004 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath             gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a             garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what             is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?    20:030:005 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put             their trust in him.    20:030:006 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be             found a liar.    20:030:007 Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I             die:    20:030:008 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty             nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:    20:030:009 Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or             lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in             vain.    20:030:010 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and             thou be found guilty.    20:030:011 There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not             bless their mother.    20:030:012 There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet             is not washed from their filthiness.    20:030:013 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their             eyelids are lifted up.    20:030:014 There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their             jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth,             and the needy from among men.    20:030:015 The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There             are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things             say not, It is enough:    20:030:016 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled             with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.    20:030:017 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his             mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the             young eagles shall eat it.    20:030:018 There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea,             four which I know not:    20:030:019 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a             rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way             of a man with a maid.    20:030:020 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth             her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.    20:030:021 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which             it cannot bear:    20:030:022 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled             with meat;    20:030:023 For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that             is heir to her mistress.    20:030:024 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they             are exceeding wise:    20:030:025 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat             in the summer;    20:030:026 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses             in the rocks;    20:030:027 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by             bands;    20:030:028 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings'             palaces.    20:030:029 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in             going:    20:030:030 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away          "]]]
