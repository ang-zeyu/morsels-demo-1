As the  single-hearted Scottishman had never for a moment doubted these gods of  the ancient Gentiles to be actually devils, so he now hesitated not  to believe that the blasphemous hymn of the Saracen had raised up an  infernal spirit.    \"But what recks it?\" said stout Sir Kenneth to himself; \"down with the  fiend and his worshippers!\"    He did not, however, think it necessary to give the same warning of  defiance to two enemies as he would unquestionably have afforded to one.  His hand was upon his mace, and perhaps the unwary Saracen would have  been paid for his Persian poetry by having his brains dashed out on the  spot, without any reason assigned for it; but the Scottish Knight was  spared from committing what would have been a sore blot in his shield  of arms. The apparition, on which his eyes had been fixed for some time,  had at first appeared to dog their path by concealing itself behind  rocks and shrubs, using those advantages of the ground with great  address, and surmounting its irregularities with surprising agility. At  length, just as the Saracen paused in his song, the figure, which was  that of a tall man clothed in goat-skins, sprung into the midst of  the path, and seized a rein of the Saracen's bridle in either hand,  confronting thus and bearing back the noble horse, which, unable to  endure the manner in which this sudden assailant pressed the long-armed  bit, and the severe curb, which, according to the Eastern fashion, was  a solid ring of iron, reared upright, and finally fell backwards on his  master, who, however, avoided the peril of the fall by lightly throwing  himself to one side.    The assailant then shifted his grasp from the bridle of the horse to the  throat of the rider, flung himself above the struggling Saracen, and,  despite of his youth and activity kept him undermost, wreathing his  long arms above those of his prisoner, who called out angrily, and yet  half-laughing at the same time--\"Hamako--fool--unloose me--this passes  thy privilege--unloose me, or I will use my dagger.\"    \"Thy dagger!--infidel dog!\" said the figure in the goat-skins, \"hold it  in thy gripe if thou canst!\" and in an instant he wrenched the Saracen's  weapon out of its owner's hand, and brandished it over his head.    \"Help, Nazarene!\" cried Sheerkohf, now seriously alarmed; \"help, or the  Hamako will slay me.\"    \"Slay thee!\" replied the dweller of the desert; \"and well hast thou  merited death, for singing thy blasphemous hymns, not only to the praise  of thy false prophet, who is the foul fiend's harbinger, but to that of  the Author of Evil himself.\"    The Christian Knight had hitherto looked on as one stupefied, so  strangely had this rencontre contradicted, in its progress and event,  all that he had previously conjectured. He felt, however, at length,  that it touched his honour to interfere in behalf of his discomfited  companion, and therefore addressed himself to the victorious figure in  the goat-skins.    \"Whosoe'er thou art,\" he said, \"and whether of good or of evil, know  that I am sworn for the time to be true companion to the Saracen whom  thou holdest under thee; therefore, I pray thee to let him arise, else I  will do battle with thee in his behalf.\"    \"And a proper quarrel it were,\" answered the Hamako, \"for a Crusader to  do battle in--for the sake of an unbaptized dog, to combat one of his  own holy faith! Art thou come forth to the wilderness to fight for the  Crescent against the Cross? A goodly soldier of God art thou to listen  to those who sing the praises of Satan!\"    Yet, while he spoke thus, he arose himself, and, suffering the Saracen  to rise also, returned him his cangiar, or poniard.    \"Thou seest to what a point of peril thy presumption hath brought thee,\"  continued he of the goat-skins, now addressing Sheerkohf, \"and by what  weak means thy practised skill and boasted agility can be foiled, when  such is Heaven's pleasure. Wherefore, beware, O Ilderim! for know that,  were there not a twinkle in the star of thy nativity which promises for  thee something that is good and gracious in Heaven's good time, we  two had not parted till I had torn asunder the throat which so lately  trilled forth blasphemies.\"    \"Hamako,\" said the Saracen, without any appearance of resenting the  violent language and yet more violent assault to which he had been  subjected, \"I pray thee, good Hamako, to beware how thou dost again urge  thy privilege over far; for though, as a good Moslem, I respect those  whom Heaven hath deprived of ordinary reason, in order to endow them  with the spirit of prophecy, yet I like not other men's hands on the  bridle of my horse, neither upon my own person. Speak, therefore, what  thou wilt, secure of any resentment from me; but gather so much sense  as to apprehend that if thou shalt again proffer me any violence, I will  strike thy shagged head from thy meagre shoulders.--and to thee, friend  Kenneth,\" he added, as he remounted his steed, \"I must needs say, that  in a companion through the desert, I love friendly deeds better than  fair words. Of the last thou hast given me enough; but it had been  better to have aided me more speedily in my struggle with this Hamako,  who had well-nigh taken my life in his frenzy.\"    \"By my faith,\" said the Knight, \"I did somewhat fail--was somewhat tardy  in rendering thee instant help; but the strangeness of the assailant,  the suddenness of the scene--it was as if thy wild and wicked lay had  raised the devil among us--and such was my confusion, that two or three  minutes elapsed ere I could take to my weapon.\"    \"Thou art but a cold and considerate friend,\" said the Saracen; \"and,  had the Hamako been one grain more frantic, thy companion had been slain  by thy side, to thy eternal dishonour, without thy stirring a finger in  his aid, although thou satest by, mounted, and in arms.\"    \"By my word, Saracen,\" said the Christian, \"if thou wilt have it in  plain terms, I thought that strange figure was the devil; and being of  thy lineage, I knew not what family secret you might be communicating to  each other, as you lay lovingly rolling together on the sand.\"    \"Thy gibe is no answer, brother Kenneth,\" said the Saracen; \"for know,  that had my assailant been in very deed the Prince of Darkness, thou  wert bound not the less to enter into combat with him in thy comrade's  behalf. Know, also, that whatever there may be of foul or of fiendish  about the Hamako belongs more to your lineage than to mine--this Hamako  being, in truth, the anchorite whom thou art come hither to visit.\"    \"This!\" said Sir Kenneth, looking at the athletic yet wasted figure  before him--\"this! Thou mockest, Saracen--this cannot be the venerable  Theodorick!\"    \"Ask himself, if thou wilt not believe me,\" answered Sheerkohf; and  ere the words had left his mouth, the hermit gave evidence in his own  behalf.    \"I am Theodorick of Engaddi,\" he said--\"I am the walker of the desert--I  am friend of the Cross, and flail of all infidels, heretics, and  devil-worshippers. Avoid ye, avoid ye! Down with Mahound, Termagaunt,  and all their adherents!\"--So saying, he pulled from under his shaggy  garment a sort of flail or jointed club, bound with iron, which he  brandished round his head with singular dexterity.    \"Thou seest thy saint,\" said the Saracen, laughing, for the first time,  at the unmitigated astonishment with which Sir Kenneth looked on the  wild gestures and heard the wayward muttering of Theodorick, who, after  swinging his flail in every direction, apparently quite reckless whether  it encountered the head of either of his companions, finally showed  his own strength, and the soundness of the weapon, by striking into  fragments a large stone which lay near him.    \"This is a madman,\" said Sir Kenneth.    \"Not the worse saint,\" returned the Moslem, speaking according to  the well-known Eastern belief, that madmen are under the influence  of immediate inspiration. \"Know, Christian, that when one eye is  extinguished, the other becomes more keen; when one hand is cut off,  the other becomes more powerful; so, when our reason in human things  is disturbed or destroyed, our view heavenward becomes more acute and  perfect.\"    Here the voice of the Saracen was drowned in that of the hermit, who  began to hollo aloud in a wild, chanting tone, \"I am Theodorick of  Engaddi--I am the torch-brand of the desert--I am the flail of the  infidels! The lion and the leopard shall be my comrades, and draw nigh  to my cell for shelter; neither shall the goat be afraid of their fangs.  I am the torch and the lantern--Kyrie Eleison!\"    He closed his song by a short race, and ended that again by three  forward bounds, which would have done him great credit in a gymnastic  academy, but became his character of hermit so indifferently that the  Scottish Knight was altogether confounded and bewildered.    The Saracen seemed to understand him better. \"You see,\" he said, \"that  he expects us to follow him to his cell, which, indeed, is our only  place of refuge for the night. You are the leopard, from the portrait  on your shield; I am the lion, as my name imports; and by the goat,  alluding to his garb of goat-skins, he means himself. We must keep him  in sight, however, for he is as fleet as a dromedary.\"    In fact, the task was a difficult one, for though the reverend guide  stopped from time to time, and waved his hand, as if to encourage them  to come on, yet, well acquainted with all the winding dells and passes  of the desert, and gifted with uncommon activity, which, perhaps, an  unsettled state of mind kept in constant exercise, he led the knights  through chasms and along footpaths where even the light-armed Saracen,  with his well-trained barb, was in considerable risk, and where the  iron-sheathed European and his over-burdened steed found themselves in  such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13775"],[0,"Every Step in Canning: The Cold-Pack Method (#11)"],[1,"y-five minutes if using pressure-cooker  outfit.

TOMATO ACID CHECKS BACTERIA    Some women who have canned soup tell me it spoiled or tasted \"sourish  and smelled sourish too.\" This is what we call \"flat sour.\" It may  happen to any vegetable you can, as well as to the soups. \"Flat sour\"  affects peas, beans, asparagus and corn more than other vegetables. If  the vegetables have been picked for some time and the bacteria have  had a chance \"to work,\" and you are not exceedingly careful about your  canning, you may develop \"flat sour\" in the soup. If you let one  little spore of this bacteria survive all is lost. Its moist growing  place is favorable to development, particularly if not much acid is  present. One little spore left in a jar will multiply in twenty hours  to some twenty millions of bacteria. This twenty million can stand on  the point of a needle, so a can could acquire quite a large population  in a short time. Bacteria do not like acids, so it is always a good  idea to have tomatoes in your soup mixture, and get the tomatoes into  the stone crock early in the game. The tomato acid will safeguard the  other vegetables which lack acid.    If you are careless about the blanching and cold-dipping--that is, not  doing these full time--if you work too slowly in getting the products  into jars and then let the full jars stand in the warm atmosphere, you  are pretty sure to develop \"flat sour.\"    Place each jar in the canner as it is packed. The first jars in will  not be affected by the extra cooking. Have the water just below the  boiling point as you put in each jar. When you have the canner full  bring the water to the boiling point as quickly as possible and begin  to count cooking or sterilizing time from the moment it does boil.    Some women make the mistake at the end of the cooking period of  letting the jars remain in the boiling water, standing on the false  bottom of the canner until they are cool enough to handle with no  danger of burning the hands. This slow method of cooling not only  tends to create \"flat sour,\" but it is apt to result in cloudy-looking  jars and in mushy vegetables.    For this reason you should have in your equipment a lifter with which  you can lift out the hot jars without the hands touching them. If you  use a rack with wire handles this answers the same purpose.    This \"flat sour,\" which is not at all dangerous from the standpoint of  health, must not be confused with the botulinus bacteria, which is an  entirely different thing.    \"Flat sour,\" perfectly harmless, appears often with inexperienced  canners. Botulinus, harmful, appears rarely. You need not be at all  alarmed about eating either \"flat sour\" or botulinus, because the odor  from spoiled goods is so distasteful--it really resembles rancid  cheese--that you would never get a spoon of it to your mouth.    If you are debating whether this jar or that jar of soup or vegetables  is spoiled, do not _taste_ the contents of the jar. _Smell_ it.  Tasting might poison you if you happened on the botulinus bacteria,  which is so rare it need alarm no one; whereas smelling is perfectly  safe.
