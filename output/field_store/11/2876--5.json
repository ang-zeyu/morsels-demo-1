Busybee) came in handy here. I  know the legion of Goa's five-star hotel GMs,  practicing and aspiring politicos, or even the  occasional industrialist locally mired in controversy  (like Dr. Jindal, of Meta Strips, the day after some  crude bombs went off at Vasco's St. Andrew's Church)  will not publicly admit the manner in which they rubbed  shoulders with St. Rajan!    I hear that the editor who brought a refreshing change  to the English-language print scene in Goa, has finally  been paid in the same coin he had paid many a  subordinate -- by making the subordinate's life so  miserable that there was no option but to resign.  Having known Rajan Narayan the way I did 20 years ago,  I have my doubts whether he will leave on his own. Of  course, he has already announced plans to publish a  weekly in Goa -- owned by the readers!! He knows the  Goan mindset all too well, and has already started  drumming up support via the Herald editorial columns  with typical (even if more virulent) anti-Hindutva,  pro-Cristao/Church writings that may border on the dangerous.    Of course, if and when Rajan Narayan does launch his  weekly, he will be infinitely better placed than the  Patrao, A.C. Fernandes was in the monsoon 1983. Let's  wish him luck!      Chapter 7:  The banyan tree: working under Rajan    Frederick NoronhaFrederick Noronha was part of the original batch of  trainees with the Herald during its re-launch in 1983.  In 1987, he became Goa correspondent for the Deccan  Herald. Since 1995, he has been a full-time freelance  journalist, writing mainly for the outstation media,  including the Indo-Asian News Service. He has an active  presence on the Internet, and has been for journalism  training to Germany and Sweden. He is founder of the  Goajourno, India-EJ and ThirdWorld-EJ mailing lists,  that seek to build collaborative networks among  journalists.    Reports or features critical of large companies are to  be avoided by and large. No report on a corporate  situation, however much it may be considered in the  public interest, shall be sent to the press without  prior clearance from the editor. We cannot afford to  antagonise potential advertisers. -- Editorial  guidelines, from Rajan Narayan, May 3, 1984.    Denying journalists the right to express his or her  views is like denying oxygen to a human being. -- Stray  Thoughts, by Rajan Narayan, September 2003, www.rajannarayan.com    AN ACTIVIST friend argues vehemently that this editor  single-handedly opens up space more than any other in  Goa. Some staff who worked under him have a sneering  you-don't-know-the-inside-story attitude. Others credit  the man with making them what they are. For the average  Goan Catholic, Rajan Narayan is virtually a hero in  real life, if not the newspaper equivalent of a patron saint.    Undeniably, this is the man who has shaped Goan  journalism for at least two decades, and has big plans  for more. Any venture to understand the contemporary  media in this small state would be incomplete without a  chapter on Rajan Narayan, who at the time of writing  (end-September 2003) has just announced his decision to  resign from the Herald.    This writer epitomises the love-hate relationship many  a journalist in Goa would share with someone who  suddenly descended on the Goan scene sometime in 1983.  Someone who has critically shaped the understanding of  Goa, including how we see ourselves and what are the  issues we define as important.    Clearly, Rajan -- by design or default -- has  contributed in significant manner to the Goa debate  over the past two decades. If one has to name the five  positive aspects of his legacy, it would be his ability  to extend the debate (by saying things no editor would  say); heading an organisation that, by design or  otherwise, actually gave a chance to many youngsters to  enter the profession; building up a till-now  sustainable alternative to the once arrogant lone  English-language daily in the state; giving space for  speedy growth to youngsters entering the profession  (even if, ironically, blocking that very growth later  on); and for taking on some of Goa's most sacred of cows.    But Rajan's ability to cast himself in the  'anti-Establishment' mould is equalled by his skills in  brokering deals (the recent track of contentious and  fast-confused charges over the Rs 300,000 government  sponsorship of the SARS campaign at Remo Fernandes'  50th birthday is a case in point, as are the  willingness to propose projects to a government that  are otherwise blasted from the editorial pulpit). This  rather personalised essay, obviously biased and clouded  by a string of personal experiences, seeks to narrate  one person's run-ins into Goa's most long-serving  editor. Perhaps from it could emerge a few snapshots  outlining how things really work in the Goa media.    ONE'S FIRST impressions of Rajan was meeting up with a  long-sleeve and tie-clad middle-aged 'uncle' during an  interview a month or two before the launch of the  English-language Herald in 1983. The location was in  the old balcony (now demolished) that stood almost over  today's Cafe Shanbhag, near the Panjim Municipal  Garden. Besides Rajan, also sitting in on the interview  was Valmiki Faleiro, who was egged on by the recent  public debate to tell his side of the story in another  chapter. (Devika Sequeira, then still in her 'twenties  but quite in command of the situation, willing to spend  extremely long hours and clear about what she expected  to bring out a thoroughly-worked on feature page or  front-page report as we later saw, had interviewed me  in an earlier round. Being quite thick-skinned, one  went in once again for another interview when  advertised subsequently, only to be told that it was  just as well one had returned, as the earlier  applications had got misplaced!)    In the second round of interviews, my first encounter  with Rajan, it took this then raw third-year college  kid quite some to gauge some clues about the identity  of this man shooting across the questions. Only a  syllable or two gave hint of his South Indian origins,  and with his formal clothes, he could have easily  passed off as a scion of a landed Goan family. Rajan  did seem a bit embarassed to make the offer of Rs 300  as the payment for a trainee sub-editor. But money  didn't matter, and the joy of becoming a journalist  while still in college more than sufficed. In any case,  this princely sum was thrice what one then irregularly  earned as an articled clerk to a chartered accountant.  This offer was made on the spot, and accepted as instantenously.    In no time, we got that that telegram calling on us to  join 'immediately'.    One recalls rushing into the colonial styled offices of  what was to become the Herald -- we then didn't even  know what the paper was to be called, whether it would  survive, who owned it, or whom we were working for.  Within minutes of each other, Bosco Souza Eremita of  Santa Cruz, Flavio Raposo of Carenzalem, Oswald Pinto  of Aldona and myself took up our seats on the bare  sub-editor's table, learning the basics of a profession  that some continued in. Bosco seemed to be  disillusioned that journalism offered so little scope  for creative writing; but he stayed on and worked his  way through Goa Today, Gomantak Times, the Portuguese  Lusa news agency, and the Jesuit-run UCAN, apart from  The Week and others publications. Flavio opted for a  life in academics. Oswald Pinto went across from one  form of reporting to another, and stuck with working at  the less-insecure 'reporting' section of the state  legislature. Reminiscing old times still brings back a  smile. We remain friends.    But this was not always the situation. You could argue  whether it's a Rajan-influenced legacy, but at our time  the staff would often be at loggerheads with one  another. It could have just been a faulty manner of  encouraging subordinates to improve in their  performance, but promises of promotions to more than  one candidate, and repeated if unfair comparisons with  one another, sometimes did leave strained relationships  among the staff that otherwise worked together fairly peacefully.    But there were the plusses for working in a fresh new  paper too. In the initial days, Rajan was almost a  godfather. \"How much are the $%#@$%s paying you?\" he  would sometimes ask juniors. Often, a recommendation  from him actually got translated into a raise.    He had his style of encouraging juniors. This, coupled  with the acute staff shortage at the Herald then and  frequent resignations from staff, meant a junior  sub-editor could get enough of an ego-boost to do the  front-page layout within a year or so of joining!    Talking about resignations, in the first four years of  its operation, the Rajan-edited Herald listings showed  that at least 30 journalists had left its rolls. Part  of this could have been due to the poor and  unsatisfactory compensation offered by a paper with  drew an infinitesimally tiny number of adverts compared  to today. Some left for better prospects; but  opportunities were few and far between anyway, then as  now. A few went on to continue their education; Alvis Fernandes,  one of the young men recruited through the informal  Miramar boys' network that proved to be a useful feeder  channel, was halfway through aeronautical engineering  anyway. But at least part of the resignations were  accounted for by the intrigue that dominated the place,  the growing curbs on free expression that could keep  the spark of idealism alive and politics enkindled  among the staff.    Among those who quit in the first four years were  Sushil Silvano (Deputy Editor), S.

But as a woodman sees green Ida rise      Pine above pine, and ponders which to fell      First of those myriads; even so I pause      Where to begin the chapter of his praise:      For thousand and ten thousand are the gifts      Wherewith high heaven hath graced the kingliest king.          Was not he born to compass noblest ends,      Lagus' own son, so soon as he matured      Schemes such as ne'er had dawned on meaner minds?      Zeus doth esteem him as the blessed gods;      In the sire's courts his golden mansion stands.      And near him Alexander sits and smiles,      The turbaned Persian's dread; and, fronting both,      Rises the stedfast adamantine seat      Erst fashioned for the bull-slayer Heracles.      Who there holds revels with his heavenly mates,      And sees, with joy exceeding, children rise      On children; for that Zeus exempts from age      And death their frames who sprang from Heracles:      And Ptolemy, like Alexander, claims      From him; his gallant son their common sire.      And when, the banquet o'er, the Strong Man wends,      Cloyed with rich nectar, home unto his wife,      This kinsman hath in charge his cherished shafts      And bow; and that his gnarled and knotted club;      And both to white-limbed Hebe's bower of bliss      Convoy the bearded warrior and his arms.          Then how among wise ladies--blest the pair      That reared her!--peerless Berenice shone!      Dione's sacred child, the Cyprian queen,      O'er that sweet bosom passed her taper hands:      And hence, 'tis said, no man loved woman e'er      As Ptolemy loved her. She o'er-repaid      His love; so, nothing doubting, he could leave      His substance in his loyal children's care,      And rest with her, fond husband with fond wife.      She that loves not bears sons, but all unlike      Their father: for her heart was otherwhere.          O Aphrodite, matchless e'en in heaven      For beauty, thou didst love her; wouldst not let      Thy Berenice cross the wailful waves:      But thy hand snatched her--to the blue lake bound      Else, and the dead's grim ferryman--and enshrined      With thee, to share thy honours. There she sits,      To mortals ever kind, and passion soft      Inspires, and makes the lover's burden light.      The dark-browed Argive, linked with Tydeus, bare      Diomed the slayer, famed in Calydon:      And deep-veiled Thetis unto Peleus gave      The javelineer Achilles. Thou wast born      Of Berenice, Ptolemy by name      And by descent, a warrior's warrior child.      Cos from its mother's arms her babe received,      Its destined nursery, on its natal day:      'Twas there Antigone's daughter in her pangs      Cried to the goddess that could bid them cease:      Who soon was at her side, and lo! her limbs      Forgat their anguish, and a child was born      Fair, its sire's self. Cos saw, and shouted loud;      Handled the babe all tenderly, and spake:          \"Wake, babe, to bliss: prize me, as Phoebus doth      His azure-sphered Delos: grace the hill      Of Triops, and the Dorians' sister shores,      As king Apollo his Rhenaea's isle.\"           So spake the isle. An eagle high overhead      Poised in the clouds screamed thrice, the prophet-bird      Of Zeus, and sent by him. For awful kings      All are his care, those chiefliest on whose birth      He smiled: exceeding glory waits on them:      Theirs is the sovereignty of land and sea.      But if a myriad realms spread far and wide      O'er earth, if myriad nations till the soil      To which heaven's rain gives increase: yet what land      Is green as low-lying Egypt, when the Nile      Wells forth and piecemeal breaks the sodden glebe?      Where are like cities, peopled by like men?      Lo he hath seen three hundred towns arise,      Three thousand, yea three myriad; and o'er all      He rules, the prince of heroes, Ptolemy.      Claims half Phoenicia, and half Araby,      Syria and Libya, and the AEthiops murk;      Sways the Pamphylian and Cilician braves,      The Lycian and the Carian trained to war,      And all the isles: for never fleet like his      Rode upon ocean: land and sea alike      And sounding rivers hail king Ptolemy.      Many are his horsemen, many his targeteers,      Whose burdened breast is bright with clashing steel:      Light are all royal treasuries, weighed with his.      For wealth from all climes travels day by day      To his rich realm, a hive of prosperous peace.      No foeman's tramp scares monster-peopled Nile,      Waking to war her far-off villages:      No armed robber from his war-ship leaps      To spoil the herds of Egypt. Such a prince      Sits throned in her broad plains, in whose right arm      Quivers the spear, the bright-haired Ptolemy.      Like a true king, he guards with might and main      The wealth his sires' arm won him and his own.      Nor strown all idly o'er his sumptuous halls      Lie piles that seem the work of labouring ants.      The holy homes of gods are rich therewith;      Theirs are the firstfruits, earnest aye of more.      And freely mighty kings thereof partake,      Freely great cities, freely honoured friends.      None entered e'er the sacred lists of song,      Whose lips could breathe sweet music, but he gained      Fair guerdon at the hand of Ptolemy.      And Ptolemy do music's votaries hymn      For his good gifts--hath man a fairer lot      Than to have earned much fame among mankind?      The Atridae's name abides, while all the wealth      Won from the sack of Priam's stately home      A mist closed o'er it, to be seen no more.      Ptolemy, he only, treads a path whose dust      Burns with the footprints of his ancestors,      And overlays those footprints with his own.      He raised rich shrines to mother and to sire,      There reared their forms in ivory and gold,      Passing in beauty, to befriend mankind.      Thighs of fat oxen oftentimes he burns      On crimsoning altars, as the months roll on,      Ay he and his staunch wife. No fairer bride      E'er clasped her lord in royal palaces:      And her heart's love her brother-husband won.      In such blest union joined the immortal pair      Whom queenly Rhea bore, and heaven obeys:      One couch the maiden of the rainbow decks      With myrrh-dipt hands for Hera and for Zeus.          Now farewell, prince! I rank thee aye with gods:      And read this lesson to the afterdays,      Mayhap they'll prize it: 'Honour is of Zeus.'          IDYLL XVIII.      The Bridal of Helen.        Whilom, in Lacedaemon,        Tript many a maiden fair      To gold-tressed Menelaus' halls,        With hyacinths in her hair:      Twelve to the Painted Chamber,        The queenliest in the land,      The clustered loveliness of Greece,        Came dancing hand in hand.      For Helen, Tyndarus' daughter,        Had just been wooed and won,      Helen the darling of the world,        By Atreus' younger son:      With woven steps they beat the floor        In unison, and sang      Their bridal-hymn of triumph        Till all the palace rang.        \"Slumberest so soon, sweet bridegroom?        Art thou o'erfond of sleep?      Or hast thou leadenweighted limbs?        Or hadst thou drunk too deep      When thou didst fling thee to thy lair?        Betimes thou should'st have sped,      If sleep were all thy purpose,        Unto thy bachelor's bed:      And left her in her mother's arms        To nestle, and to play      A girl among her girlish mates        Till deep into the day:--      For not alone for this night,        Nor for the next alone,      But through the days and through the years        Thou hast her for thine own.        \"Nay! heaven, O happy bridegroom,        Smiled as thou enteredst in      To Sparta, like thy brother kings,        And told thee thou should'st win!      What hero son-in-law of Zeus        Hath e'er aspired to be?      Yet lo! one coverlet enfolds        The child of Zeus, and thee.      Ne'er did a thing so lovely        Roam the Achaian lea.        \"And who shall match her offspring,        If babes are like their mother?      For we were playmates once, and ran        And raced with one another      (All varnished, warrior fashion)        Along Eurotas' tide,      Thrice eighty gentle maidens,        Each in her girlhood's pride:      Yet none of all seemed faultless,        If placed by Helen's side.        \"As peers the nascent Morning        Over thy shades, O Night,      When Winter disenchains the land,        And Spring goes forth in white:      So Helen shone above us,        All loveliness and light.        \"As climbs aloft some cypress,        Garden or glade to grace;      As the Thessalian courser lends        A lustre to the race:      So bright o'er Lacedaemon        Shone Helen's rosebud face.        \"And who into the basket e'er        The yarn so deftly drew,      Or through the mazes of the web        So well the shuttle threw,      And severed from the framework        As closelywov'n a warp:--      And who could wake with masterhand        Such music from the harp,      To broadlimbed Pallas tuning        And Artemis her lay--      As Helen, Helen in whose eyes        The Loves for ever play?        \"O bright, O beautiful, for thee        Are matron-cares begun.      We to green paths and blossomed meads        With dawn of morn must run,      And cull a breathing chaplet;        And still our dream shall be,      Helen, of thee, as weanling lambs        Yearn in the pasture for the dams      That nursed their infancy.        \"For thee the lowly lotus-bed        We'll spoil, and plait a crown      To hang upon the shadowy plane;        For thee will we drop down      ('Neath that same shadowy platan)        Oil from our silver urn;      And carven on the bark shall be        This sentence, 'HALLOW HELEN'S TREE';      In Dorian letters, legibly        For "]]]
