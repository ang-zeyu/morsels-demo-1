They amount  to more than he could have earned under me in a quarter of a year even  were he three times as industrious as he is! Now I know why he always  left off work two hours later than I every evening, and why, in spite of  that, he got up before me in the morning. But he soon saw that it all  did no good, or else that it was too much trouble for him and took too  long; so he embraced the opportunity when it presented itself!    CLARA.    You always believe the worst things you can of Carl! You have always  done so! I wonder if you still remember how--    ANTONY.    You talk as your mother would, and I will answer you as I used to answer  her--I will keep quiet!    CLARA.    And supposing Carl is acquitted? Supposing the jewels are found again?    ANTONY.    Then I would employ a lawyer and stake my last shirt to find out whether  or not the burgomaster was justified in throwing the son of an honest  citizen into prison. If he was, then I would submit; for a thing that  can befall anybody I also must accept with resignation. And if to my  misfortune it cost me a thousand times as much as it does others, I  would attribute it to fate. And if God struck me down for it, I would  fold my hands and say: \"Lord, Thou knowest why!\" If he was not  justified, if it should appear that the man with the gold chain around  his neck acted too hastily, because be thought of nothing except the  fact that the merchant who missed his jewels was his brother-in-law,  then people would find out whether the law has anywhere a gap in it,  whether the king, who doubtless knows that justice is the one demand his  subjects make in return for loyalty and obedience, and who least of all  would wish to remain under obligation to one of the humblest of them,  would allow that gap to remain unfilled. But all this is useless talk!  The boy has no more chance of coming through this trial unscathed, than  your mother has of rising from her grave alive! From him, neither now  nor ever shall I have any consolation! And for that reason do you not  forget what you owe me--keep your oath to me so that I shall not have to  keep mine to you! [_goes out, but returns again._] I shall come home  late tonight, for I am going out in the mountains to the old  lumber-dealer's. He is the only man who still looks me in the eye as he  used to, because he knows nothing of my disgrace. He is deaf; nobody can  tell him anything without yelling himself hoarse, and even then he hears  it all wrong.--So he finds out nothing!    [_Exit._]        SCENE II    CLARA (_alone_).    Oh, God! God! Have pity on me I Have pity on the old man! Take me to  Thee! There is no other way to help him! The sunlight lies like a golden  blanket on the street, and the children try to seize it with their  hands. The birds fly hither and thither, and the flowers and weeds do  not tire of growing higher. Everything is alive, everything wishes to be  alive! Oh, Death! Thousands of sick people are at this moment shuddering  with fear of thee! He who called for thee in the restless night, because  he could no longer endure his sufferings, now finds his bed soft and  downy again. I call upon thee! Spare him whose soul shrinks most  fearsomely from thee, and let him live until the beautiful world  becomes again gray and desolate! Take me in his stead! I shall not  shudder when thou givest me thy cold hand; I shall grasp it and follow  thee more bravely than ever yet a child of God has followed thee!        SCENE III    _Enter the Merchant,_ WOLFRAM.    WOLFRAM.    Good day, Miss Clara! Is your father at home?    CLARA.    He has just gone out.    WOLFRAM.    I have come--my jewels have been found!    CLARA.    Oh, father! Why are you not here?--He has forgotten his  spectacles--there they lie! Oh, if he only notices it and returns for  them!--How then? Where Who had them?    WOLFRAM.    My wife--tell me frankly, Miss: Have you ever heard anything strange  about my wife?    CLARA.    Yes!    WOLFRAM.    That she--[_Points to his brow._] Is that it?    CLARA.    That she is not altogether in her right mind, to be sure!    WOLFRAM (_bursting out_).    My God! My God! All in vain! Not a single  servant that I have ever taken into my house have I allowed to leave me;  to each one I have paid double wages and closed my eyes to all  remissness, in order to buy their silence! And yet--the false,  ungrateful creatures! Oh, my poor children! Only for your sake did I  seek to conceal it!    CLARA.    Do not blame your servants! Surely it is not their fault! Ever since  your neighbor's house burned down, and your wife stood at the open  window laughing and clapping her hands at the fire, yes, and even  puffing out her cheeks and blowing at it, as if she wanted to make it  burn more furiously, people have had to choose between taking her for  the devil himself or for a lunatic. And there were hundreds who saw  that!    WOLFRAM.    That is true. And now, since the whole town knows about my misfortune,  it would be foolish for me to exact a promise of you to keep still about  it! So listen! The theft for which your brother is in prison was  committed by a lunatic!    CLARA.    Your own wife!    WOLFRAM.    That she, who was once the noblest and most sympathetic soul in the  world, has become malicious and mischievous; that she shouts and screams  with joy when an accident happens before her eyes, when a maid breaks a  glass or cuts her finger--I knew that long ago; but that she also takes  things in the house and puts them out of sight, hides money and tears up  papers--that, alas! I found out too late--only this noon! I had laid  myself down on the bed and was just about to fall asleep, when I became  conscious that she had tiptoed noiselessly up beside me, and was  watching me intently to see if I were yet asleep. I closed my eyes  tighter. Then she took the key from the pocket of my vest, which was  hanging over a chair, unlocked my desk, took out a roll of gold pieces,  locked the desk again and put back the key. I was horrified! But I  restrained myself, so as not to disturb her. She went out of the room  and I crept after her on tiptoe. She climbed up to the attic and threw  the gold into an old chest, which has been standing there empty since  the days of my grandfather. Then she glanced timidly around the room,  and, without seeing me, hurried out again. I lighted a taper and  searched the chest; in it I found my youngest daughter's doll, a pair of  the maid's slippers, a ledger, several letters, and, alas! or, God be  praised!--which shall I say?--away down underneath, the jewels!    CLARA.    Oh, my poor mother! It is too terrible!    WOLFRAM.    God knows I would gladly sacrifice the jewelry if, by so doing, I could  undo what has already been done! But the fault is not mine! That my  suspicions, in spite of my profound respect for your father, fell on  your brother, was natural; he had polished the desk, and with him the  jewels had disappeared. I noticed it almost immediately, for I had  occasion to take some papers out of the drawer in which they lay. Still  it did not occur to me to take stringent measures to arrest him  immediately. Merely as a preliminary, I told Adam, the bailiff, about  the matter, and besought him to keep his investigations absolutely  secret. But he would not listen to the idea of sparing anybody; he  declared he must and would bring the case to court at once, for, he  said, your brother was a drunkard and a debt-contractor. And he has,  alas, so much influence with the burgomaster that he can put through  anything he wants to. The man seems to bear a bitter grudge against your  father--I do not know why, but it was impossible to soothe him; he held  his hands over his ears and called out, as he was hurrying away: \"If you  had given me the jewelry, it would not have made me as happy as this!\"    CLARA.    Once in the tavern the bailiff put his glass down on the table by my  father's and nodded to him as if he wanted to touch glasses with him. My  father then took his away, and said: \"People in red coats and blue  trimmings used to have to drink out of glasses with wooden feet. Also  they used to have to wait out in front of the window, or, if it was  raining, by the door, and respectfully remove their hats when the  landlord handed them the drink. Moreover, if they felt a desire to touch  glasses with anybody, they waited until neighbor Hangman happened in.\"  Oh, God! What is not possible in this world! My mother had to pay for  that with an untimely death!    WOLFRAM.    One should never anger anybody, and least of all bad people! Where is  your father?    CLARA.    In the mountains at the lumber-dealer's.    WOLFRAM.    I'll ride out and hunt him up. I have already been at the burgomaster's,  but unfortunately found him out. Otherwise your brother would be here  now. But the Secretary has already dispatched a messenger! You will see  him before evening! [_Exit._]        SCENE IV    CLARA (_alone_).    Now I should rejoice! Oh, God! And I can think of nothing except: Now it  is you alone! And yet I have a feeling as though something must occur to  me at once that would set everything right again!        SCENE V    _Enter, the_ SECRETARY.    SECRETARY.    Good day!    CLARA (_seizes a chair to keep from falling_).    He! Oh, if only _he_ had not come back!    SECRETARY. Your father is not at home?    CLARA.    No!    SECRETARY.    I bring you good news. Your brother--No, Clara, I cannot talk to you in  this formal way. All these tables, chairs, and cupboards that I know so  well--Good day, old friend!    [_He nods to a cup-board._]    How are you? You have not changed a bit!--around which we used to romp  as children--it seems to me they will put their heads together and  deride me as a fool, unless I quickly assume another tone. I must \"thou\"  you, as I used to do! If you do not like it, just say to yourself: The  big boy is dreaming, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13033"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 2 (#11)"],[1,"is sometimes a splendid sheet of water was obvious in its  line of shores. These were overhung on the south-western side by rocky  eminences which in some parts consisted of a red calcareous tuff  containing fragments of schist; in others, of trap-rock or basalt which  was very hard and black. The opposite shore was lower, with water-worn  cliffs of reddish clay. By these cliffs and the beaches of drifted sand  under them, we perceived that the prevailing winds in all times of high  flood came from the south-west; the north-east side being very different  from the opposite, which was free from sand and bore no such marks of  chaffing waves.    TRAP AND TUFF.    At two places the banks are so low that in high floods the water must  flow over them to the westward and supply, as I supposed, Campbell's  lake, called Goorongully, and that to the north-east of Regent's lake.  Upon the whole it appeared that the trap which originally elevated the  western shore had either partially subsided, or that it was connected  with a crater or cavity of which the only vestige is this lake. The  calcareous conglomerate was unlike any rock I had seen elsewhere,  consisting in part of a tuff resembling the matrix of the fossil bones  found in limestone fissures. It is also worthy of notice that it appears  in some low undulations which extend from the lake to the river, and that  the channel conveying the waters to the lake lies in a hollow between  them.    NATIVES THERE.    On first approaching the lake we saw the natives in the midst of the  water, gathering the mussels (unio). I sent Piper forward to tell them  who we were, and thus, if possible, prevent any alarm at our appearance.  It began to rain heavily as we rode round; and although detached parties  of gins on the south shore had taken fright, left their huts and run to  the main camp, I was glad to find, when we rode up, that they remained  quietly there, under cover from the heavy rain. These huts or gunyas  consisted of a few green boughs which had just been put up for shelter  from the rain then falling. The tribe consisted of about a hundred.    WOMEN.    The females and children were in huts at some distance from those of the  men. A great number sat huddled together and cowered down under each  gunya, their skinny limbs being so folded before their bodies that the  head rested upon the knees. Among the faces were some which, being  hideously painted white (the usual badge of mourning) grinned horribly;  and the whole was so characteristic a specimen of life among the  aborigines that the heavy rain did not prevent me from making a sketch.  While I was thus employed the natives very hospitably made a fire in a  vacant gunya, evidently for the purpose of warming poor Barney, our  guide, who seemed miserably cold, having no covering except a jacket,  thoroughly wet.    MEN.    The men were in general strong, healthy, and muscular, and among them was  one who measured six feet four inches, as we afterwards ascertained at  our camp. My chief object in visiting the lake was to cultivate a good  understanding with these natives in the hopes that one of them might be  induced to accompany me down the Lachlan. The facility with which Piper,  then at a distance of 200 miles from his native place, Bathurst,  conversed with these people showed that their dialects are not so varied  as is commonly believed; and I had little doubt that he would be  understood, even on the banks of the Darling.    THEIR ACCOUNT OF THE COUNTRY LOWER DOWN. OOLAWAMBILOA.    He ascertained from one of these natives of Regent's lake that after  eight of our daily journeys, according to his comprehension, the bed of  the Lachlan would contain no water, and that we must go to the right  across \"the middle,\" as Piper understood, reaching in four days more a  lagoon called Burrabidgin or Burrabadimba: that there I must leave the  carts and go with the native on horseback; and that in two days'  travelling at the rate we could then proceed, we should reach  Oolawambiloa, a very great water. They also said that water could be  found in the bush at the end of each of those four days' journey by one  of their tribe who would go with us and who had twice been at the great  water. All this news made me impatient to go on; but we had to remain a  day or two for the light cart. It rained heavily during the whole  afternoon; nevertheless a body of these natives accompanied us back,  keeping pace with our horses.    GAIETY OF THE NATIVES.    Each carried a burning torch of the resinous bark of the callitris, with  the blaze of which these natives seemed to keep their dripping bodies  warm, laughing heartily and passing their jokes upon us, our horses and  particularly upon our two guides of their own race, Piper and Barney, who  seemed anything but at home on horseback with wet clothes dripping about  them.    COLOUR LIGHT.    These natives were of a bright copper colour, so different from black  that one had painted his thighs with black chequered lines which made his  skin very much resemble the dress of a harlequin.    MR. STAPYLTON SURVEYS THE LAKE.    Mr. Stapylton proceeded with a party to make a survey of Cudjallagong  lake and creek, an operation which could be accomplished with less  inconvenience as that gentleman's equipment could not come up to us until  the 16th.    CAMPBELL'S LAKE.    He extended his survey to the small lake to the north-east, the first  discovered by Mr. Oxley and named by him Campbell's lake. Mr. Stapylton  found only a grassy plain without a drop of water. By an opening from  Cudjallagong lake he proceeded to another likewise seen by Mr. Oxley. It  had also become a verdant plain, nevertheless I thought it was necessary  to distinguish it on my map by its native name of Goorongully, as Mr.  Oxley had not supplied any to it.    April 15.    The sky had continued overcast although no rain fell after the evening of  the 13th. This day however the wind changed from north-west to west and  the sky became clear.    PIPER OBTAINS A GIN.    The surveying party returned from the lake by midday; and with it came  also Piper, my aboriginal interpreter, who had gone there chiefly with  the view of obtaining a gin, a speculation which I thought rather  hazardous on his part; yet, strange to say, a good strong woman marched  behind him into our camp, loaded with a new opossum-skin cloak, and  various presents, that had been given to Piper with her. How he contrived  to settle this important matter with a tribe to whom he was an utter  stranger could not be ascertained; for he left our party on the lake by  night, going quite alone to the natives, and returned from their camp in  the morning followed by his gin. To obtain a gin at Cudjallagong was the  great ambition of most of the natives we had left behind, among whom were  two, friends of Piper, whom I compelled to return, and who were most  anxious to accompany us that they might obtain wives at this place.    ASCEND GOULBURN RANGE.    April 16.    The morning was beautifully clear and I set out for the summit of  Goulburn range, named Yerrarar, fourteen miles distant from the camp. The  country we rode over was so thinly wooded that the hill was visible  nearly the whole way. The soil was good and firmer than the common  surface of the plains, the basis being evidently different, consisting  rather of trap than of the sandstone so prevalent elsewhere. At exactly  halfway we passed a hill of trap-rock, connected with a low range  extending towards still higher ground nearer Regent's lake, on the  eastern side. This was the first trap-rock I had seen besides that of the  lake during our whole journey down the Lachlan.    VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT.    On the summit I found hornstone and granular felspar. The whole of  Goulburn range consisted also of the same rock. It was rather  light-coloured, partially decomposed, and lay in rounded nodules and  boulders which formed however ridges across the slopes of the ground,  tending in general 12 or 14 degrees East of North. The hills were  everywhere rocky, so that the ascent cost us nearly an hour, and we were  forced to lead our horses; but it was well worth the pains for the summit  afforded a very extensive prospect. The most interesting feature in the  country was Regent's lake which, although fifteen miles distant, seemed  at our feet, reflecting like a mirror the trees on its margin; and on the  other side we looked into the unknown west, where the horizon seemed as  level as the ocean. In vain I examined it with a powerful telescope, in  search of some remote pic; only a level and thinly wooded country  extended beyond the reach even of telescopic vision.    With the spirit-level of my theodolite I found that the most depressed  part extended about due west by compass, a circumstance which first made  me imagine the Lachlan might have some channel in that direction.    WARRANARY.    Of the Mount Granard range I could see and intersect only that remarkable  cape-like point which was also the high land visible to the westward from  Mount Granard itself, being named Warranary by Barney. Closer to the  summit on which I stood were various ranges besides that of which it was  the highest point, but even this was not, strictly speaking, a range, for  it consisted on the southward of different masses, separated by portions  of low, level country.    A NEW CORREA.    I recognised many of my stations, such as Mount Cunningham, Bolloon,  Hurd's Pic, Mount Granard, etc. and having taken all the angles I could  with the theodolite, and gathered some specimens of a curious new  correa,* and a few bulbs of a pink-coloured amaryllis which grew on the  summit,** we descended and, just as it became quite dark, reached the  camp where I found that the men had arrived with Mr. Stapylton's light  cart, although his own horse, having strayed at Cordowe, did not  accompany it.
