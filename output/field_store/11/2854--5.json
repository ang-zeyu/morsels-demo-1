She could not tell him. He should be the  last in all the world to know. She went to her room and huddled into  bed.    Presently a knock came at her door, and her father's voice asked if  she were ill. She pleaded that she had a bad headache and wished to be  alone. He asked if she had seen Dan. By a great effort she managed to  reply that Dan had ridden to a neighbouring ranch. Her father left  the door without further question. Afterwards she heard him in the  distance singing his favourite mournful ballads. It doubled her sense  of woe and brought home the clinging fear. She felt that if she could  weep she might live, but otherwise her heart would burst. And after  hours and hours of that torture which burns the name of \"woman\" in the  soul of a girl, the tears came. The roosters announced the dawn before  she slept.    Late the next morning old Joe Cumberland knocked again at her door. He  was beginning to fear that this illness might be serious. Moreover, he  had a definite purpose in rousing her.    \"Yes?\" she called, after the second knock.    \"Look out your window, honey, down to Morgan's place. You remember I  said I was goin' to clean up the landscape?\"    The mention of Morgan's place cleared the sleep from Kate's mind and  it brought back the horror of the night before. Shivering she slipped  from her bed and went to the window. Morgan's place was a mass of  towering flames!    She grasped the window-sill and stared again. It could not be. It must  be merely another part of the nightmare, and no reality. Her father's  voice, high with exultation, came dimly to her ears, but what she saw  was Dan as he had laid there the night before, hurt, helpless, too  weak to move!    \"There's the end of it,\" Joe Cumberland was saying complacently  outside her door. \"There ain't goin' to be even a shadow of the saloon  left nor nothin' that's in it. I jest travelled down there this  mornin' and touched a match to it!\"    Still she stared without moving, without making a sound. She was  seeing Dan as he must have wakened from a swoonlike sleep with the  smell of smoke and the heat of rising flames around him. She saw him  struggle, and fail to reach his feet. She almost heard him cry out--a  sound drowned easily by the roar of the fire, and the crackling of the  wood. She saw him drag himself with his hands across the floor, only  to be beaten back by a solid wall of flame. Black Bart crouched beside  him and would not leave his doomed master. Fascinated by the raging  fire the black stallion Satan would break from the shed and rush into  the flames!--and so the inseparable three must have perished together!    \"Why don't you speak, Kate?\" called her father.    \"Dan!\" she screamed, and pitched forward to the floor.          CHAPTER IX      THE PHANTOM RIDER    In the daytime the willows along the wide, level river bottom seemed  an unnatural growth, for they made a streak of yellow-green across  the mountain-desert when all other verdure withered and died. After  nightfall they became still more dreary. Even when the air was calm  there was apt to be a sound as of wind, for the tenuous, trailing  branches brushed lightly together, making a guarded whispering like  ghosts.    In a small clearing among these willows sat Silent and his companions.  A fifth member had just arrived at this rendezvous, answered the quiet  greeting with a wave of his hand, and was now busy caring for his  horse. Bill Kilduff, who had a natural inclination and talent for  cookery, raked up the deft dying coals of the fire over which he had  cooked the supper, and set about preparing bacon and coffee for the  newcomer. The latter came forward, and squatted close to the cook,  watching the process with a careful eye. He made a sharp contrast with  the rest of the group. From one side his profile showed the face of  a good-natured boy, but when he turned his head the flicker of the  firelight ran down a scar which gleamed in a jagged semi-circle from  his right eyebrow to the corner of his mouth. This whole side of his  countenance was drawn by the cut, the mouth stretching to a perpetual  grimace. When he spoke it was as if he were attempting secrecy. The  rest of the men waited in patience until he finished eating. Then  Silent asked: \"What news, Jordan?\"    Jordan kept his regretful eyes a moment longer on his empty coffee  cup.    \"There ain't a pile to tell,\" he answered at last. \"I suppose you  heard about what happened to the chap you beat up at Morgan's place  the other day?\"    \"Who knows that _I_ beat him up?\" asked Silent sharply.    \"Nobody,\" said Jordan, \"but when I heard the description of the man  that hit Whistling Dan with the chair, I knew it was Jim Silent.\"    \"What about Barry?\" asked Haines, but Jordan still kept his eyes upon  the chief.    \"They was sayin' pretty general,\" he went on, \"that you _needed_ that  chair, Jim. Is that right?\"    The other three glanced covertly to each other. Silent's hand bunched  into a great fist.    \"He went loco. I had to slam him. Was he hurt bad?\"    \"The cut on his head wasn't much, but he was left lyin' in the saloon  that night, an' the next mornin' old Joe Cumberland, not knowin' that  Whistlin' Dan was in there, come down an' touched a match to the old  joint. She went up in smoke an' took Dan along.\"    No one spoke for a moment. Then Silent cried out: \"Then what was that  whistlin' I've heard down the road behind us?\"    Bill Kilduff broke into rolling bass laughter, and Hal Purvis chimed  in with a squeaking tenor.    \"We told you all along, Jim,\" said Purvis, as soon as he could control  his voice, \"that there wasn't any whistlin' behind us. We know you  got powerful good hearin', Jim, but we all figger you been makin'  somethin' out of nothin'. Am I right, boys?\"    \"You sure are,\" said Kilduff, \"I ain't heard a thing.\"    Silent rolled his eyes angrily from face to face.    \"I'm kind of sorry the lad got his in the fire. I was hopin' maybe  we'd meet agin. There's nothin' I'd rather do than be alone five  minutes with Whistlin' Dan.\"    His eyes dared any one to smile. The men merely exchanged glances.  When he turned away they grinned broadly. Hal Purvis turned and caught  Bill Kilduff by the shoulder.    \"Bill,\" he said excitedly, \"if Whistlin' Dan is dead there ain't any  master for that dog!\"    \"What about him?\" growled Kilduff.    \"I'd like to try my hand with him,\" said Purvis, and he moistened his  tight lips. \"Did you see the black devil when he snarled at me in  front of Morgan's place?\"    \"He sure didn't look too pleasant.\"    \"Right. Maybe if I had him on a chain I could change his manners some,  eh?\"    \"How?\"    \"A whip every day, damn him--a whip every time he showed his teeth at  me. No eats till he whined and licked my hand.\"    \"He'd die first. I know that kind of a dog--or a wolf.\"    \"Maybe he'd die. Anyway I'd like to try my hand with him. Bill, I'm  goin' to get hold of him some of these days if I have to ride a  hundred miles an' swim a river!\"    Kilduff grunted.    \"Let the damn wolf be. You c'n have him, I say. What I'm thinkin'  about is the hoss. Hal, do you remember the way he settled to his  stride when he lighted out after Red Pete?\"    Purvis shrugged his shoulders.    \"You're a fool, Bill. Which no man but Barry could ever ride that  hoss. I seen it in his eye. He'd cash in buckin'. He'd fight you like  a man.\"    Kilduff sighed. A great yearning was in his eyes.    \"Hal,\" he said softly, \"they's some men go around for years an'  huntin' for a girl whose picture is in their bean, cached away  somewhere. When they see her they jest nacherally goes nutty. Hal, I  don't give a damn for women folk, but I've travelled around a long  time with a picture of a hoss in my brain, an' Satan is the hoss.\"    He closed his eyes.    \"I c'n see him now. I c'n see them shoulders--an' that head--an', my  God! them eyes--them fire eatin' eyes! Hal, if a man was to win the  heart of that hoss he'd lay down his life for you--he'd run himself  plumb to death! I won't never sleep tight till I get the feel of them  satin sides of his between my knees.\"    Lee Haines heard them speak, but he said nothing. His heart also  leaped when he heard of Whistling Dan's death, but he thought neither  of the horse nor the dog. He was seeing the yellow hair and the blue  eyes of Kate Cumberland. He approached Jordan and took a place beside  him.    \"Tell me some more about it, Terry,\" he asked.    \"Some more about what?\"    \"About Whistling Dan's death--about the burning of the saloon,\" said  Haines.    \"What the hell! Are you still thinkin' about that?\"    \"I certainly am.\"    \"Then I'll trade you news,\" said Terry Jordan, lowering his voice so  that it would not reach the suspicious ear of Jim Silent. \"I'll tell  you about the burnin' if you'll tell me something about Barry's fight  with Silent!\"    \"It's a trade,\" answered Haines.    \"All right. Seems old Joe Cumberland had a hunch to clean up the  landscape--old fool! so he jest up in the mornin' an' without sayin' a  word to any one he downs to the saloon and touches a match to it. When  he come back to his house he tells his girl, Kate, what he done. With  that she lets out a holler an' drops in a faint.\"    Haines muttered.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Terry, a little anxiously.    \"Nothin,\" said Haines. \"She fainted, eh? Well, good!\"    \"Yep. She fainted an' when she come to, she told Cumberland that Dan  was in the saloon, an' probably too weak to get out of the fire. They  started for the place on the run. When they got there all they found  was a pile of red hot coals. So everyone figures that he went up in  the flames. That's all I know. Now what about the fight?\"    Lee Haines sat with fixed eyes.    \"There isn't much to say about the fight,\" he said at last.    \"The hell there isn't,\" scoffed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10890"],[0,"Dio's Rome, Volume 5 (#11)"],[1,"with the care of the boy and with the  oversight of the wardrobe, though a woman and of high rank; and she saw to  it that all were stripped of their possessions.    [Sidenote:--13--] Now Nero called Sporus Sabina not merely on account of  the fact that by reason of resemblance to her he had been made a eunuch,  but because the boy like the mistress had been solemnly contracted to him  in Greece, with Tigillinus to give the bride away, as the law ordained.  All the Greeks held a festal celebration of their marriage, uttering all  the customary good wishes (as they could not well help) even to the extent  of praying that legitimate children might be born to them. After that Nero  took to himself two bedfellows, Pythagoras to treat as a man and Sporus as  a woman. The latter, in addition to other forms of address, was termed  lady, queen, and mistress.    Yet why should one wonder at this, seeing that this monarch would fasten  naked boys and girls to poles, and then putting on the hide of a wild  beast would approach them and satisfy his brutal lust under the appearance  of devouring parts of their bodies? Such were the indecencies of Nero.    When he received the senators he wore a short flowered tunic with muslin  collar, for he had already begun to transgress precedent in wearing ungirt  tunics in public. It is stated also that knights belonging to the army  used in his reign for the first time saddle-cloths during their public  review.    [Sidenote:--14--] At the Olympic games he fell from the chariot he was  driving and came very near being crushed to death: yet he was crowned  victor. In acknowledgment of this favor he gave to the Hellanodikai the  twenty-five myriads which Galba later demanded back from them. [And to the  Pythia he gave ten myriads for giving some responses to suit him: this  money Galba recovered.] Again, whether from vexation at Apollo for making  some unpleasant predictions to him or because he was merely crazy, he took  away from the god the territory of Cirrha and gave it to the soldiers. In  fact, he abolished the oracle, slaying men and throwing them into the rock  fissure from which the divine _afflatus_ arose. He contended in every  single city that boasted any contest, and in all cases requiring the  services of a herald he employed for that purpose Cluvius Rufus, an  ex-consul. Athens and the Lacedaemonians were exceptions to this rule,  being the only places that he did not visit at all. He avoided the second  because of the laws of Lycurgus, which stood in the way of his designs,  and the former because of the story about the Furies.--The proclamation  ran: \"Nero Caesar wins this contest and crowns the Roman people and his  world.\" Possessing according to his own statement a world, he went on  singing and playing, making proclamations, and acting tragedies.    [Sidenote:--15--] His hatred for the senate was so fierce that he took  particular pleasure in Vatinius, who kept always saying to him: \"I hate  you, Caesar, for being of senatorial rank.\"--I have used the exact  expression that he uttered.--Both the senators and all others were  constantly subjected to the closest scrutiny in their entrances, their  exits, their attitudes, their gestures, their outcries. The men that stuck  constantly by Nero, listened attentively, made their applause distinct,  were commended and honored: the rest were both degraded and punished, so  that some, when they could endure it no longer (for they were frequently  expected to be on the _qui vive_ from early morning until evening),  would feign to swoon and would be carried out of the theatres as if dead.    [Sidenote:--16--] As an incidental labor connected with his sojourn in  Greece he conceived a desire to dig a canal across the isthmus of the  Peloponnesus, and he did begin the task. Men shrank from it, however,  because, when the first workers touched the earth, blood spouted from it,  groans and bellowings were heard, and many phantoms appeared. Nero himself  thereupon grasped a mattock and by throwing up some of the soil fairly  compelled the rest to imitate him. For this work he sent for a large  number of men from other nations as well.    [Sidenote:--17--] For this and other purposes he needed great sums of  money; and as he was a promoter of great enterprises and a liberal giver  and at the same time feared an attack from the persons of most influence  while he was thus engaged, he destroyed many excellent men. Of most of  these I shall omit any mention, merely saying that the stock complaint  under which all of them were brought before him was uprightness, wealth,  and family: all of them either killed themselves or were slaughtered by  others. I shall pause to consider only Corbulo and (of the Sulpicii  Scribonii) Rufus and Proculus. These two deserve attention because they  were in a way brothers and contemporaries, never doing anything separately  but united in purpose and in property as they were in family: they had for  a long time administered the affairs of the Germanies and had come to  Greece at the summons of Nero, who affected to want something from them. A  complaint of the kind which that period so prodigally afforded was lodged  against them. They could obtain no hearing on the matter nor even get  within sight of Nero; and as this caused them to be slighted by all  persons without exception, they began to long for death and so met their  end by slitting open their veins.--And I notice Corbulo, because the  emperor, after giving him also a most courteous summons and invariably  calling him (among other names) \"father\" and \"benefactor,\" then, as this  general approached Cenchrea, commanded that he be slain before he had even  entered his presence. Some explain this by saying that Nero was about to  sing with zither accompaniment and could not endure the idea of being seen  by Corbulo while he wore the long ungirded tunic. The condemned man, as  soon as he understood the import of the order, seized a sword, and dealing  himself a lusty blow exclaimed: \"Your due!\" Now for the first time in his  career was he ready to believe that he had done ill both in sparing the  zither-player and in going to him unarmed.    [Sidenote:--18--] This is the substance of what took place in Greece. Does  it add much to mention that Nero ordered Paris the dancer killed because  he wished to learn dancing from him and was disappointed? Or that he  banished Caecina Tuscus, governor of Egypt, for bathing in the tub that  had been specially constructed for his coming visit to Alexandria?    In Rome about this same time Helius committed many acts of outrage. One of  these was his killing of a distinguished man, Sulpicius Camerinus,  together with his son; the complaint against them was that whereas they  were called _Pythici_ after some of their ancestors they would not  abandon possession of this name, thus blaspheming Nero's Pythian victories  by the use of a similar title.--And when the Augustans offered to build a  shrine to the emperor worth a thousand librae, the whole equestrian order  was compelled to help defray the expense they had undertaken.--As for the  doings of the senate, it would be a task to describe them all in detail.  For so many sacrifices and days of thanksgiving were announced that the  whole year would not hold them all.    [Sidenote:--19--] Helius having for some time sent Nero repeated messages  urging him to return as quickly as possible, when he found that no  attention was paid to them, went himself to Greece on the seventh day and  frightened him by saying that a great conspiracy against him was on foot  in Rome. This news made him embark at double quick rate. There was some  hope of his perishing in a storm and many rejoiced, but to no purpose: he  came safely to land. And cause for destroying some few persons was found  in the very fact that they had prayed and hoped that he might perish.    [Sidenote: A.D. 68 (a.u. 821)] [Sidenote:--20--] So, when he marched into  Rome, a portion of the wall was torn down and a section of the gates  broken in, because some asserted that each of these ceremonies was  customary upon the return of garlanded victors from the games. First  entered men wearing the garlands which, had been won, and after them  others with boards borne aloft on spears, upon which were inscribed the  name of the set of games, the kind of contest, and a statement that \"Nero  Caesar first of all the Romans from the beginning of the world has  conquered in it.\" Next came the victor himself on a triumphal car in which  Augustus once had celebrated his many victories: he wore a vesture of  purple sprinkled with gold and a garland of wild olive; he held in his  hand the Pythian laurel. By his side in the vehicle sat Diodorus the  Citharoedist. After passing in this manner through the hippodrome and  through the Forum in company with the soldiers and the knights and the  senate he ascended the Capitol and proceeded thence to the palace.    [Sidenote: A.D. 68 (a.u. 821)] The city was all decked with garlands, was  ablaze with lights and smoky with incense, and the whole population,--the  senators themselves most of all,--kept shouting aloud: \"Vah, Olympian  Victor! Vah Pythian Victor! Augustus! Augustus! Hail to Nero the Hercules,  hail to Nero the Apollo!! The one National Victor, the only one from the  beginning of time! Augustus! Augustus! O, Divine Voice! Blessed are they  that hear thee!\"--Why should I employ circumlocutions instead of letting  you see their very words? The actual expressions used do not disgrace my  history: no, the concealment of none of them rather lends it distinction.    [Sidenote:--21--] When he had finished these ceremonies, he announced a  series of horse-races, and transferring to the hippodrome these crowns and  all the rest that he had secured by victories in chariot racing, he put  them about the Egyptian obelisk. The number of them was one thousand eight  hundred"]]]
