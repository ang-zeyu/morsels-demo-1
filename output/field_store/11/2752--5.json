The king,  however, possessed of great wisdom, and with mind under complete  control, actuated by the desire of doing good unto the world, again  resolved the matter in his mind, thinking of his own strength and  means, the circumstances of time and place and his income and  expenditure. For he knew that the wise never come to grief owing to  their always acting after full deliberation. Thinking that the  sacrifice should not be commenced, pursuant to his own resolution only,  Yudhishthira, carefully bearing upon his shoulder the weight of affairs  thought of Krishna that persecutor of all sinners as the fittest person  to decide the matter, in as much as he knew him to be the foremost of  all persons, possessed of immeasurable energy, strong-armed, without  birth but born amongst men from Will alone. Reflecting upon his  god-like feats the son of Pandu concluded that there was nothing that  was unknown to him, nothing that he could not achieve, and nothing that  he could not bear, and Yudhishthira, the son of Pritha, having come to  this settled resolution soon sent a messenger unto that master of all  beings, conveying through him blessings and speeches such as one senior  in age might send to one that is younger. And that messenger riding in  a swift car arrived amongst the Yadavas and approached Krishna who was  then residing in Dwaravati. And Achyuta (Krishna) hearing that the son  of Pritha had become desirous of seeing him, desired to see his cousin.  And quickly passing over many regions, being drawn by his own swift  horses, Krishna arrived at Indraprastha, accompanied by Indrasena. And  having arrived at Indraprastha, Janardana approached Yudhisthira  without loss of time. And Yudhisthira received Krishna with  paternal-affection, and Bhima also received him likewise. And Janardana  then went with a cheerful heart to his father's sister (Kunti). And  worshipped then with reverence by the twins, he began to converse  cheerfully with his friend Arjuna who was overjoyed at seeing him. And  after he had rested awhile in a pleasant apartment and had been fully  refreshed, Yudhishthira approached him at his leisure and informed him  all about the Rajasuya sacrifice.    \"Yudhishthira said,--'I have wished to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice.  That sacrifice, however, cannot be performed by one's wishing alone to  perform it. Thou knowest, O Krishna, even thing about the means by  which it may be accomplished. He alone can achieve this sacrifice in  whom everything is possible, who is worshipped everywhere and who is  the king of kings. My friends and counsellors approaching me have said  that I should perform that sacrifice. But, O Krishna, in respect of  that matter, thy words shall be my guide. Of counsellers some from  friendship do not notice the difficulties; others from motives of  self-interest say only what is agreeable. Some again regard that which  is beneficial to themselves as worthy of adoption. Men are seen to  counsel thus on matters awaiting decision. But thou, O Krishna, art  above such motives. Thou hast conquered both desire and anger. It  behoveth thee to tell me what is most beneficial to the world.'      SECTION XIV    (Rajasuyarambha Parva)    \"Krishna said,--'O great king, thou art a worthy possessor of all the  qualities essential for the performance of the Rajasuya sacrifice. Thou  knowest everything, O Bharata. I shall, however, still tell thee  something. Those persons in the world that now go by the name of  Kshatriyas are inferior (in everything) to those Kshatriyas that Rama,  the son of Jamadagnya, exterminated. O lord of the earth, O bull of the  Bharata race, thou knowest what form of rule these Kshatriyas, guided  by the instructions traditionally handed down from generation to  generation, have established amongst their own order, and how far they  are competent to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. The numerous royal  lines and other ordinary Kshatriyas all represent themselves to be the  descendants of Aila and Ikshwaku. The descendants of Aila, O king, as,  indeed, the kings of Ikshwaku's race, are, know O bull of the Bharata  race, each divided into a hundred separate dynasties. The descendants  of Yayati and the Bhojas are great, both in extent (number) and  accomplishments. O king, these last are to-day scattered all over the  earth. And all the Kshatriyas worship the prosperity of those monarchs.  At present, however, O monarch, king Jarasandha, overcoming that  prosperity enjoyed by their whole order, and overpowering them by his  energy hath set himself over the heads of all these kings. And  Jarasandha, enjoying the sovereignty over the middle portion of the  earth (Mathura), resolved to create a disunion amongst ourselves. O  monarch, the king who is the lord paramount of all kings, and in whom  alone the dominion of the universe is centered, properly deserves to be  called an emperor. And, O monarch, king Sisupala endued with great  energy, hath placed himself under his protection and hath become the  generalissimo of his forces. And, O great king, the mighty Vaka, the  king of the Karushas, capable of fighting by putting forth his powers  of illusion, waiteth, upon Jarasandha, as his disciple. There are two  others, Hansa and Dimvaka, of great energy and great soul, who have  sought the shelter of the mighty Jarasandha. There are others also  viz., Dantavakra, Karusha, Karava, Meghavahana, that wait upon  Jarasandha. He also that beareth on his head that gem which is known as  the most wonderful on earth, that king of the Yavanas, who hath  chastised Muru and Naraka, whose power is unlimited, and who ruleth the  west like another Varuna, who is called Bhagadatta, and who is the old  friend of thy father, hath bowed his head before Jarasandha, by speech  and specially by act. In his heart, however, tied as he is by affection  to thee, he regardeth thee as a father regardeth his child. O king,  that lord of the earth who hath his dominions on the west and the  south, who is thy maternal uncle and who is called Purujit, that brave  perpetuator of the Kunti race, that slayer of all foes, is the single  king that regardeth thee from affection. He whom I did not formerly  slay, that wicked wretch amongst the Chedis, who represented himself in  this world as a divine personage and who hath become known also as  such, and who always beareth, from foolishness, the signs that  distinguish me that king of Vanga Pundra and the Kiratas, endowed with  great strength, and who is known on earth by the names of Paundraka and  Vasudeva hath also espoused the side of Jarasandha. And, O king of  kings, Bhishmaka, the mighty king of the Bhojas--the friend of  Indra--the slayer of hostile heroes--who governs a fourth part of the  world, who by his learning conquered the Pandyas and the  Kratha-Kausikas, whose brother the brave Akriti was like Rama, the son  of Jamdagni, hath become a servitor to the king of Magadha. We are his  relatives and are, therefore, engaged everyday in doing what is  agreeable unto him. But although we regard him much, still he regardeth  us not and is engaged in doing us ill. And, O king, without knowing his  own strength and the dignity of the race to which he belongeth, he hath  placed himself under Jarasandha's shelter at sight of the latter's  blazing fame alone. And, O exalted one, the eighteen tribes of the  Bhojas, from fear of Jarasandha, have all fled towards the west; so  also have the Surasenas, the Bhadrakas, the Vodhas, the Salwas, the  Patachchavas, the Susthalas, the Mukuttas, and the Kulindas, along with  the Kuntis. And the king of the Salwayana tribe with their brethren and  followers; and the southern Panchalas and the eastern Kosalas have all  fled to the country of the Kuntis. So also the Matsyas and the  Sannyastapadas, overcome with fear, leaving their dominions in the  north, have fled into the southern country. And so all the Panchalas,  alarmed at the power of Jarasandha, have left their own kingdom and  fled in all directions. Some time before, the foolish Kansa, having  persecuted the Yadavas, married two of the daughters of Jarasandha.  They are called Asti and Prapti and are the sister of Sahadeva.  Strengthened by such an alliance, the fool persecuting his relatives  gained an ascendency over them all. But by this conduct he earned great  obloquy. The wretch also began to oppress the old kings of the Bhoja  tribe, but they, to protect themselves from the persecution of their  relative, sought our help. Having bestowed upon Akrura the handsome  daughter of Ahuka, with Sankarshana as my second I did a service to my  relatives, for both Kansa and Sunaman were slain by me assisted by  Rama. But after the immediate cause of fear was removed (by the death  of Kansa), Jarasandha, his father-in-law, took up arms. Ourselves  consisting of the eighteen younger branches of the Yadavas arrived at  the conclusion that even if we struck our enemies continually with  excellent weapons capable of taking the lives of the foes, we should  still be unable to do anything unto him even in three hundred years. He  hath two friends that are like unto the immortals, and in point of  strength the foremost of all men endued with might. They are called  Hansa and Dimvaka who are both incapable of being slain by weapons. The  mighty Jarasandha, being united with them, becomes incapable, I think,  of being vanquished by even the three worlds. O thou foremost of all  intelligent men, this is not our opinion alone but all other kings also  are of the same mind. There lived, O monarch, a king of the name of  Hansa, who was slain by Rama (Valadeva) after a battle of eighteen  days. But, O Bharata, hearing people say that Hansa had been killed,  Dimvaka, O king, thought that he could not live without Hansa. He  accordingly jumped into the waters of the Yamuna and killed himself.  Afterwards when Hansa, the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7978"],[0,"Legends, Traditions, and Laws of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, and History of (#10)"],[1,"second  nation, because you always give good counsel.    \"Seneca, and you, the people who have your habitation at the foot of the  _Great Mountain_, and are overshadowed by its crags, shall be the  third nation, because you are all greatly gifted in speech.    \"Cayuga, you, whose dwelling is in the _Dark Forest_, and whose home  is everywhere, shall be the fourth nation, because of your superior  cunning in hunting.    \"Mohawk, and you, the people who live in the open country, and possess  much wisdom, shall be the fifth nation, because you understand better the  art of raising corn and beans and making cabins.    \"You five great and powerful nations, with your tribes, must unite and  have one common interest, and no foes shall disturb or subdue you.    \"And you of the different nations of the south, and you of the west, may  place yourselves under our protection, and we will protect you. We  earnestly desire the alliance and friendship of you all.    \"And from you, Squaw-ki-haws (being a remote branch of the Seneca  Nation), being the people who are as the _Feeble Bushes_, shall be  chosen, a Virgin, who shall be the peacemaker for all the nations of the  earth, and more particularly the favored Ako-no-shu-ne, which name this  confederacy shall ever sustain. If we unite in one band the Great Spirit  will smile upon us, and we shall be free, prosperous and happy; but if we  shall remain as we are we shall incur his displeasure. We shall be  enslaved, and perhaps annihilated forever.    \"Brothers, these are the words of Hiawatha. Let them sink deep into your  hearts. I have done.\"    A deep and impressive silence followed the delivery of this speech. On  the following day the council again assembled to act on it. High wisdom  recommended this deliberation.    The union of the tribes into one confederacy was discussed and  unanimously adopted. To denote the character and intimacy of the union  they employed the figure of a single council-house, or lodge, whose  boundaries be co-extensive with their territories. Hence the name of Ako-  no-shu-ne, who were called the Iroquois.    The great bird which visited them from heaven brought a precious gift to  the warriors in the white plumes which she shed at the visit. Every  warrior, as he approached the spot where they fell, picked up a feather  of snowy white to adorn his crown; and the celestial visitant thus became  the means of furnishing the aspirants of military fame with an emblem  which was held in the highest estimation. Succeeding generations imbibed  the custom from this incident to supply themselves with a plumage  approaching it as nearly as possible; they selected the plume of the  white heron.    At the formation of the confederacy Ato-ta-rho, being considered next in  wisdom and all other traits of character which constitutes the necessary  qualifications of an honored Sachem, was ordained as the head Sachem of  the confederacy, which office has been transmitted down to succeeding  generations of the Onondaga Nation to the present time.    Hiawatha, the guardian and founder of the league, having now accomplished  the will of the Great Spirit, and the withdrawal of his daughter having  been regarded by him as a sign that his mission was ended, he immediately  prepared to make his final departure. Before the great council, which had  adopted his advice just before dispersing, he arose, with a dignified  air, and addressed them in the following manner:    \"Friends and Brothers:--I have now fulfilled my mission here below; I  have furnished you seeds and grains for your gardens; I have removed  obstructions from your waters, and made the forest habitable by teaching  you how to expel its monsters; I have given you fishing places and  hunting grounds; I have instructed you in the making and using of war  implements; I have taught you how to cultivate corn, and many other arts  and gifts. I have been allowed by the Great Spirit to communicate to you.  Last of all, I have aided you to form a league of friendship and union.  If you preserve this, and admit no foreign element of power by the  admission of other nations, you will always be free, numerous and happy.  If other tribes and nations are admitted to your councils, they will sow  the seed of jealousy and discord, and you will become few, feeble and  enslaved.    \"Friends and brothers, these are the last words you will hear from the  lips of Hiawatha. The Great Creator of our bodies calls me to go; I have  patiently awaited his summons; I am ready to go. Farewell.\"    As the voice of the wise man ceased, sweet strains of music from the air  burst on the ears of the multitude. The whole sky appeared to be filled  with melody; and while all eyes were directed to catch glimpses of the  sights, and enjoy strains of the celestial music that filled the sky,  Hiawatha was seen, seated in his snow-white canoe, amid the air,  _rising, rising_ with every choral chant that burst out. As he rose  the sound of the music became more soft and faint, until he vanished amid  the summer clouds, and the melody ceased. Thus terminated the labors and  cares of the long-cherished memory of Ta-ren-ya-wa-gon.    I will now resume the history of the sixth and last family, the Tuscarora  On-gwe-hon-wa, that were left at the Neuse river, or Gan-ta-no. Here they  increased in numbers, valor and skill, and in all knowledge of the arts  necessary in forest life. The country was wide and covered with dense  wilderness, large rivers and lakes, which gave shelter to many fierce  animals and monsters which beset their pathways and kept them in dread.  Now the Evil Spirit also plagued them with monstrous visitations. They  were often induced to change their locations; sometimes from fear of  enemies and sometimes from epidemics, or some strange visitations.    I will now relate a few of the monsters that plagued them: The first  enemy that appeared to question their power or disturb their peace was  the fearful phenomenon of Ko-nea-rah-yah-neh, or the flying heads. The  heads were enveloped in beard and hair, flaming like fire; they were of  monstrous size, and shot through the air with the speed of meteors. Human  power was not adequate to cope with them. The priests pronounced them a  flowing power of some mysterious influence, and it remained with the  priests alone to expel them by their magic power.    [Illustration: Flying head and woman sitting by the fire]    Drum and rattle and enchantments were deemed more effective than arrows  or clubs. One evening, after they had been plagued a long time with  fearful visitations, the flying head came to the door of a lodge occupied  by a single female and her dog. She was sitting composedly before the  fire roasting acorns, which, as they became cooked, she deliberately took  from the fire and ate. Amazement seized the flying head, who put out two  huge black paws from under his streaming beard. Supposing the woman to be  eating live coals he withdrew, and from that time he came no more among  them.    And they were also invaded by a still more fearful enemy, the Ot-nea-yar-  heh, or Stonish Giants. They were a powerful tribe from the wilderness,  tall, fierce and hostile, and resistance to them was vain. They defeated  and overwhelmed an army which was sent out against them, and put the  whole country in fear. These giants were not only of great strength, but  they were cannibals, devouring men, women and children in their inroads.    [Illustration: Stonish giant chasing indians.]    It is said by the Shawnees that these giants were descended from a  certain family which was journeying on the east side of the Mississippi.  After some of them had crossed the river on a vine it broke, which left  the main body on the east bank of the river. Those who were on the west  side of the river went toward the northwest. Being abandoned in their  wanderings, and being vagrants, without any knowledge of the arts of  life, they forgot the rules of humanity. They at first began to eat their  game in the raw flesh, which led them finally to become cannibals, and  they practiced to roll themselves in the sand, which caused their bodies  to be covered with a hard skin, so that the arrows of the Tuscaroras only  rattled against their rough bodies and fell at their feet. And the  consequence was, that they were obliged to bide in caves and glens, and  were brought into subjection by those fierce invaders for many winters.  At length the Holder of the Heavens visited his people, and finding that  they were in great distress, he determined to relieve them of these  barbarous invaders. To accomplish this he changed himself as into one of  those giants. As you will remember, it is said that he was able to change  himself into any shape that he wished. He then joined himself with the  invaders, and brandishing his heavy war club, led them on under the  pretence of finding the other five nations, which they were also in the  habit of visiting. When they came near to the strong fort at Onondaga,  they being weary of the long journey, and the night being dark, their  leader bade them lie down at the foot of a mountain until the customary  time to make the attack, which was at the break of day. But during the  night the Indian benefactor ascended the height and overwhelmed the  slumberers below with a vast mass of rocks. At this catastrophe only one  escaped to carry the news of their dreadful fate, and he fled toward the  north.    The Tuscaroras and the other five nations were so much troubled with  giants and other monsters that they were obliged to build forts to  protect themselves. The way they built them was always by selecting an  eminence, or rocky cliff, and on the back part was dug a trench according  to the plan of the fort. Then timbers were set in the trench upright,  projecting above the ground several feet, and being adjusted together as  close as possible, and the trench being filled in again."]]]
