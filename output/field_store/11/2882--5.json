Their contact and separation are controlled by a lever worked by a  very slight movement of the treadle. But the chief point of interest in  this device lies in the combination with the lever of a brake, enabling the  operator, by a simple reversal of the treadle's motion, to instantly  suspend the rotation of the machine. The forked lever, in fact, acts  simultaneously in throwing off the motion and applying the brake. The speed  is always in direct proportion to the pressure exerted upon the treadle,  and a single stitch can be made at will. Fig. 14 shows the friction wheel  separated, the portion a being fast, and e loose.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.]    [Illustration: FIG. 14.]    The Wheeler & Wilson company do not confine themselves to any particular  controller, but prefer the form shown here this evening (Fig. 15), in which  two bands and an intermediate pulley are employed. The first band is left  rather loose, and the machine is set in motion by the tightening of this  band through the depression of the treadle. The speed varies in proportion  to the pressure applied, and the sensitiveness of the arrangement is  increased by a brake device coming into play by the reversal of the treadle  as before.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.]    Messrs. Willcox & Gibbs depend upon a similar device shown in three  varieties to-night.    _Speed of Power Sewing Machines_.--The fastest practicable speed of a  machine worked by the foot appears to be 1,000 stitches per minute. Most  operators can guide the work at a much higher rate, especially in tailoring  or on long seams. The average speed upon such work is 1,200 stitches per  minute; but many lock-stitch machines are run at 1,500 and 1,800 per  minute, and even at much higher rates. There is always a limit to be  imposed upon speed by the guiding powers of hand and eye; it is this limit,  and not the capability of the machine, that confines the rate of driving.  Willcox & Gibbs' single thread machines are run in many instances at 3,500  stitches per minute. We have before us a single thread Singer machine  (appropriately named the \"Lightning Sewer\") and a Willcox machine, moving  at the enormous rate of 4,500 stitches per minute, and producing good work.  But it is doubtful whether such very great velocities can ever be  advantageously employed. Upon collar work, and in sewing boot uppers, the  rate seldom rises above 1,200 with advantage. If the machines be speeded  too high in any trade, the operator never uses the excess, and it only  proves a drawback. I seen the heaviest and hardest kind of navy boots  stitched at 1,500 to the minute upon Singer's lock-stitch machines. Wheeler  & Wilson's No. 10 D machine has been run by them, I am informed, as high as  2,500 to the minute. Loop-stitch machines, when well made, can be actually  run as high as 6,000, but 4,500 is, I believe, the maximum yet used for  this class of machine, even experimentally. There can be no doubt that  lock-stitch machines can be run as high as 3,000. The actual speeds of the  lock-stitch machines shown here upon the power stand average 1,300; those  of the chain stitch machines vary from 1,200 for the sack sewing machine to  4,500 for the small or single chain stitchers. Any of the latest styles of  either lock stitch or single thread machines can be run far faster than any  known expert operator can possibly guide the work under it.    It is very improbable that such speeds will ever be exceeded. The limit has  no doubt been reached. Very high speed is generally a delusion, and either  results in indifferent work, or actually retards its progress. Some idea of  the speed of the single thread machines now shown may be gathered from the  fact that, running at 4,500, and making eight stitches to the inch, they  accomplish over fourteen yards of sewing every minute.    Of special machines of interest, and which are too unwieldy to be shown  here, I am enabled to exhibit a few photographs.    One of the most novel of these is the \"Twin\" machine, designed by the  Singer company for the connecting together of the Jacquard cards used in  lace machines. The operation was formerly performed by hand. It is now done  by machine at less cost. The cards are placed upon a feeding drum, and fed  beneath a pair of needles. The laces forming the connection between the  cards are fed above and beneath, in line with the needles, and the whole is  easily stitched together. An extension of the same device is the multiple  machine, in which four needles and shuttles are used, sewing all the four  seams at one operation. This method of linking the cards is considered  better than similar work done by hand.    Of Wheeler & Wilson's new factory, at Bridgeport, and of the Singer  company's great new factory near Glasgow, I am enabled to exhibit  photographic views.    Before drawing my remarks to a close, I would briefly indicate the nature  of the various machines shown upon the power benching. Of the Singer  system, there are four. A drop-feed oscillating shuttle machine for  manufacturing purposes; a wheel-feed oscillating shuttle machine, furnished  with a trimmer, used chiefly in stitching leather and boot uppers; double  chain-stitch machine, used for sack making, now shown for the first time;  and a single thread \"Lightning Sewer,\" fitted with a trimmer for hosiery  work. Of Wheeler & Wilson's system, there is a drop-feed manufacturing  machine with the new detached hook and latest improvements; a No. 10  machine with the usual hook, a wheel feed and trimmer, and a smaller  machine of the same type with drop feed. Of Willcox & Gibbs' system, there  is the ordinary single-thread machine for manufacturing, a single-thread  machine, with a trimmer, as used in the hosiery trades, and a machine  specially used for straw hat making.    We have here a small Singer machine, riding upon the edge of two pieces of  carpet, a carpet machine weighing ten pounds. When the handle is turned, it  stitches and travels over the edges, uniting them faster and more securely  than six hand sewers; and several others, representative of the family type  of sewing machine, besides Wheeler & Wilson's hemstitch machine, the  working of which is of much interest.    I would now invite those of you who seek a better acquaintance with those  curious and novel machines to freely examine and test the various types to  be found upon the power benching and upon stands. One or two operators will  come forward and show some of the capabilities of the machines upon actual  work, in which the making of a straw hat will perhaps show what can be done  in a few minutes by quick speed and expert fingers; but these performances  must not be regarded in the light of competitive tests between the  manufacturers showing them, and are intended merely to show the utility of  motive power driving.    In conclusion, I desire to thank those gentlemen at the head of the leading  firms of sewing machine manufacturers for the trouble they have taken to  arrange for your inspection specimens of their excellent systems, and I  have much satisfaction in expressing my obligations to them for ready  assistance in the preparation of my paper.           *       *       *       *       *    Power machines and treadle machines were exhibited by Messrs. Willcox &  Gibbs, Messrs. Wheeler & Wilson, and the Singer Manufacturing Company. The  motive power was provided by an electrical motor, supplied by Mr. Moritz  Immish. The Howe Machine Company exhibited a model of the first machine  made by Elias Howe, and also one of the most recent Howe machines. Mr.  Newton Wilson showed a model of the Saint sewing machines, constructed from  Thomas Saint's patent specification, 1790, and Mr. Carver showed the  Standard sewing machine.           *       *       *       *       *          THE NEW KRUPP GUNS.      Nothing is being talked about at present in Germany but the guns of great  caliber that are manufacturing at the celebrated works on the banks of the  Ruhr. As our neighbors appear to be elated over this wonderful work, it is  expedient to examine the subject, in order to see whether their applause is  legitimate.    We have known for a long time that the artillery _materiel_ devoted to the  defense of the German coasts consists of a long, stationary 53/4 inch gun; of  long 73/4 inch hooped steel guns, closed by a cylindrico-prismatic wedge; of  an 8 inch mortar; and of guns of 113/4 and 15 inch caliber. The 113/4 inch gun  is 22 feet in length, and, including the closing mechanism, weighs 79,200  pounds. As regards the projectiles that this weapon throws, the _ordinary_  shell is 33 inches in length, and weighs, all charged, 656 pounds, and the  _exploding_ shell, of the same length, weighs, all charged, 1,160 pounds.  The initial velocity of the latter is 1,600 feet with a maximum charge of  148 pounds of powder.    The 15 inch gun is 32.8 feet in length, and weighs 158,400 pounds. Its  projectiles are 3.67 feet in length. The _ordinary_ shell, charge included,  weighs 1,400 pounds, and the exploding shell, under the same circumstances,  1,700 pounds, that is, more than three quarters of a metric ton. The  initial velocity of this last named projectile is 1,650 feet with a maximum  charge of 1,650 pounds of powder. We also know that Mr. Krupp has two  models of guns of 131/2 inch caliber, and of a length equal to 35 times the  caliber, say 39-5/12 feet. The lighter of these models (which was shown at  Anvers) weighs no less than 264,000 pounds, carriage not included. Its  cylindrico prismatic closing mechanism (_Rundkeilverschluss_) alone weighs  82,500 pounds. This is the weight of a 53/4 inch hooped steel gun!    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--NEW 52 FOOT KRUPP GUN AND A GERMAN FIELD PIECE  FIGURED ON THE SAME SCALE.]    We now learn that the Essen works have just begun the manufacture of a  314,600 pound gun. This piece,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1167"],[0,"A Strange Disappearance (#11)"],[1,"of having  attempted to destroy in this way I cannot say, but which I thankfully  put in my pocket against the day it might be required as proof.    Discerning nothing more in that quarter inviting interest, I asked  myself if I had nerve to descend into the cellar. Finally concluding  that that was more than could be expected from any man in my position, I  gave one look of farewell to the damp and desolate walls about me, then  with a breath of relief jumped from the kitchen window again into the  light and air of day. As I did so I could swear I heard a door within  that old house swing on its hinges and softly close. With a thrill I  recognized the fact that it came from the cellar.                            *      *      *      *    My thoughts on the road back to Melville were many and conflicting.  Chief above them all, however, rose the comfortable conclusion that in  the pursuit of one mysterious affair, I had stumbled, as is often the  case, upon the clue to another of yet greater importance, and by so  doing got a start that might yet redound greatly to my advantage. For  the reward offered for the recapture of the Schoenmakers was large, and  the possibility of my being the one to put the authorities upon their  track, certainly appeared after this day's developements, open at least  to a very reasonable hope. At all events I determined not to let the  grass grow under my feet till I had informed the Superintendent of what  I had seen and heard that day in the old haunt of these two escaped  convicts.    Arrived at the public house in Melville, and learning that Mr. Blake had  safely returned there an hour before, I drew the landlord to one side  and asked what he could tell me about that old house of the two noted  robbers Schoenmaker, I had passed on my way back among the hills.    \"Wa'al now,\" replied he, \"this is curious. Here I've just been answering  the gentleman up stairs a heap of questions concerning that self same  old place, and now you come along with another batch of them; just as  if that rickety old den was the only spot of interest we had in these  parts.\"    \"Perhaps that may be the truth,\" I laughed. \"Just now when the papers  are full of these rogues, anything concerning them must be of superior  interest of course.\" And I pressed him again to give me a history of the  house and the two thieves who had inhabited it.    \"Wa'al,\" drawled he \"'taint much we know about them, yet after all it  may be a trifle too much for their necks some day. Time was when nobody  thought especial ill of them beyond a suspicion or so of their being  somewhat mean about money. That was when they kept an inn there, but  when the robbery of the Rutland bank was so clearly traced to them,  more than one man about here started up and said as how they had  always suspected them Shoenmakers of being villains, and even hinted at  something worse than robbery. But nothing beyond that one rascality has  yet been proved against them, and for that they were sent to jail for  twenty years as you know. Two months ago they escaped, and that is the  last known of them. A precious set, too, they are; the father being only  so much the greater rogue than the son as he is years older.\"    \"And the inn? When was that closed?\"    \"Just after their arrest.\"    \"Has'nt it been opened since?\"    \"Only once when a brace of detectives came up from Troy to investigate,  as they called it.\"    \"Who has the key?\"    \"Ah, that's more than I can tell you.\"    I dared not ask how my questions differed from those of Mr. Blake, nor  indeed touch upon that point in any way. I was chiefly anxious now  to return to New York without delay; so paying my bill I thanked the  landlord, and without waiting for the stage, remounted my horse and  proceeded at once to Putney where I was fortunate enough to catch the  evening train. By five o'clock next morning I was in New York where I  proceeded to carry out my programme by hastening at once to headquarters  and reporting my suspicions regarding the whereabouts of the  Schoenmakers. The information was received with interest and I had  the satisfaction of seeing two men despatched north that very day with  orders to procure the arrest of the two notable villains wherever found.        CHAPTER VIII. A WORD OVERHEARD      That evening I had a talk with Fanny over the area gate. She came out  when she saw me approach, with her eyes staring and her whole form in a  flutter.    \"O,\" she cried, \"such things as I have heard this day!\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"what? let me hear too.\" She put her hand on her heart.  \"I never was so frightened,\" whispered she, \"I thought I should have  fainted right away. To hear that elegant lady use such a word as  crime,--\"    \"What elegant lady?\" interrupted I. \"Don't begin in the middle of your  story, that's a good girl; I want to hear it all.\"    \"Well,\" said she, calming down a little, \"Mrs. Daniels had a visitor  to-day, a lady. She was dressed--\"    \"O, now,\" interrupted I for the second time, \"you can leave that out.  Tell me what her name was and let the fol-de-rols go.\"    \"Her name?\" exclaimed the girl with some sharpness, \"how should I know  her name; she did'nt come to see me.\"    \"How did she look then? You saw her I suppose?\"    \"And was'nt that what I was telling you, when you stopped me. She looked  like a queen, that she did; as grand a lady as ever I see, in her velvet  dress sweeping over the floor, and her diamonds as big as--\"    \"Was she a dark woman?\" I asked.    \"Her hair was black and so were her eyes, if that is what you mean.\"    \"And was she very tall and proud looking?\"    The girl nodded. \"You know her?\" whispered she.    \"No,\" said I, \"not exactly; but I think I can tell who she is. And so  she called to-day on Mrs. Daniels, did she.\"    \"Yes, but I guess she knew master would be home before she got away.\"    \"Come,\" said I, \"tell me all about it; I'm getting impatient.\"    \"And ain't I telling you?\" said she. \"It was about three o'clock this  afternoon, the time I go up stairs to dress, so I just hangs about in  the hall a bit, near the parlor door, and I hear her gossiping with Mrs.  Daniels almost as if she was an old friend, and Mrs. Daniels answering  her mighty stiffly and as if she was'nt glad to see her at all. But the  lady didn't seem to mind, but went on talking as sweet as honey, and  when they came out, you would have thought she loved the old woman like  a sister to see her look into her face and say something about knowing  how busy she was, but that it would give her so much pleasure if she  would come some day to see her and talk over old times. But Mrs. Daniels  was'nt pleased a bit and showed plain enough she did'nt like the lady,  fine as she was in her ways. She was going to answer her too, but just  then the front door opened and Mr. Blake with his satchel in his hand,  came into the house. And how he did start, to be sure, when he saw them,  though he tried to say something perlite which she did'nt seem to take  to at all, for after muttering something about not expecting to see him,  she put her hand on the knob and was going right out. But he stopped her  and they went into the parlor together while Mrs. Daniels stood staring  after them like one mad, her hand held out with his bag and umbrella in  it, stiff as a statter in the Central Park. She did'nt stand so long,  though, but came running down the hall, as if she was bewitched. I was  dreadful flustered, for though I was hid behind the wall that juts out  there by the back stairs, I was afraid she would see me and shame me  before Mr. Blake. But she passed right by and never looked up. 'There is  something dreadful mysterious in this,' thought I, and I just made up  my mind to stay where I was till Mr. Blake and the lady should come out  again from the parlor. I did'nt have to wait very long. In a few minutes  the door opened and they stepped out, he ahead and she coming after. I  thought this was queer, he is always so dreadful perlite in his ways,  but I thought it was a deal queerer when I saw him go up the front  stairs, she hurrying after, looking I cannot tell you how, but awful  troubled and anxious, I should say.    \"They went into that room of his he calls his studio and though I knew  it might cost me my place if I was found out, I could'nt help following  and listening at the keyhole.\"    \"And what did you hear?\" I asked, for she paused to take breath.    \"Well, the first thing I heard was a cry of pleasure from her, and the  words, 'You keep that always before you? You cannot dislike me, then, as  much as you pretend.' I don't know what she meant nor what he did, but  he stepped across the room and I heard her cry out this time as if she  was hurt as well as awful surprised; and he talked and talked, and I  could'nt catch a word, he spoke so low; and by and by she sobbed just a  little, and I got scared and would have run away but she cried out with  a kind of shriek, 'O, don't say any more; to think that crime should  come into our family, the proudest in the land. How could you, Holman,  how could you.' Yes,\" the girl went on, flushing in her excitement till  she was as red as the cherry ribbons in her cap, \"those were the very  words she used: 'To think that crime should come into our family! the  proudest one in the land!' And she called him by his first name, and  asked him how he could do it.\"    \"And what did Mr. Blake say?\" returned I, a little taken back myself at  this result of my efforts with Fanny.    \"O, I did'nt wait to hear. I did'nt wait for anything. If folks was  going to talk about such things as that, I thought I had better be  anywhere than listening at the keyhole. I went right up stairs I can  tell you.\"    \"And whom have you told of what you heard in the half dozen hours that  have gone by?\"    \"Nobody; how could you think so mean of me when I promised, and--\"    It is not necessary to go any further into this portion"]]]
