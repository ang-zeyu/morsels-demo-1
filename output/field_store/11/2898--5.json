But when I came to think about it I remembered that Mrs. Schallibaum had  shown some anxiety to prevent the patient from talking. She had  interrupted him more than once, and had on two occasions broken in when  he seemed to be about to ask me some question. I was \"mistaken\" about  something. What was that something that he wanted to tell me?    It had struck me as singular that there should be no coffee in the  house, but a sufficiency of tea. Germans are not usually tea-drinkers  and they do take coffee. But perhaps there was nothing in this. Rather  more remarkable was the invisibility of the coachman. Why could he not  be sent to fetch the coffee, and why did not he, rather than the  housekeeper, come to take the place of Mr. Weiss when the latter had to  go away.    There were other points, too. I recalled the word that sounded like  \"Pol'n,\" which Mr. Graves had used in speaking to the housekeeper.  Apparently it was a Christian name of some kind; but why did Mr. Graves  call the woman by her Christian name when Mr. Weiss addressed her  formally as Mrs. Schallibaum? And, as to the woman herself: what was the  meaning of that curious disappearing squint? Physically it presented no  mystery. The woman had an ordinary divergent squint, and, like many  people, who suffer from this displacement, could, by a strong muscular  effort, bring the eyes temporarily into their normal parallel position.  I had detected the displacement when she had tried to maintain the  effort too long, and the muscular control had given way. But why had she  done it? Was it only feminine vanity--mere sensitiveness respecting a  slight personal disfigurement? It might be so; or there might be some  further motive. It was impossible to say.    Turning this question over, I suddenly remembered the peculiarity of Mr.  Weiss's spectacles. And here I met with a real poser. I had certainly  seen through those spectacles as clearly as if they had been plain  window-glass; and they had certainly given an inverted reflection of the  candle-flame like that thrown from the surface of a concave lens. Now  they obviously could not be both flat and concave; but yet they had the  properties peculiar to both flatness and concavity. And there was a  further difficulty. If I could see objects unaltered through them, so  could Mr. Weiss. But the function of spectacles is to alter the  appearances of objects, by magnification, reduction or compensating  distortion. If they leave the appearances unchanged they are useless. I  could make nothing of it. After puzzling over it for quite a long time,  I had to give it up; which I did the less unwillingly inasmuch as the  construction of Mr. Weiss's spectacles had no apparent bearing on the  case.    On arriving home, I looked anxiously at the message-book, and was  relieved to find that there were no further visits to be made. Having  made up a mixture for Mr. Graves and handed it to the coachman, I raked  the ashes of the surgery fire together and sat down to smoke a final  pipe while I reflected once more on the singular and suspicious case in  which I had become involved. But fatigue soon put an end to my  meditations; and having come to the conclusion that the circumstances  demanded a further consultation with Thorndyke, I turned down the gas to  a microscopic blue spark and betook myself to bed.          Chapter IV    The Official View      I rose on the following morning still possessed by the determination to  make some oportunity during the day to call on Thorndyke and take his  advice on the now urgent question as to what I was to do. I use the word  \"urgent\" advisedly; for the incidents of the preceding evening had left  me with the firm conviction that poison was being administered for some  purpose to my mysterious patient, and that no time must be lost if his  life was to be saved. Last night he had escaped only by the narrowest  margin--assuming him to be still alive--and it was only my unexpectedly  firm attitude that had compelled Mr. Weiss to agree to restorative  measures.    That I should be sent for again I had not the slightest expectation. If  what I so strongly suspected was true, Weiss would call in some other  doctor, in the hope of better luck, and it was imperative that he  should be stopped before it was too late. This was my view, but I meant  to have Thorndyke's opinion, and act under his direction, but        \"The best laid plans of mice and men     Gang aft agley.\"    When I came downstairs and took a preliminary glance at the rough  memorandum-book, kept by the bottle-boy, or, in his absence, by the  housemaid, I stood aghast. The morning's entries looked already like a  sample page of the Post Office directory. The new calls alone were more  than equal to an ordinary day's work, and the routine visits remained to  be added. Gloomily wondering whether the Black Death had made a sudden  reappearance in England, I hurried to the dining-room and made a hasty  breakfast, interrupted at intervals by the apparition of the bottle-boy  to announce new messages.    The first two or three visits solved the mystery. An epidemic of  influenza had descended on the neighbourhood, and I was getting not only  our own normal work but a certain amount of overflow from other  practices. Further, it appeared that a strike in the building trade had  been followed immediately by a widespread failure of health among the  bricklayers who were members of a certain benefit club; which accounted  for the remarkable suddenness of the outbreak.    Of course, my contemplated visit to Thorndyke was out of the question. I  should have to act on my own responsibility. But in the hurry and rush  and anxiety of the work--for some of the cases were severe and even  critical--I had no opportunity to consider any course of action, nor  time to carry it out. Even with the aid of a hansom which I chartered,  as Stillbury kept no carriage, I had not finished my last visit until  near on midnight, and was then so spent with fatigue that I fell asleep  over my postponed supper.    As the next day opened with a further increase of work, I sent a  telegram to Dr. Stillbury at Hastings, whither he had gone, like a wise  man, to recruit after a slight illness. I asked for authority to engage  an assistant, but the reply informed me that Stillbury himself was on  his way to town; and to my relief, when I dropped in at the surgery for  a cup of tea, I found him rubbing his hands over the open day-book.    \"It's an ill wind that blows nobody good,\" he remarked cheerfully as we  shook hands. \"This will pay the expenses of my holiday, including you.  By the way, you are not anxious to be off, I suppose?\"    As a matter of fact, I was; for I had decided to accept Thorndyke's  offer, and was now eager to take up my duties with him. But it would  have been shabby to leave Stillbury to battle alone with this rush of  work or to seek the services of a strange assistant.    \"I should like to get off as soon as you can spare me,\" I replied, \"but  I'm not going to leave you in the lurch.\"    \"That's a good fellow,\" said Stillbury. \"I knew you wouldn't. Let us  have some tea and divide up the work. Anything of interest going?\"    There were one or two unusual cases on the list, and, as we marked off  our respective patients, I gave him the histories in brief synopsis. And  then I opened the subject of my mysterious experiences at the house of  Mr. Weiss.    \"There's another affair that I want to tell you about; rather an  unpleasant business.\"    \"Oh, dear!\" exclaimed Stillbury. He put down his cup and regarded me  with quite painful anxiety.    \"It looks to me like an undoubted case of criminal poisoning,\" I  continued.    Stillbury's face cleared instantly. \"Oh, I'm glad it's nothing more than  that,\" he said with an air of relief. \"I was afraid, it was some  confounded woman. There's always that danger, you know, when a locum is  young and happens--if I may say so, Jervis--to be a good-looking fellow.  Let us hear about this case.\"    I gave him a condensed narrative of my connection with the mysterious  patient, omitting any reference to Thorndyke, and passing lightly over  my efforts to fix the position of the house, and wound up with the  remark that the facts ought certainly to be communicated to the police.    \"Yes,\" he admitted reluctantly, \"I suppose you're right. Deuced  unpleasant though. Police cases don't do a practice any good. They waste  a lot of time, too; keep you hanging about to give evidence. Still, you  are quite right. We can't stand by and see the poor devil poisoned  without making some effort. But I don't believe the police will do  anything in the matter.\"    \"Don't you really?\"    \"No, I don't. They like to have things pretty well cut and dried before  they act. A prosecution is an expensive affair, so they don't care to  prosecute unless they are fairly sure of a conviction. If they fail they  get hauled over the coals.\"    \"But don't you think they would get a conviction in this case?\"    \"Not on your evidence, Jervis. They might pick up something fresh, but,  if they didn't they would fail. You haven't got enough hard-baked facts  to upset a capable defence. Still, that isn't our affair. You want to  put the responsibility on the police and I entirely agree with you.\"    \"There ought not to be any delay,\" said I.    \"There needn't be. I shall look in on Mrs. Wackford and you have to see  the Rummel children; we shall pass the station on our way. Why shouldn't  we drop in and see the inspector or superintendent?\"    The suggestion met my views exactly. As soon as we had finished tea, we  set forth, and in about ten minutes found ourselves in the bare and  forbidding office attached to the station.    The presiding officer descended from a high stool, and, carefully laying  down his pen, shook hands cordially.    \"And what can I do for you gentlemen?\" he asked, with an affable smile.    Stillbury"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12192"],[0,"The Long Shadow (#11)"],[1,"for himself was a stone  wall, masked by the flowers, so to speak, of his unfailing courtesy.  Billy had once or twice inadvertently located that wall.    A great depression seized upon him and made him quite indifferent  to the little pleasures of homecoming; of seeing the grass green and  velvety and hearing the familiar notes of the meadow-larks and the  curlews. The birds had not returned when he went away, and now the air  was musical with them. Driving over the prairies seemed fairly certain  of being anything but pleasant to-day, with Dill doubled awkwardly in  the seat beside him, carrying on an intermittent monologue of trivial  stuff to which Billy scarcely listened. He could feel that there  was something at the back of it all, and that was enough for him at  present. He was not even anxious now to hear just what was the form of  the disaster which had overtaken them.    \"While you were away,\" Dill began at last in the tone that braces one  instinctively for the worst, \"I met accidentally a man of whom I  had heard, but whom I had not seen. In the course of our casual  conversation he discovered that I was about to launch myself and my  capital into the cattle-business, whereupon he himself made me an  offer which I felt should not be lightly brushed aside.\"    \"They all did!\" Billy could not help flinging out half-resentfully,  when he remembered that but for his timely interference Dill would  have been gulled more than once.    \"I admit that in my ignorance some offers advantageous only to those  who made them appealed to me strongly. But I believe you will agree  with me that this is different. In this case I am offered a full  section of land, with water-rights, buildings, corrals, horses, wagons  and all improvements necessary to the running of a good outfit, and  ten thousand head of mixed cattle, just as they are now running loose  on the range, for three hundred thousand dollars. I need only pay  half this amount down, a five-year mortgage at eight per cent. on  the property covering the remainder, to be paid in five yearly  installments, falling due after shipping time. Now that you did not  buy as much young stock as we at first intended, I can readily make  the first payment on this place and have left between ten and twelve  thousand dollars to carry us along until we begin to get some  returns from the investment I am anxious to have you look over the  proposition, and tell me what you think of it. If you are in favor of  buying, we can have immediate possession; ten days after the deal is  closed, I think the man said.\"    Billy tilted his hat-brim a bit to keep the sun from his eyes, and  considered gravely the proposition. It was a great relief to discover  that his fears were groundless and that it was only another scheme  of Dilly's; another snare which he, perhaps, would be compelled, in  Dill's interest, to move aside. He put the reins down between his  knees and gripped them tightly while he made a cigarette. It was not  until he was pinching the end shut that he spoke.    \"If it's as you say\"--and he meant no offense--\"it looks like a good  thing, all right. But yuh can't most always tell. I'd have to see  it--say, yuh might tell me where this bonanza is, and what's the name  uh the brand. If it's anywheres around here I ought to know the place,  all right.\"    Alexander P. Dill must, after all, have had some sense of humor;  his eyes lost their melancholy enough almost to twinkle. \"Well, the  owner's name is Brown,\" he said slowly. \"I believe they call the brand  the Double-Crank. It is located--\"    \"Located--hell!--do yuh think _I_ don't know?\" The cigarette, ready  to light as it was, slipped from Billy's fingers and dropped unheeded  over the wheel to the brown trail below. He took the reins carefully  from between his knees, straightened one that had become twisted and  turned out upon the prairie to avoid a rough spot where a mud-puddle  had dried in hard ridges. Beyond, he swung back again, leaned and  flicked an early horse-fly from the ribs of the off-horse, touched the  other one up a bit with his whip and settled back at ease, tilting his  hat at quite another angle.         \"Oh, where have yuh been, Billy boy, Billy boy?       Oh, where have yuh been, charming Billy?\"    He hummed, in a care-free way that would have been perfectly maddening  to any one with nerves.    \"I suppose I am to infer from your silence that you do not take kindly  to the proposition,\" observed Mr. Dill, in a colorless tone which  betrayed the fact that he did have nerves.    \"I can take a josh, all right,\" Billy stopped singing long enough to  say. \"For a steady-minded cuss, yuh do have surprising streaks, Dilly,  and that's a fact. Yuh sprung it on me mighty smooth, for not having  much practice--I'll say that for yuh.\"    Mr. Dill looked hurt. \"I hope you do not seriously think that I would  joke upon a matter of business,\" he protested.    \"Well, I know old Brown pretty tolerable well--and I ain't accusing  him uh ribbing up a big josh on yuh. He ain't that brand.\"    \"I must confess I fail to get your point of view,\" said Mr. Dill, with  just a hint of irascibility in his voice. \"There is no joke unless you  are forcing one upon me now. Mr. Brown made me a bona-fide offer,  and I have made a small deposit to hold it until you came and I could  consult you. We have three days left in which to decide for or against  it. It is all perfectly straight, I assure you.\"    Billy took time to consider this possibility. \"Well, in that case,  and all jokes aside, I'd a heap rather have the running uh the  Double-Crank than be President and have all the newspapers hollering  how 'President Billy Boyle got up at eight this morning and had  ham-and-eggs for his breakfast, and then walked around the block with  the Queen uh England hanging onto his left arm,' or anything like that  But what I can't seem to get percolated through me is why, in God's  name, the Double-Crank wants to sell.\"    \"That,\" Mr. Dill remarked, his business instincts uppermost, \"it seems  to me, need not concern us--seeing that they _will_ sell, and at a  price we can handle.\"    \"I reckon you're right. Would yuh mind saying over the details uh the  offer again?\"    \"Mr. Brown\"--Dill cleared his throat--\"offered to sell me a full  section of land, extending from the line-fence of the home ranch,  east--\"    \"Uh-huh--now what the devil's his idea in that?\" Billy cut in  earnestly. \"The Double-Crank owns about three or four miles uh bottom  land, up the creek west uh the home ranch. Wonder why he wants to hold  that out?\"    \"I'm sure I do not know,\" answered Dill. \"He did not mention that to  me, but confined himself, naturally, to what he was willing to sell.\"    \"Oh it don't matter. And all the range stuff, yuh said--ten thousand  head, and--\"    \"I believe he is reserving some thoroughbred stock which he has bought  in the last year or two. The stock on the range--the regular range  grade-stock--all goes, as well as the saddle-horses.\"    \"Must be the widow said yes and wants him to settle down and be a  gentle farmer,\" decided Billy after a moment.    \"We will meet him in Hardup to-night or to-morrow,\" Dill observed,  as if he were anxious to decide the matter finally. \"Do you think we  would better buy?\" It was one of his little courteous ways to say \"we\"  in discussing a business transaction, just as though Billy were one of  the firm.    \"Buy? You bet your life we'll buy! I wisht the papers was all signed  up and in your inside pocket right now, Dilly. I'm going to get heart  failure the worst kind if there's any hitch. Lord, what luck!\"    \"Then, we will consider the matter as definitely settled,\" said Dill,  with a sigh of satisfaction. \"Brown cannot rescind now--there is my  deposit to bind the bargain. I will say I should have been sorely  disappointed if you had not shown that you favored the idea. It seems  to me to be just what we want.\"    \"Oh--that part. But it seems to _me_ that old Brown is sure locoed  to give us a chance at the outfit. He's gone plumb silly. His friends  oughta appoint a guardian over him--only I hope they won't get action  till this deal is cinched tight.\" With that, Billy relapsed into  crooning his ditty. But there were odd breaks when he stopped short in  the middle of a line and forgot to finish, and there was more than one  cigarette wasted by being permitted to go cold and then being chewed  abstractedly until it nearly fell to pieces.    Beside him, Alexander P. Dill, folded loosely together in the seat,  caressed his knees and stared unseeingly at the trail ahead of them  and said never a word for more than an hour.          CHAPTER X.    _The Day We Celebrate._      The days that followed were to Billy much like a delicious dream.  Sometimes he stopped short and wondered uneasily if he would wake up  pretty soon to find that he was still an exile from the Double-Crank,  wandering with Dill over the country in search of a location.  Sometimes he laughed aloud unexpectedly, and said, \"Hell!\" in a  chuckling undertone when came fresh realization of the miracle. But  mostly he was an exceedingly busy young man, with hands and brain too  full of the stress of business to do much wondering.    They were in possession of the Double-Crank, now--he in full  charge, walking the path which his own feet, when he was merely  a \"forty-dollar puncher,\" had helped wear deep to the stable and  corrals; giving orders where he had been wont to receive them; riding  horses which he had long completed, but which had heretofore been  kept sacred to the use of Jawbreaker and old Brown himself; eating and  sleeping in the house with Dill instead of making one of the crowd in  the bunk-house; ordering the coming and going of the round-up crew and  tasting to the full the joys--and the sorrows--of being \"head push\"  where he had for long been content to serve. Truly, the world had  changed amazingly"]]]
