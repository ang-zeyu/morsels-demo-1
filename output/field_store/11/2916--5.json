If my endeavours tend to increase the commerce of my country,  and  eventually to emancipate the African, my design will be accomplished, and  my fondest hopes will be gratified.    In pursuance of my plan, I shall first detail the present number of slaves,  and dead cargo, annually exported, upon an average, from the Windward Coast  of Africa, &c. from the information acquired from the traders of most  intelligence in respective rivers, and from my own observation.        |                     |       |    |    |      |    |    |Amount  |                     |       |    |    |      |    |    |Sterling  | NAMES OF PLACES     |A      |B   |C   |D     |E   |F   |  L  |---------------------|-------|----|----|------|----|----|---------  |River Gambia, and    |       |    |    |      |    |    |  |Island of Goree . . .| 2,000 | 15 |--  |--    |150 |--  | 60,250  |Rio Noonez. . . . . .|   600 | 20 |--  |--    |--  |--  | 19,000  |Rio Pongo . . . . . .| 2,000 | 30 |60  |--    |--  |--  | 52,000  |River Sierra Leone,  |       |    |    |      |    |    |  |adjacent Rivers,     |       |    |    |      |    |    |  |and Isles de Loss,   | 3,200 | 15 |200 |800   |--  |--  | 82,250  |inclusive . . . . . .|       |    |    |      |    |    |  |River Sherbro . . . .|   500 |--  |200 |300   |--  |--  | 18,000  |----  Gallunas. . . .| 1,200 |--  | 80 |--    |--  |--  | 26,000  |Cape Mount to        |       |    |    |      |    |    |  |Cape Palmas . . . . .| 2,000 | 20 |--  |--    |--  |100 | 48,000  |                     |-------|----|----|------|----|----|--------  |                     |11,500 |100 |540 |1,100 |150 |100 |305,500      A-Slaves, B-Ivory, C-Camwood, D-Rice, E-Bees Wax, F-Malaguetta Pepper        Estimating slaves at 20_l_. each; ivory, 350_l_.; camwood, 25_l_.; rice,  10_l_.; wax, 100_l_.; and Malaguetta pepper, 10_l_. per ton, at first cost  upon the coast of Africa; the whole produces the sum of 305,500_l_.  sterling; to which may be added a three-fold export to leeward, which will  make an aggregate amount of nearly _one million_ sterling. In addition to  the foregoing exemplification, we have to contemplate the great  multiplicity of natural productions, abounding in this extent of region,  namely, indigo, numerous plants for staining, cotton in wild exuberance,  cocoa, coffee, and aromatic plants, &c. &c. Wild bees are so extremely  numerous, that wax forms an important article of trade which might be  considerably increased; substances proper for making soap are also to be  found in great abundance, raw hides, more especially in the Gambia, and the  countries insular to the Rio Noonez and Rio Pongo; gold is procured from  Bambouk, and tobacco is found in every direction, which might be greatly  increased by cultivation and an improved soil; cattle, poultry, Guinea  hens, different species of game, fish, with other animals; fruits, and a  variety of vegetable productions, calculated to satisfy every luxurious  want and desire. To these objects of commerce may be added, the now  important article of sugar, which might be raised to a great amount, in  various districts of Africa, as the climate is propitious to the growth of  the sugarcane, which, under proper cultivation, might be raised in great  perfection.    The lands upon the banks of the Gambia, the Rio Noonez, the Rio Grande, the  Rio Pongo, in the Mandingo country, Sierra Leone, Sherbro, &c. are  universally allowed to be extremely fertile in many places, and abundant in  vegetation and population.    These countries produce various hard woods, well adapted to cabinet work  and ship building, and are singular in their qualites and properties.    The most remarkable are, 1st. the cevey, or kinney wood, which grows about  the size of the oak, in England, and may be cut into planks of 20 feet by  15 inches. Its texture is something of the ash grey and mahogany,  variegated with stripes, fancifully disposed, and is therefore adapted to  cabinet work; its qualities for ship building are peculiar, having the  virtue of resisting the worm and vermis, so destructive to shipping in  tropical climates, and corroding iron; it grows in great abundance. Any  quantity of this wood put into water sufficient to cover it, will, in a few  hours, produce an unctuous substance floating on the top, resembling  verdigrise, and of a poisonous quality.    Secondly, the dunjay wood, rather coarser in the grain, but harder in  quality than the Spanish Bay mahogany. It possesses the same peculiarities  as the cevey or kinney, in resisting the worm in salt water, and corroding  iron. It may be procured in any quantity. And, Thirdly, the melley wood, or  _gris-gris_ tree, another species of mahogany, abundant in growth, having a  more rare quality than the foregoing, resisting the worm in both salt and  fresh water; it is extremely hard, and its juices so poisonous, in the  premature state, as to cause instant death.    The manifold and neglected productions of this extraordinary continent  require only to be developed, and when the useful arts of Europe are  introduced here, ample recompense will attend the benevolent undertaking,  natural history will be much enlarged, and mankind be greatly benefited.  The claims of humanity, the distinguished part it has taken in an unnatural  and much to be deplored commerce, loudly unite with a wise policy, in one  impressive appeal to the feelings of the more refined inhabitants of  Europe, and to none more than those of Englishmen.    The goods adapted to African commerce are,    _East India goods_--consisting of bafts, byrampauats, chilloes, romals,  neganipauts, niccanees, red and blue chintz, Guinea stuffs, bandanoes,  sastracundies, &c.    _Manchester goods_.--Cotton chilloes, cushtaes, neganipauts, photaes, romal  handkerchiefs, silk handkerchiefs, &c. _Linen Britanias_, slops, spirits,  tobacco, guns, swords, trade chests, cases, jars, powder, umbrellas, boats,  canvas, cordage, pitch, tar, paints, oil, and brushes, empty kegs, kettles,  pans, lead basons, earthenware, hardware, beads, coral, iron bars, lead  bars, common caps, Kilmarnock ditto, flints, pipes, leg and hand manilloes,  snuff boxes, tobacco boxes, cargo hats, fine ditto, hair trunks, knives,  looking glasses, scarlet cloth, locks, shot, glass ware, stone ware,  provisions, bottled ale and porter, &c. &c.    The foregoing general enumeration may serve to convey a just conception of  the various manufactures requisite in the African trade, and the different  branches to which it is allied, yeilding support to a numerous body of  merchants, manufacturers, artizans, and many of the labouring class of the  community.    Generally speaking, the Africans are unacquainted with specie as a  circulating medium of commerce, although they form to themselves an ideal  standard, by which they estimate the value of the commodities in barter;  this, however, fluctuates on various parts of the coast.    From Senegal to Cape Mesurado, the medium of calculation is termed a _bar_;  from thence to the eastward of Cape Palmas, the computation is in _rounds_;  and on the Gold Coast in _ackies_ of gold, equal to 4_l_. sterling, and of  trade only half that value.    At Goree the bar, under the French, was 4, pieces of 24 sous, and 1 of 6;  but at present the bar is considered a dollar.    The bar is by no means a precise value, but subject to much variation; the  quantity and quality of the articles materially differing in many parts of  the coast, and frequently on rivers of a near vicinity; for example, six  heads of tobacco are equal in trade to a bar, as is a gallon of rum, or a  fathom of chintz.    A piece of cloth which, in one place, will only pass for 6 bars, will in  others fluctuate to 10; hence the trader must form an average standard, to  reduce his assortment to an equilibrium.    The following are the barter prices now established throughout a  considerable extent of the Windward Coast; but it is to be observed, they  are subject to fluctuation from locality of situation and other  circumstances.         1 blue baft              6 bars   1 bonny chintz & stripe  8   1 white baft             6   1 byrampaut              6   1 chilloe                6   1 bijudapaut             6   1 cushtae                5   1 bonny blue romal       5   1 niccanee               5   1 sastracundie           4   1 India cherridery       6   1 taffety               15   1 cottanee              12   1 dozen britannias       8   1 piece of bandanas      6   1 barrel of powder      60   1 fowling gun            8   1 burding                6   1 soldier's gun          5 bars   1 buccanier ditto        6   1 dozen of cutlasses     8   1 sword blade            2   1 iron bar               1   1000 arangoes           30   1 bunch of point beads   1   1 bunch of mock coral    1   Red pecado 3lb. for      1   Seed beads,  ditto       1   Battery     ditto        1   1 Mandingo kettle        1   1 dozen of hardware      3   1 bason                  1   1 ton of salt           60   1 fine hat               3   Tobacco, 6lb. to         1   Rum, per gallon          1        Prime ivory is procured at a bar per lb, and _escrevals_, or pieces under  20lb. 1 bar for each 1-1/2lb.    As the natives are unacquainted with arithmetic, their numerical  calculations are carried on by counters of pebbles, gun-flints, or cowries.    After the number of bars is decided upon,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12545"],[0,"Traditions of the Tinguian: a Study in Philippine Folk-Lore (#11)"],[1,"'_Wes_'\" and she at once said \"_Wes_.\" \"I  use my power so that when I whip my perfume she will wake up,\" and  she woke up. \"_Wes_, how long my sleep was!\" said Aponibolinayen,  for she was alive again. \"How long I sleep! you say. You have been  dead,\" said Algaba, and Aponibolinayen looked at him and she it saw  was not Aponibalagen who held her in his arms. \"Why, Aponibalagen,  do you detest me? Another man is holding me,\" she said, and she arose  from his arms, because she was ashamed.  \"Do not leave me, lady;  you would have been dead a long time if I had not come,\" said Algaba,  and their rings exchanged of themselves while he was holding her and  when Aponibolinayen had regained her breath, Algaba divided the mango  fruit into two parts and he gave to Aponibolinayen, but she did not  want to take it for she was ashamed. \"If you do not wish to eat this  fruit which I give you, you cannot go to anyone but me,\" said Algaba,  and Aponibalagen left them alone.    Not long after Aponibolinayen could sit up straight, and she wanted  to leave Algaba, but he took her. When Aponibolinayen looked at her  ring she saw it was not her own. \"Why have I another ring?\" she asked,  and she caught the hand of Algaba for he wanted to take her. \"Give me  my ring. It is not good for you, for it looks like copper. Take your  ring, for it is really gold,\" said Aponibolinayen. \"No, this is good,  for I did not take it from your finger. The spirits wanted it to come  to my finger. Our rings are both gold, but they are different colors,\"  he said. \"Let us chew betel-nut for it is bad for us to talk when we do  not know each other's names.\" \"It is not my custom to chew betel-nut,\"  said Aponibolinayen. \"Then you learn,\" said Algaba. Not long after he  made her chew and he gave to her. \"Now, lady, whom I visit you tell  your name first,\" he said. \"No, because I am ashamed, as a woman to  tell my name first.\" Not long after he said, \"My name is Algaba of  Dagala. I have looked in all parts of the world for a wife, but I did  not find anyone like you, and now I have found you, and I want you  to be married to me.\" \"My name is Aponibolinayen of Kaodanan, sister  of Aponibalagen who are son and daughter of Ebang and Pagbokasan,\"  said Aponibolinayen. Not long after they laid down their quids and  they were rows of agate beads which have no holes. Algaba said, \"It  is good for us to be married.\" So they were married and they went to  Dagala. As soon as they arrived in Dagala, \"Mother,\" he said to his  mother _alan_, \"now we are going to take you to Kadalayapan, because  I have found a wife.\" \"No,\" said the _alan_, \"we must first build  _balaua_ here.\" \"That is good if it is what you desire,\" said Algaba.    Not long after Aponibolinayen commanded people to pound rice, and  others to get betel-nuts which were covered with gold. So they truly  made _Sayang._ [120] Not long after when it became evening they made  _Libon._ \"The best for us to do is to invite Aponibalagen, and all the  people of Kadalayapan and some other places,\" said Algaba. Not long  after they sent the betel-nuts which were covered with gold to invite  their relatives. Some of the betel-nuts they sent to Kaodanan. \"Sir,  come to Dagala, because Aponibolinayen and Algaba build _balaua_,\"  said the betel-nut to Aponibalagen. When the other betel-nuts arrived  at Kadalayapan to invite the people they said to Langa-an, \"Come to  Dagala because Aponibolinayen and Algaba make _balaua_.\" Not long  after Aponibalagen and Aponigawani and the other people went.    When they reached the middle of the way they met the people of  Kadalayapan, so they were a large party who went. When they arrived  at Dagala, at the place where the spring is, they saw that all the  stones by the river were gold and they were surprised, and the people  who were dipping water from the spring were there. \"You people who  are dipping water, where is the shallow place for us to cross?\" they  said. \"You look for the place where the people go across?\" said the  people who were dipping water. Not long after they went across the  river. As soon as they reached the other side of the river, they  took a bath. The women who were dipping water saw that the water  which ran from their bodies were agates which had no holes. \"How  wonderful are the people who live in Kadalayapan and Kaodanan, for  they are relatives of Kaboniyan [121] and they have power,\" said the  women who were dipping water from the well.    \"You people who are dipping water, where is the trail which leads  to the house of Algaba of Dagala?\" they said. \"Follow the head  poles; they are along the road to his house,\" said the women who  were dipping water. So they went up truly to the town, and the boa  constrictors which made the fence around the town did not move when  they passed, for they were afraid, and when they arrived at the house  of Algaba the _alan_ danced. When they sat down Pagatipanan was in  a hurry. \"Ala! Langa-an, let us go and give the betel-nut which is  covered with gold to Algaba,\" he said and they went truly. They told  Algaba that they were going to chew betel-nut, because they wished  to learn if they were relatives; and Algaba said \"That is good,\"  and they called Aponigawani to the house, and they cut the betel-nut  in pieces. As soon as they cut it in pieces, \"The best way to do is  for you to tell your name first, because we came to visit you,\" said  Pagatipanan to Algaba. \"No, old man, you tell your name first,\" said  Algaba. Not long after, \"My name is Pagatipanan who am the _Lakay_  [122] of Kadalayapan.\" Not long after, \"My name is Pagbokasan who is  the father of Aponibalagen of Kaodanan.\" Not long after, \"My name  is Algaba who is the son of an _alan_ who has deformed feet, [123]  who has no sister; we are not like you people who have power,\" said  Algaba. Not long after, \"My name is Aponibalagen of Kaodanan who is the  son of Ebang and Pagbokasan.\" Not long after, \"My name is Aponigawani  of Kadalayapan who has no brother, so that when some enemies come  into our town I dress in the bark of trees.\" Not long after, \"My  name is Aponibolinayen who is the sister of Aponibalagen.\" As soon  as they told their names, they laid down their betel-nut quids. The  quids of Algaba and Aponigawani both went to the quid of Pagatipanan,  also the quids of Aponibalagen and Aponibolinayen went to the quid of  Pagbokasan. Then Aponigawani stood up. \"You are so strange, Algaba,  you are my brother. I am so glad that I have a brother now. You are  bad for you let the enemies come into Kadalayapan,\" she said. \"Excuse  me for I was far from Kadalayapan and did not see; it is our custom  for some of us to go to fight,\" said Algaba. \"The best way to do,  Aponitolau, [124] is for you to go back with us to Kadalayapan,\"  said Aponigawani. \"If that is what you wish it is all right,\" he  said. Not long after the _balaua_ was finished and they took them to  Kadalayapan. The valuable things which the _alan_ owned she gave to  them, and she flew away.    When they arrived in Kadalayapan, Aponibalagen wanted to marry  Aponigawani. He sent his mother to go and give the message. As soon as  she arrived in Kadalayapan, \"Good morning, nephew Aponitolau,\" said  Ebang. \"Good morning, what are you here for?\" said Aponitolau. \"What  are you coming for, you say. Aponibalagen sent me to talk to you,  for he wishes to marry Aponigawani,\" she said. \"If you think it is  good it will be all right,\" said Aponitolau, so she took out the  engagement gift and she put one earring inside of a little jar and  it was filled with gold. Aponitolau lifted his eyebrows and half  of the gold disappeared, so Ebang put another earring in the pot  and it was full again. \"Ala! when it becomes evening you come and  bring Aponibalagen,\" he said to Ebang. \"Yes,\" she said. So she went  home. As soon as she arrived in their house in Kaodanan, Aponibalagen  asked the result of her trip. \"They agreed all right; we will go when  it becomes evening,\" said Ebang. When it became night they went to  Kadalayapan and he lived with Aponigawani. When it became morning he  took Aponigawani to Kaodanan and the father and mother of Aponigawani  and the other people followed them. They went to get the marriage  payment. It was the _balaua_ filled nine times with jars. As soon  as they gave all the payment, Aponitolau was the next to make his  payment. It was also the _balaua_ filled nine times. As soon as they  made all the payment they went home.    (Told by Mano, a woman of Patok.)        3    \"I am going to wash my hair. Give me the rice straw, which has been  inherited nine times,\" said Aponitolau to his mother Langa-an. So  Langa-an gave him some and he went to the river to wash. As soon as  he arrived at the well he saw the pretty girl who was washing her  hair. He went and sat down on her skirt and the pretty girl told  him not to cut her in many places so she would not need to doctor  the wounds. \"If I were an old enemy I would have killed you at the  first. It is bad for us to talk when we do not know each other's  names. Let us chew betel-nut,\" said Aponitolau. \"No, for it is not  my custom,\" said the girl. But Aponitolau compelled her to chew  betel-nut with him. \"You tell your name first,\" he said to her. \"No,  it is not good for me to tell my name first, for I am a woman. You  are a man. You tell your name first.\" So Aponitolau said, \"My name is  Aponitolau of Kadalayapan who am the son of Langa-an and Pagatipanan,  who came here to wash my hair. It is good fortune for me that I met  you here washing your hair.\" \"My name is Gimbangonan of Natpangan,  who am the daughter of It-tonagan, who is the sister of Aldasan.\" As  soon as she told her name she disappeared and went to hide among the  betel nuts on the branch of a tree. So Aponitolau was very sorry and  he went back home without washing his hair. As soon as he arrived  where Langa-an was sitting he said to her \"Mother, when"]]]
