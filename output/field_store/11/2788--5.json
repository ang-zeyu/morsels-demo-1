Since it is a  contrivance deriving its efficacy from hydraulic pressure, it may,  without impropriety, be considered here. The friction of axles in their  supports is the occasion of a considerable loss of power in every  machine.    [Illustration]    The loss of power itself, though a real disadvantage, is nevertheless a  matter of secondary consequence compared with the attendant elevation  of temperature, which, were not means carefully provided for reducing  friction to the lowest point possible, might soon be so great as to  arrest the operation of the machine itself. It was stated in a public  lecture delivered in May, 1867, before the Scientific Association of  France, that, in a certain instance within the lecturer's knowledge, the  screw shaft of a French naval propeller became absolutely welded to its  support, though surrounded by the water of the sea, in consequence of  the great heat developed by its revolution.    The ordinary means of reducing friction is to apply oil, or some other  unctuous substance, to the parts which move upon each other. Some  disadvantages attend this expedient, but till a better is suggested  they have to be endured. The cost of the oil expended in maintaining in  proper condition the axles of the machinery in a foundery, or of the  rolling stock of a railroad, amounts to a large sum annually; while the  want of neatness which its use makes, to a certain extent, inevitable,  and the labor which must be constantly employed to prevent this want of  neatness from becoming much greater than it is, are serious items to be  set off against its positive usefulness.    The object of Mr. Girard is to get rid of all these drawbacks by the  simple expedient of substituting water for oil. It would not avail to  apply water precisely as oil is applied. Though any one's experience may  tell him that two smooth pieces of metal will slide more smoothly on  each other when they are wet than when they are dry, yet every one knows  also that oil facilitates the movement much more perceptibly than water;  and also, that in the case of oil there is no difficulty in maintaining  the lubricating film, whereas water easily evaporates, and in case of  the accident of even a moderate elevation of temperature, it would be  expelled from the joint entirely. Mr. Girard proposes, therefore, to  employ the water to act, first, by its pressure, to lift the Journal to  be lubricated; and secondly, by its fluidity, to form a liquid bed or  cushion between the journal and its box, on which the journal may rest  in its revolution, without touching the metal of the box at all.    The construction will be understood by referring to the figure. One of  the journals is represented as removed, and in the cylindrical surface  of the socket are seen grooves occupying a considerable part of the area  exposed. These grooves communicate, by an aperture in the middle, with  a tube which is represented externally, and which sends a branch to the  other journal, through which water under a heavy pressure is introduced  into the box beneath the journal. The effect of the hydraulic pressure  is to lift the axle, opening a passage for the escape of the compressed  water, which at the same time, because of its release from compression,  loses the power to sustain the weight. If, therefore, by the first  impulse, the axle is thrown upward to any sensible distance, it will  immediately fall back again, once more confining more or less completely  the water. After one or two oscillations, therefore, the axle will  settle itself at length in a position in which, while the water will  escape, it will escape but as a film of inappreciable thickness. In this  condition the journal turns upon a liquid bed, and the resistance to its  revolution is so excessively small that a slow rotation given by hand  to a wheel sustained by it will be maintained for many minutes without  perceptible retardation. In fact, the most striking illustration which  can be given of the immense superiority of the _palier glissant_ over  a support lubricated in in any other way, is furnished by placing two  precisely similar wheels or disks side by side, weighing five or six  pounds each, with a diameter of seven or eight inches, and journals  of half an inch in diameter; one of them furnished with _paliers  glissants_, and the other with boxes lubricated with fine oil. Give each  of them a velocity of rotation of about one revolution in a second; the  one lubricated with oil will come to rest before the other begins to  give evidence of any sensible retardation; but if at any moment the  stop-cock which supplies the water to the second be turned, this one  will also stop, and its stopping will be instantaneous.    It might be supposed that a journal supported in the manner above  described would be unsteady and liable to injurious vibrations. This is  not the case, and it is easy to see why not. When the journal is truly  in the middle of the socket, that is to say when there is an equal  distance between it and the wall of the socket on either side, it will  be equally pressed from both sides. But if it is in the least displaced  laterally, the pressure on the side toward which it moves will instantly  increase, while that on the other side will correspondingly diminish:  both causes transpiring to resist the displacement, and to maintain the  journal in the position of true equilibrium.    The water pressure by which these \"slippery supports\" are supplied must  be created by a force pump worked by the machine itself. The reservoir  need not be large as the expenditure of water is very minute in volume.  To the objection which may naturally be made, that the working of the  pump must be a tax on the motive power without return, a reply at once  simple and satisfactory is found in the experience of Mr. Girard, that  the working of the pump does not consume so much as half, and sometimes  not more than one one quarter, of the power which is lost in friction  when the ordinary modes of lubrication are employed; so that by the  adoption of this expedient the available power of the machine is  very sensibly increased after deducting all that is expended in the  performance of this additional work.           *       *       *       *       *    BEES BENEFICIAL TO FRUIT.--Dr. A. Packard, editor of the _American  Naturalist_, replies to a query in regard to the effects produced upon  fruit by the agency of honey bees, that all the evidence given by  botanists and zoologists who have specially studied the subject, shows  that bees improve the quality and tend to increase the quantity of  fruit. They aid in the fertilization of flowers, thus preventing the  occurrence of sterile flowers, and, by more thoroughly fertilizing  flowers already perfect, render the production of sound and well  developed fruit more sure. Many botanists think if it were not for bees,  and other insects, many plants would not bear fruit at all.           *       *       *       *       *    Steamboats on the American plan are to be introduced on Lake Geneva,  Switzerland.

Is the heartfelt wish conveyed in this beautiful and unusually large  number, to each and all of our friends and readers This holiday number  is worthy of note not only on account of its size, its rich table of  contents, and profuse illustrations, but because we publish this week  the largest edition ever sent out from this office.    Our readers may be surprised at our publishing the title page of the  volume again this week but they will please observe it is the title page  of Vol XXII, which we are now commencing The title pages will hereafter  be published with the first instead of the last number of each volume,  so as to bring it in its proper place for binding.    Subscriptions are pouring in from all parts of the country in the most  encouraging manner. Many have already secured the prize engraving, by  sending in the requisite number of names-but we feel obliged to confess  that there is now a considerable want of vitality in the competition  for the cash prizes. We expect however, that as soon as the new year's  greetings are fairly exchanged, that this opportunity to receive some  purse money will attract the attention of our enterprising readers The  times may be a little close just now, but we are confident that the  spring will open joyously, and we are quite sure that the people will  still want to know what is going on in the GREAT WORLD OF INDUSTRY,  which, it will be our duty to chronicle.    All lists intended to compete for the cash premium must be marked \"Cash  prize list.\"    Once more we say a \"Happy New Year\" to all.           *       *       *       *       *          THE SUEZ CANAL NOT YET A FAILURE.

Tantus tamen timor animós eórum occupáverat ut  nihil dubitárent quín mortí obviam írent.

Illí autem aliquantum itineris prógressí ad  víllam quandam pervénérunt summá mágnificentiá aedificátam, cúius ad  óstium cum adiissent, cantum dulcissimum audívérunt. Tanta autem fuit  éius vócis dulcédó ut núlló modó retinérí possent quín iánuam pulsárent.  Hóc factó ipsa Circé forás exiit, et summá cum benígnitáte omnís in  hospitium invítávit.

Cénam mágnificam omnibus rébus ínstrúctam invénérunt et iússú dominae  libentissimé accubuérunt. At Circé vínum quod serví apposuérunt  medicámentó quódam miscuerat; quod cum Graecí bibissent, graví somnó  subitó oppressí sunt.    96. _THE CHARM_    Tum Circé, quae artis magicae summam scientiam habébat, baculó aureó quod  gerébat capita eórum tetigit; quó factó omnés in porcós subitó conversí  sunt. Intereá Eurylochus ígnárus quid in aedibus agerétur ad óstium  sedébat; postquam tamen ad sólis occásum ánxió animó et sollicitó  exspectávit, sólus ad návem regredí cónstituit. Eó cum vénisset,  sollicitúdine ac timóre tam perturbátus fuit ut quae vídisset vix  dílúcidé nárráre posset. Ulixés autem satis intelléxit sociós suós in  perículó versárí, et gladió correptó Eurylochó imperávit ut sine morá  viam ad istam domum démónstráret. Ille tamen multís cum lacrimís Ulixem  complexus obsecráre coepit né in tantum perículum sé committeret; sí quid  gravius eí accidisset, omnium salútem in summó discrímine futúram.

Quod cum Mercurius sénsisset, herbam quandam eí dedit, quam contrá  carmina multum valére dícébat. \"Hanc cape,\" inquit, \"et ubi Circé té  baculó tetigerit, tú strictó gladió impetum in eam vidé ut faciás.\"  Mercurius postquam fínem loquendí fécit,        \"mortálís vísús medió sermóne relíquit,       et procul in tenuem ex oculís évánuit auram.\"    98. _THE ENCHANTRESS IS FOILED_    Breví intermissó spatió Ulixés ad omnia perícula subeunda parátus iánuam  pulsávit, et foribus patefactís ab ipsá Circé benígné exceptus est. Omnia  eódem modó atque anteá facta sunt. Cénam mágnificé ínstrúctam vídit et  accumbere iússus est. Mox, ubi famés cibó dépulsa est, Circé póculum  aureum vínó replétum Ulixí dedit. Ille etsí suspicátus est venénum sibi  parátum esse, póculum exhausit; quó factó Circé postquam caput éius  baculó tetigit, ea verba locúta est quibus sociós éius anteá in porcós  converterat. Rés tamen omnínó aliter événit atque illa spéráverat. Tanta  enim vís erat éius herbae quam Ulixí Mercurius dederat ut neque venénum  neque verba quicquam efficere possent. Ulixés autem, ut eí praeceptum  erat, gladió strictó impetum in eam fécit et mortem minitábátur. Circé  cum artem suam nihil valére sénsisset, multís cum lacrimís eum obsecráre  coepit né sibi vítam adimeret.    99. _MEN ONCE MORE_    Ulixés autem ubi sénsit eam timóre perterritam esse, postulávit ut sociós  suós sine morá in húmánam speciem redúceret (certior enim factus erat á  deó Mercurió eós in porcós conversós esse); nisi id factum esset, sé  débitás poenás súmptúrum ostendit. Circé hís rébus graviter commóta eí ad  pedés sé próiécit, et multís cum lacrimís iúre iúrandó cónfírmávit sé  quae ille imperásset omnia factúram. Tum porcós in átrium immittí iussit.  Illí dató sígnó inruérunt, et cum ducem suum ágnóvissent, mágnó dolóre  adfectí sunt quod núlló modó eum dé rébus suís certiórem facere poterant.  Circé tamen unguentó quódam corpora eórum únxit; quó factó sunt omnés  statim in húmánam speciem reductí. Mágnó cum gaudió Ulixés suós amícós  ágnóvit, et núntium ad lítus mísit, quí reliquís Graecís sociós receptós  esse díceret. Illí autem hís rébus cógnitís statim ad domum Circaeam sé  contulérunt; quó cum vénissent, úniversí laetitiae sé dédidérunt.

Circé tamen cum haec cógnóvisset, ex odió ad amórem  conversa omnibus precibus eum óráre et obtestárí coepit ut paucós diés  apud sé morárétur; quá ré tandem impetrátá tanta beneficia in eum  contulit ut facile eí persuásum sit ut diútius manéret. Postquam tamen  tótum annum apud Circén cónsúmpserat, Ulixés mágnó désíderió patriae  suae mótus est. Sociís igitur ad sé convocátís quid in animó habéret  ostendit.

At Circé ubi omnia ad profectiónem paráta esse vídit, rem  aegré ferébat et Ulixem vehementer obsecrábat ut eó cónsilió désisteret.  Ille tamen, né anní tempore a návigátióne exclúderétur, mátúrandum sibi  exístimávit, et tempestátem idóneam nactus návem solvit. Multa quidem  perícula Ulixí subeunda erant antequam in patriam suam perveníret, quae  tamen hóc locó longum est perscríbere.          NOTES      PERSEUS    _The numbers refer to the page of text and the line on the page  respectively_.      3.6. Danaé. Many proper names in this book are words borrowed by Latin  from Greek, and have forms not given in the regular Latin declensions. It  will not be necessary to learn the declension of such words.    7. enim. This word commonly stands second in its clause.    8. turbábat. Notice that this verb and dormiébat below are in the  imperfect tense to denote a state of things existing at the past time  indicated by territa est.    autem. This word has the same peculiarity of position as enim; so also  igitur, which occurs in line 11.    12. Seríphum. Notice that Latin says 'the island Seriphos,' but English  more often 'the island of Seriphos.'    13. appulsa est. Postquam is regularly followed by the perfect or present  indicative, but the English translation usually requires the pluperfect.    15. quódam. _Quídam_ means 'certain' as applied to some person or thing  not fully described, while _certus_ means 'certain' in the sense of  'determined.' 'sure,'    ad domum. This means 'to the house'; 'to be brought home' would be _domum  addúcí_, without the preposition.    16. Ille is often used, as here, when the subject is changed to a person  mentioned in the preceding sentence. In this use it is to be translated  'he.'    18. benefició. See the derivation of this word in the vocabulary.    20. multós annós. Duration of time is regularly expressed in the  accusative case.    22. eam. Latin has no pronoun of the third person, and _is_ often takes  the place of one; it is then to be translated 'he,' 'she,' 'it,' 'they,'  according to its form.    25. haec. The literal translation would be 'these things,' but we must  say 'thus' or 'as follows.'    4. 1. es. With iam dúdum and similar expressions of duration, the present  indicative is often used to denote an action or state begun in the past  but continuing in the present. The English equivalent is the perfect.    híc, is not the pronoun, but an adverb.    2. mihi. This dative may be translated 'for me.' How would 'to me' with a  verb of motion be put?    3. refer. _Dícó, dúcó, fació_, and _feró_ have the imperative forms _díc,  dúc, fac_, and _fer_, instead of _díce_, etc.    4. Perseus. When the subordinate and the principal clause of a Latin  sentence have the same subject, this usually stands first, followed by  the subordinate clause.    haec. Here a different rendering is required from that suggested in the  note on 3, 25. What is it? Notice that it is necessary to know the  literal significance of the"]]]
