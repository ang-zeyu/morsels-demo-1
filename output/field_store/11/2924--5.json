In regard to the latter animal, the danger which they  incurred, was more imminent than with the elephants, but this did not  arise from the greater ferocity or savageness of the animal, for the  river horse moves in general in a sluggish and harmless manner; but  in the shallow places of the river, the horses were seen walking at  the bottom, and the space between them and the boat so small, that  the keel often came into collision with the back of the animal, who,  incensed at the affront offered to him, would be apt to strike a hole  through the boat with his huge teeth, and thereby endanger its  sinking. It was evident to the commander of the expedition, that the  courage of his native crew was almost paralyzed, when they had to  contend with any of these formidable creatures, although he had no  reason to complain of their exertions, in dragging the boats over the  flats and shallows, which appeared to abound in every part of the  river.    It now became manifest to Stibbs, that he had chosen an unfavourable  time of the year for his expedition; for, after having spent two  months, he found himself on the 22nd February, only fifty-nine miles  above Barraconda, and at some distance from Tenda, consequently he  was not so successful as either Thompson or Jobson, notwithstanding  his means were more efficient, and adapted to the purpose. Stibbs,  however, expressed himself greatly disappointed with the results of  his expedition, and began to look upon the golden mines of Africa,  represented as they had been to be inexhaustible, as nothing more  than the grossest falsifications, made to suit some private purpose,  or to throw a certain degree of ridicule upon the plans and exertions  of the African company. He had been informed of a mighty channel,  which was to lead him into the remote interior of Africa, but he had  as yet only navigated a river, which in certain seasons is almost  dry, and where the crews were obliged to assume the character of the  amphibious; for at one time, they were obliged to be for hours in the  water, dragging the boats over the shallows, and at another, they  were on the land, dragging the boats over it, in order to surmount  the ledges of rocks, which extended from shore to shore. At one time  they were rowing over the backs of the river horses, and the next,  they ran the risk of being thrown upon their own back, by the trunks  of the elephants, or having them snapped in two between the jaws of  the crocodiles.    The source of the great river, which, according to the description  then given of it, could not be any other than the Niger, was,  according to the opinion of Stibbs, \"nothing near so far in the  country, as by the geographers has been represented.\" The river,  which he had navigated, did not answer in any degree with the  description which had been given of the Niger. The name was not even  known in the quarters through which he had passed; it did not flow  from any lake, that he could hear of, or which was known to any of  the natives, nor did it communicate with the Senegal, or any other  great river; and so far from it being a mighty stream in the  interior, the report was given to him by the natives, that at about  twelve days journey above Barraconda, it dwindled into a rivulet, so  small that the \"fowls could walk over it.\"    On the return of Stibbs to the company's settlement at the month of  the Gambia, these reports were received with great reluctance, and  the strongest doubts were thrown upon their authenticity. At that  time, a person of the name of Moore was the company's factor on the  Gambia; and in order to invalidate the statements of Stibbs, he  produced Herodotus, Leo, Edrisi, and other high authorities, whilst  on the other hand, Stibbs declared, that he had never heard of such  travellers before, and that he did not see why greater faith should  be put in their reports, than in his.    Stibbs for some time supported the veracity of his statements, but  Moore and Herodotus at length prevailed, and Stibbs retired from the  service in disgust. There were, however, many strongly inclined to  attach implicit belief to the statements of Stibbs, at all events,  they had the direct tendency of preventing any other voyage being  undertaken for some time, for exploring that part of the African  continent.    The first person who brought home any accounts of French Africa, was  Jannequin, a young man of some rank, who, as he was walking along the  quay at Dieppe, saw a vessel bound for this unknown continent, and  took a sudden fancy to embark and make the voyage. He was landed at a  part of the Sahara, near Cane Blanco. He was struck in an  extraordinary degree with the desolate aspect of the region. In  ascending the river, however, he was delighted with the brilliant  verdure of the banks, the majestic beauty of the trees, and the thick  impenetrable underwood. The natives received him hospitably, and he  was much struck by their strength and courage, decidedly surpassing  similar qualities in Europeans. He saw a moorish chief, called the  Kamalingo, who, mounting on horseback, and brandishing three javelins  and a cutlass, engaged a lion in single combat, and vanquished that  mighty king of the desert. Flat noses and thick lips, so remote from  his own ideas of the beautiful, were considered on the Senegal, as  forming the perfection of the human visage; nay, he even fancies that  they were produced by artificial means. Of actual discovery, little  transpired worthy of record in the travels of Jannequin, and his  enthusiasm became soon daunted by the perils which at every step  beset him.        CHAPTER  III.    Nearly seventy years had elapsed, and the spirit of African discovery  had remained dormant, whilst in the mean time the remotest quarters  of the globe had been reached by British enterprise; the vast region  of Africa still remaining an unseemly blank in the map of the earth.  To a great and maritime nation as England then was, and to the cause  of the sciences in general, particularly that of geography, it was  considered as highly discreditable, that no step should be taken to  obtain a correct knowledge of the geographical situation of the  interior of Africa, from which continual reports arrived of the  existence of great commercial cities, and the advantages which the  Arabs derived from their intercourse with them. For the purpose of  promoting this great national undertaking, a small number of  highly-spirited individuals formed themselves into what was termed  the African Association, A sum of money was subscribed, and  individuals were sought for, who were qualified to undertake such  arduous and dangerous enterprises. Lord Rawdon, afterwards the  Marquess of Hastings, Sir Joseph Banks, the Bishop of Llandaff, Mr.  Beaufoy, and Mr. Stuart, were nominated managers.    The first adventurer was Mr. Ledyard, who, from his earliest age, had  been a traveller from one extremity of the earth to the other. He had  circumnavigated the globe with Capt. Cook, had resided for several  years amongst the American indians, and had travelled with the most  scanty means from Stockholm round the Gulf of Bothnia, and thence to  the remotest parts of Asiatic Russia. On his return from his last  journey, Sir Joseph Banks was then just looking out for a person to  explore the interior of Africa, and Ledyard was no sooner introduced  to him, than he pronounced him to be the very man fitted for the  undertaking. Ledyard also declared that the scheme was in direct  unison with his own wishes, and on being asked how soon he could  depart, he answered, \"Tomorrow.\" Some time, however, elapsed in  making the necessary arrangements, and a passage was shortly  afterwards obtained for him to Alexandria, with the view of first  proceeding southward from Cairo to Sennaar, and thence traversing the  entire breadth of the African continent.    He arrived at Cairo on the 19th of August, 1788. His descriptions of  Egypt are bold and original, but somewhat fanciful. He represented  the Delta as an unbounded plain of excellent land miserably  cultivated; the villages as most wretched assemblages of poor mud  huts, full of dust, fleas, flies, and all the curses of Moses, and  the people as below the rank of any savages he ever saw, wearing only  a blue shirt and drawers, and tattooed as much as the South Sea  islanders. He recommends his correspondents, if they wish to see  Egyptian women, to look at any group of gypsies behind a hedge in  Essex. He describes the Mohammedans as a trading, enterprising,  superstitious, warlike set of vagabonds, who, wherever they are bent  upon going, will and do go; but he complains that the condition of a  Frank is rendered most humiliating and distressing by the furious  bigotry of the Turks; to him it seemed inconceivable that such enmity  should exist among men, and that beings of the same species should  trick and act in a manner so opposite. By conversing with the Jelabs,  or slave merchants, he learned a good deal respecting the caravan  routes and countries of the interior. Every thing seemed ready for  his departure, and he announced that his next communication would be  from Sennaar, but, on the contrary, the first tidings received were  those of his death. Some delays in the departure of the caravans,  acting upon his impatient spirit, brought on a bilious complaint, to  which he applied rash and violent remedies, and thus reduced himself  to a state, from which the care of Rosetti, the Venetian consul, and  the skill of the best physician of Cairo sought in vain to deliver  him.    The society had, at the time they engaged"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12668"],[0,"An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, Volume 2 (#11)"],[1,"of examining that part of the country which he designed to  cultivate on the public account; and to observe how the convicts who had  lately arrived, the major part of whom had been sent thither, were  provided for. The cattle which had been landed from the _Supply_ had  been also sent thither, and were, with the government stock that was at  Toongabbie, thriving exceedingly.    The ground that it was proposed to clear on the public account was not  more than two miles and a half from Parramatta, and most advantageously  situated in point of fresh water, having a chain of large and excellent  ponds in its vicinity. The deputy surveyor having accompanied the  governor, the spot was marked out for erecting the necessary buildings;  and the whole was named Portland Place, in honour of his Grace the Duke  of Portland.    In consequence of the proclamation which was issued in the last month,  one of the run-away convicts delivered himself up to a constable, and  another was taken and lodged in confinement: they appeared to be half  starved; yet their sufferings were not sufficient to prevent similar  desertions from work in others, nor a repetition of the offence in  themselves; such was the strong aversion which these worthless characters  had to any thing that bore the name of work. More labour would have been  performed in this country by 100 people from any part of England or  Scotland, than had at any time been derived from 300 of these people,  with all the attention that could be paid to them. Had 200 families of  decent labouring farmers been sent out as settlers a few years since, and  had a few convicts to assist them been placed wholly under their  direction and authority, the cultivation would have been much farther  advanced; and, in point of provisions, those families would have been  living in luxury. More grain than could be consumed would have been  grown, instead of crops which in some years were barely sufficient to  last until the following harvest.    These people were brought to trial for a theft which they were stated to  have committed, but of which there was not any positive proof, and they  were acquitted. There was not any doubt of their having associated with  and instructed the natives how to commit, with the least hazard to  themselves, the various depredations which the settlers had sustained  from them; yet there was no proof of this, at least no proof whereby they  might have been capitally punished, nothing short of which would ever be  sufficient to prevent this dangerous intercourse.    After exciting some apprehensions for her safety, his Majesty's ship the  _Reliance _anchored in the Cove on the 26th, from the Cape of Good  Hope, having had a very stormy passage, with 26 cows, 3 bulls, and about  60 sheep on board, on government account. She had been extremely leaky  all the voyage; and it must be remembered, that the other colonial ship,  the _Supply_, arrived in a very infirm state.*    [* At her departure from the Cape, it was generally conjectured  that she would never reach the settlement; but her commander,  Lieutenant William Kent, considered and felt the design of his voyage to  be of so much importance to the colony, that he determined to run every  risk; and fortunately, though with great difficulty, he succeeded.]    A most unexpected and unaccountable desertion took place in the night  after the arrival of the _Reliance_. Two boys belonging to that ship  carried away a small two-oared boat, in which they intended to proceed to  the southward, and there join the natives. Being pursued, they were  brought back, and gave the above account of their scheme; to effect  which, they had provided themselves with a boat-cloak to sleep in, a pair  of pistols, a small quantity of gun-powder, and 50 cakes of portable  soup. That any one who had been accustomed to the habits of civilised  life should find charms in that led by the savages of this country, was  unaccountable; for, admitting that idleness was the inducement, yet  whoever associated with them must accompany them wherever they went, and  they were generally on the move either by day or night. They were seldom  provided with more food than was sufficient for the day; and in their  treacherous visitations at night, for the purposes of revenge, the  European might be easily mistaken for, or confounded with, the savage.  But thus it was, to the great evil of the community to which these  unthinking wretches belonged.    The inhabitants of the town of Sydney having been assessed to supply  thatch for the roof of the new gaol, and completed their respective  proportions, the building was enclosed during this month with a strong  and high fence. A building such as this had certainly been long wanted.  It was 80 feet in length; the sides and ends were constructed of strong  logs, a double row of which formed each partition. The whole was divided  into 22 cells, the divisions of which were logs. The floor and the roof  were of the same solid materials, over which was a coat 8 inches deep of  stiff clay, and the roof besides was thatched. Every accommodation for  prisoners was to be found in separate buildings in the prison yard, in  which also was a distinct brick building for debtors, fenced off from the  _felon side_ (to use an Old Bailey distinction) by a strong and high  paling.    This, enclosing a spot of ground which had been marked out on the west  side of the Cove for a ship-yard, landing provisions from the transports,  and completing the granary, formed the principal labour in which the  public gangs were employed this month at Sydney.    The weather was remarkably dry.

The _Eliza_ long-boat, which sailed from the island with  them, had on board a few Lascars and some property; but having had to  encounter a very heavy gale of wind, and not arriving with the schooner,  many doubts were entertained of her safety. She was under the direction  of Mr. Armstrong, the master of the _Supply_.    On the 17th, twelve days after the return of the _Francis_, it came  on to blow exceedingly hard at SE and SSE by which many large trees and  several chimneys were blown down. The gale was attended with a deluge of  rain, and was so heavy, that some of the ships, even in that secure cove,  brought their anchors home. In addition to other damage done at this  time, two of the vanes of the wind-mill were torn off by the violence of  the wind. This gale considerably increased the apprehensions of every.  one concerned for the safety of the long-boat.    The cattle which arrived in the _Reliance_ were landed, and,  considering that they had experienced much bad weather on the passage,  looked extremely well. The two Colonial ships had been employed eight  months on this voyage to and from the Cape, and had added 51 cows, 3  bulls, a few horses, and about 90 sheep, to the stock of domestic cattle  in the colony.    This species of provisions was multiplying largely; but the salt meat was  decreasing so fast, that it became necessary to issue only half the usual  ration of pork.    The convicts were employed in enclosing the new ship yard, shingling the  barracks for the assistant surgeons, clearing ground at Portland-place,  where seventy men were at work, and completing the repair of the public  roads, in which necessary labour, the settlers again assisted, having  finished the cropping of their grounds for the ensuing season.    The dry weather had been followed by several days' rain, by which the  appearance of the wheat-grounds was very much improved.    Ensign Birch, of the New South Wales corps, died on the 5th, and was  buried with military honours. He arrived in the _Britannia_.    August.] The Colonial schooner, having been dispatched with some stores  which were wanted at Norfolk Island, left the Cove on the 7th; but the  wind failing, she anchored in the lower part of the harbour. While lying  here, some of her people became drunk, and insisted on taking the boat  ashore. This being resisted, one of the crew fired a pistol at a soldier  who was on board, which, it being dark at the time, missed him, but the  ball went through the leg of a seaman belonging to the _Supply_, who  had been lent to the schooner. He was brought up to the hospital, and the  man who fired the pistol was conducted to prison, to answer for his  rashness.    The _Britannia_ and the _Ganges_ sailed on their respective  voyages. The commander of the latter was permitted to take on board  several convicts who had become free, and some of the marine soldiers who  had been discharged from the New South Wales corps, having completed  their second engagement in that regiment. They had talked of becoming  settlers, and remaining some years longer in the country; but the  restless love of change prevailed, and they quitted the colony by this  opportunity.
