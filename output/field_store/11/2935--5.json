No person has any right to argue  why any particular Vedic commandment is to be followed, for no  reason can ever discover that, and it is only because reason fails  to find out why a certain Vedic act leads to a certain effect that  the Vedas have been revealed as commandments and prohibitions  to show the true path of happiness. The Vedic teaching belongs  therefore to that of the Karma-marga or the performance of Vedic  duties of sacrifice, etc. The Upani@sads however do not require  the performance of any action, but only reveal the ultimate truth  and reality, a knowledge of which at once emancipates a man.  Readers of Hindu philosophy are aware that there is a very strong  controversy on this point between the adherents of the Vedanta  (_Upani@sads_) and those of the Veda. For the latter seek in analogy  to the other parts of the Vedic literature to establish the principle  that the Upani@sads should not be regarded as an exception, but  that they should also be so interpreted that they might also be  held out as commending the performance of duties; but the  former dissociate the Upani@sads from the rest of the Vedic literature  and assert that they do not make the slightest reference to  any Vedic duties, but only delineate the ultimate reality which  reveals the highest knowledge in the minds of the deserving.    30    S'a@nkara the most eminent exponent of the Upani@sads holds that  they are meant for such superior men who are already above  worldly or heavenly prosperities, and for whom the Vedic duties  have ceased to have any attraction. Wheresoever there may be  such a deserving person, be he a student, a householder or an  ascetic, for him the Upani@sads have been revealed for his ultimate  emancipation and the true knowledge. Those who perform the  Vedic duties belong to a stage inferior to those who no longer  care for the fruits of the Vedic duties but are eager for final  emancipation, and it is the latter who alone are fit to hear the  Upani@sads [Footnote ref 1].    The names of the Upani@sads; Non-Brahmanic influence.    The Upani@sads are also known by another name Vedanta, as  they are believed to be the last portions of the Vedas (_veda-anta_,  end); it is by this name that the philosophy of the Upani@sads,  the Vedanta philosophy, is so familiar to us. A modern student  knows that in language the Upani@sads approach the classical  Sanskrit; the ideas preached also show that they are the culmination  of the intellectual achievement of a great epoch. As they  thus formed the concluding parts of the Vedas they retained their  Vedic names which they took from the name of the different  schools or branches (_s'akha_) among which the Vedas were studied  [Footnote ref 2]. Thus the Upani@sads attached to the Brahma@nas  of the Aitareya and Kau@sitaki schools are called respectively  Aitareya and Kau@sitaki Upani@sads. Those of the Ta@n@dins and  Talavakaras of the Sama-veda are called the Chandogya and Talavakara  (or Kena) Upani@sads. Those of the Taittiriya school of the Yajurveda    ___________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: This is what is called the difference of fitness  (_adhikaribheda_). Those who perform the sacrifices are not fit to  hear the Upani@sads and those who are fit to hear the Upani@sads  have no longer any necessity to perform the sacrificial duties.]    [Footnote 2: When the Sa@mhita texts had become substantially fixed,  they were committed to memory in different parts of the country and  transmitted from teacher to pupil along with directions for the  practical performance of sacrificial duties. The latter formed the  matter of prose compositions, the Brahma@nas. These however were  gradually liable to diverse kinds of modifications according to the  special tendencies and needs of the people among which they were recited.  Thus after a time there occurred a great divergence in the readings of  the texts of the Brahma@nas even of the same Veda among different people.  These different schools were known by the name of particular S'akhas  (e.g. Aitareya, Kau@sitaki) with which the Brahma@nas were associated  or named. According to the divergence of the Brahma@nas of the different  S'akhas there occurred the divergences of content and the length of the  Upani@sads associated with them.]    31    form the Taittiriya and Mahanaraya@na, of the Ka@tha school  the Ka@thaka, of the Maitraya@ni school the Maitraya@ni. The  B@rhadara@nyaka Upani@sad forms part of the S'atapatha Brahma@na  of the Vajasaneyi schools. The Is'a Upani@sad also belongs to the  latter school. But the school to which the S'vetas'vatara belongs  cannot be traced, and has probably been lost. The presumption  with regard to these Upani@sads is that they represent the  enlightened views of the particular schools among which they  flourished, and under whose names they passed. A large number  of Upani@sads of a comparatively later age were attached to the  Atharva-Veda, most of which were named not according to the  Vedic schools but according to the subject-matter with which  they dealt [Footnote ref 1].    It may not be out of place here to mention that from the  frequent episodes in the Upani@sads in which the Brahmins are  described as having gone to the K@sattriyas for the highest knowledge  of philosophy, as well as from the disparateness of the  Upani@sad teachings from that of the general doctrines of the  Brahma@nas and from the allusions to the existence of philosophical  speculations amongst the people in Pali works, it may be  inferred that among the K@sattriyas in general there existed earnest  philosophic enquiries which must be regarded as having exerted  an important influence in the formation of the Upani@sad doctrines.  There is thus some probability in the supposition that though the  Upani@sads are found directly incorporated with the Brahma@nas  it was not the production of the growth of Brahmanic dogmas  alone, but that non-Brahmanic thought as well must have either  set the Upani@sad doctrines afoot, or have rendered fruitful assistance  to their formulation and cultivation, though they achieved  their culmination in the hands of the Brahmins.      Brahma@nas and the Early Upani@sads.    The passage of the Indian mind from the Brahmanic to the  Upani@sad thought is probably the most remarkable event in the  history of philosophic thought. We know that in the later Vedic  hymns some monotheistic conceptions of great excellence were  developed, but these differ in their nature from the absolutism of  the Upani@sads as much as the Ptolemaic and the Copernican    _____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Garbha Upani@sad, Atman Upani@sad, Pras'na Upani@sad, etc.  There were however some exceptions such as the Ma@n@dukya, Jabala,  Pai@ngala, S'aunaka, etc.]    32    systems in astronomy. The direct translation of Vis'vakarman or  Hira@nyagarbha into the atman and the Brahman of the Upani@sads  seems to me to be very improbable, though I am quite willing  to admit that these conceptions were swallowed up by the atman  doctrine when it had developed to a proper extent. Throughout  the earlier Upani@sads no mention is to be found of Vis'vakarman,  Hira@nyagarbha or Brahma@naspati and no reference of such a  nature is to be found as can justify us in connecting the Upani@sad  ideas with those conceptions [Footnote ref l]. The word puru@sa no doubt  occurs frequently in the Upani@sads, but the sense and the association  that come along with it are widely different from that of the  puru@sa of the Puru@sasukta of the @Rg-Veda.    When the @Rg-Veda describes Vis'vakarman it describes him  as a creator from outside, a controller of mundane events,  to whom they pray for worldly benefits. \"What was the position, which  and whence was the principle, from which the all-seeing Vis'vakarman  produced the earth, and disclosed the sky by his might? The  one god, who has on every side eyes, on every side a face, on every  side arms, on every side feet, when producing the sky and earth,  shapes them with his arms and with his wings....Do thou, Vis'vakarman,  grant to thy friends those thy abodes which are the highest,  and the lowest, and the middle...may a generous son remain here  to us [Footnote ref 2]\"; again in R.V.X. 82 we find \"Vis'vakarman is  wise, energetic, the creator, the disposer, and the highest object of  intuition....He who is our father, our creator, disposer, who knows  all spheres and creatures, who alone assigns to the gods their names,  to him the other creatures resort for instruction [Footnote ref 3].\"  Again about Hira@nyagarbha we find in R.V.I. 121, \"Hira@nyagarbha arose  in the beginning; born, he was the one lord of things existing. He  established the earth and this sky; to what god shall we offer our  oblation?... May he not injure us, he who is the generator of the  earth, who ruling by fixed ordinances, produced the heavens, who  produced the great and brilliant waters!--to what god, etc.? Prajapati,  no other than thou is lord over all these created things: may we  obtain that, through desire of which we have invoked thee; may we  become masters of riches [Footnote ref 4].\" Speaking of the puru@sa the  @Rg-Veda      __________________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: The name Vis'vakarma appears in S'vet. IV. 17.  Hira@nyagarbha appears in S'vet. III. 4 and IV. 12, but only as the  first created being. The phrase Sarvahammani Hira@nyagarbha which  Deussen refers to occurs only in the later N@rsi@m@h. 9. The word  Brahma@naspati does not occur at all in the Upani@sads.]    [Footnote 2: Muir's _Sanskrit Texts_, vol.

The moment his friends had left him, he began to regret the  confidence he had placed in them, and the frankness with which he  had expressed himself. He retained but a very slight recollection of  all that he had said, but he thought it was quite sufficient to  have aroused the ridicule of those around him. Most painful of all  sensations, the vague sense of a folly committed, the extent and the  consequences of which are alike unknown to us! As he approached  his home it seemed to him that he had profaned his affection for  Marguerite by mentioning her name in that rude society, and broken  her confidence by alluding to his hopes and his fears. While his  secret had been confined to his own breast, or communicated only  to Marguerite, his confidence in himself had never for a moment  been weakened; but now that others were made acquainted with his  convictions and his hopes, they seemed to him exaggerated and  unfounded. He had for a moment forgotten that the chief secret  of success in all undertakings in life is Silence. Silence in the  scheming, silence in the execution, silence in the fulfillment; half  the charm that had given him strength was lost now that he had opened  his breast and disclosed its secrets to others. And it was with a  feeling approaching to disgust that he entered his workroom, and saw  all the material of his great enterprise scattered about the floor.    He went to Marguerite's room. She was sleeping with all the freshness  of youthful dreams glowing on her cheek; after the tumult of the day  the stillness of that room soothed his spirit. He reflected how little  satisfactory were all these pursuits compared to the tranquillity of  home, but then, even as he sat by the bedside, and with her hand in  his, pondered on the past and future--a pageant as it were, robed in  cloth of gold and purple, and laurel-crowned, swept by him; and the  glory of being preeminent among his fellow-men flashed upon his soul.  If he should fail--. A cold damp settled on his brow at the thought,  for in that event all his time had been thrown away, and there was  no possibility of his meeting his various engagements. It was not one  Hoffman but many that beset him, although Hoffman was truly the most  avaricious of his tribe, where all were greedy. And then, as he gazed  on the lovely countenance by his side, he thought of the affection  which had resigned all luxury, and, far above all luxury, that  consideration which women so prize, for him, and that he had brought  her to a home where she had to deny herself many of those comforts  to which she had been accustomed. He regretted the deed. Still more  did he regret the time that he had that night wasted, and the money  that he had squandered; but it was too late for repentance. All  that he could now do was to nerve his energies for the toil of  the morrow--that morrow which comes to all men, the faith of the  procrastinator, the hope of the sufferer, the mercy of the unbeliever.    He awoke in the morning with renewed resolution, but his brow was  still heated with the dissipation of the previous night, and his hand  shook as he applied himself to his work. After a couple of hours,  however, when Marguerite had taken her place by his side, he forgot  Dantzic, Carl, and Krantz, all the annoyances which threatened him. He  was absorbed in his pursuit, and Marguerite was looking over with her  attention not less absorbed than his own, when to their astonishment  the magnificent carriage, with the heavy, sleek, overfed horses, of  the Count Albrecht, rolled up to the door.    \"Look here, Dumiger,\" exclaimed Marguerite, running to the window with  a woman's curiosity flushing her cheek. \"Here is the Grand Master's  carriage--what can he be doing at this house?\"    \"He must be calling on the new arrivals who took the apartments on  the first-floor yesterday,\" said Dumiger, scarcely looking up from his  work, on which all his attention was concentrated.    \"They are beautiful horses, and the manes and tails are decorated with  ribands which would furnish me with sashes for a whole life,\" thought  Marguerite; but she avoided giving utterance to her feeling, lest  Dumiger should interpret it into an expression of regret at having  given up the prospect of ever obtaining all these luxuries.    Marguerite had just left the window when a heavy step was heard on  the stair, and loud knock at the door roused Dumiger from his fit  of abstraction, nearly making him jump from his chair. The impulsive  \"Come in!\" which he uttered, was immediately succeeded by the  appearance of the Count.    Dumiger, like most men of deep thought and habits of abstraction, was  diffident. He stood for some moments thunderstruck without performing  any of the usual courtesies of society. Marguerite in her surprise  imagined that she must have been guilty of some great negligence while  residing in the palace, with which the Count now came to reproach her.    The silence was broken by the Count himself, who nodded kindly, almost  familiarly to Marguerite, and without any further ceremony took the  chair from which Dumiger had just risen.    \"I called to see whether you were comfortable, Marguerite, in your new  abode. It is small,\" continued the Count, as lolling back in his chair  he touched the wall with the back of his head: \"I suppose, however,  that you will some day be able to afford a larger. I do not wish to  trespass upon your confidence, but as I have the liveliest gratitude  for the admirable manner in which you, Marguerite, discharged all your  duties while you were with me, you must let me evince my recollection  of them by a small wedding present.\" And the Count laid a rouleau of  gold pieces on the table.    \"Oh, sir!\" exclaimed Dumiger, seizing the Count's hand with effusion,  \"you are so kind but I can assure you that we are quite happy here.  When one is truly attached to another, the little sacrifices of life  become a pleasure,\" and Dumiger's eyes so filled with tears, that he  did not perceive the quiet, cold sneer on the Count's upper lip; but  Marguerite remarked it. Moreover, she knew the Count well--his vast  ambition, his supercilious pride; she had caught the inflection of  his tone when he spoke to Dumiger, and she knew that when he affected  that winning, cajoling manner, he was always the most dangerous, and  most to be suspected. So her only answer or acknowledgment was a  low courtesy, and the blood mantled in her cheek, but whether from  gratitude or some sterner feeling the Count was unable to divine.    He looked at her for some time under his long gray eyelash; Marguerite  met the look calmly and composedly. Dumiger was bustling about quite  in an ecstacy of delight, and for the time entirely forgot the clock  and the Dom. Not so the Count, he was curiously scanning all the  various parts of the complicated machinery which were lying round him.  He waited until Marguerite should retire before he judged it right  to commence speaking to Dumiger on the subject that was next his  heart, but Marguerite did not seem at all disposed to give him the  opportunity.    Woman's prescience of danger for those she loves is wonderful. Without  being able to assign any definite reason, Marguerite felt that the  man's presence boded her no good; and it was therefore with a troubled  spirit that she heard the Count, after looking several times at his  watch, suggest that he wished to speak to Dumiger alone.    Dumiger looked at Marguerite, who thought it wiser at once to take the  hint than to allow the Count to suppose that she at all questioned the  sincerity of the kind interest which he affected to take in her. He  waited until the door was fairly closed, and then drew his chair near  to Dumiger's. The latter, quite unaccustomed to the neighborhood of  so great a man, immediately withdrew his seat to a more deferential  distance; but the dimensions of the room speedily put a stop to the  retrogression and his modesty by arresting his chair.    \"Don't be afraid,\" said the Count to Dumiger, in a somewhat harsher  tone than he had yet used, for he was an impatient and testy old  man. \"Don't draw your chair back in that way. I wish to speak to you  privately and confidentially.\"    Dumiger held his breath. What could the Grand Master of the Teutonic  Knights have to say to him? for, whatever might be his future  greatness, at all events its promise could be known but to few others.    \"You were out last night,\" continued the Count. \"You went to a  wine-shop--you spoke loudly--you drank deeply.\"    As the Count continued Dumiger's cheeks glowed. The Count must have  heard all that he said. His heart sank within him as he recalled his  weakness; but his mind was soon settled on that point by the Count.    \"And when you spoke,\" continued he, you talked very wildly of becoming  a great man; of obtaining more enduring fame than any of our noblest  citizens. By the bye, you did me the honor to class me amongst those  you were destined to triumph over.\"    \"It was a wild, idle thought,\" said Dumiger, faltering forth a  thousand apologies. \"I did not know what I said. Two friends led me  into this error. I am sure you will forgive me, sir: I was excited;  my brain was in that state I really did not know what I said. Who ever  could have repeated this to your Excellency?\"    \"No one repeated it.\" said the Count, \"so you need not entertain any  mistrust of your friends. One of my household overheard you; and his  ear having caught the sound of my name, he listened attentively, that  is all. But what does it signify? You did just as all young men--ay,  and the best of our young men, do--drank deep of the Rhenish. I like  you the better for it. And then, by all accounts, you had some cause  for excitement, for you believe you are to win the greatest prize that  Dantzic has ever proposed for one of her citizens.\"    The scene of the last night"]]]
