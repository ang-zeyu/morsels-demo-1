[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8390"],[0,"Buddhism and Buddhists in China (#10)"],[1,"   These sects of which the two above are examples are present in all parts  of China. They obey the five Buddhist commandments for laymen. The  members spend much time in fasting and prayer, and in the repetition of  Buddhist books. Their lives as a rule are simple and sincere. They are  preparing for rebirth in the land of Amitâbha, or are expecting the  early coming of the Buddhist Messiah to set this world right. In the  meantime, by means of incantations, personal regimen and cooperative  action they are doing all they can to usher in a better state.    _5. Pilgrimages_    Pilgrimages are very popular in China. The famous Buddhist shrines are  Wu T'ai Shan in Shansi, Puto on the coast of Chekiang, Chiu Hua Shan in  Anhwei, and Omei Shan in Szechuan. These, one on each side of China,  represent the four elements of Buddhist science, wind, water, fire and  earth. They are also the centers of the worship of the four great  Bodhisattvas, Wenshu, Kuan Yin, Titsang and Puhsien. Besides these large  centers there are many others to which pilgrims direct their footsteps.    In the spring of the year, when the god of spring covers the earth with  a green mantle, when the sky and winds call, many start on their  pilgrimage. Many go singly and laboriously, kneeling and bowing every  few steps. Others go in happy companies, chaperoned by a pious, village  dame, who has organized the group. Some go because their turn has come.  They are members of a guild which has a fund devoted to pilgrimages by  its members. Some go for the performance of a vow made to Kuan Yin, when  the father was sick unto death and the goddess prolonged his life. To  others it is the culmination of a pious life. All go for the joy which  travel in the spring gives.    Puto, an island off the coast of Chekiang, is the goal of many pilgrims  from all parts of China. In, the monasteries on the island are about two  thousand monks. In the pilgrim season this number is increased to ten  thousand monks and thousands of lay pilgrims.    A group of pilgrims was going along merrily. The sun was bright,  lighting up the white caps on the deep blue sea. Spring was rioting all  about. One member was an abbot from Hangchow. A small, humble-looking  man with a few straggling long hairs where the mustache usually grows,  was a lay Buddhist from Wuchang. One was a bright young monk from  Tientsin. Last, but almost omnipresent and always bubbling over, was a  servant of the abbot from Hangchow. He was in the presence of divinity  and his whole life was heightened for the time being. \"Why did you  come!\" they were asked. \"We came to worship the holy mother, Kuan Yin.\"  When they entered a shrine each purchased three sticks, of incense and  two candles and reverently placed them before the image of the goddess,  kneeling and bowing. Then they sat and partook of the tea offered by the  attendant. After paying a small gratuity, they went on to the next  shrine.    On the way a large black snake as thick as an arm lazily crossed over  the road. They stood, reverent and awestruck, until he disappeared in  the grass, remarking that this was a good omen. When crossing a sand  dune piled up by the winds the abbot from Hangchow remarked that this  was called the flying sand, wafted there by the goddess who took pity on  some travelers who had been compelled to cross a narrow strait in order  to come to a cave. This cave, called Fan Yin Tung, is one of the rifts  made by an earthquake and washed out by wind and waves. Below it rushes  the tide; from above the sun sends down a few rays. Each pilgrim after  offering incense looks into the darkness to see whether he can behold in  the dark cavern an image of some Buddha. One sees Kuan Yin and is  acclaimed as having had a good vision. Another sees the Laughing Buddha.  All exclaim that he has been the most fortunate of all, for this Buddha  is the Messiah to come and he who beholds him will be blessed. So from  place to place they wander, chatting and seeing the sights of the  island. Thus thousands are doing in various parts of China, and in this  way strengthening the hold of Buddhism upon themselves and their  communities.          VII      BUDDHISM AND THE FUTURE LIFE    Before the advent of Buddhism the Chinese had only a vague idea  regarding life after death. The Land and Water Classic mentions the Tu  Shuo mountain in the Eastern Sea, under which spirits of the dead live,  the entrance guarded by two spirits, Shên Tu and Yü Lei, who are in  general control of the demons. In some parts of China the names or  pictures, of these spirits are placed on the doors of a house to guard  it. The Taoists early developed the idea of a western paradise presided  over by the Queen of the West, located at first in the K'un Lun  mountains and later in the islands of the Eastern Sea. This heaven,  however, was limited to Taoist hermits and mystics. Buddhism made a  complete purgatory and heaven known to every one in China.    _1. The Buddhist Purgatory_    This is really Buddhism's most noteworthy addition to China's religious  equipment; Buddhism lays much stress upon the experiences of a soul  immediately after death. Its punishments are well known to every  individual. The temple of the City Guardian found in every walled city  has a replica of the court in purgatory over which he presides. In the  temples of T'ai Shan there is an elaborate exhibit of the tortures  inflicted on culprits in purgatory. Every funeral service conducted by  Buddhists or Taoists is intended to conduct the soul of the dead through  purgatory and pictures vividly the progressive experiences from the  first seventh day to the seventh seventh day. On the the seventh month,  on the fifteenth day [about August] a special service is held for the  souls of the dead in purgatory. Furthermore, every community has a  general service [about October] for the souls of those who died a  violent death or who have no one to look after them. During the war many  services were thus held for those who died on the battlefields of  Europe. At such services the scenes in purgatory are vividly portrayed  by pictures and figures. The temples distribute tracts with pictures of  purgatory so that women may see them and understand. On the stage are  often acted powerful plays whose scenes are laid in Hades. This  propaganda is perhaps the most efficient of its kind.    Purgatory is depicted as consisting of ten courts each surrounded by  small hells, where the soul undergoes punishment and cleansing. The  fifth court, which may be taken as an example of the other courts, is in  charge of Yen Lo or Yama. Yama was once in charge of the first court,  but his tender heart pitied the souls who came before him and sent them  back to earth. Because of this leniency he was placed in charge of the  fifth court.    When a soul has passed through the first four courts and it has been  discovered that there is no good conduct to its credit, it is led to the  fifth court and examined every seven days regarding past conduct. In  order to get back to the world of men, it eagerly promises to complete  various unfinished vows, such as to repair monasteries, schools,  bridges, or roads, to clean wells, to deepen rivers, to distribute good  books, to release animals, to take care of aged parents, or to bury them  suitably. But it is plainly told that the gods know its artifices, and  that now these unfinished tasks can never be completed. The gods have  reached the unanimous opinion that no injustice is being done.  Accordingly there is no appeal, but each soul is led by attendants with  bulls' heads and horses' faces to a tower whence they may see their  native village. Its front is in the shape of a bow with a perimeter of  twenty-seven miles; its height is four hundred and ninety feet. It is  guarded by walls of sword trees.    Good men, whose deeds of omission are balanced by the good they have  done, return to life. Only souls judged to be evil see their village  from this tower. These can see their own families moving about, and can  hear their conversation. They realize how they disobeyed the teachings  of their elders. They see that the earthly goods for which they have  struggled are of no value. Their plottings rise up with lurid reality.  They see how they planned a new marriage although already married, how  they appropriated fields, state property, and falsified accounts,  putting the blame on persons who were dead. While they observe their  village they behold their erstwhile friends touch their coffin and  inwardly rejoice. They hear themselves called selfish and insincere. But  their punishment does not stop here. They behold their children punished  by magistrates, their women afflicted with strange diseases, their  daughters ravished, their sons led astray, their property taken away,  the ancestral house burned and their business ruined. From this tower  all passes before them as a lurid dream and they are stricken in heart.    About the fifth court are sixteen small hells where the soul is  punished. In each one are stakes buried in the ground and fierce  animals. The hands and feet of the guilty one are bound to a stake, his  body is opened with small knives, and his heart and intestines quickly  devoured.    In each of these sixteen hells is a certain type of sinner: (1) Those  who do not reverence the gods and demons and who doubt the existence of  rewards and punishments; (2) those who hurt and kill living beings; (3)  those who break their vows to do good; (4) those who resort to heterodox  practices and vainly hope to attain eternal life; (5) those who upbraid  good men, fear the wicked and hate men because they do not die speedily;  (6) those who strive with other people and then put the blame upon them;  (7) men who force women; and women who seduce young men, and all who  have libidinous desires; (8) those who gain profit for themselves by  injuring others; (9) the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8417"],[0,"What Led to the Discovery of the Source of the Nile (#10)"],[1,"far as the eye could reach, was a howling,  blank-looking desert, all hot and arid, and very wretched to look  upon. It was the more disappointing, as the Somali had pictured this  to me as a land of promise, literally flowing with milk and honey,  where, they said, I should see boundless prairies of grass, large  roomy trees, beautiful valleys with deep brooks running down them, and  cattle, wild animals, and bees in abundance. Perhaps this was true to  them, who had seen nothing finer in creation; who thought ponies fine  horses, a few weeds grass, and a puny little brook a fine large  stream. At noon we reloaded, and proceeded to join the camels and men  sent forward on the previous day. The track first led us a mile or two  across the hill-top, where I remarked several heaps of stones piled  up, much after the fashion of those monuments the Tibet Tartars erect  in commemoration of their Lahma saints. These, the Somali said, were  left here by their predecessors, and, they thought, were Christian  tombs. Once over the brow of the hill, we descended the slopes on the  south, which fell gently in terraces, and travelled until dark, when  we reached a deep nullah, here called Mukur, in which we found our  vanguard safely encamped in a strong ring-fence of thorn bushes.    The distance accomplished was seventeen miles; the altitude 3660 feet.  The two following days (5th and 6th) we halted to rest the cattle,  whilst I went shooting and collecting. There were a great number of  gazelles and antelopes, some bustard, many florikan and partridges, as  well as other very interesting birds and reptiles. These were mostly  found in ravines at the foot of the hills, or amongst acacia and  jujube trees, with patches of heather in places. We now held  _durbar_,[16] to consult on the plan of proceeding. It was obviously  impossible to march across the plateau directly upon the southern  Dulbahantas, as there was not a blade of grass to be seen nor any  water on the way beyond the first ten miles from the foot of the  hills. To go to Berbera, then, I must perforce pass through the  territories of the northern Dulbahantas; and this was fixed upon. But  hearing of some \"ancient Christian ruins\" (left by Sultan Kin) only a  day's march to the south-eastward, I resolved to see them first, and  on the 7th made a move five miles in that direction to a kraal, called  Karrah, where we found a deep pool of stagnant water.    8th.--My kit was now so much diminished that we all marched together  down a broad shallow valley south-eastward, in which meandered a  nullah, called Rhut Tug, the first wadi I came upon in Nogal. The  distance accomplished was eight miles when we put up in the Kraal of  Rhut; for, as I have said before, there were no villages or permanent  habitations in the interior of the Nogal country. All the little  wooding there is, is found in depressions like this, near the base of  hill-ranges, where water is moderately near the surface, and the trees  are sheltered from the winds that blow over the higher grounds of the  general plateau. Rhut is the most favoured spot in the Warsingali  dominions, and had been loudly lauded by my followers; but all I could  find were a few trees larger than the ordinary acacias, a symptom of  grass having grown there in more favoured times when rain had fallen,  a few puddles of water in the bed of the nullah, and one flock of  sheep to keep the place alive. Gazelles were numerous, and many small  birds in gaudy plumage flitted about the trees, amongst which the most  beautiful was the _Lamprotornis superba_, a kind of Maina, called by  the Somali Lhimber-load (the cowbird), because it follows after cows  to feed.    9th.--Halt. Kin's City, or rather the ruins of it, I was told, lay to  the northward of my camp, in the direction of the hills, at a distance  of about two miles; so I proceeded at once to see it, hoping by this  means I should be able to advance westward on the following day. After  an hour's walk I came upon those remains of which I had heard so much  at first on landing in the country, as indicative of the great  advancement in architectural art of Kin's Christian legion over the  present Somali inhabitants; but I was as much disappointed in this  matter as in all others of Somali fabrication. There were five objects  of attraction here:--1. The ruins of a (said to be) Christian church;  2. The site and remains of a village; 3. A hole in the ground,  denoting a lime-kiln; 4. A cemetery; and, 5. The ground-lines of a  fort. This certainly showed a degree of advancement beyond what the  Somali now enjoy, inasmuch as they have no buildings in the interior,  though that does not say much for the ancients. The plan of the church  is an oblong square, 48 by 27 feet, its length lying N.E. and S.W.,  whilst its breadth was directed N.W. and S.E., which latter may be  considered its front and rear. In the centre of the N.W. wall there  was a niche, which evidently, if built by Christians, was intended to  point to Jerusalem; and this might have been conclusive evidence of  its having been a Christian house of worship, and consequently of  great antiquity, did it not unfortunately point likewise in the  direction of Mecca, to which place all Mohammedans turn when saying  their prayers. Again, I entertained some suspicion that the walls,  which were in some parts ten feet high, had not sufficient decay to  warrant their being four and a half or more centuries old. But one  thing was remarkable at this present time--there were no springs or  any water nearer than my camping place, which could not have been the  case when this place was occupied; but it denoted a certain amount of  antiquity, without any doubt. The walls of the church were composed of  limestone rocks, cemented together with a very pure white lime.    The entrance fronted the niche, and was led up to by a street of round  pebbles, protected on each side by semicircular loosely-thrown-up  stone walls. There was nothing left of the village but its foundation  outlines, which at once showed simplicity of construction, as well as  economy of labour in building. It lay about 50 yards to the east of  the church. One straight wall ran down the centre, from which, as  supports, ran out a number of lateral chambers lying at right angles  to it.    To the northward of the church was the cemetery, in which, strange to  say, if the Somali believe their own story, they even at the present  time bury their dead, and erect crosses at the head of the tombs, in  the same manner as we Christians do. The kiln was an artless hole in  the ground, in which there was a large collection of cinders, and  other debris not worth mentioning. Lastly, the fort, or rather remains  of what the Somali said had been one, was situated on an eminence  overlooking the village, and about 70 yards to the S.W. of the church.  Now, having completed my investigations of the ruins, I returned to  camp, where I was met by the Abban, looking as sulky as a bear with a  sore head, and frowning diabolically. He had been brooding over my  late censures, and reflecting on the consequences his bad conduct  would finally have upon him, if he could not obtain a pardon from me.  And should he not be able to elicit it by fair means, he thought at  any rate he would extract it by foul, then and there, without  condition or any clause whatever. This was preposterous. I frankly  told him exactly what I thought of him, saying I could not forget what  had happened; that he had abused the trust reposed in him by the  English, and I was bound in duty to report the whole matter in every  detail to the Government; but should he discontinue his evil ways, and  take me safely to my journey's end, I would promise him a full pardon  as soon as I arrived at Berbera. This would not answer his  purpose--bygones must be bygones without any condition whatever, and  he went to his bed as wrathful as he rose.    10th.--I rose early and ordered the men to load, but not a soul would  stir. The Abban had ordered otherwise, and they all preferred to  stick, like brother villains, to him. And then began a battle-royal;  as obstinately as I insisted, so obstinately did he persist; then, to  show his superior authority, and thinking to touch me on a tender  point, forbade my shooting any more. This was too much for my now  heated blood to stand, so I immediately killed a partridge running on  the ground before his face. Seeing this, he wheeled about, prepared  his pony, and, mounting it, with his arms agitated and ready for  action, said to the people standing by that he would kill me if I  dared shoot again. I was all this while standing prepared to shoot,  without understanding a word of what was said, when the interpreter  rushed towards me pale and trembling, and implored me not to shoot,  but to arrange matters quietly. He would not tell me, however, what  had occasioned the great anxiety his excited manner showed. I of  course was ready at any time to do anything I could to help me on the  journey, and again stated the terms on which I would grant the man a  pardon. At this juncture, Hassan, the sultan's brother, who had been  absent a few days, came and interceded between us. I told him  everything that had happened, how the Abban had even superseded the  sultan's order, by forbidding me to do what I wished in his country,  and again begged him to be my Abban in Sumunter's stead. This he said  he could not do, but gave Sumunter a wigging, and desired me to go and  shoot anywhere I liked. Thus ended this valuable day.    11th.--Last night I shot a female spotted crocuta hyena (here called  Durwa) in the act of robbing. These tiresome brutes prowl about at  night, and pick up anything they can find. Their approach is always  indicated by a whining sound, which had prepared me on this occasion.  She was caught in the act of stealing away some leather thongs. The  specimen was a fine"]]]
