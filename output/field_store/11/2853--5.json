Unfortunately it is not very  hardy, requiring even in southern England a sunny wall to do it  justice.      ELAEAGNUS.    ELAEAGNUS ARGENTEA.--Silver Berry. North America, 1813. A spreading  shrub 8 feet or 10 feet high, with lanceolate leaves clothed with  silvery scales. The flowers are axillary and clustered, and are  succeeded by pretty, silvery-ribbed berries.    E. GLABRA (_syn E. reflexus_).--From Japan. This is one of the  handsomest species, forming bushes of delightful green, leathery  leaves, and with a neat and rather compact habit of growth. It grows  with great freedom when planted in light, sandy soil, big globose  bushes being the result of a few years' growth. Being perfectly hardy  it is to be recommended if only for the ample leathery, deep green  foliage. The flowers are inconspicuous. There is a form having the  leaves margined with pale yellow, and known under the name of E. glabra  variegata.    E. LONGIPES (_syn E. edulis_ and _E. crisp a_).--Japan, 1873. This  species, is also worthy of culture, whether for the ornamental flowers  or fruit. It is a shrub 6 feet high, bearing an abundance of spotted,  oval red berries on long footstalks. Quite hardy.    E. MACROPHYLLA.--Japan. This is of robust growth, with handsome, dark  green leaves, and purplish branch tips. The leaves are thick of  texture, often fully 3 inches long, glossy-green above, and silvery  beneath. The latter is all the more remarkable, as the leaves have the  habit of curling up their edges, and thus revealing the light, silvery  tint of the under sides. It thrives well in light, sandy peat, and may  be relied upon as one of the hardiest of shrubs.    E. ROTUNDIFOLIA.--An interesting and perfectly hardy species, growing  about five feet high, and remarkable for the great wealth of pretty  scarlet and amber-coloured berries. The flowers are not very showy, but  this is made up by the beautiful silvery leaves, most pronounced on the  under sides, and wealth of fruit, which hangs on long stalks like  Cherries.    Other species of less interest are E. pungens, of which there is a  variegated variety; E. Simoni, a neat Chinese shrub; and E. latifolia,  of good habit and with large leaves. The various species and varieties  of Elaeagnus may all be cultivated in light, free soil, and from  experiments that were recently made, they have been found of great  value for planting by the seaside. They are popularly known as the Wild  Olives and Evergreen Oleasters.      EMBOTHRIUM.    EMBOTHRIUM COCCINEUM.--Fire Bush. South America, 1851. This is a  beautiful shrub, of tall growth, with flowers of great interest and  beauty. Except in warm and favoured situations, it is not very hardy,  and should always be grown as a wall plant. The fiery scarlet,  orange-tinted flowers, resembling somewhat those of the Honeysuckle,  are very beautiful by the first weeks of May. It grows to about 6 feet  in height in southern England, and is, when in full flower, a shrub of  unusual beauty.      EPHEDRA.    EPHEDRA VULGARIS (_syn Ephedra monastachya_), from Siberia, 1772, is a  half-hardy shrub of trailing habit, with inconspicuous flowers.  Thriving in very poor soil, or on rocky situations, is the only reason  why it is introduced here.      EPIGAEA.    EPIGAEA REPENS.--Ground Laurel, or New England Mayflower. Northern  United States, 1736. This is, perhaps, in so far as stature is  concerned, hardly worthy of a place in our list, yet it is such a  pretty and useful shrub, though rarely rising more than 6 inches from  the ground, that we cannot well pass it over. For planting beneath Pine  or other trees, where it can spread about at will, this prostrate shrub  is most at home. There it enlivens the spot with its pretty evergreen  foliage, and sweet-scented, white or pinky flowers. It is quite hardy.      ERCILLA.    ERCILLA SPICATA (_syn Bridgesia spicata_).--Chili, 1840. A  small-growing, half-climbing shrub, with leathery, deep green leaves,  and inconspicuous flowers. Hailing from Chili, it is not very hardy,  but given the protection of a wall, or planted against a tree-stump, it  soon forms a neat mass of evergreen foliage.      ERICA.    ERICA CARNEA.--South Europe, 1763. This is one of the most beautiful  and desirable of hardy Heaths, on account of the richly-coloured  flowers and early season at which they are produced. In the typical  species the flowers are pink or flesh-coloured, and produced in January  and February. It is a dwarf, compact growing species, with bright green  foliage. There is a form with pure white flowers, named E. carnea alba,  or E. herbacea, but although distinct and beautiful, it is not of so  robust growth as the parent.    E. CILIARIS.--A pretty native species, with ciliate glandular leaves,  and racemes of highly-coloured, rosy flowers. Found in Dorsetshire and  Cornwall.    E. CINEREA,--Gray-leaved Heath. In this species, also a native of  Britain, the flowers are of a reddish-purple colour, and borne in dense  terminal racemes. There are numerous varieties, including a  white-flowered E. cinerea alba; E. cinerea atro-purpurea, bearing dark  purple flowers; E. cinerea atro-sanguinea, dark red flowers; E. cinerea  coccinea, scarlet; E. cinerea purpurea, purple flowers; and E. cinerea  rosea, with deep rose-coloured flowers.    E. MEDITERRANEA.--Mediterranean Heath. Portugal, 1648. This is a  robust-growing species, of rather erect habit, and often attaining to  fully a yard in height. Flowers abundantly produced, and of a pretty  pinky hue. Of this there are several varieties, the following being  best known: E. mediterranea hibernica, found in Ireland; E.  mediterranea alba, with white flowers; E. mediterranea nana, of very  dwarf growth; and E. mediterranea rubra, with showy, deep red flowers.    E. SCOPARIA and E. ERECTA are desirable species, the former bearing  greenish flowers, and the latter of decidedly upright growth.    E. TETRALIX.--Cross-leaved Heath. A native species of low, and bushy  growth, with close umbels or terminal clusters of pretty pinky flowers.  The varieties of this most worthy of notice are E. Tetralix alba, white  flowered; E. Tetralix Mackiana, crimson flowered; E. Tetralix rubra,  deep red flowers; and E. Tetralixbicolor, with parti-coloured flowers.    E. VAGANS..--Cornish Heath. A native species, bearing pinky-white  flowers, but there are forms with white and red flowers, named E.  vagans alba and E. vagans rubra.    The various kinds of Heath succeed best either in peaty soil, or that  composed for the greater part of light, sandy loam, but many will grow  and flower freely if planted in rich yellow loam. They are very  desirable plants, either for bed formation, for rockwork ornamentation,  or for planting around the shrubbery margins. Propagation is effected  either by cuttings or sub-divisions, but seedlings of several species  spring up freely under favourable conditions.      ESCALLONIA.    ESCALLONIA FLORIBUNDA (_syn E. montevideusis_).--New Grenada, 1827.  This is one of the handsomest species, bearing long, arching clusters  of white flowers. It is a very desirable shrub for wall or lattice-work  covering, against which it grows rapidly, and soon forms an object of  great beauty by reason of its neat foliage and graceful habit, as also  wealth of pretty flowers.    E. ILLINATA.--Chili, 1830. This should also be included, it being a  handsome and pretty-flowered plant.    E. MACRANTHA.--Chiloe, 1848. This is a general favourite in English  gardens, where it succeeds well, but especially in maritime parts of  the country. It is of stout growth, 6 feet or more in height, of  spreading habit, and with elliptical, serrulated, bright green leaves,  and clusters of crimson-red flowers produced in summer. For  wall-covering this is an almost invaluable shrub, although it succeeds  well as a standard in all but the colder parts of the country. Any  free, open soil suits it well, but thorough drainage must be attended  to. There are several very distinct and good varieties, such as E.  macrantha sanguinea, with flowers deeper in colour than those of the  parent plant; and E. macrantha Ingrami, a profuse-blooming and very  desirable form.    E. PHILLIPIANA.--Valdivia, 1873. When seen as a standard bush, and  loaded with its myriads of tiny white flowers, this must rank amongst  the handsomest members of the family. It is very hardy, and retains its  foliage throughout the winter. The hybrid forms, E. exoniensis and E.  leucantha, deserve recognition, the latter even as late as November  being laden with its small spikes of pretty white flowers, which  contrast nicely with the neat, evergreen foliage.    E. PTEROCLADON.--Patagonia, 1854. This is remarkable for the  curiously-winged branches, which give to the shrub a rather peculiar  and distinct appearance. The freely-produced flowers are white or pink.    E. RUBRA.--Chili, 1827. This has less handsome leaves and flowers than  the above, but it is, all the same, a beautiful plant. The flowers vary  a good deal in depth of colouring, and may be seen of all tints between  pure white and red.    The Escallonias are all of very free growth in any light, warm, sandy,  and well-drained soil, and are readily propagated.      EUCRYPHIA.    EUCRYPHIA PINNATIFOLIA.--Chili, 1880. This shrub, is as yet rare in  cultivation, and is not suited for the colder or more exposed parts of  the country. It is, however, a singularly distinct and beautiful shrub,  with deep glossy-green, pinnate foliage, and bearing large, pure white  flowers, that are rendered all the more conspicuous by the  golden-yellow anthers. As an ornamental shrub it is well worthy of  cultivation. In so far as its hardihood in this climate has to do, it  may be mentioned that in various parts of England and Ireland it has  stood in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10885"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 1 (#11)"],[1,"Saturn crying  out _so loud_, in accordance with the anti-papal indignation of Saint  Pietro Damiano, that the poet, though among them, _could not hear what  they said_--and the blushing eclipse, like red clouds at sunset, which  takes place at the apostle Peter's denunciation of the sanguinary filth  of the court of Rome--all these sublimities, and many more, make us not  know whether to be more astonished at the greatness of the poet or the  raging littleness of the man. Grievous is it to be forced to bring two  such opposites together; and I wish, for the honour and glory of poetry,  I did not feel compelled to do so. But the swarthy Florentine had not  the healthy temperament of his brethren, and he fell upon evil times.  Compared with Homer and Shakspeare, his very intensity seems only  superior to theirs from an excess of the morbid; and he is inferior to  both in other sovereign qualities of poetry--to the one, in giving you  the healthiest general impression of nature itself--to Shakspeare, in  boundless universality--to most great poets, in thorough harmony and  delightfulness. He wanted (generally speaking) the music of a happy and  a happy-making disposition. Homer, from his large vital bosom, breathes  like a broad fresh air over the world, amidst alternate storm and  sunshine, making you aware that there is rough work to be faced, but  also activity and beauty to be enjoyed. The feeling of health and  strength is predominant. Life laughs at death itself, or meets it with  a noble confidence--is not taught to dread it as a malignant goblin.  Shakspeare has all the smiles as well as tears of nature, and discerns  the \"soul of goodness in things evil.\" He is comedy as well as  tragedy--the entire man in all his qualities, moods, and experiences;  and he beautifies all. And both those truly divine poets make nature  their subject through her own inspiriting medium--not through  the darkened glass of one man's spleen and resentment. Dante, in  constituting himself the hero of his poem, not only renders her, in the  general impression, as dreary as himself, in spite of the occasional  beautiful pictures he draws of her, but narrows her very immensity into  his pettiness. He fancied, alas, that he could build her universe over  again out of the politics of old Rome and the divinity of the schools!    Dante, besides his great poem, and a few Latin eclogues of no great  value, wrote lyrics full of Platonical sentiment, some of which  anticipated the loveliest of Petrarch's; and he was the author of  various prose works, political and philosophical, all more or less  masterly for the time in which he lived, and all coadjutors of his  poetry in fixing his native tongue. His account of his Early Life (the  _Vita Nuova_) is a most engaging history of a boyish passion, evidently  as real and true on his own side as love and truth can be, whatever  might be its mistake as to its object. The treatise on the Vernacular  Tongue (_de Vulgari Eloquio_) shews how critically he considered his  materials for impressing the world, and what a reader he was of every  production of his contemporaries. The Banquet (_Convito_) is but an  abstruse commentary on some of his minor poems; but the book on Monarchy  (_de Monarchia_) is a compound of ability and absurdity, in which his  great genius is fairly overborne by the barbarous pedantry of the age.  It is an argument to prove that the world must all be governed by one  man; that this one man must be the successor of the Roman Emperor--God  having manifestly designed the world to be subject for ever to the Roman  empire; and lastly, that this Emperor is equally designed by God to be  independent of the Pope--spiritually subject to him, indeed, but so far  only as a good son is subject to the religious advice of his father;  and thus making Church and State happy for ever in the two divided  supremacies. And all this assumption of the obsolete and impossible the  author gravely proves in all the forms of logic, by arguments drawn from  the history of AEneas, and the providential cackle of the Roman geese!    How can the patriots of modern Italy, justified as they are in extolling  the poet to the skies, see him plunge into such depths of bigotry in his  verse and childishness in his prose, and consent to perplex the friends  of advancement with making a type of their success out of so erring  though so great a man? Such slavishness, even to such greatness, is a  poor and unpromising thing, compared with an altogether unprejudiced  and forward-looking self-reliance. To have no faith in names has been  announced as one of their principles; and \"God and Humanity\" is their  motto. What, therefore, has Dante's name to do with their principles? or  what have the semi-barbarisms of the thirteenth century to do with the  final triumph of \"God and Humanity?\" Dante's lauded wish for that union  of the Italian States, which his fame has led them so fondly to identify  with their own, was but a portion of his greater and prouder wish to see  the whole world at the feet of his boasted ancestress, Rome. Not,  of course, that he had no view to what he considered good and just  government (for what sane despot purposes to rule without that?); but  his good and just government was always to be founded on the _sine qua  non_ principle of universal Italian domination.[35]    All that Dante said or did has its interest for us in spite of his  errors, because he was an earnest and suffering man and a great genius;  but his fame must ever continue to lie where his greatest blame does,  in his principal work. He was a gratuitous logician, a preposterous  politician, a cruel theologian; but his wonderful imagination, and  (considering the bitterness that was in him) still more wonderful  sweetness, have gone into the hearts of his fellow-creatures, and will  remain there in spite of the moral and religious absurdities with which  they are mingled, and of the inability which the best-natured readers  feel to associate his entire memory, as a poet, with their usual  personal delight in a poet and his name.      [Footnote 1: As notices of Dante's life have often been little but  repetitions of former ones, I think it due to the painstaking character  of this volume to state, that besides consulting various commentators  and critics, from Boccaccio to Fraticelli and others, I have diligently  perused the _Vita di Dante_, by Cesare Balbo, with Rocco's annotations;  the _Histoire Litteraire d'Italie,_ by Ginguene; the _Discorso sul Testo  della Commedia_, by Foscolo; the _Amori e Rime di Dante_ of Arrivabene;  the _Veltro Allegorico di Dante_, by Troja; and Ozanam's _Dante et la  Philosophie Catholique an Treixieme Siecle._]    [Footnote 2: Canto xv. 88.]    [Footnote 3: For the doubt apparently implied respecting the district,  see canto xvi. 43, or the summary of it in the present volume. The  following is the passage alluded to in the philosophical treatise  \"Risponder si vorrebbe, non colle parole, ma col coltello, a tanta  bestialita.\" _Convito,--Opere Minori_, 12mo, Fir. 1834, vol. II. p. 432.  \"Beautiful mode\" (says Perticeri in a note) \"of settling questions.\"]    [Footnote 4: _Istorie Fiorentine, II_. 43 (in _Tutte le Opere_, 4to,  1550).]    [Footnote 5: The name has been varied into _Allagheri_, _Aligieri_,  _Alleghieri_, _Alligheri_, _Aligeri_, with the accent generally on the  third, but sometimes on the second syllable. See Foscolo, _Discorso sul  Testo, p_. 432. He says, that in Verona, where descendants of the poet  survive, they call it _Aligeri_. But names, like other words, often  wander so far from their source, that it is impossible to ascertain it.  Who would suppose that _Pomfret_ came from _Pontefract_, or _wig_ from  _parrucca_? Coats of arms, unless in very special instances, prove  nothing but the whims of the heralds.    Those who like to hear of anything in connexion with Dante or his  name, may find something to stir their fancies in the following grim  significations of the word in the dictionaries:    \"_Dante_, a kind of great wild beast in Africa, that hath a very hard  skin.\"--_Florio's Dictionary_, edited by Torreggiano.    \"_Dante_, an animal called otherwise the Great Beast.\"--_Vocabolario  della Crusca, Compendiato_, Ven. 1729.]    [Footnote 6: See the passage in \"Hell,\" where Virgil, to express his  enthusiastic approbation of the scorn and cruelty which Dante chews to  one of the condemned, embraces and kisses him for a right \"disdainful  soul,\" and blesses the \"mother that bore him.\"]    [Footnote 7: _Opere minori_, vol iii 12. Flor. 1839, pp. 292 &c.]    [Footnote 8: \"Beatrix quitta la terre dans tout l'eclat de la jeunesse  et de la virginite.\" See the work as above entitled, Paris, 1840, p. 60.  The words in Latin, as quoted from the will by the critic alluded to in  the _Foreign Quarterly Review_ (No._ 65, art. _Dante Allighieri_), are,  \"Bici filiae suae et uxori D. (Domini) Simonis de Bardis.\" \"Bici\" is  the Latin dative case of Bice, the abbreviation of Beatrice. This  employment, by the way, of an abbreviated name in a will, may seem to  go counter to the deductions respecting the name of Dante. And it  may really do so. Yet a will is not an epitaph, nor the address of a  beatified spirit; neither is equal familiarity perhaps implied, as a  matter of course, in the abbreviated names of male and female.]    [Footnote 9: _Vita Nuova_. ut sup. p. 343]    [Footnote 10: _Vita Nuova_, p. 345.]    [Footnote 11: In the article on _Dante, in_ the _Foreign Quarterly  Review_, (ut supra), the exordium of which made me hope that the  eloquent and assumption-denouncing writer was going to supply a good  final account of his author, equally satisfactory for its feeling  and its facts, but which ended in little better than the customary  gratuitousness of wholesale panegyric, I was surprised to find the  union with Gemma Donati characterised as \"calm and cold,--rather"]]]
