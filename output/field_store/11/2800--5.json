I guess it's a big thing, for he never has acted this way  before--not talking about his work.\"    \"That's right,\" assented Ned. \"But the secret will soon be disclosed, I  fancy. But how is it you aren't going to the dance with Lieutenant  Martin? He told me you had half accepted for to-night.\"    \"I had.\" And if it had been light enough Ned would have seen Mary  blushing. \"I was going with him. It's a dance for the benefit of the  Red Cross to get money for comfort kits for the soldiers. But when Tom  sent word that he'd like to have me present to-night, why--\"    \"Oh, I see!\" broke in Ned, with a little laugh. \"'Nough said!\"    Mary's blushes were deeper, but the kindly night hid them.    Then they conversed on matters connected with the big war--the selling  of Liberty Bonds, the Red Cross work and the Surgical Dressings  Committee, in which Mary was the head of a junior league.    \"Everybody in Shopton seems to be doing something to help win the war,\"  said Mary, and as there was just then a lull in the talk between her  father and Mr. Damon her words sounded clearly.    \"Yes, everybody--that is, all but a few,\" said Mr. Nestor, \"and they  ought to get busy. There are some young fellows in this town that ought  to be wearing khaki, and I don't mean you, Ned Newton. You're doing  your bit, all right.\"    \"And so is Tom Swift!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, as if there had been an  implied accusation against the young inventor.  \"I heard, only to-day,  that one of his inventions--a gas helmet that he planned--is in use on  the Western front in Europe. Tom gave his patents to the government,  and even made a lot of the helmets free to show other factories how to  turn them out to advantage.\"    \"He did?\" cried Mr. Nestor.    \"That's what he did.  Talk about doing your bit--\"    \"I didn't know that,\" observed Mary's father slowly. \"Do you suppose  it's a test of another gas helmet that Tom has asked us out to see  to-night?\"    \"I hardly think so,\" said Ned. \"He wouldn't wait until after dark for  that. This is something big, and Tom must intend to have it out in the  open. He probably waited until after sunset so the neighbors wouldn't  come out in flocks.  There's been a lot of talk about what is going on  in Shop Thirteen, especially since the arrest of the German spies, and  the least hint that a test is under way would bring out a big crowd.\"    \"I suppose so,\" agreed Mr. Nestor. \"Well, I'm glad to know that Tom is  doing something for Uncle Sam, even if it's only helping with gas  helmets. Those Germans are barbarians, if ever there were any, and  we've got to fight them the same way they fight us! That's the only way  to end the war!  Now if I had my way, I'd take every German I could lay  my hands on--\"    \"Father, pretzels!\" exclaimed Mary.    \"Eh? What's that, my dear?\"    \"I said pretzels!\"    \"Oh!\" and Mr. Nestor's voice lost its sharpness.    \"That's my way of quieting father down when he gets too strenuous in  his talk about the war,\" explained Mary. \"We agreed that whenever he  got excited I was to say 'pretzels' to him, and that would make him  remember. We made up our little scheme after he got into an argument  with a man on the train and was carried past his station.\"    \"That's right,\" admitted Mr. Nestor, with a laugh. \"But that fellow was  the most obstinate, pig-headed Dutchman that ever tackled a plate of  pig's knuckles and sauerkraut, and if he had the least grain of common  sense he'd--\"    \"Pretzels!\" cried Mary.    \"Eh? Oh, yes, my dear. I was forgetting again.\"    There was a moment of merriment, and then, after the talk had run for a  while in other and safer channels, Mr. Damon made the announcement:    \"I think we're about there. We'll be at Tom's place when we make the  turn and--\"    He was interrupted by a low, heavy rumbling.    \"What's that?\" asked Mr. Nestor.    \"It's getting louder--the noise,\" remarked Mary. \"It sounds as if some  big body were approaching down the road--the tramp of many feet. Can it  be that troops are marching away?\"    \"Bless my spark plug!\" suddenly cried Mr. Damon. \"Look!\"    They gazed ahead, and there, seen in the glare of the automobile  headlights, was an immense, dark body approaching them from across a  level field. The rumble and roar became more pronounced and the ground  shook as though from an earthquake.    A glaring light shone out from the ponderous moving body, and above the  roar and rattle a voice called:    \"Out out of the way! We've lost control! Look out!\"    \"Bless my steering wheel!\" gasped Mr. Damon, \"that was Tom Swift's  voice! But what is he doing in that--thing?\"    \"It must be his new invention!\" exclaimed Ned.    \"What is it?\" asked Mr. Nestor.    \"A giant,\" ventured Ned. \"It's a giant machine of some sort and--\"    \"And it's running away!\" cried Mr. Damon, as he quickly steered his car  to one side--and not a moment too soon! An instant later in a cloud of  dust, and with a rumble and a roar as of a dozen express trains fused  into one, the runaway giant--of what nature they could only  guess--flashed and lumbered by, Tom Swift leaning from an opening in  the thick steel side, and shouting something to his friends.          Chapter XI    Tom's Tank      \"What was it?\" gasped Mary, and, to her surprise, she found herself  close to Ned, clutching his arm.    \"I have an idea, but I'd rather let Tom tell you,\" he answered.    \"But where's it going?\" asked Mr. Nestor. \"What in the world does Tom  Swift mean by inviting us out here to witness a test, and then nearly  running us down under a Juggernaut?\"    \"Oh, there must be some mistake, I'm sure,\" returned his daughter. \"Tom  didn't intend this.\"    \"But, bless my insurance policy, look at that thing go!  What in the  world is it?\" cried Mr. Damon.    The \"thing\" was certainly going. It had careened from the road, tilted  itself down into a ditch and gone on across the fields, lights shooting  from it in eccentric fashion.    \"Maybe we'd better take after it,\" suggested Mr. Nestor.  \"If Tom is--\"    \"There, it's stopping!\" cried Ned. \"Come on!\"    He sprang from the automobile, helped Mary to get out, and then the  two, followed by Mr. Damon and Mr. Nestor, made their way across the  fields toward the big object where it had come to a stop, the rumbling  and roaring ceasing.    Before the little party reached the strange machine--the \"runaway  giant,\" as they dubbed it in their excitement--a bright light flashed  from it, a light that illuminated their path right up to the monster.  And in the glare of this light they saw Tom Swift stepping out through  a steel door in the side of the affair.    \"Are you all right?\" he called to his friends, as they approached.    \"All right, as nearly as we can be when we've been almost scared to  death, Tom,\" said Mr. Nestor.    \"I'm surely sorry for what happened,\" Tom answered, with a relieved  laugh. \"Part of the steering gear broke and I had to guide it by  operating the two motors alternately. It can be worked that way, but it  takes a little practice to become expert.\"    \"I should say so!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"But what in the world does it all  mean, Tom Swift? You invite us out to see something--\"    \"And there she is!\" interrupted the young inventor. \"You saw her a  little before I meant you to, and not under exactly the circumstances I  had planned. But there she is!\" And he turned as though introducing the  metallic monster to his friends.    \"What is she, Tom?\" asked Ned. \"Name it!\"    \"My latest invention, or rather the invention of my father and myself,\"  answered Tom, and his voice showed the love and reverence he felt for  his parent. \"Perhaps I should say adaptation instead of invention,\" Tom  went on, \"since that is what it is. But, at any rate, it's my  latest--dad's and mine--and it's the newest, biggest, most improved and  powerful fighting tank that's been turned out of any shop, as far as I  can learn.    \"Ladies--I mean lady and gentlemen--allow me to present to you War Tank  A, and may she rumble till the pride of the Boche is brought low and  humble!\" cried Tom.    \"Hurray! That's what I say!\" cheered Ned.    \"That's what I have been at work on lately. I'll give you a little  history of it, and then you may come inside and have a ride home.\"    \"In that?\" cried Mr. Damon.    \"Yes. I can't promise to move as speedily as your car, but I can make  better time than the British tanks. They go about six miles an hour, I  understand, and I've got mine geared to ten. That's one improvement dad  and I have made.\"    \"Ride in that!\" cried Mr. Nestor. \"Tom, I like you, and I'm glad to see  I've been mistaken about you. You have been doing your bit, after all;  but--\"    \"Oh, I've only begun!\" laughed Tom Swift.    \"Well, no matter about that. However much I like you,\" went on Mr.  Nestor, \"I'd as soon ride on the wings of a thunderbolt as in Tank A,  Tom Swift.\"    \"Oh, it isn't as bad as that!\" laughed the young scientist. \"But  neither is it a limousine. However, come inside, anyhow, and I'll tell  you something about it. Then I guess we can guide it back. The men are  repairing the break.\"    The visitors entered the great craft through the door by which Tom had  emerged. At first all they saw was a small compartment, with walls of  heavy steel, some shelves of the same and a seat which folded up  against the wall made of like powerful material.    \"This is supposed to be the captain's room, where he stays when he  directs matters.\" Tom explained. \"The machinery is below and beyond  here.\"    \"How'd you come to evolve this?\" asked Ned. \"I haven't seen half enough  of the outside, to say nothing of the inside.\"    \"You'll have time enough,\" Tom said. \"This is my first completed tank.  There are some improvements to be made before we send it to the other  side to be copied.    \"Then they'll make them in England as well as here, and from here we'll  ship them in sections.\"    \"I don't see how you ever thought of it!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/955"],[0,"The Patchwork Girl of Oz (#10)"],[1,"boy beat fast as he and his companions stood facing the  cave. The opening was perfectly square, and about big enough to admit a  goat.    \"I guess the Woozy is asleep,\" said Scraps. \"Shall I throw in a stone,  to waken him?\"    \"No; please don't,\" answered Ojo, his voice trembling a little. \"I'm in  no hurry.\"    But he had not long to wait, for the Woozy heard the sound of voices  and came trotting out of his cave. As this is the only Woozy that has  ever lived, either in the Land of Oz or out of it, I must describe it  to you.    The creature was all squares and flat surfaces and edges. Its head was  an exact square, like one of the building-blocks a child plays with;  therefore it had no ears, but heard sounds through two openings in the  upper corners. Its nose, being in the center of a square surface, was  flat, while the mouth was formed by the opening of the lower edge of  the block. The body of the Woozy was much larger than its head, but was  likewise block-shaped--being twice as long as it was wide and high. The  tail was square and stubby and perfectly straight, and the four legs  were made in the same way, each being four-sided. The animal was  covered with a thick, smooth skin and had no hair at all except at the  extreme end of its tail, where there grew exactly three stiff, stubby  hairs. The beast was dark blue in color and his face was not fierce nor  ferocious in expression, but rather good-humored and droll.    Seeing the strangers, the Woozy folded his hind legs as if they had  been hinged and sat down to look his visitors over.    \"Well, well,\" he exclaimed; \"what a queer lot you are! At first I  thought some of those miserable Munchkin farmers had come to annoy me,  but I am relieved to find you in their stead. It is plain to me that  you are a remarkable group--as remarkable in your way as I am in  mine--and so you are welcome to my domain. Nice place, isn't it? But  lonesome--dreadfully lonesome.\"    \"Why did they shut you up here?\" asked Scraps, who was regarding the  queer, square creature with much curiosity.    \"Because I eat up all the honey-bees which the Munchkin farmers who  live around here keep to make them honey.\"    \"Are you fond of eating honey-bees?\" inquired the boy.    \"Very. They are really delicious. But the farmers did not like to lose  their bees and so they tried to destroy me. Of course they couldn't do  that.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"My skin is so thick and tough that nothing can get through it to hurt  me. So, finding they could not destroy me, they drove me into this  forest and built a fence around me. Unkind, wasn't it?\"    \"But what do you eat now?\" asked Ojo.    \"Nothing at all. I've tried the leaves from the trees and the mosses  and creeping vines, but they don't seem to suit my taste. So, there  being no honey-bees here, I've eaten nothing for years.    \"You must be awfully hungry,\" said the boy. \"I've got some bread and  cheese in my basket. Would you like that kind of food?\"    \"Give me a nibble and I will try it; then I can tell you better whether  it is grateful to my appetite,\" returned the Woozy.    So the boy opened his basket and broke a piece off the loaf of bread.  He tossed it toward the Woozy, who cleverly caught it in his mouth and  ate it in a twinkling.    \"That's rather good,\" declared the animal. \"Any more?\"    \"Try some cheese,\" said Ojo, and threw down a piece.    The Woozy ate that, too, and smacked its long, thin lips.    \"That's mighty good!\" it exclaimed. \"Any more?\"    \"Plenty,\" replied Ojo. So he sat down on a Stump and fed the Woozy  bread and cheese for a long time; for, no matter how much the boy broke  off, the loaf and the slice remained just as big.    \"That'll do,\" said the Woozy, at last; \"I'm quite full. I hope the  strange food won't give me indigestion.\"    \"I hope not,\" said Ojo. \"It's what I eat.\"    \"Well, I must say I'm much obliged, and I'm glad you came,\" announced  the beast. \"Is there anything I can do in return for your kindness?\"    \"Yes,\" said Ojo earnestly, \"you have it in your power to do me a great  favor, if you will.\"    \"What is it?\" asked the Woozy. \"Name the favor and I will grant it.\"    \"I--I want three hairs from the tip of your tail,\" said Ojo, with some  hesitation.    \"Three hairs! Why, that's all I have--on my tail or anywhere else,\"  exclaimed the beast.    \"I know; but I want them very much.\"    \"They are my sole ornaments, my prettiest feature,\" said the Woozy,  uneasily. \"If I give up those three hairs I--I'm just a blockhead.\"    \"Yet I must have them,\" insisted the boy, firmly, and he then told the  Woozy all about the accident to Unc Nunkie and Margolotte, and how the  three hairs were to be a part of the magic charm that would restore  them to life. The beast listened with attention and when Ojo had  finished the recital it said, with a sigh:    \"I always keep my word, for I pride myself on being square. So you may  have the three hairs, and welcome. I think, under such circumstances,  it would be selfish in me to refuse you.\"    \"Thank you! Thank you very much,\" cried the boy, joyfully. \"May I pull  out the hairs now?\"    \"Any time you like,\" answered the Woozy.    So Ojo went up to the queer creature and taking hold of one of the  hairs began to pull. He pulled harder. He pulled with all his might;  but the hair remained fast.    \"What's the trouble?\" asked the Woozy, which Ojo had dragged here and  there all around the clearing in his endeavor to pull out the hair.    \"It won't come,\" said the boy, panting.    \"I was afraid of that,\" declared the beast. \"You'll have to pull  harder.\"    \"I'll help you,\" exclaimed Scraps, coming to the boy's side. \"You pull  the hair, and I'll pull you, and together we ought to get it out  easily.\"    \"Wait a jiffy,\" called the Woozy, and then it went to a tree and hugged  it with its front paws, so that its body couldn't be dragged around by  the pull. \"All ready, now. Go ahead!\"    Ojo grasped the hair with both hands and pulled with all his strength,  while Scraps seized the boy around his waist and added her strength to  his. But the hair wouldn't budge. Instead, it slipped out of Ojo's  hands and he and Scraps both rolled upon the ground in a heap and never  stopped until they bumped against the rocky cave.    \"Give it up,\" advised the Glass Cat, as the boy arose and assisted the  Patchwork Girl to her feet. \"A dozen strong men couldn't pull out those  hairs. I believe they're clinched on the under side of the Woozy's  thick skin.\"    \"Then what shall I do?\" asked the boy, despairingly. \"If on our return  I fail to take these three hairs to the Crooked Magician, the other  things I have come to seek will be of no use at all, and we cannot  restore Unc Nunkie and Margolotte to life.\"    \"They're goners, I guess,\" said the Patchwork Girl.    \"Never mind,\" added the cat. \"I can't see that old Unc and Margolotte  are worth all this trouble, anyhow.\"    But Ojo did not feel that way. He was so disheartened that he sat down  upon a stump and began to cry.    The Woozy looked at the boy thoughtfully.    \"Why don't you take me with you?\" asked the beast. \"Then, when at last  you get to the Magician's house, he can surely find some way to pull  out those three hairs.\"    Ojo was overjoyed at this suggestion.    \"That's it!\" he cried, wiping away the tears and springing to his feet  with a smile. \"If I take the three hairs to the Magician, it won't  matter if they are still in your body.\"    \"It can't matter in the least,\" agreed the Woozy.    \"Come on, then,\" said the boy, picking up his basket; \"let us start at  once. I have several other things to find, you know.\"    But the Glass Cat gave a little laugh and inquired in her scornful way:    \"How do you intend to get the beast out of this forest?\"    That puzzled them all for a time.    \"Let us go to the fence, and then we may find a way,\" suggested Scraps.  So they walked through the forest to the fence, reaching it at a point  exactly opposite that where they had entered the enclosure.    \"How did you get in?\" asked the Woozy.    \"We climbed over,\" answered Ojo.    \"I can't do that,\" said the beast. \"I'm a very swift runner, for I can  overtake a honey-bee as it flies; and I can jump very high, which is  the reason they made such a tall fence to keep me in. But I can't climb  at all, and I'm too big to squeeze between the bars of the fence.\"    Ojo tried to think what to do.    \"Can you dig?\" he asked.    \"No,\" answered the Woozy, \"for I have no claws. My feet are quite flat  on the bottom of them. Nor can I gnaw away the boards, as I have no  teeth.\"    \"You're not such a terrible creature, after all,\" remarked Scraps.    \"You haven't heard me growl, or you wouldn't say that,\" declared the  Woozy. \"When I growl, the sound echoes like thunder all through the  valleys and woodlands, and children tremble with fear, and women cover  their heads with their aprons, and big men run and hide. I suppose  there is nothing in the world so terrible to listen to as the growl of  a Woozy.\"    \"Please don't growl, then,\" begged Ojo, earnestly.    \"There is no danger of my growling, for I am not angry. Only when angry  do I utter my fearful, ear-splitting, soul-shuddering growl. Also, when  I am angry, my eyes flash fire, whether I growl or not.\"    \"Real fire?\" asked Ojo.    \"Of course, real fire. Do you suppose they'd flash imitation fire?\"  inquired the Woozy, in an injured tone.    \"In that case, I've solved the riddle,\" cried Scraps, dancing with  glee. \"Those fence-boards are made of wood, and if the Woozy stands  close to the fence and lets his eyes flash fire, they might set fire to  the fence and burn it up. Then he could walk away with us easily, being  free.\"    \"Ah, I have never thought of that plan, or I would have been free long  ago,\" said the Woozy. \"But I cannot flash fire from my eyes unless I am  very angry.\"    \"Can't you get angry 'bout something, please?\" asked Ojo.    \"I'll try. You just say '"]]]
