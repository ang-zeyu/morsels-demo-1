The smile of love, the friendly tear,       The sympathetic glow!       Long since, this world's thorny ways       Had number'd out my weary days,       Had it not been for you!       Fate still has blest me with a friend,       In ev'ry care and ill;       And oft a more endearing band--       A tie more tender still.       It lightens, it brightens       The tenebrific scene,       To meet with, and greet with       My Davie, or my Jean!         O, how that name inspires my style!       The words come skelpin, rank an' file,       Amaist before I ken!       The ready measure rins as fine,       As Phoebus an' the famous Nine       Were glowrin owre my pen.       My spaviet Pegasus will limp,       Till ance he's fairly het;       And then he'll hilch, and stilt, an' jimp,       And rin an unco fit:       But least then the beast then       Should rue this hasty ride,       I'll light now, and dight now       His sweaty, wizen'd hide.          Holy Willie's Prayer         \"And send the godly in a pet to pray.\"--Pope.      Argument.    Holy Willie was a rather oldish bachelor elder, in the parish of  Mauchline, and much and justly famed for that polemical chattering,  which ends in tippling orthodoxy, and for that spiritualized bawdry  which refines to liquorish devotion. In a sessional process with a  gentleman in Mauchline--a Mr. Gavin Hamilton--Holy Willie and his  priest, Father Auld, after full hearing in the presbytery of Ayr, came  off but second best; owing partly to the oratorical powers of Mr. Robert  Aiken, Mr. Hamilton's counsel; but chiefly to Mr. Hamilton's being one  of the most irreproachable and truly respectable characters in the  county. On losing the process, the muse overheard him [Holy Willie]  at his devotions, as follows:--         O Thou, who in the heavens does dwell,       Who, as it pleases best Thysel',       Sends ane to heaven an' ten to hell,       A' for Thy glory,       And no for ony gude or ill       They've done afore Thee!         I bless and praise Thy matchless might,       When thousands Thou hast left in night,       That I am here afore Thy sight,       For gifts an' grace       A burning and a shining light       To a' this place.         What was I, or my generation,       That I should get sic exaltation,       I wha deserve most just damnation       For broken laws,       Five thousand years ere my creation,       Thro' Adam's cause?         When frae my mither's womb I fell,       Thou might hae plunged me in hell,       To gnash my gums, to weep and wail,       In burnin lakes,       Where damned devils roar and yell,       Chain'd to their stakes.         Yet I am here a chosen sample,       To show thy grace is great and ample;       I'm here a pillar o' Thy temple,       Strong as a rock,       A guide, a buckler, and example,       To a' Thy flock.         O Lord, Thou kens what zeal I bear,       When drinkers drink, an' swearers swear,       An' singin there, an' dancin here,       Wi' great and sma';       For I am keepit by Thy fear       Free frae them a'.         But yet, O Lord! confess I must,       At times I'm fash'd wi' fleshly lust:       An' sometimes, too, in wardly trust,       Vile self gets in:       But Thou remembers we are dust,       Defil'd wi' sin.         O Lord! yestreen, Thou kens, wi' Meg--       Thy pardon I sincerely beg,       O! may't ne'er be a livin plague       To my dishonour,       An' I'll ne'er lift a lawless leg       Again upon her.         Besides, I farther maun allow,       Wi' Leezie's lass, three times I trow--       But Lord, that Friday I was fou,       When I cam near her;       Or else, Thou kens, Thy servant true       Wad never steer her.         Maybe Thou lets this fleshly thorn       Buffet Thy servant e'en and morn,       Lest he owre proud and high shou'd turn,       That he's sae gifted:       If sae, Thy han' maun e'en be borne,       Until Thou lift it.         Lord, bless Thy chosen in this place,       For here Thou hast a chosen race:       But God confound their stubborn face,       An' blast their name,       Wha bring Thy elders to disgrace       An' public shame.         Lord, mind Gaw'n Hamilton's deserts;       He drinks, an' swears, an' plays at cartes,       Yet has sae mony takin arts,       Wi' great and sma',       Frae God's ain priest the people's hearts       He steals awa.         An' when we chasten'd him therefor,       Thou kens how he bred sic a splore,       An' set the warld in a roar       O' laughing at us;--       Curse Thou his basket and his store,       Kail an' potatoes.         Lord, hear my earnest cry and pray'r,       Against that Presbyt'ry o' Ayr;       Thy strong right hand, Lord, make it bare       Upo' their heads;       Lord visit them, an' dinna spare,       For their misdeeds.         O Lord, my God! that glib-tongu'd Aiken,       My vera heart and flesh are quakin,       To think how we stood sweatin', shakin,       An' p-'d wi' dread,       While he, wi' hingin lip an' snakin,       Held up his head.         Lord, in Thy day o' vengeance try him,       Lord, visit them wha did employ him,       And pass not in Thy mercy by 'em,       Nor hear their pray'r,       But for Thy people's sake, destroy 'em,       An' dinna spare.         But, Lord, remember me an' mine       Wi' mercies temp'ral an' divine,       That I for grace an' gear may shine,       Excell'd by nane,       And a' the glory shall be thine,       Amen, Amen!          Epitaph On Holy Willie         Here Holy Willie's sair worn clay       Taks up its last abode;       His saul has ta'en some other way,       I fear, the left-hand road.         Stop! there he is, as sure's a gun,       Poor, silly body, see him;       Nae wonder he's as black's the grun,       Observe wha's standing wi' him.         Your brunstane devilship, I see,       Has got him there before ye;       But haud your nine-tail cat a wee,       Till ance you've heard my story.         Your pity I will not implore,       For pity ye have nane;       Justice, alas! has gi'en him o'er,       And mercy's day is gane.         But hear me, Sir, deil as ye are,       Look something to your credit;       A coof like him wad stain your name,       If it were kent ye did it.          Death and Doctor Hornbook         A True Story           Some books are lies frae end to end,       And some great lies were never penn'd:       Ev'n ministers they hae been kenn'd,       In holy rapture,       A rousing whid at times to vend,       And nail't wi' Scripture.         But this that I am gaun to tell,       Which lately on a night befell,       Is just as true's the Deil's in hell       Or Dublin city:       That e'er he nearer comes oursel'       'S a muckle pity.         The clachan yill had made me canty,       I was na fou, but just had plenty;       I stacher'd whiles, but yet too tent aye       To free the ditches;       An' hillocks, stanes, an' bushes, kenn'd eye       Frae ghaists an' witches.         The rising moon began to glowre       The distant Cumnock hills out-owre:       To count her horns, wi' a my pow'r,       I set mysel';       But whether she had three or four,       I cou'd na tell.         I was come round about the hill,       An' todlin down on Willie's mill,       Setting my staff wi' a' my skill,       To keep me sicker;       Tho' leeward whiles, against my will,       I took a bicker.         I there wi' Something did forgather,       That pat me in an eerie swither;       An' awfu' scythe, out-owre ae shouther,       Clear-dangling, hang;       A three-tae'd leister on the ither       Lay, large an' lang.         Its stature seem'd lang Scotch ells twa,       The queerest shape that e'er I saw,       For fient a wame it had ava;       And then its shanks,       They were as thin, as sharp an' sma'       As cheeks o' branks.         \"Guid-een,\" quo' I; \"Friend! hae ye been mawin,       When ither folk are busy sawin!\"^1       I seem'd to make a kind o' stan'       But naething spak;       At length, says I, \"Friend! whare ye gaun?       Will ye go back?\"         It spak right howe,--\"My name is Death,       But be na fley'd.\"--Quoth I, \"Guid faith,       Ye're maybe come to stap my breath;       But tent me, billie;       I red ye weel, tak care o' skaith       See, there's a gully!\"         \"Gudeman,\" quo' he, \"put up your whittle,       I'm no designed to try its mettle;       But if I did, I wad be kittle       To be mislear'd;       I wad na mind it, no that spittle       Out-owre my beard.\"         \"Weel, weel!\" says I, \"a bargain be't;       Come, gie's your hand, an' sae we're gree't;       We'll ease our shanks an tak a seat--       Come, gie's your news;       This while ye hae been mony a gate,       At mony a house.\"^2         [Footnote 1: This recontre happened in seed-time, 1785.--R.B.]         [Footnote 2: An epidemical fever was then raging in that        country.--R.B.]         \"Ay, ay!\" quo' he, an' shook his head,       \"It's e'en a lang, lang time indeed       Sin' I began to nick the thread,       An' choke the breath:       Folk maun do something for their bread,       An' sae maun Death.         \"Sax thousand years are near-hand fled       Sin' I was to the butching bred,       An' mony a scheme in vain's been laid,       To stap or scar me;       Till ane Hornbook's^3 ta'en up the trade,       And faith! he'll waur me.         \"Ye ken Hornbook i' the clachan,       Deil mak his king's-hood in spleuchan!

In the  absence of a table, we unrolled a bed and sat down Indian fashion over  a game of cards in which all friendship ceased.    The outfit, with the exception of myself, had come from the same  neighborhood, and an item in Honeyman's letter causing considerable  comment was a wedding which had occurred since the outfit had left. It  seemed that a number of the boys had sparked the bride in times past,  and now that she was married, their minds naturally became reminiscent  over old sweethearts.    \"The way I make it out,\" said Honeyman, in commenting on the news, \"is  that the girl had met this fellow over in the next county while  visiting her cousins the year before. My sister gives it as a  horseback opinion that she'd been engaged to this fellow nearly eight  months; girls, you know, sabe each other that way. Well, it won't  affect my appetite any if all the girls I know get married while I'm  gone.\"    \"You certainly have never experienced the tender passion,\" said Fox  Quarternight to our horse wrangler, as he lighted his pipe with a  brand from the fire. \"Now I have. That's the reason why I sympathize  with these old beaus of the bride. Of course I was too old to stand  any show on her string, and I reckon the fellow who got her ain't so  powerful much, except his veneering and being a stranger, which was a  big advantage. To be sure, if she took a smile to this stranger, no  other fellow could check her with a three-quarter rope and a snubbing  post. I've seen girls walk right by a dozen good fellows and fawn over  some scrub. My experience teaches me that when there's a woman in it,  it's haphazard pot luck with no telling which way the cat will hop.  You can't play any system, and merit cuts little figure in general  results.\"    \"Fox,\" said Durham, while Officer was shuffling the cards, \"your auger  seems well oiled and working keen to-night. Suppose you give us that  little experience of yours in love affairs. It will be a treat to  those of us who have never been in love, and won't interrupt the game  a particle. Cut loose, won't you?\"    \"It's a long time back,\" said Quarternight, meditatively, \"and the  scars have all healed, so I don't mind telling it. I was born and  raised on the border of the Blue Grass Region in Kentucky. I had the  misfortune to be born of poor but honest parents, as they do in  stories; no hero ever had the advantage of me in that respect. In love  affairs, however, it's a high card in your hand to be born rich. The  country around my old home had good schools, so we had the advantage  of a good education. When I was about nineteen, I went away from home  one winter to teach school--a little country school about fifteen  miles from home. But in the old States fifteen miles from home makes  you a dead rank stranger. The trustee of the township was shucking  corn when I went to apply for the school. I simply whipped out my peg  and helped him shuck out a shock or two while we talked over school  matters. The dinner bell rang, and he insisted on my staying for  dinner with him. Well, he gave me a better school than I had asked  for--better neighborhood, he said--and told me to board with a certain  family who had no children; he gave his reasons, but that's  immaterial. They were friends of his, so I learned afterwards. They  proved to be fine people. The woman was one of those kindly souls who  never know where to stop. She planned and schemed to marry me off in  spite of myself. The first month that I was with them she told me all  about the girls in that immediate neighborhood. In fact, she rather  got me unduly excited, being a youth and somewhat verdant. She dwelt  powerful heavy on a girl who lived in a big brick house which stood  back of the road some distance. This girl had gone to school at a  seminary for young ladies near Lexington,--studied music and painting  and was 'way up on everything. She described her to me as black-eyed  with raven tresses, just like you read about in novels.    \"Things were rocking along nicely, when a few days before Christmas a  little girl who belonged to the family who lived in the brick house  brought me a note one morning. It was an invitation to take supper  with them the following evening. The note was written in a pretty  hand, and the name signed to it--I'm satisfied now it was a forgery.  My landlady agreed with me on that point; in fact, she may have  mentioned it first. I never ought to have taken her into my confidence  like I did. But I wanted to consult her, showed her the invitation,  and asked her advice. She was in the seventh heaven of delight; had me  answer it at once, accept the invitation with pleasure and a lot of  stuff that I never used before--she had been young once herself. I  used up five or six sheets of paper in writing the answer, spoilt one  after another, and the one I did send was a flat failure compared to  the one I received. Well, the next evening when it was time to start,  I was nervous and uneasy. It was nearly dark when I reached the house,  but I wanted it that way. Say, but when I knocked on the front door of  that house it was with fear and trembling. 'Is this Mr. Quarternight?'  inquired a very affable lady who received me. I knew I was one of old  man Quarternight's seven boys, and admitted that that was my name,  though it was the first time any one had ever called me _mister_. I  was welcomed, ushered in, and introduced all around. There were a few  small children whom I knew, so I managed to talk to them. The girl  whom I was being braced against was not a particle overrated, but  sustained the Kentucky reputation for beauty. She made herself so  pleasant and agreeable that my fears soon subsided. When the man of  the house came in I was cured entirely. He was gruff and hearty,  opened his mouth and laughed deep. I built right up to him. We talked  about cattle and horses until supper was announced. He was really  sorry I hadn't come earlier, so as to look at a three year old colt  that he set a heap of store by. He showed him to me after supper with  a lantern. Fine colt, too. I don't remember much about the supper,  except that it was fine and I came near spilling my coffee several  times, my hands were so large and my coat sleeves so short. When we  returned from looking at the colt, we went into the parlor. Say,  fellows, it was a little the nicest thing that ever I went against.  Carpet that made you think you were going to bog down every step,  springy like marsh land, and I was glad I came. Then the younger  children were ordered to retire, and shortly afterward the man and his  wife followed suit.    \"When I heard the old man throw his heavy boots on the floor in the  next room, I realized that I was left all alone with their charming  daughter. All my fears of the early part of the evening tried to crowd  on me again, but were calmed by the girl, who sang and played on the  piano with no audience but me. Then she interested me by telling her  school experiences, and how glad she was that they were over. Finally  she lugged out a great big family album, and sat down aside of me on  one of these horsehair sofas. That album had a clasp on it, a buckle  of pure silver, same as these eighteen dollar bridles. While we were  looking at the pictures--some of the old varmints had fought in the  Revolutionary war, so she said--I noticed how close we were sitting  together. Then we sat farther apart after we had gone through the  album, one on each end of the sofa, and talked about the neighborhood,  until I suddenly remembered that I had to go. While she was getting my  hat and I was getting away, somehow she had me promise to take dinner  with them on Christmas.    \"For the next two or three months it was hard to tell if I lived at my  boarding house or at the brick. If I failed to go, my landlady would  hatch up some errand and send me over. If she hadn't been such a good  woman, I'd never forgive her for leading me to the sacrifice like she  did. Well, about two weeks before school was out, I went home over  Saturday and Sunday. Those were fatal days in my life. When I returned  on Monday morning, there was a letter waiting for me. It was from the  girl's mamma. There had been a quilting in the neighborhood on  Saturday, and at this meet of the local gossips, some one had hinted  that there was liable to be a wedding as soon as school was out. Mamma  was present, and neither admitted nor denied the charge. But there was  a woman at this quilting who had once lived over in our neighborhood  and felt it her duty to enlighten the company as to who I was. I got  all this later from my landlady. 'Law me,' said this woman, 'folks  round here in this section think our teacher is the son of that big  farmer who raises so many cattle and horses. Why, I've known both  families of those Quarternights for nigh on to thirty year. Our  teacher is one of old John Fox's boys, the Irish Quarternights, who  live up near the salt licks on Doe Run. They were always so poor that  the children never had enough to eat and hardly half enough to wear.'    \"This plain statement of facts fell like a bombshell on mamma. She  started a private investigation of her own, and her verdict was in  that letter. It was a centre shot. That evening when I locked the  schoolhouse door it was for the last time, for I never unlocked it  again. My landlady, dear old womanly soul, tried hard to have me teach  the school out at least, but I didn't see it that way. The cause of  education in Kentucky might have gone straight to eternal hell, before  I'd have stayed another day in that neighborhood. I had money enough  to get to Texas with, and here I am. When a fellow gets it burnt into  him like a brand that way once, it lasts him quite a while. He 'll  feel his way next time.\"    \"That was rather a raw deal to give a fellow,\" said Officer, who had  been listening while "]]]
