Pinnules variously cut into spinulose-toothed  segments. Indusium smooth, without marginal glands.    The common European type, but in this country far less common than its  varieties. They all prefer rich, damp woods, and because of their  graceful outline and spiny-toothed lobes are very attractive. They can be  transplanted without great difficulty, and the fern garden depends upon  them for its most effective lacework.    Var. _intermedium_ has the scales of the stipe brown with darker center.  Fronds ovate-oblong, often tripinnate. Pinnae spreading, oblong-lanceolate.  Pinnules pinnately cleft, the oblong lobes spinulose-toothed at the apex.  Margin of the indusium denticulate and beset with minute, stalked glands.  In woods nearly everywhere--our most common form. Millions of fronds of  this variety are gathered in our northern woods, placed in cold storage and  sent to florists to be used in decorations.[A] As long as the roots are not  disturbed the crop is renewed from year to year, and no great harm seems to  result. Canada to Kentucky and westward.    [Footnote A: _Horticulture_ reports that twenty-eight million fern leaves  have been shipped from Bennington, Vt., in a single season; and that nearly  $100,000 were paid out in wages.]    [Illustration: Spinulose Shield Fern. _Aspidium spinulosum_ (Maine, 1877,  Herbarium of Geo. E. Davenport)]    [Illustration: _Aspidium spinulosum_, var. _intermedium_]    [Illustration: _Aspidium spinulosum_, var. AMERICANUM]    A tripinnate form of this variety discovered at Concord, Mass., by Henry  Purdie, has been named var. CONCORDIANUM. It has small, elliptical,  denticulate pinnules and a glandular-pubescent indusium.    Var. AMERICANUM (=_dilatatum_, syn.). Fronds broader, ovate or  triangular-ovate in outline. A more highly developed form of the typical  plant, the lower pinnae being often very broad, and the fronds tripinnate.  Inferior pinnules on the lower pair of pinnae conspicuously elongated. A  variety preferring upland woods; northern New England, Greenland to the  mountains of North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and northward.          THE BLADDER FERNS. _Cystopteris_      \"Mark ye the ferns that clothe these dripping rocks,    Their hair-like stalks, though trembling 'neath the shock    Of falling spraydrops, rooted firmly there.\"      The bladder ferns are a dainty, rock-loving family partial to a limestone  soil. (The Greek name _cystopteris_ means bladder fern, so called in  allusion to the hood-shaped indusium.)    (1) THE BULBLET BLADDER FERN    _Cystopteris bulbifera. Filix bulbifera_    Fronds lanceolate, elongated, one to three feet long, twice pinnate. Pinnae  lanceolate-oblong, pointed, horizontal, the lowest pair longest. Rachis and  pinnae often bearing bulblets beneath. Pinnules toothed or deeply lobed.  Indusium short, truncate on the free side. Stipe short.    [Illustration: Bulblet Bladder Fern. _Cystopteris bulbifera_ (Willoughby,  Vt., 1904, G.H.T.)]    [Illustration: Bulblet Bladder Fern. _Cystopteris bulbifera_]    One of the most graceful and attractive of our native ferns; an object of  beauty, whether standing alone or massed with other growths. It is very  easily cultivated and one of the best for draping. \"We may drape our homes  by the yard,\" says Woolson, \"with the most graceful and filmy of our common  ferns, the bladder fern.\" This fern and the maidenhair were introduced into  Europe in 1628 by John Tradescant, the first from America.    It delights in shaded ravines and dripping hillsides in limestone  districts. While producing spores freely it seems to propagate its species  mainly by bulblets, which, falling into a moist soil, at once send out a  pair of growing roots, while a tiny frond starts to uncoil from the heart  of the bulb. Mt. Toby, Mass., Willoughby Mountain, Vt., calcareous regions  in Maine, and west of the Connecticut River, Newfoundland to Manitoba,  Wisconsin and Iowa; south to northern Georgia, Alabama and Arkansas.    (2) THE COMMON BLADDER FERN    _Cystopteris fragilis. Filix fragilis_    Stipe long and brittle. Fronds oblong-lanceolate, five to twelve  inches long, twice pinnate, the pinnae often pinnatifid or cut-toothed,  ovate-lanceolate, decurrent on the winged rachis. Indusium appearing acute  at the free end. Very variable in the cutting of the pinnules.    The fragile bladder fern, as it is often called, and which the name  _fragilis_ suggests, is the earliest to appear in the spring, and the  first to disappear, as by the end of July it has discharged its spores and  withered away. Often, however, a new crop springs up by the last of August,  as if Nature were renewing her youth. In outline the fragile bladder fern  suggests the blunt-lobed Woodsia, but in the latter the pinnae and pinnules  are usually broader and blunter, and its indusium splits into jagged lobes.  Rather common in damp, shady places where rocks abound. In one form or  another, found nearly throughout the world though only on mountains in the  tropics.    [Illustration: Fragile Bladder Fern, Fruited Portion]    [Illustration: Fragile Bladder Fern. _Cystopteris fragilis_ (Wakefield,  Mass.)]          KEY TO THE WOODSIAS    Stipes not jointed:      Indusium ample, segments broad, frond without hairs.                                            Obtuse Woodsia.      Pinnae hispidulous, with white jointed hairs beneath.                                    Rocky Mountain Woodsia.      Fronds bright green, pinnae glabrous, oblong.                                            Oregon Woodsia.      Fronds dull green, lanceolate, glandular beneath.                                        Cathcart's Woodsia.  Stipes obscurely jointed near the base:      Fronds more or less chaffy, pinnae oblong to ovate,      crowded.                               Rusty Woodsia.      Fronds linear, smooth, pinnae deltoid or orbicular.                                            Smooth Woodsia.      Fronds lanceolate, a few white scales beneath; pinnae      deltoid-ovate.                        Alpine Woodsia.          THE WOODSIAS    Small, tufted, pinnately divided ferns. Fruit-dots borne on the back of  simply forked, free veins. Indusium fixed beneath the sori, thin and often  evanescent, either small and open, or early bursting at the top into  irregular pieces or lobes. (Named for James Woods, an English botanist.)    (1) RUSTY WOODSIA. _Woodsia ilvensis_    Fronds oblong-lanceolate, three to ten inches high, rather smooth above,  thickly clothed underneath with rusty, bristle-like chaff. Pinnate, the  pinnae crowded, sessile, cut into oblong segments. Fruit-dots near the  margin often confluent at maturity. Indusium divided nearly in the center  into slender hairs which are curled over the sporangia. Stipes jointed an  inch or so above the rootstock.    [Illustration: Rusty Woodsia, _Woodsia ilvensis_]    The rusty Woodsia is decidedly a rock-loving fern, and often grows on  high cliffs exposed to the sun; its rootstock and fronds are covered with  silver-white, hair-like scales, especially underneath. These scales turn  brown in age, whence the name, rusty. As the short stipes separate at the  joints from the rootstock, they leave at the base a thick stubble, which  serves to identify the fern. Exposed rocks, Labrador to North Carolina and  westward. Rather common in New England. Said to be very abundant on the  trap rock hillocks about Little Falls, N.J., where it grows in dense tufts.    (2) NORTHERN WOODSIA. ALPINE WOODSIA    _Woodsia alpina. Woodsia hyperborea_    Fronds narrowly lanceolate, two to six inches long, smooth above, somewhat  hairy beneath, pinnate. Pinnae triangular-ovate, obtuse, lobed, the lobes  few and nearly entire. Fruit-dots rarely confluent. Indusium as in _Woodsia  ilvensis_.    [Illustration: Details of Northern Woodsia. _Woodsia alpina_]    Thought by some botanists to be a smooth form of _Woodsia ilvensis_. It  was discovered in the United States by Horace Mann, in 1863, at Willoughby  Lake, Vt. Twenty years or more later it was collected by C.H. Peck in the  Adirondacks, who supposed it to be _Woodsia_ _glabella_. In 1897 it was  rediscovered at Willoughby Lake by C.H. Pringle. New York, Vermont, Maine,  and British America. Rare.    [Illustration: Northern Woodsia, _Woodsia alpina_ (From Waters' \"Ferns,\"  Henry Holt & Co.)]    (3) BLUNT-LOBED WOODSIA. _Woodsia obtusa_    Fronds broadly lanceolate, ten to eighteen inches long, nearly twice  pinnate, often minutely glandular. Pinnae rather remote, triangular-ovate  or oblong, pinnately parted into obtuse, oblong, toothed segments.  Veins forked. Fruit-dots on or near the margin of the lobes. Indusium  conspicuous, at length splitting into several spreading, jagged lobes.    [Illustration: Blunt-lobed Woodsia. _Woodsia obtusa_]    This is our most common species of Woodsia and it has a wider range than  the others, extending from Maine and Nova Scotia to Georgia and westward.  On rocky banks and cliffs. The sori of this species have a peculiar beauty  on account of the star-shaped indusium, as it splits into fragments. Var.  _angusta_ is a form with very narrow fronds and pinnae. Highlands, New York.  The type grows in Middlesex County, Mass., but is rare.    (4) SMOOTH WOODSIA. _Woodsia glabella_    Fronds two to five inches high, very delicate, linear, pinnate. Pinnae  remote at the base, roundish-ovate, very obtuse with a few crenate lobes.  Stipes jointed, straw-colored. Hairs of the indusium few and minute.    [Illustration: Smooth Woodsia. _Woodsia glabella_ (Willoughhy Mountain, Vt.

They never kept the others waiting for  them either for dinner or tea, or for their walks; and they were in less  haste, especially in the evenings, to leave the table. This did not  escape Charlotte's observation; she watched them both, to see whether  one more than the other was the occasion of it. But she could not  perceive any difference. They had both become more companionable. In  their conversation they seemed to consider what was best adapted to  interest Ottilie; what was most on a level with her capacities and her  general knowledge. If she left the room when they were reading or  telling stories, they would wait till she returned. They had grown  softer and altogether more united.    In return for this, Ottilie's anxiety to be of use increased every day;  the more she came to understand the house, its inmates, and their  circumstances, the more eagerly she entered into everything, caught  every look and every motion; half a word, a sound, was enough for her.  With her calm attentiveness, and her easy, unexcited activity, she was  always the same. Sitting, rising up, going, coming, fetching, carrying,  returning to her place again, it was all in the most perfect repose; a  constant change, a constant agreeable movement; while, at the same time,  she went about so lightly that her step was almost inaudible.    This cheerful obligingness in Ottilie gave Charlotte the greatest  pleasure. There was one thing, however, which she did not exactly like,  of which she had to speak to her. \"It is very polite in you,\" she said  one day to her, \"when people let anything fall from their hand, to be so  quick in stooping and picking it up for them; at the same time, it is a  sort of confession that they have a right to require such attention, and  in the world we are expected to be careful to whom we pay it. Toward  women, I will not prescribe any rule as to how you should conduct  yourself. You are young. To those above you, and older than you,  services of this sort are a duty; toward your equals they are polite; to  those younger than yourself and your inferiors you may show yourself  kind and good-natured by such things--only it is not becoming in a young  lady to do them for men.\"    \"I will try to forget the habit,\" replied Ottilie; \"I think, however,  you will in the meantime forgive me for my want of manners, when I tell  you how I came by it. We were taught history at school; I have not  gained as much out of it as I ought, for I never knew what use I was to  make of it; a few little things, however, made a deep impression upon  me, among which was the following: When Charles the First of England  was standing before his so-called judges, the gold top came off the  stick which he had in his hand, and fell down. Accustomed as he had been  on such occasions to have everything done for him, he seemed to look  around and expect that this time too some one would do him this little  service. No one stirred, and he stooped down for it himself. It struck  me as so piteous, that from that moment I have never been able to see  any one let a thing fall, without myself picking it up. But, of course,  as it is not always proper, and as I cannot,\" she continued, smiling,  \"tell my story every time I do it, in future I will try to contain  myself.\"    In the meantime the fine arrangements which the two friends had been led  to make for themselves, went uninterruptedly forward. Every day they  found something new to think about and undertake.    One day as they were walking together through the village, they had to  remark with dissatisfaction how far behind-hand it was in order and  cleanliness, compared to villages where the inhabitants were compelled  by the expense of building-ground to be careful about such things.    \"You remember a wish we once expressed when we were traveling in  Switzerland together,\" said the Captain, \"that we might have the laying  out of some country park, and how beautiful we would make it by  introducing into some village situated like this, not the Swiss style of  building, but the Swiss order and neatness which so much improve it.\"    \"And how well it would answer here! The hill on which the castle stands,  slopes down to that projecting angle. The village, you see, is built in  a semicircle, regularly enough, just opposite to it. The brook runs  between. It is liable to floods; and do observe the way the people set  about protecting themselves from them; one with stones, another with  stakes; the next puts up a boarding, and a fourth tries beams and  planks; no one, of course, doing any good to another with his  arrangement, but only hurting himself and the rest too. And then there  is the road going along just in the clumsiest way possible,--up hill and  down, through the water, and over the stones. If the people would only  lay their hands to the business together, it would cost them nothing but  a little labor to run a semi-circular wall along here, take the road in  behind it, raising it to the level of the houses, and so give themselves  a fair open space in front, making the whole place clean, and getting  rid, once for all, in one good general work, of all their little  trifling ineffectual makeshifts.\"    \"Let us try it,\" said the Captain, as he ran his eyes over the lay of  the ground, and saw quickly what was to be done.    \"I can undertake nothing in company with peasants and shopkeepers,\"  replied Edward, \"unless I may have unrestricted authority over them.\"    \"You are not so wrong in that,\" returned the Captain; \"I have  experienced too much trouble myself in life in matters of that kind. How  difficult it is to prevail on a man to venture boldly on making a  sacrifice for an after-advantage! How hard to get him to desire an end,  and not hesitate at the means! So many people confuse means with ends;  they keep hanging over the first, without having the other before their  eyes. Every evil is to be cured at the place where it comes to the  surface, and they will not trouble themselves to look for the cause  which produces it, or the remote effect which results from it. This is  why it is so difficult to get advice listened to, especially among the  many: they can see clearly enough from day to day, but their scope  seldom reaches beyond the morrow; and if it comes to a point where with  some general arrangement one person will gain while another will lose,  there is no prevailing on them to strike a balance. Works of public  advantage can be carried through only by an uncontrolled absolute  authority.\"    While they were standing and talking, a man came up and begged of them.  He looked more impudent than really in want, and Edward, who was  annoyed at being interrupted, after two or three fruitless attempts to  get rid of him by a gentler refusal, spoke sharply to him. The fellow  began to grumble and mutter abusively; he went off with short steps,  talking about the right of beggars. It was all very well to refuse them  an alms, but that was no reason why they should be insulted. A beggar,  and everybody else too, was as much under God's protection as a lord. It  put Edward out of all patience.    The Captain, to pacify him, said, \"Let us make use of this as an  occasion for extending our rural police arrangements to such cases. We  are bound to give away money, but we do better in not giving it in  person, especially at home. We should be moderate and uniform in  everything, in our charities as in all else; too great liberality  attracts beggars instead of helping them on their way. At the same time  there is no harm when one is on a journey, or passing through a strange  place, in appearing to a poor man in the street in the form of a chance  deity of fortune and making him some present which shall surprise him.  The position of the village and of the castle makes it easy for us to  put our charities here on a proper footing. I have thought about it  before. The public-house is at one end of the village, a respectable old  couple live at the other. At each of these places deposit a small sum of  money, and let every beggar, not as he comes in, but as he goes out,  receive something. Both houses lie on the roads which lead to the  castle, so that any one who goes there can be referred to one or the  other.\"    \"Come,\" said Edward, \"we will settle that on the spot. The exact sum can  be made up another time.\"    They went to the innkeeper, and to the old couple and the thing was  done.    \"I know very well,\" Edward said, as they were walking up the hill to the  castle together, \"that everything in this world depends on distinctness  of idea and firmness of purpose. Your judgment of what my wife has been  doing in the park was entirely right; and you have already given me a  hint how it might be improved. I will not deny that I told her of it.\"    \"So I have been led to suspect,\" replied the Captain; \"and I could not  approve of your having done so. You have perplexed her. She has left off  doing anything; and on this one subject she is vexed with us. She avoids  speaking of it. She has never since invited us to go with her to the  summer-house, although at odd hours she goes up there with Ottilie.\"    \"We must not allow ourselves to be deterred by that,\" answered Edward.  \"If I am once convinced about anything good, which could and should be  done, I can never rest till I see it done. We are clever enough at other  times in introducing what we want, into the general conversation;  suppose we have out some descriptions of English parks, with  copper-plates, for our evening's amusement. Then we can follow with your  plan. We will treat it first problematically, and as if we were only in  jest. There will be no difficulty in passing into earnest.\"    The scheme was concerted, and the books were opened. In each group of  designs they first saw a ground-plan of the spot, with the general  character of the landscape,"]]]
