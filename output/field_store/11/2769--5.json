These beaters are much like  so many soup kettles. Upon the kind, number, and proportion of the  ingredients depends the nature of the product. The percentages of rag  pulp, wood pulp, clay, coloring, etc., used, depend upon the quality of  paper ordered.    After the final beating, the mixture descends into a large reservoir  called the \"stuff chest,\" whence it is pumped to the paper machine. The  pulp is of the consistency of milk when it pours from the spout of  the pumps on the paper machine. The latter is a complicated series of  rollers, belts, sieves, blankets, pumps, and gears, one hundred feet  long. To describe it or to understand a description of it would require  the vocabulary and the knowledge of a scientist. The milky pulp first  passes over a belt of fine wire cloth, through which the water partly  drains. It is ingeniously made to glide over two perforated iron plates,  under which pumps are constantly sucking. You can plainly see the broad  sheet of pulp lose its water and gain thickness as it goes over these  plates. Broad, blanket-like belts of felt take it and carry it over and  between large rolling cylinders filled with hot steam. These dry and  harden it into a sheet which will support itself; and without the aid of  blankets it winds among iron rolls, called calenders, which squeeze it  and give it surface. It is wound upon revolving reels at the end of the  machine.    If a better surface or gloss is required, it is carried to the super  calendering mill, where it is steamed and subjected to a long and  circuitous journey up and down tall stands of calenders upon calenders.  The paper is cut by machines having long, winding knives which revolve  slowly and cut, on the scissors principle--no two points of the blade  bearing on the paper with equal pressure at once. Girls pack the sheets  on the tables as they fall from the cutters, and throw out the damaged  or dirtied sheets. A small black spot or hole or imperfection of any  sort is sufficient to reject a sheet. In some orders fifty per cent. of  the sheets are thrown out. There is no waste, as the damaged paper is  ground into pulp again. Having been cut, the paper must be counted and  folded. Then it is packed into bundles for shipment. The young lady who  does the counting and folding is the wonder of the mill. Giving the  sheets a twist with one hand so as to spread open the edges, she gallops  the fingers of the other hand among them; and as quickly as you or I  could count three, she counts twenty-four and folds the quire. She takes  four sheets with a finger and goes her whole hand and one finger more;  thus she gets twenty-four sheets. Long practice is required to do the  counting rapidly and accurately. Twenty-four sheets, no more and no  less, are always found in her quires.    Papers of different grades are made of different stock, but by the same  process. Some paper stock is used. This must be bleached in lime and  soda ash. There are powerful steam engines in the mills for use when  the water is low. There are large furnaces and boilers which supply the  steam used in the processes.    The Messrs. Denison employ 175 hands at Mechanic Falls. Their pay roll  amounts to about $5,000 per month. The mills produce 350,000 pounds of  paper per month and they ship several car-loads of prepared wood-pulp,  in excess of that required for their own use, weekly. The annual value  of their product is not far from $300,000. They use, for sundries,  each month, 300 tons of coal, 100 casks of common lime, 250 gallons of  burning-oil, 28,000 pounds of chlorate of lime, 3,700 pounds of soda  ash. 10,000 pounds of resin. 24,000 pounds of sal soda, 22,000 pounds of  oil of vitriol, 22,000 pounds of China clay, etc.           *       *       *       *       *          WHEAT-MEAL BREAD AS A MEANS OF DIMINISHING TUBERCULAR DISEASE.      By M. YATES, Hon. Sec. Bread Reform League, London.    It is well recognized that defective mineral nutrition is an important  factor in the production of rickets and bad teeth, but as its  influence in predisposing toward tuberculous disease is not so clearly  ascertained, will you kindly allow public attention to be directed to  a statement which was discussed at the Social Science and Sanitary  Congresses and which, if confirmed by further scientific research,  indicates a simple means of diminishing consumption, which, as Dr.  William Fair, F.R.S., says, \"is the greatest, the most constant, and the  most dreadful of all the diseases that affect mankind.\" In \"Phosphates  in Nutrition,\" by Mr. M.F. Anderson, it is stated that although the  external appearances and general condition of a body when death has  occurred from starvation are very similar to those presented in  tuberculous disease, in starvation, \"from wasting of the tissues, caused  by the combustion of their organic matter, there would be an apparent  _increase_ in the percentage proportion of mineral matter; on the other  hand, in tubercular disease, there would be a material _decrease_ in the  mineral matter as compared with the general wasting.\" Analyses, made  by Mr. Anderson, of the vascular tissues of patients who have died  of consumption, scrofula, and allied diseases, show \"a very marked  deficiency in the quantity of inorganic matter entering into their  composition; this deficiency is not confined to the organs or tissues  which are apparently the seat of the disease, but in a greater or lesser  degree pervades the whole capillary system.\"    The observations of Dr. Marcet, F.R.S., show that in phthisis there is  a considerable reduction of the normal amount of phosphoric acid in the  pulmonary tissues; and it is very probable that there is a general drain  of phosphoric acid from the system.    This loss may be caused by the expectoration and night-sweats, or it may  also be produced by defective mineral nutrition, either from deficient  supply in the food, or from non assimilation. But, whatever causes this  deficiency, it is universally acknowledged that it is essential the food  should contain a proper supply of the mineral elements. If the body is  well nourished, the resisting force of the system is raised. Professor  Koch and others, who accept the germ theory of disease to its fullest  extent, state that the minute organisms of tubercular disease do not  occur in the tissues of healthy bodies, and that when introduced into a  living body their propagation and increase are greatly favored by a low  state of the general health.    Dr. Pavy, F.R.S., showed in his address on the \"Dietetics of Bread\" that  in white flour, instead of obtaining the 23 parts of mineral matter  to 100 parts of nitrogenous matter--which is the accepted ratio of  a standard diet--we should only get 4.20 parts of mineral matter.  Professor Church states that 1 lb. of white flour has only 49 grains of  mineral matter, while 1 lb. of whole wheat meal has 119 grains. Whole  wheat meal, besides containing other essential mineral elements,  has double the amount of lime, and nearly three times the amount of  phosphoric acid; so that if defective mineral nutrition in any way  predisposes to consumption, the adoption of wheat meal prepared in a  digestible and palatable form is of primary importance for those who are  unable to obtain the phosphates from high-priced animal foods.    Wheat meal has also great advantages for those who are able to afford  animal food, for, as Dr. Pavy stated, \"It acts as a greater stimulant to  the digestive organs.\"    It is probably due to this stimulating property of wheat meal that  people who have adopted it find they can digest animal fat much better  than previously. If this is corroborated by general experience, it may  be of great benefit in aiding the system to resist tendencies toward  consumption and scrofula, for these diseases are generally accompanied  by loss of the power of assimilating fat. It is believed that a  deficiency of oleaginous matter is a predisposing cause of tuberculous  disease. An important prophylactic, therefore, against such maladies,  would be a general increase in the use of butter and other fatty foods.    There is such good reason to believe that a low state of nutrition  favors the development of tuberculous disease, that parents cannot be  too strongly urged to provide their children with a proper supply of  healthy, nourishing, and pure food (under which term must, of course, be  included pure air and pure water), for by so doing they may often arrest  consumptive tendencies, and thus would be diminished the ravages of  that fatal disease which, when once established, is \"the despair of the  physician, and the terror of the public.\"           *       *       *       *       *          THE NEW YORK FISH COMMISSION PONDS AT CALEDONIA.      The capacity of the New York State fish farm at Caledonia is 6,000,000  fry a year. The recently issued report of the fish commissioners says  that this year the ponds will be worked to their full capacity.    The supply of spawn has been greater than could be hatched there, and  supplies were sent to responsible persons in every State in the Union to  be experimented with. At the date of issuing the report the supply of  stock fish at the hatchery embraced, it was estimated, a thousand salmon  trout, of weights ranging from four to twelve pounds; ten thousand  brook trout, from half a pound to two pounds in weight; thirty thousand  California mountain trout, weighing from a quarter of a pound to three  pounds; forty-seven hundred rainbow trout, of from a quarter of a  pound to two pounds' weight; and a large number of hybrids produced by  crossing and interbreeding of different members of the salmon tribe. In  this connection reference is made to the interesting fact that hybrids  of the fish family are not barren.

It is  equally so to speak of business matters to any man in general  society. Business men do not go into the world of polite society  to carry their shop, and they will not thank you for reminding  them of work in their hours of relaxation.    Do not commence any conversation by the suggestion of painful or  disagreeable topics. To ask a friend abruptly, \"For whom are you  in mourning?\" may be tearing open anew a wound that was covered  for the time by intercourse with society. Take other steps to  satisfy yourself on this point. By the same token, do not say to a  man, \"That was an unfortunate affair, that failure of yours.\"  Never, directly or indirectly, rub a sore.    Do not ask questions which relate to the private affairs of the  person spoken to, and be guarded against conduct which may look  like an attempt to force confidence. If too persevering in your  inquiries you may be treated, and very properly, as one might  treat a highwayman who sought to rob one of any other property. A  man's thoughts are certainly his own most private possession, and  you must be very intimate to seek to be admitted to a share in  them. Even if you are so, it is far more delicate to wait until  confidence is offered to you. A man has a perfect right to defend  himself from cross-examination by any means, except positive  falsehood.    In conversing with foreigners do not disparage any of their  national customs, even if they are rude enough to attack yours.  You may, pleasantly and frankly, defend the institutions of your  native land, but not by comparison with the customs of other  countries. If your companion is well-bred, he will admit that you  possibly understand American customs better than a foreigner can  do; if he is a low-bred man, no rudeness on your part will correct  his manners or views.    Subjects or incidents calculated to disgust the hearers, are to be  avoided in polite conversation. There is a positive fascination to  some people in describing sickening or revolting scenes, but well-  bred people will remember that some are sensitive upon such  subjects, and all would prefer more agreeable topics.    Do not use surnames alone, even if speaking of intimate friends.  For a lady to speak of her husband as \"Smith\" or \"Jones,\" is  vulgar in the extreme, and it is low-bred also to say \"my  husband,\" \"my wife\" or, except amongst relatives, to use the  Christian name only, in speaking of husband or wife. Speak of your  own husband or wife as, \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs. B---,\" and of your friends  also by the surname prefix as, \"Remember me to Mr. or Mrs. D.\"    Let no more than one person be speaking at one time.    Ridicule and personal joking cannot be too severely censured.    Avoid an officious offer of advice or your own opinion, and if you  do give an opinion, be sure it is given as such and not as a fact.    If you would preserve a character for truthfulness, avoid the too  common fault of exaggeration.    When visiting, be careful that you do not appear to undervalue  anything around you by comparing it with what you have at home.    Beware of personal abuse or invective. Remember what Shakespeare  put into the month of Cardinal Wolsey, when the Earl of Surrey  said to him on his disgrace:    \"Now if you can blush and cry 'guilty' Cardinal,  You'll show a little honesty.\"    Mark the proud dignity of the prelate's reply:    \"Speak on, sir;  I dare your worst objections: If I blush  It is to see a nobleman want manners.\"    Punning is a vulgarism that should be scrupulously avoided. An  inveterate punster, though his play upon words may rise to the  keenest wit, is yet an insufferable bore. No one feels secure in  his society, or can guess what word may be torn out of a serious  or brilliant remark to be tortured into a vulgar witticism, out of  place and uncalled for.    Proverbs are not in good taste when introduced into conversation.    Scriptural phrases are apt to subject the speaker to a suspicion  of insincerity, and should be used very seldom, and with the  utmost reverence.    Cant is simply detestable.    Religion is a subject too apt to lead to long arguments if not to  positive altercation to be the subject of general conversation.    Repartee is not a weapon for every-day use. There are few who can  wield this polished blade skillfully, and when clumsy hands grasp  it, it will wound both speaker and hearer.    The talented author of \"Good Society,\" says:    \"The great secret of talking well is to adapt your conversation as  skillfully as may be to your company. Some men make a point of  talking commonplace to all ladies alike, as if a woman could only  be a trifler. Others, on the contrary, seem to forget in what  respects the education of a lady differs from that of a gentleman,  and commit the opposite error of conversing on topics with which  ladies are seldom acquainted. A woman of sense has as much right  to be annoyed by the one, as a lady of ordinary education by the  other. You cannot pay a finer compliment to a woman of refinement  and _esprit_, than by leading the conversation into such a channel  as may mark your appreciation of her superior attainments.    \"It should be remembered that people take more interest in their  own affairs than in anything else which you can name. In _tete-a-  tete_ conversations, therefore, lead a mother to talk of her  children, a young lady of her last ball, an author of his  forthcoming book, or an artist of his exhibition picture. Having  furnished the topic, you need only listen; and you are thought not  only agreeable, but thoroughly sensible, amiable and well-  informed.    \"Be careful, on the other hand, not always to make a point of  talking to persons upon general matters relating to their  professions. To show an interest in their immediate concerns is  flattering, but to converse with them too much about their own art  or profession, looks as if you thought them ignorant of other  topics.    \"Remember in conversation that a voice 'gentle and low' is, above  all other extraneous accomplishments, an excellent thing in woman.  There is a certain distinct but subdued tone of voice which is  peculiar to persons only of the best breeding. It is better to err  by the use of too low than too loud a tone. Loud laughter is  extremely objectionable in society.    \"Conversation is a reflex of character. The pretentious, the  illiterate, the impatient, the curious, will as inevitably betray  their idiosyncrasies as the modest, the even tempered and the  generous. Strive as we may, we cannot always be acting. Let us,  therefore, cultivate a tone of mind, and a habit of life, the  betrayal of which need not put us to shame in the company of the  pure and wise, and the rest will be easy. If we make ourselves  worthy of refined and intelligent society, we shall not be  rejected from it; and in such society we shall acquire by example  all that we have failed to learn from precept.\"    If you are conversing, when interrupted by a visitor, and, after  the customary greetings, resume the conversation, you must  recapitulate the substance of it for the benefit of the new comer.    To invariably commence a conversation by remarks on the weather  shows a poverty of ideas that is truly pitiable.    Do not constantly repeat the name of a person with whom you are  conversing.    A person who has travelled will probably be severely ridiculed if  constantly referring to \"the winter I spent in Florence,\" or \"when  I was in London.\"    If conversation takes a tone that is offensive to good taste,  charity or justice, be silent.    Do not be too ready to correct any statement you may deem untrue.  You may be yourself mistaken.      INVITATIONS.    ALL invitations, excepting dinner invitations, are issued in the  name of the lady of the house alone. Dinner invitations are issued  in the name of the gentleman and lady of the house, or when  extended to gentlemen only, in the name of the host alone. Answers  to invitations, excepting such dinner invitations as are issued in  the name of the gentleman only, must be addressed to the lady of  the house.    When invitations are issued in the height of a fashionable season,  it is best to send them out at least a fortnight beforehand. For a  small company, and when gayety is not at its height, a week's  notice is sufficient. For a costume ball, private theatricals or  any occasion when elaborate dresses or preparations are needed, a  month should be given.    Printed cards of invitation are not _en regle_, excepting for  public occasions. A small note paper is the only appropriate one,  and may have the initial letter or monogram stamped upon it, and  the envelope. Any more fanciful decoration is in excessively bad  taste.    The proper form for a dinner invitation is:    \"Mr. and Mrs. G--- request the favor of Mr. and Mrs. L---'s  company at dinner, on Tuesday, the 8th of January, at 5 o'clock.\"    Or,    \"Mr. G--- requests the pleasure of Mr. L ---'s company at dinner,  on Tuesday, the 8th of January, at 5 o'clock.\"    The answer accepting the invitation should run as follows:    \"Mr. and Mrs. L--- have much pleasure in accepting Mr. and Mrs. G-  --'s kind invitation to dinner on the 8th of January.\"    If declined, the following form must be used:    \"Mr. and Mrs. L--- regret that a prior engagement (or other reason  stated) will prevent their accepting Mr. and Mrs. G---'s kind  invitation to dinner on the 8th of January.\"    Should the invitation be declined, some reason for the refusal  must be given, and, unless an excuse (which always savors more or  less of the untruthful) be wanted, it is the truest politeness to  assign the cause which actually is the preventive. Whatever the  cause--sickness, domestic trouble, business or any other--it  should be stated as concisely as possible in the answer, which in  any case should be"]]]
