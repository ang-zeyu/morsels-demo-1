If we do so, we not only neglect our duty towards such children, but  permit the growth and extension of the evil. We must recollect that  they will not merely play their own wicked parts during their lives,  but will also become models to the next generation.    It should be remembered here, that I am treating of an evil which  extends itself to all classes of society; I am appealing to the  prudence of men, that they may, for their own sakes, investigate its  cause; I shall hereafter appeal to them as philanthropists, and, still  more urgently, as Christians, that they may examine the merits of the  remedy I shall propose.    The culpability of many parents is beyond dispute. They not only omit  to set their children good examples, and give them good advice, but,  on the contrary, instil into their minds the first rudiments of  wickedness, and lead them into the paths of vice. Their homes present  scenes which human nature shudders at, and which it is impossible  truly to describe. There are parents who, working at home, have every  opportunity of training up their children \"in the way they should go,\"  if they were inclined so to do. Instead of this, we often find, in  the case of the fathers, that they are so lost to every principle of  humanity, that as soon as they receive their wages, they leave their  homes, and hasten with eager steps to the public house; nor do they  re-pass its accursed threshold, till the vice-fattening landlord has  received the greater part of the money which should support their  half-fed, half-clothed wives and children; and till they have  qualified themselves, by intoxication, to act worse than brutes on  their return home. To men of this description it matters not whether  or not their children are proving themselves skilful imitators of  their evil example,--they may curse and swear, lie and steal,--so long  as they can enjoy the society of their pot companions, it is to them a  matter of total indifference.    During my superintendence of the first school, I had a painful  facility of examining these matters. Frequently, when I have inquired  the cause of the wretched plight in which some of the children were  sent to the school,--perhaps with scarcely a shoe to their feet,  sometimes altogether without,--I have heard from their mothers the  most heart-rending recitals of the husband's misconduct. One family in  particular I remember, consisting of seven children, two of whom were  in the school; four of them were supported entirely by the exertions  of the mother, who declared to me, that she did not receive a shilling  from their father for a month together; all the money he got he kept  to spend at the public-house; and his family, for what he cared, might  go naked, or starve. He was not only a great drunkard, but a reprobate  into the bargain; beating and abusing the poor woman, who thus  endeavoured to support his children by her labour.    The evil does not always stop here. Driven to the extreme of  wretchedness by her husband's conduct, the woman sometimes takes to  drinking likewise, and the poor babes are ten thousand times more  pitiable than orphans. I have witnessed the revolting sight of a  child leading home both father and mother from the public-house, in  a disgusting state of intoxication. With tears and entreaties I  have seen the poor infant vainly endeavouring to restrain them from  increasing their drunkenness, by going into the houses on their way  home; they have shaken off the clinging child, who, in the greatest  anxiety, waited without to resume its painful task; knowing, all the  time, perhaps, that whilst its parents were thus throwing away their  money, there was not so much as a crust of bread to appease its hunger  at home. Let it not be thought that this is an overcharged picture of  facts; it is but a faint, a very faint and imperfect sketch of reality  which defies exaggeration. Cases of such depravity, on the part of  mothers, I with much pleasure confess to be comparatively rare.  Maternal affection is the preventive. But what, let me ask, can be  hoped of the children of such parents? What are their characters  likely to become under such tuition? With such examples before their  eyes, need they leave their homes to seek contamination, or to learn  to do evil.    And here I must say, if I were asked to point out, in the metropolis,  or any large city, the greatest nuisance, the worst bane of society,  the most successful promoter of vice,--I should, without a moment's  hesitation, point to the first public-house or spirit dealer's  that met my view. Nor can I, in speaking of the causes of juvenile  delinquency, omit to say, I think these houses, indirectly, a very  great cause of it. Why I think so, my readers will readily conceive  from what I have already said. I am sure that Satan has no temple  in which he is so devoutly worshiped, or so highly honoured, as the  ale-house,--no priest is so devoted as its landlord,--no followers are  so zealous in his behalf as its frequenters.    Let any one in the evening visit the homes of the labouring class in  a poor neighbourhood, and he will find, in many cases, a  barely-furnished room, a numerous family of small children,--perhaps  forgetting the pangs of hunger in the obliviousness of sleep,--a wife,  with care-worn features, sitting in solitary wretchedness, ruminating  on wants she knows not how to supply--namely, clothes and food for  her children on the morrow, and on debts which she has no means of  discharging. But where is he who should be sharing her cares, bidding  her be of good cheer, and devising with her some means of alleviating  their mutual distress? Where is the father of the sleeping babes, the  husband of the watchful wife? Go to the public-house; you will see  him there with a host of his companions, of like character  and circumstances, smoking, drinking, singing, blaspheming,  gambling--ruining his health, spending his money; as jovial as though  he had no wretched wife, no starving babes at home! and as lavish of  money which should procure them food, as the man who is thriving on  his excesses could wish him to be.    I never look on a public-house without considering it as the abode of  the evil genius of the neighbourhood; the despoiler of industry, the  destroyer of domestic comfort; and heartily do I wish, that some means  could be devised for abolishing these resorts of wickedness; that some  legislative enactment may render it unlawful for any one to keep such  places. With respect to a peculiar sort of beverage, it has been  declared to be illegal to afford its purchasers accommodation for  drinking it on the premises. Why not extend it to other liquors? I  know this would be pronounced an infringement on English liberty! The  worst of men would raise this outcry against the measure. But surely  it should rather be called a preventive of English licentiousness. All  good men would consider it as such. I would not rob the labourer of  his daily allowance of a beverage which is believed by many to be of  essential service, when taken in moderation; but I would have him  drink it at home, that his wife and children may participate in his  enjoyment. Perhaps, it will be said, a man closely confined to labour  all day, needs some relaxation from domestic cares--that this can only  be found in change of scene, and in social company. I will concede  this. The plea of health, though often speciously advanced, cannot be  denied. But is it necessary for his health, that this change of scene  should be found in a close tap-room, within a few yards of his home,  where he drinks to a ruinous excess till a late hour,--breathing all  the while a hot atmosphere of tobacco-smoke? Is it not possible to  obtain the change of scene, and the relaxation of social converse, by  mutual visits amongst friends similarly situated,--by a ramble to the  suburbs,--or, in cases where the daily occupation affords too little  opportunity for exercise, are there not places established for  gymnastic exercises,--and might not others be formed for the like  purposes? Certain I am that the abolition of public-houses, in large  cities, as places of daily resort for the adult labouring poor, would  be attended with the most salutary consequences. I know of nothing  that must so certainly tend to their improvement both in character and  circumstances.    No man can witness the scenes, and doings, of many persons who attend  the new beer-houses, without pain and regret, that ever an act of  parliament was passed to legalize such places. I have visited some  hundreds of such, throughout the country, and can positively assert  that the demoralising tendency of too many is awful! Our magistrates  must be more careful in granting licences, or the efforts of the wise  and good will be neutralized, by the evils concocted at such places.  The old inkeepers had a character, and capital at stake. The new  beerhouse-keepers, I should say, a majority of them at least, have  neither, and consequently are less cautious, having less to lose.  Whatever the end of the legislature might have been in enabling the  poor to procure a good and cheap article more easily, to be drunk on  or off the premises, the thing has not answered the end, and no one  can deny, who will take the trouble to visit such places in different  counties, that the _Act_ has been a miserable failure, and has been  the fruitful source of crime and immorality. What a lesson is this for  speculative, short sighted legislators?    Another measure should then be adopted, I would say--destroy the  facility of spirit-drinking, by laying on a heavy duty. It is in vain  that interested sophistry would plead its benefits in particular  cases--such, for instance, as the ludicrous plea of the needfulness  of drams for market-women on wet and frosty"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10986"],[0,"Frederick Douglass (#11)"],[1,"men of the country, who called upon President  Johnson to urge the importance of enfranchisement. Mr. Johnson, true  to his Southern instincts, was coldly hostile to the proposition,  recounted all the arguments against it, and refused the committee  an opportunity to reply. The matter was not left with Mr. Johnson,  however; and the committee turned its attention to the leading  Republican statesmen, in whom they found more impressionable material.  Under the leadership of Senators Sumner, Wilson, Wade, and others, the  matter was fully argued in Congress, the Democratic party being in  opposition, as always in national politics, to any measure enlarging  the rights or liberties of the colored race.    In September, 1866, Douglass was elected a delegate from Rochester to  the National Loyalists' Convention at Philadelphia, called to consider  the momentous questions of government growing out of the war. While he  had often attended anti-slavery conventions as the representative of a  small class of abolitionists, his election to represent a large city  in a national convention was so novel a departure from established  usage as to provoke surprise and comment all over the country. On  the way to Philadelphia he was waited upon by a committee of other  delegates, who came to his seat on the train and urged upon him the  impropriety of his taking a seat as a delegate. Douglass listened  patiently, but declined to be moved by their arguments. He replied  that he had been duly elected a delegate from Rochester, and he would  represent that city in the convention. A procession of the members  and friends of the convention was to take place on its opening day.  Douglass was solemnly warned that, if he walked in the procession, he  would probably be mobbed. But he had been mobbed before, more than  once, and had lived through it; and he promptly presented himself at  the place of assembly. His reception by his fellow-delegates was not  cordial, and he seemed condemned to march alone in the procession,  when Theodore Tilton, at that time editor of the _Independent_, paired  off with him, and marched by his side through the streets of the  Quaker City. The result was gratifying alike to Douglass and the  friends of liberty and progress. He was cheered enthusiastically all  along the line of march, and became as popular in the convention as he  had hitherto been neglected.    A romantic incident of this march was a pleasant meeting, on the  street, with a daughter of Mrs. Lucretia Auld, the mistress who had  treated him kindly during his childhood on the Lloyd plantation. The  Aulds had always taken an interest in Douglass's career,--he had,  indeed, given the family a wide though not altogether enviable  reputation in his books and lectures,--and this good lady had followed  the procession for miles, that she might have the opportunity to speak  to her grandfather's former slave and see him walk in the procession.    In the convention \"the ever-ready and imperial Douglass,\" as Colonel  Higginson describes him, spoke in behalf of his race. The convention,  however, divided upon the question of negro suffrage, and adjourned  without decisive action. But under President Grant's administration  the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, and by the solemn sanction of the  Constitution the ballot was conferred upon the black men upon the same  terms as those upon which it was enjoyed by the whites.          XI.      It is perhaps fitting, before we take leave of Douglass, to give some  estimate of the remarkable oratory which gave him his hold upon  the past generation. For, while his labors as editor and in other  directions were of great value to the cause of freedom, it is upon his  genius as an orator that his fame must ultimately rest.    While Douglass's color put him in a class by himself among great  orators, and although his slave past threw around him an element of  romance that added charm to his eloquence, these were mere incidental  elements of distinction. The North was full of fugitive slaves, and  more than one had passionately proclaimed his wrongs. There were  several colored orators who stood high in the councils of the  abolitionists and did good service for the cause of humanity.    Douglass possessed, in large measure, the physical equipment most  impressive in an orator. He was a man of magnificent figure, tall,  strong, his head crowned with a mass of hair which made a striking  element of his appearance. He had deep-set and flashing eyes, a firm,  well-moulded chin, a countenance somewhat severe in repose, but  capable of a wide range of expression. His voice was rich and  melodious, and of great carrying power. One writer, who knew him in  the early days of his connection with the abolitionists, says of him,  in Johnson's _Sketches of Lynn_:    \"He was not then the polished orator he has since become, but even at  that early date he gave promise of the grand part he was to play in  the conflict which was to end in the destruction of the system that  had so long cursed his race.... He was more than six feet in height;  and his majestic form, as he rose to speak, straight as an arrow,  muscular yet lithe and graceful, his flashing eye, and more than all  his voice, that rivalled Webster's in its richness and in the depth  and sonorousness of its cadences, made up such an ideal of an orator  as the listeners never forgot. And they never forgot his burning  words, his pathos, nor the rich play of his humor.\"    The poet William Howitt said of him on his departure from England in  1847, \"He has appeared in this country before the most accomplished  audiences, who were surprised, not only at his talent, but at his  extraordinary information.\"    In Ireland he was introduced as \"the black O'Connell,\"--a high  compliment; for O'Connell was at that time the idol of the Irish  people. In Scotland they called him the \"black Douglass [Douglas],\"  after his prototype in _The Lady of the Lake_, because of his fire  and vigor. In Rochester he was called the \"swarthy Ajax,\" from his  indignant denunciation and defiance of the Fugitive Slave Law of  1850, which came like a flash of lightning to blast the hopes of the  anti-slavery people.    Douglass possessed in unusual degree the faculty of swaying his  audience, sometimes against their maturer judgment. There is something  in the argument from first principles which, if presented with force  and eloquence, never fails to appeal to those who are not blinded by  self-interest or deep-seated prejudice. Douglass's argument was that  of the Declaration of Independence,--\"that _all_ men are created  equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable  rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. That, to secure these rights, governments are instituted  among men, deriving their just powers from the _consent of the  governed_.\" The writer may be pardoned for this quotation; for there  are times when we seem to forget that now and here, no less than in  ancient Rome, \"eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.\" Douglass  brushed aside all sophistries about Constitutional guarantees, and  vested rights, and inferior races, and, having postulated the right of  men to be free, maintained that negroes were men, and offered himself  as a proof of his assertion,--an argument that few had the temerity  to deny. If it were answered that he was only half a negro, he would  reply that slavery made no such distinction, and as a still more  irrefutable argument would point to his friend, Samuel R. Ward, who  often accompanied him on the platform,--an eloquent and effective  orator, of whom Wendell Phillips said that \"he was so black that, if  he would shut his eyes, one could not see him.\" It was difficult for  an auditor to avoid assent to such arguments, presented with all the  force and fire of genius, relieved by a ready wit, a contagious humor,  and a tear-compelling power rarely excelled.    \"As a speaker,\" says one of his contemporaries, \"he has few equals. It  is not declamation, but oratory, power of description. He watches the  tide of discussion, and dashes into it at once with all the tact of  the forum or the bar. He has art, argument, sarcasm, pathos,--all that  first-rate men show in their master efforts.\"    His readiness was admirably illustrated in the running debate with  Captain Rynders, a ward politician and gambler of New York, who led a  gang of roughs with the intention of breaking up the meeting of the  American Anti-slavery Society in New York City, May 7, 1850. The  newspapers had announced the proposed meeting in language calculated  to excite riot. Rynders packed the meeting with rowdies, and himself  occupied a seat on the platform. Some remark by Mr. Garrison, the  first speaker, provoked a demonstration of hostility. When this was  finally quelled by a promise to permit one of the Rynders party to  reply, Mr. Garrison finished his speech. He was followed by a prosy  individual, who branded the negro as brother to the monkey. Douglass,  perceiving that the speaker was wearying even his own friends,  intervened at an opportune moment, captured the audience by a timely  display of wit, and then improved the occasion by a long and effective  speech. When Douglass offered himself as a refutation of the last  speaker's argument, Rynders replied that Douglass was half white.  Douglass thereupon greeted Rynders as his half-brother, and made this  expression the catchword of his speech. When Rynders interrupted from  time to time, he was silenced with a laugh. He appears to have been  a somewhat philosophic scoundrel, with an appreciation of humor that  permitted the meeting to proceed to an orderly close. Douglass's  speech was the feature of the evening. \"That gifted man,\" said  Garrison, in whose _Life and Times_ a graphic description of this  famous meeting is given, \"effectually put to shame his"]]]
