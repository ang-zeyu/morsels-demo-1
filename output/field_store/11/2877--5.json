They belong to an old bachelor named Bill Metcalf. I think I  was born in Lee County, Mississippi. They did not leave when the war was  over. They stayed on the Bill Metcalf place till they died. I reckon I  do remember him.    \"I can't tell you 'bout the war nor slavery. I don't know a thing 'bout  it. I heard but I couldn't tell you it been so long ago. They didn't  expect nothing but freedom. They got along in the Reconstruction days  about like they had been getting along. Seemed like they didn't know  much about the war. They heard they was free. I don't remember the Ku  Klux Klan. I heard old folks talk 'bout it.    \"I don't know if my father ever voted but I guess he did. I have voted  but I don't vote now. In part I 'proves of the women votin'. I think the  men outer vote and support his family fur as he can.    \"I come here in 1914 from Mississippi. I got busted farmin'. I knowed a  heap o' people said they was doing so well I come too. I come on the  train.    \"I ain't got no home, no land. I got a hog. No garden. Two times in the  year now is hard--winter and simmer. In some ways times is better. In  some ways they is worser. When a trade used to be made to let you have  provisions, you know you would not starve. Now if you can't get work you  'bout starve and can't get no credit. Crops been good last few years and  prices fair fur it. But money won't buy nothin' now. Everything is so  high. Meat is so high. Working man have to eat meat. If he don't he get  weak.    \"The young folks do work. They can't save much farmin'. If they could do  public work between times it be better. I had a hard time in July and  August. I got six children, they grown and gone. My wife is 72 years  old. She ain't no 'count for work no more. The Government give me an'  her $10 a month between us two.

It was on her old  master's place. Bright Herring was his name. Old mistress' name was Miss  Lizzie. My father belonged to a different owner.    \"Mac McClendon and John Mourning was two nigger traders and they brought  my mother and sister Nancy and sister Liza and my sister Anna and Hardy  Miller--that's me--out here on the train from Americus, Georgia to  Memphis and put us on a steamboat and brought us here to Pine Bluff and  sold me to Dr. Pope. He was a poor white man and he wanted a pair of  niggers. He bought me and Laura Beckwith. In them days a doctor examined  you and if your heart was sound and your lungs was sound and you didn't  have no broken bones--have to pay one hundred dollars for every year you  was old. That was in 1862 and I was ten years old so they sold me for  one thousand dollars and one thousand dollars for Laura cause she was  sound too. Carried us down to Monticello and when I got free my mammy  come after me.    \"Fore I left Georgia, my daddy belonged to a man named Bill Ramsey. You  see niggers used the name of their masters.    \"I can remember when I was a boy Bill Ramsey set my father free and give  him a free pass and anybody hire him have to pay just like they pay a  nigger now. My daddy hired my mammy from her master. My mammy was her  master's daughter by a colored woman.    \"My daddy had a hoss named Salem and had a cart and he would take me and  my mammy and my sister Liza and go to Americus and buy rations for the  next week.    \"I member when the war started in 1861 my mammy hired me out to Mrs.  Brewer and she used to git after me and say, 'You better do that good or  I'll whip you. My husband gone to war now on account of you niggers and  it's a pity you niggers ever been cause he may get killed and I'll never  see him again.'    \"I member seein' General Bragg's men and General Steele and General  Marmaduke. Had a fight down at Mark's Mill. We just lived six miles from  there. Seen the Yankees comin' by along the big public road. The Yankees  whipped and fought em so strong they didn't have time to bury the dead.  We could see the buzzards and carrion crows. I used to hear old mistress  say, 'There goes the buzzards, done et all the meat off.' I used to go  to mill and we could see the bones. Used to got out and look at their  teeth. No ma'm, I wasn't scared, the white boys was with me.    \"Dr. Pope was good to me, better to me than he was to Master Walter and  Master Billy and my young Miss, Aurelia, cause me and Laura was scared  of em and we tried to do everything they wanted.    \"When the war ended in 1865 we was out in the field gettin' pumpkins.  Old master come out and said, 'Hardy, you and Laura is free now. You can  stay or you can go and live with somebody else.' We stayed till 1868 and  then our mammies come after us. I was seventeen.    \"After freedom my mammy sent me to school. Teacher's name was W.H.  Young. Name was William Young but he went under the head of W.H. Young.    \"I went to school four years and then I got too old. I learned a whole  lot. Learned to read and spell and figger. I done pretty good. I learned  how to add and multiply and how to cancel and how to work square root.    \"What I've been doin' all my life is farmin' down at Fairfield on the  Murphy place.    \"Vote? Good lord! I done more votin'. Voted for all the Presidents.  Yankees wouldn't let us vote Democrat, had to vote Republican. They'd be  there agitatin'. Stand right there and tell me the ones to vote for. I  done quit votin'. I voted for Coolidge--we called him College--that's  the last votin' I did. One of my friends, Levi Hunter, he was a colored  magistrate down at Fairfield.    \"Ku Klux? What you talkin' about? Ku Klux come to our house. My sister  Ellen's husband went to war on the Yankee side durin' the war--on the  Republican side and fought the Democrats.    \"After the war the Ku Klux came and got the colored folks what fought  and killed em. I saw em kill a nigger right off his mule. Fell off on  his sack of corn and the old mule kep' on goin'.    \"Ku Klux used to wear big old long robe with bunches of cotton sewed all  over it. I member one time we was havin' church and a Ku Klux was hid up  in the scaffold. The preacher was readin' the Bible and tellin' the  folks there was a man sent from God and say an angel be here directly.  Just then the Ku Klux fell down and the niggers all thought 'twas the  angel and they got up and flew.    \"Ku Klux used to come to the church well and ask for a drink and say, 'I  ain't had a bit of water since I fought the battle of Shiloh.'    \"Might as well tell the truth--had just as good a time when I was a  slave as when I was free. Had all the hog meat and milk and everything  else to eat.    \"I member one time when old master wasn't at home the Yankees come and  say to old mistress, 'Madam, we is foragin'.' Old mistress say, 'My  husband ain't home; I can't let you.' Yankees say, 'Well, we're goin' to  anyway.' They say, 'Where you keep your milk and butter?' Old mistress  standin' up there, her face as red as blood and say, 'I haven't any milk  or butter to spare.' But the Yankees would hunt till they found it.    \"After a battle when the dead soldiers was layin' around and didn't have  on no uniform cause some of the other soldiers took em, I've heard the  old folk what knowed say you could tell the Yankees from the Rebels  cause the Yankees had blue veins on their bellies and the Rebels didn't.    \"Now you want me to tell you bout this young nigger generation? I never  thought I'd live to see this young generation come out and do as well as  they is doin'. I'm goin' tell you the truth. When I was young, boys and  girls used to wear long white shirt come down to their ankles, cause it  would shrink, with a hole cut out for their head. I think they is doin'  a whole lot better. Got better clothes. Almost look as well as the white  folks. I just say the niggers dressin' better than the white folks used  to.    \"Then I see some niggers got automobiles.

If they follow  us and overtake the camp, they shall be killed. If the father and mother of  any one of them take them into their lodge, I will kill that father and  mother. Hurry now, hurry and pack up, so that we can go. Everybody tear  down the lodges, as quickly as you can.\"    When the people heard this, they felt very sorry, but they had to do as the  chief said; so they tore down the lodges, and quickly packed the dog  travois, and started off. They packed in such a hurry that they left many  little things lying in camp,--knives and awls, bone needles and moccasins.    The little children played about in the sand for a long time, but at last  they began to get hungry; and one little girl said to the others, \"I will  go back to the camp, and get some dried meat and bring it here, so that we  may eat.\" And she started to go to the camp. When she came to the top of  the hill and looked across the river, she saw that there were no lodges  there, and did not know what to think of it. She called down to the  children, and said, \"The camp has gone\"; but they did not believe her, and  went on playing. She kept on calling, and at last some of them came to her,  and then all, and saw that it was as she had said. They went down to the  river, and crossed it, and went to where the lodges had stood. When they  got there, they saw on the ground the things that had been left out in  packing; and as each child saw and knew something that had belonged to its  own parents, it cried and sang a little song, saying: \"Mother, here is your  bone needle; why did you leave your children?\" \"Father, here is your arrow;  why did you leave your children?\" It was very mournful, and they all cried.    There was among them a little girl who had on her back her baby brother,  whom she loved dearly. He was very young, a nursing child, and already he  was hungry and beginning to fret. This little girl said to the others: \"We  do not know why they have gone, but we know they have gone. We must follow  the trail of the camp, and try to catch up with them.\" So the children  started to follow the camp. They travelled on all day; and just at night  they saw, near the trail, a little lodge. They had heard the people talk of  a bad old woman who killed and ate persons, and some of the children  thought that this old woman might live here; and they were afraid to go to  the lodge. Others said: \"Perhaps some person lives here who has a good  heart. We are very tired and very hungry and have nothing to eat and no  place to keep warm. Let us go to this lodge.\"    They went to it; and when they went in, they saw sitting by the fire an old  woman. She spoke kindly to them, and asked them where they were travelling;  and they told her that the camp had moved on and left them, and that they  were trying to find their people, that they had nothing to eat, and were  tired and hungry. The old woman fed them, and told them to sleep here  to-night, and to-morrow they could go on and find their people. \"The camp,\"  she said, \"passed here to-day when the sun was low. They have not gone  far. To-morrow you will overtake them.\" She spread some robes on the ground  and said: \"Now lie here and sleep. Lie side by side with your heads toward  the fire, and when morning comes, you can go on your journey.\" The  children lay down and soon slept.    In the middle of the night, the old woman got up, and built a big fire, and  put on it a big stone kettle, full of water. Then she took a big knife,  and, commencing at one end of the row, began to cut off the heads of the  children, and to throw them into the pot. The little girl with the baby  brother lay at the other end of the row, and while the old woman was doing  this, she awoke and saw what was taking place. When the old woman came near  to her, she jumped up and began to beg that she would not kill her. \"I am  strong,\" she said. \"I will work hard for you. I can bring your wood and  water, and tan your skins. Do not kill my little brother and me. Take pity  on us and save us alive. Everybody has left us, but do you have pity. You  shall see how quickly I will work, how you will always have plenty of  wood. I can work quickly and well.\" The old woman thought for a little  while, then she said: \"Well, I will let you live for a time, anyhow. You  shall sleep safely to-night.\"    The next day, early, the little girl took her brother on her back, and went  out and gathered a big pile of wood, and brought it to the lodge before the  old woman was awake. When she got up, she called to the girl, \"Go to the  river and get a bucket of water.\" The girl put her brother on her back, and  took the bucket to go. The old woman said to her: \"Why do you carry that  child everywhere? Leave him here.\" The girl said: \"Not so. He is always  with me, and if I leave him he will cry and make a great noise, and you  will not like that.\" The old woman grumbled, but the girl went on down to  the river.    When she got there, just as she was going to fill her bucket, she saw  standing by her a great bull. It was a mountain buffalo, one of those who  live in the timber; and the long hair of its head was all full of pine  needles and sticks and branches, and matted together. (It was a  _Su'ye-st[)u]'mik_, a water bull.) When the girl saw him, she prayed him to  take her across the river, and so to save her and her little brother from  the bad old woman. The bull said, \"I will take you across, but first you  must take some of the sticks out of my head.\" The girl begged him to start  at once; but the bull said, \"No, first take the sticks out of my head.\" The  girl began to do it, but before she had done much, she heard the old woman  calling to her to bring the water. The girl called back, \"I am trying to  get the water clear,\" and went on fixing the buffalo's head. The old woman  called again, saying, \"Hurry, hurry with that water.\" The girl answered,  \"Wait, I am washing my little brother.\" Pretty soon the old woman called  out, \"If you don't bring that water, I will kill you and your brother.\" By  this time the girl had most of the sticks out of the bull's head, and he  told her to get on his back, and went into the water and swam with her  across the river. As he reached the other bank, the girl could see the old  woman coming from her lodge down to the river with a big stick in her hand.    When the bull reached the bank, the girl jumped off his back and started  off on the trail of the camp. The bull swam back again to the other side of  the river, and there stood the old woman. This bull was a sort of servant  of the old woman. She said to him: \"Why did you take those children across  the river? Take me on your back now and carry me across quickly, so that I  can catch them.\" The bull said, \"First take these sticks out of my head.\"  \"No,\" said the old woman; \"first take me across, then I will take the  sticks out.\" The bull repeated, \"First take the sticks out of my head, then  I will take you across.\" This made the old woman very mad, and she hit him  with the stick she had in her hand; but when she saw that he would not go,  she began to pull the sticks out of his head very roughly, tearing out  great handfuls of hair, and every moment ordering him to go, and  threatening what she would do to him when she got back. At last the bull  took her on his back, and began to swim across with her, but he did not  swim fast enough to please her, so she began to pound him with her club to  make him go faster; and when the bull got to the middle of the river, he  rolled over on his side, and the old woman slipped off, and was carried  down the river and drowned.    The girl followed the trail of the camp for several days, feeding on  berries and roots that she dug; and at last one night after dark she  overtook the camp. She went into the lodge of an old woman, who was camped  off at one side, and the old woman pitied her and gave her some food, and  told her where her father's lodge was. The girl went to it, but when she  went in, her parents would not receive her. She had tried to overtake them  for the sake of her little brother, who was growing thin and weak because  he had not nursed; and now her mother was afraid to have her stay with  them. She even went and told the chief that her children had come back. Now  when the chief heard that these two children had come back, he was angry;  and he ordered that the next day they should be tied to a post in the camp,  and that the people should move on and leave them here. \"Then,\" he said,  \"they cannot follow us.\"    The old woman who had pitied the children, when she heard what the chief  had ordered, made up a bundle of dried meat, and hid it in the grass near  the camp. Then she called her dog to her,--a little curly dog. She said to  the dog:--    \"Now listen. To-morrow when we are ready to start, I will call you to come  to me, but you must pay no attention to what I say. Run off, and pretend to  be chasing squirrels. I will try to catch you, and if I do so, I will  pretend to whip you; but do not follow me. Stay behind, and when the camp  has passed out of sight, chew off the strings that bind those children; and  when you have done this, show them where I have hidden that food. Then you  can follow the camp and catch up to us.\" The dog stood before the old  woman, and listened to all that she said, turning his head from side to  side, as if paying close attention.    Next morning it was done as the chief had said. The children were tied to  the tree with raw hide strings, and the people tore down all the lodges and  moved off. The old woman called her dog to follow her, but he was digging  at a gopher hole and would not come. Then she went up to him and struck at  him hard with her whip, but he dodged and ran away, and then stood looking  at her. Then the old woman got very mad and cursed him, but he paid no  attention; and finally she left him, and followed the camp."]]]
