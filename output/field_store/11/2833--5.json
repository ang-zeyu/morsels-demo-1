The rain-doctor selects a  particular bulbous root, pounds it, and administers a cold infusion to  a sheep, which in five minutes afterward expires in convulsions. Part of  the same bulb is converted into smoke, and ascends toward the sky;  rain follows in a day or two. The inference is obvious. Were we as much  harassed by droughts, the logic would be irresistible in England in  1857.       * The name arises from its being always voided on one spot,     in the manner practiced by others of the rhinocerontine family;     and, by the action of the sun, it becomes a black, pitchy substance.    As the Bakwains believed that there must be some connection between  the presence of \"God's Word\" in their town and these successive and  distressing droughts, they looked with no good will at the church bell,  but still they invariably treated us with kindness and respect. I am not  aware of ever having had an enemy in the tribe. The only avowed cause of  dislike was expressed by a very influential and sensible man, the uncle  of Sechele. \"We like you as well as if you had been born among us; you  are the only white man we can become familiar with (thoaela); but we  wish you to give up that everlasting preaching and praying; we can not  become familiar with that at all. You see we never get rain, while those  tribes who never pray as we do obtain abundance.\" This was a fact; and  we often saw it raining on the hills ten miles off, while it would not  look at us \"even with one eye\". If the Prince of the power of the air  had no hand in scorching us up, I fear I often gave him the credit of  doing so.    As for the rain-makers, they carried the sympathies of the people along  with them, and not without reason. With the following arguments they  were all acquainted, and in order to understand their force, we must  place ourselves in their position, and believe, as they do, that all  medicines act by a mysterious charm. The term for cure may be translated  \"charm\" ('alaha').    MEDICAL DOCTOR. Hail, friend! How very many medicines you have about you  this morning! Why, you have every medicine in the country here.    RAIN DOCTOR. Very true, my friend; and I ought; for the whole country  needs the rain which I am making.    M. D. So you really believe that you can command the clouds? I think  that can be done by God alone.    R. D. We both believe the very same thing. It is God that makes the  rain, but I pray to him by means of these medicines, and, the rain  coming, of course it is then mine. It was I who made it for the Bakwains  for many years, when they were at Shokuane; through my wisdom, too,  their women became fat and shining. Ask them; they will tell you the  same as I do.    M. D. But we are distinctly told in the parting words of our Savior that  we can pray to God acceptably in his name alone, and not by means of  medicines.    R. D. Truly! but God told us differently. He made black men first, and  did not love us as he did the white men. He made you beautiful, and gave  you clothing, and guns, and gunpowder, and horses, and wagons, and many  other things about which we know nothing. But toward us he had no heart.  He gave us nothing except the assegai, and cattle, and rain-making; and  he did not give us hearts like yours. We never love each other. Other  tribes place medicines about our country to prevent the rain, so that we  may be dispersed by hunger, and go to them, and augment their power. We  must dissolve their charms by our medicines. God has given us one little  thing, which you know nothing of. He has given us the knowledge of  certain medicines by which we can make rain. WE do not despise those  things which you possess, though we are ignorant of them. We don't  understand your book, yet we don't despise it. YOU ought not to despise  our little knowledge, though you are ignorant of it.    M. D. I don't despise what I am ignorant of; I only think you are  mistaken in saying that you have medicines which can influence the rain  at all.    R. D. That's just the way people speak when they talk on a subject of  which they have no knowledge. When we first opened our eyes, we found  our forefathers making rain, and we follow in their footsteps. You, who  send to Kuruman for corn, and irrigate your garden, may do without rain;  WE can not manage in that way. If we had no rain, the cattle would have  no pasture, the cows give no milk, our children become lean and die, our  wives run away to other tribes who do make rain and have corn, and the  whole tribe become dispersed and lost; our fire would go out.    M. D. I quite agree with you as to the value of the rain; but you can  not charm the clouds by medicines. You wait till you see the clouds  come, then you use your medicines, and take the credit which belongs to  God only.    R. D. I use my medicines, and you employ yours; we are both doctors, and  doctors are not deceivers. You give a patient medicine. Sometimes God is  pleased to heal him by means of your medicine; sometimes not--he dies.  When he is cured, you take the credit of what God does. I do the same.  Sometimes God grants us rain, sometimes not. When he does, we take the  credit of the charm. When a patient dies, you don't give up trust in  your medicine, neither do I when rain fails. If you wish me to leave off  my medicines, why continue your own?    M. D. I give medicine to living creatures within my reach, and can see  the effects, though no cure follows; you pretend to charm the clouds,  which are so far above us that your medicines never reach them. The  clouds usually lie in one direction, and your smoke goes in another. God  alone can command the clouds. Only try and wait patiently; God will give  us rain without your medicines.    R. D. Mahala-ma-kapa-a-a!! Well, I always thought white men were wise  till this morning. Who ever thought of making trial of starvation? Is  death pleasant, then?    M. D. Could you make it rain on one spot and not on another?    R. D. I wouldn't think of trying. I like to see the whole country green,  and all the people glad; the women clapping their hands, and giving me  their ornaments for thankfulness, and lullilooing for joy.    M. D. I think you deceive both them and yourself.    R. D. Well, then, there is a pair of us (meaning both are rogues).    The above is only a specimen of their way of reasoning, in which, when  the language is well understood, they are perceived to be remarkably  acute. These arguments are generally known, and I never succeeded in  convincing a single individual of their fallacy, though I tried to do  so in every way I could think of. Their faith in medicines as charms is  unbounded. The general effect of argument is to produce the impression  that you are not anxious for rain at all; and it is very undesirable  to allow the idea to spread that you do not take a generous interest  in their welfare. An angry opponent of rain-making in a tribe would be  looked upon as were some Greek merchants in England during the Russian  war.    The conduct of the people during this long-continued drought was  remarkably good. The women parted with most of their ornaments to  purchase corn from more fortunate tribes. The children scoured the  country in search of the numerous bulbs and roots which can sustain  life, and the men engaged in hunting. Very great numbers of the large  game, buffaloes, zebras, giraffes, tsessebes, kamas or hartebeests,  kokongs or gnus, pallahs, rhinoceroses, etc., congregated at some  fountains near Kolobeng, and the trap called \"hopo\" was constructed,  in the lands adjacent, for their destruction. The hopo consists of two  hedges in the form of the letter V, which are very high and thick near  the angle. Instead of the hedges being joined there, they are made to  form a lane of about fifty yards in length, at the extremity of which  a pit is formed, six or eight feet deep, and about twelve or fifteen in  breadth and length. Trunks of trees are laid across the margins of the  pit, and more especially over that nearest the lane where the animals  are expected to leap in, and over that farthest from the lane where it  is supposed they will attempt to escape after they are in. The trees  form an overlapping border, and render escape almost impossible. The  whole is carefully decked with short green rushes, making the pit like  a concealed pitfall. As the hedges are frequently about a mile long, and  about as much apart at their extremities, a tribe making a circle three  or four miles round the country adjacent to the opening, and gradually  closing up, are almost sure to inclose a large body of game. Driving it  up with shouts to the narrow part of the hopo, men secreted there throw  their javelins into the affrighted herds, and on the animals rush to the  opening presented at the converging hedges, and into the pit, till that  is full of a living mass. Some escape by running over the others, as  a Smithfield market-dog does over the sheep's backs. It is a frightful  scene. The men, wild with excitement, spear the lovely animals with mad  delight; others of the poor creatures, borne down by the weight of their  dead and dying companions, every now and then make the whole mass heave  in their smothering agonies.    The Bakwains often killed between sixty and seventy head of large game  at the different hopos in a single week; and as every one, both rich and  poor, partook of the prey, the meat counteracted the bad effects of an  exclusively vegetable diet. When the poor, who had no salt, were forced  to live entirely on roots, they were often troubled with indigestion.  Such cases we had frequent opportunities of seeing at other times, for,  the district being destitute of salt, the rich alone could afford to  buy it. The native doctors, aware of the cause of the malady, usually  prescribed some of that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10430"],[0,"Trips to the Moon (#11)"],[1,"so many people, and find  sustenance for ourselves.\"  \"How many may there be?\" said I. \"More  than a thousand,\" said he.  \"And what are their arms?\"  \"Nothing,\"  replied he, \"but fish-bones.\"  \"Then,\" said I, \"we had best go to  war with them, for we have arms and they none; if we conquer them we  shall live without fear for the future.\"  This was immediately  agreed upon, and, as soon as we returned to our ship, we began to  prepare.  The cause of the war was to be the non-payment of the  tribute, which was just now becoming due:  they sent to demand it;  he returned a contemptuous answer to the messengers:  the  Psittopodes and Paguradae were both highly enraged, and immediately  fell upon Scintharus (for that was the old man's name), in a most  violent manner.    We, expecting to be attacked, sent out a detachment of five-and-  twenty men, with orders to lie concealed till the enemy was past,  and then to rise upon them, which they did, and cut off their rear.  We, in the meantime, being likewise five-and-twenty in number, with  the old man and his son, waited their coming up, met, and engaged  them with no little danger, till at length they fled, and we pursued  them even into their trenches.  Of the enemy there fell an hundred  and twenty; we lost only one, our pilot, who was run through by the  rib of a mullet.  That day, and the night after it, we remained on  the field of battle, and erected the dried backbone of a dolphin as  a trophy.  Next day some other forces, who had heard of the  engagement, arrived, and made head against us; the Tarichanes; under  the command of Pelamus, in the right wing, the Thynnocephali on the  left, and the Carcinochires in the middle; the Tritonomendetes  remained neutral, not choosing to assist either party:  we came  round upon all the rest by the temple of Neptune, and with a hideous  cry, rushed upon them.  As they were unarmed, we soon put them to  flight, pursued them into the wood, and took possession of their  territory.  They sent ambassadors a little while after to take away  their dead, and propose terms of peace; but we would hear of no  treaty, and attacking them the next day, obtained a complete  victory, and cut them all off, except the Tritonomendetes, who,  informed of what had passed, ran away up to the whale's gills, and  from thence threw themselves into the sea.  The country being now  cleared of all enemies, we rambled through it, and from that time  remained without fear, used what exercise we pleased, went a-  hunting, pruned our vines, gathered our fruit, and lived, in short,  in every respect like men put together in a large prison, which  there was no escaping from, but where they enjoy everything they can  wish for in ease and freedom; such was our way of life for a year  and eight months.    On the fifteenth day of the ninth month, about the second opening of  the whale's mouth (for this he did once every hour, and by that we  calculated our time), we were surprised by a sudden noise, like the  clash of oars; being greatly alarmed, we crept up into the whale's  mouth, where, standing between his teeth, we beheld one of the most  astonishing spectacles that was ever seen; men of an immense size,  each of them not less than half a stadium in length, sailing on  islands like boats.  I know what I am saying is incredible, I shall  proceed, notwithstanding:  these islands were long, but not very  high, and about a hundred stadia in circumference; there were about  eight-and-twenty of these men in each of them, besides the rowers on  the sides, who rowed with large cypresses, with their branches and  leaves on; in the stern stood a pilot raised on an eminence and  guiding a brazen helm; on the forecastle were forty immense  creatures resembling men, except in their hair, which was all a  flame of fire, so that they had no occasion for helmets; these were  armed, and fought most furiously; the wind rushing in upon the wood,  which was in every one of them, swelled it like a sail and drove  them on, according to the pilot's direction; and thus, like so many  long ships, the islands, by the assistance of the oars, also moved  with great velocity.  At first we saw only two or three, but  afterwards there appeared above six hundred of them, which  immediately engaged; many were knocked to pieces by running against  each other, and many sunk; others were wedged in close together and,  not able to get asunder, fought desperately; those who were near the  prows showed the greatest alacrity, boarding each other's ships, and  making terrible havoc; none, however, were taken prisoners.  For  grappling-irons they made use of large sharks chained together, who  laid hold of the wood and kept the island from moving:  they threw  oysters at one another, one of which would have filled a waggon, and  sponges of an acre long.  AEolocentaurus was admiral of one of the  fleets, and Thalassopotes {109} of the other:  they had quarrelled,  it seems, about some booty; Thalassopotes, as it was reported,  having driven away a large tribe of dolphins belonging to  AEolocentaurus:  this we picked up from their own discourse, when we  heard them mention the names of their commanders.  At length the  forces of AEolocentaurus prevailed, and sunk about a hundred and  fifty of the islands of the enemy, and taking three more with the  men in them:  the rest took to their oars and fled.  The conquerors  pursued them a little way, and in the evening returned to the wreck,  seizing the remainder of the enemy's vessels, and getting back some  of their own, for they had themselves lost no less than fourscore  islands in the engagement.  They erected a trophy for this victory,  hanging one of the conquered islands on the head of the whale, which  they fastened their hawsers to, and casting anchor close to him, for  they had anchors immensely large and strong, spent the night there:  in the morning, after they had returned thanks, and sacrificed on  the back of the whale, they buried their dead, sung their Io Paeans,  and sailed off.  Such was the battle of the islands.      BOOK II.      From this time our abode in the whale growing rather tedious and  disagreeable, not able to bear it any longer, I began to think  within myself how we might make our escape.  My first scheme was to  undermine the right-hand wall and get out there; and accordingly we  began to cut away, but after getting through about five stadia, and  finding it was to no purpose, we left off digging, and determined to  set fire to the wood, which we imagined would destroy the whale, and  secure us a safe retreat.  We began, therefore, by burning the parts  near his tail; for seven days and nights he never felt the heat, but  on the eighth we perceived he grew sick, for he opened his mouth  very seldom, and when he did, shut it again immediately; on the  tenth and the eleventh he declined visibly, and began to stink a  little; on the twelfth it occurred to us, which we had never thought  of before, that unless, whilst he was gaping, somebody could prop up  his jaws, to prevent his closing them, we were in danger of being  shut up in the carcase, and perishing there:  we placed some large  beams, therefore, in his mouth, got our ship ready, and took in  water, and everything necessary:  Scintharus was to be our pilot:  the next day the whale died; we drew our vessel through the  interstices of his teeth, and let her down from thence into the sea:  then, getting on the whale's back, sacrificed to Neptune, near the  spot where the trophy was erected.  Here we stayed three days, it  being a dead calm, and on the fourth set sail; we struck upon  several bodies of the giants that had been slain in the sea-fight,  and measured them with the greatest astonishment:  for some days we  had very mild and temperate weather, but the north-wind arising, it  grew so extremely cold, that the whole sea was froze up, not on the  surface only, but three or four hundred feet deep, so that we got  out and walked on the ice.  The frost being so intense that we could  not bear it, we put in practice the following scheme, which  Scintharus put us in the head of:  we dug a cave in the ice, where  we remained for thirty days, lighting a fire, and living upon the  fish which we found in it; but, our provisions failing, we were  obliged to loosen our ship which was stuck fast in, and hoisting a  sail, slid along through the ice with an easy pleasant motion; on  the fifth day from that time, it grew warm, the ice broke, and it  was all water again.    After sailing about three hundred stadia, we fell in upon a little  deserted island:  here we took in water, for ours was almost gone,  killed with our arrows two wild oxen, and departed.  These oxen had  horns, not on their heads, but, as Momus seemed to wish, under their  eyes.  A little beyond this, we got into a sea, not of water, but of  milk; and upon it we saw an island full of vines; this whole island  was one compact well-made cheese, as we afterwards experienced by  many a good meal, which we made upon it, and is in length five-and-  twenty stadia.  The vines have grapes upon them, which yield not  wine, but milk.  In the middle of the island was a temple to the  Nereid {113} Galataea, as appeared by an inscription on it:  as long  as we stayed there, the land afforded us victuals to eat, and the  vines supplied us with milk to drink.  Tyro, {114a} the daughter of  Salmoneus, we were told, was queen of it, Neptune having, after her  death, conferred that dignity upon her.    We stopped five days on this island, and on the sixth set sail with  a small breeze, which gently agitated the waves, and on the eighth,  changed our milky sea for a green and briny one, where we saw a  great number of men running backwards and forwards, resembling  ourselves in every part, except the feet, which were all of cork,  whence, I suppose, they are called Phellopodes. {114b}  We were  surprised to see"]]]
