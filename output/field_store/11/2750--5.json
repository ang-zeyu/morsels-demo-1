[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7947"],[0,"The Diary of a U-boat Commander (#10)"],[1," bell rang. I lifted the receiver and to my amazed joy heard a  voice that I could have recognized in a thousand. It was Zoe!    I was quite incapable of any remark, and my confusion was further  increased when, after a few \"Hello's,\" which I idiotically repeated,  her clear, level tones said: \"Is that you, Karl? How are you?\" How was  I? What a question to ask! I wanted to tell her that I was bubbling  with joy, that a thousand-kilogramme load had been lifted from my  chest, that my blood was coursing through my veins, that I, usually so  cool, was trembling with excitement, that I could have kissed the  mouthpiece of the humble instrument that linked us together. Yet I was  quite incapable of answering her simple question! I can't imagine what  I expected her to say, for upon reflection her remark was a very  ordinary one, and indeed under the circumstances quite natural, but, as  I say, in actual fact I was tongue-tied.    I suppose I must have said something, for I next remember her saying:  \"Well, you might ask how I am;\" and to my horror I realized that she  thought I was being rude!    My abject apologies were cut short by her tantalizing laugh, and I  understood that the adorable one was teasing me. When at length I made  myself believe that I really was talking to this most elusive and  delightful woman I wasted no time in suggesting that, late though it  was, I might be permitted to go round and see her. She would not permit  this, as she said it would create grave scandal, and the Colonel might  hear about it upon his return. I pleaded hard and urged my departure in  twenty-four hours.    She was firm and reproved me for discussing movements over the  telephone. She was right; I was a fool to do so; but Zoe destroys all  my caution. However, she said that I might lunch with her next day, and  that she had some new music to play to me. I ventured to ask where she  had been, but this question was plainly unpleasing to my lady, so I  dropped the subject. I blew her a goodnight kiss over the telephone, to  which I think I caught an answer, and then she rang off.    Ten minutes had not elapsed, when a messenger entered and informed me  that I was wanted at the Commodore's office at once.    A strange feeling of uneasiness and that of impending misfortune  overcame me. I felt like a naughty school-boy about to interview the  headmaster.    I followed the messenger into the Commodore's office, and found myself  alone with the great man. He was seated at a huge roll-top desk, which  was the only article of furniture in a room which was to all intents  and purposes papered with large scale charts of the east and south  coasts of England and of the Channel and North Sea.    The Commodore was sealing an envelope as I came in; he looked up and  saw me, then, without taking any further notice of me, he resumed his  business with the envelope. I felt that I was in the presence of a  personality, and I was, for \"Old Man Max\" is one of the ten men who  count in the Naval Administration. He had a reading lamp on his desk,  and I remember noticing that the light shining through its green shade  imparted a yellow parchment-like effect to the top of his old bald  head. With dainty care he finished sealing the envelope, then, picking  up a telephone transmitter, he snapped \"Admiralty!\" In about a minute  he was connected, and to my astonishment I realized that he was talking  to the duty captain of the operations department in Berlin.    His words chilled my heart, for he said: \"Commodore speaking! U.39  sails at 2 a.m. for operation F.Q.H.--Repeat.\"    His words were apparently repeated to his satisfaction, for while I was  vainly endeavouring to convince myself that I was unconnected with the  sailing of U.39, he banged the receiver into place (Old Man Max does  everything in bangs) and snapped at me.    \"You Lieutenant Von Schenk?\"    I admitted I was, and then heard this disgusting news.    \"Kranz, 1st Lieutenant U.39, reported suddenly ill, Zeebrugge,  poisoning--you relieve him. Ship sails in one hour forty minutes from  now--my car leaves here in forty minutes and takes you to Zeebrugge.  Here are operation orders--inform Von Weissman he acknowledges receipt  direct to me on 'phone. That's all.\"    He handed me the envelope and I suppose I walked outside--at least I  found myself in the corridor turning the confounded envelope round and  round. For one mad moment I felt like rushing in and saying: \"But, sir,  you don't understand I'm lunching with Zoe to-morrow!\"    Then the mental picture which this idea conjured up made me shake with  suppressed laughter and I remembered that war was war and that I had  only thirty-five minutes in which to collect such gear as I had  handy--most of my sea things being in U.C.47--and say goodbye to Zoe.    I ran to my room and made the corridors echo with shouts for my  faithful Adolf. The excellent man was soon on the scene, and whilst he  stuffed underclothing, towels and other necessary gear into a bag he  had purloined from someone's room, I rang up Zoe. I wasted ten minutes  getting through, but at last I heard a deliciously sleepy voice murmur,  \"Who's that?\"    I told her, and added that I was off; to my secret joy, an intensely  disappointed and long-drawn \"Oooh!\" came over the wire. So she does  care a bit, I thought. Mad ideas of pretending to be suddenly ill  crossed my mind--anything to gain twenty-four hours--but the Fatherland  is above all such considerations, and after some pleasant talk and many  wishes of good luck from the darling girl, with a heavy heart I bade  her good-night.    The Old Man's car, which is a sixty horse-power Benz, was waiting at  the Mess entrance, and once clear of the sentries we raced down the  flat, well-metalled road to Zeebrugge in a very short time. The guard  at Bruges barrier had 'phoned us through to the Zeebrugge fortified  zone, and we were admitted without delay. In three-quarters of an hour  from my interview with old Max I was scrambling across a row of U-boats  to reach my new ship, U.39.    I went down the after hatch, reported myself to Von Weissman and  delivered his orders to him, of which he acknowledged receipt direct to  the Commodore according to instructions. Von Weissman is a very  different stamp of man to Alten; of medium height, he has  sandy-coloured hair, steel-grey eyes and a protruding jaw. He is what  he looks, a fine North Prussian, and is, of course, of excellent  family, as the Weissmans have been settled in Grinetz for a long  period.    He struck me as being about thirty years of age, and on his heart he  wore the Cross of the second class. I have heard of him before as being  well in the running towards an _ordre pour le merite_.    An interesting chart is hanging in the wardroom, on which is marked the  last resting-place of every ship he has sunk. He puts a coloured dot,  the tint of which varies with the tonnage, black up to 2,000, blue from  2,000-5,000, brown 5,000-8,000, green 8,000-11,000, and a red spot with  the ship's name for anything over 11,000. He has got about 120,000 tons  at present. He opposes the Arnauld de la Perriere school of thought,  which pins faith on the gun, and Weissman has done nearly all his work  with the good old torpedo.    Altogether, undoubtedly a man to serve with.    The U.39 was in that buzzing and semi-active condition which to a  trained eye is a sure indication that the ship is about to sail.  Punctually at five minutes to 2 a.m. Weissman went to the bridge, and  at 2 a.m. the wires were slipped and we started on a ten days' trip. As  the dim lights on the mole disappeared and the ceaseless fountain of  star-shells, mingling with the flashing of guns, rose inland on our  port beam my mind travelled overland to the flat at Bruges, and I  wondered whether Zoe was lying awake listening to the ceaseless rumble  of the Flanders cannon. We went on at full speed, as it was our  intention to pass the Dover Straits before dawn. Though our  intelligence bureau issues the most alarming reports as to the  frightfulness of the defences here I was agreeably surprised at the  ease with which we passed. Von Weissman, to whom I had hinted that we  might find the passage tricky, rather laughed at my suggestion, and  described to me his method, which, at all events, has the merit of  simplicity.    He always goes through with the tide, so as to take as short a time as  possible, and he always decides on a course and steers it as closely as  possible, keeping to the surface unless he sights anything, and diving  as soon as anything shows up. Even if he dives he goes on as fast as  possible on his course, irrespective of whether he is being bombed or  not.    I must say it worked very well last night. We shaped a course to pass  five miles west of Gris Nez, and when that light, which for some reason  the French had commodiously lit that night, was abeam, we sighted a  black object, probably a trawler or destroyer, about half a dozen miles  away right ahead. Weissman immediately dived and, without deviating a  degree from his course, held on at three-quarters speed on the motors.  Some time later the hydrophone watchkeeper reported the sound of  propellers in his listeners, and that he judged them to be close at  hand, so I imagine we passed very nearly directly underneath whatever  it was.    After an hour's submerging we rose, and found dawn breaking over a  leaden and choppy sea. Nothing being in sight, we continued on the  surface for an hour, charging batteries with the starboard engine (500  amps on each), but at 9 a.m., the clouds lying low and an aerial patrol  being frequent hereabouts, we dived and cruised steadily down channel  at slow speed, keeping periscope depth.    Several times in the course of the forenoon we sighted small destroyers  and convoy craft [1] in the distance, all steering westerly. They were  probably returning from escorting troopships over to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7951"],[0,"Glimpses of Bengal (#10)"],[1,"-geometrically laid out, and kept  clear and regulated.    I am sure I cannot exactly say why this lazy, dreamy, self-absorbed,  sky-filled state of mind seems to me the more desirable. I feel no whit  inferior to the busiest men of the world as I lie here in my jolly-boat.  Rather, had I girded up my loins to be strenuous, I might have seemed ever  so feeble compared to those chips of old oaken blocks.          SHELIDAH,    _3rd July 1893._    All last night the wind howled like a stray dog, and the rain still pours  on without a break. The water from the fields is rushing in numberless,  purling streams to the river. The dripping ryots are crossing the river in  the ferryboat, some with their tokas[1] on, others with yam leaves held  over their heads. Big cargo-boats are gliding along, the boatman sitting  drenched at his helm, the crew straining at the tow-ropes through the  rain. The birds remain gloomily confined to their nests, but the sons of  men fare forth, for in spite of the weather the world's work must go on.    [Footnote 1: Conical hats of straw or of split bamboo.]    Two cowherd lads are grazing their cattle just in front of my boat. The  cows are munching away with great gusto, their noses plunged into the lush  grass, their tails incessantly busy flicking off the flies. The raindrops  and the sticks of the cowherd boys fall on their backs with the same  unreasonable persistency, and they bear both with equally uncritical  resignation, steadily going on with their munch, munch, munch. These cows  have such mild, affectionate, mournful eyes; why, I wonder, should  Providence have thought fit to impose all the burden of man's work on the  submissive shoulders of these great, gentle beasts?    The river is rising daily. What I could see yesterday only from the upper  deck, I can now see from my cabin windows. Every morning I awake to find  my field of vision growing larger. Not long since, only the tree-tops near  those distant villages used to appear, like dark green clouds. To-day the  whole of the wood is visible.    Land and water are gradually approaching each other like two bashful  lovers. The limit of their shyness has nearly been reached--their arms  will soon be round each other's necks. I shall enjoy my trip along this  brimful river at the height of the rains. I am fidgeting to give the order  to cast off.          SHELIDAH,    _4th July_ 1893.      A little gleam of sunlight shows this morning. There was a break in the  rains yesterday, but the clouds are banked up so heavily along the skirts  of the sky that there is not much hope of the break lasting. It looks as  if a heavy carpet of cloud had been rolled up to one side, and at any  moment a fussy breeze may come along and spread it over the whole place  again, covering every trace of blue sky and golden sunshine.    What a store of water must have been laid up in the sky this year. The  river has already risen over the low _chur_-lands,[1] threatening to  overwhelm all the standing crops. The wretched ryots, in despair, are  cutting and bringing away in boats sheaves of half-ripe rice. As they pass  my boat I hear them bewailing their fate. It is easy to understand how  heart-rending it must be for cultivators to have to cut down their rice on  the very eve of its ripening, the only hope left them being that some of  the ears may possibly have hardened into grain.    [Footnote 1: Old sand-banks consolidated by the deposit of a layer of  culturable soil.]    There must be some element of pity in the dispensations of Providence,  else how did we get our share of it? But it is so difficult to see where  it comes in. The lamentations of these hundreds of thousands of  unoffending creatures do not seem to get anywhere. The rain pours on as it  lists, the river still rises, and no amount of petitioning seems to have  the effect of bringing relief from any quarter. One has to seek  consolation by saying that all this is beyond the understanding of man.  And yet, it is so vitally necessary for man to understand that there are  such things as pity and justice in the world.    However, this is only sulking. Reason tells us that creation never can be  perfectly happy. So long as it is incomplete it must put up with  imperfection and sorrow. It can only be perfect when it ceases to be  creation, and is God. Do our prayers dare go so far?    The more we think over it, the oftener we come hack to the  starting-point--Why this creation at all? If we cannot make up our minds  to object to the thing itself, it is futile complaining about its  companion, sorrow.          SHAZADPUR,    _7th July_ 1893.      The flow of village life is not too rapid, neither is it stagnant. Work  and rest go together, hand in hand. The ferry crosses to and fro, the  passers-by with umbrellas up wend their way along the tow-path, women are  washing rice on the split-bamboo trays which they dip in the water, the  ryots are coming to the market with bundles of jute on their heads. Two  men are chopping away at a log of wood with regular, ringing blows. The  village carpenter is repairing an upturned dinghy under a big  _aswatha_ tree. A mongrel dog is prowling aimlessly along the canal  bank. Some cows are lying there chewing the cud, after a huge meal off the  luxuriant grass, lazily moving their ears backwards and forwards, flicking  off flies with their tails, and occasionally giving an impatient toss of  their heads when the crows perched on their backs take too much of a  liberty.    The monotonous blows of woodcutter's axe or carpenter's mallet, the  splashing of oars, the merry voices of the naked little children at play,  the plaintive tune of the ryot's song, the more dominant creaking of the  turning oil-mill, all these sounds of activity do not seem out of harmony  with murmuring leaves and singing birds, and all combine like moving  strains of some grand dream-orchestra, rendering a composition of immense  though restrained pathos.          SHAZADPUR,    _10th July 1893._      All I have to say about the discussion that is going on over \"silent  poets\" is that, though the strength of feeling may be the same in those  who are silent as in those who are vocal, that has nothing to do with  poetry. Poetry is not a matter of feeling, it is the creation of form.    Ideas take shape by some hidden, subtle skill at work within the poet.  This creative power is the origin of poetry. Perceptions, feelings, or  language, are only raw material. One may be gifted with feeling, a second  with language, a third with both; but he who has as well a creative  genius, alone is a poet.          PATISAR,    _13th August 1893._      Coming through these _beels_[1] to Kaligram, an idea took shape in my  mind. Not that the thought was new, but sometimes old ideas strike one  with new force.    [Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--Sometimes a stream passing through the  flat Bengal country encounters a stretch of low land and spreads out into  a sheet of water, called a _beel_, of indefinite extent, ranging from a  large pool in the dry season to a shoreless expanse during the rains.    Villages consisting of a cluster of huts, built on mounds, stand out here  and there like islands, and boats or round, earthen vessels are the only  means of getting about from village to village.    Where the waters cover cultivated tracts the rice grows through, often  from considerable depths, giving to the boats sailing over them the  curious appearance of gliding over a cornfield, so clear is the water.  Elsewhere these _beels_ have a peculiar flora and fauna of water-lilies  and irises and various water-fowl. As a result, they resemble neither a  marsh nor a lake, but have a distinct character of their own.]    The water loses its beauty when it ceases to be defined by banks and  spreads out into a monotonous vagueness. In the case of language, metre  serves for banks and gives form and beauty and character. Just as the  banks give each river a distinct personality, so does rhythm make each  poem an individual creation; prose is like the featureless, impersonal  _beel_. Again, the waters of the river have movement and progress; those  of the _beel_ engulf the country by expanse alone. So, in order to give  language power, the narrow bondage of metre becomes necessary; otherwise  it spreads and spreads, but cannot advance.    The country people call these _beels_ \"dumb waters\"--they have no  language, no self-expression. The river ceaselessly babbles; so the words  of the poem sing, they are not \"dumb words.\" Thus bondage creates beauty  of form, motion, and music; bounds make not only for beauty but power.    Poetry gives itself up to the control of metre, not led by blind habit,  but because it thus finds the joy of motion. There are foolish persons who  think that metre is a species of verbal gymnastics, or legerdemain, of  which the object is to win the admiration of the crowd. That is not so.  Metre is born as all beauty is born the universe through. The current set  up within well-defined bounds gives metrical verse power to move the minds  of men as vague and indefinite prose cannot.    This idea became clear to me as I glided on from river to _beel_ and  _beel_ to river.          PATISAR,    _26th (Straven) August 1893._      For some time it has struck me that man is a rough-hewn and woman a  finished product.    There is an unbroken consistency in the manners, customs, speech, and  adornment of woman. And the reason is, that for ages Nature has assigned  to her the same definite role and has been adapting her to it. No  cataclysm, no political revolution, no alteration of social ideal, has yet  diverted woman from her particular functions, nor destroyed their  inter-relations. She has loved, tended, and caressed, and done nothing  else; and the exquisite skill which she has acquired in these, permeates  all her being and doing. Her disposition and action have become  inseparably one,"]]]
