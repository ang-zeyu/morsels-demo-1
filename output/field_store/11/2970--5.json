She remains      still and seems indifferent. He is small and she is large. At      last he approaches; spreads his wings, which tremble      convulsively; leaps on her back, and fixes himself there. The      preludes are long and the coupling itself sometimes occupies five      or six hours. Then they separate. But the same day or the      following day she seizes him and eats him up in small mouthfuls.      She will permit a whole series of males to have intercourse with      her, always eating them up directly afterward. Fabre has even      seen her eating the male while still on her back, his head and      neck gone, but his body still firmly attached. (J.H. Fabre,      _Souvenirs Entomologiques_, fifth series, p. 307.) Fabre also      describes in great detail (ibid., ninth series, chs. xxi-xxii)      the sexual parades of the Languedoc scorpion (_Scorpio      occitanus_), an arachnid. These parades are in public; for their      subsequent intercourse the couple seek complete seclusion, and      the female finally eats the male.        An insect (a species of _Empis_) has been described which excites      the female by manipulating a large balloon. \"This is of      elliptical shape, about seven millimeters long (nearly twice as      long as the fly), hollow, and composed entirely of a single layer      of minute bubbles, nearly uniform in size, arranged in regular      circles concentric with the axis of the structure. The      beautiful, glistening whiteness of the object when the sun shines      upon it makes it very conspicuous. The bubbles were slightly      viscid, and in nearly every case there was a small fly pressed      into the front end of the balloon, apparently as food for the      _Empis_. In all cases they were dead. The balloon appears to be      made while the insect is flying in the air. Those flying highest      had the smallest balloons. The bubbles are probably produced by      some modification of the anal organs. It is possible that the      captured fly serves as a nucleus to begin the balloon on. One      case of a captured fly but no balloon was observed. After      commencing, it is probable that the rest of the structure is made      by revolving the completed part between the hind legs and adding      more bubbles somewhat spirally. The posterior end of the balloon      is left more or less open. The purpose of this structure is to      attract the female. When numerous males were flying up and down      the road, it happened several times that a female was seen to      approach them from some choke-cherry blossoms near by. The males      immediately gathered in her path, and she with little hesitation      selected for a mate the one with the largest balloon, taking a      position _upon his back_. After copulation had begun, the pair      would settle down toward the ground, select a quiet spot, and the      female would alight by placing her front legs across a horizontal      grass blade, her head resting against the blade so as to brace      the body in position. Here she would continue to hold the male      beneath her for a little time, until the process was finished.      The male, meanwhile, would be rolling the balloon about in a      variety of positions, juggling with it, one might almost say.      After the male and female parted company, the male immediately      dropped the balloon upon the ground, and it was greedily seized      by ants. No illustration could properly show the beauty of the      balloon.\" (Aldrich and Turley, \"A Balloon-making Fly,\" _American      Naturalist_, October, 1899.)        \"In many species of moths the males 'assemble' around the freshly      emerged female, but no special advantage appears to attend on      early arrival. The female sits apparently motionless, while the      little crowd of suitors buzz around her for several minutes.      Suddenly, and, as far as one can see, without any sign from the      female, one of the males pairs with her and all the others      immediately disappear. In these cases the males do not fight or      struggle in any way, and as one watches the ceremony the wonder      arises as to how the moment is determined, and why the pairing      did not take place before. Proximity does not decide the point,      for long beforehand the males often alight close to the female      and brush against her with fluttering wings. I have watched the      process exactly as I have described it in a common Northern      _Noctua_, the antler moth (_Charaeax graminis_), and I have seen      the same thing among beetles.\" (E.B. Poulton, _The Colors of      Animals_, 1890, p. 391.) This author mentions that among some      butterflies the females take the active part. The example here      quoted of courtship among moths illustrates how phenomena which      are with difficulty explicable by the theory of sexual selection      in its original form become at once intelligible when we realize      the importance of tumescence in courtship.        Of the Argentine cow-bird (_Molothrus bonariensis_) Hudson says      (_Argentine Ornithology_, vol. i, p. 73): \"The song of the male,      particularly when making love, is accompanied with gestures and      actions somewhat like those of the domestic pigeon. He swells      himself out, beating the ground with his wings, and uttering a      series of deep internal notes, followed by others loud and clear;      and occasionally, when uttering them, he suddenly takes wing and      flies directly away from the female to a distance of fifty yards,      and performs a wide circuit about her in the air, singing all the      time. The homely object of his passion always appears utterly      indifferent to this curious and pretty performance; yet she must      be even more impressionable than most female birds, since she      continues scattering about her parasitical and often wasted eggs      during four months in every year.\"        Of a tyrant-bird (_Pitangus Bolivianus_) Hudson writes      (_Argentine Ornithology_, vol. i, p. 148): \"Though the male and      female are greatly attached, they do not go afield to hunt in      company, but separate to meet again at intervals during the day.      One of a couple (say, the female) returns to the trees where they      are accustomed to meet, and after a time, becoming impatient or      anxious at the delay of her consort, utters a very long, clear      call-note. He is perhaps a quarter of a mile away, watching for a      frog beside a pool, or beating over a thistle-bed, but he hears      the note and presently responds with one of equal power. Then,      perhaps, for half an hour, at intervals of half a minute, the      birds answer each other, though the powerful call of the one must      interfere with his hunting. At length he returns; then the two      birds, perched close together, with their yellow bosoms almost      touching, crests elevated, and beating the branch with their      wings, scream their loudest notes in concert--a confused jubilant      noise that rings through the whole plantation. Their joy at      meeting is patent, and their action corresponds to the warm      embrace of a loving human couple.\"        Of the red-breasted marsh-bird (_Leistes superciliaris_) Hudson      (_Argentine Ornithology_, vol. i, p. 100) writes: \"These birds      are migratory, and appear everywhere in the eastern part of the      Argentine country early in October, arriving singly, after which      each male takes up a position in a field or open space abounding      with coarse grass and herbage, where he spends most of his time      perched on the summit of a tall stalk or weed, his glowing      crimson bosom showing at a distance like some splendid flower      above the herbage. At intervals of two or three minutes he soars      vertically up to a height of twenty or twenty-five yards to utter      his song, composed of a single long, powerful and rather musical      note, ending with an attempt at a flourish, during which the bird      flutters and turns about in the air; then, as if discouraged at      his failure, he drops down, emitting harsh, guttural chirps, to      resume his stand. Meanwhile the female is invisible, keeping      closely concealed under the long grass. But at length, attracted      perhaps by the bright bosom and aerial music of the male, she      occasionally exhibits herself for a few moments, starting up with      a wild zigzag flight, and, darting this way and that, presently      drops into the grass once more. The moment she appears above the      grass the male gives chase, and they vanish from sight together.\"        \"Courtship with the mallard,\" says J.G. Millais (_Natural History      of British Ducks_, p. 6), \"appears to be carried on by both      sexes, though generally three or four drakes are seen showing      themselves off to attract the attention of a single duck.      Swimming round her, in a coy and semi-self-conscious manner, they      now and again all stop quite still, nod, bow, and throw their      necks out in token of their admiration and their desire of a      favorable response. But the most interesting display is when all      the drakes simultaneously stand up in the water and rapidly pass      their bills down their breasts, uttering at the same time a low      single note somewhat like the first half of the call that teal      and pintail make when 'showing off.' At other times the      love-making of the drake seems to be rather passive than active.      While graciously allowing himself to be courted, he holds his      head high with conscious pride, and accepts as a matter of course      any attention that may be paid to him. A proud bird is he when      three or four ducks come swimming along beside and around him,      uttering a curious guttural note, and at the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13613"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 4 (#11)"],[1,"the devil is with her,\" and \"All the earth is given to me      as a place of prayer, and as pure, except the burial ground and      the bath.\" (See, e.g., E.W. Lane, _Arabian Society in the Middle      Ages_, 1883, pp. 179-183.) Although, therefore, the bath, or      _hammam_, on grounds of ritual ablution, hygiene, and enjoyment      speedily became universally popular in Islam among all classes      and both sexes, Mohammed himself may be said to have opposed it.    Among the discoveries which the Crusaders made and brought home with them  one of the most notable was that of the bath, which in its more elaborate  forms seems to have been absolutely forgotten in Europe, though Roman  baths might everywhere have been found underground. All authorities seem  to be agreed in finding here the origin of the revival of the public bath.  It is to Rome first, and later to Islam, the lineal inheritor of classic  culture, that we owe the cult of water and of physical purity. Even to-day  the Turkish bath, which is the most popular of elaborate methods of  bathing, recalls by its characteristics and its name the fact that it is a  Mohammedan survival of Roman life.    From the twelfth century onward baths have repeatedly been introduced from  the East, and reintroduced afresh in slightly modified forms, and have  flourished with varying degrees of success. In the thirteenth century they  were very common, especially in Paris, and though they were often used,  more especially in Germany, by both sexes in common, every effort was made  to keep them orderly and respectable. These efforts were, however, always  unsuccessful in the end. A bath always tended in the end to become a  brothel, and hence either became unfashionable or was suppressed by the  authorities. It is sufficient to refer to the reputation in England of  \"hot-houses\" and \"bagnios.\" It was not until toward the end of the  eighteenth century that it began to be recognized that the claims of  physical cleanliness were sufficiently imperative to make it necessary  that the fairly avoidable risks to morality in bathing should be avoided  and the unavoidable risks bravely incurred. At the present day, now that  we are accustomed to weave ingeniously together in the texture of our  lives the conflicting traditions of classic and Christian days, we have  almost persuaded ourselves that the pagan virtue of cleanliness comes next  after godliness, and we bathe, forgetful of the great moral struggle which  once went on around the bath. But we refrain from building ourselves  palaces to bathe in, and for the most part we bathe with exceeding  moderation.[23] It is probable that we may best harmonize our conflicting  traditions by rejecting not only the Christian glorification of dirt, but  also, save for definitely therapeutic purposes, the excessive heat,  friction, and stimulation involved by the classic forms of bathing. Our  reasonable ideal should render it easy and natural for every man, woman,  and child to have a simple bath, tepid in winter, cold in summer, all the  year round.        For the history of the bath in mediaeval times and later Europe,      see A. Franklin, _Les Soins de Toilette_, in the _Vie Privee      d'Autrefois_ series; Rudeck, _Geschichte der oeffentlichen      Sittlichkeit in Deutschland_; T. Wright, _The Homes of Other      Days_; E. Duehren, _Das Geschlechtsleben in England_, bd. 1.        Outside the Church, there was a greater amount of cleanliness      than we are sometimes apt to suppose. It may, indeed, be said      that the uncleanliness of holy men and women would have attracted      no attention if it had corresponded to the condition generally      prevailing. Before public baths were established bathing in      private was certainly practiced; thus Ordericus Vitalis, in      narrating the murder of Mabel, the Countess de Montgomery, in      Normandy in 1082, casually mentions that she was lying on the bed      after her bath (_Ecclesiastical History_, Book V, Chapter XIII).      In warm weather, it would appear, mediaeval ladies bathed in      streams, as we may still see countrywomen do in Russia, Bohemia,      and occasionally nearer home. The statement of the historian      Michelet, therefore, that Percival, Iseult, and the other      ethereal personages of mediaeval times \"certainly never washed\"      (_La Sorciere_, p. 110) requires some qualification.        In 1292 there were twenty-six bathing establishments in Paris,      and an attendant would go through the streets in the morning      announcing that they were ready. One could have a vapor bath only      or a hot bath to succeed it, as in the East. No woman of bad      reputation, leper, or vagabond was at this time allowed to      frequent the baths, which were closed on Sundays and feast-days.      By the fourteenth century, however, the baths began to have a      reputation for immorality, as well as luxury, and, according to      Dufour, the baths of Paris \"rivaled those of imperial Rome: love,      prostitution, and debauchery attracted the majority to the      bathing establishments, where everything was covered by a decent      veil.\" He adds that, notwithstanding the scandal thus caused and      the invectives of preachers, all went to the baths, young and      old, rich and poor, and he makes the statement, which seems to      echo the constant assertion of the early Fathers, that \"a woman      who frequented the baths returned home physically pure only at      the expense of her moral purity.\"        In Germany there was even greater freedom of manners in bathing,      though, it would seem, less real licentiousness. Even the      smallest towns had their baths, which were frequented by all      classes. As soon as the horn blew to announce that the baths were      ready all hastened along the street, the poorer folk almost      completely undressing themselves before leaving their homes.      Bathing was nearly always in common without any garment being      worn, women attendants commonly rubbed and massaged both sexes,      and the dressing room was frequently used by men and women in      common; this led to obvious evils. The Germans, as Weinhold      points out (_Die Deutschen Frauen im Mittelalter_, 1882, bd. ii,      pp. 112 et seq.), have been fond of bathing in the open air in      streams from the days of Tacitus and Caesar until comparatively      modern times, when the police have interfered. It was the same in      Switzerland. Poggio, early in the sixteenth century, found it the      custom for men and women to bathe together at Baden, and said      that he seemed to be assisting at the _floralia_ of ancient Rome,      or in Plato's Republic. Senancour, who quotes the passage (_De      l'Amour_, 1834, vol. i, p. 313), remarks that at the beginning of      the nineteenth century there was still great liberty at the Baden      baths.        Of the thirteenth century in England Thomas Wright (_Homes of      Other Days_, 1871, p. 271) remarks: \"The practice of warm bathing      prevailed very generally in all classes of society, and is      frequently alluded to in the mediaeval romances and stories. For      this purpose a large bathing-tub was used. People sometimes      bathed immediately after rising in the morning, and we find the      bath used after dinner and before going to bed. A bath was also      often prepared for a visitor on his arrival from a journey; and,      what seems still more singular, in the numerous stories of      amorous intrigues the two lovers usually began their interviews      by bathing together.\"        In England the association between bathing and immorality was      established with special rapidity and thoroughness. Baths were      here officially recognized as brothels, and this as early as the      twelfth century, under Henry II. These organized bath-brothels      were confined to Southwark, outside the walls of the city, a      quarter which was also given up to various sports and amusements.      At a later period, \"hot-houses,\" bagnios, and hummums (the      eastern _hammam_) were spread all over London and remained      closely identified with prostitution, these names, indeed,      constantly tending to become synonymous with brothels. (T.      Wright, _Homes of Other Days_, 1871, pp. 494-496, gives an      account of them.)        In France the baths, being anathematized by both Catholics and      Huguenots, began to lose vogue and disappear. \"Morality gained,\"      remarks Franklin, \"but cleanliness lost.\" Even the charming and      elegant Margaret of Navarre found it quite natural for a lady to      mention incidentally to her lover that she had not washed her      hands for a week. Then began an extreme tendency to use      cosmetics, essences, perfumes, and a fierce war with vermin, up      to the seventeenth century, when some progress was made, and      persons who desired to be very elegant and refined were      recommended to wash their faces \"nearly every day.\" Even in 1782,      however, while a linen cloth was advised for the purpose of      cleaning the face and hands, the use of water was still somewhat      discountenanced. The use of hot and cold baths was now, however,      beginning to be established in Paris and elsewhere, and the      bathing establishments at the great European health resorts were      also beginning to be put on the orderly footing which is now      customary. When Casanova, in the middle of the eighteenth      century, went to the public baths at Berne he was evidently      somewhat surprised when he found that he was invited to choose      his own attendant from a number of young women, and when he      realized that these attendants were, in all respects, at the      disposition of the bathers. It is evident that establishments of      this kind were then already dying out, although it may be added      that the customs described by Casanova appear to"]]]
