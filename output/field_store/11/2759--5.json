Ho-yo-went'-ho and Da-go-no-we'-da consented to take the  office among the Mohawk sachems, and to leave their names in the  list upon condition that after their demise the two should remain  thereafter vacant. They were installed upon these terms, and the  stipulation has been observed to the present day. At all councils  for the investiture of sachems their names are still called with the  others as a tribute of respect to their memory. The general council,  therefore, consisted of but forty-eight members.    Each sachem had an assistant sachem, who was elected by the gens of  his principal from among its members, and who was installed with the  same forms and ceremonies. He was styled an \"aid.\" It was his duty  to stand behind his superior on all occasions of ceremony, to act as  his messenger, and in general to be subject to his directions. It  gave to the aid the office of chief and rendered probable his  election as the successor of his principal after the decease of the  latter. In their figurative language these aids of the sachems were  styled \"Braces in the Long House,\" which symbolized the confederacy.    The names bestowed upon the original sachems became the names of  their respective successors in perpetuity. For example, upon the  demise of Go-ne-o-di'-yo, one of the eight Seneca sachems, his  successor would be elected by the Turtle gens in which this  sachemship was hereditary, and when raised up by the general council  he would receive this name, in place of his own, as a part of the  ceremony. On several different occasions I have attended their  councils for raising up sachems both at the Onondaga and Seneca  reservations, and witnessed the ceremonies herein referred to.  Although but a shadow of the old confederacy now remains, it is  fully organized with its complement of sachems and aids, with the  exception of the Mohawk tribe, which removed to Canada about 1775.  Whenever vacancies occur their places are filled, and a general  council is convened to install the new sachems and their aids. The  present Iroquois are also perfectly familiar with the structure and  principles of the ancient confederacy.    For all purposes of tribal government the five tribes were  independent of each other. Their territories were separated by fixed  boundary lines, and their tribal interests were distinct. The eight  Seneca sachems, in conjunction with the other Seneca chiefs, formed  the council of the tribe by which its affairs were administered,  leaving to each of the other tribes the same control over their  separate interests. As an organization the tribe was neither  weakened nor impaired by the confederate compact. Each was in  vigorous life within its appropriate sphere, presenting some analogy  to our own States within an embracing Republic. It is worthy of  remembrance that the Iroquois commended to our forefathers a union  of the colonies similar to their own as early as 1755. They saw in  the common interests and common speech of the several colonies the  elements for a confederation, which was as far as their vision was  able to penetrate.    The tribes occupied positions of entire equality in the confederacy  in rights, privileges, and obligations. Such special immunities as  were granted to one or another indicate no intention to establish an  unequal compact or to concede unequal privileges. There were organic  provisions apparently investing particular tribes with superior power;  as, for example, the Onondagas were allowed fourteen sachems and the  Senecas but eight; and a larger body of sachems would naturally  exercise a stronger influence in council than a smaller. But in this  case it gave no additional power, because the sachems of each tribe  had an equal voice in forming a decision, and a negative upon the  others. When in council they agreed by tribes, and unanimity in  opinion was essential to every public act. The Onondagas were made  \"Keepers of the Wampum,\" and \"Keepers of the Council Brand,\" the  Mohawks \"Receivers of Tribute\" from subjugated tribes, and the  Senecas \"Keepers of the Door\" of the Long House. These and some  other similar provisions were made for the common advantage.    The cohesive principle of the confederacy did not spring exclusively  from the benefits of an alliance for mutual protection, but had a  deeper foundation in the bond of kin. The confederacy rested upon  the tribes ostensibly, but primarily upon common gentes. All the  members of the same gens, whether Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas,  Cayugas, or Senecas, were brothers and sisters to each other in  virtue of their descent from the same common ancestor, and they  recognized each other as such with the fullest cordiality. When they  met, the first inquiry was the name of each other's gens, and next  the immediate pedigree of their respective sachems; after which they  were usually able to find, under their peculiar system of  consanguinity the relationship in which they stood to each other.  [Footnote: The children of brothers are themselves brothers and  sisters to each other; the children of the latter were also brothers  and sisters, and so downwards indefinitely. The children and  descendants of sisters are the same. The children of a brother and  sister are cousins; the children of the latter are cousins, and so  downwards indefinitely. A knowledge of the relationships to each  other of the members of the same gens is never lost.]    Three of the gentes--namely, the Wolf, Bear, and Turtle--were common  to the five tribes; these and three others were common to three  tribes. In effect, the Wolf gens, through the division of an  original tribe into five, was now in five divisions, one of which  was in each tribe. It was the same with the Bear and the Turtle  gentes. The Deer, Snipe, and Hawk gentes were common to the Senecas,  Cayugas, and Onondagas. Between the separated parts of each gens,  although its members spoke different dialects of the same language,  there existed a fraternal connection which linked the nations  together with indissoluble bonds. When the Mohawk of the Wolf gens  recognized an Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, or Seneca of the same gens  as a brother, and when the members of the other divided gentes did  the same, the relationship was not ideal, but a fact founded upon  consanguinity, and upon faith in an assured lineage older than their  dialects and coeval with their unity as one people. In the  estimation of an Iroquois every member of his gens, in whatever tribe,  was as certainly a kinsman as an own brother. This cross  relationship between persons of the same gens in the different  tribes is still preserved and recognized among them in all its  original force. It explains the tenacity with which the fragments of  the old confederacy still cling together. If either of the five  tribes had seceded from the confederacy it would have severed the  bond of kin, although this would have been felt but slightly. But  had they fallen into collision it would have turned the gens of the  Wolf against their gentile kindred, Bear against Bear; in a word,  brother against brother. The history of the Iroquois demonstrates  the reality as well as persistency of the bond kin, and the fidelity  with which it was respected. During the long period through which  the confederacy endured they never fell into anarchy nor ruptured  the organization.    The \"Long House\" (Ho-de'-no-sote) was made the symbol of the  confederacy, and they styled themselves the \"People of the Long House\"  (Ho-e'-no-sau-nee). [Footnote: The Long House was not peculiar to  the Iroquois, but used by many other tribes, as the Powhattan  Indians of Virginia, the Nyacks of Long Island, and other tribes.]    This was the name, and the only name, with which they distinguished  themselves. The confederacy produced a gentile society more complex  than that of a single tribe, but it was still distinctively a  gentile society. It was, however, a stage of progress in the  direction of a nation, for nationality is reached under gentile  institutions. Coalescence is the last stage in this process. The  four Athenian tribes coalesced in Attica into a nation by the  intermingling of the tribes in the same area, and by the gradual  disappearance of geographical lines between them. The tribal names  and organizations remained in full vitality as before, but without  the basis of an independent territory. When political society was  instituted on the basis of the deme or township, and all the  residents of the deme became a body politic, irrespective of their  gens or tribe, the coalescence became complete.    The coalescence of the Latin and Sabrae gentes into the Roman people  and nation was a result of the same processes. In all alike the gens,  phratry and tribe were the first three stages of organization. The  confederacy followed as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8115"],[0,"Authors of Greece (#10)"],[1,"reverences no gods of Greece \"who reared him not  nor brought him to old age\". The Chorus declare that \"what is fated will  come to pass, for Zeus' mighty boundless will cannot be thwarted\". Here  we have the three leading ideas in the system of Aeschylus--the doctrine  of the inherited curse, of human pride and impiety, and the might of  Destiny.    The _Persians_ is unique as being the only surviving historical play in  Greek literature. It is a poem rather than a drama, as there is little  truly dramatic action. The piece is a succession of very vivid sketches  of the incidents in the great struggle which freed Europe from the  threat of Eastern despotism. A Chorus of Persian elders is waiting for  news of the advance of the great array which Xerxes led against Greece  in 480. They tell how Persia extended her sway over Asia. Yet they are  uneasy, for        \"what mortal can avoid the crafty deception of Heaven? In seeming      kindness it entices men into a trap whence they cannot escape.\"    The Queen-mother Atossa enters, resplendent with jewels; she too is  anxious, for in a dream she had seen Xerxes yoke two women together who  were at feud, one clad in Persian garb, the other in Greek. The former  was obedient to the yoke, but the latter tore the car to pieces and  broke the curb. The Chorus advises her to propitiate the gods with  sacrifice, and to pray to Darius her dead husband to send his son  prosperity. At that moment a herald enters with the news of the Greek  victory at Salamis. Xerxes, beguiled by some fiend or evil spirit, drew  up his fleet at night to intercept the Greeks, supposed to be preparing  for flight. But at early dawn they sailed out to attack, singing  mightily        \"Ye sons of Greece, onward! Free your country, your children and      wives, the shrines of your fathers' gods, and your ancestral tombs.      Now must ye fight for all.\"    Winning a glorious victory, they landed on the little island  (Psyttaleia) where the choicest Persian troops had been placed to cut  off the retreat of the Greek navy, and slew them all. Later, they drove  back the Persians by land; through Boeotia, Thessaly and Macedonia the  broken host retreated, finally recrossing to Asia over the Hellespont.    On hearing the news Atossa disappears and the Persian Chorus sing a  dirge. The Queen returns without her finery, attired as a suppliant; she  bids the Chorus call up Darius, while she offers libations to the  dead. The ghost of the great Empire-builder rises before the astonished  spectators, enquiring what trouble has overtaken his land. His release  from Death is not easy, \"for the gods of the lower world are readier to  take men's spirits than to let them go\". On learning that his son has  been totally defeated, he delivers his judgment. The oracles had long  ago prophesied this disaster; it was hurried on by Xerxes' rashness,  for when a man is himself hurrying on to ruin Heaven abets him. He had  listened to evil counsellors, who bade him rival his father's glory by  making wider conquests. The ruin of Persia is not yet complete, for when  insolence is fully ripe it bears a crop of ruin and reaps a harvest of  tears. This evil came upon Xerxes through the sacrilegious demolition of  altars and temples. Zeus punishes overweening pride, and his correcting  hand is heavy. Darius counsels Atossa to comfort their son and to  prevent him from attacking Greece again; he further advises the Chorus  to take life's pleasures while they can, for after death there is  no profit in wealth. A distinctly grotesque touch is added by the  appearance of Xerxes himself, broken and defeated, filling the scene  with lamentations for lost friends and departed glory, unable to answer  the Chorus when they demand the whereabouts of some of the most famous  Persian warriors.    The play is valuable as the result of a personal experience of the poet.  As a piece of literature it is important, for it is a poetic description  of the first armed conflict between East and West. It directly inspired  Shelley when he wrote his _Hellas_ at a time when Greece was rousing  herself from many centuries of Eastern oppression. As a historical  drama it is of great value, for it is substantially accurate in its main  facts, though Aeschylus has been compelled to take some liberties  with time and human motives in order to satisfy dramatic needs. From  Herodotus it seems probable that Darius himself hankered after the  subjugation of Greece, while Xerxes at the outset was inclined to leave  her in peace.    One or two characteristic features are worth note. The genius of  Aeschylus was very bold; it was a daring thing to bring up a ghost from  the dead, for the supernatural appeal does not succeed except when it  is treated with proper insight; yet even Aeschylus' genius has not quite  succeeded in filling his canvas, the last scenes being distinctly poor  in comparison with the splendour of the main theme. On the other hand  a notable advance in dramatic power has been made. The main actors are  becoming human; their wills are beginning to operate. Tragedy is based  on a conflict of some sort; here the wilful spirit of youth is portrayed  as defying the forces of justice and righteousness; it is insolence  which brings Xerxes to ruin. The substantial creed of Aeschylus is  contained in Darius' speech; as the poet progresses in dramatic cunning  we shall find that he constantly finds his sources of tragic inspiration  in the acts of the sinners who defy the will of the gods.    _The Seven against Thebes_ was performed in 472. It was one of a  trilogy, a series of three plays dealing with the misfortunes of  Oedipus' race. After the death of Oedipus his sons Polyneices and  Eteocles quarrelled for the sovereignty of Thebes. Polyneices, expelled  and banished by his younger brother, assembled an army of chosen  warriors to attack his native land. Eteocles opens the play with a  speech which encourages the citizens to defend their town. A messenger  hurries in telling how he left the besiegers casting lots to decide  which of the seven gates of Thebes each should attack. Eteocles prays  that the curse of his father may not destroy the town and leaves to  arrange the defences. In his absence the Chorus of virgins sing a wild  prayer to the gods to save them. Hearing this, the King returns  to administer a vigorous reproof; he declares that their frenzied  supplications fill the city with terrors, discouraging the fighting men.  He demands from them obedience, the mother of salvation; if at last they  are to perish, they cannot escape the inevitable. His masterful spirit  at last cows them into a better frame of mind; this scene presents to us  one of the most manly characters in Aeschylus' work.    After a choral ode a piece of intense tragic horror follows. The  messenger tells the names of the champions who are to assault the gates.  As he names them and the boastful or impious mottoes on their shields,  the King names the Theban champions who are to quell their pride in the  fear of the gods. Five of the insolent attackers are mentioned, then the  only righteous one of the invading force, Amphiaraus the seer; he it was  who rebuked the violence of Tydeus, the evil genius among the besiegers,  and openly reviled Polyneices for attacking his own native land. He had  prophesied his own death before the city, yet resolved to meet his fate  nobly; on his shield alone was no device, for he wished to be, not to  seem, a good man. The pathos of the impending ruin of a great character  through evil associations is heightened by the terror of what follows.  Only one gate remains without an assailant, the gate Eteocles is to  defend; it is to be attacked by the King's own brother, Polyneices.  Filled with horror, the Chorus begs him send another to that gate,  for \"there can be no old age to the pollution of kindred bloodshed\".  Recognising that his father's curse is working itself out, he departs to  kill and be killed by his own brother, for \"when the gods send evil none  can avoid it\".    In an interval the Chorus reflect on their King's impending doom. His  father's curse strikes them with dread; Oedipus himself was born of a  father Laius who, though warned thrice by Apollo that if he died without  issue he would save his land, listened to the counsels of friends and  in imprudence begat his own destroyer. Their song is interrupted by a  messenger who announces that they have prospered at six gates, but at  the seventh the two brothers have slain each other. This news inspires  another song in which the joy of deliverance gradually yields to pity  for an unhappy house, cursed and blighted, the glory of Oedipus serving  but to make more acute the shame of his latter end and the triumph of  the ruin he invoked on his sons. The agony of this scene is intensified  by the entry of Ismene and Antigone, Oedipus' daughters, the latter  mourning for Polyneices, the former for Eteocles. The climax is  reached when a herald announces a decree made by the senate and people.  Eteocles, their King who defended the land, was to be buried with all  honours, but Polyneices was to lie unburied. Calmly and with great  dignity Antigone informs the herald that if nobody else buries her  brother, she will. A warning threat fails to move her. The play closes  with a double note of terror at the doom of Polyneices and pity for the  death of a brave King.    Further progress in dramatic art has been made in this play. One of the  main sources of the pathos of human life is the operation of what  seems to us to be mere blind chance. Just as the casual dropping of  Desdemona's handkerchief gave Iago his opportunity, so the casual  allotting of the seven gates brings the two brothers into conflict.  But behind it was the working of an inherited curse; yet Aeschylus is  careful to point out that the curse need never have existed at all but  for the wilfulness of"]]]
