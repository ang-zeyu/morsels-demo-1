Give my compliments to Herr Artaria, and thank him from me for  his kind offer of an advance, but as I have received from abroad the money  due to me, I do not require to avail myself of his aid. Farewell, Knight  Falstaff; do not be too dissipated, read the Gospel, and be converted!    We remain, your well-affected    BEETHOVEN.    To Sir John Falstaff, Knight.  To the care of Herr Artaria & Co.      297.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Moedling, Sept. 1820.    Since last Tuesday evening I have been far from well, but hoped by Friday,  certainly, to have had the happiness of waiting on Y.R.H. This proved a  delusion, and it is only to-day that I am able to say confidently that I  expect to present myself before Y.R.H. next Monday or Tuesday at an early  hour. I ascribe my illness to having taken an open _caleche_, in order not  to miss my appointment with Y.R.H. The day was very wet and positively  _cold_ here towards the evening. Nature seems almost to have been offended  by the liberty I took, and by my audacity, and to have punished me in  consequence. May Heaven bestow on Y.R.H. all that is good and holy, as well  as every charm and blessing, and on _me_ your favor, _but only in so far as  justice sanctions_!    [K.]      298.    TO HERR ARTARIA & CO.    Vienna, Dec. 17, 1820.    I thank you warmly for the advance of 150 florins, for which I have made  out the receipt in the name of his Imperial Highness the Cardinal, and I  beg, as I am in danger of losing one of my bank shares, that you will  advance me another 150 florins, which I pledge myself to repay within three  months at latest from this date. As a proof of my gratitude, I engage in  this letter to make over to you, as your exclusive property, one of my  compositions, consisting of two or more movements, without claiming payment  for it hereafter.    Your ever-complaisant    BEETHOVEN.    [L.S.]      299.    TO TOBIAS V. HASLINGER.    Baden, Sept. 10, 1821.    MY VERY DEAR FRIEND,--    On my way to Vienna yesterday, sleep overtook me in my carriage, which was  by no means strange, for having been obliged to rise so early every  morning, I never had a good night's sleep. While thus slumbering I dreamt  that I had gone on a far journey, to no less a place than to Syria, on to  Judea, and back, and then all the way to Arabia, when at length I actually  arrived at Jerusalem. The Holy City gave rise to thoughts of the Holy  Books. No wonder then if the man Tobias occurred to me, which also  naturally led me to think of our own little Tobias and our great Tobias.  Now during my dream-journey, the following Canon came into my head:--    [Music: Bass clef, F major, 2/4 time. _Lively in the upper octave._  O Tobias!  O Tobias! Dominus Ha--slinger o!  o! o Tobias!]    But scarcely did I wake when away flew the Canon, and I could not recall  any part of it. On returning here however, next day, in the same carriage,  (that of a poor Austrian musician,) I resumed my dream-journey, being,  however, on this occasion wide awake, when lo and behold! in accordance  with the laws of the association of ideas the same Canon again flashed  across me; so being now awake I held it as fast as Menelaus did Proteus,  only permitting it to be changed into three parts.    [Music: Treble, Tenor, and Bass clef staves, F major, 2/4 time.  O Tobias!  O Tobias!  Dominus Ha--slinger o!]    Farewell! I intend to send next something composed on Steiner's name, to  show that his is no heart of stone [Stein]. Adieu, my good friend; it is my  most heartfelt wish that you may prosper as a publisher; may all credit be  given to you, and yet may you never require credit. Sing daily the Epistles  of St. Paul, and daily visit Father Werner, who can show you in his little  book how to go straight to heaven. See, how anxious I am about the welfare  of your soul!    I remain always, with infinite pleasure, henceforth and forever,    Your faithful debtor,    BEETHOVEN.      300.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Unterdoebling, July 18, 1821.    I yesterday heard of Y.R.H.'s arrival here; joyful tidings for me, but  saddened by knowing that it must be some time before I can have the good  fortune to wait on Y.R.H.; having been long very ill, at last _jaundice_  declared itself, which I consider a most loathsome malady. I trust,  however, I shall be so far recovered as to see Y.R.H. before you leave  this. Last winter, too, I had some very severe rheumatic attacks. Much of  this proceeds from the melancholy state of my family affairs; I have  hitherto hoped, by every possible exertion on my part, at last to remedy  these. That Providence, who searches my inmost heart, and knows that as a  man I have striven sacredly to fulfil all the duties imposed on me by  humanity, God, and Nature, will no doubt one day extricate me from all  these troubles. The Mass [in D] will be delivered to Y.R.H. here. I hope  Y.R.H. will excuse my entering into the various causes of the delay. The  details could not be otherwise than painful to Y.R.H. I would often gladly  have written to Y.R.H. from here, but you told me to wait till I first  heard from you. What, then, was I to do? Y.R.H. might have been displeased  had I not attended to your injunction, and I know that there are people who  are glad to calumniate me to Y.R.H., which pains me exceedingly. I  therefore often think that my sole recourse is to keep quiet till Y.R.H.  expresses a wish either to see or to hear of me. I was told that Y.R.H. had  been indisposed, but I hope it was nothing serious. May Heaven shower down  its most precious blessings on Y.R.H.! I trust it may not be very long  before I shall be so fortunate as to assure Y.R.H. how entirely I am, &c.,  &c.    [K.]      301.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Unterdoebling, July 18, 1821.    I have written a long and minute letter to Y.R.H., which my copyist  Schlemmer will deliver. I wrote it on hearing the day before yesterday of  the arrival of Y.R.H. How much I grieve that the attack of jaundice with  which I am affected prevents my at once hastening to Y.R.H. to express in  person my joy at your arrival. May the Lord of all things, for the sake of  so many others, take Y.R.H. under His protection!    [K.]      302.    TO THE MOST CELEBRATED MUSIC FIRM IN EUROPE, MESSRS. STEINER & CO.,  PATERNOSTER-(MISERERE) GAeSSEL.    I request Geh'-bauer[1] to send me two tickets, as some of my friends wish  to attend your hole-and-corner music. You probably have some of these  worthless admission tickets; so let me have one or two.    The part I send belongs to the Chorus, of which Bauer has the other  portions. Your _amicus_    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Gebauer established the \"Concerts Spirituels\" in 1819, and  died in 1822.]      303.    ADDRESS UNKNOWN.    Baden, Sept. 27, 1821.    I hope, sir, that you will forgive the liberty I take in thus intruding on  you. The bearer of this, H. v. ----, has been commissioned by me to  exchange or sell a bank-note. Being ignorant of everything connected with  these matters, I beg you will be so good as to communicate your views and  advice to the bearer. The two illnesses I had last winter and summer rather  deranged all my calculations. I have been here since the 7th of September,  and must remain till the end of October. All this costs a great deal of  money, and prevents my earning it as usual. I indeed expect shortly to  receive money from abroad, but as bank-notes stand so high at present, I  consider this the easiest resource, and intend subsequently to purchase a  new bank-note in its place.    Immediate--in haste.    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.    [This unsealed letter was enclosed in an envelope on which was written:]    You will at once see what kind of commercial genius I am. After writing the  enclosed, I for the first time consulted a friend about the note, who  pointed out to me that all I had to do was to cut off a _coupon_, and the  affair was completed. I rejoice, therefore, not to be obliged to plague you  further on the subject.    Yours,    BEETHOVEN.      304.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Feb. 27, 1822.    I went to-day early to the Palace, not, indeed, with the intention of  meeting Y.R.H., (not being yet dressed), but only to beg Zips to mention  that I had called, and was sincerely rejoiced at your arrival here; but I  could no longer discover Y.R.H.'s apartments, and wherever I knocked in the  hope of finding Y.R.H., my dress seemed to be so closely scrutinized that I  hurried away, and write to-day to recommend myself to Y.R.H. To-morrow I  intend to pay my respects to Y.R.H., when I hope also to hear whether the  usual _musical and intellectual meetings_ are to continue, and when they  are to take place. My not having written all this time to Y.R.H. has indeed  a very bad appearance, but I delayed from day to day, hoping always to send  the Mass, the mistakes in which were really quite dreadful; so much so that  I was obliged to revise _every part_, and thus the delay occurred. Other  pressing occupations and various circumstances tended to impede me, which  is often the case when a man least expects it. That Y.R.H., however, was  ever present with me is shown by the following copies of some novelties,[1]  which have been lying finished by me for some time for Y.R.H., but I  resolved not to forward them till I could at the same time send the Mass.  The latter now only requires binding, when it shall be respectfully  delivered to Y.R.H. by myself. Sincerely rejoiced at the hope of soon  personally waiting on Y.R.H., I remain, with devoted homage, yours till  death.    [K.]    [Footnote 1: The _novelties_ which Beethoven sends to the Archduke are:--    Six _bagatelles_ for the pianoforte,      Op. 126 (composed in 1821).

The little magician was so pleased with the kindness of both  the Emperor and Empress that he returned it in his own childish way,  by climbing into the lap of the Empress and giving her a hug and a  kiss, just as though she were his own mother. He was also greatly  attracted by the little Princess Marie Antoinette, a beautiful child  of about his own age, with long fair curls and laughing blue eyes. The  two struck up an immediate friendship.    After the favor shown them at Court, the gifted children became the  rage in Vienna society. Invitations poured in from every side, and  many gifts. Those bestowed by the royal family were perhaps the most  valued. Wolfgang's present was a violet colored suit, trimmed with  broad gold braid, while Nannerl received a pretty white silk dress.  Each of the children also received a beautiful diamond ring from the  Emperor. A portrait of the boy in his gala suit, which was painted at  the time, is still preserved.    The following year the Mozarts took the children on a longer journey,  this time with Paris in view. They stopped at many towns and cities  on the way. At Frankfort the first performance was so successful that  three more were given. A newspaper of the time says \"little Mozart  is able to name all notes played at a distance, whether single or in  chords, whether played on the piano, or any other instrument, bell,  glass or clock.\" The father offered as an additional attraction that  Wolfgang would play with the keyboard covered.    The family stayed five months in Paris; the children played before  the Court at Versailles, exciting surprise and enthusiasm there and  wherever they appeared. From Paris they traveled to London, in April,  1764.    Leopold Mozart's first care on reaching the great English metropolis  was to obtain an introduction at Court. King George III and the Queen  were very fond of music, and it was not long before an invitation came  for the children to attend at the Palace. The King showed the greatest  interest in Wolfgang, asking him to play at sight difficult pieces by  Bach and Handel. Then the boy, after accompanying the Queen in a song,  selected the bass part in a piece by Handel, and improvised a charming  melody to it. The King was so impressed that he wished him to play the  organ, in the playing of which Wolfgang won a further triumph.    The King's birthday was to be celebrated on June 4 and London was  crowded with people from all parts of the country. Leopold Mozart had  chosen June 5 as the date for his first public concert. The hall was  filled to overflowing; one hundred guineas being taken in. Many of the  assisting performers would take no fee for their services, which added  to the father's gratitude and happiness.    Not long after this Leopold Mozart fell ill, and the little family  moved to Chelsea, for the quiet and good air. Later they were  given another reception at Court, where, after Wolfgang's wonderful  performances, the children won much applause by playing some piano  duets composed by the boy--a style of composition then quite new.    In July, 1765, the family left London and traveled in Holland, after  which came a second visit to Paris, where they added to their former  triumphs, in addition to playing in many towns on the way back.  Finally the long tour was brought to a close by the return to Salzburg  in November, 1766.    At the period of musical history in which the gifted boy lived, a  musician's education was not complete unless he went to Italy, for  this country stood first as the home of music. Leopold Mozart had made  a couple of trips to Vienna with his children, the account of which  need not detain us here. He had decided that Wolfgang must go to  Italy, and breathe in the atmosphere of that land of song. And so in  December, 1769, father and son set out for the sunny south, with high  hopes for success.    Mozart's happy nature was jubilant over the journey. He watched  eagerly the peasants as they danced on the vine-clad terraces,  overlooking the deep blue lakes,--or listened as they sang at their  work in the sunny fields. He gazed at the wonderful processions of  priests through narrow streets of the towns, but above all there was  the grand music in the cathedrals.    The young musician had plenty of work to do, more than most boys  of thirteen. For, besides the concerts he had to give, he was set  difficult problems by the various professors who wished to test his  powers. The fame of his playing constantly spread, so the further he  traveled into Italy there were more demands to hear him. At Roveredo,  where it was announced he would play the organ in St. Thomas's Church,  the crowd was so great he could scarcely get to the organ-loft. The  vast audience listened spellbound, and then refused to disperse till  they had caught a glimpse of the boy player. At Verona he had another  triumph; one of his symphonies was performed, and his portrait was  ordered to be painted.    When they reached Milan the Chief musician of the city subjected the  boy to severe tests, all of which he accomplished to the astonishment  and delight of everybody. It was at Bologna however, where he met  the most flattering reception. Here was the home of the famous Padre  Martini, the aged composer of church music. Father Martini was almost  worshiped by the Italians; he was a most lovable man and looked up to  as a great composer. He had long ago given up attending concerts, so  that every one was astonished when he was present in the brilliant  audience gathered at Count Pallavicini's mansion to listen to the  boy's playing. Wolfgang did his best, for he realized the importance  of the event. Father Martini took the boy to his heart at once,  invited him to visit him as often as possible during his stay,  and gave him several fugue subjects to work out. These the boy  accomplished with ease, and the Padre declared he was perfectly  satisfied with his knowledge of composition.    The journey to Rome was now continued, and for Wolfgang it was a  succession of triumphs. At Florence he played before the Court of the  Archduke Leopold, and solved every problem put to him by the Court  music director as easily as though he were eating a bit of bread.    It was Holy Week when young Mozart and his father entered Rome, and  the city lay under the spell of the great festival of the year. They  soon joined the throngs that filled the vast temple of St. Peter's,  to which all turn during this solemn season. After attending a service  and viewing the treasures of the Cathedral, they turned their steps to  the Sistine Chapel, which contains the wonderful painting of the Last  Judgment by Michael Angelo. It was here that the celebrated Miserere  by Allegri was performed. Wolfgang had been looking forward to this  moment all through the latter part of his journey. His father had told  him how jealously guarded this music was; it could never be performed  in any other place, and the singers could never take their parts out  of the chapel. He was intensely eager to hear this work. And indeed it  would be difficult to imagine anything more beautiful and impressive  than the singing of the Miserere, which means \"Have Mercy.\" It follows  the solemn service called Tenebrae, (Darkness) during which the six  tall candles on the altar are extinguished one by one,--till but one  is left, which is removed to a space behind the altar. Then in almost  complete darkness the Miserere begins. A single voice is heard singing  the antiphon, or short introduction,--and then comes silence, a  silence so profound that the listener scarcely dares to breathe  for fear of disturbing it. At length the first sad notes of the  supplication are heard, like the softest wailing of an anguished  spirit; they gradually gain force till the whole building seems to  throb with the thrilling intensity of the music.    The young musician was profoundly moved; the father too was much  affected by the solemn service. Neither spoke as they left the chapel  and sought their lodgings. After they had retired the boy could not  sleep; his thoughts were filled with the wonderful music he had heard.  He arose, lit the lamp, and got out pens and music paper. He worked  industriously the long night through. When morning dawned the boy sat  with his beautiful head upon his folded arms, asleep, while before him  on the table lay a score of the Miserere of Allegri, entirely written  from memory.    The next day, Good Friday, the Miserere was performed for the second  time. Wolfgang, the boy of fourteen, who had performed the wonderful  feat of writing this work out after one hearing, again attended the  service, keeping the score in his hat, and found his work was nearly  perfect, needing but a couple of trifling corrections.    The news of this startling feat gained for the young musician a  cordial welcome into the houses of the great in Rome; during their  stay father and son were feted to their hearts' content.    At Naples, their next stopping place, Wolfgang played before a  brilliant company, and excited so much astonishment, that people  declared his power in playing came from a ring he wore on his finger.  \"He wears a charm,\" they cried. Mozart smiled, took off the ring and  played more brilliantly than ever. Then the enthusiasm was redoubled.  The Neapolitans showed them every attention and honor. A carriage  was provided for their use, and we have an account of how they drove  through the best streets, the father wearing a maroon-colored coat  with light blue facings, and Wolfgang in one of apple green, with  rose-colored facings and silver buttons.    It was indeed a wonderful tour which they made in Italy, though there  is not time to tell of many things that happened. On their return to  Rome, the Pope gave him the order of the Golden Spur, which made him  Chevalier de Mozart. Arriving at Bologna the young musician was made a  member of the Accademia"]]]
