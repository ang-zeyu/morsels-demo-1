It was  more probably written when he was twelve or fourteen, as he showed at  nine none of the signs of precocity which such a composition indicates.  The youthful Channing took for his text the fifteenth verse of the  thirteenth chapter of Proverbs: \"Good understanding giveth favor: but  the way of transgressors is hard.\" Upon this he expounded as follows:      \"The life of a Christian is often compared to a race that is hard    and to a battle in which a man must fight hard to win, these    comparisons have prevented many from becoming Christians.      \"But the Bible does not compare the Christian's path as one of hard    labor. But Solomon says wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness and    her paths are peace. Under the word transgressor are included all    those that disobey their maker, or, in shorter words, the ungodly.    Every person looking around him will see many who are transgressors    and whose lot is very hard.      \"I remark secondly that conscience makes the way of transgressors    hard; for every act of pleasure, every act of guilt his conscience    smites him. The last of his stay on earth will appear horrible to    the beholder. Sometimes, however, he will be stayed in his guilt. A    death in a family of some favorite object, or be attacked by some    disease himself, is brought to the portals of the grave. Then for a    little time, perhaps, he is stayed in his wickedness, but before    long he returns to his worldly lusts. Oh, it is indeed hard for a    sinner to go down into perhaps perdition over all the obstacles    which God has placed in his path. But many, I am afraid, do go down    into perdition, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that    leadeth to destruction, and many there be that go in after it.      \"Suppose now there was a fearful precipice and to allure you there    your enemies should scatter flowers on its dreadful edge, would you    if you knew that while you were strolling about on that awful rock    that night would settle down on you and that you would fall from    that giddy, giddy height, would you, I say, go near that dreadful    rock? Just so with the transgressor, he falls from that height just    because he wishes to appear good in the sight of the world. But what    will a man gain if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul.\"    Whenever this was written it shows on its face that it is more an  effort of memory or the effect of one of the fearful sermons of fifty  years ago on the impressionable mind of youth, than the original  production of a precocious boy struggling with the insoluble problem of  life and judgment to come. Mark how the stock words of the pulpiteer,  \"transgressor,\" \"worldly lusts,\" \"dreadful,\" \"awful,\" \"perdition\" stalk  fiercely through the sermon of the youthful saint or sinner!    Roswell Field says that his brother without instruction early acquired  the habit of drawing amusing pictures of his playmates and his pets,  and that later in life he gave it as his honest opinion that he would  have been much more successful as a caricaturist than as a writer. But  Eugene's drawings at all periods were never more than grotesque or  fanciful illustrations of the whimsical ideas he harbored respecting  everything that came to his attention.    In after life Eugene Field gave frequent proof that he cherished  contradictory sentiments toward Vermont and New England. One view was  tinged, I think, with the recollection of the wrong his father suffered  at the hands of the Green Mountain courts, and reflects the general  tenor of his comment whenever Vermont men or affairs came under  discussion in the public press. It is illustrated in the following  paragraph:      The Vermont papers agreed that Colonel Aldace Walker is the very    best man in Vermont for the Inter-State Commerce Commission. This    may be true. At the same time, however, we fail to see what interest    Vermont can possibly take in inter-state commerce. She has no    commerce of her own, and she probably never will have. There is a    bobbin factory at Williamsville, and a melodeon factory at    Brattleboro, but the commerce resulting from them is not worthy of    mention. There is talk about the maple-sugar that Vermont exports,    but we have noticed that all the \"genuine Vermont maple-sugar\" in    the Western market comes from the South, and is about as succulent    as the heel of a gum-boot. In all the State of Vermont there is but    one railroad, the Vermont Central; it begins at Grout's Corner,    Mass., and runs in a bee-line north until it reaches the southern    end of the Montreal bridge. This remarkable road has a so-called    branch operating once per week between White River Junction and    Montpelier, and a triweekly branch extending to Burlington.    Montpelier is the home of Hiram Atkins, the famous \"Nestor uv    Checkerberry Journalism,\" and White River Junction is the whistling    station and water-tank from which our country gets its election    returns every four years. Burlington is located on Lake Champlain,    and contains the summer residence of that grand old survivor of the    glacial period, George F. Edmunds. Thus in a brief paragraph have we    compressed all that can be said of the commerce and the railways of    Vermont.    The other view is softened with the haze that hangs over the scenes of  childhood in the minds of all men of feeling when interpreted by an  artist in expressing the thought \"that unbidden rises and passes in a  tear.\" It is from Field's little-known memorial to Mrs. Melvin L. Gray,  written while he was in Southern California:      The quiet beauty of these scenes recalls a time which, in my life,    is so long ago that I feel strangely reverential when I speak of it.    I find myself thinking of my boyhood, and of the hills and valleys    and trees and flowers and birds I knew when the morning of my life    was fresh and full of exuberance. Those years were spent among the    Pelham hills, very, very far from here; but memory o'erleaps the    mountain ranges, the leagues upon leagues of prairie, the mighty    rivers, the forest, the farming lands, o'erleaps them all; and    to-day, by that same sweet magic that instantaneously undoes the    years and space, I seem to be among the Pelham hills again. The    yonder glimpse of the Pacific becomes the silver thread of the    Connecticut, seen, not over miles of orange-groves, but over broad    acres of Indian corn; and instead of the pepper and eucalyptus, the    lemon and the palm, I see (or I seem to see) the maple once more,    and the elm and the chestnut trees, the shagbark walnut, the    hickory, and the birch. In those days, these rugged mountains of    this south land were unknown to me; and the Pelham hills were full    of marvel and delight, with their tangled pathways and hidden stores    of wintergreen and wild strawberries. Furtive brooks led the little    boy hither and thither in his quest for trout and dace, while to the    gentler-minded the modest flowers of the wild-wood appealed with    singular directness. A partridge rose now and then from the thicket    and whirred away, and with startled eyes the brown thrush peered out    from the bushes. I see these pleasant scenes again, and I hear again    the beloved sounds of old; and so with reverence and with welcoming    I take up my task, for it was among these same Pelham hills that the    dear lady of whom I am to speak was born and spent her childhood.          CHAPTER V    EDUCATION      There was more truth than epigrammatic novelty in Eugene Field's  declaration that his education began when he fancied he had left it off  for the serious business of life. Throughout his boyhood he was far  from a hardy youth. He always gave the impression of having overgrown  his strength, so that delicate health, and not indisposition to study,  has been assigned as the excuse for his backwardness in \"book larnin'\"  when it was decided to send him away from the congenial distractions of  Amherst to the care of the Rev. James Tufts of Monson.    Monson is a very prettily situated Massachusetts town, about fifteen  miles, as the crow flies, east of Springfield, and not more than  twenty-five miles south by east of Amherst. It boasted then and still  boasts one of the best equipped boys' academies in New England. It was  not to the tender mercies of this academy, however, that Eugene was  entrusted, but to the private tutorship of Mr. Tufts, whose life and  character justify the tribute of Roswell Field that he is \"one of those  noble instructors of the blessed old school who are passing away from  the arena of education in America.\" He is now, in 1901, in his  ninetieth year, and is always spoken of among his neighbors as the  \"grand old man of Monson.\" From his own lips, accompanied by the lively  comments of Mrs. Tufts, and from a loving communication written by him  to the Springfield Republican shortly after Eugene Field's death I have  gleaned the general facts of Eugene Field's school-days at Monson.    [Illustration: A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF MONSON, MASS.]    It was in the Fall of 1865 that Eugene became one of a class of six  boys in the private school of Mr. Tufts. This school was chosen because  Mr. Tufts had known the boy's parents and grandparents and felt a real  interest in the lad. He would not have received the proper care at a  large school, where \"he would be likely to get into trouble with his  love of fun and mischief.\" The house in which Eugene became as one of  the family is situated about a mile from the village and faces the post  road, on the farther side of which is a mill-pond, where both Eugene  and Roswell came near making the writing of this memoir unnecessary by  going over the dam in a rude boat of their own construction. Happily  the experience resulted in nothing more serious than a thorough fright  and a still more thorough ducking.

Hawkins has moved his desk up into    Dennis's room, and Dock sits here at your table close to me while    you are gone. If he can afford it I do not object. It is    Ballantyne's plan to keep Hawkins doing paragraphs for the morning    and evening papers, and to put Bates (who returned to-day) in the    local department as chief copy-reader. At the theatres this week:    \"We, Us & Co.\" at Henderson's; \"Alone in London\" at Hooley's;    Redmund & Barry at McVicker's; \"Zitka\" at the Columbia, and Mayo at    the Grand. By the way, Dr. Reilly's wife's brother, Bruno Kennicoot,    has taken the management of the new Windsor Theatre on the North    Side; that makes another friend of mine among the managers of    Chicago. It is frightfully cold here; real winter weather. Good-by,    dear boy. Have a good time and make the home folks happy.      Yours as ever,      FIELD.      Post Scriptum:--Give my love to Miss Mary Matilda and to your    impetuous sister, Hel'n; also to the sceptical Bessie.      E.F.    The announcement which Field caused to be made in the Denver  newspapers and the letters of introduction which he gave to Mr.  Peattie resulted, as Field contemplated, in his having a lively time.  As the conspirator also took the precaution to advise the addressees  of these letters and the manager of the hotel of his fell purpose, Mr.  and Mrs. Peattie found themselves the victims of insistent and  deliberate misapprehensions from the moment they were shown to the  bridal suite until they fled from the swarm of land speculators and  mining promoters which Field's ingenuity brought about them wherever  they moved in Colorado. That this was merely a sportive method of  showing his real friendship for both Mr. and Mrs. Peattie may be  judged from the following verses:      _MR. PEATTIE'S CAPE      Oh, pale is Mr. Peattie's face        And lank is Mr. Peattie's shape,    But with a dreamy, sensuous grace,    Beseeming Peattie's swinging pace,        Hangs Mr. Peattie's cape!      'Tis wrought of honest woollen stuff        And bound about with cotton tape--    When winter winds are chill and rough    There's one big heart that's warm enough        In Mr. Peattie's cape!      It fits him loose about the ribs,        But hugs his neck from throat to nape,    And, spite his envious neighbors' fibs,    A happy fellow is his nibs        In Mr. Peattie's cape.      So here's defiance to the storm,        And here's a pledge in amber grape    To him whose heart is always warm,    And who conceals a lissome form        In Mr. Peattie's cape._    The following verses present an example of what Field could or could  not do with the Scotch dialect, which he seldom attempted. It was  inspired by the fact that Peattie had been named after Scotland's  dearest poet and by his own fondness for Robert and Elia:      _THE RETURN OF THE HIGHLANDER      He touted low and veiled his bonnet      When that he kenned his blushing Elia--    \"Gude faith\" he cried, \"my bonny bride,      I fashed mesell some wan wod steal ye!\"      \"My bonny loon,\" the gude wife answered,      \"When nane anither wod befriend me,    Gainst mickle woes and muckle foes,      Braw Donald Field did aft farfend me!\"      \"Of all the bonnie heelon chiels      There's nane sae braw as this gude laddie--    Wi' sike an arm to shield fro' harm--      Wi' sike a heart beneath his plaidie!\"      \"Gin Sandy Knox or Sawney Dennis      Or Dougal Thompson take delight in    A-fashing we wi' gholish glee--      Braw Donald Field wod do my fightin'!\"      Then Robert Peattie glowed wi' pleasure;      \"I wod na do the deed o' Sunday,    But Donald Field shall be well mealed      To-morrow, which I ken is Monday!\"      Then Robert took his gude wife hame      And spread a feast o' Finnan Haddie;    In language soft he praised her aft,      And aft she kiss her bonnie laddie.      October 23d, 1887._    Another bit of personal verse in my scrap-book is suggested by the  reference to Morgan Bates in the letter of September 12th in the form  of an acrostic to Clara Doty Bates, his wife. In the spring of 1886  Mr. and Mrs. Bates were occupying the home of Mrs. Coonley (now Mrs.  Lydia Coonley Ward) on LaSalle Avenue, and one day Morgan was boasting  in Field's presence of the palatial nature of their quarters. As the  anniversary of Mrs. Bates's birthday was at hand, Field immediately  proposed that the entire editorial staff of the News should invite  itself and its family to her hospitable board. Bates was taken into  the conspiracy of friendship, and on the evening of April 28th we  descended on Mrs. Coonley's North Side mansion and ransacked it from  cellar to garret. It was Field's humor that day to set every picture  in the house just enough awry to disturb Mrs. Bates's sensitive  vision. When she arrived on the scene she greeted us with the utmost  cordiality, as we did her. But no matter where she stood, her eye  would be annoyed by a picture-frame just out of plumb, and she would  be excused while she straightened it. Nearly every picture and  portrait on the lower floor had been adjusted before she understood  the motive of Field's solicitude to see every painting and engraving  in the house. Unlike the regulation surprise party of society, we had  not provided the refreshments for our own entertainment, and we had  Bates under bonds not to give Mrs. Bates an inkling of our visit. But  she was enough of a Martha to rise to the occasion. Several members of  the company were detailed on separate errands to Clark Street for  various raw meats and non-alcoholic liquid supplies, and Mrs. Bates  herself descended to the kitchen to oversee the preparation of the  bounteous feast which presently emerged from chaos. By way of grace,  Field read an impromptu poem written in dark blue ink on pale blue  paper with each line beginning with a capital in red:      _TO CLARA DOTY BATES      Circled around this fair and sumptuous board      (Like nymphs, dear ladies, you--like satyrs, we)      All to one purpose cheerfully agree--    Ruthless assault on Bates's savory hoard.      And since the skirmish duty falls on me--    Despite the wait, of hungry folk deplored--    One opening shot I claim, one modest toast      To her who makes life easy for our host.      You, madam, have achieved a noble fame,      Better by far than selfishness could earn--    A million grateful children bless your name--      To you we drink--then to the viands turn;      Easy, mayhap, it is to write a book--      Success to her whose muse will deign to cook!      E.F.    Chicago, April 28, 1886._      III      CHICAGO, Tuesday night, September the 14th, 1886.      My Dear Child:--This man Reilly, who has thrust himself upon me    during your absence, is fast becoming a seven-year itch. He sprawls    about over this room of mine as if it were his own, he strews his    damned medical literature over my table, he has a constant stream of    idiot callers, and he refuses to give up when I demand truage of    him. I hope you will pack your gripsack and start home immediately    upon receipt of this. Ballantyne left for St. Louis a few moments    ago. In honor of the fact that he is supposed to be on deck    to-night, Stone has taken his family and gone to the Casino Theatre    for the evening.      Cowen spent the night at my house last night and to-day Pinny caught    twenty-five crickets for him to take to his room to make music for    him. While Cowen was riding down in the car a pretty girl got    aboard, and in trying to get a peep at her Cowen dropped the box    containing the crickets. For some moments it rained crickets. The    women climbed up on the seats of the car and there was general    alarm. I believe that Cowen recovered three of the crickets, but two    of these had but two legs between them.      The Chicagos won the game at St. Louis yesterday (1 to 0), but lost    to-day (4 to 5). Flynn pitched yesterday and your friend Clarkson    pitched to-day. It wouldn't surprise me if Chicago and Detroit were    to go East tied.      Ballantyne has made Hawkins move his desk back to the library and    Hawkins is passing wroth about it.      Here is what I bought Gussie for a wedding present to-day: 2 quires    of paper with envelopes, 1 curling iron, 2 papers of pins, 2 papers    of hairpins, 1 darning ball, 2 combs, 1 bottle Calder's tooth    powder, 1 bottle of vaseline, 1 bottle of shoe polish, 1 box of lip    salve, 1 button hook and 1 bottle of listerine.      It is quite wintry here. We are all well. Remember me to Marie    Matilde and to la belle Helene.      Affectionately yours,      EUGENE FIELD.    It must not be inferred from anything in these letters that Field's  relations with Dr. Reilly were ever anything but the most friendly  and grateful. It simply amused him to rail at and revile one of his  best friends.      IV      CHICAGO, Wednesday night, September the 15th, 1886.      My dear Nompy:--Presumably you are by this time sitting by the sad    sea waves in that dreary Canuck watering place, drawing sight drafts    on the banks of Newfoundland and letting the chill east wind blow    through your whiskers. We, too, are demoralized. That senile old    substitute of yours--the Dock--has been as growly-powly as a bear    to-day. As for me, I am growing desperate. You can see by the    enclosed picture how changed I am.    [Illustration: FIELD'S PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.  \"_As I would have looked but for the refining influence of Old  Nompy._\"]      Well, Chicago beat St. Louis to-day and, the gods be glorified!    Kansas City beat Detroit! as for New York, Boston whipped her day    before yesterday and Washington shut her out to-day! now if Detroit    will only lose a game or two to St. Louis! I more than half suspect    that your home folk will think that you and I are base-ball mad.      Stone"]]]
