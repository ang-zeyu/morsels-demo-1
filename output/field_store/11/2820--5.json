I like these persons who ply their trades upon the sidewalk. My hatter--the  fellow who cleans my straw hat each Spring--is a partner of a bootblack.  Over his head as he putters with his soap and brushes, there hangs a rusty  sign proclaiming that he is famous for his cleaning all round the world. He  is so modest in his looks that I have wondered whether he really can read  the sign. Or perhaps like a true merchant, he is not squeamish at the  praise. As I have not previously been aware that any of his profession ever  came to general fame except the Mad Hatter of Wonderland, I have squinted  sharply at him to see if by chance it might be he, but there are no marks  even of a distant kinship. He does, however, bring my hat to a marvellous  whiteness and it may be true that he has really tended heads that are now  gone beyond Constantinople.    Bootblacks have a sense of rhythm unparalleled. Of this the long rag is  their instrument. They draw it once or twice across the shoe to set the key  and then they go into a swift and pattering melody. If there is an unusual  genius in the bootblack--some remnant of ancient Greece--he plays such a  lively tune that one's shoulders jig to it. If there were a dryad or other  such nimble creature on the street, she would come leaping as though  Orpheus strummed a tune, but the dance is too fast for our languid northern  feet.    Nowhere are apples redder than on a cart. Our hearts go out to Adam in the  hour of his temptation. I know one lady of otherwise careful appetite who  even leans toward dates if she may buy them from a cart. \"Those dear dirty  dates,\" she calls them, but I cannot share her liking for them. Although  the cart is a beguiling market, dates so bought are too dusty to be eaten.  They rank with the apple-john. The apple-john is that mysterious leathery  fruit, sold more often from a stand than from a cart, which leans at the  rear of the shelf against the peppermint jars. For myself, although I do  not eat apple-johns, I like to look at them. They are so shrivelled and so  flat, as though a banana had caught a consumption. Or rather, in the older  world was there not a custom at a death of sending fruits to support the  lonesome journey? If so, the apple-john came untasted to the end. Indeed,  there is a look of old Egypt about the fruit. Whether my fondness for  gazing at apple-johns springs from a distant occasion when as a child I  once bought and ate one, or whether it arises from the fact that Falstaff  called Prince Hal a dried apple-john, is an unsolved question, but I like  to linger before a particularly shrivelled one and wonder what its youth  was like. Perhaps like many of its betters, it remained unheralded and  unknown all through its fresher years and not until the coming of its  wrinkled age was it at last put up to the common view. The apple-john sets  up kinship with an author.    The day of all fools is wisely put in April. The jest of the day resides in  the success with which credulity is imposed upon, and April is the month of  easiest credulity. Let bragging travellers come in April and hold us with  tales of the Anthropopagi! If their heads are said to grow beneath their  shoulders, still we will turn a credent ear. Indeed, it is all but sure  that Baron Munchausen came back from his travels in the Spring. When  else could he have got an ear? What man can look upon the wonders of the  returning year--the first blue skies, the soft rains, the tender sproutings  of green stalks without feeling that there is nothing beyond belief? If  such miracles can happen before his eyes, shall not the extreme range even  of travel or metaphysics be allowed? What man who has smelled the first  fragrance of the earth, has heard the birds on their northern flight and  has seen an April brook upon its course, will withhold his credence even  though the jest be plain?    I beg, therefore, that when you walk upon the street on the next day of  April fool, that you yield to the occasion. If an urchin points his finger  at your hat, humor him by removing it! Look sharply at it for a supposed  defect! His glad shout will be your reward. Or if you are begged piteously  to lift a stand-pipe wrapped to the likeness of a bundle, even though you  sniff the imposture, seize upon it with a will! It is thus, beneath these  April skies, that you play your part in the pageantry that marks the day.          The Friendly Genii      Do you not confess yourself to be several years past that time of greenest  youth when burnt cork holds its greatest charm? Although not fallen to a  crippled state, are you not now too advanced to smudge your upper lip and  stalk agreeably as a villain? Surely you can no longer frisk lightly in  a comedy. If you should wheeze and limp in an old man's part, with back  humped in mimicry, would you not fear that it bordered on the truth? But  doubtless there was a time when you ranged upon these heights--when Kazrac  the magician was not too heavy for your art. In those soaring days, let us  hope that you played the villain with a swagger, or being cast in a softer  role, that you won a pink and fluffy princess before the play was done.  Your earliest practice, it may be, was in rigging the parlor hangings as a  curtain with brown string from the pantry and safety pins. Although you had  no show to offer, you said \"ding\" three times--as is the ancient custom of  the stage when the actors are ready--and drew them wide apart. The cat  was the audience, who dozed with an ear twitching toward your activity. A  complaint that springs up in youth and is known as \"snuffles\" had kept you  out of school. It had gripped you hard at breakfast, when you were sunk in  fear of your lessons, but had abated at nine o'clock. Whether the cure came  with a proper healing of the nasal glands or followed merely on the ringing  of the school bell, must be left to a cool judgment.    Your theatre filled the morning. When Annie came on her quest for dust, you  tooted once upon your nose, just to show that a remnant of your infirmity  persisted, then put your golden convalescence on the making of your  curtain.    But in the early hours of afternoon when the children are once more upon  the street, you regret your illness. Here they come trooping by threes and  fours, carrying their books tied up in straps. One would think that they  were in fear lest some impish fact might get outside the covers to spoil  the afternoon. Until the morrow let two and two think themselves five at  least! And let Ohio be bounded as it will! Some few children skip ropes, or  step carefully across the cracks of the sidewalk for fear they spoil their  suppers. Ah!--a bat goes by--a glove--a ball! And now from a vacant lot  there comes the clamor of choosing sides. Is no mention to be made of  you--you, \"molasses fingers\"--the star left fielder--the timely batter?  What would you not give now for a clean bill of health? You rub your  offending nose upon the glass. What matters it with what deep rascality in  black mustachios you once strutted upon your boards? What is Hecuba to you?    My own first theatre was in the attic, a place of squeaks and shadows  to all except the valiant. In it were low, dark corners where the night  crawled in and slept. But in the open part where the roof was highest,  there was the theatre. Its walls were made of a red cambric of a flowered  pattern that still lingers with me, and was bought with a clatter of  pennies on the counter, together with nickels that had escaped my  extravagance at the soda fountain.    A cousin and I were joint proprietors. In the making of it, the hammer and  nails were mine by right of sex, while she stitched in womanish fashion on  the fabrics. She was leading woman and I was either the hero or the villain  as fitted to my mood. My younger cousin--although we scorned her for her  youth--was admitted to the slighter parts. She might daub herself with  cork, but it must be only when we were done. Nor did we allow her to carry  the paper knife--shaped like a dagger--which figured hugely in our plots.  If we gave her any word to speak, it was as taffy to keep her silent about  some iniquity that we had worked against her. In general, we judged her to  be too green and giddy for the heavy parts. At the most, she might take  pins at the door--for at such a trifle we displayed our talents--or play  upon the comb as orchestra before the rising of the curtain.    The usual approach to this theatre was the kitchen door, and those who came  to enjoy the drama sniffed at their very entrance the new-baked bread. A  pan of cookies was set upon a shelf and a row of apples was ranged along  the window sill. Of the ice-box around the corner, not a word, lest hunger  lead you off! As for the cook, although her tongue was tart upon a just  occasion and although she shooed the children with her apron, secretly she  liked to have them crowding through her kitchen.    Now if you, reader--for I assume you to be one of the gathering  audience--were of the kind careful on scrubbing days to scrape your feet  upon the iron outside and to cross the kitchen on the unwashed parts, then  it is likely that you stood in the good graces of the cook. Mark your  reward! As you journeyed upward, you munched upon a cookie and bit scallops  in its edge. Or if a ravenous haste was in you--as commonly comes up in the  middle afternoon--you waived this slower method and crammed yourself with  a recklessness that bestrewed the purlieus of your mouth. If your ears lay  beyond the muss, the stowage was deemed decent and in order.    Is there not a story in which children are tracked by an ogre through the  perilous wood by the crumbs they dropped? Then let "]]]
