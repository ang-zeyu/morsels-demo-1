He was feared by all the company of  religionists that had taken up their precarious quarters near Mahomet. He  was visiting the house of his sister Fatima when he heard murmurs of  someone reciting. He inquired what it was, and learned with anger that it  was the Sacred Book of the abhorred Muslim sect. His sister and Zeid, her  husband, tremblingly confessed their adherence to Islam, and awaited in  terror the probable result. Omar was about to fall upon Zeid, but his  wife interposed and received the blow herself. At the sight of his  sister's blood Omar paused and then asked for the volume, so that he  might judge the message for himself, for he was a writer of no mean  standing. Fatima insisted that he should first perform ablutions, so that  his touch might not defile the Sacred Book.    Then Omar took it and read it, and the strength and beauty of it smote  him. He felt upon him the insistence of a divine command, and straightway  asked to be led before Mahomet that he might unburden his conviction to  him. He girt on his sword and came to the Prophet's house. As he rapped  upon the door a Companion of Mahomet's looked through the lattice, and at  the sight of Omar with buckled sword fled in despair to his master. But  Mahomet replied:      \"Let him enter; if he bring good tidings we will reward him; if he bring  bad news, we will smite him, yea, with his own sword.\"    So the door was opened and Mahomet advanced, asking what was his mission.  Omar answered:    \"O Prophet of God, I am come to confess that I believe in Allah and in  his Prophet.\"    \"Allah Akbar!\" (God is great) replied Mahomet gravely, and all the  household knew that Omar had become one of themselves.    The conversion of Omar was infinitely important to Islam, and the  adherence of this impetuous and dauntless mind was directly due to the  strength and steadfastness of Mahomet's faith in himself and his message.  Omar was an influential personage among the Kureisch, quick-tempered, but  keen as steel, and rejoicing in strife; he stands out among the many  warrior-souls to whom Islam gave the opportunity of tasting in its  fullness \"the splendour of spears.\" Mahomet had indeed gathered around  him a group of men who were remarkable for their character and influence  upon Islam. Ali, the warrior par excellence, Abu Bekr, statesman and  counsellor, Othman the soldier, Hamza and Omar, are not merely blind  followers, but forceful personalities, contributing each in his own  manner towards those assets of endurance, leadership, and unshaken faith  which ensured the continuance of the Medinan colony and its ultimate  victory over the Kureisch.    Omar's conversion did not have the effect of softening the Kureischite  fury. On the contrary, the event seems to have stimulated them to  further persecution, as if they had some foreshadowings of their waning  power, and had determined with a desperate energy to quell for ever, if  it might be, this discord in their midst. Their next step was to try an  introduce the political element into this conflict of faiths by putting a  ban upon the house of Hashim and confining it to Abu Talib's quarter of  Sheb. This act, instigated mainly by Abu Jahl, who now becomes prominent  as the most terrible of Mahomet's persecutors, had a very notable effect  upon his position as well as upon the qualities of the cause for which  his party was contending.    For the first time the political aspect of Islam obtrudes itself.  Mahomet's followers are now not only the opponents of the Kureischite  faith and the enemies of their idols, but they are also their political  foes, and have drawn the whole house of Hashim into faction against the  ruling power--the Omeyyad house. Moreover, Mahomet and his companions,  now shut up and almost besieged within a definite quarter of the city,  were precluded from all attempts to spread their faith. Mahomet had  secured his little company of followers, but cut off from the rest of the  city his cause remained stationary, neither gaining nor losing adherents,  during the years 617-619.    The suras of this period show some of the discouragement he felt at the  time, but through them all beats a note of endurance and confidence:  God is continually behind his cause, therefore that cause will prevail  against all obstacles. Mahomet has become more familiar with the Jewish  Scriptures, and many of the suras are recapitulations of the lives of  Jewish heroes, especial preference being given to Abraham as mythical  founder of his race, and to Lot as the typical example of one righteous  man sent to warn the iniquitous. The style has certainly matured, and in  so doing has lost much of its primal fire. It is still stirring and  vibrant, but passages of almost bald narrative are interposed, shadows  upon the shining floor of his original zeal. He has become increasingly  reiterative, too,--a quality easily attained by those who have but  one message, in this case a message of warning and exhortation, and  are feverishly anxious to brand its urgency upon the hearts of their  fellow-men.      Confined within so limited an area, his energy recoiled upon itself, and  the despondency that so easily besets men of action when that necessity  is denied them, overcame his mind. Only at the yearly pilgrimage was he  able to gain a hearing from his Meccan brethren, and then, says the  chronicler bitterly, \"none would believe.\" The Hashim could not trade or  intermarry with any outside their clan, and there seemed no chance of  circumstances removing their disabilities. Mahomet's hopes of embracing  all Mecca in his faith wavered and fled, until it seemed as if Allah no  longer protected his chosen.    But after two years of negation and impotence, an end to the persecution  of the Muslim was in sight, and in 619 the ban was removed. Legend has it  that when the chiefs of the Kaaba went to look upon the document they  found it devoured by ants, and took this as a sign of the displeasure of  their gods. The ban was thus removed by supernatural agency when its  prolongation would have meant final disaster for Mahomet. In the light of  later knowledge it is evident that the removal of the ban was the result  of the exertions of Abu Talib, and it was owing to his high reputation  among the Kureisch that they pardoned his turbulent and blasphemous  nephew. At the end of two years also, the Muslim were considerably  weakened, both in staying powers and reputation. They were now allowed to  go freely in the city, and the immediate prospect seemed certainly  brighter for Mahomet when there fell the greatest blow that could have  afflicted his sensitive spirit.    Khadijah, his companion and sustainer through so many troublous years,  died in 619, having borne with him all his revilings and discouragements,  his source of strength even when there appeared no prospect of the  abatement of his hardships, much less for the success of his cause.  Mahomet's grief was too profound for the passing shadow of it even to  darken the pages of the Kuran. He paid her the compliment of silence; but  her memory was continually with him, even when he had taken many fairer  women to wife. Ayesha, in all the insolence of beauty, scoffed at  Khadijah's age and lack of comeliness:    \"Am I not dearer to thee than she was?\"    \"No, by Allah!\" cried Mahomet; \"for she believed when no one else  believed.\"    It was her strength of character and sweetness of mind that impelled him  to utter the amazing words--amazing for his time and environment,  seventh-century Arabia--\"women are the twin-halves of men.\"    But fortune or Allah had not finished the \"strong affliction\" whereby  Mahomet was forced to cast off from his moorings and venture into strange  and perilous seas. Five weeks after the death of his wife came the death  of his uncle, Abu Talib. If the first had been a catastrophe affecting  his courage and quietude of mind, this was calculated to crush both  himself and his companions. Abu Talib was well loved by Mahomet, who  manifested throughout his life the strongest capacity for friendship. But  more important than the personal grief was the loss of the one man whose  efforts bridged over the widening gulf between himself and the Kureisch.  As such, his death was irreparable damage to Mahomet's safety from their  hostilities.    Abu Lahab, it is true, touched a little by the sorrows crowding so  thickly upon his nephew, protected him for a time, but very soon withdrew  his support and joined the opposition. Ranged against Abu Lahab and Abu  Jahl, with their influential following, and lacking the support hitherto  provided by Abu Talib, Mahomet perceived that a crisis was fast  approaching. His band was too numerous to be ignored or even tolerated by  the Kureisch, but against such odds as Mecca's most powerful citizens,  Mahomet was too wise to attempt to resist. There seemed no other way but  the withdrawal of his little concourse to such place of safety as would  enable them to strengthen themselves and prepare for the inevitable  struggle for supremacy. No more conversions of importance had taken place  since Omar's and Hamza's allegiance to Islam, and now three years  had passed. Mahomet felt increasingly the need for their exodus from the  city of his birth. It is not evident from the chroniclers that he had any  definite political aims whatever when he first considered the plan of  evacuation. His motive was simply to obtain peace in which he might  worship in his own fashion, and win others to worship with him. With this  idea in mind he cast about for a suitable resting-place for his small  flock, and discovered what he imagined his goal in Taif, a village  south-east of Mecca, upon the eastern slopes of Jhebel Kora.    Taif is situated on the fertile side of this mountain range, the side  remote from the sea.

But there came no answer, except the echo of my own voice  sounding hollow and far off down in the vault. So in despair I turned  back to the earth wall below the slab, and scrabbled at it with my  fingers, till my nails were broken and the blood ran out; having all the  while a sure knowledge, like a cord twisted round my head, that no effort  of mine could ever dislodge the great stone. And thus the hours passed,  and I shall not say more here, for the remembrance of that time is still  terrible, and besides, no words could ever set forth the anguish I then  suffered, yet did slumber come sometimes to my help; for even while I was  working at the earth, sheer weariness would overtake me, and I sank on to  the ground and fell asleep.    And still the hours passed, and at last I knew by the glimmer of light  in the tomb above that the sun had risen again, and a maddening thirst  had hold of me. And then I thought of all the barrels piled up in the  vault and of the liquor that they held; and stuck not because 'twas  spirit, for I would scarce have paused to sate that thirst even with  molten lead. So I felt my way down the passage back to the vault, and  recked not of the darkness, nor of Blackbeard and his crew, if only I  could lay my lips to liquor. Thus I groped about the barrels till near  the top of the stack my hand struck on the spile of a keg, and drawing  it, I got my mouth to the hold.    What the liquor was I do not know, but it was not so strong but that I  could swallow it in great gulps and found it less burning than my burning  throat. But when I turned to get back to the passage, I could not find  the outlet, and fumbled round and round until my brain was dizzy, and I  fell senseless to the ground.          CHAPTER 5    THE RESCUE    Shades of the dead, have I not heard your voices  Rise on the night-rolling breath of the gale?--_Byron_      When I came to myself I was lying, not in the outer blackness of the  Mohune vault, not on a floor of sand; but in a bed of sweet clean linen,  and in a little whitewashed room, through the window of which the spring  sunlight streamed. Oh, the blessed sunshine, and how I praised God for  the light! At first I thought I was in my own bed at my aunt's house, and  had dreamed of the vault and the smugglers, and that my being prisoned in  the darkness was but the horror of a nightmare. I was for getting up, but  fell back on my pillow in the effort to rise, with a weakness and sick  languor which I had never known before. And as I sunk down, I felt  something swing about my neck, and putting up my hand, found 'twas  Colonel John Mohune's black locket, and so knew that part at least of  this adventure was no dream.    Then the door opened, and to my wandering thought it seemed that I was  back again in the vault, for in came Elzevir Block. Then I held up my  hands, and cried--    'O Elzevir, save me, save me; I am not come to spy.'    But he, with a kind look on his face, put his hand on my shoulder, and  pushed me gently back, saying--    'Lie still, lad, there is none here will hurt thee, and drink this.'    He held out to me a bowl of steaming broth, that filled the room with a  savour sweeter, ten thousand times, to me than every rose and lily of the  world; yet would not let me drink it at a gulp, but made me sip it with a  spoon like any baby. Thus while I drank, he told me where I was, namely,  in an attic at the Why Not?, but would not say more then, bidding me get  to sleep again, and I should know all afterwards. And so it was ten days  or more before youth and health had their way, and I was strong again;  and all that time Elzevir Block sat by my bed, and nursed me tenderly as  a woman. So piece by piece I learned the story of how they found me.    'Twas Mr. Glennie who first moved to seek me; for when the second day  came that I was not at school, he thought that I was ill, and went to my  aunt's to ask how I did, as was his wont when any ailed. But Aunt Jane  answered him stiffly that she could not say how I did.    'For,' says she, 'he is run off I know not where, but as he makes his  bed, must he lie on't; and if he run away for his pleasure, may stay away  for mine. I have been pestered with this lot too long, and only bore with  him for poor sister Martha's sake; but 'tis after his father that the  graceless lad takes, and thus rewards me.'    With that she bangs the door in the parson's face and off he goes to  Ratsey, but can learn nothing there, and so concludes that I have run  away to sea, and am seeking ship at Poole or Weymouth.    But that same day came Sam Tewkesbury to the Why Not? about nightfall,  and begged a glass of rum, being, as he said, 'all of a shake', and  telling a tale of how he passed the churchyard wall on his return from  work, and in the dusk heard screams and wailing voices, and knew 'twas  Blackbeard piping his lost Mohunes to hunt for treasure. So, though he  saw nothing, he turned tail and never stopped running till he stood at  the inn door. Then, forthwith, Elzevir leaves Sam to drink at the Why  Not? alone, and himself sets off running up the street to call for Master  Ratsey; and they two make straight across the sea-meadows in the dark.    'For as soon as I heard Tewkesbury tell of screams and wailings in the  air, and no one to be seen,' said Elzevir, 'I guessed that some poor soul  had got shut in the vault, and was there crying for his life. And to this  I was not guided by mother wit, but by a surer and a sadder token. Thou  wilt have heard how thirteen years ago a daft body we called Cracky Jones  was found one morning in the churchyard dead. He was gone missing for a  week before, and twice within that week I had sat through the night upon  the hill behind the church, watching to warn the lugger with a flare she  could not put in for the surf upon the beach. And on those nights, the  air being still though a heavy swell was running, I heard thrice or more  a throttled scream come shivering across the meadows from the graveyard.  Yet beyond turning my blood cold for a moment, it gave me little trouble,  for evil tales have hung about the church; and though I did not set much  store by the old yarns of Blackbeard piping up his crew, yet I thought  strange things might well go on among the graves at night. And so I never  budged, nor stirred hand or foot to save a fellow-creature in his agony.    'But when the surf fell enough for the boats to get ashore, and Greening  held a lantern for me to jump down into the passage, after we had got the  side out of the tomb, the first thing the light fell on at the bottom  was a white face turned skyward. I have not forgot that, lad, for 'twas  Cracky Jones lay there, with his face thin and shrunk, yet all the doited  look gone out of it. We tried to force some brandy in his mouth, but he  was stark and dead; with knees drawn up towards his head, so stiff we had  to lift him doubled as he was, and lay him by the churchyard wall for  some of us to find next day. We never knew how he got there, but guessed  that he had hung about the landers some night when they ran a cargo, and  slipped in when the watchman's back was turned. Thus when Sam Tewkesbury  spoke of screams and wailings, and no one to be seen, I knew what 'twas,  but never guessed who might be shut in there, not knowing thou wert gone  amissing. So ran to Ratsey to get his help to slip the side stone off,  for by myself I cannot stir it now, though once I did when I was younger;  and from him learned that thou wert lost, and knew whom we should find  before we got there.'    I shuddered while Elzevir talked, for I thought how Cracky Jones had  perhaps hidden behind the self-same coffin that sheltered me, and how  narrowly I had escaped his fate. And that old story came back into my  mind, how, years ago, there once arose so terrible a cry from the vault  at service-time, that parson and people fled from the church; and I  doubted not now that some other poor soul had got shut in that awful  place, and was then calling for help to those whose fears would not let  them listen.    'There we found thee,' Elzevir went on, 'stretched out on the sand,  senseless and far gone; and there was something in thy face that made me  think of David when he lay stretched out in his last sleep. And so I put  thee on my shoulder and bare thee back, and here thou art in David's  room, and shalt find board and bed with me as long as thou hast mind  to.' We spoke much together during the days when I was getting  stronger, and I grew to like Elzevir well, finding his grimness was but  on the outside, and that never was a kinder man. Indeed, I think that my  being with him did him good; for he felt that there was once more  someone to love him, and his heart went out to me as to his son David.  Never once did he ask me to keep my counsel as to the vault and what I  had seen there, knowing, perhaps, he had no need, for I would have died  rather than tell the secret to any. Only, one day Master Ratsey, who  often came to see me, said--    'John, there is only Elzevir and I who know that you have seen the  inside of our bond-cellar; and 'tis well, for if some of the landers  guessed, they might have ugly ways to stop all chance of prating. So  keep our secret tight, and we'll keep yours, for \"he that refraineth his  lips is wise\".'    I wondered how Master Ratsey could quote Scripture so pat, and yet cheat  the revenue; though, in truth, 'twas thought little sin at Moonfleet to  run a cargo; and, perhaps, he guessed what I was thinking, for he added--    'Not that a Christian man has aught to be ashamed of in landing a cask of  good liquor, for we read that when Israel came out of Egypt, the chosen  people were bid trick their oppressors"]]]
