He himself thought of following to see  what had happened, but it was a very dark night and he did not know the  grounds very well. While trying to find his way to the garden steps he  heard Lord Arthur's cry for help, the tramp of the patrolling  constables' horses, and subsequently the whole scene between Lord  Arthur, the man Higgins, and the constables. When he finally found his  way to the stairs, Lord Arthur was returning in order to send a groom  for police assistance.    \"The witness stuck to his points as he had to his guns at Beckfontein a  year ago; nothing could shake him, and Sir Marmaduke looked triumphantly  across at his opposing colleague.    \"With the gallant Colonel's statements the edifice of the prosecution  certainly began to collapse. You see, there was not a particle of  evidence to show that the accused had met and spoken to the deceased  after the latter's visit at the front door of 'The Elms.' He told Chipps  that he wouldn't see the visitor, and Chipps went into the hall directly  and showed Lavender out the way he came. No assignation could have been  made, no hint could have been given by the murdered man to Lord Arthur  that he would go round to the back entrance and wished to see him there.    \"Two other guests of Lord Arthur's swore positively that after Chipps  had announced the visitor, their host stayed at the card-table until a  quarter to eleven, when evidently he went out to join Colonel McIntosh  in the garden. Sir Marmaduke's speech was clever in the extreme. Bit by  bit he demolished that tower of strength, the case against the accused,  basing his defence entirely upon the evidence of Lord Arthur  Skelmerton's guests that night.    \"Until 10.45 Lord Arthur was playing cards; a quarter of an hour later  the police were on the scene, and the murder had been committed. In the  meanwhile Colonel McIntosh's evidence proved conclusively that the  accused had been sitting with him, smoking a cigar. It was obvious,  therefore, clear as daylight, concluded the great lawyer, that his  client was entitled to a full discharge; nay, more, he thought that the  police should have been more careful before they harrowed up public  feeling by arresting a high-born gentleman on such insufficient evidence  as they had brought forward.    \"The question of the knife remained certainly, but Sir Marmaduke passed  over it with guarded eloquence, placing that strange question in the  category of those inexplicable coincidences which tend to puzzle the  ablest detectives, and cause them to commit such unpardonable blunders  as the present one had been. After all, the footman may have been  mistaken. The pattern of that knife was not an exclusive one, and he, on  behalf of his client, flatly denied that it had ever belonged to him.    \"Well,\" continued the man in the corner, with the chuckle peculiar to  him in moments of excitement, \"the noble prisoner was discharged.  Perhaps it would be invidious to say that he left the court without a  stain on his character, for I daresay you know from experience that the  crime known as the York Mystery has never been satisfactorily cleared  up.    \"Many people shook their heads dubiously when they remembered that,  after all, Charles Lavender was killed with a knife which one witness  had sworn belonged to Lord Arthur; others, again, reverted to the  original theory that George Higgins was the murderer, that he and James  Terry had concocted the story of Lavender's attempt at blackmail on Lord  Arthur, and that the murder had been committed for the sole purpose of  robbery.    \"Be that as it may, the police have not so far been able to collect  sufficient evidence against Higgins or Terry, and the crime has been  classed by press and public alike in the category of so-called  impenetrable mysteries.\"          CHAPTER IX    A BROKEN-HEARTED WOMAN      The man in the corner called for another glass of milk, and drank it  down slowly before he resumed:    \"Now Lord Arthur lives mostly abroad,\" he said. \"His poor, suffering  wife died the day after he was liberated by the magistrate. She never  recovered consciousness even sufficiently to hear the joyful news that  the man she loved so well was innocent after all.    \"Mystery!\" he added as if in answer to Polly's own thoughts. \"The murder  of that man was never a mystery to me. I cannot understand how the  police could have been so blind when every one of the witnesses, both  for the prosecution and defence, practically pointed all the time to the  one guilty person. What do you think of it all yourself?\"    \"I think the whole case so bewildering,\" she replied, \"that I do not see  one single clear point in it.\"    \"You don't?\" he said excitedly, while the bony fingers fidgeted again  with that inevitable bit of string. \"You don't see that there is one  point clear which to me was the key of the whole thing?    \"Lavender was murdered, wasn't he? Lord Arthur did not kill him. He had,  at least, in Colonel McIntosh an unimpeachable witness to prove that he  could not have committed that murder--and yet,\" he added with slow,  excited emphasis, marking each sentence with a knot, \"and yet he  deliberately tries to throw the guilt upon a man who obviously was also  innocent. Now why?\"    \"He may have thought him guilty.\"    \"Or wished to shield or cover the retreat of _one he knew to be  guilty_.\"    \"I don't understand.\"    \"Think of someone,\" he said excitedly, \"someone whose desire would be as  great as that of Lord Arthur to silence a scandal round that gentleman's  name. Someone who, unknown perhaps to Lord Arthur, had overheard the  same conversation which George Higgins related to the police and the  magistrate, someone who, whilst Chipps was taking Lavender's card in to  his master, had a few minutes' time wherein to make an assignation with  Lavender, promising him money, no doubt, in exchange for the  compromising bills.\"    \"Surely you don't mean--\" gasped Polly.    \"Point number one,\" he interrupted quietly, \"utterly missed by the  police. George Higgins in his deposition stated that at the most  animated stage of Lavender's conversation with Lord Arthur, and when the  bookmaker's tone of voice became loud and threatening, a voice from the  top of the steps interrupted that conversation, saying: 'Your tea is  getting cold.'\"    \"Yes--but--\" she argued.    \"Wait a moment, for there is point number two. That voice was a lady's  voice. Now, I did exactly what the police should have done, but did not  do. I went to have a look from the racecourse side at those garden steps  which to my mind are such important factors in the discovery of this  crime. I found only about a dozen rather low steps; anyone standing on  the top must have heard every word Charles Lavender uttered the moment  he raised his voice.\"    \"Even then--\"    \"Very well, you grant that,\" he said excitedly. \"Then there was the  great, the all-important point which, oddly enough, the prosecution  never for a moment took into consideration. When Chipps, the footman,  first told Lavender that Lord Arthur could not see him the bookmaker was  terribly put out; Chipps then goes to speak to his master; a few minutes  elapse, and when the footman once again tells Lavender that his lordship  won't see him, the latter says 'Very well,' and seems to treat the  matter with complete indifference.    \"Obviously, therefore, something must have happened in between to alter  the bookmaker's frame of mind. Well! What had happened? Think over all  the evidence, and you will see that one thing only had occurred in the  interval, namely, Lady Arthur's advent into the room.    \"In order to go into the smoking-room she must have crossed the hall;  she must have seen Lavender. In that brief interval she must have  realized that the man was persistent, and therefore a living danger to  her husband. Remember, women have done strange things; they are a far  greater puzzle to the student of human nature than the sterner, less  complex sex has ever been. As I argued before--as the police should have  argued all along--why did Lord Arthur deliberately accuse an innocent  man of murder if not to shield the guilty one?    \"Remember, Lady Arthur may have been discovered; the man, George  Higgins, may have caught sight of her before she had time to make good  her retreat. His attention, as well us that of the constables, had to be  diverted. Lord Arthur acted on the blind impulse of saving his wife at  any cost.\"    \"She may have been met by Colonel McIntosh,\" argued Polly.    \"Perhaps she was,\" he said. \"Who knows? The gallant colonel had to  swear to his friend's innocence. He could do that in all  conscience--after that his duty was accomplished. No innocent man was  suffering for the guilty. The knife which had belonged to Lord Arthur  would always save George Higgins. For a time it had pointed to the  husband; fortunately never to the wife. Poor thing, she died probably of  a broken heart, but women when they love, think only of one object on  earth--the one who is beloved.    \"To me the whole thing was clear from the very first. When I read the  account of the murder--the knife! stabbing!--bah! Don't I know enough of  _English_ crime not to be certain at once that no English_man_, be he  ruffian from the gutter or be he Duke's son, ever stabs his victim in  the back. Italians, French, Spaniards do it, if you will, and women of  most nations. An Englishman's instinct is to strike and not to stab.  George Higgins or Lord Arthur Skelmerton would have knocked their victim  down; the woman only would lie in wait till the enemy's back was turned.  She knows her weakness, and she does not mean to miss.    \"Think it over. There is not one flaw in my argument, but the police  never thought"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10574"],[0,"The History of England, Volume I (#11)"],[1,"2]    Augustine, on his arrival in Kent, in the year 597 [n] found the  danger much less than he had apprehended.  Ethelbert, already well  disposed towards the Christian faith, assigned him a habitation in the  Isle of Thanet, and soon after admitted him to a conference.  Apprehensive, however, lest spells or enchantments might be employed  against him by priests, who brought an unknown worship from a distant  country, he had the precaution to receive them in the open air, where  he believed the force of their magic would be more easily dissipated  [o].  Here Augustine, by means of his interpreters, delivered to him  the tenets of the Christian faith, and promised him eternal joys  above, and a kingdom in  heaven, without end, if he would be persuaded  to receive that salutary doctrine [p].  \"Your words and promises,\"  replied Ethelbert, \"are fair; but because they are new and uncertain,  I cannot entirely yield to them, and relinquish the principles which I  and my ancestors have so long maintained.  You are welcome, however,  to remain here in peace; and as you have undertaken so long a journey,  solely, as it appears, for what you believe to be for our advantage, I  will supply you with all necessaries, and permit you to deliver your  doctrine to my subjects [q]\"  [FN [n] Higden. Polychron. lib. 5.  Chron. Sax. p. 23.  [o] Bede, lib.  I. cap. 2  Hunting. lib. 3.  Brompton, p. 729  Parker Antiq. Brit.  Eccl. p. 61. [p] Bede, lib. 1. cap 25.  Chron. W. Thorn. p. 1759.  [q]  Bede, lib. 1. cap 25.  H. Hunting. lib. 3.  Brompton, p. 729]    Augustine, encouraged by this favourable reception, and seeing now a  prospect of success, proceeded with redoubled zeal to preach the  gospel to the Kentish Saxons.  He attracted their attention by the  austerity of his manners, by the severe penances to which he subjected  himself, by the abstinence and self-denial which he practised: and  having excited their wonder by a course of life which appeared so  contrary to nature, he procured more easily their belief of miracles,  which, it was pretended, he wrought for their conversion [r].  Influenced by these motives, and by the declared favour of the court,  numbers of the Kentish men were baptized; and the king himself was  persuaded to submit to that rite of Christianity.  His example had  great influence with his subjects; but he employed no force to bring  them over to the new doctrine.  Augustine thought proper, in the  commencement of his mission, to assume the appearance of the greatest  lenity.  He told Ethelbert that the service of Christ must be entirely  voluntary, and that no violence ought ever to be used in propagating  so salutary a doctrine [s].  [FN [r] Bede, lib. 1. cap 26.  [s] Ibid. lib. 1. cap 26.  H. Hunting.  lib. 3.]    The intelligence received of these spiritual conquests afforded great  joy to the Romans; who now exulted as much in those peaceful trophies,  as their ancestors had ever done in their most sanguinary triumphs,  and most splendid victories.  Gregory wrote a letter to Ethelbert, in  which, after informing him that the end of the world was approaching,  he exhorted him to display his zeal in the conversion of his subjects,  to exert rigour against the worship of idols, and to build up the good  work of holiness by every expedient of exhortation, terror,  blandishment, or correction [t]: a doctrine more suitable to that age,  and to the usual papal maxims, than the tolerating principles which  Augustine had thought it prudent to inculcate.  The pontiff also  answered some questions which the missionary had put concerning the  government of the new church of Kent.  Besides other queries which it  is not material here to relate, Augustine asked, WHETHER COUSIN-  GERMANS MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO MARRY? Gregory answered, that that liberty  had indeed been formerly granted by the Roman law; but that experience  had shown, that no issue could ever come from such marriages; and he  therefore prohibited them.  Augustine, WHETHER A WOMAN PREGNANT MIGHT  BE BAPTIZED?  Gregory answered that he saw no objection.  HOW SOON  AFTER THE BIRTH THE CHILD MIGHT RECEIVE BAPTISM?  It was answered,  Immediately, if necessary.  HOW SOON A HUSBAND MIGHT HAVE COMMERCE  WITH HIS WIFE AFTER HER DELIVERY?  Not till she had given suck to her  child: a practice to which Gregory exhorts all women.  HOW SOON A MAN  MIGHT ENTER THE CHURCH, OR RECEIVE THE SACRAMENT, AFTER HAVING HAD  COMMERCE WITH HIS WIFE?  It was replied, that unless he had approached  her without desire, merely for the sake of propagating his species, he  was not without sin: but in all cases it was requisite for him, before  he entered the church, or communicated, to purge himself by prayer and  ablution; and he ought not, even after using these precautions, to  participate immediately of the sacred duties [u].  There are some  other questions and replies still more indecent and more ridiculous  [w].  And on the whole, it appears that Gregory and his missionary, if  sympathy of manners have any influence, were better calculated than  men of more refined understanding for making a progress with the  ignorant and barbarous Saxons.  [FN [t] Bede, lib. 1. cap. 32.  Brompton, p. 732.  Spell. Conc. p. 86.  [u] Bede, lib. 1. cap. 27.  Spell. Conc. p. 97, 98, 99, &c.  [w]  Augustine asks, Si mulier menstrua consuetudine tenetur, an ecclesiam  intrare ei licet, aut sacrae communionis sacramenta percipere?  Gregory answers, Sanctae communionis mysterium in eisdem diebus  percipere non debit prohiberi.  Si autem ex veneratione magna  precipere non praesumitur, laudanda est.  Augustine asks, Si post  illusionem, quae per somnum solet accidere, vel corpus Domine quilibet  accipere valeat; vel, si sacerdos sit, sacra mysteria celebrare.  Gregory answers this learned question by many learned distinctions.]    The more to facilitate the reception of Christianity Gregory enjoined  Augustine to remove the idols from the heathen altars, but not to  destroy the altars themselves; because the people, he said, would be  allured to frequent the Christian worship, when they found it  celebrated in a place which they were accustomed to revere.  And as  the Pagans practised sacrifices, and feasted with the priests on their  offerings, he also exhorted the missionary to persuade them, on  Christian festivals, to kill their cattle in the neighbourhood of the  church, and to indulge themselves in those cheerful entertainments, to  which they had been habituated [x].  These political compliances show,  that notwithstanding his ignorance and prejudices, he was not  unacquainted with the arts of governing mankind.  Augustine was  consecrated archbishop of Canterbury, was endowed by Gregory with  authority over all the British churches, and received the pall, a  badge of ecclesiastical honour, from Rome [y].  Gregory also advised  him not to be too much elated with his gift of working miracles [z];  and as Augustine, proud of the success of his mission, seemed to think  himself entitled to extend his authority over the bishops of Gaul, the  pope informed him, that they lay entirely without the bounds of his  jurisdiction [a].

Ethelbert also enacted [c],  with the consent of the states of his kingdom, a body of laws, the  first written laws promulgated by any of the northern conquerors; and  his reign was in every respect glorious to himself, and beneficial to  his people.  He governed the kingdom of Kent fifty years, and dying in  616, left the succession to his son, Eadbald.  This prince, seduced by  a passion for his mother-in-law, deserted for some time the Christian  faith, which permitted not these incestuous marriages: his whole  people immediately returned with him to idolatry.  Laurentius, the  successor of Augustine, found the Christian worship wholly abandoned,  and was prepared to return to France, in order to escape the  mortification of preaching the gospel without fruit to the infidels.  Melitus and Justus, who had been consecrated Bishops of London and  Rochester, had already departed the kingdom [d], when, Laurentius,  before he should entirely abandon his dignity, made one effort to  reclaim the king.  He appeared before that prince, and, throwing off  his vestments, showed his body all torn with bruises and stripes,  which he had received.  Eadbald, wondering that any man should have  dared to treat in that manner a person of his rank, was told by  Laurentius, that he had received this chastisement from St. Peter, the  prince of the Apostles, who had appeared to him in a vision, and,  severely reproving him for his intention to desert his charge, had  inflicted on him these visible marks of his displeasure [e].  Whether  Eadbald was struck with the miracle, or influenced by some other  motive, he divorced himself from his mother-in-law, and returned to  the profession of Christianity [f]: his whole people returned with  him.  Eadbald reached not the fame or authority of his father, and  died in 640, after a reign of twenty-five years, leaving two sons,  Erminfred and Ercombert.  [FN [b] Will. Malm. p.10.
