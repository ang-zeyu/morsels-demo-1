It was difficult for him to force a  smile. But he achieved one.    \"Oh, better take me off at once,\" she said. \"Save me without risking so  much--without making love to Mrs. Bland!\"    \"Surely, if I can. There! I see Euchre coming with a woman.\"    \"That's her. Oh, she mustn't see me with you.\"    \"Wait--a moment,\" whispered Duane, as Jennie slipped indoors. \"We've  settled it. Don't forget. I'll find some way to get word to you, perhaps  through Euchre. Meanwhile keep up your courage. Remember I'll save you  somehow. We'll try strategy first. Whatever you see or hear me do, don't  think less of me--\"    Jennie checked him with a gesture and a wonderful gray flash of eyes.    \"I'll bless you with every drop of blood in my heart,\" she whispered,  passionately.    It was only as she turned away into the room that Duane saw she was lame  and that she wore Mexican sandals over bare feet.    He sat down upon a bench on the porch and directed his attention to the  approaching couple. The trees of the grove were thick enough for him to  make reasonably sure that Mrs. Bland had not seen him talking to Jennie.  When the outlaw's wife drew near Duane saw that she was a tall,  strong, full-bodied woman, rather good-looking with a fullblown, bold  attractiveness. Duane was more concerned with her expression than with  her good looks; and as she appeared unsuspicious he felt relieved. The  situation then took on a singular zest.    Euchre came up on the porch and awkwardly introduced Duane to Mrs.  Bland. She was young, probably not over twenty-five, and not quite so  prepossessing at close range. Her eyes were large, rather prominent, and  brown in color. Her mouth, too, was large, with the lips full, and she  had white teeth.    Duane took her proffered hand and remarked frankly that he was glad to  meet her.    Mrs. Bland appeared pleased; and her laugh, which followed, was loud and  rather musical.    \"Mr. Duane--Buck Duane, Euchre said, didn't he?\" she asked.    \"Buckley,\" corrected Duane. \"The nickname's not of my choosing.\"    \"I'm certainly glad to meet you, Buckley Duane,\" she said, as she took  the seat Duane offered her. \"Sorry to have been out. Kid Fuller's lying  over at Deger's. You know he was shot last night. He's got fever to-day.  When Bland's away I have to nurse all these shot-up boys, and it  sure takes my time. Have you been waiting here alone? Didn't see that  slattern girl of mine?\"    She gave him a sharp glance. The woman had an extraordinary play of  feature, Duane thought, and unless she was smiling was not pretty at  all.    \"I've been alone,\" replied Duane. \"Haven't seen anybody but a  sick-looking girl with a bucket. And she ran when she saw me.\"    \"That was Jen,\" said Mrs. Bland. \"She's the kid we keep here, and she  sure hardly pays her keep. Did Euchre tell you about her?\"    \"Now that I think of it, he did say something or other.\"    \"What did he tell you about me?\" bluntly asked Mrs. Bland.    \"Wal, Kate,\" replied Euchre, speaking for himself, \"you needn't worry  none, for I told Buck nothin' but compliments.\"    Evidently the outlaw's wife liked Euchre, for her keen glance rested  with amusement upon him.    \"As for Jen, I'll tell you her story some day,\" went on the woman. \"It's  a common enough story along this river. Euchre here is a tender-hearted  old fool, and Jen has taken him in.\"    \"Wal, seein' as you've got me figgered correct,\" replied Euchre, dryly,  \"I'll go in an' talk to Jennie if I may.\"    \"Certainly. Go ahead. Jen calls you her best friend,\" said Mrs. Bland,  amiably. \"You're always fetching some Mexican stuff, and that's why, I  guess.\"    When Euchre had shuffled into the house Mrs. Bland turned to Duane with  curiosity and interest in her gaze.    \"Bland told me about you.\"    \"What did he say?\" queried Duane, in pretended alarm.    \"Oh, you needn't think he's done you dirt Bland's not that kind of a  man. He said: 'Kate, there's a young fellow in camp--rode in here on the  dodge. He's no criminal, and he refused to join my band. Wish he would.  Slickest hand with a gun I've seen for many a day! I'd like to see him  and Chess meet out there in the road.' Then Bland went on to tell how  you and Bosomer came together.\"    \"What did you say?\" inquired Duane, as she paused.    \"Me? Why, I asked him what you looked like,\" she replied, gayly.    \"Well?\" went on Duane.    \"Magnificent chap, Bland said. Bigger than any man in the valley. Just a  great blue-eyed sunburned boy!\"    \"Humph!\" exclaimed Duane. \"I'm sorry he led you to expect somebody worth  seeing.\"    \"But I'm not disappointed,\" she returned, archly. \"Duane, are you going  to stay long here in camp?\"    \"Yes, till I run out of money and have to move. Why?\"    Mrs. Bland's face underwent one of the singular changes. The smiles and  flushes and glances, all that had been coquettish about her, had lent  her a certain attractiveness, almost beauty and youth. But with some  powerful emotion she changed and instantly became a woman of discontent,  Duane imagined, of deep, violent nature.    \"I'll tell you, Duane,\" she said, earnestly, \"I'm sure glad if you mean  to bide here awhile. I'm a miserable woman, Duane. I'm an outlaw's wife,  and I hate him and the life I have to lead. I come of a good family in  Brownsville. I never knew Bland was an outlaw till long after he married  me. We were separated at times, and I imagined he was away on business.  But the truth came out. Bland shot my own cousin, who told me. My family  cast me off, and I had to flee with Bland. I was only eighteen then.  I've lived here since. I never see a decent woman or man. I never hear  anything about my old home or folks or friends. I'm buried here--buried  alive with a lot of thieves and murderers. Can you blame me for being  glad to see a young fellow--a gentleman--like the boys I used to go  with? I tell you it makes me feel full--I want to cry. I'm sick for  somebody to talk to. I have no children, thank God! If I had I'd not  stay here. I'm sick of this hole. I'm lonely--\"    There appeared to be no doubt about the truth of all this. Genuine  emotion checked, then halted the hurried speech. She broke down and  cried. It seemed strange to Duane that an outlaw's wife--and a woman  who fitted her consort and the wild nature of their surroundings--should  have weakness enough to weep. Duane believed and pitied her.    \"I'm sorry for you,\" he said.    \"Don't be SORRY for me,\" she said. \"That only makes me see the--the  difference between you and me. And don't pay any attention to what these  outlaws say about me. They're ignorant. They couldn't understand me.  You'll hear that Bland killed men who ran after me. But that's a lie.  Bland, like all the other outlaws along this river, is always looking  for somebody to kill. He SWEARS not, but I don't believe him. He  explains that gunplay gravitates to men who are the real thing--that it  is provoked by the four-flushes, the bad men. I don't know. All I know  is that somebody is being killed every other day. He hated Spence before  Spence ever saw me.\"    \"Would Bland object if I called on you occasionally?\" inquired Duane.    \"No, he wouldn't. He likes me to have friends. Ask him yourself when he  comes back. The trouble has been that two or three of his men fell in  love with me, and when half drunk got to fighting. You're not going to  do that.\"    \"I'm not going to get half drunk, that's certain,\" replied Duane.    He was surprised to see her eyes dilate, then glow with fire. Before  she could reply Euchre returned to the porch, and that put an end to the  conversation.    Duane was content to let the matter rest there, and had little more to  say. Euchre and Mrs. Bland talked and joked, while Duane listened.  He tried to form some estimate of her character. Manifestly she had  suffered a wrong, if not worse, at Bland's hands. She was bitter,  morbid, overemotional. If she was a liar, which seemed likely enough,  she was a frank one, and believed herself. She had no cunning. The thing  which struck Duane so forcibly was that she thirsted for respect.  In that, better than in her weakness of vanity, he thought he had  discovered a trait through which he could manage her.    Once, while he was revolving these thoughts, he happened to glance into  the house, and deep in the shadow of a corner he caught a pale gleam  of Jennie's face with great, staring eyes on him. She had been watching  him, listening to what he said. He saw from her expression that she had  realized what had been so hard for her to believe. Watching his chance,  he flashed a look at her; and then it seemed to him the change in her  face was wonderful.    Later, after he had left Mrs. Bland with a meaning \"Adios--manana,\" and  was walking along beside the old outlaw, he found himself thinking of  the girl instead of the woman, and of how he had seen her face blaze  with hope and gratitude.        CHAPTER VII    That night Duane was not troubled by ghosts haunting his waking and  sleeping hours. He awoke feeling bright and eager, and grateful to  Euchre for having put something worth while into his mind. During  breakfast, however, he was unusually thoughtful, working over the idea  of how much or how little he would confide in the outlaw. He was aware  of Euchre's scrutiny.    \"Wal,\" began the old man, at last, \"how'd you make out with the kid?\"    \"Kid?\" inquired Duane, tentatively.    \"Jennie, I mean. What'd you An' she talk about?\"    \"We had a little chat. You know you wanted me to cheer her up.\"    Euchre sat with coffee-cup poised and narrow eyes studying Duane.    \"Reckon you cheered her, all right. What I'm afeared of is mebbe you  done the job too well.\"    \"How so?\"    \"Wal, when I went in to Jen last night I thought she was half crazy.  She was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10317"],[0,"Betty Gordon at Boarding School; Or, The Treasure of Indian Chasm (#11)"],[1," magic of that modulated voice, low and yet clear  enough to be heard in every corner of the large room. Surely this lovely  woman could teach them the secret of cultivated, dignified and happy  young womanhood.    The principal spoke to them briefly of her ideals for them, explained the  few rigid rules of the school, and asked that all exercise tact and  patience for the first week during which the rough edges of new  schedules might reasonably be expected to wear off.    \"I want to have a little personal talk with each one of you,\" she  concluded. \"Your corridor teachers will consult with me and will tell you  when you are to come to me. And I hope you are to be very, very happy  here with us at Shadyside.\"    A soft clapping of hands followed this speech, and Mrs. Eustice stepped  down from the platform to be instantly surrounded by the girls who had  spent other terms at the school.    After the older girls had spoken to the principal, the newcomers began to  move forward. They were presented by their corridor teachers, who seemed  to possess a special faculty to remember names, and here and there Mrs.  Eustice recognized a girl through the association of ideas.    As Miss Lacey swept her girls forward, Ada Nansen and Ruth Gladys Royal  happened to head the ranks. Mrs. Eustice put out her hand to Ada, then  gazed down at her in evident astonishment.          CHAPTER XII    THE LOST TREASURE      \"Diamonds,\" whispered Betty to Norma Guerin, who seemed depressed. \"She  wears three diamond rings and one sapphire and a square-cut emerald. And  her wrist-watch is platinum set with diamonds.\"    Mrs. Eustice gazed at the soft little hand she held for a few moments,  then released it. She said nothing.    \"Ah, your mother wrote me of you,\" was the principal's greeting to the  Littell girls. \"You look like her, Louise. And Bobby is much like her  father as I remember him.\"    \"This is Betty Gordon,\" said the loyal Bobby, indicating her chum.  \"Mother wrote about her, too, didn't she?\"    \"Indeed she did,\" assented Mrs. Eustice warmly. \"I must have a special  talk with Betty soon, for she has an ambitious program before her. And  here are Libbie and Frances from the state I remember so affectionately  from girlhood visits there.\"    But it was Norma and Alice Guerin, sensitive Norma and shy Alice, who  were welcomed most cordially after all.    \"So you are Elsie Guerin's daughters!\" said the principal, putting an  arm around Norma and holding her hand out to Alice. \"My own dear mother  taught your mother when she was a little girl with braids like yours.  And your dear grandmother used to give the most wonderful parties.  People talk about them to this day. It was at her Rose Ball I first met  my husband. You must go up the north road some day and see the old  Macklin house.\"    Norma and Alice fairly glowed as they went back to their rooms with the  other girls. Ada Nansen had heard, and she was regarding them with  evident respect.    Norma and Alice might have been uneasy had they heard Ada's comment when  she and Ruth were once more in their own rooms.    \"They must have money,\" argued Ada, \"though I never saw such ordinary  clothes. Giving balls and parties in the lavish Southern style costs,  let me tell you. Probably they have some fine family jewels in that  shabby trunk.\"    \"I'll tell you what I think,\" said Ruth Gladys wisely. \"I think the money  is all used up. Probably they're here as charity pupils for old  friendship's sake.\"    This speculation was duly stored up in Ada Nansen's mind to be brought  out when needed.    After dinner Miss Anderson played for them to dance in the broad hall,  but every one was tired from train journeys, and at nine o'clock they  voluntarily sought their rooms.    \"Get into a kimono and brush your hair in here,\" hospitably suggested  Betty, and Bobby seconded her by flinging the suitcases under the beds.  All of the rooms were fitted with pretty day-beds so that a cover quickly  transformed them into couches and the bedrooms into sitting rooms.    Four gay-colored kimono-wrapped figures came pattering in presently and  curled up comfortably on the beds. Norma and Alice were the last to  arrive, and when they did come they mystified their friends by prancing  in silently and waltzing gaily about the room.    \"Oh, girls!\" they chortled when they had tired of this performance, \"what  do you think?\"    \"We couldn't help hearing,\" said Norma deprecatingly.    \"Laura Bennett called us in,\" declared Alice.    \"Don't sing a duet,\" commanded Bobby sternly. \"What are you talking  about? One at a time. You tell, Norma.\"    \"Laura Bennett called us into her room,\" obediently recited Norma. \"Miss  Lacey was talking to Ada and Ruth. You could hear every word without  listening--that is without eavesdropping--you know what I mean. Mrs.  Eustice must have spoken to Miss Lacey, because she told the girls they  would have to send all the trunks home except one apiece. Ada must put  all her jewelry in the school safe and at the Christmas holidays she is  to take it home and leave it there. Both of them have to wear their hair  down or in a knot--you know they have it waved now and done up just like  my mother's. And Miss Lacey is to go over their clothes to-morrow and  tell 'em what they can keep!\"    \"I'm glad some one has some sense!\" was Bobby's terse comment.    Something in Norma's face told Betty that she would like to speak to her  alone, so half an hour later when the girls had dispersed for the night,  she made a bent nail file an excuse to go to the Guerins' room.    \"I was hoping you'd come, Betty,\" said Norma gratefully. \"We have to put  out the lights at ten, don't we? I'll try to talk fast. You see, Alice  and I want to tell you something.\"    A fleecy old-fashioned shawl lay across the bed and Norma flung this  about Betty's shoulders.    \"Alice's kimono is flannel and so is mine,\" she explained in answer to  the protest. \"You never met Grandma Macklin, did you, Betty?\"    \"No-o, I'm sure I never did,\" responded Betty thoughtfully. \"Does she  live with you?\"    \"Yes. But while you were at the Peabodys she was visiting her half-sister  in Georgia,\" explained Norma. \"She is mother's mother, you know.\"    \"What was it Mrs. Eustice said about her?\" questioned Betty with  interest. \"Did she live near here? Was that when your mother went to  this school?\"    \"It was a day school then, you know,\" put in the laconic Alice.    \"Yes, and grandma lived in a perfectly wonderful big house,\" said Norma.  \"It must be fully five miles from here. Uncle Goliath, an old colored  man, used to drive her over every day and call for her in the afternoon.  Mother has always been determined Alice and I should graduate from  Shadyside.\"    \"Well then, it's lovely she is to have her wish,\" commented Betty  brightly.    \"Oh, goodness, I don't see that we're ever going to have four years,\"  confessed Norma. \"If you knew what they've given up at home to send us  for this term! And though we wouldn't say anything, mother and grandma  worked so hard to get us ready, Alice and I are positively ashamed of our  clothes. You see, Betty, I think when you're poor, you ought to go where  you'll meet other poor girls. Alice and I ought to have entered the  Glenside high school, I think. But when I said something like that to dad  he said it would break mother's heart. But if she knew how hard it was to  be poor and to have to rub elbows with girls who have everything--\"    \"I don't think you ought to feel that way,\" urged Betty. \"You have  something that no amount of money could buy for you, and no lack can take  away--birth and breeding. And the training your mother wants you to have  is worth sacrificing other things for. Ever since I heard Mrs. Eustice  talk I feel that I know what makes her school really successful.\"    A soft tap fell on the door.    \"Lights go off in ten minutes, girls,\" said Miss Lacey pleasantly.    \"Do you know, Betty,\" confessed Norma hurriedly, \"dad has lost quite a  lot of money lately. He's such a dear he never can bear to press  payment of a bill and half the county owes him. And a friend got him to  invest what he did have in some silly stock that never amounted to a  hill of beans, as the farmers say. So it's no wonder the Macklin  fortune worries mother whenever she thinks of it; a family like ours  could use money so easily.\"    \"Most families are like that,\" said Betty, with a flash of Uncle Dick's  humor. \"I didn't like to ask, Norma, but your grandmother must have  been wealthy.\"    \"She was,\" confirmed Norma. \"Not fabulously so, of course. But even in  those days when lavish hospitality was common Grandma Macklin was famous  for the way she ran the estate. She was left a widow when a very young  woman, and mother was her only child. Her husband didn't believe women  knew very much about money, and he left his fortune mostly in bonds and  jewels--the most magnificent diamonds in three counties, grandma says  hers were. And she had a rope of emeralds and two strings of exquisitely  matched pearls. Besides, there were rose topazes and lovely cameos and  oh, goodness, I couldn't repeat the list; Alice and I have been brought  up on the story.    \"Well, about the time mother had finished school, Grandma Macklin came to  the end of her bank account. Several mortgages had been paid her in gold,  and she kept this money with the jewelry and a lot of solid silver in a  little safe in her room. Foolish, of course, but she says others did it  in those days, too. She meant to take the gold and some of the diamonds  to her lawyer and get a check which would take her and mother around the  world on a luxurious cruise. And the day before she had the appointment  with Mr. Davies--\"    A soft blackness settled down over the girls like a blanket. The  electric lights had gone out!    \"Move closer, and I'll finish,\" whispered Norma.    Betty snuggled up between the two, and shivered a little "]]]
