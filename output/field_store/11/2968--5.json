Dere warn't no fussin' and fightin' and foolin' 'round on de way home,  'cause dat white teacher 'lowed he had control of us 'til us got to our  Mammies' doors and if us didn't git for home in a hurry, it was jus' too  bad for us when he tuk it out on us next day wid dat long hick'ry  switch.    \"Things is sho' diffunt now. Folks ain't good now as dey was den, but  dere is gwine to be a change. I may not be here to see it, but it's  a-comin' 'cause de Good Lord is done 'sied (prophesied) it, and it's got  to be. God's sayin' is comin' to pass jus' as sho' as us is livin' and  settin' in de shade of dis here tree.    \"Lordy, Miss! How come you axes 'bout colored folks'es weddin's? I was  a-courtin' a little 14-year old gal named Lovie Williams, but her Mammy  runned me off and said she warn't gwine to let Lovie git married up wid  nobody 'til she got big enough. I jus' bought dem licenses and watched  for my chanct and den I stole dat gal right from under her Mammy's eyes.  My Mammy knowed all 'bout it and holped us git away. Us didn't have no  time for no weddin'. De best us could do was jus' to git ourselfs  married up. Lovie's Mammy raised de Old Ned, but us didn't keer den,  'cause it was too late for her to do nothin' to part us. Lovie was one  of the bestest gals what ever lived. Us raised 12 chillun and I never  had one speck of trouble wid her. Lovie's done been daid 15 years now.\"    His voice trembled as he talked about his first wife, and Lula almost  stopped her work to listen. This kind of talk did not please her and her  expression grew stern. \"You done talked a-plenty,\" she told him. \"You  ain't strong 'nough to do no more talkin',\" but Jasper was not willing  to be silenced. \"I reckon I knows when I'se tired. I ain't gwine to hush  'til I gits good and ready,\" was his protest. \"Yes Missy,\" he continued.  \"All our chillun is done daid now 'cept four and dey is 'way off up  North. Ain't nobody left here 'cept me and Lula. Lula is pow'ful good to  me. I done got too old to wuk, and can't do nothin' nohow wid dis old  foot so bad off. I'se ready and even anxious to go when de Good Lord  calls for old Jasper to come to de Heav'nly Home.    \"I ain't heared nothin' from my only brother in over 7 years. I 'spose  he still lives in Crawfordville. Missy, I wishes I could go back down to  Crawfordville one more time. I kin jus' see our old homeplace on de  plantation down dar now. Lula a-washin' here, makes me study 'bout de  old washplace on Marse Henry's plantation. Dere was a long bench full of  old wood tubs, and a great big iron pot for bilin' de clothes, and de  batten block and stick. Chillun beat de clothes wid de batten stick and  kept up de fire 'round de pot whilst de 'omans leaned over de tubs  washin' and a-singin' dem old songs. You could hear 'em 'most a mile  away. Now and den one of de 'omans would stop singin' long enough to  yell at de chillun to 'git more wood on dat fire 'fore I lash de skin  offen your back.'    \"Oh Missy, dem was good old days. Us would be lucky to have 'em back  again, 'specially when harvest time comes 'round. You could hear Niggers  a-singin' in de fields 'cause dey didn't have no worries lak dey got  now. When us got de corn up from de fields, Niggers come from far and  nigh to Marster's cornshuckin'. Dat cornshuckin' wuk was easy wid  evvybody singin' and havin' a good time together whilst dey made dem  shucks fly. De cornshuckin' captain led all de singin' and he set right  up on top of de highes' pile of corn. De chillun was kept busy a-passin'  de liquor jug 'round. Atter it started gittin' dark, Marster had big  bonfires built up and plenty of torches set 'round so as dere would be  plenty of light. Atter dey et all dey wanted of dem good things what had  done been cooked up for de big supper, den de wrastlin' matches started,  and Marster allus give prizes to de best wrastlers. Dere warn't no  fussin' and fightin' 'lowed on our place, and dem wrastlin' matches was  all in good humor and was kept orderly. Marster wanted evvybody to be  friends on our plantation and to stay dat way, for says he: 'De Blessed  Saviour done said for us to love our neighbor as ourselfs, and to give  and what us gives is gwine to come back to us.' Missy, de Good Lord's  word is always right.\"    The interviewer was preparing to leave when one of Jasper's old friends  approached the sheltering tree in the yard, where the interview was  drawing to a close. \"Brudder Paul,\" said Jasper, \"I wisht you had come  sooner 'cause Missy, here, and me is done had de bestes' time a-goin'  back over dem old times when folks loved one another better dan dey does  now. Good-bye Missy, you done been mighty kind and patient wid old  Jasper. Come back again some time.\"          [HW: Dist. --  Ex-Slv. #10]    ARRIE BINNS OF WASHINGTON-WILKES    by  Minnie Branham Stonestreet  Washington-Wilkes  Georgia  [MAY 8 1937]      Arrie Binns lives in Baltimore, a negro suburb of Washington-Wilkes, in  a little old tumbled down kind of a cottage that used to be one of the  neatest and best houses of the settlement and where she has lived for  the past sixty-odd years. In the yard of her home is one of the most  beautiful holly trees to be found anywhere. She set it there herself  over fifty years ago. She recalled how her friends predicted bad luck  would befall her because she \"sot out er holly\", but not being in the  least bit superstitious she paid them \"no mind\" and has enjoyed her  beautiful tree all these years. Many lovely oaks are around her house;  she set them there long ago when she was young and with her husband  moved into their new home and wanted to make it as attractive as  possible. She is all alone now. Her husband died some years ago and  three of her four children have passed on. Her \"preacher son\" who was  her delight, died not very long ago. All this sorrow has left Aunt Arrie  old and sad; her face is no longer lighted by the smile it used to know.  She is a tiny little scrap of a woman with the softest voice and is as  neat as can be. She wears an oldfashioned apron all the time and in cool  weather there is always a little black cape around her frail shoulders  and held together with a plain old gold \"breastpin\".    She was born in Lincoln County (Georgia), her mother was Emeline Sybert  and her father Jordan Sybert. They belonged to Mr. Jones Sybert and his  wife \"Miss Peggy\". After freedom they changed their surname to Gullatt  as they liked that better. Arrie was among the oldest of nine children.  The night she was born the stork brought a little baby girl to the home  of a white family just across the creek from the Syberts. The little  white girl was named Arine so \"Miss Peggy\" named the little new black  baby girl Arrie, and that is how it happened she was given such an odd  name.    Arrie said she was \"15 or 16 years old when the war broke (1865), I wuz  big enough to be lookin' at boys an' dey lookin' at me.\" She remembers  the days of war, how when the battle of Atlanta was raging they heard  the distant rumble of cannon, and how \"upsot\" they all were. Her master  died of \"the consumption\" during the war. She recalls how hard it was  after his death. The Syberts had no children and there was no one to  turn to after his death. Arrie tells of her Master's illness, how she  was the housemaid and was called upon to fan him and how she would get  so tired and sleepy she would nod a little, the fan dropping from hands  into his face. He would take it up and \"crack my haid with the handle to  wake me up. I wuz allus so sorry when I done that, but I jest had ter  nod.\"    She told about how bad the overseers were and the trouble they gave  until finally \"old Miss turned off ther one she had an' put my Pa in his  place to manage things and look after the work.\" Arrie was never  punished, (not any more than having her head cracked by her Master when  she nodded while fanning him.) \"No mam, not none of our niggers wuz  whipped. Why I recollect once, my brother wuz out without a pass an' de  patter rollers kotch him and brung him to old Miss and said he'd have  ter be whipped, old Miss got so mad she didn't know what ter do, she  said nobody wuz a goin' ter whip her niggers, but the patter roller men  'sisted so she said after er while, 'Well, but I'm goin' ter stan' right  here an' when I say stop, yer got ter stop', an' they 'greed to dat, an'  the third time dey hit him she raised her han' an' said 'STOP' an' dey  had ter let my brother go. My Miss wuz a big 'oman, she'd weigh nigh on  ter three hundred pound, I 'spect.\"    After her master's death Arrie had to go into the field to work. She  recalled with a little chuckle, the old cream horse, \"Toby\" she use to  plow. She loved Toby, she said, and they did good work. When not plowing  she said she \"picked er round in the fields\" doing whatever she could.  She and the other slaves were not required to do very hard work. Her  mother was a field hand, but in the evenings she spun and wove down in  their cabin. Aunt Arrie added \"an' I did love to hear that old spinnin'  wheel. It made a low kind of a whirring sound that made me sleepy.\" She  said her mother, with all the other negro women on the place, had \"a  task of spinnin' a spool at night\", and they spun and wove on rainy days  too. \"Ma made our clothes an' we had pretty dresses too. She dyed some  blue and brown striped. We growed the indigo she used fer the blue,  right dar on the plantation, and she used bark and leaves to make the  tan and brown colors.\"    Aunt Arrie said the Doctor was always called in when they were sick,  \"but we never sont fer him lesse'n somebody wuz real sick. De old folks  doctored us jest fer little ailments. Dey give us lye tea fer colds.

Carefully he scanned it.    \"I should say that was written in a sort of German hand; would you not  also?\" he asked of Mr. Damon.    \"I would, Tom.\"    \"A German!\" exclaimed General Waller.    At the mention of the word \"German\" Koku, the giant, who had entered  the room, to be stared at in amazement by the officer, exclaimed:    \"That he, Master! That he!\"    \"What do you mean?\" inquired Tom.    \"German man give me stuff for to put in your powder. I 'member now, he  talk like Hans who make our garden here; and he say 'yah' just the same  like. That man German sure.\"    \"What does this mean?\" inquired the officer.    Quickly Tom told of the visit of an unknown man who had prevailed on  the simple-minded giant to \"dope\" Tom's new powder under the impression  that he was doing his master a favor. Then the flight of the spy on a  motor-cycle, just as the experiment failed, was related.    \"We have a German gardener,\" went on Tom, \"and Koku now recalls that  our mysterious visitor had the same sort of speech. This ought to give  us a clue.\"    \"Let me see,\" murmured General Waller. \"In the first place your test  fails--you learn, then, that your powder has been tampered with--you  see a man riding away in haste after having, in all likelihood, spied  on your work--your giant servant recalls the visit of a mysterious man,  and, when the word 'German' is pronounced in his hearing he recalls  that his visitor was of that nationality. So far so good.    \"I come to this vicinity for my health. That fact, as are all such  regarding officers, was doubtless published in the Army and Navy  Journal, so it might easily become known to almost anyone. I receive a  letter which I think is from Tom Swift, asking me to attend the test.  As the distance is short I go, only to find that the letter has been  forged, presumably by a German.    \"Question: Can the same German be the agent in both cases?\"    \"Bless my arithmetic! how concisely you put it!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon.    \"It is part of my training, I suppose,\" remarked the officer.  \"But it  strikes me that if we find your German spy, Tom, we will find the man  who played the joke on me. And if I do find him--well, I think I shall  know how to deal with him,\" and General Waller assumed his  characteristic haughty attitude.    \"I believe you are right, General,\" spoke Tom. \"Though why any German  would want to prevent my experiments, or even damage my property, and  possibly injure my friends, I cannot understand.\"    \"Nor can I,\" spoke the officer.    \"I am sorry you have had your trouble for nothing,\" went on Tom. \"And,  if you are in this vicinity when I conduct my next test, I shall be  glad to have you come. I will send word by Mr. Damon, and then there  will be no chance of a mistake.\"    \"Thank you, Tom, I shall be glad to come. I do not know how long I shall  remain in this vicinity. If I knew where to look for the German I would  make a careful search. As it is, I shall turn this letter over to the  United States Secret Service, and see what its agents can do. And, Tom,  if you are annoyed again, let me know.  You are a sort of rival, so to  speak, but, after all, we are both working to serve Uncle Sam. I'll do  my best to protect you.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" replied Tom. \"On my part, I shall keep a good  lookout. It will be a bold spy who gets near my shop after this.  I'm  going to put up my highly-charged protecting electric wires again. We  were just talking about them when you came in. Would you like to look  about here, General?\"    \"I would, indeed, Tom. Have you made your big gun yet?\"    \"No, but I am working on the plans. I want first to decide on the kind  of explosive I am to use, so I can make my gun strong enough to stand  it.\"    \"A wise idea. I think there is where I made my mistake. I did not  figure carefully enough on the strength of material. The internal  pressure of the powder I used, as well as the muzzle velocity of my  projectile, were both greater than they should have been. Take a lesson  from my failure. But I am going to start on another gun soon, and--Tom  Swift--I am going to try to beat you!\"    \"All right, General,\" answered Tom, genially. \"May the best gun win!\"    \"Bless my powder box!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"That's the way to talk.\"    General Waller was much interested in going about Tom's shop, and  expressed his surprise at the many inventions he saw. While ordnance  matters, big guns and high explosives were his hobby, nevertheless the  airships were a source of wonder to him.    \"How do you do it, Tom?\" he asked.    \"Oh, by keeping at it,\" was the modest answer. \"Then my good friends  here--Ned and Mr. Damon--help me.\"    \"Bless my check book!\" exclaimed the odd gentleman. \"It is very little  help I give, Tom.\"    General Waller soon took his departure, promising to call again, to see  Tom's test if one were held. He also repeated his determination to set  the Secret Service men at work to discover the mysterious German.    \"I can't imagine who would want to injure you or me, Tom Swift,\" he  said.    \"Do you think they wanted to injure you, General?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"It would seem so,\" remarked Ned. \"That man doped Tom's powder, hoping  to make it so powerful that it would blow up everything.  Then he sends  word to the General to be present. If there had been a blow-up he would  have gone with it.\"    \"Bless my gaiters, yes!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon.    \"Well, we'll see if we can ferret him out!\" spoke the officer as he  took his leave.    Tom, Ned and the others talked the matter over at some length.    \"I wonder if we could trace that man who rode away on the motor-cycle?\"  said Ned.    \"We'll try,\" decided Tom, energetically, and in the electric runabout,  that had once performed such a service to his father's bank, the young  inventor and his chum were soon traversing the road taken by the spy.  They got some traces of him--that is, several persons had seen him  pass--but that was all. So they had to record one failure at least.    \"I wonder if the General himself could have sent that letter?\" mused  Ned, as they returned home.    \"What! To himself?\" cried Tom, in amazement.    \"He might have,\" went on Ned, coolly. \"You see, Tom, he admits that he  was jealous of you. Now what is there to prevent him from hiring  someone to dope your powder, and then, to divert suspicion from  himself, faking up a letter and inviting himself to the blowout.\"    \"But if he did that--which I don't believe--why would he come when  there was danger, in case his trick worked, of the whole place being  blown to kingdom come.\"    \"Ah, but you notice he didn't arrive until after danger of an explosion  had passed,\" commented Ned.    \"Oh, pshaw!\" cried Tom. \"I don't take any stock in that theory.\"    \"Well, maybe not,\" replied Ned. \"But it's worth thinking about.  I  believe if General Waller could prevent you from inventing your big  gun, he would.\"    The days that followed were busy ones for Tom. He worked on the powder  problem from morning to night, scoring many failures and only a few  successes. But he did not give up, and in the meanwhile drew tentative  plans for the big gun.    One evening, after a hard day's work, he went to the library where his  father was reading.    \"Tom,\" said Mr. Swift, \"do you remember that old fortune hunter, Alec  Peterson, who wanted me to go into that opal mine scheme?\"    \"Yes, Dad. What about him? Has he found it?\"    \"No, he writes to say he reached the island safely, and has been  working some time. He hasn't had any success yet in locating the mine;  but he hopes to find it in a week or so.\"    \"That's just like him,\" murmured Tom. \"Well, Dad, if you lose the ten  thousand dollars I guess I'll have to make it up to you, for it was on  my account that you made the investment.\"    \"Well, you're worth it, Tom,\" replied his father, with a smile.          CHAPTER XII    A POWERFUL BLAST      \"Look out with that box, Koku! Handle it as though it contained a dozen  eggs of the extinct great auk, worth about a thousand dollars apiece.    \"Eradicate! Don't you dare stumble while you're carrying that tube. If  you do, you'll never do it again!\"    \"By golly, Massa Tom! I--I's gwine t' walk on mah tiptoes all de way!\"    Thus Eradicate answered the young inventor, while the giant, Koku, who  was carrying a heavy case, nodded his head to show that he understood  the danger of his task.    \"So you think you've got the right stuff this time, Tom?\" asked Ned  Newton.    \"I'm allowing myself to hope so, Ned.\"    \"Bless my woodpile!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"I--I really think I'm getting  nervous.\"    It was one afternoon, about two weeks after Tom had made his first test  of the new powder. Now, after much hard work, and following many other  tests, some of which were more or less successful, he had reached the  point where he believed he was on the threshold of success. He had  succeeded in making a new explosive that, in the preliminary tests, in  which only a small quantity was used, gave promise of being more  powerful than any Tom had ever experimented with--his own or the  product of some other inventor.    And his experiments had not always been harmless. Once he came within a  narrow margin of blowing up the shop and himself with it, and on  another occasion some of the slow-burning powder, failing to explode,  had set ablaze a shack in which he was working.    Only for the prompt action of Koku, Tom might have been seriously  injured. As it was he lost some valuable patterns and papers.    But he had gone on his way, surmounting failure after failure, until  now he was ready for the supreme test. This was to be the explosion of  a large quantity of the powder in a specially prepared steel tube of  great thickness. It was like a miniature cannon, but, unlike the first  small one, where the test had failed, this one would carry a special  projectile, that would be aimed at an armor plate set up on "]]]
