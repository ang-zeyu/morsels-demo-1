These ideas take faster hold of my mind  than ideas of an enchanted castle. They are very different to the  feeling, and have a much greater influence of every kind, either to give  pleasure or pain, joy or sorrow.    Let us, then, take in the whole compass of this doctrine, and allow,  that the sentiment of belief is nothing but a conception more intense  and steady than what attends the mere fictions of the imagination, and  that this _manner_ of conception arises from a customary conjunction of  the object with something present to the memory or senses: I believe  that it will not be difficult, upon these suppositions, to find other  operations of the mind analogous to it, and to trace up these phenomena  to principles still more general.    41. We have already observed that nature has established connexions  among particular ideas, and that no sooner one idea occurs to our  thoughts than it introduces its correlative, and carries our attention  towards it, by a gentle and insensible movement. These principles of  connexion or association we have reduced to three, namely,  _Resemblance_, _Contiguity_ and _Causation_; which are the only bonds  that unite our thoughts together, and beget that regular train of  reflection or discourse, which, in a greater or less degree, takes place  among all mankind. Now here arises a question, on which the solution of  the present difficulty will depend. Does it happen, in all these  relations, that, when one of the objects is presented to the senses or  memory, the mind is not only carried to the conception of the  correlative, but reaches a steadier and stronger conception of it than  what otherwise it would have been able to attain? This seems to be the  case with that belief which arises from the relation of cause and  effect. And if the case be the same with the other relations or  principles of associations, this may be established as a general law,  which takes place in all the operations of the mind.    We may, therefore, observe, as the first experiment to our present  purpose, that, upon the appearance of the picture of an absent friend,  our idea of him is evidently enlivened by the _resemblance_, and that  every passion, which that idea occasions, whether of joy or sorrow,  acquires new force and vigour. In producing this effect, there concur  both a relation and a present impression. Where the picture bears him no  resemblance, at least was not intended for him, it never so much as  conveys our thought to him: And where it is absent, as well as the  person, though the mind may pass from the thought of the one to that of  the other, it feels its idea to be rather weakened than enlivened by  that transition. We take a pleasure in viewing the picture of a friend,  when it is set before us; but when it is removed, rather choose to  consider him directly than by reflection in an image, which is equally  distant and obscure.    The ceremonies of the Roman Catholic religion may be considered as  instances of the same nature. The devotees of that superstition usually  plead in excuse for the mummeries, with which they are upbraided, that  they feel the good effect of those external motions, and postures, and  actions, in enlivening their devotion and quickening their fervour,  which otherwise would decay, if directed entirely to distant and  immaterial objects. We shadow out the objects of our faith, say they, in  sensible types and images, and render them more present to us by the  immediate presence of these types, than it is possible for us to do  merely by an intellectual view and contemplation. Sensible objects have  always a greater influence on the fancy than any other; and this  influence they readily convey to those ideas to which they are related,  and which they resemble. I shall only infer from these practices, and  this reasoning, that the effect of resemblance in enlivening the ideas  is very common; and as in every case a resemblance and a present  impression must concur, we are abundantly supplied with experiments to  prove the reality of the foregoing principle.    42. We may add force to these experiments by others of a different kind,  in considering the effects of _contiguity_ as well as of _resemblance_.  It is certain that distance diminishes the force of every idea, and  that, upon our approach to any object; though it does not discover  itself to our senses; it operates upon the mind with an influence, which  imitates an immediate impression. The thinking on any object readily  transports the mind to what is contiguous; but it is only the actual  presence of an object, that transports it with a superior vivacity. When  I am a few miles from home, whatever relates to it touches me more  nearly than when I am two hundred leagues distant; though even at that  distance the reflecting on any thing in the neighbourhood of my friends  or family naturally produces an idea of them. But as in this latter  case, both the objects of the mind are ideas; notwithstanding there is  an easy transition between them; that transition alone is not able to  give a superior vivacity to any of the ideas, for want of some immediate  impression[8].        [8] 'Naturane nobis, inquit, datum dicam, an errore quodam, ut,      cum ea loca videamus, in quibus memoria dignos viros      acceperimus multum esse versatos, magis moveamur, quam siquando      eorum ipsorum aut facta audiamus aut scriptum aliquod legamus?      Velut ego nunc moveor. Venit enim mihi Plato in mentem, quera      accepimus primum hic disputare solitum: cuius etiam illi      hortuli propinqui non memoriam solum mihi afferunt, sed ipsum      videntur in conspectu meo hic ponere. Hic Speusippus, hic      Xenocrates, hic eius auditor Polemo; cuius ipsa illa sessio      fuit, quam videmus. Equidem etiam curiam nostram, Hostiliam      dico, non hanc novam, quae mihi minor esse videtur postquam est      maior, solebam intuens, Scipionem, Catonem, Laelium, nostrum      vero in primis avum cogitare. Tanta vis admonitionis est in      locis; ut non sine causa ex his memoriae deducta sit      disciplina.'        _Cicero de Finibus_. Lib. v.    43. No one can doubt but causation has the same influence as the other  two relations of resemblance and contiguity. Superstitious people are  fond of the reliques of saints and holy men, for the same reason, that  they seek after types or images, in order to enliven their devotion, and  give them a more intimate and strong conception of those exemplary  lives, which they desire to imitate. Now it is evident, that one of the  best reliques, which a devotee could procure, would be the handywork of  a saint; and if his cloaths and furniture are ever to be considered in  this light, it is because they were once at his disposal, and were moved  and affected by him; in which respect they are to be considered as  imperfect effects, and as connected with him by a shorter chain of  consequences than any of those, by which we learn the reality of his  existence.    Suppose, that the son of a friend, who had been long dead or absent,  were presented to us; it is evident, that this object would instantly  revive its correlative idea, and recal to our thoughts all past  intimacies and familiarities, in more lively colours than they would  otherwise have appeared to us. This is another phaenomenon, which seems  to prove the principle above mentioned.    44. We may observe, that, in these phaenomena, the belief of the  correlative object is always presupposed; without which the relation  could have no effect. The influence of the picture supposes, that we  _believe_ our friend to have once existed. Contiguity to home can never  excite our ideas of home, unless we _believe_ that it really exists. Now  I assert, that this belief, where it reaches beyond the memory or  senses, is of a similar nature, and arises from similar causes, with the  transition of thought and vivacity of conception here explained. When I  throw a piece of dry wood into a fire, my mind is immediately carried to  conceive, that it augments, not extinguishes the flame. This transition  of thought from the cause to the effect proceeds not from reason. It  derives its origin altogether from custom and experience. And as it  first begins from an object, present to the senses, it renders the idea  or conception of flame more strong and lively than any loose, floating  reverie of the imagination. That idea arises immediately. The thought  moves instantly towards it, and conveys to it all that force of  conception, which is derived from the impression present to the senses.  When a sword is levelled at my breast, does not the idea of wound and  pain strike me more strongly, than when a glass of wine is presented to  me, even though by accident this idea should occur after the appearance  of the latter object? But what is there in this whole matter to cause  such a strong conception, except only a present object and a customary  transition to the idea of another object, which we have been accustomed  to conjoin with the former? This is the whole operation of the mind, in  all our conclusions concerning matter of fact and existence; and it is a  satisfaction to find some analogies, by which it may be explained. The  transition from a present object does in all cases give strength and  solidity to the related idea.    Here, then, is a kind of pre-established harmony between the course of  nature and the succession of our ideas; and though the powers and  forces, by which the former is governed, be wholly unknown to us; yet  our thoughts and conceptions have still, we find, gone on in the same  train with the other works of nature. Custom is that principle, by which  this correspondence has been effected; so necessary to the subsistence  of our species, and the regulation of our conduct, in every circumstance  and occurrence of human life."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9666"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 497, July 11, 1885 (#10)"],[1,".'s Well, Murraysville, Pa.    12.

The mineral asbestos is but a very poor packing material in  steam-boilers. Moreover, it acts as a strong grinding material on all  moving parts.    For some years I have tested the applicability of artificial  precipitates to close the holes in boilers, cylinder-covers, and  stuffing boxes. I took, generally with the best success, alternate  layers of hemp-cotton, thread, and absorbent paper, all well saturated  with the chlorides of calcium and magnesium. The next layers of the same  fiber are moistened with silicate of soda. By pressure the fluids are  mixed and the pores are closed. A stuffing box filled with this mixture  has worked three years without grinding the piston-rod.    In the same manner I close the screw-thread hole in gas tubes used for  conducting steam. I moisten the thread in the sockets with oleic acid  from the candle-works, and dust over it a mixture of 1 part of minium,  2 parts of quick-lime, and 1 part of linseed powder (without the oil).  When the tube is screwed in the socket, the powder mixes with the oleic  acid. The water coming in at first makes the linseed powder viscid.  Later the steam forming the oleate of lime and the oleate of lead,  on its way to the outer air, presses it in the holes and closes them  perfectly.    After a year in use the tubes can be unscrewed with ease, and the screw  threads are perfectly smooth.    With this kind of packing only one exception must be made--that is, it  is only tight under pressure; condensation or vacuum must be thoroughly  avoided.--_Chem. News_.           *       *       *       *       *          LUMINOUS PAINT.      In answer to various inquiries concerning the manufacture of this  article, we give herewith the process of William Henry Balmain, the  original discoverer of luminous paint, and also other processes. These  particulars are derived from the letters patent granted in this country  to the parties named.    Balmain's invention was patented in England in 1877, and in this country  in 1882. It is styled as Improvements in Painting, Varnishing, and  Whitewashing, of which the following is a specification:    The said invention consists in a luminous paint, the body of which is a  phosphorescent compound, or is composed in part of such a compound, and  the vehicle of which is such as is used as the vehicle in ordinary paint  compounds, viz., one which becomes dry by evaporation or oxidation.    The objector article to which such paint or varnish or wash is applied  is itself rendered visible in the darkest place, and more or less  capable of imparting light to other objects, so as to render them  visible also. The phosphorescent substance found most suitable for the  purpose is a compound obtained by simply heating together a mixture  of lime and sulphur, or carbonate of lime and sulphur, or some of the  various substances containing in themselves both lime and sulphur--such,  for example, as alabaster, gypsum, and the like--with carbon or other  agent to remove a portion of the oxygen contained in them, or by heating  lime or carbonate of lime in a gas or vapor containing sulphur.    The vehicle to be used for the luminous paint must be one which will dry  by evaporation or oxidation, in order that the paint may not become soft  or fluid by heat or be liable to be easily rubbed off by accident or use  from the articles to which it has been applied. It may be any of the  vehicles commonly used in oil-painting or any of those commonly used in  what is known as \"distemper\" painting or whitewashing, according to the  place or purpose in or for which the paint is to be used.    It is found the best results are obtained by mixing the phosphorescent  substance with a colorless varnish made with mastic or other resinous  body and turpentine or spirit, making the paint as thick as convenient  to apply with a brush, and with as much turpentine or spirit as can  be added without impairing the required thickness. Good results may,  however, be obtained with drying oils, spirit varnishes, gums, pastes,  sizes, and gelatine solutions of every description, the choice being  varied to meet the object in view or the nature of the article in hand.    The mode of applying the paint, varnish, or wash will also depend upon  the circumstances of the case. For example, it may be applied by a  brush, as in ordinary painting, or by dipping or steeping the article  in the paint, varnish, or wash; or a block or type may be used to  advantage, as in calico-printing and the like. For outdoor work, or  wherever the surface illuminated is exposed to the vicissitudes of  weather or to injury from mechanical contingencies, it is desirable to  cover it with glass, or, if the article will admit of it, to glaze it  over with a flux, as in enameling, or as in ordinary pottery, and this  may be accomplished without injury to the effect, even when the flux or  glaze requires a red heat for fusion.    Among other applications of the said invention which may be enumerated,  it is particularly advantageous for rendering visible clock or watch  faces and other indicators--such, for example, as compasses and the  scales of barometers or thermometers--during the night or in dark places  during the night time. In applying the invention to these and other  like purposes there may be used either phosphorescent grounds with  dark figures or dark grounds and phosphorescent figures or letters,  preferring the former. In like manner there may be produced figures and  letters for use on house-doors and ends of streets, wherever it is not  convenient or economical to have external source of light, signposts,  and signals, and names or marks to show entries to avenues or gates, and  the like.    The invention is also applicable to the illumination of railway  carriages by painting with phosphorescent paint a portion of the  interior, thus obviating the necessity for the expense and inconvenience  of the use of lamps in passing through tunnels. It may also be applied  externally as warning-lights at the front and end of trains passing  through tunnels, and in other similar cases, also to ordinary carriages,  either internally or externally. As a night-light in a bed-room or in a  room habitually dark, the application has been found quite effectual, a  very small proportion of the surface rendered phosphorescent affording  sufficient light for moving about the room, or for fixing upon and  selecting an article in the midst of a number of complicated scientific  instruments or other objects.    The invention may also be applied to private and public buildings in  cases where it would be economical and advantageous to maintain for a  short time a waning or twilight, so as to obviate the necessity for  lighting earlier the gas or other artificial light. It may also be  used in powder-mills and stores of powder, and in other cases where  combustion or heat would be a constant source of danger, and generally  for all purposes of artificial light where it is applicable.    In order to produce and maintain the phosphorescent light, full sunshine  is not necessary, but, on the contrary, is undesirable. The illumination  is best started by leaving the article or surface exposed for a short  time to ordinary daylight or even artificial light, which need not be  strong in order to make the illumination continue for many hours, even  twenty hours, without, the necessity of renewed exposure.    The advantages of the invention consist in obtaining for the purposes of  daily life a light which is maintained at no cost whatever, is free from  the defects and contingent dangers arising from combustion or heat, and  can be applied in many cases where all other sources of light would be  inconvenient or incapable of application.    Heretofore phosphorus has been mixed with earthy oxides, carbonates,  and sulphates, and with oxides and carbonates of metal, as tin, zinc,  magnesia, antimony, and chlorides of the same, also crystallized acids  and salts and mineral substances, and same have been inclosed and  exhibited in closely-stopped bottles as a phosphorus; but such union I  do not claim; but what I claim is:    A luminous paint, the body of which is a phosphorescent substance, or  composed in part of such substance, the vehicle of which is such as is  ordinarily used in paints, viz., one which will become dry by oxidation  or evaporation, substantially as herein described.
