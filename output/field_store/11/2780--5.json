Young Mr. Petheram had obviously staked out an  indisputable claim. Her attitude toward him was that of an affectionate  devotee toward a high priest. One morning, entering the office  unexpectedly, Roland found her kissing the top of Mr. Petheram's head;  and from that moment his interest in the fortunes of 'Squibs' sank to  zero. It amazed him that he could ever have been idiot enough to have  allowed himself to be entangled in this insane venture for the sake  of an insignificant-looking bit of a girl with a snub-nose and a poor  complexion.    What particularly galled him was the fact that he was throwing away good  cash for nothing. It was true that his capital was more than equal to  the, on the whole, modest demands of the paper, but that did not alter  the fact that he was wasting money. Mr. Petheram always talked buoyantly  about turning the corner, but the corner always seemed just as far off.    The old idea of flight, to which he invariably had recourse in any  crisis, came upon Roland with irresistible force. He packed a bag, and  went to Paris. There, in the discomforts of life in a foreign country,  he contrived for a month to forget his white elephant.    He returned by the evening train which deposits the traveler in London  in time for dinner.    Strangely enough, nothing was farther from Roland's mind than his  bright weekly paper, as he sat down to dine in a crowded grill-room near  Piccadilly Circus. Four weeks of acute torment in a city where nobody  seemed to understand the simplest English sentence had driven 'Squibs'  completely from his mind for the time being.    The fact that such a paper existed was brought home to him with the  coffee. A note was placed upon his table by the attentive waiter.    \"What's this?\" he asked.    \"The lady, sare,\" said the waiter vaguely.    Roland looked round the room excitedly. The spirit of romance gripped  him. There were many ladies present, for this particular restaurant  was a favorite with artistes who were permitted to \"look in\" at their  theaters as late as eight-thirty. None of them looked particularly  self-conscious, yet one of them had sent him this quite unsolicited  tribute. He tore open the envelope.    The message, written in a flowing feminine hand, was brief, and Mrs.  Grundy herself could have taken no exception to it.    \"'Squibs,' one penny weekly, buy it,\" it ran. All the mellowing effects  of a good dinner passed away from Roland. He was feverishly irritated.  He paid his bill and left the place.    A visit to a neighboring music-hall occurred to him as a suitable  sedative. Hardly had his nerves ceased to quiver sufficiently to allow  him to begin to enjoy the performance, when, in the interval between two  of the turns, a man rose in one of the side boxes.    \"Is there a doctor in the house?\"    There was a hush in the audience. All eyes were directed toward the box.  A man in the stalls rose, blushing, and cleared his throat.    \"My wife has fainted,\" continued the speaker. \"She has just discovered  that she has lost her copy of 'Squibs.'\"    The audience received the statement with the bovine stolidity of an  English audience in the presence of the unusual.    Not so Roland. Even as the purposeful-looking chuckers-out wended their  leopard-like steps toward the box, he was rushing out into the street.    As he stood cooling his indignation in the pleasant breeze which had  sprung up, he was aware of a dense crowd proceeding toward him. It was  headed by an individual who shone out against the drab background like a  good deed in a naughty world. Nature hath framed strange fellows in her  time, and this was one of the strangest that Roland's bulging eyes had  ever rested upon. He was a large, stout man, comfortably clad in a suit  of white linen, relieved by a scarlet 'Squibs' across the bosom. His  top-hat, at least four sizes larger than any top-hat worn out of a  pantomime, flaunted the same word in letters of flame. His umbrella,  which, tho the weather was fine, he carried open above his head, bore  the device \"One penny weekly\".    The arrest of this person by a vigilant policeman and Roland's dive into  a taxicab occurred simultaneously. Roland was blushing all over. His  head was in a whirl. He took the evening paper handed in through  the window of the cab quite mechanically, and it was only the strong  exhortations of the vendor which eventually induced him to pay for it.  This he did with a sovereign, and the cab drove off.    He was just thinking of going to bed several hours later, when it  occurred to him that he had not read his paper. He glanced at the  first page. The middle column was devoted to a really capitally written  account of the proceedings at Bow Street consequent upon the arrest  of six men who, it was alleged, had caused a crowd to collect to the  disturbance of the peace by parading the Strand in the undress of Zulu  warriors, shouting in unison the words \"Wah! Wah! Wah! Buy 'Squibs.'\"           *       *       *       *       *    Young Mr. Petheram greeted Roland with a joyous enthusiasm which the  hound Argus, on the return of Ulysses, might have equalled but could  scarcely have surpassed.    It seemed to be Mr. Petheram's considered opinion that God was in His  Heaven and all was right with the world. Roland's attempts to correct  this belief fell on deaf ears.    \"Have I seen the advertisements?\" he cried, echoing his editor's first  question. \"I've seen nothing else.\"    \"There!\" said Mr. Petheram proudly.    \"It can't go on.\"    \"Yes, it can. Don't you worry. I know they're arrested as fast as we  send them out, but, bless you, the supply's endless. Ever since the  Revue boom started and actors were expected to do six different parts in  seven minutes, there are platoons of music-hall 'pros' hanging about  the Strand, ready to take on any sort of job you offer them. I have a  special staff flushing the Bodegas. These fellows love it. It's meat and  drink to them to be right in the public eye like that. Makes them feel  ten years younger. It's wonderful the talent knocking about. Those  Zulus used to have a steady job as the Six Brothers Biff, Society  Contortionists. The Revue craze killed them professionally. They cried  like children when we took them on.    \"By the way, could you put through an expenses cheque before you go?  The fines mount up a bit. But don't you worry about that either. We're  coining money. I'll show you the returns in a minute. I told you we  should turn the corner. Turned it! Blame me, we've whizzed round it on  two wheels. Have you had time to see the paper since you got back? No?  Then you haven't seen our new Scandal Page--'We Just Want to Know, You  Know.' It's a corker, and it's sent the circulation up like a rocket.  Everybody reads 'Squibs' now. I was hoping you would come back soon. I  wanted to ask you about taking new offices. We're a bit above this sort  of thing now.\"    Roland, meanwhile, was reading with horrified eyes the alleged corking  Scandal Page. It seemed to him without exception the most frightful  production he had ever seen. It appalled him.    \"This is awful,\" he moaned. \"We shall have a hundred libel actions.\"    \"Oh, no, that's all right. It's all fake stuff, tho the public doesn't  know it. If you stuck to real scandals you wouldn't get a par. a week.  A more moral set of blameless wasters than the blighters who constitute  modern society you never struck. But it reads all right, doesn't it? Of  course, every now and then one does hear something genuine, and then it  goes in. For instance, have you ever heard of Percy Pook, the bookie? I  have got a real ripe thing in about Percy this week, the absolute limpid  truth. It will make him sit up a bit. There, just under your thumb.\"    Roland removed his thumb, and, having read the paragraph in question,  started as if he had removed it from a snake.    \"But this is bound to mean a libel action!\" he cried.    \"Not a bit of it,\" said Mr. Petheram comfortably. \"You don't know Percy.  I won't bore you with his life-history, but take it from me he doesn't  rush into a court of law from sheer love of it. You're safe enough.\"           *       *       *       *       *    But it appeared that Mr. Pook, tho coy in the matter of cleansing his  scutcheon before a judge and jury, was not wholly without weapons of  defense and offense. Arriving at the office next day, Roland found a  scene of desolation, in the middle of which, like Marius among the ruins  of Carthage, sat Jimmy, the vacant-faced office boy. Jimmy was  reading an illustrated comic paper, and appeared undisturbed by his  surroundings.    \"He's gorn,\" he observed, looking up as Roland entered.    \"What do you mean?\" Roland snapped at him. \"Who's gone and where did he  go? And besides that, when you speak to your superiors you will rise and  stop chewing that infernal gum. It gets on my nerves.\"    Jimmy neither rose nor relinquished his gum. He took his time and  answered.    \"Mr. Petheram. A couple of fellers come in and went through, and there  was a uproar inside there, and presently out they come running, and I  went in, and there was Mr. Petheram on the floor knocked silly and the  furniture all broke, and now 'e's gorn to 'orspital. Those fellers 'ad  been putting 'im froo it proper,\" concluded Jimmy with moody relish.    Roland sat down weakly. Jimmy, his tale told, resumed the study of his  illustrated paper. Silence reigned in the offices of 'Squibs.'    It was broken by the arrival of Miss March. Her exclamation of  astonishment at the sight of the wrecked room led to a repetition of  Jimmy's story.    She vanished on hearing the name of the hospital to which the stricken  editor had been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8743"],[0,"Mary Schweidler, the amber witch (#10)"],[1," squint-eyed wife came and impudently asked for more for her husband's  journey to Liepe; neither had she had anything for herself, seeing she had  not come to church. This angered me sore, and I said to her, \"Why wast thou  not at church? Nevertheless, if thou hadst come humbly to me thou shouldst  have gotten somewhat even now, but as thou comest impudently, I will give  thee nought: think on what thou didst to me and to my child.\" But she stood  at the door and glowered impudently about the room till my daughter took  her by the arm and led her out, saying, \"Hear'st thou, thou shalt come back  humbly before thou gett'st anything, but when thou comest thus, thou also  shalt have thy share, for we will no longer reckon with thee an eye for an  eye, and a tooth for a tooth; let the Lord do that if such be his will, but  we will gladly forgive thee!\" Hereupon she at last went out at the door,  muttering to herself as she was wont; but she spat several times in the  street, as we saw from the window.    Soon after I made up my mind to take into my service a lad, near upon  twenty years of age, called Claus Neels, seeing that his father, old  Neels of Loddin, begged hard that I would do so, besides which the lad  pleased me well in manners and otherwise. Then, as we had a good harvest  this year, I resolved to buy me a couple of horses forthwith, and to sow  my field again; for although it was now late in the year, I thought that  the most merciful God might bless the crop with increase if it seemed  good to him.    Neither did I feel much care with respect to food for them, inasmuch as  there was a great plenty of hay in the neighbourhood, seeing that all the  cattle had been killed or driven away (as related above). I therefore made  up my mind to go in God's name with my new ploughman to Guetzkow, whither a  great many Mecklenburg horses were brought to the fair, seeing that times  were not yet so bad there as with us. Meanwhile I went a few more times up  the Streckelberg with my daughter at night, and by moonlight, but found  very little; so that we began to think our luck had come to an end, when,  on the third night, we broke off some pieces of amber bigger even than  those the two Dutchmen had bought. These I resolved to send to my wife's  brother, Martin Behring, at Hamburg, seeing that the schipper Wulff of  Wolgast intends, as I am told, to sail thither this very autumn, with  pitch and wood for shipbuilding. I accordingly packed it all up in a  strong chest, which I carried with me to Wolgast when I started with my  man on my journey to Guetzkow. Of this journey I will only relate thus  much, that there were plenty of horses and very few buyers in the market.  Wherefore I bought a pair of fine black horses for twenty florins apiece;  _item_, a cart for five florins; _item_, twenty-five bushels of rye, which  also came from Mecklenburg, at one florin the bushel, whereas it is hardly  to be had now at Wolgast for love or money, and costs three florins or  more the bushel. I might therefore have made a good bargain in rye at  Guetzkow if it had become my office, and had I not, moreover, been afraid  lest the robbers, who swarm in these evil times, should take away my corn,  and ill-use and perchance murder me into the bargain, as has happened to  sundry people already. For, at this time especially, such robberies were  carried on after a strange and frightful fashion on Strellin heath at  Guetzkow; but by God's help it all came to light just as I journeyed  thither with my man-servant to the fair, and I will here tell how it  happened. Some months before a man had been broken on the wheel at  Guetzkow, because, being tempted of Satan, he murdered a travelling  workman. The man, however, straightway began to walk after so fearful a  fashion, that in the evening and night-season he sprang down from the  wheel in his gallows' dress whenever a cart passed by the gallows, which  stands hard by the road to Wolgast, and jumped up behind the people, who  in horror and dismay flogged on their horses, and thereby made a great  rattling on the log embankment which leads beside the gallows into a  little wood called the Kraulin. And it was a strange thing that on the  same night the travellers were almost always robbed or murdered on  Strellin heath. Hereupon the magistrates had the man taken down from the  wheel and buried under the gallows, in hopes of laying his ghost. But it  went on just as before, sitting at night snow-white on the wheel, so that  none durst any longer travel the road to Wolgast. Until at last it  happened that, at the time of the above-named fair, young Ruediger von  Nienkerken of Mellenthin, in Usedom, who had been studying at Wittenberg  and elsewhere, and was now on his way home, came this road by night with  his carriage. Just before, at the inn, I myself had tried to persuade him  to stop the night at Guetzkow on account of the ghost, and to go on his  journey with me next morning, but he would not. Now as soon as this young  lord drove along the road, he also espied the apparition sitting on the  wheel, and scarcely had he passed the gallows when the ghost jumped down  and ran after him. The driver was horribly afraid, and lashed on the  horses, as everybody else had done before, and they, taking fright,  galloped away over the log-road with a marvellous clatter. Meanwhile,  however, the young nobleman saw by the light of the moon how that the  apparition flattened a ball of horse-dung whereon it trod, and straightway  felt sure within himself that it was no ghost. Whereupon he called to the  driver to stop; and as the man would not hearken to him, he sprang out of  the carriage, drew his rapier, and hastened to attack the ghost. When the  ghost saw this he would have turned and fled, but the young nobleman gave  him such a blow on the head with his fist that he fell upon the ground  with a loud wailing. _Summa_: the young lord, having called back his  driver, dragged the ghost into the town again, where he turned out to be a  shoemaker called Schwelm.    I also, on seeing such a great crowd, ran thither with many others to  look at the fellow. He trembled like an aspen leaf; and when he was  roughly told to make a clean breast, whereby he might peradventure save  his own life, if it appeared that he had murdered no one, he confessed  that he had got his wife to make him a gallows' dress, which he had  put on, and had sat on the wheel before the dead man, when, from the  darkness and the distance, no one could see that the two were sitting  there together; and this he did more especially when he knew that a  cart was going from the town to Wolgast. When the cart came by, and he  jumped down and ran after it, all the people were so affrighted that  they no longer kept their eyes upon the gallows, but only on him,  flogged the horses, and galloped with much noise and clatter over the  log embankment. This was heard by his fellows in Strellin and Dammbecke  (two villages which are about three-fourths on the way), who held  themselves ready to unyoke the horses and to plunder the travellers  when they came up with them. That after the dead man was buried he  could play the ghost more easily still, etc. That this was the whole  truth, and that he himself had never in his life robbed, still less  murdered, any one; wherefore he begged to be forgiven: that all the  robberies and murders which had happened had been done by his fellows  alone. Ah, thou cunning knave! But I heard afterwards that he and his  fellows were broken on the wheel together, as was but fair.    And now to come back to my journey. The young nobleman abode that night  with me at the inn, and early next morning we both set forth; and as we  had grown into good-fellowship together, I got into his coach with him,  as he offered me, so as to talk by the way, and my Claus drove behind  us. I soon found that he was a well-bred, honest, and learned gentleman,  seeing that he despised the wild student life, and was glad that he had  now done with their scandalous drinking-bouts: moreover, he talked his  Latin readily. I had therefore much pleasure with him in the coach.  However, at Wolgast the rope of the ferry-boat broke, so that we were  carried down the stream to Zeuzin, and at length we only got ashore with  great trouble. Meanwhile it grew late, and we did not get into Coserow  till nine, when I asked the young lord to abide the night with me, which  he agreed to do. We found my child sitting in the chimney-corner, making  a petticoat for her little god-daughter out of her own old clothes. She  was greatly frighted, and changed colour when she saw the young lord  come in with me, and heard that he was to lie there that night, seeing  that as yet we had no more beds than we had bought for our own need from  old Zabel Nehring the forest ranger his widow, at Uekeritze. Wherefore  she took me aside: What was to be done? My bed was in an ill plight, her  little god-child having lain on it that morning; and she could nowise  put the young nobleman into hers, although she would willingly creep in  by the maid herself. And when I asked her why not? she blushed scarlet  and began to cry, and would not show herself again the whole evening, so  that the maid had to see to everything, even to the putting white sheets  on my child's bed for the young lord, as she would not do it herself. I  only tell this to show how maidens are. For next morning she came into  the room with her red silk bodice, and the net on her hair, and the  apron; _summa_, dressed in all the things I had bought her at Wolgast,  so that the young lord was amazed, and talked much with her over the  morning meal. Whereupon he took his leave, and desired me to visit him  at his castle.
