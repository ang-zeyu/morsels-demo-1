The individual, too,  should be guided exactly in his life by the prescriptions of the rites,  so that harmony with the law of the universe may be established.    A second idea of the Confucian system came also from the old conceptions  of the Chou conquerors, and thus originally from the northern peoples.  This is the patriarchal idea, according to which the family is the cell  of society, and at the head of the family stands the eldest male adult  as a sort of patriarch. The state is simply an extension of the family,  \"state\", of course, meaning simply the class of the feudal lords (the  \"chuen-tz[)u]\"). And the organization of the family is also that of the  world of the gods. Within the family there are a number of ties, all of  them, however, one-sided: that of father to son (the son having to obey  the father unconditionally and having no rights of his own;) that of  husband to wife (the wife had no rights); that of elder to younger  brother. An extension of these is the association of friend with friend,  which is conceived as an association between an elder and a younger  brother. The final link, and the only one extending beyond the family  and uniting it with the state, is the association of the ruler with the  subject, a replica of that between father and son. The ruler in turn is  in the position of son to Heaven. Thus in Confucianism the cult of  Heaven, the family system, and the state are welded into unity. The  frictionless functioning of this whole system is effected by everyone  adhering to the rites, which prescribe every important action. It is  necessary, of course, that in a large family, in which there may be up  to a hundred persons living together, there shall be a precisely  established ordering of relationships between individuals if there is  not to be continual friction. Since the scholars of Confucius's type  specialized in the knowledge and conduct of ceremonies, Confucius gave  ritualism a correspondingly important place both in spiritual and in  practical life.    So far as we have described it above, the teaching of Confucius was a  further development of the old cult of Heaven. Through bitter  experience, however, Confucius had come to realize that nothing could be  done with the ruling house as it existed in his day. So shadowy a figure  as the Chou ruler of that time could not fulfil what Confucius required  of the \"Son of Heaven\". But the opinions of students of Confucius's  actual ideas differ. Some say that in the only book in which he  personally had a hand, the so-called _Annals of Spring and Autumn_, he  intended to set out his conception of the character of a true emperor;  others say that in that book he showed how he would himself have acted  as emperor, and that he was only awaiting an opportunity to make himself  emperor. He was called indeed, at a later time, the \"uncrowned ruler\".  In any case, the _Annals of Spring and Autumn_ seem to be simply a dry  work of annals, giving the history of his native state of Lu on the  basis of the older documents available to him. In his text, however,  Confucius made small changes by means of which he expressed criticism or  recognition; in this way he indirectly made known how in his view a  ruler should act or should not act. He did not shrink from falsifying  history, as can today be demonstrated. Thus on one occasion a ruler had  to flee from a feudal prince, which in Confucius's view was impossible  behaviour for the ruler; accordingly he wrote instead that the ruler  went on a hunting expedition. Elsewhere he tells of an eclipse of the  sun on a certain day, on which in fact there was no eclipse. By writing  of an eclipse he meant to criticize the way a ruler had acted, for the  sun symbolized the ruler, and the eclipse meant that the ruler had not  been guided by divine illumination. The demonstration that the _Annals  of Spring and Autumn_ can only be explained in this way was the  achievement some thirty-five years ago of Otto Franke, and through this  discovery Confucius's work, which the old sinologists used to describe  as a dry and inadequate book, has become of special value to us. The  book ends with the year 481 B.C., and in spite of its distortions it is  the principal source for the two-and-a-half centuries with which it  deals.    Rendered alert by this experience, we are able to see and to show that  most of the other later official works of history follow the example of  the _Annals of Spring and Autumn_ in containing things that have been  deliberately falsified. This is especially so in the work called  _T'ung-chien kang-mu_, which was the source of the history of the  Chinese empire translated into French by de Mailla.    Apart from Confucius's criticism of the inadequate capacity of the  emperor of his day, there is discernible, though only in the form of  cryptic hints, a fundamentally important progressive idea. It is that a  nobleman (chuen-tz[)u] should not be a member of the ruling _elite_ by  right of birth alone, but should be a man of superior moral qualities.  From Confucius on, \"chuen-tz[)u]\" became to mean \"a gentleman\".  Consequently, a country should not be ruled by a dynasty based on  inheritance through birth, but by members of the nobility who show  outstanding moral qualification for rulership. That is to say, the rule  should pass from the worthiest to the worthiest, the successor first  passing through a period of probation as a minister of state. In an  unscrupulous falsification of the tradition, Confucius declared that  this principle was followed in early times. It is probably safe to  assume that Confucius had in view here an eventual justification of  claims to rulership of his own.    Thus Confucius undoubtedly had ideas of reform, but he did not interfere  with the foundations of feudalism. For the rest, his system consists  only of a social order and a moral teaching. Metaphysics, logic,  epistemology, i.e. branches of philosophy which played so great a part  in the West, are of no interest to him. Nor can he be described as the  founder of a religion; for the cult of Heaven of which he speaks and  which he takes over existed in exactly the same form before his day. He  is merely the man who first systematized those notions. He had no  successes in his lifetime and gained no recognition; nor did his  disciples or their disciples gain any general recognition; his work did  not become of importance until some three hundred years after his death,  when in the second century B.C. his teaching was adjusted to the new  social conditions: out of a moral system for the decaying feudal society  of the past centuries developed the ethic of the rising social order of  the gentry. The gentry (in much the same way as the European  bourgeoisie) continually claimed that there should be access for every  civilized citizen to the highest places in the social pyramid, and the  rules of Confucianism became binding on every member of society if he  was to be considered a gentleman. Only then did Confucianism begin to  develop into the imposing system that dominated China almost down to the  present day. Confucianism did not become a religion. It was comparable  to the later Japanese Shintoism, or to a group of customs among us which  we all observe, if we do not want to find ourselves excluded from our  community, but which we should never describe as religion. We stand up  when the national anthem is played, we give precedency to older people,  we erect war memorials and decorate them with flowers, and by these and  many other things show our sense of belonging. A similar but much more  conscious and much more powerful part was played by Confucianism in the  life of the average Chinese, though he was not necessarily interested in  philosophical ideas.    While the West has set up the ideal of individualism and is suffering  now because it no longer has any ethical system to which individuals  voluntarily submit; while for the Indians the social problem consisted  in the solving of the question how every man could be enabled to live  his life with as little disturbance as possible from his fellow-men,  Confucianism solved the problem of how families with groups of hundreds  of members could live together in peace and co-operation in a densely  populated country. Everyone knew his position in the family and so, in a  broader sense, in the state; and this prescribed his rights and duties.  We may feel that the rules to which he was subjected were pedantic; but  there was no limit to their effectiveness: they reduced to a minimum the  friction that always occurs when great masses of people live close  together; they gave Chinese society the strength through which it has  endured; they gave security to its individuals. China's first real  social crisis after the collapse of feudalism, that is to say, after the  fourth or third century B.C., began only in the present century with the  collapse of the social order of the gentry and the breakdown of the  family system.    7 _Lao Tz[)u]_    In eighteenth-century Europe Confucius was the only Chinese philosopher  held in regard; in the last hundred years, the years of Europe's  internal crisis, the philosopher Lao Tz[)u] steadily advanced in repute,  so that his book was translated almost a hundred times into various  European languages. According to the general view among the Chinese, Lao  Tz[)u] was an older contemporary of Confucius; recent Chinese and  Western research (A. Waley; H.H. Dubs) has contested this view and  places Lao Tz[)u] in the latter part of the fourth century B.C., or even  later. Virtually nothing at all is known about his life; the oldest  biography of Lao Tz[)u], written about 100 B.C., says that he lived as  an official at the ruler's court and, one day, became tired of the life  of an official and withdrew from the capital"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11385"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 446, July 19, 1884 (#11)"],[1,"ereto, the excessive  electro-motive force of the latter overpowered the current from the  auxiliary battery and exerted, by means of a positive current, an  electro-chemical action upon the chemical receiving paper, producing a  mark.    Immediately upon the interruption of the circuit of the transmitting  battery, the unopposed current from the auxiliary battery at the  receiving station flowed back through the paper and into the main line,  thereby both neutralizing the residual or inductive current, which  tended to flow through the receiving instrument, and serving to clear  the main line from electro-static charge.    The following diagram illustrates my method:    Referring to this diagram, A and B respectively represent a transmitting  and a receiving station of an automatic telegraph. These stations are  united in the usual manner by a main line, L. At the transmitting  station, A, is placed a transmitting battery, E, having its positive  pole connected by a conductor, 2, with the metallic transmitting drum,  T. The negative pole of the battery, E, is connected with the earth at G  by a conductor, 1. A metallic transmitting stylus, t, rests upon the  surface of the drum, T, and any well known or suitable mechanism may be  employed for causing an automatic transmitting pattern slip, P, to pass  between the stylus and the drum. The transmitting or pattern slip, P, is  perforated with groups of apertures of varying lengths and intervals as  required to represent the dispatch which it is desired to transmit, by  an arbitrary system of signs, such, for example, as the Morse  telegraphic code.    At the receiving station, B, is placed a recording apparatus, M, of any  suitable or well known construction. A strip of chemically prepared  paper, N, is caused to pass rapidly and uniformly between the drum, M',  and the stylus, m, of this instrument in a well known manner. The drum,  M', is connected with the earth by conductors, 4 and 3, between which is  placed the auxiliary battery, E, the positive or marking pole of this  battery being connected with the drum and the negative pole with the  earth. The electro-motive force of the battery, E', is preferably made  about one-third as great as that of the battery, E.    [Illustration]    Extending from a point, o, in the main line, near the transmitting  station, to the earth at G, is a branch conductor, l, containing an  adjustable artificial resistance, R. A similar conductor, ll, extends  from a point, o', near the receiving terminal of the line, L, to the  conductor, 3, in which an artificial resistance, R', is also included,  this resistance being preferably approximately equal to the resistance,  R. The proportions of the resistance of the main line and the artificial  resistances which I prefer to employ may be approximately indicated as  follows: Assuming the resistance of the main line to be 900 ohms, the  resistance, R, and R', should be each about 3,000 ohms. The main  battery, E, should then comprise about 90 cells, and the auxiliary  battery, E', 30 cells.    The operation of my improved system is as follows: While the apparatus  is at rest a constant current from the battery, E', traverses the line,  L, and the branch conductors, l, and ll, dividing itself between them,  in inverse proportion to their respective resistances, in accordance  with the well-known law of Ohm. When the transmitting pattern strip, P,  is caused to pass between the roller, T, and the stylus, t, electric  impulses will be transmitted upon the line, L, from the positive pole of  the battery, E, which will traverse the main line, L, the two branch  lines, l, and ll, and their included resistances, and also the receiving  instrument, M. The greater portion of this current will, however, on  account of the less resistance offered, traverse the receiving  instrument, M, and the auxilary battery, E'. The current from the  last-named battery will thus be neutralized and overpowered, and the  excess of current from the main battery, E, will act upon the chemically  prepared paper and record in the form of dots and dashes or like  arbitrary characters the impulses which are transmitted.    Immediately on the cessation of each impulse, the auxiliary battery, E',  again acts to send an impulse of positive polarity through the receiving  paper and stylus in the reverse direction and through the line, L, which  returns to the negative pole of the battery by way of the artificial  resistances, R and R'. Such an impulse, following immediately upon the  interruption of the circuit of the transmitting battery, acts to destroy  the effect of the \"tailing\" or static discharge of the line, L, upon the  receiving instrument, and also to neutralize the same throughout the  line. By thus opposing the discharge of the line by a reverse current  transmitted directly through the chemical paper, a sharply defined  record will in all cases be obtained; and by transmitting the opposing  impulse through the line, the latter will be placed in a condition to  receive the next succeeding impulse and to record the same as a sharply  defined character.    This arrangement was made on the New York-Cleveland circuit, and the  characters were then clearly defined and of uniform distinctness. The  speed of transmission on this circuit was from 1,000 to 2,000 words per  minute.    Upon the completion of the wire to Chicago, total distance 1,050 miles,  including six miles of No. 8 iron wire through the city, the maximum  speed was found to be 1,200 words per minute, and to my surprise the  speed was not affected by the substitution of an underground conductor  for the overhead wire.    The underground conductor was a No. 16 copper wire weighing 67 pounds  per mile, in a Patterson cable laid through an iron pipe.    I used 150 cells of large Fuller battery on the New York-Chicago  circuit, and afterward with 200 cells in first class condition,  transmitted 1,500 words, or 37,000 impulses, per minute from 49  Broadway, New York, to our test office at Thirty-ninth Street, Chicago.    The matter was always carefully counted, and the utmost care taken to  obtain correct figures.    It may be mentioned as a curious fact that we not only send 1,200 words  per minute through 1,050 miles of overhead wire and five miles of  underground cable, but also through a second conductor in No. 2 cable  back to Thirty-ninth Street, and then connected to a third underground  conductor in No. 1 cable back to Chicago main office, in all about  fifteen miles of underground, through which we sent 1,200 words per  minute and had a splendid margin.--_Electrical World_.           *       *       *       *       *    [ELECTRICAL REVIEW].          THEORY OF THE ACTION OF THE CARBON MICROPHONE--WHAT IS IT?      A careful examination of the opinions of scientific men given in the  telephone cases--before Lord McLaren in Edinburgh and before Mr. Justice  Fry in London--leads me to the conclusion that scientific men, at least  those whose opinions I shall quote, are not agreed as to what is the  action of the carbon microphone.    In the Edinburgh case, Sir Frederick Bramwell said: \"The variations of  the currents are effected so as to produce with remarkable fidelity the  varied changes which occur, according as the carbon is compressed or  relieved from compression by the gentle impacts of the air set in motion  by the voice.\"    \"The most prominent quality of carbon is its capability, under the most  minute differences of pressure, to enormously increase or decrease the  resistances of the circuit.\" \"That the varying pressure of the black  tension-regulator (Edison's) is sufficient to cause a change in the  conducting power.\" Sir Frederick also said \"he could not believe that  the resistance was varied by a jolting motion; could not conceive a  jolting motion producing variation and difference of pressure, and such  an instrument could not be relied on, and therefore would be practically  useless.\"    Sir William Thomson, in the same case, said: \"The function of the carbon  is to give rise to diminished resistance by pressure; it possesses the  quality of, under slight degrees of pressure, decreasing the resistance  to the passage of the electric current;\" and, also, \"the jolting motion  would be a make-and-break, and the articulate sounds would be impaired.  There can be no virtue in a speaking telephone having a jolting motion.\"  \"Delicacy of contact is a virtue; looseness of contact is a vice.\"  \"Looseness of contact is a great virtue in Hughes' microphone;\" and \"the  elements which work advantages in Hughes' are detrimental to the good  working of the articulating instrument.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]    Mr. Falconer King said: \"There would be no advantage in having a jolting  motion; the jolting motion would break the circuit and be a defect in  the speaking telephone,\" and \"you must have pressure and partially  conducting substances.\"    Professor Fleeming Jenkin said, \"The pressure of the carbons is what  favors the transmission of sound.\"    All the above named scientific men agree that variations of a current  passing through a carbon microphone are produced by _pressure_ of the  carbons against one another, and they also agree that a jolting motion  could not be relied upon to reproduce articulate speech.    Mr. Conrad Cooke said, \"The first and most striking principle of Hughes'  microphone is a shaking and variable contact between the two parts  constituting the microphone.\" \"The shaking and variable contact is  produced by the movable portion being effected by sound.\" \"Under Hughes'  system, where gas carbon was used, the instruments could not possibly  work upon the principle of pressure.\" \"I am satisfied that it is not  pressure in the sense of producing a change of resistance.\" \"I do not  think pressure has anything to do with it.\"    Professor Blyth said: \"The Hughes microphone depends essentially upon  the looseness or"]]]
