Cocoa-nuts  are brought from the East Indies, as well as from the south-eastern  coast of Africa and the Somawly country, and may    [p.35] be had quite fresh, at low prices, during the monsoon. The people  of Djidda and Mekka appear to be very fond of them. The larger nuts, as  already mentioned, are used for the boury, or common Persian pipe, and  the smallest for snuff-boxes.    Soap comes from Suez, whither it is carried from Syria, which supplies  the whole coast of the Red Sea with it. The soap-trade is considerable,  and, for the greater part, in the hands of the merchants from Hebron,  (called in Arabic el Khalyl or the Khalylis,) who bring it to Djidda,  where some of them are always to be found. The almonds and raisins come  from Tayf and the Hedjaz mountains; large quantities of both are  exported, even to the East Indies. The almonds are of most excellent  quality; the raisins are small and quite black, but very sweet. An  intoxicating liquor is prepared from them.    Eighteen druggists. These are all natives of the East Indies, and mostly  from Surat. In addition to all kinds of drugs, they sell wax candles,  paper, sugar, perfumery, and incense; the latter is much used by the  inhabitants of the towns, where all the respectable families perfume  their best rooms every morning. Mastic and sandal-wood, burnt upon  charcoal, are most commonly used for this purpose. Spices of all sorts,  and heating drugs, are universally used in the Hedjaz. Coffee is rarely  drunk in private houses without a mixture of cardamoms or cloves; and  red pepper, from India or Egypt, enters into every dish. A considerable  article of trade among the druggists of Djidda and Mekka consists in  rose-buds, brought from the gardens of Tayf. The people of the Hedjaz,  especially the ladies, steep them in water, which they afterwards use  for their ablutions; they also boil these roses with sugar, and make a  conserve of them. The sugar sold in the drug-gists shops is brought  from India; it is of a yellowish white colour, and well refined, but in  powder. A small quantity of Egyptian sugar is imported, but the people  here do not like it; in general, they prefer every thing that comes from  India, which they conceive    [p.36] to be of a superior quality; in the same manner as English  produce and manufactures are preferred on the continent of Europe. The  Indian druggists are all men of good property; their trade is very  lucrative, and no Arabs can rival them in it. At Mekka, also, and at  Tayf, Medina, and Yembo, all the druggists are of Indian descent; and  although they have been established in the country for several  generations, and completely naturalized, yet they continue to speak the  Hindu language, and distinguish themselves in many trifling customs from  the Arabs, by whom they are in general greatly disliked, and accused of  avarice and fraud.    Eleven shops where small articles of Indian manufacture are sold, such  as china-ware, pipe-heads, wooden spoons, glass heads, knives, rosaries,  mirrors, cards, &c. These shops are kept by Indians, mostly from Bombay.  Very little European hardware finds its way hither, except needles,  scissors, thimbles, and files; almost every thing else of this kind  comes from India. The earthenware of China is greatly prized in the  Hedjaz. The rich inhabitants display very costly collections of it,  disposed upon shelves in their sitting-rooms, as may be remarked also in  Syria. I have seen, both at Mekka and Djidda, china dishes brought to  table, measuring at least two feet and a half in diameter, carried by  two persons, and containing a sheep roasted entire. The glass beads  exported from Djidda are chiefly for the Souakin and Abyssinian market;  they are partly of Venetian and partly of Hebron manufacture. The  Bedouin women of the Hedjaz likewise wear them; though bracelets, made  of black horn, and amber necklaces, seem to be more in fashion among  them. It is in these shops that the agate beads, called reysh, [See  Travels in Nubia, article Shendy.] are sold, which come from Bombay,  and are used in the very heart of Africa. A kind of red beads, made of  wax, are seen here in great quantities; they come from India, and are    [p.37] mostly destined for Abyssinia. Of rosaries, a great variety is  sold: those made of yoser [From this, the principal lane of Djidda is  called Hosh Yosser.] are the most costly; it is a species of coral which  grows in the Red Sea. The best sort is found between Djidda and Gonfode,  is of a deep black colour, and takes a fine polish. Strings of one  hundred beads each are sold at from one to four dollars, according to  their size. They are made by the turners of Djidda, and are much in  demand for the Malays. Other rosaries, (also brought from India,) made  of the odoriferous kalambac, and of the sandal-wood, are in great demand  throughout Egypt and Syria. Few pilgrims leave the Hedjaz without taking  from the holy cities same of these rosaries, as presents to their  friends at home.    Eleven clothes-shops. In these various articles of dress are sold every  morning by public auction. The greater part of those dresses are of the  Turkish fashion, adopted by merchants of the first and second classes,  with some trifling national variations in the cut of the clothes. During  the period of the Hadj, these shops are principally frequented for the  purchase of the Hiram or Ihram, that mantle in which the pilgrimage is  performed, and which consists generally of two long pieces of white  Indian cambric. Here, too, the Hedjaz Bedouins come to buy the woollen  abbas, or Bedouin cloaks, brought from Egypt, on which country they  entirely depend for this article; and thus they seem to possess the same  indolent character as most people of the Hedjaz; for it is customary  with the wives of other Bedouins to fabricate their own abbas. Here,  also, they bring Turkish carpets of an inferior quality, which form an  indispensable article of furniture for the tent of a Sheikh. In these  shops are likewise retailed all other imports from Egypt necessary for  dress, as mellayes, cotton quilts, linen for shirts, shirts dyed blue,  worn by the peasants, red and yellow slippers,    [p.38] used by the more opulent merchants, and by all the ladies, red  caps, all kinds of cloth dresses, second-hand cashmere shawls, muslin  shawls, &c. &c.    Six large shops of Indian piece-goods: French cloth, cashmere shawls,  &c. belonging to respectable merchants, whose clerks here sell by  retail. Almost all the principal merchants carry on also a retail  business in their own houses, except the great Indian merchants  established here, who deal in nothing but Indian piece-goods. The other  merchants of Djidda engage in every branch of commerce. I once saw the  brother of Djeylany quarrelling with a Yembo pedlar about the price of a  mellaye, worth about fifteen shillings; but this is the case also in  Egypt and Syria, where the most wealthy native merchants sell in retail,  and enter into all the minute details of business, and yet without  keeping any large establishment of clerks or accomptants, which their  mode of conducting business renders little necessary. A Turkish merchant  never keeps more than one accompt-book; into this he copies from a  pocket-book his weekly sales and purchases. They have not that extensive  correspondence which European merchants are obliged to keep up; and they  write much less, though perhaps more to the purpose, than the latter. In  every town with which they traffic, they have one friend, with whom they  annually balance accounts. Turkish merchants, with the exception of  those living in sea-ports, generally pursue but one branch of trade;  maintaining a correspondence with the town only from whence they obtain  their merchandize, and with that to which they transport it. Thus, for  instance, the great Baghdad merchants of Aleppo, men with from thirty to  forty thousand pounds in capital, receive goods from their friends at  Baghdad, and then send them from Aleppo to Constantinople. I have known  many of them who kept no clerk, but transacted the whole of their  business themselves. At Cairo, the Syrian merchants trade in the stuffs  of Damascus and Aleppo, and    [p.39] are altogether unconnected with the Maggrebin, Syria, and Djidda  merchants.    Mercantile transactions are farther simplified by the traders employing  chiefly their own capital, commission business being much less extensive  than it is in Europe. When a merchant consigns a considerable quantity  of goods to a place, he sends a partner with them, or perhaps a  relative, if he have no partner resident in the place. Ranking concerns  and bills of exchange are wholly unknown among the natives, which saves  them much trouble. In those towns where European factories are  established, bills may be found, but they are hardly current with the  natives, among whom assignments only are customary.    The practice followed equally by Mahomedan, Christian, and Jewish  merchants, in the East, of never drawing an exact balance of the actual  state of their capital, is another cause that renders the details of  book-keeping less necessary here than in Europe. For the same reason  that a Bedouin never counts the tents of his tribe, nor the exact number  of his sheep, nor a military chief the exact number of his men, nor a  governor the number of inhabitants of his town, a merchant never  attempts to ascertain the exact amount of his property; an approximation  only is all that be desires. This arises from a belief that counting is  an ostentatious display of wealth, which heaven will punish by a speedy  diminution.

Napoleon was glad of this garden-plot, for it gave him something which  he could call his own. He cared for it faithfully; but he wished to make  it even more secluded. He remembered his dear grotto at Ajaccio, and  studied over a plan to make his garden-plot just such a real retreat.  But it was not large enough for this. He looked about him. The boys to  whom belonged the garden-plots on either side of him were careless and  neglectful. Their gardens received no attention; they were overgrown  with weeds; their hedges were full of gaps and holes.    \"I will take them,\" said Napoleon; \"what one cannot care for, another  must.\"    So the boy went systematically to work to \"annex\" his neighbors'  kingdoms, and make from the three plots one ample retreat for himself.  He cut down the separating borders; he trimmed and trained and filled  in the stout outside hedge, until it completely surrounded his enlarged  domain; and, in the centre of the paths and flower-beds and hedges, he  put up a seat and a little summer-bower for his pleasure and protection.    It took some time to get this into shape, of course. When he had  completed it, and was beginning to enjoy it, the owners of the plots  he had confiscated awoke to a sense of their loss and the excellent  garden-spot this young Corsican had made for them. \"For of course,\" they  said, \"the garden-plots are ours. Straw Nose has improved them at his  own risk. What he has made we will keep for our own pleasure.\" So they  attempted to occupy their property; but with Napoleon there was force in  the old saying, \"Possession is nine points of the law.\"    When the dispossessed boys demanded their property, he refused it; when  they spoke of their rights, he laughed at them; and when they attempted  to enter the garden by force, he fell upon them, drove them flying from  the field, and pommelled them so soundly that they judged discretion to  be the better part of valor, and made no further attempt to disturb the  conqueror.    The other boys did attempt it, however, simply to tease and annoy the  fiery Corsican. But it always resulted in their own damage; for Napoleon  become so attached to his garden citadel, that he would grow furiously  angry whenever he was disturbed. Rushing out, he would rout his  assailants completely; until at last it was understood that it was  safest to let him alone.    As he sought his garden on this day of disgrace to which I have  referred, he was full of bitter thoughts against the unfriendly boys and  the unsympathetic teachers amid whom his lot was cast. Like most boys,  he determined to do something that should free him from this tyranny;  then, like many boys, he decided to run away. Where or how he could go  he did not know; for he had no friends in France who would help him  along, and he had no money in his pocket to enable him to help himself.    \"I will run away to sea,\" he said. For the sea, you know, is the first  thought of boys who determine to be runaways.    But Napoleon had a strong love for his family; he held high notions  in regard to the honor of the family name; above all else, he was  determined to do something that should help his family out of its sore  straits, and become one element of its support.    \"If I should run away to sea,\" he thought, \"I should bring discredit and  shame to my family: I should annoy my father, and seriously interfere  with my own plans. For, should I run away from Brienne, my father, who  has been at such pains to place me here, would be distressed, and  perhaps injured. No; I will brave it out. But I will write to my father,  asking him to take me away, and place me in some school where I shall  feel less like an outcast, where poverty would not be held as a crime,  and where I shall have more agreeable surroundings. So he went into his  garden fortress; he stretched himself at full length on his bench, and,  using the cover of his favorite book, Plutarch's \"Lives,\" as a desk, he  wrote this letter to his father:--    [Illustration: _Napoleon writing to his father_.]    \"MY FATHER,--If you or my protectors cannot give me the means of  sustaining myself more honorably in the house where I am, please summon  me home, and as soon as possible. I am tired of poverty, and of the  smiles of the insolent scholars who are superior to me only in their  fortune; for there is not one among them who feels one-hundredth part  of the noble sentiments by which I am animated. Must your son, sir,  continually be the butt of these boobies, who, vain of the luxuries  which they enjoy, insult me with their laughter at the privations I am  forced to endure? No, father; No! If fortune refuses to smile upon me,  take me from Brienne, and make me, if you will, a mechanic. From these  words you may judge of my despair. This letter, sir, please believe, is  not dictated by a vain desire to enjoy expensive amusements. I have no  such wish. I feel simply that it is necessary to show my companions that  I can procure them as well as they, if I wish to do so.    \"Your respectful and affectionate son,    \"BONAPARTE.\"      It took some time to write this letter; for, with Napoleon,  letter-writing was always a detested task.    When he had written and directed it, he felt better. We always do feel  relieved, you know, if we speak out or write down our feelings. Then he  read a chapter in Plutarch about Alexander the Great. This set him to  thinking and planning how he would win a battle if he should ever become  a leader and commander. He had a notion that he knew just what he would  do; and, to prove that his plan was good, he threw himself on the garden  walk, and gathering a lot of pebbles, he began to set them in array,  as if they were soldiers, and to make all the moves and marches and  counter-marches of a furious battle. He indicated the generals and chief  officers in this army of stone by the larger pebbles; and you may be  sure that the largest pebble of all represented the commander-in-chief  --and that was Napoleon himself.    As he marshalled his pebble army, under the lead of his generals and  officers, shifting some, advancing others, rearranging certain of them  in squares, and massing others as if to resist an attack, Napoleon was  conscious of a snickering sort of laugh from somewhere above him.    He looked up, and caught sight of a mocking face looking down at him  from the top of the hedge that bordered his garden.    \"Ho, ho! Straw-nose!\" the spy cried out; \"and what is the baby doing?  Is it playing with the pretty pebbles? Is it making mud-pies? It was a  sweet child, so it was.\"    Napoleon flushed with anger, enraged both at the intrusion and the  teasing.    \"Pig! imbecile!\" he cried; \"get down from my hedge, or I will make you!\"    \"Ho! hear the infant!\" came back the taunting answer. \"He will make  me--this pretty Corsican baby who plays with pebbles. He will make me!  That is good! I laugh; I--Oh, help! help! the Corsican has killed me!\"    [Illustration: \"_'Get down from my hedge' cried Napoleon_\"]    For a moment Napoleon thought indeed he had; for a moment, too, I am  afraid, he did not care. For so enraged was he at the boy's insults and  actions, that he had caught up his biggest pebble, which happened to  be Napoleon the general, and flung it at the intruder. It struck him  squarely between the eyes, and so stunned him that he fell back from the  hedge, and lay, first howling, and then terribly quiet, in the space  outside Napoleon's garden. At once there was a hue and cry; Napoleon was  summoned from his retreat, and dragged before his teacher.    \"Ah, miserable one!\" cried the master. \"And is it you again? You have  perhaps killed your fellow-student. You will yet end in the Bastille, or  on the block. Take him away, until we see what shall be the result of  the last ill-doing of this wicked one.\"    \"When one plays the spy and the bully one must expect retribution,\" said  Napoleon loftily. \"This Bouquet is a rascal who will be more likely to  end in the Bastille than I, who did but defend my own.\"    This language, of course, did not help matters; so into the school-cage,  or punishment \"lock-up\" for the school-boy offenders, young Napoleon was  at once hurried, without an opportunity for explanation or protest.          CHAPTER ELEVEN.    FRIENDS AND FOES.    Napoleon, the prisoner in the school \"lock-up,\" raged for a while like  a caged lion. Then he calmed down into the sulks, returned to his  determination to run away, concluded again that he would go to sea,  thought of his family and his duties once more, and at last concluded to  take his punishment without a word, though he knew that the boy who had  mocked him into anger deserved the punishment fully as much as did he  who had been the insulted one.    \"But then,\" he reasoned, \"he paid well for his taunts and teasing. I  wonder how he is now?\"    His schoolmate, the English boy, Lawley, was on duty outside the  \"lock-up\" door, as a sort of monitor.    \"Say, you Lawley!\" Napoleon called out, \"and how is that brute of a  Bouquet?\"    \"None the better for seeing you, little one,\" replied the good-natured  English boy, who had that love of fair play that is supposed to belong  to all Englishmen, and, therefore, felt that young Bonaparte was  suffering unjustly. Then he added:    \"Bouquet will no doubt die, and then what will you do?\"    \"I will plead self-defence, my friend,\" said Napoleon. \"Did not you tell  me that an English judge did once declare that a man's home was his  castle, which he was pledged to defend from invasion and assault. What  else is my garden? That brute of a Bouquet came spying about my castle,  and I did but defend myself. Is it not so?\"    \"It may be so to you, young Bonaparte,\" Lawley replied; \"but not to your  judges. No, little one, you're in for it now; they'll make you smart for  this, whatever"]]]
