The Blow seemed to have landed right on the Bump of Memory,  and put his Recollecting Department into full Operation again. He could  spot an Old Pal clear across the Street. He was rushing up to Obscure  Characters that he had not seen in Eight Years, and he called each one  of them \"Old Man.\" It was now their Turn to do the Forgetful Business.  The Tablets of his Memory read as clear as Type-Writing. Upon meeting  any Friend of his Boyhood he did the Shoulder-Slap, and rang in the Auld  Lang Syne Gag. He was so Democratic he was ready to Borrow from the  Humblest. The same Acquaintances who had tried to Stand In with him when  Things were coming his Way, were cutting off Street-Corners and getting  down behind their Newspapers to escape the Affectionate Massage,  beginning at the Hand and extending to the Shoulder-Blade. It was No  Use. He remembered them all, and no one got Past him.    MORAL: _Don't begin to Forget until you have it in Government Bonds._          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ HE-GOSSIP _AND THE_ MAN'S WIFE _AND THE_ MAN      Once upon a time there was a He-Gossip named Cyrenius Bizzy. Mr. Bizzy  was Middle-Aged and had a Set of dark Chinchillas. He carried a  Gold-Headed Cane on Sunday. His Job on this Earth was to put on a pair  of Pneumatic Sneakers every Morning and go out and Investigate Other  People's Affairs.    He called himself a Reformer, and he did all his Sleuthing in the line  of Duty.    If he heard of a Married Man going out Cab-Riding after Hours or playing  Hearts for Ten Cents a Heart or putting a Strange Woman on the Car, he  knew it was his Duty to edge around and slip the Information to some one  who would carry it to the Wife. He was such a Good Man himself that he  wanted all the other Men to wear long sable Belshazzars on the  Sub-Maxillary and come to him for Moral Guidance. If they would not do  it, the only Thing left for him to do was to Warn their Families now and  then and get them into Hot Water, thus demonstrating that the  Transgressor must expect Retribution to fall on him with quite a Crash.    Sometimes he would get behind a Board Fence to see the Wife of the  Postmaster break off a Yellow Rose and pass it over the Gate to the  Superintendent of the High School. Then he would Hustle out on his Beat  and ask People if they had heard the Talk that was Going Around. Of  course it Grieved him to be compelled to Peddle such Stories, but he had  to do it in the Interests of Morality. If Folks did not have a Pious  Protector to spot Worldly Sin and then get after it with a Sharp Stick,  the Community would probably go to the Dogs in less than no time. When  he had a Disagreeable Task to Perform, such as letting a Merchant know  that his Business Partner had been seen slightly Sprung at a Picnic, he  always wished to get through with it as quickly as possible, so usually  he Ran. He did not want any one else to beat him there, because the  Other Fellow might not get it Right.    [Illustration: THE SCANDAL]    Next Door to Cyrenius Bizzy there lived a Family that needed Regulating.  Cyrenius Bizzy knew that he had been Called to do the Regulating. The  Family had too much Fun to suit Cy. The Neighbor never came over to ask  Mr. Bizzy how late they had better Sit Up, or what Young Men the Girls  ought to invite to the House. Cyrenius would have been glad to fix up a  Set of Rules, for he was a Bureau of Advice, open at all Hours. He could  tell People just how much Money they ought to Save every Week, and how  often they ought to Lick the Children, and so on. But the Family that  lived Next Door made Loud Sport of Mr. Bizzy, and had no use for his  Counsel. They played Authors right in the Front Room with the Curtains  up, and they Danced the Two-Step so that he could be sure to see it from  where he was hidden behind the Evergreen Tree, and they ran the  Ice-Cream Freezer on Sunday Morning, and sang College Songs nearly every  Evening.    It kept the He-Gossip on the Go most of the time to let the Neighborhood  know all the Details of these Debauches. It did very little Good. The  Family did not want to be Reformed. He even wrote Anonymous Letters  telling them how Depraved they were. They were so Brazen and Hardened  they paid no Attention except to give him the Rowdy Hee-Ho when they saw  him pottering around the Shrubbery in his Front Yard, pretending to be  at Work, but really doing the Pinkerton Act, and keeping one Ear spread  for a nice, juicy Bit of Scandal.    [Illustration: THE HE-GOSSIP]    Mr. Bizzy watched the Family at all Hours of the Day and Night for many  Months. Although convinced that they were Children of Belial and pretty  Hard Nuts in general, he still hoped to Rescue them. He wondered if he  could not Appeal to the Man's Wife. She was a Daughter of Iniquity, all  right, but maybe she might listen to an Entreaty if it came from one who  was Pure, and who could point out to her in Fatherly Kindness that she  was leading her Family on a Short Cut to the Weeping and Wailing and  Gnashing of Teeth.    One Day Mr. Bizzy got a quiet Tip from another Moral Detective, that the  Man had stayed out until 2 A.M., at a Banquet given to a Militia  Company, so he knew it was Time for him to Act. He lay in Ambush until  the Coast was Clear, and then he went across the Dead-Line and caught  her on the Piazza. She was Surprised to see him.    He told her all the Reports he had heard about her Husband, and said he  was Sorry for her. He wondered if they couldn't get together a few of  the Respectable Men and Women of the Neighborhood, and have a Talk with  the Husband, and try to Pluck him as a Brand from the Burning. She  listened with that Ominous Calm which always precedes the Iowa Cyclone  that takes the Roof off the Court House and moves the Poor Farm into the  Adjoining County. She said she would take her Husband aside and have a  Confidential Chat with him, and if he wanted to be Plucked, then she  would call in the Cyrenius Bizzy Association of Pluckers.    The He-Gossip went Home feeling that he was entitled to a Pedestal right  in between Savonarola and Martin Luther.    When the Man came Home his Wife told him. He murmured something about  the Last Straw and moved swiftly out of doors. Pulling up the Rover  Stake from the Croquet Grounds as he ran, he cleared the Dividing Fence  without touching his Hands and began to Clean House. In about a Second  there was a Sound as if somebody had stubbed his Toe and dropped a  Crockery Store. Then Cyrenius was seen to Break the Record for the  Running Long Jump, off the Front Stoop into an Oleander Tub, while  wearing a Screen Door. After him came the Worldly Husband. For several  Minutes the Copse where once the Garden smiled was full of He-Gossip and  Cries for Help.    [Illustration: A MAN]    When the Man came back to where his Wife stood with her Hand on her  Heart, he reported that the He-Gossip would be found on top of the  Grape-Arbor.    MORAL: _Any one hoping to do Something in the Rescue Line had better go  further than Next Door._          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ AUTHOR WHO WAS SORRY _FOR_ WHAT HE DID _TO_ WILLIE      An Author was sitting at his Desk trying to pull himself together and  grind out Any Old Thing that could be converted into Breakfast Food. It  was his Off Day, however. His Brain felt as if some one had played a  Mean Trick on him and substituted a Side-Order of Cauliflower. All he  could do was to lean up against his Desk and make marks and Piffle his  Time away. Between Scribbles he wrote a few Verses about, \"When Willie  Came to say Good Night.\" It was a Sad Effort. He made it almost as Salty  as a Mother Song and filled it with Papa and Mamma and the Patter of  Baby Feet. He used Love-Light and the Evening Prayer and the  Heart-Strings and other venerable Paraphernalia. He had to commit  Infanticide to make it Weepy enough for the last Stanza. The Author  wrote this Stuff merely to Get Back at himself and see how Sloppy he  could be. He did not intend to Print it, because he was not a Vendor of  Death-Beds, and he shrank from making any violent Assault on the  Sensibilities. So he tossed the Idle Product into the Waste-Basket and  wondered if he was biginning to lose his Mind. With that Poem in his  Right Hand he could have walked into Bloomingdale and no Questions  Asked.    While he was still Backing Up and Jockeying for a Fair Start at his  Day's Work, A Friend came in and sat on the Edge of the Desk, and told  him to go right ahead and not pay any Attention.    Seeing the Crumpled Paper in the Basket, the Friend, who was  Inquisitive, hooked it out and read the Lines. Presently, when the  Author looked up, the Friend had big Tears rolling down his Cheeks and  was Sniffling.    \"This is the Best Thing you have ever done,\" said the Friend. \"My God,  but it is Pathetic! It will certainly Appeal to any one who has lost a  Child.\"    \"I have no desire to Manufacture any more Sorrow for the Bereaved,\" said  the Author. \"They have had Trouble enough. If I have to deal in White  Caskets or tap the Lachrymal Glands in order to thrash out an Income, I  will cease being an Author and go back to Work.\"    \"But this Poem will touch any Heart,\" insisted the Friend. \"As soon as I  got into it I began to Cry. You can get a Good Price for this.\"    When it came down to a Business Basis, the Author Switched.    \"Get what you can on it,\" he said. \"It seems a Shame to go and Market  that kind of Scroll-Work; still if it hits you, it may be Bad enough to  affect others having the same Shape of Head. I need the Money and I have  no Shame.\"    Thereupon the Friend sent the Verses to the Publisher of a Family  Monthly that Percolates into every Postoffice in the Country. In a few  Days there came a tear-stained Acceptance and a Check. The Author said  it was just like Finding $22.50, and he thought that was the End of it.

So  on the day fixed after everyone was asleep Kuwar went to the tree and  almost at once the princess came to him riding on Piyari; he asked  her how she had escaped and whether she had been seen and she told  him how the mare had jumped over the wall without anyone knowing;  then they both mounted Piyari and drove her like the wind and in one  night they passed through the territory of two or three Rajas and in  the morning were in a far country.    Then they dismounted to cook their rice, and went to the house of an  old woman to ask for a light with which to light their fire. Now this  old woman had seven sons and they were all robbers and murderers;  and six of them had killed travellers and carried off their wives  and married them. When Kuwar and the princess came asking for a  light the seven sons were away hunting and when the old woman saw  the princess she resolved to marry her to her youngest son, and made  a plan to delay them; so she asked them to cook their rice at her  house and offered them cooking pots and water pots and firewood and  everything necessary; they did not know that she meant to kill Kuwar  and unsuspiciously accepted her offer. When they had finished cooking  Kuwar asked the old woman whether she lived alone and she told him  that she was a widow but had seven sons and they were all away on a  trading expedition. The old woman kept on looking out to see if her  sons were returning, and she had made an arrangement with them that if  she ever wanted them she would set fire to a small hut and they would  come home at once when they saw the smoke rising. But before her sons  came back Kuwar and the princess finished their meal and paid the old  woman and mounted Piyari and gallopped off. Then the old woman set fire  to the hut and her sons, seeing the smoke hurried home. She told them  that a beautiful girl had just left who would make a suitable wife for  the youngest of the brothers. Then the brothers tied on their swords  and mounted their horses and went in pursuit. Kuwar and the princess  knew nothing of their danger and rode on happily, but presently they  heard horses neighing behind them and looking round, saw men riding  after them with drawn swords. Then the princess said to Kuwar \"Our  enemies are upon us; do you sit in front and let me sit behind you,  then they will kill us both together. If I am in front they may kill  you alone and carry me off alive.\" But while they were thinking of  this the seven brothers caught them up, and began to abuse them and  charge them with having set fire to the house in which they had eaten  their rice, and told them to come back with them at once. Kuwar and  the princess were too frightened to answer and they had no sword with  which to defend themselves. Then the robbers surrounded them and killed  Kuwar, and they said to the princess \"You cannot stay here all alone;  we will take you back and you shall marry one of us.\" The princess  answered \"Kill me here at once, never will I go with you.\" They said  \"We shall take away your horse and all your food, will not that make  you go?\" But the princess threw herself on the dead body of Kuwar  and for all they could do they could not drag her off it. Then the  murderers said to the youngest brother \"She is to be your wife: you  must pull her away.\" But he refused saying \"No, if I take her away she  will not stay with me, she will probably hang herself or drown herself;  I do not want a wife like that, if any of you want her, you can have  her.\" But they said that it would not be right for one of them to take  a second wife while their youngest brother was unmarried, and that  their mother intended him to marry this girl; if he would not they  would kill her there and then. But the youngest brother had pity on  her and asked them to spare her life, so they took away her horse and  her food and everything that she had and went away and left her there.    For a day and a night the princess lay there weeping and lamenting  her dead Kuwar and never ceased for a moment. Then Chando said \"who  is this who is weeping and what has happened to her?\" And he sent  Bidhi and Bidha to see what was the matter; they came and told him  that a princess was weeping over the body of her dead husband and  would not leave him though she had been robbed of everything she had.    Then Chando told them to go and frighten her, and if they could  frighten her away from her husband's dead body he would do nothing, but  if she would not leave him then they were to restore him to life. So  they went and found her holding the dead body of her husband In her  lap and weeping; and they first assumed the form of tigers and began  to circle round her roaring, but she only went on weeping and sang--          \"You have come roaring, tigress:      First eat me, tigress:      Then only will I let you eat the body of my lord.\"      She would not quit the body nor run away from fear of the tigers,  so they slunk away and came back in the form of two leopards, and  prowled round her growling; but she only sang          \"You have come roaring, leopardess      First eat me, leopardess      Then only will I let you eat the body of my lord.\"      and as she would not fly from them they slunk away and came back  in the form of two bears, but the princess only sang the same song;  then they appeared as two elephants; and then as two huge snakes which  hissed terribly but still she only wept; and in many forms they tried  to frighten her away but she would not move nor leave the corpse of  Kuwar, so in the end they saw that all the heart of the princess was  with Kuwar and that even in death they could not be separated, so at  last they drew near to her in the form of human beings and asked her  why she was crying, as they had heard her weeping from a long way off,  and had been filled with pity for her lamentations. Then the princess  said \"Alas, this youth and I are from such and such a country and  as we loved and our lives were bound up in each other we ran away  together hither, and here on the road he has been killed and the  murderers have left me without my horse or food; and this is why I  weep.\" Then Bidhi and Bidha said \"Daughter, rise up and we will take  you to your home, or we will find you another husband; this one is  dead and cannot be restored to you; you will find another; come arise,  you have but one life,\" But the princess answered \"No I will not go  and leave him here. I will not leave him while my life lasts; but I  pray you if you know of any medicine that might restore him to life,  to try it.\" Then they answered \"We know something of medicine and  if you wish we will try to cure him;\" so saying, they ground up some  simples and told the princess to spread out a cloth and lay the dead  body on it and to put the head which had been cut off into position,  and then to cover it with the cloth and hold the head in position;  so she did as they bade, and they rubbed the medicine on the body  and then they suddenly disappeared from her sight.    Then in a few moments she saw Kuwar's chest heave as if he were  breathing; thereupon she shook him violently and he rose up and said  \"Oh, what a long time I have slept,\" but the princess said \"Do not  talk of sleep; you were killed and two men appeared from somewhere  and applied medicine and brought you to life again;\" then Kuwar asked  where they were and she told him how they had disappeared without  her knowledge.    Then they rose up and went in search of food to a village where  there was a bazar, and they tried to get employment as servants;  but the people advised them to go to the capital city where the Raja  lived, and there if no one would take them as servants they could get  employment as coolies on a big tank which the Raja was excavating. So  they went there, and as they could not get employment as servants they  went to work at the tank with the common coolies and were paid their  wages at the end of the week and so managed to live. Kuwar's desire  was to somehow save five or six rupees and then build a little house  for themselves.    Now although the tank had been dug very deep there were no signs of  any water. Then the Raja ordered the centre post to be planted in  hopes that this would make the water rise; and he told the coolies  not to run away as he would make a feast to celebrate the making of  the tank and would distribute presents among them, and at this the  labourers were very pleased.    Now Kuwar's wife was very fair to see and the Raja saw her and fell  in love with her and made a plot to get possession of her. So when  the centre post had been planted and still no water came he said  \"We must see what sacrifice is required to make the water come. I  have animals of all kinds; one by one they shall be offered and you  shall sing and dedicate them.\" So first an elephant was led down into  the bed of the tank and the people sang          \"Tank, we will sacrifice to you an elephant      Let clear water bubble up, O tank,\"      but no water came.    Then they led down a horse and sang a similar song, but no water came;  and then in succession a camel, a donkey, a cow, a buffalo, a goat and  a sheep were offered but no water came; and so they stopped. Then  the Raja asked why they stopped and they said that they had no  more animals. Then the Raja bade them sing a song dedicating a man,  to see if that would bring the water; so they sang and as they sang  water bubbled up everywhere from the bottom of the tank and then the  coolies were stricken with fear for they did not know which of them  would be sacrificed.    But the Raja sent his soldiers and they seized Kuwar and bound him  to the post in the middle of the tank; and then a song was sung  dedicating him to the tank and as the water rose around him the  princess wept bitterly; but the Raja said \"Do not cry I will arrange  for your support and will give you part of"]]]
