Likewise,  the pan beneath the burners, which may be removed, should be cleaned  very frequently, and the entire stove should be wiped each time it is  used, for the better such a stove is taken care of, the better will it  continue to do its work.    [Illustration: Fig. 7]    71. FIRELESS-COOKING GAS STOVES.--A style of gas stove that meets with  favor in many homes is the so-called fireless-cooking gas stove, one  style of which is shown in Fig. 7. Such a stove has the combined  advantages of a fireless cooker, which is explained later, and a gas  stove, for it permits of quick cooking with direct heat, as well as slow  cooking with heat that is retained in an insulated chamber, that is, one  that is sufficiently covered to prevent heat from escaping. In  construction, this type of stove is similar to any other gas stove,  except that its oven is insulated and it is provided with one or more  compartments for fireless cooking, as at _a_ and _b_. Each of these  compartments is so arranged that it may be moved up and down on an  upright rod, near the base of which, resting on a solid plate _c_, is a  gas burner _d_, over which the insulated hood of the compartment fits.  When it is desired to cook food in one of these compartments, the hood  is raised, as at _b_, and the gas burner is lighted. The food in the  cooker is allowed to cook over the lighted burner until sufficient heat  has been retained or the process has been carried sufficiently far to  permit the cooking to continue without fire. Then the insulated hood is  lowered until the compartment is in the position of the one shown at  _a_. It is not necessary to turn off the gas, as this is done  automatically when the hood is lowered.      KEROSENE STOVES AND THEIR OPERATION    [Illustration: Fig. 8]    72. As has been mentioned, kerosene is used considerably as a fuel in  localities where gas cannot be obtained. Kerosene stoves are not unlike  gas stoves, but, as a rule, instead of having built-in ovens, they are  provided with portable ovens, which are heated by placing them on top of  the stove, over the burners. Such stoves are of two types, those in  which cotton wicks are used, as in oil lamps, and those which are  wickless, the former being generally considered more convenient and  satisfactory than the latter. In Fig. 8 is shown a three-burner kerosene  stove of the first type mentioned. Oil for the burners, or lamps, _a_ is  stored in the container _b_, which may be of glass or metal, and it is  supplied to the reservoir of each burner by the pipe _c_. Each burner is  provided with a door _d_, which is opened when it is desired to light  the wick. The flame of each burner is controlled by the screw _e_, which  serves to raise or lower the wick, and the heat passes up to the opening  _f_ in the top of the stove through the cylindrical pipe above the  burner. The arrangement of a wickless kerosene stove is much the same as  the one just described, but it is so constructed that the oil, which is  also stored in a tank at the side, flows into what is called a burner  bowl and burns from this bowl up through a perforated chimney, the  quantity of oil used being regulated by a valve attached to each bowl.    73. The burners of kerosene stoves are lighted by applying a match, just  as the burners of a gas stove are lighted. In some stoves, especially  those of the wickless type, the burners are so constructed that the  flame can rise to only a certain height. This is a good feature, as it  prevents the flame from gradually creeping up and smoking, a common  occurrence in an oil stove. The kerosene-stove flame that gives the most  heat, consumes the least fuel, and produces the least soot and odor is  blue in color. A yellow flame, which is given off in some stoves,  produces more or less soot and consequently makes it harder to keep the  stove clean. Glass containers are better than metal containers, because  the water that is always present in small quantities in kerosene is apt  to rust the metal container and cause it to leak. To prevent the  accumulation of dirt, as well as the disagreeable odor usually present  when an oil stove is used, the burners should be removed frequently and  boiled in a solution of washing soda; also, if a wick is used, the  charred portion should be rubbed from it, but not cut, as cutting is  liable to make it give off an uneven flame.    [Illustration: FIG. 9]      ELECTRIC STOVES AND UTENSILS    74. ELECTRIC STOVES. Electric stoves for cooking have been perfected to  such an extent that they are a great convenience, and in places where  the cost of electricity does not greatly exceed that of gas they are  used considerably. In appearance, electric stoves are very similar to  gas stoves, as is shown in Fig. 9, which illustrates an electric stove  of the usual type. The oven _a_ is located at one side and contains a  broiler pan _b_. On top of this stove are openings for cooking, into  which fit lids _c_ that have the appearance of ordinary stove lids, but  are in reality electrical heating units, called hotplates. Heat for  cooking is supplied by a current of electricity that passes through the  hotplates, as well as through similar devices in the oven, the stove  being connected to the supply of electricity at the connection-box _d_,  which is here shown with the cover removed. The heat of the different  hotplates and the oven is controlled by several switches _e_ at the  front of the stove. Each of these switches provides three degrees of  heat--high, medium, and low--and just the amount of heat required for  cooking can be supplied by turning the switch to the right point. Below  the switches are several fuse plugs _f_ that contain the fuses, which  are devices used in electrical apparatus to avoid injury to it in case  the current of electricity becomes too great.    [Illustration: Fig. 10]    It is not absolutely necessary to have flue connections for an electric  stove, as such a stove does not require a draft and gives off no  products of combustion to be carried away. In fact, one of the favorable  points about an electric stove is that it produces no dirt and causes no  inconvenience. When the cooking is done, the electricity can be turned  off, after which the stove quickly cools. When electricity is used for  cooking, cooking utensils, methods, and recipes can be applied in the  same ways as when other means of producing heat are employed.    [Illustration: Fig. 11]    75. SMALL ELECTRIC UTENSILS.--In addition to electric stoves, there are  a number of smaller electrical cooking utensils that can be attached to  an electric-light socket or a wall socket. Among these are percolators,  toasters, hotplates, or grills, chafing dishes, egg poachers, and  similar devices. An idea of such utensils for cooking may be formed by  referring to Fig. 10, which shows an electric toaster, and Fig. 11,  which shows a hotplate, or grill. The toaster is arranged so that bread  to be toasted may be placed on each side, as well as on top, of an  upright part that gives off heat when the current of electricity is  turned on. The grill is so constructed that a pan for cooking may be  placed under and on top of the part that gives off heat.           *       *       *       *       *    ESSENTIALS OF COOKERY (PART 1)    EXAMINATION QUESTIONS    (1) Give in its full sense the meaning of the term cookery.

While success in cooking, as has been pointed out, depends to a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9938"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery. Volume 4: Salads and Sandwiches; Cold and (#10)"],[1," purpose. When bread is being made for  sandwiches, a good plan is to give the dough a little additional  kneading and, toward the end of the kneading, to work in a small amount  of flour, perhaps a little extra sugar, and, if desired, an egg. Then,  if it is not allowed to rise as much as usual, it will make a bread that  is finer in texture and easier to handle.    103. UTENSILS FOR SANDWICH MAKING.--Very few utensils are required for  the making of sandwiches, but those which are used must be of the right  kind if well-made sandwiches are desired. To cut the bread, a large  sharp knife must be used, for, generally, the bread is required to be  cut thin and this cannot be done successfully unless the knife is  sufficiently sharp. In addition, a case knife or a small spatula is  needed for the spreading of the bread. If sandwiches in any quantity are  to be spread with a filling besides butter, two case knives or a case  knife and a spatula should be provided.    104. MAKING SANDWICHES.--The point that should be remembered about  sandwiches is that they should be as dainty as possible. Therefore, the  [Illustration: Fig 21] bread should usually be cut thin and the crust  should be removed. If a large number of sandwiches are to be made, it is  often a good idea to remove the crust from the loaf, as shown in Fig.  20, before slicing the bread. More frequently, however, the cutting is  done first, as in Fig. 21. Then after the bread is spread, the crust is  removed from a pile of slices at a time. A little difficulty will be  experienced in making sandwiches unless care is taken in matching the  slices. After being cut, they should be laid out in pairs with  corresponding sides together, so that when they are spread two pieces  that do not fit will not have to be put together.    [Illustration: Fig. 22]    The plan of spreading the end of the loaf and then slicing off the piece  that is spread is sometimes advocated, but it is not recommended, for it  has no special advantage and then, too, the bread is difficult to handle  after it has been spread.    105. No matter what kind of filling is to be used for sandwiches, the  slices are usually buttered before the filling is applied. To make the  butter soft enough to spread easily, it should be creamed with a spoon,  as shown in Fig. 22, but it should never be melted. With the bread  sliced and the butter creamed, one of a pair of slices should be spread  with butter, as in Fig. 23, and the other with filling, and then the two  slices should be put together. After a number of sandwiches have been  made, they should be placed on top of one another and, as shown in Fig.  24, the crusts should be cut from a small pile at one time.    [Illustration: Fig. 23]    Sometimes, if sandwiches are being made in quantity, the butter is  worked into the filling instead of being spread on the bread. As this  plan saves time and does not detract from the food value of the  sandwich, it may be followed whenever it seems advisable.    106. Variety can be obtained from time to time in the shapes of  sandwiches by cutting the bread in different ways. For instance, one  time it may be cut into strips lengthwise, another time into halves  crosswise, and again, diagonally, so as to form triangular pieces. To  vary the sandwich filling, a lettuce leaf may be placed on the buttered  slice of the bread and the slice containing the filling put on top of  this. Lettuce used in this way makes a delightful addition to cheese,  meat, egg, or vegetable sandwiches.    [Illustration: Fig. 24]    107. It is often necessary to make sandwiches some time before they are  to be served. In such an event, they should be kept moistened so that  they will be fresh when they are served. To accomplish this, they may be  wrapped first in oiled paper and then in a damp towel, or if oiled  paper is not in supply, the towel alone will answer the purpose,  provided it is not made too damp and a dry towel is wrapped on  the outside.           *       *       *       *       *      PREPARATION OF SANDWICHES    BREAD-AND-BUTTER SANDWICHES    108. Often it is desired to serve bread and butter with a certain dish  and yet something more is wanted than just two pieces of bread spread  with butter and put together. While bread-and-butter sandwiches are  probably the simplest kind that can be made, variety can be obtained in  them if the housewife will exercise a little ingenuity. Fig. 25 shows  what can be done in the way of bread-and-butter sandwiches with very  little effort, for the two plates on the left contain sandwiches made  merely of bread and butter.    [Illustration: Fig. 25]    109. ROUND SANDWICHES.--The round sandwiches on the rear left plate in  Fig. 25 can be made of brown bread or of white bread, or both varieties  may be served in the event that some one does not care for brown bread.  To make these, cut slices of bread from a loaf and, by means of a round  cutter, cut them round in shape. Out of the top slice of each sandwich,  cut a round hole with a small round cutter or a thimble. After spreading  both slices with butter and placing them together, cut a thick slice  from a stuffed olive and insert this in the hole in the top slice.    110. RIBBON SANDWICHES.--The sandwiches on the plate in front in Fig.  25 are known as ribbon sandwiches. To make these, cut white bread and  graham bread in very thin slices, butter them, and then alternate a  slice of white with a slice of graham until there are three or four  layers. Place the pile under a weight until the butter becomes hard and  then cut down in thin slices. The attractive sandwiches here shown will  be the result.    111. CHECKERBOARD SANDWICHES.--Another way of serving bread and butter  is in the form of checkerboard sandwiches. These are no more difficult  to make than the ribbon sandwiches, but the slices of the bread must be  cut evenly and all must be of the same thickness. In addition, the bread  should be firm and close-grained and the butter should be put on thickly  enough to make the slices of bread stick together. Cut three slices each  of graham bread and white bread 1/2 inch in thickness. Spread one side  of each slice thickly with butter. Place a slice of graham between two  slices of white bread and a slice of white between two slices of graham.  Trim these piles evenly and cut them into 1/2-inch slices. Butter these  slices and put them together so that brown bread will alternate with  white and white with brown. Place the slices under a weight in a cool  place until the butter becomes perfectly hard. Then cut them into thin  slices for serving and they will be found to resemble a checkerboard.      VEGETABLE SANDWICHES    112. Certain vegetables may be used with bread and butter to make very  appetizing sandwiches. The vegetables most often used for this purpose  are lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, celery, and onions. Generally, when  vegetables are to be used for sandwich filling, the sandwiches should be  made immediately before they are to be served, as they are apt to become  moist if they are allowed to stand very long. An exception to this is  celery sandwiches, which are made in the form of rolls and which must  stand piled close together for some time in order for the butter to  become hard enough to stick them together.    113. LETTUCE SANDWICHES.--Cut white bread into slices about 1/4 inch  thick and spread these thinly with butter. Place a leaf or two of tender  lettuce between each two slices and spread with thick salad dressing.  Put the slices of bread together, trim off the edges of the lettuce and  the crusts if desired, and serve.    114. TOMATO SANDWICHES.--Slice bread about 1/4 inch thick and spread the  slices with butter. Peel firm red tomatoes and cut them into thin  slices. Cover one slice of bread with a slice of tomato, spread this  with thick salad dressing, and, if desired, place a lettuce leaf over  this. Cover with a second slice of bread, trim the edges, and serve.    115. CUCUMBER SANDWICHES.--Peel and slice into thin slices a  medium-sized cucumber that does not contain large seeds. Place the  slices in very cold water to make them crisp. Slice bread about 1/4 inch  thick and spread the slices with butter. Place thin slices of cucumber  on one piece, spread with thick salad dressing, and put a lettuce leaf  on top of this, if desired. Cover with the second slice of bread, trim  the edges, and serve.    [Illustration: Fig. 26]      116. ROLLED CELERY SANDWICHES.--Cut 1/4-inch slices from a comparatively  fresh loaf of bread. Trim the crusts and spread with butter. Cut the  stems of tender celery into pieces that are as long as the bread is  wide. Place the celery on one edge of the bread, fill the center of the  stem with salad dressing, and roll the celery into the bread like a  jelly roll. Place a moist napkin in the bottom of a bread pan and stack  the rolls in rows, with the loose edge down, so that they will stay  rolled. When all have been placed in the pan, fold the edges of the  napkin across the top and allow them to stand for a few hours before  serving. This cannot be done with bread that is dry. If the sandwiches  are to be served at once, the edges will have to be tied or fastened  with toothpicks.    In case it is desired not to use celery in rolled sandwiches, a filling  of cream cheese or jam may be added after the bread is buttered and each  piece then rolled in the manner explained. An idea of how attractive  rolled sandwiches are may be obtained from Fig. 26. When served in a  decorated sandwich basket, as shown, these sandwiches give a very dainty  touch to a luncheon or a tea.    117. ONION-AND-PEPPER SANDWICHES.--Cut bread into slices about 1/4 inch  thick and spread these with butter. Slice Spanish or Bermuda onions into  thin slices and cut a green pepper into thin rings. Place a slice of the  onion on one piece of buttered bread and on top of this put two or three  rings of "]]]
