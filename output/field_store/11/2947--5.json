Fish were more  abundant here than in any port before visited; those taken in the seine  at the watering beach were principally mullet, but sharks and flying fish  were numerous.    The _latitude_ of the north-west end of Entrance Island, from an  observation taken by lieutenant Flinders in an artificial horizon, is 22 deg.  28' 28\" south.    _Longitude_ from twelve sets of lunar distances by the same officer, 150 deg.  47' 54\"; and by the time keepers, 150 deg. 45' 36\"; but from the fifty sets  which fix Broad Sound, and the reduction from thence by survey, the more  correct situation will be 150 deg. 45' 0\" east.    _Dip_ of the south end of the needle, 50 deg. 20'.    _Variation_ from azimuths with the theodolite, 7 deg. 40' east; but on the  top of the island, where my bearings were taken, the variation appeared  to be 8 deg. 30' east; and 8 deg. in other parts of the port.    The time of high water, as near as it could be ascertained, was _ten  hours after_ the moon's passage over and under the meridian, being half  an hour later than in Keppel Bay; and the tide rises more than nine feet,  but how much was not known; it is however to be presumed, from what was  observed to the south and to the north of Port Bowen, that the spring  tides do not rise less than fifteen feet.    TUESDAY 24 AUGUST 1802    At daylight of the 24th, we steered out of Port Bowen by the northern  passage, as we had gone in. The wind was from the westward; but so light,  that when the ebb tide made from the north-west at ten o'clock, it was  necessary to drop the kedge anchor for a time. In the evening we came to,  in 10 fathoms fine grey sand, one mile and a half from the main; being  sheltered between N. E. by E. and E. by S. by the same cluster of small  isles upon which the pine trees had been first seen. In the morning  [WEDNESDAY 25 AUGUST 1802] we worked onward along the coast, against a  breeze at north-west, till ten o'clock; when the tide being unfavourable,  an anchor was dropped in 15 fathoms, sand and shells, near three islets,  of which the middlemost and highest bore S. 29 deg. E., one mile: these were  also a part, and the most northern of Harvey's Isles.    A boat was lowered down, and I landed with the botanical gentlemen on the  middle islet; where we found grass and a few shrubs, and also ants,  grasshoppers, and lizards. Upon the rocks were oysters of the small,  crumply kind, which seemed to indicate that the sea here is not violently  agitated; and in the water we saw several large turtle, but were not able  to harpoon any of them. Several of the Northumberland Isles were in sight  from the top of the islet, and the following observations were taken.    Latitude, observed in artificial horizon, 22 deg. 20' 42\"  Longitude, deduced from survey,          150  42  Peaked Islet in the offing bore        S. 35  35 E.  Island Head, distant 3 miles,          S. 82  45 W.  Cape Townshend, the rock near it,      N. 57  45 W.  Northumberland Isle, the 4th, a peak,  N. 43  30 W.    When the tide slacked in the afternoon we stretched over towards Island  Head, and saw a canoe with two Indians, who made for the shore near a  place where the woods were on fire. At dusk we anchored in 18 fathoms,  soft mud, in a bight between Island Head and Cape Townshend, at the  bottom of which was an opening one mile wide, where captain Cook had  suspected an entrance into Shoalwater Bay. The Lady Nelson had fallen to  leeward, as usual; and not being come up in the morning [THURSDAY 26  AUGUST 1802], the master was sent ahead of the ship in a boat, and we  steered for the opening with a strong flood tide in our favour. From 22  fathoms, the water shoaled to 12, and suddenly to 3, on a rocky bottom,  just as we reached the entrance. A kedge anchor was dropped immediately;  but seeing that the opening went through, and that the master had deep  water further in, it was weighed again, and we backed and filled the  sails, drifting up with the tide so long as it continued to run. At nine  o'clock the anchor was let go in 6 fathoms, sand and shells, one mile  within the entrance, the points of which bore N. 34 deg. and S. 89 deg. E.; but  the extent of deep water was barely sufficient for the ship to swing at a  whole cable.    [EAST COAST. STRONG-TIDE PASSAGE.]    (Atlas, Plate XI.)    Lieutenant Flinders landed on the north side of the entrance, and  observed the latitude 22 deg. 17' 53', from an artificial horizon; and a boat  was sent to haul the seine upon a beach on the eastern shore, where fish  to give half the ship's company a meal was procured. We had no prospect  of advancing up the passage until the turn of tide, at three in the  afternoon; and I therefore landed with a party of the gentlemen, and  ascended the highest of the hills on the eastern side. From the top of it  we could see over the land into Port Bowen; and some water was visible  further distant at the back of it, which seemed to communicate with  Shoal-water Bay. Of the passage where the ship was lying, there was an  excellent view; and I saw not only that Cape Townshend was on a distinct  island, but also that it was separated from a piece of land to the west,  which captain Cook's chart had left doubtful. Wishing to follow the  apparent intention of the discoverer, to do honour to the noble family of  Townshend, I have extended the name of the cape to the larger island, and  distinguish the western piece by the name of _Leicester Island_. Besides  these, there were many smaller isles scattered in the entrance of  Shoal-water Bay; and the southernmost of them, named _Aken's Island_  after the master of the ship, lies in a bight of the western shore. Out  at sea there were more of the Northumberland Islands, further westward  than those before seen, the largest being not less distant than fifteen  leagues; Pier Head, on the west side of Thirsty Sound, was also visible;  and in the opposite direction was the highest of the two peaks behind  Cape Manifold, the bearing of which connected this station with Port  Curtis and Keppel Bay. The view was, indeed, most extensive from this  hill; and in compliment to the landscape painter, who made a drawing from  thence of Shoal-water Bay and the islands, I named it Mount Westall.* The  bearings most essential to the connection of the survey, were these;      Pier Head, the northern extreme,           N. 62 deg. 40' W.  Aken's Island in Shoal-water Bay,          N. 86  55  W.  Pine Mount, on its west side,              S. 80  40  W.  Double Mount,                              S. 56  35  W.  Cape Manifold., highest peak behind it,    S. 20  10  E.  West-water Head in Port Bowen,             S. 30  25  E.  Northern Harvey's Isles, last station,     N. 81  20  E.  Cape Townshend, north-east extreme,        N. 20  25  W.  Northumberland Isles, the 4th, a peak,     N. 26  25  W.      [* A painting was made of this view, and is now in the Admiralty; but it  has not been engraved for the voyage.]    Mount Westall and the surrounding hills are stony, and of steep ascent;  pines grow in the gullies, and some fresh water was found there, standing  in holes. The lower hills are covered with grass and trees, as is also  the low land, though the soil be shallow and sandy; the wood is mostly  _eucalyptus_. No natives were seen during our walk, and only one  kangaroo.    At dusk in the evening, when we returned on board, I found the Lady  Nelson at anchor near us, and two boats absent from the ship. In hauling  them up to be hoisted in, the cutter had been upset from the rapidity of  the tides, which ran above four knots, the man in her was thrown out, and  the boat went adrift. The man was taken up by the Lady Nelson; but the  boatswain, who with two men in a small gig had gone after the cutter, was  not heard of till next morning [FRIDAY 27 AUGUST 1802], when he returned  without any intelligence of his object, having been bewildered in the  dark by the rapid tides in a strange place, and in danger of losing  himself.    [EAST COAST. SHOAL-WATER BAY.]    On weighing the kedge anchor to go further up the passage, it came up  broken near the crown, having in all probability hooked a rock. The Lady  Nelson went one mile ahead, a boat was kept sounding close to the ship,  and in this manner we drifted up with the flood tide, till half past  eight; when another kedge anchor was dropped in 7 fathoms, a short mile  from the land on each side, and two from the inner end of the opening.  Lieutenant Fowler was immediately sent away in the whale boat, to search  for the lost cutter; and in the mean time we weighed with the afternoon's  flood, to get through the passage. On approaching a low, triangular  island on the eastern shore, the depth diminished quick, and an anchor  was let go; but in swinging to it, the ship caught upon a bank of sand  and shells where there was no more than twelve feet water. In half an  hour the tide floated her off; and the whale boat having returned, but  without any information of the cutter, it was kept ahead; and before dark  we anchored in 5 fathoms, at the entrance of Shoalwater Bay.    The opening through which we had come was named _Strong-tide Passage_. It  is six miles long, and from one to two broad; but half the width is taken  up by shoals and rocks, which extend out from each shore and sometimes  lie near the mid-channel; and the rapid tides scarcely leave to a ship  the choice of her course. The bottom is rocky in the outer entrance, but  in the upper part seems more generally to consist of sand and shells. By  the swinging of the ship, it was high water _ten hours after_ the moon's  passage, and the rise was thirteen feet by the lead; but at the top of  the springs it is probably two or three feet greater; and the rate at  which the tides then run,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13127"],[0,"Observations on the Mussulmauns of India (#11)"],[1,"outward show of  sadness, although they are present when it is exercised; but their quiet  grief is evidently more sincere.    I have conversed with many sensible men of the Mussulmaun persuasion on  the subject of celebrating Mahurrum, and from all I can learn, the pompous  display is grown into a habit, by a long residence amongst people, who  make a merit of showy parades at all their festivals. Foreign Mussulmauns  are equally surprised as Europeans, when they visit Hindoostaun, and first  see the Tazia conveyed about in procession, which would be counted  sacrilegious in Persia or Arabia; but here, the ceremony is not complete  without a mixture of pageantry with, the deeply expressed and public  exposure of their grief.[43]    The remarkable plainness of the mosque, contrasted with the superb  decorations of an Emaum-baarah, excited my surprise. I am told by the most  venerable of Syaads, 'The Mosque is devoted only to the service of God,  where it is commanded no worldly attractions or ornaments shall appear, to  draw off the mind, or divert the attention, from that one great object for  which the house of prayer is intended'. An Emaum-baarah is erected for the  purpose of doing honour to the memory of the Emaums, and of late years the  emulative spirit of individuals has been the great inducement to the  display of ornamental decorations.    It is rather from their respect to the Founder of their religion and his  descendants, than any part of their profession of faith, that the  Mussulmaun population of Hindoostaun are guided by in these displays,  which are merely the fashion of other people whom they imitate; and with  far different motives to the weak-minded Hindoos, who exalt their idols,  whilst the former thus testify their respect to worthy mortals only. This  is the explanation I have received from devout Mussulmauns, who direct me  to remark the strong similarity--in habit only, where 'the faith' is not  liable to innovations--between themselves and the Hindoo population;--the  out-of-door celebrations of marriage festivals, for instance, which are so  nearly resembling each other, in the same classes of society, that  scarcely any difference can be discovered by the common observer.    Idolatry is hateful to a Mussulmaun, who acknowledges 'one only true God',  and 'Him alone to be worshipped'.[44] They respect, venerate, love, and  would imitate, their acknowledged Prophet and the Emaums (who succeeded  Mahumud in the mission), but they never worship them, as has been often  imagined. On the contrary, they declare to me that their faith compels  them 'to believe in one God, and that He alone is to be worshipped by the  creature; and that Mahumud is a creature, the Prophet sent by God to make  His will known, and declare His power. That to bow down and worship  Mahumud would be gross idolatry; and, although he is often mentioned in  their prayers, yet he is never prayed to. They believe their Prophet is  sensible of whatever passes amongst his true disciples; and that, in  proportion as they fulfil the commands he was instructed by God to leave  with them, so will they derive benefit from his intercession, on that  great and awful day, when all mankind shall appear before the judgment  seat of God.'

[39] Mordaunt Ricketts was Resident at Lucknow between 1821 and 1830, when      he was 'superannuated' owing to financial scandals, for the details of      which see Sir G.

Keene, _Here and There_, 10; on November 1, 1824, he was      married at Lucknow by Bishop Heber to the widow of George Ravenscroft,      the civilian who was Collector of Cawnpore, and there embezzled large      sums of money, the property of Government. He fled with his wife and      child to Bhinga in Oudh, where, on May 6, 1823, he was murdered by      Dacoits.

But he protested against idols      in one of the earliest Suurahs of the Koraan (lii 35-43), and in      other passages.

After the Tazia is brought home (as the temporary ones are from the bazaar  on the eve of Mahurrum, attended by a ceremonious display of persons,  music, flags, flambeaux, &c.), there is little to remark of out-door  parade beyond the continual activity of the multitude making the sacred  visits to their several Emaum-baarahs, until the fifth day, when the  banners are conveyed from each of them in solemn procession, to be  consecrated at the Durgah[1] (literally translated, 'The threshold' or  'Entrance to a sanctified place').    This custom is perhaps exclusively observed by the inhabitants of Lucknow,  where I have had the privilege of acquiring a knowledge of the motives  which guide most of their proceedings; and as there is a story attached to  the Durgah, not generally known to European visitors, I propose relating  it here, as it particularly tends to explain the reasons for the  Mussulmauns conveying their banners for consecration to that celebrated  shrine.    'A native of India--I forget his name--remarkable for his devotion and  holy life, undertook the pilgrimage to Mecca; whilst engaged in these  duties at the \"holy house\", he was visited with a prophetic dream."]]]
