The ladies may be trusted to learn for themselves,  and very quickly, all that they need or want to know about that phase of  Havana's commerce. I am leaving much to the guide books that can afford  space for all necessary information about churches, statues, and other  objects of interest for visitors. Havana's retail merchants have their own  way of trading, much as they do in many foreign countries, and in not a few  stores in our own country. Prices are usually a question of the customer's  ability to match the commercial shrewdness of the dealer. Much of the trade  of visitors is now confined to the purchase of such articles as may be  immediately needed and to a few souvenirs. One of the charms of the place  is the cheap transportation. If you are tired, or in a hurry, there is  always a coach near at hand that will take you where you wish to go, for a  peseta, or a quarter, if within certain officially prescribed bounds. If  you desire to go beyond those bounds, make a bargain with your driver or  be prepared for trouble. Down in the old city are to be found several  restaurants that are well worth visiting, for those who want good food. I  shall not advertise the particular places, but they are well known. As the  early morning is the best time to see the old city, the forenoon is the  best time for shopping. Such an expedition may well be followed by the  _almuerzo_, the midday breakfast or lunch, whichever one sees fit to call  it, at one of these restaurants. After that, it is well to enjoy a midday  _siesta_, in preparation for the afternoon function on the Prado and the  Malecon.          V    THE NEW HAVANA      The new Havana, the city outside the old wall, is about as old as Chicago  but not nearly as tall. There is no reason why it should be. Here are wide  streets and broad avenues, and real sidewalks, some of them about as wide  as the entire street in the old city. About 1830, the region beyond the  wall was held largely by Spaniards to whom grants of land had been made  for one reason or another. These tracts were plantations, pastures, or  unimproved lands, according to the fancy of the proprietor who usually  lived in the city and enjoyed himself after the manner of his kind. Here  and there, a straggling village of palm-leaf huts sprang up. The roads were  rough tracks. To Governor-General Tacon seems due much of the credit for  the improvement beyond the walls. During his somewhat iron-handed rule  several notable buildings were erected, some of them by his authority.  The most notable feature of the district is the renowned Prado, a broad  boulevard with a park between two drive-ways, running from the water-front,  at the entrance to the harbor, southward for about a mile. A few years ago,  rows of trees shaded the central parkway, but they were almost entirely  wrecked by the hurricanes in 1906 and 1910.    A half mile or so from its northern end, the Prado runs along the west side  of the Parque Central, the most notable of the numerous little squares of  walks and trees and flowers. A block or two further on is a little park  with an excellent statue, known as La India. Opposite that is another  really beautiful park, from the western side of which runs a broad street  that leads to the Paseo de Carlos Tercero, formerly the Paseo de Tacon, one  of the monuments left to his own memory by one of Cuba's most noted Spanish  rulers. The Paseo runs westward to El Castillo del Principe, originally a  fortress but now a penitentiary. The Prado stops just beyond the companion  parks, La India and Colon. These originally formed the Campo de Marte, laid  out by General Tacon and, in his time, used as a military parade ground.  In a way, the Parque Central is the centre of the city. It is almost that,  geographically, and perhaps quite that, socially. In its immediate vicinity  are some of the leading hotels and the principal theatres. One of the  latter, facing the park on its western side, across the Prado, is now known  as the Nacional. Formerly it was the Tacon, a monument to that notable man.  There is quite a story about that structure. It is somewhat too long for  inclusion here, but it seems worth telling. The following is an abridgment  of the tale as it is told in Mr. Ballou's _History of Cuba_, published in  1854. Tacon was the Governor of the island from 1834 to 1838. At that time,  a certain man named Marti was eminent in the smuggling and piracy business,  an industry in which many others were engaged. But Marti seems to have  stood at the top of his profession, a man of skill and daring and evidently  well supplied with brains. Tacon's efforts to capture him, or to break up  his business, were entirely unsuccessful, and a large reward was offered  for his body, alive or dead. Mr. Ballou tells the story in somewhat  dramatic manner:    \"It was a dark, cloudy night in Havana, a few months after the announcement  of the reward, when two sentinels were pacing backward and forward before  the main entrance to the Governor's palace. A little before midnight, a man  was watching them from behind a statue in the park, and after observing  that the sentinels paced their brief walk so as to meet each other, and  then turned their backs as they separated, leaving a brief moment in the  interval when the eyes of both were turned away from the entrance, seemed  to calculate upon passing them unobserved. It was an exceedingly delicate  manoeuvre, and required great care and dexterity to effect it; but, at  last, it was adroitly done, and the stranger sprang lightly through the  entrance, secreting himself behind one of the pillars of the inner court.  The sentinels paced on undisturbed. The figure which had thus stealthily  effected an entrance, now sought the broad stairs that led to the  Governor's suite, with a confidence that evinced a perfect knowledge of the  place. A second guard-post was to be passed at the head of the stairs; but,  assuming an air of authority, the stranger offered a cold military salute  and passed forward, as though there was not the most distant question of  his right to do so; and thus avoiding all suspicion in the guard's mind, he  boldly entered the Governor's reception room unchallenged, and closed the  door behind him.\"    In his office, alone, the stranger found Tacon, who was naturally surprised  at the appearance of an unannounced caller. He demanded to know who the  visitor was, but a direct answer was evaded. After referring to the matter  of the reward offered for the discovery of Marti, and the pledge of  immunity to the discoverer, the caller demanded and obtained a verbal  endorsement of the promise of immunity, under the Governor's word of honor,  whatever might be the circumstances of his revelation. He then announced  himself as the much-sought pirate and smuggler, Marti. Tacon was somewhat  astounded, but he kept his word. Marti was held overnight, but \"on the  following day,\" the Ballou account proceeds, \"one of the men-of-war that  lay idly beneath the guns of Morro Castle suddenly became the scene of the  utmost activity, and, before noon, had weighed her anchor, and was standing  out into the gulf stream. Marti the smuggler was on board as her pilot;  and faithfully did he guide the ship on the discharge of his treacherous  business, revealing every haunt of the rovers, exposing their most valuable  depots; and many a smuggling craft was taken and destroyed. The amount of  money and property thus secured was very great.\" The contemptible job  of betraying his former companions and followers being successfully  accomplished, Marti returned with the ships, and claimed his reward from  Tacon. The General, according to his word of honor, gave Marti a full  and unconditional pardon for all his past offences, and an order on the  treasury for the amount of the reward offered. The latter was declined but,  in lieu of the sum, Marti asked for and obtained a monopoly of the right  to sell fish in Havana. He offered to build, at his own expense, a public  market of stone, that should, after a specified term of years, revert to  the government, \"with all right and the title to the fishery.\" This  struck Tacon as a good business proposition; he saved to his treasury  the important sum of the reward and, after a time, the city would own a  valuable fish-market. He agreed to the plan. Marti thereupon went into  the fish business, made huge profits, and became, so the story goes, the  richest man in the island. After a time, being burdened with wealth, he  looked about for means of increasing his income. So he asked for and  obtained a monopoly of the theatre business in Havana, promising to build  one of the largest and finest theatres in the world. The result of the  enterprise was the present Nacional theatre, for many years regarded as  second only to the Grand theatre in Milan. But it was named the Tacon. Its  special attraction was internal; its exterior was far from imposing. It has  recently been considerably glorified. Having thus halted for the story of  the theatre, we may return to the Prado on which it fronts. Here, Havana  society used to gather every afternoon to drive, walk, and talk. The  afternoon _paseo_ was and still is the great event of the day, the great  social function of the city. At the time of my first visit, in 1899, there  was no Malecon drive along the shore to the westward. That enterprise  was begun during the First Intervention, and continued by succeeding  administrations. In the earlier days, the route for driving was down the  east side of the Prado, between the Parque Central and the _Carcel_, and  up the west side, around and around, up and down, with bows and smiles to  acquaintances met or passed, and, probably, gossip"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1149"],[0,"From London to Land's End (#11)"],[1,"neat town and full of people, having a share of trade with  Poole itself; it shows the ruins of a large town, and, it is apparent,  has had eight churches, of which they have three remaining.    South of Wareham, and between the bay I have mentioned and the sea, lies  a large tract of land which, being surrounded by the sea except on one  side, is called an island, though it is really what should be called a  peninsula.  This tract of land is better inhabited than the sea-coast of  this west end of Dorsetshire generally is, and the manufacture of  stockings is carried on there also; it is called the Isle of Purbeck, and  has in the middle of it a large market-town, called Corfe, and from the  famous castle there the whole town is now called Corfe Castle; it is a  corporation, sending members to Parliament.    This part of the country is eminent for vast quarries of stone, which is  cut out flat, and used in London in great quantities for paving  courtyards, alleys, avenues to houses, kitchens, footways on the sides of  the High Streets, and the like; and is very profitable to the place, as  also in the number of shipping employed in bringing it to London.  There  are also several rocks of very good marble, only that the veins in the  stone are not black and white, as the Italian, but grey, red, and other  colours.    From hence to Weymouth, which is 22 miles, we rode in view of the sea;  the country is open, and in some respects pleasant, but not like the  northern parts of the county, which are all fine carpet-ground, soft as  velvet, and the herbage sweet as garden herbs, which makes their sheep be  the best in England, if not in the world, and their wool fine to an  extreme.    I cannot omit here a small adventure which was very surprising to me on  this journey; passing this plain country, we came to an open piece of  ground where a neighbouring gentleman had at a great expense laid out a  proper piece of land for a decoy, or duck-coy, as some call it.  The  works were but newly done, the planting young, the ponds very large and  well made; but the proper places for shelter of the fowl not covered, the  trees not being grown, and men were still at work improving and enlarging  and planting on the adjoining heath or common.  Near the decoy-keeper's  house were some places where young decoy ducks were hatched, or otherwise  kept to fit them for their work.  To preserve them from vermin (polecats,  kites, and such like), they had set traps, as is usual in such cases, and  a gibbet by it, where abundance of such creatures as were taken were  hanged up for show.    While the decoy-man was busy showing the new works, he was alarmed with a  great cry about this house for \"Help! help!\" and away he ran like the  wind, guessing, as we supposed, that something was catched in the trap.    It was a good big boy, about thirteen or fourteen years old, that cried  out, for coming to the place he found a great fowl caught by the leg in  the trap, which yet was so strong and so outrageous that the boy going  too near him, he flew at him and frighted him, bit him, and beat him with  his wings, for he was too strong for the boy; as the master ran from the  decoy, so another manservant ran from the house, and finding a strange  creature fast in the trap, not knowing what it was, laid at him with a  great stick.  The creature fought him a good while, but at length he  struck him an unlucky blow which quieted him; after this we all came up  to see what the matter, and found a monstrous eagle caught by the leg in  the trap, and killed by the fellow's cudgel, as above.    When the master came to know what it was, and that his man had killed it,  he was ready to kill the fellow for his pains, for it was a noble  creature indeed, and would have been worth a great deal to the man to  have it shown about the country, or to have sold to any gentleman curious  in such things; but the eagle was dead, and there we left it.  It is  probable this eagle had flown over the sea from France, either there or  at the Isle of Wight, where the channel is not so wide; for we do not  find that any eagles are known to breed in those parts of Britain.    From hence we turned up to Dorchester, the county town, though not the  largest town in the county.  Dorchester is indeed a pleasant agreeable  town to live in, and where I thought the people seemed less divided into  factions and parties than in other places; for though here are divisions,  and the people are not all of one mind, either as to religion or  politics, yet they did not seem to separate with so much animosity as in  other places.  Here I saw the Church of England clergyman, and the  Dissenting minister or preacher drinking tea together, and conversing  with civility and good neighbourhood, like Catholic Christians and men of  a Catholic and extensive charity.  The town is populous, though not  large; the streets broad, but the buildings old and low.  However, there  is good company, and a good deal of it; and a man that coveted a retreat  in this world might as agreeably spend his time and as well in Dorchester  as in any town I know in England.    The downs round this town are exceeding pleasant, and come up on, every  side, even to the very streets' end; and here it was that they told me  that there were six hundred thousand sheep fed on the downs within six  miles of the town--that is, six miles every way, which is twelve miles in  diameter, and thirty-six miles in circumference.  This, I say, I was  told--I do not affirm it to be true; but when I viewed the country round,  I confess I could not but incline to believe it.    It is observable of these sheep that they are exceeding fruitful, the  ewes generally bringing two lambs, and they are for that reason bought by  all the farmers through the east part of England, who come to Burford  Fair in this country to buy them, and carry them into Kent and Surrey  eastward, and into Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire and Oxfordshire  north; even our Banstead Downs in Surrey, so famed for good mutton, is  supplied from this place.  The grass or herbage of these downs is full of  the sweetest and the most aromatic plants, such as nourish the sheep to a  strange degree; and the sheep's dung, again, nourishes that herbage to a  strange degree; so that the valleys are rendered extremely fruitful by  the washing of the water in hasty showers from off these hills.    An eminent instance of this is seen at Amesbury, in Wiltshire, the next  county to this; for it is the same thing in proportion over this whole  county.  I was told that at this town there was a meadow on the bank of  the River Avon, which runs thence to Salisbury, which was let for 12  pounds a year per acre for the grass only.  This I inquired particularly  after at the place, and was assured by the inhabitants, as one man, that  the fact was true, and was showed the meadows.  The grass which grew on  them was such as grew to the length of ten or twelve feet, rising up to a  good height and then taking root again, and was of so rich a nature as to  answer very well such an extravagant rent.    The reason they gave for this was the extraordinary richness of the soil,  made so, as above, by the falling or washing of the rains from the hills  adjacent, by which, though no other land thereabouts had such a kind of  grass, yet all other meadows and low grounds of the valley were extremely  rich in proportion.    There are abundance of good families, and of very ancient lines in the  neighbourhood of this town of Dorchester, as the Napiers, the Courtneys,  Strangeways, Seymours, Banks, Tregonells, Sydenhams, and many others,  some of which have very great estates in the county, and in particular  Colonel Strangeways, Napier, and Courtney.  The first of these is master  of the famous swannery or nursery of swans, the like of which, I believe,  is not in Europe.  I wonder any man should pretend to travel over this  country, and pass by it, too, and then write his account and take no  notice of it.    From Dorchester it is six miles to the seaside south, and the ocean in  view almost all the way.  The first town you come to is Weymouth, or  Weymouth and Melcombe, two towns lying at the mouth of a little rivulet  which they call the Wey, but scarce claims the name of a river.  However,  the entrance makes a very good though small harbour, and they are joined  by a wooden bridge; so that nothing but the harbour parts them; yet they  are separate corporations, and choose each of them two members of  Parliament, just as London and Southwark.    Weymouth is a sweet, clean, agreeable town, considering its low  situation, and close to the sea; it is well built, and has a great many  good substantial merchants in it who drive a considerable trade, and have  a good number of ships belonging to the town.  They carry on now, in time  of peace, a trade with France; but, besides this, they trade also to  Portugal, Spain, Newfoundland, and Virginia; and they have a large  correspondence also up in the country for the consumption of their  returns; especially the wine trade and the Newfoundland trade are  considerable here.    Without the harbour is an old castle, called Sandfoot Castle; and over  against them, where there is a good road for ships to put in on occasions  of bad weather, is Portland Castle, and the road is called Portland Road.  While I was here once, there came a merchant-ship into that road called  Portland Road under a very hard storm of wind; she was homeward bound  from Oporto for London, laden with wines; and as she came in she made  signals of distress to the town, firing guns for help, and the like, as  is usual in such cases; it was in the dark of the night that the ship  came in, and, by the help of her own pilot, found her way into the road,  where she came to an anchor, but, as I say, fired guns for help.    The venturous Weymouth men went off, even before it was light, with two  "]]]
