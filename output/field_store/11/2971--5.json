She confessed that she loved to see and feel them sink      into my body as she trod upon me and enjoyed the crunch of the      muscles under her heel as she moved about. After some minutes of      this, I always guided her slipper on to my penis, and she would      tread carefully, but with her whole weight--probably about 9      stone--and watch me with flashing eyes, flushed cheeks, and      quivering lips, as she felt--as she must have done plainly--the      throbbing and swelling of my penis under her foot as emission      took place. I have not the smallest doubt that orgasm took place      simultaneously with her, though we never at any time spoke openly      of it. This went on for several years on almost every favorable      opportunity we had, and after a month or two of separation      sometimes four or five times during a single day. Several times      during A.'s absence I masturbated by getting her slipper and      pressing it with all my strength against the penis while      imagining that she was treading upon me. The pleasure was, of      course, very inferior to her attentions. There was never at any      time between us any question of normal sexual intercourse, and we      were both well content to let things drift as they were.        \"A little after 20 I went abroad, and on my return about three      years later I found her married. Although we met often, the      subject was never alluded to, though we remained firm friends. I      confess I often, when I could do so without being seen, looked      longingly at her feet and would have gladly accepted the pleasure      she could have given me by an occasional resumption of our      strange practice--but it never came.        \"I went abroad again, and now neither she nor her husband are      alive and leave no issue. From time to time I have had occasional      relations with prostitutes, but always in this manner, though I      much prefer to find some lady of or above my own social position      who will do the treading for me. This is, however, interestingly      difficult.        \"Out of say a hundred women (which at home and abroad is what I      should estimate must have stood upon my body) I should say quite      80 or 85 were _not_ prostitutes. Certainly not more than 10 to 12      shared any _sexual_ excitement, but while they were evidently      excited they were not gratified. A. alone, so far as I know, had      complete sexual satisfaction of it. I have never asked a woman in      so many words to tread upon me for the purpose of gratifying my      sexual desires (prostitutes excepted), but have always tempted      them to do it in a jocular or teasing manner, and it is very      doubtful if more than a few (married) women really understood,      even after they had given me the extreme pleasure, that they had      done so, because any flushing and movement on my part under their      feet was not unnaturally put down to the trampling to which they      were subjecting me, and it was easy for me to guide the foot as      often as was necessary on to the penis till orgasm took place,      and even to keep it there by laying hold of the other one to kiss      it or on some other pretext during emission. Of course many      understood after once doing it (most have done it only once) what      I was at, and, although they did not ever discuss it nor did I,      they were not unwilling to give me as many treadings as I cared      to playfully suggest. I don't think they got any pleasure      sexually out of it themselves, though they could see plainly that      I did, and they did not object to give it me. I have spent as      long as twelve months with some women working gradually nearer      and nearer to my desire--often getting what I want in the end,      but more often failing. I _never_ risk it till I am certain it      would be safe to ask it, and have never had a serious rebuff. In      very many cases I should say the doing of what I want has simply      been regarded by the woman as gratifying a silly and perhaps      amusing whim, in which, beyond the novelty of treading on a man's      body, she has taken but little interest.        \"As in normal seduction, the endeavor to win the woman over to do      what I want without arousing her antagonism is a great part of      the charm to me, and naturally the better her social position the      more difficult this becomes--and the more attractive. I have      found that in three instances prostitutes have performed the same      office for other men and knew all about it. It is not      uninteresting to note that these three women were all of fine,      massive build--one standing about 5 feet 10 inches and weighing      nearly 14 stone--but with comparatively uninteresting faces. The      weight, build and clothing count for a good deal in exciting me.      I find that a sudden check to a man at the supreme moment of      sexual pleasure tends to heighten and prolong the pleasure. My      physical satisfaction is due to the fact that by getting the lady      to stand with all her weight upon my penis (as it lies between      her foot and the soft bed of my own body into which it is deeply      pressed) the act of emission is enormously prolonged, with      corresponding enjoyment. For this reason also I prefer a very      high-heeled slipper. The seminal fluid has to be forced past two      separate obstacles--the pressure of the heel close at the root of      the penis and afterwards the ball of the foot which compresses      the outer half, leaving a free portion between them under the      arched sole of the slipper. I may add that the pleasure is      greatly increased by the retention of the urine, and I always try      to retain as much water as I dare. I have an unconquerable      aversion to red in slippers or stockings; it will even cause      impotence. Why, I know not. Strange as it may seem, although pain      and bruising are often inflicted by a severe treading, I have      never been in any way injured by the practice, and my pleasure in      it seems not to diminish by constant repetition. The comparative      difficulty of obtaining the pleasure from just the woman I want      has a never-ending, if inexplicable, charm for me.\"        It will be observed that in this case special importance is      attached to shoes with high heels, and the subject considers that      the pressure of such shoes is for mechanical reasons most      favorable for procuring ejaculation. Nearly all heterosexual      shoe-fetichists seem, however, to be equally attracted by high      heels. Restif de la Bretonne frequently referred to this point,      and he gave a number of reasons for the attractiveness of high      heels: (1) They are unlike men's boots and, therefore, have a      sexual fascination; (2) they make the leg and foot look more      charming; (3) they give a less bold and more sylph-like character      to the walk; (4) they keep the feet clean. (Restif de la      Bretonne, _Nuits de Paris_, vol. v, quoted in Preface to his _Mes      Inscriptions_, p. ciii.) It is doubtless the first reason--the      fact that high heels are a kind of secondary sexual      character--which is most generally potent in this attraction.    The foregoing history, while it very distinctly brings before us a case of  erotic symbolism, is not strictly an example of shoe-fetichism. The  symbolism is more complex. The focus of beauty in a desirable woman is  transferred and concentrated in the region below the knee; in that sense  we have foot-fetichism. But the act of coitus itself is also symbolically  transferred. Not only has the foot become the symbol of the vulva, but  trampling has become the symbol of coitus; intercourse takes place  symbolically _per pedem_. It is a result of this symbolization of the foot  and of trampling that all acts of treading take on a new and symbolical  sexual charm. The element of masochism--of pleasure in being a woman's  slave--is a parasitic growth; that is to say, it is not founded in the  subject's constitution, but chances to have found a favorable soil in the  special circumstances under which his sexual life developed. It is not  primary, but secondary, and remains an unimportant and merely occasional  element.    It may be instructive to bring forward for comparison a case in which also  we have a symbolism involving boot-fetichism, but extending beyond it. In  this case there is a basis of inversion (as is not infrequent in erotic  symbolisms), but from the present point of view the psychological  significance of the case remains the same.

To  the theoretical philanthropist, eager to reform the world on paper,  nothing seems simpler than to cure the present evils of child-rearing by  setting up State nurseries which are at once to relieve mothers of  everything connected with the production of the men of the future beyond  the pleasure--if such it happens to be--of conceiving them and the trouble  of bearing them, and at the same time to rear them up independently of the  home, in a wholesome, economical, and scientific manner.[17] Nothing seems  simpler, but from the fundamental psychological standpoint nothing is  falser. The idea of a State which is outside the community is but a  survival in another form of that antiquated notion which compelled Louis  XIV to declare \"L'Etat c'est moi!\" A State which admits that the  individuals composing it are incompetent to perform their own most sacred  and intimate functions, and takes upon itself to perform them instead,  attempts a task which would be undesirable, even if it were possible of  achievement. It must always be remembered that a State which proposes to  relieve its constituent members of their natural functions and  responsibilities attempts something quite different from the State which  seeks to aid its members to fulfil their own biological and social  functions more adequately. A State which enables its mothers to rest when  they are child-bearing is engaged in a reasonable task; a State which  takes over its mothers' children is reducing philanthropy to absurdity. It  is easy to realize this if we consider the inevitable course of  circumstances under a system of \"State-nurseries.\" The child would be  removed from its natural mother at the earliest age, but some one has to  perform the mother's duties; the substitute must therefore be properly  trained for such duties; and in exercising them under favorable  circumstances a maternal relationship is developed between the child and  the \"mother,\" who doubtless possesses natural maternal instincts but has  no natural maternal bond to the child she is mothering. Such a  relationship tends to become on both sides practically and emotionally the  real relationship. We very often have opportunity of seeing how  unsatisfactory such a relationship becomes. The artificial mother is  deprived of a child she had begun to feel her own; the child's emotional  relationships are upset, split and distorted; the real mother has the  bitterness of feeling that for her child she is not the real mother. Would  it not have been much better for all if the State had encouraged the vast  army of women it had trained for the position of mothering other women's  children, to have, instead, children of their own? The women who are  incapable of mothering their own children could then be trained to refrain  from bearing them.        Ellen Key (in her _Century of the Child_, and elsewhere) has      advocated for all young women a year of compulsory \"service,\"      analogous to the compulsory military service imposed in most      countries on young men. During this period the girl would be      trained in rational housekeeping, in the principles of hygiene,      in the care of the sick, and especially in the care of infants      and all that concerns the physical and psychic development of      children. The principle of this proposal has since been widely      accepted. Marie von Schmid (in her _Mutterdienst_, 1907) goes so      far as to advocate a general training of young women in such      duties, carried on in a kind of enlarged and improved midwifery      school. The service would last a year, and the young woman would      then be for three years in the reserves, and liable to be called      up for duty. There is certainly much to be said for such a      proposal, considerably more than is to be said for compulsory      military service. For while it is very doubtful whether a man      will ever be called on to fight, most women are liable to be      called on to exercise household duties or to look after children,      whether for themselves or for other people.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] It is not, of course, always literally true that each parent supplies  exactly half the heredity, for, as we see among animals generally, the  offspring may sometimes approach more nearly to one parent, sometimes to  the other, while among plants, as De Vries and others have shown, the  heredity may be still more unequally divided.    [2] It should scarcely be necessary to say that to assert that motherhood  is a woman's supreme function is by no means to assert that her activities  should be confined to the home. That is an opinion which may now be  regarded as almost extinct even among those who most glorify the function  of woman as mother. As Friedrich Naumann and others have very truly  pointed out, a woman is not adequately equipped to fulfil her functions as  mother and trainer of children unless she has lived in the world and  exercised a vocation.    [3] \"Were the capacities of the brain and the heart equal in the sexes,\"  Lily Braun (_Die Frauenfrage_, page 207) well says, \"the entry of women  into public life would be of no value to humanity, and would even lead to  a still wilder competition. Only the recognition that the entire nature of  woman is different from that of man, that it signifies a new vivifying  principle in human life, makes the women's movement, in spite of the  misconception of its enemies and its friends, a social revolution\" (see  also Havelock Ellis, _Man and Woman_, fourth edition, 1904, especially Ch.  XVIII).    [4] The word \"puericulture\" was invented by Dr. Caron in 1866 to signify  the culture of children after birth. It was Pinard, the distinguished  French obstetrician, who, in 1895, gave it a larger and truer significance  by applying it to include the culture of children before birth. It is now  defined as \"the science which has for its end the search for the knowledge  relative to the reproduction, the preservation, and the amelioration of  the human race\" (Pechin, _La Puericulture avant la Naissance_, These de  Paris, 1908).    [5] In _La Grossesse_ (pp. 450 et seq.) Bouchacourt has discussed the  problems of puericulture at some length.    [6] The importance of antenatal puericulture was fully recognized in China  a thousand years ago. Thus Madame Cheng wrote at that time concerning the  education of the child: \"Even before birth his education may begin; and,  therefore, the prospective mother of old, when lying down, lay straight;  when sitting down, sat upright; and when standing, stood erect. She would  not taste strange flavors, nor have anything to do with spiritualism; if  her food were not cut straight she would not eat it, and if her mat were  not set straight, she would not sit upon it. She would not look at any  objectionable sight, nor listen to any objectionable sound, nor utter any  rude word, nor handle any impure thing. At night she studied some  canonical work, by day she occupied herself with ceremonies and music.  Therefore, her sons were upright and eminent for their talents and  virtues; such was the result of antenatal training\" (H.A. Giles, \"Woman in  Chinese Literature,\" _Nineteenth Century_, Nov., 1904).    [7] Max Bartels, \"Islaendischer Brauch,\" etc., _Zeitschrift fuer  Ethnologie_, 1900, p. 65. A summary of the customs of various peoples in  regard to pregnancy is given by Ploss and Bartels, _Das Weib_, Sect. XXIX.    [8] On the influence of alcohol during pregnancy on the embryo, see, e.g.,  G. Newman, _Infant Mortality_, pp. 72-77. W.C. Sullivan (_Alcoholism_,  1906, Ch. XI), summarizes the evidence showing that alcohol is a factor in  human degeneration.    [9] There is even reason to believe that the alcoholism of the mother's  father may impair her ability as a mother. Bunge (_Die Zunehmende  Unfaehigkeit der Frauen ihre Kinder zu Stillen_, fifth edition, 1907), from  an investigation extending over 2,000 families, finds that chronic  alcoholic poisoning in the father is the chief cause of the daughter's  inability to suckle, this inability not usually being recovered in  subsequent generations. Bunge has, however, been opposed by Dr. Agnes  Bluhm, \"Die Stillungsnot,\" _Zeitschrift fuer Soziale Medizin_, 1908 (fully  summarized by herself in _Sexual-Probleme_, Jan., 1909).    [10] See, e.g., T. Arthur Helme, \"The Unborn Child,\" _British Medical  Journal_, Aug. 24, 1907. Nutrition should, of course, be adequate. Noel  Paton has shown (_Lancet_, July 4, 1903) that defective nutrition of the  pregnant woman diminishes the weight of the offspring.    [11] Debreyne, _Moechialogie_, p. 277. And from the Protestant side see  Northcote (_Christianity and Sex Problems_, Ch. IX), who permits sexual  intercourse during pregnancy.    [12] See Appendix A to the third volume of these _Studies_; also Ploss and  Bartels, loc. cit.    [13] Thus one lady writes: \"I have only had one child, but I may say that  during pregnancy the desire for union was much stronger, for the whole  time, than at any other period.\" Bouchacourt (_La Grossesse_, pp. 180-183)  states that, as a rule, sexual desire is not diminished by pregnancy, and  is occasionally increased.    [14] This \"inconvenience\" remains to-day a stumbling-block with many  excellent authorities. \"Except when there is a tendency to miscarriage,\"  says Kossmann (Senator and Kaminer, _Health and Disease in Relation to  Marriage_, vol. i, p. 257), \"we must be very guarded in ordering  abstinence from intercourse during pregnancy,\" and Ballantyne (_The  Foetus_, p. 475) cautiously remarks that the question is difficult to  decide.
