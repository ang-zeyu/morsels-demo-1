Milkmaids occasionally passed, as did also donkey-drivers  with their gray pupils. Beyond Weende I met the \"Shepherd\" and \"Doris.\"  This is not the idyllic pair sung by Gessner, but the duly and  comfortably appointed university beadles, whose duty it is to keep watch  and ward so that no students fight duels in Bovden, and, above all, that  no new ideas (such as are generally obliged to remain in quarantine for  several decades outside of Goettingen) are smuggled in by speculative  private lecturers. Shepherd greeted me as one does a colleague, for he,  too, is an author, who has frequently mentioned my name in his  semi-annual writings. In addition to this, I may mention that when, as  was frequently the case, he came to cite me before the university court  and found me \"not at home,\" he was always kind enough to write the  citation with chalk upon my chamber door. Occasionally a one-horse  vehicle rolled along, well packed with students, who were leaving for  the vacation or forever.    In such a university town there is an endless coming and going. Every  three years beholds a new student-generation, forming an incessant human  tide, where one semester-wave succeeds another, and only the old  professors stand fast in the midst of this perpetual-motion flood,  immovable as the pyramids of Egypt. Only in these university pyramids no  treasures of wisdom are buried.    From out the myrtle bushes, by Rauschenwasser, I saw two hopeful youths  appear ... singing charmingly the Rossinian lay of \"Drink beer, pretty,  pretty 'Liza!\" These sounds I continued to hear when far in the  distance, and after I had long lost sight of the amiable vocalists, as  their horses, which appeared to be gifted with characters of extreme  German deliberation, were spurred and lashed in a most excruciating  style. In no place is the skinning alive of horses carried to such an  extent as in Goettingen; and often, when I beheld some lame and sweating  hack, which, to earn the scraps of fodder which maintained his wretched  life, was obliged to endure the torment of some roaring blade, or draw a  whole wagon-load of students, I reflected: \"Unfortunate beast! Most  certainly thy first ancestors, in some horse-paradise, did eat of  forbidden oats.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Beyond Noerten the sun flashed high in heaven. His intentions toward me  were evidently good, and he warmed my brain until all the unripe  thoughts which it contained came to full growth. The pleasant Sun Tavern  in Noerten is not to be despised, either; I stopped there and found  dinner ready. All the dishes were excellent and suited me far better  than the wearisome, academical courses of saltless, leathery dried fish  and cabbage _rechauffe_, which were served to me in Goettingen. After I  had somewhat appeased my appetite, I remarked in the same room of the  tavern a gentle man and two ladies, who were about to depart. The  cavalier was clad entirely in green; he even had on a pair of green  spectacles which cast a verdigris tinge upon his copper-red nose. The  gentleman's general appearance was like what we may presume King  Nebuchadnezzar's to have been in his later years, when, according to  tradition, he ate nothing but salad, like a beast of the forest. The  Green One requested me to recommend him to a hotel in Goettingen, and I  advised him, when there, to inquire of the first convenient student for  the Hotel de Bruebach. One lady was evidently his wife--an altogether  extensively constructed dame, gifted with a rubicund square mile of  countenance, with dimples in her cheeks which looked like spittoons for  cupids. A copious double chin appeared below, like an imperfect  continuation of the face, while her high-piled bosom, which was defended  by stiff points of lace and a many-cornered collar, as if by turrets and  bastions, reminded one of a fortress. Still, it is by no means certain  that this fortress would have resisted an ass laden with gold, any more  than did that of which Philip of Macedon spoke. The other lady, her  sister, seemed her extreme antitype. If the one were descended from  Pharaoh's fat kine, the other was as certainly derived from the lean.  Her face was but a mouth between two ears; her breast was as  inconsolably comfortless and dreary as the Lueneburger heath; while her  absolutely dried-up figure reminded one of a charity table for poor  theological students. Both ladies asked me, in a breath, if respectable  people lodged in the Hotel de Bruebach. I assented to this question with  a clear conscience, and as the charming trio drove away I waved my hand  to them many times from the window. The landlord of The Sun laughed,  however, in his sleeve, being probably aware that the Hotel de Bruebach  was a name bestowed by the students of Goettingen upon their university  prison.    Beyond Nordheim mountain ridges begin to appear, and the traveler  occasionally meets with a picturesque eminence. The wayfarers whom I  encountered were principally peddlers, traveling to the Brunswick fair,  and among them there was a group of women, every one of whom bore on her  back an incredibly large cage nearly as high as a house, covered over  with white linen. In this cage were every variety of singing birds,  which continually chirped and sung, while their bearers merrily hopped  along and chattered together. It seemed droll thus to behold one bird  carrying others to market.    The night was as dark as pitch when I entered Osterode. I had no  appetite for supper, and at once went to bed. I was as tired as a dog  and slept like a god. In my dreams I returned to Goettingen and found  myself in the library. I stood in a corner of the Hall of Jurisprudence,  turning over old dissertations, lost myself in reading, and, when I  finally looked up, remarked to my astonishment that it was night and  that the hall was illuminated by innumerable over-hanging crystal  chandeliers. The bell of the neighboring church struck twelve, the hall  doors slowly opened, and there entered a superb colossal female form,  reverentially accompanied by the members and hangers-on of the legal  faculty. The giantess, though advanced in years, retained in her  countenance traces of severe beauty, and her every glance indicated the  sublime Titaness, the mighty Themis. The sword and balance were  carelessly grasped in her right hand, while with the left she held a  roll of parchment. Two young _Doctores Juris_ bore the train of her  faded gray robe; by her right side the lean Court Councilor Rusticus,  the Lycurgus of Hanover, fluttered here and there like a zephyr,  declaiming extracts from his last hand-book of law, while on her left  her _cavalier servente_, the privy-councilor of Justice Cujacius,  hobbled gaily and gallantly along, constantly cracking legal jokes,  himself laughing so heartily at his own wit that even the serious  goddess often smiled and bent over him, exclaiming, as she tapped him on  the shoulder with the great parchment roll, \"You little scamp, who begin  to trim the trees from the top!\" All of the gentlemen who formed her  escort now drew nigh in turn, each having something to remark or jest  over, either a freshly worked-up miniature system, or a miserable little  hypothesis, or some similar abortion of their own insignificant brains.  Through the open door of the hall many strange gentlemen now entered,  who announced themselves as the remaining magnates of the illustrious  Order--mostly angular suspicious-looking fellows, who with extreme  complacency blazed away with their definitions and hair-splittings,  disputing over every scrap of a title to the title of a pandect. And  other forms continually flocked in, the forms of those who were learned  in law in the olden time--men in antiquated costume, with long  councilors' wigs and forgotten faces, who expressed themselves greatly  astonished that they, the widely famed of the previous century, should  not meet with special consideration; and these, after their manner,  joined in the general chattering and screaming, which, like ocean  breakers, became louder and madder around the mighty goddess, until she,  bursting with impatience, suddenly cried, in a tone of the most agonized  Titanic pain, \"Silence! Silence! I hear the voice of the beloved  Prometheus. Mocking cunning and brute force are chaining the Innocent  One to the rock of martyrdom, and all your prattling and quarreling will  not allay his wounds or break his fetters!\" So cried the goddess, and  rivulets of tears sprang from her eyes; the entire assembly howled as if  in the agonies of death, the ceiling of the hall burst asunder, the  books tumbled madly from their shelves. In vain did Muenchhausen step out  of his frame to call them to order; it only crashed and raged all the  more wildly. I sought refuge from this Bedlam broken loose in the Hall  of History, near that gracious spot where the holy images of the Apollo  Belvedere and the Venus de Medici stand near each other, and I knelt at  the feet of the Goddess of Beauty. In her glance I forgot all the wild  excitement from which I had escaped, my eyes drank in with intoxication  the symmetry and immortal loveliness of her infinitely blessed form;  Hellenic calm swept through my soul, while above my head Phoebus Apollo  poured forth, like heavenly blessings, the sweetest tones of his lyre.    Awaking, I continued to hear a pleasant, musical sound. The flocks were  on their way to pasture, and their bells were tinkling. The blessed  golden sunlight shone through the window, illuminating the pictures on  the walls of my room. They were sketches from the War of Independence,  which faithfully portrayed what heroes we all were; further, there were  scenes representing executions on the guillotine, from the time of the  revolution under Louis XIV., and other similar decapitations which no  one could behold without thanking God that he lay quietly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12519"],[0,"The Virginia Housewife; Or, Methodical Cook (#11)"],[1,"with  salad, garnished with parsley.           *       *       *       *       *    TO FRICASSEE COD SOUNDS AND TONGUES.    Soak them all night in fresh water, take off the skins, cut them in two  pieces, and boil them in milk and water till quite tender, drain them in  a colander, and season with nutmeg, pepper, and a little salt--take as  much new milk as will make sauce for it, roll a good lump of butter in  flour, melt it in the milk, put the fish in, set it over the fire, and  stir it till thick enough, and serve it up.           *       *       *       *       *    AN EXCELLENT WAY TO DRESS FISH.    Dredge the fish well with flour, sprinkle salt and pepper on them, and  fry them a nice brown; set them by to get cold; put a quarter of a pound  of butter in a frying pan; when it boils, fry tomatos with the skins  taken off, parsley nicely picked, and a very little chopped onion; when  done, add as much water as will make sauce for the fish--season it with  pepper, salt, and pounded cloves; add some wine and mushroom catsup, put  the fish in, and when thoroughly heated, serve it up.           *       *       *       *       *    FISH A-LA-DAUB.    Boil as many large white perch as will be sufficient for the dish; do  not take off their heads, and be careful not to break their skins; when  cold, place them in the dish, and cover them with savoury jelly broken.  A nice piece of rock-fish is excellent done in the same way.           *       *       *       *       *    FISH IN JELLY.    Fill a deep glass dish half full of jelly--have as many small  fish-moulds as will lie conveniently in it fill them with blanc mange;  when they are cold, and the jelly set, lay them on it, as if going in  different directions; put in a little more jelly, and let it get cold,  to keep the fish in their places--then fill the dish so as to cover  them. The jelly should be made of hog's feet, very light coloured, and  perfectly transparent.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE EGG SAUCE FOR A SALT COD.    Boil four eggs hard, first half chop the white, then put in the yelks,  and chop them both together, but not very small; put them into half a  pound of good melted butter, and let it boil up--then pour it on the  fish.           *       *       *       *       *    TO DRESS COD SOUNDS.    Steep your sounds as you do the salt cod, and boil them in a large  quantity of milk and water; when they are very tender and white, take  them up, and drain the water out and skin them; then pour the egg sauce  boiling hot over them, and serve them up.           *       *       *       *       *    TO STEW CARP.    Gut and scale your fish, wash and dry them well with a clean cloth,  dredge them with flour, fry them in lard until they are a light brown,  and then put them in a stew pan with half a pint of water, and half a  pint of red wine, a meat spoonful of lemon pickle, the same of walnut  catsup, a little mushroom powder and cayenne to your taste, a large  onion stuck with cloves, and a slick of horse-radish; cover your pan  close up to keep in the steam; let them stew gently over a stove fire,  till the gravy is reduced to just enough to cover your fish in the dish;  then take the fish out, and put them on the dish you intend for the  table, set the gravy on the fire, and thicken it with flour, and a large  lump of butter; boil it a little, and strain it over your fish; garnish  them with pickled mushrooms and scraped horse-radish, and send them to  the table.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BOIL EELS.    Clean the eels, and cut off their heads, dry them, and turn them round  on your fish plate, boil them in salt and water, and make parsley sauce  for them.           *       *       *       *       *    TO PITCHCOCK EELS.    Skin and wash your eels, then dry them with a cloth, sprinkle them with  pepper, salt, and a little dried sage, turn them backward and forward,  and skewer them; rub a gridiron with beef suet, broil them a nice brown,  put them on a dish with good melted butter, and lay around fried  parsley.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BROIL EELS.    When you have skinned and cleansed your eels as before, rub them with  the yelk of an egg, strew over them bread crumbs, chopped parsley, sage,  pepper, and salt; baste them well with butter, and set them in a  dripping pan; serve them up with parsley and butter for sauce.           *       *       *       *       *    TO SCOLLOP OYSTERS.    When the oysters are opened, put them in a bowl, and wash them out of  their own liquor; put some in the scollop shells, strew over them a few  bread crumbs, and lay a slice of butter on them, then more oysters,  bread crumbs, and a slice of butter on the top; put them into a Dutch  oven to brown, and serve them up in the shells.           *       *       *       *       *    TO FRY OYSTERS.    Take a quarter of a hundred of large oysters, wash them and roll them in  grated bread, with pepper and salt, and fry them a light brown; if you  choose, you may add a little parsley, shred fine. They are a proper  garnish for calves' head, or most made dishes.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE OYSTER LOAVES.    Take little round loaves, cut off the tops, scrape out all the crumbs,  then put the oysters into a stew pan with the crumbs that came out of  the loaves, a little water, and a good lump of butter; stew them  together ten or fifteen minutes, then put in a spoonful of good cream,  fill your loaves, lay the bit of crust carefully on again, set them in  the oven to crisp. Three are enough for a side dish.           *       *       *       *       *      POULTRY, &c.      TO ROAST A GOOSE.    Chop a few sage leaves and two onions very fine, mix them with a good  lump of butter, a tea-spoonful of pepper, and two of salt, put it in the  goose, then split it, lay it down, and dust it with flour; when it is  thoroughly hot, baste it with nice lard; if it be a large one, it will  require an hour and a half, before a good clear fire; when it is enough,  dredge and baste it, pull out the spit, and pour in a little boiling  water.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE SAUCE FOR A GOOSE.    Pare, core and slice some apples; put them in a sauce pan, with as much  water as will keep them from burning, set them over a very slow fire,  keep them closely covered till reduced to a pulp, then put in a lump of  butter, and sugar to your taste, beat them well, and send them to the  table in a china bowl.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BOIL DUCKS WITH ONION SAUCE.    Scald and draw your ducks, put them in warm water for a few minutes,  then take them out and put them in an earthen pot; pour over them a pint  of boiling milk, and let them lie in it two or three hours; when you  take them out, dredge them well with flour, and put them in a copper of  cold water; put on the cover, let them boil slowly twenty minutes, then  take them out, and smother them with onion sauce.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE ONION SAUCE.    Boil eight or ten large onions, change the water two or three times  while they are boiling; when enough, chop them on a board to keep them a  good colour, put them in a sauce pan with a quarter of a pound of butter  and two spoonsful of thick cream; boil it a little, and pour it over the  ducks.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST DUCKS.    When you have drawn the ducks, shred one onion and a few sage leaves,  put them into the ducks with pepper and salt, spit and dust them with  flour, and baste them with lard; if your fire be very hot, they will  roast in twenty minutes; and the quicker they are roasted, the better  they will taste. Just before you take them from the spit, dust them with  flour and baste them. Get ready some gravy made of the gizzards and  pinions, a large blade of mace, a few pepper corns, a spoonful of  catsup, a tea-spoonful of lemon pickle; strain it and pour it on the  ducks, and send onion sauce in a boat.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BOIL A TURKEY WITH OYSTER SAUCE.    Grate a loaf of bread, chop a score or more of oysters fine, add nutmeg,  pepper and salt to your taste, mix it up into a light forcemeat with a  quarter of a pound of butter, a spoonful or two of cream, and three  eggs; stuff the craw with it, and make the rest into balls and boil  them; sew up the turkey, dredge it well with flour, put it in a kettle  of cold water, cover it, and set it over the fire; as the scum begins to  rise, take it off, let it boil very slowly for half an hour, then take  off your kettle and keep it closely covered; if it be of a middle size,  let it stand in the hot water half an hour, the steam being kept in,  will stew it enough, make it rise, keep the skin whole, tender, and very  white; when you dish it, pour on a little oyster sauce, lay the balls  round, and serve it up with the rest of the sauce in a boat.    N.B. Set on the turkey in time, that it may stew as above; it is the  best way to boil one to perfection. Put it over the fire to heat, just  before you dish it up.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE SAUCE FOR A TURKEY.    As you open the oysters, put a pint into a bowl, wash them out of their  own liquor, and put them in another bowl; when the liquor has settled,  pour it off into a sauce pan with a little white gravy, and a  tea-spoonful of lemon pickle--thicken it with flour and a good lump of  butter; boil it three or four minutes, put in a spoonful of good cream,  add the oysters, keep shaking them over the fire till they are quite  hot, but don't let them boil, for it will make them hard and appear  small.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST A TURKEY.    Make the forcemeat thus: take the crumb of a loaf of bread, a quarter of  a pound of beef suet shred fine, a little sausage meat or veal scraped  and pounded "]]]
