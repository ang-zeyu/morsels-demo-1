WHAT THE NEGRO WAS THINKING DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY        ESSAY ON NEGRO SLAVERY[1]    NO. 1      Amidst the infinite variety of moral and political subjects, proper for  public commendation, it is truly surprising, that one of the most  important and affecting should be so generally neglected. An encroachment  on the smallest civil or political privilege, shall fan the enthusiastic  flames of liberty, till it shall extend over vast and distant regions, and  violently agitate a whole continent. But the cause of humanity shall be  basely violated, justice shall be wounded to the heart, and national honor  deeply and lastingly polluted, and not a breath or murmur shall arise to  disturb the prevailing quiescence or to rouse the feelings of indignation  against such general, extensive, and complicated iniquity.--To what cause  are we to impute this frigid silence--this torpid indifference--this cold  inanimated conduct of the otherwise warm and generous Americans? Why do  they remain inactive, amidst the groans of injured humanity, the shrill  and distressing complaints of expiring justice and the keen remorse of  polluted integrity?--Why do they not rise up to assert the cause of God  and the world, to drive the fiend injustice into remote and distant  regions, and to exterminate oppression from the face of the fair fields of  America?    When the united colonies revolted from Great Britain, they did it upon  this principle, \"that all men are by nature and of right ought to be  free.\"--After a long, successful, and glorious struggle for liberty,  during which they manifested the firmest attachment to the rights of  mankind, can they so soon forget the principles that then governed their  determinations? Can Americans, after the noble contempt they expressed for  tyrants, meanly descend to take up the scourge? Blush, ye revolted  colonies, for having apostatized from your own principles.    Slavery, in whatever point of light it is considered, is repugnant to the  feelings of nature, and inconsistent with the original rights of man. It  ought therefore to be stigmatized for being unnatural; and detested for  being unjust. Tis an outrage to providence and an affront offered to divine  Majesty, who has given to man his own peculiar image.--That the Americans  after considering the subject in this light--after making the most manly  of all possible exertions in defence of liberty--after publishing to the  world the principle upon which they contended, viz.: \"that all men are by  nature and of right ought to be free,\" should still retain in subjection  a numerous tribe of the human race merely for their own private use and  emolument, is, of all things the strongest inconsistency, the deepest  reflexion on our conduct, and the most abandoned apostasy that ever took  place, since the almighty fiat spoke into existence this habitable world.  So flagitous a violation can never escape the notice of a just Creator  whose vengeance may be now on the wing, to disseminate and hurl the arrows  of destruction.    In what light can the people of Europe consider America after the strange  inconsistency of her conduct? Will they not consider her as an abandoned  and deceitful country? In the hour of calamity she petitioned heaven to be  propitious to her cause. Her prayers were heard. Heaven pitied her  distress, smiled on her virtuous exertions, and vanquished all her  afflictions. The ungrateful creature forgets this timely assistance--no  longer remembers her own sorrows--but basely commences oppression in her  turn.--Beware America! pause--and consider the difference between the mild  effulgence of approving providence and the angry countenance of incensed  divinity!    The importation of slaves into America ought to be a subject of the deepest  regret, to every benevolent and thinking mind.--And one of the greatest  defects in the federal system, is the liberty it allows on this head.  Venerable in every thing else, it is injudicious here; and it is to be much  deplored, that a system of so much political perfection, should be stained  with any thing that does an outrage to human nature. As a door, however, is  open to amendment, for the sake of distressed humanity, of injured national  reputation, and the glory of doing so benevolent a thing, I hope some wise  and virtuous patriot will advocate the measure, and introduce an alteration  in that pernicious part of the government.--So far from encouraging the  importation of slaves, and countenancing that vile traffic in human flesh;  the members of the late continental convention[2] should have seized the  happy opportunity of prohibiting for ever this cruel species of reprobated  villainy.--That they did not do so, will for ever diminish the luster of  their other proceedings, so highly extolled, and so justly distinguished  for their intrinsic value. Let us for a moment contrast the sentiments and  actions of the Europeans on this subject, with those of our own countrymen.  In France the warmest and most animated exertions are making, in order to  introduce the entire abolition of the slave trade; and in England many of  the first characters of the country advocate the same measure, with an  enthusiastic philanthropy. The prime minister himself is at the head of  that society; and nothing can equal the ardour of their endeavours, but the  glorious goodness of the cause.[3]--Will the Americans allow the people of  England to get the start of them in acts of humanity? Forbid it shame!    The practice of stealing, or bartering for human flesh is pregnant with the  most glaring turpitude, and the blackest barbarity of disposition.--For can  any one say, that this is doing as he would be done by? Will such a  practice stand the scrutiny of this great rule of moral government? Who can  without the complicated emotions of anger and impatience, suppose himself  in the predicament of a slave? Who can bear the thoughts of his relatives  being torn from him by a savage enemy; carried to distant regions of the  habitable globe, never more to return; and treated there as the unhappy  Africans are in this country? Who can support the reflexion of his  father--his mother--his sister--or his wife--perhaps his children--being  barbarously snatched away by a foreign invader, without the prospect of  ever beholding them again? Who can reflect upon their being afterwards  publicly exposed to sale--obliged to labor with unwearied assiduity--and  because all things are not possible to be performed, by persons so  unaccustomed to robust exercise, scourged with all the rage and anger of  malignity, until their unhappy carcasses are covered with ghastly wounds  and frightful contusions? Who can reflect on these things when applying the  case to himself, without being chilled with horror, at circumstances so  extremely shocking?--Yet hideous as this concise and imperfect description  is, of the sufferings sustained by many of our slaves, it is nevertheless  true; and so far from being exaggerated, falls infinitely short of a  thousand circumstances of distress, which have been recounted by different  writers on the subject, and which contribute to make their situation in  this life, the most absolutely wretched, and completely miserable, that can  possibly be conceived.--In many places in America, the slaves are treated  with every circumstance of rigorous inhumanity, accumulated hardship, and  enormous cruelty.--Yet when we take them from Africa, we deprive them of a  country which God hath given them for their own; as free as we are, and as  capable of enjoying that blessing. Like pirates we go to commit devastation  on the coast of an innocent country, and among a people who never did us  wrong.    An insatiable, avaricious desire to accumulate riches, cooperating with a  spirit of luxury and injustice, seems to be the leading cause of this  peculiarly degrading and ignominious practice. Being once accustomed to  subsist without labour, we become soft and voluptuous; and rather than  afterwards forego the gratification of our habitual indolence and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13643"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#11)"],[1,"Count Roszynski,  with the several members of his family, had come out to pass in review  his growing subjects. He was a small and insignificant-looking man,  about fifty years of age, with deep-set eyes and overhanging brows.  His wife, who was nearly of the same age, was immensely stout, with  a vulgar face and a loud, disagreeable voice. She made herself  ridiculous in endeavoring to imitate the manners and bearing of the  aristocracy, into whose sphere she and her husband were determined  to force themselves, in spite of the humbleness of their origin. The  father of the \"Right-Honorable\" Count Roszynski was a valet, who,  having been a great favorite with his master, amassed sufficient money  to enable his son, who inherited it, to purchase the extensive estate  of Olgogrod, and with it the sole proprietorship of 1600 human beings.  Over them he had complete control; and, when maddened by oppression,  if they dared resent, woe unto them! They could be thrust into a  noisome dungeon, and chained by one hand from the light of day for  years, until their very existence was forgotten by all except the  jailor who brought daily their pitcher of water and morsel of dry  bread.    Some of the old peasants say that Sava, father of the young peasant  girl, who stands by the side of an old woman, at the head of her  companions in the court-yard, is immured in one of these subterranean  jails. Sava was always about the Count, who, it was said, had brought  him from some distant land, with his little motherless child. Sava  placed her under the care of an old man and woman, who had the charge  of the bees in a forest near the palace, where he came occasionally to  visit her. But once, six long months passed, and he did not come! In  vain Anielka wept, in vain she cried, \"Where is my father?\" No father  appeared. At last it was said that Sava had been sent to a long  distance with a large sum of money, and had been killed by robbers.  In the ninth year of one's life the most poignant grief is quickly  effaced, and after six months Anielka ceased to grieve. The old people  were very kind to her, and loved her as if sue were their own child.  That Anielka might be chosen to serve in the palace never entered  their head, for who would be so barbarous as to take the child away  from an old woman of seventy and her aged husband?    To-day was the first time in her life that she had been so far from  home. She looked curiously on all she saw,--particularly on a young  lady about her own age, beautifully dressed, and a youth of eighteen,  who had apparently just returned from a ride on horse-back, as he held  a whip in his hand, whilst walking up and down examining the boys who  were placed in a row before him. He chose two amongst them, and the  boys were led away to the stables.    \"And I choose this young girl,\" said Constantia Roszynski, indicating  Anielka; \"she is the prettiest of them all. I do not like ugly faces  about me.\"    When Constantia returned to the drawing-room, she gave orders for  Anielka to be taken to her apartments, and placed under the tutelage  of Mademoiselle Dufour, a French maid, recently arrived from the first  milliner's shop in Odessa. Poor girl! when they separated her from her  adopted mother, and began leading her toward the palace, she rushed,  with a shriek of agony, from them, and grasped her old protectress  tightly in her arms! They were torn violently asunder, and the Count  Roszynski quietly asked, \"Is it her daughter, or her grand-daughter?\"    \"Neither, my lord,--only an adopted, child.\"    \"But who will lead the old woman home, as she is blind?\"    \"I will, my lord,\" replied one of his servants, bowing to the ground;  \"I will let her, walk by the side of my horse, and when she is in  her cabin she will have her old husband,--they must take care of each  other.\"    So saying, he moved away with the rest of the peasants and domestics.  But the poor old woman had to be dragged along by two men; for in the  midst of her shrieks and tears she had fallen to the ground, almost  without life.    And Anielka? They did not allow her to weep long. She had now to  sit all day in the corner of a room to sew. She was expected to do  everything well from the first; and if she did not, she was kept  without food or cruelly punished. Morning and evening she had to  help Mdlle. Dufour to dress and undress her mistress. But Constantia,  although she looked with hauteur on everybody beneath her, and  expected to be slavishly obeyed, was tolerably kind to the poor  orphan. Her true torment began, when, on laving her young lady's  room, she had to assist Mdlle. Dufour. Notwithstanding that she tried  sincerely to do her best, she was never able to satisfy her, or to  draw from her naught but harsh reproaches.    Thus two months passed.    One day Mdlle. Dufour went very early to confession, and Anielka was  seized with an eager longing to gaze once more in peace and freedom  on the beautiful blue sky and green trees, as she used to do when the  first rays of the rising sun streamed in at the window of the little  forest cabin. She ran into the garden. Enchanted by the sight of so  many beautiful flowers, she went farther and farther along the smooth  and winding walks. till she entered the forest. She who had been, so  long away from her beloved trees, roamed where they were thickest.  Here she gazes boldly around. She sees no one! She is alone! A little  farther on she meets with a rivulet which flows through the forest.  Here she remembers that she has not yet prayed. She kneels down, and  with hands clasped and eyes upturned she begins to sing in a sweet  voice the Hymn to the virgin.    As she went on she sang louder and with increased fervor. Her breast  heaved with emotion, her eyes shone with unusual brilliancy; but when  the hymn was finished she lowered her head, tears began to fall over  her cheeks, until at last she sobbed aloud. She might have remained  long in this condition, had not some one come behind her, saying,  \"Do not cry, my poor girl; it is better to sing than to weep.\" The  intruder raised her head, wiped her eyes with his handkerchief, and  kissed her on the forehead.    It was the Count's son, Leon!    \"You must not cry,\" he continued; \"be calm, and when the filipony  (peddlers) come, buy yourself a pretty handkerchief.\" He then gave  her a ruble and walked away. Anielka, after concealing the coin in her  corset, ran quickly back to the palace.    Fortunately, Mdlle. Dufour had not yet returned, and Anielka seated  herself in her accustomed corner. She often took out the ruble to,  gaze fondly upon it, and set to work to make a little purse, which,  having fastened to a ribbon, she hung round her neck. She did not  dream of spending it, for it would have deeply grieved her to part  with the gift of the only person in the whole house who had looked  kindly on her.    From this time Anielka remained always in her young mistress's room;  she was better dressed, and Mdlle. Dufour ceased to persecute her. To  what did she owe this sudden change? Perhaps to a remonstrance from  Leon. Constantia ordered Anielka to sit beside her whilst taking her  lessons from her music masters, and on her going to the drawing-room,  she was left in her apartments alone. Being thus more kindly treated.  Anielka lost by degrees her timidity; and when her young mistress,  whilst occupied over some embroidery, would tell her to sing, she  did so boldly and with a steady voice. A greater favor awaited her.  Constantia, when unoccupied, began teaching Anielka to read in Polish;  and Mdlle. Dufour thought it politic to follow the example of her  mistress, and began to teach her French.    Meanwhile, a new kind of torment commenced. Having easily learnt the  two languages, Anielka acquired an irresistible passion for reading.  Books had for her the charm of the forbidden fruit, for she could only  read by stealth at night, or when her mistress went visiting in the  neighborhood. The kindness hitherto shown her for a time, began to  relax. Leon had set off on a tour, accompanied by his old tutor, and a  bosom friend, as young, as gay, and as thoughtless as himself.    So passed the two years of Leon's absence. When he returned, Anielka  was seventeen, and had become tall and handsome. No one who had  not seen her during this time, would have recognized her. Of this  number was Leon. In the midst of perpetual gayety and change, it  was not possible he could have remembered a poor peasant girl; but  in Anielka's memory he had remained as a superior being, as her  benefactor, as the only one who had spoken kindly to her, when poor,  neglected, forlorn! When in some French romance she met with a young  man of twenty, of a noble character and handsome appearance, she  bestowed on him the name of Leon. The recollection of the kiss be had  given her ever brought a burning blush to her cheek, and made her sigh  deeply.    One day Leon came to his sister's room. Anielka was there, seated in  a corner at work. Leon himself had considerably changed; from a boy he  had grown into a man. \"I suppose, Constantia,\" he said, \"you have  been told what a, good boy I am, and with what docility I shall submit  myself to the matrimonial yoke, which the Count and Countess have  provided for me?\" and he began whistling, and danced some steps of the  Mazurka.    \"Perhaps you will be refused,\" said Constantia coldly.    \"Refused! Oh, no. The old Prince has already given his consent, and  as for his daughter, she is desperately in love with me. Look at these  moustachios; could anything be more irresistible?\" and he glanced in  the glass and twirled them round his fingers; then continuing in a  graver tone, he said, \"To tell the sober truth, I cannot say that  I reciprocate. My intended is not at all to my taste. She is nearly  thirty, and so thin, that whenever I look at her, I am reminded of  my old tutor's anatomical sketches."]]]
