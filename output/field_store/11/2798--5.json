They sat and  smoked together until long after midnight, or eight bells,\" and the  clerk smiled as he glanced down at the big diamond ring on his little  finger.    \"They did?\" fairly exploded Tom, for he had visions of what the wily  Mr. Berg might worm out of the simple captain.    \"Yes. Why, isn't the captain a proper man to make friends with?\" and  the clerk looked at Tom curiously.    \"Oh, yes, of course,\" was the hasty answer. \"I guess I'll go and see if  I can find him--the captain, I mean.\"    Tom hardly knew what to think. He wished his father, or Mr. Sharp, had  thought to warn Captain Weston against talking of the wreck. It might  be too late now.    The young inventor hurried to the beach, which was not far from the  hotel. He saw a solitary figure pacing up and down, and from the fact  that the man stopped, every now and then, and gazed seaward through a  large telescope, the lad concluded it was the captain for whom he was  in search. He approached, his footsteps making no sound on the sand.  The man was still gazing through the glass.    \"Captain Weston?\" spoke Tom.    Without a show of haste, though the voice must have startled him, the  captain turned. Slowly he lowered the telescope, and then he replied  softly:    \"That's my name. Who are you, if I may ask?\"    Tom was struck, more than by anything else, by the gentle voice of the  seaman. He had prepared himself, from the description of Mr. Sharp, to  meet a gruff, bewhiskered individual, with a voice like a crosscut saw,  and a rolling gait. Instead he saw a man of medium size, with a smooth  face, merry blue eyes, and the softest voice and gentlest manner  imaginable. Tom was very much disappointed. He had looked for a regular  sea-dog, and he met a landsman, as he said afterward. But it was not  long before our hero changed his mind regarding Captain Weston.    \"I'm Tom Swift,\" the owner of that name said, \"and I have been sent to  show you the way to where our ship is ready to launch.\" The young  inventor refrained from mentioning submarine, as it was the wish of Mr  Sharp to disclose this feature of the voyage to the sailor himself.    \"Ha, I thought as much,\" resumed the captain quietly.  \"It's a fine  day, if I may be permitted to say so,\" and he seemed to hesitate, as if  there was some doubt whether or not he might make that observation.    \"It certainly is,\" agreed the lad. Then, with a smile he added: \"It is  nearly four bells.\"    \"Ha!\" exclaimed the captain, also smiling, but even his manner of  saying \"Ha!\" was less demonstrative than that of most persons. \"I  believe I am getting hungry, if I may be allowed the remark,\" and again  he seemed asking Tom's pardon for mentioning the fact.    \"Perhaps you will come back to the cabin and have a little breakfast  with me,\" he went on. \"I don't know what sort of a galley or cook they  have aboard the Beach Hotel, but it can't be much worse than some I've  tackled.\"    \"No, thank you,\" answered the youth. \"I've had my breakfast. But I'll  wait for you, and then I'd like to get back. Dad and Mr. Sharp are  anxious to meet you.\"    \"And I am anxious to meet them, if you don't mind me mentioning it,\"  was the reply, as the captain once more put the spyglass to his eye and  took an observation. \"Not many sails in sight this morning,\" he added.  \"But the weather is fine, and we ought to get off in good shape to hunt  for the treasure about which Mr. Sharp wrote me. I believe we are going  after treasure,\" he said; \"that is, if you don't mind talking about it.\"    \"Not in the least,\" replied Tom quickly, thinking this a good  opportunity for broaching a subject that was worrying him. \"Did you  meet a Mr. Berg here last night, Captain Weston?\" he went on.    \"Yes. Mr. Berg and I had quite a talk. He is a well-informed man.\"    \"Did he mention the sunken treasure?\" asked the lad, eager to find out  if his suspicions were true.    \"Yes, he did, if you'll excuse me putting it so plainly,\" answered the  seaman, as if Tom might be offended at so direct a reply. But the young  inventor was soon to learn that this was only an odd habit with the  seaman.    \"Did he want to know where the wreck of the Boldero was located?\"  continued the lad. \"That is, did he try to discover if you knew  anything about it?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Weston, \"he did. He pumped me, if you are acquainted  with that term, and are not offended by it. You see, when I arrived  here I made inquiries as to where your father's place was located. Mr.  Berg overheard me, and introduced himself as agent for a shipbuilding  concern. He was very friendly, and when he said he knew you and your  parent, I thought he was all right.\"    Tom's heart sank. His worst fears were to be realized, he thought.    \"Yes, he and I talked considerable, if I may be permitted to say so,\"  went on the captain. \"He seemed to know about the wreck of the Boldero,  and that she had three hundred thousand dollars in gold aboard. The  only thing he didn't know was where the wreck was located. He knew it  was off Uruguay somewhere, but just where he couldn't say. So he asked  me if I knew, since he must have concluded that I was going with you on  the gold-hunting expedition.\"    \"And you do know, don't you?\" asked Tom eagerly.    \"Well, I have it pretty accurately charted out, if you will allow me  that expression,\" was the calm answer. \"I took pains to look it up at  the request of Mr. Sharp.\"    \"And he wanted to worm that information out of you?\" inquired the youth  excitedly.    \"Yes, I'm afraid he did.\"    \"Did you give him the location?\"    \"Well,\" remarked the captain, as he took another observation before  closing up the telescope, \"you see, while we were talking, I happened  to drop a copy of a map I'd made, showing the location of the wreck.  Mr. Berg picked it up to hand to me, and he looked at it.\"    \"Oh!\" cried Tom. \"Then he knows just where the treasure is, and he may  get to it ahead of us. It's too bad.\"    \"Yes,\" continued the seaman calmly, \"Mr. Berg picked up that map, and  he looked very closely at the latitude and longitude I had marked as  the location of the wreck.\"    \"Then he won't have any trouble finding it,\" murmured our hero.    \"Eh? What's that?\" asked the captain, \"if I may be permitted to request  you to repeat what you said.\"    \"I say he won't have any trouble locating the sunken Boldero,\" repeated  Tom.    \"Oh, but I think he will, if he depends on that map,\" was the  unexpected reply. \"You see,\" explained Mr. Weston, \"I'm not so simple  as I look. I sensed what Mr. Berg was after, the minute he began to  talk to me. So I fixed up a little game on him. The map which I dropped  on purpose, not accidentally, where he would see it, did have the  location of the wreck marked. Only it didn't happen to be the right  location. It was about five hundred miles out of the way, and I rather  guess if Mr. Berg and his friends go there for treasure they'll find  considerable depth of water and quite a lonesome spot. Oh, no, I'm not  as easy as I look, if you don't mind me mentioning that fact; and when  a scoundrel sets out to get the best of me, I generally try to turn the  tables on him. I've seen such men as Mr. Berg before. I'm afraid, I'm  very much afraid, the sight he had of the fake map I made won't do him  much good. Well, I declare, it's past four bells. Let's go to  breakfast, if you don't mind me asking you,\" and with that the captain  started off up the beach, Tom following, his ideas all a whirl at the  unlooked-for outcome of the interview.          Chapter Ten    Trial of the Submarine      Tom felt such a relief at hearing of Captain Weston's ruse that his  appetite, sharpened by an early breakfast and the sea air, came to him  with a rush, and he had a second morning meal with the odd sea captain,  who chuckled heartily when he thought of how Mr Berg had been deceived.    \"Yes,\" resumed Captain Weston, over his bacon and eggs, \"I sized him up  for a slick article as soon as I laid eyes on him. But he evidently  misjudged me, if I may be permitted that term. Oh, well, we may meet  again, after we secure the treasure, and then I can show him the real  map of the location of the wreck.\"    \"Then you have it?\" inquired the lad eagerly.    Captain Weston nodded, before hiding his face behind a large cup of  coffee; his third, by the way.    \"Let me see it?\" asked Tom quickly. The captain set down his cup. He  looked carefully about the hotel dining-room.  There were several  guests, who, like himself, were having a late breakfast.    \"It's a good plan,\" the sailor said slowly, \"when you're going into  unknown waters, and don't want to leave a wake for the other fellow to  follow, to keep your charts locked up. If it's all the same to you,\" he  added diffidently, \"I'd rather wait until we get to where your father  and Mr. Sharp are before displaying the real map. I've no objection to  showing you the one Mr. Berg saw,\" and again he chuckled.    The young inventor blushed at his indiscretion. He felt that the news  of the search for the treasure had leaked out through him, though he  was the one to get on the trail of it by seeing the article in the  paper. Now he had nearly been guilty of another break. He realized that  he must be more cautious. The captain saw his confusion, and said:    \"I know how it is. You're eager to get under way. I don't blame you. I  was the same myself when I was your age. But we'll soon be at your  place, and then I'll tell you all I know. Sufficient now, to say that I  believe I have located the wreck within a few miles. I got on the track  of a sailor who had met one of the shipwrecked crew of the Boldero, and  he gave me valuable information. Now tell me about the craft we are  going in. A good deal depends on that.\"    Tom hardly knew what to answer. He recalled what Mr. Sharp had said  about not wanting to tell Captain Weston, until the last moment, that  they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#10)"],[1,"people  love him. For a moment I could not bear to speak or break the poor  fellow's illusion. But tough old Sapt had no such feeling. He slapped  his hand on his thigh delightedly.    \"Bravo, lad!\" cried he. \"We shall do!\"    Fritz looked up in bewilderment. I held out my hand.    \"You're wounded, sire!\" he exclaimed.    \"It's only a scratch,\" said I, \"but--\" I paused.    He rose to his feet with a bewildered air. Holding my hand, he looked  me up and down, and down and up. Then suddenly he dropped my hand and  reeled back.    \"Where's the King? Where's the King?\" he cried.    \"Hush, you fool!\" hissed Sapt. \"Not so loud! Here's the King!\"    A knock sounded on the door. Sapt seized me by the hand.    \"Here, quick, to the bedroom! Off with your cap and boots. Get into bed.  Cover everything up.\"    I did as I was bid. A moment later Sapt looked in, nodded, grinned, and  introduced an extremely smart and deferential young gentleman, who came  up to my bedside, bowing again and again, and informed me that he was  of the household of the Princess Flavia, and that her Royal Highness  had sent him especially to enquire how the King's health was after the  fatigues which his Majesty had undergone yesterday.    \"My best thanks, sir, to my cousin,\" said I; \"and tell her Royal  Highness that I was never better in my life.\"    \"The King,\" added old Sapt (who, I began to find, loved a good lie for  its own sake), \"has slept without a break all night.\"    The young gentleman (he reminded me of \"Osric\" in Hamlet) bowed himself  out again. The farce was over, and Fritz von Tarlenheim's pale face  recalled us to reality--though, in faith, the farce had to be reality  for us now.    \"Is the King dead?\" he whispered.    \"Please God, no,\" said I. \"But he's in the hands of Black Michael!\"          CHAPTER 8    A Fair Cousin and a Dark Brother      A real king's life is perhaps a hard one; but a pretended king's is,  I warrant, much harder. On the next day, Sapt instructed me in my  duties--what I ought to do and what I ought to know--for three hours;  then I snatched breakfast, with Sapt still opposite me, telling me that  the King always took white wine in the morning and was known to detest  all highly seasoned dishes. Then came the Chancellor, for another three  hours; and to him I had to explain that the hurt to my finger (we turned  that bullet to happy account) prevented me from writing--whence arose  great to-do, hunting of precedents and so forth, ending in my \"making  my mark,\" and the Chancellor attesting it with a superfluity of solemn  oaths. Then the French ambassador was introduced, to present his  credentials; here my ignorance was of no importance, as the King would  have been equally raw to the business (we worked through the whole _corps  diplomatique_ in the next few days, a demise of the Crown necessitating  all this bother).    Then, at last, I was left alone. I called my new servant (we had chosen,  to succeed poor Josef, a young man who had never known the King), had a  brandy-and-soda brought to me, and observed to Sapt that I trusted that  I might now have a rest. Fritz von Tarlenheim was standing by.    \"By heaven!\" he cried, \"we waste time. Aren't we going to throw Black  Michael by the heels?\"    \"Gently, my son, gently,\" said Sapt, knitting his brows. \"It would be  a pleasure, but it might cost us dear. Would Michael fall and leave the  King alive?\"    \"And,\" I suggested, \"while the King is here in Strelsau, on his throne,  what grievance has he against his dear brother Michael?\"    \"Are we to do nothing, then?\"    \"We're to do nothing stupid,\" growled Sapt.    \"In fact, Fritz,\" said I, \"I am reminded of a situation in one of our  English plays--The Critic--have you heard of it? Or, if you like, of two  men, each covering the other with a revolver. For I can't expose Michael  without exposing myself--\"    \"And the King,\" put in Sapt.    \"And, hang me if Michael won't expose himself, if he tries to expose  me!\"    \"It's very pretty,\" said old Sapt.    \"If I'm found out,\" I pursued, \"I will make a clean breast of it, and  fight it out with the duke; but at present I'm waiting for a move from  him.\"    \"He'll kill the King,\" said Fritz.    \"Not he,\" said Sapt.    \"Half of the Six are in Strelsau,\" said Fritz.    \"Only half? You're sure?\" asked Sapt eagerly.    \"Yes--only half.\"    \"Then the King's alive, for the other three are guarding him!\" cried  Sapt.    \"Yes--you're right!\" exclaimed Fritz, his face brightening. \"If the  King were dead and buried, they'd all be here with Michael. You know  Michael's back, colonel?\"    \"I know, curse him!\"    \"Gentlemen, gentlemen,\" said I, \"who are the Six?\"    \"I think you'll make their acquaintance soon,\" said Sapt. \"They are six  gentlemen whom Michael maintains in his household: they belong to him  body and soul. There are three Ruritanians; then there's a Frenchman, a  Belgian, and one of your countrymen.\"    \"They'd all cut a throat if Michael told them,\" said Fritz.    \"Perhaps they'll cut mine,\" I suggested.    \"Nothing more likely,\" agreed Sapt. \"Who are here, Fritz?\"    \"De Gautet, Bersonin, and Detchard.\"    \"The foreigners! It's as plain as a pikestaff. He's brought them, and  left the Ruritanians with the King; that's because he wants to commit  the Ruritanians as deep as he can.\"    \"They were none of them among our friends at the lodge, then?\" I asked.    \"I wish they had been,\" said Sapt wistfully. \"They had been, not six,  but four, by now.\"    I had already developed one attribute of royalty--a feeling that I need  not reveal all my mind or my secret designs even to my intimate friends.  I had fully resolved on my course of action. I meant to make myself  as popular as I could, and at the same time to show no disfavour to  Michael. By these means I hoped to allay the hostility of his adherents,  and make it appear, if an open conflict came about, that he was  ungrateful and not oppressed.    Yet an open conflict was not what I hoped for.    The King's interest demanded secrecy; and while secrecy lasted, I had  a fine game to play in Strelsau, Michael should not grow stronger for  delay!    I ordered my horse, and, attended by Fritz von Tarlenheim, rode in the  grand new avenue of the Royal Park, returning all the salutes which I  received with punctilious politeness. Then I rode through a few of the  streets, stopped and bought flowers of a pretty girl, paying her with  a piece of gold; and then, having attracted the desired amount of  attention (for I had a trail of half a thousand people after me), I rode  to the residence of the Princess Flavia, and asked if she would  receive me. This step created much interest, and was met with shouts of  approval. The princess was very popular, and the Chancellor himself had  not scrupled to hint to me that the more I pressed my suit, and the more  rapidly I brought it to a prosperous conclusion, the stronger should I  be in the affection of my subjects. The Chancellor, of course, did not  understand the difficulties which lay in the way of following his loyal  and excellent advice. However, I thought I could do no harm by calling;  and in this view Fritz supported me with a cordiality that surprised me,  until he confessed that he also had his motives for liking a visit to  the princess's house, which motive was no other than a great desire to  see the princess's lady-in-waiting and bosom friend, the Countess Helga  von Strofzin.    Etiquette seconded Fritz's hopes. While I was ushered into the  princess's room, he remained with the countess in the ante-chamber: in  spite of the people and servants who were hanging about, I doubt not  that they managed a tete-a-tete; but I had no leisure to think of them,  for I was playing the most delicate move in all my difficult game. I had  to keep the princess devoted to me--and yet indifferent to me: I had to  show affection for her--and not feel it. I had to make love for another,  and that to a girl who--princess or no princess--was the most beautiful  I had ever seen. Well, I braced myself to the task, made no easier by  the charming embarrassment with which I was received. How I succeeded in  carrying out my programme will appear hereafter.    \"You are gaining golden laurels,\" she said. \"You are like the prince in  Shakespeare who was transformed by becoming king. But I'm forgetting you  are King, sire.\"    \"I ask you to speak nothing but what your heart tells you--and to call  me nothing but my name.\"    She looked at me for a moment.    \"Then I'm glad and proud, Rudolf,\" said she. \"Why, as I told you, your  very face is changed.\"    I acknowledged the compliment, but I disliked the topic; so I said:    \"My brother is back, I hear. He made an excursion, didn't he?\"    \"Yes, he is here,\" she said, frowning a little.    \"He can't stay long from Strelsau, it seems,\" I observed, smiling.  \"Well, we are all glad to see him. The nearer he is, the better.\"    The princess glanced at me with a gleam of amusement in her eyes.    \"Why, cousin? Is it that you can--?\"    \"See better what he's doing? Perhaps,\" said I. \"And why are you glad?\"    \"I didn't say I was glad,\" she answered.    \"Some people say so for you.\"    \"There are many insolent people,\" she said, with delightful haughtiness.    \"Possibly you mean that I am one?\"    \"Your Majesty could not be,\" she said, curtseying in feigned deference,  but adding, mischievously, after a pause: \"Unless, that is--\"    \"Well, unless what?\"    \"Unless you tell me that I mind a snap of my fingers where the Duke of  Strelsau is.\"    Really, I wished that I had been the King.    \"You don't care where cousin Michael--\"    \"Ah, cousin Michael! I call him the Duke of Strelsau.\"    \"You call him Michael when you meet him?\"    \"Yes--by the orders of your father.\"    \"I see. And now by mine?\"    \"If those are your orders.\"    \"Oh, decidedly! We must all be pleasant to our dear Michael.\"    \"You order me to receive his friends, too,"]]]
