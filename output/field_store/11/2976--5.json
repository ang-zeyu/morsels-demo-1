At which  they all exclaimed,--       \"Lettuce! O lettuce      Let us, O let us,      O lettuce-leaves,      O let us leave this tree, and eat      Lettuce, O let us, lettuce-leaves!\"    And instantly the seven young Guinea Pigs rushed with such extreme force  against the lettuce-plant, and hit their heads so vividly against its  stalk, that the concussion brought on directly an incipient transitional  inflammation of their noses, which grew worse and worse and worse and  worse, till it incidentally killed them all seven.    And that was the end of the seven young Guinea Pigs.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER X.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG CATS.    The seven young Cats set off on their travels with great delight and  rapacity. But, on coming to the top of a high hill, they perceived at a  long distance off a Clangle-Wangle (or, as it is more properly written,  Clangel-Wangel); and, in spite of the warning they had had, they ran  straight up to it.    (Now, the Clangle-Wangle is a most dangerous and delusive beast, and by no  means commonly to be met with. They live in the water as well as on land,  using their long tail as a sail when in the former element. Their speed is  extreme; but their habits of life are domestic and superfluous, and their  general demeanor pensive and pellucid. On summer evenings, they may  sometimes be observed near the Lake Pipple-Popple, standing on their heads,  and humming their national melodies. They subsist entirely on vegetables,  excepting when they eat veal or mutton or pork or beef or fish or  saltpetre.)    The moment the Clangle-Wangle saw the seven young Cats approach, he ran  away; and as he ran straight on for four months, and the Cats, though they  continued to run, could never overtake him, they all gradually _died_ of  fatigue and exhaustion, and never afterwards recovered.    And this was the end of the seven young Cats.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER XI.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG FISHES.    The seven young Fishes swam across the Lake Pipple-Popple, and into the  river, and into the ocean; where, most unhappily for them, they saw, on the  fifteenth day of their travels, a bright-blue Boss-Woss, and instantly swam  after him. But the Blue Boss-Woss plunged into a      perpendicular,          spicular,              orbicular,                  quadrangular,                       circular depth of soft mud;  where, in fact, his house was.    And the seven young Fishes, swimming with great and uncomfortable velocity,  plunged also into the mud quite against their will, and, not being  accustomed to it, were all suffocated in a very short period.    And that was the end of the seven young Fishes.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER XII.    OF WHAT OCCURRED SUBSEQUENTLY.    After it was known that the                seven young Parrots,      and the seven young Storks,      and the seven young Geese,      and the seven young Owls,      and the seven young Guinea Pigs,      and the seven young Cats,      and the seven young Fishes,    were all dead, then the Frog, and the Plum-pudding Flea, and the Mouse, and  the Clangle-Wangle, and the Blue Boss-Woss, all met together to rejoice  over their good fortune. And they collected the seven feathers of the seven  young Parrots, and the seven bills of the seven young Storks, and the  lettuce, and the cherry; and having placed the latter on the lettuce, and  the other objects in a circular arrangement at their base, they danced a  hornpipe round all these memorials until they were quite tired; after which  they gave a tea-party, and a garden-party, and a ball, and a concert, and  then returned to their respective homes full of joy and respect, sympathy,  satisfaction, and disgust.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER XIII.    OF WHAT BECAME OF THE PARENTS OF THE FORTY-NINE CHILDREN.    BUT when the two old Parrots,       and the two old Storks,       and the two old Geese,       and the two old Owls,       and the two old Guinea Pigs,       and the two old Cats,       and the two old Fishes,    became aware, by reading in the newspapers, of the calamitous extinction of  the whole of their families, they refused all further sustenance; and,  sending out to various shops, they purchased great quantities of Cayenne  pepper and brandy and vinegar and blue sealing-wax, besides seven immense  glass bottles with air-tight stoppers. And, having done this, they ate a  light supper of brown-bread and Jerusalem artichokes, and took an  affecting and formal leave of the whole of their acquaintance, which was  very numerous and distinguished and select and responsible and ridiculous.      CHAPTER XIV.    CONCLUSION.    And after this they filled the bottles with the ingredients for pickling,  and each couple jumped into a separate bottle; by which effort, of course,  they all died immediately, and became thoroughly pickled in a few minutes;  having previously made their wills (by the assistance of the most eminent  lawyers of the district), in which they left strict orders that the  stoppers of the seven bottles should be carefully sealed up with the blue  sealing-wax they had purchased; and that they themselves, in the bottles,  should be presented to the principal museum of the city of Tosh, to be  labelled with parchment or any other anti-congenial succedaneum, and to be  placed on a marble table with silver-gilt legs, for the daily inspection  and contemplation, and for the perpetual benefit, of the pusillanimous  public.    And if you ever happen to go to Gramble-Blamble, and visit that museum in  the city of Tosh, look for them on the ninety-eighth table in the four  hundred and twenty-seventh room of the right-hand corridor of the left wing  of the central quadrangle of that magnificent building; for, if you do not,  you certainly will not see them.

Extract from \"The Nonsense Gazette,\" for August, 1870.    \"Our readers will be interested in the following communications from our  valued and learned contributor, Prof. Bosh, whose labors in the fields of  culinary and botanical science are so well known to all the world. The  first three articles richly merit to be added to the domestic cookery of  every family: those which follow claim the attention of all botanists; and  we are happy to be able, through Dr. Bosh's kindness, to present our  readers with illustrations of his discoveries. All the new flowers are  found in the Valley of Verrikwier, near the Lake of Oddgrow, and on the  summit of the Hill Orfeltugg.\"        THREE RECEIPTS FOR DOMESTIC COOKERY.      TO MAKE AN AMBLONGUS PIE.    Take 4 pounds (say 4-1/2 pounds) of fresh Amblongusses, and put them in a  small pipkin.    Cover them with water, and boil them for 8 hours incessantly; after which  add 2 pints of new milk, and proceed to boil for 4 hours more.    When you have ascertained that the Amblongusses are quite soft, take them  out, and place them in a wide pan, taking care to shake them well  previously.    Grate some nutmeg over the surface, and cover them carefully with powdered  gingerbread, curry-powder, and a sufficient quantity of Cayenne pepper.    Remove the pan into the next room, and place it on the floor. Bring it back  again, and let it simmer for three-quarters of an hour. Shake the pan  violently till all the Amblongusses have become of a pale purple color.    Then, having prepared the paste, insert the whole carefully; adding at the  same time a small pigeon, 2 slices of beef, 4 cauliflowers, and any number  of oysters.    Watch patiently till the crust begins to rise, and add a pinch of salt from  time to time.    Serve up in a clean dish, and throw the whole out of window as fast as  possible.      TO MAKE CRUMBOBBLIOUS CUTLETS.    Procure some strips of beef, and, having cut them into the smallest  possible slices, proceed to cut them still smaller,--eight, or perhaps  nine times.    When the whole is thus minced, brush it up hastily with a new  clothes-brush, and stir round rapidly and capriciously with a salt-spoon  or a soup-ladle.    Place the whole in a saucepan, and remove it to a sunny place,--say the  roof of the house, if free from sparrows or other birds,--and leave it  there for about a week.    At the end of that time add a little lavender, some oil of almonds, and a  few herring-bones; and then cover the whole with 4 gallons of clarified  Crumbobblious sauce, when it will be ready for use.    Cut it into the shape of ordinary cutlets, and serve up in a clean  table-cloth or dinner-napkin.      TO MAKE GOSKY PATTIES.    Take a pig three or four years of age, and tie him by the off hind-leg to a  post. Place 5 pounds of currants, 3 of sugar, 2 pecks of peas, 18 roast  chestnuts, a candle, and 6 bushels of turnips, within his reach: if he eats  these, constantly provide him with more.    Then procure some cream, some slices of Cheshire cheese, 4 quires of  foolscap paper, and a packet of black pins. Work the whole into a paste,  and spread it out to dry on a sheet of clean brown waterproof linen.    When the paste is perfectly dry, but not before, proceed to beat the pig  violently with the handle of a large broom. If he squeals, beat him again.    Visit the paste and beat the pig alternately for some days, and ascertain  if, at the end of that period, the whole is about to turn into Gosky  Patties.    If it does not then, it never will; and in that case the pig may be let  loose, and the whole process may be considered as finished.           *        *        *        *        *          NONSENSE BOTANY.

You must not dispute with these visions of the greatness of the soul, but  must treat them hospitably, for they are your very own, coming to you  from the regions of your Spiritual Mind which are unfolding into  consciousness.    (7) The highest step in this dawning consciousness of the Oneness of All,  is the one in which is realized that there is but One Reality, and at the  same time the sense of consciousness that the \"I\" is in that Reality. It  is most difficult to express this thought in words for it is something  that must be felt, rather than seen by the Intellect. When the Soul  realizes that the Spirit within it is, at the last, the only _real_ part  of it, and that the Absolute and its manifestation as Spirit is the only  _real_ thing in the Universe, a great step has been taken. But there is  still one higher step to be taken before the full sense of the Oneness  and Reality comes to us. That step is the one in which we realize the  Identity of the \"I\" with the great \"I\" of the Universe. The mystery of  the manifestation of the Absolute in the form of the Spirit, is veiled  from us--the mind confesses its inability to penetrate behind the veil  shielding the Absolute from view, although it will give us a report of  its being conscious of the presence of the Absolute just at the edge of  the boundary line. But the highest region of the Spiritual Mind, when  explored by the advanced souls who are well along the Path, reports that  it sees beyond the apparent separation of Spirit from Spirit, and  realizes that there is but one Reality of Spirit, and that all the \"I\"'s  are really but different views of that One--Centres of Consciousness upon  the surface of the One Great \"I,\" the Centre of which is the Absolute  Itself. This certainly penetrates the whole region of the Spiritual Mind,  and gives us all the message of Oneness of the Spirit, just as the  Intellect satisfies us with its message of the Oneness of Matter, Energy,  and Mind. The idea of Oneness permeates all planes of Life.    The sense of Reality of the \"I\" that is apparent to You in the moments of  your clearest mental vision, is really the reflection of the sense of  Reality underlying the Whole--it is the consciousness of the Whole,  manifesting through your point or Centre of Consciousness. The advanced  student or Initiate finds his consciousness gradually enlarging until it  realizes its identity with the Whole. He realizes that under all the  forms and names of the visible world, there is to be found One Life--One  Force--One Substance--One Existence--One Reality--ONE. And, instead of  his experiencing any sense of the loss of identity or individuality, he  becomes conscious of an enlargement of an expansion of individuality or  identity--instead of feeling himself absorbed in the Whole, he feels that  he is spreading out and embracing the Whole. This is most hard to express  in words, for there are no words to fit the conception, and all that we  can hope to do is to start into motion, by means of our words, the  vibrations that will find a response in the minds of those who read the  words, to the end that they will experience the consciousness which will  bring its own understanding. This consciousness cannot be transmitted by  words proceeding from the Intellect, but vibrations may be set up that  will prepare the mind to receive the message from its own higher planes.    Even in the early stages of this dawning consciousness, one is enabled to  identify the _real_ part of himself with the _real_ part of all the other  forms of life that pass before his notice. In every other man--in every  animal--in every plant--in every mineral--he sees behind the sheath and  form of appearance, an evidence of the presence of the Spirit which is  akin to his own Spirit--yea, more than akin, for the two are One. He sees  Himself in all forms of life, in all time in all places. He realizes that  the Real Self is everywhere present and everlasting, and that the Life  within himself is also within all the Universe--in everything, for there  is nothing dead in the Universe, and all Life, in all of its varying  phases, is simply the One Life, held, used and enjoyed in common by all.  Each Ego is a Centre of Consciousness in this great ocean of Life, and  while apparently separate and distinct, is yet really in touch with the  Whole, and with every apparent part.    It is not our intention, in this lesson, to go into the details of this  great mystery of Life, or to recite the comparatively little of the Truth  that the most advanced teachers and Masters have handed down. This is not  the place for it--it belongs to the subject of Gnani Yoga rather than to  Raja Yoga--and we touch upon it here, not for the purpose of trying to  explain the scientific side of it to you, but merely in order that your  minds may be led to take up the idea and gradually manifest it in  conscious realization. There is quite a difference between the  scientific, intellectual teaching of Gnani Yoga, whereby the metaphysical  and scientific sides of the Yogi teachings are presented to the minds of  the students, in a logical, scientific manner, and the methods of Raja  Yoga, in which the Candidate is led by degrees to a _consciousness_  (outside of mere intellectual belief) of his real nature and powers. We  are following the latter plan, for this course is a Course in _Raja_  Yoga. We are aiming to present the matter to the mind in such a manner  that it may prepare the way for the dawning consciousness, by brushing  away the preconceived notions and prejudices, and allowing a clean  entrance for the new conception. Much that we have said in this lesson  may appear, on the one hand, like useless repetition, and, on the other  hand, like an incomplete presentation of the scientific side of the Yogi  teachings. But it will be found, in time, that the effect has been that  the mind of the student has undergone a change from the absorbing of the  idea of the Oneness of Life, and the Expansion of the Self. The Candidate  is urged not to be in too much of a hurry. Development must not be  forced. Read what we have written, and practice the Mental Drills we have  given, even if they may appear trifling and childish to some of you--we  know what they will do for you, and you will agree with us in time. Make  haste slowly. You will find that the mind will work out the matter, even  though you be engaged in your ordinary work, and have forgotten the  subject for the time. The greater portion of mental work is done in this  way, while you are busy with something else, or even asleep, for the  sub-conscious portion of the mind works along the lines pointed out for  it, and performs its task.    As we have said, the purpose of this lesson is to bring you in the way of  the unfoldment of consciousness, rather than to teach you the details of  the scientific side of the Yogi teachings. Development is the keynote of  Raja Yoga. And the reason that we wish to develop this sense of the  Reality of the \"I,\" and the Expansion of the Self, at this place is that  thereby you may assert your Mastery over Matter, Energy and Mind. Before  you may mount your throne as King, you must fully realize in  consciousness that you _are_ the _Reality_ in this world of appearances.  You must realize that you--the _real_ You--are not only existent, and  real, but that you are in touch with all else that is real, and that the  roots of your being are grounded in the Absolute itself. You must realize  that instead of being a separate atom of Reality, isolated and fixed in a  narrow space, you are a Centre of Consciousness in the Whole of Reality,  and that the Universe of Universes is your home--that your Centre of  Consciousness might be moved on to a point trillions of miles from the  Earth (which distance would be as nothing in Space) and still you--the  awakened soul--would be just as much at home there as here--that even  while you are here, your influence extends far out into space. Your real  state, which will be revealed to you, gradually, throughout the ages, is  so great and grand, that your mind in its present state of development  cannot grasp even the faint reflection of that glory.    We wish you to try to form at least a faint idea of your Real State of  Being, in order that you may control the lower principles by the force of  your awakened Will, which Will depends upon your degree of consciousness  of the Real Self.    As man grows in understanding and consciousness of the Real Self, so does  his ability to use his Will grow. Will is the attribute of the Real Self.  It is well that this great realization of the Real Self brings with it  Love for all of Life, and Kindness, for, were it not so, the Will that  comes to him who grows into a realization of his real being could be used  to the great hurt of those of the race who had not progressed so far  (their _relative_ hurt, we mean, for in the end, and at the last, no soul  is ever really _hurt_). But the dawning power brings with it greater Love  and Kindness, and the higher the soul mounts the more is it filled with  the higher ideals and the more does it throw from it the lower animal  attributes. It is true that some souls growing into a consciousness of  their real nature, without an understanding of what it all means, may  commit the error of using the awakened Will for selfish ends, as may be  seen in the cases of the Black Magicians spoken of in the occult  writings, and also in the cases of well known characters in history and  in modern life, who manifest an enormous Will which they misuse. All of  this class of people of great Will have stumbled or grown blindly into a  consciousness (or partial consciousness) of the real nature, but lack the"]]]
