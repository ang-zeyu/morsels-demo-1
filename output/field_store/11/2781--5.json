Leaving the palace he made his way to the armourer's, whither he  had sent Osgod as soon as they arrived. The smith doffed his cap  as he entered. \"I am right glad to see you back again, young master.  My son gave me a rare surprise, for truly when he walked in I did  not know him again, not having had him in my thoughts or having  heard of his arrival. The varlet saw that I did not know him, and  said, 'Canst mend me a broken dagger, master armourer?'    \"'That can I,' I answered, and would have said more, when a laugh  came from his great mouth that well-nigh shook the house, and I  knew that it was my son, though the note was deeper than his used  to be, and was, as I told him, more like the bellow of a bull than  the laugh of a young fellow of eighteen. His mother looked in from  behind the shop and said, 'Surely that must have been Osgod's laugh.'  'It was,' I said, 'and there he stands before you. The impudent  rascal has topped me by over half a head, though I am a fair height  myself.' Then she carried him away, and I saw no more of him until  I had finished my work. Since supper he has been telling me somewhat  of what he has been doing down with you, which, as far as I can  learn, amounts to nothing, save the exercising of his arms and the  devouring of victuals.\"    \"He did all there was to do, Ulred, except that he could not bring  that long body and those loose arms of his to offer me cup or platter  without risk to my garments, and even Egbert was forced to agree  that he should never be able to make a courtly servant of him; but  save in that matter Osgod has got on right well. He has always been  ready when I wanted him, and prepared at once to start with me  either on foot or horseback whenever I wished to go out. He is  growing into a mighty man-at-arms, and well-nigh broke the skull  as well as the casque of the captain and teacher of my house carls.  Another two years, if he goes on as he has done and we go into  battle again, no thane in the land will have a stouter body-guard.\"    \"Are you going to stay in London, Master Wulf?\"    \"Yes; that is, while the earl is here. When he is away hunting or  attending to the affairs of the state I suppose I shall go with  him. Osgod of course will go with me. While here I shall have but  little use for his services, and he can be at home most part of the  day.\"    \"Then I trust you will soon be off,\" the smith said bluntly, \"for  to have a youth six feet and a hand in height hanging about doing  nothing would set all the men thinking it well that they too should  be idle. Osgod was always ready enough for a talk, though I do not  say he could not work when it was necessary, but now that he is in  your worship's service and under no orders of mine, his tongue will  never cease wagging.\"    \"Oh, I am ready to work a bit, father. I know how long it took me  to hammer out a bar before, and I shall be curious to find out in  what time I can do it now.\"    \"I doubt you will spoil more than you make, Osgod. Still, I too  shall be curious to see how many strokes you can give with the big  hammer, and how quickly you can beat a bar into a blade.\"    The stay in town was, however, of short duration, for four days  later the earl told him that he was going down to his house at  Bosham, and that he was to accompany him.    \"'Tis three months since I was away from London,\" he said. \"The  king is going down into Hereford to hunt, and I am therefore free  for a while, as there are no matters of state that press at present,  though I fear that ere very long the Welsh will be up again. I hear  that their King Griffith, not content with the beating he had a  short time since, is again preparing for war. Still it may be some  time before the storm bursts, and I am longing to be down again  among the green woods or afloat on the water.\"    Harold took with him a large party of personal friends, his brother  Wulfnoth, and his nephew Hakon. Among the party was Beorn, a young  thane, who also was a ward of the earl. He was two years older  than Wulf, but there had been a close friendship between them at  Edward's court. Shortly after Wulf's departure Beorn had also been  sent by the earl to his estates in Hampshire, and had been recalled  at the same time.    Beorn was far less strong and active than Wulf, having been very  weakly during the early years of his life, nor had he had the same  advantages of education, as he only became Harold's ward a year  after Wulf was installed as a page at Westminster. He was a youth  of good and generous disposition, and looked with feelings of  admiration upon the strength and skill in arms of the younger lad,  and especially at his power of reading.    \"I can never be like you there, Wulf,\" he would say, \"but I hope I  may some day grow as strong as you and as skilful in arms.\"    Beorn's stay in the country had done much for him, his thin tall  frame had filled out and there was a healthy colour on his cheek.  He had practised diligently at military exercises, and although he  found when, on the first day after Wulf's arrival in London, he  challenged him to a trial in arms, he was still very greatly his  inferior in skill and strength, he bade fair to become a gallant  fighter.    \"It is a disappointment to me, Wulf,\" he said as he picked up the  battle-axe that had been struck from his hand and sent flying across  the hall by a sweeping blow of Wulf's weapon. \"I have really worked  very hard, and I did think that I ought to have caught you up,  seeing that I am two years the elder. But you have gained more than  I have. I did as well as the other youths who were taught with me  by the house-carl Harold sent down with me, but I am sure I shall  never be as quick or hit as strongly as you do.\"    \"Oh yes, you will, Beorn. Age is nothing. You see you were sick and  ailing till you were fifteen years old, so those years counted for  nothing, and instead of being two years older than I am you are  many years younger. In another four or five years you will come to  your full strength, and will be able to strike a far heavier blow  than I can now; although I do not say heavier than I may be able  to do then, as you are neither so wide nor so deep chested as I am.  But what does it matter, one only fights sometimes. You have other  advantages, you are gentler in speech and manner and have a handsome  face. When we were pages together the bower-maidens of the queen  always made much of you, while they called me impudent, and would  give me many a slap on the cheek.\"    \"Well, you deserved it richly, Wulf, for you were always playing  tricks upon them--hiding their distaffs or tangling their thread,  and giving them pert answers when they wanted you to do their  errands. Well, I hope we shall be always great friends, Wulf. Your  estates lie not far from mine, and though we can scarce be called  neighbours we shall be within a day's ride of each other, and I  trust that we shall fight together under the good earl, and often  spend our time at each other's houses, and hunt and feast together.\"    \"I hope we shall be much together, Beorn,\" Wulf said warmly, \"and  that we shall be sworn friends; but as for feasting, I care but  little for it. We Saxon thanes are too fond both of food and wine-cup,  and though I am no monk I would that our customs could be altered.  I hate foreigners, but their ways are in many respects better than  ours. The Normans, it is true, may not be much better than we are,  but then they are but Northmen a little civilized; but I have heard  the earl say that the French, and still more the Italians, are  vastly ahead of us in all arts, and bear themselves with a courtesy  and gentleness to each other that puts to shame our rough manners.\"    \"We should be neither happier nor better that I can see, Wulf, did  we adopt the manners of these Italians you speak of instead of our  own.\"    \"Perhaps not, Beorn, but we should be able to make the people happier  and better if we could raise them.\"    \"I will not even grant that, Wulf. Think you that the smith and the  shepherd, the bowmaker and the weaver, would be any the happier  could they read or even write than they are as they sing Saxon songs  over their work? I should like to be able to read, because Harold  thinks much of it, but except for that I see not that it would do  me much good. If the king makes me any further grant of land it  will be doubtless properly made out, and I can get a clerk or a  monk to read it to me. My steward will keep the tallies of the  tenants' payments. I can learn the history of our forefathers as  well from the songs and tales of the gleemen as from books.\"    \"You are as bad as my man Osgod,\" Wulf said indignantly.    \"Well, you need not get hot about it, good Wulf,\" Beorn laughed.  \"When you come to see me I will have gleemen to sing the deeds of  our fathers to you. When I come to you I will sit as mum as a mouse  while you read to me from some monk's missal. I will force you  neither to eat nor to drink more than it pleases you, and you shall  give me as much to eat and drink as it pleases me, then we shall  be both well satisfied. As for your man Osgod, I wish I had such  a fellow. He will be well-nigh a giant one of these days, and in  strength may come to rival the earl, who is said to be the strongest  man on English soil.\"    \"He is a good fellow, Beorn, and I could wish for no better to hold  a shield over me in the day of battle or to stand back to back with  me in a hand-to-hand fight.\"    \"You should get him to stand in front of you,\" Beorn laughed. \"He  would be a rare screen against arrows and javelins.\"    The friends were well"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8770"],[0,"Milton (#10)"],[1,"class. Man was the final cause of God's creation, and  woman was there to minister to this nobler being. In his dogmatic  treatise, _De doctrina Christiana_, Milton formulated this sentiment  in the thesis, borrowed from the schoolmen, that the soul was  communicated \"in semine patris.\" The cavalier section of society had  inherited the sentiment of chivalry, and contrasted with the roundhead  not more by its loyalty to the person of the prince, than by its  recognition of the superior grace and refinement of womanhood. Even in  the debased and degenerate epoch of court life which followed 1660,  the forms and language of homage still preserved the tradition of a  nobler scheme of manners. The Puritan had thrown off chivalry as being  parcel of Catholicism, and had replaced it by the Hebrew ideal of the  subjection and seclusion of woman. Milton, in whose mind the rigidity  of Puritan doctrine was now contending with the freer spirit of  culture and romance, shows on the present occasion a like conflict of  doctrine with sentiment. While he adopts the oriental hypothesis of  woman for the sake of man, he modifies it by laying more stress upon  mutual affection, the charities of home, and the intercommunion of  intellectual and moral life, than upon that ministration of woman to  the appetite and comforts of man, which makes up the whole of her  functions in the Puritan apprehension. The failure in his own case to  obtain this genial companionship of soul, which he calls \"the gentlest  end of marriage,\" is what gave the keenest edge to his disappointment  in his matrimonial venture.    But however keenly he felt and regretted the precipitancy which had  yoked him for life to \"a mute and spiritless mate,\" the breach did not  come from his side. The girl herself conceived an equal repugnance to  the husband she had thoughtlessly accepted, probably on the strength  of his good looks, which was all of Milton that she was capable of  appreciating. A young bride, taken suddenly from the freedom of a  jovial and an undisciplined home, rendered more lax by civil confusion  and easy intercourse with the officers of the royalist garrison,  and committed to the sole society of a stranger, and that stranger  possessing the rights of a husband, and expecting much from all who  lived with him, may not unnaturally have been seized with panic  terror, and wished herself home again. The young Mrs. Milton not only  wished it, but incited her family to write and beg that she might be  allowed to go home to stay the remainder of the summer. The request to  quit her husband at the end of the first month was so unreasonable,  that the parents would hardly have made it if they had not suspected  some profound cause of estrangement. Nor could Milton have consented,  as he did, to so extreme a remedy unless he had felt that the case  required no less, and that her mother's advice and influence were the  most available means of awakening his wife to a sense of her duty,  Milton's consent was therefore given. He may hare thought it desirable  she should go, and thus Mrs. Powell would not have been going very  much beyond the truth when she pretended some years afterwards that  her son-in-law had turned away his wife for a long space.    Mary Milton went to Forest Hill in July, but on the understanding that  she was to come back at Michaelmas. When the appointed time came, she  did not appear. Milton wrote for her to come. No answer. Several other  letters met the same fate. At last he despatched a foot messenger  to Forest Hill desiring her return. The messenger came back only to  report that he had been \"dismissed with some sort of contempt.\" It was  evident that Mary Milton's family had espoused her cause as against  her husband. Whatever may have been the secret motive of their  conduct, they explained the quarrel politically, and began to repent,  so Phillips thought, of having matched the eldest daughter of their  house with a violent Presbyterian.    If Milton had \"hasted too eagerly to light the nuptial torch,\" he had  been equally ardent in his calculations of the domestic happiness upon  which he was to enter. His poet's imagination had invested a dull  and common girl with rare attributes moral and intellectual, and had  pictured for him the state of matrimony as an earthly paradise, in  which he was to be secure of a response of affection showing itself in  a communion of intelligent interests. In proportion to the brilliancy  of his ideal anticipation was the fury of despair which came upon him  when he found out his mistake. A common man, in a common age, would  have vented his vexation upon the individual. Milton, living at a time  when controversy turned away from details, and sought to dig down to  the roots of every question, instead of urging the hardships of his  own case, set to to consider the institution of marriage in itself. He  published a pamphlet with the title, _The Doctrine and Discipline  of Divorce_, at first anonymously, but putting his name to a second  edition, much enlarged. He further reinforced this argument in chief  with three supplementary pamphlets, partly in answer to opponents and  objectors; for there was no lack of opposition, indeed of outcry loud  and fierce.    A biographer closely scans the pages of these pamphlets, not for the  sake of their direct argument, but to see if he can extract from them  any indirect hints of their author's personal relations. There is  found in them no mention of Milton's individual case. Had we no other  information, we should not be authorised to infer from them that the  question of the marriage tie was more than an abstract question with  the author.    But though all mention of his own case is studiously avoided by  Milton, his pamphlet, when read by the light of Phillips's brief  narrative, does seem to give some assistance in apprehending the  circumstances of this obscure passage of the poet's life. The mystery  has always been felt by the biographers, but has assumed a darker hue  since the discovery by Mr. Masson of a copy of the first edition of  _The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce_, with the written date  of August 1. According to Phillips's narrative, the pamphlet was  engendered by Milton's indignation at his wife's contemptuous  treatment of him, in refusing to keep the engagement to return at  Michaelmas, and would therefore be composed in October and November,  time enough to allow for the sale of the edition, and the preparation  of the enlarged edition, which came out in February, 1644. But if the  date \"August 1\" for the first edition be correct, we have to suppose  that Milton was occupying himself with the composition of a vehement  and impassioned argument in favour of divorce for incompatibility of  temper, during the honeymoon! Such behaviour on Milton's part, he  being thirty-five, towards a girl of seventeen, to whom he was bound,  to show all loving tenderness, is so horrible, that a suggestion has  been made that there was a more adequate cause for his displeasure, a  suggestion, which Milton's biographer is bound to notice, even if he  does not adopt it. The suggestion, which I believe was first made by a  writer in the _Athenaeum_, is that Milton's young wife refused him  the consummation of the marriage. The supposition is founded upon a  certain passage in Milton's pamphlet.    If the early date of the pamphlet be the true date; if the _Doctrine  and Discipline_ was in the hands of the public on August 1 if Milton  was brooding over this seething agony of passion all through July,  with the young bride, to whom he had been barely wedded a month, in  the house where he was writing, then the only apology for this outrage  upon the charities, not to say decencies, of home is that which is  suggested by the passage referred to. Then the pamphlet, however  imprudent, becomes pardonable. It is a passionate cry from the depths  of a great despair; another evidence of the noble purity of a nature  which refused to console itself as other men would have consoled  themselves; a nature which, instead of an egotistical whine for its  own deliverance, sets itself to plead the common cause of man and of  society. He gives no intimation of any individual interest, but his  argument throughout glows with a white heat of concealed emotion, such  as could only he stirred by the sting of some personal and present  misery.    Notwithstanding the amount of free opinion abroad in England, or at  least in London, at this date, Milton's divorce pamphlets created a  sensation of that sort which Gibbon is fond of calling a scandal.  A scandal, in this sense, must always arise in your own party; you  cannot scandalise the enemy. And so it was now. The Episcopalians  were rejoiced that Milton should ruin his credit with his own side by  advocating a paradox. The Presbyterians hastened to disown a man who  enabled their opponents to brand their religious scheme as the parent  of moral heresies. For though church government and the English  constitution in all its parts had begun to be open questions,  speculation had not as yet attacked either of the two bases of  society, property or the family. Loud was the outcry of the  Philistines. There was no doubt that the rigid bonds of Presbyterian  orthodoxy would not in any case have long held Milton. They were  snapped at once by the publication of his opinions on divorce, and  Milton is henceforward to be ranked among the most independent of the  new party which shortly after this date began to be heard of under the  name of Independents.    But the men who formed the nucleus of this new mode of thinking were  as yet, in 1643, not consolidated into a sect, still less was their  importance as the coming political party dreamt of. At present they  were units, only drawn to each other by the sympathy of opinion. The  contemptuous epithets, Anabaptist, Antinomian, &c., could be levelled  against"]]]
