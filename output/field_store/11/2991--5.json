CHAPTER I.    _The Description of Church Government._      The nature of that church government which is of divine right according  to Scripture, comes next to be considered; (having so fully seen what  the nature of a divine right is, and how many several ways matters in  religion may be said to be of divine right.) For the fuller and clearer  unfolding whereof, let us first see how church government may be  described; and then how that description may be explained and justified  by the word of God, in the branches of it.    Church government may be thus described:    Church government is a power[13] or authority spiritual,[14] revealed in  the holy Scriptures,[15] derived from Jesus Christ[16] our Mediator,[17]  only to his own officers, and by them exercised in dispensing of the  word,[18] seals,[19] censures,[20] and all other ordinances of  Christ,[21] for the edifying of the Church of Christ.[22]    This description of church government may be thus explained and proved.  Three things are principally considerable herein, viz: 1. The thing  defined, or described, viz. church government. 2. The general nature of  this government which it hath in common with all other governments, viz.  power or authority.    3. The special difference whereby it is distinguished from all other  governments whatsoever. Herein six things are observable. 1. The special  rule, wherein it is revealed, and whereby it is to be measured, viz. the  holy Scriptures. 2. The proper author, or fountain, whence this power is  derived, viz. from Jesus Christ our Mediator, peculiarly. 3. The special  kind of this power or authority, viz. it is a spiritual power, it is a  derived power. 4. The several parts or acts wherein this power sets  forth itself, viz. in dispensing the word, seals, censures, and all  other ordinances of Christ. 5. The special end or scope of this power,  viz. the edifying of the Church of Christ. 6. The proper and distinct  subject or receptacle wherein Christ hath placed and intrusted all this  power, viz. only his own officers. All these things are comprehended in  this description, and unto these several heads the whole nature of  church government may be reduced. So that, these being explained and  confirmed by the Scriptures, it will easily and fully be discovered,  what that church government is which is of divine right, and by the will  and appointment of Jesus Christ, our Mediator.          CHAPTER II.    _Of the Subject Described, viz. Church Government, the terms being  briefly opened._      Touching the thing defined or described, it is church government. Here  two terms are to be a little explained: 1. What is meant by church? 2.  What is meant by government?    1. Church is originally derived from a Greek word,[23] which signifies  to call forth. Hence church properly signifies a company or multitude,  called forth; and so in this notation of the word, three things are  implied: 1. The term from which they are called. 2. The term to which  they are called. 3. The medium or mean by which they are brought from  one term to another, viz. by calling. And these things thus generally  laid down, do agree to every company that may properly be called a  church. Now, this word translated church, never signifies one particular  person, but many congregated, gathered, or called together; and it hath  several acceptations or uses in the New Testament: 1. It is used in a  common and civil sense, for any civil meeting, or concourse of people  together: thus that tumultuous and riotous assembly is called a church,  Acts xix. 32, 39, 40. 2. It is used in a special religious sense, for a  sacred meeting or assembly of God's people together: and thus it  signifies the Church of God, either, 1. Invisible, comprehending only  the elect of God, as Heb. xii. 23, \"and Church of the first-born,\" Eph.  v. 23, &c., \"Even as Christ is the head of the Church.\" 2. Or, visible,  comprehending the company of those that are called to the visible  profession of the faith in Christ, and obedience unto Christ, according  to the gospel, as Acts ii. 47, and v. 11, and viii. 3, and xii. 1, 5; 1  Cor. xii. 23, and often elsewhere. Now in this description, church is  not understood of a civil assembly; for such assemblies are governed by  civil power. Nor of the invisible Church of Christ; for, as the Church  is invisible, (to speak properly,) it is invisibly governed by Christ  and his Spirit, Rom. viii. 14; Gal. ii. 20. But of the visible Church of  Christ, for which Christ hath provided a visible polity, a visible  government, by visible officers and ordinances, for the good both of the  visible and invisible members thereof, which is that church government  here spoken of.    2. Government is the translation of a Greek word, which properly  signifies the government of a ship with chart, &c., by the pilot or  mariner, and thence metaphorically is used to signify any government,  political or ecclesiastical. But the word is only once used in all the  New Testament, viz. 1 Cor. xii. 28: _Governments_, h.e. ruling elders in  the church; the abstract being put for the concrete, governments for  governors. But whatever be the terms or names whereby government is  expressed, government generally considered seems still to signify a  superiority of office, power, and authority, which one hath and  exerciseth over another. This is the notion of government in general. So  that church government, in general, notes that pre-eminence or  superiority of office, power, and authority, which some have and  exercise over others in spiritual matters, in church affairs. And here  we are further to consider, that church government is either, 1.  Magisterial, lordly, and supreme; and so it is primitively and  absolutely in God, Matt. xxviii. 18. Dispensatorily and mediatorily in  Jesus Christ our Mediator only, whom God hath made both Lord and Christ,  Acts ii. 36; Matt, xxiii. 8, 10; 1 Cor. viii. 6, and to whom God alone  hath dispensed all authority and power, Matt, xxviii. 18, 19; John v.  22. Now church government, as settled on Christ only, is monarchical. 2.  Ministerial, stewardly, and subordinate; and this power Jesus Christ our  Mediator hath committed to his church guides and officers in his Church,  2 Cor. x. 8, and xiii. 10; and church government, as intrusted in the  hands of church guides, is representative. This ministerial church  government, committed by Christ to his officers, may be considered  either, 1. As it was dispensed under the Old Testament, in a Mosaical,  Levitical polity; in which sense we here speak not of church government;  (that polity being dissolved and antiquated.) 2. Or, as it is to be  dispensed now under the New Testament, in an evangelical Christian  polity, by Christ's New Testament officers; and this is that church  government which is here described, viz. not the supreme magisterial  government of Christ, but the subordinate ministerial government of  Christ's officers; and this not as it was under the Old Testament, but  as it ought to be now under the New Testament.          CHAPTER III.    _Of the general Nature of Church Government, viz. Power or Authority._      Touching the general nature of this government, which it participates in  common with all other governments, it is power or authority. Here divers  particulars are to be cleared and proved, viz:    1. What is meant by power or authority? The word chiefly used in the New  Testament for power or authority is used not only to denote Christ's  supreme power, as Luke iv. 36; Mark i. 17, with Luke vi. 19; but also  his officers' derived power, as with 2 Cor. x. 8, and xiii. 10. It is  used to signify divers things: as, 1. Dignity, privilege, prerogative.  \"To them he gave prerogative to be the sons of God,\" John i. 12. 2.  Liberty, leave, license; as, 1 Cor. viii. 9, \"But so that your liberty  become not an offence to the weak;\" and 1 Cor. ix. 4, 5, \"Have not we  liberty to eat and drink? Have not we liberty to lead about a sister, a  wife?\" 3. But most usually right and authority; as, Matt. xxi. 23, 24,  27, and xxviii. 18; so 2 Cor. x. 8, and xiii. 10: in this last sense  especially it is here to be taken in this description of church  government.    Power or authority in general is by some[24] thus described: that  whereby one may claim or challenge any thing to one's self, without the  injury of any other. Power is exercised either about things, or actions,  or persons. 1. About things, as when a man disposes of his own goods,  which he may do without wrong to any. 2. About actions, as when a man  acts that which offends no law. 3. About persons, as when a man commands  his children or servants that are under his own power.--Proportionably,  the power of the Church in government is exercised, 1. About things, as  when it is to be determined by the word, what the Church may call her  own of right; as, that all the officers are hers, Eph; iv. 7, 8, 10, 11;  1 Cor. xii. 28: that all the promises are hers, 2 Pet. i. 4; 1 Tim. iv.  8: that Jesus Christ, and with Christ all things, are hers, 1 Cor. iii.  21, 22. The keys of the kingdom of heaven are hers, Matt. xvi. 19, and  xviii. 18, &c.; John xx. 21, 23, &c.: these things the Church may  challenge without wrong to any. 2. About actions. As when it is to be  determined by the word, what the Church of divine right may do, or not  do: as, the Church may not _bear with them that are evil_, Rev. ii. 2;  _nor tolerate women to teach_, or false doctrine to be broached, Rev.  ii. 20, &c. The Church may _warn the unruly_, 1 Thess. v. 14:  excommunicate the obstinate and incorrigible, Matt, xviii. 17, 18; 1  Cor. v. 4, 5, 13: receive again penitent persons to the communion of the  faithful, 2 Cor. ii. 7, 8: make binding decrees in synods, even to the  restraining of the outward exercise of due Christian liberty for a time,  for prevention of scandal, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13944"],[0,"After London; Or, Wild England (#11)"],[1,"parts of two turkey-traps were strewn  about, together with a small round shield or targe, such as are used by  swordsmen, snares of wire, and, in an open box, several chisels, gouges,  and other tools.    A blowtube was fastened to three pegs, so that it might not warp, a  hunter's horn hung from another, and on the floor were a number of  arrows in various stages of manufacture, some tied to the straightening  rod, some with the feathers already attached, and some hardly shaped  from the elder or aspen log. A heap of skins filled the third corner,  and beside them were numerous stag's horns, and two of the white cow,  but none yet of the much dreaded and much desired white bull. A few  peacock's feathers were there also, rare and difficult to get, and  intended for Aurora. Round one footpost of the bed was a long coil of  thin hide, a lasso, and on another was suspended an iron cap, or  visorless helmet.    There was no sword or lance. Indeed, of all these weapons and  implements, none seemed in use, to judge by the dust that had gathered  upon them, and the rusted edges, except the bow and crossbow and one of  the boar spears. The bed itself was very low, framed of wood, thick and  solid; the clothes were of the coarsest linen and wool; there were furs  for warmth in winter, but these were not required in May. There was no  carpet, nor any substitute for it; the walls were whitewashed, ceiling  there was none, the worm-eaten rafters were visible, and the roof tree.  But on the table was a large earthenware bowl, full of meadow orchids,  blue-bells, and a bunch of may in flower.    His hat, wide in the brim, lay on the floor; his doublet was on the  wooden block or seat, with the long tight-fitting trousers, which showed  every muscle of the limb, and by them high shoes of tanned but unblacked  leather. His short cloak hung on a wooden peg against the door, which  was fastened with a broad bolt of oak. The parchment in the recess of  the window at which he had been working just before retiring was covered  with rough sketches, evidently sections of a design for a ship or galley  propelled by oars.    The square spot of light upon the wall slowly moved as the sun rose  higher, till the ivory cross was left in shadow, but still the slumberer  slept on, heedless, too, of the twittering of the swallows under the  eaves, and the call of the cuckoo not far distant.          CHAPTER II    THE HOUSE OF AQUILA      Presently there came the sound of a creaking axle, which grew louder and  louder as the waggon drew nearer, till it approached a shriek. The  sleeper moved uneasily, but recognising the noise even in his dreams,  did not wake. The horrible sounds stopped; there was the sound of  voices, as if two persons, one without and one within the wall, were  hailing each other; a gate swung open, and the waggon came past under  the very window of the bedroom. Even habit could not enable Felix to  entirely withstand so piercing a noise when almost in his ears. He sat  up a minute, and glanced at the square of light on the wall to guess the  time by its position.    In another minute or two the squeaking of the axle ceased, as the waggon  reached the storehouses, and he immediately returned to the pillow.  Without, and just beneath the window, there ran a road or way, which in  part divided the enclosure into two portions; the dwelling-house and its  offices being on one side, the granaries and storehouses on the other.  But a few yards to the left of his room, a strong gate in the enclosing  wall gave entrance to this roadway. It was called the Maple Gate,  because a small maple tree grew near outside. The wall, which surrounded  the whole place at a distance of eight or ten yards from the buildings,  was of brick, and about nine feet high, with a ditch without.    It was partly embattled, and partly loopholed, and a banquette of earth  rammed hard ran all round inside, so that the defenders might discharge  darts or arrows through the embrasures, and step down out of sight to  prepare a fresh supply. At each corner there was a large platform, where  a considerable number of men could stand and command the approaches;  there were, however, no bastions or flanking towers. On the roof of the  dwelling-house a similar platform had been prepared, protected by a  parapet; from which height the entire enclosure could be overlooked.    Another platform, though at a less height, was on the roof of the  retainers' lodgings, so placed as especially to command the second gate.  Entering by the Maple Gate, the dwelling-house was on the right hand,  and the granaries and general storehouses on the left, the latter built  on three sides of a square. Farther on, on the same side, were the  stables, and near them the forge and workshops. Beyond these, again,  were the lodgings of the retainers and labourers, near which, in the  corner, was the South Gate, from which the South Road led to the  cattle-pens and farms, and out to the south.    Upon the right hand, after the dwelling-house, and connected with it,  came the steward's stores, where the iron tools and similar valuable  articles of metal were kept. Then, after a covered passage-way, the  kitchen and general hall, under one roof with the house. The house  fronted in the opposite direction to the roadway; there was a narrow  green lawn between it and the enceinte, or wall, and before the general  hall and kitchens a gravelled court. This was parted from the lawn by  palings, so that the house folk enjoyed privacy, and yet were close to  their servitors. The place was called the Old House, for it dated back  to the time of the ancients, and the Aquilas were proud of the simple  designation of their fortified residence.    Felix's window was almost exactly opposite the entrance to the  storehouse or granary yard, so that the waggon, after passing it, had to  go but a little distance, and then, turning to the left, was drawn up  before the doors of the warehouse. This waggon was low, built for the  carriage of goods only, of hewn plank scarcely smooth, and the wheels  were solid; cut, in fact, from the butt of an elm tree. Unless  continually greased the squeaking of such wheels is terrible, and the  carters frequently forgot their grease-horns.    Much of the work of the farm, such as the carting of hay and corn in  harvest-time, was done upon sleds; the waggons (there were but few of  them) being reserved for longer journeys on the rough roads. This  waggon, laden with wool, some of the season's clip, had come in four or  five miles from an out-lying cot, or sheep-pen, at the foot of the  hills. In the buildings round the granary yard there were stored not  only the corn and flour required for the retainers (who might at any  moment become a besieged garrison), but the most valuable products of  the estate, the wool, hides, and tanned leather from the tan-pits,  besides a great quantity of bacon and salt beef; indeed, every possible  article that could be needed.    These buildings were put together with wooden pins, on account of the  scarcity of iron, and were all (dwelling-houses included) roofed with  red tile. Lesser houses, cottages, and sheds at a distance were  thatched, but in an enclosure tiles were necessary, lest, in case of an  attack, fire should be thrown.    Half an hour later, at six o'clock, the watchman blew his horn as loudly  as possible for some two or three minutes, the hollow sound echoing  through the place. He took the time by the sundial on the wall, it being  a summer morning; in winter he was guided by the position of the stars,  and often, when sun or stars were obscured, went by guess. The house  horn was blown thrice a day; at six in the morning, as a signal that the  day had begun, at noon as a signal for dinner, at six in the afternoon  as a signal that the day (except in harvest-time) was over. The watchmen  went their round about the enclosure all night long, relieved every  three hours, armed with spears, and attended by mastiffs. By day one  sufficed, and his station was then usually (though not always) on the  highest part of the roof.    The horn re-awoke Felix; it was the note by which he had been accustomed  to rise for years. He threw open the oaken shutters, and the sunlight  and the fresh breeze of the May morning came freely into the room. There  was now the buzz of voices without, men unloading the wool, men at the  workshops and in the granaries, and others waiting at the door of the  steward's store for the tools, which he handed out to them. Iron being  so scarce, tools were a temptation, and were carefully locked up each  night, and given out again in the morning.    Felix went to the ivory cross and kissed it in affectionate recollection  of Aurora, and then looked towards the open window, in the pride and joy  of youth turning to the East, the morning, and the light. Before he had  half dressed there came a knock and then an impatient kick at the door.  He unbarred it, and his brother Oliver entered. Oliver had been for his  swim in the river. He excelled in swimming, as, indeed, in every manly  exercise, being as active and energetic as Felix was outwardly languid.    His room was only across the landing, his door just opposite. It also  was strewn with implements and weapons. But there was a far greater  number of tools; he was an expert and artistic workman, and his table  and his seat, unlike the rude blocks in Felix's room, were tastefully  carved. His seat, too, had a back, and he had even a couch of his own  construction. By his bedhead hung his sword, his most valued and most  valuable possession. It was one which had escaped the dispersion of the  ancients; it had been ancient even in their days, and of far better work  than they themselves produced.    Broad, long, straight, and well-balanced, it appeared capable of cutting  through helmet and mail, when wielded by Oliver's sturdy arm. Such a  sword could not"]]]
