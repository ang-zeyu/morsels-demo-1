His father was the Colonel of the 195th, and as soon as Wee Willie Winkie  was old enough to understand what Military Discipline meant, Colonel  Williams put him under it. There was no other way of managing the child.  When he was good for a week, he drew good-conduct pay; and when he was  bad, he was deprived of his good-conduct stripe. Generally he was bad, for  India offers so many chances to little six-year-olds of going wrong.    Children resent familiarity from strangers, and Wee Willie Winkie was a  very particular child. Once he accepted an acquaintance, he was graciously  pleased to thaw. He accepted Brandis, a subaltern of the 195th, on sight.  Brandis was having tea at the Colonel's, and Wee Willie Winkie entered  strong in the possession of a good-conduct badge won for not chasing the  hens round the compound. He regarded Brandis with gravity for at least ten  minutes, and then delivered himself of his opinion.    \"I like you,\" said he, slowly, getting off his chair and coming over to  Brandis. \"I like you. I shall call you Coppy, because of your hair. Do you  _mind_ being called Coppy? it is because of ve hair, you know.\"    Here was one of the most embarrassing of Wee Willie Winkie's  peculiarities. He would look at a stranger for some time, and then,  without warning or explanation, would give him a name. And the name stuck.  No regimental penalties could break Wee Willie Winkie of this habit. He  lost his good-conduct badge for christening the Commissioner's wife  \"Pobs\"; but nothing that the Colonel could do made the Station forego the  nickname, and Mrs. Collen remained Mrs. \"Pobs\" till the end of her stay.  So Brandis was christened \"Coppy,\" and rose, therefore, in the estimation  of the regiment.    If Wee Willie Winkie took an interest in any one, the fortunate man was  envied alike by the mess and the rank and file. And in their envy lay no  suspicion of self-interest. \"The Colonel's son\" was idolized on his own  merits entirely. Yet Wee Willie Winkie was not lovely. His face was  permanently freckled, as his legs were permanently scratched, and in spite  of his mother's almost tearful remonstrances he had insisted upon having  his long yellow locks cut short in the military fashion. \"I want my hair  like Sergeant Tummil's,\" said Wee Willie Winkie, and, his father abetting,  the sacrifice was accomplished.    Three weeks after the bestowal of his youthful affections on Lieutenant  Brandis--henceforward to be called \"Coppy\" for the sake of brevity--Wee  Willie Winkie was destined to behold strange things and far beyond his  comprehension.    Coppy returned his liking with interest. Coppy had let him wear for five  rapturous minutes his own big sword--just as tall as Wee Willie Winkie.  Coppy had promised him a terrier puppy; and Coppy had permitted him to  witness the miraculous operation of shaving. Nay, more--Coppy had said  that even he, Wee Willie Winkie, would rise in time to the ownership of a  box of shiny knives, a silver soap-box and a silver-handled  \"sputter-brush,\" as Wee Willie Winkie called it. Decidedly, there was no  one except his father, who could give or take away good-conduct badges at  pleasure, half so wise, strong, and valiant as Coppy with the Afghan and  Egyptian medals on his breast. Why, then, should Coppy be guilty of the  unmanly weakness of kissing--vehemently kissing--a \"big girl,\" Miss  Allardyce to wit? In the course of a morning ride, Wee Willie Winkie had  seen Coppy so doing, and, like the gentleman he was, had promptly wheeled  round and cantered back to his groom, lest the groom should also see.    Under ordinary circumstances he would have spoken to his father, but he  felt instinctively that this was a matter on which Coppy ought first to be  consulted.    \"Coppy,\" shouted Wee Willie Winkie, reining up outside that subaltern's  bungalow early one morning--\"I want to see you, Coppy!\"    \"Come in, young 'un,\" returned Coppy, who was at early breakfast in the  midst of his dogs. \"What mischief have you been getting into now?\"    Wee Willie Winkie had done nothing notoriously bad for three days, and so  stood on a pinnacle of virtue.    \"I've been doing nothing bad,\" said he, curling himself into a long chair  with a studious affectation of the Colonel's languor after a hot parade.  He buried his freckled nose in a tea-cup and, with eyes staring roundly  over the rim, asked:--\"I say, Coppy, is it pwoper to kiss big girls?\"    \"By Jove! You're beginning early. Who do you want to kiss?\"    \"No one. My muvver's always kissing me if I don't stop her. If it isn't  pwoper, how was you kissing Major Allardyce's big girl last morning, by ve  canal?\"    Coppy's brow wrinkled. He and Miss Allardyce had with great craft managed  to keep their engagement secret for a fortnight. There were urgent and  imperative reasons why Major Allardyce should not know how matters stood  for at least another month, and this small marplot had discovered a great  deal too much.    \"I saw you,\" said Wee Willie Winkie, calmly. \"But ve groom didn't see. I  said, '_Hut jao_.'\"    \"Oh, you had that much sense, you young Rip,\" groaned poor Coppy, half  amused and half angry. \"And how many people may you have told about it?\"    \"Only me myself. You didn't tell when I twied to wide ve buffalo ven my  pony was lame; and I fought you wouldn't like.\"    \"Winkie,\" said Coppy, enthusiastically, shaking the small hand, \"you're  the best of good fellows. Look here, you can't understand all these  things. One of these days--hang it, how can I make you see it!--I'm going  to marry Miss Allardyce, and then she'll be Mrs. Coppy, as you say. If  your young mind is so scandalized at the idea of kissing big girls, go and  tell your father.\"    \"What will happen?\" said Wee Willie Winkie, who firmly believed that his  father was omnipotent.    \"I shall get into trouble.\" said Coppy, playing his trump card with an  appealing look at the holder of the ace.    \"Ven I won't,\" said Wee Willie Winkie, briefly. \"But my faver says it's  un-man-ly to be always kissing, and I didn't fink _you'd_ do vat, Coppy.\"    \"I'm not always kissing, old chap. It's only now and then, and when you're  bigger you'll do it too. Your father meant it's not good for little boys.\"    \"Ah!\" said Wee Willie Winkie, now fully enlightened. \"It's like ve  sputter-brush?\"    \"Exactly,\" said Coppy, gravely.    \"But I don't fink I'll ever want to kiss big girls, nor no one, 'cept my  muvver. And I _must_ vat, you know.\"    There was a long pause, broken by Wee Willie Winkie,    \"Are you fond of vis big girl, Coppy?\"    \"Awfully!\" said Coppy.    \"Fonder van you are of Bell or ve Butcha--or me?\"    \"It's in a different way,\" said Coppy. \"You see, one of these days Miss  Allardyce will belong to me, but you'll grow up and command the Regiment  and--all sorts of things. It's quite different, you see.\"    \"Very well,\" said Wee Willie Winkie, rising. \"If you're fond of ve big  girl, I won't tell any one. I must go now.\"    Coppy rose and escorted his small guest to the door, adding: \"You're the  best of little fellows, Winkie. I tell you what. In thirty days from now  you can tell if you like--tell any one you like.\"    Thus the secret of the Brandis-Allardyce engagement was dependent on a  little child's word. Coppy, who knew Wee Willie Winkie's idea of truth,  was at ease, for he felt that he would not break promises. Wee Willie  Winkie betrayed a special and unusual interest in Miss Allardyce, and,  slowly revolving round that embarrassed young lady, was used to regard her  gravely with unwinking eye. He was trying to discover why Coppy should  have kissed her. She was not half so nice as his own mother. On the other  hand, she was Coppy's property, and would in time belong to him. Therefore  it behooved him to treat her with as much respect as Coppy's big sword or  shiny pistol.    The idea that he shared a great secret in common with Coppy kept Wee  Willie Winkie unusually virtuous for three weeks. Then the Old Adam broke  out, and he made what he called a \"camp-fire\" at the bottom of the garden.  How could he have foreseen that the flying sparks would have lighted the  Colonel's little hayrick and consumed a week's store for the horses?  Sudden and swift was the punishment--deprivation of the good-conduct badge  and, most sorrowful of all, two days confinement to barracks--the house  and veranda--coupled with the withdrawal of the light of his father's  countenance.    He took the sentence like the man he strove to be, drew himself up with a  quivering under-lip, saluted, and, once clear of the room, ran to weep  bitterly in his nursery--called by him \"my quarters,\" Coppy came in the  afternoon and attempted to console the culprit.    \"I'm under awwest,\" said Wee Willie Winkie, mournfully, \"and I didn't  ought to speak to you.\"    Very early the next morning he climbed on to the roof of the house--that  was not forbidden--and beheld Miss Allardyce going for a ride.    \"Where are you going?\" cried Wee Willie Winkie.    \"Across the river,\" she answered, and trotted forward.    Now the cantonment in which the 195th lay was bounded on the north by a  river--dry in the winter. From his earliest years, Wee Willie Winkie had  been forbidden to go across the river, and had noted that even Coppy--the  almost almighty Coppy--had never set foot beyond it. Wee Willie Winkie had  once been read to, out of a big blue book, the history of the Princess and  the Goblins--a most wonderful tale of a land where the Goblins were always  warring with the children of men until they were defeated by one Curdie.  Ever since that date it seemed to him that the bare black and purple hills  across the river were inhabited by Goblins, and, in truth, every one had  said that there lived the Bad Men. Even in his own house the lower halves  of the windows were covered with green paper on account of the Bad Men who  might, if allowed clear view, fire into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8659"],[0,"Sabbath in Puritan New England (#10)"],[1,"deacon left the meeting-house to finish their little affair;  and unmistakable swishing sounds, accompanied by loud wails and whining  protestations, were soon heard from the region of the horse-sheds. Parents  never resented such chastisings; it was expected, and even desired,  that boys should be whipped freely by every school-master and person of  authority who chose so to do.    In some old church-orders for seating, boys were classed with negroes,  and seated with them; but in nearly all towns the negroes had seats by  themselves. The black women were all seated on a long bench or in an  inclosed pew labelled \"B.W.,\" and the negro men in one labelled \"B.M.\" One  William Mills, a jesting soul, being asked by a pompous stranger where he  could sit in meeting, told the visitor that he was welcome to sit in Bill  Mills's pew, and that it was marked \"B.M.\" The man, who chanced to be  ignorant of the local custom of marking the negro seats, accepted the kind  invitation, and seated himself in the black men's pew, to the delight of  Bill Mills, the amusement of the boys, the scandal of the elders, and his  own disgust.    Sometimes a little pew or short gallery was built high up among the beams  and joists over the staircase which led to the first gallery, and was  called the \"swallows' nest,\" or the \"roof pue,\" or the \"second gallery.\" It  was reached by a steep, ladder-like staircase, and was often assigned to  the negroes and Indians of the congregation.    Often \"ye seat between ye Deacons seat and ye pulpit is for persons hard of  hearing to sett in.\" In nearly every meeting a bench or pew full of aged  men might be seen near the pulpit, and this seat was called, with Puritan  plainness of speech, the \"Deaf Pew.\" Some very deaf church members (when  the boys were herded elsewhere) sat on the pulpit stairs, and even in the  pulpit, alongside the preacher, where they disconcertingly upturned their  great tin ear-trumpets directly in his face. The persistent joining in the  psalm-singing by these deaf old soldiers and farmers was one of the bitter  trials which the leader of the choir had to endure.    The singers' seats were usually in the galleries; sometimes upon the ground  floor, in the \"hind-row on either side.\" Occasionally the choir sat in two  rows of seats that extended quite across the floor of the house, in front  of the deacons' seat and the pulpit. The men singers then sat facing the  congregation, while the women singers faced the pulpit. Between them ran a  long rack for the psalm-books. When they sang they stood up, and bawled and  fugued in each other's faces. Often a square pew was built for the singers,  and in the centre of this enclosure was a table, on which were laid, when  at rest, the psalm-books. When they sang, the choir thus formed a hollow  square, as does any determined band, for strength.    One other seat in the old Puritan meeting-house, a seat of gloom,  still throws its darksome shadow down through the years,--the stool of  repentance. \"Barbarous and cruel punishments\" were forbidden by the  statutes of the new colony, but on this terrible soul-rack the shrinking,  sullen, or defiant form of some painfully humiliated man or woman sat,  crushed, stunned, stupefied by overwhelming disgrace, through the long  Christian sermon; cowering before the hard, pitiless gaze of the assembled  and godly congregation, and the cold rebuke of the pious minister's averted  face; bearing on the poor sinful head a deep-branding paper inscribed in  \"Capitall Letters\" with the name of some dark or mysterious crime, or  wearing on the sleeve some strange and dread symbol, or on the breast a  scarlet letter.    Let us thank God that these soul-blasting and hope-killing exposures--so  degrading to the criminal, so demoralizing to the community,--these foul,  in-human blots on our fair and dearly loved Puritan Lord's Day, were never  frequent, nor did the form of punishment obtain for a long time. In 1681  two women were sentenced to sit during service on a high stool in the  middle alley of the Salem meeting-house, having on their heads a paper  bearing the name of their crime; and a woman in Agamenticus at about the  same date was ordered \"to stand in a white sheet publicly two several  Sabbath-Days with the mark of her offence on her forehead.\" These are the  latest records of this punishment that I have chanced to see.    Thus, from old church and town records, we plainly discover that each laic,  deacon, elder, criminal, singer, and even the ungodly boy had his alloted  place as absolutely assigned to him in the old meeting-house as was the  pulpit to the parson. Much has been said in semi-ridicule of this old  custom of \"seating\" and \"dignifying,\" yet it did not in reality differ much  from our modern way of selling the best pews to whoever will pay the most.  Perhaps the old way was the better, since, in the early churches, age,  education, dignity, and reputation were considered as well as wealth.          VI.    The Tithingman and the Sleepers.        The most grotesque, the most extraordinary, the most highly colored figure  in the dull New England church-life was the tithingman. This fairly  burlesque creature impresses me always with a sense of unreality, of  incongruity, of strange happening, like a jesting clown in a procession of  monks, like a strain of low comedy in the sober religious drama of early  New England Puritan life; so out of place, so unreal is this fussy,  pompous, restless tithingman, with his fantastic wand of office fringed  with dangling foxtails,--creaking, bustling, strutting, peering around the  quiet meeting-house, prodding and rapping the restless boys, waking the  drowsy sleepers; for they slept in country churches in the seventeenth  century, notwithstanding dread of fierce correction, just as they nod  and doze and softly puff, unawakened and unrebuked, in village churches  throughout New England in the nineteenth century.    This absurd and distorted type of the English church beadle, this colonial  sleep banisher, was equipped with a long staff, heavily knobbed at one end,  with which he severely and pitilessly rapped the heads of the too sleepy  men, and the too wide-awake boys. From the other end of this wand of office  depended a long foxtail, or a hare's-foot, which he softly thrust in the  faces of the sleeping Priscillas, Charitys, and Hopestills, and which  gently brushed and tickled them into reverent but startled wakefulness.    One zealous but too impetuous tithingman in his pious ardor of office  inadvertently applied the wrong end, the end with the heavy knob, the  masculine end, to a drowsy matron's head; and for this severely ungallant  mistake he was cautioned by the ruling elders to thereafter use \"more  discresing and less heist.\"    Another over-watchful Newbury \"awakener\" rapped on the head a nodding man  who protested indignantly that he was wide-awake, and was only bowing in  solemn assent and approval of the minister's arguments. Roger Scott, of  Lynn, in 1643 struck the tithingman who thus roughly and suddenly wakened  him; and poor sleepy and bewildered Roger, who is branded through all time  as \"a common sleeper at the publick exercise,\" was, for this most naturally  resentful act, but also most shockingly grave offence, soundly whipped, as  a warning both to keep awake and not to strike back in meeting.    Obadiah Turner, of Lynn, gives in his Journal a sad, sad disclosure of  total depravity which was exposed by one of these sudden church-awakenings,  and the story is best told in the journalist's own vivid words:--    \"June 3, 1616.--Allen Bridges hath bin chose to wake ye sleepers in  meeting. And being much proude of his place, must needs have a fox taile  fixed to ye ende of a long staff wherewith he may brush ye faces of them yt  will have napps in time of discourse, likewise a sharpe thorne whereby he  may pricke such as be most sound. On ye last Lord his day, as hee strutted  about ye meeting-house, he did spy Mr. Tomlins sleeping with much comfort,  hys head kept steadie by being in ye corner, and his hand grasping ye rail.  And soe spying, Allen did quickly thrust his staff behind Dame Ballard and  give him a grievous prick upon ye hand. Whereupon Mr. Tomlins did spring  vpp mch above ye floore, and with terrible force strike hys hand against  ye wall; and also, to ye great wonder of all, prophanlie exclaim in a loud  voice, curse ye wood-chuck, he dreaming so it seemed yt a wood-chuck had  seized and bit his hand. But on coming to know where he was, and ye greate  scandall he had committed, he seemed much abashed, but did not speak. And I  think he will not soon again goe to sleepe in meeting.\"    How clear the picture! Can you not see it?--the warm June sunlight  streaming in through the narrow, dusty windows of the old meeting-house;  the armed watcher at the door; the Puritan men and women in their  sad-colored mantles seated sternly upright on the hard narrow benches; the  black-gowned minister, the droning murmur of whose sleepy voice mingles  with the out-door sounds of the rustle of leafy branches, the song of  summer birds, the hum of buzzing insects, and the muffled stamping of  horses' feet; the restless boys on the pulpit-stairs; the tired, sleeping  Puritan with his head thrown back in the corner of the pew; the vain,  strutting, tithingman with his fantastic and thorned staff of office; and  then--the sudden, electric wakening, and the consternation of the whole  staid and pious congregation at such terrible profanity in the house of  God. Ah!--it was not two hundred and forty years ago; when I read the  quaint words my Puritan blood stirs my drowsy brain, and I remember it all  well, just as I saw it last summer in June.    Another catastrophe from too fierce zeal on the part of the tithingman  is recorded. An old farmer, worn out with a hard Saturday's work at  sheep-washing, fell asleep ere the"]]]
