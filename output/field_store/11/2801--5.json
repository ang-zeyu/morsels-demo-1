They noticed that everything around them was of a dull  gray color and that the path upon which they walked was soft and  springy, yet they had no suspicion that the rocks and trees were rubber  and even the path they trod was made of rubber.    Presently they came to a brook where sparkling water dashed through a  deep channel and rushed away between high rocks far down the  mountain-side. Across the brook were stepping-stones, so placed that  travelers might easily leap from one to another and in that manner  cross the water to the farther bank.    Tik-Tok was marching ahead, followed by his officers and Queen Ann.  After them came Betsy Bobbin and Hank, Polychrome and Shaggy, and last  of all the Rose Princess with Files. The Clockwork Man saw the stream  and the stepping-stones and, without making a pause, placed his foot  upon the first stone.    The result was astonishing. First he sank down in the soft rubber,  which then rebounded and sent Tik-Tok soaring high in the air, where he  turned a succession of flip-flops and alighted upon a rubber rock far  in the rear of the party.    General Apple did not see Tik-Tok bound, so quickly had he disappeared;  therefore he also stepped upon the stone (which you will guess was  connected with Kaliko's magnetic rubber wire) and instantly shot upward  like an arrow. General Cone came next and met with a like fate, but the  others now noticed that something was wrong and with one accord they  halted the column and looked back along the path.    There was Tik-Tok, still bounding from one rubber rock to another, each  time rising a less distance from the ground. And there was General  Apple, bounding away in another direction, his three-cornered hat  jammed over his eyes and his long sword thumping him upon the arms and  head as it swung this way and that. And there, also, appeared General  Cone, who had struck a rubber rock headforemost and was so crumpled up  that his round body looked more like a bouncing-ball than the form of a  man.    Betsy laughed merrily at the strange sight and Polychrome echoed her  laughter. But Ozga was grave and wondering, while Queen Ann became  angry at seeing the chief officers of the Army of Oogaboo bounding  around in so undignified a manner. She shouted to them to stop, but  they were unable to obey, even though they would have been glad to do  so. Finally, however, they all ceased bounding and managed to get upon  their feet and rejoin the Army.    \"Why did you do that?\" demanded Ann, who seemed greatly provoked.    \"Don't ask them why,\" said Shaggy earnestly. \"I knew you would ask them  why, but you ought not to do it. The reason is plain. Those stones are  rubber; therefore they are not stones. Those rocks around us are  rubber, and therefore they are not rocks. Even this path is not a path;  it's rubber. Unless we are very careful, your Majesty, we are all  likely to get the bounce, just as your poor officers and Tik-Tok did.\"    \"Then let's be careful,\" remarked Files, who was full of wisdom; but  Polychrome wanted to test the quality of the rubber, so she began  dancing. Every step sent her higher and higher into the air, so that  she resembled a big butterfly fluttering lightly. Presently she made a  great bound and bounded way across the stream, landing lightly and  steadily on the other side.    \"There is no rubber over here,\" she called to them. \"Suppose you all  try to bound over the stream, without touching the stepping-stones.\"    Ann and her officers were reluctant to undertake such a risky  adventure, but Betsy at once grasped the value of the suggestion and  began jumping up and down until she found herself bounding almost as  high as Polychrome had done. Then she suddenly leaned forward and the  next bound took her easily across the brook, where she alighted by the  side of the Rainbow's Daughter.    \"Come on, Hank!\" called the girl, and the donkey tried to obey. He  managed to bound pretty high but when he tried to bound across the  stream he misjudged the distance and fell with a splash into the middle  of the water.    \"Hee-haw!\" he wailed, struggling toward the far bank. Betsy rushed  forward to help him out, but when the mule stood safely beside her she  was amazed to find he was not wet at all.    \"It's dry water,\" said Polychrome, dipping her hand into the stream and  showing how the water fell from it and left it perfectly dry.    \"In that case,\" returned Betsy, \"they can all walk through the water.\"    She called to Ozga and Shaggy to wade across, assuring them the water  was shallow and would not wet them. At once they followed her advice,  avoiding the rubber stepping stones, and made the crossing with ease.  This encouraged the entire party to wade through the dry water, and in  a few minutes all had assembled on the bank and renewed their journey  along the path that led to the Nome King's dominions.    When Kaliko again looked through his magic spyglass he exclaimed:    \"Bad luck, Your Majesty! All the invaders have passed the Rubber  Country and now are fast approaching the entrance to your caverns.\"    Ruggedo raved and stormed at the news and his anger was so great that  several times, as he strode up and down his jeweled cavern, he paused  to kick Kaliko upon his shins, which were so sensitive that the poor  nome howled with pain. Finally the King said:    \"There's no help for it; we must drop these audacious invaders down the  Hollow Tube.\"    Kaliko gave a jump, at this, and looked at his master wonderingly.    \"If you do that, Your Majesty,\" he said, \"you will make Tititi-Hoochoo  very angry.\"    \"Never mind that,\" retorted Ruggedo. \"Tititi-Hoochoo lives on the other  side of the world, so what do I care for his anger?\"    Kaliko shuddered and uttered a little groan.    \"Remember his terrible powers,\" he pleaded, \"and remember that he  warned you, the last time you slid people through the Hollow Tube, that  if you did it again he would take vengeance upon you.\"    The Metal Monarch walked up and down in silence, thinking deeply.    \"Of two dangers,\" said he, \"it is wise to choose the least. What do you  suppose these invaders want?\"    \"Let the Long-Eared Hearer listen to them,\" suggested Kaliko.    \"Call him here at once!\" commanded Ruggedo eagerly.    So in a few minutes there entered the cavern a nome with enormous ears,  who bowed low before the King.    \"Strangers are approaching,\" said Ruggedo, \"and I wish to know their  errand. Listen carefully to their talk and tell me why they are coming  here, and what for.\"    The nome bowed again and spread out his great ears, swaying them gently  up and down and back and forth. For half an hour he stood silent, in an  attitude of listening, while both the King and Kaliko grew impatient at  the delay. At last the Long-Eared Hearer spoke:    \"Shaggy Man is coming here to rescue his brother from captivity,\" said  he.    \"Ha, the Ugly One!\" exclaimed Ruggedo. \"Well, Shaggy Man may have his  ugly brother, for all I care. He's too lazy to work and is always  getting in my way. Where is the Ugly One now, Kaliko?\"    \"The last time Your Majesty stumbled over the prisoner you commanded me  to send him to the Metal Forest, which I did. I suppose he is still  there.\"    \"Very good. The invaders will have a hard time finding the Metal  Forest,\" said the King, with a grin of malicious delight, \"for half the  time I can't find it myself. Yet I created the forest and made every  tree, out of gold and silver, so as to keep the precious metals in a  safe place and out of the reach of mortals. But tell me, Hearer, do the  strangers want anything else?\"    \"Yes, indeed they do!\" returned the nome. \"The Army of Oogaboo is  determined to capture all the rich metals and rare jewels in your  kingdom, and the officers and their Queen have arranged to divide the  spoils and carry them away.\"    When he heard this Ruggedo uttered a bellow of rage and began dancing  up and down, rolling his eyes, clicking his teeth together and swinging  his arms furiously. Then, in an ecstasy of anger he seized the long  ears of the Hearer and pulled and twisted them cruelly; but Kaliko  grabbed up the King's sceptre and rapped him over the knuckles with it,  so that Ruggedo let go the ears and began to chase his Royal  Chamberlain around the throne.    The Hearer took advantage of this opportunity to slip away from the  cavern and escape, and after the King had tired himself out chasing  Kaliko he threw himself into his throne and panted for breath, while he  glared wickedly at his defiant subject.    \"You'd better save your strength to fight the enemy,\" suggested Kaliko.  \"There will be a terrible battle when the Army of Oogaboo gets here.\"    \"The Army won't get here,\" said the King, still coughing and panting.  \"I'll drop 'em down the Hollow Tube--every man Jack and every girl Jill  of 'em!\"    \"And defy Tititi-Hoochoo?\" asked Kaliko.    \"Yes. Go at once to my Chief Magician and order him to turn the path  toward the Hollow Tube, and to make the tip of the Tube invisible, so  they'll all fall into it.\"    Kaliko went away shaking his head, for he thought Ruggedo was making a  great mistake.  He found the Magician and had the path twisted so that  it led directly to the opening of the Hollow Tube, and this opening he  made invisible.    Having obeyed the orders of his master, the Royal Chamberlain went to  his private room and began to write letters of recommendation of  himself, stating that he was an honest man, a good servant and a small  eater.    \"Pretty soon,\" he said to himself, \"I shall have to look for another  job, for it is certain that Ruggedo has ruined himself by this reckless  defiance of the mighty Tititi-Hoochoo. And in seeking a job nothing is  so effective as a letter of recommendation.\"          Chapter Ten    A Terrible Tumble Through a Tube      I suppose that Polychrome, and perhaps Queen Ann and her Army, might  have been able to dispel the enchantment of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],[0,"The Scarecrow of Oz (#10)"],[1,"to the mountain-top from the plains  below. While he worked, Trot ate popcorn and found it crisp and  slightly warm, as well as nicely salted and buttered. Presently Cap'n  Bill came out of the house and joined her.    \"What's this?\" he asked.    \"Mo snow,\" said she. \"But it isn't real snow, although it falls from  the sky. It's popcorn.\"    Cap'n Bill tasted it; then he sat down in the path and began to eat.  The Ork came out and pecked away with its bill as fast as it could.  They all liked popcorn and they all were hungry this morning.    Meantime the flakes of \"Mo snow\" came down so fast that the number of  them almost darkened the air. The Bumpy Man was now shoveling quite a  distance down the mountain-side, while the path behind him rapidly  filled up with fresh-fallen popcorn. Suddenly Trot heard him call out:    \"Goodness gracious--mince pie and pancakes!--here is some one buried in  the snow.\"    She ran toward him at once and the others followed, wading through the  corn and crunching it underneath their feet. The Mo snow was pretty  deep where the Bumpy Man was shoveling and from beneath a great bank of  it he had uncovered a pair of feet.    \"Dear me!  Someone has been lost in the storm,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I  hope he is still alive. Let's pull him out and see.\"    He took hold of one foot and the Bumpy Man took hold of the other. Then  they both pulled and out from the heap of popcorn came a little boy. He  was dressed in a brown velvet jacket and knickerbockers, with brown  stockings, buckled shoes and a blue shirt-waist that had frills down  its front. When drawn from the heap the boy was chewing a mouthful of  popcorn and both his hands were full of it. So at first he couldn't  speak to his rescuers but lay quite still and eyed them calmly until he  had swallowed his mouthful. Then he said:    \"Get my cap,\" and stuffed more popcorn into his mouth.    While the Bumpy Man began shoveling into the corn-bank to find the  boy's cap, Trot was laughing joyfully and Cap'n Bill had a broad grin  on his face. The Ork looked from one to another and asked:    \"Who is this stranger?\"    \"Why, it's Button-Bright, of course,\" answered Trot. \"If anyone ever  finds a lost boy, he can make up his mind it's Button-Bright. But how  he ever came to be lost in this far-away country is more'n I can make  out.\"    \"Where does he belong?\" inquired the Ork.    \"His home used to be in Philadelphia, I think; but I'm quite sure  Button-Bright doesn't belong anywhere.\"    \"That's right,\" said the boy, nodding his head as he swallowed the  second mouthful.    \"Everyone belongs somewhere,\" remarked the Ork.    \"Not me,\" insisted Button-Bright. \"I'm half way round the world from  Philadelphia, and I've lost my Magic Umbrella, that used to carry me  anywhere. Stands to reason that if I can't get back I haven't any home.  But I don't care much. This is a pretty good country, Trot. I've had  lots of fun here.\"    By this time the Mountain Ear had secured the boy's cap and was  listening to the conversation with much interest.    \"It seems you know this poor, snow-covered cast-away,\" he said.    \"Yes, indeed,\" answered Trot.  \"We made a journey together to Sky  Island, once, and were good friends.\"    \"Well, then I'm glad I saved his life,\" said the Bumpy Man.    \"Much obliged, Mr. Knobs,\" said Button-Bright, sitting up and staring  at him, \"but I don't believe you've saved anything except some popcorn  that I might have eaten had you not disturbed me. It was nice and warm  in that bank of popcorn, and there was plenty to eat. What made you dig  me out? And what makes you so bumpy everywhere?\"    \"As for the bumps,\" replied the man, looking at himself with much  pride, \"I was born with them and I suspect they were a gift from the  fairies. They make me look rugged and big, like the mountain I serve.\"    \"All right,\" said Button-Bright and began eating popcorn again.    It had stopped snowing, now, and great flocks of birds were gathering  around the mountain-side, eating the popcorn with much eagerness and  scarcely noticing the people at all. There were birds of every size and  color, most of them having gorgeous feathers and plumes.    \"Just look at them!\" exclaimed the Ork scornfully. \"Aren't they  dreadful creatures, all covered with feathers?\"    \"I think they're beautiful,\" said Trot, and this made the Ork so  indignant that he went back into the house and sulked.    Button-Bright reached out his hand and caught a big bird by the leg. At  once it rose into the air and it was so strong that it nearly carried  the little boy with it. He let go the leg in a hurry and the bird flew  down again and began to eat of the popcorn, not being frightened in the  least.    This gave Cap'n Bill an idea. He felt in his pocket and drew out  several pieces of stout string. Moving very quietly, so as to not alarm  the birds, he crept up to several of the biggest ones and tied cords  around their legs, thus making them prisoners.  The birds were so  intent on their eating that they did not notice what had happened to  them, and when about twenty had been captured in this manner Cap'n Bill  tied the ends of all the strings together and fastened them to a huge  stone, so they could not escape.    The Bumpy Man watched the old sailor's actions with much curiosity.    \"The birds will be quiet until they've eaten up all the snow,\" he said,  \"but then they will want to fly away to their homes. Tell me, sir, what  will the poor things do when they find they can't fly?\"    \"It may worry 'em a little,\" replied Cap'n Bill, \"but they're not going  to be hurt if they take it easy and behave themselves.\"    Our friends had all made a good breakfast of the delicious popcorn and  now they walked toward the house again. Button-Bright walked beside  Trot and held her hand in his, because they were old friends and he  liked the little girl very much. The boy was not so old as Trot, and  small as she was he was half a head shorter in height. The most  remarkable thing about Button-Bright was that he was always quiet and  composed, whatever happened, and nothing was ever able to astonish him.  Trot liked him because he was not rude and never tried to plague her.  Cap'n Bill liked him because he had found the boy cheerful and brave at  all times, and willing to do anything he was asked to do.    When they came to the house Trot sniffed the air and asked \"Don't I  smell perfume?\"    \"I think you do,\" said the Bumpy Man. \"You smell violets, and that  proves there is a breeze springing up from the south. All our winds and  breezes are perfumed and for that reason we are glad to have them blow  in our direction. The south breeze always has a violet odor; the north  breeze has the fragrance of wild roses; the east breeze is perfumed  with lilies-of-the-valley and the west wind with lilac blossoms. So we  need no weathervane to tell us which way the wind is blowing. We have  only to smell the perfume and it informs us at once.\"    Inside the house they found the Ork, and Button-Bright regarded the  strange, birdlike creature with curious interest. After examining it  closely for a time he asked:    \"Which way does your tail whirl?\"    \"Either way,\" said the Ork.    Button-Bright put out his hand and tried to spin it.    \"Don't do that!\" exclaimed the Ork.    \"Why not?\" inquired the boy.    \"Because it happens to be my tail, and I reserve the right to whirl it  myself,\" explained the Ork.    \"Let's go out and fly somewhere,\" proposed Button-Bright. \"I want to  see how the tail works.\"    \"Not now,\" said the Ork. \"I appreciate your interest in me, which I  fully deserve; but I only fly when I am going somewhere, and if I got  started I might not stop.\"    \"That reminds me,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, \"to ask you, friend Ork, how we  are going to get away from here?\"    \"Get away!\" exclaimed the Bumpy Man. \"Why don't you stay here? You  won't find any nicer place than Mo.\"    \"Have you been anywhere else, sir?\"    \"No; I can't say that I have,\" admitted the Mountain Ear.    \"Then permit me to say you're no judge,\" declared Cap'n Bill. \"But you  haven't answered my question, friend Ork. How are we to get away from  this mountain?\"    The Ork reflected a while before he answered.    \"I might carry one of you--the boy or the girl--upon my back,\" said he,  \"but three big people are more than I can manage, although I have  carried two of you for a short distance. You ought not to have eaten  those purple berries so soon.\"    \"P'r'aps we did make a mistake,\" Cap'n Bill acknowledged.    \"Or we might have brought some of those lavender berries with us,  instead of so many purple ones,\" suggested Trot regretfully.    Cap'n Bill made no reply to this statement, which showed he did not  fully agree with the little girl; but he fell into deep thought, with  wrinkled brows, and finally he said:    \"If those purple berries would make anything grow bigger, whether it'd  eaten the lavender ones or not, I could find a way out of our troubles.\"    They did not understand this speech and looked at the old sailor as if  expecting him to explain what he meant. But just then a chorus of  shrill cries rose from outside.    \"Here! Let me go--let me go!\" the voices seemed to say. \"Why are we  insulted in this way? Mountain Ear, come and help us!\"    Trot ran to the window and looked out.    \"It's the birds you caught, Cap'n,\" she said. \"I didn't know they could  talk.\"    \"Oh, yes; all the birds in Mo are educated to talk,\" said the Bumpy  Man. Then he looked at Cap'n Bill uneasily and added: \"Won't you let  the poor things go?\"    \"I'll see,\" replied the sailor, and walked out to where the birds were  fluttering and complaining because the strings would not allow them to  fly away.    \"Listen to me!\" he cried, and at once they became still. \"We three  people who are strangers in your land want to go to some other country,  and we want three of you birds to carry us there. We know we are asking  a"]]]
