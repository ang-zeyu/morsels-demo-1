The circulation is largely under the  control of the will and rhythmic breathing renders the task easier.    (5) SELF-HEALING.    Lying in a relaxed condition, breathe rhythmically, and command that a  good supply of prana be inhaled. With the exhalation, send the prana  to the affected part for the purpose of stimulating it. Vary this  occasionally by exhaling, with the mental command that the diseased  condition be forced out and disappear. Use the hands in this exercise,  passing them down the body from the head to the affected part. In  using the hands in healing yourself or others always hold the mental  image that the prana is flowing down the arm and through the finger  tips into the body, thus reaching the affected part and healing it. Of  course we can give only general directions in this book without taking  up the several forms of disease in detail, but a little practice of  the above exercise, varying it slightly to fit the conditions of the  case, will produce wonderful results. Some Yogis follow the plan of  placing both hands on the affected part, and then breathing  rhythmically, holding the mental image that they are fairly pumping  prana into the diseased organ and part, stimulating it and driving out  diseased conditions, as pumping into a pail of dirty water will drive  out the latter and fill the bucket with fresh water. This last plan is  very effective if the mental image of the pump is clearly held, the  inhalation representing the lifting of the pump handle and the  exhalation the actual pumping.    (6) HEALING OTHERS.    We cannot take up the question of the psychic treatment of disease by  prana in detail in this book, as such would be foreign to its purpose.  But we can and will give you simple, plain instructions whereby you  may be enabled to do much good in relieving others. The main principle  to remember is that by rhythmic breathing and controlled thought you  are enabled to absorb a considerable amount of prana, and are also  able to pass it into the body of another person, stimulating weakened  parts and organs and imparting health and driving out diseased  conditions. You must first learn to form such a clear mental image of  the desired condition that you will be able to actually feel the  influx of prana, and the force running down your arms and out of your  finger tips into the body of the patient. Breathe rhythmically a few  times until the rhythm is fairly established, then place your bands  upon the affected part of the body of the patient, letting them rest  lightly over the part. Then follow the \"pumping\" process described to  the preceding exercise (Self-Healing) and fill the patient full of  prana until the diseased condition is driven out. Every once in a  while raise the hands and \"flick\" the fingers as if you were throwing  off the diseased condition. It is well to do this occasionally and  also to wash the hands after treatment, as otherwise you may take on a  trace of the diseased condition of the patient. Also practice the  Cleansing Breath several times after the treatment. During the  treatment let the prana pour into the patient in one continuous  stream, allowing yourself to be merely the pumping machinery  connecting the patient with the universal supply of prana, and  allowing it to flow freely through you. You need not work the hands  vigorously, but simply enough that the prana freely reaches the  affected parts. The rhythmic breathing must be practiced frequently  during the treatment, so as to keep the rhythm normal and to afford  the prana a free passage. It is better to place the hands on the bare  skin, but where this is not advisable or possible place them over the  clothing. Vary above method occasionally during the treatment by  stroking the body gently and softly with the finger tips, the fingers  being kept slightly separated. This is very soothing to the patient.  In cases of long standing you may find it helpful to give the mental  command in words, such as \"get out, get out,\" or \"be strong, be  strong,\" as the case may be, the words helping you to exercise the  will more forcibly and to the point. Vary these instructions to suit  the needs of the case, and use your own judgment and inventive  faculty. We have given you the general principles and you can apply  them in hundreds of different ways. The above apparently simple  instruction, if carefully studied and applied, will enable one to  accomplish all that the leading \"magnetic healers\" are able to,  although their \"systems\" are more or less cumbersome and complicated.  They are using prana ignorantly and calling it \"magnetism.\" If they  would combine rhythmic breathing with their \"magnetic\" treatment they  would double their efficiency.    (7) DISTANT HEALING.    Prana colored by the thought of the sender may be projected to persons  at a distance, who are willing to receive it, and healing work done in  this way. This is the secret of the \"absent healing,\" of which the  Western world has heard so much of late years. The thought of the  healer sends forth and colors the prana of the sender, and it flashes  across space and finds lodgment in the psychic mechanism of the  patient. It is unseen, and like the Marconi waves, it passes through  intervening obstacles and seeks the person attuned to receive it. In  order to treat persons at a distance, you must form a mental image of  them until you can feel yourself to be en rapport with them. This is a  psychic process dependent upon the mental imagery of the healer. You  can feel the sense of rapport when it is established, it manifesting  in a sense of nearness. That is about as plain as we can describe it.  It may be acquired by a little practice, and some will get it at the  first trial. When rapport is established, say mentally to the distant  patient, \"I am sending you a supply of vital force or power, which  will invigorate you and heal you.\" Then picture the prana as leaving  your mind with each exhalation of rhythmic breath, and traveling  across space instantaneously and reaching the patient and healing him.  It is not necessary to fix certain hours for treatment, although you  may do so if you wish. The receptive condition of the patient, as he  is expecting and opening himself up to your psychic force, attunes him  to receive your vibrations whenever you may send them. If you agree  upon hours, let him place himself in a relaxed attitude and receptive  condition. The above is the great underlying principle of the \"absent  treatment\" of the Western world. You may do these things as well as  the most noted healers, with a little practice.          CHAPTER XV.      MORE PHENOMENA OF YOGI PSYCHIC BREATHING.    (1) THOUGHT PROJECTION.    Thoughts may be projected by following the last mentioned method  (Distant Healing) and others will feel the effect of thought so sent  forth, it being remembered always that no evil thought can ever injure  another person whose thoughts are good. Good thoughts are always  positive to bad ones, and bad ones always negative to good ones. One  can, however, excite the interest and attention of another by sending  him thought waves in this way, charging the prana with the message he  wishes to convey. If you desire another's love and sympathy, and  possess love and sympathy for him, you can send him thoughts of this  kind with effect, providing your motives are pure. Never, however,  attempt to influence another to his hurt, or from impure or selfish  motives, as such thoughts only recoil upon the sender with redoubled  force, and injure him, while the innocent party is not affected.  Psychic force when legitimately used is all right, but beware of  \"black magic\" or improper and unholy uses of it, as such attempts are  like playing with a dynamo, and the person attempting such things will  be surely punished by the result of the act itself. However, no person  of impure motives ever acquires a great degree of psychic power, and a  pure heart and mind is an invulnerable shield against improper psychic  power. Keep yourself pure and nothing can hurt you.    (2) FORMING AN AURA.    If you are ever in the company of persons of a low order of mind, and  you feel the depressing influence of their thought, breathe  rhythmically a few times, thus generating an additional supply of  prana, and then by means of the mental image method surround yourself  with an egg-shaped thought aura, which will protect you from the gross  thought and disturbing influences of others.    (3) RECHARGING YOURSELF.    If you feel that your vital energy is at a low ebb, and that you need  to store up a new supply quickly, the best plan is to place the feet  close together (side by side, of course) and to lock the fingers of  both hands in any way that seems the most comfortable. This closes the  circuit, as it were, and prevents any escape of prana through the  extremities. Then breathe rhythmically a few times, and you will feel  the effect of the recharging.    (4) RECHARGING OTHERS.    If some friend is deficient in vitality you may aid him by sitting in  front of him, your toes touching his, and his hands in yours. Then  both breathe rhythmically, you forming the mental image of sending  prana into his system, and he holding the mental image of receiving  the prana. Persons of weak vitality or passive will should be careful  with whom they try this experiment, as the prana of a person of evil  desires will be colored with the thoughts of that person, and may give  him a temporary influence over the weaker person. The latter, however,  may easily remove such influence by closing the circuit (as before  mentioned) and breathing a few rhythmic breaths, closing with the  Cleansing Breath.    (5) CHARGING WATER.    Water may be charged with prana, by breathing rhythmically, and  holding the glass of water by the bottom, in the left hand, and then  gathering the fingers of the right hand together and shaking them  gently over "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13407"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Gnani Yoga: The Yoga of Wisdom (#11)"],[1,"see!    Potatoes in dark cellars have sent out roots or sprouts twenty and  thirty feet to reach light. Plants will send out roots many feet to  reach water. They know where the water and light are, and where to  reach them. The tendrils of a plant know where the stake or cord is,  and they reach out for it and twine themselves around it. Unwind them,  and the next day they are found again twined around it. Move the stake  or cord, and the tendril moves after it. The insect-eating plants are  able to distinguish between nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous food,  accepting the one and rejecting the other. They recognize that cheese  has the same nourishing properties as the insect, and they accept it,  although it is far different in feeling, taste, appearance and every  other characteristic from their accustomed food.    Case after case might be mentioned and cited to show the operation of  the Will in plant-life. But wonderful as are many of these cases, the  mere action of the Will as shown in the _growing_ of the plant is just  as wonderful. Just imagine a tiny seed, and see it sprout and draw to  itself the nourishment from water, air, light and soil, then upward  until it becomes a great tree with bark, limbs, branches, leaves,  blossoms, fruit and all. Think of this miracle, and consider what must  be the power and nature of that Will that causes it.    The growing plant manifests sufficient strength to crack great stones,  and lift great slabs of pavement, as may be noticed by examining the  sidewalks of suburban towns and parks. An English paper prints a report  of four enormous mushrooms having lifted a huge slab of paving stone in  a crowded street overnight. Think of this exhibition of Energy and  Power. This wonderful faculty of exerting force and motion and energy  is fundamental in the Will, for indeed every physical change and growth  is the result of motion, and motion arises only from force and  pressure. Whose force, energy, power and motion? The Will's!    On all sides of us we may see this constant and steady urge and  pressure behind living forces, and inorganic forms as well--always a  manifestation of Energy and Power. And all this Power is in the  Will--and the Will is but the manifestation of the All-Power--the  Absolute. Remember this.    And this power manifests itself not only in the matter of growth and  ordinary movements, but also in some other ways that seem quite  mysterious to even modern Science. How is it that certain birds are  able to fly directly against a strong wind, without visible movement of  their wings? How do the buzzards float in the air, and make speed  without a motion of the wing? What is the explanation of the movements  of certain microscopic creatures who lack organs of movement? Listen to  this instance related by the scientist Benet. He states that the  Polycystids have a most peculiar manner of moving--a sort of sliding  motion, to the right or left, upward, backward, sideways, stopping and  starting, fast or slow, as it wills. It has no locomotive organs, and  no movement can be seen to take place in the body from within or  without. It simply slides. How?    Passing on to the higher animal life--how do eggs grow into chickens?  What is the power in the germ of the egg? Can the germ think, and plan,  and move, and grow into a chicken? Or is the Will at work there? And  what is true in this case, is true of the birth and growth of all  animal life--all animal life develops from a single germ cell. How, and  Why?    There is a mental energy resident in the germ cell--of this there can  be no doubt. And that mental energy is the Creative Will ever  manifesting. Listen to these words from Huxley, the eminent scientist.  He says:    \"The student of Nature wonders the more and is astonished the less, the  more conversant he becomes with her operations; but of all the  perennial miracles she offers to his inspection, perhaps the most  worthy of his admiration is the development of a plant or of an animal  from its embryo. Examine the recently laid egg of some common animal,  such as a salamander or a newt. It is a minute spheroid in which the  best microscope will reveal nothing but a structureless sac, enclosing  a glairy fluid, holding granules in suspension. But strange  possibilities lie dormant in that semi-fluid globule. Let a moderate  supply of warmth reach its watery cradle, and the plastic matter  undergoes changes so rapid, and so purposelike in their succession,  that one can only compare them to those operated by a skilled modeller  upon a formless lump of clay. As with an invisible trowel, the mass is  divided and subdivided into smaller and smaller portions, until it is  reduced to an aggregation of granules not too large to build withal the  finest fabrics of the nascent organism. And, then, it is as if a  delicate finger traced out the line to be occupied by the spinal  column, and moulded the contour of the body; pinching up the head at  one end, the tail at the other, and fashioning flank and limb into due  salamanderine proportions, in so artistic a way that, after watching  the process hour by hour, one is almost involuntarily possessed by the  notion that some more subtle aid to vision than the achromatic lens  would show the hidden artist, with his plan before him, striving with  skilful manipulation to perfect his work.    \"As life advances and the young amphibian ranges the waters, the terror  of his insect contemporaries, not only are the nutritious particles  supplied by its prey (by the addition of which to its frame growth  takes place) laid down, each in its proper spot, and in due proportion  to the rest, as to reproduce the form, the color, and the size,  characteristic of the parental stock; but even the wonderful powers of  reproducing lost parts possessed by these animals are controlled by the  same governing tendency. Cut off the legs, the tail, the jaws,  separately or all together, and as Spallanzani showed long ago, these  parts not only grow again, but the new limb is formed on the same type  as those which were lost. The new jaw, or leg, is a newt's, and never  by any accident more like that of a frog's.\"    In this passage from Huxley one may see the actual working of the  Creative Will of the Universe,--moving behind the curtain--and a very  thin curtain at that. And this wonderful work is going on all around  us, all the time. Miracles are being accomplished every second--they  are so common that we fail to regard them.    And in our bodies is the Will at work? Most certainly. What built you  up from single cell to maturity? Did you do it with your intellect? Has  not every bit of it been done without your conscious knowledge? It is  only when things go wrong, owing to the violation of some law, that you  become aware of your internal organs. And, yet, stomach and liver, and  heart and the rest have been performing their work steadily--working  away day and night, building up, repairing, nourishing, growing you  into a man or woman, and keeping you sound and strong. Are you doing  this with your reason or with your personal will? No, it is the great  Creative Will of the Universe, Universe,--the expression of the purpose  and power of the One, working in and through you. It is the One Life  manifesting in you through its Creative Will.    And not only is this all. The Creative Will is all around us in every  force, energy and principle. The force that we call mental power is the  principle of the Will directed by our individual minds. In this  statement we have a hint of the great mystery of Mental Force and  Power, and the so-called Psychic Phenomena. It also gives us a key to  Mental Healing. This is not the place to go into detail regarding these  phases--but think over it a bit. This Will Power of the Universe, in  all of its forms and phases, from Electricity to Thought-power, is  always at the disposal of Man, within limits, and subject always to the  laws of the Creative Will of the Universe. Those who acquire an  understanding of the laws of any force may use it. And any force may be  used or misused.    And the nearer in understanding and consciousness that we get to the  One Life and Power, the greater will be our possible power, for we are  thus getting closer and closer to the source of All Power. In these  lessons we hope to be able to tell you how you may come into closer  touch with this One Life of which you and all living things are but  forms, shapes and channels of expression, under the operation of the  Creative Will.    We trust that this lesson may have brought to your minds the  realization of the Oneness of All--the fact that we are all parts of  the one encircling unity, the heart-throbs and pulsations of which are  to be felt even to the outer edge of the circle of life--in Man, in  Monad, in Crystal, in Atom. Try to feel that inner essence of Creative  Will that is within yourselves, and endeavor to realize your complete  inner unity in it, with all other forms of life. Try to realize, as  some recent writer has expressed it, \"that all the living world is but  mankind in the making, and that we are but part of the All.\" And also  remember that splendid vistas of future unfoldment spread themselves  out before the gaze of the awakened soul, until the mind fails to grasp  the wondrous sight.    We will now close this lesson by calling your attention to its      CENTRAL THOUGHT.    There is but One Power in the Universe--One Energy--One Force. And that  Power, Energy and Force is a manifestation of the One Life. There can  be no other Power, for there is none other than the One from whom Power  may come. And there can be no manifestation of Power that is not the  Power of the One, for no other Power can be in existence. The Power of  the One is visible in its manifestations to us in the natural laws and  forces of Nature--which we call the Creative Will. This Creative Will  is the inner"]]]
