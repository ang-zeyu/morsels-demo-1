'Father,' cried she, stopping just before  him, 'you may judge of my impatience to have your nephew with me,  by my punctual coming to put you in mind of your promise. I know  you are a man of your word, and I cannot think you will break it  with me.'    Abdallah, who fell on his face as soon as he saw the queen  approaching, rose up when she had done speaking; and as he wanted  nobody to hear what he had a mind to say to her, he advanced with  great respect as far as her horse's head, and then said softly,  'Powerful queen! I am persuaded your majesty will not be offended  at my seeming unwillingness to trust my nephew with you yesterday,  since you cannot be ignorant of the reasons I had for it; but I  implore you to lay aside the secrets of that art which you possess  in so wonderful a degree. I regard my nephew as my own son; and  your majesty would reduce me to despair if you should deal with him  as you have done with others.'    'I promise you I will not,' replied the queen; 'and I once more  repeat the oath I made yesterday, that neither you nor your nephew  shall have any cause to be offended with me. I see plainly,' added  she, 'you are not yet well enough acquainted with me; you never saw  me yet but through a veil; but as I find your nephew worthy of my  friendship, I will show you I am not in any way unworthy of his.'  With that she threw off her veil and showed King Beder, who came  near her with Abdallah, incomparable beauty.    But King Beder was little charmed. 'It is not enough,' said he  within himself, 'to be beautiful; one's actions ought to  correspond.'    Whilst King Beder was making these reflections, with his eyes fixed  on Queen Labe, the old man turned towards him, and taking him by  the arm, presented him to her majesty. 'Here he is, madam,' said  he, 'and I beg of your majesty once more to remember he is my  nephew, and to let him come and see me sometimes.' The queen  promised he should; and to give a further mark of her gratitude,  she caused a bag of a thousand pieces of gold to be given him. He  excused himself at first from receiving them, but she insisted  absolutely upon it, and he could not refuse her. She had caused a  horse to be brought (as richly harnessed as her own) for the King  of Persia.    When King Beder was mounted, he would have taken his place behind  the queen, but she would not suffer him, and made him ride on her  left hand. She looked at Abdallah, and after having made him an  inclination with her head, she set forward on her march.    Instead of observing a satisfaction in the people's faces at the  sight of their sovereign, King Beder took notice that they looked  at her with contempt, and even cursed her. 'The sorceress,' said  some, 'has got a new subject to exercise her wickedness upon: will  Heaven never deliver the world from her tyranny?' 'Poor stranger!'  cried out others, 'thou art much deceived if thou thinkest thine  happiness will last long. It is only to render thy fall most  terrible that thou art raised so high.' This talk gave King Beder  to understand that Abdallah had told him nothing but the truth of  Queen Labe: but as it now depended no longer on himself to escape  the mischief, he committed himself to divine Providence and the  will of Heaven respecting his fate.    The magic queen arrived at her palace; she alighted, and giving her  hand to King Beder, entered with him, accompanied by her women and  the officers. She herself showed him all her apartments, where  there was nothing to be seen but massy gold, precious stones, and  furniture of wonderful magnificence. Then she led him out into a  balcony, from whence he observed a garden of surprising beauty.  King Beder commended all he saw, but so that he might not be  discovered to be any other than old Abdallah's nephew. They  discoursed of indifferent matters, till the queen was informed that  dinner was upon the table.    The queen and King Beder arose, and sat down at the table, which  was of massy gold, and the dishes of the same metal. They began to  eat, but drank hardly at all till the dessert came, when the queen  caused a cup to be filled for her with excellent wine. She took it  and drank to King Beder's health; and then, without putting it out  of her hand, caused it to be filled again, and presented it to him.  King Beder received it with profound respect, and by a very low bow  signified to her majesty that he in return drank to her health.    At the same time ten of Queen Labe's women entered with musical  instruments, with which they made an agreeable concert. At length  both began so to be heated with wine, that King Beder forgot he had  to do with a magic queen, and looked upon her only as the most  beautiful queen he ever saw.    Next morning the women who had served the king presented him with  fine linen and a magnificent robe. The queen likewise, who was more  splendidly dressed than the day before, came to receive him, and  they went together to her apartments, where they had a good repast  brought them, and spent the remainder of the day in walking in the  garden, and in various other amusements.    Queen Labe treated King Beder after this manner for forty days, as  she had been accustomed to do to all the others. The fortieth night  she arose without making any noise and came into his room; but he  was awake, and perceiving she had some design upon him, watched all  her motions. She opened a chest, from whence she took a little box  full of a certain yellow powder; taking some of the powder, she  laid a train of it across the chamber, and it immediately flowed in  a rivulet of water, to the great astonishment of King Beder. He  trembled with fear, but still pretended to sleep, that the  sorceress might not discover he was awake.    Queen Labe next took up some of the water in a vessel, and poured  it into a basin, where there was flour, with which she made a  paste, and kneaded it for a long time: then she mixed with it  certain drugs, which she took from different boxes, and made a  cake, which she put into a covered baking-pan. As she had taken  care first of all to make a good fire, she took some of the coals,  and set the pan upon them; and while the cake was baking, she put  up the vessels and boxes in their places again; and on her  pronouncing certain words, the rivulet, which ran along the end of  the room, appeared no more. When the cake was baked, she took it  off the coals, and carried it into her room, without the least  suspicion that he had seen anything of what she had done.    King Beder, whom the pleasures and amusements of a court had made  forget his good host Abdallah, began now to think of him again, and  believed he had more than ordinary occasion for his advice, after  all he had seen the queen do that night. As soon as he was up,  therefore, he expressed a great desire to go and see his uncle, and  begged her majesty to permit him. 'What! my dear Beder,' cried the  queen, 'are you then already tired, I will not say with living in  so superb a palace as mine is, where you must find so many  pleasures, but with the company of a queen who is so fond of you as  I am?'    'Great queen!' answered King Beder, 'how can I be tired of so many  favours and graces as your majesty perpetually heaps upon me? I  must own, however, it is partly for this reason, that, my uncle  loving me so tenderly, as I well know he does, and I having been  absent from him now forty days, without once seeing him, I would  not give him reason to think that I consent to remain longer  without seeing him.'    'Go,' said the queen, 'you have my consent; but do not be long  before you return.' This said, she ordered him a horse richly  caparisoned, and he departed.    Old Abdallah was overjoyed to see King Beder; he embraced him  tenderly, and King Beder did the same. As soon as they had sat  down, 'Well,' said Abdallah to the king, 'how have you been, and  how have you passed your time with that infidel sorceress?'    'Hitherto,' answered King Beder, 'I must needs own she has been  extraordinarily kind to me, but I observed something last night  which gives me just reason to suspect that all her kindness  hitherto is but dissimulation.' He related to Abdallah how and  after what manner he had seen her make the cake; and then added,  'Hitherto, I must needs confess I had almost forgotten, not only  you, but all the advice you gave me concerning the wickedness of  this queen; but this last action of hers gives me reason to fear  she does not intend to observe any of her promises or solemn oaths  to you. I thought of you immediately, and I esteem myself happy in  that I have obtained permission to come to you.'    'You are not mistaken,' replied old Abdallah with a smile, which  showed he did not himself believe she would have acted otherwise,  'nothing is capable of obliging a treacherous person to amend. But  fear nothing. I know the way to make the mischief she intends for  you fall upon herself. You are alarmed in time; and you could not  have done better than to have recourse to me. It is her ordinary  practice to keep her lovers only forty days, and after that time,  instead of sending them home, to turn them into animals, to stock  her forests and parks; but I thought of measures yesterday to  prevent her doing you the same harm. The earth has borne this  monster long enough, and it is now high time she should be treated  as she deserves.'    So saying, Abdallah put two cakes into King Beder's hands, bidding  him keep them to make use of as he should direct. 'You told me,'  continued he, 'the sorceress made a cake last night; it was for you  to eat, depend upon it; but take great care you do not touch it.  Nevertheless, do not refuse to receive it when she offers it you;  but instead of tasting it, break off part of one of the two I shall  give you, unobserved, and eat that. As soon as she thinks you have  swallowed it, she will not fail to attempt"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8642"],[0,"Woman in the Nineteenth Century (#10)"],[1,"her boat. She follows her  lost love to the convent gate, requests an interview with the abbot,  and devotes her Elysian isle, where vines had ripened their ruby fruit  in vain for her, to the service of the monastery where her love was to  serve. Then, passing over to the nunnery opposite, she takes the veil,  and meets her betrothed at the altar; and for a life-long union, if  not the one they had hoped in earlier years.    Is not this sorrowful story of a lofty beauty? Does it not show a  sufficiently high view of Woman, of Marriage? This is commonly the  chivalric, still more the German view.    Yet, wherever there was a balance in the mind of Man, of sentiment  with intellect, such a result was sure. The Greek Xenophon has not  only painted us a sweet picture of the domestic Woman, in his  Economics, but in the Cyropedia has given, in the picture of Panthea,  a view of Woman which no German picture can surpass, whether lonely  and quiet with veiled lids, the temple of a vestal loveliness, or with  eyes flashing, and hair flowing to the free wind, cheering on the hero  to fight for his God, his country, or whatever name his duty might  bear at the time. This picture I shall copy by and by. Yet Xenophon  grew up in the same age with him who makes Iphigenia say to Achilles,      \"Better a thousand women should perish than one man cease to see     the light.\"      This was the vulgar Greek sentiment. Xenophon, aiming at the ideal  Man, caught glimpses of the ideal Woman also. From the figure of a  Cyrus the Pantheas stand not afar. They do not in thought; they would  not in life.    I could swell the catalogue of instances far beyond the reader's  patience. But enough have been brought forward to show that, though  there has been great disparity betwixt the nations as between  individuals in their culture on this point, yet the idea of Woman has  always cast some rays and often been forcibly represented.    Far less has Woman to complain that she has not had her share of  power. This, in all ranks of society, except the lowest, has been hers  to the extent that vanity would crave, far beyond what wisdom would  accept. In the very lowest, where Man, pressed by poverty, sees in  Woman only the partner of toils and cares, and cannot hope, scarcely  has an idea of, a comfortable home, he often maltreats her, and is  less influenced by her. In all ranks, those who are gentle and  uncomplaining, too candid to intrigue, too delicate to encroach,  suffer much. They suffer long, and are kind; verily, they have their  reward. But wherever Man is sufficiently raised above extreme poverty,  or brutal stupidity, to care for the comforts of the fireside, or the  bloom and ornament of life, Woman has always power enough, if she  choose to exert it, and is usually disposed to do so, in proportion to  her ignorance and childish vanity. Unacquainted with the importance of  life and its purposes, trained to a selfish coquetry and love of petty  power, she does not look beyond the pleasure of making herself felt at  the moment, and governments are shaken and commerce broken up to  gratify the pique of a female favorite. The English shopkeeper's wife  does not vote, but it is for her interest that the politician  canvasses by the coarsest flattery. France suffers no woman on her  throne, but her proud nobles kiss the dust at the feet of Pompadour  and Dubarry; for such flare in the lighted foreground where a Roland  would modestly aid in the closet. Spain (that same Spain which sang of  Ximena and the Lady Teresa) shuts up her women in the care of duennas,  and allows them no book but the breviary; but the ruin follows only  the more surely from the worthless favorite of a worthless queen.  Relying on mean precautions, men indeed cry peace, peace, where there  is no peace.    It is not the transient breath of poetic incense that women want; each  can receive that from a lover. It is not life-long sway; it needs but  to become a coquette, a shrew, or a good cook, to be sure of that. It  is not money, nor notoriety, nor the badges of authority which men  have appropriated to themselves. If demands, made in their behalf, lay  stress on any of these particulars, those who make them have not  searched deeply into the need. The want is for that which at once  includes these and precludes them; which would not be forbidden power,  lest there be temptation to steal and misuse it; which would not have  the mind perverted by flattery from a worthiness of esteem; it is for  that which is the birthright of every being capable of receiving  it,--the freedom, the religious, the intelligent freedom of the  universe to use its means, to learn its secret, as far as Nature has  enabled them, with God alone for their guide and their judge.    Ye cannot believe it, men; but the only reason why women over assume  what is more appropriate to you, is because you prevent them from  finding out what is fit for themselves. Were they free, were they wise  fully to develop the strength and beauty of Woman; they would never  wish to be men, or man-like. The well-instructed moon flies not from  her orbit to seize on the glories of her partner. No; for she knows  that one law rules, one heaven contains, one universe replies to them  alike. It is with women as with the slave:      \"Vor dem Sklaven, wenn er die Kette bricht,     Vor dem frelen Menschen erzittert nicht.\"      Tremble not before the free man, but before the slave who has chains  to break.    In slavery, acknowledged slavery, women are on a par with men. Each is  a work-tool, an article of property, no more! In perfect freedom, such  as is painted in Olympus, in Swedenborg's angelic state, in the heaven  where there is no marrying nor giving in marriage, each is a purified  intelligence, an enfranchised soul,--no less.        \"Jene himmlische Gestalten    Sie fragen nicht nach Mann und Welb,      Und keine kielder, keine Falten    Umgeben den verklarten Leib.\"      The child who song this was a prophetic form, expressive of the  longing for a state of perfect freedom, pure love. She could not  remain here, but was translated to another air. And it may be that the  air of this earth will never be so tempered that such can bear it  long. But, while they stay, they must bear testimony to the truth they  are constituted to demand.    That an era approaches which shall approximate nearer to such a temper  than any has yet done, there are many tokens; indeed, so many that  only a few of the most prominent can here be enumerated.    The reigns of Elizabeth of England and Isabella of Castile foreboded  this era. They expressed the beginning of the new state; while they  forwarded its progress. These were strong characters, and in harmony  with the wants of their time. One showed that this strength did not  unfit a woman for the duties of a wife and a mother; the other, that  it could enable her to live and die alone, a wide energetic life, a  courageous death. Elizabeth is certainly no pleasing example. In  rising above the weakness, she did not lay aside the foibles ascribed  to her sex; but her strength must be respected now, as it was in her  own time.    Mary Stuart and Elizabeth seem types, moulded by the spirit of the  time, and placed upon an elevated platform, to show to the coming ages  Woman such as the conduct and wishes of Man in general is likely to  make her. The first shows Woman lovely even to allurement; quick in  apprehension and weak in judgment; with grace and dignity of  sentiment, but no principle; credulous and indiscreet, yet artful;  capable of sudden greatness or of crime, but not of a steadfast  wisdom, nor self-restraining virtue. The second reveals Woman  half-emancipated and jealous of her freedom, such as she has figured  before or since in many a combative attitude, mannish, not equally  manly; strong and prudent more than great or wise; able to control  vanity, and the wish to rule through coquetry and passion, but not to  resign these dear deceits from the very foundation, as unworthy a  being capable of truth and nobleness. Elizabeth, taught by adversity,  put on her virtues as armor, more than produced them in a natural  order from her soul. The time and her position called on her to act  the wise sovereign, and she was proud that she could do so, but her  tastes and inclinations would have led her to act the weak woman. She  was without magnanimity of any kind.    We may accept as an omen for ourselves that it was Isabella who  furnished Columbus with the means of coming hither. This land must pay  back its debt to Woman, without whose aid it would not have been  brought into alliance with the civilized world.    A graceful and meaning figure is that introduced to us by Mr.  Prescott, in the Conquest of Mexico, in the Indian girl Marina, who  accompanied Cortez, and was his interpreter in all the various  difficulties of his career. She stood at his side, on the walls of the  besieged palace, to plead with her enraged countrymen. By her name he  was known in New Spain, and, after the conquest, her gentle  intercession was often of avail to the conquered. The poem of the  Future may be read in some features of the story of \"Malinche.\"    The influence of Elizabeth on literature was real, though, by sympathy  with its finer productions, she was no more entitled to give name to  an era than Queen Anne. It was simply that the fact of having a female  sovereign on the throne affected the course of a writer's thoughts. In  this sense, the presence of a woman on the throne always makes its  mark. Life is lived before the eyes of men, by which their  imaginations are stimulated as to the possibilities of Woman. \"We will  die for our king, Maria, Theresa,\" cry the wild warriors, clashing  their swords; and the sounds vibrate through the poems of that  generation. The range of female character in Spenser alone might  content us for one period. Britomart and Belphoebe have as "]]]
