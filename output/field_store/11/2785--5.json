See II. Peter, chapter iii.    Following up the history of this interesting subject, we find that the  founders of modern Christianity, to which we will refer in our next  article, in composing their version of the New Testament from that of  the Jewish, or ancient Christians, made no change in its verbiage  relative to the prophecies; but when Constantine I., Emperor of Rome,  became the patron of the church, her hierarchy, tired of figuring upon  them, secured a long respite from that troublesome subject by claiming  to have made other calculations, which put off the time of fulfillment  to the year 1000; and from history we learn when the time arrived the  whole of Christendom was fearfully agitated upon the subject: Since  then every generation has been vexed with the fallacies of second  adventism; and the facts of the case justify the charge that the  clergy, by teaching that the prophecies refer to events yet to occur,  are perpetuating a most stupendous fraud upon Christendom, and an  earnest and efficient protest should be inaugurated against the further  agitation of the monstrous delusion of second adventism, which is  frightening thousands of weak-minded people into insanity and causing a  vast amount of social distress.        ROMAN OR MODERN CHRISTIANITY.    Having presented the evidences that the Jewish, or ancient  Christianity, originated at the University of Alexandria, under Greek  rule, we now propose to show that its modern form emanated from the  same source, under Roman rule; but, before entering upon this  investigation, it is important to become conversant with the sentiments  manifested towards religion by the cultured element of Roman society in  that enlightened era, which, designated as the golden age of  literature, was adorned by such distinguished orators, philosophers,  historians, poets and naturalists as Cicero, Tacitus, Pliny, Horace and  Virgil. In reference to this subject, Gibbon, in his history of The  Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol. I., chapter 2, says: \"The  various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all  considered by the people as equally true, by the philosophers as  equally false and by the magistrate as equally useful. Both the  interests of the priests and the credulity of the people were  sufficiently respected. In their writings and conversation the  philosophers of antiquity asserted the independent dignity of reason,  but they resigned their actions to the commands of law and custom.  Viewing with a smile of pity and indulgence the various errors of the  vulgar, they diligently practiced the ceremonies of their fathers,  devoutly frequented the temples of the gods, and sometimes  condescending to act a part on the theatre of superstition, they  concealed the sentiments of an atheist under the sacerdotal robe.  Reasoners of such a temper were scarcely inclined to wrangle about  their respective modes of faith or of worship. It was indifferent to  them what shape the folly of the multitude might choose to assume, and  they approached with the same inward contempt and the same external  reverence to the altars of the Lybian, the Olympian or the Capitoline  Jupiter.\" Upon the same subject Mosheim, in his church history, Book  I., chapter 1, says that \"The wiser part of mankind, about the time of  Christ's birth, looked upon the whole system of religion as a just  object of contempt and ridicule.\"    In determining why such adverse sentiments were entertained towards  religion by \"the wiser part of mankind,\" about the time referred to in  the foregoing quotations, it will be found to have been owing to the  extensive spread of the Esoteric philosophy, which taught, as  previously stated, that the gods were mythical and the scriptures  allegorical. While attainable only through initiation, it was  necessarily confined to a limited number, but, ultimately getting  beyond the control of the priests and vast numbers acquiring the  knowledge of its secrets without initiation, it became evident that it  was but a question of time when there would be no respectable element  left to sustain religion. At this juncture our attention is directed to  the University of Alexandria, which, at that time, was in a flourishing  condition. Having ceased to be an exclusively Jewish school, students  from all parts of the Roman Empire, without regard to nationality, were  attending it, and its professors were drawn from the ranks of both  Jewish and Gentile scholars. Realizing the hopelessness of reviving the  ancient faith among the enlightened clement of society, and the  impossibility of proselyting them to a new form of superstition, these  professors resolved to institute a system of worship exclusively for  the Jews and the lower and neglected classes of Gentiles, including the  slaves and criminals. To that end they rewrote the scriptures of the  Jewish or ancient Christianity, which had been preserved among the  secret archives of the University. Retaining their teachings relative  to the finale of the plan of redemption, and its monasticism; also the  land of Judea as the scene of its version of the Gospel story, and the  name of its saviour, to which they added the Latin terminal \"us,\" thus  making it Iesus or Jesus, they perpetuated the Greek name of  Bacchus--the same that was ultimately perverted into the monogram  which, consisting of the Roman letters I. H. S., is found in all  Catholic churches, and in some Protestant ones, is falsely supposed to  stand for Jesus Hominum Salvator, or Jesus, Saviour of Men. Conforming  their version of the Gospel story to the lowly condition of its  expected votaries, they attached to the saviour the characteristics of  poverty, and made it teach that he was born in a manger, that his  disciples were but humble fishermen and that the poor would be the only  elect in the kingdom of heaven. Dropping the name of Essenes or  Therapeutae, and retaining that of Christian, they incorporated a  thread of real history corresponding to the reign of Augustus, and  arbitrarily made the Christian era begin at that time. Having thus  completed their scheme, they prudently destroyed the original from  which they compiled their scriptures, and sending out missionaries to  all parts of the Empire commissioned them to preach salvation only to  the Gentile rabblement and to the Jews.    That the sacred records of the ancient Essenes or Therapeutae  constituted the basis of the scriptures of modern Christianity we have  the authority of Eusebius, the church historian of the fourth century,  from whom we learn nearly all that is reliable of its history during  the first three centuries.  In his Ecclesiastical History, Book II.  chapter 17, he makes the important admission that \"Those ancient  Therapeutae were Christians, and that their writtings are our Gospels  and Epistles.\" As further evidence that modern Christianity is but a  survival of the Eclectic philosophy of the ancient Therapeutae, we have  another important admission by the same historian, who, in quoting from  an apology addressed to the Roman Emperor, Marcus Antoninus, in the  year 171, by Melito, Bishop of Sardis, in Lydia, a province of Asia  Minor, makes that apologist say, in reference to certain grievances to  which the Christians were subjected, that \"the philosophy which we  profess truly flourished aforetime among the barbarous nations; but  having blossomed again in the great reign of thy ancestor, Augustus, it  proved to be, above all things, ominous of good fortune to thy  kingdom.\" Thus we have indubitable evidence that it was the Eclectic  philosophy of the Jewish, or ancient Christianity, which \"blossomed  again,\" in its modern form, during the reign of Augustus.    From the testimony of Philo, as referred to by Eusebius, and from the  writings of Josephus, the Jewish historian, we learn that, at the  beginning of our era, the descendants of the ancient Essenes were still  observing the practices and customs of monasticism. But as Josephus  refers to them only as descendants of the ancient Essenes, and makes no  mention of Christ or Christians--except in one paragraph which has been  conceded by the best authorities to be an interpolation it is evident  that, at that time, they had no connection with the University of  Alexandria, and nothing whatever to do with the institution of modern  Christianity. It is also apparent that the Jews of Judea had no hand in  its organization, for, if they had instituted it, they would not have  attached to the Messiah the Greek title signifying the Christ, but,  writing their version of the Gospel story in their own dialect, would  have used the Hebrew word signifying the Shiloh (see Gen. xlix. 10);  and furthermore, having conceived the idea that he would manifest  himself as a great temporal prince, who would re-establish the throne  of David, and deliver them from the oppression of foreign rulers, they  would not have attached to him the humble characteristics of the Christ  of the new Testament. Again, if they had been the authors of modern  Christianity, it would have been a most surprising inconsistency for  them to turn right about and reject its conceptions of a savior,  especially when that rejection resulted in the dire persecutions to  which their race has ever been subjected by the Christians. But the  Gentile riffraff, attracted by the gracious promises of enjoying in the  world to come the felicities denied them in this, eagerly attached  themselves to the new sect, which rapidly increased in numbers, and its  votaries, glorying in the opprobrious epithet of Ebionites, or needy  ones, made themselves so obnoxious by their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8866"],[0,"Wild Flowers Worth Knowing (#10)"],[1,"corn, and anemone for the honor of  being the earliest wild flower; and although John Burroughs and Doctor  Abbot have had the exceptional experience of finding the claytonia even  before the hepatica--certainly the earliest spring blossom worthy the  name in the Middle and New England states--of course the rank Skunk  Cabbage, whose name is snobbishly excluded from the list of fair  competitors, has quietly opened dozens of minute florets in its incurved  horn before the others have even started.          WATER-LILY FAMILY _(Nymphaeaceae)_    Large Yellow Pond, or Water, Lily; Cow Lily; Spatterdock    _Nymphaea advena (Nuphar advena)_    _Flowers_--Yellow or greenish outside, rarely purple tinged, round,  depressed, 1-1/2 to 3-1/2 in. across. Sepals 6, unequal, concave, thick,  fleshy; petals stamen-like, oblong, fleshy, short; stamens very  numerous, in 5 to 7 rows; pistil compounded of many carpels, its  stigmatic disc pale red or yellow, with 12 to 24 rays. _Leaves:_  Floating, or some immersed, large, thick, sometimes a foot long,  egg-shaped or oval, with a deep cleft at base, the lobes rounded.    _Preferred Habitat_--Standing water, ponds, slow streams.    _Flowering Season_--April-September.    _Distribution_--Rocky Mountains eastward, south to the Gulf of Mexico,  north to Nova Scotia.    Comparisons were ever odious. Because the Yellow Water-lily has the  misfortune to claim relationship with the sweet-scented white species  must it never receive its just meed of praise? Hiawatha's canoe, let it  be remembered,          \"Floated on the river    Like a yellow leaf in autumn,    Like a yellow water-lily.\"    But even those who admire Longfellow's lines see less beauty in the  golden flower-bowls floating among the large, lustrous, leathery leaves.      Sweet-scented White Water-lily; Pond Lily; Water Nymph; Water  Cabbage    _Castalia odorata (Nymphaea odorata)_    _Flowers_--Pure white or pink tinged, rarely deep pink, solitary, 3 to 8  in. across, deliciously fragrant, floating. Calyx of 4 sepals, green  outside; petals of indefinite number, overlapping in many rows, and  gradually passing into an indefinite number of stamens; outer row of  stamens with petaloid filaments and short anthers, the inner yellow  stamens with slender filaments and elongated anthers; carpels of  indefinite number, united into a compound pistil, with spreading and  projecting stigmas. _Leaves_: Floating, nearly round, slit at bottom,  shining green above, reddish and more or less hairy below, 4 to 12 in.  across, attached to petiole at centre of lower surface. Petioles and  peduncles round and rubber-like, with 4 main air-channels. _Rootstock_:  (Not true stem) thick, simple or with few branches, very long.    _Preferred Habitat_--Still water, ponds, lakes, slow streams.    _Flowering Season--_June-September.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to Gulf of Mexico, and westward to the  Mississippi.    Sumptuous queen of our native aquatic plants, of the royal family to  which the gigantic _Victoria regia_ of Brazil belongs, and all the  lovely rose, lavender, blue, and golden exotic water-lilies in the  fountains of our city parks, to her man, beast, and insect pay grateful  homage. In Egypt, India, China, Japan, Persia, and Asiatic Russia, how  many millions have bent their heads in adoration of her relative the  sacred lotus! From its centre Brahma came forth; Buddha, too, whose  symbol is the lotus, first appeared floating on the mystic flower  _(Nelumbo nelumbo)_. Happily the lovely pink or white \"sacred bean\" or  \"rose-lily\" of the Nile, often cultivated here, has been successfully  naturalized in ponds about Bordentown, New Jersey, and may be elsewhere.  If he who planteth a tree is greater than he who taketh a city, that man  should be canonized who introduces the magnificent wild flowers of  foreign lands to our area of Nature's garden.          CROWFOOT FAMILY _(Ranunculaceae)_    Common Meadow Buttercup; Tall Crowfoot; Kingcups; Cuckoo Flower;  Goldcups; Butter-flowers; Blister-flowers    _Ranunculus acris_    _Flowers_--Bright, shining yellow, about 1 in. across, numerous,  terminating long slender footstalks. Calyx of 5 spreading sepals;  corolla of 5 petals; yellow stamens and carpels. _Stem:_ Erect, branched  above, hairy (sometimes nearly smooth), 2 to 3 feet tall, from fibrous  roots. _Leaves:_ In a tuft from the base, long petioled, of 3 to 7  divisions cleft into numerous lobes; stem leaves nearly sessile,  distant, 3-parted.    _Preferred Habitat_--Meadows, fields, roadsides, grassy places.    _Flowering Season_--May-September.    _Distribution_--Naturalized from Europe in Canada and the United States;  most common North.    What youngster has not held these shining golden flowers under his chin  to test his fondness for butter? Dandelions and Marsh Marigolds may  reflect their color in his clear skin, too, but the buttercup is every  child's favorite. When      \"Cuckoo-buds of yellow hue    Do paint the meadows with delight,\"    daisies, pink clover, and waving timothy bear them company here; not  the \"daisies pied,\" violets, and lady-smocks of Shakespeare's England.  How incomparably beautiful are our own meadows in June! But the glitter  of the buttercup, which is as nothing to the glitter of a gold dollar in  the eyes of a practical farmer, fills him with wrath when this immigrant  takes possession of his pastures. Cattle will not eat the acrid, caustic  plant--a sufficient reason for most members of the _Ranunculaceae_ to  stoop to the low trick of secreting poisonous or bitter juices.  Self-preservation leads a cousin, the garden monk's hood, even to  murderous practices. Since children will put everything within reach  into their mouths, they should be warned against biting the buttercup's  stem and leaves, that are capable of raising blisters. \"Beggars use the  juice to produce sores upon their skin,\" says Mrs. Creevy. A designer  might employ these exquisitely formed leaves far more profitably.    By having its nourishment thriftily stored up underground all winter,  the Bulbous Buttercup _(R. bulbosus)_ is able to steal a march on its  fibrous-rooted sister that must accumulate hers all spring; consequently  it is first to flower, coming in early May, and lasting through June. It  is a low and generally more hairy plant, but closely resembling the tall  buttercup in most respects, and, like it, a naturalized European  immigrant now thoroughly at home in fields and roadsides in most  sections of the United States and Canada.    Commonest of the early buttercups is the Tufted species _(R.  fascicularis)_, a little plant seldom a foot high, found in the woods  and on rocky hillsides from Texas and Manitoba east to the Atlantic,  flowering in April or May. The long-stalked leaves are divided into  from three to five parts; the bright yellow flowers, with rather narrow,  distant petals, measure about an inch across. They open sparingly,  usually only one or two at a time on each plant, to favor pollination  from another one.    Scattered patches of the Swamp or Marsh Buttercup _(R. septentrionalis)_  brighten low, rich meadows also with their large satiny yellow flowers,  whose place in the botany even the untrained eye knows at sight. The  smooth, spreading plant sometimes takes root at the joints of its  branches and sends forth runners, but the stems mostly ascend. The large  lower mottled leaves are raised well out of the wet, or above the grass,  on long petioles. They have three divisions, each lobed and cleft. From  Georgia and Kentucky far northward this buttercup blooms from April to  July, opening only a few flowers at a time--a method which may make it  less showy, but more certain to secure cross-pollination between  distinct plants.      Tall Meadow-rue    _Thalictrum polygamum (T. Cornuti)_    _Flowers_--Greenish white, the calyx of 4 or 5 sepals, falling early; no  petals; numerous white, thread-like, green-tipped stamens, spreading in  feathery tufts, borne in large, loose, compound terminal clusters 1 ft.  long or more. _Stem_: Stout, erect, 3 to 11 ft. high, leafy, branching  above. _Leaves_: Arranged in threes, compounded of various shaped  leaflets, the lobes pointed or rounded, dark above, paler below.    _Preferred Habitat_--Open sunny swamps, beside sluggish water,  low meadows.    _Flowering Season_--July-September    _Distribution_--Quebec to Florida, westward to Ohio.    Masses of these soft, feathery flowers, towering above the ranker growth  of midsummer, possess an unseasonable, ethereal, chaste, spring-like  beauty. On some plants the flowers are fleecy white and exquisite;  others, again, are dull and coarser. Why is this? Because these are what  botanists term polygamous flowers, _i.e._, some of them are perfect,  containing both stamens and pistils; some are male only; others, again,  are female. Naturally an insect, like ourselves, is first attracted to  the more beautiful male blossoms, the pollen bearers, and of course it  transfers the vitalizing dust to the dull pistillate flowers visited  later. But the meadow-rue, which produces a super-abundance of very  light, dry pollen, easily blown by the wind, is often fertilized through  that agent also, just as grasses, plantains, sedges, birches, oaks,  pines, and all cone-bearing trees are. As might be expected, a plant  which has not yet ascended the evolutionary scale high enough to  economize its pollen by making insects carry it invariably overtops  surrounding vegetation to take advantage of every breeze that blows.           *       *       *       *       *    The Early Meadow-rue (_T. dioicum_), found blooming in open, rocky woods  during April and May, from Alabama northward to Labrador, and westward  to Missouri, grows only one or two feet high, and, like its tall sister,  bears fleecy, greenish-white flowers, the staminate and the pistillate  ones on different plants.
