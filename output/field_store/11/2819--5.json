His  expedition, which left Copenhagen in 1761, lasted six years. During this  period all of the members died except one, by the name of Karsten  Niebuhr, who had begun life as a German peasant and could stand greater  hardships than the professors who had spent their days amidst the stuffy  books of their libraries.    This Niebuhr, who was a surveyor by profession, was a young man who  deserves our admiration.    He continued his voyage all alone until he reached the ruins of  Persepolis where he spent a month copying every inscription that was to  be found upon the walls of the ruined palaces and temples.    After his return to Denmark he published his discoveries for the benefit  of the scientific world and seriously tried to read some meaning into  his own texts.    He was not successful.    But this does not astonish us when we understand the difficulties which  he was obliged to solve.    When Champollion tackled the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics he was able  to make his studies from little pictures.    The writing of Persepolis did not show any pictures at all.    They consisted of v-shaped figures that were repeated endlessly and  suggested nothing at all to the European eye.    Nowadays, when the puzzle has been solved we know that the original  script of the Sumerians had been a picture-language, quite as much as  that of the Egyptians.    But whereas the Egyptians at a very early date had discovered the  papyrus plant and had been able to paint their images upon a smooth  surface, the inhabitants of Mesopotamia had been forced to carve their  words into the hard rock of a mountain side or into a soft brick  of clay.    [Illustration: THE ROCKS OF BEHISTUN.]    Driven by necessity they had gradually simplified the original pictures  until they devised a system of more than five hundred different  letter-combinations which were necessary for their needs.    Let me give you a few examples. In the beginning, a star, when drawn  with a nail into a brick looked as follows. [Illustration: Star]    But after a time the star shape was discarded as being too cumbersome  and the figure was given this shape. [Illustration: Asterisk]    After a while the meaning of \"heaven\" was added to that of \"star,\" and  the picture was simplified in this way [Illustration: Odd Cross] which  made it still more of a puzzle.    In the same way an ox changed from [Illustration: Ox Head] into  [Illustration: Pattern]    A fish changed from [Illustration: Fish] into [Illustration: Fish  Scales] The sun, which was originally a plain circle, became  [Illustration: Diamond] and if we were using the Sumerian script today  we would make an [Illustration: Bike] look like this [Illustration:  Pattern].    You will understand how difficult it was to guess at the meaning of  these figures but the patient labors of a German schoolmaster by the  name of Grotefend was at last rewarded and thirty years after the first  publication of Niebuhr's texts and three centuries after the first  discovery of the wedge-formed pictures, four letters had been  deciphered.    These four letters were the D, the A, the R and the Sh.    They formed the name of Darheush the King, whom we call Darius.    Then occurred one of those events which were only possible in those  happy days before the telegraph-wire and the mail-steamer had turned the  entire world into one large city.    While patient European professors were burning the midnight candles in  their attempt to solve the new Asiatic mystery, young Henry Rawlinson  was serving his time as a cadet of the British East Indian Company.    He used his spare hours to learn Persian and when the Shah of Persia  asked the English government for the loan of a few officers to train his  native army, Rawlinson was ordered to go to Teheran. He travelled all  over Persia and one day he happened to visit the village of Behistun.  The Persians called it Bagistana which means the \"dwellingplace of  the Gods.\"    Centuries before the main road from Mesopotamia to Iran (the early home  of the Persians) had run through this village and the Persian King  Darius had used the steep walls of the high cliffs to tell all the world  what a great man he was.    High above the roadside he had engraved an account of his glorious  deeds.    The inscription had been made in the Persian language, in Babylonian and  in the dialect of the city of Susa. To make the story plain to those who  could not read at all, a fine piece of sculpture had been added showing  the King of Persia placing his triumphant foot upon the body of Gaumata,  the usurper who had tried to steal the throne away from the legitimate  rulers. For good measure a dozen followers of Gaumata had been added.  They stood in the background. Their hands were tied and they were to be  executed in a few moments.    The picture and the three texts were several hundred feet above the road  but Rawlinson scaled the walls of the rock at great danger to life and  limb and copied the entire text.    His discovery was of the greatest importance. The Rock of Behistun  became as famous as the Stone of Rosetta and Rawlinson shared the honors  of deciphering the old nail-writing with Grotefend.    Although they had never seen each other or heard each other's names, the  German schoolmaster and the British officer worked together for a common  purpose as all good scientific men should do.    Their copies of the old text were reprinted in every land and by the  middle of the nineteenth century, the cuneiform language (so called  because the letters were wedge-shaped and \"cuneus\" is the Latin name for  wedge) had given up its secrets. Another human mystery had been solved.    [Illustration: A TOWER OF BABEL.]    But about the people who had invented this clever way of writing, we  have never been able to learn very much.    They were a white race and they were called the Sumerians.    They lived in a land which we call Shomer and which they themselves  called Kengi, which means the \"country of the reeds\" and which shows us  that they had dwelt among the marshy parts of the Mesopotamian valley.  Originally the Sumerians had been mountaineers, but the fertile fields  had tempted them away from the hills. But while they had left their  ancient homes amidst the peaks of western Asia they had not given up  their old habits and one of these is of particular interest to us.    Living amidst the peaks of western Asia, they had worshipped their Gods  upon altars erected on the tops of rocks. In their new home, among the  flat plains, there were no such rocks and it was impossible to construct  their shrines in the old fashion. The Sumerians did not like this.    All Asiatic people have a deep respect for tradition and the Sumerian  tradition demanded that an altar be plainly visible for miles around.    To overcome this difficulty and keep their peace with the Gods of their  Fathers, the Sumerians had built a number of low towers (resembling  little hills) on the top of which they had lighted their sacred fires in  honor of the old divinities.    When the Jews visited the town of Bab-Illi (which we call Babylon) many  centuries after the last of the Sumerians had died, they had been much  impressed by the strange-looking towers which stood high amidst the  green fields of Mesopotamia. The Tower of Babel of which we hear so much  in the Old Testament was nothing but the ruin of an artificial peak,  built hundreds of years before by a band of devout Sumerians. It was a  curious contraption.    The Sumerians had not known how to construct stairs.    They had surrounded their tower with a sloping gallery which slowly  carried people from the bottom to the top.    A few years ago it was found necessary to build a new railroad station  in the heart of New York City in such a way that thousands of travelers  could be brought from the lower to the higher levels at the same moment.    It was not thought safe to use a staircase for in case of a rush or a  panic people might have tumbled and that would have meant a terrible  catastrophe.    To solve their problem the engineers borrowed an idea from the  Sumerians.    And the Grand Central Station is provided with the same ascending  galleries which had first been introduced into the plains of  Mesopotamia, three thousand years ago.        ASSYRIA AND BABYLONIA--THE GREAT SEMITIC MELTING-POT    We often call America the \"Melting-pot.\" When we use this term we mean  that many races from all over the earth have gathered along the banks of  the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans to find a new home and begin a new  career amidst more favorable surroundings than were to be found in the  country of their birth. It is true, Mesopotamia was much smaller than  our own country. But the fertile valley was the most extraordinary  \"melting-pot\" the world has ever seen and it continued to absorb new  tribes for almost two thousand years. The story of each new people,  clamoring for homesteads along the banks of the Tigris and the Euphrates  is interesting in itself but we can give you only a very short record of  their adventures.    [Illustration: HAMMURAPI.]    The Sumerians whom we met in the previous chapter, scratching their  history upon rocks and bits of clay (and who did not belong to the  Semitic race) had been the first nomads to wander into Mesopotamia.  Nomads are people who have no settled homes and no grain fields and no  vegetable gardens but who live in tents and keep sheep and goats and  cows and who move from pasture to pasture, taking their flocks and their  tents wherever the grass is green and the water abundant.    Far and wide their mud huts had covered the plains. They were good  fighters and for a long time they were able to hold their own against  all invaders.

And the  moon rose, showing the gardens, apparently empty, and silent. And so,  through the night, without disturbance or sound.    Toward morning, I began to grow stiff and cold, with my long vigil;  also, I was getting very uneasy, concerning the continued quietness on  the part of the creatures. I mistrusted it, and would sooner, far, have  had them attack the house, openly. Then, at least, I should have known  my danger, and been able to meet it; but to wait like this, through a  whole night, picturing all kinds of unknown devilment, was to jeopardize  one's sanity. Once or twice, the thought came to me, that, perhaps, they  had gone; but, in my heart, I found it impossible to believe that it  was so.        _IX_    IN THE CELLARS    At last, what with being tired and cold, and the uneasiness that  possessed me, I resolved to take a walk through the house; first calling  in at the study, for a glass of brandy to warm me. This, I did, and,  while there, I examined the door, carefully; but found all as I had left  it the night before.    The day was just breaking, as I left the tower; though it was still too  dark in the house to be able to see without a light, and I took one of  the study candles with me on my 'round. By the time I had finished the  ground floor, the daylight was creeping in, wanly, through the barred  windows. My search had shown me nothing fresh. Everything appeared to be  in order, and I was on the point of extinguishing my candle, when the  thought suggested itself to me to have another glance 'round the  cellars. I had not, if I remember rightly, been into them since my hasty  search on the evening of the attack.    For, perhaps, the half of a minute, I hesitated. I would have been very  willing to forego the task--as, indeed, I am inclined to think any man  well might--for of all the great, awe-inspiring rooms in this house, the  cellars are the hugest and weirdest. Great, gloomy caverns of places,  unlit by any ray of daylight. Yet, I would not shirk the work. I felt  that to do so would smack of sheer cowardice. Besides, as I reassured  myself, the cellars were really the most unlikely places in which to  come across anything dangerous; considering that they can be entered,  only through a heavy oaken door, the key of which, I carry always on  my person.    It is in the smallest of these places that I keep my wine; a gloomy  hole close to the foot of the cellar stairs; and beyond which, I have  seldom proceeded. Indeed, save for the rummage 'round, already  mentioned, I doubt whether I had ever, before, been right through  the cellars.    As I unlocked the great door, at the top of the steps, I paused,  nervously, a moment, at the strange, desolate smell that assailed my  nostrils. Then, throwing the barrel of my weapon forward, I descended,  slowly, into the darkness of the underground regions.    Reaching the bottom of the stairs, I stood for a minute, and listened.  All was silent, save for a faint drip, drip of water, falling,  drop-by-drop, somewhere to my left. As I stood, I noticed how quietly  the candle burnt; never a flicker nor flare, so utterly windless was  the place.    Quietly, I moved from cellar to cellar. I had but a very dim memory of  their arrangement. The impressions left by my first search were blurred.  I had recollections of a succession of great cellars, and of one,  greater than the rest, the roof of which was upheld by pillars; beyond  that my mind was hazy, and predominated by a sense of cold and darkness  and shadows. Now, however, it was different; for, although nervous, I  was sufficiently collected to be able to look about me, and note the  structure and size of the different vaults I entered.    Of course, with the amount of light given by my candle, it was not  possible to examine each place, minutely, but I was enabled to notice,  as I went along, that the walls appeared to be built with wonderful  precision and finish; while here and there, an occasional, massive  pillar shot up to support the vaulted roof.    Thus, I came, at last, to the great cellar that I remembered. It is  reached, through a huge, arched entrance, on which I observed strange,  fantastic carvings, which threw queer shadows under the light of my  candle. As I stood, and examined these, thoughtfully, it occurred to me  how strange it was, that I should be so little acquainted with my own  house. Yet, this may be easily understood, when one realizes the size of  this ancient pile, and the fact that only my old sister and I live in  it, occupying a few of the rooms, such as our wants decide.    Holding the light high, I passed on into the cellar, and, keeping to  the right, paced slowly up, until I reached the further end. I walked  quietly, and looked cautiously about, as I went. But, so far as the  light showed, I saw nothing unusual.    At the top, I turned to the left, still keeping to the wall, and so  continued, until I had traversed the whole of the vast chamber. As I  moved along, I noticed that the floor was composed of solid rock, in  places covered with a damp mould, in others bare, or almost so, save for  a thin coating of light-grey dust.    I had halted at the doorway. Now, however, I turned, and made my way up  the center of the place; passing among the pillars, and glancing to  right and left, as I moved. About halfway up the cellar, I stubbed my  foot against something that gave out a metallic sound. Stooping quickly,  I held the candle, and saw that the object I had kicked, was a large,  metal ring. Bending lower, I cleared the dust from around it, and,  presently, discovered that it was attached to a ponderous trap door,  black with age.    Feeling excited, and wondering to where it could lead, I laid my gun on  the floor, and, sticking the candle in the trigger guard, took the ring  in both hands, and pulled. The trap creaked loudly--the sound echoing,  vaguely, through the huge place--and opened, heavily.    Propping the edge on my knee, I reached for the candle, and held it in  the opening, moving it to right and left; but could see nothing. I was  puzzled and surprised. There were no signs of steps, nor even the  appearance of there ever having been any. Nothing; save an empty  blackness. I might have been looking down into a bottomless, sideless  well. Then, even as I stared, full of perplexity, I seemed to hear, far  down, as though from untold depths, a faint whisper of sound. I bent my  head, quickly, more into the opening, and listened, intently. It may  have been fancy; but I could have sworn to hearing a soft titter, that  grew into a hideous, chuckling, faint and distant. Startled, I leapt  backward, letting the trap fall, with a hollow clang, that filled the  place with echoes. Even then, I seemed to hear that mocking, suggestive  laughter; but this, I knew, must be my imagination. The sound, I had  heard, was far too slight to penetrate through the cumbrous trap.    For a full minute, I stood there, quivering--glancing, nervously,  behind and before; but the great cellar was silent as a grave, and,  gradually, I shook off the frightened sensation. With a calmer mind, I  became again curious to know into what that trap opened; but could not,  then, summon sufficient courage to make a further investigation. One  thing I felt, however, was that the trap ought to be secured. This, I  accomplished by placing upon it several large pieces of 'dressed'  stone, which I had noticed in my tour along the East wall.    Then, after a final scrutiny of the rest of the place, I retraced my  way through the cellars, to the stairs, and so reached the daylight,  with an infinite feeling of relief, that the uncomfortable task was  accomplished.        _X_    THE TIME OF WAITING    The sun was now warm, and shining brightly, forming a wondrous contrast  to the dark and dismal cellars; and it was with comparatively light  feelings, that I made my way up to the tower, to survey the gardens.  There, I found everything quiet, and, after a few minutes, went down to  Mary's room.    Here, having knocked, and received a reply, I unlocked the door. My  sister was sitting, quietly, on the bed; as though waiting. She seemed  quite herself again, and made no attempt to move away, as I approached;  yet, I observed that she scanned my face, anxiously, as though in doubt,  and but half assured in her mind that there was nothing to fear from me.    To my questions, as to how she felt, she replied, sanely enough, that  she was hungry, and would like to go down to prepare breakfast, if I did  not mind. For a minute, I meditated whether it would be safe to let her  out. Finally, I told her she might go, on condition that she promised  not to attempt to leave the house, or meddle with any of the outer  doors. At my mention of the doors, a sudden look of fright crossed her  face; but she said nothing, save to give the required promise, and then  left the room, silently.    Crossing the floor, I approached Pepper. He had waked as I entered;  but, beyond a slight yelp of pleasure, and a soft rapping with his tail,  had kept quiet. Now, as I patted him, he made an attempt to stand up,  and succeeded, only to fall back on his side, with a little yowl  of pain.    I spoke to him, and bade him lie still. I was greatly delighted with  his improvement, and also with the natural kindness of my sister's  heart, in taking such good care of him, in spite of her condition of  mind. After a while, I left him, and went downstairs, to my study.    In a little time, Mary appeared, carrying a tray on which smoked a hot  breakfast. As she entered the room, I saw her gaze fasten on the props  that supported the study door; her lips tightened, and I thought she  paled, slightly; but that was all. Putting the tray down at my elbow,  she was leaving the room, quietly, when I called her back. She came, it  seemed, a little timidly, as though startled; and I noted that her"]]]
