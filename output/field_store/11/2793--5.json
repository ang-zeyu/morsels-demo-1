Unclassified reactions, mostly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9173"],[0,"Youth: Its Education, Regimen, and Hygiene (#10)"],[1,"months before the receiving rate, which may fall  short. Curves 1 and 2 represent the same student. I have added line 3  to illustrate the three-fourths who fail. Receiving is far less  pleasant than sending, and years of daily practise at ordinary rates  will not bring a man to his maximum rate; he remains on the low  plateau with no progress beyond a certain point. If forced by stress  of work, danger of being dropped, or by will power to make a prolonged  and intense effort, he breaks through his hidebound rate and  permanently attains a faster pace. This is true at each step, and  every advance seems to cost even more intensive effort than the former  one. At length, for those who go on, the rate of receiving, which is a  more complex process, exceeds that of sending; and the curves of the  above figure would cross if prolonged. The expert receives so much  faster than he sends that abbreviated codes are used, and he may take  eighty to eighty-five words a minute on a typewriter in correct form.    [Illustration: Letters per Minute x Weeks of Practice.]    The motor curve seems to asymptotically approach a perhaps  physiological limit, which the receiving curve does not suggest. This  seems a special case of a general though not yet explained law. In  learning a foreign language, speaking is first and easiest, and  hearing takes a late but often sudden start to independence. Perhaps  this holds of every ability. To Bryan this suggests as a hierarchy of  habits, the plateau of little or no improvement, meaning that lower  order habits are approaching their maximum but are not yet automatic  enough to leave the attention free to attack higher order habits. The  second ascent from drudgery to freedom, which comes through  automatism, is often as sudden as the first ascent. One stroke of  attention comes to do what once took many. To attain such effective  speed is not dependent on reaction time. This shooting together of  units distinguishes the master from the man, the genius from the hack.  In many, if not all, skills where expertness is sought, there is a  long discouraging level, and then for the best a sudden ascent, as if  here, too, as we have reason to think in the growth of both the body  as a whole and in that of its parts, nature does make leaps and  attains her ends by alternate rests and rushes. Youth lives along on a  low level of interest and accomplishment and then starts onward, is  transformed, converted; the hard becomes easy; the old life sinks to a  lower stratum; and a new and higher order, perhaps a higher brain  level and functions, is evolved. The practical implication here of the  necessity of hard concentrative effort as a condition of advancement  is re-enforced by a quotation from Senator Stanford on the effect of  early and rather intensive work at not too long periods in training  colts for racing. Let-ups are especially dangerous. He says, \"It is  the supreme effort that develops.\" This, I may add, suggests what is  developed elsewhere, that truly spontaneous attention is conditioned  by spontaneous muscle tension, which is a function of growth, and that  muscles are thus organs of the mind; and also that even voluntary  attention is motivated by the same nisus of development even in its  most adult form, and that the products of science, invention,  discovery, as well as the association plexus of all that was  originally determined in the form of consciousness, are made by  rhythmic alternation of attack, as it moves from point to point  creating diversions and recurrence.    The other study, although quite independent, is part a special  application and illustration of the same principle.    At the age of four or five, when they can do little more than  scribble, children's chief interest in pictures is as finished  products; but in the second period, which Lange calls that of artistic  illusion, the child sees in his own work not merely what it  represents, but an image of fancy back of it. This, then, is the  golden period for the development of power to create artistically. The  child loves to draw everything with the pleasure chiefly in the act,  and he cares little for the finished picture. He draws out of his own  head, and not from copy before his eye. Anything and everything is  attempted in bold lines in this golden age of drawing. If he followed  the teacher, looked carefully and drew what he saw, he would be  abashed at his production. Indians, conflagrations, games, brownies,  trains, pageants, battles--everything is graphically portrayed; but  only the little artist himself sees the full meaning of his lines.  Criticism or drawing strictly after nature breaks this charm, since it  gives place to mechanical reproduction in which the child has little  interest. Thus awakens him from his dream to a realization that he can  not draw, and from ten to fifteen his power of perceiving things  steadily increases and he makes almost no progress in drawing.  Adolescence arouses the creative faculty and the desire and ability to  draw are checked and decline after thirteen or fourteen. The curve is  the plateau which Barnes has described. The child has measured his own  productions upon the object they reproduced and found them wanting, is  discouraged and dislikes drawing. From twelve on, Barnes found drawing  more and more distasteful; and this, too, Lukens found to be the  opinion of our art teachers. The pupils may draw very properly and  improve in technique, but the interest is gone. This is the condition  in which most men remain all their lives. Their power to appreciate  steadily increases. Only a few gifted adolescents about this age begin  a to develop a new zest in production, rivaling that of the period  from five to ten, when their satisfaction is again chiefly in  creation. These are the artists whose active powers dominate.    Lukens[3] finds in his studies of drawing, that in what he calls his  fourth period of artistic development, there are those \"who during  adolescence experience a rebirth of creative power.\" Zest in creation  then often becomes a stronger incentive to work than any pleasure or  profit to be derived from the finished product, so that in this the  propitious conditions of the first golden age of childhood are  repeated and the deepest satisfaction is again found in the work  itself. At about fourteen or fifteen, which is the transition period,  nascent faculties sometimes develop very rapidly. Lukens[4] draws the  interesting curve shown on the following page.    [Illustration: Motor, creative or productive power. Sensory or  receptive interest in the finished product.]    The reciprocity between the power to produce and that to appreciate,  roughly represented in the above curve, likely is true also in the  domain of music, and may be, perhaps, a general law of development.  Certain it is that the adolescent power to apperceive and appreciate  never so far outstrips his power to produce or reproduce as about  midway in the teens. Now impressions sink deepest. The greatest  artists are usually those who paint later, when the expressive powers  are developed, what they have felt most deeply and known best at this  age, and not those who in the late twenties, or still later, have gone  to new environments and sought to depict them. All young people draw  best those objects they love most, and their proficiency should be  some test of the contents of their minds. They must put their own  consciousness into a picture. At the dawn of this stage of  appreciation the esthetic tastes should be stimulated by exposure to,  and instructed in feeling for, the subject-matter of masterpieces; and  instruction in technique, detail, criticism, and learned  discrimination of schools of painting should be given intermittently.  Art should not now be for art's sake, but for the sake of feeling and  character, life, and conduct; it should be adjunct to morals, history,  and literature; and in all, edification should be the goal; and  personal interest, and not that of the teacher, should be the guide.  Insistence on production should be eased, and the receptive  imagination, now so hungry, should be fed and reinforced by story and  all other accessories. By such a curriculum, potential creativeness,  if it exists, will surely be evoked in its own good time. It will, at  first, attempt no commonplace drawing-master themes, but will essay  the highest that the imagination can bode forth. It may be crude and  lame in execution, but it will be lofty, perhaps grand; and if it is  original in consciousness, it will be in effect. Most creative  painters before twenty have grappled with the greatest scenes in  literature or turning points in history, representations of the  loftiest truths, embodiments of the most inspiring ideals. None who  deserve the name of artist copy anything now, and least of all with  objective fidelity to nature; and the teacher that represses or  criticizes this first point of genius, or who can not pardon the grave  faults of technique inevitable at this age when ambition ought to be  too great for power, is not an educator but a repressor, a pedagogic  Philistine committing, like so many of his calling in other fields,  the unpardonable sin against budding promise, always at this age so  easily blighted. Just as the child of six or seven should be  encouraged in his strong instinct to draw the most complex scenes of  his daily life, so now the inner life should find graphic utterance in  all its intricacy up to the full limit of unrepressed courage. For the  great majority, on the other hand, who only appreciate and will never  create, the mind, if it have its rights, will be stored with the best  images and sentiments of art; for at this time they are best  remembered and sink deepest into heart and life. Now, although the  hand may refuse, the fancy paints the world in brightest hues and  fairest forms; and such an opportunity for"]]]
