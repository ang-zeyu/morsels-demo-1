[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13854"],[0,"The Old Franciscan Missions Of California (#11)"],[1,"me this kind of criticism is both unjust and puerile. What is  education? What is civilization?    Expert opinions as to these matters vary considerably, and it is in the  very nature of men that they should vary. The Catholics had their ideas  and they sought to carry them out with care and fidelity. How far they  succeeded it is for the unprejudiced historians and philosophers of the  future to determine. Personally, I regard the education given by the  padres as eminently practical, even though I materially differ from them  as to some of the things they regarded as religious essentials. Yet in  honor it must be said that if I, or the Church to which I belong, or you  and the Church to which you belong, reader, had been in California in  those early days, your religious teaching or mine would have been  entitled, justly, to as much criticism and censure as have ever been  visited upon that of the padres. They did the best they knew, and, as I  shall soon show, they did wonderfully well, far better than the  enlightened government to which we belong has ever done. Certain  essentials stood out before them. These were, to see that the Indians  were baptized, taught the ritual of the Church, lived as nearly as  possible according to the rules laid down for them, attended the  services regularly, did their proper quota of work, were faithful  husbands and wives and dutiful children. Feeling that they were indeed  fathers of a race of children, the priests required obedience and work,  as the father of any well-regulated American household does. And as a  rule these \"children,\" though occasionally rebellious, were  willingly obedient.    Under this regime it is unquestionably true that the lot of the Indians  was immeasurably improved from that of their aboriginal condition. They  were kept in a state of reasonable cleanliness, were well clothed, were  taught and required to do useful work, learned many new and helpful  arts, and were instructed in the elemental matters of the Catholic  faith. All these things were a direct advance.    It should not be overlooked, however, that the Spanish government  provided skilled laborers from Spain or Mexico, and paid their hire, for  the purpose of aiding the settlers in the various pueblos that were  established. Master mechanics, carpenters, blacksmiths, and stone masons  are mentioned in Governor Neve's Rules and Regulations, and it is  possible that some of the Indians were taught by these skilled artisans.  Under the guidance of the padres some of them were taught how to weave.  Cotton was both grown and imported, and all the processes of converting  it, and wool also, into cloth, were undertaken with skill and knowledge.    At San Juan Capistrano the swing and thud of the loom were constantly  heard, there having been at one time as many as forty weavers all  engaged at once in this useful occupation.    San Gabriel and San Luis Rey also had many expert weavers.    At all the Missions the girls and women, as well as the men, had their  share in the general education. They had always been seed gatherers,  grinders, and preparers of the food, and now they were taught the  civilized methods of doing these things. Many became tailors as well as  weavers; others learned to dye the made fabrics, as in the past they had  dyed their basketry splints; and still others--indeed nearly all--became  skilled in the delicate art of lace-making and drawn-work. They were  natural adepts at fine embroidery, as soon as the use of the needle and  colored threads was shown them, and some exquisite work is still  preserved that they accomplished in this field. As candy-makers they  soon became expert and manifested judicious taste.    To return to the men. Many of them became herders of cattle, horses and  sheep, teamsters, and butchers. At San Gabriel alone a hundred cattle  were slaughtered every Saturday as food for the Indians themselves. The  hides of all slain animals were carefully preserved, and either tanned  for home use or shipped East. Dana in _Two Years Before the Mast_ gives  interesting pictures of hide-shipping at San Juan Capistrano. A good  tanner is a skilled laborer, and these Indians were not only expert  makers of dressed leather, but they tanned skins and peltries with the  hair or fur on. Indeed I know of many wonderful birds' skins, dressed  with the feathers on, that are still in perfect preservation. As workers  in leather they have never been surpassed. Many saddles, bridles, etc.,  were needed for Mission use, and as the ranches grew in numbers, they  created a large market. It must be remembered that horseback riding was  the chief method of travel in California for over a hundred years. Their  carved leather work is still the wonder of the world. In the striking  character of their designs, in the remarkable adaptation of the design,  in its general shape and contour, to the peculiar form of the object to  be decorated,--a stirrup, a saddle, a belt, etc.,--and in the digital  and manual dexterity demanded by its execution, nothing is left to be  desired. Equally skilful were they in taking the horn of an ox or  mountain sheep, heating it, and then shaping it into a drinking-cup, a  spoon, or a ladle, and carving upon it designs that equal those found  upon the pottery of the ancient world.    Shoemaking was extensively carried on, for sale on the ranches and to  the trading-vessels. Tallow was tried out by the ton and run into  underground brick vaults, some of which would hold in one mass several  complete ship-loads. This was quarried out and then hauled to San Pedro,  or the nearest port, for shipment. Sometimes it was run into great bags  made of hides, that would hold from five hundred to a thousand pounds  each, and then shipped.    Many of the Indians became expert carpenters, and a few even might be  classed as fair cabinet-makers. There were wheelwrights and cart-makers  who made the \"carretas\" that are now the joy of the relic-hunter. These  were clumsy ox-carts, with wheels made of blocks, sawed or chopped off  from the end of a large round log; a big hole was then bored, chiseled,  or burned through its center, enabling it to turn on a rude wooden axle.  Soap or tallow was sometimes used as a lubricant. This was the only  wheeled conveyance in California as late as 1840. Other Indians did the  woodwork in buildings, made fences, etc. Some were carvers, and there  are not a few specimens of their work that will bear comparison with the  work of far more pretentious artisans.    Many of them became' blacksmiths and learned to work well in iron. In  the Coronel Collection in the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce are many  specimens of the ironwork of the San Fernando neophytes. The work of  this Mission was long and favorably known as that of superior artisans.  The collection includes plough-points, anvils, bells, hoes, chains,  locks and keys, spurs, hinges, scissors, cattle-brands, and other  articles of use in the Mission communities. There are also fine  specimens of hammered copper, showing their ability in this branch of  the craftsman's art. As there was no coal at this time in California,  these metal-workers all became charcoal-burners.    Bricks of adobe and also burned bricks and tiles were made at every  Mission, I believe, and in later years tiles were made for sale for the  houses of the more pretentious inhabitants of the pueblos. As lime and  cement were needed, the Indians were taught how to burn the lime of the  country, and the cement work then done remains to this day as solid as  when it was first put down.    Many of them became expert bricklayers and stone-masons and cutters, as  such work as that found at San Luis Rey, San Juan Capistrano, San  Carlos, Santa Ines, and other Missions most eloquently testifies.    It is claimed that much of the distemper painting upon the church walls  was done by the Indians, though surely it would be far easier to believe  that the Fathers did it than they. For with their training in natural  design, as shown in their exquisite baskets, and the work they  accomplished in leather carving, I do not hesitate to say that mural  decorations would have been far more artistic in design, more harmonious  in color, and more skilfully executed if the Indians had been left to  their own native ability.    A few became silversmiths, though none ever accomplished much in this  line. They made better sandal-makers, shoemakers, and hatters. As  horse-trainers they were speedily most efficient, the cunning of their  minds finding a natural outlet in gaining supremacy over the lower  animal. They braided their own riatas from rawhide, and soon surpassed  their teachers in the use of them. They were fearless hunters with them,  often \"roping\" the mountain lion and even going so far as to capture the  dangerous grizzly bears with no other \"weapon,\" and bring them down  from the mountains for their bear and bull fights. As vaqueros, or  cowboys, they were a distinct class. As daring riders as the world has  ever seen, they instinctively knew the arts of herding cattle and sheep,  and soon had that whole field of work in their keeping. \"H.H.,\" in  _Ramona_, has told what skilled sheep-shearers they were, and there are  Indian bands to-day in Southern California whose services are eagerly  sought at good wages because of their thoroughness, skill and rapidity.    Now, with this list of achievements, who shall say they were not  educated? Something more than lack of education must be looked for as  the reason for the degradation and disappearance of the Indian, and in  the next chapter I think I can supply that missing reason.    At the end of sixty years, more than thirty thousand Indian converts  lodged in the Mission buildings, under the direct and immediate guidance  of the Fathers, and performed their allotted daily labors with  cheerfulness and thoroughness. There were some exceptions necessarily,  but in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13858"],[0,"The Laws Of War, Affecting Commerce And Shipping (#11)"],[1," relief where there was no colour for taking;  and generally to make satisfaction to parties injured. By the Act of  the 13 Car. II. c. 9, (now repealed) indeed, some regulations were  made concerning the treatment of ships taken, but no provisions  enacted respecting any security to be given on delivery; the sole  interest in the thing condemned being in the Crown; it was in public  custody, and the disposition of it a mere matter of prerogative; no  such provisions therefore were necessary.    But in the sixth year of Queen Anne, it was thought proper, for the  encouragement of seamen, to vest in them the prizes they should take;  and for that purpose the statutes, 6 Anne, c. 13 and c. 37, were  passed.    The first of these acts only relates to proceedings in the Courts of  Admiralty in England, but contains no particular directions to them;  the practice of those courts being already settled.[102]    There is a long series of statutes, which follows the above, on the  subject of the Prize Courts. The following may be taken as a general  description of their operation.    The judge should proceed, according to their form, to sentence with  all possible expedition. If on the preparatory examination there  arises a doubt in the breast of the judge, whether the capture is  prize or not, and further proof appears to be necessary, the ship and  cargo is appraised by persons named on the part of the captor, and is  delivered up to the claimants, on their giving good and sufficient  security to pay to the captor the full value, according to the  appraisement, if the ship is adjudged lawful prize by the judge; by  this the claimant is entitled to the immediate possession of the  subject in dispute, which the captor cannot obtain but on the refusal  of the claimant to give security for the appraised value. After a  sentence of condemnation, the captor has a right to the possession;  the execution of the sentence is not suspended by an appeal, but the  party appellant gives good and sufficient security to restore the  cargo, or its full value, in case the sentence is reversed.[103]    [Sidenote: Where Prize Courts can be held.]    Having explained shortly the operation of the Prize Courts, it must be  observed, that the Prize Court of an Ally cannot condemn. Prize or no  prize is a question belonging exclusively to the courts of the country  of the captor. The reason is, that the Sovran has a right and is bound  to inspect the conduct of the captors, for he is answerable to other  states for the acts of the captor. The Prize Court of the captor may  sit in the country of a co-belligerent or an ally, because there is a  common interest between such on the subject, and both governments may  be presumed to authorize any measures conducing to give effect to  their arms, and to consider each others ports as mutually  subservient.[104]    It is not lawful for such a court to act in a neutral territory; and  it was at one time even doubted, where property had been carried into,  and was lying in a neutral port, whether the validity of the capture  could be determined even by a Court of Prize established in the  captor's country; because it was thought that the possession in reach  of the court was essential to the exercise of a jurisdiction in a  proceeding _in rem_. The principle was admitted by Sir Wm. Scott to be  correct, in the case of the Henrick and the Maria;[105] but he  considered that the English Admiralty had gone too far in supporting  condemnations in England, of prizes abroad in neutral ports, to permit  him to recall the vicious practice of the Court to acknowledged  principle.    [Sidenote: Judgments of Prize Courts conclusive.]    The jurisdiction of the Court of the capturing nation is conclusive  upon the question of property in the captured thing. Its sentence  settles all further dispute between claimants; and if that sentence is  manifestly unjust, or against the Law of Nations, the state is alone  responsible, and not the captors. An unjust sentence is a good ground  for issuing commissions of Reprisals. Numerous treaties between the  different powers of Europe, regulating the subject of Reprisals,  declare that they shall not be granted, unless in case of the _denial  of justice_. \"An unjust sentence,\" says Wheaton, \"must certainly be  considered as a denial of justice, unless the mere privilege of being  heard before condemnation is all that is included in the idea of  justice.\"[106]    Thus the sentence of a Prize Court, it is plain, is sufficient to  confirm the captor's title to captures at sea; but a different rule  applies to real property or immoveables.    Immoveable possessions, lands, towns, provinces, &c., become the  property of the enemy who makes himself master of them; but it is only  by the treaty of peace, or the entire subjugation and extinction of  the state to which those towns and provinces belonged, that the  acquisition is completed, and the property becomes stable and perfect.  Thus, a third party cannot safely purchase conquered land till the  Sovran from whom it has been taken has renounced it by a treaty of  peace, or has irretrievably lost his sovereignty.[107] Until such  confirmation, it continues liable to be divested by the _jus  postliminii_. The purchaser of any portion takes it, at the peril of  being evicted by the original Sovran owner, when he is restored to his  dominions.[108]    I now pass on to the more commercial question of Passports,  Safe-Conducts, and Licences to Trade.        SECTION III.        _Licences_.      [Sidenote: Passports and Safe Conducts]    Passports, and Safe-conducts, are a kind of privilege, insuring safety  to persons in passing and repassing, or to certain things during their  conveyance from one place to another. All Safe-conducts, like every  other act of Supreme Command, emanate from the Sovran authority, but  are constantly delegated to inferior officers, either by an express  commission, or by a natural consequence of the nature of their  functions. The person named in the Passport cannot transfer his  privilege to another. They generally promise security wherever the  grantor has authority and command, and are interpreted by the same  rules of liberality and good faith, with other acts of the Sovran  power.[109]    [Sidenote: Licences to Trade with the Enemy]    A Licence granted by a state to its own subjects, or to those or the  enemy, is a dispensation on its own side of the Laws of War, as far as  its terms can be fairly construed. The adverse party may justly  consider such licence as a ground of capture and confiscation _per  se_; but the Prize Courts of the state, under whose authority they are  issued, are bound to consider them as lawful relaxations of the  ordinary state of war. In the country which grants them, licences to  carry on a pacific commerce are rigidly interpreted, as being  exceptions to a general rule; though they are not to be construed with  pedantic accuracy, nor will every small deviation be held to vitiate  the fair effect of them.[111]    During the later period of the last century, and the earlier portion  of this, licences were considered as privileges granted to individuals  for their own benefit, and in which the nation at large was but  little, or remotely, interested. They were therefore held liable to  the same strict construction with other similar grants. Yet this rule  was never held in a narrow captious manner; and if the apparent  intention of Government was complied with, and there was no suspicion  of fraud, a sufficient liberality was allowed in the construction.  When the extraordinary mode of warfare established by the Emperor  Napoleon, (by an attempt at a general embargo) was carried on, new  expedients were required to counteract its evils, and licences to a  great extent were granted to relieve the stagnant trade of the  country; and this measure, so highly beneficial, and even necessary,  was facilitated by the adoption of a still more liberal mode of  construction, and which, no doubt, will again guide these cases.[112]    [Sidenote: Duties of Merchants using Licences]    In trading under a Licence, the merchant ought to follow the terms or  it as strictly as possible; but if he is acting _bona fides_, some  breaches of it will be permitted. Being high acts of Sovranty, they  are necessarily the creatures of that act of power, and must not be  carried further than the intention of the great authority that grants  them may be supposed to extend; not that they are to be construed with  pedantic accuracy, nor that any small deviation should be held to  vitiate the fair effect of them. An excess in the _quantity_ of goods  permitted might not he considered noxious to any extent. A variation  in the quality or substance of the goods might be more significant,  because a liberty assumed of trading in one species of goods, under a  license to trade in another, might lead to very dangerous abuses. The  license must be looked to for the enumeration of goods that are to be  protected by it.[113]    The principles on which courts act in treating licences is thus  succinctly laid down by Sir William Scott.--         \"I need not repeat what I have so often stated, the anxious       wish of this court to relieve, as much as possible, the       difficulties under which the commerce of the world now       labours (November 1812,) and to apply the most favourable       consideration to the construction of license cases. At the       same time it is to be remembered, that the court possesses       the mere power of interpretation; that it must confine       itself to a reasonable explanation of the terms made use of,       and cannot alter or dispense with conditions considered as       essential by the Government granting the license. If the       court assumes the power of extension by favourable       interpretation, it does so only where there is a total       absence of _bad faith_, and "]]]
