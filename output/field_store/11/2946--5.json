As a redeeming  quality, the Man with the Hoe has a certain patient dignity which  commands our respect, but with all that, we do not call it a pleasant  subject.    But look a moment at the strong, noble outlines of the drawing and see  how finely modelled is the figure. So carefully did Millet study this  work that he first modelled the figure in clay that he might give it  more vitality in the painting. This Man with the Hoe seems indeed not  a painted figure, but a real living, breathing human being, whom we  can touch and find of solid flesh and blood.    We must note, too, how grandly the figure is thrown out against  the sky and the plain. There is something to observe, also, in the  proportions of the man to the background. The broad pyramid made by  the bending figure and the hoe needs plenty of space at each side to  set it off, hence the oblong shape of the picture. These, and other  artistic qualities not so easily observed and understood, all give the  picture \"a place among the greater artistic conceptions of all time.\"    The Man with the Hoe has probably caused more discussion than any  other of Millet's paintings. From the very first those who care only  for the subject of a picture have condemned it, while the critics have  praised its artistic qualities. Many have thought that Millet made  the subject as unpleasant as possible in order to show the degrading  effects of work. The same theory was suggested when the Sower and  the Gleaners appeared. The painter himself was much troubled by these  misunderstandings. \"I have never dreamed of being a pleader in any  cause,\" he said. He simply painted life as he saw it, and had no  thought of teaching strange doctrines against labor. Indeed, no man  ever felt more deeply than he the dignity of labor.    When everything which could be said for or against the picture had  been exhausted on the other side of the Atlantic, the picture was  brought to this country and finally to the State of California. Here  the discussion began all over again. There were those who were so  impressed by the unpleasant character of the subject that they could  not find words strong enough to express their horror. The Man with  the Hoe was called \"a monstrous thing distorted and soul-quenched,\" a  \"dread\" and \"terrible\" shape, \"a thing that grieves not and that never  hopes,\" a \"brother to the ox,\" and many other things which would have  surprised and grieved Millet.    Of course, any one to whom the pathos of the subject itself appeals  so strongly can have little thought for the artistic qualities of the  picture. So Edwin Markham, the writer of the poem from which  these expressions are quoted, lets the subject lead him on into an  impassioned protest against \"the degradation of labor,--the oppression  of man by man,\"--all of which has nothing to do with the picture.    Millet was not one to care at all for what he called \"pretty\"  subjects, as we have already seen in studying the picture of the  Milkmaid. \"He felt that only by giving to his figures the expression  and character which belonged to their condition could he obey the laws  of beauty in art, for he knew that a work of art is beautiful only  when it is homogeneous.\"[1]    This was the theory which he put into practice in the Man with the  Hoe, and one who understands well both his theories and his art sums  up the great painting in these words: \"The noble proportions of the  figure alone would give this work a place among the greater artistic  conceptions of all time, while the severe and simple pathos of this  moment of respite in the interminable earth struggle, invests it with  a sublimity which belongs to eternal things alone.\" [2]      [Footnote 1: Pierre Millet in the _Century_.]    [Footnote 2: Henry Naegely.]          XVI    THE PORTRAIT OF MILLET      In studying the works of any great painter many questions naturally  arise as to the personality of the man himself and the influences  which shaped his life. Some such questions have already been answered  as we have examined these fifteen pictures by Millet. Jean Francois  Millet, we have learned, was of peasant parentage and spent the  greater part of his life in the country. His pious Norman ancestors  bequeathed him a rich heritage of strong and serious traits. From  them, too, he drew that patience and perseverance which helped him to  overcome so many obstacles in his career.    In the surroundings of his childhood he saw no pictures and heard  nothing of art or artists. Yet at a very early age he showed a  remarkable talent for drawing. His artistic temperament was inherited  from his father, who was a great lover of music and of everything  beautiful. \"Look,\" he sometimes said, plucking a blade of grass  and showing it to his little boy, \"how beautiful this is.\" His  grandmother, too, had a true poetic vein in her nature. She would come  to the child's bedside in the morning, calling, \"Wake up, my little  Francois, you don't know how long the birds have been singing the  glory of God.\" In such a family the youth's gifts were readily  recognized, and he was sent to Cherbourg, the nearest large town,  to learn to be a painter. Here, and later in Paris, he received  instruction from various artists, but his greatest teacher was Nature.  So he turned from the schools of Paris, and the artificial standards  of his fellow artists there, to study for himself, at first hand, the  peasant life he wished to portray. What a delightful place Barbizon  was for such work we have seen from some of his pictures.    It was during the fruitful years of work at Barbizon that Millet  made the crayon portrait of himself which is reproduced as our  frontispiece. He was a large, strong, deep-chested man, somewhat above  the medium height. An admirer has described him as \"one of nature's  noblemen,\" and his younger brother Pierre says he was \"built like  a Hercules.\" He had an inherent distaste for fine clothes which he  showed even in boyhood. When he grew to be a painter, and returned to  visit his family in Greville, the villagers were scandalized to see  the city artist appear in their streets in blouse and sabots.    As we see in the portrait, Millet had long wavy hair, falling over  his shoulders, and a thick black beard. His forehead was high and  intelligent, and his nose delicately cut and sensitive. His eyes were  gray-blue, of the kind which look a man through and through and which  nothing escapes. The artist had so trained these wonderful eyes of his  that he had only to turn them on a scene to photograph the impression  indelibly on his memory.    The face that we see in the portrait is that of a thinker, a poet, and  an artist. It is the face of one who held intimate converse with the  great poets of the ages, of one whose favorite books were the Bible,  Virgil, Theocritus and Shakespeare. Though Millet had many genial  traits in his nature, his expression here is profoundly serious. Such  an expression tells much of the inner life of the man. His pictures  were too original to be popular at once, and while he waited for  purchasers he found it hard to support his family. His anxieties wore  upon his health, and he was subject to frequent headaches of frightful  severity. Nor was the struggle with poverty his only trial. He had to  contend constantly against the misconceptions and misrepresentations  of hostile critics.    He was of too stern a nature and too loyal to his ideals to vary a  hair's breadth from his course, yet criticism embittered him. \"Give me  signboards to paint, if you will,\" he exclaimed, \"but at least let  me think out my subjects in my own fashion and finish the work that I  have to do, in peace.\"    Like all who have great originality, Millet lived in a world of his  own, and had but a few congenial friends. To such friends, however,  and in the inner circle of his home, he opened his great and tender  heart, and all who knew him loved him."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1312"],[0,"Selected Stories of Bret Harte (#11)"],[1," the top of the hill.  Thar--I told you so!--thar he is--coming this way, too--all by himself,  sober, and his face a-shining. Tennessee! Pardner!\"    And so they met.          THE IDYL OF RED GULCH      Sandy was very drunk. He was lying under an azalea bush, in pretty much  the same attitude in which he had fallen some hours before. How long  he had been lying there he could not tell, and didn't care; how long  he should lie there was a matter equally indefinite and unconsidered.  A tranquil philosophy, born of his physical condition, suffused and  saturated his moral being.    The spectacle of a drunken man, and of this drunken man in particular,  was not, I grieve to say, of sufficient novelty in Red Gulch to  attract attention. Earlier in the day some local satirist had erected a  temporary tombstone at Sandy's head, bearing the inscription, \"Effects  of McCorkle's whisky--kills at forty rods,\" with a hand pointing to  McCorkle's saloon. But this, I imagine, was, like most local satire,  personal; and was a reflection upon the unfairness of the process  rather than a commentary upon the impropriety of the result. With this  facetious exception, Sandy had been undisturbed. A wandering mule,  released from his pack, had cropped the scant herbage beside him, and  sniffed curiously at the prostrate man; a vagabond dog, with that deep  sympathy which the species have for drunken men, had licked his dusty  boots, and curled himself up at his feet, and lay there, blinking one  eye in the sunlight, with a simulation of dissipation that was ingenious  and doglike in its implied flattery of the unconscious man beside him.    Meanwhile the shadows of the pine trees had slowly swung around until  they crossed the road, and their trunks barred the open meadow with  gigantic parallels of black and yellow. Little puffs of red dust, lifted  by the plunging hoofs of passing teams, dispersed in a grimy shower upon  the recumbent man. The sun sank lower and lower; and still Sandy stirred  not. And then the repose of this philosopher was disturbed, as other  philosophers have been, by the intrusion of an unphilosophical sex.    \"Miss Mary,\" as she was known to the little flock that she had just  dismissed from the log schoolhouse beyond the pines, was taking her  afternoon walk. Observing an unusually fine cluster of blossoms on the  azalea bush opposite, she crossed the road to pluck it--picking her  way through the red dust, not without certain fierce little shivers of  disgust and some feline circumlocution. And then she came suddenly upon  Sandy!    Of course she uttered the little staccato cry of her sex. But when she  had paid that tribute to her physical weakness she became overbold, and  halted for a moment--at least six feet from this prostrate monster--with  her white skirts gathered in her hand, ready for flight. But neither  sound nor motion came from the bush. With one little foot she then  overturned the satirical headboard, and muttered \"Beasts!\"--an epithet  which probably, at that moment, conveniently classified in her mind the  entire male population of Red Gulch. For Miss Mary, being possessed of  certain rigid notions of her own, had not, perhaps, properly appreciated  the demonstrative gallantry for which the Californian has been so justly  celebrated by his brother Californians, and had, as a newcomer, perhaps  fairly earned the reputation of being \"stuck-up.\"    As she stood there she noticed, also, that the slant sunbeams were  heating Sandy's head to what she judged to be an unhealthy temperature,  and that his hat was lying uselessly at his side. To pick it up and to  place it over his face was a work requiring some courage, particularly  as his eyes were open. Yet she did it, and made good her retreat. But  she was somewhat concerned, on looking back, to see that the hat was  removed, and that Sandy was sitting up and saying something.    The truth was, that in the calm depths of Sandy's mind he was satisfied  that the rays of the sun were beneficial and healthful; that from  childhood he had objected to lying down in a hat; that no people but  condemned fools, past redemption, ever wore hats; and that his right  to dispense with them when he pleased was inalienable. This was the  statement of his inner consciousness. Unfortunately, its outward  expression was vague, being limited to a repetition of the following  formula--\"Su'shine all ri'! Wasser maar, eh? Wass up, su'shine?\"    Miss Mary stopped, and, taking fresh courage from her vantage of  distance, asked him if there was anything that he wanted.    \"Wass up? Wasser maar?\" continued Sandy, in a very high key.    \"Get up, you horrid man!\" said Miss Mary, now thoroughly incensed; \"get  up, and go home.\"    Sandy staggered to his feet. He was six feet high, and Miss Mary  trembled. He started forward a few paces and then stopped.    \"Wass I go home for?\" he suddenly asked, with great gravity.    \"Go and take a bath,\" replied Miss Mary, eying his grimy person with  great disfavor.    To her infinite dismay, Sandy suddenly pulled off his coat and vest,  threw them on the ground, kicked off his boots, and, plunging wildly  forward, darted headlong over the hill, in the direction of the river.    \"Goodness heavens!--the man will be drowned!\" said Miss Mary; and then,  with feminine inconsistency, she ran back to the schoolhouse and locked  herself in.    That night, while seated at supper with her hostess, the blacksmith's  wife, it came to Miss Mary to ask, demurely, if her husband ever got  drunk. \"Abner,\" responded Mrs. Stidger, reflectively, \"let's see: Abner  hasn't been tight since last 'lection.\" Miss Mary would have liked to  ask if he preferred lying in the sun on these occasions, and if a cold  bath would have hurt him; but this would have involved an explanation,  which she did not then care to give. So she contented herself with  opening her gray eyes widely at the red-cheeked Mrs. Stidger--a fine  specimen of Southwestern efflorescence--and then dismissed the subject  altogether. The next day she wrote to her dearest friend, in Boston:  \"I think I find the intoxicated portion of this community the least  objectionable. I refer, my dear, to the men, of course. I do not know  anything that could make the women tolerable.\"    In less than a week Miss Mary had forgotten this episode, except that  her afternoon walks took thereafter, almost unconsciously, another  direction. She noticed, however, that every morning a fresh cluster of  azalea blossoms appeared among the flowers on her desk. This was not  strange, as her little flock were aware of her fondness for flowers, and  invariably kept her desk bright with anemones, syringas, and lupines;  but, on questioning them, they one and all professed ignorance of the  azaleas. A few days later, Master Johnny Stidger, whose desk was nearest  to the window, was suddenly taken with spasms of apparently gratuitous  laughter that threatened the discipline of the school. All that Miss  Mary could get from him was, that someone had been \"looking in the  winder.\" Irate and indignant, she sallied from her hive to do battle  with the intruder. As she turned the corner of the schoolhouse she came  plump upon the quondam drunkard--now perfectly sober, and inexpressibly  sheepish and guilty-looking.    These facts Miss Mary was not slow to take a feminine advantage of, in  her present humor. But it was somewhat confusing to observe, also,  that the beast, despite some faint signs of past dissipation, was  amiable-looking--in fact, a kind of blond Samson whose corn-colored,  silken beard apparently had never yet known the touch of barber's razor  or Delilah's shears. So that the cutting speech which quivered on  her ready tongue died upon her lips, and she contented herself with  receiving his stammering apology with supercilious eyelids and the  gathered skirts of uncontamination. When she re-entered the schoolroom,  her eyes fell upon the azaleas with a new sense of revelation. And  then she laughed, and the little people all laughed, and they were all  unconsciously very happy.    It was on a hot day--and not long after this--that two short-legged boys  came to grief on the threshold of the school with a pail of water,  which they had laboriously brought from the spring, and that Miss Mary  compassionately seized the pail and started for the spring herself. At  the foot of the hill a shadow crossed her path, and a blue-shirted arm  dexterously but gently relieved her of her burden. Miss Mary was both  embarrassed and angry. \"If you carried more of that for yourself,\" she  said, spitefully, to the blue arm, without deigning to raise her lashes  to its owner, \"you'd do better.\" In the submissive silence that followed  she regretted the speech, and thanked him so sweetly at the door that  he stumbled. Which caused the children to laugh again--a laugh in which  Miss Mary joined, until the color came faintly into her pale cheek.  The next day a barrel was mysteriously placed beside the door, and as  mysteriously filled with fresh spring water every morning.    Nor was this superior young person without other quiet attentions.  \"Profane Bill,\" driver of the Slumgullion Stage, widely known in the  newspapers for his \"gallantry\" in invariably offering the box seat to  the fair sex, had excepted Miss Mary from this attention, on the ground  that he had a habit of \"cussin' on upgrades,\" and gave her half the  coach to herself. Jack Hamlin, a gambler, having once silently ridden  with her in the same coach, afterward threw a decanter at the head of a  confederate for mentioning her name in a barroom. The overdressed mother  of a pupil whose paternity was doubtful had often lingered near this  astute Vestal's temple, never daring to enter its sacred precincts, but  content to worship the priestess from afar.
