I know one of his subjects who could match him at that. If  he cannot speak like an Englishman I trow that he can fight like an  Englishman, and he was hammering at the gates of Paris while ale-house  topers were grutching and grumbling at home.\"    This loud speech, coming from a man of so formidable an appearance,  somewhat daunted the disloyal party, and they fell into a sullen  silence, which enabled Alleyne to hear something of the talk which was  going on in the further corner between the physician, the tooth-drawer  and the gleeman.    \"A raw rat,\" the man of drugs was saying, \"that is what it is ever my  use to order for the plague--a raw rat with its paunch cut open.\"    \"Might it not be broiled, most learned sir?\" asked the tooth-drawer. \"A  raw rat sounds a most sorry and cheerless dish.\"    \"Not to be eaten,\" cried the physician, in high disdain. \"Why should any  man eat such a thing?\"    \"Why indeed?\" asked the gleeman, taking a long drain at his tankard.    \"It is to be placed on the sore or swelling. For the rat, mark you,  being a foul-living creature, hath a natural drawing or affinity for  all foul things, so that the noxious humors pass from the man into the  unclean beast.\"    \"Would that cure the black death, master?\" asked Jenkin.    \"Aye, truly would it, my fair son.\"    \"Then I am right glad that there were none who knew of it. The black  death is the best friend that ever the common folk had in England.\"    \"How that then?\" asked Hordle John.    \"Why, friend, it is easy to see that you have not worked with your hands  or you would not need to ask. When half the folk in the country were  dead it was then that the other half could pick and choose who they  would work for, and for what wage. That is why I say that the murrain  was the best friend that the borel folk ever had.\"    \"True, Jenkin,\" said another workman; \"but it is not all good that is  brought by it either. We well know that through it corn-land has been  turned into pasture, so that flocks of sheep with perchance a single  shepherd wander now where once a hundred men had work and wage.\"    \"There is no great harm in that,\" remarked the tooth-drawer, \"for the  sheep give many folk their living. There is not only the herd, but the  shearer and brander, and then the dresser, the curer, the dyer, the  fuller, the webster, the merchant, and a score of others.\"    \"If it come to that.\" said one of the foresters, \"the tough meat of them  will wear folks teeth out, and there is a trade for the man who can draw  them.\"    A general laugh followed this sally at the dentist's expense, in the  midst of which the gleeman placed his battered harp upon his knee, and  began to pick out a melody upon the frayed strings.    \"Elbow room for Floyting Will!\" cried the woodmen. \"Twang us a merry  lilt.\"    \"Aye, aye, the 'Lasses of Lancaster,'\" one suggested.    \"Or 'St. Simeon and the Devil.'\"    \"Or the 'Jest of Hendy Tobias.'\"    To all these suggestions the jongleur made no response, but sat with his  eye fixed abstractedly upon the ceiling, as one who calls words to his  mind. Then, with a sudden sweep across the strings, he broke out into  a song so gross and so foul that ere he had finished a verse the  pure-minded lad sprang to his feet with the blood tingling in his face.    \"How can you sing such things?\" he cried. \"You, too, an old man who  should be an example to others.\"    The wayfarers all gazed in the utmost astonishment at the interruption.    \"By the holy Dicon of Hampole! our silent clerk has found his tongue,\"  said one of the woodmen. \"What is amiss with the song then? How has it  offended your babyship?\"    \"A milder and better mannered song hath never been heard within these  walls,\" cried another. \"What sort of talk is this for a public inn?\"    \"Shall it be a litany, my good clerk?\" shouted a third; \"or would a hymn  be good enough to serve?\"    The jongleur had put down his harp in high dudgeon. \"Am I to be preached  to by a child?\" he cried, staring across at Alleyne with an inflamed and  angry countenance. \"Is a hairless infant to raise his tongue against me,  when I have sung in every fair from Tweed to Trent, and have twice been  named aloud by the High Court of the Minstrels at Beverley? I shall sing  no more to-night.\"    \"Nay, but you will so,\" said one of the laborers. \"Hi, Dame Eliza, bring  a stoup of your best to Will to clear his throat. Go forward with thy  song, and if our girl-faced clerk does not love it he can take to the  road and go whence he came.\"    \"Nay, but not too last,\" broke in Hordle John. \"There are two words in  this matter. It may be that my little comrade has been over quick in  reproof, he having gone early into the cloisters and seen little of the  rough ways and words of the world. Yet there is truth in what he says,  for, as you know well, the song was not of the cleanest. I shall stand  by him, therefore, and he shall neither be put out on the road, nor  shall his ears be offended indoors.\"    \"Indeed, your high and mighty grace,\" sneered one of the yeomen, \"have  you in sooth so ordained?\"    \"By the Virgin!\" said a second, \"I think that you may both chance to  find yourselves upon the road before long.\"    \"And so belabored as to be scarce able to crawl along it,\" cried a  third.    \"Nay, I shall go! I shall go!\" said Alleyne hurriedly, as Hordle John  began to slowly roll up his sleeve, and bare an arm like a leg of  mutton. \"I would not have you brawl about me.\"    \"Hush! lad,\" he whispered, \"I count them not a fly. They may find they  have more tow on their distaff than they know how to spin. Stand thou  clear and give me space.\"    Both the foresters and the laborers had risen from their bench, and Dame  Eliza and the travelling doctor had flung themselves between the two  parties with soft words and soothing gestures, when the door of the  \"Pied Merlin\" was flung violently open, and the attention of the company  was drawn from their own quarrel to the new-comer who had burst so  unceremoniously upon them.        CHAPTER VI. HOW SAMKIN AYLWARD WAGERED HIS FEATHER-BED.      He was a middle-sized man, of most massive and robust build, with an  arching chest and extraordinary breadth of shoulder. His shaven face was  as brown as a hazel-nut, tanned and dried by the weather, with harsh,  well-marked features, which were not improved by a long white scar which  stretched from the corner of his left nostril to the angle of the jaw.  His eyes were bright and searching, with something of menace and of  authority in their quick glitter, and his mouth was firm-set and hard,  as befitted one who was wont to set his face against danger. A straight  sword by his side and a painted long-bow jutting over his shoulder  proclaimed his profession, while his scarred brigandine of chain-mail  and his dinted steel cap showed that he was no holiday soldier, but one  who was even now fresh from the wars. A white surcoat with the lion  of St. George in red upon the centre covered his broad breast, while a  sprig of new-plucked broom at the side of his head-gear gave a touch of  gayety and grace to his grim, war-worn equipment.    \"Ha!\" he cried, blinking like an owl in the sudden glare. \"Good even  to you, comrades! Hola! a woman, by my soul!\" and in an instant he had  clipped Dame Eliza round the waist and was kissing her violently. His  eye happening to wander upon the maid, however, he instantly abandoned  the mistress and danced off after the other, who scurried in confusion  up one of the ladders, and dropped the heavy trap-door upon her pursuer.  He then turned back and saluted the landlady once more with the utmost  relish and satisfaction.    \"La petite is frightened,\" said he. \"Ah, c'est l'amour, l'amour! Curse  this trick of French, which will stick to my throat. I must wash it out  with some good English ale. By my hilt! camarades, there is no drop of  French blood in my body, and I am a true English bowman, Samkin Aylward  by name; and I tell you, mes amis, that it warms my very heart-roots to  set my feet on the dear old land once more. When I came off the galley  at Hythe, this very day, I down on my bones, and I kissed the good brown  earth, as I kiss thee now, ma belle, for it was eight long years since  I had seen it. The very smell of it seemed life to me. But where are my  six rascals? Hola, there! En avant!\"    At the order, six men, dressed as common drudges, marched solemnly  into the room, each bearing a huge bundle upon his head. They formed in  military line, while the soldier stood in front of them with stern eyes,  checking off their several packages.    \"Number one--a French feather-bed with the two counter-panes of white  sendall,\" said he.    \"Here, worthy sir,\" answered the first of the bearers, laying a great  package down in the corner.    \"Number two--seven ells of red Turkey cloth and nine ells of cloth of  gold. Put it down by the other. Good dame, I prythee give each of these  men a bottrine of wine or a jack of ale. Three--a full piece of white  Genoan velvet with twelve ells of purple silk. Thou rascal, there is  dirt on the hem! Thou hast brushed it against some wall, coquin!\"    \"Not I, most worthy sir,\" cried the carrier, shrinking away from the  fierce eyes of the bowman.    \"I say yes, dog! By the three kings! I have seen a man gasp out his last  breath for less. Had you gone through the pain and unease that I have  done to earn these things you would be at more care. I swear by my ten  finger-bones that there is not one of them that hath not cost its weight  in French blood! Four--an incense-boat, a ewer of silver, a gold buckle  and a cope worked in pearls. I found them, camarades, at the Church of  St. Denis in the harrying of Narbonne, and I took them away with me lest  they fall into the hands of the wicked. Five--a cloak of fur turned  up with minever, a gold goblet with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#10)"],[1,"of the open sea his idle promises,--there,      standing among the shingle of the beach, the daughter of Minos follows      him, alas! with her beautiful sad eyes: she stares, astonied, like to a      Bacchante changed into a statue. She looks forth, and her heart floats      upon the great waves of her grief. She lets slip from her head her      fine-spun coif, she tears away the thin veils which cover her bosom,      and the smooth cincture which supports her quivering breasts. All that      slips from her body into the salt foam which ripples round her feet.      But little she cares for her coif or for her apparel carried away by      the tide! Lost, bewildered, with all her heart and all her soul, she is      clinging to thee, O Theseus._    And if Augustin, when he had read these burning verses of Catullus, looked  through the Anthologies which were popular in the African schools, he  would come upon \"The Vigil of Venus,\" that eclogue which ends with such a  passionate cry:        _O my springtime, when wilt thou come? When shall I be as the swallow?      When shall I cease to be silent?... May he love to-morrow, he      has not loved yet. And he who has already loved, may he love again      to-morrow._    Imagine the effect of such exhortations on a youth of fifteen! Truly, this  springtide of love, which the poet cries for in his distress, the son  of Monnica knew well was come for him. How he must have listened to the  musical and melancholy counsellor who told his pain to the leaves of the  book! What stimulant and what food for his boyish longings and dreams! And  what a divine chorus of beauties the great love-heroines of ancient epic  and elegy, Helen, Medea, Ariadne, Phaedra, formed and re-formed continually  in his dazzled memory! When we of to-day read such verses at Augustin's  age, some bitterness is mixed with our delight. These heroes and heroines  are too far from us. These almost chimerical beings withdraw from us into  outlying lands, to a vanished world which will never come again. But for  Augustin, this was the world he was born into--it was his pagan Africa  where pleasure was the whole of life, and one lived only for the lusts of  the flesh. And the race of fabulous princesses--they were not dead, those  ladies: they were ever waiting for the well-beloved in the palaces at  Carthage. Yes, the scholar of Madaura lived wonderful hours, dreaming thus  of love between the pages of the poets. These young dreams before love  comes are more bewitching than love itself: a whole unknown world suddenly  discovered and entered with a quivering joy of discovery at each step. The  unused strength of illusion appears inexhaustible, space becomes deeper and  the heart more strong....    A long time afterwards, when, recovered from all that, Augustin speaks to  us of the Divine love, he will know fully the infinite value of it from  having gone through all the painful entrancements of the other. And he will  say to us, with the sureness of experience: \"The pleasure of the human  heart in the light of truth and the abundance of wisdom--yea, the pleasure  of the human heart, of the faithful heart, and of the heart which is  holy, stands alone. You will find nothing in any voluptuousness fit to be  compared to it. I say not that this other pleasure is less, for that which  is called less hath only to increase to become equal. No, I shall not say  that all other pleasure is less. No comparison can be made. It is another  kind, it is another reality.\"          VI    THE HOLIDAYS AT THAGASTE      In the city of Apuleius, the Christian Monnica's son became simply a pagan.  He was near his sixteenth year: the awkward time of early virility was  beginning for him. Prepared at Madaura, it suddenly burst out at Thagaste.    Augustin came back to his parents, no doubt during the vacation. But  this vacation lasted perhaps a whole year. He had come to the end of his  juvenile studies. The grammarians at Madaura could teach him nothing more.  To round off his acquirements, it would be necessary to attend the lectures  of some well-known rhetorician. Now there were very good rhetoricians only  at Carthage. Besides, it was a fashion, and point of honour, for Numidian  families to send their sons to finish their education in the provincial  capital. Patricius was most eager to do this for his son, who at Madaura  had shewn himself a very brilliant pupil and ought not therefore to be  pulled up half-way down the course. But the life of a student cost a good  deal, and Patricius had no money. His affairs were always muddled. He was  obliged to wait for the rents from his farms, to grind down his tenants,  and, ultimately, despairing of any other way out of it, to ask for an  advance of money from a rich patron. That needed time and diplomacy.    Days and months went by, and Augustin, with nothing to do, joined in with  easily-made friends and gave himself up to the pleasures of his time of  life, like all the young townsmen of Thagaste--pleasures rather rough and  little various, such as were to be got in a little free-town of those days,  and as they have remained for the natives of to-day, whether they live  a town or country life. To hunt, to ride horseback, to play at games of  chance, to drink, eat, and make love--they wanted nothing beyond that. When  Augustin in his _Confessions_ accuses himself of his youthful escapades he  uses the most scathing language. He speaks of them with horror and disgust.  Once more we are tempted to believe that he exaggerates through an excess  of Christian remorse. There are even some who, put on their guard by this  vehement tone, have questioned the historical value of the _Confessions_.  They argue that when the Bishop of Hippo wrote these things his views and  feelings had altered. He could no longer judge with the same eye and in  the same spirit the happenings of his youth. All this is only too certain:  when he wrote, it was as a Christian he judged himself, and not as a cold  historian who refuses to go beyond the brutal fact. He tried to unravel  the origin and to trace the consequences of the humblest of his actions,  because this is of the highest importance for salvation. But however severe  his judgment may be, it does not impair the reality of the fact itself.  Moreover, in natures like his, acts which others would hardly think of  have a vibration out of all proportion with the act itself. The evil of sin  depends upon the consciousness of the sin and the pleasure taken in it.  Augustin was very intelligent and very sensual.    In any case, young Africans develop early, and the lechery of the race  is proverbial. It must have been a good deal stronger at a time when  Christianity still had to fight against pagan slackness in these matters,  ere Islam had imposed its hypocritical austerity upon the general conduct.  There is even room for wonder that in Augustin's case this crisis of  development did not happen earlier than his sixteenth year. It seems that  it was only more violent. In what language he describes it! \"I dared to  roam the woods and pursue my vagrant loves beneath the shade.\" But he  was not yet in love--this he points out himself. In his case then it was  simple lust. \"From the quagmire of concupiscence, from the well of puberty,  exhaled a mist which clouded and befogged my heart, so that I could not  distinguish between the clear shining of affection and the darkness of  lust.... I could not keep within the kingdom of light, where friendship  binds soul to soul.... And so I polluted the brook of friendship with the  sewage of lust.\" Let us not try to make it clearer than he has left it  himself. When one thinks of all the African vices, one dare not dwell upon  such avowals. \"Lord,\" he says, \"I was loathsome in Thy sight.\" And with  pitiless justice he analyses the effect of the evil: \"It stormed confusedly  within me, whirling my thoughtless youth over the precipices of desire. And  I wandered still further from Thee, and Thou didst leave me to myself; the  torrent of my fornications tossed and swelled and boiled and ran over.\" And  during this time: \"Thou saidst nothing, O my God!\" This silence of God is  the terrible sign of hardened sin, of hopeless damnation. It meant utter  depravity of the will; he did not even feel remorse any more.    Here he is, then, as if unfastened from his child's soul--separated from  himself. The object of his youthful faith has no more meaning for him. He  understands no longer, and it is all one to him that he does not. Thus,  told by himself, does this first crisis of Augustin's life emerge from the  autobiography; and it takes on a general significance. Once for all, under  a definite form, and to a certain degree classic, he has diagnosed with  his subtle experience of doctor of souls the pubescent crisis in all young  men of his age, in all the young Christians who are to come after him. For  the story of Augustin is the story of each of us. The loss of faith always  occurs when the senses first awaken. At this critical moment, when nature  claims us for her service, the consciousness of spiritual things is, in  most cases, either eclipsed or totally destroyed. The gradual usage to the  brutalities of the instinct ends by killing the sensitiveness of the inward  feelings. It is not reason which turns the young man from God; it is the  flesh. Scepticism but provides him with excuses for the new life he is  leading.    Thus started, Augustin was not able to pull up half-way on the road of  pleasure; he never did anything by halves. In these vulgar revels of the  ordinary wild youth, he wanted again to be best, he wanted to be first as  he was at school. He stirred up his companions and drew them after him.  They in their turn drew him. Among them was found that Alypius, who was the  friend of all his life, who shared his faults and mistakes, who followed  him even in his conversion, and became Bishop of"]]]
