Nevertheless, I was annoyed with him for  what he had said, and for the moment my actions were no part of my  scheme. Consequently I was thus in the last mood for a familiarity from  Quinby, who was hanging about the door between the veranda and the hall,  and who would not let me pass.    \"That's awfully nice of you,\" he had the impudence to whisper.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Giving that poor young beggar another chance!\"    \"I don't understand you.\"    \"Oh, I like that! You know very well that you've gone in on the military  ticket and deliberately cut the poor youngster--\"    I did not wait to hear the end of this gratuitous observation. It was  very rude of me, but in another minute I should have been guilty of a  worse affront. My annoyance had deepened into something like dismay. It  was not only Bob Evers who was misconstruing my little attentions to  Mrs. Lascelles. I was more or less prepared for that. But here were  outsiders talking about us--the three of us! So far from putting a stop  to the talk, I had given it a regular fillip: here were Quinby and his  friends as keen as possible to see what would happen next, if not  betting on a row. The situation had taken a sudden turn for the worse. I  forgot the pleasant hours that I had passed with Mrs. Lascelles, and  began to wish myself well out of the whole affair. But I had now no  intention of getting out of the glacier expedition. I would not have  missed it on any account. Bob had brought that on himself.    And I daresay we seemed a sufficiently united trio as we marched along  the pretty winding path to the Findelen next morning. Dear Bob was not  only such a gentleman, but such a man, that it was almost a pleasure to  be at secret issue with him; he would make way for me at our lady's  side, listen with interest when she made me spin my martial yarns, laugh  if there was aught to laugh at, and in a word, give me every conceivable  chance. His manners might have failed him for one heated moment  overnight; they were beyond all praise this morning; and I repeatedly  discerned a morbid sporting dread of giving the adversary less than fair  play. It was sad to me to consider myself as such to Catherine's son,  but I was determined not to let the thought depress me, and there was  much outward occasion for good cheer. The morning was a perfect one in  every way. The rain had released all the pungent aromas of the mountain  woods through which we passed. Snowy height came in dazzling contrast  with a turquoise sky. The toy town of Zermatt spattered the green hollow  far below. And before me on the narrow path went Bob Evers in a flannel  suit, followed by Mrs. Lascelles and her red parasol, though he carried  her alpenstock with his own in readiness for the glacier.    Thither we came in this order, I at least very hot from hard hobbling to  keep up; but the first breath from the glacier cooled me like a bath,  and the next like the great drink in the second stanza of the Ode to a  Nightingale. I could have shouted out for pleasure, and must have done  so but for the engrossing business of keeping a footing on the sloping  ice with its soiled margin of yet more treacherous _moraine_. Yet on the  glacier itself I was less handicapped than I had been on the way, and  hopped along finely with my two shod sticks and the sharp new nails in  my boots. Bob, however, was invariably in the van, and Mrs. Lascelles  seemed more disposed to wait for me than to hurry after him. I think he  pushed the pace unwittingly, under the prick of those emotions which  otherwise were in such excellent control. I can see him now, continually  waiting for us on the brow of some glistening ice-slope, leaning on his  alpenstock and looking back, jet-black by contrast between the blinding  hues of ice and sky.    But once he waited on the brink of some unfathomable crevasse, and then  we all three cowered together and peeped down; the sides were green and  smooth and sinister, like a crack in the sea, but so close together that  one could not have fallen out of sight; yet when Bob loosened a lump of  ice and kicked it in we heard it clattering from wall to wall in  prolonged diminuendo before the faint splash just reached our ears. Mrs.  Lascelles shuddered, and threw out a hand to prevent me from peering  farther over. The gesture was obviously impersonal and instinctive, as  an older eye would have seen, but Bob's was smouldering when mine met it  next, and in the ensuing advance he left us farther behind than ever.  But on the rock where we had our lunch he was once more himself, bright  and boyish, careless and assured. So he continued till the end of that  chapter. On the way home, moreover, he never once forged ahead, but was  always ready with a hand for Mrs. Lascelles at the awkward places; and  on the way through the woods, nothing would serve him but that I should  set the pace, that we might all keep together. Judge therefore of my  surprise when he came to my room, as I was dressing for the absurdly  early dinner which is the one blot upon Riffel Alp arrangements, with  the startling remark that we \"might as well run straight with one  another.\"    \"By all means, my dear fellow,\" said I, turning to him with the lather  on my chin. He was dressed already, as perfectly as usual, and his hands  were in his pockets. But his fresh brown face was as grave as any  judge's, and his mouth as stern. I went on to ask, disingenuously  enough, if we had not been \"running straight with each other\" as it was.    \"Not quite,\" said Bob Evers, dryly; \"and we might as well, you know!\"    \"To be sure; but don't mind if I go on shaving, and pray speak for  yourself.\"    \"I will,\" he rejoined. \"Do you remember our conversation the night you  came?\"    \"More or less.\"    \"I mean when you and I were alone together, before we turned in.\"    \"Oh, yes. I remember something about it.\"    \"It would be too silly to expect you to remember much,\" he went on after  a pause, with a more delicate irony than heretofore. \"But, as a matter  of fact, I believe I said it was all rot that people talked about the  impossibility of being mere pals with a woman, and all that sort of  thing.\"    \"I believe you did.'\"    \"Well, then, _that_ was rot. That's all.\"    I turned round with my razor in mid-air,    \"My dear fellow!\" I exclaimed.    \"Quite funny, isn't it?\" he laughed, but rather harshly, while his  mountain bronze deepened under my scrutiny.    \"You are not in earnest, Bob!\" said I; and on the word his laughter  ended, his colour went.    \"_I_ am,\" he answered through his teeth. \"_Are you_?\"    Never was war carried more suddenly into the enemy's country, or that  enemy's breath more completely taken away than mine. What could I say?  \"As much as you are, I should hope!\" was what I ultimately said.    The lad stood raking me with a steady fire from his blue eyes.    \"I mean to marry her,\" he said, \"if she will have me.\"    There was no laughing at him. Though barely twenty, as I knew, he was  man enough for any age as we faced each other in my room, and a man who  knew his own mind into the bargain.    \"But, my dear Bob,\" I ventured to remonstrate, \"you are years too  young--\"    \"That's my business. I am in earnest. What about you?\"    I breathed again.    \"My good fellow,\" said I, \"you are at perfect liberty to give yourself  away to me, but you really mustn't expect me to do quite the same for  you.\"    \"I expect precious little, I can tell you!\" the lad rejoined hotly.  \"Not that it matters twopence so long as you are not misled by anything  I said the other day. I prefer to run straight with you--you can run as  you like with me. I only didn't want you to think that I was saying one  thing and doing another. As a matter of fact I meant all I said at the  time, or thought I did, until you came along and made me look into  myself rather more closely than I had done before. I won't say how you  managed it. You will probably see for yourself. But I'm very much  obliged to you, whatever happens. And now that we understand each other  there's no more to be said, and I'll clear out.\"    There was, indeed, no more to be said, and I made no attempt to detain  him; for I did see for myself, only too clearly and precisely, how I had  managed to precipitate the very thing which I had come out from England  expressly to prevent.          CHAPTER VIII    PRAYERS AND PARABLES      I had quite forgotten one element which plays its part in most affairs  of the affections. I mean, of course, the element of pique. Bob Evers,  with the field to himself, had been sensible and safe enough; it was my  intrusion, and nothing else, which had fanned his boyish flame into this  premature conflagration. Of that I felt convinced. But Bob would not  believe me if I told him so; and what else was there for me to tell him?  To betray Catherine and the secret of my presence, would simply hasten  an irrevocable step. To betray Mrs. Lascelles, and _her_ secret, would  certainly not prevent one. Both courses were out of the question upon  other grounds. Yet what else was left?    To speak out boldly to Mrs. Lascelles, to betray Catherine and myself to  her?    I shrank from that; nor had I any right to reveal a secret which was  not only mine. What then was I to do? Here was this lad professedly on  the point of proposing to this woman. It was useless to speak to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11198"],[0,"Christianity and Islam (#11)"],[1,"does the West burst the bonds in  which Orientalism had confined it.    Christianity and Islam then stand upon an equal footing in respect  both of intellectual progress and material wealth. But as the West  emerges from the shadow-land of the middle ages the more definite  becomes its superiority over the East. Western nations become  convinced that the fetters which bind them were forged in the East,  and when they have shaken off their chains, they discover their own  physical and intellectual power. They go forth and create a new world,  in which Orientalism finds but scanty room.    The East, however, cannot break away from the theories of life and  mind which grew in it and around it. Even at the present day the  Oriental is swathed in mediaevalism. A journalist, for instance,  however European his mode of life, will write leaders supported by  arguments drawn from tradition and will reason after the manner of the  old scholasticism. But a change may well take place. Islam may  gradually acquire the spirit as well as the form of modern Europe.  Centuries were needed before mediaeval Christianity learned the need  for submission to the new spirit. Within Christendom itself, it was  non-Christian ideas which created the new movement, but these were  completely amalgamated with pre-existing Christianity. Thus, too, a  Renaissance is possible in the East, not merely by the importation and  imitation of European progress, but primarily by intellectual  advancement at home even within the sphere of religion.    Our task is drawing to its close. We have passed in review the  interaction of Christianity and Islam, so far as the two religions are  concerned. It has also been necessary to refer to the history of the  two civilisations, for the reason that the two religions penetrate  national life, a feature characteristic both of their nature and of  the course of development which they respectively followed. This  method of inquiry has enabled us to gain an idea of the rise and  progress of Muhammedanism as such.    An attempt to explain the points of contact and resemblance between  the two religions naturally tends to obscure the differences between  them. Had we devoted our attention to Islam alone, without special  reference to Christianity, these differences, especially in the region  of dogmatic theology, would have been more obvious. They are, however,  generally well known. The points of connection are much more usually  disregarded: yet they alone can explain the interchange of thought  between the two mediaeval civilisations. The surprising fact is the  amount of general similarity in religious theory between religions so  fundamentally divergent upon points of dogma. Nor is the similarity  confined to religious theory: when we realise that material  civilisation, especially when European medievalism was at its height,  was practically identical in the Christian West and the Muhammedan  East, we are justified in any reference to the unity of Eastern and  Western civilisation.    My statements may tend to represent Islam as a religion of no special  originality; at the same time, Christianity was but one of other  influences operative upon it; early Arabic, Zoroastrian, and Jewish  beliefs in particular have left traces on its development. May not as  much be said of Christianity? Inquirers have seriously attempted to  distinguish Greek and Jewish influences as the component elements of  Christianity: in any case, the extent of the elements original to the  final orthodox system remains a matter of dispute. As we learn to  appreciate historical connection and to probe beneath the surface of  religions in course of development, we discover points of relationship  and interdependency of which the simple believer never even dreams.  The object of all this investigation is, in my opinion, one only: to  discover how the religious experience of the founder of a faith  accommodates itself to pre-existing civilisation, in the effort to  make its influence operative. The eventual triumph of the new religion  is in every case and at every time nothing more than a compromise: nor  can more be expected, inasmuch as the religious instinct, though one  of the most important influences in man, is not the sole determining  influence upon his nature.    Recognition of this fact can only be obtained at the price of a breach  with ecclesiastical mode of thought. Premonitions of some such breach  are apparent in modern Muhammedanism: for ourselves, they are  accomplished facts. If I correctly interpret the signs of the times, a  retrograde movement in religious development has now begun. The  religion inspiring a single personality, has secured domination over  the whole of life: family, society, and state have bowed beneath its  power. Then the reaction begins: slowly religion loses its  comprehensive force and as its history is learned, even at the price  of sorrow, it slowly recedes within the true limits of its operation,  the individual, the personality, in which it is naturally rooted.          CONCLUSION AND BIBLIOGRAPHY      The purpose of the present work has been to show not so much the  identity of Christian and Muhammedan theories of life during the  middle ages, as the parallel course of development common to both, and  to demonstrate the fact that ideas could be transferred from one  system to the other. Detail has been sacrificed to this general  purpose. The brief outline of Muhammedan dogmatics and mysticism was  necessary to complete the general survey of the question. Any one of  these subjects, and the same is true as regards a detailed life of  Muhammed, would require at least another volume of equal size for  satisfactory treatment.    The Oriental scholar will easily see where I base my statements upon  my own researches and where I have followed Goldziher and Snouck. My  chief source of information, apart from the six great books of  tradition, has been the invaluable compilation of Soj[=u]t[=i], the  great Kanz el-'Umm[=a]l (Hyderabad, 1314). To those who do not read  Arabic may be recommended the French translation of the Boch[=a]r[=i],  of which two volumes are now published: _El-Bokahri, les traditions  islamiques traduites ... par_ O.
