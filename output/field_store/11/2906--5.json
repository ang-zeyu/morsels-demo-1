Coniferous woods as a rule are not as tough as hardwoods,  of which hickory and elm are the best examples.    The torsion or twisting test is useful in determining the  toughness of wood. If the ends of a shaft are turned in opposite  directions, or one end is turned and the other is fixed, all of  the fibres except those at the axis tend to assume the form of  helices. (See Fig. 19.) The strain produced by torsion or  twisting is essentially shear transverse and parallel to the  fibres, combined with longitudinal tension and transverse  compression. Within the elastic limit the strains increase  directly as the distance from the axis of the specimen. The  outer elements are subjected to tensile stresses, and as they  become twisted tend to compress those near the axis. The  elongated elements also contract laterally. Cross sections which  were originally plane become warped. With increasing strain the  lateral adhesion of the outer fibres is destroyed, allowing them  to slide past each other, and reducing greatly their power of  resistance. In this way the strains on the fibres nearer the  axis are progressively increased until finally all of the  elements are sheared apart. It is only in the toughest materials  that the full effect of this action can be observed. (See Fig.  20.) Brittle woods snap off suddenly with only a small amount of  torsion, and their fracture is irregular and oblique to the axis  of the piece instead of frayed out and more nearly perpendicular  to the axis as is the case with tough woods.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Torsion of a shaft.]    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Effect of torsion on different grades  of hickory. _Photo by U. S. Forest Service._]        HARDNESS      The term _hardness_ is used in two senses, namely: (1)  resistance to indentation, and (2) resistance to abrasion or  scratching. In the latter sense hardness combined with toughness  is a measure of the wearing ability of wood and is an important  consideration in the use of wood for floors, paving blocks,  bearings, and rollers. While resistance to indentation is  dependent mostly upon the density of the wood, the wearing  qualities may be governed by other factors such as toughness,  and the size, cohesion, and arrangement of the fibres. In use  for floors, some woods tend to compact and wear smooth, while  others become splintery and rough. This feature is affected to  some extent by the manner in which the wood is sawed; thus  edge-grain pine flooring is much better than flat-sawn for  uniformity of wear.    |-------------------------------------------------------------------|  |                             TABLE XII                             |  |-------------------------------------------------------------------|  |             HARDNESS OF 32 WOODS IN GREEN CONDITION,              |  |            AS INDICATED BY THE LOAD REQUIRED TO IMBED             |  |         A 0.444-INCH STEEL BALL TO ONE-HALF ITS DIAMETER          |  |                     (Forest Service Cir. 213)                     |  |-------------------------------------------------------------------|  | COMMON NAME OF SPECIES | Average |   End   | Radial  | Tangential |  |                        |         | surface | surface |  surface   |  |------------------------+---------+---------+---------+------------|  |                        |  Pounds |  Pounds |  Pounds |   Pounds   |  |                        |         |         |         |            |  |    Hardwoods           |         |         |         |            |  |                        |         |         |         |            |  |  1 Osage orange        |   1,971 |   1,838 |   2,312 |    1,762   |  |  2 Honey locust        |   1,851 |   1,862 |   1,860 |    1,832   |  |  3 Swamp white oak     |   1,174 |   1,205 |   1,217 |    1,099   |  |  4 White oak           |   1,164 |   1,183 |   1,163 |    1,147   |  |  5 Post oak            |   1,099 |   1,139 |   1,068 |    1,081   |  |  6 Black oak           |   1,069 |   1,093 |   1,083 |    1,031   |  |  7 Red oak             |   1,043 |   1,107 |   1,020 |    1,002   |  |  8 White ash           |   1,046 |   1,121 |   1,000 |    1,017   |  |  9 Beech               |     942 |   1,012 |     897 |      918   |  | 10 Sugar maple         |     937 |     992 |     918 |      901   |  | 11 Rock elm            |     910 |     954 |     883 |      893   |  | 12 Hackberry           |     799 |     829 |     795 |      773   |  | 13 Slippery elm        |     788 |     919 |     757 |      687   |  | 14 Yellow birch        |     778 |     827 |     768 |      739   |  | 15 Tupelo              |     738 |     814 |     666 |      733   |  | 16 Red maple           |     671 |     766 |     621 |      626   |  | 17 Sycamore            |     608 |     664 |     560 |      599   |  | 18 Black ash           |     551 |     565 |     542 |      546   |  | 19 White elm           |     496 |     536 |     456 |      497   |  | 20 Basswood            |     239 |     273 |     226 |      217   |  |                        |         |         |         |            |  |    Conifers            |         |         |         |            |  |                        |         |         |         |            |  |  1 Longleaf pine       |    532  |     574 |     502 |      521   |  |  2 Douglas fir         |    410  |     415 |     399 |      416   |  |  3 Bald cypress        |    390  |     460 |     355 |      354   |  |  4 Hemlock             |    384  |     463 |     354 |      334   |  |  5 Tamarack            |    384  |     401 |     380 |      370   |  |  6 Red pine            |    347  |     355 |     345 |      340   |  |  7 White fir           |    346  |     381 |     322 |      334   |  |  8 Western yellow pine |    328  |     334 |     307 |      342   |  |  9 Lodgepole pine      |    318  |     316 |     318 |      319   |  | 10 White pine          |    299  |     304 |     294 |      299   |  | 11 Engelmann pine      |    266  |     272 |     253 |      274   |  | 12 Alpine fir          |    241  |     284 |     203 |      235   |  |-------------------------------------------------------------------|  | NOTE.--Black locust and hickory are not included in this table,   |  | but their position would be near the head of the list.            |  |-------------------------------------------------------------------|    Tests for either form of hardness are of comparative value only.  Tests for indentation are commonly made by penetrations of the  material with a steel punch or ball.[16] Tests for abrasion are  made by wearing down wood with sandpaper or by means of a sand  blast.    [Footnote 16: See articles by Gabriel Janka listed in  bibliography, pages 151-152.]        CLEAVABILITY      _Cleavability_ is the term used to denote the facility with  which wood is split. A splitting stress is one in which the  forces act normally like a wedge. (See Fig. 21.) The plane of  cleavage is parallel to the grain, either radially or  tangentially.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Cleavage of highly elastic wood. The  cleft runs far ahead of the wedge.]    This property of wood is very important in certain uses such as  firewood, fence rails, billets, and squares. Resistance to  splitting or low cleavability is desirable where wood must hold  nails or screws, as in box-making. Wood usually splits more  readily along the radius than parallel to the growth rings  though exceptions occur, as in the case of cross grain.    Splitting involves transverse tension, but only a portion of the  fibres are under stress at a time. A wood of little stiffness  and strong cohesion across the grain is difficult to split,  while one with great stiffness, such as longleaf pine, is easily  split. The form of the grain and the presence of knots greatly  affect this quality.    |---------------------------------------------|  |                 TABLE XIII                  |  |---------------------------------------------|  | CLEAVAGE STRENGTH OF SMALL CLEAR PIECES OF  |  |         32 WOODS IN GREEN CONDITION         |  |          (Forest Service Cir. 213)          |  |---------------------------------------------|  |                   |    When    |    When    |  |   COMMON NAME     | surface of | surface of |  |   OF SPECIES      | failure is | failure is |  |                   |   radial   | tangential |  |-------------------+------------+------------|  |                   |  Lbs. per  |  Lbs. per  |  |                   |  sq. inch  |  sq. inch  |  |                   |            |            |  |    Hardwoods      |            |            |  |                   |            |            |  | Ash, black        |     275    |     260    |  |   white           |     333    |     346    |  | Bashwood          |     130    |     168    |  | Beech             |     339    |     527    |  | Birch, yellow     |     294    |     287    |  | Elm, slippery     |     401    |     424    |  |   white           |     210    |     270    |  | Hackberry         |     422    |     436    |  | Locust, honey     |     552    |     610    |  | Maple, red        |     297    |     330    |  |   sugar           |     376    |     513    |  | Oak, post         |     354    |     487    |  |   red             |     380    |     470    |  |   swamp white     |     428    |     536    |  |   white           |     382    |     457    |  |   yellow          |     379    |     470    |  | Sycamore          |     265    |     425    |  | Tupelo            |     277    |     380    |  |                   |            |            |  |    Conifers       |            |            |  |                   |            |            |  | Arborvitae         |     148    |     139    |  | Cypress, bald     |     167    |     154    |  | Fir, alpine       |     130    |     133    |  |   Douglas         |     139    |     127 "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12327"],[0,"The Jewish Manual (#11)"],[1,"for fowls.           *       *       *       *       *    A NICE METHOD OF DRESSING FOWL AND SWEETBREAD.    Take a fowl and blanch it, also a fine sweet bread, parboil them, then  cut off in smooth well shaped slices, all the white part of the fowl,  and slice the sweetbread in similar pieces, place them together in a  fine well-flavoured veal gravy; when done, serve neatly in the dish,  and pour over a fine white sauce, any that may be approved, the  remainder of the fowl must be cut up in small joints or pieces, not  separated from the bone, and fried to become brown, then place them in  a stew-pan with forcemeat balls, truffles, and morels; pour over half  or three quarters of a pint of beef gravy, and simmer till finished; a  little mushroom ketchup, or lemon-pickle may be added; in this manner  two very nice _entrees_ may be formed.           *       *       *       *       *    BLANKETTE OF FOWL.    See blankette of veal.           *       *       *       *       *    TO STEW DUCK WITH GREEN PEAS.    Stuff and half roast a duck, then put it into a stew-pan with an onion  sliced, a little mint and about one pint of beef gravy, add after it  has simmered half an hour, a quart of green peas, and simmer another  half hour; a little lump sugar is requisite.           *       *       *       *       *    TO WARM COLD POULTRY.    Cut up the pieces required to be dressed, spread over them a seasoning  as for cutlets, and fry them; pour over a little good gravy, and  garnish with sippets of toast and sliced lemon, or place them in an  edging of rice or mashed potatoes.           *       *       *       *       *    BROILED FOWL AND MUSHROOMS.    Truss a fine fowl as if for boiling, split it down the back, and broil  gently; when nearly done, put it in a stewpan with a good gravy, add  a pint of fresh button mushrooms, season to taste; a little mushroom  powder and lemon juice improve the flavour.           *       *       *       *       *    PIGEONS.    To have a good appearance they should be larded and stuffed; glazing  is also an improvement, they form a nice _entree_; they may be stewed  in a strong gravy; when done enough, remove the pigeons, thicken the  gravy, add a few forcemeat and egg balls, and serve in the dish with  the pigeons. Or they may be split down the back, broiled, and then  finished in the stew-pan.           *       *       *       *       *    STEWED GIBLETS.    Scald one or more sets of giblets, set them on the fire with a little  veal or chicken, or both, in a good gravy; season to taste, thicken  the gravy, and color it with browning, flavor with mushroom powder  and lemon-juice and one glass of white wine; forcemeat balls should  be added a few minutes before serving, and garnish with thin slices of  hard boiled eggs.           *       *       *       *       *    DUTCH TOAST.    Take the remains of any cold poultry or meat, mince it and season  highly; add to it any cold dressed vegetable, mix it up with one or  more eggs, and let it simmer till hot in a little gravy; have ready  a square of toast, and serve it on it; squeeze over a little  lemon-juice, and sprinkle with white pepper. Vegetables prepared  in this way are excellent; cauliflower simmered in chicken broth,  seasoned delicately and minced on toast, is a nutritive good luncheon  for an invalid.           *       *       *       *       *    TIMBALE DE MACCARONI.    This is a very pretty dish. The maccaroni must be boiled in water till  it slightly swells, and is soft enough to cut; it must be cut into  short pieces about two inches in length. Grease a mould, and stick the  maccaroni closely together all over the mould; when this is done, and  which will require some patience, fill up the space with friccassee  of chicken, sweetbreads, or whatever may be liked; close the mould  carefully, and boil. Rich white sauce is usually served with it,  but not poured over the timbale, as it would spoil the effect of the  honeycomb appearance, which is very pretty.           *       *       *       *       *    A SAVOURY PIE FOR PERSONS OF DELICATE DIGESTION.    Cut up fowl and sweetbread, lay in the dish in alternate layers with  meat, jelly, and the yolks of hard-boiled eggs without the whites,  and flavor with lemon-juice, white pepper, and salt; cover with rice  prepared as follows: boil half a pound of rice in sufficient water to  permit it to swell; when tender beat it up to a thick paste with the  yolk of one or two eggs, season with a little salt, and spread it over  the dish thickly. The fowl and sweetbread should have been previously  simmered till half done in a little weak broth; the pie must be baked  in a gentle oven, and if the rice will not brown sufficiently, finish  with a salamander.           *       *       *       *       *    DESCAIDES.    Take the livers of chickens or any other poultry; stew it gently in  a little good gravy seasoned with a little onion, mushroom essence,  pepper, and salt; when tender, remove the livers, place them on a  paste board, and mince them; return them to the saucepan, and stir  in the yolks of one or two eggs, according to the quantity of liver,  until the gravy becomes thick; have a round of toast ready on a hot  plate, and serve it on the toast; this is a very nice luncheon or  supper dish.          CHAPTER V.      Vegetables and Sundries.    DIRECTIONS FOR CLEANING AND BOILING VEGETABLES.    Vegetables are extremely nutritious when sufficiently boiled, but are  unwholesome and indigestible when not thoroughly dressed; still they  should not be over boiled, or they will lose their flavor.    Vegetables should be shaken to get out any insects, and laid in water  with a little salt.    Soft water is best suited for boiling vegetables, and they require  plenty of water; a little salt should be put in the saucepan with  them, and the water should almost invariably be boiling when they are  put in.    Potatoes are much better when steamed. Peas and several other  vegetables are also improved by this mode of cooking them, although it  is seldom adopted in England.           *       *       *       *       *    MASHED POTATOES.    Boil till perfectly tender; let them be quite dry, and press them  through a cullender, or mash and beat them well with a fork; add a  piece of butter, and milk, or cream, and continue beating till they  are perfectly smooth; return them to the saucepan to warm, or they may  be browned before the fire. The chief art is to beat them sufficiently  long, which renders them light.    Potatoe balls are mashed potatoes formed into balls glazed with the  yolk of egg, and browned with a salamander.           *       *       *       *       *    POTATO WALL, OR EDGING.    Raise a wall of finely-mashed potatoes, of two or three inches high,  round the dish; form it with a spoon to the shape required, brush it  over with egg, and put it in the oven to become hot and brown; if it  does not brown nicely, use the salamander. Rice is arranged the  same way to edge curries or fricassees; it must be first boiled till  tender.           *       *       *       *       *    POTATOE SHAVINGS.    Take four fine large potatoes, and having peeled them, continue to cut  them up as if peeling them in ribbons of equal width; then throw the  shavings into a frying-pan, and fry of a fine brown; they must be  constantly moved with a silver fork to keep the pieces separate. They  should be laid on a cloth to drain, and placed in the dish lightly.           *       *       *       *       *    THE FRENCH WAY OF DRESSING SPINACH.    Wash and boil till tender, then squeeze and strain it; press it in  a towel till almost dry; put it on a board, and chop it as finely as  possible; then return it to the saucepan, with butter, pepper, and  salt; stir it all the time, and let it boil fast.           *       *       *       *       *    STEWED SPINACH.    Scald and chop some spinach small; cut up an onion; add pepper and  salt and brown sugar, with a little vinegar, stew all together gently;  serve with poached eggs or small forcemeat fritters. This forms a  pretty side-dish, and is also a nice way of dressing spinach to serve  in the same dish with cutlets.           *       *       *       *       *    TO STEW SPANISH BEANS AND PEAS.    Soak the beans over night in cold water; they must be stewed in only  sufficient water to cover them, with two table spoonsful of oil, a  little pepper and salt, and white sugar. When done they should be  perfectly soft and tender.           *       *       *       *       *    PEAS STEWED WITH OIL.    Put half a peck of peas into a stew-pan, half a lettuce chopped small,  a little mint, a small onion cut up, two table-spoonsful of oil, and a  dessert-spoonful of powdered sugar, with water sufficient to cover the  peas, watching, from time to time, that they do not become too  dry; let them stew gently, taking care that they do not burn, till  perfectly soft. When done they should look of a yellowish brown.
