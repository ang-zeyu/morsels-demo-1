[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],[0,"Mr. Justice Raffles (#10)"],[1,"\"    \"Do you mean Mr. Raffles?\"    \"Yes, Miss Belsize; he's the only A.J. that counts!\"    Camilla Belsize turned slightly in the basket-chair to which she had  confided her delicate frock, and our eyes met almost for the first time.  Certainly we had not exchanged so long a look before, for she had been  watching the torpid goldfish in the rockery pool, and I admiring her bold  profile and the querulous poise of a fine head as I tried to argue her  out of all desire for Lord's. Suddenly our eyes met, as I say, and hers  dazzled me; they were soft and yet brilliant, tender and yet cynical,  calmly reckless, audaciously sentimental--all that and more as I see them  now on looking back; but at the time I was merely dazzled.    \"So you and Mr. Raffles are great friends?\" said Miss Belsize, harking  back to a remark of Mr. Garland's in introducing us.    \"Rather!\" I replied.    \"Are you as great a friend of his as Teddy is?\"    I liked that, but simply said I was an older friend. \"Raffles and I were  at school together,\" I added loftily.    \"Really? I should have thought he was before your time.\"    \"No, only senior to me. I happened to be his fag.\"    \"And what sort of a schoolboy was Mr. Raffles?\" inquired Miss Belsize,  not by any means in the tone of a devotee. But I reflected that her own  devotion was bespoke, and not improbably tainted with some little  jealousy of Raffles.    \"He was the most Admirable Crichton who was ever at the school,\" said I:  \"captain of the eleven, the fastest man in the fifteen, athletic  champion, and an ornament of the Upper Sixth.\"    \"And you worshipped him, I suppose?\"    \"Absolutely.\"    My companion had been taking renewed interest in the goldfish; now she  looked at me again with the cynical light full on in her eyes.    \"You must be rather disappointed in him now!\"    \"Disappointed! Why?\" I asked with much outward amusement. But I was  beginning to feel uncomfortable.    \"Of course I don't know much about him,\" remarked Miss Belsize as though  she cared less.    \"But does anybody know anything of Mr. Raffles except as a cricketer?\"    \"I do,\" said I, with injudicious alacrity.    \"Well,\" said Miss Belsize, \"what else is he?\"    \"The best fellow in the world, among other things.\"    \"But what other things?\"    \"Ask Teddy!\" I said unluckily.    \"I have,\" replied Miss Belsize. \"But Teddy doesn't know. He often  wonders how Mr. Raffles can afford to play so much cricket without doing  any work.\"    \"Does he, indeed!\"    \"Many people do.\"    \"And what do they say about him?\"    Miss Belsize hesitated, watching me for a moment and the goldfish rather  longer. The rain sounded louder, and the fountain as though it had been  turned on again, before she answered:    \"More than their prayers, no doubt!\"    \"Do you mean,\" I almost gasped, \"as to the way Raffles gets his living?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You might tell me the kind of things they say, Miss Belsize!\"    \"But if there's no truth in them?\"    \"I'll soon tell you if there is or not.\"    \"But suppose I don't care either way?\" said Miss Belsize with a  brilliant smile.    \"Then I care so much that I should be extremely grateful to you.\"    \"Mind, I don't believe it myself, Mr. Manders.\"    \"You don't believe--\"    \"That Mr. Raffles lives by his wits and--his cricket!\"    I jumped to my feet.    \"Is that all they say about him?\" I cried.    \"Isn't it enough?\" asked Miss Belsize, astonished in her turn at my  demeanour.    \"Oh, quite enough, quite enough!\" said I. \"It's only the most  scandalously unfair and utterly untrue report that ever got  about--that's all!\"    This heavy irony was, of course, intended to convey the impression that  one's first explosion of relief had been equally ironical. But I was to  discover that Camilla Belsize was never easily deceived; it was  unpleasantly apparent in her bold eyes before she opened her firm mouth.    \"Yet you seemed to expect something worse,\" she said at length.    \"What could be worse?\" I asked, my back against the wall of my own  indiscretion. \"Why, a man like A.J. Raffles would rather be any mortal  thing than a paid amateur!\"    \"But you haven't told me what he _is_, Mr. Manders.\"    \"And you haven't told me, Miss Belsize, why you're so interested in A. J.  after all!\" I retorted, getting home for once, and sitting down again on  the strength of it.    But Miss Belsize was my superior to the last; in the single moment of my  ascendency she made me blush for it and for myself. She would be quite  frank with me: my friend Mr. Raffles did interest her rather more than  she cared to say. It was because Teddy thought so much of him, that was  the only reason, and her one excuse for all inquisitive questions and  censorious remarks. I must have thought her very rude; but now I knew.  Mr. Raffles had been such a friend to Teddy; sometimes she wondered  whether he was quite a good friend; and there I had \"the whole thing in a  nutshell.\"    I had indeed! And I knew the nut, and had tasted its bitter kernel too  often to make any mistake about it. Jealousy was its other name. But I  did not care how jealous Miss Belsize became of Raffles as long as  jealousy did not beget suspicion; and my mind was not entirely relieved  on that point.    We dropped the whole subject, however, with some abruptness; and the  rest of our conversation in the rockery, and in the steaming orchid-house  and further vineries which we proceeded to explore together, was quite  refreshingly tame. Yet I think it was on this desultory tour, to the  still incessant accompaniment of rain on the glasshouses, that Camilla's  mother took shape in my mind as the Lady Laura Belsize, an apparently  impecunious widow reduced to \"semi-detachment down the river\" and  suburban neighbours whose manners and customs my companion hit off with  vivacious intolerance. She told me how she had shocked them by smoking  cigarettes in the back garden, and pronounced a gratuitous conviction  that I of all people would have been no less scandalised! That was in the  uttermost vinery, and in another minute two Sullivans were in full blast  under the vines. I remember discovering that the great brand was not  unfamiliar to Miss Belsize, and even gathering that it was Raffles  himself who had made it known to her. Raffles, whom she did not \"know  much about,\" or consider \"quite a good friend\" for Teddy Garland!    I was becoming curious to see this antagonistic pair together; but it was  the middle of the afternoon before Raffles reappeared, though Mr. Garland  told me he had received an optimistic note from him by special messenger  earlier in the day. I felt I might have been told a little more,  considering the intimate part I was already playing as a stranger in a  strange house. But I was only too thankful to find that Raffles had so  far infected our host with his confidence as to tide us through luncheon  with far fewer embarrassments than before; nor did Mr. Garland desert us  again until the butler with a visitor's card brought about his abrupt  departure from the conservatory.    Then my troubles began afresh. It stopped raining at last; if Miss  Belsize could have had her way we should all have started for Lord's that  minute. I took her into the garden to show her the state of the lawns,  coldly scintillant with standing water and rimmed by regular canals.  Lord's would be like them, only fifty times worse; play had no doubt been  abandoned on that quagmire for the day. Miss Belsize was not so sure  about that; why should we not drive over and find out? I said that was  the surest way of missing Teddy. She said a hansom would take us there  and back in a half-an-hour. I gained time disputing that statement, but  said if we went at all I was sure Mr. Garland would want to go with us,  and that in his own brougham. All this on the crown of a sloppy path, and  when Miss Belsize asked me how many more times I was going to change my  ground, I could not help looking at her absurd shoes sinking into the  softened gravel, and saying I thought it was for her to do that. Miss  Belsize took my advice to the extent of turning upon a submerged heel,  though with none too complimentary a smile; and then it was that I saw  what I had been curious to see all day. Raffles was coming down the path  towards us. And I saw Miss Belsize hesitate and stiffen before shaking  hands with him.    \"They've given it up as a bad job at last,\" said he. \"I've just come from  Lord's, and Teddy won't be very long.\"    \"Why didn't you bring him with you?\" asked Miss Belsize pertinently.    \"Well, I thought you ought to know the worst at once,\" said Raffles,  rather lamely for him; \"and then a man playing in a 'Varsity match is  never quite his own master, you know. Still, he oughtn't to keep you  waiting much longer.\"    It was perhaps unfortunately put; at any rate Miss Belsize took it  pretty plainly amiss, and I saw her colour rise as she declared she had  been waiting in the hope of seeing some cricket. Since that was at an  end she must be thinking of getting home, and would just say good-bye to  Mr. Garland. This sudden decision took me as much by surprise as I  believe it took Miss Belsize herself; but having announced her  intention, however hot-headedly, she proceeded to action by way of the  conservatory and the library door, while Raffles and I went through into  the hall the other way.    \"I'm afraid I've put my foot in it,\" said he to me. \"But it's just as  well, since I needn't tell you there's no sign of Teddy up at Lord's.\"    \"Have you been there all day?\" I asked him under my breath.    \"Except when I went to the office of this rag,\" replied Raffles,  brandishing an evening paper that ill deserved his epithet. \"See what  they say about Teddy here.\"    And I held my breath while Raffles showed me a stupendous statement in  the stop-press column: it was to the effect that E.M. Garland (Eton and  Trinity) might be unable to keep wicket for Cambridge"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/984"],[0,"Who Was Who: 5000 B. C. to Date (#10)"],[1,"No Bonaparte.
