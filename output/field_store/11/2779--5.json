Administration is carried out through consultative member meetings--the 17th    Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was in Venice in November 1992.    Currently, there are 41 treaty member nations: 26 consultative and 15    acceding. Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations that claim    portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims overlap) and 19    nonclaimant nations. The US and some other nations that have made no claims    have reserved the right to do so. The US does not recognize the claims of    others. The year in parentheses indicates when an acceding nation was voted    to full consultative (voting) status, while no date indicates the country    was an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations are--Argentina,    Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant    consultative nations are--Belgium, Brazil (1983), China (1985), Ecuador    (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy (1987), Japan,    South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland (1977), South    Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay (1985), the US, and Russia.    Acceding (nonvoting) members, with year of accession in parentheses,    are--Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978), Canada (1988), Colombia (1988), Cuba    (1984), Czechoslovakia (1962), Denmark (1965), Greece (1987), Guatemala    (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania    (1971), Switzerland (1990), and Ukraine (1992).   Article 1:    area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity, such as    weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel and equipment may be    used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose   Article 2:    freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation shall continue   Article 3:    free exchange of information and personnel in cooperation with the UN and    other international agencies   Article 4:    does not recognize, dispute, or establish territorial claims and no new    claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force   Article 5:    prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes   Article 6:    includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees 00    minutes south   Article 7:    treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial observation, to    any area and may inspect all stations, installations, and equipment; advance    notice of all activities and of the introduction of military personnel must    be given   Article 8:    allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own states   Article 9:    frequent consultative meetings take place among member nations    *Antarctica, Government     Article 10:    treaty states will discourage activities by any country in Antarctica that    are contrary to the treaty   Article 11:    disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or, ultimately,    by the ICJ   Article 12, 13, 14:    deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved    nations   Other agreements:    more than 170 recommendations adopted at treaty consultative meetings and    ratified by governments include - Agreed Measures for the Conservation of    Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964); Convention for the Conservation of    Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine    Living Resources (1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988    but was subsequently rejected; in 1991 the Protocol on Environmental    Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was signed and awaits ratification; this    agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment through    five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna, and flora, environmental    impact assessments, waste management, and protected areas; it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/871"],[0,"The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, with the Hymn of Cleanthes (#10)"],[1,"aught of evil omen save that which signifies some  evil thing? Cowardice is a word of evil omen, if thou wilt, and meanness  of spirit, and lamentation and mourning, and shamelessness. . . .    But do not, I pray thee, call of evil omen a word that is significant of  any natural thing:--as well call of evil omen the reaping of the corn;  for that means the destruction of the ears, though not of the World!--as  well say that the fall of the leaf is of evil omen; that the dried fig  should take the place of the green; that raisins should be made from  grapes. All these are changes from a former state into another; not  destruction, but an ordered economy, a fixed administration. Such  is leaving home, a change of small account; such is Death, a greater  change, from what now is, not to what is not, but to what is not now.    \"Shall I then no longer be?\"    Not so; thou wilt be; but something different, of which the World now  hath need. For thou too wert born not when thou chosest, but when the  World had need of thee.          CXXXI    Wherefore a good man and true, bearing in mind who he is and whence he  came and from whom he sprang, cares only how he may fill his post with  due discipline and obedience to God.    Wilt thou that I continue to live? Then will I live, as one that is  free and noble, as Thou wouldst have me. For Thou hast made me free from  hindrance in what appertaineth unto me. But hast Thou no further need  of me? I thank Thee! Up to this hour have I stayed for Thy sake and none  other's: and now in obedience to Thee I depart.    \"How dost thou depart?\"    Again I say, as Thou wouldst have me; as one that is free, as Thy  servant, as one whose ear is open unto what Thou dost enjoin, what Thou  dost forbid.          CXXXII    Whatsoever place or post Thou assignest me, sooner will I die a thousand  deaths, as Socrates said, than desert it. And where wilt Thou have me to  be? At Rome or Athens? At Thebes or on a desert island? Only remember me  there! Shouldst Thou send me where man cannot live as Nature would have  him, I will depart, not in disobedience to Thee, but as though Thou wert  sounding the signal for my retreat: I am not deserting Thee--far be that  from me! I only perceive that thou needest me no longer.          CXXXIII    If you are in Gyaros, do not let your mind dwell upon life at Rome,  and all the pleasures it offered to you when living there, and all that  would attend your return. Rather be intent on this--how he that lives in  Gyaros may live in Gyaros like a man of spirit. And if you are at Rome,  do not let your mind dwell upon the life at Athens, but study only how  to live at Rome.    Finally, in the room of all other pleasures put this--the pleasure which  springs from conscious obedience to God.          CXXXIV    To a good man there is no evil, either in life or death. And if God  supply not food, has He not, as a wise Commander, sounded the signal  for retreat and nothing more? I obey, I follow--speaking good of my  Commander, and praising His acts. For at His good pleasure I came; and I  depart when it pleases Him; and while I was yet alive that was my work,  to sing praises unto God!          CXXXV    Reflect that the chief source of all evils to Man, and of baseness and  cowardice, is not death, but the fear of death.    Against this fear then, I pray you, harden yourself; to this let all  your reasonings, your exercises, your reading tend. Then shall you know  that thus alone are men set free.          CXXXVI    He is free who lives as he wishes to live; to whom none can do violence,  none hinder or compel; whose impulses are unimpeded, whose desires are  attain their purpose, who falls not into what he would avoid. Who then  would live in error?--None. Who would live deceived and prone to fall,  unjust, intemperate, in abject whining at his lot?--None. Then doth no  wicked man live as he would, and therefore neither is he free.          CXXXVII    Thus do the more cautious of travellers act. The road is said to be  beset by robbers. The traveller will not venture alone, but awaits the  companionship on the road of an ambassador, a quaestor or a proconsul.  To him he attaches himself and thus passes by in safety. So doth the  wise man in the world. Many are the companies of robbers and tyrants,  many the storms, the straits, the losses of all a man holds dearest.  Whither shall he fall for refuge--how shall he pass by unassailed? What  companion on the road shall he await for protection? Such and such a  wealthy man, of consular rank? And how shall I be profited, if he  is stripped and falls to lamentation and weeping? And how if my  fellow-traveller himself turns upon me and robs me? What am I to do? I  will become a friend of Caesar's! in his train none will do me wrong! In  the first place--O the indignities I must endure to win distinction! O  the multitude of hands there will be to rob me! And if I succeed, Caesar  too is but a mortal. While should it come to pass that I offend him,  whither shall I flee from his presence? To the wilderness? And may not  fever await me there? What then is to be done? Cannot a fellow-traveller  be found that is honest and loyal, strong and secure against surprise?  Thus doth the wise man reason, considering that if he would pass through  in safety, he must attach himself unto God.          CXXXVIII    \"How understandest thou attach himself to God?\"    That what God wills, he should will also; that what God wills not,  neither should he will.    \"How then may this come to pass?\"    By considering the movements of God, and His administration.          CXXXIX    And dost thou that hast received all from another's hands, repine and  blame the Giver, if He takes anything from thee? Why, who art thou, and  to what end comest thou here? was it not He that made the Light manifest  unto thee, that gave thee fellow-workers, and senses, and the power to  reason? And how brought He thee into the world? Was it not as one  born to die; as one bound to live out his earthly life in some small  tabernacle of flesh; to behold His administration, and for a little  while share with Him in the mighty march of this great Festival  Procession? Now therefore that thou hast beheld, while it was permitted  thee, the Solemn Feast and Assembly, wilt thou not cheerfully depart,  when He summons thee forth, with adoration and thanksgiving for what  thou hast seen and heard?--\"Nay, but I would fain have stayed longer at  the Festival.\"--Ah, so would the mystics fain have the rites prolonged;  so perchance would the crowd at the Great Games fain behold more  wrestlers still. But the Solemn Assembly is over! Come forth, depart  with thanksgiving and modesty--give place to others that must come into  being even as thyself.          CXL    Why art thou thus insatiable? why thus unreasonable? why encumber  the world?--\"Aye, but I fain would have my wife and children with me  too.\"--What, are they then thine, and not His that gave them--His that  made thee? Give up then that which is not thine own: yield it to One who  is better than thou. \"Nay, but why did He bring one into the world on  these conditions?\"--If it suits thee not, depart! He hath no need of a  spectator who finds fault with his lot! Them that will take part in the  Feast he needeth--that will lift their voices with the rest that men  may applaud the more, and exalt the Great Assembly in hymns and songs  of praise. But the wretched and the fearful He will not be displeased to  see absent from it: for when they were present, they did not behave  as at a Feast, nor fulfil their proper office; but moaned as though  in pain, and found fault with their fate, their fortune and their  companions; insensible to what had fallen to their lot, insensible to  the powers they had received for a very different purpose--the powers of  Magnanimity, Nobility of Heart, of Fortitude, or Freedom!          CXLI    Art thou then free? a man may say. So help me heaven, I long and pray  for freedom! But I cannot look my masters boldly in the face; I still  value the poor body; I still set much store on its preservation whole  and sound.    But I can point thee out a free man, that thou mayest be no more in  search of an example. Diogenes was free. How so? Not because he was of  free parentage (for that, indeed, was not the case), but because he was  himself free. He had cast away every handle whereby slavery might lay  hold of him to enslave him, nor was it possible for any to approach  and take hold of him to enslave him. All things sat loose upon him--all  things were to him attached by but slender ties. Hadst thou seized upon  his possessions, he would rather have let them go than have followed  thee for them--aye, had it been even a limb, or mayhap his whole body;  and in like manner, relatives, friends, and country. For he knew whence  they came--from whose hands and on what terms he had received them.  His true forefathers, the Gods, his true Country, he never would  have abandoned; nor would he have yielded to any man in obedience and  submission to the one nor in cheerfully dying for the other. For he  was ever mindful that everything that comes to pass has its source and  origin there; being indeed brought about for the weal of that his true  Country, and directed by Him in whose governance it is.          CXLII    Ponder on this--on these convictions, on these words: fix thine eyes on  these examples, if thou wouldst be free, if thou hast thine heart set  upon the matter according to its worth. And what marvel if thou purchase  so great a thing at so great and high a price? For the sake of this that  men deem liberty, some hang themselves, others cast themselves down from  the rock; aye, time has been when whole cities came utterly to an end:  while for the sake of Freedom that is true, and sure, and unassailable,  dost thou grudge to God what He gave, when He claims it? Wilt thou not  study, as Plato"]]]
