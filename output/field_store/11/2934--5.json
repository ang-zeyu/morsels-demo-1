[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12928"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 1 (#11)"],[1,"of the country beyond them, presented a very different appearance  from that through which we had passed. A gently sloping extremity lay  before us for eight miles in the direction of our proposed route, and we  were relieved from all the difficulties of crossing gullies, which had  impeded our ascent on the other side of the range. We encamped at some  waterholes, where this slope terminated in an extensive forest flat; over  the whole of which, as my sable guide informed me, there was no other  water at that time.    The grass on this side of the hills was good: and almost all the timber  consisted of box (eucalyptus). The heights which we had crossed appeared  to extend from the Liverpool range to the northward, as far as could be  seen; but the native told me, that it soon terminated on the river  Callala (or Peel) whose course, he said, turned westward (as he pointed);  a fact corroborating so far, the statements of The Bushranger.    ARRIVE ON THE RIVER PEEL.    December 11.    The weather cleared up at about six A.M.: and we travelled across a good  soil, throughout the whole of this day's journey. The country appeared  but thinly wooded, and without any hill or watercourse. After a journey  of thirteen miles, we reached the bank of the Peel at Wallamoul, the  lowest cattle station upon this river. It was occupied by Mr. Brown, who  had there about 1600 head of cattle. I gave to Jemmy, our excellent  guide, the promised tomahawk, also a knife to Monday his brother, whom he  met here. The river was so low that Mr. White and I passed over easily on  a tree which the flood had laid across it. The current however was  strong; and the men having been furnished from our stock with a few hooks  and lines, caught three large fishes by sunset. I met, at this place,  with some intelligent natives, from whom I learnt, that the spot where  Mr. Oxley crossed the Peel on his journey, was about two miles lower  down.    FISHES.    December 12.    At an early hour this morning, one of our men caught a fish, which  weighed eighteen pounds; but, according to the natives, this was no  uncommon size. These fishes are most erroneously called cod by the  colonists, although they certainly very much resemble cod in taste. The  flakes are firmer than sea cod, and equally white, the fish affording a  very light and palatable food. When dried in the same manner as the  Newfoundland cod, in which state I have tasted this fish at Bathurst, I  could not perceive any difference either in flavour or appearance.    Being at length about to enter the Terra incognita, I deemed it expedient  to repack our stores, in order that the load might be made as light and  compact as possible, and that we might pass with less difficulty over  whatever description of ground we were destined to encounter. With this  view, I directed the flour to be started from casks into bags, and made  such arrangements as tended materially to lessen the bulk of our  provisions and other necessary stores. Having questioned the natives with  regard to the course of the Peel, I learnt that, instead of flowing  northward, as hitherto supposed, it took a westerly direction, and was  soon joined by the Muluerindie, a river coming from the north-east. The  natives further assured me that there was a good ford below the junction  of these streams at a place called Wallanburra; and I determined to  proceed to this ford, as it was not advisable, with the Muluerindie  beyond, to cross the river above the junction.    ANOTHER NATIVE GUIDE.    Being anxious to procure another guide, the overseer at Wallamoul brought  me a native named Mr. Brown, who agreed to accompany our party on  condition that he should receive blankets for himself and his gin, and a  tomahawk, the latter being a small hatchet, which is so valuable a  substitute for their stone hatchet that almost all natives within reach  of the colony have them, even where the white man is known as yet only by  name--or as the manufacturer of this most important of all implements to  the Australian native.    EXPLORE THE PEEL.    December 13.    Mr. Finch having joined us on the previous evening, without procuring the  supply of flour that I had expected, I despatched him back this morning  to the Hunter's River district, with directions to procure as much flour,  tea, and sugar as he could pack on six bullocks, and to follow along my  line of marked trees with all possible speed. I furnished him with an  official letter to Mr. Dixon, in which I instructed that surveyor to  supply him with any article he could possibly spare from his own  equipment, without impeding the service on which he was engaged.    And now our arrangements being as complete as we could hope to make them,  under existing circumstances, we broke up our encampment at eight A.M.,  and proceeded in the interesting pursuit of the course of the Peel River.

We advanced with feelings of intense interest into the country before us,  and impressed with the responsibility of commencing the first chapter of  its history. All was still new and nameless, but by this beginning, we  were to open a way for the many other beginnings of civilised man, and  thus extend his dominion over some of the last holds of barbarism.    SITUATION OF MR. OXLEY'S CAMP ON THE PEEL.    About a mile and a half below Wallamoul, we crossed a small open plain,  and I was informed that Mr. Oxley encamped on its southern side, and had  afterwards forded the Peel at no great distance from the spot.    WESTWARD COURSE OF THE RIVER.    We crossed a succession of gentle slopes, without any gully or  watercourse between them. After travelling about eight miles in a  north-west direction, we came upon the Peel, having thus cut off a great  bend of the river. From that point our route was west and even to the  southward of west, until we again encamped near the river, after a  journey of fifteen miles. Some flats crossed by the party this day  appeared to be subject to inundations. One gully only had impeded our  carts. It was about a mile short of the encampment, and it was called  Goora by the natives. It had evidently been long dry, had steep banks,  and its bottom consisted of gravel and sand. The banks of the Peel, thus  far, are composed chiefly of extensive flats of good land, thinly wooded,  and occasionally flooded by the river.    Only a few of the flats however are quite clear of trees, but where the  ground is open, the soil appears to be rich, and presents the same  characters which I noticed elsewhere. We saw a numerous family of  kangaroos this day, but although the dogs were let loose, such was the  length of the grass, that they could not see the game. The morning had  been clear, but the sky in the afternoon was overcast by a thunderstorm,  with a strong gale of wind. At sunset, the weather cleared up, and the  sky became again serene.    December 14.    The sun rose clear, and the party were in motion at seven o'clock. This  day I discovered that the native had sent back his gin early in the  morning, a circumstance which I regretted, for the woman had an  intelligent countenance, and having been brought from the country towards  which we were travelling, she might have been of service to us.    KANGAROO SHOT.    When we had proceeded a few miles, the quick eye of Mr. Brown  distinguished the head of a kangaroo peeping at us over the long grass.  On discharging my rifle at it, the animal, as he supposed, bounded off;  but as I had taken very steady aim, I ran to the spot, and there found,  to the astonishment of our guide, the kangaroo at which I had aimed lying  dead, the ball having passed through the throat and neck. The kangaroo  which leapt about on the discharge of the piece, was another which had  not been previously in sight, and appeared to have been the mate of that  which fell. The distance was considerable, and the shot fortunate, as  being well calculated to strengthen Mr. Brown's confidence, who had only  seen previously the heavy old muskets carried by stockmen. He surveyed  with great attention the percussion lock and heavier barrel of the rifle,  surprised, no doubt, at its superior make and accuracy.    Our course was still westward, and thus we occasionally touched upon the  bends of the river. Adjacent to one sharp angle, we met with a rather  singular formation of little hills formed by projecting strata, the  strike extending in the direction of North 30 West, and the dip being to  the east, at an angle of about 30 degrees.    CALCAREOUS ROCKS.    The rock appeared to consist in some parts of a buff calcareous  sandstone, calcareous tuff; and, more abundantly, of limestone of a  peculiar aspect, presenting at first sight the appearance of porphyry,  but consisting of a base of compact limestone, with disseminated portions  of calcareous spar, principally due to fragments of crinoidea. At a lower  part in the same rock, less compact, I found a beautiful chalcedonic  cast, apparently of a terebra. The calcareous sandstone consisted of  grains of quartz cemented by calcareous spar, and contained"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12929"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 1 (#11)"],[1," a mile or two of the shore; when there was only twelve feet; and  the surf which rolled in, made it impossible to land. The country round  the bay is described as level and open, and of an agreeable aspect.    On the return of the boat the ships weighed, and stretched southward  until June 27, at noon. The latitude was then 9 deg. 1'; and a sand bank was  seen from the mast head, bearing S. W. 1/2 W. They then wore to the  north-eastward; and continued upon that course until the 28th, at dusk;  when the land of New Guinea being in sight as far as E. by N., the same,  apparently, which had been set from the anchorage on the 26th, they  stretched off till two in the morning and then in again, towards the  land.    Captain Bampton had followed the coast of New Guinea thus far, in the  hope of finding a passage to the northward, between it and Louisiade; but  the trending of the land so far to the east, and the difficulty of  weathering it, from the current being adverse, obliged him to give up  that hope. A consultation was then held; and a determination made to  attempt the passage through the middle of Torres' Strait.    At the time the ships hauled their wind to the southward, the latitude  was 8 deg. 3'; the longitude, from three distances of the sun and moon, 145 deg.  23'; and the depth of water 40 fathoms, on a muddy bottom. They had no  soundings from that time to July 1, at one a.m.; when there was 35  fathoms. At daylight, land, which was the _Darnley's Island_ of captain  Bligh, bore S. W. by S. seven or eight leagues; a dry sand was seen in  the W. N. W., (probably W. S. W.); and a reef, which appears to have been  that of Anchor Key, was six or seven miles distant in the S. E. At four  in the afternoon, when Darnley's Island bore W. by N. 1/2 N. five leagues,  and Murray's Island S. E. 1/2 E. (probably S. S. E. 1/2 E.) the ships  anchored in 22 fathoms, marly bottom; and the boats were sent towards the  first Island to sound, and see if it were inhabited. The latitude  observed at this anchorage, was 9 deg. 40' south, and longitude from three  distances of the sun and moon 142 deg. 58' 30\" east.    July 2. The boats returned. Between the ships and the island, they had  passed over five different reefs, separated by narrow channels of 11 to  14 fathoms deep. The natives of the island came down in considerable  numbers; and exchanged some bows and arrows, for knives and other  articles. They were stout men; and somewhat above the common size of  Europeans. Except in colour, which was not of so deep a cast, they bore  much resemblance to the natives of Port Jackson; and had scars raised  upon their bodies in the same manner. The men were entirely naked; but  the women, who kept at a distance and appeared small in size, wore an  apron of leaves, reaching down, to the knee. Many cocoa-nut trees were  seen in the lower parts of the island.    When the boats returned, they were followed by four canoes. One of them  went along-side of the Chesterfield; and an Indian ventured on board, on  a sailor going into the canoe, as a hostage for him. Most of these people  had their ears perforated. The hair was generally cut short; but some few  had it flowing loose. It is naturally black; but from being rubbed with  something, it had a reddish, or burnt appearance. These Indians, so far  as they could he understood, represented their island to abound in  refreshments; and it was, therefore, determined to send another boat to  make further examination.    July 3. Mr. Shaw, chief mate of the Chesterfield, Mr. Carter, and captain  Hill of the New-South-Wales corps, who was a passenger, went away armed,  with five seamen in a whale boat; and were expected to return on the  following day; but the 4th, 5th, and 6th, passed, without any tidings of  them; although many signal guns had been fired.    On the 7th, two boats, manned and armed, under the command of Mr. Dell,  chief mate of the Hormuzeer, were sent in search of the whale boat. On  reaching the island, Mr. Dell heard conch shells sounding in different  parts; and saw eighty or ninety armed natives upon the shore. To the  inquiries, by signs, after the missing boat, they answered that she was  gone to the westward; but none of them would venture near; nor did they  pay attention to a white handkerchief which was held up, and had before  been considered a signal of peace.    As the boats proceeded in their search, round the island, the natives  followed along the shore, with increasing numbers. One man, who was  rubbed with something blue, and appeared to be a chief, had a small axe  in his hand; which was known, from the red helve, to have belonged to Mr.  Shaw. On reaching the bay in the north-west side of the island, Mr. Dell  remarked that the natives disappeared; all except about thirty, who were  very anxious in persuading him to land. They brought down women; and made  signs, that the boat and people whom he sought, were a little way up in  the island. He, however, rowed onward; when the beach was immediately  crowded with people, who had been lying in ambush, expecting him to land.    After having gone entirely round the island, and seen nothing of the  object of his research, Mr. Dell returned to the first cove; where a  great concourse of natives, armed with bows, arrows, clubs, and lances,  were assembled at the outskirt of the wood. By offering knives and other  things, a few were induced to approach the boat; and the coxswain seized  one of them by the hair and neck, with the intention of his being taken  off to the ships, to give an account of the missing boat and people. A  shower of arrows instantly came out of the wood; and a firing was  commenced, which killed one Indian, and wounded some others. In the mean  time, the coxswain found it impossible to keep the man, from his hair and  body being greased; and the boat's crew was too much occupied to assist  him.    July 8. The two commanders having heard the report of Mr. Dell, proceeded  with the ships, round the northern reefs and sand banks, to the bay on  the north-west side of Darnley's Island, which was named _Treacherous  Bay_. On the 9th, in the afternoon, they anchored with springs on the  cables, in 13 fathoms, sand, mud, and shells; the extremes of the island  bearing E. 1/2 N. to S. W. by S., and the nearest part distant a quarter of  a mile. A boat was sent on shore; and returned, at sunset, with a few  cocoa nuts; but without having seen any of the inhabitants.    July 10. An armed party of forty-four men landed from the ships, under  the command of Mr. Dell. After hoisting the union jack, and taking  possession of this, and the neighbouring islands and coast of New Guinea,  in the name of His Majesty, they examined the huts, and found the great  coats of captain Hill, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Shaw; with several other  things which had belonged to them, and to the boats' crew; so that no  doubt was entertained of their having been murdered. In the evening, the  party arrived from making the tour of the island; having burnt and  destroyed one-hundred-and-thirty-five huts; sixteen canoes, measuring  from fifty to seventy feet in length; and various plantations of sugar  cane. The natives appeared to have retired to the hills in the centre of  the island; as not one of them could be discovered.    Darnley's Island was judged to be about fifteen miles in circumference.  It is variegated with hills and plains; and the richness of the  vegetation bespoke it to be very fertile; it appeared, however, to be  scantily supplied with fresh water, there being only one small place  where it was found near the shore. The plantations of the natives, which  were extensive and numerous in the plains, contained yams, sweet  potatoes, plantains, and sugar canes, inclosed within neat fences of  bamboo; and cocoa-nut trees were very abundant particularly near the  habitations. The hills, which mostly occupy the middle of the island,  were covered with trees and bushes of a luxuriant growth; and upon  different parts of the shores, the mangrove was produced in great plenty.    The habitations of the Indians were generally placed at the heads of the  small coves; and formed into villages of ten or twelve huts each,  inclosed within a bamboo fence of, at least, twelve feet high. The hut  much resembles a haycock, with a pole driven through it; and may contain  a family of six or eight people. The covering is of long grass, and cocoa  leaves. The entrance is small; and so low, that the inhabitants must  creep in and out; but the inside was was clean and neat; and the pole  that supports the roof, was painted red, apparently with ochre.    In each of the huts, and usually on the right hand side going in, were  suspended two or three human skulls; and several strings of hands, five  or six on a string. These were hung round a wooden image, rudely carved  into the representation of a man, or of some bird; and painted and  decorated in a curious manner: the feathers of the Emu or Cassuary  generally formed one of the ornaments. In one hut, containing much the  greater number of skulls, a kind of gum was found burning before one of  these images. This hut was adjoining to another, of a different form, and  much more capacious than any of the others. The length was thirty feet,  by fifteen in breadth; and the floor was raised six feet from the ground.  The hut was very neatly built of bamboo, supported by long stakes, and  thatched with cocoa leaves and dried grass. It was judged to be the  residence of the chief of the island; and was the sole hut in which there  were no skulls or hands; but the adjoining one had more than a double  proportion.    The corpse of a man, who had been shot, was found disposed of in the  following manner. Six stakes were driven into the ground; about three  feet from each other, and six feet high. A platform of twigs was worked  upon them, at the height of five feet; and upon this, the body"]]]
