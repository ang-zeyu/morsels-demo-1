But Pencroft assured him  that that would be a useless course, that in the darkness and deplorable  weather he could not find any traces of Neb, and that it would be much  better to wait. If Neb had not made his appearance by the next day,  Pencroft would not hesitate to join him in his search.    Gideon Spilett approved of the sailor's opinion that it was best not to  divide, and Herbert was obliged to give up his project; but two large  tears fell from his eyes.    The reporter could not refrain from embracing the generous boy.    Bad weather now set in. A furious gale from the southeast passed over  the coast. The sea roared as it beat over the reef. Heavy rain was  dashed by the storm into particles like dust. Ragged masses of vapor  drove along the beach, on which the tormented shingles sounded as if  poured out in cart-loads, while the sand raised by the wind added as  it were mineral dust to that which was liquid, and rendered the united  attack insupportable. Between the river's mouth and the end of the  cliff, eddies of wind whirled and gusts from this maelstrom lashed the  water which ran through the narrow valley. The smoke from the fireplace  was also driven back through the opening, filling the passages and  rendering them uninhabitable.    Therefore, as the grouse were cooked, Pencroft let the fire die away,  and only preserved a few embers buried under the ashes.    At eight o'clock Neb had not appeared, but there was no doubt that the  frightful weather alone hindered his return, and that he must have  taken refuge in some cave, to await the end of the storm or at least the  return of day. As to going to meet him, or attempting to find him, it  was impossible.    The game constituted the only dish at supper; the meat was excellent,  and Pencroft and Herbert, whose long excursion had rendered them very  hungry, devoured it with infinite satisfaction.    Their meal concluded, each retired to the corner in which he had rested  the preceding night, and Herbert was not long in going to sleep near the  sailor, who had stretched himself beside the fireplace.    Outside, as the night advanced, the tempest also increased in strength,  until it was equal to that which had carried the prisoners from Richmond  to this land in the Pacific. The tempests which are frequent during the  seasons of the equinox, and which are so prolific in catastrophes, are  above all terrible over this immense ocean, which opposes no obstacle to  their fury. No description can give an idea of the terrific violence of  the gale as it beat upon the unprotected coast.    Happily the pile of rocks which formed the Chimneys was solid. It was  composed of enormous blocks of granite, a few of which, insecurely  balanced, seemed to tremble on their foundations, and Pencroft could  feel rapid quiverings under his head as it rested on the rock. But he  repeated to himself, and rightly, that there was nothing to fear, and  that their retreat would not give way. However he heard the noise of  stones torn from the summit of the plateau by the wind, falling down on  to the beach. A few even rolled on to the upper part of the Chimneys,  or flew off in fragments when they were projected perpendicularly. Twice  the sailor rose and intrenched himself at the opening of the passage, so  as to take a look in safety at the outside. But there was nothing to be  feared from these showers, which were not considerable, and he returned  to his couch before the fireplace, where the embers glowed beneath the  ashes.    Notwithstanding the fury of the hurricane, the uproar of the tempest,  the thunder, and the tumult, Herbert slept profoundly. Sleep at last  took possession of Pencroft, whom a seafaring life had habituated to  anything. Gideon Spilett alone was kept awake by anxiety. He reproached  himself with not having accompanied Neb. It was evident that he had not  abandoned all hope. The presentiments which had troubled Herbert did not  cease to agitate him also. His thoughts were concentrated on Neb. Why  had Neb not returned? He tossed about on his sandy couch, scarcely  giving a thought to the struggle of the elements. Now and then, his  eyes, heavy with fatigue, closed for an instant, but some sudden thought  reopened them almost immediately.    Meanwhile the night advanced, and it was perhaps two hours from morning,  when Pencroft, then sound asleep, was vigorously shaken.    \"What's the matter?\" he cried, rousing himself, and collecting his ideas  with the promptitude usual to seamen.    The reporter was leaning over him, and saying,--    \"Listen, Pencroft, listen!\"    The sailor strained his ears, but could hear no noise beyond those  caused by the storm.    \"It is the wind,\" said he.    \"No,\" replied Gideon Spilett, listening again, \"I thought I heard--\"    \"What?\"    \"The barking of a dog!\"    \"A dog!\" cried Pencroft, springing up.    \"Yes--barking--\"    \"It's not possible!\" replied the sailor. \"And besides, how, in the  roaring of the storm--\"    \"Stop--listen--\" said the reporter.    Pencroft listened more attentively, and really thought he heard, during  a lull, distant barking.    \"Well!\" said the reporter, pressing the sailor's hand.    \"Yes--yes!\" replied Pencroft.    \"It is Top! It is Top!\" cried Herbert, who had just awoke; and all three  rushed towards the opening of the Chimneys. They had great difficulty in  getting out. The wind drove them back. But at last they succeeded, and  could only remain standing by leaning against the rocks. They looked  about, but could not speak. The darkness was intense. The sea, the sky,  the land were all mingled in one black mass. Not a speck of light was  visible.    The reporter and his companions remained thus for a few minutes,  overwhelmed by the wind, drenched by the rain, blinded by the sand.    Then, in a pause of the tumult, they again heard the barking, which they  found must be at some distance.    It could only be Top! But was he alone or accompanied? He was most  probably alone, for, if Neb had been with him, he would have made  his way more directly towards the Chimneys. The sailor squeezed the  reporter's hand, for he could not make himself heard, in a way which  signified \"Wait!\" then he reentered the passage.    An instant after he issued with a lighted fagot, which he threw into the  darkness, whistling shrilly.    It appeared as if this signal had been waited for; the barking  immediately came nearer, and soon a dog bounded into the passage.  Pencroft, Herbert, and Spilett entered after him.    An armful of dry wood was thrown on the embers. The passage was lighted  up with a bright flame.    \"It is Top!\" cried Herbert.    It was indeed Top, a magnificent Anglo-Norman, who derived from these  two races crossed the swiftness of foot and the acuteness of smell which  are the preeminent qualities of coursing dogs. It was the dog of the  engineer, Cyrus Harding. But he was alone! Neither Neb nor his master  accompanied him!    How was it that his instinct had guided him straight to the Chimneys,  which he did not know? It appeared inexplicable, above all, in the  midst of this black night and in such a tempest! But what was still more  inexplicable was, that Top was neither tired, nor exhausted, nor even  soiled with mud or sand!--Herbert had drawn him towards him, and was  patting his head, the dog rubbing his neck against the lad's hands.    \"If the dog is found, the master will be found also!\" said the reporter.    \"God grant it!\" responded Herbert. \"Let us set off! Top will guide us!\"    Pencroft did not make any objection. He felt that Top's arrival  contradicted his conjectures. \"Come along then!\" said he.    Pencroft carefully covered the embers on the hearth. He placed a few  pieces of wood among them, so as to keep in the fire until their return.  Then, preceded by the dog, who seemed to invite them by short barks to  come with him, and followed by the reporter and the boy, he dashed out,  after having put up in his handkerchief the remains of the supper.    The storm was then in all its violence, and perhaps at its height. Not a  single ray of light from the moon pierced through the clouds. To follow  a straight course was difficult. It was best to rely on Top's instinct.  They did so. The reporter and Herbert walked behind the dog, and the  sailor brought up the rear. It was impossible to exchange a word. The  rain was not very heavy, but the wind was terrific.    However, one circumstance favored the seaman and his two companions. The  wind being southeast, consequently blew on their backs. The clouds of  sand, which otherwise would have been insupportable, from being received  behind, did not in consequence impede their progress. In short, they  sometimes went faster than they liked, and had some difficulty in  keeping their feet; but hope gave them strength, for it was not at  random that they made their way along the shore. They had no doubt that  Neb had found his master, and that he had sent them the faithful dog.  But was the engineer living, or had Neb only sent for his companions  that they might render the last duties to the corpse of the unfortunate  Harding?    After having passed the precipice, Herbert, the reporter, and Pencroft  prudently stepped aside to stop and take breath. The turn of the rocks  sheltered them from the wind, and they could breathe after this walk or  rather run of a quarter of an hour.    They could now hear and reply to each other, and the lad having  pronounced the name of Cyrus Harding, Top gave a few short barks, as  much as to say that his master was saved.    \"Saved, isn't he?\" repeated Herbert; \"saved, Top?\"    And the dog barked in reply.    They once more set out. The tide began to rise, and urged by the wind it  threatened to be unusually high, as it was a spring tide. Great billows  thundered against the reef with such violence that they probably passed  entirely over the islet, then quite invisible."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12680"],[0,"Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People (#11)"],[1," the breeze.    \"Aw-aw-aw-aw-aw-awl silk.\" Mrs. Jacobs's fingers smoothed it lovingly,  then it was drawn within to be instantly replaced by a green dress.  Mrs. Jacobs passed the skirt slowly through her fingers.  \"Aw-aw-aw-aw-aw-awl silk!\" she quavered mockingly.    By this time Mrs. Isaacs's face was the color of the latest flag of  victory.    \"The tallyman!\" she tried to retort, but the words stuck in her throat.  Fortunately just then she caught sight of her poor lamb playing with the  other poor lamb. She dashed at her offspring, boxed its ears and crying,  \"You little blackguard, if I ever catch you playing with blackguards  again, I'll wring your neck for you,\" she hustled the infant into the  house and slammed the door viciously behind her.    Moses had welcomed this every-day scene, for it put off a few moments  his encounter with the formidable Malka. As she had not appeared at door  or window, he concluded she was in a bad temper or out of London;  neither alternative was pleasant.    He knocked at the door of Milly's house where her mother was generally  to be found, and an elderly char-woman opened it. There were some  bottles of spirit, standing on a wooden side-table covered with a  colored cloth, and some unopened biscuit bags. At these familiar  premonitory signs of a festival, Moses felt tempted to beat a retreat.  He could not think for the moment what was up, but whatever it was he  had no doubt the well-to-do persons would supply him with ice. The  char-woman, with brow darkened by soot and gloom, told him that Milly  was upstairs, but that her mother had gone across to her own house with  the clothes-brush.    Moses's face fell. When his wife was alive, she had been a link of  connection between \"The Family\" and himself, her cousin having  generously employed her as a char-woman. So Moses knew the import of the  clothes-brush. Malka was very particular about her appearance and loved  to be externally speckless, but somehow or other she had no  clothes-brush at home. This deficiency did not matter ordinarily, for  she practically lived at Milly's. But when she had words with Milly or  her husband, she retired to her own house to sulk or _schmull_, as they  called it. The carrying away of the clothes-brush was, thus, a sign that  she considered the breach serious and hostilities likely to be  protracted. Sometimes a whole week would go by without the two houses  ceasing to stare sullenly across at each other, the situation in Milly's  camp being aggravated by the lack of a clothes-brush. In such moments of  irritation, Milly's husband was apt to declare that his mother-in-law  had abundance of clothes-brushes, for, he pertinently asked, how did she  manage during her frequent business tours in the country? He gave it as  his conviction that Malka merely took the clothes-brush away to afford  herself a handle for returning. But then Ephraim Phillips was a  graceless young fellow, the death of whose first wife was probably a  judgment on his levity, and everybody except his second mother-in-law  knew that he had a book of tickets for the Oxbridge Music Hall, and went  there on Friday nights. Still, in spite of these facts, experience did  show that whenever Milly's camp had outsulked Malka's, the old woman's  surrender was always veiled under the formula of: \"Oh Milly, I've  brought you over your clothes-brush. I just noticed it, and thought you  might be wanting it.\" After this, conversation was comparatively easy.    Moses hardly cared to face Malka in such a crisis of the clothes-brush.  He turned away despairingly, and was going back through the small  archway which led to the Ruins and the outside world, when a grating  voice startled his ear.    \"Well, Meshe, whither fliest thou? Has my Milly forbidden thee to see  me?\"    He looked back. Malka was standing at her house-door. He retraced his  steps.    \"N-n-o,\" he murmured. \"I thought you still out with your stall.\"    That was where she should have been, at any rate, till half an hour ago.  She did not care to tell herself, much less Moses, that she had been  waiting at home for the envoy of peace from the filial camp summoning  her to the ceremony of the Redemption of her grandson.    \"Well, now thou seest me,\" she said, speaking Yiddish for his behoof,  \"thou lookest not outwardly anxious to know how it goes with me.\"    \"How goes it with you?\"    \"As well as an old woman has a right to expect. The Most High is good!\"  Malka was in her most amiable mood, to emphasize to outsiders the  injustice of her kin in quarrelling with her. She was a tall woman of  fifty, with a tanned equine gypsy face surmounted by a black wig, and  decorated laterally by great gold earrings. Great black eyes blazed  beneath great black eyebrows, and the skin between them was capable of  wrinkling itself black with wrath. A gold chain was wound thrice round  her neck, and looped up within her black silk bodice. There were  numerous rings on her fingers, and she perpetually smelt of peppermint.    \"_Nu_, stand not chattering there,\" she went on. \"Come in. Dost thou  wish me to catch my death of cold?\"    Moses slouched timidly within, his head bowed as if in dread of knocking  against the top of the door. The room was a perfect fac-simile of  Milly's parlor at the other end of the diagonal, save that instead of  the festive bottles and paper bags on the small side-table, there was a  cheerless clothes-brush. Like Milly's, the room contained a round table,  a chest of drawers with decanters on the top, and a high mantelpiece  decorated with pendant green fringes, fastened by big-headed brass  nails. Here cheap china dogs, that had had more than their day squatted  amid lustres with crystal drops. Before the fire was a lofty steel  guard, which, useful enough in Milly's household, had survived its  function in Malka's, where no one was ever likely to tumble into the  grate. In a corner of the room a little staircase began to go upstairs.  There was oilcloth on the floor. In Zachariah Square anybody could go  into anybody else's house and feel at home. There was no visible  difference between one and another. Moses sat down awkwardly on a chair  and refused a peppermint. In the end he accepted an apple, blessed God  for creating the fruit of the tree, and made a ravenous bite at it.    \"I must take peppermints,\" Malka explained. \"It's for the spasms.\"    \"But you said you were well,\" murmured Moses.    \"And suppose? If I did not take peppermint I should have the spasms. My  poor sister Rosina, peace be upon him, who died of typhoid, suffered  greatly from the spasms. It's in the family. She would have died of  asthma if she had lived long enough. _Nu_, how goes it with thee?\" she  went on, suddenly remembering that Moses, too, had a right to be ill. At  bottom, Malka felt a real respect for Moses, though he did not know it.  It dated from the day he cut a chip of mahogany out of her best round  table. He had finished cutting his nails, and wanted a morsel of wood to  burn with them in witness of his fulfilment of the pious custom. Malka  raged, but in her inmost heart there was admiration for such  unscrupulous sanctity.    \"I have been out of work for three weeks,\" Moses answered, omitting to  expound the state of his health in view of more urgent matters.    \"Unlucky fool! What my silly cousin Gittel, peace be upon him, could see  to marry in thee, I know not.\"    Moses could not enlighten her. He might have informed her that _olov  hasholom_, \"peace be upon him,\" was an absurdity when applied to a  woman, but then he used the pious phrase himself, although aware of its  grammatical shortcomings.    \"I told her thou wouldst never be able to keep her, poor lamb,\" Malka  went on. \"But she was always an obstinate pig. And she kept her head  high up, too, as if she had five pounds a week! Never would let her  children earn money like other people's children. But thou oughtest not  to be so obstinate. Thou shouldst have more sense, Meshe; _thou_  belongest not to my family. Why can't Solomon go out with matches?\"    \"Gittel's soul would not like it.\"    \"But the living have bodies! Thou rather seest thy children starve than  work. There's Esther,--an idle, lazy brat, always reading story-books;  why doesn't she sell flowers or pull out bastings in the evening?\"    \"Esther and Solomon have their lessons to do.\"    \"Lessons!\" snorted Malka. \"What's the good of lessons? It's English, not  Judaism, they teach them in that godless school. _I_ could never read or  write anything but Hebrew in all my life; but God be thanked, I have  thriven without it. All they teach them in the school is English  nonsense. The teachers are a pack of heathens, who eat forbidden things,  but the good Yiddishkeit goes to the wall. I'm ashamed of thee, Meshe:  thou dost not even send thy boys to a Hebrew class in the evening.\"    \"I have no money, and they must do their English lessons. Else, perhaps,  their clothes will be stopped. Besides, I teach them myself every  _Shabbos_ afternoon and Sunday. Solomon translates into Yiddish the  whole Pentateuch with Rashi.\"    \"Yes, he may know _Terah_\" said Malka, not to be baffled. \"But he'll  never know _Gemorah_ or _Mishnayis_.\" Malka herself knew very little of  these abstruse subjects beyond their names, and the fact that they were  studied out of minutely-printed folios by men of extreme sanctity.    \"He knows a little _Gemorah_, too,\" said Moses. \"I can't teach him at  home because I haven't got a _Gemorah_,--it's so expensive, as you know.  But he went with me to the _Beth-Medrash_, when the _Maggid_ was  studying it with a class free of charge, and we learnt the whole of the  _Tractate Niddah_. Solomon understands very well all about the Divorce  Laws, and he could adjudicate on the duties of women to their husbands.\"    \"Ah, but he'll never know _Cabbulah_,\" said Malka, driven to her last  citadel. \"But then no one in England can study "]]]
