This was the east window--the east  window through which Reeve declared that the shot had been fired.    Bull shook his head. He stepped out of the cabin and looked about. It  was a prosperous little stretch of meadow, cleared into the  cottonwoods and reclaiming part of the marshland--all very rich soil,  as one could see at a glance. There was a field which had been  recently upturned by the plow, perhaps the work of yesterday. The  furrows were still black, still not dried out by the sun. Today would  have been the time for harrowing, but that work was indefinitely  postponed by the grim visitor. No doubt this Armstrong was an  industrious man. The sense of a wasted life was brought home to Bull;  a bullet had ended it all!    Absent-mindedly he passed around the side of the house and started for  the east window through which Reeve had said that the bullet was  fired, but he shook his head at once.    On the east side the house leaned against a mass of white stone. It  rose high, rough, ragged. Certainly a man stalking a house to fire a  shot would never come up to it from this side! His own words were  convicting Reeve of the murder!    Still he continued to clamber over the stones until he stood by the  window. To be sure, if a man stood there, he could easily have fired  into the room and into the breast of a man sitting on the far side of  the table. Armstrong was found there. Bull looked down to his feet as  a thoughtful man will do, and there, very clearly marked against the  white of the stone, he saw a dark streak--two of them, side by side.    He bent and looked at them. Then he rubbed the places with his  fingertips and examined the skin. A stain had come away from the rock.  It was as if the rocks had been rubbed with lead or a soft iron. And  then, strangely, into the mind of Bull came the memory of what the  hotel man had said of the sheriff's iron-shod heels.    The sheriff had gone for many a year hating Armstrong. The truth  rushed over the brain of the big man. What a chance for a crafty mind!  To kill his enemy and place the blame on the shoulders of one already  known to be a man-killer! Bull Hunter leaped from the rocks and  started back for the town with long, ground-devouring strides.          CHAPTER 8      There were two reasons for the happiness which lightened the step of  Bull Hunter as he strode back for the town. In the first place he saw  a hope of liberating Reeve from jail and accomplishing his own mission  of killing the man. In the second place he felt a peculiar joy at the  thought of freeing such a man from the imputation of a cowardly murder.    Yet he had small grounds for his hopes. Two little dark marks on the  white, friable stone, marks that the first small shower of rain would  wash away, marks that the first keen sandstorm would rub off--this was  his only proof. And with this to free one man from danger of the rope  and place the head of another under the noose--it was a task to try  the resources of a cleverer man than Bull.    Indeed, the high spirits of Bull in some measure left him as he drew  nearer and nearer to the village. How could he convict the sheriff?  How, with his clumsy wits and his clumsy tongue, could he bring the  truth to light? Had he possessed the keen eyes of his uncle he felt  that a single glance would have made the guilt stand up in the face of  Anderson. But his own eyes, alas, were dull and clouded.    Thoughtfully, with bowed head, he held his course. A strange picture,  surely, this man who so devoutly wished to free another from the  danger of the law in order that he might take a life into his own  hands. But the contrast did not strike home to Bull. To him everything  that he did was as clear as day. But how to go to work? If the man  were like himself it would be an easy matter. More than once he  remembered how his cousins had shifted the blame for their own boyish  pranks upon him. In the presence of their father they would accuse  Bull with a well-planned lie, and the very fact that he had been  accused made Bull blush and hang his head. Before he could be heard in  his own behalf the cruel eye of his uncle had grown stern, and Bull  was condemned as a culprit.    \"The only time you show any sense,\" his uncle had said more than once,  \"is when you want to do something you hadn't ought to do!\"    Steadily through the years he had served as a scapegoat for his  cousins. They set a certain value upon him for his use in this  respect. Ah, if only he had that keen, embarrassing eye of Bill  Campbell with which to pierce to the guilty heart of the sheriff and  make him speak! The eye of his uncle was like the eye of a crowd. It  was an audience in itself and condemned or praised with the strength  of numbers.    It was this thought of numbers that brought the clue to a possible  solution to Bull Hunter. When it came to him he stopped short in the  road, threw back his head and laughed.    \"And what's all the celebration about?\" asked a voice behind him.    He turned and found Sheriff Anderson on his horse directly behind him.  The soft loam of the trail had covered the sound of the sheriffs  approach. Bull blushed with a sudden sense of shame. Moreover, the  sheriff seemed unapproachably stern and dignified. He sat erect in the  saddle, a cavalier figure with his long, well-drilled mustaches.    \"I dunno,\" said Bull vaguely, pushing his hat back to scratch his  thatch of blond hair. \"I didn't know I was celebrating, particular.\"    The sheriff watched him with small, evil eyes. \"You been snooping  around, son,\" he said coldly. \"And we folks in this part, we don't  like snoopers. Understand?\"    \"No,\" said Bull frankly, \"I don't exactly figure what you mean.\" Then  he dropped his hand to his hip.    \"Git your hand off that gun!\" said the sheriff, his own weapon  flashing instantly in the light.    It had been a move like lightning. Its speed stunned and baffled Bull  Hunter. Something cold formed in his throat, choking him, and he  obediently drew his hand away. He did more. He threw both immense arms  above his head and stood gaping at the sheriff.    The latter eyed him for a moment with stern amusement, and then he  shoved the gun back into its holster. \"I guess they ain't much harm in  you,\" he said more to himself than to Bull. \"But I hate a snooper  worse than I do a rat. You can take them arms down.\"    Bull lowered them cautiously.    \"You hear me talk?\" asked the sheriff.    \"I hear,\" said Bull obediently.    \"I don't like snoopers. Which means that I don't like you none too  well. Besides, who in thunder are you? A wanderin' vagrant you look  to me, and we got a law agin' vagrants. You amble along on your trail  pretty pronto, and no harm'll come to you. But if you're around town  tomorrow--well, you've heard me talk!\"    It was very familiar talk to Bull; not the words, but the commanding  and contemptuous tone in which they were spoken. Crestfallen, he  submitted. Of one thing he must make sure: that no harm befell him  before he faced Pete Reeve and Pete Reeve's gun. Then he could only  pray for courage to attack. But the effect of the sheriff's little  gunplay entirely disheartened Bull at the prospect of facing Pete.    With a noncommittal rejoinder he started down the road, and the  sheriff put the spurs to his horse and plunged by at a full gallop,  flinging the dust back into the face of the big man. Bull wiped it out  of his eyes and went on gloomily. He had been trodden upon in spirit  once more. But, after all, that was so old a story that it made little  difference. It convinced him, however, of one thing; he could never do  anything with the sheriff man to man. Certainly he would need the help  of a crowd before he faced the tall man and his cavalier mustaches.    He waited until after the supper at the hotel. It was a miserable  meal for Bull; he had already eaten, and he could not find a way of  refusing the invitation of the proprietor to sit down again. Seated at  the end of the long table he looked miserably up and down it. Nobody  had a look for him except one of contempt. The sheriff, it seemed, had  spread a story around about his lack of spirit, and if Bull remained  long in the village, he would be treated with little more respect than  he had been in the house of his uncle. Even now they held him in  contempt. They could not understand, for instance, why he sat so far  forward. He was resting most of his weight on his legs, for fear of  the weakness of the chair under his full bulk. But that very bulk made  them whisper their jokes and insults to one another.    When the long nightmare of that meal was ended, Bull began making his  rounds. He had chosen his men. Every man he picked was sharp-eyed like  Uncle Bill Campbell. They were the men whose inlooking eyes would  baffle the sheriff; they were the men capable of suspicions, and such  men Bull needed--not dull-glancing people like himself.    He went first to the proprietor of the hotel. \"I got something to say  to the sheriff,\" he declared. \"And I want to have a few important  gents around town to be there to listen and hear what I got to say. I  wonder, could you be handy?\"    He was surprised at the avidity with which his invitation was  accepted. It was a long time since the hotel owner had been referred  to as an \"important man.\"    Then he went with the same talk to five others--the blacksmith, the  carpenter and odd-jobber, the storekeeper, and two men whom he had  marked when he first halted near the hotel veranda. To his invitation  each of them gave a quick assent. There had been something mysterious  in the manner in which this timid-eyed giant had descended upon the  town from nowhere, and now they felt that they were about to come to  the heart of the reason of his visit.    The invitation to the sheriff was delivered by the proprietor of the  hotel, and he said just enough--and no more--to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10338"],[0,"With the Turks in Palestine (#11)"],[1,"crazy, for she knew that hundreds of persons  were trying in vain to find means of leaving the country and it seemed  to her impossible that we, who were Turkish subjects, could succeed in  outwitting the authorities. Even when I had explained my plans and she  was willing to admit the possibility of success, she still felt doubts  as to whether it would be right for her to leave the country while her  friends were left behind in danger. I assured her, however, that our  family would feel relieved to know that we were in safety and could come  back fresh and strong after the war to help in rebuilding the country.    Having gained her consent, I still had the difficult problem of ways and  means before me. The Chester had orders to take citizens of neutral  countries only. Passports had to be examined by the Turkish authorities  and by the American Consul-General, who gave the final permission to  board the cruiser. How was I to pass this double scrutiny? After long  and arduous search, with the assistance of several good friends, I at  last discovered a man who was willing to sell me the passports of a  young couple belonging to a neutral nation. I cannot go into particulars  about this arrangement, of course. Suffice it to say that my sister was  to travel as my wife and that we both had to disguise ourselves so as to  answer the descriptions on the passports. When I went to the American  Consulate-General to get the permit, I found the building crowded with  people of all nations,--Spanish and Greek and Dutch and Swiss,--all  waiting for the precious little papers that should take them aboard the  American cruiser, that haven of liberty and safety. The Chester was to  take all these people to Alexandria, and those who had the means were to  be charged fifty cents a day for their food. From behind my dark goggles  I recognized many a person in disguise like myself and seeking escape.  We never betrayed recognition for fear of the spies who infested the  place.    After securing my permit, I ran downstairs and straight to \"my\" consul,  whose dragoman I took along with me to the _seraya_, or government  building. Of course, the dragoman was well tipped and he helped me  considerably in hastening the examination I had to undergo at the hands  of the Turkish officials. All went well, and I hurried back to my sister  triumphant.    The Chester was to sail in two days, but while we were waiting, the  alarming news came that the American Consul had been advised that the  British Government refused to permit the landing of the refugees in  Egypt and that the departure of the Chester was indefinitely postponed.  With a sinking at my heart I rushed up to the American Consulate for  details and there learned that the U.S.S. Des Moines was to sail in a  few hours for Rhodes with Italian and Greek refugees and that I could  go on her if I wished. In a few minutes I had my permit changed for the  trip on the Des Moines and I hurried home to my sister. We hastily got  together the few belongings we were to take with us, jumped into a  carriage, and drove to the harbor.    We had still another ordeal to go through. My sister was taken into a  private room and thoroughly searched; so was I. Nobody could leave the  country with more than twenty-five dollars in cash on his person. Our  baggage was carefully overhauled. No papers or books could be taken. My  sister's Bible was looked upon with much suspicion since it contained a  map of ancient Canaan. I explained that this was necessary for the  orientation of our prayers and that without it we could not tell in  which direction to turn our faces when praying! This seemed plausible to  the Moslem examiners and saved the Bible, the only book we now possess  as a souvenir from home. Now our passports were examined again and  several questions were asked. My sister was brave and self-possessed,  cool and unconcerned in manner, and at last the final signature was  affixed and we jumped into the little boat that was to take us out to  the ship.    At this moment a man approached, a dry-goods dealer of whom my sister  had made some purchases a few months before. He seemed to recognize her  and he asked her in German if she were not Miss Aaronsohn. I felt my  blood leave my face, and, looking him straight in the eye, I whispered,  \"If you say one word more, you will be a dead man; so help me God!\" He  must have felt that I meant exactly what I said, for he walked off  mumbling unintelligibly.    At last the boat got away, and five minutes later we were mounting the  side of the Des Moines. Throngs of refugees covered the decks of the  cruiser. Their faces showed tension and anxiety. Their presence there  seemed too good to be true, and all awaited the moment when the ship  should heave anchor. A Filipino sailor showed us about, and as he spoke  Italian, I told him I wanted to be hidden somewhere till the ship got  under way. I felt that even yet we were not entirely safe. That my fears  were justified I discovered shortly, when from our hiding-place I saw  the shopkeeper approaching in a small boat with a Turkish officer. They  looked over all the refugees on the deck, but searched for us in vain.  After a half-hour more of uncomfortable tension the engines began to  sputter, the propellers revolved, and--we were safe!    [ILLUSTRATION: BEIRUT, FROM THE DECK OF AN OUTGOING STEAMER]    The day was dying and a beautiful twilight softened the outlines of the  Lebanon and the houses of Beirut. The Mediterranean lay quiet and  peaceful around us, and the healthy, sturdy American sailors gave a  feeling of confidence. As the cruiser drew out of the harbor, a great  cry of farewell arose from the refugees on board, a cry in which was  mingled the relief of being free, anguish at leaving behind parents and  friends, fear and hope for the future. A little later the sailors were  lined up in arms to salute the American flag when it was lowered for the  night. Moved by a powerful instinct of love and respect, all the  refugees jumped to their feet, the men bareheaded and the women with  folded hands, and in that moment I understood as I had never understood  before the real sacred meaning of a flag. To all those people standing  in awe about that piece of cloth bearing the stars and stripes America  was an incarnation of love universal, of freedom and salvation.    The cool Syrian night, our first night on the cruiser, was spent in  songs, hymns, and conversation. We were all too excited to sleep.  Friends discovered friends and tales of woe were exchanged, stories of  hardship, injustice, oppression, all of which ended with mutual  congratulations on escaping from the clutches of the Turks."]]]
