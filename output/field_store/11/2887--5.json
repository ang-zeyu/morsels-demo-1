[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1183"],[0,"The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu (#11)"],[1,"; for as I knelt beside  the body on the floor, a look and a touch sufficed to tell me that this  was but clay from which the spirit had fled!    Smith met my glance as I raised my head, and his teeth came together  with a loud snap; the jaw muscles stood out prominently beneath the  dark skin; and his face was grimly set in that odd, half-despairful  expression which I knew so well but which boded so ill for whomsoever  occasioned it.    \"Dead, Petrie!--already?\"    \"Lightning could have done the work no better. Can I turn him over?\"    Smith nodded.    Together we stooped and rolled the heavy body on its back. A flood of  whispers came sibilantly from the stairway. Smith spun around rapidly,  and glared upon the group of half-dressed servants.    \"Return to your rooms!\" he rapped, imperiously; \"let no one come into  the hall without my orders.\"    The masterful voice had its usual result; there was a hurried retreat  to the upper landing. Burke, shaking like a man with an ague, sat on the  lower step, pathetically drumming his palms upon his uplifted knees.    \"I warned him, I warned him!\" he mumbled monotonously, \"I warned him,  oh, I warned him!\"    \"Stand up!\" shouted Smith--\"stand up and come here!\"    The man, with his frightened eyes turning to right and left, and seeming  to search for something in the shadows about him, advanced obediently.    \"Have you a flask?\" demanded Smith of Carter.    The detective silently administered to Burke a stiff restorative.    \"Now,\" continued Smith, \"you, Petrie, will want to examine him, I  suppose?\" He pointed to the body. \"And in the meantime I have some  questions to put to you, my man.\"    He clapped his hand upon Burke's shoulder.    \"My God!\" Burke broke out, \"I was ten yards from him when it happened!\"    \"No one is accusing you,\" said Smith, less harshly; \"but since you were  the only witness, it is by your aid that we hope to clear the matter  up.\"    Exerting a gigantic effort to regain control of himself, Burke nodded,  watching my friend with a childlike eagerness. During the ensuing  conversation, I examined Slattin for marks of violence; and of what I  found, more anon.    \"In the first place,\" said Smith, \"you say that you warned him. When did  you warn him and of what?\"    \"I warned him, sir, that it would come to this--\"    \"That what would come to this?\"'    \"His dealings with the Chinaman!\"    \"He had dealings with Chinamen?\"    \"He accidentally met a Chinaman at an East End gaming-house, a man he  had known in Frisco--a man called Singapore Charlie--\"    \"What! Singapore Charlie!\"    \"Yes, sir, the same man that had a dope-shop, two years ago, down  Ratcliffe way--\"    \"There was a fire--\"    \"But Singapore Charlie escaped, sir.\"    \"And he is one of the gang?\"    \"He is one of what we used to call in New York, the Seven Group.\"    Smith began to tug at the lobe of his left ear, reflectively, as I saw  out of the corner of my eye.    \"The Seven Group!\" he mused. \"That is significant. I always suspected  that Dr. Fu-Manchu and the notorious Seven Group were one and the same.  Go on, Burke.\"    \"Well, sir,\" the man continued, more calmly, \"the lieutenant--\"    \"The lieutenant!\" began Smith; then: \"Oh! of course; Slattin used to be  a police lieutenant!\"    \"Well, sir, he--Mr. Slattin--had a sort of hold on this Singapore  Charlie, and two years ago, when he first met him, he thought that with  his aid he was going to pull off the biggest thing of his life--\"    \"Forestall me, in fact?\"    \"Yes, sir; but you got in first, with the big raid and spoiled it.\"    Smith nodded grimly, glancing at the Scotland Yard man, who returned his  nod with equal grimness.    \"A couple of months ago,\" resumed Burke, \"he met Charlie again down  East, and the Chinaman introduced him to a girl--some sort of an  Egyptian girl.\"    \"Go on!\" snapped Smith--\"I know her.\"    \"He saw her a good many times--and she came here once or twice. She made  out that she and Singapore Charlie were prepared to give away the boss  of the Yellow gang--\"    \"For a price, of course?\"    \"I suppose so,\" said Burke; \"but I don't know. I only know that I warned  him.\"    \"H'm!\" muttered Smith. \"And now, what took place to-night?\"    \"He had an appointment here with the girl,\" began Burke    \"I know all that,\" interrupted Smith. \"I merely want to know, what took  place after the telephone call?\"    \"Well, he told me to wait up, and I was dozing in the next room to the  study--the dining-room--when the 'phone bell aroused me. I heard the  lieutenant--Mr. Slattin, coming out, and I ran out too, but only in time  to see him taking his hat from the rack--\"    \"But he wears no hat!\"    \"He never got it off the peg! Just as he reached up to take it, he gave  a most frightful scream, and turned around like lightning as though some  one had attacked him from behind!\"    \"There was no one else in the hall?\"    \"No one at all. I was standing down there outside the dining-room just  by the stairs, but he didn't turn in my direction, he turned and looked  right behind him--where there was no one--nothing. His cries were  frightful.\" Burke's voice broke, and he shuddered feverishly. \"Then he  made a rush for the front door. It seemed as though he had not seen me.  He stood there screaming; but, before I could reach him, he fell....\"    Nayland Smith fixed a piercing gaze upon Burke.    \"Is that all you know?\" he demanded slowly.    \"As God is my judge, sir, that's all I know, and all I saw. There was no  living thing near him when he met his death.\"    \"We shall see,\" muttered Smith. He turned to me--\"What killed him?\" he  asked, shortly.    \"Apparently, a minute wound on the left wrist,\" I replied, and,  stooping, I raised the already cold hand in mine.    A tiny, inflamed wound showed on the wrist; and a certain puffiness was  becoming observable in the injured hand and arm. Smith bent down and  drew a quick, sibilant breath.    \"You know what this is, Petrie?\" he cried.    \"Certainly. It was too late to employ a ligature and useless to inject  ammonia. Death was practically instantaneous. His heart...\"    There came a loud knocking and ringing.    \"Carter!\" cried Smith, turning to the detective, \"open that door to no  one--no one. Explain who I am--\"    \"But if it is the inspector?--\"    \"I said, open the door to no one!\" snapped Smith.    \"Burke, stand exactly where you are! Carter, you can speak to whoever  knocks, through the letter-box. Petrie, don't move for your life! It may  be here, in the hallway!--\"        CHAPTER IX. THE CLIMBER    Our search of the house of Abel Slattin ceased only with the coming of  the dawn, and yielded nothing but disappointment. Failure followed upon  failure; for, in the gray light of the morning, our own quest concluded,  Inspector Weymouth returned to report that the girl, Karamaneh, had  thrown him off the scent.    Again he stood before me, the big, burly friend of old and dreadful  days, a little grayer above the temples, which I set down for a record  of former horrors, but deliberate, stoical, thorough, as ever. His blue  eyes melted in the old generous way as he saw me, and he gripped my hand  in greeting.    \"Once again,\" he said, \"your dark-eyed friend has been too clever for  me, Doctor. But the track as far as I could follow, leads to the old  spot. In fact,\"--he turned to Smith, who, grim-faced and haggard,  looked thoroughly ill in that gray light--\"I believe Fu-Manchu's lair is  somewhere near the former opium-den of Shen-Yan--'Singapore Charlie.'\"    Smith nodded.    \"We will turn our attention in that direction,\" he replied, \"at a very  early date.\"    Inspector Weymouth looked down at the body of Abel Slattin.    \"How was it done?\" he asked softly.    \"Clumsily for Fu-Manchu,\" I replied. \"A snake was introduced into the  house by some means--\"    \"By Karamaneh!\" rapped Smith.    \"Very possibly by Karamaneh,\" I continued firmly. \"The thing has escaped  us.\"    \"My own idea,\" said Smith, \"is that it was concealed about his clothing.  When he fell by the open door it glided out of the house. We must have  the garden searched thoroughly by daylight.\"    \"He\"--Weymouth glanced at that which lay upon the floor--\"must be moved;  but otherwise we can leave the place untouched, clear out the servants,  and lock the house up.\"    \"I have already given orders to that effect,\" answered Smith. He spoke  wearily and with a note of conscious defeat in his voice. \"Nothing has  been disturbed;\"--he swept his arm around comprehensively--\"papers and  so forth you can examine at leisure.\"    Presently we quitted that house upon which the fateful Chinaman had  set his seal, as the suburb was awakening to a new day. The clank of  milk-cans was my final impression of the avenue to which a dreadful  minister of death had come at the bidding of the death lord. We  left Inspector Weymouth in charge and returned to my rooms, scarcely  exchanging a word upon the way.    Nayland Smith, ignoring my entreaties, composed himself for slumber in  the white cane chair in my study. About noon he retired to the bathroom,  and returning, made a pretense of breakfast; then resumed his seat in  the cane armchair. Carter reported in the afternoon, but his report was  merely formal. Returning from my round of professional visits at half  past five, I found Nayland Smith in the same position; and so the day  waned into evening, and dusk fell uneventfully.    In the corner of the big room by the empty fireplace, Nayland Smith lay,  with his long, lean frame extended in the white cane chair. A tumbler,  from which two straws protruded, stood by his right elbow, and a perfect  continent of tobacco smoke lay between us, wafted toward the door by the  draught from an open window. He had littered the hearth with matches and  tobacco ash, being the most untidy smoker I have ever met; and save  for his frequent rapping-out of his pipe bowl and perpetual striking of  matches, he had shown no sign of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11870"],[0,"The Country of the Blind, and Other Stories (#11)"],[1,"Why?\"    \"Why? Because _I_ found them--Lord!--it's nearly twenty years ago. If  Dawson's hadn't been silly about that salary they might have made a  perfect ring in 'em... _I_ couldn't help the infernal boat going  adrift.\"    He paused. \"I suppose it's the same place. A kind of swamp about ninety  miles north of Antananarivo. Do you happen to know? You have to go to it  along the coast by boats. You don't happen to remember, perhaps?\"    \"I don't. I fancy Andrews said something about a swamp.\"    \"It must be the same. It's on the east coast. And somehow there's  something in the water that keeps things from decaying. Like creosote it  smells. It reminded me of Trinidad. Did they get any more eggs? Some of  the eggs I found were a foot-and-a-half long. The swamp goes circling  round, you know, and cuts off this bit. It's mostly salt, too. Well...  What a time I had of it! I found the things quite by accident. We went for  eggs, me and two native chaps, in one of those rum canoes all tied  together, and found the bones at the same time. We had a tent and  provisions for four days, and we pitched on one of the firmer places. To  think of it brings that odd tarry smell back even now. It's funny work.  You go probing into the mud with iron rods, you know. Usually the egg gets  smashed. I wonder how long it is since these AEpyornises really lived. The  missionaries say the natives have legends about when they were alive, but  I never heard any such stories myself.[*] But certainly those eggs we got  were as fresh as if they had been new laid. Fresh! Carrying them down to  the boat one of my nigger chaps dropped one on a rock and it smashed. How  I lammed into the beggar! But sweet it was, as if it was new laid, not  even smelly, and its mother dead these four hundred years, perhaps. Said a  centipede had bit him. However, I'm getting off the straight with the  story. It had taken us all day to dig into the slush and get these eggs  out unbroken, and we were all covered with beastly black mud, and  naturally I was cross. So far as I knew they were the only eggs that have  ever been got out not even cracked. I went afterwards to see the ones they  have at the Natural History Museum in London; all of them were cracked and  just stuck together like a mosaic, and bits missing. Mine were perfect,  and I meant to blow them when I got back. Naturally I was annoyed at the  silly duffer dropping three hours' work just on account of a centipede. I  hit him about rather.\"    [Footnote *: No European is known to have seen a live AEpyornis, with the  doubtful exception of MacAndrew, who visited Madagascar in 1745.--H.G.W.]    The man with the scar took out a clay pipe. I placed my pouch before him.  He filled up absent-mindedly.    \"How about the others? Did you get those home? I don't remember--\"    \"That's the queer part of the story. I had three others. Perfectly fresh  eggs. Well, we put 'em in the boat, and then I went up to the tent to make  some coffee, leaving my two heathens down by the beach--the one fooling  about with his sting and the other helping him. It never occurred to me  that the beggars would take advantage of the peculiar position I was in to  pick a quarrel. But I suppose the centipede poison and the kicking I had  given him had upset the one--he was always a cantankerous sort--and he  persuaded the other.    \"I remember I was sitting and smoking and boiling up the water over a  spirit-lamp business I used to take on these expeditions. Incidentally I  was admiring the swamp under the sunset. All black and blood-red it was,  in streaks--a beautiful sight. And up beyond the land rose grey and hazy  to the hills, and the sky behind them red, like a furnace mouth. And fifty  yards behind the back of me was these blessed heathen--quite regardless of  the tranquil air of things--plotting to cut off with the boat and leave me  all alone with three days' provisions and a canvas tent, and nothing to  drink whatsoever beyond a little keg of water. I heard a kind of yelp  behind me, and there they were in this canoe affair--it wasn't properly a  boat--and, perhaps, twenty yards from land. I realised what was up in a  moment. My gun was in the tent, and, besides, I had no bullets--only duck  shot. They knew that. But I had a little revolver in my pocket, and I  pulled that out as I ran down to the beach.    \"'Come back!' says I, flourishing it.    \"They jabbered something at me, and the man that broke the egg jeered. I  aimed at the other--because he was unwounded and had the paddle, and I  missed. They laughed. However, I wasn't beat. I knew I had to keep cool,  and I tried him again and made him jump with the whang of it. He didn't  laugh that time. The third time I got his head, and over he went, and the  paddle with him. It was a precious lucky shot for a revolver. I reckon it  was fifty yards. He went right under. I don't know if he was shot, or  simply stunned and drowned. Then I began to shout to the other chap to  come back, but he huddled up in the canoe and refused to answer. So I  fired out my revolver at him and never got near him.    \"I felt a precious fool, I can tell you. There I was on this rotten, black  beach, flat swamp all behind me, and the flat sea, cold after the sun set,  and just this black canoe drifting steadily out to sea. I tell you I  damned Dawson's and Jamrach's and Museums and all the rest of it just to  rights. I bawled to this nigger to come back, until my voice went up into  a scream.    \"There was nothing for it but to swim after him and take my luck with the  sharks. So I opened my clasp-knife and put it in my mouth, and took off  my clothes and waded in. As soon as I was in the water I lost sight of  the canoe, but I aimed, as I judged, to head it off. I hoped the man in it  was too bad to navigate it, and that it would keep on drifting in the  same direction. Presently it came up over the horizon again to the  south-westward about. The afterglow of sunset was well over now and the  dim of night creeping up. The stars were coming through the blue. I swum  like a champion, though my legs and arms were soon aching.    \"However, I came up to him by the time the stars were fairly out. As it  got darker I began to see all manner of glowing things in the water--  phosphorescence, you know. At times it made me giddy. I hardly knew which  was stars and which was phosphorescence, and whether I was swimming on my  head or my heels. The canoe was as black as sin, and the ripple under the  bows like liquid fire. I was naturally chary of clambering up into it. I  was anxious to see what he was up to first. He seemed to be lying cuddled  up in a lump in the bows, and the stern was all out of water. The thing  kept turning round slowly as it drifted---kind of waltzing, don't you  know. I went to the stern and pulled it down, expecting him to wake up.  Then I began to clamber in with my knife in my hand, and ready for a rush.  But he never stirred. So there I sat in the stern of the little canoe,  drifting away over the calm phosphorescent sea, and with all the host of  the stars above me, waiting for something to happen.    \"After a long time I called him by name, but he never answered. I was too  tired to take any risks by going along to him. So we sat there. I fancy I  dozed once or twice. When the dawn came I saw he was as dead as a doornail  and all puffed up and purple. My three eggs and the bones were lying in  the middle of the canoe, and the keg of water and some coffee and biscuits  wrapped in a Cape _Argus_ by his feet, and a tin of methylated spirit  underneath him. There was no paddle, nor, in fact, anything except the  spirit-tin that I could use as one, so I settled to drift until I was  picked up. I held an inquest on him, brought in a verdict against some  snake, scorpion, or centipede unknown, and sent him overboard.    \"After that I had a drink of water and a few biscuits, and took a look  round. I suppose a man low down as I was don't see very far; leastways,  Madagascar was clean out of sight, and any trace of land at all. I saw a  sail going south-westward--looked like a schooner but her hull never came  up. Presently the sun got high in the sky and began to beat down upon me.  Lord! it pretty near made my brains boil. I tried dipping my head in the  sea, but after a while my eye fell on the Cape _Argus_, and I lay  down flat in the canoe and spread this over me. Wonderful things these  newspapers! I never read one through thoroughly before, but it's odd what  you get up to when you're alone, as I was. I suppose I read that blessed  old Cape _Argus_ twenty times. The pitch in the canoe simply reeked  with the heat and rose up into big blisters.    \"I drifted ten days,\" said the man with the scar. \"It's a little thing in  the telling, isn't it? Every day was like the last. Except in the morning  and the evening I never kept a look-out even--the blaze was so infernal. I  didn't see a sail after the first three days, and those I saw took no  notice of me. About the sixth night a ship went by scarcely half a mile  away from me, with all its lights ablaze and its ports open, looking like  a big firefly. There was music aboard. I stood up and shouted and screamed  at it. The second day I broached one of the AEpyornis eggs, scraped the  shell away at the end bit by bit, and tried it, and I was glad to find it  was good enough to eat. A bit flavoury--not bad, I mean--but with  something of the taste of a duck's egg. There was a kind of circular  patch, about six inches across, on one side of the yoke, and with streaks  of blood and a white mark like a ladder in it that I thought queer, but I  did not understand what this meant at the time, and I wasn't inclined to  be particular. The egg lasted me three days, with biscuits and a drink of  water. I chewed coffee berries too--invigorating stuff. The second egg I  opened about the eighth day, and it scared me.\"    The man with the"]]]
