Mark 10. 14.    1 How large the promise! how divine,  To Abra'am and his seed!  \"I'll be a God to thee and thine,  \"Supplying all their need.\"    2 The words of his extensive love  From age to age endure;  The angel of the covenant proves,  And seals the blessing sure.    3 Jesus the ancient faith confirms  To our great fathers given;  He takes young children to his arms,  And calls them heirs of heaven.    4 Our God, how faithful are his ways!  His love endures the same;  Nor from the promise of his grace  Blots out the children's name.      Hymn 1:114.  The same, Rom. 11. 16 17.    1 Gentiles by nature we belong  To the wild olive wood;  Grace took us from the barren tree,  And grafts us in the good.    2 With the same blessings grace endows  The Gentile and the Jew;  If pure and holy be the root,  Such are the branches too.    3 Then let the children of the saints  Be dedicate to God;  Pour out thy Spirit on them, Lord,  And wash them in thy blood.    4 Thus to the parents and their seed  Shall thy salvation come,  And numerous households meet at last  In one eternal home.      Hymn 1:115.  Conviction of sin by the law, Rom. 7. 8 9 14 24.    1 Lord, how secure my conscience was,  And felt no inward dread!  I was alive without the law,  And thought my sins were dead.    2 My hopes of heaven were firm and bright,  But since the precept came  With a convincing power and light,  I find how vile I am.    3 [My guilt appear'd but small before,  Till terribly I saw  How perfect, holy, just, and pure,  Was thine eternal law.    4 Then felt my soul the heavy load,  My sins reviv'd again,  I had provok'd a dreadful God,  And all my hopes were slain.]    5 I'm like a helpless captive sold  Under the power of sin;  I cannot do the good I would,  Nor keep my conscience clean.    6 My God, I cry with every breath  For some kind power to save,  To break the yoke of sin and death,  And thus redeem the slave.      Hymn 1:116.  Love to God and our neighbour, Matt. 22. 37-40.    1 Thus saith the first, the great command,  \"Let all thy inward powers unite  \"To love thy Maker and thy God,  \"With utmost vigour and delight.    2 \"Then shall thy neighbour next in place  \"Share thine affections and esteem,  \"And let thy kindness to thyself  \"Measure and rule thy love to him.\"    3 This is the sense that Moses spoke,  This did the prophets preach and prove,  For want of this the law is broke,  And the whole law's fulfill'd by love.    4 But O! how base our passions are!  How cold our charity and zeal!  Lord, fill our souls with heavenly fire,  Or we shall ne'er perform thy will.      Hymn 1:117.  Election sovereign and free, Rom. 9. 21 22 23 20.    1 Behold the potter and the clay,  He forms his vessels as he please:  Such is our God, and such are we,  The subjects of his high decrees.    2 [Doth not the workman's power extend  O'er all the mass, which part to choose,  And mould it for a nobler end,  And which to leave for viler use?]    3 May not the sovereign Lord on high  Dispense his favours as he will,  Choose some to life while others die,  And yet be just and gracious still?    4 [What if to make his terror known  He lets his patience long endure,  Suffering vile rebels to go on  And seal their own destruction sure!    5 What if he means to shew his grace,  And his electing love employs  To mark out some of mortal race,  And form them fit for heavenly joys!]    6 Shall man reply against the Lord,  And call his Maker's ways unjust,  The thunder of whose dreadful word  Can crush a thousand worlds to dust?    7 But, O my soul, if truths so bright  Should dazzle and confound thy sight  Yet still his written will obey,  And wait the great decisive day.    8 Then shall he make his justice known,  And the whole world before his throne  With joy or terror shall confess  The glory of his righteousness.      Hymn 1:118.  Moses and Christ; or, Sins against the law and  gospel, John 1. 17. Heb. 3. 3 5 6 and 10. 28 29.    1 The law by Moses came,  But peace, and truth, and love,  Were brought by Christ, a nobler name,  Descending from above.    2 Amidst the house of God  Their different works were done;  Moses a faithful servant stood,  But Christ a faithful Son.    3 Then to his new commands  Be strict obedience paid;  O'er all his Father's house he stands  The sovereign and the head.    4 The man that durst despise  The law that Moses brought,  Behold! how terribly he dies  For his presumptuous fault.    5 But sorer vengeance falls  On that rebellious race,  Who hate to hear when Jesus calls,  And dare resist his grace.      Hymn 1:119.  'The different success of the gospel, 1 Cor. 1. 23 24.  2 Cor. 2. 16. 1 Cor. 3. 6 7.    1 Christ and his cross is all our theme;  The mysteries that we speak  Are scandal in the Jew's esteem,  And folly to the Greek.    2 But souls enlighten'd from above  With joy receive the word;  They see what wisdom, power, and love  Shines in their dying Lord.    3 The vital savour of his Name  Restores their fainting breath;  But unbelief perverts the same  To guilt, despair, and death.    4 Till God diffuse his graces down,  Like showers of heavenly rain,  In vain Apollos sows the ground,  And Paul may plant in vain.      Hymn 1:120.  Faith of things unseen, Heb. 11. 1 3 8 10.    1 Faith is the brightest evidence  Of things beyond our sight,  Breaks thro' the clouds of flesh and sense,  And dwells in heavenly light.    2 It sets times past in present view,  Brings distant prospects home,  Of things a thousand years ago,  Or thousand years to come.    3 By faith we know the worlds were made  By God's almighty word;  Abra'm to unknown countries led,  By faith obey'd the Lord.    4 He sought a city fair and high,  Built by th' eternal hands;  And faith assures us, tho' we die,  That heavenly building stands.      Hymn 1:121.  Children devoted to God, Gen. 17. 7 10. Acts 16.  14 15 33. (For those who practise infant Baptism.)    1 Thus saith the mercy of the Lord,  \"I'll be a God to thee;  \"I'll bless thy numerous race, and they  \"Shall be a seed for me.\"    2 Abra'm believ'd the promis'd grace,  And gave his sons to God;  But water seals the blessing now,  That once was seal'd with blood.    3 Thus Lydia sanctify'd her house  When she receiv'd the word;  Thus the believing jailor gave  His household to the Lord.    4 Thus later saints, eternal King,  Thine ancient truth embrace;  To thee their infant-offspring bring,  And humbly claim the grace.      Hymn 1:122.  Believers buried with Christ in baptism, Rom. 6. 3 &c.    1 Do we not know that solemn word,  That we are bury'd with the Lord,  Baptis'd into his death, and then  Put off the body of our sin?    2 Our souls receive diviner breath,  Rais'd from corruption, guilt, and death;  So from the grave did Christ arise,  And lives to God above the skies.    3 No more let sin or Satan reign  Over our mortal flesh again;  The various lusts we serv'd before  Shall have dominion now no more.      Hymn 1:123.  The repenting prodigal, Luke 15. 13 &c.    1 Behold the wretch whose lust and wine  Had wasted his estate,  He begs a share among the swine,  To taste the husks they eat!    2 \"I die with hunger here (he cries)  \"I starve in foreign lands,  \"My father's house has large supplies,  \"And bounteous are his hands.    3 \"I'll go, and with a mournful tongue  \"Fall down before his face,  \"Father, I've done thy justice wrong,  \"Nor can deserve thy grace.\"    4 He said, and hasten'd to his home,  To seek his father's love;  The father saw the rebel come,  And all his bowels move.    5 He ran, and fell upon his neck,  Embrac'd and kiss'd his son;  The rebel's heart with sorrow brake  For follies he had done.    6 \"Take off his clothes of shame and sin,\"  (The father gives command)  \"Dress him in garments white and clean,  \"With rings adorn his hand.    7 \"A day of feasting I ordain,  \"Let mirth and joy abound;  \"My son was dead, and lives again,  \"Was lost, and now is found.\"      Hymn 1:124.  The first and second Adam, Rom. 5. 12 &c.    1 Deep in the dust before thy throne  Our guilt and our disgrace we own;  Great God, we own th' unhappy name  Whence sprang our nature and our shame.    2 Adam, the sinner: At his fall  Death like a conqueror seiz'd us all;  A thousand new-born babes are dead  By fatal union to their head.    3 But whilst our spirits fill'd with awe  Behold the terrors of thy law,  We sing the honours of thy grace,  That sent to save our ruin'd race.    4 We sing thine everlasting Son,  Who join'd our nature to his own;  Adam the second, from the dust  Raises the ruins of the first.    5 [By the rebellion of one man  Thro' all his seed the mischief ran;  And by one man's obedience now  Are all his seed made righteous too.]    6 Where sin did reign, and death abound,  There have the sons of Adam found  Abounding life; there glorious grace  Reigns thro' the Lord our righteousness.      Hymn 1:125.  Christ's compassion to the weak and tempted, Heb. 4.  15 16. and 5. 7. Matt. 12. 20.    1 With joy we meditate the grace  Of our High Priest above;  His heart is made of tenderness,  His bowels melt with love.    2 Touch'd with a sympathy within  He knows our feeble frame;  He knows what sore temptations mean,  For he has felt the same.    3 But spotless, innocent, and pure  The great Redeemer stood,  While Satan's fiery darts he bore,  And did resist to blood.    4 He in the days of feeble flesh  Pour'd out his cries and tears,  And in his measure feels afresh  What every member bears.    5 [He'll never quench the smoking flax,  But raise it to a flame;  The bruised reed he never breaks,  Nor scorns the meanest name.]    6 Then let our humble faith address  His mercy and his power,  We shall obtain delivering grace  In the distressing hour.      Hymn 1:126.  Charity and uncharitableness, Rom. 14. 17 19.  1 Cor. 10. 32.    1 Not different food, or different dress  Compose the kingdom of our Lord,  But peace and joy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13376"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage, King AEthelbert, 596 to King George III, 1775 (#11)"],[1,"Streets, and Honey Lane. There were open air markets such as  Billingsgate. There were wooden quays over much of the river front.  Houses were made of wood, with one sunken floor, or a ground floor  with a cellar beneath. Some had central stone hearths and earth  latrines. There were crude pottery cooking pots, beakers and  lamps, wool cloth, a little silk, simple leather shoes, pewter  jewelry, looms, and quernstones (for grinding flour). Wool, skins,  hides, wheat, meal, beer, lead, cheese, salt, and honey were  exported. Wine (mostly for the church), fish, timber, pitch,  pepper, garlic, spices, copper, gems, gold, silk, dyes, oil,  brass, sulphur, glass, slaves, and elephant and walrus ivory were  imported. Goods from the continent were sold at open stalls in  certain streets. Furs and slaves were traded. There was a royal  levy on exports by foreigners merchants. Southwark was reachable  by a bridge. It contained sleazy docks, prisons, gaming houses,  and brothels.    Guilds in London were first associations of neighbors for the  purposes of mutual assistance. They were fraternities of persons  by voluntary compact to assist each other in poverty, including  their widows or orphans and the portioning of poor maids, and to  protect each other from injury. Their essential features are and  continue to be in the future: 1) oath of initiation, 2) entrance  fee in money or in kind and a common fund, 3) annual feast and  mass, 4) meetings at least three times yearly for guild business,  5), obligation to attend all funerals of members, to bear the body  if need be from a distance, and to provide masses for the dead, 6)  the duty of friendly help in cases of sickness, imprisonment,  house burning, shipwreck, or robbery, 7) rules for decent behavior  at meetings, and 8) provisions for settling disputes without  recourse to the law. Both the masses and the feast were attended  by the women. Frequently the guilds also had a religious  ceremonial to affirm their bonds of fidelity. They readily became  connected with the exercise of trades and with the training of  apprentices. They promoted and took on public purposes such as the  repairing of roads and bridges, the relief of pilgrims, the  maintenance of schools and almshouses, and the periodic  performance of pageants and miracle plays telling scriptural  history, which could last for several days. The devil often was  prominent in miracle plays.    Many of these London guilds were known by the name of their  founding member. There were also Frith Guilds (peace guilds) and a  Knights' Guild. The Frith Guild's main object was to enforce the  King's laws, especially the prevalent problem of theft. They were  especially established by bishops and reeves. Members met monthly  and contributed about 4d. to a common fund, which paid a  compensation for items stolen. They each paid 1s. towards the  pursuit of the thief. The members were grouped in tens. Members  with horses were to track the thief. Members without horses worked  in the place of the absent horse owners until their return. When  caught, the thief was tried and executed. Overwhelming force was  used if his kindred tried to protect him. His property was used to  compensate the victim for his loss and then divided between the  thief's wife, if she was innocent, the King, and the guild. Owners  of slaves paid into a fund to give one half compensation to those  who lost slaves by theft or escape, and recaptured slaves were to  be stoned to death or hanged. The members of the peace guild also  feasted and drank together. When one died, the others each sang a  song or paid for the singing of fifty psalms for his soul and gave  a loaf.    The Knights' Guild was composed of thirteen military persons to  whom King Edgar granted certain waste land in the east of London,  toward Aldgate, and also Portsoken, which ran outside the eastern  wall of the city to the Thames, for prescribed services performed,  probably defense of the vulnerable east side of the city. This  concession was confirmed by King Edward the Confessor in a charter  at the suit of certain citizens of London, the successors of these  knights. Edward granted them sac and soke [cause and suit]  jurisdiction over their men.    Edward the Confessor made these rules for London:    1.  Be it known that within the space of three miles from      all parts outside of the city a man ought not to hold or      hinder another, and also should not do business with him if      he wish to come to the city under its peace. But when he      arrives in the city, then let the market be the same to the      rich man as to the poor.    2.  Be it also known that a man who is from the court of the      king or the barons ought not to lodge in the house of any      citizen of London for three nights, either by privilege or      by custom, except by consent of the host. For if he force      the host to lodge him in his house and there be killed by      the host, let the host choose six from his relatives and let      him as the seventh swear that he killed him for the said      cause. And thus he will remain quit of the murder of the      deceased towards the king and relatives and lords of the      deceased.    3.  And after he has entered the city, let a foreign      merchant be lodged wherever it please him. But if he bring      dyed cloth, let him see to it that he does not sell his      merchandise at retail, but that he sell not less than a      dozen pieces at a time. And if he bring pepper, or cumin, or      ginger, or alum, or brasil wood, or resin, or incense, let      him sell not less than fifteen pounds at a time. But if he      bring belts, let him sell not less than a thousand at a      time. And if he bring cloths of silk, or wool or linen, let      him see that he cut them not, but sell them whole. But if he      bring wax, let him sell not less than one quartanum. Also a      foreign merchant may not buy dyed cloth, nor make the dye in      the city, nor do any work which belongs by right to the      citizens.    4.  Also no foreign merchant with his partner may set up any      market within the city for reselling goods in the city, nor      may he approach a citizen for making a bargain, nor may he      stop longer in the City.    Every week in London there was a folkmote at St. Paul's  churchyard, where majority decision was a tradition. By 1032, it  had lost much of its power to the husting [household assembly in  Danish] court. The folkmote then had responsibility for order and  was the sole authority for proclaiming outlaws. It met three times  a year at St. Paul's churchyard and there acclaimed the sheriff  and justiciar, or if the king had chosen his officer, heard who  was chosen and listened to his charge. It also yearly arranged the  watch and dealt with risks of fire. It was divided into wards,  each governed by an alderman who presided over the wardmote, and  represented his ward at the folkmote. Each guild became a ward.  The chief alderman was the portreeve. London paid one-eighth of  all the taxes of England.    Later in the towns, merchant guilds grew out of charity  associations whose members were bound by oath to each other and  got together for a guild feast every month. Some traders of these  merchant guilds became so prosperous that they became landholders.  Many market places were dominated by a merchant guild, which had a  monopoly of the local trade. In the great mercantile towns all the  land and houses would be held by merchants and their dependents,  all freeholders were connected with a trade, and everyone who had  a claim on public office or magistry would be a member of the  guild. The merchant guild could admit into their guild country  villeins, who became freemen if unclaimed by their lords for a  year and a day. Every merchant who had made three long voyages on  his own behalf and at his own cost ranked as a thegn. There were  also some craft guilds composed of handicraftsmen or artisans.  Escaped bonded agricultural workers, poor people, and traders  without land migrated to towns to live, but were not citizens.    Towns were largely self-sufficient, but salt and iron came from a  distance. The King's established in every shire at least one town  with a market place where purchases would be witnessed and a mint  where reliable money was coined by a moneyer, who put his name on  his coins. There were eight moneyers in London. Coins were issued  to be of value for only a couple of years. Then one had to exchange  them for newly issued ones at a rate of about 10 old for 8 or 9 new.  The difference constituted a tax. Roughly 10% of the people lived  in towns. Some took surnames such as Tanner, Weaver, or Carpenter.  Some had affectionate or derisive nicknames such as clear-hand,  fresh friend, soft bread, foul beard, money taker, or penny purse.  Craftsmen in the 1000s included goldsmiths, embroiderers,  illuminators of manuscripts, and armorers.    Edward the Confessor, named such for his piety, was a king of 24  years who was widely respected for his intelligence,  resourcefulness, good judgment, and wisdom. His educated Queen  Edith, whom he relied on for advice and cheerful courage, was a  stabilizing influence on him. They were served by a number of  thegns, who had duties in the household, which was composed of the  hall, the courtyard, and the bedchamber. They were important men -  thegns by rank. They were landholders, often in several areas, and  held leading positions in the shires. They were also priests and  clerics, who maintained the religious services and performed tasks  for which literacy was necessary. Edward was the first king to  have a \"Chancellor\". He kept a royal seal and was the chief royal  chaplain. He did all the secretarial work of the household and  court, drew up and sealed the royal writs, conducted the king's  correspondence, and kept all the royal accounts.
