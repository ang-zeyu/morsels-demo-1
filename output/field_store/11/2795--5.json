When Welsh fairies yield to their mortal lovers and consent to become  their wives, it is always on some condition or promise. Sometimes  there are several of these, which the fairy ladies compel their mortal  lovers to pledge them, before they agree to become wives. In fact, the  fairies in Cymric land are among the most exacting of any known.    A prince named Benlli, of the Powys region, found this out to his  grief, for he had always supposed that wives could be had simply for  the asking. All that a man need say, to the girl to whom he took a  fancy, was this: \"Come along with me, and be my bride,\" and then she  would say, \"Thank you, I'll come,\" and the two would trot off  together. This was the man's notion.    Now Benlli was a wicked old fellow. He was already married, but  wrinkles had gathered on his wife's face. She had a faded, washed-out  look, and her hair was thinning out. She would never be young again,  and he was tired of her, and wanted a mate with fresh rosy cheeks, and  long, thick hair. He was quite ready to fall in love with such a  maiden, whenever his eyes should light upon her.    One day, he went out hunting in the Green Forest. While waiting for a  wild boar to rush out, there rode past him a young woman whose beauty  was dazzling. He instantly fell in love with her.    The next day, while on horseback, at the same opening in the forest,  the same maiden reappeared; but it was only for a moment, and then she  vanished.    Again, on the third day, the prince rode out to the appointed place,  and again the vision of beauty was there. He rode up to her and begged  her to come and live with him at his palace.    \"I will come and be your wedded wife on three conditions: You must put  away the wife you now have; you must permit me to leave you, one night  in every seven, without following after or spying upon me; and you  must not ask me where I go or what I do. Swear to me that you will do  these three things. Then, if you keep your promises unbroken, my  beauty shall never change, no, not until the tall vegetable flag-reeds  wave and the long green rushes grow in your hall.\"    The Prince of Powys was quite ready to swear this oath and he solemnly  promised to observe the three conditions. So the Maid of the Green  Forest went to live with him.    \"But what of his old wife?\" one asks.    Ah! he had no trouble from that quarter, for when the newly-wedded  couple arrived at the castle, she had already disappeared.    Happy, indeed, were the long bright days, which the prince and his new  bride spent together, whether in the castle, or out doors, riding on  horseback, or in hunting the deer. Every day, her beauty seemed  diviner, and she more lovely. He lavished various gifts upon her,  among others that of a diadem of beryl and sapphire. Then he put on  her finger a diamond ring worth what was a very great sum--a king's  ransom. In the Middle Ages, monarchs as well as nobles were taken  prisoners in battle and large amounts of money had to be paid to get  them back again. So a king's ransom is what Benlli paid for his wife's  diamond ring. He loved her so dearly that he never suspected for a  moment that he would ever have any trouble in keeping his three  promises.    But without variety, life has no spice, and monotony wearies the soul.  After nine years had passed, and his wife absented herself every  Friday night, he began to wonder why it could be. His curiosity, to  know the reason for her going away, so increased that it so wore on  him that he became both miserable in himself and irritable toward  others. Everybody in the castle noticed the change in their master,  and grieved over it.    One night, he invited a learned monk from the white monastery, not far  away, to come and take dinner with him. The table in the great  banqueting hall was spread with the most delicious viands, the lights  were magnificent, and the music gay.    But Wyland, the monk, was a man of magic and could see through things.  He noticed that some secret grief was preying upon the Prince's mind.  He discerned that, amidst all this splendor, he, Benlli, the lord of  the castle, was the most miserable person within its walls. So Wyland  went home, resolved to call again and find out what was the trouble.    When they met, some days later, Wyland's greeting was this:    \"Christ save thee, Benlli! What secret sorrow clouds thy brow? Why so  gloomy?\"    Benlli at once burst out with the story of how he met the Maid of the  Green Forest, and how she became his wife on three conditions.    \"Think of it,\" said Benlli, groaning aloud. \"When the owls cry and the  crickets chirp, my wife leaves my bed, and until the daystar appears,  I lie alone, torn with curiosity, to know where she is, and what she  is doing. I fall again into heavy sleep, and do not awake until  sunrise, when I find her by my side again. It is all such a mystery,  that the secret lies heavy on my soul. Despite all my wealth, and my  strong castle, with feasting and music by night and hunting by day, I  am the most miserable man in Cymric land. No beggar is more wretched  than I.\"    Wyland, the monk, listened and his eyes glittered. There came into his  head the idea of enriching the monastery. He saw his chance, and  improved it at once. He could make money by solving the secret for a  troubled soul.    \"Prince Benlli,\" said he, \"if you will bestow upon the monks of the  White Minster, one tenth of all the flocks that feed within your  domain, and one tenth of all that flows into the vaults of your  palace, and hand over the Maiden of the Green Forest to me, I shall  warrant that your soul will be at peace and your troubles end.\"    To all this, Prince Benlli agreed, making solemn promise. Then the  monk Wyland took his book, leather bound, and kept shut by means of  metal clasps, and hid himself in the cranny of a rock near the Giant's  Cave, from which there was entrance down into Fairyland.    He had not long to wait, for soon, with a crown on her head, a lady,  royally arrayed, passed by out of the silvery moonlight into the dark  cave. It was none other than the Maiden of the Green Forest.    Now came a battle of magic and spells, as between the monk's own and  those of the Green Forest Maiden. He moved forward to the mouth of the  cave. Then summoning into his presence the spirits of the air and the  cave, he informed them as to Benlli's vow to enrich the monastery, and  to deliver the Green Forest Maiden to himself. Then, calling aloud, he  said:    \"Let her forever be, as she now appears, and never leave my side.\"    \"Bring her, before the break of day, to the cross near the town of the  White Minster, and there will I wed her, and swear to make her my  own.\"    Then, by the power of his magic, he made it impossible for any person  or power to recall or hinder the operation of these words. Leaving the  cave's mouth, in order to be at the cross, before day should dawn, the  first thing he met was a hideous ogress, grinning and rolling her  bleared red eyes at him. On her head seemed what was more like moss,  than hair. She stretched out a long bony finger at him. On it, flashed  the splendid diamond, which Benlli had given his bride, the beautiful  Maid of the Green Forest.    \"Take me to thy bosom, monk Wyland,\" she shrieked, laughing hideously  and showing what looked like green snags in her mouth. \"For I am the  wife you are sworn to wed. Thirty years ago, I was Benlli's blooming  bride. When my beauty left me, his love flew out of the window. Now I  am a foul ogress, but magic makes me young again every seventh night.  I promised that my beauty should last until the tall flag reeds and  the long green rushes grow in his hall.\"    Amazed at her story, Wyland drew in his breath.    \"And this promise, I have kept. It is already fulfilled. Your spell  and mine are both completed. Yours brought to him the peace of the  dead. Mine made the river floods rush in. Now, waters lap to and fro  among the reeds and rushes that grow in the banqueting hall, which is  now sunk deep below the earth. With the clash of our spells, no charm  can redress our fate.    \"Come then and take me as thy bride, for oath and spell have both  decreed it as thy reward. As Benlli's promise to you is fulfilled, for  the waters flow in the palace vaults, the pike and the dare (fish)  feed there.\"    So, caught in his own dark, sordid plot, the monk, who played  conjurer, had become the victim of his own craft.    They say that Wyland's Cross still recalls the monk, while fishermen  on the Welsh border, can, on nights with smooth water, see towers and  chimneys far below, sunk deep beneath the waves.          XI      THE TREASURE STONE OF THE FAIRIES      The Gruffyds were one of the largest of the Welsh tribes. To-day, it  is said that in Britain one man in every forty has this, as either his  first, middle, or last name. It means \"hero\" or \"brave man,\" and as  far back as the ninth century, the word is found in the Book of Saint  Chad.    The monks, who derived nearly every name from the Latin, insisted the  word meant Great Faith.    Another of the most common of Welsh personal names was William; which,  when that of a father's son, was written Williams and was only the  Latin for Gild Helm, or Golden Helmet.    Long ago, when London was a village and Cardiff only a hamlet, there  was a boy of this name, who tended sheep on the hill sides. His father  was a hard working farmer, who every year tried to coax to grow out of  the stony ground some oats, barley, leeks and cabbage. In summer, he  worked hard, from the first croak of the raven to the last hoot of the  owl, to provide food for his wife and baby daughter. When his boy was  born, he took him to the church to be christened Gruffyd, but every  body called him \"Gruff.\" In time several little sisters came to keep  the boy company.

THERE WAS A MONKEY      There was a monkey climbed up a tree,    When he fell down, then down fell he.      There was a crow sat on a stone,    When he was gone, then there was none.      There was an old wife did eat an apple,    When she had eat two, she had eat a couple.      There was a horse going to the mill,    When he went on, he stood not still.      There was a butcher cut his thumb,    When it did bleed, then blood did come.      There was a lackey ran a race,    When he ran fast, he ran apace.

THE GUINEA  PIG      There was a little Guinea-pig,    Who, being little, was not big;    He always walked upon his feet,    And never fasted when he eat.      When from a place he ran away,    He never at that place did stay;    And while he ran, as I am told,    He ne'er stood still for young or old.      He often squeaked, and sometimes vi'lent,    And when he squeaked he ne'er was silent:    Though ne'er instructed by a cat,    He knew a mouse was not a rat.      One day, as I am certified,    He took a whim, and fairly died;    And as I'm told by men of sense,    He never has been living since!                              _Anonymous_.
