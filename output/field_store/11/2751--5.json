Some were for decreeing her the general title of Mother; others the more  particular one of Mother Of Her Country; and almost all moved, that to  the name of Tiberius should be added, The Son Of Julia: Tiberius urged  in answer, that \"public honours to women ought to be warily adjudged,  and with a sparing hand; and that with the same measure of moderation he  would receive such as were presented to himself.\" In truth, full of envy  as he was, and anxious lest his own grandeur should sink as that of his  mother rose, he would not suffer so much as a Lictor to be decreed her,  and even forbade the raising her an altar upon her late adoption,  or paying her any such solemnities. But for Germanicus he asked the  Proconsular power; and to carry him that dignity, honourable deputies  were sent, as also to mollify his sorrow for the death of Augustus. If  for Drusus he demanded not the same honour, it was because Drusus was  present and already Consul designed. He then named twelve candidates  for the Praetorship; the same number settled by Augustus; and though the  Senate requested him to increase it, by an oath he bound himself never  to exceed.    The privilege of creating Magistrates was now first translated from  the assemblies of the people to the Senate; for though the Emperor had  before conducted all affairs of moment at his pleasure; yet till that  day some were still transacted by the Tribes, and carried by their bent  and suffrages. Neither did the regret of the people for the seizure of  these their ancient rights rise higher than some impotent grumbling. The  Senate too liked the change; as by it they were released from the charge  of buying votes, and from the shame of begging them: and so moderate was  Tiberius, that of the twelve candidates he only reserved to himself the  recommendation of four, to be accepted without opposition or caballing.  At the same time, the Tribunes of the people asked leave to celebrate at  their own expense certain plays in honour of Augustus, such as were  to be called after his name, and inserted in the calendar. But it was  decreed, that out of the Exchequer the charge should be defrayed, and  the Tribunes should in the circus wear the triumphal robe; but to be  carried in chariots was denied them. The annual celebration of these  plays was, for the future, transferred to one of the Praetors, him  in particular to whom should fall the jurisdiction of deciding suits  between citizens and strangers.    Thus stood affairs at Rome when a sedition seized the legions in  Pannonia; without any fresh grounds, save that from a change of Princes,  they meant to assume a warrant for licentiousness and tumult, and from a  civil war hoped great earnings and acquisitions: they were three legions  encamped together, all commanded by Junius Blesus, who, upon notice of  the death of Augustus and the accession of Tiberius, had granted the  soldiers a recess from their wonted duties for some days, as a time  either of public mourning or festivity. From being idle they waxed  wanton, quarrelsome, and turbulent; greedily listened to mutinous  discourses; the most profligate amongst them had most credit with them,  and at last they became passionate for a life of sloth and riot, utterly  averse to all military discipline and every fatigue of the camp. In the  camp was one Percennius; formerly a busy leader in the embroilments  of the theatre, and now a common soldier; a fellow of a petulant,  declaiming tongue, and by inflaming parties in the playhouse, well  qualified to excite and infatuate a crowd. This incendiary practised  upon the ignorant and unwary, such as were solicitous what might prove  their future usage, now Augustus was dead. He engaged them in nightly  confabulations, and by little and little incited them to violence and  disorders; and towards the evening, when the soberest and best affected  were withdrawn, he assembled the worst and most turbulent. When he  had thus ripened them for sedition, and other ready incendiaries were  combined with him, he personated the character of a lawful Commander,  and thus questioned and harangued them:    \"Why did they obey, like slaves, a few Centurions and a fewer Tribunes?  When would they be bold enough to demand redress of their heavy  grievances, unless they snatched the present occasion, while the Emperor  was yet new and his authority wavering, to prevail with him by petition,  or by arms to force him? They had already by the misery of many years  paid dear for their patient sloth and stupid silence, since decrepit  with age and maimed with wounds, after a course of service for thirty or  forty years, they were still doomed to carry arms: nor even to those who  were discharged was there any end of the misery of warfare; they were  still kept tied to the colours, and under the creditable title of  Veterans endured the same hardships, and underwent the same labours.  But suppose any of them escaped so many dangers, and survived so many  calamities, where was their reward at last? Why, a long and weary march  remained yet to be taken into countries far remote and strange; where,  under the name of lands given them to cultivate, they had unhospitable  bogs to drain, and the wild wastes of mountains to manure. Severe and  ungainful of itself was the occupation of war: ten Asses [Footnote:  About 5d.] a day the poor price of their persons and lives; out of this,  they must buy clothes, and tents, and arms; out of this, bribe the cruel  Centurions for a forbearance of blows, and occasional exemption from  hard duty: but stripes from their officers, and wounds from their  enemies, hard winters and laborious summers, bloody wars and barren  peace, were miseries without end: nor remained there other cure or  relief than to refuse to enlist but upon conditions certain, and fixed  by themselves; particularly, that their pay be a denarius or sixteen  Asses a day, [Footnote: About 8-1/2d.] sixteen years be the utmost  term of serving; when discharged, to be no longer obliged to follow the  colours, but have their reward in ready money, paid them in the camp  where they earned it. Did the Praetorian Guards, they who had double  pay, they who after sixteen years' service were paid off and sent home,  bear severer difficulties, undergo superior dangers? He did not mean to  detract from the merit of their brethren the City guards; their own lot  however it was, to be placed amongst horrid and barbarous nations, nor  could they look from their tents, but they saw the foe.\"    The whole crowd received this harangue with shouts of applause; but  from various instigations. Some displayed upon their bodies the obvious  impressions of stripes, others their hoary heads, many their vestments  ragged and curtailed, with backs utterly bare; as did all, their various  griefs, in the bitterness of reproach. At length to such excessive fury  they grew, that they proposed to incorporate the three legions into  one; nor by aught but emulation was the project defeated: for to his own  legion every man claimed the prerogative of swallowing and denominating  the other two. They took another method, and placed the three Eagles  of the legions, with the standards of the several cohorts, altogether  without rank or priority; then forthwith digged turf and were rearing  a tribunal, one high enough to be seen at a distance. In this  hurry arrived Blesus, who, falling into sore rebukes, and by force  interrupting particulars, called with vehemence to all: \"Dip your hands  rather in my blood: to murder your General will be a crime less shameful  and heinous than to revolt from your Prince; for determined I am, either  to preserve the legions in their faith and obedience, if you kill me not  for my intended good office; or my death, if I fall by your hands, shall  hasten your remorse.\"    For all this, turfs were accumulated, and the work was already breast  high, when, at last, overcome by his spirit and perseverance, they  forbore. Blesus was an able speaker: he told them \"that sedition and  mutiny were not the methods of conveying to the Emperor the pretensions  of the soldiers; their demands too were new and singular; such as  neither the soldiers of old had ever made to the ancient Generals, nor  they themselves to the deified Augustus: besides, their claims were  ill-timed, when the Prince, just upon his accession, was already  embarrassed with the weight and variety of other cares. If, however,  they meant to try to gain in full peace those concessions, which, even  after a civil war, the conquerors never claimed; yet why trample upon  duty and obedience, why reject the laws of the army, and rules of  discipline? And if they meant to petition, why meditate violence? They  might at least appoint deputies; and in his presence trust them with  their pretensions.\" Here they all cried out, \"that the son of Blesus,  one of their Tribunes, should execute that deputation; and demand in  their name that, after sixteen years' service they should be discharged:  they said they would give him new orders, when he had succeeded in  these.\" After the departure of the young officer, a moderate recess  ensued; the soldiers however exulted to have carried such a point:  the sending the son of their General, as the public advocate for their  cause, was to them full proof that they had gained by force and terror  that which by modesty and gentle means they would never have gained.    In the meantime those companies which, before the sedition began, were  sent to Nauportum [Footnote: Over-Laybach, in Carniola.] to mend roads  and bridges, and upon other duties, no sooner heard of the uproar in  the camp, but they cast off all obedience, tore away the ensigns, and  plundered the neighbouring villages; even Nauportum itself, which for  greatness resembled a municipal town, was plundered.

Other grounds for distinction are  found in language, customs beliefs, and general intelligence.    CLASSIFICATION OF RACES    If we take complexion or color as the basis of classification, it is  possible to distinguish a few large racial groups. Each of these groups  occupies, roughly speaking, its separate area of the globe. The most  familiar classification is that which recognizes the Black or Negro race  dwelling in Africa, the Yellow or Mongolian race whose home is in central  and eastern Asia, and the White or Caucasian race of western Asia and  Europe. Sometimes two additional divisions are made by including, as the  Red race, the American Indians, and as the Brown race, the natives of the  Pacific islands.    THE WHITE RACE    These separate racial groups have made very unequal progress in culture.  The peoples belonging to the Black, Red, and Brown races are still either  savages or barbarians, as were the men of prehistoric times. The Chinese  and Japanese are the only representatives of the Yellow race that have  been able to form civilized states. In the present, as in the past, it is  chiefly the members of the White race who are developing civilization and  making history.    INDO-EUROPEANS AND SEMITES    Because of differences in language, scholars have divided the White or  Caucasian race into two main groups, called Indo-Europeans and Semites.  [14] This classification is often helpful, but the student should remember  that Indo-European and Semitic peoples are not always to be sharply  distinguished because they have different types of language. There is no  very clear distinction in physical characteristics between the two groups.  A clear skin, an oval face, wavy or curly hair, and regular features  separate them from both the Negro and the Mongolian.    PRINCIPAL INDO-EUROPEAN PEOPLES    The Indo-Europeans in antiquity included the Hindus of India, the Medes  and Persians dwelling on the plateau of Iran, the Greeks and Italians, and  most of the inhabitants of central and western Europe. All these peoples  spoke related languages which are believed to be offshoots from one common  tongue. Likeness in language does not imply that all Indo-Europeans were  closely related in blood. Men often adopt a foreign tongue and pass it on  to their children.    PRINCIPAL SEMITIC PEOPLES    The various Semitic nations dwelling in western Asia and Arabia were more  closely connected with one another. They spoke much the same type of  language, and in physical traits and habits of life they appear to have  been akin. The Semites in antiquity included the Babylonians and  Assyrians, the Hebrews, Phoenicians, and Arabs.    [Illustration: RACE PORTRAITURE OF THE EGYPTIANS  Paintings on the walls of royal tombs. The Egyptians were painted red, the  Semites yellow, the Negroes black, and the Libyans white, with blue eyes  and fair beards. Each racial type is distinguished by peculiar dress and  characteristic features.]    [Illustration: Map. Distribution of SEMITIC and INDO-EUROPEAN PEOPLES]  PEOPLES OF UNCERTAIN RELATIONSHIP    At the opening of the historic period still other parts of the World were  the homes of various peoples who cannot be classed with certainty as  either Indo-Europeans or Semites. Among these were the Egyptians and some  of the inhabitants of Asia Minor. We must remember that, during the long  prehistoric ages, repeated conquests and migrations mingled the blood of  many different communities. History, in fact, deals with no unmixed  peoples.

Enumerate the most important contributions to civilization made in  prehistoric times.      FOOTNOTES    [1] There are still some savage peoples, for instance, the Australians,  who continue to make stone implements very similar to those of prehistoric  men. Other primitive peoples, such as the natives of the Pacific islands,  passed directly from the use of stone to that of iron, after this part of  the world was opened up to European trade in the nineteenth century.    [2] Iron was unknown to the inhabitants of North America and South America  before the coming of the Europeans. The natives used many stone  implements, besides those of copper and bronze. The Indians got most of  their copper from the mines in the Lake Superior region, whence it was  carried far and wide.    [3] See the illustration, page 45.    [4] See the illustration, page 14.    [5] In the New World, the only important domestic animal was the llama of  the Andes. The natives used it as a beast of burden, ate its flesh, and  clothed themselves with its wool.    [6] The plants domesticated in the New World were not numerous. The most  important were the potato of Peru and Ecuador, Indian corn or maize,  tobacco, the tomato, and manioc. From the roots of the latter, the starch  called tapioca is derived.    [7] See page 2.    [8] See the illustration, page 14.    [9] Latin cuneus, \"a wedge\".    [10] See page 71.    [11] From the Greek words hieros, \"holy,\" and glyphein, \"to carve\" The  Egyptians regarded their signs as sacred.    [12] Our word \"alphabet\" comes from the names of the first two letters of  the Greek alphabet, _alpha_ (a) and _beta_ (b).    [13] See page 186 and note 2.    [14] The Old Testament (_Genesis_, x 21-22) represents Shem (or Sem), son  of Noah, as the ancestor of the Semitic peoples. The title \"Indo-  Europeans\" tells us that the members of that group now dwell in India and  in Europe. Indo-European peoples are popularly called \"Aryans,\" from a  word in Sanskrit (the old Hindu language) meaning \"noble.\"          CHAPTER II    THE LANDS AND PEOPLES OF THE EAST TO ABOUT 600 B.C. [1]      7. PHYSICAL ASIA    GRAND DIVISIONS OF ASIA    Ancient history begins in the East--in Asia and in that part of Africa  called Egypt, which the peoples of antiquity always regarded as belonging  to Asia. If we look at a physical map of Asia, we see at once that it  consists of two very unequal divisions separated by an almost continuous  mass of mountains and deserts. These two divisions are Farther and Nearer,  or Eastern and Western, Asia.    [Illustration: Map, PHYSICAL MAP OF ASIA.]    FARTHER ASIA    Farther Asia begins at the center of the continent with a series of  elevated table-lands which rise into the lofty plateaus, known as the  \"Roof of the World.\" Here two tremendous mountain chains diverge. The  Altai range runs out to the northeast and reaches the shores of the  Pacific near Bering Strait. The Himalaya range extends southeast to the  Malay peninsula. In the angle formed by their intersection lies the cold  and barren region of East Turkestan and Tibet, the height of which, in  some places, is ten thousand feet above the sea. From these mountains and  plateaus the ground sinks gradually toward the north into the lowlands of  West Turkestan and Siberia, toward the east and south into the plains of  China and India.    CHINA    The fertile territory of central China, watered by the two streams,  Yangtse and Hoangho, was settled at a remote period by barbarous tribes.  The civilization which they slowly developed in antiquity has endured with  little change until the present day. The inhabitants of neighboring  countries, Korea, Japan, and Indo-China, owe much to this civilization. It  has exerted slight influence on the other peoples of Asia because the  Chinese have always occupied a distant corner of the continent, cut off by  deserts and mountains from the lands on the west. As if these barriers  were not enough, they raised the Great Wall to protect their country from  invasion.    [Illustration: THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA  The wall extends for about fifteen hundred miles along the northern  frontier of China. In 1908 AD it was traversed for its entire length by an  American Mr. W. E. Geil. He found many parts of the fortification still in  good repair, though built twenty one centuries ago.]    Behind this mighty rampart the Chinese have lived secluded and aloof from  the progress of our western world. In ancient times China was a land of  mystery.    INDIA    India was better known than China, especially its two great rivers, the  Indus and the Ganges, which flow to the southwest and southeast,  respectively, and make this part of the peninsula one of the most fertile  territories on the globe. Such a land attracted immigrants. The region now  known as the Punjab, where the Indus receives the waters of five great  streams, was settled by light-skinned Indo-Europeans [2] perhaps as early "]]]
