Mr. Caldwell's Chinese hunter, Da-Da, lived at Lung-tao and we found his  house to be one of several built on the outskirts of a beautiful grove of  gum and banyan trees. Although it was exceptionally clean for a Chinese  dwelling, we pitched our tents a short distance away. At first we were  somewhat doubtful about sleeping outside, but after one night indoors we  decided that any risk was preferable to spending another hour in the  stifling heat of the house.    It was probable that a tiger would be so suspicious of the white tents that  it would not attack us, but nevertheless during the first nights we were  rather wakeful and more than once at some strange night sound seized our  rifles and flashed the electric lamp into the darkness.    Tigers often come into this village. Only a few hundred yards from our camp  site, in 1911, a tiger had rushed into the house of one of the peasants and  attempted to steal a child that had fallen asleep at its play under the  family table. All was quiet in the house when suddenly the animal dashed  through the open door. The Chinese declare that the gods protected the  infant, for the beast missed his prey and seizing the leg of the table  against which the baby's head was resting, bolted through the door dragging  the table into the courtyard.    This was the work of the famous \"blue tiger\" which we had come to hunt and  which had on two occasions been seen by Mr. Caldwell. The first time he  heard of this strange beast was in the spring of 1910. The animal was  reported as having been seen at various places within an area of a few  miles almost simultaneously and so mysterious were its movements that the  Chinese declared it was a spirit of the devil. After several unsuccessful  hunts Mr. Caldwell finally saw the tiger at close range but as he was armed  with only a shotgun it would have been useless to shoot.    His second view of the beast was a few weeks later and in the same place. I  will give the story in his own words:    \"I selected a spot upon a hill-top and cleared away the grass and ferns  with a jack-knife for a place to tie the goat. I concealed myself in the  bushes ten feet away to await the attack, but the unexpected happened and  the tiger approached from the rear.    \"When I first saw the beast he was moving stealthily along a little trail  just across a shallow ravine. I supposed, of course, that he was trying to  locate the goat which was bleating loudly, but to my horror I saw that he  was creeping upon two boys who had entered the ravine to cut grass. The  huge brute moved along lizard-fashion for a few yards and then cautiously  lifted his head above the grass. He was within easy springing distance when  I raised my rifle, but instantly I realized that if I wounded the animal  the boys would certainly meet a horrible death.    \"Tigers are usually afraid of the human voice so instead of firing I  stepped from the bushes, yelling and waving my arms. The huge cat, crouched  for a spring, drew back, wavered uncertainly for a moment, and then slowly  slipped away into the grass. The boys were saved but I had lost the  opportunity I had sought for over a year.    \"However, I had again seen the animal about which so many strange tales had  been told. The markings of the beast are strikingly beautiful. The ground  color is of a delicate shade of maltese, changing into light gray-blue on  the underparts. The stripes are well defined and like those of the ordinary  yellow tiger.\"    Before I left New York Mr. Caldwell had written me repeatedly urging me to  stop at Futsing on the way to YÃ¼n-nan to try with him for the blue tiger  which was still in the neighborhood. I was decidedly skeptical as to its  being a distinct species, but nevertheless it was a most interesting animal  and would certainly be well worth getting.    I believed then, and my opinion has since been strengthened, that it is a  partially melanistic phase of the ordinary yellow tiger. Black leopards are  common in India and the Malay Peninsula and as only a single individual of  the blue tiger has been reported the evidence hardly warrants the  assumption that it represents a distinct species.    We hunted the animal for five weeks. The brute ranged in the vicinity of  two or three villages about seven miles apart, but was seen most frequently  near Lung-tao. He was as elusive as a will o' the wisp, killing a dog or  goat in one village and by the time we had hurried across the mountains  appearing in another spot a few miles away, leaving a trail of terrified  natives who flocked to our camp to recount his depredations. He was in  truth the \"Great Invisible\" and it seemed impossible that we should not get  him sooner or later, but we never did.    Once we missed him by a hair's breadth through sheer bad luck, and it was  only by exercising almost superhuman restraint that we prevented ourselves  from doing bodily harm to the three Chinese who ruined our hunt. Every  evening for a week we had faithfully taken a goat into the \"Long Ravine,\"  for the blue tiger had been seen several times near this lair. On the  eighth afternoon we were in the \"blind\" at three o'clock as usual. We had  tied a goat to a tree nearby and her two kids were but a few feet away.    The grass-filled lair lay shimmering in the breathless heat, silent save  for the echoes of the bleating goats. Crouched behind the screen of  branches, for three long hours we sat in the patchwork shade,--motionless,  dripping with perspiration, hardly breathing,--and watched the shadows  steal slowly down the narrow ravine.    It was a wild place which seemed to have been cut out of the mountain side  with two strokes of a mighty ax and was choked with a tangle of thorny  vines and sword grass. Impenetrable as a wall of steel, the only entrance  was by the tiger tunnels which drove their twisting way through the  murderous growth far in toward its gloomy heart.    The shadows had passed over us and just reached a lone palm tree on the  opposite hillside. By that I knew it was six o'clock and in half an hour  another day of disappointment would be ended. Suddenly at the left and just  below us there came the faintest crunching sound as a loose stone shifted  under a heavy weight; then a rustling in the grass. Instantly the captive  goat gave a shrill bleat of terror and tugged frantically at the rope which  held it to the tree.    At the first sound Harry had breathed in my ear \"Get ready, he's coming.\" I  was half kneeling with my heavy .405 Winchester pushed forward and the  hammer up. The blood drummed in my ears and my neck muscles ached with the  strain but I thanked Heaven that my hands were steady.    Caldwell sat like a graven image, the stock of his little 22 caliber high  power Savage nestling against his cheek. Our eyes met for an instant and I  knew in that glance that the blue tiger would never make another charge,  for if I missed him, Harry wouldn't. For ten minutes we waited and my heart  lost a beat when twenty feet away the grass began to move again--but  rapidly and _up the ravine_.    I saw Harry watching the lair with a puzzled look which changed to one of  disgust as a chorus of yells sounded across the ravine and three Chinese  wood cutters appeared on the opposite slope. They were taking a short cut  home, shouting to drive away the tigers--and they had succeeded only too  well, for the blue tiger had slipped back to the heart of the lair from  whence he had come.    He had been nearly ours and again we had lost him! I felt so badly that I  could not even swear and it wasn't the fact that Harry was a missionary  which kept me from it, either. Caldwell exclaimed just once, for his  disappointment was even more bitter than mine; he had been hunting this  same tiger off and on for six years.    It was useless for us to wait longer that evening and we pushed our way  through the sword grass to the entrance of the tunnel down which the tiger  had come. There in the soft earth were the great footprints where he had  crouched at the entrance to take a cautious survey before charging into the  open.    As we looked, Harry suddenly turned to me and said: \"Roy, let's go into the  lair. There is just one chance in a thousand that we may get a shot.\" Now I  must admit that I was not very enthusiastic about that little excursion,  but in we went, crawling on our hands and knees up the narrow passage.  Every few feet we passed side branches from the main tunnel in any one of  which the tiger might easily have been lying in wait and could have killed  us as we passed. It was a foolhardy thing to do and I am free to admit that  I was scared. It was not long before Harry twisted about and said: \"Roy, I  haven't lost any tigers in here; let's get out.\" And out we came faster  than we went in.    This was only one of the times when the \"Great Invisible\" was almost in our  hands. A few days later a Chinese found the blue tiger asleep under a rice  bank early in the afternoon. Frightened almost to death he ran a mile and a  half to our camp only to find that we had left half an hour before for  another village where the brute had killed two wild cats early in the  morning.    Again, the tiger pushed open the door of a house at daybreak just as the  members of the family were getting up, stole a dog from the \"heaven's  well,\" dragged it to a hillside and partly devoured it. We were in camp  only a mile away and our Chinese hunters found the carcass on a narrow  ledge in the sword grass high up on the mountain side. The spot was an  impossible one to watch and we set a huge grizzly bear trap which had been  carried with us from New York.    It seemed out of the question for any animal to return to the carcass of  the dog without getting caught and yet the tiger did it.

This stream was one of the fastest that the  former slave can remember having seen in Florida; its power was utilised  for the turning of a power mill which he believes ground corn or other  grain. The falls in the river that turned the water mill, he states, was  at least five or six feet high, and at one point under the Falls a man  named (or possibly nicknamed) \"Yankee\" operated a sawmill. Coker  believes that this mill, too, derived its power from the little stream.  He says that the stream has been extinct since he reached manhood. It  ended in 'Scrub Pond,' beyond Grandin and Starke.    Some of the names of the old lakes of the section were these: \"Brooklyn  Lake; Magnolia Lake; Soldier Pond (near Keystone); Half-Moon Pond, near  Putnam Hall; Hick's Lake\" and others. On one of them was the large grist  mill of Dr. McCray; Coker suggests that this might be the origin of the  town of McRae of the present period.    To add to its natural water facilities, Coker points out, Bradford  County also had a canal. This canal ran from the interior of the county  to the St. John's River near Green Cove Springs, and with Mandarin on  the other side of the river still a major shipping point, the canal  handled much of the commerce of Bradford and Clay Counties.    Coker recalls vividly the Indians of the area in the days before 1870.  These, he claims to have been friendly, but reserved, fellows; he does  not recall any of the Indian women.    Negro slaves from the region around St. Augustine and what is now  Hastings used to escape and use Bellamy's Road on their way to the area  about Micanopy. It was considered equivalent to freedom to reach that  section, with its friendly Indians and impenetrable forests and swamps.    The little town of Melrose probably had the most unusual name of all the  strange ones prevalent at the time. It was call, very simply,  \"Shake-Rag.\" Coker makes no effort to explain the appelation.      REFERENCES    1. Interview with subject, Neil Coker, Grandin, Putnam County          FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT  American Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)    Rachel Austin, Field Worker  Jacksonville, Florida    YOUNG WINSTON DAVIS      Young Winston Davis states that he was born in Ozark, Alabama, June 28,  1855 on the plantation of Charles Davis who owned about seven hundred  slaves and was considered very wealthy. Kindness and consideration for  his slaves, made them love him.    Reverend Davis was rather young during his years in slavery but when he  was asked to tell something about the days of slavery, replied: \"I  remember many things about slavery, but know they will not come to me  now; anyway, I'll tell what I can think of.\"    He tells of the use of iron pots, fireplaces with rods used to hold the  pots above the fire for cooking peas, rice, vegetables, meats, etc.; the  home-made coffee from meal, spring and well water, tanning rawhide for  leather, spinning of thread from cotton and the weaving looms.    \"There was no difference,\" he states, \"in the treatment of men and women  for work; my parents worked very hard and women did some jobs that we  would think them crazy for trying now; why my mother helped build a  railroad before she was married to my father. My mother's first husband  was sold away from her; shucks, some of the masters didn't care how they  treated husbands, wives, parents and children; any of them might be  separated from the other. A good price for a 'nigger' was $1500 on down  and if one was what was called a stallion (healthy), able to get plenty  children he would bring about $2500.    \"They had what was called legal money--I did have some of it but guess  it was burned when I lost my house by fire a few years ago.    \"Now, my master had three boys and two girls; his wife, Elizabeth, was  about like the ordinary missus; Master Davis was good, but positive; he  didn't allow other whites to bother his slaves.    \"When the war came, his two boys went first, finally Master Davis went;  he and one son never returned.    \"The Yankees killed cows, etc., as they went along but did not destroy  any property 'round where I was.    \"We had preachers and doctors, but no schools; the white preachers told  us to obey and would read the Bible (which we could not understand) and  told us not to steal eggs. Most of the doctors used herbs from the woods  and \"Aunt Jane\" and \"Uncle Bob\" were known for using \"Samson's Snake  Root,\" \"Devil's shoe-string\" for stomach troubles and \"low-bud Myrtle\"  for fevers; that's good now, chile, if you can get it.    \"The 'nigger' didn't have a chance to git in politics during slavery,  but after Emancipation, he went immediately into the Republican Party; a  few into the Democratic Party; there were many other parties, too.    \"The religions were Methodist and Baptist; my master was Baptist and  that's what I am; we could attend church but dare not try to get any  education, less we punished with straps.    \"There are many things I remember just like it was yesterday--the  general punishment was with straps--some of the slaves suffered terribly  on the plantations; if the master was poor and had few slaves he was  mean--the more wealthy or more slaves he had, the better he was. In some  cases it was the general law that made some of the masters as they were;  as, the law required them to have an overseer or foreman (he was called  \"boss man\") by the 'niggers' and usually came from the lower or poorer  classes of whites; he didn't like 'niggers' usually, and took authority  to do as he pleased with them at times. Some plantations preferred and  did have 'nigger riders' that were next to the overseer or foreman, but  they were liked better than the foreman and in many instances were  treated like foremen but the law would not let them be called \"foremen.\"  Some of the masters stood between the 'nigger riders' and foremen and  some cases, the 'nigger' was really boss.    \"The punishments, as I said were cruel--some masters would hang the  slaves up by both thumbs so that their toes just touched the floor,  women and men, alike. Many slaves ran away; others were forced by their  treatment to do all kinds of mean things. Some slaves would dig deep  holes along the route of the \"Patrollers\" and their horses would fall in  sometimes breaking the leg of the horse, arm or leg of the rider; some  slaves took advantage of the protection their masters would give them  with the overseer or other plantation owners, would do their devilment  and \"fly\" to their masters who did not allow a man from another  plantation to bother his slaves. I have known pregnant women to go ten  miles to help do some devilment. My mother was a very strong woman (as I  told you she helped build a railroad), and felt that she could whip any  ordinary man, would not get a passport unless she felt like it; once  when caught on another plantation without a passport, she had all of us  with her, made all of the children run, but wouldn't run  herself--somehow she went upstream, one of the men's horse's legs was  broken and she told him \"come and get me\" but she knew the master  allowed no one to come on his place to punish his slaves.    \"My father was a blacksmith and made the chains used for stocks, (like  handcuffs), used on legs and hands. The slaves were forced to lay flat  on their backs and were chained down to the board made for that purpose;  they were left there for hours, sometimes through rain and cold; he  might 'holler' and groan but that did not always get him released.    \"The Race became badly mixed then; some Negro women were forced into  association, some were beaten almost to death because they refused. The  Negro men dare not bother or even speak to some of their women.    \"In one instance an owner of a plantation threatened a Negro rider's  sweetheart; she told him and he went crying to this owner who in turned  threatened him and probably did hit the woman; straight to his master  this sweetheart went and when he finished his story, his master  immediately took his team and drove to the other plantation--drove so  fast that one of his horses' dropped dead; when the owner came out he  levelled his double-barrel shotgun at him and shot him dead. No, suh;  some masters did not allow you to bother their slaves.    \"A peculiar case was that of Old Jim who lived on another plantation was  left to look out for the fires and do other chores around the house  while 'marster' was at war. A bad rumor spread, and do you know those  mean devils, overseers of nearby plantations came out and got her dug a  deep hole, and despite her cries, buried her up to her neck--nothing was  left out but her head and hair. A crowd of young 'nigger boys' saw it  all and I was one among the crowd that helped dig her out.    \"Oh, there's a lots more I know but just cant get it together. My  mother's name was Caroline and my father Patrick; all took the name of  Davis from our master. There were thirteen children--I am the only one  alive.\"    Mr. Davis appears well preserved for his age; he has most of his teeth  and is slightly gray; his health seems to be good, although he is a  cripple and uses a cane for walking always; this condition he believes  is the result of an attack of rheumatism.    He is a preacher and has pastored in Alabama, Texas and Florida. He has  had several years of training in public schools and under ministers.    He has lived in Jacksonville since 1918 coming here from Waycross,  Georgia.    He was married for the first and only time during his 62 years of life  to Mrs. Lizzie P. Brown, November 19, 1935. There are no children. He  gives no reason for remaining single, but his reason for marrying was  \"to give some lady the privilege and see how it feels to be called  husband.\"      REFERENCES    1.
