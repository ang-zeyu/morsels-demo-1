At the very moment, however, that he found himself adrift Illinois was  filled with excitement over the Black Hawk War. The centre of alarm was  in the Rock Valley, in the northern part of the State, which had been  formerly the home of the Sac tribe of Indians. Discontented with their  life on the reservation west of the Mississippi, to which they had been  removed, the Sacs, with several other tribes, resolved to recover their  old hunting-grounds. The warlike chief, Black Hawk, was at the head of  the revolt, and his march toward the Rock river was signalized by a  number of massacres. Governor Reynolds of Illinois issued a proclamation  calling for volunteers to aid the regular troops in the emergency.  Lincoln was one of the first to answer the call, the brave \"Clary Grove  Boys\" also coming promptly to the rescue. \"The volunteers gathered,\"  writes Mr. Arnold, \"at Rushville, in Schuyler County, at which place  they were to be organized, and elected officers. Lincoln was a candidate  for the place of captain, and in opposition to him was one William  Kirkpatrick. The mode of election was novel. By agreement, each  candidate walked off to some distance and took position by himself. The  men were then to form, and those who voted for Kirkpatrick were to range  on a line with their candidate. When the lines were formed, Lincoln's  was three times as long as that of Kirkpatrick, and so Lincoln was  declared elected. Speaking of this affair when President, he said that  he was more gratified with this his first success than with any other  election of his life. Neither Lincoln nor his company was in any  engagement during the campaign, but there was plenty of hardships and  fatigue, and some incidents occurred to illustrate his courage and power  over men.\"    Many years afterward--in fact, while Lincoln was President--he referred  to those early scenes in a way that illustrates his wonderful memory and  his power of recalling the minutest incidents of his past life. Meeting  an old Illinois friend, he naturally fell to talking of Illinois, and  related several stories of his early life in that region. Particularly  he remembered his share in the Black Hawk War. He referred to his part  of the campaign lightly, and said that he saw but very little fighting.  But he remembered coming on a camp of white scouts one morning just as  the sun was rising. The Indians had surprised the camp and killed and  scalped every man. \"I remember just how those men looked,\" said Lincoln,  \"as we rode up the little hill where their camp was. The red light of  the morning sun was streaming upon them as they lay, heads toward us, on  the ground, and every man had a round red spot on the top of his head,  about as big as a dollar, where the redskins had taken his scalp. It was  frightful, but it was grotesque, and the red sunlight seemed to paint  everything all over.\" Lincoln paused as if recalling the vivid picture,  and added, somewhat irrelevantly, \"I remember that one man had buckskin  breeches on.\"    Lincoln also told a good story of his first experience in drilling raw  troops during the Black Hawk War. He was crossing a field with a front  of twenty men when he came to a gate through which it was necessary to  pass. In describing the incident he said: \"I could not, for the life of  me, remember the proper word of command for getting my company  _endwise_, so that it could pass through the gate. So, as we came near  the gate, I shouted, 'Halt! this company is dismissed for two minutes,  when it will fall in again on the other side of the gate.'\" The  manoeuvre was successfully executed.    During this campaign an incident occurred which well serves to show  Lincoln's keen sense of justice, his great common sense, and his  resoluteness when aroused. One day there came to the camp an old Indian,  footsore and hungry. He was provided with a letter of safe-conduct from  General Cass; but there was a feeling of great irritation against the  Indians, and the men objected strongly to receiving him. They pronounced  him a spy and his passport a forgery, and were rushing upon the  defenseless Indian to kill him, when the tall figure of their captain,  Lincoln, suddenly appeared between them and their victim. His men had  never seen him so aroused, and they cowed before him. \"Men,\" said he,  \"this must not be done! He must not be killed by us!\" His voice and  manner produced an effect on the mob. They paused, listened, fell back,  and sullenly obeyed him, although there were still some murmurs of  disappointed rage. At length one man, probably thinking he spoke for the  crowd, cried out: \"This is cowardly on your part, Lincoln!\" Lincoln only  gazed with contempt on the men who would have murdered one unarmed  Indian but who quailed before his single hand. \"If any man thinks I am a  coward,\" said he, \"let him test it.\" \"Lincoln,\" was the reply, \"you are  larger and heavier than any of us.\" \"That you can guard against,\"  responded the captain. \"Choose your weapons!\" The insubordination ended,  and the word \"coward\" was never associated with Lincoln's name again. He  afterward said that at this time he felt that his life and character  were both at stake, and would probably have been lost had he not at the  supreme moment forgotten the officer and asserted the man. His men could  hardly have been called soldiers. They were merely armed citizens, with  a military organization in name only. Had he ordered them under arrest  he would have created a serious mutiny; and to have them tried and  punished would have been impossible.    It was while Lincoln was a militia captain that he made the acquaintance  of a man who was destined to have an important influence on his life.  This was Major John T. Stuart, afterwards his law-partner. Stuart was  already a lawyer by profession. During the Black Hawk War he commanded  one of the Sangamon County companies, and was soon afterward elected  major of a spy battalion formed from some of these companies. He had the  best of opportunities at this time to observe the merits of Captain  Lincoln, and testifies that the latter was exceedingly popular among the  soldiers on account of his excellent care of the men in his command, his  never-failing good nature, and his ability to tell more stories and  better ones than any man in the service. He was popular also among these  hardy men on account of his great physical strength. For several years  after the Black Hawk War Lincoln retained his military title and was  usually addressed as \"Captain Lincoln.\" But this in time was  discontinued. Stuart's title of \"Major,\" on the contrary, adhered to him  through life. He was best known as \"Major Stuart\" down to the time of  his death, which occurred early in the winter of 1886.    The time for which Captain Lincoln's company enlisted soon ran by, but  the trouble with the Indians not being ended Governor Reynolds called  for a second body of volunteers. Lincoln again responded, and was  enrolled as a private in the independent company commanded by Elijah  Iles of Springfield. A note of this occurrence, made in 1868 by Captain  Iles, contains the following statement: \"The term of Governor Reynolds's  first call being about to expire, he made a second call, and the first  levy was disbanded. I was elected a captain of one of the companies. We  were mustered into service on the 29th of May, 1832, at the mouth of Fox  river, now Ottawa, by Lieutenant Robert Anderson, Assistant Inspector  General in the United States Army.\"    One day during the Black Hawk War there were in the camp on Rock river  four men afterward famed in the history of the country. It was while  Lincoln was a member of the company under command of Captain Iles. These  men were Lieutenant Colonel Zachary Taylor, Lieutenant Jefferson Davis,  Lieutenant Robert Anderson, and Private Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln and  Anderson did not meet again until 1861, after the latter had evacuated  Fort Sumter. Major Anderson then visited Washington and called at the  White House to pay his respects to the President. After having expressed  his thanks to Anderson for his conduct in South Carolina, Lincoln said,  \"Major, do you remember ever meeting me before?\" \"No, Mr. President, I  do not remember having had the pleasure before,\" said Anderson. \"Well,\"  said Lincoln, \"my memory is better than yours. You mustered me into the  service of the United States in 1832 at Dixon's Ferry, during the Black  Hawk War.\"    Lincoln displayed the same courage and fidelity in performing the duties  of a soldier that had marked his conduct in all other relations of life.  Father Dixon, the guide who was attached to Captain Iles's company of  mounted rangers, remarks that in their marches when scouts were sent  forward to examine thickets and ravines in which it was thought the  enemy might be lurking it often became necessary for many of the men to  dismount and attend to their riding gear. Whenever Lincoln was detailed  for such service, however, his saddle was always in order.    During the contest between General Lewis Cass and General Zachary Taylor  for the Presidency, in the year 1848, Lincoln made a speech in Congress  in which he referred to his services in the Black Hawk War with  characteristic humor:    \"By the way, Mr. Speaker,\" he said, \"did you know that I am a military  hero? Yes, sir. In the days of the Black Hawk War I fought, bled, and  came away. Speaking of General Cass's career reminds me of my own. I was  not at Stillman's defeat, but I was about as near it as Cass was to  Hull's surrender, and, like him, I saw the place very soon afterwards.  It is quite certain that I did not break my sword, for I had none to  break. But I bent my musket pretty badly on one occasion. If Cass broke  his sword the idea is that he broke it in desperation. I bent my musket  by accident. If General Cass went ahead of me in picking whortleberries,  I guess I surpassed him in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14006"],[0,"An English Grammar (#11)"],[1," (with the forms  _whose_ and _whom_), _which_, and _what_.    [Sidenote: _One obsolete._]    There is an old word, _whether_, used formerly to mean which of two,  but now obsolete. Examples from the Bible:--         _Whether_ of them twain did the will of his father?         _Whether_ is greater, the gold, or the temple?    From Steele (eighteenth century):--         It may be a question _whether_ of these unfortunate persons had       the greater soul.      [Sidenote: _Use of_ who _and its forms._]    98. The use of _who_, with its possessive and objective, is seen in  these sentences:--         _Who_ is she in bloody coronation robes from Rheims?--DE QUINCEY.         _Whose_ was that gentle voice, that, whispering sweet,       Promised, methought, long days of bliss sincere?--BOWLES.         What doth she look on? _Whom_ doth she behold?--WORDSWORTH.    From these sentences it will be seen that interrogative _who_ refers  to _persons only_; that it is not inflected for gender or number, but  for case alone, having three forms; it is always third person, as it  always asks _about_ somebody.      [Sidenote: _Use of_ which.]    99. Examples of the use of interrogative _which_:--         _Which_ of these had speed enough to sweep between the question       and the answer, and divide the one from the other?--DE QUINCEY.         _Which_ of you, shall we say, doth love us most?--SHAKESPEARE.         _Which_ of them [the sisters] shall I take?--_Id._    As shown here, _which_ is not inflected for gender, number, or case;  it refers to either persons or things; it is selective, that is, picks  out one or more from a number of known persons or objects.      [Sidenote: _Use of_ what.]    100. Sentences showing the use of interrogative _what_:--         Since I from Smaylho'me tower have been,       _What_ did thy lady do?--SCOTT.         _What_ is so rare as a day in June?--LOWELL.         _What_ wouldst thou do, old man?--SHAKESPEARE.    These show that _what_ is not inflected for case; that it is always  singular and neuter, referring to things, ideas, actions, etc., not to  persons.        DECLENSION OF INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS.      101. The following are all the interrogative forms:--             SING. AND PLUR.   SING. AND PLUR.    SINGULAR    _Nom._       who?              which?           what?  _Poss._      whose?             --               --  _Obj._       whom?             which?           what?    In spoken English, _who_ is used as objective instead of _whom_; as,  \"_Who_ did you see?\" \"_Who_ did he speak to?\"      [Sidenote: _To tell the case of interrogatives._]    102. The interrogative _who_ has a separate form for each case,  consequently the case can be told by the form of the word; but the  case of _which_ and _what_ must be determined exactly as in nouns,--by  the _use_ of the words.    For instance, in Sec. 99, _which_ is nominative in the first sentence,  since it is subject of the verb _had_; nominative in the second also,  subject of _doth love_; objective in the last, being the direct  object of the verb _shall take_.      [Sidenote: _Further treatment of_ who, which _and_ what.]    103. _Who_, _which_, and _what_ are also relative pronouns; _which_  and _what_ are sometimes adjectives; _what_ may be an adverb in some  expressions.    They will be spoken of again in the proper places, especially in the  treatment of indirect questions (Sec. 127).        RELATIVE PRONOUNS.      [Sidenote: _Function of the relative pronoun_.]    104. Relative pronouns differ from both personal and interrogative  pronouns in referring to an antecedent, and also in having a  conjunctive use. The advantage in using them is to unite short  statements into longer sentences, and so to make smoother discourse.  Thus we may say, \"The last of all the Bards was he. These bards sang  of Border chivalry.\" Or, it may be shortened into,--         \"The last of all the Bards was he,       _Who_ sung of Border chivalry.\"    In the latter sentence, _who_ evidently refers to _Bards_, which is  called the antecedent of the relative.      [Sidenote: _The antecedent._]    105. The antecedent of a pronoun is the noun, pronoun, or other  word or expression, for which the pronoun stands. It usually precedes  the pronoun.    Personal pronouns of the third person may have antecedents also, as  they take the place usually of a word already used; as,--         The priest hath _his_ fee who comes and shrives us.--LOWELL    In this, both _his_ and _who_ have the antecedent _priest_.    The pronoun _which_ may have its antecedent following, and the  antecedent may be a word or a group of words, as will be shown in the  remarks on _which_ below.      [Sidenote: _Two kinds._]    106. Relatives may be SIMPLE or INDEFINITE.    When the word _relative_ is used, a simple relative is meant.  Indefinite relatives, and the indefinite use of simple relatives, will  be discussed further on.    The SIMPLE RELATIVES are _who_, _which_, _that_, _what_.      [Sidenote: Who _and its forms._]    107. Examples of the relative _who_ and its forms:--         1. Has a man gained anything _who_ has received a hundred favors       and rendered none?--EMERSON.         2. That man is little to be envied _whose_ patriotism would not       gain force upon the plain of Marathon.--DR JOHNSON.    3.      For her enchanting son,       _Whom_ universal nature did lament.--MILTON.         4. The nurse came to us, _who_ were sitting in an adjoining       apartment.--THACKERAY.    5. Ye mariners of England,        That guard our native seas;       _Whose_ flag has braved, a thousand years,        The battle and the breeze!--CAMPBELL.         6. The men _whom_ men respect, the women _whom_ women approve,       are the men and women _who_ bless their species.--PARTON      [Sidenote: Which _and its forms._]    108. Examples of the relative _which_ and its forms:--         1. They had not their own luster, but the look _which_ is not of       the earth.--BYRON.         2. The embattled portal arch he pass'd,           _Whose_ ponderous grate and massy bar           Had oft roll'd back the tide of war.--SCOTT.         3. Generally speaking, the dogs _which_ stray around the butcher       shops restrain their appetites.--COX.         4. The origin of language is divine, in the same sense in _which_       man's nature, with all its capabilities ..., is a divine       creation.--W.D. WHITNEY.         5. (_a_) This gradation ... ought to be kept in view; else this       description will seem exaggerated, _which_ it certainly is       not.--BURKE.         (_b_) The snow was three inches deep and still falling, _which_       prevented him from taking his usual ride.--IRVING.    [Sidenote: That.]    109. Examples of the relative _that_:--           1. The man _that_ hath no music in himself,...           Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.           --SHAKESPEARE         2. The judge ... bought up all the pigs _that_ could be       had.--LAMB         3. Nature and books belong to the eyes _that_ see them.--EMERSON.         4. For the sake of country a man is told to yield everything       _that_ makes the land honorable.--H.W. BEECHER         5. Reader, _that_ do not pretend to have leisure for very much       scholarship, you will not be angry with me for telling you.--DE       QUINCEY.         6. The Tree Igdrasil, _that_ has its roots down in the kingdoms       of Hela and Death, and whose boughs overspread the highest       heaven!--CARLYLE.    [Sidenote: What.]    110. Examples of the use of the relative _what_:--         1. Its net to entangle the enemy seems to be _what_ it chiefly       trusts to, and _what_ it takes most pains to render as complete       as possible.--GOLDSMITH.         2. For _what_ he sought below is passed above, Already done is       all that he would do.--MARGARET FULLER.         3. Some of our readers may have seen in India a crowd of crows       picking a sick vulture to death, no bad type of _what_ often       happens in that country.--MACAULAY    [_To the Teacher._--If pupils work over the above sentences carefully,  and test every remark in the following paragraphs, they will get a  much better understanding of the relatives.]        REMARKS ON THE RELATIVE PRONOUNS.    [Sidenote: Who.]    111. By reading carefully the sentences in Sec. 107, the following  facts will be noticed about the relative _who_:--    (1) It usually refers to persons: thus, in the first sentence, Sec.  107, _a man...who_; in the second, _that man...whose_; in the third,  _son_, _whom_; and so on.    (2) It has three case forms,--_who_, _whose_, _whom_.    (3) The forms do not change for person or number of the antecedent. In  sentence 4, _who_ is first person; in 5, _whose_ is second person; the  others are all third person. In 1, 2, and 3, the relatives are  singular; in 4, 5, and 6, they are plural.    [Sidenote: Who _referring to animals_.]    112. Though in most cases _who_ refers to persons there are  instances found where it refers to animals. It has been seen (Sec. 24)  that animals are referred to by personal pronouns when their  characteristics or habits are such as to render them important or  interesting to man. Probably on the same principle the personal  relative _who_ is used not infrequently in literature, referring to  animals.    Witness the following examples:--         And you, warm little housekeeper [the cricket], _who_ class With       those who think the candles come too soon.--LEIGH HUNT.         The robins...have succeeded in driving off the bluejays _who_       used to build in our pines.--LOWELL.         The little gorilla, _whose_ wound I had dressed, flung its arms       around my neck.--THACKERAY.         A lake frequented by every fowl _whom_ Nature has taught to dip       the wing in water.--DR. JOHNSON.         While we had such plenty of domestic insects _who_ infinitely       excelled the former, because they understood how to weave"]]]
