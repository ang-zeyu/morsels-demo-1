As Bonaparte was walking with Josephine and Hortense through the Diana  Gallery on the morning after their entry into the Tuileries, and was  with them admiring the statuary he had caused to be placed there, both  of the ladies possessing much artistic taste, he paused in front of the  statue of the younger Brutus, which stood close to the statue of Julius  Caesar. He gazed long and earnestly at both of the grave, solemn faces;  but, suddenly, as though just awaking from a deep dream, he sharply  raised his head, and, laying his hand with an abrupt movement upon  Josephine's shoulder, as he looked up at the statue of Brutus with  blazing, almost menacing glances, said in a voice that made the hearts  of both the ladies bound within their bosoms:    \"It is not enough to be in the Tuileries: one must remain there. And  whom has not this palace held? Even street thieves and conventionists  have occupied it! Did not I see with my own eyes how the savage Jacobins  and cohorts of _sans-culottes_ surrounded the palace and led away the  good King Louis XVI. as a prisoner! Ah! never mind, Josephine; have no  fear for the future! Let them but dare to come hither once more[9]!\"    [Footnote 9: Bourrienne, vol. vi, p. 3.]    And, as Bonaparte stood there and thus spoke in front of the statues of  Brutus and Julius Caesar, his voice re-echoed like angry thunder through  the long gallery, and made the figures of the heroes of the dead  republic tremble on their pedestals.    Bonaparte lifted his arm menacingly toward the statue of Brutus, as  though he would, in that fierce republican who slew Caesar, challenge  all republican France, whose Caesar and Augustus in one he aspired to  be, to mortal combat.    The revolution was closed. Bonaparte had installed himself in the  Tuileries with Josephine and her two children. The son and daughter of  General Beauharnais, whom the republic had murdered, had now found  another father, who was destined to avenge that murder on the  republic itself.    The revolution was over!        BOOK II.    _THE QUEEN OF HOLLAND_.    CHAPTER I.    A FIRST LOVE.    With the entry of Bonaparte into the Tuileries, the revolution closed,  and blissful days of tranquillity and gay festivity followed. Josephine  and Hortense were the cynosure of all these festivals, for they were,  likewise, the animating centre whence the grace and beauty, the  attractive charm, and the intellectual significance of them all,  proceeded.    Hortense was passionately fond of dancing, and no one at \"the court of  Josephine\" tripped it with such gracefulness and such enchanting  delicacy as she. Now, as the reader will observe, people already began  to speak of the \"court\" of Madame Bonaparte, the powerful wife of the  First Consul of France. Now, also, _audiences_ were held, and Josephine  and Hortense already had a court retinue who approached them with the  same subserviency and humility as though they had been princesses of  the blood.    Madame Bonaparte now rode with her daughter through the streets of  Paris in a richly-gilded coach, under a military escort, and wherever  the populace caught a glimpse of them they greeted the wife and daughter  of the first consul with applauding shouts.    Bonaparte's coachmen and servants had now a livery, and made their  appearance in green coats with gold embroidery and galloons. There were  chamberlains and lackeys, grooms and outriders; splendid dinners and  evening parties were given, and the ambassadors of foreign powers were  received in solemn audience; for, now, all the European states had  recognized the French Republic under the consulate, and, as Bonaparte  had concluded peace with England and Austria, these two great powers  also sent envoys to the court of the mighty consul.    Instead of warlike struggles, the Tuileries now witnessed contentions of  the toilet, and _powder or no powder_ was one of the great questions of  etiquette in which Josephine gave the casting vote when she said that  \"every one should dress as seemed best and most becoming to each, but  yet endeavor to let good taste pervade the selection.\"    For some time, meanwhile, Hortense had participated with less zest than  formerly in the amusements and parties of the day; for some time she had  seemed to prefer being alone more than in previous years, and held  herself aloof in the quiet retirement of her own apartments, where the  melancholy, tender, and touching melodies which she drew from her harp  in those lonely hours seemed to hold her better converse than all the  gay and flattering remarks that she was accustomed to hear in her  mother's grand saloons.    Hortense sought solitude, for to solitude alone could she confide what  was weighing on her heart; to it alone could she venture to confess that  she was in love, and with all the innocent energy, all the warmth and  absolute devotion of a first attachment. How blissful were those hours  of reverie, of expectant peering into the future, which seemed to  promise the rising of another sun of happiness to her beaming gaze! For  this young girl's passion had the secret approbation of her mother and  her step-father, and both of them smilingly pretended not to be, in the  least degree, aware of the tender understanding that subsisted between  Hortense and General Duroc, Bonaparte's chief adjutant; only that, while  Josephine took it to be the first tender fluttering of a young girl's  heart awaking to the world, Bonaparte ascribed a more serious meaning to  it, and bestowed earnest thought upon the idea of a union between  Hortense and his friend. He was anxious, above all other things, to give  Duroc a more important and imposing status, and therefore sent him as  ambassador to St. Petersburg, to convey to the Emperor Alexander, who  had just ascended his father's throne, the congratulations and good  wishes of the First Consul of France.    The poor young lovers, constantly watched as they were, and as  constantly restrained by the rules of an etiquette which was now  becoming more and more rigid, had not the consolation accorded to them  of exchanging even one last unnoticed pressure of the hand, one last  tender vow of eternal fidelity, when they took leave of each other. But  they hoped in the future, and looked forward to Duroc's return, and to  the precious recompense that Bonaparte had significantly promised to his  friend. That recompense was the hand of Hortense Until then, they had to  content themselves with that sole and sweetest solace of all parted  lovers, the letters that they interchanged, and which Bourrienne,  Bonaparte's secretary, faithfully and discreetly transmitted.    \"Nearly every evening,\" relates Bourrienne, in his Memoires, \"I played a  game of billiards with Mademoiselle Hortense, who was an adept at it.  When I said, in a low tone to her, 'I have a letter,' the game would  cease at once, and she would hasten to her room, whither I followed her,  and took the letter to her. Her eyes would instantly fill with tears of  emotion and delight, and it was only after a long lapse of time that she  would go down to the saloon whither I had preceded her[10].\"    [Footnote 10: Bourrienne, vol. iv., p. 319.]    Hortense, thus busied only with her young lover and her innocent dreams  of the future, troubled herself but little concerning what was taking  place around her, and did not perceive that others were ready to make  her young heart the plaything of domestic and political intrigue.    Bonaparte's brothers, who were jealous of the sway that the beautiful  and fascinating Josephine still exerted over the first consul, as in the  first days of their wedded life, were anxious, by separating Hortense  from her mother, to deprive Josephine of one of the strongest supports  of her influence, and thus, by isolating Josephine, bring themselves  nearer to their brother. They well knew the affection which Bonaparte,  who was particularly fond of children, entertained for those of his  wife, and they also knew that Eugene and Hortense had, one day, not by  their entreaties or their tears, but by their mere presence, prevented  Josephine and Bonaparte from separating.    This was at the time when the whisperings of his brothers and of Junot  had succeeded in making Bonaparte jealous on his return from Egypt.    At that time, Bonaparte had resolved to separate from a woman, against  whom, however, his anger was thus fiercely aroused, simply because he  was so strongly attached to her; and when Bourrienne implored him, at  least, to hear Josephine before condemning her, and to see whether she  could not clear herself, or he could not forgive her, he had replied:    \"I forgive her? Never! Were I not sure of myself this time, I would tear  my heart out and throw it into the fire!\" And, as Bonaparte spoke, his  voice trembling the while with rage, he clutched his breast with his  hand as though he would indeed rend it to pieces. This scene occurred in  the evening, but, when Bourrienne came into the office next morning,  Bonaparte stepped forward to meet him with a smile on his face, and a  little confused.    \"Now, Bourrienne,\" said he, \"you will be content--she is here! Don't  suppose that I have forgiven her--no not at all! No, I reproached her  vehemently, and sent her away. But, what would you have?--when she left  me, weeping, I went after her, and, as she descended the stairs with her  head drooping, I saw Eugene and Hortense, who went with her, sobbing  violently. I have not the heart to look unmoved on any one in tears.  Eugene had accompanied me to Egypt, and I have accustomed myself to  regard him as my adopted son; he is so gallant, so excellent a young  man.

In many of their crimes they are often  the accomplices of men and take rather a minor part, although sometimes  a quite important one. For this reason they are often not detected and  frequently not prosecuted, a fact which leaves the percentage smaller  than it otherwise would be. Then too, juries are apt to acquit women of  crime even when they are indicted and tried. It must be a positive case  and one which calls for no possible feeling of sympathy or where there  is no personal appeal that will work the conviction of a woman. Men have  so long adopted an attitude of chivalry toward women that very few  juries will convict them. This too has much to do with the small number  of female convicts.    Some writers claim that the small number of women in penal institutions  shows that women are better than men; but this is a hasty conclusion  arrived at from insufficient facts. There are fewer female prisoners  because women have lived a more protected life; they have not been  engaged so generally in business; they have not been so constantly  obliged to fight their way in the world; their lives have been more  quiet and smooth; they have been surrounded by strong conventions and  closely watched. Especially is this true with regard to the girl as  compared with the boy. Such protection naturally keeps them from the  commission of crime. The great consideration shown to them by  prosecuting witnesses, prosecuting officers, judges and juries,  supplements the protected life and is an added reason for the showing  made by statistics. It is notorious that a woman is seldom convicted of  murder. This has been the subject of much complaint on the part of the  public; still a man may condemn such acquittals and when placed on a  jury will himself vote for acquittal.    After all, the juries are right. Most of the cases of murder against  women involve sex relations. Nature has made the bearing and rearing of  children first of all the woman's part, and this fact so dominates her  life that nothing else seems important to her in comparison. She is not  able to judge in a broad and scientific way matters so clearly affecting  life. It may even be possible that in the evolution and preservation of  life, her judgments are right. At least they are the natural judgments  for a large number of women, or these tragedies would not occur. No  doubt as woman enters the field of industry formerly monopolized by man,  and as she takes her part in politics and sits on juries, the percentage  of female criminals will rapidly increase. In fact, the percentage of  women prisoners has been climbing for many years. As she takes her place  with men she will be more and more judged as men are judged, and will  commit the crimes that men commit, and perhaps furnish her fair quota to  the penitentiaries and jails.    Whether this will be better or worse for the race is no part of the  discussion, and can only be told by long experience. Women must accept  the facts and make their choice of activities in view of these facts.  Quite apart from any sentiment, I think that it is a mistake to believe  that men and women should be judged alike. The structure and nervous  system of women cause physical and mental disturbances which affect  their judgment and life. If there were any justice in human judgment and  civilization, then each human being would be judged according to his  make-up, his tendencies, his inclinations and his capacities, and no two  would be judged alike.    Any sudden change in the treatment of women in the courts will work a  great injustice that will leave its effect on both women and men, and  still more on the life of the race.          IX    JUVENILE CRIMINALS      This subject would scarcely have been noted a few years ago. True, there  was in the past a small mixture of children in the grist ground out in  the criminal courts. Usually they received some leniency, and were  viewed with more curiosity than alarm. The juvenile criminal was  regarded as a prodigy with a capacity for crimes far beyond his years.  Something of the attitude obtained in regard to him which attaches to  the child chess player or the child mathematician. The child criminal is  now common, and for the most part is a product of the city.    All crime is doubtless much more common in the city than the country,  and the young criminal especially is a product of the crowded community.  To those who look for natural causes for all phenomena the reason is not  far to seek. The city itself is an abnormal thing. Primitive man and his  ancestors were never huddled together in great multitudes, as are the  dwellers in cities today. To a degree almost all animals are gregarious,  but the units of organization are much smaller with them than with man,  excepting possibly in the case of the ant and the bee, insects which  seem specially adapted to live a highly automatic and cooperative life,  such as human beings cannot possibly reach. But primitive men and their  direct ancestors lived in small groups. They could not have preserved  their life in any other way. They lived by fishing and hunting and by  gathering roots, berries and herbs. Later they tended their flocks and  cultivated the fields in a simple way.    With the introduction of the modern machine, the factory system and the  railroads, in the last century, our great modern cities were evolved. As  they grew more complicated, new problems arose. The life of the crowded  city is most difficult even for normal men and women. The adjustments  are too numerous and too complex for an animal made with simple tastes  and for a pastoral life. But, if it is hard for men, it is almost  hopeless for children, especially the children of the poor who fill our  prisons, asylums and almshouses.    Every child needs the open air and the open life of the country. He  needs, first of all, exercise which should be in the form of outdoor  play. No healthy boy wants to live indoors, even though his home may be  a convenient city \"flat.\" The woods, the fields, the streams, the lakes,  the wide common with plenty of room, have always made their natural  appeal to the young. And as sunlight kills most of the deadly germs, so  outdoor life with exercise and play takes care of most of the unhealthy  thoughts, habits and ideas of child-life. In the past, our schools both  in the city and country have done little to help the young. For the most  part healthy children have always looked on them more or less as  prisons. Here they have been confined and kept from exercise and play,  to study useless and unrelated facts and to commit to memory dry rules  which are forgotten as soon as their minds are ready to retain anything  worth while.    Schools should be made to fit the needs of children, and not children to  fit schools. The school that does not provide work and play for the  child which he is glad to do, has learned little of the psychology and  needs of youth. Botany, Zooelogy, Geology and even Chemistry can be  taught to children before they learn to read, and taught so that it will  seem like play, and through this the pupil will acquire a natural taste  for books. It is only within the last few years that the modern school  has really begun to educate the child. It has been a hard fight that  scientific teachers have waged with conventional education for the right  of the child. What has been done is too recent and scattering to show  material results.    Nothing is so important to the child as education. The early life is the  time that character is formed, habits are made, rules of conduct  taught, and it is almost impossible to up-root old habits and  inhibitions and implant new ones in later years.    It is true that \"the child is father to the man,\" and he is the father  of the criminal as well as the useful citizen. Outside of the hopelessly  defective, or those who have very imperfect nervous or physical systems,  there is no reason why a child who has had proper mental and physical  training and any fair opportunity in life should ever be a criminal.  Even most of the mentally defective and those suffering from imperfect  nervous systems could be useful to society in a sheltered environment.  Poor as the country schools have always been, the outdoor life of the  country child is still so great an influence that he generally escapes  disaster. He is not sent to a factory, but lives in a small community  where he has fresh air and exercise.    Of course here as everywhere we must allow for the defective, the  imperfect, the subnormals and the children of the very poor. These  unfortunates furnish a large percentage of the inmates of prison, and  most of the victims for the scaffold which civilization so fondly  preserves.    The growth of the big cities has produced the child criminal. He is  clearly marked and well defined. He is often subnormal even down to  idiocy. In most cases he is the result of heredity. Many times he may  have fair intelligence, but this is usually attached to an unstable,  defective nervous system that cannot do its proper work, and he has had  no expert treatment and attention. He is always poor. Generally he has  lost one or both parents in youth and has lived in the crowded districts  where the home was congested. He has no adequate playground and he runs  the streets or vacant, waste places. He associates and combines with  others of his kind. He cannot or does not go to school. If he goes to  school, he dreads to go and cannot learn the lessons in the books. He  likes to loaf, just as all children like to play. He is often set to  work. He has no trade and little capacity for skilled work that brings  good wages and steady employment. He works no more than he needs to  work. Every night and all the days that he can get are spent in idleness  on the street with his \"gang"]]]
