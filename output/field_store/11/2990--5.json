Take the gravy in the dripping pan, add a little boiling  water, should there not be enough, stir in a tablespoonful of walnut  catsup, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, the juice of a lemon,  and thicken with brown flour, previously wet with cold water. Boil up  once and put in a sauce boat.      HALIBUT BROILED.    Broil the same as other fish, upon a buttered gridiron, over a clear  fire, first seasoning with salt and pepper, placed on a hot dish when  done, buttered well and covered closely.      FRIED BROOK TROUT.    These delicate fish are usually fried, and form a delightful breakfast  or supper dish. Clean, wash and dry the fish, split them to the tail,  salt and pepper them, and flour them nicely. If you use lard instead  of the fat of fried salt pork, put in a piece of butter to prevent  their sticking, and which causes them to brown nicely. Let the fat be  hot; fry quickly to a delicate brown. They should be sufficiently  browned on one side before turning on the other. They are nice served  with slices of fried pork, fried crisp. Lay them side by side on a  heated platter, garnish and send hot to the table. They are often  cooked and served with their heads on.      FRIED SMELTS.    Fried with their heads on the same as brook trout. Many think that  they make a much better appearance as a dish when cooked whole with  the heads on, and nicely garnished for the table.      BOILED WHITE FISH.    _Taken from Mrs. A. W. Ferry's Cook Book, Mackinac, 1824._    The most delicate mode of cooking white fish. Prepare the fish as for  broiling, laying it open; put it into a dripping pan with the back  down; nearly cover with water; to one fish two tablespoonfuls of salt;  cover tightly and simmer (not boil) one-half hour. Dress with gravy, a  little butter and pepper, and garnish with hard-boiled eggs.      BAKED WHITE FISH. (Bordeaux Sauce.)    Clean and stuff the fish. Put it in a baking pan and add a liberal  quantity of butter, previously rolled in flour, to the fish. Put in  the pan half a pint of claret, and bake for an hour and a quarter.  Remove the fish and strain the gravy; add to the latter a gill more of  claret, a teaspoonful of brown flour and a pinch of cayenne, and serve  with the fish.    _Plankington House, Milwaukee._      BAKED SALMON TROUT.    This deliciously flavored game-fish is baked precisely as shad or  white fish, but should be accompanied with cream gravy to make it  perfect. It should be baked slowly, basting often with butter and  water. When done have ready in a saucepan a cup of cream, diluted with  a few spoonfuls of hot water, for fear it might clot in heating, in  which have been stirred cautiously two tablespoonfuls of melted  butter, a scant tablespoonful of flour, and a little chopped parsley.  Heat this in a vessel set within another of boiling water, add the  gravy from the dripping-pan, boil up once to thicken, and when the  trout is laid on a suitable hot dish, pour this sauce around it.  Garnish with sprigs of parsley.    This same fish boiled, served with the same cream gravy (with the  exception of the fish gravy), is the proper way to cook it.      TO BAKE SMELTS.    Wash and dry them thoroughly in a cloth, and arrange them nicely in a  flat baking-dish; the pan should be buttered, also the fish; season  with salt and pepper, and cover with bread or cracker crumbs. Place a  piece of butter over each. Bake for fifteen or twenty minutes. Garnish  with fried parsley and cut lemon.      BROILED SPANISH MACKEREL.    Split the fish down the back, take out the backbone, wash it in cold  water, dry it with a clean, dry cloth, sprinkle it lightly with salt  and lay it on a buttered gridiron, over a clear fire, with the flesh  side downward, until it begins to brown; then turn the other side.  Have ready a mixture of two tablespoonfuls of butter melted, a  tablespoonful of lemon juice, a teaspoonful of salt, some pepper. Dish  up the fish hot from the gridiron on a hot dish, turn over the mixture  and serve it while hot.    Broiled Spanish mackerel is excellent with other fish sauces. Boiled  Spanish mackerel is also very fine with most of the fish sauces, more  especially \"Matre d'Hotel Sauce.\"      BOILED SALT MACKEREL.    Wash and clean off all the brine and salt; put it to soak with the  meat side down, in cold water over night; in the morning rinse it in  one or two waters. Wrap each up in a cloth and put it into a kettle  with considerable water, which should be cold; cook about thirty  minutes. Take it carefully from the cloth, take out the backbones and  pour over a little melted butter and cream; add a light sprinkle of  pepper. Or make a cream sauce like the following:    Heat a small cup of milk to scalding. Stir into it a teaspoonful of  cornstarch wet up with a little water. When this thickens, add two  tablespoonfuls of butter, pepper, salt and chopped parsley, to taste.  Beat an egg light, pour the sauce gradually over it, put the mixture  again over the fire, and stir one minute, not more. Pour upon the  fish, and serve it with some slices of lemon, or a few sprigs of  parsley or water-cress, on the dish as a garnish.      BAKED SALT MACKEREL.    When the mackerel have soaked over night, put them in a pan and pour  on boiling water enough to cover. Let them stand a couple of minutes,  then drain them off, and put them in the pan with a few lumps of  butter; pour on a half teacupful of sweet cream, or rich milk, and a  little pepper; set in the oven and let it bake a little until brown.      FRIED SALT MACKEREL.    Select as many salt mackerel as required; wash and cleanse them well,  then put them to soak all day in _cold_ water, changing them every two  hours; then put them into fresh water just before retiring. In the  morning drain off the water, wipe them dry, roll them in flour, and  fry in a little butter on a hot, thick-bottomed frying pan. Serve with  a little melted butter poured over, and garnish with a little parsley.      BOILED FRESH MACKEREL.    Fresh mackerel are cooked in water salted, and a little vinegar added;  with this exception they can be served in the same way as the salt  mackerel. Broiled ones are very nice with the same cream sauce, or you  can substitute egg sauce.      POTTED FRESH FISH.    After the fish has laid in salt water six hours, take it out, and to  every six pounds of fish take one-quarter cupful each of salt, black  pepper and cinnamon, one-eighth cupful of allspice, and one  teaspoonful of cloves.    Cut the fish in pieces and put into a half gallon stone baking-jar,  first a layer of fish, then the spices, flour, and then spread a thin  layer of butter on, and continue so until the dish is full. Fill the  jar with equal parts of vinegar and water, cover with tightly fitting  lid, so that the steam cannot escape; bake five hours, remove from the  oven, and when it is cold it is to be cut in slices and served. This  is a tea or lunch dish.      SCALLOPED CRABS.    Put the crabs into a kettle of boiling water, and throw in a handful  of salt. Boil from twenty minutes to half an hour. Take them from the  water when done and pick out all the meat; be careful not to break the  shell. To a pint of meat put a little salt and pepper; taste, and if  not enough add more, a little at a time, till suited. Grate in a very  little nutmeg and add one spoonful of cracker or bread crumbs, two  eggs well beaten, and two tablespoonfuls of butter (even full); stir  all well together; wash the shells clean, and fill each shell full of  the mixture; sprinkle crumbs over the top and moisten with the liquor;  set in the oven till of a nice brown; a few minutes will do it. Send  to the table hot, arranged on large dishes. They are eaten at  breakfast or supper.      FISH IN WHITE SAUCE.    Flake up cold boiled halibut and set the plate into the steamer, that  the fish may heat without drying. Boil the bones and skin of the fish  with a slice of onion and a _very_ small piece of red pepper; a bit of  this the size of a kernel of coffee will make the sauce quite as hot  as most persons like it. Boil this stock down to half a pint; thicken  with one teaspoonful of butter and one teaspoonful of flour, mixed  together. Add one drop of extract of almond. Pour this sauce over your  halibut and stick bits of parsley over it.      FRESH STURGEON STEAK MARINADE.    Take one slice of sturgeon two inches thick; let it stand in hot water  five minutes; drain, put it in a bowl and add a gill of vinegar, two  tablespoonfuls of melted butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, a  saltspoonful of black pepper and the juice of half a lemon; let it  stand six hours, turning it occasionally; drain and dry on a napkin;  dip it in egg; roll in bread crumbs and fry, or rather boil, in very  hot fat. Beat up the yolks of two raw eggs, add a teaspoonful of  French mustard, and by degrees, half of the marinade, to make a smooth  sauce, which serve with the fish.      POTTED FISH.    Take out the backbone of the fish; for one weighing two pounds take a  tablespoonful of allspice and cloves mixed; these spices should be put  into little bags of not too thick muslin; put sufficient salt directly  upon each fish; then roll in cloth, over which sprinkle a little  cayenne pepper; put alternate layers of fish, spice and sage in an  earthen jar; cover with the best cider vinegar; cover the jar closely  with a plate, and over this, put a covering of dough, rolled out to  twice the thickness of pie crust. Make the edges of paste, to adhere  closely to the sides of the jar, so as to make it air tight. Put the  jar into a pot of cold water and let it boil from three to five hours,  according to quantity. Ready when cold.      MAYONNAISE FISH.    Take a pound or so of cold boiled fish (halibut, rock or cod), not  chop, but cut, into pieces an inch in length.

Although this country  was sparsely settled, yet there were men always riding from camp to camp  or from one valley town to another. Wade never tarried on a  well-trodden trail.    As he climbed higher the spruce-trees grew smaller, no longer forming a  green aisle before him, and at length they became dwarfed and stunted,  and at last failed altogether. Soon he was above timber-line and out  upon a flat-topped mountain range, where in both directions the land  rolled and dipped, free of tree or shrub, colorful with grass and  flowers. The elevation exceeded eleven thousand feet. A whipping wind  swept across the plain-land. The sun was pale-bright in the east, slowly  being obscured by gray clouds. Snow began to fall, first in scudding,  scanty flakes, but increasing until the air was full of a great, fleecy  swirl. Wade rode along the rim of a mountain wall, watching a beautiful  snow-storm falling into the brown gulf beneath him. Once as he headed  round a break he caught sight of mountain-sheep cuddled under a  protecting shelf. The snow-squall blew away, like a receding wall,  leaving grass and flowers wet. As the dark clouds parted, the sun shone  warmer out of the blue. Gray peaks, with patches of white, stood up  above their black-timbered slopes.    Wade soon crossed the flat-topped pass over the range and faced a  descent, rocky and bare at first, but yielding gradually to the  encroachment of green. He left the cold winds and bleak trails above  him. In an hour, when he was half down the slope, the forest had become  warm and dry, fragrant and still. At length he rode out upon the brow of  a last wooded bench above a grassy valley, where a bright, winding  stream gleamed in the sun. While the horses rested Wade looked about  him. Nature never tired him. If he had any peace it emanated from the  silent places, the solemn hills, the flowers and animals of the wild and  lonely land.    A few straggling pines shaded this last low hill above the valley. Grass  grew luxuriantly there in the open, but not under the trees, where the  brown needle-mats jealously obstructed the green. Clusters of columbines  waved their graceful, sweet, pale-blue flowers that Wade felt a joy in  seeing. He loved flowers--columbines, the glory of Colorado, came first,  and next the many-hued purple asters, and then the flaunting spikes of  paint-brush, and after them the nameless and numberless wild flowers  that decked the mountain meadows and colored the grass of the aspen  groves and peeped out of the edge of snow fields.    \"Strange how it seems good to live--when I look at a columbine--or watch  a beaver at his work--or listen to the bugle of an elk!\" mused Bent  Wade. He wondered why, with all his life behind him, he could still find  comfort in these things.    Then he rode on his way. The grassy valley, with its winding stream,  slowly descended and widened, and left foothill and mountain far behind.  Far across a wide plain rose another range, black and bold against the  blue. In the afternoon Wade reached Elgeria, a small hamlet, but  important by reason of its being on the main stage line, and because  here miners and cattlemen bought supplies. It had one street, so wide it  appeared to be a square, on which faced a line of bold board houses with  high, flat fronts. Wade rode to the inn where the stagecoaches made  headquarters. It suited him to feed and rest his horses there, and  partake of a meal himself, before resuming his journey.    The proprietor was a stout, pleasant-faced little woman, loquacious and  amiable, glad to see a stranger for his own sake rather than from  considerations of possible profit. Though Wade had never before visited  Elgeria, he soon knew all about the town, and the miners up in the  hills, and the only happenings of moment--the arrival and departure  of stages.    \"Prosperous place,\" remarked Wade. \"I saw that. An' it ought to be  growin'.\"    \"Not so prosperous fer me as it uster be,\" replied the lady. \"We did  well when my husband was alive, before our competitor come to town. He  runs a hotel where miners can drink an' gamble. I don't.... But I reckon  I've no cause to complain. I live.\"    \"Who runs the other hotel?\"    \"Man named Smith. Reckon thet's not his real name. I've had people here  who--but it ain't no matter.\"    \"Men change their names,\" replied Wade.    \"Stranger, air you packin' through or goin' to stay?\"    \"On my way to White Slides Ranch, where I'm goin' to work for  Belllounds. Do you know him?\"    \"Know Belllounds? Me? Wal, he's the best friend I ever had when I was at  Kremmlin'. I lived there several years. My husband had stock there. In  fact, Bill started us in the cattle business. But we got out of there  an' come here, where Bob died, an' I've been stuck ever since.\"    \"Everybody has a good word for Belllounds,\" observed Wade.    \"You'll never hear a bad one,\" replied the woman, with cheerful warmth.  \"Bill never had but one fault, an' people loved him fer thet.\"    \"What was it?\"    \"He's got a wild boy thet he thinks the sun rises an' sets in. Buster  Jack, they call him. He used to come here often. But Bill sent him away  somewhere. The boy was spoiled. I saw his mother years ago--she's dead  this long time--an' she was no wife fer Bill Belllounds. Jack took after  her. An' Bill was thet woman's slave. When she died all his big heart  went to the son, an' thet accounts. Jack will never be any good.\"    Wade thoughtfully nodded his head, as if he understood, and was  pondering other possibilities.    \"Is he the only child?\"    \"There's a girl, but she's not Bill's kin. He adopted her when she was a  baby. An' Jack's mother hated this child--jealous, we used to think,  because it might grow up an' get some of Bill's money.'    \"What's the girl's name?\" asked Wade.    \"Columbine. She was over here last summer with Old Bill. They stayed  with me. It was then Bill had hard words with Smith across the street.  Bill was resentin' somethin' Smith put in my way. Wal, the lass's the  prettiest I ever seen in Colorado, an' as good as she's pretty. Old Bill  hinted to me he'd likely make a match between her an' his son Jack. An'  I ups an' told him, if Jack hadn't turned over a new leaf when he comes  home, thet such a marriage would be tough on Columbine. Whew, but Old  Bill was mad. He jest can't stand a word ag'in' thet Buster Jack.\"    \"Columbine Belllounds,\" mused Wade. \"Queer name.\"    \"Oh, I've knowed three girls named Columbine. Don't you know the flower?  It's common in these parts. Very delicate, like a sago lily,  only paler.\"    \"Were you livin' in Kremmlin' when Belllounds adopted the girl?\" asked  Wade.    \"Laws no!\" was the reply. \"Thet was long before I come to Middle Park.  But I heerd all about it. The baby was found by gold-diggers up in the  mountains. Must have got lost from a wagon-train thet Indians set on  soon after--so the miners said. Anyway, Old Bill took the baby an'  raised her as his own.\"    \"How old is she now?\" queried Wade, with a singular change in his tone.    \"Columbine's around nineteen.\"    Bent Wade lowered his head a little, hiding his features under the old,  battered, wide-brimmed hat. The amiable innkeeper did not see the tremor  that passed over him, nor the slight stiffening that followed, nor the  gray pallor of his face. She went on talking until some one called her.    Wade went outdoors, and with bent head walked down the street, across a  little river, out into green pasture-land. He struggled with an amazing  possibility. Columbine Belllounds might be his own daughter. His heart  leaped with joy. But the joy was short-lived. No such hope in this world  for Bent Wade! This coincidence, however, left him with a strange,  prophetic sense in his soul of a tragedy coming to White Slides Ranch.  Wade possessed some power of divination, some strange gift to pierce the  veil of the future. But he could not exercise this power at will; it  came involuntarily, like a messenger of trouble in the dark night.  Moreover, he had never yet been able to draw away from the fascination  of this knowledge. It lured him on. Always his decision had been to go  on, to meet this boding circumstance, or to remain and meet it, in the  hope that he might take some one's burden upon his shoulders. He sensed  it now, in the keen, poignant clairvoyance of the moment--the tangle of  life that he was about to enter. Old Bill Belllounds, big and fine,  victim of love for a wayward son; Buster Jack, the waster, the  tearer-down, the destroyer, the wild youth at a wild time; Columbine,  the girl of unknown birth, good and loyal, subject to a condition sure  to ruin her. Wade's strange mind revolved a hundred outcomes to this  conflict of characters, but not one of them was the one that was  written. That remained dark. Never had he received so strong a call out  of the unknown, nor had he ever felt such intense curiosity. Hope had  long been dead in him, except the one that he might atone in some way  for the wrong he had done his wife. So the pangs of emotion that  recurred, in spite of reason and bitterness, were not recognized by him  as lingering hopes. Wade denied the human in him, but he thrilled at the  thought of meeting Columbine Belllounds. There was something here beyond  all his comprehension.    \"It _might_--be true!\" he whispered. \"I'll know when I see her.\"    Then he walked back toward the inn. On the way he looked into the  barroom of the hotel run by Smith. It was a hard-looking place, half  full of idle men, whose faces were as open pages to Bent Wade. Curiosity  did not wholly control the impulse that made him wait at the door till  he could have a look at the man Smith. Somewhere, at some time, Wade had  met most of the veterans of western Colorado. So much he had traveled!  But the impulse that held him was answered and explained when Smith came  in--a burly man, with an ugly scar marring one eye. Bent"]]]
