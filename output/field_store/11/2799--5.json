I guess I've had enough of this  Deep Forest Throng business. No more for mine.\"    \"Aw, don't be afraid,\" urged Cecil. \"The next time we get him we'll be  on our guard.\"    \"You'll never catch Tom Swift again,\" predicted Pete.    \"I'll go back now to where he is, if you will,\" agreed Cecil, who was  older than the others.    \"Not much!\" cried Pete. \"I've had enough.\"    This seemed to be the sentiment of all. Away they stumbled through the  woods, and, emerging on the road, scattered to their several homes, not  one but who suffered from slight burns, contusions, torn and muddy  clothes or injured feelings as the outcome of the \"joke\" on the young  inventor.    But our hero was not yet free from the bonds of his enemies.  When they  scattered and ran, after the vivid blue light, and the dull explosion,  which, being unconfined, did no real damage, Tom was still fast to the  tree. As his eyes became accustomed to the semi-darkness that followed  the glare, he remarked:    \"Well, I don't know that I'm much better off. I gave those fellows a  good scare, but I'm not loose. But I can work to better advantage now.\"    Once more he resumed the effort to free himself, but in spite of the  crude manner in which the knots had been made, the lad could not get  loose. The more he pulled and tugged the tighter they seemed to become.    \"This is getting serious,\" Tom mused. \"If I could only reach my knife I  could cut them, but it's in my pocket on the other side, and that  bond's fast. Guess I'll have to stay here all night.  Maybe I'd better  call for help, but--\"    His words, spoken half aloud, were suddenly interrupted by a crash in  the underbrush. Somebody was approaching. At first Tom thought it was  Andy and his cronies coming back, but a voice that called a moment  later proved that this was not so.    \"Is any one here?\" shouted a man. \"Any one hurt? What was that fire and  explosion?\"    \"I'm here,\" replied Tom. \"I'm not hurt exactly, but I'm tied to a tree.  I'll be much obliged if you'll loosen me.\"    \"Who are you?\"    \"Tom Swift. Is that you, Mr. Mason?\"    \"Yes. By jinks! I never expected to find you here, Tom. Over this way,  men,\" he added calling aloud. \"I've found him; it's Tom Swift.\"    There was the flicker of several lanterns amid the trees, and soon a  number of men had joined Mr. Mason, and surrounded Tom.  They were  farmers living in the neighborhood.    \"What in the name o' Tunket happened?\" asked one. \"Did you get hit by a  meteor or a comet? Who tied you up; highwaymen?\"    \"Cut him loose first, and ask questions afterward,\" suggested Mr. Mason.    \"Yes,\" added Tom, with a laugh, \"I wish you would. I'm beginning to  feel cramped.\"    With their knives, the farmers quickly cut the ropes, and some of them  rubbed the arms of the lad to restore the circulation.    \"What was it--highwaymen?\" asked a man, unable to longer restrain his  curiosity. \"Did they rob you?\"    \"No, it wasn't highwaymen,\" replied the youth. \"It was a trick of some  boys I know,\" and to Tom's credit be it said that he did not mention  their names. \"They did it for a joke,\" he added.    \"Boys' trick? Joke?\" queried Mr. Mason. \"Pretty queer sort of a joke, I  think. They ought to be arrested.\"    \"Oh, I fancy I gave them what was coming to them,\" went on the young  inventor.    \"Did they try to blow ye up, too?\" asked Mr. Hertford. \"What in th'  name of Tunket was that blue light, and that explosion? I heard it an'  saw it way over to my house.\"    \"So did I,\" remarked Mr. Mason, and several others said the same thing.  \"We thought a meteor had fallen,\" he continued, \"and we got together to  make an investigation.\"    \"It's a good thing for me you did,\" admitted Tom, \"or I might have had  to stay here all night.\"    \"But was it a meteor?\" insisted Mr. Hertford.    \"No,\" replied the lad, \"I did it.\"    \"You?\"    \"Yes. You see after they tied me I found I could get one hand free. I  reached in my pocket for my knife, but instead of it I managed to get  hold of a package of powder I had.\"    \"Gunpowder?\" asked Mr. Mason.    \"No, a chemical powder I use in an electrical battery. The powder  explodes in fire, and makes quite a blue flash, and a lot of smoke, but  it isn't very dangerous, otherwise I wouldn't have used it. When the  boys were some distance away from the fire, I threw the powder in the  blaze. It went off in a moment, and--\"    \"I guess they run some; didn't they?\" asked Mr. Mason with a laugh.    \"They certainly did,\" agreed Tom.          CHAPTER X    TOM HAS A FALL      The young inventor told more details of his adventure in the woods,  but, though the farmers questioned him closely, he would not give a  single name of his assailants.    \"But I should think you'd want to have them punished,\" remarked Mr.  Mason.    \"I'll attend to that part later,\" answered Tom. \"Besides, most of them  didn't know what they were doing. They were led on by one or two. No,  I'll fight my own battles. But I wish you'd lend me a lantern long  enough to find my motor-cycle. The moon doesn't give much light in the  woods, and those fellows may have hidden my machine.\"    Mr. Mason and his companions readily agreed to accompany Tom on a  search for his wheel. It was found just where he had dismounted from it  in the road. Andy and his cronies had evidently had enough of their  encounter with our hero, and did not dare to annoy him further.    \"Do you think you can ride home?\" asked one of the farmers of the lad,  when he had ascertained that his machine was in running order.    \"Well, it's risky without my lantern,\" answered Tom. \"They smashed that  for me. But I guess I can manage.\"    \"No, you can't!\" insisted Mr. Mason. \"You're stiff from being tied up;  and you can't ride. Now you just wheel that contraption over to my  place, and I'll hitch up and take you home. It isn't far.\"    \"Oh, I couldn't think of troubling you,\" declared Tom. At the same time  he felt that he was in no condition to ride.    \"It's no trouble at all,\" insisted Mr. Mason. \"I guess your father and  I are good enough friends to allow me to have my way.  You can come  over and get your choo-choo bicycle in the morning.\"    A little later Tom was being rapidly driven toward his home, where he  found his father and Mrs. Baggert, to say nothing of Mr. Sharp,  somewhat alarmed over his absence, as it was getting late.  The youth  told as much of his adventure as he thought would not alarm his father,  making a sort of joke of it, and, later, related all the details to the  balloonist.    \"We'll have to get after Andy again,\" declared the aeronaut.  \"He needs  another toning down.\"    \"Yes, similar to the one he got when we nearly ran away with his  automobile, by catching the airship anchor on it,\" added Tom with a  laugh. \"But I fancy Andy will steer clear of me for a while. I'm sorry  I had to use up that chemical powder, though.  Now I can't start my  battery until to-morrow.\" But the next day Tom made up for lost time,  by working from early until late. He went over to Mr. Mason's, got his  motor-cycle, procured some more of the chemical, and soon had his  storage battery in running order. Then he arranged for a more severe  test, and while that was going on he worked at completing the body of  the electric runabout. The vehicle was beginning to look like a car,  though it was not of the regulation pattern.    For the next week Tom was very busy, so occupied, in fact, that he  scarcely took time for his meals, which caused Mrs. Baggert no little  worriment, for she was a housekeeper who liked to see others enjoy her  cooking.    \"Well, Tom, how are you coming on?\" asked his father one night, as they  sat on the porch, Mr. Sharp with them.    \"Pretty well, Dad,\" was the answer of the young inventor. \"I'll put the  wheels on to-morrow, and then set the batteries. I've got the motor all  finished; and all I'll have to do will be to connect it up, and then  I'll be ready for a trial on the road.\"    \"And you still think you'll beat all records?\"    \"I'm pretty sure of it, Dad. You see the amperage will be exceptionally  high, and my batteries will have a large amount of reserve, with little  internal resistance. But do you know I'm so tired I can hardly think.  It's more of a job than I thought it would be.\"    Tom, a little later, strolled down the road. As he turned back toward  the house and walked up the shrubbery lined path he heard a noise.    \"Some one's hiding in there!\" thought the lad, and he darted to an  opening in the hedge to reach the other side. As he did so he saw a  figure running away. Whether it was a man or a boy he could not tell in  the darkness.    \"Hold on there!\" cried the young inventor, but, naturally, the fleeing  one did not stop. Tom began to sprint, and as it was slightly down  hill, he made good time. The figure ahead of him was running well, too,  but Tom who could see better, now that he was out from under the trees,  noticed that he was gaining. The fleeing one came to a little brook,  and hesitated a moment before leaping across. This enabled Tom to catch  up, and he made a grab for the figure, just as the man or boy sprang  across the little stream.    Tom missed his grip, but he was not going to give up. He scarcely  slackened his speed, but, with the momentum he had acquired in racing  down the hill, he, too, leaped across the brook. As he landed on the  other side he made another grab for the figure, a man, as Tom could now  see, but he could make out no features, as the person's hat was pulled  down over his face.    \"I've got you now!\" cried Tom exultantly, reaching out his hand. His  fingers clutched something, but the next instant the young inventor  went sprawling. The other had put out his foot, and tripped him neatly  and, Tom throwing out his hands to save himself in the fall that was  inevitable, went splashing into the brook at full length. The unknown,  pausing a moment to view "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/953"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Big Tunnel; Or, The Hidden City of the Andes (#10)"],[1,"storm blew itself out. The Bellaconda \"crossed the line,\" and there  was the usual horseplay among the sailors when Father Neptune came  aboard to hold court. Those who had never before been below the equator  were made to undergo more or less of an initiation, being lathered and  shaved, and then pushed backward into a canvas tank of water on deck.    While Tom enjoyed the voyage, with the possible exception of the storm,  he was anxious, and so was Mr. Titus, for the time to come when they  should get to the tunnel and try the effect of the new explosive. Mr.  Damon found an elderly gentleman as fond of playing chess as was the  eccentric man himself, and his days were fully occupied with castles,  pawns, knights, kings, queens and so on. As for Koku he was taken in  charge by the sailors and found life forward very agreeable.    Senor Pinto had recovered from his seasickness, the steward told Tom  and Mr. Titus, but still he kept to his stateroom.    It was when the Bellaconda was within a day or two of Callao that a  wireless message was received for Mr. Titus.  It was from his brother.  The message read:      \"Have information from New York office that rivals are after you. Look  out for explosive.\"      \"What does that mean?\" asked Tom.    \"Well, I presume it means our rival contractors know we have a supply  of your new powder on board, and they may try to get it away from us.\"    \"Why?\" Tom demanded.    \"To prevent our using it to complete the tunnel. In that case they'll  get the secret of it to use for themselves, when the contract goes to  them by default. Can we do anything to protect the powder, Tom?\"    \"Well, I don't know that we'll need to while it's stowed away in the  cargo. They can't get at it any more than we can, until the ship  unloads. I guess it's safe enough. We'll just have to keep our eyes  open when it's taken out of the hold, though.\"    Tom and Mr. Titus, both of whom were fond of fresh air and exercise,  had made it a practice to get up an hour before breakfast and take a  constitutional about the steamer deck.  They did this as usual the  morning after the wireless warning was received, and they were standing  near the port rail, talking about this, when they heard a thud on the  deck behind them. Both turned quickly, and saw a round black object  rolling toward them. From the object projected what seemed to be a  black cord, and the end of this cord was glowing and smoking.    For a moment neither Tom nor Mr. Titus spoke. Then, as a slow motion of  the ship rolled the round black thing toward Tom, he cried:    \"It a bomb!\"    He darted toward it, but Mr. Titus pulled him back.    \"Run!\" yelled the contractor.    Before either of them could do anything, a queer figure of an elderly  gentleman stepped partly from behind a deck-house, and stooped over the  smoking object.    \"Look out!\" yelled Mr. Titus, crouching low. \"That's an explosive bomb!  Toss it overboard!\"          Chapter X    Professor Bumper      Fairly fascinated by the spluttering fuse, neither Tom nor Mr. Titus  moved for a second, while the deadly fire crept on through the black  string-like affair, nearer and nearer to the bomb itself.    Then, just as Tom, holding back his natural fear, was about to thrust  the thing overboard with his foot, hardly realizing that it might be  even more deadly to the ship in the water than it was on the deck, the  foot of the newcomer was suddenly thrust out from behind the  deck-house, and the sizzling fuse was trodden upon.    It went out in a puff of smoke, but the owner of the foot was not  satisfied with that for a hand reached down, lifted the bomb, the fuse  of which still showed a smouldering spark of fire, and calmly pulled  out the \"tail\" of the explosive.  It was harmless then, for the fuse,  with a trail of smoke following, was tossed into the sea, and the  little man came out from behind the deck-house, holding the unexploded  bomb.    For a moment neither Tom nor Mr. Titus could speak. They felt an  inexpressible sense of relief. Then Tom managed to gasp out:    \"You--you saved our lives!\"    The little man who had stepped on the fuse, and had then torn it from  the bomb, looked at the object in his hand as though it were the most  natural thing in the world to pick explosives up off the deck of  passenger steamers, as he remarked:    \"Well, perhaps I did. Yes, I think it would have gone off in another  second or two. Rather curious; isn't it?\"    \"Curious? Curious!\" asked and exclaimed Mr. Titus.    \"Why, yes,\" went on the little man, in the most matter of fact tone.  \"You see, most explosive bombs are round, made that way so the force  will be equal in all directions. But this one, you notice, has a bulge,  or protuberance, on one side, so to speak. Very curious!    \"It might have been made that way to prevent its rolling overboard, or  the bomb's walls might be weaker near that bulge to make sure that the  force of the explosion would be in that direction. And the bulge was  pointed toward you gentlemen, if you noticed.\"    \"I should say I did!\" cried Mr. Titus. \"My dear sir, you have put us  under a heavy debt to you! You saved our lives!  I--I am in no frame of  mind to thank you now, but--\"    He strode over to the little man, holding out his hand.    \"No, no, I'd better keep it,\" went on the person who had rendered the  bomb ineffective. \"You might drop it you know.  You are nervous--your  hand shakes.\"    \"I want to shake hands with you!\" exclaimed Mr. Titus--\"to thank you!\"    \"Oh, that's it. I thought you wanted the bomb. Shake hands? Certainly!\"    And while this ceremony was being gone through with, Tom had a moment  to study the appearance of the man who had saved their lives. He had  seen the passenger once or twice before, but had taken no special  notice of him. Now he had good reason to observe him.    Tom beheld a little, thin man, little in the sense of being of the  \"bean pole\" construction. His head was as bald as a billiard ball, as  the young inventor could notice when the stranger took off his hat to  bow formally in response to the greeting of some ladies who passed,  while Mr. Titus was shaking hands with him.    The bald head was sunk down between two high shoulders, and when the  owner wished to observe anything closely, as he was now observing the  bomb, the head was thrust forward somewhat as an eagle might do. And  Tom noticed that the eyes of the little man were as bright as those of  an eagle.  Nothing seemed to escape them.    \"I want to add my thanks to those of Mr. Titus for saving our lives,\"  said Tom, as he advanced. \"We don't know what to make of it all, but  you certainly stopped that bomb from going off.\"    \"Yes, perhaps I did,\" admitted the little man coolly and calmly, as  though preventing bomb explosions was his daily exercise before  breakfast.    Tom and Mr. Titus introduced themselves by name.    \"I am Professor Swyington Bumper,\" said the bomb-holder, with a bow,  removing his hat, and again disclosing his shiny bald head. \"I am very  glad to have met you indeed.\"    \"And we are more than glad,\" said Tom, fervently, as he glanced at the  explosive.    \"Now that the danger is over,\" went on Mr. Titus, \"suppose we make an  investigation, and find out how this bomb came to be here.\"    \"Just what I was about to suggest,\" remarked Professor Bumper. \"Bombs,  such as this, do not sprout of themselves on bare decks. And I take it  this one is explosive.\"    \"Let me look at it,\" suggested Tom. \"I know something of explosives.\"    It needed but a casual examination on the part of one who had done  considerable experimenting with explosives to disclose the fact that it  had every characteristic of a dangerous bomb. Only the pulling out of  the fuse had rendered it harmless.    \"If it had gone off,\" said Tom, \"we would both have been killed, or, at  least, badly injured, Mr. Titus.\"    \"I believe you, Tom. And we owe our lives to Professor Bumper.\"    \"I'm glad I could be of service, gentlemen,\" the scientist remarked, in  an easy tone. \"Explosives are out of my line, but I guessed it was  rather dangerous to let this go off.  Have you any idea how it got  here?\"    \"Not in the least,\" said Tom. \"But some one must have placed it here,  or dropped it behind us.\"    \"Would any one have an object in doing such a thing?\" the professor  asked.    Tom and Mr. Titus looked at one another.    \"Waddington!\" murmured the contractor. \"If he were on board I should  say he might have done it to get us out of the way, though I would not  go so far as to say he meant to kill us. It may be this bomb has only a  light charge in it, and he only meant to cripple us.\"    \"We'll find out about that,\" said Tom. \"I'll open it.\"    \"Better be careful,\" urged Mr. Titus.    \"I will,\" the young inventor promised. \"I beg your pardon,\" he went on  to Professor Bumper. \"We have been talking about something of which you  know nothing. Briefly, there is a certain man who is trying to  interfere in some work in which Mr. Titus and I are interested, and we  think, if he were on board, he might have placed this bomb where it  would injure us.\"    \"Is he here?\" asked the professor.    \"No. And that is what makes it all the more strange,\" said Mr. Titus.  \"At one time I thought he was here, but I was mistaken.\"    Tom took the now harmless bomb to his stateroom, and there, after  taking the infernal machine apart, he discovered that it was not as  dangerous as he had at first believed.    The bomb contained no missiles, and though it held a quantity of  explosive, it was of a slow burning kind. Had it gone off it would have  sent out a sheet of flame that would have severely burned him and Mr.  Titus, but unless complications had set in death would not have  resulted.    \"They just wanted to disable us,\" said the contractor.  \"That was their  game. Tom, who did it?\"    \"I don't know. Did you ever see this Professor Bumper before?\"    \"I never did.\"    \"And"]]]
