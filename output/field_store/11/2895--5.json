That cause which bringeth on  victory, may bring defeat as well. I live in this hope. Why dost thou  not, O Bhimasena, regard me as one dead? I have heard that persons that  give may beg: that they who slay may be slain; and that they who  over-throw others may themselves be overthrown by foes. Nothing is  difficult for Destiny and none can over-ride Destiny. It is for this  that I am awaiting the return of favourable fortune. As a tank once  dried, is filled up once again, so hoping for a change for the better, I  await the return of prosperity. When one's business that hath been  well-provided for is seen to be frustrated, a truly wise person should  never strive for bringing back good fortune. Plunged as I am an sorrow,  asked or unasked by thee to explain the purpose of these words spoken by  me, I shall tell thee everything. Queen of the sons of Pandu and  daughter of Drupada, who else, save myself, would wish to live, having  fallen into such a plight? O represser of foes, the misery, therefore,  that hath overtaken me, hath really humiliated the entire _Kuru_ race,  the Panchalas, and the sons of Pandu. Surrounded by numerous brothers  and father-in-law and sons, what other woman having such cause for joy,  save myself, would be afflicted with such woe? Surely, I must, in my  childhood, have committed act highly offensive to _Dhatri_ through whose  displeasure, O bull of the Bharata race, I have been visited with such  consequences. Mark, O son of Pandu, the pallour that hath come over my  complexion which not even a life in the woods fraught as it was with  extreme misery, could bring about. Thou, O Pritha's son, knowest what  happiness, O Bhima, was formerly mine. Even I, who was such have now  sunk into servitude. Sorely distressed, I can find no rest. That the  mighty-armed and terrible bowman, Dhananjaya the son of Pritha, should  now live like a fire that hath been put out, maketh me think of all this  as attributable to Destiny. Surely, O son of Pritha, it is impossible  for men to understand the destinies of creatures (in this world). I,  therefore, think this downfall of yours as something that could not be  averted by forethought. Alas, she who hath you all, that resemble Indra  himself to attend to her comforts--even she, so chaste and exalted, hath  now to attend to the comforts of others, that are to her far inferior in  rank. Behold, O Pandava, my plight. It is what I do not deserve. You are  alive, yet behold this inversion of order that time hath brought. She  who had the whole Earth to the verge of the sea under her control, is  now under the control of Sudeshna and living in fear of her. She who had  dependants to walk both before and behind her, alas, now herself walketh  before and behind Sudeshna. This, O Kaunteya, is another grief of mine  that is intolerable. O, listen to it. She who had never, save for Kunti,  pounded unguents even for her own use, now, good betide thee, poundeth  sandal (for others). O Kaunteya, behold these hands of mine which were  not so before.' Saying this she showed him her hands marked with corns.  And she continued, 'she who had never feared Kunti herself nor thee and  thy brothers, now standeth in fear before Virata as a slave, anxious of  what that king of kings may say unto her regarding the proper  preparation of the unguents, for Matsya liketh not sandal pounded by  others.'\"        [14] What Draupadi means is that instead of passing her days in      joy and happiness, instead of being able to wish time to be      stationary with her, she is obliged in consequence of her      misery, to wish time to pass off quickly.    Vaisampayana continued, \"Relating her woes thus, O Bharata, unto  Bhimasena, Krishna began to weep silently, casting her eyes on Bhima.  And then, with words choked in tears, and sighing repeatedly, she  addressed Bhima in these words, powerfully stirring his heart, 'Signal,  O Bhima, must have been my offence of old unto the gods, for,  unfortunate as I am. I am yet alive, when, O Pandava, I should die.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Then that slayer of hostile heroes, Vrikodara,  covering his face with those delicate hands of his wife marked with  corns, began to weep. And that mighty son of Kunti, holding the hands of  Draupadi in his, shed copious tears. And afflicted with great woe, he  spoke these words.\"      SECTION XXI    \"Bhima said, 'Fie on the might of my arms and fie on the _Gandiva_ of  Phalguna, inasmuch as thy hands, red before, now become covered with  corns. I would have caused a carnage in Virata's court but for the fact  that Kunti's son eyed me (by way of forbidding it), or like a mighty  elephant, I would, without ado, have crushed the head of Kichaka  intoxicated with the pride of sovereignty. When, O Krishna, I beheld  thee kicked by Kichaka, I conceived at that instant a wholesale  slaughter of the Matsyas. Yudhishthira, however, forbade me by a glance,  and, O beauteous lady, understanding his intention I have kept quiet.  That we have been deprived of our kingdom, that I have not yet slain the  Kurus, that I have not yet taken the heads of Suyodhana and Karna, and  Suvala's son Sakuni, and the wicked Duhsasana, these acts and omissions,  O lady, are consuming every limb of mine. The thought of those abides in  my heart like a javelin implanted in it. O thou of graceful hips, do not  sacrifice virtue, and, O noble-hearted lady, subdue thy wrath. If king  Yudhishthira hear from thee such rebukes, he will surely put an end to  his life. If also Dhananjaya and the twins hear thee speak thus, even  they will renounce life. And if these, O slender-waisted maiden, give up  life, I also shall not be able to bear my own. In olden days Sarjati's  daughter, the beautiful Sukanya, followed into the forest Chyavana of  Bhrigu's race, whose mind was under complete control, and over whom,  while engaged in ascetic meditation, the ants had built a hill. Thou  mayst have heard that Indrasena also who in beauty was like unto  _Narayani_ herself, followed her husband aged a thousand years. Thou  mayst have heard that Janaka's daughter Sita, the princess of Videha,  followed her lord while living in dense woods. And that lady of graceful  hips, Rama's beloved wife, afflicted with calamities and persecuted by  the Rakshasas, at length regained the company of Rama. Lopamudra also, O  timid one, endued with youth and beauty, followed Agastya, renouncing  all the objects of enjoyment unattainable by men. And the intelligent  and faultless Savitri also followed the heroic Satyavan, the son of  Dyumatsena, alone into the world of Yama. Even like these chaste and  beautiful ladies that I have named, thou, O blessed girl, bloomest with  every virtue. Do thou spend a short while more that is measured by even  a half month. And when the thirteenth year is complete, thou wilt  (again) become the Queen regnant of a king.' Hearing these words,  Draupadi said, 'Unable, O Bhima, to bear my griefs, it is from grief  alone that I have shed these tears. I do not censure Yudhishthira. Nor  is there any use in dwelling on the past. O Bhima of mighty strength,  come quickly forward to the work of the hour. O Bhima, Kaikeyi, jealous  of my beauty, always pains me by her endeavours to prevent the king from  taking a fancy to me. And understanding this disposition of hers, the  wicked-souled Kichaka of immoral ways constantly solicits me himself.  Angry with him for this, but then suppressing my wrath I answer that  wretch deprived of sense by lust, saying, \"O Kichaka, protect thyself. I  am the beloved queen and wife of five Gandharvas. Those heroes in wrath  will slay thee that art so rash.\" Thus addressed, Kichaka of wicked soul  replied unto me, saying, \"I have not the least fear of the Gandharvas, O  Sairindhri of sweet smiles. I will slay hundred thousand Gandharvas,  encountering them in battle. Therefore, O timid one, do thou consent.\"  Hearing all this, I again addressed the lust-afflicted Suta, saying,  \"Thou art no match for those illustrious Gandharvas. Of respectable  percentage and good disposition, I ever adhere to virtue and never wish  for the death of any one. It is for this that thou I vest, O Kichaka!\"  At this, that wight of wicked soul burst out into a loud laughter. And  it came to pass that Kaikeyi previously urged by Kichaka, and moved by  affection for her brother, and desirous of doing him a good turn,  despatched me to him, saying \"Do thou, O Sairindhri, fetch wine from  Kichaka's quarters!\" On beholding me the Suta's son at first addressed  me in sweet words, and when that failed, he became exceedingly enraged,  and intended to use violence. Understanding the purpose of the wicked  Kichaka, I speedily rushed towards the place where the king was. Felling  me on the ground the wretch then kicked me in the very presence of the  king himself and before the eyes of Kanka and many others, including  charioteers, and royal favourites, and elephant-riders, and citizens. I  rebuked the king and Kanka again and again. The king, however, neither  prevented Kichaka, nor inflicted any chastisement on him. The principal  ally of king Virata in war, the cruel Kichaka reft of virtue is loved by  both the king and the queen. O exalted one, brave, proud, sinful,  adulterous, and engrossed in all objects of enjoyment, he earneth  immense wealth (from the king), and robs the possessions of others even  if they cry in distress. And he never walketh in the path of virtue, nor  doth he any virtuous act. Of wicked soul, and vicious disposition,  haughty and villainous, and always afflicted by the shafts of Kama,  though repulsed repeatedly, if he sees me again, he will outrage me. I  shall then surely renounce my life. Although striving to acquire virtue  (on my death) your highly meritorious acts will come to naught.

The birth of the Romantic School can be pretty definitely set at about  1796; its cradle was in the quaint university town of Jena, at that  time the home of Schiller and his literary-esthetic enterprises, and  only a few miles away from Goethe in Weimar. Five names embody about  all that was most significant in the earlier movement: Fichte, the  brothers Friedrich and Wilhelm Schlegel, Tieck, and Novalis.    The discussion of Fichte belonging to another division of this work,  it is enough to recall here that he was already professor of  philosophy at Jena when the Schlegel brothers made their home there  in 1796, and that it was while there that he published his _Doctrine  of Science_, the charter of independence of the Romantic School,  announcing the annihilation of physical values, proclaiming the soul  as above things perceived, the inner spirit as that alembic in which  all objects are produced. With almost insolent freshness Fichte  asserted a re-valuation of all values: what had been \"enlightenment\"  was now to be called shallowness; \"ancient crudities\" were to be  reverenced as deeper perceptions of truth; \"fine literature\" was to be  accounted a frivolous thing. Fichte made a stirring appeal to young  men, especially, as being alone able to perceive the meaning of  science and poetry.    To take part in the contagion of these ideas, there settled in Jena in  1796 the two phenomenal Schlegel brothers. It is not easy or necessary  to separate, at this period, the activities of their agile minds. From  their early days, as sons in a most respectable Lutheran parsonage in  North Germany, both had shown enormous hunger for cultural  information, both had been voracious in exploiting the great libraries  within their reach. It is generally asserted that they were lacking in  essential virility and stamina; as to the brilliancy of their  acquisitions, their fineness of appreciation, and their wit, there can  be no question whatever. Madame de Stael called them \"the fathers of  modern criticism,\" a title which has not been challenged by the best  authorities of our time.    Friedrich von Schlegel (1772-1829), the younger of the two, is counted  to be the keener and more original mind. He had a restless and  unsettled youth, mostly spent in studies; after various  disappointments, he determined to make classical antiquity his  life-work; while mastering the body of ancient literature, he was  assimilating, with much the same sort of eagerness, the philosophical  systems of Kant and Fichte. His first notable publication was an  esthetic-philosophic essay, in the ample style of Schiller's later  discourses, _Concerning the Study of Greek Poetry_. He found in the  Greeks of the age of Sophocles the ideal of a fully developed  humanity, and exhibited throughout the discussion a remarkable mastery  of the whole field of classical literature. Just at this time he  removed to Jena to join his older brother, Wilhelm, who was connected  with Schiller's monthly _The Hours_ and his annual _Almanac of the  Muses_. By a strange condition of things Friedrich was actively  engaged at the moment in writing polemic reviews for the organs of  Reichardt, one of Schiller's most annoying rivals in literary  journalism; these reviews became at once noticeable for their depth  and vigorous originality, particularly that one which gave a new and  vital characterization of Lessing. In 1797 he moved to Berlin, where  he gathered a group about him, including Tieck, and in this way  established the external and visible body of the Romantic School,  which the brilliant intellectual atmosphere of the Berlin salons, with  their wealth of gifted and cultured women, did much to promote. In  1799 both he and Tieck joined the Romantic circle at Jena.    In Berlin he published in 1798 the first volume of the _Athenaeum_,  that journal which in a unique way represents the pure Romantic ideal  at its actual fountain-head. It survived for three years, the last  volume appearing in 1800. Its aim was to \"collect all rays of human  culture into one focus,\" and, more particularly, to confute the claim  of the party of \"enlightenment\" that the earlier ages of human  development were poor and unworthy of respect on the part of the  closing eighteenth century. A very large part of the journal was  written by the two brothers, Friedrich furnishing the most aggressive  contributions, more notably being responsible for the epigrammatic  _Fragments_, which became, in their, detached brevity and  irresponsibility, a very favorite model for the form of Romantic  doctrine. \"I can talk daggers,\" he had said when younger, and he wrote  the greater part of these, though some were contributed by Wilhelm  Schlegel, by his admirable wife Caroline, by Schleiermacher, and  Novalis. The root of this form lies in French thinking and  expression--especially the short deliverances of Chamfort, the  epigrammatist of the French Revolution. These Orphic-apocalyptic  sentences are a sort of foundation for a new Romantic bible. They are  absolutely disconnected, they show a mixture and interpenetration of  different spheres of thought and observation, with an unexpected  deference to the appraisals of classic antiquity. Their range is  unlimited: philosophy and psychology, mathematics and esthetics,  philosophy and natural science, sociology and society, literature and  the theatre are all largely represented in their scope.    Friedrich Schlegel's epigrammatic wit is the direct precursor of  Heine's clever conceits in prose: one is instantly reminded of him by  such _Athenaeum_-fragments as \"Kant, the Copernicus of Philosophy;\"  \"Plato's philosophy is a worthy preface to the religion of the  future;\" \"So-called 'happy marriages' are related to love, as a  correct poem to an improvised song;\" \"In genuine prose all words  should be printed in italics;\" \"Catholicism is naive Christianity;  Protestantism is sentimental.\" The sheer whimsicality of phrase seems  to be at times its own excuse for being, as in an explanation of  certain elegiac poems as \"the sensation of misery in the contemplation  of the silliness of the relations of banality to craziness;\" but there  are many sentences which go deep below the surface--none better  remembered, perhaps, than the dictum, \"The French Revolution, Fichte's  _Doctrine of Science_, and Goethe's _Wilhelm Meister_ are the greatest  symptoms of our age.\"    In the _Athenaeum_ both brothers give splendid testimony to their  astonishing and epoch-making gift in transferring classical and  Romance metrical forms into elegant, idiomatic German; they give  affectionate attention to the insinuating beauty of elegiac verse, and  secure charming effects in some of the most alien Greek forms, not to  mention _terza rima, ottava rima_, the Spanish gloss, and not a few  very notable sonnets.    The literary criticisms of the _Athenaeum_ are characteristically free  and aggressive, particularly in the frequent sneers at the flat  \"homely\" poetry of sandy North Germany. At the end of the second  volume, the \"faked\" _Literary Announcements_ are as daring as any  attempts of American newspaper humor. When the sum of the contents and  tendency of the journal is drawn, it is a strange mixture of  discriminating philosophy, devoted Christianity, Greek sensuousness,  and pornographic mysticism. There is a never-ending esthetic coquetry  with the flesh, with a serious defense of some very Greek practices  indeed. All of this is thoroughly typical of the spirit of the  Romantic school, and it is by no means surprising that Friedrich's  first book, the novel _Lucinda_ (1799), should stand as the supreme  unsavory classic in this field. That excellent divine, Schleiermacher,  exalted this document of the Rights of the Flesh as \"a paean of Love,  in all its completeness,\" but it is a feeble, tiresome performance,  absolutely without structure, quite deserving the saucy epigram on  which it was pilloried by the wit of the time:      Pedantry once of Fancy begged the dole    Of one brief kiss; she pointed him to Shame.    He, impotent and wanton, then Shame's favors stole.    Into the world at length a dead babe came--    \"_Lucinda_\" was its name.    The preaching of \"religion,\" \"womanliness,\" and the \"holy fire of  divine enjoyment\" makes an unedifying _melange_: \"The holiest thing in  any human being is his own mind, his own power, his own will;\" \"You do  all according to your own mind, and refuse to be swayed by what is  usual and proper.\" Schleiermacher admired in it that \"highest wisdom  and profoundest religion\" which lead people to \"yield to the rhythm of  fellowship and friendship, and to disturb no harmony of love.\" In more  prosaic diction, the upshot of its teaching was the surrender to  momentary feelings, quite divorced from Laws or Things. The only  morality is \"full Humanity;\" \"Nature alone is worthy of honor, and  sound health alone is worthy of love;\" \"Let the discourse of love,\"  counsels Julius, \"be bold and free, not more chastened than a Roman  elegy\"--which is certainly not very much--and the skirmishes of  inclination are, in fact, set forth with an almost antique simplicity.  Society is to be developed only by \"wit,\" which is seriously put into  comparison with God Almighty. As to practical ethics, one is told that  the most perfect life is but a pure vegetation; the right to indolence  is that which really makes the discrimination between choice and  common beings, and is the determining principle of nobility. \"The  divine art of being indolent\" and \"the blissful bosom of  half-conscious self-forgetfulness\" naturally lead to the thesis"]]]
