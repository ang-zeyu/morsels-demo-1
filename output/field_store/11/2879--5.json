I know that you must have some good reason for your idea;  something, I mean, other than the mere words which have puzzled us all  so much. Won't you tell me?\"    Now, Paul Harley had determined, since the girl was unacquainted with  Nicol Brinn, to conceal from her all that he had learned from that  extraordinary man. In this determination he had been actuated, too, by  the promptings of the note of danger which, once seemingly attuned to  the movements of Sir Charles Abingdon, had, after the surgeon's death,  apparently become centred upon himself and upon Nicol Brinn. He dreaded  the thought that the cloud might stretch out over the life of this girl  who sat beside him and whom he felt so urgently called upon to protect  from such a menace.    The cloud? What was this cloud, whence did it emanate, and by whom had  it been called into being? He looked into the violet eyes, and as a  while before he had moved alone through the wilderness of London now he  seemed to be alone with Phil Abingdon on the border of a spirit world  which had no existence for the multitudes around. Psychically, he  was very close to her at that moment; and when he replied he replied  evasively: \"I have absolutely no scrap of evidence, Miss Abingdon,  pointing to foul play. The circumstances were peculiar, of course, but  I have every confidence in Doctor McMurdoch's efficiency. Since he is  satisfied, it would be mere impertinence on my part to question his  verdict.\"    Phil Abingdon repeated the weary sigh and turned her head aside,  glancing down to where with one small shoe she was restlessly tapping  the floor of the cab. They were both silent for some moments.    \"Don't you trust me?\" she asked, suddenly. \"Or don't you think I am  clever enough to share your confidence?\"    As she spoke she looked at him challengingly, and he felt all the force  of personality which underlay her outward lightness of manner.    \"I both trust you and respect your intelligence,\" he answered, quietly.  \"If I withhold anything from you, I am prompted by a very different  motive from the one you suggest.\"    \"Then you are keeping something from me,\" she said, softly. \"I knew you  were.\"    \"Miss Abingdon,\" replied Harley, \"when the worst trials of this affair  are over, I want to have a long talk with you. Until then, won't you  believe that I am acting for the best?\"    But Phil Abingdon's glance was unrelenting.    \"In your opinion it may be so, but you won't do me the honour of  consulting mine.\"    Harley had half anticipated this attitude, but had hoped that she  would not adopt it. She possessed in a high degree the feminine art of  provoking a quarrel. But he found much consolation in the fact that she  had thus shifted the discussion from the abstract to the personal. He  smiled slightly, and Phil Abingdon's expression relaxed in response and  she lowered her eyes quickly. \"Why do you persistently treat me like a  child?\" she said.    \"I don't know,\" replied Harley, delighted but bewildered by her sudden  change of mood. \"Perhaps because I want to.\"    She did not answer him, but stared abstractedly out of the cab window;  and Harley did not break this silence, much as he would have liked to do  so. He was mentally reviewing his labours of the preceding day when, in  the character of a Colonial visitor with much time on his hands, he had  haunted the Savoy for hours in the hope of obtaining a glimpse of Ormuz  Khan. His vigil had been fruitless, and on returning by a roundabout  route to his office he had bitterly charged himself with wasting  valuable time upon a side issue. Yet when, later, he had sat in his  study endeavouring to arrange his ideas in order, he had discovered many  points in his own defence.    If his ineffective surveillance of Ormuz Khan had been dictated by  interest in Phil Abingdon rather than by strictly professional motives,  it was, nevertheless, an ordinary part of the conduct of such a case.  But while he had personally undertaken the matter of his excellency  he had left the work of studying the activities of Nicol Brinn to an  assistant. He could not succeed in convincing himself that, on the  evidence available, the movements of the Oriental gentleman were more  important than those of the American.    \"Here we are,\" said Phil Abingdon.    She alighted, and Harley dismissed the cabman and followed the girl  into Doctor McMurdoch's house. Here he made the acquaintance of Mrs.  McMurdoch, who, as experience had taught him to anticipate, was as plump  and merry and vivacious as her husband was lean, gloomy, and taciturn.  But she was a perfect well of sympathy, as her treatment of the bereaved  girl showed. She took her in her arms and hugged her in a way that was  good to see.    \"We were waiting for you, dear,\" she said when the formality of  presenting Harley was over. \"Are you quite sure that you want to go?\"    Phil Abingdon nodded pathetically. She had raised her veil, and Harley  could see that her eyes were full of tears. \"I should like to see the  flowers,\" she answered.    She was staying at the McMurdochs' house, and as the object at present  in view was that of a visit to her old home, from which the funeral  of Sir Charles Abingdon was to take place on the morrow, Harley became  suddenly conscious of the fact that his presence was inopportune.    \"I believe you want to see me, Doctor McMurdoch,\" he said, turning to  the dour physician. \"Shall I await your return or do you expect to be  detained?\"    But Phil Abingdon had her own views on the matter. She stepped up beside  him and linked her arm in his.    \"Please come with me, Mr. Harley,\" she pleaded. \"I want you to.\"    As a result he found himself a few minutes later entering the hall  of the late Sir Charles's house. The gloved hand resting on his arm  trembled, but when he looked down solicitously into Phil Abingdon's  face she smiled bravely, and momentarily her clasp tightened as if to  reassure him.    It seemed quite natural that she should derive comfort from the presence  of this comparative stranger; and neither of the two, as they  stood there looking at the tributes to the memory of the late Sir  Charles--which overflowed from a neighbouring room into the lobby  and were even piled upon the library table--were conscious of any  strangeness in the situation.    The first thing that had struck Harley on entering the house had been  an overpowering perfume of hyacinths. Now he saw whence it arose; for,  conspicuous amid the wreaths and crosses, was an enormous device formed  of hyacinths. Its proportions dwarfed those of all the others.    Mrs. Howett, the housekeeper, a sad-eyed little figure, appeared now  from behind the bank of flowers. Her grief could not rob her of that  Old World manner which was hers, and she saluted the visitors with a bow  which promised to develop into a curtsey. Noting the direction of Phil  Abingdon's glance, which was set upon a card attached to the wreath of  hyacinths: \"It was the first to arrive, Miss Phil,\" she said. \"Isn't it  beautiful?\"    \"It's wonderful,\" said the girl, moving forward and drawing Harley along  with her. She glanced from the card up to his face, which was set in a  rather grim expression.    \"Ormuz Khan has been so good,\" she said. \"He sent his secretary to see  if he could be of any assistance yesterday, but I certainly had not  expected this.\"    Her eyes filled with tears again, and, because he thought they were  tears of gratitude, Harley clenched his hand tightly so that the muscles  of his forearm became taut to Phil Abingdon's touch. She looked up at  him, smiling pathetically: \"Don't you think it was awfully kind of him?\"  she asked.    \"Very,\" replied Harley.    A dry and sepulchral cough of approval came from Doctor McMurdoch; and  Harley divined with joy that when the ordeal of the next day was over  Phil Abingdon would have to face cross-examination by the conscientious  Scotsman respecting this stranger whose attentions, if Orientally  extravagant, were instinct with such generous sympathy.    For some reason the heavy perfume of the hyacinths affected him  unpleasantly. All his old doubts and suspicions found a new life, so  that his share in the conversation which presently arose became confined  to a few laconic answers to direct questions.    He was angry, and his anger was more than half directed against himself,  because he knew that he had no shadow of right to question this girl  about her friendships or even to advise her. He determined, however,  even at the cost of incurring a rebuke, to urge Doctor McMurdoch to  employ all the influence he possessed to terminate an acquaintanceship  which could not be otherwise than undesirable, if it was not actually  dangerous.    When, presently, the party returned to the neighbouring house of the  physician, however, Harley's plans in this respect were destroyed by  the action of Doctor McMurdoch, in whose composition tact was not a  predominant factor. Almost before they were seated in the doctor's  drawing room he voiced his disapproval. \"Phil,\" he said, ignoring a  silent appeal from his wife, \"this is, mayhap, no time to speak of the  matter, but I'm not glad to see the hyacinths.\"    Phil Abingdon's chin quivered rebelliously, and, to Harley's dismay,  it was upon him that she fixed her gaze in replying. \"Perhaps you also  disapprove of his excellency's kindness?\" she said, indignantly.    Harley found himself temporarily at a loss for words. She was perfectly  well aware that he disapproved, and now was taking a cruel pleasure in  reminding him of the fact that he was not entitled to do so. Had he  been capable of that calm analysis to which ordinarily he submitted all  psychological problems, he must have found matter for rejoicing in  this desire of the girl's to hurt him. \"I am afraid, Miss Abingdon,\" he  replied, quietly, \"that the matter is not one in which I am"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11602"],[0,"The World of Ice (#11)"],[1," Mivins, shall I lay the table-cloth?  or would it be better to slump dinner with tea this afternoon?\"    Mivins started. \"Ha! caught me napping! Down below, you young dog!\"    The boy dived instantly, followed, first by a dish-clout, rolled tightly  up and well aimed, and afterwards by his active-limbed superior. Both  reached the region of smells, cruets, and crockery at the same moment,  and each set energetically to work at their never-ending duties.    Soon after this the ice suddenly loosened, and the crew succeeded, after  a few hours' hard labour, in warping the _Dolphin_ once more out of the  pack; but scarcely had this been accomplished when another storm, which  had been gradually gathering, burst upon them, and compelled them once  more to seek the shelter of the land.    Numerous walruses rolled about in the bays here, and they approached  much nearer to the vessel than they had yet done, affording those on  board a good view of their huge, uncouth visages, as they shook their  shaggy fronts and ploughed up the waves with their tusks. These enormous  creatures are the elephants of the Arctic Ocean. Their aspect is  particularly grim and fierce, and being nearly equal to elephants in  bulk they are not less terrible than they appear. In form they somewhat  resemble seals, having barrel-shaped bodies, with round, or rather  square, blunt heads and shaggy bristling moustaches, and two long ivory  tusks which curve downwards instead of upwards, serving the purpose  frequently of hooks, by means of which and their fore-flippers they can  pull themselves up on the rocks and icebergs. Indeed, they are sometimes  found at a considerable height up the sides of steep cliffs, basking in  the sun.    Fred was anxious to procure the skull of one of these monstrous animals,  but the threatening appearance of the weather rendered any attempt to  secure one at that time impossible. A dark sinister scowl overhung the  blink under the cloud-bank to the southward, and the dovkies which had  enlivened their progress hitherto forsook the channel, as if they  distrusted the weather. Captain Guy made every possible preparation to  meet the coming storm, by warping down under the shelter of a ledge of  rock, to which he made fast with two good hawsers, while everything was  made snug on board.    \"We are going to catch it, I fear,\" said Fred, glancing at the black  clouds that hurried across the sky to the northward, while he walked the  deck with his friend, Tom Singleton.    \"I suspect so,\" replied Tom, \"and it does not raise my spirits to see  Saunders shaking his huge visage so portentously. Do you know, I have a  great belief in that fellow. He seems to know everything and to have  gone through every sort of experience, and I notice that most of his  prognostications come to pass.\"    \"So they do, Tom,\" said Fred; \"but I wish he would put a better face on  things till they _do_ come to pass. His looks are enough to frighten  one.\"    \"I think we shall require another line out, Mr. Saunders,\" remarked the  captain, as the gale freshened, and the two hawsers were drawn straight  and rigid like bars of iron; \"send ashore and make a whale-line fast  immediately.\"    The second mate obeyed with a grunt that seemed to insinuate that _he_  would have had one out long ago. In a few minutes it was fast; and not a  moment too soon, for immediately after it blew a perfect hurricane.  Heavier and heavier it came, and the ice began to drift more wildly than  ever. The captain had just given orders to make fast another line, when  the sharp, twanging snap of a cord was heard. The six-inch hawser had  parted, and they were swinging by the two others, with the gale roaring  like a lion through the spars and rigging. Half a minute more and  \"twang, twang!\" came another report, and the whale-line was gone. Only  one rope now held them to the land, and prevented them being swept into  the turmoil of ice, and wind, and water, from which the rocky ledge  protected them. The hawser was a good one--a new ten-inch rope. It sang  like the deep tones of an organ, loud above the rattle of the rigging  and the shrouds; but that was its death-song. It gave way with the noise  of a cannon, and in the smoke that followed its recoil they were dragged  out by the wild ice, and driven hither and thither at its mercy.    With some difficulty the ship was warped into a place of comparative  security in the rushing drift, but it was soon thrown loose again, and  severely squeezed by the rolling masses. Then an attempt was made to set  the sails and beat up for the land; but the rudder was almost  unmanageable owing to the ice, and nothing could be made of it, so they  were compelled to go right before the wind under close-reefed top-sails,  in order to keep some command of the ship. All hands were on deck  watching in silence the ice ahead of them, which presented a most  formidable aspect.    Away to the north the strait could be seen growing narrower, with heavy  ice-tables grinding up and clogging it from cliff to cliff on either  side. About seven in the evening they were close upon the piling  masses, to enter into which seemed certain destruction.    \"Stand by to let go the anchor!\" cried the captain, in the desperate  hope of being able to wind the ship.    \"What's that ahead of us?\" exclaimed the first mate suddenly.    \"Ship on the starboard bow, right in-shore!\" roared the look-out.    The attention of the crew was for a moment called from their own  critical situation towards the strange vessel which now came into view,  having been previously concealed from them by a large grounded berg.    \"Can you make her out, Mr. Bolton?\"    \"Yes, sir; I think she's a large brig, but she seems much chafed, and  there's no name left on the stern, if ever there was one.\"    As he spoke, the driving snow and fog cleared up partially, and the brig  was seen not three hundred yards from them, drifting slowly into the  loose ice. There was evidently no one on board; and although one or two  of the sails were loose, they hung in shreds from the yards. Scarcely  had this been noted when the _Dolphin_ struck against a large mass of  ice, and quivered under the violence of the shock.    \"Let go!\" shouted the captain.    Down went the heaviest anchor they had, and for two minutes the chain  flew out at the hawse-hole.    \"Hold on!\"    The chain was checked, but the strain was awful. A mass of ice,  hundreds of tons weight, was tearing down towards the bow. There was no  hope of resisting it. Time was not even afforded to attach a buoy or log  to the cable, so it was let slip, and thus the _Dolphin's_ best bower  was lost for ever.    But there was no time to think of or regret this, for the ship was now  driving down with the gale, scraping against a lee of ice which was  seldom less than thirty feet thick. Almost at the same moment the  strange vessel was whirled close to them, not more than fifty yards  distant, between two driving masses of thick ice.    \"What if it should be my father's brig?\" whispered Fred Ellice, as he  grasped Singleton's arm and turned to him a face of ashy paleness.    \"No fear of that, lad,\" said Buzzby, who stood near the larboard gangway  and had overheard the remark. \"I'd know your father's brig among a  thousand--\"    As he spoke, the two masses of ice closed, and the brig was nipped  between them. For a few seconds she seemed to tremble like a living  creature, and every timber creaked. Then she was turned slowly on one  side, until the crew of the _Dolphin_ could see down into her hold,  where the beams were giving way and cracking up as matches might be  crushed in the grasp of a strong hand. Then the larboard bow was  observed to yield as if it were made of soft clay, the starboard bow was  pressed out, and the ice was forced into the forecastle. Scarcely three  minutes had passed since the nip commenced; in one minute more the brig  went down, and the ice was rolling wildly, as if in triumph, over the  spot where she had disappeared.    The fate of this vessel, which might so soon be their own, threw a  momentary gloom over the crew of the _Dolphin_, but their position left  them no time for thought. One upturned mass rose above the gunwale,  smashed in the bulwarks, and deposited half a ton of ice on deck.  Scarcely had this danger passed when a new enemy appeared in sight  ahead. Directly in their way, just beyond the line of floe-ice against  which they were alternately thumping and grinding, lay a group of bergs.  There was no possibility of avoiding them, and the only question was,  whether they were to be dashed to pieces on their hard blue sides, or,  perchance, in some providential nook to find a refuge from the storm.    \"There's an open lead between them and the floe-ice,\" exclaimed Bolton  in a hopeful tone of voice, seizing an ice-pole and leaping on the  gunwale.    \"Look alive, men, with your poles,\" cried the captain, \"and shove with a  will!\"    The \"Ay, ay, sir,\" of the men was uttered with a heartiness that showed  how powerfully this gleam of hope acted on their spirits; but a new damp  was cast over them when, on gaining the open passage, they discovered  that the bergs were not at rest, but were bearing down on the floe-ice  with slow but awful momentum, and threatening to crush the ship between  the two. Just then a low berg came driving up from the southward,  dashing the spray over its sides, and with its forehead ploughing up  the smaller ice as if in scorn. A happy thought flashed across the  captain's mind.    \"Down the quarter boat,\" he cried.    In an instant it struck the water, and four men were on the thwarts.    \"Cast an ice-anchor on that berg.\"    Peter Grim obeyed the order, and, with a swing that Hercules would have  envied, planted it securely. In another moment the ship was following in  the wake of this novel tug! It was a moment of great danger, for the  bergs encroached on their"]]]
