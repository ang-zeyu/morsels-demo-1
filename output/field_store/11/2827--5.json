[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10163"],[0,"Mohammedanism (#11)"],[1,"methodic  asceticism and contemplation is doubted by few. The following opinion has  come to prevail in wide circles: the Law offers the bread of life to all  the faithful, the dogmatics are the arsenal from which the weapons must be  taken to defend the treasures of religion against unbelief and heresy, but  mysticism shows the earthly pilgrim the way to Heaven.    It was a much lower need that assured the cult of saints a place in the  doctrine and practice of Islam. As strange as is Mohammed's transformation  from an ordinary son of man, which he wanted to be, into the incarnation  of Divine Light, as the later biographers represent him, it is still more  astounding that the intercession of saints should have become indispensable  to the community of Mohammed, who, according to Tradition, cursed the Jews  and Christians because they worshipped the shrines of their prophets.  Almost every Moslim village has its patron saint; every country has its  national saints; every province of human life has its own human rulers,  who are intermediate between the Creator and common mortals. In no other  particular has Islam more fully accommodated itself to the religions it  supplanted. The popular practice, which is in many cases hardly to be  distinguished from polytheism, was, to a great extent, favoured by the  theory of the intercession of the pious dead, of whose friendly assistance  people might assure themselves by doing good deeds in their names and to  their eternal advantage.    The ordinary Moslim visitor of the graves of saints does not trouble  himself with this ingenious compromise between the severe monotheism of his  prophet and the polytheism of his ancestors. He is firmly convinced, that  the best way to obtain the satisfaction of his desire after earthly or  heavenly goods is to give the saint whose special care these are what he  likes best; and he confidently leaves it to the venerated one to settle the  matter with Allah, who is far too high above the ordinary mortal to allow  of direct contact.    In support even of this startling deviation from the original, traditions  have been devised. Moreover, the veneration of human beings was favoured  by some forms of mysticism; for, like many saints, many mystics had their  eccentricities, and it was much to the advantage of mystic theologians if  the vulgar could be persuaded to accept their aberrations from normal  rules of life as peculiarities of holy men. But Ijma' did more even than  tradition and mysticism to make the veneration of legions of saints  possible in the temples of the very men who were obliged by their ritual  law to say to Allah several time daily: \"Thee only do we worship and to  Thee alone do we cry for help.\"    In the tenth century of our era Islam's process of accommodation was  finished in all its essentials. From this time forward, if circumstances  were favourable, it could continue the execution of its world conquering  plans without being compelled to assimilate any more foreign elements.  Against each spiritual asset that another universal religion could boast,  it could now put forward something of a similar nature, but which still  showed characteristics of its own, and the superiority of which it could  sustain by arguments perfectly satisfactory to its followers. From that  time on, Islam strove to distinguish itself ever more sharply from its most  important rivals. There was no absolute stagnation, the evolution was not  entirely stopped; but it moved at a much quieter pace, and its direction  was governed by internal motives, not by influences from outside. Moslim  catholicism had attained its full growth.    We cannot within the small compass of these lectures consider the  excrescences of the normal Islam, the Shi'itic ultras, who venerated  certain descendants of Mohammed as infallible rulers of the world,  Ishma'ilites, Qarmatians, Assassins; nor the modern bastards of Islam, such  as the Sheikhites, the Babi's, the Beha'is--who have found some adherents  in America--and other sects, which indeed sprang up on Moslim soil, but  deliberately turned to non-Mohammedan sources for their inspirations. We  must draw attention, however, to protests raised by certain minorities  against some of the ideas and practices which had been definitely adopted  by the majority.    In the midst of Mohammedan Catholicism there always lived and moved more or  less freely \"protestant\" elements. The comparison may even be continued,  with certain qualifications, and we may speak also of a conservative and  of a liberal protestantism in Islam. The conservative Protestantism  is represented by the Hanbalitic school and kindred spirits, who most  emphatically preached that the Agreement (Ijma') of every period should be  based on that of the \"pious ancestors.\" They therefore tested every dogma  and practice by the words and deeds of the Prophet, his contemporaries, and  the leaders of the Community in the first decades after Mohammed's death.  In their eyes the Church of later days had degenerated; and they declined  to consider the agreement of its doctors as justifying the penetration  into Islam of ideas and usages of foreign origin. The cult of saints was  rejected by them as altogether contradictory to the Qoran and the genuine  tradition. These protestants of Islam may be compared to those of  Christianity also in this respect, that they accepted the results of the  evolution and assimilation of the first three centuries of Islam, but  rejected later additions as abuse and corruption. When on the verge of our  nineteenth century, they tried, as true Moslims, to force by material means  their religious conceptions on others, they were combated as heretics by  the authorities of catholic Islam. Central and Western Arabia formed the  battlefield on which these zealots, called Wahhabites after their leader,  were defeated by Mohammed Ali, the first Khedive, and his Egyptian army.  Since they have given up their efforts at violent reconstitution of what  they consider to be the original Islam, they are left alone, and their  ideas have found adherents far outside Arabia, _e.g._, in British India and  in Northern and Central Africa.    In still quite another way many Moslims who found their freedom of thought  or action impeded by the prevailing law and doctrine, have returned to the  origin of their religion. Too much attached to the traditions of their  faith, deliberately to disregard these impediments, they tried to find in  the Qoran and Tradition arguments in favour of what was dictated to them by  Reason; and they found those arguments as easily as former generations had  found the bases on which to erect their casuistry, their dogma, and their  mysticism. This implied an interpretation of the oldest sources independent  from the catholic development of Islam, and in contradiction with the  general opinion of the canonists, according to whom, since the fourth or  fifth century of the Hijrah, no one is qualified for such free research. A  certain degree of independence of mind, together with a strong attachment  to their spiritual past, has given rise in the Moslim world to this sort  of liberal protestantism, which in our age has many adherents among the  Mohammedans who have come in contact with modern civilization.    That the partisans of all these different conceptions could remain together  as the children of one spiritual family, is largely owing to the elastic  character of Ijma', the importance of which is to some extent acknowledged  by catholics and protestants, by moderns and conservatives. It has never  been contested that the community, whose agreement was the test of truth,  should not consist of the faithful masses, but of the expert elect. In  a Christian church we should have spoken of the clergy, with a further  definition of the organs through which it was to express itself synod,  council, or Pope. Islam has no clergy, as we have seen; the qualification  of a man to have his own opinion depends entirely upon the scope of his  knowledge or rather of his erudition. There is no lack of standards, fixed  by Mohammedan authorities, in which the requirements for a scholar to  qualify him for Ijma' are detailed. The principal criterion is the  knowledge of the canon law; quite what we should expect from the history  of the evolution of Islam. But, of course, dogmatists and mystics had also  their own \"agreements\" on the questions concerning them, and through the  compromise between Law, Dogma, and Mysticism, there could not fail to  come into existence a kind of mixed Ijma'. Moreover, the standards and  definitions could have only a certain theoretical value, as there never has  existed a body that could speak in the name of all. The decisions of Ijma'  were therefore to be ascertained only in a vague and general way. The  speakers were individuals whose own authority depended on Ijma', whereas  Ijma' should have been their collective decision. Thus it was possible for  innumerable shades of Catholicism and protestantism to live under one roof;  with a good deal of friction, it is true, but without definite breach or  schism, no one sect being able to eject another from the community.    Moslim political authorities are bound not only to extend the domain of  Islam, but also to keep the community in the right path in its life and  doctrine. This task they have always conceived in accordance with their  political interests; Islam has had its religious persecutions but tolerance  was very usual, and even official favouring of heresy not quite exceptional  with Moslim rulers. Regular maintenance of religious discipline existed  nowhere. Thus in the bond of political obedience elements which might  otherwise have been scattered were held together.

Our historical interests have never  collided. Then we suddenly became aware that this country, under the  mask of friendship, had egged on the whole of Europe to attack us. Not  because we had injured English feelings or interests, but solely to  destroy a competitor and divide his coat of many colours.    \"No political necessity compelled modern Carthage to declare war on us,  but merely the avowed aim to do a good piece of business by the war.  Without England's intrigues Europe would never have dared to attack us.  In our case, therefore, hate has sprung out of disappointed love.  England has become our mortal enemy, just as Russia is Austria's. In a  word, the two Central Powers are inspired by moral superiority over  their enemies, and are determined to wage war on them to the last drop  of blood, and if fate permits it, to settle them off and settle up with  them once for all.    \"At the commencement of the mobilization the railway time-tables in  force were cancelled; railway traffic ceased, and only slow local-trains  ran, stopping at every station to pick up the men. During the nights a  gigantic transport of troops went on to the frontiers. From that moment  the sale of alcohol on the stations was prohibited. The publication of  news concerning troop movements was suppressed, in order to veil our  objective and to keep secret our strength on the various frontiers.    \"The trains in the Tyrol were decked with wreaths and flowers. They bore  Germans from the most southerly corners of our neutral ally--Italy.  Members of the _Wehrkraftverein_ (Boy Scouts) inspected the trains at  every station, and it is said that a Serb was found bound fast  underneath one of the carriages. Serbian scoundrels were found on all  sides; if one of them had succeeded in destroying the Brenner line the  whole plan of mobilization would have been disturbed. Therefore  sentinels were placed along the whole line and strong guards protected  every tunnel. At night all lights were put out and those on the engines  covered up; even the stations were not illuminated--everywhere darkness.    \"Slowly feeling its way, the train crept over the Brenner--it took  twelve hours; in Innsbruck the station was crowded with Germans to  welcome the warriors, and the ancient hills echoed again and again the  'Wacht am Rhein.' The solemnity which had marked the first days in  Munich had given place to boisterous joy. Thousands of men in mountain  costume had flocked into Munich to offer themselves as volunteers, and  the streets and station rang with their _jodeln_! (the peculiar cry of  Alpine herdsmen).    \"Outside the station lay vast quantities of materials for the Flying  Corps, and innumerable motor-cars. A regiment of artillery was just  leaving, while a band was in the centre of the station; the rhythm of  the kettle-drums rolled mightily, and the music clashed in the huge  central hall; thousands of voices joined in, then helmets, hats, caps,  rifles and swords were waved and the train moved off amid shouts: 'Go  for them! Cut them down!' ('Drauf auf die Kerle! Haut sie  zusammen!')\"[29]    [Footnote 29: Colonel Frobenius: \"Durch Not und Tod\" (\"Through Distress  and Death\"). Leipzig, 1915, p. 12 et seq.]    \"If I live to be a hundred I shall never forget these days. They are the  greatest in our history. We never dreamed that anything so overwhelming  could be experienced on earth. Only three weeks ago and we should have  been quite incapable of imagining its like. The feeling that we have  experienced something overpowering, something which we cannot utter,  overwhelms us all. We see it in each other's faces and feel it in the  pressure of a hand. Words are too weak, so each is silent about what he  feels. We are conscious of one thing alone: Germany's heart has appeared  to us!    \"At last we see each other as we are, and that is the indescribable  something--the birth of this great time. Never have we been so earnest  and never so glad. Every other thought, every other feeling has gone.  What we have thought and felt before was all unreality, mere ghosts; day  has dawned and they have fled. The whole land bristles with arms and  every German heart is filled with trust. If we were always as we are  to-day--one heart and one voice--then the whole world would have to bow  before us. But we no longer knew ourselves, we had forgotten our real  nature. We were so many and so divided, and each wanted only to be  himself. How was it that such madness could have blinded us, and discord  weakened us?    \"Now we realize our strength and see what we can achieve, for in spite  of all we have retained our integrity; we have suffered no injury to the  soul. Germany's soul had slept awhile and now awakes like a giant  refreshed, and we can hardly recollect what it was all like only three  weeks ago, when each lived for himself, when we were at best only  parties, not a people. Each knew not the other, because he knew not  himself. In unholy egoism everyone had forgotten his highest will. Now  each has found his true will again, and that is proved--for we have only  one.    \"In all German hearts flames the same holy wrath. A sacred wrath which  sanctifies and heals. Every wound heals; we are again healthy and whole.  Praise be to God for this war which delivered us on the first day from  German quarrelsomeness! When the days of peace return we must prove that  we deserve to have lived through this holy German war. Then no word must  be spoken, no deed done on German soil which would be unworthy of these  sublime days.    \"Groups stand at the street corners reading the latest news. One counts  aloud how many enemies we have: there are already six. A silence ensues,  till someone says: 'Many enemies, great honour, and we shall win, for  our cause is just!' Such utterances can be heard every day. That is  German faith; human might does not decide, but God's justice! That is  the Supreme blessing of this great time; we put our trust in the spirit.  Modern Germans have never breathed before so pure an atmosphere, for  Germany's soul has appeared to us.           *       *       *       *       *    \"I am going to pronounce a blessing on this war, the blessing which is  on all lips, for we Germans, no matter in what part of the world we are,  all bless, bless and bless again this world war. I do not intend to  become lyrical. Lyric is so far from me that in all these three months I  have not composed a single war poem. No, I shall endeavour to count up  quite calmly, unlyrically, what we have seen during these three months:  point for point, the whole list of surprises, for they have all been  surprises, one after the other.    \"Only a few days ago a high State official said to me: 'Let us confess  at once that in all Europe nobody believed in this war; everybody had  prepared for it, but nobody thought it possible--not even those who  wanted war.'    \"All thinking men considered that the interwoven economic dependence on  each other among the nations, was so strong that none dare commit  suicide by commencing a war. Thus we spoke to each other, and that  seemed an axiom. Further, it seemed to be true that even if a madman let  loose the dogs of war, then it would be all over in a fortnight. The man  in the street imagined that it would be a kind of parade (_Aufmarsch_),  a mobilization test, and the power which succeeded best would be the  victor, for no country in the world was strong enough to stand the  enormous cost for longer than three weeks.    \"Now three months have gone, and we have stood the strain, and we can  bear it for another three, six months, a year, or as many years as it  must be. The calculation was wrong, all the calculations were wrong: the  reality of this war surpasses everything which we had imagined, and it  has been glorious to experience on so grand a scale that reality always  surpasses the conception. Even that is not true which we learned in all  the schools and read in all the books--that every war is an awful  misfortune. Even this war is horrible; yes, but our salvation. It seems  so to us, and so it has appeared to us from the very first day onwards.    \"That first day will remain in our memories for ever; never in all our  lives had we experienced anything so grand, and we had never believed it  possible to experience anything so magnificent. Word for word Bismarck's  prophecy (1888) has come true: 'It must be a war to which the whole  nation gives its assent; it must be a national war, conducted with an  enthusiasm like that of 1870, when we were ruthlessly attacked. Then all  Germany from the Memel to Lake Constance will blaze up like a  powder-mine and the whole land bristle with bayonets.' The war which  Bismarck prophesied was this war, and what he foretold came to pass, and  we saw it with our eyes. We saw the German mobilization with eyes which  since then have been consecrate.    \"All enthusiasm is splendid, even in an individual, be he who he may and  for whatever cause you like. In enthusiasm everything good in a man  appears, while the common and vulgar in him sinks away. Any enthusiasm  either of groups or societies in which the individual ego loses itself  is grand, but the mighty enthusiasm of a powerful people is  overwhelming. This was, however, an enthusiasm of a peculiar sort--it  was well disciplined, an enthusiasm combined with and controlled by the  highest order.    \"In this the fundamental secret of German power was revealed: to remain  calm in enthusiasm, cold amidst fire and still obedient to duty in a  tornado of passion. Then we were all inspired by the thought and  feeling: 'Nobody can achieve that, for in order to be able to do it we  have had to perform a huge intellectual and spiritual task.
