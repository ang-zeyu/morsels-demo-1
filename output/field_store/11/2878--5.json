His aunt, in whose  family he was staying, was a woman who had long lived in habitual  intercourse with the unseen world through prayer. One afternoon, when it  seemed to those around him that the sick one must die, she went away  alone to speak with God. With intense earnestness she pleaded for the  young man's life. And, being deeply interested in the portion of our  country then beginning to be settled, she asked also that he might  become a home missionary at the West. There were various circumstances  which made this latter request, as well as the other, seem very unlikely  to be fulfilled. And yet it was. The young man recovered, pursued a  collegiate and theological course, and still lives and labors as a most  devoted and useful Christian pioneer. More than once he has been a  member of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, and his name  is familiar to many.\"      A POOR STUDENT PRAYS FOR MONEY.      \"I was a poor student in a Manual Labor Institute at the West. The month  of February was our regular Winter vacation. We were privileged to keep  our rooms and have board at one dollar a week. But I had absolutely no  money. I was six hundred miles from my friends, and they were unable to  furnish me with funds. I had no books for the new term, though these  were a necessity if I went on with my class, and there was no work about  the Institution, nor that I know of in the neighborhood at that season.  My case seemed an exceedingly bad one; and I had no idea from where any  help could come. So I went to my room in the third story, locked my door  and carried my case to the Lord. It was a long, earnest, tearful cry for  help from Him who alone seemed able to give it. My prayer was answered.  When I had been there I do not know how long, I heard footsteps in the  empty hall, and in a moment a knock at my door. I wiped my eyes, and put  myself into presentable shape as soon as I could, and opened the door. A  lad stood there who said: 'A man wants to see you at the front door.'  Down the stairs I went, wondering who could want me and what he could  want me for. In the front yard was a man on a restless horse, who at  once said: 'We want you to teach our school for a month. The boys have  driven out the female teacher. We want you to take them in hand, and  we'll give you fifteen dollars and your board.' I said, 'All right, I'll  be down there to-morrow morning.' And then I went back to my room to  thank God for hearing my prayer.\"      \"I CAN'T STOP TO PRAY.\"      \"A deacon living in a Berkshire town was requested to give his prayers  in behalf of a poor man with a large family who had broken his leg. 'I  can't stop now to pray,' said the deacon (who was picking and barreling  his early apples for the city market), 'but you can go down into the  cellar and get some corned beef, salt pork, potatoes, and butter--that's  the best I can do.'\"      REMARKABLE HEALING OF A CHILD.      A clergyman writes that during the ministration of his labors at Battle  Greek, Mich., there were several remarkable manifestations of divine  power--especially in the case of a little girl, the daughter of a Mr.  Smith, a child of about six years.    \"In September last, she was taken very sick with spinal fever. She  became much reduced, extremely nervous and helpless, excepting to move  her hands. Physicians gave up the case as a hopeless one, deciding that  should she live, her condition would be that of helplessness, a burden  to herself and to her parents.    \"But our gracious God had better things in store for that afflicted  family. It was on a Sabbath afternoon, at the very hour when the crowded  congregation in our house of worship were in prayer for the influences  of the divine Spirit, that a holy, solemn influence came into the  dwelling of Brother Smith, as if an angel had come to touch the child  with healing power. The mother could not leave the bedside of her  suffering child to attend the meeting, and she says that a sudden change  came over her feelings, and it appeared to her that an angel had come  into the house, and had shed a holy influence in every part of it. It  was at that moment that the hitherto helpless child drew herself up in a  sitting posture, and next rose upon her feet. She rapidly recovered to  her usual habits of taking food and sleeping, and now takes the exercise  of the most robust children of her age.\"      GOD PAID THE RENT.--ANSWER TO PRAYER.      A poor Christian family were in distress. The husband, during a long and  painful sickness, had borne his trials for months with cheerful  Christian resignation; \"but, on this day,\" said a City Missionary, \"I  found them, for the first time, in tears. The cause I soon learned was  the want of means to pay the rent of their little home, which would come  due on the following Monday, and must be paid then, or they would have  to leave and go they knew not where. The amount needed, _fifteen  dollars_, and the amount in hand but _fifty cents;_ the future all dark,  and no hope of recovery from sickness, and no hope of being able to meet  their expenses--it might be of a long sickness and want--what could I do  for them? If theirs had been the only case of like wants that day, I no  doubt could have gone to a few friends and have collected the amount.  But that would not do them the good I felt they needed. But I felt sure  of a better way to get it, and lead them to trust in the Lord, and  glorify God and not man.    \"On the wall, at the foot of the sick man's bed, I had hung, but a short  time previous, one of those precious silent comforters, a scroll of  Scripture texts, printed in large type, and a different prayer for every  day in the month. On the page before us for _that day_, after calling  their attention to it, I read the following words: '_And all things  whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye shall receive_.' Matt.  21:22. 'Again I say unto you, _that if two of you shall agree on earth  as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them_.  Matt. 18:9; remarking, 'Are not those precious promises? Your fears,  dear brother and sister, are that you will not be able to pay the rent  on Monday, and may be turned out into the street, unless you get the  means to pay the rent; are they not?' 'That is so,' said they. 'There  are two ways: one, to try to get some one to lend you the amount until  you can pay, if the landlord will not wait; another, to go and beg for  it.' I have learned a better way, and wish I could lead you to do the  same. Do as David did. Have you ever gone to the Lord as directed above,  and found in Him, as David did, a very present help in time of trouble?  Would not your faith and confidence in God's word and in his kind,  overruling providence be more strengthened, if, in going to Him now and  making known your present troubles and wants, He should in a way,  without your making known your wants to any other person, on Monday  enable you to pay all?' The answer was, 'We should.'    \"After prayer and encouragement to do so, I left them, with the promise  to call the following Tuesday. Doing so, I was met at the door by the  wife with a countenance full of joy. '_Oh, brother, we could not wait  until you came, to tell you the wonderful answer to our prayer_. On  Monday, _the very day_ that we had to pay the rent, one gentleman came  and handed my husband _five dollars_, and early in the morning Mrs.  F---- called and handed me _ten dollars_, making in all _just fifteen  dollars_, the amount we needed; was it not wonderful? Oh, how good the  Lord is!' The same week another called and gave them an order for fifty  dollars more, so that they were able to pay up all their debts, and the  sudden joy soon led to a speedy restoration to health, and the husband  is now one of the most active Christian workers and teachers in a  mission school, and the wife and daughter are also trying to do all they  can to lead others to trust in Jesus.\"      HE FORGETTETH NOT THE CRY OF THE HUMBLE.      A City home missionary has told us of the case of a poor colored family,  the husband nearly one hundred years old, totally incapacitated for  work, and confined to his room by sickness nearly twelve years.    Although very often in straitened circumstances, the Lord has never left  them to want for any good they needed, having, in a truly wonderful  manner supplied their wants, in answer to prayer. The wife, having for a  long time been kept from the enjoyment of church privileges by close  confinement, she had been sorely tempted to doubt her acceptance in  Christ, and was in great darkness for days; but one day, in reading the  following words, found in the fifteenth chapter of John, _\"If ye abide  in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall  be done unto you,\"_ she was led to go to God in prayer, and to ask, if  not wrong in his sight, to grant her a request, that she might know that  her prayer was answered, and that she was abiding in Him. The request  was that, as they were in trouble for the rent coming due the next day,  and still in need of _three dollars,_ that the Lord would send them a  friend in a stranger, some one that they had never seen before, and that  he would put it into the heart of that stranger to give them three  dollars, and then they would not be tempted to believe, as they had  sometimes before, that it would have been sent by a friend even if they  had not prayed.    \"But,\" said she, \"I knows if a stranger comes, none but the Lord could  send, then I would know the Lord heard my prayer, and I was truly the  Lord's. So I watch for the answer for you knows, brother, when we prays,  the Lord says we must believe we shall receive what we ask of Him, and  then He will give"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11565"],[0,"Friends, though divided: A Tale of the Civil War (#11)"],[1,"by Harry. The merchant led him into a sitting-room  on the floor above, where his wife, a comely dame, was occupied with her  needle.    \"Dame,\" he said, \"this is a new apprentice whom my nurse, Marjory, has  sent me. A promising-looking youth, is he not?\"    His wife looked at him in surprise.    \"I have never heard thee speak of thy nurse, Nicholas, and surely the  lad looks not apt to learning the mysteries of a trade like thine.\"    The merchant smiled gravely.    \"He must be more apt than he looks, dame, or he would never have been  chosen for the service upon which he is engaged. Men do not send fools  to risk their lives; and I have been watching him for the last hour, and  have observed how he bore himself under the tricks of that jackanapes,  Jacob, and verily the wonder which I at first felt when he presented  himself to me has passed away, and what appeared to me at first sight a  strange imprudence, seems now to be a piece of wisdom. But enough of  riddles,\" he said, seeing that his wife's astonishment increased as he  went on. \"This lad is a messenger from Oxford, and bears, I doubt not,  important documents. What is thy true name, boy?\"    \"I am Harry Furness, the son of Sir Henry Furness, one of the king's  officers,\" Harry said; \"and my papers are concealed within this staff.\"    Thereupon he lifted his stick and showed that at the bottom a piece of  wood had been artfully fitted into a hollow, and then, by being rubbed  upon the ground, so worn as to appear part of a solid whole. Taking his  knife from his pocket, he cut off an inch from the lower end of the  stick, and then shook out on to the table a number of slips of paper  tightly rolled together.    \"I will examine these at my leisure,\" the merchant said; \"and now as to  thyself. What instructions have you?\"    \"I am told, sir, to take up my abode with you, if it so pleases you; to  assume the garb and habits of an apprentice; and, moreover, to do such  messages as you may give me, and which, perhaps, I may perform with less  risk of observation, and with more fidelity than any ordinary  messenger.\"    \"The proposal is a good one,\" the trader said. \"I am often puzzled how  to send notes to those of my neighbors with whom I am in  correspondence, for the lad Jacob is sharp--too sharp, indeed, for my  purpose, and might suspect the purport of his goings and comings. I  believe him to be faithful, though overapt to mischief. But in these  days one cares not to risk one's neck unless on a surety. The first  thing will be, then, to procure for thee a suit of clothes, suitable to  thy new position. Under the plea that at present work is but slack--for  indeed the troubles of the times have well-nigh ruined the trade in such  goods as mine, throwing it all into the hands of the smiths--I shall be  able to grant thee some license, and to allow thee to go about and see  the city and acquaint thyself with its ways. Master Jacob may feel,  perhaps, a little jealous; but this matters not. I somewhat misdoubt the  boy, though perhaps unjustly. But I know not how his opinions may go  toward matters politic. He believes me, I think, as do other men, to be  attached to the present state of things; but even did his thoughts jump  otherwise, he would not have opened his lips before me. It would be  well, therefore, for you to be cautious in the extreme with him, and to  find out of a verity what be his nature and disposition. Doubtless, in  time, he will unbosom to you and you may see whether he has any  suspicions, and how far he is to be trusted. He was recommended to me  by a friend at Poole, and I know not the opinions of his people. I will  come forth with you now and order the clothes without delay, and we will  return in time for dinner, which will be at twelve, of which time it now  lacks half an hour.\"    Putting on his high hat, the merchant sallied out with Harry into the  Cheap, and going to a clothier's was able to purchase ready-made  garments suitable to his new position as a 'prentice boy. Returning with  these, he bade the lad mount to the room which he was to share Jacob,  to change with all speed, and to come down to dinner, which was now  nearly ready.    The meal was to Harry a curious one. The merchant sat at one end of the  table, his wife at the other. The scrivener occupied a place on one  side, and his fellow-apprentice and himself on the other. The merchant  spoke to his wife on the troubles of the times in a grave, oracular  voice, which appeared to be intended chiefly for the edification of his  three assistants, who ate their dinner in silence, only saying a word or  two in answer to any question addressed to them. Harry, who was  accustomed to dine with his father, was somewhat nice in his ways of  eating. But, observing a sudden look of interest and suspicion upon the  face of the sharp boy beside him at his manner of eating, he, without  making so sudden a change as to be perceptible, gradually fell into the  way of eating of his companion, mentally blaming himself severely for  having for a moment forgotten his assumed part.    \"I shall not need you this afternoon, Roger,\" the merchant said; \"and  you can go out and view the sights of the city. Avoid getting into any  quarrels or broils, and especially observe the names writ up on the  corner of the houses, in order that you may learn the streets and so be  able to find your way about should I send you with messages or goods.\"    Harry spent the afternoon as directed, and was mightily amused and  entertained by the sights which he witnessed. Especially was he  interested in London Bridge, which, covered closely with houses,  stretched across the river, and at the great fleet of vessels which lay  moored to the wharves below. Here Harry spent the greater portion of the  afternoon, watching the numerous boats as they shot the bridge, and the  barges receiving merchandise from the vessels.    At five o'clock the shop was shut, and at six supper was served in the  same order as dinner had been. At eight they retired to bed.    \"Well, Master Roger,\" said Jacob, when they were done, \"and what is thy  father?\"    \"He farms a piece of land of his own,\" Harry said. \"Sometimes I live  with him; but more often with my uncle, who is a trader in Bristol--a  man of some wealth, and much respected by the citizens.\"    \"Ah! it is there that thou hast learnt thy tricks of eating,\" Jacob  said. \"I wondered to see thee handle thy knife and fork so daintily, and  in a manner which assuredly smacked of the city rather than of the  farm.\"    \"My uncle,\" Harry said, \"is a particular man as to his habits, and as  many leading citizens of the town often take their meals at his house,  he was ever worrying me to behave, as he said, more like a Christian  than a hog. What a town is this London! What heaps of people, and what  wonderful sights!\"    \"Yes,\" the apprentice said carelessly. \"But you have as yet seen  nothing. You should see the giant with eight heads, at the Guildhall.\"    \"A giant with eight heads?\" Henry exclaimed wonderingly. \"Why, he have  five more than the giant whom my mother told me of when I was little,  that was killed by Jack, the Giant Killer. I must go and see him of a  surety.'\"    \"You must mind,\" the apprentice said; \"for a boy is served up for him  every morning for breakfast.\"    \"Now you are trying to fool me,\" Harry said. \"My mother warned me that  the boys of London were wickedly disposed, and given to mock at  strangers. But I tell thee, Master Jacob, that I have a heavy fist, and  was considered a fighter in the village. Therefore, mind how thou triest  to fool me. Mother always said I was not such a fool as I looked.\"    \"You may well be that,\" Jacob said, \"and yet a very big fool. But at  present I do not know whether your folly is more than skin deep, and  methinks that the respectable trader, your uncle, has taught you more  than how to eat like a Christian.\"    Harry felt at once that in this sharp boy he had a critic far more  dangerous than any he was likely to meet elsewhere. Others would pass  him unnoticed; but his fellow-apprentice would criticise every act and  word, and he felt somewhat disquieted to find that he had fallen under  such supervision. It was now, he felt, all-important for him to discover  what were the real sentiments of the boy, and whether he was trustworthy  to his master, and to be relied upon to keep the secret which had fallen  into his possession.    \"I have been,\" he said, \"in the big church at the end of this street.  What a pother the preachers do surely keep up there. I should be sorely  worried to hear them long, and would rather thrash out a load of corn  than listen long to the clacking of their tongues.\"    \"Thou wilt be sicker still of them before thou hast done with them. It  is one of the duties of us apprentices to listen to the teachers, and if  I had my way, we would have an apprentices' riot, and demand to be kept  to the terms of our indentures, which say nothing about preachers. What  is the way of thinking of this uncle of yours?\"    \"He is a prudent man,\" Roger said, \"and says but little. For myself, I  care nothing either way, and cannot understand what they are making this  pother about. So far as I can see, folks only want to be quiet, and do  their work. But even in our village at home there is no quiet now. Some  are one way, some t'other. There are the Church folk, and the  meeting-house folk, and it is as much as they can do to keep themselves  from going at each other's throats. I hear so much about it that my  brain gets stupid with it all, and I hate Parliament and king worse than  the schoolmaster who used to whack me for never knowing the difference  between one letter and another.\"    \"But you can read and write, I suppose?\" Jacob said; \"or you would be of  little use as an apprentice.\"    \"Yes, I can read and write,\" Roger said; \"but I cannot say that I love  these things. I doubt me that"]]]
