Cut through the center, then cut slices from the  center toward the ends. The two cut surfaces can be placed  together, thus excluding the air and keeping the bread fresh as  long as there is any left to slice.  --Contributed by L. Alberta Norrell, Augusta, Ga.        ** How to Make an Electric Toaster [37]    The electric toaster shown in the sketch is not hard to make. The  framework comprising the base and the two uprights may be made  either of hardwood or asbestos board, says Popular Electricity. If  constructed of the former, the portion of the base under the coil,  and the inside surfaces of the two uprights should be covered with  a 1/8-in. sheet of well made asbestos paper, or thin asbestos  board may be substituted for this lining. Asbestos board is to be  preferred, and this material in almost any degree of hardness may  be purchased. It can be worked into shape and will hold wood  screws. The detail drawing gives all dimensions necessary to shape  the wood or asbestos board.    After preparing the base and uprights, drill 15 holes, 1/4 in.  deep, into the inside face of each upright to support the No. 6  gauge wires shown. The wires at the top and bottom for holding the  resistance wire are covered with asbestos paper and the holes for  these wires are 3/4 in. from the top and bottom, respectively, of  the uprights. The wires that form the cage about the heater coil  and are used for a support for the toast are 15 pieces of No. 6  gauge iron wire each 8 in. long. The screws that hold the uprights  in position should have the heads countersunk on the under side of  the base. The binding-posts should now be set in position and  their protecting covering    [Illustration: Detail of Toaster]    containing the reinforced cord left until the other parts are  finished.    To assemble, secure one upright in position using 1-1/2 in.  wood-screws. Place the other upright where it belongs without  fastening it and put the stretcher wires for holding the  resistance wire in place. Put the asbestos paper on these and with  the assistance of a helper begin winding on the heater coil.    [Illustration: Toaster Complete]    Use 80 ft. of 18-per-cent No. 22 gauge German-silver wire. Wind  the successive turns of wire so they will not touch each other and  fasten at each end with a turn or two of No. 16 gauge copper wire.  When this is complete have the helper hold the stretcher wires  while you tip the unfastened upright out and insert the wires of  the cage, then fasten the upright in place.    The wire from the binding-posts to the coil may be what is known  underwriters' wire or asbestos-covered wire No. 14 gauge, which is  held in place by double-headed tacks containing an insulation at  the head. These may be procured from electrical supply houses.  Connect the reinforced cord and terminals to the binding screws  and fasten the cover in place. This toaster will take four amperes  on 110-volt circuit.        ** Cabinet for the Amateur's Workshop [37]    One of the most convenient adjuncts to an amateur's workbench is a  cabinet of some sort in which to keep nails, rivets, screws, etc.,  instead of leaving them scattered all about the bench. A very  easily made cabinet for this purpose is shown in the accompanying  illustration. The case may be made of 1/2-in. white pine or white  wood of a suitable size to hold the required number of drawers  which slide on strips of the same material, cut and dressed 1/2  in. square. The drawers are made of empty cigar boxes of uniform  size,    [Illustration: Empty Cigar Boxes Used for Drawers]    which, if one is not a smoker, may be readily obtained from any  cigar dealer, as they are usually thrown away when empty.    Small knobs may be added if desired, but these are not necessary,  as the spaces shown between the drawers give ample room to grasp  them with the fingers. Labels of some kind are needed, and one of  the neatest things for this purpose is the embossed aluminum  label, such as is stamped by the well known penny-in-the-slot  machines to be found in many railroad stations and amusement  places.  --Contributed by Frederick E.

Immerse for 5  minutes in a bath made by adding 14 oz. of glycerine to 16 oz. of  water,        ** Soldering for the Amateur [38]    Successful soldering will present no serious difficulties to  anyone who will follow a few simple directions. Certain metals are  easier to join with solder than others and some cannot be soldered  at all. Copper, brass, zinc, tin, lead, galvanized iron, gold and  silver or any combination of these metals can be easily soldered,  while iron and aluminum are common metals that cannot be soldered.    It is necessary to possess a soldering copper, a piece of solder,  tinner's acid, sandpaper or steel wool, a small file and a piece  of sal ammoniac. If the soldering copper is an old one, or has  become corroded, it must be ground or filed to a point. Heat it  until hot (not red hot), melt a little solder on the sal ammoniac,  and rub the point of the copper on it, turning the copper over to  thoroughly tin the point on each face. This process is known as  tinning the iron and is very necessary to successful work.    After the copper is tinned you may place it in the fire again,  being careful about the heat, as too hot an iron will burn off the  tinning.    The parts to be soldered must be thoroughly cleaned by  sandpapering or the use of steel wool until the metal shows up  bright. Then apply the acid only to the parts to be soldered with  a small stiff brush or a small piece of cloth fastened to a stick,  or in a bent piece of tin to form a swab.    Tinner's acid is made by putting as much zinc in commercial  muriatic acid as will dissolve. This process is best accomplished  in an open earthenware dish. After the acid has ceased to boil and  becomes cool it may be poured into a wide-mouthed bottle which has  a good top or stopper, and labeled \"Poison.\"    Place the parts to be soldered in their correct position and apply  the hot copper to the solder, then to the joint to be soldered,  following around with the copper and applying solder as is  necessary. In joining large pieces it is best to \"stick\" them  together in several places to hold the work before trying to get  all around them. A little practice will soon teach the requisite  amount of solder and the smoothness required for a good job.    In soldering galvanized iron, the pure muriatic acid should be  used, particularly so when the iron has once been used. --C. G.

The washboard can be kept in place with small metal hooks, as  shown in the sketch. Two of these are fastened to the back of    [Illustration: Clip on the Washboard]    the washboard in the right place to keep it at the proper slant.  --Contributed by W. A. Jaquythe, Richmond, California.        ** A Mission Bracket Shelf  [39]    The shelf consists of six pieces of wood A, B, C, D, E and F. The  material can be of any wood. I have one made of mahogany finished  in natural color, and one made of poplar finished black. The  dimensions given in the detail drawings are sufficient for anyone  to make this bracket. The amount of material required is very  small and can be made from scrap, or purchased from a mill  surfaced and sanded. The parts are put together with dowel pins.  --Contributed by A.

[Illustration: Details of the Wall Bracket]        ** How to Make a Finger Ring [39]    While the wearing of copper rings for rheumatism may be a foolish  notion, yet there is a certain galvanic action    [Illustration: Tools for Forming the Ring]    set up by the contact of the acid in the system of the afflicted  person with the metal of the ring. Apart from this, however, a  ring may be made from any metal, such as copper, brass and silver,  if such metals are in plate or sheet form, by the following  method:    All the tools necessary are a die and punch which are simple to  make and will form a ring that will fit the average finger. Take a  3/4-in. nut, B, Fig. 1, and drill out the threads. This will leave  a clear hole, 7/8 in. in diameter, or a hole drilled the desired  size in a piece of iron plate will do as well. Countersink the top  of the hole so that the full diameter of the countersink will be  1-1/4 in. This completes the die. The punch A, is made of a piece  of 5/8 in. round iron, slightly rounded on the end so that it will  not cut through the metal disk. The dimensions shown in Fig. 1 can  be changed to suit the size of the finger to be fitted.    The metal used should be about 1/16 in. thick and 1-1/4 in. in  diameter. Anneal it properly by heating and plunging in water. Lay  it on the die so that it will fit nicely in the countersink and  drive it through the hole by striking the punch with a hammer.  Hold the punch as nearly central as possible when starting to  drive the metal through the hole. The disk will come out pan  shaped, C, and it is only necessary to remove the bottom of the  pan to have a band which will leave a hole 5/8 in. in diameter and  1-1/4 in. wide. Place the band, D, Fig. 2, on a stick so that the  edges can be filed and rounded to shape. Finish with fine emery  cloth and polish. Brass rings can be plated when finished.  --Contributed by H. W.

It was now expressly enacted that the Roman Catholic inhabitants of  Canada should thenceforth \"enjoy the free exercise\" of their religion,  \"subject to the king's supremacy declared and established\" by law, and  on condition of taking an oath of allegiance, set forth in the act. The  Roman Catholic clergy were allowed \"to hold, receive, and enjoy their  accustomed dues and rights, with respect to such persons only as shall  confess the said religion\"--that is, one twenty-sixth part of the  produce of the land, Protestants being specially exempted. The French  Canadians were allowed to enjoy all their property, together with all  customs and usages incident thereto, \"in as large, ample and beneficial  manner,\" as if the proclamation or other acts of the crown \"had not been  made\", but the religious orders and communities were excepted in  accordance with the terms of the capitulation of Montreal--the effect of  which exception I have already briefly stated. In \"all matters of  controversy relative to property and civil rights,\" resort was to be had  to the old civil law of French Canada \"as the rule for the decision of  the same\", but the criminal law of England was extended to the province  on the indisputable ground that its \"certainty and lenity\" were already  \"sensibly felt by the inhabitants from an experience of more than nine  years.\" The government of the province was entrusted to a governor and a  legislative council appointed by the crown, \"inasmuch as it was  inexpedient to call an assembly.\" The council was to be composed of not  more than twenty-three residents of the province. At the same time the  British parliament made special enactments for the imposition of certain  customs duties \"towards defraying the charges of the administration of  justice and the support of the civil government of the province.\" All  deficiencies in the revenues derived from these and other sources had to  be supplied by the imperial treasury. During the passage of the act  through parliament, it evoked the bitter hostility of Lord Chatham, who  was then the self-constituted champion of the old colonies, who found  the act most objectionable, not only because it established the Roman  Catholic religion, but placed under the government of Quebec the rich  territory west of the Alleghanies. Similar views were expressed by the  Mayor and Council of London, but they had no effect. The king, in giving  his assent, declared that the measure \"was founded on the clearest  principles of justice and humanity, and would have the best effect in  quieting the minds and promoting the happiness of our Canadian  subjects.\" In French Canada the act was received without any popular  demonstration by the French Canadians, but the men to whom the great  body of that people always looked for advice and guidance--the priests,  cures, and seigniors--naturally regarded these concessions to their  nationality as giving most unquestionable evidence of the considerate  and liberal spirit in which the British government was determined to  rule the province. They had had ever since the conquest satisfactory  proof that their religion was secure from all interference, and now the  British parliament itself came forward with legal guarantees, not only  for the free exercise of that religion, with all its incidents and  tithes, but also for the permanent establishment of the civil law to  which they attached so much importance. The fact that no provision was  made for a popular assembly could not possibly offend a people to whom  local self-government in any form was entirely unknown. It was  impossible to constitute an assembly from the few hundred Protestants  who were living in Montreal and Quebec, and it was equally impossible,  in view of the religious prejudices dominant in England and the English  colonies, to give eighty thousand French Canadian Roman Catholics  privileges which their co-religionists did not enjoy in Great Britain  and to allow them to sit in an elected assembly. Lord North seemed to  voice the general opinion of the British parliament on this difficult  subject, when he closed the debate with an expression of \"the earnest  hope that the Canadians will, in the course of time, enjoy as much of  our laws and as much of our constitution as may be beneficial to that  country and safe for this\", but \"that time,\" he concluded, \"had not yet  come.\" It does not appear from the evidence before us that the British  had any other motive in passing the Quebec Act than to do justice to  the French Canadian people, now subjects of the crown of England. It was  not a measure primarily intended to check the growth of popular  institutions, but solely framed to meet the actual conditions of a  people entirely unaccustomed to the working of representative or popular  institutions. It was a preliminary step in the development of  self-government.    On the other hand the act was received with loud expressions of  dissatisfaction by the small English minority who had hoped to see  themselves paramount in the government of the province. In Montreal, the  headquarters of the disaffected, an attempt was made to set fire to the  town, and the king's bust was set up in one of the public squares,  daubed with black, and decorated with a necklace made of potatoes, and  bearing the inscription _Voila le pape du Canada & le sot Anglais_. The  author of this outrage was never discovered, and all the influential  French Canadian inhabitants of the community were deeply incensed that  their language should have been used to insult a king whose only offence  was his assent to a measure of justice to themselves.    Sir Guy Carleton, who had been absent in England for four years,  returned to Canada on the 18th September, 1774, and was well received in  Quebec. The first legislative council under the Quebec Act was not  appointed until the beginning of August, 1775. Of the twenty-two members  who composed it, eight were influential French Canadians bearing  historic names. The council met on the 17th August, but was forced to  adjourn on the 7th September, on account of the invasion of Canada by  the troops of the Continental Congress, composed of representatives of  the rebellious element of the Thirteen Colonies. In a later chapter I  shall very shortly review the effects of the American revolution upon  the people of Canada; but before I proceed to do so it is necessary to  take my readers first to Nova Scotia on the eastern seaboard of British  North America and give a brief summary of its political development  from the beginning of British rule.      SECTION 2.--The foundation of Nova Scotia (1749--1783).    The foundation of Halifax practically put an end to the Acadian period  of Nova Scotian settlement. Until that time the English occupation of  the country was merely nominal. Owing largely to the representations of  Governor Shirley, of Massachusetts--a statesman of considerable ability,  who distinguished himself in American affairs during a most critical  period of colonial history--the British government decided at last on a  vigorous policy in the province, which seemed more than once on the  point of passing out of their hands. Halifax was founded by the  Honourable Edward Cornwallis on the slope of a hill, whose woods then  dipped their branches into the very waters of the noble harbour long  known as Chebuctou, and renamed in honour of a distinguished member of  the Montague family, who had in those days full control of the  administration of colonial affairs.    Colonel Cornwallis, a son of the Baron of that name--a man of firmness  and discretion--entered the harbour, on the 21st of June, old style, or  2nd July present style, and soon afterwards assumed his, duties as  governor of the province. The members of his first council were sworn in  on board one of the transports in the harbour. Between 2000 and 3000  persons were brought at this time to settle the town and country. These  people were chiefly made up of retired military and naval officers,  soldiers and sailors, gentlemen, mechanics, farmers--far too few--and  some Swiss, who were extremely industrious and useful. On the whole,  they were not the best colonists to build up a prosperous industrial  community. The government gave the settlers large inducements in the  shape of free grants of land, and practically supported them for the  first two or three years. It was not until the Acadian population were  removed, and their lands were available, that the foundation of the  agricultural prosperity of the peninsula was really laid. In the summer  of 1753 a considerable number of Germans were placed in the present  county of Lunenburg, where their descendants still prosper, and take a  most active part in all the occupations of life.    With the disappearance of the French Acadian settlers Nova Scotia became  a British colony in the full sense of the phrase. The settlement of 1749  was supplemented in 1760, and subsequent years, by a valuable and large  addition of people who were induced to leave Massachusetts and other  colonies of New England and settle in townships of the present counties  of Annapolis, King's, Hants, Queen's, Yarmouth, Cumberland, and  Colchester, especially in the beautiful townships of Cornwallis and  Horton, where the Acadian meadows were the richest. A small number also  settled at Maugerville and other places on the St. John River.    During the few years that had elapsed since the Acadians were driven  from their lands, the sea had once more found its way through the ruined  dykes, which had no longer the skilful attention of their old builders.  The new owners of the Acadian lands had none of the special knowledge  that the French had acquired, and were unable for years to keep back the  ever-encroaching tides. Still there were some rich uplands"]]]
