Perhaps the Lion  wouldn't fall off.\"    \"You may try it if you like,\" said the Woozy to the Lion.  \"I can take  you to the city in a jiffy and then come back for Hank.\"    \"I'm--I'm afraid,\" said the Cowardly Lion.  He was twice as big as the  Woozy.    \"Try it,\" pleaded Dorothy.    \"And take a tumble among the thistles?\" asked the Lion reproachfully.    But when the Woozy came close to him, the big beast suddenly bounded  upon its back and managed to balance himself there, although forced to  hold his four legs so close together that he was in danger of toppling  over.  The great weight of the monster Lion did not seem to affect the  Woozy, who called to his rider, \"Hold on tight!\" and ran swiftly over  the thistles toward the city.    The others stood on the blanket and watched the strange sight  anxiously.  Of course, the Lion couldn't \"hold on tight\" because there  was nothing to hold to, and he swayed from side to side as if likely to  fall off any moment.  Still, he managed to stick to the Woozy's back  until they were close to the walls of the city, when he leaped to the  ground.  Next moment the Woozy came dashing back at full speed.    \"There's a little strip of ground next the wall where there are no  thistles,\" he told them when he had reached the adventurers once more.  \"Now then, friend Hank, see if you can ride as well as the Lion did.\"    \"Take the others first,\" proposed the Mule.  So the Sawhorse and the  Woozy made a couple of trips over the thistles to the city walls and  carried all the people in safety, Dorothy holding little Toto in her  arms.  The travelers then sat in a group on a little hillock just  outside the wall and looked at the great blocks of gray stone and  waited for the Woozy to bring Hank to them.  The Mule was very awkward,  and his legs trembled so badly that more than once they thought he  would tumble off, but finally he reached them in safety, and the entire  party was now reunited.  More than that, they had reached the city that  had eluded them for so long and in so strange a manner.    \"The gates must be around the other side,\" said the Wizard.  \"Let us  follow the curve of the wall until we reach an opening in it.\"    \"Which way?\" asked Dorothy.    \"We must guess that,\" he replied.  \"Suppose we go to the left.  One  direction is as good as another.\"  They formed in marching order and  went around the city wall to the left.  It wasn't a big city, as I have  said, but to go way around it outside the high wall was quite a walk,  as they became aware.  But around it our adventurers went without  finding any sign of a gateway or other opening.  When they had returned  to the little mound from which they had started, they dismounted from  the animals and again seated themselves on the grassy mound.    \"It's mighty queer, isn't it?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"There must be SOME way for the people to get out and in,\" declared  Dorothy.  \"Do you s'pose they have flying machines, Wizard?\"    \"No,\" he replied, \"for in that case they would be flying all over the  Land of Oz, and we know they have not done that.  Flying machines are  unknown here.  I think it more likely that the people use ladders to  get over the walls.\"    \"It would be an awful climb over that high stone wall,\" said Betsy.    \"Stone, is it?\" Scraps, who was again dancing wildly around, for she  never tired and could never keep still for long.    \"Course it's stone,\" answered Betsy scornfully.  \"Can't you see?\"    \"Yes,\" said Scraps, going closer.  \"I can SEE the wall, but I can't  FEEL it.\"  And then, with her arms outstretched, she did a very queer  thing.  She walked right into the wall and disappeared.    \"For goodness sake!\" Dorothy, amazed, as indeed they all were.          CHAPTER 9    THE HIGH COCO-LORUM OF THI      And now the Patchwork Girl came dancing out of the wall again.    \"Come on!\" she called.   \"It isn't there.  There isn't any wall at all.\"    \"What?  No wall?\" exclaimed the Wizard.    \"Nothing like it,\" said Scraps.  \"It's a make-believe.  You see it, but  it isn't.  Come on into the city; we've been wasting our time.\"    With this, she danced into the wall again and once more disappeared.  Button-Bright, who was rather venture-some, dashed away after her and  also became invisible to them.  The others followed more cautiously,  stretching out their hands to feel the wall and finding, to their  astonishment, that they could feel nothing because nothing opposed  them.  They walked on a few steps and found themselves in the streets  of a very beautiful city.  Behind them they again saw the wall, grim  and forbidding as ever, but now they knew it was merely an illusion  prepared to keep strangers from entering the city.    But the wall was soon forgotten, for in front of them were a number of  quaint people who stared at them in amazement as if wondering where  they had come from.  Our friends forgot their good manners for a time  and returned the stares with interest, for so remarkable a people had  never before been discovered in all the remarkable Land of Oz.    Their heads were shaped like diamonds, and their bodies like hearts.  All the hair they had was a little bunch at the tip top of their  diamond-shaped heads, and their eyes were very large and round, and  their noses and mouths very small.  Their clothing was tight fitting  and of brilliant colors, being handsomely embroidered in quaint designs  with gold or silver threads; but on their feet they wore sandals with  no stockings whatever.  The expression of their faces was pleasant  enough, although they now showed surprise at the appearance of  strangers so unlike themselves, and our friends thought they seemed  quite harmless.    \"I beg your pardon,\" said the Wizard, speaking for his party, \"for  intruding upon you uninvited, but we are traveling on important  business and find it necessary to visit your city.  Will you kindly  tell us by what name your city is called?\"    They looked at one another uncertainly, each expecting some other to  answer.  Finally, a short one whose heart-shaped body was very broad  replied, \"We have no occasion to call our city anything.  It is where  we live, that is all.\"    \"But by what name do others call your city?\" asked the Wizard.    \"We know of no others except yourselves,\" said the man.  And then he  inquired, \"Were you born with those queer forms you have, or has some  cruel magician transformed you to them from your natural shapes?\"    \"These are our natural shapes,\" declared the Wizard, \"and we consider  them very good shapes, too.\"    The group of inhabitants was constantly being enlarged by others who  joined it.  All were evidently startled and uneasy at the arrival of  strangers.    \"Have you a King?\" asked Dorothy, who knew it was better to speak with  someone in authority.    But the man shook his diamond-like head.  \"What is a King?\" he asked.    \"Isn't there anyone who rules over you?\" inquired the Wizard.    \"No,\" was the reply, \"each of us rules himself, or at least tries to do  so.  It is not an easy thing to do, as you probably know.\"    The Wizard reflected.    \"If you have disputes among you,\" said he after a little thought, \"who  settles them?\"    \"The High Coco-Lorum,\" they answered in a chorus.    \"And who is he?\"    \"The judge who enforces the laws,\" said the man who had first spoken.    \"Then he is the principal person here?\" continued the Wizard.    \"Well, I would not say that,\" returned the man in a puzzled way.  \"The  High Coco-Lorum is a public servant.  However, he represents the laws,  which we must all obey.\"    \"I think,\" said the Wizard, \"we ought to see your High Coco-Lorum and  talk with him.  Our mission here requires us to consult one high in  authority, and the High Coco-Lorum ought to be high, whatever else he  is.\"    The inhabitants seemed to consider this proposition reasonable, for  they nodded their diamond-shaped heads in approval.  So the broad one  who had been their spokesman said, \"Follow me,\" and turning led the way  along one of the streets.  The entire party followed him, the natives  falling in behind.  The dwellings they passed were quite nicely planned  and seemed comfortable and convenient.  After leading them a few  blocks, their conductor stopped before a house which was neither better  nor worse than the others.  The doorway was shaped to admit the  strangely formed bodies of these people, being narrow at the top, broad  in the middle and tapering at the bottom.  The windows were made in  much the same way, giving the house a most peculiar appearance.  When  their guide opened the gate, a music box concealed in the gatepost  began to play, and the sound attracted the attention of the High  Coco-Lorum, who appeared at an open window and inquired, \"What has  happened now?\"    But in the same moment his eyes fell upon the strangers and he hastened  to open the door and admit them--all but the animals, which were left  outside with the throng of natives that had now gathered. For a small  city there seemed to be a large number of inhabitants, but they did not  try to enter the house and contented themselves with staring curiously  at the strange animals.  Toto followed Dorothy.    Our friends entered a large room at the front of the house, where the  High Coco-Lorum asked them to be seated.  \"I hope your mission here is  a peaceful one,\" he said, looking a little worried, \"for the Thists are  not very good fighters and object to being conquered.\"    \"Are your people called Thists?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Yes.   I thought you knew that.  And we call our city Thi.\"    \"Oh!\"    \"We are Thists because we eat thistles, you know,\" continued the High  Coco-Lorum.    \"Do you really eat those prickly things?\" inquired Button-Bright  wonderingly.    \"Why not?\" replied the other.  \"The sharp points of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/960"],[0,"The Tin Woodman of Oz (#10)"],[1," critically. \"I have never seen a pea-green monkey before, and it  strikes me you are quite gorgeous.\"    \"It isn't so bad to be a bird,\" asserted the Canary, fluttering from  one to another with a free and graceful motion, \"but I long to enjoy my  own shape again.\"    \"As Polychrome, you were the loveliest maiden I have ever seen--except,  of course, Ozma,\" said the Tin Owl; \"so the Giantess did well to  transform you into the loveliest of all birds, if you were to be  transformed at all. But tell me, since you are a fairy, and have a  fairy wisdom: do you think we shall be able to break these  enchantments?\"    \"Queer things happen in the Land of Oz,\" replied the Canary, again  perching on the Green Monkey's shoulder and turning one bright eye  thoughtfully toward her questioner. \"Mrs. Yoop has declared that none  of her transformations can ever be changed, even by herself, but I  believe that if we could get to Glinda the Good Sorceress, she might  find a way to restore us to our natural shapes. Glinda, as you know, is  the most powerful Sorceress in the world, and there are few things she  cannot do if she tries.\"    \"In that case,\" said the Little Brown Bear, \"let us return southward  and try to get to Glinda's castle. It lies in the Quadling Country, you  know, so it is a good way from here.\"    \"First, however, let us visit the forest and search for something to  eat,\" pleaded Woot. So they continued on to the edge of the forest,  which consisted of many tall and beautiful trees. They discovered no  fruit trees, at first, so the Green Monkey pushed on into the forest  depths and the others followed close behind him.    They were traveling quietly along, under the shade of the trees, when  suddenly an enormous jaguar leaped upon them from a limb and with one  blow of his paw sent the little Brown Bear tumbling over and over until  he was stopped by a tree-trunk. Instantly they all took alarm. The Tin  Owl shrieked: \"Hoot--hoot!\" and flew straight up to the branch of a  tall tree, although he could scarcely see where he was going. The  Canary swiftly darted to a place beside the Owl, and the Green Monkey  sprang up, caught a limb, and soon scrambled to a high perch of safety.    The Jaguar crouched low and with hungry eyes regarded the little Brown  Bear, which slowly got upon its feet and asked reproachfully:    \"For goodness' sake, Beast, what were you trying to do?\"    \"Trying to get my breakfast,\" answered the Jaguar with a snarl, \"and I  believe I've succeeded. You ought to make a delicious meal--unless you  happen to be old and tough.\"    \"I'm worse than that, considered as a breakfast,\" said the Bear, \"for  I'm only a skin stuffed with straw, and therefore not fit to eat.\"    \"Indeed!\" cried the Jaguar, in a disappointed voice; \"then you must be  a magic Bear, or enchanted, and I must seek my breakfast from among  your companions.\"    With this he raised his lean head to look up at the Tin Owl and the  Canary and the Monkey, and he lashed his tail upon the ground and  growled as fiercely as any jaguar could.    \"My friends are enchanted, also,\" said the little Brown Bear.    \"All of them?\" asked the Jaguar.    \"Yes. The Owl is tin, so you couldn't possibly eat him. The Canary is a  fairy--Polychrome, the Daughter of the Rainbow--and you never could  catch her because she can easily fly out of your reach.\"    \"There still remains the Green Monkey,\" remarked the Jaguar hungrily.  \"He is neither made of tin nor stuffed with straw, nor can he fly. I'm  pretty good at climbing trees, myself, so I think I'll capture the  Monkey and eat him for my breakfast.\"    Woot the Monkey, hearing this speech from his perch on the tree, became  much frightened, for he knew the nature of jaguars and realized they  could climb trees and leap from limb to limb with the agility of cats.  So he at once began to scamper through the forest as fast as he could  go, catching at a branch with his long monkey arms and swinging his  green body through space to grasp another branch in a neighboring tree,  and so on, while the Jaguar followed him from below, his eyes fixed  steadfastly on his prey. But presently Woot got his feet tangled in the  Lace Apron, which he was still wearing, and that tripped him in his  flight and made him fall to the ground, where the Jaguar placed one  huge paw upon him and said grimly:    \"I've got you, now!\"    The fact that the Apron had tripped him made Woot remember its magic  powers, and in his terror he cried out: \"Open!\" without stopping to  consider how this command might save him. But, at the word, the earth  opened at the exact spot where he lay under the Jaguar's paw, and his  body sank downward, the earth closing over it again. The last thing  Woot the Monkey saw, as he glanced upward, was the Jaguar peering into  the hole in astonishment.    \"He's gone!\" cried the beast, with a long-drawn sigh of disappointment;  \"he's gone, and now I shall have no breakfast.\"    The clatter of the Tin Owl's wings sounded above him, and the little  Brown Bear came trotting up and asked:    \"Where is the monkey? Have you eaten him so quickly?\"    \"No, indeed,\" answered the Jaguar. \"He disappeared into the earth  before I could take one bite of him!\"    And now the Canary perched upon a stump, a little way from the forest  beast, and said:    \"I am glad our friend has escaped you; but, as it is natural for a  hungry beast to wish his breakfast, I will try to give you one.\"    \"Thank you,\" replied the Jaguar. \"You're rather small for a full meal,  but it's kind of you to sacrifice yourself to my appetite.\"    \"Oh, I don't intend to be eaten, I assure you,\" said the Canary, \"but  as I am a fairy I know something of magic, and though I am now  transformed into a bird's shape, I am sure I can conjure up a breakfast  that will satisfy you.\"    \"If you can work magic, why don't you break the enchantment you are  under and return to your proper form?\" inquired the beast doubtingly.    \"I haven't the power to do that,\" answered the Canary, \"for Mrs. Yoop,  the Giantess who transformed me, used a peculiar form of yookoohoo  magic that is unknown to me. However, she could not deprive me of my  own fairy knowledge, so I will try to get you a breakfast.\"    \"Do you think a magic breakfast would taste good, or relieve the pangs  of hunger I now suffer?\" asked the Jaguar.    \"I am sure it would. What would you like to eat?\"    \"Give me a couple of fat rabbits,\" said the beast.    \"Rabbits! No, indeed. I'd not allow you to eat the dear little things,\"  declared Polychrome the Canary.    \"Well, three or four squirrels, then,\" pleaded the Jaguar.    \"Do you think me so cruel?\" demanded the Canary, indignantly. \"The  squirrels are my especial friends.\"    \"How about a plump owl?\" asked the beast. \"Not a tin one, you know, but  a real meat owl.\"    \"Neither beast nor bird shall you have,\" said Polychrome in a positive  voice.    \"Give me a fish, then; there's a river a little way off,\" proposed the  Jaguar.    \"No living thing shall be sacrificed to feed you,\" returned the Canary.    \"Then what in the world do you expect me to eat?\" said the Jaguar in a  scornful tone.    \"How  would  mush-and-milk  do?\"  asked  the Canary.    The Jaguar snarled in derision and lashed his tail against the ground  angrily.    \"Give him some scrambled eggs on toast, Poly,\" suggested the Bear  Scarecrow. \"He ought to like that.\"    \"I will,\" responded the Canary, and fluttering her wings she made a  flight of three circles around the stump. Then she flew up to a tree  and the Bear and the Owl and the Jaguar saw that upon the stump had  appeared a great green leaf upon which was a large portion of scrambled  eggs on toast, smoking hot.    \"There!\" said the Bear; \"eat your breakfast, friend Jaguar, and be  content.\"    The Jaguar crept closer to the stump and sniffed the fragrance of the  scrambled eggs. They smelled so good that he tasted them, and they  tasted so good that he ate the strange meal in a hurry, proving he had  been really hungry.    \"I prefer rabbits,\" he muttered, licking his chops, \"but I must admit  the magic breakfast has filled my stomach full, and brought me comfort.  So I'm much obliged for the kindness, little Fairy, and I'll now leave  you in peace.\"    Saying this, he plunged into the thick underbrush and soon disappeared,  although they could hear his great body crashing through the bushes  until he was far distant.    \"That was a good way to get rid of the savage beast, Poly,\" said the  Tin Woodman to the Canary; \"but I'm surprised that you didn't give our  friend Woot a magic breakfast, when you knew he was hungry.\"    \"The reason for that,\" answered Polychrome, \"was that my mind was so  intent on other things that I quite forgot my power to produce food by  magic. But where is the monkey boy?\"    \"Gone!\" said the Scarecrow Bear, solemnly. \"The earth has swallowed him  up.\"          Chapter Nine    The Quarrelsome Dragons      The Green Monkey sank gently into the earth for a little way and then  tumbled swiftly through space, landing on a rocky floor with a thump  that astonished him. Then he sat up, found that no bones were broken,  and gazed around him.    He seemed to be in a big underground cave, which was dimly lighted by  dozens of big round discs that looked like moons. They were not moons,  however, as Woot discovered when he had examined the place more  carefully. They were eyes. The eyes were in the heads of enormous  beasts whose bodies trailed far behind them. Each beast was bigger than  an elephant, and three times as long, and there were a dozen or more of  the creatures scattered here and there about the cavern. On their  bodies were big scales, as round as pie-plates, which were beautifully  tinted in shades of green, purple and orange. On the ends of their long  tails were clusters of jewels. Around the great, moon-like eyes were  circles of diamonds which sparkled in the subdued light that glowed  "]]]
