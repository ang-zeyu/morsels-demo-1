As a matter of fact, in modern man's wild chase after wealth and  pleasure, it is only one person out of every ten thousand who pauses to  regard such causes, unless cornered by some protectionist fanatic, held  fast and coerced to listen.    We are not discussing the animals of the Pleistocene, or the Eocene, or  any period of the far-distant Past. We are dealing with species that  have been ruthlessly, needlessly and wickedly destroyed by man during  our own times; species that, had they been given a fair chance, would be  alive and well to-day.    In reckless waste of blood and treasure, the nineteenth century has much  for which to answer. Wars and pillage, fires, earthquakes and volcanoes  are unhappily unavoidable. Like the poor of holy writ, we have them with  us always. But the destruction of animal life is in a totally different  category from the accidental calamities of life. It is deliberate,  cold-blooded, persistent, and in its final stage, _criminal_! Worst of  all, there is no limit to the devilish persistence of the confirmed  destroyer, this side of the total extinction of species. No polar night  is too cold, no desert inferno is too hot for the man who pursues wild  life for commercial purposes. The rhytina has been exterminated in the  far north, the elephant seals on Kerguelen are being exterminated in the  far south, and midway, in the desert mountains of Lower California a  fine species of mountain sheep is rapidly being shot into oblivion.           *        *        *        *        *    LARGE MAMMALS COMPLETELY EXTERMINATED    THE ARIZONA ELK, (_Cervus merriami_).--Right at our very door, under our  very noses and as it were only yesterday, a well-defined species of  American elk has been totally exterminated. Until recently the mountains  of Arizona and New Mexico were inhabited by a light-colored elk of  smaller size than the Wyoming species, whose antlers possessed on each  side only one brow tine instead of two. The exact history of the  blotting out of that species has not yet been written, but it seems that  its final extinction occurred about 1901. Its extermination was only a  routine incident of the devilish general slaughter of American big game  that by 1900 had wiped out nearly everything killable over a large  portion of the Rocky Mountain region and the Great Plains.    The Arizona elk was exterminated before the separate standing of the  species had been discovered by naturalists, and before even _one_ skin  had been preserved in a museum! In 1902 Mr. E.W. Nelson described the  species from two male skulls, all the material of which he knew. Since  that time, a third male skull, bearing an excellent pair of antlers, has  been discovered by Mr. Ferdinand Kaegebehn, a member of the New York  Zoological Society, and presented to our National Collection of Heads  and Horns. It came from the Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona, in 1884.  The species was first exterminated in the central and northern mountains  of Arizona, probably twenty years ago, and made its last stand in  northwestern New Mexico. Precisely when it became extinct there, its  last abiding place, we do not know, but in time the facts may appear.    THE QUAGGA, (_Equus quagga_).--Before the days of Livingstone,  Gordon-Cumming and Anderson, the grassy plains and half-forested hills  of South Africa were inhabited by great herds of a wild equine species  that in its markings was a sort of connecting link between the striped  zebras and the stripeless wild asses. The quagga resembled a wild ass  with a few zebra stripes around its neck, and no stripes elsewhere.    There is no good reason why a mammal that is not in any one of the  families regularly eaten by man should be classed as a game animal.  White men, outside of the western border of the continent of Europe, do  not eat horses; and by this token there is no reason why a zebra should  be shot as a \"game\" animal, any more than a baboon. A big male baboon is  dangerous; a male zebra is not.    Nevertheless, white men have elected to shoot zebras as game; and under  this curse the unfortunate quagga fell to rise no more. The species was  shot to a speedy death by sportsmen, and by the British and Dutch  farmers of South Africa. It became extinct about 1875, and to-day there  are only 18 specimens in all the museums of the world.    THE BLAUBOK, (_Hippotragus leucophaeus_).--The first of the African  antelopes to become extinct in modern times was a species of large size,  closely related to the roan antelope of to-day, and named by the early  Dutch settlers of Cape Colony the blaubok, which means \"blue-buck.\" It  was snuffed out of existence in the year 1800, so quickly and so  thoroughly that, like the Arizona elk, it very nearly escaped the annals  of natural history. According to the careful investigations of Mr.  Graham Renshaw, there are only eight specimens in existence in all the  museums of Europe. In general terms it may be stated that this species  has been extinct for about a century.    DAVID'S DEER, (_Elaphurus davidianus_).--We enter this species with  those that are totally extinct, because this is true of it so far as its  wild state is concerned. It is a deer nearly as large as the red deer of  Europe, with 3-tined antlers about equal in total length to those of the  red deer. Its most striking differential character is its _long tail_, a  feature that among the deer of the world is quite unique.    Originally this species inhabited \"northern Mongolia\" (China), but in a  wild state it became extinct before its zoological standing became known  to the scientific world. The species was called to the attention of  zoologists by a Roman Catholic missionary, called Father David, and when  finally described it was named in his honor.    At the outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion, in 1900, there were about 200  specimens living in the imperial park of China, a short distance south  of Pekin; but during the rebellion, all of them were killed and eaten,  thus totally exterminating the species from Asia.    Fortunately, previous to that calamity (in 1894), the Duke of Bedford  had by considerable effort and expenditure procured and established in  his matchless park surrounding Woburn Abbey, England, a herd of eighteen  specimens of this rarest of all deer. That nucleus has thriven and  increased, until in 1910 it contained thirty-four head. Owing to the  fact that all the living female specimens of this remarkable species are  concentrated in one spot, and perfectly liable to be wiped out in one  year by riot, war or disease, there is some cause for anxiety. The  writer has gone so far as to suggest the desirability of starting a new  herd of David's deer, at some point far distant from England, as an  insurance measure against the possibility of calamity at Woburn.  Excepting two or three specimens in European zoological gardens that  have been favored by the Duke of Bedford, there are no living specimens  outside of Woburn Park.    [Illustration: SKELETON OF A RHYTINA, OR ARCTIC SEA-COW  In the United States National Museum]    THE RHYTINA, (_Rhytina gigas_).--The most northerly Sirenian that (so  far as we know) ever inhabited the earth, lived on the Commander Islands  in the northern end of Behring Sea, and was exterminated by man, for its  oil and its flesh, about 1768. It was first made known to the world by  Steller, in 1741, and must have become extinct near the beginning of the  nineteenth century.    The rhytina belonged to the same mammalian Order as the manatee of  Florida and South America, and the dugong of Australia. The largest  manatee that Florida has produced, so far as we know, was thirteen feet  long. The rhytina attained a length of between thirty and thirty-five  feet, and a weight of 6,000 pounds or over. The flesh of this animal,  like that of the manatee and dugong, must have been edible, and surely  was prized by the hungry sailors and natives of its time. It is not  strange that such a species was quickly exterminated by man, in the  arctic regions. The wonder is that it ever existed at a latitude so  outrageous for a Sirenian, an animal which by all precedents should  prefer life in temperate or warm waters.    [Illustration: BURCHELL'S ZEBRA, IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM  Now Believed to be Totally Extinct]    BURCHELL'S ZEBRA (_Equus burchelli typicus_).--The foundation type of  what now is the Burchell group of zebras, consisting of four or five  sub-species of the original species of _burchelli_, is an animal  abundantly striped as to its body, neck and head, but with legs that are  almost white and free from stripes. The sub-species have legs that are  striped about half as much as the mountain zebra and the Grevy species.    While there are Chapman zebras and Grant zebras in plenty, and of  Crawshay's not a few, all these are forms that have developed northward  of the range of the parent species, the original _Equus burchelli_. For  half a century in South Africa the latter had been harried and driven  and shot, and now it is gone, forever. Now, the museum people of the  world are hungrily enumerating their mounted specimens, and live ones  cannot be procured with money, because there are none! Already it is  common talk that \"the true Burchell zebra is extinct;\" and unfortunately  there is no good reason to doubt it. Even if there are a few now living  in some remote nook of the Transvaal, or Zululand, or Portuguese East  Africa, the chances are as 100 to 1 that they will not be suffered to  bring back the species; and so, to Burchell's zebra, the world is to-day  saying \"Farewell!\"    [Illustration: THYLACINE OR TASMANIAN WOLF  Now Being Exterminated by the Sheep Owners of Tasmania]           *        *     "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13268"],[0,"Hindu literature : Comprising The Book of good counsels, Nala and Damayanti, The (#11)"],[1," rajahs.

WAR      When the next day of instruction was come, the King's sons spake to the  Sage, Vishnu-Sarman.    \"Master,\" said they, \"we are Princes, and the sons of Princes, and we  earnestly desire to hear thee discourse upon War.\"    \"I am to speak on what shall please you,\" replied Vishnu-Sarman. \"Hear  now, therefore, of 'War,' whose opening is thus:--        'Between the peoples of Peacock and Swan[16]      War raged; and evenly the contest ran,      Until the Swans to trust the Crows began.'    'And how was all that?' asked the sons of the Rajah. Vishnu-Sarman  proceeded to relate--      THE BATTLE OF THE SWANS AND PEACOCKS    \"In the Isle of Camphor there is a lake called 'Lotus-water,' and  therein a Swan-Royal, named 'Silver-sides,' had his residence. The birds  of the marsh and the mere had elected him King, in full council of all  the fowls--for a people with no ruler is like a ship that is without a  helmsman. One day King Silver-sides, with his courtiers, was quietly  reposing on a couch of well-spread lotus-blossoms, when a Crane, named  'Long-bill,' who had just arrived from foreign parts, entered the  presence with an obeisance, and sat down.    'What news from abroad, Long-bill?' asked his Majesty.    'Great news, may it please you,' answered the Crane, 'and therefore have  I hastened hither. Will your Majesty hear me?'    'Speak!' said King Silver-sides.    'You must know, my Liege,' began the Crane, 'that over all the birds of  the Vindhya mountains in Jambudwipa a Peacock is King, and his name is  'Jewel-plume,' I was looking for food about a certain burnt jungle  there, when some of his retainers discovered me, and asked my name and  country. 'I am a vassal of King Silver-sides, Lord of the Island of  Camphor,' I replied, 'and I am travelling in foreign lands for my  pleasure.' Upon that the birds asked me which country, my own or theirs,  and which King, appeared to me superior. 'How can you ask?' I replied;  'the island of Camphor is, as it were, Heaven itself, and its King a  heaven-born ruler. To dwellers in a barren land like yours how can I  describe them? Come for yourselves, and see the country where I live.'  Thereupon, your Majesty, the birds were exceedingly offended, as one  might expect--        'Simple milk, when serpents drink it, straightway into venom turns;      And a fool who heareth counsel all the wisdom of it spurns.'    For, indeed, no reflecting person wastes time in admonishing  blockheads--        'The birds that took the apes to teaching,      Lost eggs and nests in pay for preaching.'    'How did that befall?' asked the King.    The Crane related:--      THE STORY OF THE WEAVER-BIRDS AND THE MONKEYS    \"In a nullah that leads down to the Nerbudda river there stood a large  silk-cotton tree, where a colony of weaver-birds had built their hanging  nests, and lived snugly in them, whatever the weather. It was in the  rainy season, when the heavens are overlaid with clouds like  indigo-sheets, and a tremendous storm of water was falling. The birds  looked out from their nests, and saw some monkeys, shivering and starved  with the cold, standing under a tree. 'Twit! twit! you Monkeys,' they  began to chirrup. 'Listen to us!--        'With beaks we built these nests, of fibres scattered;      You that have hands and feet, build, or be spattered.'    On hearing that the Monkeys were by no means pleased. 'Ho! ho!' said  they, 'the Birds in their snug nests are jeering at us; wait till the  rain is over,' Accordingly, so soon as the weather mended, the Monkeys  climbed into the tree, and broke all the birds' eggs and demolished  every nest. I ought to have known better,' concluded the Crane, 'than to  have wasted my suggestions on King Jewel-plume's creatures.'    'But what did they say?' asked Silver-sides.    'They said, Rajah,' answered the Crane, 'who made that Swan of thine a  King?'    'And what was your reply?' asked Silver-sides.    'I demanded,' replied the Crane, 'who made a King of that Peacock of  theirs. Thereupon they were ready to kill me for rage; but I displayed  my very best valor. Is it not written--        'A modest manner fits a maid,        And Patience is a man's adorning;      But brides may kiss, nor do amiss,        And men may draw, at scathe and scorning.'    'Yet a man should measure his own strength first,' said the Rajah,  smiling; 'how did you fare against King Jewel-plume's fellows?'    'Very scurvily,' replied Long-bill. \"Thou rascal Crane,\" they cried,  \"dost thou feed on his soil, and revile our Sovereign? That is past  bearing!\" And thereat they all pecked at me. Then they began again:  \"Thou thick-skulled Crane! that King of thine is a goose--a web-footed  lord of littleness--and thou art but a frog in a well to bid us serve  him--- him forsooth!--        'Serving narrow-minded masters dwarfs high natures to their size:--      Seen before a convex mirror, elephants do show as mice.'    Bad kings are only strong enough to spoil good vassals--as a fiction  once was mightier than a herd of elephants. You know it, don't you?--        'Mighty may prove things insignificant:--      A tale of moonshine turned an elephant.'    'No! how was that?' I asked.    The birds related--      THE STORY OF THE OLD HARE AND THE ELEPHANTS    \"Once on a time, very little rain had fallen in the due season; and the  Elephants being oppressed with thirst, thus accosted their  leader:--'Master, how are we to live? The small creatures find something  to wash in, but we cannot, and we are half dead in consequence; whither  shall we go then, and what shall we do?' Upon that the King of the  Elephants led them away a little space; and showed them a beautiful pool  of crystal water, where they took their ease. Now it chanced that a  company of Hares resided on the banks of the pool, and the going and  coming of the elephants trampled many of them to death, till one of  their number named Hard-head grumbled out, 'This troop will be coming  here to water every day, and every one of our family will be crushed.'  'Do not disquiet yourself,' said an old buck named Good-speed, 'I will  contrive to avert it,' and so saying, he set off, bethinking himself on  his way how he should approach and accost a herd of elephants; for,        'Elephants destroy by touching, snakes with point of tooth beguile;      Kings by favor kill, and traitors murder with a fatal smile.'    'I will get on the top of a hill,' he thought, 'and address the  Elephants thence.'    \"This being done, and the Lord of the herd perceiving him, it was asked  of the Hare, 'Who art thou? and whence comest thou?'    'I am an ambassador from his Godship the Moon,' replied Good-speed.    'State your business,' said the Elephant-king.    'Sire,' began the Hare, 'an ambassador speaks the truth safely by  charter of his name. Thus saith the Moon, then: \"These hares were the  guardians of my pool, and thine elephants in coming thither have scared  them away. This is not well. Am I not Sasanka, whose banner bears a  hare, and are not these hares my votaries?\"'    'Please your worship,' said the Elephant-king with much trepidation, 'we  knew nothing of this; we will go there no more.'    'It were well,' said the sham ambassador, 'that you first made your  apologies to the Divinity, who is quaking with rage in his pool, and  then went about your business.'    'We will do so,' replied the Elephant with meekness; and being led by  night to the pool, in the ripples of which the image of the Moon was  quivering, the herd made their prostrations; the Hare explaining to the  Moon that their fault was done in ignorance, and thereupon they got  their dismissal.'    'Nay,' I said, 'my Sovereign is no fiction, but a great King and a  noble, and one that might govern the Three Worlds, much more a kingdom,'    'Thou shalt talk thy treason in the presence,' they cried; and therewith  I was dragged before King Jewel-plume.    'Who is this?' asked the Rajah.    'He is a servant of King Silver-sides, of the Island of Camphor,' they  replied; 'and he slights your Majesty, on your Majesty's own land.'    'Sirrah Crane!' said the Prime Minister, a Vulture, 'who is chief  officer in that court?'    'A Brahmany Goose,' I answered, 'named \"Know-all\"; and he does know  every possible science.'    'Sire,' broke in a Parrot, 'this Camphor-isle and the rest are poor  places, and belong to Jambudwipa. Your Majesty has but to plant the  royal foot upon them.'    'Oh! of course,' said the King.    'Nay,' said I, 'if talking makes your Majesty King of Camphor-island, my  Liege may be lord of Jambudwipa by a better title.'    'And that?' said the Parrot.    'Is fighting!' I responded.    'Good!' said the King, with a smile; 'bid your people prepare for war.'    'Not so,' I replied; 'but send your own ambassador.'    'Who will bear the message?' asked the Rajah. 'He should be loyal,  dexterous, and bold.'    'And virtuous,' said the Vulture, 'and therefore a Brahman:--        'Better Virtue marked a herald than that noble blood should deck;      Shiva reigns forever Shiva while the sea-wave stains his neck.'    'Then let the Parrot be appointed,' said the Rajah.    'I am your Majesty's humble servant,' replied the Parrot; 'but this  Crane is a bad character, and with the bad I never like to travel. The  ten-headed Ravana carried off the wife of Ramchundra! It does not do,        'With evil people neither stay nor go;      The Heron died for being with the Crow.'    'How did that befall?' asked the King.
