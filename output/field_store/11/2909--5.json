The tension of our age is such that diversions  must recur quickly. The next great Exposition may require two  Midways, or three or four for the convenience of the people. You  can't get a Midway any too near the anthropological and  ethnological sections; a cinematograph might be operated as an  adjunct to the Fine Arts building; a hula-hula dancer would  relieve the monotony of a succession of big pumpkins and prize  squashes.\"    At that moment the Professor became interested in the strange  procession entering the streets of Cairo, and we followed. Before  he got out it cost him fifty cents to learn his name, a quarter  for his fortune, ten cents for his horoscope, and sundry amounts  for gems, jewels, and souvenirs of the Orient.    Through his best hexameter spectacles he surveyed the dark-eyed  daughter of the Nile who was telling his fortune with a strong  Irish accent; all went smoothly until the prophetess happened to  see the Professor's sunburnt nose, fiery red from the four days'  run in wind and rain, and said warningly,--    \"You are too fond of good eating and drinking; you drink too much,  and unless you are more temperate you will die in twenty years.\"  That was too much for the Professor, whose occasional glass of  beer--a habit left over from his student days--would not discolor  the nose of a humming-bird.    There were no end of illusions, mysteries, and deceptions. The  greatest mystery of all was the eager desire of the people to be  deceived, and their bitter and outspoken disappointment when they  were not. As the Professor remarked,--    \"There never has been but one real American, and that was Phineas  T. Barnum. He was the genuine product of his country and his  times,--native ore without foreign dross. He knew the American  people as no man before or since has known them; he knew what the  American people wanted, and gave it to them in large unadulterated  doses,--humbug.\"    Tuesday morning was spent in giving the machine a thorough  inspection, some lost motion in the eccentric was taken up, every  nut and screw tightened, and the cylinder and intake mechanism  washed out with gasoline.    It is a good plan to clean out the cylinder with gasoline once  each week or ten days; it is not necessary, but the piston moves  with much greater freedom and the compression is better.    However good the cylinder oil used, after six or eight days' hard  and continuous running there is more or less residuum; in the very  nature of things there must be from the consumption of about a  pint of oil to every hundred miles.    Many use kerosene to clean cylinders, but gasoline has its  advantages; kerosene is excellent for all other bearings,  especially where there may be rust, as on the chain; but kerosene  is in itself a low grade oil, and the object in cleaning the  cylinder is to cut out all the oil and leave it bright and dry  ready for a supply of fresh oil.    After putting in the gasoline, the cylinder and every bearing  which the gasoline has touched should be thoroughly lubricated  before starting.    Lubrication is of vital importance, and the oil used makes all the  difference in the world.    Many makers of machines have adopted the bad practice of putting  up oil in cans under their own brands, and charging, of course,  two prices per gallon. The price is of comparatively little  consequence, though an item; for it does not matter so much  whether one pays fifty cents or a dollar a gallon, so long as the  best oil is obtained; the pernicious feature of the practice lies  in wrapping the oil in mystery, like a patent medicine,--\"Smith's  Cylinder Oil\" and \"Jones's Patent Pain-Killer\" being in one and  the same category. Then they warn--patent medicine methods again  --purchasers of machines that their particular brand of oil must  be used to insure best results.    The one sure result is that the average user who knows nothing  about lubricating oils is kept in a state of frantic anxiety lest  his can of oil runs low at a time and place where he cannot get  more of the patent brand.    Every manufacturer should embody in the directions for caring for  the machine information concerning all the standard oils that can  be found in most cities, and recommend the use of as many  different brands as possible.    Machine oil can be found in almost any country village, or at any  mill, factory, or power-house along the road; it is the cylinder  oil that requires fore-thought and attention.    Beware of steam-cylinder oil and all heavy and gummy oils. Rub a  little of any oil that is offered between the fingers until it  disappears,--the better the oil the longer you can rub it. If it  leaves a gummy or sticky feeling, do not use; but if it rubs away  thin and oily, it is probably good. Of course the oiliest of oils  are animal fats, good lard, and genuine sperm; but they work down  very thin and run away, and genuine sperm oil is almost an unknown  quantity. Lard can be obtained at every farmhouse, and may be  used, if necessary, on bearings.    In an emergency, olive oil and probably cotton-seed oil may be  used in the cylinder. Olive oil is a fine lubricant, and is used  largely in the Italian and Spanish navies.    Many special brands are probably good oils and safe to use, but  there is no need of staking one's trip upon any particular brand.    All good steam-cylinder oils contain animal oil to make them  adhere to the side of the cylinder; a pure mineral oil would be  washed away by the steam and water.    To illustrate the action of oils and water, take a clean bottle,  put in a little pure mineral oil, add some water, and shake hard;  the oil will rise to the top of the water in little globules  without adhering at all to the sides of the bottle; in short, the  bottle is not lubricated. Instead of a pure mineral oil put in any  steam-cylinder oil which is a compound of mineral and animal; and  as the bottle is shaken the oil adheres to the glass, covering the  entire inner surface with a film that the water will not rinse  off.    As there is supposed--erroneously--to be no moisture in the  cylinder of a gas-engine, the use of any animal oil is said to be  unnecessary; as there is moisture in the cylinder of a  steam-engine, some animal oil is absolutely essential in the  cylinder oil.    For the lubrication of chains and all parts exposed to the  weather, compounds of oil or grease which contain a liberal amount  of animal fat are better. Rain and the splash of mud and water  will wash off mineral oil as fast as it can be applied; in fact,  under adverse weather conditions it does not lubricate at all; the  addition of animal fat makes the compound stick.    Graphite and mica are both good chain lubricants, but if mixed  with a pure mineral base, such as vaseline, they will wash off in  mud and water. Before putting on a chain, it is a good thing to dip  it in melted tallow and then grease it thoroughly from time to  time with a graphite compound of vaseline and animal fat.    One does not expect perfection in a machine, but there is not an  automobile made, according to the reports of users, which does not  develop many crudities and imperfections in construction which  could be avoided by care and conscientious work in the factory,  --crudities and imperfections which customers and users have  complained of time and time again, but without avail.    At best the automobile is a complicated and difficult machine in  the hands of the amateur, and so far it has been made almost  impossible by its poor construction. With good construction there  will be troubles enough in operation, but at the present time  ninety per cent. of the stops and difficulties are due to  defective construction.    As the machine comes it looks so well, it inspires unbounded  confidence, but the first time it is seen in undress, with the  carriage part off, the machinery laid bare, the heart sinks, and  one's confidence oozes out.    Parts are twisted, bent, and hammered to get them into place,  bearings are filed to make them fit, bolts and screws are weak and  loose, nuts gone for the want of cotter-pins; it is as if  apprentice blacksmiths had spent their idle moments in  constructing a machine.    The carriage work is hopelessly bad. The building of carriages is  a long-established industry, employing hundreds of thousands of  hands and millions of capital, and yet in the entire United States  there are scarcely a dozen builders of really fine, substantial,  and durable vehicles. Yet every cross-road maker of automobiles  thinks that if he can only get his motor to go, the carpenter next  door can do his woodwork. The result is cheap stock springs,  clips, irons, bodies, cushions, tops, etc., are bought and put  over the motor. The use of aluminum bodies and more metal work  generally is helping things somewhat; not that aluminum and metal  work are necessarily better than wood, but it prevents the  unnatural union of the light wood bodies, designed for cheap  horse-vehicles, with a motor. The best French makers do not build  their bodies, but leave that part to skilled carriage builders.          CHAPTER SEVEN BUFFALO TO CANANDAIGUA  BEWARE OF THE COUNTRY MECHANIC    The five hundred and sixty-odd miles to Buffalo had been covered  with no trouble that delayed us for more than an hour, but our  troubles were about to begin.    The Professor had still a few days to waste frivolously, so he  said he would ride a little farther, possibly as far as Albany.  However, it was not our intention to hurry, but rather take it  easily, stopping by the way, as the mood--or our friends--seized  us.    It rained all the afternoon of Tuesday, about all night, and was  raining steadily when we turned off  Main Street into Genesee with  Batavia thirty-eight miles straight away. We fully expected to  reach there in time for luncheon; in fact, word had been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12384"],[0,"Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (#11)"],[1," flush of bloom.        America.      I.    Where the wings of a sunny Dome expand  I saw a Banner in gladsome air--  Starry, like Berenice's Hair--  Afloat in broadened bravery there;  With undulating long-drawn flow,  As rolled Brazilian billows go  Voluminously o'er the Line.  The Land reposed in peace below;    The children in their glee  Were folded to the exulting heart    Of young Maternity.      II.    Later, and it streamed in fight    When tempest mingled with the fray,  And over the spear-point of the shaft    I saw the ambiguous lightning play.  Valor with Valor strove, and died:  Fierce was Despair, and cruel was Pride;  And the lorn Mother speechless stood,  Pale at the fury of her brood.      III.    Yet later, and the silk did wind      Her fair cold form;  Little availed the shining shroud,    Though ruddy in hue, to cheer or warm.  A watcher looked upon her low, and said--  She sleeps, but sleeps, she is not dead.    But in that sleep contortion showed  The terror of the vision there--    A silent vision unavowed,  Revealing earth's foundation bare,    And Gorgon in her hidden place.  It was a thing of fear to see    So foul a dream upon so fair a face,  And the dreamer lying in that starry shroud.      IV.    But from the trance she sudden broke--    The trance, or death into promoted life;  At her feet a shivered yoke,  And in her aspect turned to heaven    No trace of passion or of strife--  A clear calm look. It spake of pain,  But such as purifies from stain--  Sharp pangs that never come again--    And triumph repressed by knowledge meet,  Power dedicate, and hope grown wise,    And youth matured for age's seat--  Law on her brow and empire in her eyes.    So she, with graver air and lifted flag;  While the shadow, chased by light,  Fled along the far-drawn height,    And left her on the crag.          Verses  Inscriptive and Memorial        On the Home Guards  who perished in the Defense of Lexington, Missouri.      The men who here in harness died    Fell not in vain, though in defeat.  They by their end well fortified    The Cause, and built retreat  (With memory of their valor tried)  For emulous hearts in many an after fray--  Hearts sore beset, which died at bay.        Inscription  for Graves at Pea Ridge, Arkansas.      Let none misgive we died amiss    When here we strove in furious fight:  Furious it was; nathless was this    Better than tranquil plight,  And tame surrender of the Cause  Hallowed by hearts and by the laws.    We here who warred for Man and Right,  The choice of warring never laid with us.    There we were ruled by the traitor's choice.    Nor long we stood to trim and poise,  But marched, and fell--victorious!        The Fortitude of the North  under the Disaster of the Second Manassas.      They take no shame for dark defeat    While prizing yet each victory won,  Who fight for the Right through all retreat,    Nor pause until their work is done.  The Cape-of-Storms is proof to every throe;    Vainly against that foreland beat  Wild winds aloft and wilder waves below:    The black cliffs gleam through rents in sleet  When the livid Antarctic storm-clouds glow.        On the Men of Maine  killed in the Victory of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.      Afar they fell. It was the zone    Of fig and orange, cane and lime  (A land how all unlike their own,  With the cold pine-grove overgrown),    But still their Country's clime.  And there in youth they died for her--        The Volunteers,  For her went up their dying prayers:    So vast the Nation, yet so strong the tie.  What doubt shall come, then, to deter    The Republic's earnest faith and courage high.        An Epitaph.      When Sunday tidings from the front    Made pale the priest and people,  And heavily the blessing went,    And bells were dumb in the steeple;  The Soldier's widow (summering sweerly here,    In shade by waving beeches lent)    Felt deep at heart her faith content,  And priest and people borrowed of her cheer.        Inscription  for Marye's Heights, Fredericksburg.      To them who crossed the flood  And climbed the hill, with eyes    Upon the heavenly flag intent,    And through the deathful tumult went  Even unto death: to them this Stone--  Erect, where they were overthrown--    Of more than victory the monument.        The Mound by the Lake.      The grass shall never forget this grave.  When homeward footing it in the sun    After the weary ride by rail,  The stripling soldiers passed her door,    Wounded perchance, or wan and pale,  She left her household work undone--  Duly the wayside table spread,    With evergreens shaded, to regale  Each travel-spent and grateful one.  So warm her heart--childless--unwed,  Who like a mother comforted.        On the Slain at Chickamauga.      Happy are they and charmed in life    Who through long wars arrive unscarred  At peace. To such the wreath be given,  If they unfalteringly have striven--    In honor, as in limb, unmarred.  Let cheerful praise be rife,    And let them live their years at ease,  Musing on brothers who victorious died--    Loved mates whose memory shall ever please.    And yet mischance is honorable too--    Seeming defeat in conflict justified  Whose end to closing eyes is his from view.  The will, that never can relent--  The aim, survivor of the bafflement,      Make this memorial due.        An uninscribed Monument  on one of the Battle-fields of the Wilderness.      Silence and Solitude may hint    (Whose home is in yon piny wood)  What I, though tableted, could never tell--  The din which here befell,    And striving of the multitude.  The iron cones and spheres of death    Set round me in their rust,      These, too, if just,  Shall speak with more than animated breath.    Thou who beholdest, if thy thought,  Not narrowed down to personal cheer,  Take in the import of the quiet here--    The after-quiet--the calm full fraught;  Thou too wilt silent stand--  Silent as I, and lonesome as the land.        On Sherman's Men  who fell in the Assault of Kenesaw Mountain, Georgia.      They said that Fame her clarion dropped    Because great deeds were done no more--  That even Duty knew no shining ends,  And Glory--'twas a fallen star!    But battle can heroes and bards restore.      Nay, look at Kenesaw:  Perils the mailed ones never knew  Are lightly braved by the ragged coats of blue,  And gentler hearts are bared to deadlier war.        On the Grave  of a young Cavalry Officer killed in the Valley of Virginia.      Beauty and youth, with manners sweet, and friends--    Gold, yet a mind not unenriched had he  Whom here low violets veil from eyes.    But all these gifts transcended be:  His happier fortune in this mound you see.        A Requiem  for Soldiers lost in Ocean Transports.      When, after storms that woodlands rue,    To valleys comes atoning dawn,  The robins blithe their orchard-sports renew;    And meadow-larks, no more withdrawn,  Caroling fly in the languid blue;  The while, from many a hid recess,  Alert to partake the blessedness,  The pouring mites their airy dance pursue.    So, after ocean's ghastly gales,  When laughing light of hoyden morning breaks,        Every finny hider wakes--    From vaults profound swims up with glittering scales;    Through the delightsome sea he sails,  With shoals of shining tiny things  Frolic on every wave that flings    Against the prow its showery spray;  All creatures joying in the morn,  Save them forever from joyance torn,    Whose bark was lost where now the dolphins play;  Save them that by the fabled shore,    Down the pale stream are washed away,  Far to the reef of bones are borne;    And never revisits them the light,  Nor sight of long-sought land and pilot more;    Nor heed they now the lone bird's flight  Round the lone spar where mid-sea surges pour.        On a natural Monument  in a field of Georgia.[21]      No trophy this--a Stone unhewn,    And stands where here the field immures  The nameless brave whose palms are won.  Outcast they sleep; yet fame is nigh--    Pure fame of deeds, not doers;  Nor deeds of men who bleeding die    In cheer of hymns that round them float:  In happy dreams such close the eye.  But withering famine slowly wore,    And slowly fell disease did gloat.  Even Nature's self did aid deny;  They choked in horror the pensive sigh.    Yea, off from home sad Memory bore  (Though anguished Yearning heaved that way),  Lest wreck of reason might befall.    As men in gales shun the lee shore,  Though there the homestead be, and call,  And thitherward winds and waters sway--  As such lorn mariners, so fared they.  But naught shall now their peace molest.    Their fame is this: they did endure--  Endure, when fortitude was vain  To kindle any approving strain  Which they might hear. To these who rest,    This healing sleep alone was sure.        Commemorative of a Naval Victory.      Sailors there are of gentlest breed,    Yet strong, like every goodly thing;  The discipline of arms refines,    And the wave gives tempering.    The damasked blade its beam can fling;  It lends the last grave grace:  The hawk, the hound, and sworded nobleman    In Titian's picture for a king,  Are of Hunter or warrior race.    In social halls a favored guest    In years that follow victory won,  How sweet to feel your festal fame,    In woman's glance instinctive thrown:    Repose is yours--your deed is known,  It musks the amber wine;  It lives, and sheds a litle from storied days    Rich as October sunsets brown,  Which make the barren place to shine.    But seldom the laurel wreath is seen    Unmixed with pensive pansies dark;  There's a light and a shadow on every man    Who at last attains his lifted mark--    Nursing through night the ethereal spark.  Elate he never can be;  He feels that spirits which glad had hailed his worth,    Sleep in oblivion.--The shark  Glides white through the prosphorus sea.
