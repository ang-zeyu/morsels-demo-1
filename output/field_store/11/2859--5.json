A closer study  of the original authorities would, I am sure, have led M. de Rialle to  change this opinion. He is singularly far from the conclusion reached by  M. Ternaux-Compans, who says: \"Tezcatlipoca fut la personnification du bon  principe.\" _Essai sur la Theogonie Mexicaine_, p. 23 (Paris, 1840). Both  opinions are equally incomplete. Dr. Schultz-Sellack considers him the  \"Wassergott,\" and assigns him to the North, in his essay, _Die  Amerikanischen Goetter der Vier Weltgegenden, Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie_,  Bd. xi, 1879. This approaches more closely to his true character.]    This is further shown by the beliefs current as to his occasional  appearance on earth. This was always at night and in the gloom of the  forest. The hunter would hear a sound like the crash of falling trees,  which would be nothing else than the mighty breathings of the giant form  of the god on his nocturnal rambles. Were the hunter timorous he would die  outright on seeing the terrific presence of the god; but were he of  undaunted heart, and should rush upon him and seize him around the waist,  the god was helpless and would grant him anything he wished. \"Ask what you  please,\" the captive deity would say, \"and it is yours. Only fail not to  release me before the sun rises. For I must leave before it appears.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Torquemada, _Monarquia Indiana_, Lib. XIV, cap. XXII.]      Sec.2. _Quetzalcoatl the God._    In the ancient and purely mythical narrative, Quetzalcoatl is one of four  divine brothers, gods like himself, born in the uttermost or thirteenth  heaven to the infinite and uncreated deity, which, in its male  manifestations, was known as _Tonaca tecutli_, Lord of our Existence, and  _Tzin teotl_, God of the Beginning, and in its female expressions as  _Tonaca cihuatl_, Queen of our Existence, _Xochiquetzal_, Beautiful Rose,  _Citlallicue_, the Star-skirted or the Milky Way, _Citlalatonac_, the Star  that warms, or The Morning, and _Chicome coatl_, the Seven Serpents.[1]    [Footnote 1: The chief authorities on the birth of the god Quetzalcoatl,  are Ramirez de Fuen-leal _Historia de los Mexicanos por sus Pinturas_,  Cap. i, printed in the _Anales del Museo Nacional_; the _Codex  Telleriano-Remensis_, and the _Codex Vaticanus_, both of which are in  Kingsborough's _Mexican Antiquities_.    The usual translation of _Tonaca tecutli_ is \"God of our Subsistence,\"  _to_, our, _naca_, flesh, _tecutli_, chief or lord. It really has a more  subtle meaning. _Naca_ is not applied to edible flesh--that is expressed  by the word _nonoac_--but is the flesh of our own bodies, our life,  existence. See _Anales de Cuauhtitlan_, p. 18, note.]    Of these four brothers, two were the black and the red Tezcatlipoca, and  the fourth was Huitzilopochtli, the Left handed, the deity adored beyond  all others in the city of Mexico. Tezcatlipoca--for the two of the name  blend rapidly into one as the myth progresses--was wise beyond compute; he  knew all thoughts and hearts, could see to all places, and was  distinguished for power and forethought.    At a certain time the four brothers gathered together and consulted  concerning the creation of things. The work was left to Quetzalcoatl and  Huitzilopochtli. First they made fire, then half a sun, the heavens, the  waters and a certain great fish therein, called Cipactli, and from its  flesh the solid earth. The first mortals were the man, Cipactonal, and the  woman, Oxomuco,[1] and that the son born to them might have a wife, the  four gods made one for him out of a hair taken from the head of their  divine mother, Xochiquetzal.    [Footnote 1: The names Cipactli and Cipactonal have not been  satisfactorily analyzed. The derivation offered by Senor Chavero (_Anales  del Museo Nacional_, Tom. ii, p.116), is merely fanciful; _tonal_ is no  doubt from _tona_, to shine, to warn; and I think _cipactli_ is a softened  form with the personal ending from _chipauac_, something beautiful or  clear. Hence the meaning of the compound is The Beautiful Shining One.  Oxomuco, which Chavero derives from _xomitl_, foot, is perhaps the same as  _Xmukane_, the mother of the human race, according to the _Popol Vuh_, a  name which, I have elsewhere shown, appears to be from a Maya root,  meaning to conceal or bury in the ground. The hint is of the fertilizing  action of the warm light on the seed hidden in the soil. See _The Names of  the Gods in the Kiche Myths, Trans. of the Amer. Phil. Soc._ 1881.]    Now began the struggle between the two brothers, Tezcatlipoca and  Quetzalcoatl, which was destined to destroy time after time the world,  with all its inhabitants, and to plunge even the heavenly luminaries into  a common ruin.    The half sun created by Quetzalcoatl lighted the world but poorly, and the  four gods came together to consult about adding another half to it. Not  waiting for their decision, Tezcatlipoca transformed himself into a sun,  whereupon the other gods filled the world with great giants, who could  tear up trees with their hands. When an epoch of thirteen times fifty-two  years had passed, Quetzalcoatl seized a great stick, and with a blow of it  knocked Tezcatlipoca from the sky into the waters, and himself became sun.  The fallen god transformed himself into a tiger, and emerged from the  waves to attack and devour the giants with which his brothers had  enviously filled the world which he had been lighting from the sky. After  this, he passed to the nocturnal heavens, and became the constellation of  the Great Bear.    For an epoch the earth flourished under Quetzalcoatl as sun, but  Tezcatlipoca was merely biding his time, and the epoch ended, he appeared  as a tiger and gave Quetzalcoatl such a blow with his paw that it hurled  him from the skies. The overthrown god revenged himself by sweeping the  earth with so violent a tornado that it destroyed all the inhabitants but  a few, and these were changed into monkeys. His victorious brother then  placed in the heavens, as sun, Tlaloc, the god of darkness, water and  rains, but after half an epoch, Quetzalcoatl poured a flood of fire upon  the earth, drove Tlaloc from the sky, and placed in his stead, as sun, the  goddess Chalchiutlicue, the Emerald Skirted, wife of Tlaloc. In her time  the rains poured so upon the earth that all human beings were drowned or  changed into fishes, and at last the heavens themselves fell, and sun and  stars were alike quenched.    Then the two brothers whose strife had brought this ruin, united their  efforts and raised again the sky, resting it on two mighty trees, the Tree  of the Mirror (_tezcaquahuitl_) and the Beautiful Great Rose Tree  (_quetzalveixochitl_), on which the concave heavens have ever since  securely rested; though we know them better, perhaps, if we drop the  metaphor and call them the \"mirroring sea\" and the \"flowery earth,\" on one  of which reposes the horizon, in whichever direction we may look.    Again the four brothers met together to provide a sun for the now darkened  earth. They decided to make one, indeed, but such a one as would eat the  hearts and drink the blood of victims, and there must be wars upon the  earth, that these victims could be obtained for the sacrifice. Then  Quetzalcoatl builded a great fire and took his son--his son born of his  own flesh, without the aid of woman--and cast him into the flames, whence  he rose into the sky as the sun which lights the world. When the Light-God  kindles the flames of the dawn in the orient sky, shortly the sun emerges  from below the horizon and ascends the heavens. Tlaloc, god of waters,  followed, and into the glowing ashes of the pyre threw his son, who rose  as the moon.    Tezcatlipoca had it now in mind to people the earth, and he, therefore,  smote a certain rock with a stick, and from it issued four hundred  barbarians (_chichimeca_).[1] Certain five goddesses, however, whom he had  already created in the eighth heaven, descended and slew these four  hundred, all but three. These goddesses likewise died before the sun  appeared, but came into being again from the garments they had left  behind. So also did the four hundred Chichimecs, and these set about to  burn one of the five goddesses, by name Coatlicue, the Serpent Skirted,  because it was discovered that she was with child, though yet unmarried.  But, in fact, she was a spotless virgin, and had known no man. She had  placed some white plumes in her bosom, and through these the god  Huitzilopochtli entered her body to be born again. When, therefore, the  four hundred had gathered together to burn her, the god came forth fully  armed and slew them every one.    [Footnote 1: The name Chichimeca has been a puzzle. The derivation appears  to be from _chichi_, a dog, _mecatl_, a rope. According to general  tradition the Chichimecs were a barbarous people who inhabited Mexico  before the Aztecs came. Yet Sahagun says the Toltecs were the real  Chichimecs (Lib. x, cap. xxix). In the myth we are now considering, they  were plainly the stars.]    It is not hard to guess who are these four hundred youths slain before the  sun rises, destined to be restored to life and yet again destroyed. The  veil of metaphor is thin which thus conceals to our mind the picture of  the myriad stars quenched every morning by the growing light, but  returning every evening to their appointed places. And did any doubt  remain, it is removed by the direct statement in the echo of this  tradition preserved by the Kiches of Guatemala, wherein it is plainly said  that the four hundred youths who were put to death by Zipacna, and  restored to life by Hunhun Ahpu, \"rose into the sky and became the stars  of heaven.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: _Popol Vuh, Le Livre Sacre des Quiches_, p. 193.]    Indeed, these same ancient men whose"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11039"],[0,"A Woman's Journey Round the World (#11)"],[1,"morning, I accompanied Count Berchthold to  the botanical gardens.  Our curiosity to visit these gardens was  very great:  we hoped to see there magnificent specimens of trees  and flowers from all parts of the world--but we were rather  disappointed.  The gardens have been founded too recently, and none  of the large trees have yet attained their full growth; there is no  very great selection of flowers or plants; and to the few that are  there, not even tickets are affixed, to acquaint the visitor with  their names.  The most interesting objects for us, were the monkey's  bread-tree, with its gourds weighing ten or twenty-five pounds, and  containing a number of kernels, which are eaten, not only by  monkeys, but also by men--the clove, camphor, and cocoa-tree, the  cinnamon and tea bush, etc.  We also saw a very peculiar kind of  palm-tree:  the lower portion of the trunk, to the height of two or  three feet, was brown and smooth, and shaped like a large tub or  vat; the stems that sprang from this were light green, and like the  lower part, very smooth, and at the same time shining, as if  varnished; they were not very high, and the crest of leaves, as is  the case with other palms, only unfolded itself at the top of the  tree.  Unfortunately, we were unable to learn the names of this kind  of palm; and in the whole course of my voyage, I never met with  another specimen.    We did not leave the gardens before noon:  we then proceeded on foot  four miles as far as Batafogo, and thence reached the city by  omnibus.    Herr Geiger had invited Count Berchtholdt, Herr Rister, (a native of  Vienna), and myself to an excursion to the Corcovado mountains; and  accordingly, on the 1st November, at a time when we are often  visited by storms and snow, but when the sun is here in his full  force, and the sky without a cloud, at an early hour in the morning  did we commence our pilgrimage.    The splendid aqueduct was our guide as far as the springs from which  it derives the water, which point we reached in an hour and a half,  having been so effectually protected by the deep shade of lovely  woods, that even the intense heat of the sun, which reached during  the day more than 117 degrees, (in the sun), scarcely annoyed us.    We stopped at the springs; and, on a sign from Herr Geiger, an  athletic negro made his appearance, loaded with a large hamper of  provisions--everything was soon prepared--a white cloth was spread  out, and the eatables and drinkables placed upon it.  Our meal was  seasoned with jokes and good humour; and when we started afresh on  our journey, we felt revived both in body and mind.    The last cone of the mountain gave us some trouble:  the route was  very precipitous, and lay over bare, hot masses of rock.  But when  we did reach the top, we were more than repaid by seeing spread  before us such a panorama, as most assuredly is very seldom to be  met with in the world.  All that I had remarked on my entrance into  the port, lay there before me, only more clearly defined and more  extended, with innumerable additional objects.  We could see the  whole town, all the lower hills, which half hid it from my view on  my arrival, the large bay, reaching as far as the Organ mountain;  and, on the other side, the romantic valley, containing the  botanical gardens, and a number of beautiful country-houses.    I recommend every one who comes to Rio Janeiro, although it be only  for a few days, to make this excursion, since from this spot he can,  with one glance, perceive all the treasures which nature, with so  truly liberal a hand, has lavished upon the environs of this city.  He will here see virgin forests, which, if not quite as thick and  beautiful as those farther inland, are still remarkable for their  luxuriant vegetation.  Mimosae and Aarren baume of a gigantic size,  palms, wild coffee-trees, orchidaen, parasites and creepers,  blossoms and flowers, without end; birds of the most brilliant  plumage, immense butterflies, and sparkling insects, flying in  swarms from blossom to blossom, from branch to branch.  A most  wonderful effect also is produced by the millions of fire-flies,  which find their way into the very tops of the trees, and sparkle  between the foliage like so many brightly twinkling stars.    I had been informed that the ascent of this mountain was attended  with great difficulty.  I did not, however, find this to be the  case, since the summit may be reached with the greatest ease in  three hours and three quarters, while three parts of the way can  also be performed on horseback.    The regular residence of the imperial family may be said to be the  Palace of Christovao, about half an hour's walk from the town.  It  is there that the emperor spends most of the year, and where also  all political councils are held, and state business transacted.    The palace is small, and is distinguished neither for taste nor  architectural beauty:  its sole charm is its situation.  It is  placed upon a hill, and commands a view of the Organ mountain, and  one of the bays.  The palace garden itself is small, and is laid out  in terraces right down into the valley below:  a larger garden, that  serves as a nursery for plants and trees, joins it.  Both these  gardens are highly interesting for Europeans, since they contain a  great number of plants, which either do not exist at all in Europe,  or are only known from dwarf specimens in hot-houses.  Herr Riedl,  who has the management of both gardens, was kind enough to conduct  us over them himself, and to draw my attention more especially to  the tea and bamboo plantations.    Ponte de Cascher(four miles from the town) is another imperial  garden.  There are three mango trees here, which are very  remarkable, from their age and size.  Their branches describe a  circle of more than eighty feet in circumference, but they no longer  bear fruit.  Among the most agreeable walks in the immediate  vicinity of the town, I may mention the Telegraph mountain, the  public garden (Jardin publico), the Praya do Flamingo, and the  Cloisters of St. Gloria and St. Theresia, etc.    I had heard so much in Rio Janeiro of the rapid rise of Petropolis,  a colony founded by Germans in the neighbourhood of Rio Janeiro, of  the beauty of the country where it was situated, and of the virgin  forests through which a part of the road ran--that I could not  resist the temptation of making an excursion thither.  My travelling  companion, Count Berchthold, accompanied me; and, on the 26th  September, we took two places on board one of the numerous barks  which sail regularly every day for the Porto d'Estrella, (a distance  of twenty or twenty-two nautical miles), from which place the  journey is continued by land.  We sailed through a bay remarkable  for its extremely picturesque views, and which often reminded me  vividly of the peculiar character of the lakes in Sweden.  It is  surrounded by ranges of lovely hills, and is dotted over with small  islands, both separate and in groups, some of which are so  completely overgrown with palms, as well as other trees and shrubs,  that it seems impossible to land upon them, while others either rear  their solitary heads like huge rocks from the waves, or are loosely  piled one upon the other.  The round form of many of the latter is  especially remarkable:  they almost seem to have been cut out with a  chisel.    Our bark was manned by four negroes and a white skipper.  At first  we ran before the wind with full sails, and the crew took advantage  of this favourable opportunity to make a meal, consisting of a  considerable quantity of flour of manioc, boiled fish, roasted mil,  (Turkish corn), oranges, cocoa-nuts, and other nuts of a smaller  description; indeed, there was even white bread, which for blacks is  a luxury; and I was greatly delighted to see them so well taken care  of.  In two hours the wind left us, and the crew were obliged to  take to the oars, the manner of using which struck me as very  fatiguing.  At each dip of the oar into the water, the rower mounts  upon a bench before him, and then, during the stroke, throws himself  off again with his full force.  In two hours more, we left the sea,  and taking a left-hand direction, entered the river Geromerim, at  the mouth of which is an inn, where we stopped half an hour, and  where I saw a remarkable kind of lighthouse, consisting of a lantern  affixed to a rock.  The beauty of the country is now at an end--that  is, in the eyes of the vulgar:  a botanist would, at this point,  find it more than usually wonderful and magnificent; for the most  beautiful aquatic plants, especially the Nymphia, the Pontedera, and  the Cyprian grass are spread out, both in the water and all round  it.  The two former twine themselves to the very top of the nearest  sapling, and the Cyprian grass attains a height of from six to eight  feet.  The banks of the river are flat, and fringed with underwood  and young trees; the background is formed by ranges of hills.  The  little houses, which are visible now and then, are built of stone,  and covered with tiles, yet, nevertheless, they present a tolerably  poverty-stricken appearance.    After sailing up the river for seven hours, we reached, without  accident, Porto d'Estrella, a place of some importance, since it is  the emporium for all the merchandise which is sent from the  interior, and then conveyed by water to the capital.  There are two  good inns; and, besides these, a large building (similar to a  Turkish Khan) and an immense tiled roof, supported on strong stone  pillars.  The first was appropriated to the merchandise, and the  second to the donkey drivers, who had arranged themselves very  comfortably underneath it, and were preparing their evening meal  over various fires that were blazing away very cheerfully.  Although  fully admitting the charms of such quarters for the night, we  preferred retiring to the"]]]
