They spoke clearly, readily, profoundly on everything, when  suddenly their thoughts struck upon the breakers of their madness and  broke to pieces there, and were dispersed and foundered in that furious  and terrible sea, full of bounding waves, fogs and squalls, which is  called _madness_.    I certainly should think that I was mad, absolutely mad, if I were not  conscious, did not perfectly know my state, if I did fathom it by  analyzing it with the most complete lucidity. I should, in fact, be a  reasonable man who was laboring under a hallucination. Some unknown  disturbance must have been excited in my brain, one of those  disturbances which physiologists of the present day try to note and to  fix precisely, and that disturbance must have caused a profound gulf in  my mind and in the order and logic of my ideas. Similar phenomena occur  in the dreams which lead us through the most unlikely phantasmagoria,  without causing us any surprise, because our verifying apparatus and  our sense of control has gone to sleep, while our imaginative faculty  wakes and works. Is it not possible that one of the imperceptible keys  of the cerebral finger-board has been paralyzed in me? Some men lose  the recollection of proper names, or of verbs or of numbers or merely  of dates, in consequence of an accident. The localization of all the  particles of thought has been proved nowadays; what then would there be  surprising in the fact that my faculty of controlling the unreality of  certain hallucinations should be destroyed for the time being!    I thought of all this as I walked by the side of the water. The sun was  shining brightly on the river and made earth delightful, while it  filled my looks with love for life, for the swallows, whose agility is  always delightful in my eyes, for the plants by the riverside, whose  rustling is a pleasure to my ears.    By degrees, however, an inexplicable feeling of discomfort seized me.  It seemed to me as if some unknown force were numbing and stopping me,  were preventing me from going farther and were calling me back. I felt  that painful wish to return which oppresses you when you have left a  beloved invalid at home, and when you are seized by a presentiment that  he is worse.    I, therefore, returned in spite of myself, feeling certain that I  should find some bad news awaiting me, a letter or a telegram. There  was nothing, however, and I was more surprised and uneasy than if I had  had another fantastic vision.    _August 8th._ I spent a terrible evening yesterday. He does not show  himself any more, but I feel that he is near me, watching me, looking  at me, penetrating me, dominating me and more redoubtable when he hides  himself thus, than if he were to manifest his constant and invisible  presence by supernatural phenomena. However, I slept.    _August 9th._ Nothing, but I am afraid.    _August 10th._ Nothing; what will happen to-morrow?    _August 11th._ Still nothing; I cannot stop at home with this fear  hanging over me and these thoughts in my mind; I shall go away.    _August 12th._ Ten o'clock at night. All day long I have been trying to  get away, and have not been able. I wished to accomplish this simple  and easy act of liberty--go out--get into my carriage in order to go to  Rouen--and I have not been able to do it. What is the reason?    _August 13th._ When one is attacked by certain maladies, all the  springs of our physical being appear to be broken, all our energies  destroyed, all our muscles relaxed, our bones to have become as soft as  our flesh, and our blood as liquid as water. I am experiencing that in  my moral being in a strange and distressing manner. I have no longer  any strength, any courage, any self-control, nor even any power to set  my own will in motion. I have no power left to _will_ anything, but  some one does it for me and I obey.    _August 14th._ I am lost! Somebody possesses my soul and governs it!  Somebody orders all my acts, all my movements, all my thoughts. I am no  longer anything in myself, nothing except an enslaved and terrified  spectator of all the things which I do. I wish to go out; I cannot. He  does not wish to, and so I remain, trembling and distracted in the  armchair in which he keeps me sitting. I merely wish to get up and to  rouse myself, so as to think that I am still master of myself: I  cannot! I am riveted to my chair, and my chair adheres to the ground in  such a manner that no force could move us.    Then suddenly, I must, I must go to the bottom of my garden to pick  some strawberries and eat them, and I go there. I pick the strawberries  and I eat them! Oh! my God! my God! Is there a God? If there be one,  deliver me! save me! succor me! Pardon! Pity! Mercy! Save me! Oh! what  sufferings! what torture! what horror!    _August 15th._ Certainly this is the way in which my poor cousin was  possessed and swayed, when she came to borrow five thousand francs of  me. She was under the power of a strange will which had entered into  her, like another soul, like another parasitic and ruling soul. Is the  world coming to an end?    But who is he, this invisible being that rules me? This unknowable  being, this rover of a supernatural race?    Invisible beings exist, then! How is it then that since the beginning  of the world they have never manifested themselves in such a manner  precisely as they do to me? I have never read anything which resembles  what goes on in my house. Oh! If I could only leave it, if I could only  go away and flee, so as never to return, I should be saved; but I  cannot.    _August 16th_. I managed to escape to-day for two hours, like a  prisoner who finds the door of his dungeon accidentally open. I  suddenly felt that I was free and that he was far away, and so I gave  orders to put the horses in as quickly as possible, and I drove to  Rouen. Oh! How delightful to be able to say to a man who obeyed you:  \"Go to Rouen!\"    I made him pull up before the library, and I begged them to lend me Dr.  Herrmann Herestauss's treatise on the unknown inhabitants of the  ancient and modern world.    Then, as I was getting into my carriage, I intended to say: \"To the  railway station!\" but instead of this I shouted--I did not say, but I  shouted--in such a loud voice that all the passers-by turned round:  \"Home!\" and I fell back onto the cushion of my carriage, overcome by  mental agony. He had found me out and regained possession of me.    _August 17th_. Oh! What a night! what a night! And yet it seems to me  that I ought to rejoice. I read until one o'clock in the morning!  Herestauss, Doctor of Philosophy and Theogony, wrote the history and  the manifestation of all those invisible beings which hover around man,  or of whom he dreams. He describes their origin, their domains, their  power; but none of them resembles the one which haunts me. One might  say that man, ever since he has thought, has had a foreboding of, and  feared a new being, stronger than himself, his successor in this world,  and that, feeling him near, and not being able to foretell the nature  of that master, he has, in his terror, created the whole race of hidden  beings, of vague phantoms born of fear.    Having, therefore, read until one o'clock in the morning, I went and  sat down at the open window, in order to cool my forehead and my  thoughts, in the calm night air. It was very pleasant and warm! How I  should have enjoyed such a night formerly!    There was no moon, but the stars darted out their rays in the dark  heavens. Who inhabits those worlds? What forms, what living beings,  what animals are there yonder? What do those who are thinkers in those  distant worlds know more than we do? What can they do more than we can?  What do they see which we do not know? Will not one of them, some day  or other, traversing space, appear on our earth to conquer it, just as  the Norsemen formerly crossed the sea in order to subjugate nations  more feeble than themselves?    We are so weak, so unarmed, so ignorant, so small, we who live on this  particle of mud which turns round in a drop of water.    I fell asleep, dreaming thus in the cool night air, and then, having  slept for about three quarters of an hour, I opened my eyes without  moving, awakened by I know not what confused and strange sensation. At  first I saw nothing, and then suddenly it appeared to me as if a page  of a book which had remained open on my table, turned over of its own  accord. Not a breath of air had come in at my window, and I was  surprised and waited. In about four minutes, I saw, I saw, yes I saw  with my own eyes another page lift itself up and fall down on the  others, as if a finger had turned it over. My armchair was empty,  appeared empty, but I knew that he was there, he, and sitting in my  place, and that he was reading. With a furious bound, the bound of an  enraged wild beast that wishes to disembowel its tamer, I crossed my  room to seize him, to strangle him, to kill him!... But before I could  reach it, my chair fell over as if somebody had run away from me ... my  table rocked, my lamp fell and went out, and my window closed as if  some thief had been surprised and had fled out into the night, shutting  it behind him.    So he had run away: he had been afraid; he, afraid of me!    So ... so ... to-morrow ... or later ... some day or other ... I should  be able to hold him in my clutches and crush him against the ground! Do  not dogs occasionally bite and strangle their masters?    _August 18th._ I have been thinking the whole day long. Oh! yes, I will  obey him, follow his impulses, fulfill all his wishes, show myself  humble, submissive, a coward. He is the stronger; but an hour will  come....    _August 19th_. I know, ... I know ... I know all! I have just read the  following in the _Revue du Monde Scientifique_: \"A curious piece of  news comes to us"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],[0,"Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#11)"],[1,",\" replied Second Class Man  Tyson, almost with heat.  \"You're a fast, heavy and hard scrapper  for your age, mister, but the other man simply out-pointed you  all through the game.  If you call him out again, and he meets  you, he can kill you if he sees fit.\"    \"Misters,\" directed Midshipman Trotter, addressing Henkel and  Page, \"you'd better hurry to get your man over to a surgeon if  you want to be in your rooms at lights-out time.\"    As Page and Henkel started away with their unfortunate comrade,  Dave approached Tyson.    \"Sir, do you believe that I fought with entire fairness?\" asked  Darrin of the referee.    \"Fair?  Of course you did, mister,\" replied Tyson.  \"Come along,  Trotter.\"    Dave, who had dressed some time before, now turned with Dan and  Rollins and started back.  They took pains not to be seen close  to the upper class men.    \"Who won?\" demanded a fourth class man, curiously, as they neared  Bancroft Hall.    \"Farley will tell you tomorrow if he's able,\" grinned Dan.    When taps sounded on the bugle, that evening, all of the midshipmen,  save Farley, were in their rooms.    Promptly as the last note of taps broke on the air the last of the  midshipmen was in bed, and the electric light was turned off from a  master switch.  The inspection of rooms was on.          CHAPTER IX    DAN JUST CAN'T HELP BEING \"TOUGE\"      Fourth Class Man Farley did not put in an appearance at breakfast  formation in the morning.    As this was the opening day of the first term of the academic  year it was a bad time to be \"docked for repairs\" at the hospital.    Merely reading over the list of the fourth class studies did not  convey to the new men much idea of how hard they were to find  their work.    In the department of Marine Engineering and Naval Construction  there were lessons in mechanical drawing.    No excuse is made for a midshipman's natural lack of ability in  drawing.  He must draw satisfactorily if he is to hope to pass.    In mathematics the new man had to recite in algebra, logarithms  and geometry.    In addition to the foregoing, during the first term, the new midshipman  had courses in English and in French.    As at West Point, the mathematics is the stumbling block of the new  man at Annapolis.    In the first term algebra, logarithms and geometry had to be finished,  for in the second term trigonometry was the subject in mathematics.    Shortly before eight in the morning the bugle call sounded for the  first period of recitation.    The midshipmen fell in by classes in front of Bancroft Hall.  After muster the classes marched away by sections.    Each section contained an average of ten men, under command of  one of their number, who was known as the section leader.    It was the section leader's duty to march his section to the proper  recitation room in Academic Hall, to preserve discipline while  marching, and to report his section to the instructor.    At the beginning of the academic year the fourth class men were  divided into sections in alphabetical order.  Afterwards the sections  would be reorganized according to order of merit.    So, at the outset, Darrin and Dalzell were in the same section,  and Dave, as it happened, had been appointed section leader.    When the command rang out Dave marched away with his section,  feeling somewhat proud that he had attained even to so small a  degree of command.    It was an interesting sight to see hundreds of midshipmen, split  up into so many sections, marching across the grounds in so many  different directions, for not all the sections were headed for  Academic Hall.    Dave knew the number of the room to which his section was bound, and  knew also the location of the room.    Sections march, in step, at a brisk gait, the clicking of so many  heels against the pavements making a rhythmic, inspiring sound.    Some of the midshipmen in Dave's section however, felt low-spirited  that morning.  They had been looking through their text-books,  and felt a dread that they would not be able to keep up the stiff  pace of learning long enough to get past the semi-annual examinations  in the coming January.    Dave and Dan, however, both felt in good spirits.  They had looked  through the first lessons in algebra, and felt that they would  not have much trouble at the outset, anyway.  They believed that  they had been well grounded back in their High School days.    On their way Darrin's section was passed by three officers of  the Navy.  Midshipmen must always salute officers of the Navy.  While marching in sections, however, the only midshipman who  salutes is the section leader.    Three times Dave's hand came smartly up to the visor of his cap  in salute, while the other men in his section looked straight ahead.    Reaching Academic Hall Dave marched his section mates into the  recitation room.    Lieutenant Bradshaw, the instructor, was already present, standing  by his desk.    Darrin saluted the lieutenant as soon as he had halted the section.    \"Sir, I report all members of the section present.\"    Five of the midshipmen were directed by Lieutenant Bradshaw to go  to their seats.  The rest were ordered to blackboards, Dave and Dan  among the latter number.    Those at the blackboards were each given a problem to lay out  on the blackboard.  Then the instructor turned to the fourth class  men who remained in their seats.    These he questioned, in turn, on various aspects of the day's lesson.    All the time the midshipmen at the blackboard worked busily away,  each blocking out phase after phase of his problem.    Dave Darrin was first to finish.  He turned his back to the board,  taking the position of parade rest.    Dan was third to finish.    \"Mr. Darrin, you may explain your work,\" announced Lieutenant  Bradshaw.    This Dave did, slowly, carefully, though without painful hesitation.  When he had finished the instructor asked him several questions  about the problem, and about some other phases of the day's work.  Darrin did not jump at any of his answers, but made them thoughtfully.    \"Very good, indeed, Mr. Darrin,\" commented the instructor.  \"But,  when you are more accustomed to reciting here, I shall hope for  a little more speed in answering.\"    As Dave was returning to his seat Lieutenant Bradshaw marked him  3.8 per cent on the day's work.    That was an excellent marking, 4 being the highest.  The lowest  average in a study which a midshipman may have, and hold his place  in the Naval Academy, is 2.5.  Anything below 2.5 is unsatisfactory,  which, in midshipman parlance is \"unsat.\"  Taking 4 to represent  100 per cent., 2.5 stands for 62.5 per cent.  This would not be  a high average to expect, as courses are laid down in the average  High School of the land; but as most of our American High Schools  go 2.5 at Annapolis is at least as good a marking as 90 per cent  would be in a High School.    \"Good old Dave leaks too slow at the spout, does he?\" chuckled  Dan to himself, as he waited at parade rest.  \"When it comes my  turn, then, as I happen to know my problem as well as the fellow  who wrote the book, I'll rattle off my explanation at a gait that  will force the lieutenant to stand on his feet to hear all I say.\"    Dalzell was the fourth man called upon at the blackboard.    Taking a deep breath, and assuming a tremendously earnest look,  Dan plunged into the demonstration of his problem as fast as he  could fire the words out.    Lieutenant Bradshaw, however, listened through to the end.    \"Your demonstration is correct, Mr Dalzell,\" said the instructor  quietly.  \"However while speed in recitation is of value, in the  future try to speak just a little more slowly and much more distinctly.  You are fitting yourself to become a Naval officer one of these  days.  On shipboard it is of the utmost importance that an officer's  voice be always distinct and clear, in order that every word he  utters may be instantly understood.  Try to keep this always in  mind, Mr. Dalzell, and cultivate the habit of speaking distinctly.\"    The rebuke was a very quiet one, and courteously given.  But Dan,  who knew that every other man in the section was grinning in secret  over his discomfiture, was quickly losing his nerve.    Then, without favor, Lieutenant Bradshaw questioned Dan searchingly  on other details of the day's work.  Dan stammered, and forgot  much that he had thought he knew.    Lieutenant Bradshaw set down a mark of 2.9, whereas Dalzell, had  he stuck sensibly to the business in hand, would have been marked  as high as Dave had been.    As the section was marching back to Bancroft Dan whispered:    \"Dave, did you hear the old owl go 'too-whoo' at me in the section  room?\"    \"Stop talking in section!\" ordered Dave crisply.    \"Blazes!  There isn't a single spot at Annapolis where a fellow  can take a chance on being funny!\" muttered Dalzell under his breath.    \"Dave, old chum,\" cried Dan tossing his cap on the bed as they  entered their room.  \"Are you going to turn greaser, and stay greaser?\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Darrin quietly.    \"You told me to shut up in the ranks.\"    \"That was right, wasn't it?  I am under orders to see that there  is no talking in the section when marching.\"    \"Not even a solitary, teeny little word, eh?\"    \"Not if I can stop it,\" replied Dave.    \"And what if you can't stop it?\"    \"Then I am obliged to direct the offender to put himself on the  report.\"    \"Great Scott!  Would you tell your chum to frap the pap for a  little thing like that, and take demerits unto himself?\"    \"If I had to,\" nodded Dave.  \"You see, Dan, we're here trying  to learn to be Naval officers and to hold command.  Now, it's  my belief that a man who can't take orders, and stick to them,  isn't fit to give orders at any period in his life.\"    \"This sort of thing is getting on my nerves a bit,\" grumbled Dan.  \"Just think of all the freedom we had in the good old days back  at Gridley!\"    \"This"]]]
