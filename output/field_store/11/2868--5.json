He made the god Shu to shine upon    thy body; he illumined thy path with rays of light; he destroyed for    thee the faults and defects of thy members by the magical power of the    words of his mouth; he made Set and Horus to be at peace for thy sake;    he destroyed the storm-wind and the hurricane; he made the two    combatants (_i.e._, Set and Horus) to be gracious unto thee and the    two lauds to be at peace before thee; he did away the wrath which was    in their hearts, and each became reconciled unto his brother (_i.e._,    thyself).      \"Thy son Horus is triumphant in the presence of the full assembly of    the gods, the sovereignty over the world hath been given unto him, and    his dominion extendeth unto the uttermost parts of the earth. The    throne of the god Seb hath been adjudged unto him, together with the    rank which was created by the god Temu, and which hath been stablished    by decrees [made] in the Chamber of Archives, and hath been inscribed    upon an iron tablet according to the command of thy father Ptah-Tanen    when he sat upon the great throne. He hath set his brother upon that    which the god Shu beareth up (_i.e._, the heavens), to stretch out the    waters over the mountains, and to make to spring up that which groweth    upon the hills, and the grain (?) which shooteth upon the earth, and    he giveth increase by water and by land. Gods celestial and gods    terrestrial transfer themselves to the service of thy son Horus, and    they follow him into his hall [where] a decree is passed that he shall    be lord over them, and they do [his will] straightway.      \"Let thy heart rejoice, O lord of the gods, let thy heart rejoice    greatly; Egypt and the Red Land are at peace, and they serve humbly    under thy sovereign power. The temples are stablished upon their own    lands, cities and nomes possess securely the goods which they have in    their names, and we will make unto thee the divine offerings which we    are bound to make, and offer sacrifices in thy name for ever.    Acclamations are made in thy name, libations are poured out to thy KA,    and sepulchral meals [are brought unto thee] by the spirits who are in    thy following, and water is sprinkled ... on each side of the souls of    the dead in this land. Every plan for thee which hath been decreed by    the commands of R[=a] from the beginning hath been perfected. Now    therefore, O son of Nut, thou art crowned as Neb-er-tcher is crowned    at his rising. Thou livest, thou art stablished, thou renewest thy    youth, and thou art true and perfect; thy father R[=a] maketh strong    thy members, and the company of the gods make acclamations unto thee.    The goddess Isis is with thee and she never leaveth thee; [thou art]    not overthrown by thine enemies. The lords of all lands praise thy    beauties, even as they praise R[=a] when he riseth at the beginning of    each day. Thou risest up like an exalted being upon thy standard, thy    beauties lift up the face [of man] and make long [his] stride. The    sovereignty of thy father Seb hath, been given unto thee, and the    goddess Nut, thy mother, who gave birth to the gods, brought thee    forth as the firstborn, of five gods, and created thy beauties and    fashioned thy members. Thou art established as king, the white crown    is upon thy head, and thou hast grasped in thy hands the crook and    whip; whilst thou wert in the womb, and hadst not as yet come forth    therefrom upon the earth, thou wert crowned lord of the two lands, and    the 'Atef' crown of R[=a] was upon thy brow. The gods come unto thee    bowing low to the ground, and they hold thee in fear; they retreat and    depart when, they see thee with the terror of R[=a], and the victory    of thy Majesty is in their hearts. Life is with thee, and offerings of    meat and drink follow thee, and that which is thy due is offered up    before thy face.\"    In one paragraph of another somewhat similar hymn [Footnote: See  _Chapters of Coming Forth by Day_, p. 342.] other aspects of Osiris are  described, and after the words \"Homage to thee, O Governor of those who  are in Amentet,\" he is called the being who \"giveth birth unto men and  women a second time,\" [Footnote: The words are _mes tememu em nem_.]  _i.e._, \"who maketh mortals to be born again.\" As the whole paragraph  refers to Osiris \"renewing himself,\" and to his making himself \"young  like unto R[=a] each and every day,\" there can be no doubt that the  resurrection of the dead, that is to say, their birth into a new life,  is what the writer means by the second birth of men and women. From this  passage also we may see that Osiris has become the equal of R[=a], and  that he has passed from being the god of the dead to being the god of  the living. Moreover, at the time when the above extracts were copied  Osiris was not only assumed to have occupied the position which R[=a]  formerly held, but his son Horus, who was begotten after his death, was,  by virtue of his victory over Set, admitted to be the heir and successor  of Osiris. And he not only succeeded to the \"rank and dignity\" of his  father Osiris, but in his aspect of \"avenger of his father,\" he  gradually acquired the peculiar position of intermediary and intercessor  on behalf of the children of men. Thus in the Judgment Scene he leads  the deceased into the presence of Osiris and makes an appeal to his  father that the deceased may be allowed to enjoy the benefits enjoyed by  all those who are \"true of voice\" and justified in the judgment. Such an  appeal, addressed to Osiris in the presence of Isis, from the son born  under such remarkable circumstances was, the Egyptian thought, certain  of acceptance; and the offspring of a father, after the death of whose  body he was begotten, was naturally the best advocate for the deceased.    But although such exalted ideas of Osiris and his position among the  gods obtained generally in Egypt during the XVIIIth dynasty (about B.C.  1600) there is evidence that some believed that in spite of every  precaution the body might decay, and that it was necessary to make a  special appeal unto Osiris if this dire result was to be avoided. The  following remarkable prayer was first found inscribed upon a linen  swathing which had enveloped the mummy of Thothmes III., but since that  time the text, written in hieroglyphics, has been found inscribed upon  the _Papyrus of Nu_, [Footnote: Brit. Mus., No. 10,477, sheet 18. I have  published the text in my _Chapters of Coming Forth by Day_, pp.  398-402.] and it is, of course, to be found also in the late papyrus  preserved at Turin, which the late Dr. Lepsius published so far back as  1842. This text, which is now generally known as Chapter CLIV of the  Book of the Dead, is entitled \"The Chapter of not letting the body  perish.\" The text begins:--      \"Homage to thee, O my divine father Osiris! I have come to thee that    thou mayest embalm, yea embalm these my members, for I would not    perish and come to an end, [but would be] even like unto my divine    father Khepera, the divine type of him that never saw corruption.    Come, then, and make me to have the mastery over my breath, O thou    lord of the winds, who dost magnify those divine beings who are like    unto thyself. Stablish thou me, then, and strengthen me, O lord of the    funeral chest. Grant thou that I may enter into the land of    everlastingness, even as it was granted unto thee, and unto thy father    Temu, O thou whose body did not see corruption, and who thyself never    sawest corruption. I have never wrought that which thou hatest, nay, I    have uttered acclamations with those who have loved thy KA. Let not my    body turn into worms, but deliver me [from them] even as thou didst    deliver thyself. I beseech thee, let me not fall into rottenness as    thou dost let every god, and every goddess, and every animal, and    every reptile to see corruption when the soul hath gone forth from    them after their death. For when the soul departeth, a man seeth    corruption, and the bones of his body rot and become wholly    loathsomeness, the members decay piecemeal, the bones crumble into an    inert mass, the flesh turneth into foetid liquid, and he becometh a    brother unto the decay which cometh upon him. And he turneth into a    host of worms, and he becometh a mass of worms, and an end is made of    him, and he perisheth in the sight of the god Shu even as doth every    god, and every goddess, and every feathered fowl, and every fish, and    every creeping thing, and every reptile, and every animal, and every    thing whatsoever. When the worms see me and know me, let them fall    upon their bellies, and let the fear of me terrify them; and thus let    it be with every creature after [my] death, whether it be animal, or    bird, or fish, or worm, or reptile. And let life arise out of death.    Let not decay caused by any reptile make an end [of me], and let not    them come against me in their various forms. Do not thou give me over    unto that slaughterer who dwelleth in his torture-chamber (?), who    killeth the members of the body and maketh them to rot, who worketh    destruction upon many dead bodies, whilst he himself remaineth hidden    and liveth by slaughter; let me live and perform his message, and let    me do that which is commanded by him. Gave me not over unto his    fingers, and let him not gain, the mastery over me, for I am under thy    command, O lord of the gods.      \"Homage to thee; O my divine father Osiris, thou hast thy being with    thy members. Thou didst not decay, thou didst not become worms, thou    didst not diminish, thou didst not become corruption, thou didst not    putrefy, and thou didst not turn into worms.\"    The deceased then identifying himself with Khepera, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11323"],[0,"Caleb Williams; Or, Things as They Are (#11)"],[1,"death at least to one  of us, and with misfortune and remorse to the survivor.\"    \"Upon my soul, you are a strange man! Why trouble me with your  prophecies and forebodings?\"    \"Because it is necessary to your happiness! Because it becomes me to  tell you of our danger now, rather than wait till my character will  allow this tranquillity no longer!    \"By quarrelling we shall but imitate the great mass of mankind, who  could easily quarrel in our place. Let us do better. Let us show that we  have the magnanimity to contemn petty misunderstandings. By thus  judging we shall do ourselves most substantial honour. By a contrary  conduct we shall merely present a comedy for the amusement of our  acquaintance.\"    \"Do you think so? there may be something in that. Damn me, if I consent  to be the jest of any man living.\"    \"You are right, Mr. Tyrrel. Let us each act in the manner best  calculated to excite respect. We neither of us wish to change roads; let  us each suffer the other to pursue his own track unmolested. Be this our  compact; and by mutual forbearance let us preserve mutual peace.\"    Saying this, Mr. Falkland offered his hand to Mr. Tyrrel in token of  fellowship. But the gesture was too significant. The wayward rustic, who  seemed to have been somewhat impressed by what had preceded, taken as he  now was by surprise, shrunk back. Mr. Falkland was again ready to take  fire upon this new slight, but he checked himself.    \"All this is very unaccountable,\" cried Mr. Tyrrel. \"What the devil can  have made you so forward, if you had not some sly purpose to answer, by  which I am to be overreached?\"    \"My purpose,\" replied Mr. Falkland, \"is a manly and an honest purpose.  Why should you refuse a proposition dictated by reason, and an equal  regard to the interest of each?\"    Mr. Tyrrel had had an opportunity for pause, and fell back into his  habitual character.    \"Well, sir, in all this I must own there is some frankness. Now I will  return you like for like. It is no matter how I came by it, my temper is  rough, and will not be controlled. Mayhap you may think it is a  weakness, but I do not desire to see it altered. Till you came, I found  myself very well: I liked my neighbours, and my neighbours humoured me.  But now the case is entirely altered; and, as long as I cannot stir  abroad without meeting with some mortification in which you are directly  or remotely concerned, I am determined to hate you. Now, sir, if you  will only go out of the county or the kingdom, to the devil if you  please, so as I may never hear of you any more, I will promise never to  quarrel with you as long as I live. Your rhymes and your rebusses, your  quirks and your conundrums, may then be every thing that is grand for  what I care.\"    \"Mr. Tyrrel, be reasonable! Might not I as well desire you to leave the  county, as you desire me? I come to you, not as to a master, but an  equal. In the society of men we must have something to endure, as well  as to enjoy. No man must think that the world was made for him. Let us  take things as we find them; and accommodate ourselves as we can to  unavoidable circumstances.\"    \"True, sir; all this is fine talking. But I return to my text: we are as  God made us. I am neither a philosopher nor a poet, to set out upon a  wild-goose chase of making myself a different man from what you find me.  As for consequences, what must be must be. As we brew we must bake. And  so, do you see? I shall not trouble myself about what is to be, but  stand up to it with a stout heart when it comes. Only this I can tell  you, that as long as I find you thrust into my dish every day I shall  hate you as bad as senna and valerian. And damn me, if I do not think I  hate you the more for coming to-day in this pragmatical way, when nobody  sent for you, on purpose to show how much wiser you are than all the  world besides.\"    \"Mr. Tyrrel, I have done. I foresaw consequences, and came as a friend.  I had hoped that, by mutual explanation, we should have come to a better  understanding. I am disappointed; but, perhaps, when you coolly reflect  on what has passed, you will give me credit for my intentions, and think  that my proposal was not an unreasonable one.\"    Having said this, Mr. Falkland departed. Through the interview he, no  doubt, conducted himself in a way that did him peculiar credit. Yet the  warmth of his temper could not be entirely suppressed: and even when he  was most exemplary, there was an apparent loftiness in his manner that  was calculated to irritate; and the very grandeur with which he  suppressed his passions, operated indirectly as a taunt to his opponent.  The interview was prompted by the noblest sentiments; but it  unquestionably served to widen the breach it was intended to heal.    For Mr. Tyrrel, he had recourse to his old expedient, and unburthened  the tumult of his thoughts to his confidential friend. \"This,\" cried he,  \"is a new artifice of the fellow, to prove his imagined superiority. We  knew well enough that he had the gift of the gab. To be sure, if the  world were to be governed by words, he would be in the right box. Oh,  yes, he had it all hollow! But what signifies prating? Business must be  done in another guess way than that. I wonder what possessed me that I  did not kick him! But that is all to come. This is only a new debt  added to the score, which he shall one day richly pay. This Falkland  haunts me like a demon. I cannot wake but I think of him. I cannot sleep  but I see him. He poisons all my pleasures. I should be glad to see him  torn with tenter-hooks, and to grind his heart-strings with my teeth. I  shall know no joy till I see him ruined. There may be some things right  about him; but he is my perpetual torment. The thought of him hangs  like a dead weight upon my heart, and I have a right to shake it off.  Does he think I will feel all that I endure for nothing?\"    In spite of the acerbity of Mr. Tyrrel's feelings, it is probable,  however, he did some justice to his rival. He regarded him, indeed, with  added dislike; but he no longer regarded him as a despicable foe. He  avoided his encounter; he forbore to treat him with random hostility; he  seemed to lie in wait for his victim, and to collect his venom for a  mortal assault.          CHAPTER V.      It was not long after that a malignant distemper broke out in the  neighbourhood, which proved fatal to many of the inhabitants, and was of  unexampled rapidity in its effects. One of the first persons that was  seized with it was Mr. Clare. It may be conceived, what grief and alarm  this incident spread through the vicinity. Mr. Clare was considered by  them as something more than mortal. The equanimity of his behaviour, his  unassuming carriage, his exuberant benevolence and goodness of heart,  joined with his talents, his inoffensive wit, and the comprehensiveness  of his intelligence, made him the idol of all that knew him. In the  scene of his rural retreat, at least, he had no enemy. All mourned the  danger that now threatened him. He appeared to have had the prospect of  long life, and of going down to his grave full of years and of honour.  Perhaps these appearances were deceitful. Perhaps the intellectual  efforts he had made, which were occasionally more sudden, violent, and  unintermitted, than a strict regard to health would have dictated, had  laid the seed of future disease. But a sanguine observer would  infallibly have predicted, that his temperate habits, activity of mind,  and unabated cheerfulness, would be able even to keep death at bay for a  time, and baffle the attacks of distemper, provided their approach were  not uncommonly rapid and violent. The general affliction, therefore, was  doubly pungent upon the present occasion.    But no one was so much affected as Mr. Falkland. Perhaps no man so well  understood the value of the life that was now at stake. He immediately  hastened to the spot; but he found some difficulty in gaining admission.  Mr. Clare, aware of the infectious nature of his disease, had given  directions that as few persons as possible should approach him. Mr.  Falkland sent up his name. He was told that he was included in the  general orders. He was not, however, of a temper to be easily repulsed;  he persisted with obstinacy, and at length carried his point, being only  reminded in the first instance to employ those precautions which  experience has proved most effectual for counteracting infection.    He found Mr. Clare in his bed-chamber, but not in bed. He was sitting in  his night-gown at a bureau near the window. His appearance was composed  and cheerful, but death was in his countenance. \"I had a great  inclination, Falkland,\" said he, \"not to have suffered you to come in;  and yet there is not a person in the world it could give me more  pleasure to see. But, upon second thoughts, I believe there are few  people that could run into a danger of this kind with a better prospect  of escaping. In your case, at least, the garrison will not, I trust, be  taken through the treachery of the commander. I cannot tell how it is  that I, who can preach wisdom to you, have myself been caught. But do  not be discouraged by my example. I had no notice of my danger, or I  would have acquitted myself better.\"    Mr. Falkland having once established himself in the apartment of his  friend, would upon no terms consent to retire. Mr. Clare considered that  there was perhaps less danger in this choice, than in the frequent  change from the extremes of a pure to a tainted air, and desisted from  expostulation. \"Falkland,\" said he, \"when you came in, I had just  finished making my will. I was not pleased with what I had formerly  drawn up upon that subject, and I did not choose in my present situation  to call in an attorney. In fact, it would be strange if a man of sense,  with pure and direct intentions, should not be able to perform such a  function for"]]]
