And he noted,  with amusing memories of how much afraid he had once been of  shocking his Dorothy's notions of decorum, that she did not repulse  him very vigorously.    \"Here, over a dead body! Oh, Jurgen, this is horrible! Now, Jurgen,  remember that somebody may come any minute! And I thought I could  trust you! Ah, and is this all the respect you have for me!\" This  much she said in duty. Meanwhile the eyes of Dorothy were dilated  and very tender.    \"Faith, I take no chances, this second time. And so whatever  happens, I shall not always regret that which I left undone.\"    Now upon his lips was laughter, and his arms were about the  submissive girl. And in his heart was an unnamable depression and a  loneliness, because it seemed to him that this was not the Dorothy  whom he had seen in the garden between dawn and sunrise. For in my  arms now there is just a very pretty girl who is not over-careful in  her dealings with young men, thought Jurgen, as their lips met.  Well, all life is a compromise; and a pretty girl is something  tangible, at any rate. So he laughed, triumphantly, and prepared for  the sequel.    But as Jurgen laughed triumphantly, with his arm beneath the head of  Dorothy, and with the tender face of Dorothy passive beneath his lips,  and with unreasonable wistfulness in his heart, the castle bell tolled  midnight. What followed was curious: for as Wednesday passed, the face  of Dorothy altered, her flesh roughened under his touch, and her cheeks  fell away, and fine lines came about her eyes, and she became the  Countess Dorothy whom Jurgen remembered as Heitman Michael's wife.  There was no doubt about it, in that be-drenching moonlight: and she  was leering at him, and he was touching her everywhere, this horrible  lascivious woman, who was certainly quite old enough to know better  than to permit such liberties. And her breath was sour and nauseous.  Jurgen drew away from her, with a shiver of loathing, and he closed his  eyes, to shut away that sensual face.    \"No,\" he said; \"it would not be fair to what we owe to others. In  fact, it would be a very heinous sin. We should weigh such  considerations occasionally, madame.\"    Then Jurgen left his temptress, with simple dignity. \"I go to search  for my dear wife, madame, in a frame of mind which I would strongly  advise you to adopt toward your husband.\"    And he went straightway down the terraces of Bellegarde, and turned  southward to where his horse was tethered upon Amneran Heath: and  Jurgen was feeling very virtuous.          8.    Old Toys and a New Shadow      Jurgen had behaved with conspicuous nobility, Jurgen reflected: but  he had committed himself. \"I go in search of my dear wife,\" he had  stated, in the exaltation of virtuous sentiments. And now Jurgen  found himself alone in a world of moonlight just where he had last  seen his wife.    \"Well, well,\" he said, \"now that my Wednesday is done with, and I am  again a reputable pawnbroker, let us remember the advisability of  sometimes doing the manly thing! It was into this cave that Lisa  went. So into this cave go I, for the second time, rather than home  to my unsympathetic relatives-in-law. Or at least, I think I am  going--\"    \"Ay,\" said a squeaking voice, \"this is the time. A ab hur hus!\"    \"High time!\"    \"Oh, more than time!\"    \"Look, the man in the oak!\"    \"Oho, the fire-drake!\"    Thus many voices screeched and wailed confusedly. But Jurgen,  staring about him, could see nobody: and all the tiny voices seemed  to come from far overhead, where nothing was visible save the clouds  which of a sudden were gathering; for a wind was rising, and already  the moon was overcast. Now for a while that noise high in the air  became like a wrangling of sparrows, wherein no words were  distinguishable.    Then said a small shrill voice distinctly: \"Note now, sweethearts,  how high we pass over the wind-vexed heath, where the gallows'  burden creaks and groans swaying to and fro in the night! Now the  rain breaks loose as a hawk from the fowler, and grave Queen Holda  draws her tresses over the moon's bright shield. Now the bed is  made, and the water drawn, and we the bride's maids seek for the  lass who will be bride to Sclaug.\"    Said another: \"Oh, search for a maid with golden hair, who is  perfect, tender and pure, and fit for a king who is old as love,  with no trace of love in him. Even now our grinning dusty master  wakes from sleep, and his yellow fingers shake to think of her  flower-soft lips who comes to-night to his lank embrace and warms  the ribs that our eyes have seen. Who will be bride to Sclaug?\"    And a third said: \"The wedding-gown we have brought with us, we that  a-questing ride; and a maid will go hence on Phorgemon in  Cleopatra's shroud. Hah. Will o'the Wisp will marry the couple--\"    \"No, no! let Brachyotus!\"    \"No, be it Kitt with the candle-stick!\"    \"Eman hetan, a fight, a fight!\"    \"Oho, Tom Tumbler, 'ware of Stadlin!\"    \"Hast thou the marmaritin, Tib?\"    \"A ab hur hus!\"    \"Come, Bembo, come away!\"    So they all fell to screeching and whistling and wrangling high over  Jurgen's head, and Jurgen was not pleased with his surroundings.    \"For these are the witches of Amneran about some deviltry or another  in which I prefer to take no part. I now regret that I flung away a  cross in this neighborhood so very recently, and trust the action  was understood. If my wife had not made a point of it, and had not  positively insisted upon it, I would never have thought of doing  such a thing. I intended no reflection upon anybody. Even so, I  consider this heath to be unwholesome. And upon the whole, I prefer  to seek whatever I may encounter in this cave.\"    So in went Jurgen, for the second time.    And the tale tells that all was dark there, and Jurgen could see no  one. But the cave stretched straight forward, and downward, and at  the far end was a glow of light. Jurgen went on and on, and so came  to the place where he had found the Centaur. This part of the cave  was now vacant. But behind where Nessus had lain in wait for Jurgen  was an opening in the cave's wall, and through this opening streamed  the light. Jurgen stooped and crawled through the orifice.    He stood erect. He caught his breath sharply. Here at his feet was,  of all things, a tomb carved with the recumbent effigy of a woman.  Now this part of the cave was lighted by lamps upon tall iron  stands, so that everything was clearly visible, even to Jurgen,  whose eyesight had of late years failed him. This was certainly a  low flat tombstone such as Jurgen had seen in many churches: but the  tinted effigy thereupon was curious, somehow Jurgen looked more  closely. He touched the thing.    Then he recoiled, because there is no mistaking the feel of dead  flesh. The effigy was not colored stone: it was the body of a dead  woman. More unaccountable still, it was the body of Felise de  Puysange, whom Jurgen had loved very long ago in Gatinais, a great  many years before he set up in business as a pawnbroker.    Very strange it was to Jurgen again to see her face. He had often  wondered what had become of this large brown woman; had wondered if  he were really the first man for whom she had put a deceit upon her  husband; and had wondered what sort of person Madame Felise de  Puysange had been in reality.    \"Two months it was that we played at intimacy, was it not, Felise?  You comprehend, my dear, I really remember very little about you.  But I recall quite clearly the door left just a-jar, and how as I  opened it gently I would see first of all the lamp upon your  dressing-table, turned down almost to extinction, and the glowing  dust upon its glass shade. Is it not strange that our exceeding  wickedness should have resulted in nothing save the memory of dust  upon a lamp chimney? Yet you were very handsome, Felise. I dare say  I would have liked you if I had ever known you. But when you told me  of the child you had lost, and showed me his baby picture, I took a  dislike to you. It seemed to me you were betraying that child by  dealing over-generously with me: and always between us afterward was  his little ghost. Yet I did not at all mind the deceits you put upon  your husband. It is true I knew your husband rather intimately--.  Well, and they tell me the good Vicomte was vastly pleased by the  son you bore him some months after you and I had parted. So there  was no great harm done, after all--\"    Then Jurgen saw there was another woman's body lying like an effigy  upon another low flat tomb, and beyond that another, and then still  others. And Jurgen whistled.    \"What, all of them!\" he said. \"Am I to be confronted with every  pound of tender flesh I have embraced? Yes, here is Graine, and  Rosamond, and Marcoueve, and Elinor. This girl, though, I do not  remember at all. And this one is, I think, the little Jewess I  purchased from Hassan Bey in Sidon, but how can one be sure? Still,  this is certainly Judith, and this is Myrina. I have half a mind to  look again for that mole, but I suppose it would be indecorous.  Lord, how one's women do add up! There must be several scores of  them in all. It is the sort of spectacle that turns a man to serious  thinking. Well, but it is a great comfort to reflect that I dealt  fairly with every one of them. Several of them treated me most  unjustly, too. But that is past and done with: and I bear no malice  toward such fickle and short-sighted creatures as could not be  contented with one lover, and he the Jurgen that was!\"    Thereafter, Jurgen, standing among his dead, spread out his arms in  an embracing gesture.    \"Hail to you, ladies, and farewell! for you and I have done with love.  Well, love is very pleasant to observe as he advances, overthrowing all  ancient memories with laughter. And yet for each gay lover who concedes  the lordship of love, and wears intrepidly love's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8789"],[0,"The vision of hell.

I more would add,  But must from farther speech and onward way  Alike desist, for yonder I behold  A mist new-risen on the sandy plain.  A company, with whom I may not sort,  Approaches.  I commend my TREASURE to thee,  Wherein I yet survive; my sole request.\"    This said he turn'd, and seem'd as one of those,  Who o'er Verona's champain try their speed  For the green mantle, and of them he seem'd,  Not he who loses but who gains the prize.          CANTO XVI    NOW came I where the water's din was heard,  As down it fell into the other round,  Resounding like the hum of swarming bees:  When forth together issu'd from a troop,  That pass'd beneath the fierce tormenting storm,  Three spirits, running swift.  They towards us came,  And each one cried aloud, \"Oh do thou stay!  Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem  To be some inmate of our evil land.\"    Ah me! what wounds I mark'd upon their limbs,  Recent and old, inflicted by the flames!  E'en the remembrance of them grieves me yet.    Attentive to their cry my teacher paus'd,  And turn'd to me his visage, and then spake;  \"Wait now! our courtesy these merit well:  And were 't not for the nature of the place,  Whence glide the fiery darts, I should have said,  That haste had better suited thee than them.\"    They, when we stopp'd, resum'd their ancient wail,  And soon as they had reach'd us, all the three  Whirl'd round together in one restless wheel.  As naked champions, smear'd with slippery oil,  Are wont intent to watch their place of hold  And vantage, ere in closer strife they meet;  Thus each one, as he wheel'd, his countenance  At me directed, so that opposite  The neck mov'd ever to the twinkling feet.    \"If misery of this drear wilderness,\"  Thus one began, \"added to our sad cheer  And destitute, do call forth scorn on us  And our entreaties, let our great renown  Incline thee to inform us who thou art,  That dost imprint with living feet unharm'd  The soil of Hell.  He, in whose track thou see'st  My steps pursuing, naked though he be  And reft of all, was of more high estate  Than thou believest; grandchild of the chaste  Gualdrada, him they Guidoguerra call'd,  Who in his lifetime many a noble act  Achiev'd, both by his wisdom and his sword.  The other, next to me that beats the sand,  Is Aldobrandi, name deserving well,  In the upper world, of honour; and myself  Who in this torment do partake with them,  Am Rusticucci, whom, past doubt, my wife  Of savage temper, more than aught beside  Hath to this evil brought.\"  If from the fire  I had been shelter'd, down amidst them straight  I then had cast me, nor my guide, I deem,  Would have restrain'd my going; but that fear  Of the dire burning vanquish'd the desire,  Which made me eager of their wish'd embrace.    I then began: \"Not scorn, but grief much more,  Such as long time alone can cure, your doom  Fix'd deep within me, soon as this my lord  Spake words, whose tenour taught me to expect  That such a race, as ye are, was at hand.  I am a countryman of yours, who still  Affectionate have utter'd, and have heard  Your deeds and names renown'd.  Leaving the gall  For the sweet fruit I go, that a sure guide  Hath promis'd to me.  But behooves, that far  As to the centre first I downward tend.\"    \"So may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs,\"  He answer straight return'd; \"and so thy fame  Shine bright, when thou art gone; as thou shalt tell,  If courtesy and valour, as they wont,  Dwell in our city, or have vanish'd clean?  For one amidst us late condemn'd to wail,  Borsiere, yonder walking with his peers,  Grieves us no little by the news he brings.\"    \"An upstart multitude and sudden gains,  Pride and excess, O Florence! have in thee  Engender'd, so that now in tears thou mourn'st!\"  Thus cried I with my face uprais'd, and they  All three, who for an answer took my words,  Look'd at each other, as men look when truth  Comes to their ear.  \"If thou at other times,\"  They all at once rejoin'd, \"so easily  Satisfy those, who question, happy thou,  Gifted with words, so apt to speak thy thought!  Wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime,  Returning to behold the radiant stars,  When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past,  See that of us thou speak among mankind.\"    This said, they broke the circle, and so swift  Fled, that as pinions seem'd their nimble feet.    Not in so short a time might one have said  \"Amen,\" as they had vanish'd. Straight my guide  Pursu'd his track.  I follow'd; and small space  Had we pass'd onward, when the water's sound  Was now so near at hand, that we had scarce  Heard one another's speech for the loud din.    E'en as the river, that holds on its course  Unmingled, from the mount of Vesulo,  On the left side of Apennine, toward  The east, which Acquacheta higher up  They call, ere it descend into the vale,  At Forli by that name no longer known,  Rebellows o'er Saint Benedict, roll'd on  From the Alpine summit down a precipice,  Where space enough to lodge a thousand spreads;  Thus downward from a craggy steep we found,  That this dark wave resounded, roaring loud,  So that the ear its clamour soon had stunn'd.    I had a cord that brac'd my girdle round,  Wherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take  The painted leopard.  This when I had all  Unloosen'd from me (so my master bade)  I gather'd up, and stretch'd it forth to him.  Then to the right he turn'd, and from the brink  Standing few paces distant, cast it down  Into the deep abyss.  \"And somewhat strange,\"  Thus to myself I spake, \"signal so strange  Betokens, which my guide with earnest eye  Thus follows.\"  Ah! what caution must men use  With those who look not at the deed alone,  But spy into the thoughts with subtle skill!    \"Quickly shall come,\" he said, \"what I expect,  Thine eye discover quickly, that whereof  Thy thought is dreaming.\"  Ever to that truth,  Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears,  A man, if possible, should bar his lip;  Since, although blameless, he incurs reproach.  But silence here were vain; and by these notes  Which now I sing, reader!  I swear to thee,  So may they favour find to latest times!  That through the gross and murky air I spied  A shape come swimming up, that might have quell'd  The stoutest heart with wonder, in such guise  As one returns, who hath been down to loose  An anchor grappled fast against some rock,  Or to aught else that in the salt wave lies,  Who upward springing close draws in his feet.          CANTO XVII    \"LO! the fell monster with the deadly sting!  Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls  And firm embattled spears, and with his filth  Taints all the world!\"  Thus me my guide address'd,  And beckon'd him, that he should come to shore,  Near to the stony causeway's utmost edge.    Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear'd,  His head and upper part expos'd on land,  But laid not on the shore his bestial train.  His face the semblance of a just man's wore,  So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;  The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws  Reach'd to the armpits, and the back and breast,  And either side, were painted o'er with nodes  And orbits.  Colours variegated more  Nor Turks nor Tartars e'er on cloth of state  With interchangeable embroidery wove,  Nor spread Arachne o'er her curious loom.  As ofttimes a light skiff, moor'd to the shore,  Stands part in water, part upon the land;  Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,  The beaver settles watching for his prey;  So on the rim, that fenc'd the sand with rock,  Sat perch'd the fiend of evil.  In the void  Glancing, his tail upturn'd its venomous fork,  With sting like scorpion's arm'd.  Then thus my guide:  \"Now need our way must turn few steps apart,  Far as to that ill beast, who couches there.\"    Thereat toward the right our downward course  We shap'd, and, better to escape the flame  And burning marle, ten paces on the verge  Proceeded.  Soon as we to him arrive,  A little further on mine eye beholds  A tribe of spirits, seated on the sand  Near the wide chasm.  Forthwith my master spake:  \"That to the full thy knowledge may extend  Of all this round contains, go now, and mark  The mien these wear: but hold not long discourse.  Till thou returnest, I with him meantime  Will parley, that to us he may vouchsafe  The aid of his strong shoulders.\"  Thus alone  Yet forward on the extremity I pac'd  Of that seventh circle, where the mournful tribe  Were seated.  At the eyes forth gush'd their pangs.  Against the vapours and the torrid soil  Alternately their shifting hands they plied.  Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply  Their jaws and feet by turns, when bitten sore  By gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round.    Noting the visages of some, who lay  Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire,  One of them all I knew not; but perceiv'd,  That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch  With colours and with emblems various mark'd,  On which it seem'd as if their eye did feed.    And when amongst them looking round I came,  A yellow purse I saw with azure wrought,  That wore a lion's countenance and port.  Then still my sight pursuing its career,  Another I beheld, than blood more red.  A goose display of whiter wing than curd.  And one, who bore a fat and azure swine  Pictur'd on his white scrip, addressed me thus:  \"What dost thou in this deep?  Go now and know,  Since yet thou livest, that my neighbour here  Vitaliano on my left shall sit.  A Paduan with these Florentines am I.  Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming  'O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch  With the three beaks will bring!'\"  This said, he writh'd  The mouth, and loll'd the tongue out, like an ox  That licks his nostrils.  I, lest longer stay  He ill might brook, who bade me stay"]]]
