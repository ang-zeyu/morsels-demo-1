Marie very rightly says: None of the older observations  by Broca and others can be accepted because they were not examined by  methods which would reveal the extent of the damage; the only cases which  should be considered as scientifically reliable are those in which a  careful examination by sections and microscopic investigation have  determined how far subcortical structures and systems of fibres uniting  various parts of the cortex in the speech zone have been damaged. Marie  maintains that the speech zone cannot be separated into these several  centres, and that destruction of Broca's convolution does not cause loss of  speech (_vide_ figs. 16, 17). There are at present two camps--those who  maintain the older views of precise cortical centres, and those who follow  Marie and insist upon a revision.    Herbert Spencer says that \"our intellectual operations are indeed mostly  confined to the auditory feelings as integrated into words and the visual  feelings as integrated into ideas of objects, their relations and their  motions.\"    Stricker by introspection and concentration of attention upon his own  speech-production came to the conclusion that the primary revival of words  was by the feeling of movements of the muscles of articulation; but there  is a fallacy here, for the more the attention is concentrated upon any  mental process the more is the expressive side brought into prominence in  consciousness. This can be explained by the fact that there is in  consequence of attention an increased outflow of innervation currents to  special lower executive centres, thence to the muscles, but every change of  tension in the speech muscles is followed by reciprocal incoming  impressions appertaining to the sense and feeling of the movement. The more  intense the sense of movement, the greater will be the effect upon  consciousness. In fact, a person who reads and thinks by articulating the  words, does so because experience has taught him that he can concentrate  his attention more perfectly; therefore his memory or understanding of the  subject read or thought of will be increased. Very many people think and  commit to memory by this method of concentrating attention; they probably  do not belong to the quick, perceptive, imaginative class, but rather to  those who have power of application and who have educated their minds by  close voluntary attention. Galton found a large proportion of the Fellows  of the Royal Society were of this motor type. But the fact that certain  individuals make use of this faculty more than others does not destroy the  arguments in favour of the primary revival of words in the great majority  of persons by a subconscious process in the auditory centre, which is  followed immediately by correlated revival of sensori-motor images.  Although the sensori-motor images of speech can be revived, it is almost  impossible without moving the hand to revive kinaesthetic impressions  concerned in writing a word. Both Ballet and Stricker admit this fact, and  it tends to prove that the sense of hearing is the primary incitation to  speech.    Charcot in reference to the interpretation of speech defects divided  persons into four classes--auditives, visuals, motors, and indifferents.  There are really no separate classes, but only different kinds of  word-memory in different degrees of excellence as regards the first three;  and as regards the fourth there is no one kind of memory developed to a  preponderating degree. Bastian doubts the second class, but does not deny  that the visual type may exist; for Galton has undoubtedly shown that  visual memory and power of recall of visual word images varies immensely in  different individuals, and it is unquestionable that certain individuals  possess the visualising faculty to an extraordinary degree; some few,  moreover, can see mentally every word that is uttered; they give their  attention to the visual symbolic equivalent and not to the auditory. Such  persons may, as Ribot supposes, habitually think and represent objects by  visual typographic images. Lord Macaulay and Sir James Paget were notable  possessors of this visualising faculty. The former is said to have been  able to read a column of \"The Times\" and repeat it _verbatim_; the latter  could deliver his lectures _verbatim_ as he had written them. Both saw  mentally the print or MS. in front of them.    Nevertheless it is a question of degree how much motor images enter into  silent thought and into the primary revival of words in different  individuals. Mach in \"Analysis of Sensations\" says: \"It is true that in my  own case words (of which I think) reverberate loudly in my ear. Moreover, I  have no doubt that thoughts may be directly excited by the ringing of a  house-bell, by the whistle of a locomotive, etc., that small children and  even dogs understand words which they cannot repeat. Nevertheless I have  been convinced by Stricker that the ordinary and most familiar, though not  the only possible way, by which speech is comprehended is really _motor_  and that we should be badly off if we were without it. I can cite  corroborations of this view from my own experience. I frequently see  strangers who are endeavouring to follow my remarks slightly moving their  lips.\"          THE PRIMARY SITE OF REVIVAL OF WORDS IN SILENT THOUGHT      Since destructive lesions of the speech zone of the left hemisphere in  right-handed persons leads to inability to revive the memory pictures of  the sounds of words as heard in ordinary speech, the revival of visual  impressions as seen in printed or written characters, and of the  kinaesthetic (sense of movement) impressions concerned with the alterations  of the minute tensions of the muscle structures employed in the  articulation of words, it must be presumed that the left hemisphere in  right-handed persons is dominant in speech and silent thought; it may even  dominate the use of the left hand for many movements. But does not the  right hemisphere take a part? Yes; and I will give my reasons later for  supposing that the whole brain is in action. During the voluntary recall of  words in speech and thought by virtue of the intimate association tracts  connecting the grey matter of the whole speech zone, it is not a single  part of this zone which is in action, but the whole of it; and when we  assign to definite parts of the speech zone different functions in  connection with language, we really refer to areas in which the process is  most active or is primarily initiated, for the whole brain is in action  just as it is in the recognition of an object which we see, hear, feel, or  move. What really comes before us is contributed more by the mind itself  than by the present object.    There is, however, a direct functional association between the auditory and  glosso-kinaesthetic (sense of movement of the tongue) centres on the one  hand and the visual and cheiro-kinaesthetic (sense of movement of the hand)  on the other. No less intimate must be the connection between the auditory  word-centre and the visual word-centre; they must necessarily be called  into association actively in successive units of time, as in reading aloud  or writing from dictation. Educated deaf mutes think with revived visual  symbols either of lips or fingers. Words are to a great extent symbols  whereby we carry on thought, and thinking becomes more elaborate and  complex as we rise in the scale of civilisation, because more and more are  verbal symbols instituted for concrete visual images.    In which portion of the brain are words primarily and principally revived  during the process of thinking? I have already alluded to the views of  Stricker and those who follow him, viz. that words are the revived images  of the feelings of the sense of movement, caused by the alteration in the  tension of the muscles of articulation occurring during speech, with or  without phonation. There is another which I think the correct view, that  words are revived in thought primarily as auditory images, so that the  sense of hearing is essential for articulation as well as phonation; the  two operations of the vocal organ as an instrument of the mind being  inseparable. The arguments in favour of this are:--    1. The part of the brain concerned with the sense of hearing develops  earlier and the nerve fibres found in this situation are myelinated[1] at  an earlier period of development of the brain than the portion connected  with the sense of movement of the muscles of articulation.    [Footnote 1: The covering of the fibres by a sheath of phosphoretted fat  serving to insulate the conductile portion of the nerve is an indication  that the fibre has commenced to function as a conductor of nervous  impulses.]    2. As a rule, the child's first ideas of language come through the sense of  hearing; articulate speech is next evolved, in fact the child speaks only  that which it has heard; it learns first to repeat the names of persons and  objects with which it comes into relation, associating visual images with  auditory symbols.    An example of this was communicated by Darwin to Romanes. One of his  children who was just beginning to speak, called a duck a \"quack.\" By an  appreciation of the resemblance of qualities it next extended the term  \"quack\" to denote all birds and insects on the one hand, and all fluid  objects on the other. Lastly, by a still more delicate appreciation of  resemblance the child called all coins \"quack\" because on the back of a  French sou it had seen the representation of an eagle (Romanes' \"Mental  Evolution in Man,\" p. 183). Later on, children who have been educated  acquire a knowledge of the application of visual symbols, and how to  represent them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13117"],[0,"The Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds, Volume 1 (#11)"],[1,"richly coloured than in the  first nest. Both nests were at about 7000 feet elevation, and in both  instances the bird sat very close.\"    The eggs of this species are, as might be expected, very similar to  those of _G. lanceolatus_, but they are perhaps slightly larger, and  the markings somewhat coarser. The eggs are rather broad ovals, a  good deal pointed towards one end. The ground-colour is pale greenish  white, and they are pretty finely freckled and speckled (most densely  so towards the large end, where the markings are almost confluent)  with dull, rather pale, olive-brown, amongst which a little speckling  and clouding of pale greyish purple is observable. The eggs are  decidedly smaller than those of the English Jay, and few of the  specimens I have exhibit any of those black hair-like lines often  noticeable in both the English Jay and _G. lanceolatus_.    In length the eggs that I have measured varied from 1.1 to 1.21, and  in breadth they only varied from 0.84 to 0.87.      27. Nucifraga hemispila, Vigors. _The Himalayan Nutcracker_.    Nucifraga hemispila, _Vig., Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 304; _Hume, Rough  Draft N. & E._ no. 666.    The Himalayan Nutcracker is _very_ common in the fir-clad hills north  of Simla, where it particularly affects forests of the so-called  pencil cedar, which is, I think, the _Pinus excelsa_. I have never  been able to obtain the eggs, for they must lay in March or early in  April; but I have found the nest near Fagoo early in May with nearly  full-fledged young ones, and my people have taken them with young in  April below the Jalouri Pass.    The tree where I found the nest is, or rather _was_ (for the whole  hill-slope has been denuded for potatoe cultivation), situated on a  steeply sloping hill facing the south, at an elevation of about 6500  feet. The nest was about 50 feet from the ground, and placed on _two_  side branches just where, about 6 inches apart, they shot out of the  trunk. The nest was just like a Crow's--a broad platform of sticks,  but rather more neatly built, and with a number of green juniper twigs  with a little moss and a good deal of grey lichen intermingled. The  nest was about 11 inches across and nearly 4 inches in external  height. There was a broad, shallow, central depression 5 or 6 inches  in diameter and perhaps 2 inches in depth, of which an inch was filled  in with a profuse lining of grass and fir-needles (the long ones of  _Pinus longifolia_) and a little moss. This was found on the 11th May,  and the young, four in number, were sufficiently advanced to hop  out to the ends of the bough and half-fly half-tumble into the  neighbouring trees, when my man with much difficulty got up to the  nest.      29.

Mr. Mandelli obtained three eggs of this species from Chumbi in  Thibet; they were taken on the 8th of May from a nest under the eaves  of a high wooden house.    Though larger than those of the European Chough, they resemble them so  closely that there can be no doubt as to their authenticity.    In shape the eggs are moderately elongated ovals, very slightly  compressed towards the small end. The shell is tolerably fine and has  a slight gloss. The ground-colour is white with a faint creamy tinge,  and the whole egg is profusely spotted and striated with a pale,  somewhat yellowish brown and a very pale purplish grey. The markings  are most dense at the large end, and there, too, the largest streaks  of the grey occur.    One egg measures 1.74 by 1.2.          Subfamily PARINAE.      31.

The Indian Grey Tit breeds throughout the more wooded mountains of  the Indian Empire, wherever these attain an altitude of 5000 feet, at  elevations of from 4000 or 5000 to even (where the hills exceed this  height) 9000 feet.    In the Himalayas the breeding-season extends from the end of March to  the end of June, or even a little later, according to the season. They  have two broods--the first clutch of eggs is generally laid in the  last week of March or early in April; the second towards the end of  May or during the first half of June.    In the Nilghiris they lay from February to May, and _probably_ a  second time in September or October.    The nests are placed in holes in banks, in walls of buildings or  of terraced fields, in outhouses of dwellings or deserted huts and  houses, and in holes in trees, and very frequently in those cut in  some previous year for their own nests by Barbets and Woodpeckers.    Occasionally it builds _on_ a branch of a tree, and my friend Sir E.C.  Buck, C.S., found a nest containing six half-set eggs thus situated  on the 19th June at Gowra. It was on a \"Banj\" tree 10 feet from the  ground.    The only nest that I have myself seen in such a situation was a pretty  large pad of soft moss, slightly saucer-shaped, about 4 inches in  diameter, with a slight depression on the upper surface, which was  everywhere thinly coated with sheep's wool and the fine white silky  hair of some animal. The nest is usually a shapeless mass of downy  fur, cattle-hair, and even feathers and wool, but when on a branch is  strengthened exteriorly with moss. Even when in holes, they sometimes  round the nest into a more or less regular though shallow cup, and use  a good deal of moss or a little grass or grass-roots; but as a rule  the hairs of soft and downy fur constitute the chief material, and  this is picked out by the birds, I believe, from the dung of the  various cats, polecats, and ferrets so common in all our hills.    I have never found more than six eggs, and often smaller numbers, more  or less incubated.    Mr. Brooks tells us that the Indian Grey Tit is \"common at Almorah.  In April and May I found the nest two or three times in holes in  terrace-walls. It was composed of grass-roots and feathers, and  contained in each case nearly fully-grown young, five in number.\"    From Dhurmsala Captain Cock wrote:--\"_Parus cinereus_ built in  the walls of Dr. C.'s stables this year. When I found the nest it  contained young ones. I watched the parents flying in and out, but  to make sure put my ear to the wall and could hear the young ones  chirrupping. The nest was found in the early part of May 1869.\"    Colonel Butler writes:--\"Belgaum, 12th June, 1879. A nest built in  a hollow bamboo which supported the roof of a house in the native  infantry lines. I did not see the nest myself, as unfortunately the  old bird was captured on it, and the nest and eggs destroyed; however,  the hen bird was brought to me alive by the man who caught her, and  I saw at once, by the bare breast, that she had been sitting, and on  making enquiries the above facts were elicited. The broken egg-shells  were white thickly spotted with rusty red.    \"Belgaum, 8th June, 1880.--A nest in a hole of a tree about 7 feet  from the ground, containing five fresh eggs. The nest consisted of  a dense pad of fur (goat-hair, cow-hair, human hair, and hare's fur  mixed) with a few feathers intermixed, laid on the top of a small  quantity of dry grass and moss, which formed the foundation.\"    Lieut. H.E. Barnes notes from Chaman in Afghanistan:--\"This Tit is  very common, and remains with us all the year round. I found a nest on  the 10th April, built in a hole in a tree; it was composed entirely of  sheep's wool, and contained three incubated eggs, white, with light  red blotches, forming a zone at the larger end. They measured .69 by  .48.\"    Mr. Benjamin Aitken says:--    \"When I was in Poona, in the hot season of 1873, the Grey Tits, which  are very common there, became exceedingly busy about the end of May,  courting with all their spirit, and examining every hole they could  find. One was seen to disappear up the mouth of a cannon at the  arsenal. Finally, in July, two nests with young birds were discovered,  one by myself, and one by my brother. The nests were in the roofs of  houses, and were not easily accessible, but the parent birds were  watched assiduously carrying food to the hungry brood, which kept up a  screaming almost equal to that of a nest of minahs. On the 27th July a  young one was picked up that had escaped too soon from a third nest.  The Indian Grey Tit does not occur in Bombay, and I never saw it in  Berar.\"    Speaking of Southern India Mr. Davison remarks that \"the Grey Tit  breeds in holes either of trees or banks; when it builds in trees  it very often (whenever it can apparently) takes possession of the  deserted nest-hole of _Megaloema viridis_; when in banks a rat-hole is  not uncommonly chosen. All the nests I have ever seen or taken were  composed in every single instance of fur obtained from the dried  droppings of wild cats.\"    From Kotagherry, Miss Cockburn sends the following interesting note:--    \"Their nests are found in deep holes in earth-banks, and sometimes in  stone walls. Once a pair took possession of a bamboo in one of our  thatched out-houses--the safest place they could have chosen, as no  hand could get into the small hole by which they entered. These Tits  show great affection and care for their young. While hatching their  eggs, if a hand or stick is put into the nest they rise with enlarged  throats, and, hissing like a snake, peck at it till it is withdrawn.  On one occasion I told my horse-keeper to put his hand into a hole  into which I had seen one of these birds enter. He did so, but soon  drew it out with a scream, saying a 'snake had bit him.' I told him  to try again, but with no better success; he would not attempt it the  third time, so the nest was left with the bold little proprietor, who  no doubt rejoiced to find she had succeeded in frightening away the  unwelcome intruder.
