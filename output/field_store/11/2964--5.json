He's got a work to do--if the minister'll let  him do it. And if the minister don't let him do it, then I wouldn't be  in that minister's shoes when he comes to the judgment--no, I'd rather  be in my own. It's an awful thing to cross the purposes of the Almighty,  either in your own life or anybody else's. Sometimes I think it's what's  meant by the unpardonable sin--ay, that I do!\"    Carmody people never asked what old Abel meant. They had long ago given  up such vain questioning. When a man had lived as old Abel had lived for  the greater part of his life, was it any wonder he said crazy things?  And as for hinting that Mr. Leonard, a man who was really almost  too good to live, was guilty of any sin, much less an unpardonable  one--well, there now! what use was it to be taking any account of old  Abel's queer speeches? Though, to be sure, there was no great harm in  a fiddle, and maybe Mr. Leonard was a mite too strict that way with the  child. But then, could you wonder at it? There was his father, you see.    Felix finally lowered the violin, and came back to old Abel's kitchen  with a long sigh. Old Abel smiled drearily at him--the smile of a man  who has been in the hands of the tormentors.    \"It's awful the way you play--it's awful,\" he said with a shudder. \"I  never heard anything like it--and you that never had any teaching since  you were nine years old, and not much practice, except what you could  get here now and then on my old, battered fiddle. And to think you make  it up yourself as you go along! I suppose your grandfather would never  hear to your studying music--would he now?\"    Felix shook his head.    \"I know he wouldn't, Abel. He wants me to be a minister. Ministers are  good things to be, but I'm afraid I can't be a minister.\"    \"Not a pulpit minister. There's different kinds of ministers, and each  must talk to men in his own tongue if he's going to do 'em any real  good,\" said old Abel meditatively. \"YOUR tongue is music. Strange that  your grandfather can't see that for himself, and him such a broad-minded  man! He's the only minister I ever had much use for. He's God's own if  ever a man was. And he loves you--yes, sir, he loves you like the apple  of his eye.\"    \"And I love him,\" said Felix warmly. \"I love him so much that I'll even  try to be a minister for his sake, though I don't want to be.\"    \"What do you want to be?\"    \"A great violinist,\" answered the child, his ivory-hued face suddenly  warming into living rose. \"I want to play to thousands--and see their  eyes look as yours do when I play. Sometimes your eyes frighten me, but  oh, it's a splendid fright! If I had father's violin I could do better.  I remember that he once said it had a soul that was doing purgatory for  its sins when it had lived on earth. I don't know what he meant, but it  did seem to me that HIS violin was alive. He taught me to play on it as  soon as I was big enough to hold it.\"    \"Did you love your father?\" asked old Abel, with a keen look.    Again Felix crimsoned; but he looked straightly and steadily into his  old friend's face.    \"No,\" he said, \"I didn't; but,\" he added, gravely and deliberately, \"I  don't think you should have asked me such a question.\"    It was old Abel's turn to blush. Carmody people would not have believed  he could blush; and perhaps no living being could have called that  deepening hue into his weather-beaten cheek save only this gray-eyed  child of the rebuking face.    \"No, I guess I shouldn't,\" he said. \"But I'm always making mistakes.  I've never made anything else. That's why I'm nothing more than 'Old  Abel' to the Carmody people. Nobody but you and your grandfather ever  calls me 'Mr. Blair.' Yet William Blair at the store up there, rich and  respected as he is, wasn't half as clever a man as I was when we started  in life: you mayn't believe that, but it's true. And the worst of it is,  young Felix, that most of the time I don't care whether I'm Mr. Blair or  old Abel. Only when you play I care. It makes me feel just as a look I  saw in a little girl's eyes some years ago made me feel. Her name was  Anne Shirley and she lived with the Cuthberts down at Avonlea. We got  into a conversation at Blair's store. She could talk a blue streak  to anyone, that girl could. I happened to say about something that it  didn't matter to a battered old hulk of sixty odd like me. She looked  at me with her big, innocent eyes, a little reproachful like, as if I'd  said something awful heretical. 'Don't you think, Mr. Blair,' she says,  'that the older we get the more things ought to matter to us?'--as grave  as if she'd been a hundred instead of eleven. 'Things matter SO much to  me now,' she says, clasping her hands thisaway, 'and I'm sure that when  I'm sixty they'll matter just five times as much to me.' Well, the  way she looked and the way she spoke made me feel downright ashamed of  myself because things had stopped mattering with me. But never mind all  that. My miserable old feelings don't count for much. What come of your  father's fiddle?\"    \"Grandfather took it away when I came here. I think he burned it. And I  long for it so often.\"    \"Well, you've always got my old brown fiddle to come to when you must.\"    \"Yes, I know. And I'm glad for that. But I'm hungry for a violin all the  time. And I only come here when the hunger gets too much to bear. I  feel as if I oughtn't to come even then--I'm always saying I won't do it  again, because I know grandfather wouldn't like it, if he knew.\"    \"He has never forbidden it, has he?\"    \"No, but that is because he doesn't know I come here for that. He never  thinks of such a thing. I feel sure he WOULD forbid it, if he knew. And  that makes me very wretched. And yet I HAVE to come. Mr. Blair, do you  know why grandfather can't bear to have me play on the violin? He loves  music, and he doesn't mind my playing on the organ, if I don't neglect  other things. I can't understand it, can you?\"    \"I have a pretty good idea, but I can't tell you. It isn't my secret.  Maybe he'll tell you himself some day. But, mark you, young Felix, he  has got good reasons for it all. Knowing what I know, I can't blame him  over much, though I think he's mistaken. Come now, play something more  for me before you go--something that's bright and happy this time, so  as to leave me with a good taste in my mouth. That last thing you played  took me straight to heaven,--but heaven's awful near to hell, and at the  last you tipped me in.\"    \"I don't understand you,\" said Felix, drawing his fine, narrow black  brows together in a perplexed frown.    \"No--and I wouldn't want you to. You couldn't understand unless you was  an old man who had it in him once to do something and be a MAN, and just  went and made himself a devilish fool. But there must be something in  you that understands things--all kinds of things--or you couldn't put it  all into music the way you do. How do you do it? How in--how DO you do  it, young Felix?\"    \"I don't know. But I play differently to different people. I don't know  how that is. When I'm alone with you I have to play one way; and  when Janet comes over here to listen I feel quite another way--not so  thrilling, but happier and lonelier. And that day when Jessie Blair was  here listening I felt as if I wanted to laugh and sing--as if the violin  wanted to laugh and sing all the time.\"    The strange, golden gleam flashed through old Abel's sunken eyes.    \"God,\" he muttered under his breath, \"I believe the boy can get into  other folk's souls somehow, and play out what HIS soul sees there.\"    \"What's that you say?\" inquired Felix, petting his fiddle.    \"Nothing--never mind--go on. Something lively now, young Felix. Stop  probing into my soul, where you haven't no business to be, you infant,  and play me something out of your own--something sweet and happy and  pure.\"    \"I'll play the way I feel on sunshiny mornings, when the birds are  singing and I forget I have to be a minister,\" said Felix simply.        A witching, gurgling, mirthful strain, like mingled bird and brook song,  floated out on the still air, along the path where the red and golden  maple leaves were falling very softly, one by one. The Reverend Stephen  Leonard heard it, as he came along the way, and the Reverend Stephen  Leonard smiled. Now, when Stephen Leonard smiled, children ran to him,  and grown people felt as if they looked from Pisgah over to some fair  land of promise beyond the fret and worry of their care-dimmed earthly  lives.    Mr. Leonard loved music, as he loved all things beautiful, whether in  the material or the spiritual world, though he did not realize how much  he loved them for their beauty alone, or he would have been shocked and  remorseful. He himself was beautiful. His figure was erect and youthful,  despite seventy years. His face was as mobile and charming as a woman's,  yet with all a man's tried strength and firmness in it, and his dark  blue eyes flashed with the brilliance of one and twenty; even his silken  silvery hair could not make an old man of him. He was worshipped by  everyone who knew him, and he was, in so far as mortal man may be,  worthy of that worship.    \"Old Abel is amusing himself with his violin again,\" he thought. \"What  a delicious thing he is playing! He has quite a gift for the violin. But  how can he play such a thing as that,--a battered old hulk of a man who  has, at one time or another, wallowed in almost every sin to which human  nature can sink? He was on one of his sprees three days ago--the  first one for over a year--lying dead-drunk in the market square in  Charlottetown among the dogs; and now he is playing something that only  a young archangel on the hills of heaven ought to be able to play. Well,  it will make my task all the easier.

Crochet three rows  of one color, then mark the rug off into four parts, placing a pin to  mark each section or quarter of the rug. At each of four points  crochet one stitch of a contrasting shade. Crochet once around the  circle, using a shade similar to that of the centre of rug for design,  filling in between with the other shade. For the following row,  crochet two stitches beneath the one stitch (not directly underneath  the stitch, but one stitch beyond), filling in between with the other  color. The third row, add three stitches beneath the two stitches in  same manner as preceding row, and continue, until design in centre is  as large as desired, then crochet 'Hit or Miss' or stripes. Do not cut  off the carpet rags at each of the four points after crocheting  stitches, but allow each one to remain and crochet over them, then  pick up on needle and crochet every time you require stitches of  contrasting shade. Then crochet several rows around the rug with  different shades until rug is the required size. The under side should  be finished off as neatly as the right, or upper side. Mary, when not  making a design, sew the rags together as if for weaving carpet. When  crocheting circular rugs, occasionally stretch the outside row to  prevent the rug from curling up at edges when finished, as it would be  apt to do if too tightly crocheted. If necessary, occasionally add an  extra stitch. Avoid also crocheting it too loosely, as it would then  appear like a ruffle. The advantage of crocheting over a heavy cord is  that the work may be easily drawn up more tightly if too lose.\"          CHAPTER XII.    MARY IMITATES NAVAJO BLANKETS.      On her return from an afternoon spent at Professor Schmidt's, Mary  remarked to Aunt Sarah, \"For the first time in my life I have an  original idea!\"    \"Do tell me child, what it is!\"    \"The 'New Colonial' rag rugs we have lately finished are fine, but I'd  just love to have a Navajo blanket like those owned by Professor  Schmidt; and I intend to make a rag rug in imitation of his Navajo  blanket.\"    \"Yes,\" answered her Aunt, \"I have always greatly admired them myself,  especially the large gray one which covers the Professor's own chair  in the library. The Professor brought them with him when he returned  from 'Cutler's Ranch' at Rociada, near Las Vegas, New Mexico, where he  visited his nephew, poor Raymond, or rather, I should say, fortunate  Raymond, an only child of the Professor's sister. A quiet, studious  boy, he graduated at the head of his class at an early age, but he  inherited the weak lungs of his father, who died of consumption.  Raymond was a lovable boy, with a fund of dry humor and wit--the idol  of his mother, who, taking the advice of a specialist, accompanied her  boy, as a last resort, to New Mexico, where, partly owing to his  determination to get well, proper food and daily rides on the mesa, on  the back of his little pinto pony, he regained perfect health, and  today is well, happily married and living in Pasadena, California, so  I have been told by Frau Schmidt, who dearly loves the boy.\"    \"But Mary, forgive an old woman for rambling away from the subject in  which you are interested--Navajo blankets. Ever since we planned to  make a rug with a swastika in the centre, I nave been trying to evolve  from my brain (and your Uncle John says my bump of inventiveness is  abnormally large) a Navajo rag rug for the floor of the room you  intend to furnish as Ralph's den, in the home you are planning. Well,  my dear, a wooden crochet hook in your deft fingers will be the magic  wand which will perform a miracle and transform into Navajo blankets  such very commonplace articles as your discarded gray eiderdown  kimona, and a pair of your Uncle's old gray trousers, which have  already been washed and ripped by Sibylla, to be used for making  carpet rags. These, combined with the gray skirt I heard you say had  outlived its day of usefulness, will furnish the background of the  rug. The six triangles in the centre of the rug, also lighter stripes  at each end of the rug, we will make of that old linen chair-cover and  your faded linen skirt, which you said I might use for carpet rags;  and, should more material be needed, I have some old, gray woolen  underwear in my patch bag, a gray-white, similar to the real Navajo.  The rows of black with which we shall outline the triangles may be  made from those old, black, silk-lisle hose you gave me, by cutting  them round and round in one continuous strip. Heavy cloth should be  cut in _very_ narrow strips. Sibylla will do that nicely; her hands  are more used to handling large, heavy shears than are yours. The  linen-lawn skirt you may cut in strips about three-fourths of an inch  in width, as that material is quite thin. I would sew rags of one  color together like carpet rags, not lapping the ends more than  necessary to hold them together. The rug will be reversible, both  sides being exactly alike when finished. I should make the rug about  fifty-three stitches across. This will require about six and  one-fourth yards of carpet rags, when sewed together, to crochet once  across. I think it would be wise to cut all rags of different weight  materials before commencing to crochet the rug, so they may be well  mixed through. I will assist you with the work at odd moments, and in  a short time the rug will be finished.\"    The rug, when finished, was truly a work of art, and represented many  hours of labor and thought. But Mary considered it very fascinating  work, and was delighted with the result of her labor--a rug the exact  imitation of one of the Professor's genuine Indian Navajo blankets,  the work of her own hands, and without the expenditure of a penny.    Mary remarked: \"I do not think all the triangles in my rug are the  exact size of the paper pattern you made me, Aunt Sarah. The two in  the centre appear larger than the others.\"    \"Well,\" remarked her Aunt, \"if you examine closely the blankets owned  by Professor Schmidt, you will find the on the ones woven by Navajo  Indians are not of an equal size.\"    'Tis said Navajo blankets and Serapes will become scarce and higher in  price in the future, on account of the numerous young Indians who have  been educated and who prefer other occupations to that of weaving  blankets, as did their forefathers; and the present disturbance in  Mexico will certainly interfere with the continuance of this industry  for a time.    [Illustration: IMITATION OF NAVAJO BLANKET]    [Illustration: RUG WITH DESIGN]    \"Mary, while you have been planning your Navajo rug, I have been  thinking how we may make a very attractive as well as useful rug. You  remember, we could not decide what use to make of your old, tan  cravenette stormcoat? I have been thinking we might use this, when  cut into carpet rags, for the principal part of the rug, and that old,  garnet merino blouse waist might be cut and used for the four corners  of a rug, and we might have gay stripes in the centre of the rug to  form a sort of design, and also put gay stripes at each end of the  rug.    \"And you might crochet a rug, plain 'Hit or Miss,' of rather  bright-colored rags.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mary, \"I think I will crochet a swastika in the centre of  a rug, as you suggest, of bright orange, outlined with black, and a  stripe of orange edged with black at each end of the rug to match the  centre. Don't you think that would be pretty, Aunt Sarah?\"    [Illustration: \"HIT-OR-MISS\" RUG WITH SWASTIKA CENTRE]    \"Yes indeed, but Mary, don't you think the swastika would show more  distinctly on a rug with a plain background?\"    \"Perhaps it would,\" replied Mary, \"but I think I'll crochet one of  very gayly-colored rags, with a swastika in the centre.\"    [Illustration: A \"PRAYER RUG\" OF SILK SCRAPS.]    \"Aunt Sarah,\" said Mary, \"do tell me how that pretty little rug  composed of silk scraps is made.\"    \"Oh, that _silk_ rug; 'twas given me by Aunt Cornelia, who finished it  while here on a visit from New York. I never saw another like it, and  it has been greatly admired. Although possessed of an ordinary amount  of patience, I don't think I'll ever make one for myself. I don't  admire knitted rugs of any description, neither do I care for braided  rugs. I think the crocheted ones prettier. But, Mary, this small silk  rug is easily made should you care to have one. I will commence  knitting one for you at once. You will then find a use for the box of  bright-colored silks you possess, many of which are quite too small to  be used in any other manner. Professor Schmidt calls this a 'Prayer  Rug.' He said: 'This rug, fashioned of various bright-hued silks of  orange, purple and crimson, a bright maze of rich colors, without any  recognizable figure or design, reminds me of the description of the  'Prayer Carpet' or rugs of the Mohammedans. They are composed of  rich-hued silks of purple, ruby and amber. 'Tis said their delicacy of  shade is marvelous and was suggested by the meadows of variegated  flowers.' But this is a digression; you wished directions for making  the rug.    \"Use tiny scraps of various bright-hued silks, velvets and satins, cut  about 3-1/2 inches long and about one-half inch in width. Ends should  always be cut slanting or bias; never straight. All you will require  besides the silk scraps, will be a ball of common cord or twine, or  save all cord which comes tied around packages, as I do, and use that  and two ordinary steel knitting needles."]]]
