Let your baths be performed with women, whose      behavior is modest towards you.\" (Cyprian, _De Habitu Virginum_,      cap. 19, 21.) The Church carried the same spirit among the      barbarians of northern Europe, and several centuries later the      promiscuous bathing of men and women was prohibited in some of      the Penitentials. (The custom was, however, preserved here and      there in Northern Europe, even to the end of the eighteenth      century, or later. In Rudeck's _Geschichte der oeffentlichen      Sittlichkeit in Deutschland_, an interesting chapter, with      contemporary illustrations, is devoted to this custom; also, Max      Bauer, _Das Geschlechtsleben in der Deutschen Vergangenheit_, pp.      216-265.)        \"Women,\" says Clement again, \"should not seek to be graceful by      avoiding broad drinking vessels that oblige them to stretch their      mouths, in order to drink from narrow alabastra that cause them      indecently to throw back the head, revealing to men their necks      and breasts. The mere thought of what she is ought to inspire a      woman with modesty.... On no account must a woman be permitted to      show to a man any portion of her body naked, for fear lest both      fall: the one by gazing eagerly, the other by delighting to      attract those eager glances.\" (_Paedagogus_, Book II, Chapter V.)        James, Bishop of Nisibis, in the fourth century, was a man of      great holiness. We are told by Thedoret that once, when James had      newly come into Persia, it was vouchsafed to him to perform a      miracle under the following circumstances: He chanced to pass by      a fountain where young women were washing their linen, and, his      modesty being profoundly shocked by the exposure involved in this      occupation, he cursed the fountain, which instantly dried up, and      he changed the hair of the girls from black to a sandy color.      (Jortin, _Remarks on Ecclesiastical History_, vol. iii, p. 4.)        Procopius, writing in the sixth century after Christ, and      narrating how the Empress Theodora, in early life, would often      appear almost naked before the public in the theatre, adds that      she would willingly have appeared altogether nude, but that \"no      woman is allowed to expose herself altogether, unless she wears      at least short drawers over the lower part of the abdomen.\"      Chrysostom mentions, at the end of the fourth century, that      Arcadius attempted to put down the August festival (Majuma),      during which women appeared naked in the theatres, or swimming in      large baths.        In mediaeval days, \"ladies, at all events, as represented by the      poets, were not, on the whole, very prudish. Meleranz surprised a      lady who was taking a bath under a lime tree; the bath was      covered with samite, and by it was a magnificent ivory bed,      surrounded by tapestries representing the history of Paris and      Helen, the destruction of Troy, the adventures of AEneas, etc. As      Meleranz rides by, the lady's waiting-maids run away; she      herself, however, with quick decision, raises the samite which      covers the tub, and orders him to wait on her in place of the      maids. He brings her shift and mantle, and shoes, and then stands      aside till she is dressed; when she has placed herself on the      bed, she calls him back and commands him to drive away the flies      while she sleeps. Strange to say, the men are represented as more      modest than the women. When two maidens prepared a bath for      Parzival, and proposed to bathe him, according to custom, the      inexperienced young knight was shy, and would not enter the bath      until they had gone; on another occasion, he jumped quickly into      bed when the maidens entered the room. When Wolfdieterich was      about to undress, he had to ask the ladies who pressed around him      to leave him alone for a short time, as he was ashamed they      should see him naked. When Amphons of Spain, bewitched by his      step-mother into a were-wolf, was at last restored, and stood      suddenly naked before her, he was greatly ashamed. The maiden who      healed Iwein was tender of his modesty. In his love-madness, the      hero wanders for a time naked through the wood; three women find      him asleep, and send a waiting-maid to annoint him with salve;      when he came to himself, the maiden hid herself. On the whole,      however, the ladies were not so delicate; they had no hesitation      in bathing with gentlemen, and on these occasions would put their      finest ornaments on their heads. I know no pictures of the      twelfth and thirteenth centuries representing such a scene, but      such baths in common are clearly represented in miniatures of the      fifteenth century.\" (A. Schultz, _Das Hoefische Leben zur Zeit der      Minnesaenger_, vol. i, p. 225.)        \"In the years 1450-70, the use of the cod-piece was introduced,      whereby the attributes of manhood were accentuated in the most      shameless manner. It was, in fact, the avowed aim at that period      to attract attention to these parts. The cod-piece was sometimes      colored differently from the rest of the garments, often stuffed      out to enlarge it artificially, and decorated with ribbons.\"      (Rudeck, _Geschichte der oeffentlichen Sittlichkeit in      Deutschland_, pp. 45-48; Dufour, _Histoire de la Prostitution_,      vol. vi, pp. 21-23. Groos refers to the significance of this      fashion, _Spiele der Menschen_, p. 337.)        \"The first shirt began to be worn [in Germany] in the sixteenth      century. From this fact, as well as from the custom of public      bathing, we reach the remarkable result, that for the German      people, the sight of complete nakedness was the daily rule up to      the sixteenth century. Everyone undressed completely before going      to bed, and, in the vapor-baths, no covering was used. Again, the      dances, both of the peasants and the townspeople, were      characterized by very high leaps into the air. It was the chief      delight of the dancers for the male to raise his partner as high      as possible in the air, so that her dress flew up. That feminine      modesty was in this respect very indifferent, we know from      countless references made in the fifteenth and sixteenth      centuries. It must not be forgotten that throughout the middle      ages women wore no underclothes, and even in the seventeenth      century, the wearing of drawers by Italian women was regarded as      singular. That with the disappearance of the baths, and the use      of body-linen, a powerful influence was exerted on the creation      of modesty, there can be little doubt.\" (Rudeck, op. cit., pp.      57, 399, etc.)        In 1461, when Louis XI entered Paris, three very beautiful      maidens, quite naked, represented the Syrens, and declaimed poems      before him; they were greatly admired by the public. In 1468,      when Charles the Bold entered Lille, he was specially pleased,      among the various festivities, with a representation of the      Judgment of Paris, in which the three goddesses were nude. When      Charles the Fifth entered Antwerp, the most beautiful maidens of      the city danced before him, in nothing but gauze, and were      closely contemplated by Duerer, as he told his friend, Melancthon.      (B. Ritter, \"Nuditaeten im Mittelalter,\" _Jahrbuecher fuer      Wissenschaft und Kunst_, 1855, p. 227; this writer shows how      luxury, fashion, poverty, and certain festivals, all combined to      make nudity familiar; cf. Fahne, _Der Carneval_, p. 249. Dulaure      quotes many old writers concerning the important part played by      nude persons in ancient festivals, _Des Divinites Generatrices_,      Chapter XIV.)        Passek, a Polish officer who wrote an account of his campaigns,      admired the ladies of Denmark in 1658, but considered their      customs immodest. \"Everyone sleeps naked as at birth, and none      consider it shameful to dress or undress before others. No      notice, even, is taken of the guest, and in the light one garment      is taken off after another, even the chemise is hung on the hook.      Then the door is bolted, the light blown out, and one goes to      bed. As we blamed their ways, saying that among us a woman would      not act so, even in the presence of her husband alone, they      replied that they knew nothing of such shame, and that there was      no need to be ashamed of limbs which God had created. Moreover,      to sleep without a shift was good, because, like the other      garments, it sufficiently served the body during the day. Also,      why take fleas and other insects to bed with one? Although our      men teased them in various ways, they would not change their      habits.\" (Passek, _Denkwuerdigkeiten_, German translation, p. 14.)        Until late in the seventeenth century, women in England, as well      as France, suffered much in childbirth from the ignorance and      superstition of incompetent midwives, owing to the prevailing      conceptions of modesty, which rendered it impossible (as it is      still, to some extent, in some semi-civilized lands) for male      physicians to attend them. Dr. Willoughby, of Derby, tells how,      in 1658, he had to creep into the chamber of a lying-in woman on      his hands and knees, in order to examine her unperceived. In      France, Clement was employed secretly to attend the mistresses of      Louis XIV in their confinements; to the first he was conducted      blindfold, while the King was concealed among the bed-curtains,      and the face of the lady was enveloped in a network of lace. (E.      Malins, \"Midwifery and Midwives,\" _British Medical Journal_, June      22, 1901; Witkowski, _Histoire des Accouchements_, 1887, pp. 689      et seq.) Even until the Revolution, the examination of women in      France"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13611"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 2 (#11)"],[1,"night; on  Sunday there might be as many as 50, for, as in Berlin and other cities  today, that was the great homosexual gala night; there were beds in every  room in this house. We are told that the \"men would sit in one another's  laps, kissing in a lewd manner and using their hands indecently. Then they  would get up, dance and make curtsies, and mimic the voices of women, 'Oh,  fie, sir,'--'Pray, sir,'--'Dear sir,'--'Lord, how can you serve me  so?'--'I swear I'll cry out,'--'You're a wicked devil,'--'And you're a  bold face,'--'Eh, ye dear little toad,'--'Come, bus.' They'd hug and play  and toy and go out by couples into another room, on the same floor, to be  'married,' as they called it.\"    On the whole one gains the impression that homosexual practices were more  prevalent in London in the eighteenth century, bearing in mind its  population at that time, than they are today.[88] It must not, however, be  supposed that the law was indulgent and its administration lax. The very  reverse was the case. The punishment for sodomy, when completely effected,  was death, and it was frequently inflicted. Homosexual intercourse,  without evidence of penetration, was regarded as \"attempt\" and was usually  punished by the pillory and a heavy fine, followed by two years'  imprisonment. Moreover, it would appear that more activity was shown by  the police in prosecution than is nowadays the case; this is, for  instance, suggested by the evidence of the detective already quoted.    To keep a homosexual resort was also a severely punishable offense. Mother  Clap was charged at the Old Bailey in 1726 with \"keeping a sodomitical  house\"; she protested that she could not herself have taken part in these  practices, but that availed her nothing; she could bring forward no  witnesses on her behalf and was condemned to pay a fine, to stand in the  pillory, and to undergo imprisonment for two years. The cases were dealt  with in a matter-of-fact way which seems to bear further witness to the  frequency of the offense, and with no effort to expend any specially  vindictive harshness on this class of offenders. If there was the  slightest doubt as to the facts, even though the balance of evidence was  against the accused, he was usually acquitted, and the man who could bring  witnesses to his general good character might often thereby escape. In  1721 a religious young man, married, was convicted of attempting sodomy  with two young men he slept with; he was fined, placed in the pillory and  imprisoned for two months. Next year a man was acquitted on a similar  charge, and another man, of decent aspect, although the evidence indicated  that he might have been guilty of sodomy, was only convicted of attempt,  and sentenced to fine, pillory, and two years' imprisonment. In 1723,  again, a schoolmaster was acquitted, on account of his good reputation, of  the charge of attempt on a boy of 15, his pupil, though the evidence  seemed decidedly against him. In 1730 a man was sentenced to death for  sodomy effected on his young apprentice; this was a bad case and the  surgeon's evidence indicated laceration of the perineum. Homosexuality of  all kinds flourished, it will be seen, notwithstanding the fearless yet  fair application of a very severe law.[89]    In more recent times Byron has frequently been referred to as experiencing  homosexual affections, and I have been informed that some of his poems  nominally addressed to women were really inspired by men. It is certain  that he experienced very strong emotions toward his male friends. \"My  school-friendships,\" he wrote, \"were with me passions.\" When he afterward  met one of these friends, Lord Clare, in Italy, he was painfully agitated;  and could never hear the name without a beating of the heart. At the age  of 22 he formed one of his strong attachments for a youth to whom he left  L7000 in his will.[90] It is probable, however, that here, as well as in  the case of Shakespeare, and in that of Tennyson's love for his youthful  friend, Arthur Hallam, as well as of Montaigne for Etienne de la Boetie,  although such strong friendships may involve an element of sexual emotion,  we have no true and definite homosexual impulse; homosexuality is merely  simulated by the ardent and hyperesthetic emotions of the poet.[91] The  same quality of the poet's emotional temperament may doubtless, also, be  invoked in the case of Goethe, who is said to have written elegies which,  on account of their homosexual character, still remain unpublished.    The most famous homosexual trial of recent times in England was that of  Oscar Wilde, a writer whose literary reputation may be said to be still  growing, not only in England but throughout the world. Wilde was the son  of parents who were both of unusual ability and somewhat eccentric. Both  these tendencies became in him more concentrated. He was born with, as it  were, a congenital antipathy to the commonplace, a natural love of  paradox, and he possessed the skill to embody the characteristic in  finished literary form. At the same time, it must not be forgotten,  beneath this natural attitude of paradox, his essential judgments on life  and literature were usually sound and reasonable. His essay on \"The Soul  of Man Under Socialism\" witnessed to his large and enlightened conception  of life, and his profound admiration for Flaubert to the sanity and  solidity of his literary taste. In early life he revealed no homosexual  tendencies; he married and had children. After he had begun to outgrow his  youthful esthetic extravagances, however, and to acquire success and fame,  he developed what was at first a simply inquisitive interest in inversion.  Such inquisitive interest is sometimes the sign of an emerging homosexual  impulse. It proved to be so in Wilde's case and ultimately he was found to  be cultivating the acquaintance of youths of low class and doubtful  character. Although this development occurred comparatively late in life,  we must hesitate to describe Wilde's homosexuality as acquired. If we  consider his constitution and his history, it is not difficult to suppose  that homosexual germs were present in a latent form from the first, and it  may quite well be that Wilde's inversion was of that kind which is now  described as retarded, though still congenital.    As is usual in England, no active efforts were made to implicate Wilde in  any criminal charge. It was his own action, as even he himself seems to  have vaguely realized beforehand, which brought the storm about his head.  He was arrested, tried, condemned, and at once there arose a general howl  of execration, joined in even by the judge, whose attitude compared  unfavorably with the more impartial attitude of the eighteenth century  judges in similar cases. Wilde came out of prison ambitious to retrieve  his reputation by the quality of his literary work. But he left Reading  gaol merely to enter a larger and colder prison. He soon realized that his  spirit was broken even more than his health. He drifted at last to Paris,  where he shortly after died, shunned by all but a few of his friends.[92]    In a writer of the first order, Edward Fitzgerald, to whom we owe the  immortal and highly individualized version of _Omar Khayyam_, it is easy  to trace an element of homosexuality, though it appears never to have  reached full and conscious development. Fitzgerald was an eccentric person  who, though rich and on friendly terms with some of the most distinguished  men of his time, was always out of harmony with his environment. He felt  himself called on to marry, very unhappily, a woman whom he had never been  in love with and with whom he had nothing in common. All his affections  were for his male friends. In early life he was devoted to his friend W.K.  Browne, whom he glorified in _Euphranor_. \"To him Browne was at once  Jonathan, Gamaliel, Apollo,--the friend, the master, the God,--there was  scarcely a limit to his devotion and admiration.\"[93] On Browne's  premature death Fitzgerald's heart was empty. In 1859 at Lowestoft,  Fitzgerald, as he wrote to Mrs. Browne, \"used to wander about the shore at  night longing for some fellow to accost me who might give some promise of  filling up a very vacant place in my heart.\" It was then that he met  \"Posh\" (Joseph Fletcher), a fisherman, 6 feet tall, said to be of the best  Suffolk type, both in body and character. Posh reminded Fitzgerald of his  dead friend Browne; he made him captain of his lugger, and was thereafter  devoted to him. Posh was, said Fitzgerald, \"a man of the finest Saxon  type, with a complexion _vif, male et flamboyant_, blue eyes, a nose less  than Roman, more than Greek, and strictly auburn hair that any woman might  envy. Further he was a man of simplicity; of soul, justice of thought,  tenderness of nature, a gentleman of Nature's grandest type,\" in fact the  \"greatest man\" Fitzgerald had ever met. Posh was not, however, quite so  absolutely perfect as this description suggests, and various  misunderstandings arose in consequence between the two friends so unequal  in culture and social traditions. These difficulties are reflected in some  of the yet extant letters from the enormous mass which Fitzgerald  addressed to \"my dear Poshy.\"[94]    A great personality of recent times, widely regarded with reverence as the  prophet-poet of Democracy[95]--Walt Whitman--has aroused discussion by his  sympathetic attitude toward passionate friendship, or \"manly love\" as he  calls it, in _Leaves of Grass_. In this book--in \"Calamus,\" \"Drumtaps,\"  and elsewhere--Whitman celebrates a friendship in which physical contact  and a kind of silent voluptuous emotion are essential elements. In order  to settle the question as to the precise significance of \"Calamus,\" J.A.  Symonds wrote to Whitman, frankly posing the question. The answer (written  from Camden, N.J., on August 19, 1890) is the only statement of Whitman's"]]]
