In these periods, weapons, implements, and ornaments are of copper  (with bronze in the 'late' period); gold occurs rarely; terra-cotta  figures are few and rude; engraved seals are cylindrical like those  of Babylonia.    Early Iron Age: wheel-made pottery, either white or bright red,  with painted geometrical ornament in black (supplemented on the white  ware with purple-red); there is also a black fabric imitating  metallic forms.    The early period (1200-1000 B.C.) marks the transition from bronze  to iron implements, with survival of Mycenaean decoration on the  pottery, and replacement of cylindrical by conical seals.    The middle period (1000-750 B.C.) has purely geometrical  decoration: terra-cotta figures are modelled rudely by hand, and  painted like the pottery.    The late period (750-500 B.C.) shows foreign influences from Greece  and from Phoenicia or Egypt, competing with and enriching the native  geometrical style. Scarab seals, blue-glaze beads, and other personal  ornaments, and silver objects, appear. Terra-cotta figures stamped in  a mould occur side by side with modelled.    Hellenic Age, with increasing influence of Greek arts and  industries.    Early or Hellenic period (500-300 B.C.): the native pottery  degenerates, and Greek vases and terra-cottas are imported and  imitated; jewellery of gold and silver is fairly common and of good  quality; with engraved seals set in signet rings: the bronze mirrors  are circular, with a handle-spike.    Middle or Hellenistic period (300-50 B.C.): the native pottery is  almost wholly replaced by imitations of forms from other parts of the  Greek world, especially from Syria and Asia Minor: large handled  wine-jars (_amphorae_) are common: terra-cottas and jewellery also  follow Greek styles: coloured stones are set in rings and ear-rings.    Late or Graeco-Roman period (50 B.C.-A.D. 400): pottery is partly  replaced by vessels of blown glass: clay lamps, red-glazed jugs, so  called 'tear-bottles' of spindle-shapes, ear-rings of beads strung on  wire, bronze rings and bracelets, circular mirrors without handles,  and bronze coins are characteristics.    Byzantine Age (after A.D. 400): Christian burial in surface graves  supersedes the use of rock-hewn tombs: funerary equipment goes out of  use, except a few personal ornaments, which are of mean appearance,  and may bear Christian symbols. Domestic pottery is coarse,  ungraceful, and frequently ribbed on the outside. Clay lamps have  long nozzles, and Christian symbols. Glass becomes clumsy and less  common; and glazed bowls and cups come into use. Occasional rich  finds of silver plate (salvers, cups, spoons, &c.) and personal  ornaments, have been made among Byzantine ruins.    On mediaeval and later sites, various glazed fabrics of pottery are  found, and occasionally examples of the glazed and painted jugs,  plates, and tiles known to collectors as 'Rhodian' or 'Damascus'  ware.    Inscriptions  occur on settlement-sites, in sanctuaries and associated with tombs:  usually cut on slabs or blocks of soft limestone, though marble and  other harder stones were used in Hellenistic and Roman times. Besides  the ordinary Greek (see Illustration IV), and Roman alphabets the  Phoenician alphabet (see Illustrations X and XI) was in use at Kition  (Larnaca), in the great sanctuaries at Idalion (Dali), and  occasionally elsewhere; and from early times until the fourth century  a syllabary peculiar to Cyprus, often very rudely hewn, in irregular  lines, on ill-shaped blocks. Such 'Cypriote inscriptions' (see  accompanying Illustration VII) are of great value and interest, and  have been often overlooked among building material drawn from old  sites. In all doubtful cases, a 'squeeze' should be made by one of  the methods described in the first part of this volume and submitted  to the Keeper of Antiquities. The stamped inscriptions on the handles  of wine-jars are worth preserving, as evidence for the course of  trade.    Coins  were issued in Cyprus from the sixth century onward; first in silver;  later (in the fourth century B.C.) occasionally in gold, and from the  fourth century commonly in copper. A Ptolemaic coinage succeeded in  the third century that of the local rulers; the Roman coinage, with  inscriptions sometimes in Greek, sometimes in Latin, lasts from  Augustus to the beginning of the third century. Coins of the  Byzantine Emperors and of the Lusignan Kings are common.    [ILLUSTRATION VII: BILINGUAL (GREEK AND CYPRIOTE) DEDICATION TO  DEMETER AND PERSEPHONE FROM CURIUM.]           CHAPTER V       CENTRAL AND NORTH SYRIA    [See the diagrams of flint implements, Illustration II; of pottery  and weapons, &c., VIII & IX; of alphabets, X & XI.]    The following notes are to be accepted as only a rough and imperfect  guide, since no part of Syria, north of Palestine, has been widely or  minutely explored, and the archaeology of the earliest period, in  Central Syria, for example, is almost unknown.    The periods into which the archaeological history of Syria should be  divided are roughly, as follows:        I. Neolithic and Chalcolithic Age, to about 2000 B.C.     II. Bronze Age or Early Hittite, to about 1100 B.C.    III. Iron Age or Late Hittite, to about 550 B.C.     IV. Persian Period, to about 330 B.C.      V. Hellenistic Period, to about 100 B.C.     VI. Roman Period.    VII. Byzantine Period.      I. Neolithic.    No purely Neolithic sites yet known, but lowest strata of remains at  Sakjegozu and Sinjerli, on the Carchemish citadel, and in certain  kilns at Yunus near by, and also pot-burials among house remains are  of this Age. (But see Chapter VIII, Mesopotamia, whose Neolithic  period is similar.)    Stone implements:  as in Greece, including obsidian of very clear texture, probably of  inner Asiatic, not Aegean production. Bone needles and other  implements.    Pottery.  Four varieties have been observed: (1) buff ground with simple linear  decoration applied direct on the gritty body-clay in lustreless  pigments, black, chocolate-brown, or red, according to the firing;  (2) greenish-buff face, hand-polished, with polychrome varnish  decoration of vandykes and other geometric motives; (3) monochrome,  black to grey, not burnished, but sometimes decorated with incised  linear patterns; (4) plain red or buff (e.g. large urns in which  Neolithic burials were found on the Carchemish citadel). All pottery  hand-made.    Figurines:  rude clay and stone figurines are likely to occur, but have as yet  been found very rarely in Neolithic strata.    Copper implements:  traces observed at Carchemish: to be looked for.      II. Bronze Age (Early Hittite).    (a) Early period to about 1500 B.C.  Cist-graves made of rough stone slabs, near crude brick houses.  Conjunction of such slabs with bricks would be an indication of an  early Bronze Age site. Rare pot-burials survive.    Implements.  Spear-heads of long tapering form rounded sharply at the base which  has long tang (IX, Fig. 5): poker-like butts (IX, Fig. 2): knives  with curved tangs: 'toggle' pins: all bronze (but a silver toggle-pin  has been found) (IX, Figs. 1,8).    Pottery.  All wheel-made but rough: light red or buff faced of reddish clay:  decoration rare and only in simple zigzags or waves in reddish-brown  pigment: long-stemmed vases of 'champagne-glass' form are common (VIII,  Fig. 4): rarely a creamy slip is applied to the red clay.    (b) Later period.  Cist-graves apart from houses, in cemeteries.    Implements.  Long narrow celts often riveted: spear-heads, leaf-shaped or  triangular (IX, Figs. 3, 6, 10): axe-heads with socket, swelling  blade and curved cutting edge: pins both 'toggle' and unpierced,  straight and bent over.    Pottery.  Wheel-made, well potted, and commonly _ring-burnished_, the process  beginning at the base of a vase and climbing spirally: little painted  decoration: face usually dusky brown over pinkish body clay, but red  and yellow-white faced wares also found: shapes, mostly bowls, open  and half closed: ring feet, but no handles to vases: only  occasionally lug-ears (IX, Figs. 1,2,3,5,6). Rims well turned over  belong to the latest period, in which elaborate ring-burnishing is  common.    Beads, &c.  Diamond-shaped, with incised decoration, in clay or stone, common.  Pendants, &c., of shell, lapis lazuli, cornelian, crystal. Cylinders,  of rude design like Babylonian First Dynasty, in stone and bone.  Spindle-whorls in steatite and clay.    [ILLUSTRATION VIII: SYRIAN POTTERY]      III. Iron Age (Late Hittite).    To this belong the mass of 'Hittite' remains in Syria. Graves are  unlined pits, with urn burials, the corpse having been cremated.  Cylinders, &c., showing traces of fire, will belong to this Age.    Implements and weapons.  Arrow-heads of bronze: spear-heads of bronze and iron: axes, knives,  and picks of iron (miniature models occur in graves): daggers of  iron. _Fibulae_, of bronze, semicircular and triangular (as in Asia  Minor) (IX, Figs. 4, 9, 11): plain armlets of bronze: pins, spatulae,  &c., of bronze: thin applique ornaments. Bronze bowls (gilt) with  gadroon or lotus ornament (moulded) in later period. Steatite  censers, in form of a cup held by a human hand, are not uncommon (IX,  Fig. 7).    Pottery.  Tall narrow-mouthed urns, bath-shaped vessels, and bell-kraters  common (VIII, Fig. 10): trefoil-mouth _oenochoae_ and _hydriae_; also  _amphorae_ (VIII, Fig. 7).    In earlier period, white or drab slipped surface with geometric  patterns (rarely rude birds) in black. In later period, pinkish glaze  with geometric patterns in black-brown, concentric circles being a  common motive. Tripod bowls in unslipped 'kitchen' ware (VIII, Fig.  8).

He feels deeply that the religion of today  has greatly changed from the \"old time religion.\" In slavery days, the  colored people were so subjugated and uneducated that he claims they  were especially susceptible to religion, and poured out their religious  feelings in the so-called negro spirituals. Mr. Edmunds is convinced  that the superstitions of the colored people and their belief in ghosts  and gobblins is due to the fact that their emotions were worked upon by  slave drivers to keep them in subjugation. Oftentimes white people  dressed as ghosts, frightened the colored people into doing many things  under protest. The \"ghosts\" were feared far more than the slave-drivers.    The War of the Rebellion is not remembered by Mr. Edmunds, but he  clearly remembers the period following the war known as the  Reconstruction Period. The Negroes were very happy when they learned  they were free as a result of the war. A few took advantage of their  freedom immediately, but many, not knowing what else to do, remained  with their former masters. Some remained on the plantations five years  after they were free. Gradually they learned to care for themselves,  often through instructions received from their former masters, and then  they were glad to start out in the world for themselves. Of course,  there were exceptions, for the slaves who had been abused by cruel  masters were only too glad to leave their former homes.    The following reminiscense is told by Mr. Edmunds:    \"As a boy, I worked in Virginia for my master, a Mr. Farmer[TR:?]. He  had two sons who served as bosses on the farm. An elder sister was the  head boss. After the war was over, the sister called the colored people  together and told them that they were no longer slaves, that they might  leave if they wished.    \"The slaves had been watering cucumbers which had been planted around  barrels filled with soil. Holes had been bored in the barrels, and when  water was poured in the barrels, it gradually seeped out through the  holes thus watering the cucumbers.    \"After the speech, one son told the slaves to resume their work. Since I  was free, I refused to do so, and as a result, I received a terrible  kicking. I mentally resolved to get even some day. Years afterward, I  went to the home of this man for the express purpose of seeking revenge.  However, I was received so kindly, and treated so well, that all  thoughts of vengeance vanished. For years after, my former boss and I  visited each other in our own homes.\"    Mr. Edmunds states that the Negro people prefer to be referred to as  colored people, and deeply resent the name \"nigger.\"          Archie Koritz, Field Worker  Federal Writers' Project  Lake County--District #1  Gary, Indiana    EX-SLAVES  JOHN EUBANKS & FAMILY  Gary, Indiana      Gary's only surviving Civil War veteran was born a slave in Barren  County, Kentucky, June 6, 1836. His father was a mulatto and a free  negro. His mother was a slave on the Everrett plantation and his  grandparents ware full-blooded African negroes. As a child he began work  as soon as possible and was put to work hoeing and picking cotton and  any other odd jobs that would keep him busy. He was one of a family of  several children, and is the sole survivor, a brother living in  Indianapolis, having died there in 1935.    Following the custom of the south, when the children of the Everrett  family grew up, they married and slaves were given them for wedding  presents. John was given to a daughter who married a man of the name of  Eubanks, hence his name, John Eubanks. John was one of the more  fortunate slaves in that his mistress and master were kind and they were  in a state divided on the question of slavery. They favored the north.  The rest of the children were given to other members of the Everrett  family upon their marriage or sold down the river and never saw one  another until after the close of the Civil War.    Shortly after the beginning of the Civil War, when the north seemed to  be losing, someone conceived the idea of forming negro regiments and as  an inducement to the slaves, they offered them freedom if they would  join the Union forces. John's mistress and master told him that if he  wished to join the Union forces, he had their consent and would not have  to run away like other slaves were doing. At the beginning of the war,  John was twenty-one years of age. When Lincoln freed the slaves by his  Emancipation Proclamation, John was promptly given his freedom by his  master and mistress.    John decided to join the northern army which was located at Bowling  Green, Kentucky, a distance of thirty-five miles from Glasgow where John  was living. He had to walk the entire thirty-five miles. Although he  fails to remember all the units that he was attached to, he does  remember that it was part of General Sherman's army. His regiment  started with Sherman on his famous march through Georgia, but for some  reason unknown to John, shortly after the campaign was on its way, his  regiment was recalled and sent elsewhere.    His regiment was near Vicksburg, Mississippi, at the time Lee  surrendered. Since Lee was a proud southerner and did not want the  negroes present when he surrendered, Grant probably for this reason as  much as any other refused to accept Lee's sword. When Lee surrendered  there was much shouting among the troops and John was one of many put to  work loading cannons on boats to be shipped up the river. His company  returned on the steamboat \"Indiana.\" Upon his return to Glasgow, [HW:  Ky.] he saw for the first time in six years, his mother and other  members of his family who had returned free.    Shortly after he returned to Glasgow at the close of the Civil War, he  saw several colored people walking down the highway and was attracted to  a young colored girl in the group who was wearing a yellow dress.  Immediately he said to himself, \"If she ain't married there goes my  wife.\" Sometime later they met and were married Christmas day in 1866.  To this union twelve children were born four of whom are living today,  two in Gary and the others in the south. After his marriage he lived on  a farm near Glasgow for several years, later moving to Louisville, where  he worked in a lumber yeard. He came to Gary in 1924, two years after  the death of his wife.    President Grant was the first president for whom he cast his vote and he  continued to vote until old age prevented him from walking to the polls.    Although Lincoln is one of his favorite heroes, Teddy Roosevelt tops his  list of great men and he never failed to vote for him.    In 1926, he was the only one of three surviving memebers of the Grand  Army of the Republic in Gary and mighty proud of the fact that he was  the only one in the parade. In 1937 he is the sole survivor.    He served in the army as a member of Company K of the 108th, Kentucky  Infantry (Negro Volunteers).    When General Morgan, the famous southern raider, crossed the Ohio on his  raid across southern Indiana, John was one of the Negro fighters who  after heavy fighting, forced Morgan to recross the river and retreat  back to the south. He also participated in several skirmishes with the  cavalry troops commanded by the famous Nathan Bedfored Forrest, and was  a member of the Negro garrison at Fort Pillow, on the Mississippi which  was assaulted and captured. This resulted in a massacre of the negro  soldiers. John was in several other fights, but as he says, \"never onct  got a skinhurt.\"    At the present time, Mr. Eubanks is residing with his daughter, Mrs.  Bertha Sloss and several grandchildren, in Gary, Indiana. He is badly  crippled with rheumatism, has poor eyesight and his memory is failing.  Otherwise his health is good. Most of his teeth are good and they are a  source of wonder to his dentist. He is ninety-eight years of age and  his wish in life now, is to live to be a hundred. Since his brother and  mother both died at ninety-eight and his paternal grandfather at one  hundred-ten years of age, he has a good chance to realize this ambition.    Because of his condition most of this interview was had from his  grandchildren, who have taken notes in recent years of any incidents  that he relates. He is proud that most of his fifty grandchildren are  high school graduates and that two are attending the University of  Chicago.    In 1935, he enjoyed a motor trip, when his family took him back to  Glasgow for a visit. He suffered no ill effects from the trip.

He was born in Glasgow, Barron County, Kentucky, June 6, 1839, one of  seven children of a chattel of the Everett family.    The old man retains most of his faculties, but bears the mark of his  extreme age in an obvious feebleness and failing sight and memory. He is  physically large, says he once was a husky, weighing over two hundred  pounds, bears no scars or deformities and despite the hardships and  deprivations of his youth, presents a kindly and tolerant attitude.    \"I remembah well, us young uns on the Everett plantation,\" he relates,  \"I worked since I can remembah, hoein', pickin' cotton and othah chohs  'round the fahm.
