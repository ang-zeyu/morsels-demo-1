The apothecary who sold the potion  to the husband and wife was at the door below, requesting to speak with  him. The servants at first had refused to carry the message; but the old  man persisting, and saying it was a matter of life and death, entrance  for him into his master's chamber was obtained. \"Noble sir,\" said the  apothecary, \"I have always held you in love and reverence. I have  unfortunately reason to fear that somebody is desiring your death. This  morning a handmaiden of the lady Tisbina applied to me for a secret  poison; and just now it was told me, that the lady herself had been at  this house. I am old, sir, and you are young; and I warn you against the  violence and jealousies of womankind. Talk of their flames of love! Satan  himself burn them, say I, for they are fit for nothing better. Do not be  too much alarmed, however, this time: for in truth I gave the young woman  nothing of the sort that she asked for, but only a draught so innocent,  that if you have taken it, it will cost you but four or five hours'  sleep. So, in God's name, give up the whole foolish sex; for you may  depend on it, that in this city of ours there are ninety-nine wicked ones  among them to one good.\"    You may guess how Prasildo's heart revived at these words. Truly might he  be compared to flowers in sunshine after rain; he rejoiced through all  his being, and displayed again a cheerful countenance. Hastily thanking  the old man, he lost no time in repairing to the house of his neighbours,  and telling them of their safety: and you may guess how the like joy was  theirs. But behold a wonder! Iroldo was so struck with the generosity  of his neighbour's conduct throughout the whole of this extraordinary  affair, that nothing would content his grateful though ever-grieving  heart, but he must fairly give up Tisbina after all. Prasildo, to do him  justice, resisted the proposition as stoutly as he could; but a man's  powers are ill seconded by an unwilling heart; and though the contest was  long and handsome, as is customary between generous natures, the husband  adhered firmly to his intention. In short, he abruptly quitted the city,  declaring that he would never again see it, and so left his wife to the  lover. And I must add (concluded the fair lady who was telling the story  to Rinaldo), that although Tisbina took his departure greatly to heart,  and sometimes felt as if she should die at the thoughts of it, yet since  he persisted in staying away, and there appeared no chance of his ever  doing otherwise, she did, as in that case we should all do, we at least  that are young and kind, and took the handsome Prasildo for second  spouse.[3]    PART THE SECOND    The conclusion of this part of the history of Iroldo and Prasildo was  scarcely out of the lady's mouth, when a tremendous voice was heard among  the trees, and Rinaldo found himself confronting a giant of a frightful  aspect, who with a griffin on each side of him was guarding a cavern  that contained the enchanted horse which had belonged to the brother of  Angelica. A combat ensued; and after winning the horse, and subsequently  losing the company of the lady, the Paladin, in the course of his  adventures, came upon a knight who lay lamenting in a green place by a  fountain. The knight heeding nothing but his grief, did not perceive the  new comer, who for some time remained looking at him in silence, till,  desirous to know the cause of his sorrow, he dismounted from his horse,  and courteously begged to be informed of it. The stranger in his turn  looked a little while in silence at Rinaldo, and then told him he had  resolved to die, in order to be rid of a life of misery. And yet, he  added, it was not his own lot which grieved him, so much as that of a  noble friend who would die at the same time, and who had nobody to help  him.    The knight, who was no other than Tisbina's husband Iroldo, then briefly  related the events which the reader has heard, and proceeded to state how  he lead traversed the world ever since for two years, when it was his  misfortune to arrive in the territories of the enchantress Falerina,  whose custom it was to detain foreigners in prison, and daily give a  couple of them (a lady and a cavalier) for food to a serpent which kept  the entrance of her enchanted garden. To this serpent he himself was  destined to be sacrificed, when Prasildo, the possessor of his wife  Tisbina, hearing of his peril, set out instantly from Babylon, and rode  night and day till he came to the abode of the enchantress, determined  that nothing should hinder him from doing his utmost to save the life of  a friend so generous. Save it he did, and that by a generosity no less  devoted; for having attempted in vain to bribe the keeper of the prison,  he succeeded in prevailing on the man to let him substitute himself for  his friend; and he was that very day, perhaps that very moment, preparing  for the dreadful death to which he would speedily be brought.    \"I will not survive such a friend,\" concluded Iroldo. \"I know I shall  contend with his warders to no purpose; but let the wretches come, if  they will, by thousands; I shall fight them to the last gasp. One comfort  in death, one joy I shall at all events experience. I shall be with  Prasildo in the other world. And yet when I think what sort of death he  must endure, even the release from my own miseries afflicts me, since it  will not prevent him from undergoing that horror.\"    The Paladin shed tears to hear of a case so piteous and affectionate, and  in a tone of encouragement offered his services towards the rescue of his  friend. Iroldo looked at him in astonishment, but sighed and said, \"Ah,  Sir, I thank you with all my heart, and you are doubtless a most noble  cavalier, to be so fearless and good-hearted; but what right have I to  bring you to destruction for no reason and to no purpose? There is not  a man on earth but Orlando himself, or his cousin Rinaldo, who could  possibly do us any good; and so I beg you to accept my thanks and depart  in safety, and may God reward you.\"    \"It is true,\" replied the Paladin, \"I am not Orlando; and yet, for all  that, I doubt not to be able to effect what I propose. Nor do I offer my  assistance out of desire of glory, or of thanks, or return of any kind;  except indeed, that if two such unparalleled friends could admit me to be  a third, I should hold myself a happy man. What! you have given up the  woman of your heart, and deprived yourself of all joy and comfort; and  your friend, on the other hand, has become a prisoner and devoted to  death, for your sake; and can I be expected to leave two such friends in  a jeopardy so monstrous, and not do all in my power to save them? I would  rather die first myself, and on your own principle; I mean, in order to  go with you into a better world.\"    While they were talking in this manner, a great ill-looking rabble,  upwards of a thousand strong, made their appearance, carrying a banner,  and bringing forth two prisoners to die. The wretches were armed after  their disorderly fashion; and the prisoners each tied upon a horse. One  of these hapless persons too surely was Prasildo; and the other turned  out to be the damsel who had told Rinaldo the story of the friends.  Having been deprived of the Paladin's assistance, her subsequent  misadventures had brought her to this terrible pass. The moment Rinaldo  beheld her, he leaped on his horse, and dashed among the villains. The  sight of such an onset was enough for their cowardly hearts. The whole  posse fled before him with precipitation, all except the leader, who was  a villain of gigantic strength; and him the Paladin, at one blow, clove  through the middle. Iroldo could not speak for joy, as he hastened to  release Prasildo. He was forced to give him tears instead of words. But  when speech at length became possible, the two friends, fervently and  with a religious awe, declared that their deliverer must have been divine  and not human, so tremendous was the death-blow he had given the ruffian,  and such winged and contemptuous slaughter he had dealt among the  fugitives. By the time he returned from the pursuit, their astonishment  had risen to such a pitch, that they fell on their knees and worshipped  him for the Prophet of the Saracens, not believing such prowess possible  to humanity, and devoutly thanking him for the mercy he had shewn them in  coming thus visibly from heaven. Rinaldo for the moment was not a little  disturbed at this sally of enthusiasm; but the singular good faith and  simplicity of it restored him to himself; and with a smile between  lovingness and humility he begged them to lay aside all such fancies, and  know him for a man like themselves. He then disclosed himself for the  Rinaldo of whom they had spoken, and made such an impression on them with  his piety, and his attributing what had appeared a superhuman valour to  nothing but his belief in the Christian religion, that the transported  friends became converts on the spot, and accompanied him thenceforth as  the most faithful of his knights.           *       *       *       *       *    The story tells us nothing further of Tisbina, though there can be no  doubt that Boiardo meant to give us the conclusion of her share in it;  for the two knights take an active part in the adventures of their new  friend Rinaldo. Perhaps, however, the discontinuance of the poem itself  was lucky for the author, as far as this episode was concerned; for it  is difficult to conceive in what manner he would have wound it up to the  satisfaction of the reader.      [Footnote 1: The hero and heroine of the famous romance of _Tristan de  Leonois_.]    [Footnote 2: \"Mr. Rose observes, that Medusa may be designed by Boiardo  as the 'type of conscience;' and he is confirmed in his opinion by the  circumstance mentioned in this canto (12, lib. i. stan.

And when this was done, one of the soldiers of the  tenth legion said, not without a touch of humour, \"that Caesar did more  for them than he had promised; he had promised to have the tenth legion  in place of his praetorian cohort; but he now converted them into  horse.\"    XLIII.--There was a large plain, and in it a mound of earth of  considerable size. This spot was at nearly an equal distance from both  camps. Thither, as had been appointed, they came for the conference.  Caesar stationed the legion, which he had brought [with him] on  horseback, 200 paces from this mound. The cavalry of Ariovistus also  took their stand at an equal distance. Ariovistus then demanded that  they should confer on horseback, and that, besides themselves, they  should bring with them ten men each to the conference. When they were  come to the place, Caesar, in the opening of his speech, detailed his  own and the senate's favours towards him [Ariovistus], \"in that he had  been styled king, in that [he had been styled] friend, by the senate--  in that very considerable presents had been sent him; which circumstance  he informed him had both fallen to the lot of few, and had usually been  bestowed in consideration of important personal services; that he,  although he had neither an introduction, nor a just ground for the  request, had obtained these honours through the kindness and munificence  of himself [Caesar] and the senate. He informed him too, how old and how  just were the grounds of connexion that existed between themselves [the  Romans] and the Aedui, what decrees of the senate had been passed in  their favour, and how frequent and how honourable; how from time  immemorial the Aedui had held the supremacy of the whole of Gaul; even  [said Caesar] before they had sought our friendship; that it was the  custom of the Roman people to desire not only that its allies and  friends should lose none of their property, but be advanced in  influence, dignity, and honour: who then could endure that what they had  brought with them to the friendship of the Roman people, should be torn  from them?\" He then made the same demands which he had commissioned the  ambassadors to make, that [Ariovistus] should not make war either upon  the Aedui or their allies, that he should restore the hostages; that, if  he could not send back to their country any part of the Germans, he  should at all events suffer none of them any more to cross the Rhine.    XLIV.--Ariovistus replied briefly to the demands of Caesar; but  expatiated largely on his own virtues, \"that he had crossed the Rhine  not of his own accord, but on being invited and sent for by the Gauls;  that he had not left home and kindred without great expectations and  great rewards; that he had settlements in Gaul, granted by the Gauls  themselves; that the hostages had been given by their own good-will;  that he took by right of war the tribute which conquerors are accustomed  to impose on the conquered; that he had not made war upon the Gauls, but  the Gauls upon him; that all the states of Gaul came to attack him, and  had encamped against him; that all their forces had been routed and  beaten by him in a single battle; that if they chose to make a second  trial, he was ready to encounter them again; but if they chose to enjoy  peace, it was unfair to refuse the tribute, which of their own free-will  they had paid up to that time. That the friendship of the Roman people  ought to prove to him an ornament and a safeguard, not a detriment; and  that he sought it with that expectation. But if through the Roman people  the tribute was to be discontinued, and those who surrendered to be  seduced from him, he would renounce the friendship of the Roman people  no less heartily than he had sought it. As to his leading over a host of  Germans into Gaul, that he was doing this with a view of securing  himself, not of assaulting Gaul: that there was evidence of this, in  that he did not come without being invited, and in that he did not make  war, but merely warded it off. That he had come into Gaul before the  Roman people. That never before this time did a Roman army go beyond the  frontiers of the province of Gaul. What [said he] does [Caesar] desire?  --why come into his [Ariovistus's] domains?--that this was his province  of Gaul, just as that is ours. As it ought not to be pardoned in him, if  he were to make an attack upon our territories; so, likewise, that we  were unjust to obstruct him in his prerogative. As for Caesar's saying  that the Aedui had been styled 'brethren' by the senate, he was not so  uncivilized nor so ignorant of affairs, as not to know that the Aedui in  the very last war with the Allobroges had neither rendered assistance to  the Romans, nor received any from the Roman people in the struggles  which the Aedui had been maintaining with him and with the Sequani. He  must feel suspicious that Caesar, though feigning friendship as the  reason for his keeping an army in Gaul; was keeping it with the view of  crushing him. And that unless he depart, and withdraw his army from  these parts, he shall regard him not as a friend, but as a foe; and  that, even if he should put him to death, he should do what would please  many of the nobles and leading men of the Roman people; he had assurance  of that from themselves through their messengers, and could purchase the  favour and the friendship of them all by his [Caesar's] death. But if he  would depart and resign to him the free possession of Gaul, he would  recompense him with a great reward, and would bring to a close whatever  wars he wished to be carried on, without any trouble or risk to him.\"    XLV.--Many things were stated by Caesar to the effect [to show]: \"why he  could not waive the business, and that neither his nor the Roman  people's practice would suffer him to abandon most meritorious allies,  nor did he deem that Gaul belonged to Ariovistus rather than to the  Roman people; that the Arverni and the Ruteni had been subdued in war by  Quintus Fabius Maximus, and that the Roman people had pardoned them and  had not reduced them into a province or imposed a tribute upon them. And  if the most ancient period was to be regarded--then was the sovereignty  of the Roman people in Gaul most just: if the decree of the senate was  to be observed, then ought Gaul to be free, which they [the Romans] had  conquered in war, and had permitted to enjoy its own laws.\"    XLVI.--While these things are being transacted in the conference, it was  announced to Caesar that the cavalry of Ariovistus were approaching  nearer the mound, and were riding up to our men, and casting stones and  weapons at them. Caesar made an end of his speech and betook himself to  his men; and commanded them that they should by no means return a weapon  upon the enemy. For though he saw that an engagement with the cavalry  would be without any danger to his chosen legion, yet he did not think  proper to engage, lest, after the enemy were routed, it might be said  that they had been ensnared by him under the sanction of a conference.  When it was spread abroad among the common soldiery with what  haughtiness Ariovistus had behaved at the conference, and how he had  ordered the Romans to quit Gaul, and how his cavalry had made an attack  upon our men, and how this had broken off the conference, a much greater  alacrity and eagerness for battle was infused into our army.    XLVII.--Two days after, Ariovistus sends ambassadors to Caesar, to state  \"that he wished to treat with him about those things which had been  begun to be treated of between them, but had not been concluded\"; [and  to beg] that \"he would either again appoint a day for a conference; or,  if he were not willing to do that, that he would send one of his  [officers] as an ambassador to him.\" There did not appear to Caesar any  good reason for holding a conference; and the more so as the day before  the Germans could not be restrained from casting weapons at our men. He  thought he should not without great danger send to him as ambassador one  of his [Roman] officers, and should expose him to savage men. It seemed  [therefore] most proper to send to him C. Valerius Procillus, the son of  C. Valerius Caburus, a young man of the highest courage and  accomplishments (whose father had been presented with the freedom of the  city by C. Valerius Flaccus), both on account of his fidelity and on  account of his knowledge of the Gallic language, which Ariovistus, by  long practice, now spoke fluently; and because in his case the Germans  would have no motive for committing violence; and [as his colleague] M.  Mettius, who had shared the hospitality of Ariovistus. He commissioned  them to learn what Ariovistus had to say, and to report to him. But when  Ariovistus saw them before him in his camp, he cried out in the presence  of his army, \"Why were they come to him? was it for the purpose of  acting as spies?\" He stopped them when attempting to speak, and cast  them into chains.    XLVIII.--The same day he moved his camp forward and pitched under a hill  six miles from Caesar's camp. The day following he led his forces past  Caesar's camp, and encamped two miles beyond him; with this design--that  he might cut off Caesar from, the corn and provisions which might be  conveyed to him from the Sequani and the Aedui. For five successive days  from that day, Caesar drew out his forces before the camp, and put them  in battle order, that, if Ariovistus should be willing to engage in  battle, an opportunity might not be wanting to him. Ariovistus all this  time kept his army in camp: but engaged daily in cavalry skirmishes. The  method of battle in which the Germans had"]]]
