All his appeals had no effect, and  though some faint-hearted persons deserted, the multitude held firm, and  the siege was pressed on more vigorously than ever. A wall of  circumvallation was built round the city, and the horrors of starvation  increased daily. Between the months of Nisan and Tammuz one hundred and  fifty thousand corpses were carried out of the town.[3] Josephus  expatiates on the terrible suffering, and again and again he denounces  the iniquity of the Zealots, who continued the resistance. \"No age had a  generation more fruitful in wickedness; they confessed that they were  the slaves, the scum, the spurious and abortive offspring of our  nation.\" John committed the heinous sacrilege of using the oil preserved  in the Temple vessels for the starving soldiers. \"I suppose,\" says the  ex-priest writing in the Roman palace, \"that had the Romans made any  longer delay in attacking these abandoned men, the city would either  have been swallowed up by the ground opening on them, or been swept away  by a deluge, or destroyed as Sodom was destroyed, since it had brought  forth a generation even more godless than those that suffered such  punishments.\"[4]    [Footnote 1: B.J. V. ix. 3.]    [Footnote 2: We are reminded of the saying of Rabbi Akiba some  half-century later. When asked where God was to be sought now that the  Temple was destroyed, he replied, \"In the great city of Rome\" (Yer.  Taanit, 69a). But the Rabbinical utterance had a very different meaning  from the plea of Josephus.]    [Footnote 3: B.J. V. xiii. 7.]    [Footnote 4: B.J. V. x. and xiii.]    Famine and weariness were breaking down the strength of the Jews, and,  after fierce resistance, the tower of Antonia was captured and razed to  the ground. Josephus adds another chapter to detail the horrors of the  famine, in which he recounts the story of the mother eating her child,  which occurs also in the Midrash.[1] The Romans, he tells us, were  filled with a religious loathing of their foes on account of their sins  in violating the Temple and eating forbidden food, and Titus excused  himself for the sufferings he caused, on the ground that, as he had  given the Jews the chance of securing peace and liberty, they had  brought the evil on themselves. Slowly but surely the Romans gained a  footing within the Temple precinct; inch by inch John was driven back,  and on the Ninth of Ab the sanctuary was stormed. A torch, hurled  probably by the hand of Titus (see below, p. 128), set the cloisters  alight, and the fire spread till the whole house was involved. The  crowning catastrophe, the burning of the Holy of Holies, happened on the  following day.    [Footnote 1: Ekah R. 65a.]    Josephus remained in the Roman camp throughout the siege, advising Titus  at each step how he might proceed. After the fall of the Temple he  witnessed the last desperate struggle, when a half-starved remnant of  the defenders \"looked straight into death without flinching.\" A great  modern writer sees in this unquenchable passion of the Zealots for  liberty a sublime type of steadfastness[1]; but Josephus, who after the  fall of the Temple had made another unavailing effort to persuade them  to lay down their arms, again pours forth his abuse upon those who  fought against the sacred might of Rome. Over a million had perished in  the siege, and less than one hundred thousand were captured, of whom  only forty thousand were preserved. His favor with Titus enabled him to  redeem from captivity his brother and a large number of his friends and  acquaintances and one hundred and ninety women and children.[2] His own  estates near Jerusalem having been taken for a military colony, he  received liberal compensation in another part of Judea. From the victor  he also obtained a scroll of the law.    [Footnote 1: George Eliot, Impressions of Theophrastus Such.]    [Footnote 2: Vita, 75.]    It is not certain whether he accompanied \"the gentle Titus\" through  Syria after the fall of the city and the razing of its walls. The  victor's progress was marked at each stopping-place by the celebration  of games, where thousands of young Jewish captives were made to kill  each other, \"butchered to make a Roman holiday\" and feast the eyes of  the conqueror and the Herodian ally and his spouse. But he certainly  witnessed at Rome the triumph of the Flavii, father and son, and gazed  on the shame of his country, when its most holy monuments were carried  by the noblest of the captives through the streets amid the applause and  ribald jeers of a Roman crowd. Josephus enlarges with apparent apathy on  the procession, which is commemorated and made vivid down to our own day  by the arch in the Roman Forum, through which no Jew in the Middle Ages  would pass. He records, too, that Vespasian built a Temple of Peace, in  which he stored the golden vessels taken from the Jewish sanctuary, and  put up the whole of Judea for sale as his private property.[1] Josephus  himself was housed in the royal palace, and it does not appear that he  ever returned to Palestine. The tenth legion had been left on the site  of Jerusalem as a permanent Roman garrison, and a fortified camp was  built for it on the northern hill. \"The legions swallowed her up and  idolaters possessed her.\" _A chacun selon ses oeuvres_ is the comment of  Salvador, the Franco-Jewish historian (fl. 1850), comparing the gilded  servitude of Josephus with the fate of the patriots of Jerusalem; and  another recent historian, Graetz, has contrasted the picture of Jeremiah  uttering his touching laments over the ruins at the fall of the first  Temple with the position of Josephus pouring out his fulsome adulation  of the destroyer at the fall of the second.    [Footnote 1: B.J. VII. vi. 6.]    Henceforth Josephus lived, an exile from his country and his countrymen,  in the retinue of the Caesars, and entered on his career as his people's  historian. But he was never allowed to forget his dependence. His first  work was an account of the Roman war, in which he vilified the patriots  to extenuate his own surrender and his master's cruelty. It is true that  he afterwards composed an elaborate apology for his people in the form  of a history in twenty volumes, which may be considered as a kind of  palliation for the evil he had done them in action. It was more possible  to refute the Roman prejudices based on utter ignorance of Jewish  history, than the prejudices based on their narrowness of mind. But even  here the writer has often to accommodate himself to a pagan standpoint,  which could not appreciate Hebrew sublimity. When he wrote the  _Antiquities_, his mind was already molded in Greco-Roman form, and  where he seeks to glorify, he not seldom contrives to degrade. His works  are a striking example of inward slavery in outward freedom, for by dint  of breathing the foreign atmosphere and imbibing foreign notions he had  become incapable of presenting his people's history in its true light.  He had been granted full Roman citizenship, and received a literary  pension. Still he was not loved by other courtiers as worthy as himself,  and he had frequently to defend himself against the charges of his  enemies. In the reign of Vespasian, after the Zealot rising in Cyrene  had been put down, the leader, Jonathan, who was brought as a prisoner  to Rome, charged Josephus before the Emperor with having sent him both  weapons and money. The story was not believed, and the informer was put  to death. After that, Josephus relates, \"when they that envied my good  fortune did frequently bring censure against me, by God's Providence I  escaped them all.\"    He remained in favor under Titus and Domitian, who in turn succeeded  their father in the purple. Domitian indeed, though he persecuted the  Jews, and laid new fiscal burdens upon them, punished the accusers of  Josephus, and made his estate in Judea tax-free, and the Emperor's wife,  Domitia, also showed him kindness. But perhaps the amazing and pathetic  servility of the _Life_ is to be explained by fear of the vainglorious  despot, whose hand was heavy on all intellectual work. Historical  writers suffered most under his oppression, and it may have been  necessary to Josephus to make out that he had been a traitor. It may  appear more to his credit as a courtier than as a Jew that the enemy of  his people was friendly towards him. But his position must have been  perilous during the black reign of the tyrant, who rivaled Nero for  maniac cruelty. His chief patron was one Epaphroditus, by his name a  Greek, perhaps to be identified with a celebrated librarian and scholar,  to whom he dedicated his _Antiquities_ and the books _Against Apion_. He  lived on probably[1] till the beginning of the second century, through  the short but tranquil rule of Nerva, when there was a brief interlude  of tolerance and intellectual freedom, into the reign of Trajan, who was  to deal his people injuries as deep as those Titus had inflicted. It is  uncertain whether he survived to witness the horrors of the desperate  rising of the Jews, which sealed their national doom throughout the  Diaspora. At least he did not survive to describe it. His last work that  has come down to us is the _Life_, which is an apologetic pamphlet,  perversely self-vilifying, in which he sought to refute the accusation  of his rival Justus of Tiberias, that he had taken a commanding part in  the war against the Romans in Galilee, and had been the guiding spirit  of the Rebellion.    [Footnote 1: It has, however, been suggested that the date of Agrippa's  death, which is recorded in the _Life_, was really 95 C.E., instead of  103 C.E., as is usually accepted; if that is so, Josephus may not have  outlived the black reign of Domitian, which lasted till 97 C.E. See J.H.  Hart, s.v. Josephus, in Encycl. Brit. 11th ed.]    The _Life_ is the least creditable of Josephus' works; but, as we have  seen, it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9799"],[0,"It Happened in Egypt (#10)"],[1,"\"    \"You do not know who I am, Mademoiselle. Ask your friend Lord Ernest  Borrow. Perhaps he may remember something about my circumstances now he  has recalled my face.\"    I was honestly not sure whether this were further deviltry, or an  appeal for help. In any case, I thought it time for the scene to end.  \"I told you,\" I said to Monny in English, \"that he was a man of  importance, not at all the sort of person you could expect to engage  for a guide. You must see now that he's a gentleman. And a--a--an  Egyptian gentleman is just the same as any other.\"    \"Surely not quite!\" she answered in the same language, and I realized  my foolish mistake in using it, as if I meant her to understand that  Antoun Effendi knew it too little to catch our secrets.    \"An Egyptian man can't have the same feelings as a European? Why, for  hundreds and hundreds of years they've been an enslaved race, like our  black people at home. We'd never think of calling even the fairest  quadroon man a gentleman, though he might be wonderfully good looking  and nice mannered.\"    Literally, I was frightened. Anthony Fenton is fiercely devoted to the  memory of the beautiful princess-mother, for love of whom his father's  career was ruined. _Her_ mother was a Sicilian woman, and her father  was half Greek, so there is little enough Egyptian blood, after all, in  the veins of General Fenton's son. He is proud of what there is--proud,  because of his mother's fatal charm, and the romance of her story (it  was on the eve of her wedding with a cousin of the Sultan that the  famous soldier Charles Fenton ran away with Princess Lalla and married  her in Sicily): but he is sensitive, too, because, great name as  Charles Fenton had made in Egypt, he was asked to resign his commission  on account of the escapade. Anthony, sent to England to a public  school, had fought bigger boys than himself, who, in a certain tone,  had sneeringly called him \"Egyptian.\" I imagined now that through the  dark stain on his face I could see him turn pale with rage. He thought,  perhaps, that the American beauty was revenging herself for his  impertinence, and maybe he was right, but that did not excuse her.    \"Be careful, Miss Gilder!\" I warned the girl. \"This man understands  English better than you think. He comes of a princely family and he's  got only to put out his hand to claim a fortune--\"    \"You seem to remember all about me now, Lord Ernest,\" broke in Fenton,  looking dangerous.    \"Yes,\" I said. \"It comes back to me. You must forgive Miss Gilder.\"    \"There is nothing to forgive,\" he caught me up. \"I am not a dragoman,  to be sure, but I'm enough of an Egyptian to have a price for anything  I do. I may put myself at this lady's service if she will pay my price,  though I'm not a servant and can't accept wages, even for the sake of  pursuing my excavations!\"    He continued to speak in French, lest my companions' suspicions should  be further roused by the English of an Englishman; and Monny, pale  after her blush, answered in neat, schoolgirl French, with a pretty  American, accent. \"What's the price you wish to name?\" she inquired,  looking a little afraid of him and ashamed of herself, now that talk of  princes and fortunes was bandied about. \"Of course,\" she went on, when  he did not answer at once, \"if I'd known--all this, I shouldn't have  asked you to be a dragoman. At least, perhaps I shouldn't. Anyhow, I  shouldn't have made a bet--\"    \"A bet that I would have a 'price,' Mademoiselle? Then you may win your  bet, for I've just told you; I have a price. But I think it unlikely  you would be willing to pay it.\"    \"Good heavens, is he going to try and marry the girl?\" I asked myself.  It would be the last thing to expect of Anthony Fenton. However, he had  already done the last but one; the thing I had bet his green turban he  would not do. After all, he was a man, and a reckless man, as he had  proved on more than one wild occasion. He was in a strange mood,  capable of anything; and the Gilded Rose could never have been prettier  in her life than at this minute. She had made him furious, and I had  imagined that his acceptance of her overtures was the beginning of some  scheme of punishment. Now I was almost sure I had been right, yet I  could not guess what he would be at. Neither could Monny. But here was  the dangerously picturesque Arab who \"must be a prince or something,\"  as Cleopatra had expressed it. And he was even more dangerous than  picturesque.    \"You--you said you wouldn't take wages,\" she stammered (I enjoyed  hearing the self-willed young person stammer): \"so I can't understand  what you mean. But even though you are all those things Lord Ernest  says you are, your price can't be so terribly high as to be beyond my  power to pay--if I choose to pay.\"    \"First, Mademoiselle, I must decide whether I choose to be paid.\"    \"Oh!\" Monny exclaimed, taken aback. \"I thought it was a question of  price.\"    \"Not only that. 'I _may_ put myself at the lady's service--for a  price,' was what I said. I didn't say, 'I will.' I shall not be able to  tell you until to-night.\" The patronizing tone in which Anthony spoke  this sentence was worth to me everything I had gone through in the last  half hour.    \"But--I want to settle things this morning or--not at all,\" said Monny,  reverting to type: that of the spoiled child.    \"I am sorry,\" replied the man of the green turban. \"In that case, it  must be not at all.\" And he made as if to go.    The Gilded Girl could not bear this. I and the others would see that  she was fallible; that there were things she wanted which she could not  get. \"Why can't you tell me now what your price is?\" she persisted.    \"Because, Mademoiselle, I may not need to tell you ever. It depends  partly on another than myself.\" He threw a quick glance at me. \"I  expect to meet that other at Abdullahi's Cafe in an hour from now at  latest. Everything will depend on the interview. In any case, I will  let you know to-night what I can do.\"    \"I may not be in,\" said Monny. \"But if I'm out, you can leave a note.\"    \"If I must refuse to serve you, yes, I can leave a note. If I am to  accept, I must see you in person. Should you be out, I'll take it for  granted that you have changed your mind and do not want\"--he smiled  faintly for the first time--\"so expensive a guide.\"    Monny hesitated. \"I am not stingy. I'll stay at home this evening,\" she  volunteered at last.    \"Bravo Petruchio!\" I said under my breath. But if Biddy's plot were to  succeed, it was _my_ business to play the part of Petruchio to this  Katherine. Let the masquerading prince find a Desdemona who would suit  his Othello!          CHAPTER V    THE CAFE OF ABDULLAH      \"Well--you got away from them all right?\" began the man with the green  turban when, according to his roundabout instructions, I met him an  hour later at the cafe he had named, one of the principal resorts of  Cairo, where Europeans can consort with natives without attracting  remark.    \"The real dragoman came and took them off my hands--at least the realer  one than you--a dreadful creature with a game eye, who murdered your  messenger last night, and gave me your letter and induced the ladies to  engage him on the strength of it. No wonder they want a 'looker' to  take the taste of him out of their mouths. And you certainly are a  'looker' in that get-up. Now kindly tell me all about it, and  everything else.\"    \"That's what I'm here for,\" said Anthony, running a match-box to earth  in some mysterious Arab pocket. \"But hold on, Duffer. Something you  said just then may be important. Is it true that my messenger didn't  give you the letter?\"    \"If you'd hung about Shepheard's Hotel ten minutes longer, you'd have  seen the fellow who did give it. Bedr el Gemaly he calls himself  --Armenian Mussulman, a sickening combination, and an awful brute to look  at--said your messenger was taken suddenly ill; pretends to be a  dragoman.\"    \"What is he like?\"    \"Rather like a partially decayed but decently dressed goat.\"    \"Don't rot. This may be serious.\"    I described Bedr el Gemaly as best I could, feature by feature. When I  had polished them off, Anthony shook his green-turbaned head. \"No  portrait of him in my rogues' gallery. Just now, I'm sensitive about  spies--over-sensitive rather. Of course, you've spotted my game?\"    \"I confess I was conceited enough to think you'd given yourself all  this trouble with the costumier in order to take a rise out of me. But  when you speak of spies, I begin to put two and two together--your  business in Cairo--the powers that be, keeping you from me last night,  etc. I suppose it's an official job, this fancy dress affair?\"    \"Yes. In my own capacity, I'm not in Cairo. I turned up day before  yesterday, jolly glad to get back from Adrianople--though it was good  fun there, I can tell you, for a while; and I looked forward to  wallowing no end in the alleged delights of civilization. I reported  myself, and all seemed well. I took a room at Shepheard's where you and  I had arranged to meet, and when I'd scrubbed, I strolled over to the  Turf Club to see what the gay world would have to say to a fellow in  disgrace.\"    \"Only silly asses swallowed that newspaper spoof! Every one in London  who knows anything about you was betting his boots that the story had  been spread on purpose to save our face with Turkey.\" I couldn't resist  interrupting his narrative to this extent. But Anthony merely smiled,  and watched a long-lived smokering settle like a halo over the head of  an Arab at the nearest table. He was not giving away official secrets,  but I was sure and always had been sure that he was a martyr, not a  rebel, in the matter of the Balkan incident, just closed. What the  public were led to suppose was this: that Captain Fenton had asked for  two months' leave from regimental duty at Khartum, in order to spend  the time with a relative who"]]]
