bury             therefore thy dead.    01:023:016 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to             Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the             sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money             with the merchant.    01:023:017 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was             before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and             all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the             borders round about, were made sure    01:023:018 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children             of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.    01:023:019 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of             the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the             land of Canaan.    01:023:020 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure             unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of             Heth.    01:024:001 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD             had blessed Abraham in all things.    01:024:002 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that             ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under             my thigh:    01:024:003 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and             the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my             son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:    01:024:004 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take             a wife unto my son Isaac.    01:024:005 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not             be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy             son again unto the land from whence thou camest?    01:024:006 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my             son thither again.    01:024:007 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house,             and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and             that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this             land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take             a wife unto my son from thence.    01:024:008 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou             shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son             thither again.    01:024:009 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his             master, and sware to him concerning that matter.    01:024:010 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,             and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his             hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of             Nahor.    01:024:011 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a             well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that             women go out to draw water.    01:024:012 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send             me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master             Abraham.    01:024:013 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters             of the men of the city come out to draw water:    01:024:014 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say,             Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she             shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let             the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant             Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness             unto my master.    01:024:015 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that,             behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of             Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher             upon her shoulder.    01:024:016 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither             had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and             filled her pitcher, and came up.    01:024:017 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray             thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.    01:024:018 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her             pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.    01:024:019 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw             water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.    01:024:020 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and             ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his             camels.    01:024:021 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether             the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.    01:024:022 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the             man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two             bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;    01:024:023 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is             there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?    01:024:024 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of             Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.    01:024:025 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender             enough, and room to lodge in.    01:024:026 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.    01:024:027 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who             hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth:             I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my             master's brethren.    01:024:028 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these             things.    01:024:029 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban             ran out unto the man, unto the well.    01:024:030 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets             upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of             Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that             he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at             the well.    01:024:031 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore             standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room             for the camels.    01:024:032 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels,             and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash             his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.    01:024:033 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will             not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.    01:024:034 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.    01:024:035 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become             great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver,             and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and             asses.    01:024:036 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she             was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.    01:024:037 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a             wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose             land I dwell:    01:024:038 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred,             and take a wife unto my son.    01:024:039 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not             follow me.    01:024:040 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send             his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take             a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:    01:024:041 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest             to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be             clear from my oath.    01:024:042 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8003"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 3: Leviticus (#10)"],[1,"the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them             in the midst of their uncleanness.    03:016:017 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the             congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy             place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for             himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation             of Israel.    03:016:018 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD,             and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of             the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the             horns of the altar round about.    03:016:019 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger             seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the             uncleanness of the children of Israel.    03:016:020 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place,             and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he             shall bring the live goat:    03:016:021 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live             goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children             of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins,             putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him             away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:    03:016:022 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a             land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the             wilderness.    03:016:023 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,             and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he             went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:    03:016:024 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and             put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt             offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an             atonement for himself, and for the people.    03:016:025 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.    03:016:026 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his             clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into             the camp.    03:016:027 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin             offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the             holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp;

And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.    03:017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:017:002 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children             of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD             hath commanded, saying,    03:017:003 What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth             an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out             of the camp,    03:017:004 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the             congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the             tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man;             he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among             his people:    03:017:005 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their             sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they             may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle             of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace             offerings unto the LORD.    03:017:006 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the             LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and             burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.    03:017:007 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils,             after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute             for ever unto them throughout their generations.    03:017:008 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the             house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you,             that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,    03:017:009 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the             congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall             be cut off from among his people.    03:017:010 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the             strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of             blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth             blood, and will cut him off from among his people.    03:017:011 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it             to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for             it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.    03:017:012 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you             shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth             among you eat blood.    03:017:013 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of             the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and             catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even             pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.    03:017:014 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the             life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye             shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all             flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut             off.    03:017:015 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that             which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own             country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and             bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then             shall he be clean.    03:017:016 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall             bear his iniquity.    03:018:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:018:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the             LORD your God.    03:018:003 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall             ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither             I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their             ordinances.    03:018:004 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk             therein: I am the LORD your God.    03:018:005 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which             if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.    03:018:006 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him,             to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.    03:018:007 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother,             shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not             uncover her nakedness.    03:018:008 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it             is thy father's nakedness.    03:018:009 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or             daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born             abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.    03:018:010 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's             daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for             theirs is thine own nakedness.    03:018:011 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy             father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her             nakedness.    03:018:012 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister:             she is thy father's near kinswoman.    03:018:013 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister:             for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.    03:018:014 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother,             thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.    03:018:015 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law:             she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.    03:018:016 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it             is "]]]
