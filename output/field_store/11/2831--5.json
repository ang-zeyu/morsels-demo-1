[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1036"],[0,"Joe Wilson and His Mates (#11)"],[1,"gone before I was in a fit state of mind  to feel it. And at home I'd often growled about being asked to hold the  baby for a few minutes. I could never brood comfortably and nurse a baby  at the same time. It was a ghostly moonlight night. There's no timber in  the world so ghostly as the Australian Bush in moonlight--or just about  daybreak. The all-shaped patches of moonlight falling between ragged,  twisted boughs; the ghostly blue-white bark of the 'white-box' trees; a  dead naked white ring-barked tree, or dead white stump starting out here  and there, and the ragged patches of shade and light on the road that  made anything, from the shape of a spotted bullock to a naked  corpse laid out stark. Roads and tracks through the Bush made by  moonlight--every one seeming straighter and clearer than the real one:  you have to trust to your horse then. Sometimes the naked white trunk of  a red stringy-bark tree, where a sheet of bark had been taken off, would  start out like a ghost from the dark Bush. And dew or frost glistening  on these things, according to the season. Now and again a great grey  kangaroo, that had been feeding on a green patch down by the road, would  start with a 'thump-thump', and away up the siding.    The Bush seemed full of ghosts that night--all going my way--and being  left behind by the mare. Once I stopped to look at Jim: I just sat  back and the mare 'propped'--she'd been a stock-horse, and was used  to 'cutting-out'. I felt Jim's hands and forehead; he was in a burning  fever. I bent forward, and the old mare settled down to it again. I kept  saying out loud--and Mary and me often laughed about it (afterwards):  'He's limp yet!--Jim's limp yet!' (the words seemed jerked out of me by  sheer fright)--'He's limp yet!' till the mare's feet took it up. Then,  just when I thought she was doing her best and racing her hardest, she  suddenly started forward, like a cable tram gliding along on its own and  the grip put on suddenly. It was just what she'd do when I'd be riding  alone and a strange horse drew up from behind--the old racing instinct.  I FELT the thing too! I felt as if a strange horse WAS there! And  then--the words just jerked out of me by sheer funk--I started saying,  'Death is riding to-night!... Death is racing to-night!... Death is  riding to-night!' till the hoofs took that up. And I believe the old  mare felt the black horse at her side and was going to beat him or break  her heart.    I was mad with anxiety and fright: I remember I kept saying, 'I'll be  kinder to Mary after this! I'll take more notice of Jim!' and the rest  of it.    I don't know how the old mare got up the last 'pinch'. She must have  slackened pace, but I never noticed it: I just held Jim up to me and  gripped the saddle with my knees--I remember the saddle jerked from the  desperate jumps of her till I thought the girth would go. We topped the  gap and were going down into a gully they called Dead Man's Hollow, and  there, at the back of a ghostly clearing that opened from the road  where there were some black-soil springs, was a long, low, oblong  weatherboard-and-shingle building, with blind, broken windows in the  gable-ends, and a wide steep verandah roof slanting down almost to the  level of the window-sills--there was something sinister about it, I  thought--like the hat of a jail-bird slouched over his eyes. The place  looked both deserted and haunted. I saw no light, but that was because  of the moonlight outside. The mare turned in at the corner of the  clearing to take a short cut to the shanty, and, as she struggled across  some marshy ground, my heart kept jerking out the words, 'It's deserted!  They've gone away! It's deserted!' The mare went round to the back and  pulled up between the back door and a big bark-and-slab kitchen. Some  one shouted from inside--    'Who's there?'    'It's me. Joe Wilson. I want your sister-in-law--I've got the boy--he's  sick and dying!'    Brighten came out, pulling up his moleskins. 'What boy?' he asked.    'Here, take him,' I shouted, 'and let me get down.'    'What's the matter with him?' asked Brighten, and he seemed to hang  back. And just as I made to get my leg over the saddle, Jim's head went  back over my arm, he stiffened, and I saw his eyeballs turned up and  glistening in the moonlight.    I felt cold all over then and sick in the stomach--but CLEAR-HEADED in  a way: strange, wasn't it? I don't know why I didn't get down and rush  into the kitchen to get a bath ready. I only felt as if the worst had  come, and I wished it were over and gone. I even thought of Mary and the  funeral.    Then a woman ran out of the house--a big, hard-looking woman. She had  on a wrapper of some sort, and her feet were bare. She laid her hand on  Jim, looked at his face, and then snatched him from me and ran into the  kitchen--and me down and after her. As great good luck would have it,  they had some dirty clothes on to boil in a kerosene tin--dish-cloths or  something.    Brighten's sister-in-law dragged a tub out from under the table,  wrenched the bucket off the hook, and dumped in the water, dish-cloths  and all, snatched a can of cold water from a corner, dashed that in,  and felt the water with her hand--holding Jim up to her hip all the  time--and I won't say how he looked. She stood him in the tub and  started dashing water over him, tearing off his clothes between the  splashes.    'Here, that tin of mustard--there on the shelf!' she shouted to me.    She knocked the lid off the tin on the edge of the tub, and went on  splashing and spanking Jim.    It seemed an eternity. And I? Why, I never thought clearer in my life. I  felt cold-blooded--I felt as if I'd like an excuse to go outside till  it was all over. I thought of Mary and the funeral--and wished that that  was past. All this in a flash, as it were. I felt that it would be a  great relief, and only wished the funeral was months past. I felt--well,  altogether selfish. I only thought for myself.    Brighten's sister-in-law splashed and spanked him hard--hard enough to  break his back I thought, and--after about half an hour it seemed--the  end came: Jim's limbs relaxed, he slipped down into the tub, and the  pupils of his eyes came down. They seemed dull and expressionless, like  the eyes of a new baby, but he was back for the world again.    I dropped on the stool by the table.    'It's all right,' she said. 'It's all over now. I wasn't going to let  him die.' I was only thinking, 'Well it's over now, but it will come on  again. I wish it was over for good. I'm tired of it.'    She called to her sister, Mrs Brighten, a washed-out, helpless little  fool of a woman, who'd been running in and out and whimpering all the  time--    'Here, Jessie! bring the new white blanket off my bed. And you,  Brighten, take some of that wood off the fire, and stuff something in  that hole there to stop the draught.'    Brighten--he was a nuggety little hairy man with no expression to be  seen for whiskers--had been running in with sticks and back logs from  the wood-heap. He took the wood out, stuffed up the crack, and went  inside and brought out a black bottle--got a cup from the shelf, and put  both down near my elbow.    Mrs Brighten started to get some supper or breakfast, or whatever it  was, ready. She had a clean cloth, and set the table tidily. I noticed  that all the tins were polished bright (old coffee- and mustard-tins  and the like, that they used instead of sugar-basins and tea-caddies and  salt-cellars), and the kitchen was kept as clean as possible. She was  all right at little things. I knew a haggard, worked-out Bushwoman who  put her whole soul--or all she'd got left--into polishing old tins till  they dazzled your eyes.    I didn't feel inclined for corned beef and damper, and post-and-rail  tea. So I sat and squinted, when I thought she wasn't looking, at  Brighten's sister-in-law. She was a big woman, her hands and feet were  big, but well-shaped and all in proportion--they fitted her. She was a  handsome woman--about forty I should think. She had a square chin, and  a straight thin-lipped mouth--straight save for a hint of a turn down  at the corners, which I fancied (and I have strange fancies) had been a  sign of weakness in the days before she grew hard. There was no sign  of weakness now. She had hard grey eyes and blue-black hair. She hadn't  spoken yet. She didn't ask me how the boy took ill or I got there, or  who or what I was--at least not until the next evening at tea-time.    She sat upright with Jim wrapped in the blanket and laid across her  knees, with one hand under his neck and the other laid lightly on him,  and she just rocked him gently.    She sat looking hard and straight before her, just as I've seen a tired  needlewoman sit with her work in her lap, and look away back into the  past. And Jim might have been the work in her lap, for all she seemed to  think of him. Now and then she knitted her forehead and blinked.    Suddenly she glanced round and said--in a tone as if I was her husband  and she didn't think much of me--    'Why don't you eat something?'    'Beg pardon?'    'Eat something!'    I drank some tea, and sneaked another look at her. I was beginning to  feel more natural, and wanted Jim again, now that the colour was coming  back into his face, and he didn't look like an unnaturally stiff and  staring corpse. I felt a lump rising, and wanted to thank her. I sneaked  another look at her.    She was staring straight before her,--I never saw a woman's face change  so suddenly--I never saw a woman's eyes so haggard and hopeless. Then  her great chest heaved twice, I heard her draw a long shuddering breath,  like a knocked-out horse, and two great tears dropped from her wide  open eyes down her cheeks like rain-drops on a face of stone. And in the  firelight they seemed tinged with blood.    I looked away quick, feeling full up myself. And presently (I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10366"],[0,"Freedom's Battle (#11)"],[1,"it. What he, the  whole of Mussalmans and therefore I think also the Hindus resist is the  shameless attempt of England and the other Powers under cover of  self-determination to emasculate and dismember Turkey. If I understand  the spirit of Islam properly, it is essentially republican in the truest  sense of the term. Therefore if Armenia or Arabia desired independence  of Turkey they should have it. In the case of Arabia, complete Arabian  independence would mean transference of the Khilafat to an Arab  chieftain. Arabia in that sense is a Mussulman trust, not purely  Arabian. And the Arabs without ceasing to be Mussulman, could not hold  Arabia against Muslim opinion. The Khalifa must be the custodian of the  Holy places and therefore also the routes to them. He must be able to  defend them against the whole world. And if an Arab chief arose who  could better satisfy that test than the Sultan of Turkey, I have no  doubt that he would be recognised as the Khalifa.    I have thus discussed the question academically. The fact is that  neither the Mussulmans nor the Hindus believe in the English Ministerial  word. They do not believe that the Arabs or the Armenians want complete  independence of Turkey. That they want self-government is beyond doubt.  Nobody disputes that claim. But nobody has ever ascertained that either  the Arabs or the Armenians desire to do away with all connection, even  nominal, with Turkey.    The solution of the question lies not in our academic discussion of the  ideal position, it lies in an honest appointment of a mixed commission  of absolutely independent Indian Mussulmans and Hindus and independent  Europeans to investigate the real wish of the Armenians and the Arabs  and then to come to a _modus vivendi_ where by the claims of the  nationality and those of Islam may be adjusted and satisfied.    It is common knowledge that Smyrna and Thrace including Adrianople have  been dishonestly taken away from Turkey and that mandates have been  unscrupulously established in Syria and Mesopotamia and a British  nominee has been set up in Hedjaj under the protection of British guns.  This is a position that is intolerable and unjust. Apart therefore from  the questions of Armenia and Arabia, the dishonesty and hypocrisy that  pollute the peace terms require to be instantaneously removed. It paves  the way to an equitable solution of the question of Armenian and Arabian  independence which in theory no one denies and which in practice may be  easily guaranteed if only the wishes of the people concerned could with  any degree of certainty be ascertained.      THE KHILAFAT AGITATION    A friend who has been listening to my speeches once asked me whether I  did not come under the sedition section of the Indian Penal Code. Though  I had not fully considered it, I told him that very probably I did and  that I could not plead 'not guilty' if I was charged under it. For I  must admit that I can pretend to no 'affection' for the present  Government.    And my speeches are intended to create 'dis-affection' such that the  people might consider it a shame to assist or co-operate with a  Government that had forfeited all title to confidence, respect or  support.    I draw no distinction between the Imperial and the Indian Government.  The latter has accepted, on the Khilafat, the policy imposed upon it by  the former. And in the Punjab case the former has endorsed the policy of  terrorism and emasculation of a brave people initiated by the latter.  British ministers have broken their pledged word and wantonly wounded  the feelings of the seventy million Mussulmans of India. Innocent men  and women were insulted by the insolent officers of the Punjab  Government. Their wrongs not only remain unrighted but the very officers  who so cruelly subjected them to barbarous humiliation retain office  under the Government.    When at Amritsar last year I pleaded with all the earnestness I could  command for co-operation with the Government and for response to the  wishes expressed in the Royal Proclamation. I did so because I honestly  believed that, a new era was about to begin, and that the old spirit of  fear, distrust and consequent terrorism was about to give place to the  new spirit of respect, trust and goodwill. I sincerely believed that the  Mussulman sentiment would be placated and that the officers that had  misbehaved during the Martial Law regime in the Punjab would be at least  dismissed and the people would be otherwise made to feel that a  Government that had always been found quick (and mighty) to punish  popular excesses would not fail to punish its agents' misdeeds. But to  my amazement and dismay I have discovered that the present  representatives of the Empire have become dishonest and unscrupulous.  They have no real regard for the wishes of the people of India and they  count Indian honour as of little consequence.    I can no longer retain affection for a Government so evilly manned as it  is now-a-days. And for me, it is humiliating to retain my freedom and be  witness to the continuing wrong. Mr. Montagu however is certainly right  in threatening me with deprivation of my liberty if I persist in  endangering the existence of the Government. For that must be the result  if my activity bears fruit. My only regret is that inasmuch as Mr.  Montagu admits my past services, he might have perceived that there must  be something exceptionally bad in the Government if a well-wisher like  me could no longer give his affection to it. It was simpler to insist on  justice being done to the Mussalmans and to the Punjab than to threaten  me with punishment so that the injustice might be perpetuated. Indeed I  fully expect it will be found that even in promoting disaffection  towards an unjust Government I had rendered greater services to the  Empire than I am already credited with.    At the present moment, however, the duty of those who approve my  activity is clear. They ought on no account to resent the deprivation of  my liberty, should the Government of India deem it to be their duty to  take it away. A citizen has no right to resist such restriction imposed  in accordance with the laws of the State to which he belongs. Much less  have those who sympathise with him. In my case there can be no question  of sympathy. For I deliberately oppose the Government to the extent of  trying to put its very existence in jeopardy. For my supporters,  therefore, it must be a moment of joy when I am imprisoned. It means the  beginning of success if only the supporters continue the policy for  which I stand. If the Government arrest me, they would do so in order to  stop the progress of Non-co-operation which I preach. It follows that if  Non-co-operation continues with unabated vigour, even after my arrest,  the Government must imprison others or grant the people's wish in order  to gain their co-operation. Any eruption of violence on the part of the  people even under provocation would end in disaster. Whether therefore  it is I or any one else who is arrested during the campaign, the first  condition of success is that there must be no resentment shown against  it. We cannot imperil the very existence of a Government and quarrel  with its attempt to save itself by punishing those who place it in  danger.      HIJARAT AND ITS MEANING    India is a continent. Its articulate thousands know what its  inarticulate millions are doing or thinking. The Government and the  educated Indians may think that the Khilafat movement is merely a  passing phase. The millions of Mussalmans think otherwise. The flight of  the Mussalmans is growing apace. The newspapers contain paragraphs in  out of the way corners informing the readers that a special train  containing a barrister with sixty women, forty children including twenty  sucklings, all told 765, have left for Afghanistan. They were cheered  _en route_. They were presented with cash, edibles and other things, and  were joined by more Muhajarins on the way. No fanatical preaching by  Shaukatali can make people break up and leave their homes for an unknown  land. There must be an abiding faith in them. That it is better for them  to leave a State which has no regard for their religious sentiment and  face a beggar's life than to remain in it even though it may be in a  princely manner. Nothing but pride of power can blind the Government of  India to the scene that is being enacted before it.    But there is yet another side to the movement. Here are the facts as  stated in the following Government _Communique_ dated 10th July 1920:--       An unfortunate affair in connection with the Mahajarin occurred on     the 8th instant at Kacha Garhi between Peshawar and Jamrud. The     following are the facts as at present reported. Two members of a     party of the Mahajarins proceeding by train to Jamrud were detected     by the British military police travelling without tickets.     Altercation ensued at Islamia College Station, but the train     proceeded to Kacha Garhi. An attempt was made to evict these     Mahajarins, whereupon the military police were attacked by a crowd of     some forty Mahajarins and the British officer who intervened was     seriously wounded with a spade. A detachment of Indian troops at     Kacha Garhi thereupon fired two or three shots at the Mahajarin for     making murderous assault on the British officer. One Mahajarin was     killed and one wounded and three arrested. Both the military and the     police were injured. The body of the Mahajarin was despatched to     Peshawar and buried on the morning of the 9th. This incident has     caused considerable excitement in Peshawar City, and the Khilafat     Hijrat Committee are exercising restraining influence. Shops were     closed on the morning of the 9th. A full enquiry has been instituted.    Now Peshawar to Jamrud is a matter of a few miles. It was clearly the  duty of the military not to"]]]
