The peoples in southern Russia were    influenced by the Greeks and by the Romans, although the Romans did not    try to bring them under their rule.      No modern empire has included so many important countries. If we compare    this vast territory with, the scattered colonies of the Greeks, we shall    understand how useful it was that the Romans adopted much of the Greek    civilization, for they could carry it to places that the Greeks    never reached.

[Illustration: ROMAN FARMER'S CALENDAR]          CHAPTER VIII      THE CIVILIZATION OF THE ROMAN WORLD    STRIFE AT ROME. While the Romans were conquering the ancient world    they had begun to quarrel among themselves. Certain men resolved that    Rome should not be managed any longer by the noble senators for their    own benefit or for the benefit of rich contractors and merchants. They    wished to have the idle crowds of men who packed the shows and circuses    settled as free farmers on the unused lands of Italy.      Among these new leaders were two brothers, Tiberius and Caius Gracchus,    sons of one of Rome's noblest families. The other nobles looked upon    them with hatred and killed them, first Tiberius and afterward Caius.    These murders did not end the trouble. The leaders on both sides armed    their followers, and bloody battles were fought in the streets. Generals    led their armies to Rome, although, according to the laws, to bring an    army into Italy south of the Rubicon River was to make war on the    republic and be guilty of treason. Once in the city these generals put    to death hundreds of their enemies.    CAESAR RULES ROME. The strife in the city had ceased for a time    when Pompey, a famous general, who had once shared power with Caesar as    a \"triumvir,\" joined the senators in planning his ruin. Caesar led his    army into Italy to the borders of the Rubicon. Exclaiming, \"The die is    cast,'\" he crossed the sacred boundary and marched straight to Rome.    Pompey and his party fled, and civil war divided the Roman world into    those who followed Caesar and those who followed Pompey, Caesar was    everywhere victorious, in Italy, Africa, Spain, and the East. He brought    back order into the government of the city and of the provinces, but in    the year 44 B.C. he was murdered in the senate-house by several    senators, one of whom, Marcus Brutus, had been his friend.    ORIGIN OF THE TITLE \"EMPEROR.\" Caesar had not been called    \"emperor,\" though the chief power had been his. One of his titles was    \"imperator,\" or commander of the army, a word from which our word    \"emperor\" comes. He was really the first emperor of Rome. In later times    the very word Caesar became an imperial title, not only in the Roman    Empire, but also in modern Germany, for \"Kaiser\" is another form of the    word \"Caesar.\"    BEGINNINGS OF THE EMPIRE. Caesar's successor was his grandnephew    Octavius, usually called Augustus, which was one of his titles. Augustus    carried out many of Caesar's plans for improving the government in Rome    and in the provinces. The people in the provinces were no longer robbed    by Roman officers. Many of them became Roman citizens. After a time all    children born within the empire were considered Romans, just as if they    had been born in Rome.    THE ROMAN EMPIRE. The Roman Empire carried on the work which the    republic had begun. It did some things better than the republic had done    them. Within its frontiers there was peace for two or three hundred    years. Many people had an opportunity to share in all the best that the    Greeks and Romans had learned. Unfortunately the peoples imitated the    bad as well as the good.    ROMAN ROADS. As builders the Romans taught much to those who lived    after them. Their great roads leading out from Rome have never been    excelled. In Gaul these roads served, centuries later, to mark out the    present French system of highroads and showed many a route to the    builders of railroads. They were made so solid that parts of them still    remain after two thousand years.      [Illustration: Augustus Caesar After the statue in the Vatican]    HOW THESE ROADS WERE BUILT. In planning their roads the Romans did    not hesitate before obstacles like hills or deep valleys or marshy    lands. They often pierced the hills with tunnels and bridged the valleys    or swamps. In building a road they dug a trench about fifteen feet wide    and pounded the earth at the bottom until it was hard. Upon this bottom    was placed a layer of rough stones, over which were put nine inches of    broken stone mixed with lime to form a sort of concrete. This was    covered by a layer six inches deep of broken bricks or broken tiles,    which when pounded down offered a hard, smooth surface. On the top were    laid large paving stones carefully fitted so that there need be no jar    when a wagon rolled over the road.      Such roads were necessary for the traders who passed to and fro    throughout the empire, but especially for troops or government    messengers sent with all speed to regions where there was danger of    revolt or where the frontiers were threatened by the barbarians.    [Illustration: CROSS-SECTION OF A ROMAN ROAD]    AQUEDUCTS. Next to their roads the most remarkable Roman structures    were the aqueducts which brought water to the city from rivers or    springs, some of them many miles away. Had they known, as we do, how to    make heavy iron pipes, their aqueducts would have been laid underground,    except where they crossed deep valleys. The lead pipes which they used    were not strong enough to endure the force of a great quantity of water,    and so when the aqueducts reached the edge of the plain which stretches    from the eastern hills to the walls of Rome, the streams of flowing    water were carried in stone channels resting upon arches which sometimes    reached the height of over ninety feet.    THE CLAUDIAN AQUEDUCT. The Claudian aqueduct, which is the most    magnificent ever built, is carried on such arches for about seven miles    and a half. Although broken in many places, and though the water has not    flowed through its lofty channels for sixteen hundred years, it is one    of the grandest sights in the neighborhood of Rome. If we add together    the lengths of the aqueducts, underground or carried on arches, which    provided Rome with her water supply, the total is over three hundred    miles. They could furnish Rome with a hundred million gallons of water    a day.      [Illustration: RUINS OF THE CLAUDIAN AQUEDUCT Completed by the    Roman Emperor Claudian in 52 A.D. The structure was nearly a hundred    feet high]    PUBLIC BATHS. The Romans used great quantities of water for their    public baths, which were large buildings with rooms especially made for    bathing in hot or cold water and for plunges. They were also, like the    Greek gymnasiums, places for exercise, conversation, and reading. Many    were built as monuments by wealthy men and by emperors. A very small fee    was charged for entrance, and the money was used to pay for repairs and    the wages of those who managed the baths.

These strange fellows had not asked his name, and neither had they  introduced themselves, but from their table talk he gathered that the  redhead was named Jeff, the funereal man with the bony face was Larry,  the brown-haired one was Joe, and he of the scar and the smile was  Henry. It occurred to Andy as odd that such rough boon companions had  not shortened that name for convenience.    They played with the most intense concentration. As the night deepened  and the windows became black slabs Joe brought another candle and  reenforced this light by hanging a lantern from a nail on the wall. This  illuminated the entire room, but in a partial and dismal manner. The  game went on. They were playing for high stakes; Andrew Lanning had  never seen so much cash assembled at one time. They had stacks of  unmistakable yellow gold before them--actually stacks. The winner was  Larry. That skull-faced gentleman was fairly barricaded behind heaps of  money. Andy estimated swiftly that there must be well over two thousand  dollars in those stacks.    He finished his supper, and, having taken the tin cup and plate out into  the next room and cleaned them, he had no sooner come back to the door,  on the verge of bidding them good night, then Henry invited him to sit  down and take a hand.          CHAPTER 12      He had never studied any men as he was watching these men at cards.  Andrew Lanning had spent most of his life quite indifferent to the  people around him, but now it was necessary to make quick and sure  judgments. He had to read unreadable faces. He had to guess motives. He  had to sense the coming of danger before it showed its face. And,  watching them with close intentness, he understood that at least three  of them were cheating at every opportunity. Henry, alone, was playing a  square game; as for the heavy winner, Larry, Andrew had reason to  believe that he was adroitly palming an ace now and then--luck ran too  consistently his way. For his own part, he was no card expert, and he  smiled as Henry made his offer.    \"I've got eleven dollars and fifty cents in my pocket,\" Andrew said  frankly. \"I won't sit in at that game.\"    \"Then the game is three-handed,\" said Henry as he got up from his chair.  \"I've fed you boys enough,\" he continued in his soft voice. \"I know a  three-handed game is no good, but I'm through. Unless you'll try a round  or two with 'em, stranger? They've made enough money. Maybe they'll play  for silver for the fun of it, eh, boys?\"    There was no enthusiastic assent. The three looked gravely at a victim  with eleven dollars and fifty cents, the chair of Big Jeff creaking  noisily as he turned. \"Sit in,\" said Jeff. He made a brief gesture, like  one wiping an obstacle out of the way. \"Alright,\" nodded Andy, for the  thing began to excite him. He turned to Henry. \"Suppose you deal  for us?\"    The scar on Henry's face changed color, and his habitual smile  broadened. \"Well!\" exclaimed Larry. \"Maybe the gent don't like the way  we been runnin' this game in other ways. Maybe he's got a few more  suggestions to make, sittin' in? I like to be obligin'.\"    He grinned, and the effect was ghastly.    \"Thanks,\" said Andy. \"That lets me out as far as suggestions go.\" He  paused with his hand on the back of the chair, and something told him  that Larry would as soon run a knife into him as take a drink of water.  The eyes burned up at him out of the shadow of the brows, but Andy,  though his heart leaped, made himself meet the stare. Suddenly it  wavered, and only then would Andy sit down. Henry had drawn up  another chair.    \"That idea looks good to me,\" he said. \"I think I shall deal.\" And  forthwith, as one who may not be resisted, he swept up the cards and  began to shuffle.    The others at once lost interest. Each of them nonchalantly produced  silver, and they began to play negligently, careless of their stakes.    But to Andy, who had only played for money half a dozen times before,  this was desperately earnest. He kept to a conservative game, and slowly  but surely he saw his silver being converted into gold. Only Larry  noticed his gains--the others were indifferent to it, but the  skull-faced man tightened his lips as he saw. Suddenly he began betting  in gold, ten dollars for each card he drew. The others were out of that  hand. Andy, breathless, for he had an ace down, saw a three and a two  fall--took the long chance, and, with the luck behind him, watched a  five-spot flutter down to join his draw. Yet Larry, taking the same  draw, was not busted. He had a pair of deuces and a four. There he  stuck, and it stood to reason that he could not win. Yet he bet  recklessly, raising Andy twice, until the latter had no more money on  the table to call a higher bet. The showdown revealed an ace under cover  for Larry also. Now he leaned across the table, smiling at Andrew.    \"I like the hand you show,\" said Larry, \"but I don't like your face  behind it, my friend.\"    His smile went out; his hand jerked back; and then the lean, small hand  of Henry shot out and fastened on the tall man's wrist. \"You skunk!\"  said Henry. \"D'you want to get the kid for that beggarly mess? Bah!\"    Andy, colorless, his blood cold, brushed aside the arm of the  intercessor.    \"Partner,\" he said, leaning a little forward in turn, and thereby making  his holster swing clear of the seat of his chair, \"partner, I don't mind  your words, but I don't like the way you say 'em.\"    When he began to speak his voice was shaken; before he had finished, his  tones rang, and he felt once more that overwhelming desire which was  like the impulse to fling himself from a height. He had felt it before,  when he watched the posse retreat with the body of Bill Dozier. He felt  it now, a vast hunger, an almost blinding eagerness to see Larry make an  incriminating move with his bony, hovering right hand. The bright eyes  burned at him for a moment longer out of the shadow. Then, again, they  wavered, and turned away.    Andy knew that the fellow had no more stomach for a fight. Shame might  have made him go through with the thing he started, however, had not  Henry cut in again and given Larry a chance to withdraw gracefully.    \"The kid's called your bluff, Larry,\" he said. \"And the rest of us don't  need to see you pull any target practice. Shake hands with the kid, will  you, and tell him you were joking!\"    Larry settled back in his chair with a grunt, and Henry, without a  word, tipped back in his chair and kicked the table. Andy, beside him,  saw the move start, and he had just time to scoop his own winnings,  including that last rich bet, off the table top and into his pocket. As  for the rest of the coin, it slid with a noisy jangle to the floor, and  it turned the other three men into scrambling madmen. They scratched and  clawed at the money, cursing volubly, and Andy, stepping back out of the  fracas, saw the scar-faced man watching with a smile of contempt. There  was a snarl; Jeff had Joe by the throat, and Joe was reaching for his  gun. Henry moved forward to interfere once more, but this time he was  not needed. A clear whistling sounded outside the house, and a moment  later the door was kicked open. A man came in with his saddle on  his hip.    His appearance converted the threatening fight into a scene of jovial  good nature. The money was swept up at random, as though none of them  had the slightest care what became of it.    \"Havin' one of your little parties, eh?\" said the stranger. \"What  started it?\"    \"He did, Scottie,\" answered Larry, and, stretching out an arm of  enormous length, he pointed at Andrew.    Again it required the intervention of Henry to explain matters, and  Scottie, with his hands on his hips, turned and surveyed Andrew with  considering eyes. He was much different from the rest. Whereas, they had  one and all a peculiarly unhealthy effect upon Andy, this newcomer was a  cheery fellow, with an eye as clear as crystal, and color in his tanned  cheeks. He had one of those long faces which invariably imply  shrewdness, and he canted his head to one side while he watched Andy.  \"You're him that put the pinto in the corral, I guess?\" he said.    Andy nodded.    There was no further mention of the troubles of that card game. Jeff and  Joe and Larry were instantly busied about the kitchen and in arranging  the table, while Scottie, after the manner of a guest, bustled about and  accomplished little.    But the eye of Andy, then and thereafter, whenever he was near the five,  kept steadily upon the scar-faced man. Henry had tilted his chair back  against the wall. The night had come on chill, with a rising wind that  hummed through the cracks of the ill-built wall and tossed the flame in  the throat of the chimney; Henry draped a coat like a cloak around his  shoulders and buried his chin in his hands, separated from the others by  a vast gulf. Presently Scottie was sitting at the table. The others were  gathered around him in expectant attitudes.    \"What's new?\" they exclaimed in one voice.    \"Oh, about a million things. Let me get some of this ham into my face,  and then I'll talk. I've got a batch of newspapers yonder. There's a  gold rush on up to Tolliver's Creek.\"    Andy blinked, for that news was at least four weeks old. But now came a  tide of other news, and almost all of it was stale stuff to him. But the  men drank it in--all except Henry, silent in his corner. He was relaxed,  as if he slept. \"But the most news is about the killing of Bill Dozier.\"          CHAPTER 13      \"Ol' Bill!\" grunted red-headed Jeff. \"Well, I'll be hung! There's one  good deed done. He was overdue, anyways.\"    Andy, waiting breathlessly, watched lest the eye of the narrator should  swing toward him for the least part of a second. But Scottie seemed  utterly oblivious of the fact that he sat in the same room with the  murderer. \"Well, he got it,\" said Scottie. \"And he didn't"]]]
