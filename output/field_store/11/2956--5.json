Everyone sees the absolute  from his individual plane of vision. That conception which you have of  God will do for you. I say, it will do for you and you alone. Don't force  it upon others. Keep it for yourself. If you want to improve this  conception of God pray in the Silence thus: \"O, THOU, I UNDERSTAND NOT  THY NATURE. I KNOW NOT--YET I YEARN TO KNOW. DO THOU REVEAL THYSELF  UNTO MY SOUL. DO THOU OPEN MY SPIRITUAL EYES AND LEAD ME ON.\" Student,  don't treat this lightly. Listen not to that conceited or blinded brother  of yours who says he does not care for God--who says he can go on without  the aid of God. Listen not. Listen not. The strongest and greatest pray  often. Only they do not talk of this to others. They never make a show of  their devotion. But they have all prayed and do all pray. They believe in  personal effort--they also believe in Divine leading and guidance. Learn  to be \"lead by the Spirit.\" Everything shall come to you in this way. You  will also notice that the Fearless Man is not a mere God-fearing man. He  is a God-loving Individual. He loves God for God's sake largely. That man  who is fearful in spite of his devotion to God is a sham devotee. But the  grace of the LORD'S name is such that it shall purify the most impure of  heart. It shall build up even a sham devotee into a real devotee who in  time shall transcend all limitation. Therefore have faith in God. \"Be  regular\" in your devotions. Also remember that each trial is a pain  accompanying spiritual regeneration--each pain a process of strengthening  the herald of a mere glorious dawn of wisdom. Hence give up all grumbling.  The great God whose Infinite power regulates the motions of planets  and yet takes note of the sparrow's fall has your soul's best interest at  heart. All you do, all you say, all you feel, all you hope, all your  experiences--all, all is His will. Man's Will is God's Will. God's Will  is Man's Will. And who can define God? God alone has the power to define  Himself. He has defined Himself as the Universe--Bramhanda. Nothing is  impossible for the devotee of God. Let him but be willing to work and God  shall give him everything. Regular devotion to God will surely develop  extreme Fearlessness. \"God is Love.\"    (2). KNOWLEDGE _(Gnayanam)_.    Fear is due to ignorance. When in the dark of night you mistook the rope  for a snake, you shrieked out in terror. Cause? IGNORANCE. But when you  saw the rope as a rope, you laughed out in amusement. Cause? KNOWLEDGE.  All your fear is due to your ignorance of your real nature. All the fear  at the last is fear of death. You have to realise through knowledge of  the Vedanta that you are birthless, deathless. You have to unfold by  meditation a consciousness of your Real Self. I give you hereunder a  meditation exercise that will help you in this direction.    MEDITATION EXERCISE NO. 1.    Retire into the SILENCE. Shut off all thoughts and purposes relating  to the external world. Try to realise that you, the Real Ego are not  the body but that it is a mere garment you have put on for functioning  on the physical plane and which you shall put off some day. Try to  realise that you are immortal and that although a thousand bodies might  come and go, you, the Ego, shall be as alive as ever. These are your  shadows--your personalities. What dies and is born is a mirage--a  mere phantasm--which you materialise for certain purposes. All these  purposes centralise in one POTENTIALISED PURPOSE--the conquest of matter.  Realise that you the Ego, have your dwelling in Supernal Regions--on the  spiritual plane--with your Father-in-Heaven--but that you have come down  into matter that you may find the fullest possible objective expression.  Realise that you, the Ego, are a differentiated centre of consciousness  in the Great Consciousness--THE ABSOLUTE--EGO--SUM of the entire Universe  with all its gross and subtle manifestations--that you are endowed with  all the powers and attributes of the Absolute Self. Realise that you are  not the emotional and passional manifestations--surging up in your  personality. These are subject to the law of Flux and Rhythm and must be  brought under the control of Reason and Will--the balancing, equating  principle of mind. Realise that you are not the mind nor the intellect,  but that you exercise this function in order to analyse the external  manifestations of nature and study same. Realise that you are pure  Consciousness, Bliss and Existence in your essential nature--one with the  all-life. Realise that the form side of manifestation is but a  concentration, a precipitation within you. Your subjective nature is one  with the subjective self of others--an inlet for the influx and  efflux of the GREAT SUB-CONSCIOUS. Realise thus your Unity with  All-Life-manifesting objectively as Universal Brotherhood of all living  beings and the perfect recognition of the All-Father-Mother, the Great  Cosmic Power and Intelligence known as God whose intelligence  all-blissfulness and existence are ever pouring into each Unit of  Individualised Divine Energy and evolving through nature. And, student,  when you meditate daily that you are neither the body nor the emotions  nor the mind, you shall then unfold the consciousness of the \"I am I\"  that which rules the personality that which has been called  Soul-Consciousness. You shall then be Chaitanya-Spiritually awake.  You shall then know no Fear. Fear shall drop away like a worn-out  sheath. All fear-thoughts are due to undeveloped race-consciousness  which reacts upon individual consciousness and is stamped more or less  upon every atom of matter. You 'fear' because you think you are the  body. When you realise that you can command as many bodies for your  use as you like; when you realise in your heart of hearts that you are a  Spiritual Being expressing and energising through material personalities;  when you realise that you cannot die, fear shall be afraid of you and  drop tormenting and teasing you. Fear resides in the matter-fed  mind--that mind which has been grown and matured by the reception and  re-action upon external sensations and stimuli--what has been called  the objective mind. This mind identifies itself with the form, the body.  It has an incorrigible determination towards the form-side, the  concrete-side of existence. It sees nothing but the body and is darkened  by the forces of _Maya_. It sees nothing but separation. Yes, it is the  matter-fed mind. People with a development of this side of consciousness  are invariably selfish; have generally small, conical eyes, understand  nothing, but the welfare of the body. They are subject to the fear and  the delight in making others fear them. This mind needs illumination from  the soul, the Subjective Man, the \"I am I\" side of consciousness. It is  not that you are a body and have a soul--this is the dirty conviction of  the matter-fed mind--but you are a soul and have a body. The dawn of  Soul-Consciousness makes a man a Force for good. He himself is Fearless.  His is the voice of strength that does not crush and dominate but that  puts warmth, life, energy, hope and indomitable courage into cold and  despairing hearts. Some are born with this Soul-Consciousness. Do not  think that I am feeding with the theories of eccentricity. Often when a  boy playing with others the thought would strike me hard, \"Are you the  same that is running and jumping and shouting.\" I would stop, looking  blankly ahead. A feeling of confusion would come over me and I would  forget everything. I could recall the feeling distinctly and vividly. Now  I understand. These were flashes of Soul-Consciousness unfolded in a  past life and struggling for \"recognition\" in this life. Such men face  DEATH for themselves calmly. They know they can't die. Such men are  incapable of sustained hatred. They too have their physiognomical  signs and distinctions. They represent an advanced order of intellect.  And, lastly, when the full blaze of realisation comes, your one object in  life shall be to bestow your sense of freedom on others. You shall  not be able to mock and smile calmly at the pain, the ignorance to  imperfections of your brother-man. You shall realise what it is to 'feel'  for humanity, yea, even for animals. You shall glimpse, in some measures,  the great feeling of pain that rent the hearts of the Buddas, the  Christs, the Ramakrishnas, the Vivekanandas of this world. They suffered,  they felt for humanity. And when undeveloped humanity forced them to the  Cross; they bore it in the same spirit in which the gentle nurse bears  the blows and abuses of the disease-racked patient. \"Father forgive them,  for they know not what they do.\" Verily to know all is to forgive all.  This Soul-Consciousness is as much yours as that of anyone. It comes  through meditation on the Infinite, and the Formless Absolute--the  Over-soul of the universe--the Brahman of the Vedanta--the Self of the  philosophers--the Atman of the Yogis--the personal--impersonal God  of the devotee--and, last, but not least, the humanity of the  humanitarian.      CONCENTRATION.    The mind can think of one thing only. Fear is an acute form of negative  concentration--worry its chronic form. If you learn how to place your  mind upon a particular subject and inhibit or \"shut off\" all other  thoughts, the fascination of fear and worry shall have no power over you.  Most of the things you fear never happen--others can be routed by a bold  front. Even if something ugly does befall you, you have the power within  to enable you to 'bear up' heroically. Fear is a mere negative  thought-habit. It is a negative tendency in the mind. You can best  eradicate this weed from your mind by cultivating the positive attitude  of Courage. There are particular sets of brain-cells being created or  destroyed by particular types of thoughts. The best way "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13325"],[0,"Sketches of the Natural History of Ceylon (#11)"],[1," there exists any element  or quality which acts as a prophylactic. Such exceptional provisions are  not without precedent in the animal oeconomy: the hornbill feeds with  impunity on the deadly fruit of the strychnos; the milky juice of some  species of euphorbia, which is harmless to oxen, is invariably fatal to  the zebra; and the tsetse fly, the pest of South Africa, whose bite is  mortal to the ox, the dog, and the horse, is harmless to man and the  untamed creatures of the forest.[1]    [Footnote 1: Dr. LIVINGSTONE, _Tour in S. Africa_, p. 80. Is it a fact  that, in America, pigs extirpate the rattlesnakes with impunity?]    The Singhalese distinguish one species of mongoos, which they designate  \"_Hotambeya_\" and which they assert never preys upon serpents. A writer  in the _Ceylon Miscellany_ mentions, that they are often to be seen  \"crossing rivers and frequently mud-brooks near Chilaw; the adjacent  thickets affording them shelter, and their food consisting of aquatic  reptiles, crabs, and mollusca.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: This is possibly the \"musbilai\" or mouse-cat of Behar,  which preys upon birds and fish. Can it be the Urva of the Nepalese  (_Urva cancrivora_, Hodgson), which Mr. Hodgson describes as dwelling in  burrows, and being carnivorous and ranivorous?--Vide _Journ. As. Soc.  Beng._ vol. vi. p. 56.]    [Illustration: FLYING SQUIRREL.]    IV. RODENTIA. _Squirrels_.--Smaller animals in great numbers enliven the  forests and lowland plains with their graceful movements. Squirrels[1],  of which there are a great variety, make their shrill metallic call  heard at early morning in the woods; and when sounding their note of  warning on the approach of a civet or a tree-snake, the ears tingle with  the loud trill of defiance, which rings as clear and rapid as the  running down of an alarum, and is instantly caught up and re-echoed from  every side by their terrified playmates.    [Footnote 1: Of two kinds which frequent the mountains, one which is  peculiar to Ceylon was discovered by Mr. Edgar L. Layard, who has done  me the honour to call it the _Sciurus Tennentii_. Its dimensions are  large, measuring upwards of two feet from head to tail. It is  distinguished from the _S. macrurus_ by the predominant black colour of  the upper surface of the body, with the exception of a rusty spot at the  base of the ears.]    One of the largest, belonging to a closely allied subgenus, is known as  the \"Flying Squirrel,\"[1] from its being assisted, in its prodigious  leaps from tree to tree, by a parachute formed by the skin of the  flanks, which, on the extension of the limbs front and rear, is  laterally expanded from foot to foot. Thus buoyed up in its descent, the  spring which it is enabled to make from one lofty tree to another  resembles the flight of a bird rather than the bound of a quadruped.    [Footnote 1: Pteromys oral., _Tickel_. P. petaurista, _Pallas_.]    Of these pretty creatures there are two species, one common to Ceylon  and India, the other (_Sciuropterus Layardii_, Kelaart) is peculiar to  the island, and by far the most beautiful of the family.    _Rats_.--Among the multifarious inhabitants to which the forest affords  at once a home and provender is the tree rat[1], which forms its nest on  the branches, and by turns makes its visits to the dwellings of the  natives, frequenting the ceilings in preference to the lower parts of  houses. Here it is incessantly followed by the rat-snake[2], whose  domestication is encouraged by the servants, in consideration of its  services in destroying vermin. I had one day an opportunity of  surprising a snake that had just seized on a rat of this description,  and of covering it suddenly with a glass shade, before it had time to  swallow its prey. The serpent, appeared stunned by its own capture, and  allowed the rat to escape from its jaws, which cowered at one side of  the glass in the most pitiable state of trembling terror. The two were  left alone for some moments, and on my return to them the snake was as  before in the same attitude of sullen stupor. On setting them at  liberty, the rat bounded towards the nearest fence; but quick as  lightning it was followed by its pursuer, which seized it before it  could gain the hedge, through which I saw the snake glide with its  victim in its jaws. In parts of the central province, at Oovah and  Bintenne, the house-rat is eaten as a common article of food. The  Singhalese believe it and the mouse to be liable to hydrophobia.    [Footnote 1: There are two species of the tree rat in Ceylon: M.  rufescens, _Gray_; (M. flavescens, _Elliot_;) and Mus nemoralis,  _Blyth_.]    [Footnote 2: Coryphodon Blumenbachii, _Merr_.]    Another indigenous variety of the rat is that which made its appearance  for the first time in the coffee plantations on the Kandyan hills in the  year 1847; and in such swarms does it continue to infest them, at  intervals, that as many as a thousand have been killed in a single day  on one estate. In order to reach the buds and blossoms of the coffee, it  cuts such of the slender branches as would not sustain its weight, and  feeds on them when fallen to the ground; and so delicate and sharp are  its incisors, that the twigs thus destroyed are detached by as clean a  cut as if severed with a knife.    The coffee-rat[1] is an insular variety of the _Mus hirsutus_ of W.  Elliot, found in Southern India. They inhabit the forests, making their  nests among the roots of the trees, and feeding, in the season, on the  ripe seeds of the nilloo. Like the lemmings of Norway and Lapland, they  migrate in vast numbers on the occurrence of a scarcity of their  ordinary food. The Malabar coolies are so fond of their flesh, that they  evince a preference for those districts in which the coffee plantations  are subject to their incursions, where they fry the rats in coco-nut  oil, or convert them into curry.    [Footnote 1: Golunda Ellioti, _Gray_.]    [Illustration: COFFEE RAT.]    _Bandicoot_.--Another favourite article of food with the coolies is the  pig-rat or Bandicoot[1], which attains on those hills the weight of two  or three pounds, and grows to nearly the length of two feet. As it feeds  on grain and roots, its flesh is said to be delicate, and much  resembling young pork.    [Footnote 1: Mus bandicota, _Beckst._ The English term bandicoot is a  corruption of the Telinga name _pandikoku_, literally _pig-rat_.]    Its nests, when rifled, are frequently found to contain considerable  quantities of rice, stored up against the dry season.    [Illustration: BANDICOOT.]    _Porcupine_.--The Porcupine[1] is another of the _rodentia_ which has  drawn down upon itself the hostility of the planters, from its  destruction of the young coconut palms, to which it is a pernicious and  persevering, but withal so crafty, a visitor, that it is with difficulty  any trap can be so disguised, or any bait made so alluring, as to lead  to its capture. The usual expedient in Ceylon is to place some of its  favourite food at the extremity of a trench, so narrow as to prevent the  porcupine turning, whilst the direction of his quills effectually bars  his retreat backwards. On a newly planted coconut tope, at Hang-welle,  within a few miles of Colombo, I have heard of as many as twenty-seven  being thus captured in a single night; but such success is rare. The  more ordinary expedient is to smoke them out by burning straw at the  apertures of their burrows. At Ootacamund, on the continent of the  Dekkan, spring-guns have been used with great success by the  Superintendent of the Horticultural Gardens; placing them so as to sweep  the runs of the porcupines. The flesh is esteemed a delicacy in Ceylon,  and in consistency, colour, and flavour it very much resembles young  pork.    [Footnote 1: Hystrix leucurus, _Sykes_.]    V. EDENTATA. _Pengolin_.--Of the Edentata the only example in Ceylon is  the scaly ant-eater, called by the Singhalese, Caballaya, but usually  known by its Malay name of _Pengolin_[1], a word indicative of its  faculty, when alarmed, of \"rolling itself up\" into a compact ball, by  bending its head towards its stomach, arching its back into a circle,  and securing all by a powerful fold of its mail-covered tail. The feet  of the pengolin are armed with powerful claws, which in walking they  double in, like the ant-eater of Brazil. These they use in extracting  their favourite food from ant-hills and decaying wood. When at liberty,  they burrow in the dry ground to a depth of seven or eight feet, where  they reside in pairs, and produce annually one or two young.[2]    [Footnote 1: Manis pentadactyla, _Linn._]    [Footnote 2: I am assured that there is a hedge-hog in Ceylon; but as I  have never seen it, I cannot tell whether it belongs to either of the  two species known in India (_Erinaceus mentalis_ and _E. collaris_)--nor  can I vouch for its existence there at all. But the fact was told to me,  in connexion with the statement, that its favourite dwelling is in the  same burrow with the pengolin. The popular belief in this is attested by  a Singhalese proverb, in relation to an intrusive personage; the import  of which is that he is like \"_a hedge-hog in the den of a pengolin_.\"]    Of two specimens which I kept alive at different times, one, about two  feet in length, from the vicinity of Kandy, was a gentle and affectionate  creature, which, after wandering over the house in search of ants, would  attract attention to its wants by climbing up my knee, laying hold of my  leg with its prehensile tail. The other, more than double that length,  was caught in the jungle near Chilaw, and brought to me in Colombo. I  had always understood that the pengolin was unable to climb trees; but  the one last mentioned frequently ascended a tree in my garden, in  search of ants; and this it effected by means of its hooked feet, aided  by an oblique grasp of the tail. The ants it seized by extending its"]]]
