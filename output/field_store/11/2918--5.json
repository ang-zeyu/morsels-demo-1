Toward evening it fell calm, and  the islands and high land were still in sight. The calm continued during  the greatest part of the following day; but toward evening a light and  favourable breeze sprung up, which enabled us to cross the tropic of  Capricorn, and bend our course toward the Cape of Good Hope.    On the night of Friday the 7th we had heavy squalls of rain, thunder, and  lightning. From that time until the 1lth the wind was rather  unfavourable; but shifting to the northward on that day, it blew during  the two following in strong gales, with squalls of heavy rain, attended  with much sea.     These strong gales having, on Friday the 14th, terminated in a calm,  Lieutenant Shortland, the day following, reported to the commanding  officer, that there were eleven soldiers sick on board the _Alexander_  and five or six convicts on board the _Charlotte_. The calm continued  until the 16th, when a favourable breeze sprung up; but those ships of  the fleet which could sail were prevented from making the most of the  fair wind, by the _Lady Penrhyn_ transport and others, which were  inattentive, and did not make sail in proper time.    On the 19th the wind was fresh, and frequently blew in squalls, attended  with rain. In one of these squalls the _Charlotte_ suddenly hove-to, a  convict having fallen overboard; the man, however, was drowned. Our  weather was at this time extremely cold; and the wind, which had for some  days been unfavourable, shifting on the 22nd, we again looked towards the  Cape. At one o'clock the next morning it came on to blow very hard,  accompanied with a great sea; we had nevertheless the satisfaction to  observe that the convoy appeared to get on very well, though some of them  rolled prodigiously. This gale continued with very little variation until  the morning of the 28th, when it moderated for a few hours, and shifted  round to the SE. It now again blew in fresh gales, attended with much  rain and sea. But a calm succeeding all this violence shortly after, on  Sunday morning the 30th the weather was sufficiently clear to admit of  some altitudes being taken for the time-keeper, when our longitude was  found to be 3 degrees 04 minutes.    October.] Thence to the 4th of October both wind and weather were very  uncertain, the wind sometimes blowing in light airs, very little  differing from a calm, with clear skies; at others, in fresh breezes,  with rain. On the 4th, Captain Phillip was informed that thirty of the  convicts on board of the _Charlotte_ were 111; some of them, as it was  feared, dangerously. To render this information still more unpleasant,  the wind was foul during the two succeeding days.    In the forenoon of Saturday the 6th, four seamen of the _Alexander_  transport were sent on board the _Sirius_, under a charge of having  entered into a conspiracy to release some of the prisoners while the ship  should be at the Cape of Good Hope, and of having provided those people  with instruments for breaking into the fore-hold of the ship (which had  been done, and some provisions stolen thereout). The four seamen were  ordered to remain in the _Sirius_, a like number of her people being sent  in lieu of them on board the transport.    On Thursday the 11th, by an altitude of the sun taken that morning, the  fleet was found to be in the longitude of 15 degrees 35 minutes E at  which time there was an unfavourable change of the wind, and the sick on  board the _Charlotte_ were not decreasing in number.    On the next day, as it was judged from the information given by the  time-keeper that we were drawing nigh the land, the _Supply_ was sent  forward to make it; but it was not seen until the following morning.    At noon on the 13th the _Supply_ was sent to instruct the sternmost ships  of the convoy in what direction they should keep to enter the bay; and  about four in the afternoon, the harbour-master getting on board the  _Sirius_, that ship was brought safely to an anchor in Table Bay, the  convoy doing the same before dark; having crossed over from one Continent  to the other, a distance of upwards of eleven hundred leagues, in the  short space of five weeks and four days, fortunately without separation,  or any accident having happened to the fleet.    Immediately on our anchoring, an officer from the _Sirius_ was sent on  shore to the governor, who politely promised us every assistance in his  power; and at sun-rise the next morning the _Sirius_ saluted the garrison  with thirteen guns, which were returned by an equal number from the fort.    From the great uncertainty of always getting readily on shore from the  bay, and the refreshments found at the Cape of Good Hope being so  necessary after, and so well adapted to the fatigues and disorders  consequent on a long voyage, we found it a custom with most strangers on  their arrival to take up their abode in the town, with some one or other  of the inhabitants, who would for two rix-dollars (eight shillings of  English money) or a ducatoon (six shillings English) per week, provide  very good lodgings, and a table amply furnished with the best meats,  vegetables, and fruits which could be procured at the Cape. This custom  was, as far as the nature of our service would admit, complied with by  several officers from the ships; and, on the second day after our  arrival, Captain Phillip, with the principal officers of the navy and  settlement, proceeded to the government-house in the Company's garden,  where they were introduced to Mr. Van de Graaf (the governor, for the  Dutch East India Company, of this place and its dependencies) and by him  politely received.    With a requisition made by Captain Phillip of a certain quantity of flour  and corn, the governor expressed his apprehensions of being unable to  comply, as the Cape had been very lately visited by that worst of  scourges--a famine, which had been most severely felt by every family in  the town, his own not excepted. This was a calamity which the settlement  had never before experienced, and was to be ascribed rather to bad  management of, than any failure in, the late crops. Measures were however  taking to guard, as much as human precaution could guard, against such a  misfortune in future; and magazines were erecting for the reception of  grain on the public account, which had never been found necessary until  fatal experience had suggested them. Captain Phillip's request was to be  laid before the Council, without whose concurrence in such a business the  governor could not act, and an answer was promised with all convenient  dispatch. This answer, however, did not arrive until the 23rd, when  Captain Phillip was informed that every article which he had demanded was  ordered to be furnished.    November.] In the meantime the ships of the fleet had struck their yards  and topmasts (a precaution always necessary here to guard against the  violence of the south-east wind, which had been often known to drive  ships out of the bay) and began filling their water. On board of the  _Sirius_ and some of the transports, the carpenters were employed in  fitting up stalls for the reception of the cattle that was to be taken  hence as stock for the intended colony at New South Wales. These were not  ready until the 8th of the next month, November, on which day, 1 bull, 1  bull-calf, 7 cows, 1 stallion, 3 mares, and 3 colts, together with as  great a number of rams, ewes, goats, boars, and breeding sows, as room  could be provided for, were embarked in the different ships, the bulls  and cows on board the _Sirius_, the horses on board the _Lady Penrhyn_;  the remainder were put into the _Fishbourn_ store-ship and _Friendship_  transport.    Shortly after our arrival in the bay, a soldier belonging to the Swiss  regiment of Muron, quartered here, swam off from his post and came on  board one of the transports, requesting to be permitted to proceed in her  to New South Wales; but, as an agreement had been mutually entered into  between the Dutch and English commanders, that deserters in the service  of, or subjects of either nation, should be given up, Captain Phillip  sent him on shore, previously obtaining a promise of his pardon from the  regiment.    On the 9th the watering of the fleet being completed, corn and hay for  the stock, and flour, wine, and spirits for the settlement, being all on  board, preparations were made for putting to sea, and on the 10th the  signal was made to unmoor.    The convicts while in this port had been served, men and women, with one  pound and an half of soft bread each _per diem_; a pound of fresh beef,  or mutton, and three quarters of a pound for each child, together with a  liberal allowance of vegetables.    While in this harbour, as at Rio de Janeiro, Mr. Johnson, the chaplain,  preached on board two of the transports every Sunday; and we had the  satisfaction to see the prisoners all wear the appearance of perfect  health on their being about to quit this port, the last whereat any  refreshment was to be expected before their arrival in New South Wales.    As it was earnestly wished to introduce the fruits of the Cape into the  new settlement, Captain Phillip was ably assisted in his endeavours to  procure the rarest and the best of every species, both in plant and seed,  by Mr. Mason, the king's botanist, whom we were so fortunate as to meet  with here, as well as by Colonel Gordon, the commander in chief of the  troops at this place; a gentleman whose thirst for natural knowledge  amply qualified him to be of service to us, not only in procuring a great  variety of the best seeds and plants, but in pointing out the culture,  the soil, and the proper time of introducing them into the ground.    The following plants and seeds were procured here and at Rio de Janeiro:    AT RIO DE JANEIRO    Coffee--both seed and plant  Cocoa-in the nut  Cotton-seed  Banana-plant  Oranges--various sorts, seed and plant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12573"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 08 (#11)"],[1," a white hen which she kept in a coop, telling it that it  would have to be killed when John came. She had repeated these  proceedings for many years, and people never ceased telling her that  she was foolish to be thus continually thinking of the return of her  John.    This autumn it would be eighteen years since John had gone away, and  every year John Michael Winkler was reported in the paper as missing,  which would be done until his fiftieth year--he was now in his  thirty-sixth. The story circulated in the village that John had gone  among the gipsies. Once, indeed, his mother had mistaken a young gipsy  for him; he was a man who bore a striking resemblance to her missing  son, in that he was small of stature and had the same dark complexion;  and he had seemed rather pleased at being taken for John. But the mother  had put him to the proof, for she still had John's hymn-book and his  confirmation verse; and, inasmuch as the stranger did not know this  verse and could not tell who were his sponsors, or what had happened to  him on the day when Brosi's Severin arrived with his English wife, and  later on when the new well was dug at the town-hall--inasmuch as he did  not satisfy these and other proofs, he could not be the right man. And  yet Marianne used to give the gipsy a lodging whenever he came to the  village, and the children in the streets used to cry \"John!\" after him.    John was advertised as being liable to military duty and as a deserter;  and although his mother declared that he would have slipped through  under the measuring-stick as \"too short,\" she knew that he would not  escape punishment if he returned, and inferred that this was the reason  why he did not return. And it was very strange to hear her praying,  almost in the same breath, for the welfare of her son and the death of  the reigning prince; for she had been told that when the sovereign died,  his successor would proclaim a general amnesty for all past offenses.    Every year Marianne used to ask the schoolmaster to give her the page in  the newspaper in which her John was advertised for, and she always put  it with his hymn-book. But this year it was a good thing that Marianne  could not read, so that the schoolmaster could send her another page in  place of the one she wanted. For a strange rumor was going through the  whole village; whenever two people stood together talking, they would be  saying:    \"Black Marianne must not be told anything about it. It would kill  her--it would drive her crazy.\"    For a report, coming from the Ambassador in Paris, had passed through a  number of higher and lower officers, until it reached the Village  Council; it stated that, according to a communication received from  Algiers, John Winkler of Haldenbrunn had perished in that colony during  an outpost skirmish. There was much talk in the village of the singular  fact that so many in high departments should have concerned themselves  so much about the dead John. But this stream of well-confirmed  information was arrested before it had reached the end of its course.    At a meeting of the Village, Council it was determined that nothing at  all should be said to Black Marianne about it. It would be wrong, they  said, to embitter the last few years of her life by taking her one  comfort away from her.    But instead of keeping the report secret, the first thing the members of  the Council did was to talk of it in their homes, and it was not long  before the whole village knew about it, excepting only Black Marianne.  Every one, afraid of betraying the secret to her, looked at her with  strange glances; no one addressed her, and even her greetings were  scarcely returned. It was only Marianne's peculiar disposition that  prevented her from noticing this. And indeed, if any one did speak to  her and was drawn on to say anything about John's death, it was done in  the conjectural and soothing way to which she had been accustomed for  years; and Marianne did not believe it now any more than she had  formerly, because nobody ever said anything definite about the report of  his decease.    It would have been better if Amrei had known nothing about it, but there  was a strange, seductive charm in getting as close as possible to a  subject that was forbidden. Accordingly every one spoke to Amrei of the  mournful event, warned her not to tell Black Marianne anything about  it, and asked if the mother had no presentiments or dreams of her son's  death--if his spirit did not haunt the house. After she heard of it  Amrei was always trembling and quaking in secret; for she alone was  always near Black Marianne, and it was terrible to know something which  she was obliged to conceal from her. Even the people in whose house  Black Marianne had rented a small room could no longer bear to have her  near them, and they showed their sympathy by giving her notice to quit.    But how strangely things are associated in this life! As a result of  this very thing Amrei experienced joy as well as grief--for it opened up  her parents' home to her again. Black Marianne went to live there, and  Amrei, who at first trembled as she went back and forth in the house,  carrying water or making a fire, always thinking that now her father and  mother must come, afterward began gradually to feel quite at home in it.  She sat spinning day and night, until she had earned enough money to buy  back her parents' cuckoo-clock from Coaly Mathew. Now she had at least  one household article of her own! But the cuckoo had fared badly among  strangers; it had lost half of its voice, and the other half seemed to  stick in its throat--it could only cry \"cook\"--and as often as it did  that, Amrei would involuntarily add the missing \"oo.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Black Marianne could not bear to hear the clock cuckoo and fixed the  pendulum so that it would not work, saying that she always had the time  in her head. And it was indeed wonderful how true this was--at any  minute she could tell what time it was, although it was of very little  consequence to her. In fact, this waiting, expectant woman possessed a  remarkable degree of alertness, for as she was always listening to hear  her son coming, she was naturally wide-awake all the time. And, although  she never visited anybody in the village, and spoke to nobody, she knew  everybody, and all about the most secret things that went on in the  place. She could infer a great deal from the manner in which people met  one another, and from words she overheard here and there. And because  this seemed very wonderful, she was feared and avoided. She often used  to describe herself, according to a local expression, as an  \"old-experienced\" woman, and yet she was exceedingly active. Every day,  year in and year out, she ate a few juniper berries, and people said  that was the reason why she was so vigorous and showed her sixty-six  years so little. The fact that the two sixes stood together caused her,  according to an old country saying[3] (which, however, was not  universally believed in) to be regarded as a witch. It was said that she  sometimes milked her black goat for hours at a time, and that this goat  gave an astonishing quantity of milk, but that in milking this goat she  was in reality drawing the milk out of the udders of the cows belonging  to persons she hated, and that she had an especial grudge against Farmer  Rodel's cattle. Moreover, Marianne's successful poultry-keeping was also  looked upon as witchcraft; for where did she get the food, and how was  it that she always had chickens and eggs to sell? It is true that in  the summer she was often seen collecting cock-chafers, grasshoppers, and  all kinds of worms, and on moonless nights she was seen gliding like a  will-o'-the-wisp among the graves in the churchyard, where she would be  carrying a burning torch and collecting the large black worms that crept  out, all the time muttering to herself. It was even said that in the  quiet winter nights she held wonderful conversations with her goat and  with her fowls, which she housed in her room during the winter. The  entire wild army of tales of witchcraft and sorcery, banished by school  education, came back and attached itself to Black Marianne.    Amrei sometimes felt afraid in the long, silent winter nights, when she  sat spinning by Black Marianne, and nothing was heard but an occasional  sleepy clucking from the fowls, or a dreamy bleat from the goat. And it  seemed truly magical how fast Marianne spun! She even said once:    \"I think my John is helping me to spin.\" And then again she complained  that this winter, for the first time, she had not thought wholly and  solely of her John. She took her self to task for it and called herself  a bad mother, and complained that it seemed all the time as if the  features of her John were slowly vanishing before her--as if she were  forgetting what he had done at such and such a time, how he had laughed,  sung, and wept, and how he had climbed the tree and jumped into the  ditch.           *       *       *       *       *    But however cheerfully and brightly Marianne might begin to speak, she  always ended by relapsing into gloomy complaint and mourning; and she  who professed to like to be alone and to think of nothing and to love  nothing, only lived to think about her son and to love him. Consequently  Amrei made up her mind to release herself from this uncanny position of  being alone with Black Marianne; she demanded that Damie should be taken  into the house. At first Marianne opposed it vehemently, but when Amrei  threatened to leave the house herself, and then coaxed her in such a  childlike way and tried so hard to do whatever would best please her,  the old woman at last consented.    Damie, who had learned from Crappy Zachy to knit wool, now sat beneath  the parental roof again; and at night, when the brother and sister were  asleep in the garret,"]]]
