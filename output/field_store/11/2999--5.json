The name of the engraving company is always engraved with great pains  and is very accurate. It will be seen on the upper and lower margin  of the note. This, in counterfeits, is not quite uniform or even.  The words \"one dollar,\" as on the one dollar greenbacks, are to be  considered as a sample of solid print.      BANK-NOTE PAPER.    Bank-notes are printed upon paper composed of linen, the qualify of  which is not always the same, and it varies in thickness. Therefore,  the paper is not always a sure test, but it is important. The  manufacture of this paper is a profound secret, as carefully kept as  the combinations to the great vaults where the government's millions  lie awaiting further river and harbor bills. It is made only at  the Dalton mill, which dates back almost to colonial days. What its  combinations are nobody knows except those intimately connected with  its manufacture. The secret of the paper-making is jealously guarded,  as is also the paper itself. From the moment it is made until it gets  into the treasury vaults it is carefully guarded. It goes there in  small iron safes, the sheets carefully counted, and all precautions  against its loss being taken both by the government officials and by  the express companies which carry it.      COUNTERFEIT SIGNATURES.    Sometimes genuine notes are stolen before they are signed; then the  only thing about them made counterfeit is the signatures. Those who  are familiar with the signatures of the officers of the bank where  notes are purloined, may not be lead into error, as such signatures  usually appear more or less cramped or unsteady; but there is no sure  protection against a counterfeit of this kind for those who do not  have special knowledge of the signatures.    [Illustration: UNITED STATES TREASURY BUILDING, WASHINGTON, D.C.]      ALTERED BANK-NOTES.    Bank-notes are altered in two ways, namely: raising the denomination,  and changing the name of a broken to that of a responsible bank.    First, in altering a note, it is scraped until thin: then figures of  larger denomination are pasted over. A pasted note may be detected by  holding it up to the light, when the pasted parts will appear darker,  as they are thicker.    Second, the denomination of a note is raised by taking out a low one  with an acid, and printing in a higher one with a counterfeit stamp.  The ink used in genuine bank-note printing is a peculiar kind, and  not easily to be obtained by counterfeiters: therefore, their printing  will not appear as clear and bright as that of the government, which  is done with ink of the finest quality. If the ink is black, it gives  a clear and glossy impression, without any of that smutty appearance,  as is sometimes seen in counterfeit bank-notes. It is almost  impossible to imitate the green ink that is used by the government,  and it is nearly as difficult to imitate the red and other colors.  Counterfeit inks look dull and muddy, while genuine inks have a glossy  appearance.    In the case of a note altered by the use of acid, it may be  noticed that the acid, by spreading more than was intended by the  counterfeiter, has injured parts of other letters, and the paper will  appear more or less stained by the acid.      COMPARING AND EXAMINING NOTES.    A counterfeit should be compared with one that is genuine, in order  to familiarize one's self with the distinguishing features which have  already been indicated.    It is best to acquire the habit of giving each note as received a  searching glance, turning it over to see the back, and if there be  any defect, it will probably catch the eye. If there be the least  suspicion, a critical examination of all its parts should be made.    In case of doubt, the lathe work should be carefully examined, and it  may be compared with a perfectly good bill; then examine the shading  around the letters, and search for any sign of alteration in the  title or denomination of the note. If there are any medallion heads or  shields, notice the lines; if there is any red letter work, designed  to appear on both sides, look at the character of the work on the  face, then turn the note and examine the back. If the printing is  not exactly alike on both sides, but varies in any part the note is  counterfeit. Then observe the vignettes and portraits, to see whether  their style and perfection compare well with the work on genuine  notes. Then examine the solid print and engravers' names, as well as  the printing, ink, and paper. By such thorough examination, one can  hardly be at a loss to determine the status of the note.    Good magnifying glasses are necessary, in most instances, to bring out  the fine lines on bank-notes. Sometimes a microscope of great power is  required to discern the genuine line.      PIECING, ETC.    Counterfeiters sometimes make ten bills of nine by what is termed  piecing. Thus, a counterfeit note is cut into ten pieces by the  counterfeiter, and these pieces are used in piecing nine genuine  bills, from each of which a piece has been cut. The nine genuine  pieces, thus obtained, are then pasted together, and with the tenth  counterfeit piece added, make a tenth bill, which is the gain.    Piecing bank-bills is not a very successful practice. One who  possesses such information as here given, can readily detect the  difference between the counterfeit and the genuine. This difference  is, however, made less apparent by the counterfeiter, who defaces  the counterfeit part, so as to give the note a worn appearance.  Counterfeiting is rendered very difficult in consequence of the  remarkable excellence of the work on the government and national  currency, as also from the difficulty of imitating the green. But this  currency, if successfully imitated by counterfeiters, will repay large  outlay and care, as the greenbacks pass anywhere in the nation, and a  counterfeit may be carried to other states or sections as it becomes  known in any particular locality. National bank currency may be  counterfeited by preparing a plate, and then with simple change in the  name of the bank the counterfeit can be adapted to the various towns  where banks are located. This much is written, not to lessen the value  of or confidence in the issues of the government, but to admonish the  public against the dangers of a false security.

[Illustration]      Volumes might be written on the necessity of, and the various methods  employed for, advertising. Many prosperous men owe their success  in life to judicious and liberal advertising. In this age of strong  competition in the various avenues of trade, he who does not advertise  his wares will probably be outdone by a more ambitious dealer, with  perhaps a poorer article, who advertises liberally. People go where  they are invited, and the merchant who advertises freely, places his  store and windows in attractive order, and leaves the door open, will  do far more business than he who does not cater to the public, is  indifferent about appearances, gruff, and complaining of hard times.    Horace Greeley laid it down as a rule that a merchant should  advertise equal to his rent. This, like all good rules, ought to have  exceptions. An old and well established business would not require  so much, while a new enterprise would require more than this amount  expended judiciously in advertising. The merchant should decide at the  beginning of the year about, what amount he may expend in advertising  during the year, and then endeavor to place that amount in the best  possible manner before the public.    An advertiser should not be discouraged too soon. Returns are often  slow and inadequate. Time is required to familiarize the public with a  new article or new name. Some men have given up in despair, when just  on the eve of reaping a harvest of success by this means. Many of the  most prosperous and wealthy business men in this country have at times  been driven hard to meet their advertising bills, but they knew that  this was their most productive outlay, and by persistently continuing  it they weathered the storm.      NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING.    Select the newspaper which circulates among the class of persons  desired to reach. Do not advertise a special article or business  designed for a limited class of customers, in a general newspaper.  Almost all trades and occupations in these latter days have their  special journals, and these afford the best means of reaching that  class of persons. The purpose of the advertiser then should be to  discover, first, the character of a paper's circulation, and second,  the extent of its circulation. On these two essentials may then be  based an estimate of its value as an advertising medium. The character  of a paper's circulation is easily determined by the quality of the  reading matter which the paper contains, and the general tone imparted  to it by its conductors. The extent of a paper's circulation bears  chiefly on the rates of advertising, which, other things being equal,  should have a direct ratio to it. The extent of circulation is a  matter of almost constant misrepresentation on the part of publishers  or their agents.    As a rule, the most prominent and costly part of the paper is the  best. In country weeklies the \"local items,\" or next to them, is  preferable. In city journals containing a large amount of reading  matter, a well displayed advertisement on the outside pages is perhaps  the best for most classes of business.

You will easily imagine how much  this intelligence affected me; and Mrs. Temple and Constance shared my  anxiety and solicitude. Constance and I talked much with one another  that morning. Unaffected anxiety had largely removed her reserve, and  she spoke openly of her feelings towards my brother, not concealing her  partiality for him. I on my part let her understand how welcome to me  would be any union between her and John, and how sincerely I should  value her as a sister.    It was a wild winter's morning, with some snow falling and a high wind.  The house was in the disordered condition which is generally observable  on the day following a ball or other important festivity. I roamed  restlessly about, and at last found my way to the picture-gallery,  which had formed the scene of John's adventure on the previous night.  I had never been in this part of the house before, as it contained no  facilities for heating, and so often remained shut in the winter months.  I found a listless pleasure in admiring the pictures which lined the  walls, most of them being portraits of former members of the family,  including the famous picture of Sir Ralph Temple and his family,  attributed to Holbein. I had reached the end of the gallery and sat  down in the oriel watching the snow-flakes falling sparsely, and the  evergreens below me waving wildly in the sudden rushes of the wind. My  thoughts were busy with the events of the previous evening,--with John's  illness, with the ball,--and I found myself humming the air of a waltz  that had caught my fancy. At last I turned away from the garden scene  towards the gallery, and as I did so my eyes fell on a remarkable  picture just opposite to me.    It was a full-length portrait of a young man, life-size, and I had  barely time to appreciate even its main features when I knew that I had  before me the painted counterfeit of my brother's vision. The discovery  caused me a violent shock, and it was with an infinite repulsion that  I recognised at once the features and dress of the man whom John had  seen rising from the chair at Oxford. So accurately had my brother's  imagination described him to me, that it seemed as if I had myself seen  him often before. I noted each feature, comparing them with my brother's  description, and finding them all familiar and corresponding exactly.  He was a man still in the prime of life. His features were regular and  beautifully modelled; yet there was something in his face that inspired  me with a deep aversion, though his brown eyes were open and brilliant.  His mouth was sharply cut, with a slight sneer on the lips, and his  complexion of that extreme pallor which had impressed itself deeply on  my brother's imagination and my own.    After the first intense surprise had somewhat subsided, I experienced  a feeling of great relief, for here was an extraordinary explanation  of my brother's vision of last night. It was certain that the flash  of lightning had lit up this ill-starred picture, and that to his  predisposed fancy the painted figure had stood forth as an actual  embodiment. That such an incident, however startling, should have been  able to fling John into a brain-fever, showed that he must already have  been in a very low and reduced state, on which excitement would act much  more powerfully than on a more robust condition of health. A similar  state of weakness, perturbed by the excitement of his passion for  Constance Temple, might surely also have conjured up the vision which  he thought he saw the night of our leaving Oxford in the summer.  These thoughts, my dear Edward, gave me great relief; for it seemed  a comparatively trivial matter that my brother should be ill, even  seriously ill, if only his physical indisposition could explain away the  supernatural dread which had haunted us for the past six months. The  clouds were breaking up. It was evident that John had been seriously  unwell for some months; his physical weakness had acted on his brain;  and I had lent colour to his wandering fancies by being alarmed by them,  instead of rejecting them at once or gently laughing them away as I  should have done. But these glad thoughts took me too far, and I was  suddenly brought up by a reflection that did not admit of so simple an  explanation. If the man's form my brother saw at Oxford were merely an  effort of disordered imagination, how was it that he had been able to  describe it exactly like that represented in this picture? He had never  in his life been to Royston, therefore he could have no image of the  picture impressed unconsciously on or hidden away in his mind. Yet his  description had never varied. It had been so close as to enable me to  produce in my fancy a vivid representation of the man he had seen; and  here I had before me the features and dress exactly reproduced. In the  presence of a coincidence so extraordinary reason stood confounded, and  I knew not what to think. I walked nearer to the picture and scrutinised  it closely.    The dress corresponded in every detail with that which my brother had  described the figure as wearing at Oxford: a long cut-away coat of green  cloth with an edge of gold embroidery, a white satin waistcoat with  sprigs of embroidered roses, gold-lace at the pocket-holes, buff silk  knee-breeches, and low down on the finely modelled neck a full cravat  of rich lace. The figure was posed negligently against a fluted stone  pedestal or short column on which the left elbow leant, and the right  foot was crossed lightly over the left. His shoes were of polished  black leather with heavy silver buckles, and the whole costume was very  old-fashioned, and such as I had only seen worn at fancy dress balls. On  the foot of the pedestal was the painter's name, \"BATTONI pinxit, Romae,  1750.\" On the top of the pedestal, and under his left elbow, was a long  roll apparently of music, of which one end, unfolded, hung over the  edge.    For some minutes I stood still gazing at this portrait which so much  astonished me, but turned on hearing footsteps in the gallery, and saw  Constance, who had come to seek for me.    \"Constance,\" I said, \"whose portrait is this? It is a very striking  picture, is it not?\"    \"Yes, it is a splendid painting, though of a very bad man. His name was  Adrian Temple, and he once owned Royston. I do not know much about him,  but I believe he was very wicked and very clever. My mother would be  able to tell you more. It is a picture we none of us like, although so  finely painted; and perhaps because he was always pointed out to me from  childhood as a bad man, I have myself an aversion to it. It is singular  that when the very bright flash of lightning came last night while your  brother John and I were sitting here, it lit this picture with a  dazzling glare that made the figure stand out so strangely as to seem  almost alive. It was just after that I found that John had fainted.\"    The memory was not a pleasant one for either of us and we changed the  subject. \"Come,\" I said, \"let us leave the gallery, it is very cold  here.\"    Though I said nothing more at the time, her words had made a great  impression on me. It was so strange that, even with the little she knew  of this Adrian Temple, she should speak at once of his notoriously evil  life, and of her personal dislike to the picture. Remembering what my  brother had said on the previous night, that in the presence of this man  he felt himself brought face to face with some indescribable wickedness,  I could not but be surprised at the coincidence. The whole story seemed  to me now to resemble one of those puzzle pictures or maps which I have  played with as a child, where each bit fits into some other until the  outline is complete. It was as if I were finding the pieces one by one  of a bygone history, and fitting them to one another until some terrible  whole should be gradually built up and stand out in its complete  deformity.    Dr. Empson spoke gravely of John's illness, and entertained without  reluctance the proposal of Mrs. Temple, that Dr. Dobie, a celebrated  physician in Derby, should be summoned to a consultation. Dr. Dobie came  more than once, and was at last able to report an amendment in John's  condition, though both the doctors absolutely forbade anyone to visit  him, and said that under the most favourable circumstances a period of  some weeks must elapse before he could be moved.    Mrs. Temple invited me to remain at Royston until my brother should be  sufficiently convalescent to be moved; and both she and Constance, while  regretting the cause, were good enough to express themselves pleased  that accident should detain me so long with them.    As the reports of the doctors became gradually more favourable, and our  minds were in consequence more free to turn to other subjects, I spoke  to Mrs. Temple one day about the picture, saying that it interested me,  and asking for some particulars as to the life of Adrian Temple.    \"My dear child,\" she said, \"I had rather that you should not exhibit  any curiosity as to this man, whom I wish that we had not to call an  ancestor. I know little of him myself, and indeed his life was of such  a nature as no woman, much less a young girl, would desire to be well  acquainted with. He was, I believe, a man of remarkable talent, and  spent most of his time between Oxford and Italy, though he visited  Royston occasionally, and built the large hall here, which we use as a  dancing-room. Before he was twenty wild stories were prevalent as to his  licentious life, and by thirty his name was a by-word among sober and  upright people. He had constantly with him at Oxford and on his travels  a boon companion called Jocelyn, who aided him in his wickednesses,  until on one of their Italian tours Jocelyn left him suddenly and became  a Trappist monk. It was currently reported that some wild deed of Adrian  Temple had shocked even him,"]]]
