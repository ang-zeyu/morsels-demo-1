[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8159"],[0,"Wanderings in South America (#10)"],[1,"procured a healthy full-grown one, a short piece of a poisoned  blow-pipe arrow was broken off and run up into its thigh, as near as  possible betwixt the skin and the flesh, in order that it might not be  incommoded by the wound. For the first minute it walked about, but  walked very slowly, and did not appear the least agitated. During the  second minute it stood still, and began to peck the ground; and ere  half another had elapsed it frequently opened and shut its mouth. The  tail had now dropped and the wings almost touched the ground. By the  termination of the third minute it had sat down, scarce able to support  its head, which nodded, and then recovered itself, and then nodded  again, lower and lower every time, like that of a weary traveller  slumbering in an erect position; the eyes alternately open and shut.  The fourth minute brought on convulsions, and life and the fifth  terminated together.    The flesh of the game is not in the least injured by the poison, nor  does it appear to corrupt sooner than that killed by the gun or knife.  The body of this fowl was kept for sixteen hours in a climate damp and  rainy, and within seven degrees of the equator, at the end of which  time it had contracted no bad smell whatever and there were no symptoms  of putrefaction, saving that just round the wound the flesh appeared  somewhat discoloured.    The Indian, on his return home, carefully suspends his blow-pipe from  the top of his spiral roof, seldom placing it in an oblique position,  lest it should receive a cast.    Here let the blow-pipe remain suspended while you take a view of the  arms which are made to slay the larger beasts of the forest.    When the Indian intends to chase the peccari, or surprise the deer, or  rouse the tapir from his marshy retreat, he carries his bow and arrows,  which are very different from the weapons already described.    The bow is generally from six to seven feet long and strung with a cord  spun out of the silk-grass. The forests of Guiana furnish many species  of hard wood, tough and elastic, out of which beautiful and excellent  bows are formed.    The arrows are from four to five feet in length, made of a yellow reed  without a knot or joint. It is found in great plenty up and down  throughout Guiana. A piece of hard wood about nine inches long is  inserted into the end of the reed, and fastened with cotton well waxed.  A square hole an inch deep is then made in the end of this piece of  hard wood, done tight round with cotton to keep it from splitting. Into  this square hole is fitted a spike of coucourite-wood, poisoned, and  which may be kept there or taken out at pleasure. A joint of bamboo,  about as thick as your finger, is fitted on over the poisoned spike to  prevent accidents and defend it from the rain, and is taken off when  the arrow is about to be used. Lastly, two feathers are fastened the  other end of the reed to steady it in its flight.    Besides his bow and arrows, the Indian carries a little box made of  bamboo which holds a dozen or fifteen poisoned spikes six inches long.  They are poisoned in the following manner: a small piece of wood is  dipped in the poison, and with this they give the spike a first coat.  It is then exposed to the sun or fire. After it is dry it receives  another coat, and then dried again; after this a third coat, and  sometimes a fourth.    They take great care to put the poison on thicker at the middle than at  the sides, by which means the spike retains the shape of a two-edged  sword. It is rather a tedious operation to make one of these arrows  complete, and as the Indian is not famed for industry, except when  pressed by hunger, he has hit upon a plan of preserving his arrows  which deserves notice.    About a quarter of an inch above the part where the coucourite spike is  fixed into the square hole he cuts it half through, and thus, when it  has entered the animal, the weight of the arrow causes it to break off  there, by which means the arrow falls to the ground uninjured, so that,  should this be the only arrow he happens to have with him and should  another shot immediately occur, he has only to take another poisoned  spike out of his little bamboo box, fit it on its arrow, and send it to  its destination.    Thus armed with deadly poison, and hungry as the hyaena, he ranges  through the forest in quest of the wild-beasts' track. No hound can act  a surer part. Without clothes to fetter him or shoes to bind his feet,  he observes the footsteps of the game where an European eye could not  discern the smallest vestige. He pursues it through all its turns and  windings with astonishing perseverance, and success generally crowns  his efforts. The animal, after receiving the poisoned arrow, seldom  retreats two hundred paces before it drops.    In passing over-land from the Essequibo to the Demerara we fell in with  a herd of wild hogs. Though encumbered with baggage and fatigued with a  hard day's walk, an Indian got his bow ready and let fly a poisoned  arrow at one of them. It entered the cheek-bone and broke off. The wild  hog was found quite dead about one hundred and seventy paces from the  place where he had been shot. He afforded us an excellent and wholesome  supper.    Thus the savage of Guiana, independent of the common weapons of  destruction, has it in his power to prepare a poison by which he can  generally ensure to himself a supply of animal food: and the food so  destroyed imbibes no deleterious qualities. Nature has been bountiful  to him. She has not only ordered poisonous herbs and roots to grow in  the unbounded forests through which he strays, but has also furnished  an excellent reed for his arrows, and another still more singular for  his blow-pipe, and planted trees of an amazing hard, tough and elastic  texture out of which he forms his bows. And in order that nothing might  be wanting, she has superadded a tree which yields him a fine wax and  disseminated up and down a plant not unlike that of the pine-apple  which affords him capital bow-strings.    Having now followed the Indian in the chase and described the poison,  let us take a nearer view of its action and observe a large animal  expiring under the weight of its baneful virulence.    Many have doubted the strength of the wourali poison. Should they ever  by chance read what follows, probably their doubts on that score will  be settled for ever.    In the former experiment on the dog some faint resistance on the part  of Nature was observed, as if existence struggled for superiority, but  in the following instance of the sloth life sunk in death without the  least apparent contention, without a cry, without a struggle and  without a groan. This was an ai, or three-toed sloth. It was in the  possession of a gentleman who was collecting curiosities. He wished to  have it killed in order to preserve the skin, and the wourali poison  was resorted to as the easiest death.    Of all animals, not even the toad and tortoise excepted, this poor  ill-formed creature is the most tenacious of life. It exists long after  it has received wounds which would have destroyed any other animal, and  it may be said, on seeing a mortally-wounded sloth, that life disputes  with death every inch of flesh in its body.    The ai was wounded in the leg, and put down on the floor about two feet  from the table; it contrived to reach the leg of the table, and  fastened itself on it, as if wishful to ascend. But this was its last  advancing step: life was ebbing fast though imperceptibly, nor could  this singular production of Nature, which has been formed of a texture  to resist death in a thousand shapes, make any stand against the  wourali poison.    First one fore-leg let go its hold, and dropped down motionless by its  side; the other gradually did the same. The fore-legs having now lost  their strength, the sloth slowly doubled its body and placed its head  betwixt its hind-legs, which still adhered to the table; but when the  poison had affected these also it sunk to the ground, but sunk so  gently that you could not distinguish the movement from an ordinary  motion, and had you been ignorant that it was wounded with a poisoned  arrow you would never have suspected that it was dying. Its mouth was  shut, nor had any froth or saliva collected there.    There was no _subsultus tendinum_ or any visible alteration in its  breathing. During the tenth minute from the time it was wounded it  stirred, and that was all; and the minute after life's last spark went  out. From the time the poison began to operate you would have  conjectured that sleep was overpowering it, and you would have  exclaimed: \"Pressitque jacentem, dulcis et alta quies, placidaeque  simillima morti.\"    There are now two positive proofs of the effect of this fatal poison:  viz. the death of the dog and that of the sloth. But still these  animals were nothing remarkable for size, and the strength of the  poison in large animals might yet be doubted were it not for what  follows.    A large well-fed ox, from nine hundred to a thousand pounds weight, was  tied to a stake by a rope sufficiently strong to allow him to move to  and fro. Having no large coucourite spikes at hand, it was judged  necessary, on account of his superior size, to put three wild-hog  arrows into him: one was sent into each thigh just above the hock in  order to avoid wounding a vital part, and the third was shot traversely  into the extremity of the nostril.    The poison seemed to take effect in four minutes. Conscious as though  he would fall, the ox set himself firmly on his legs and remained quite  still in the same place till about the fourteenth minute, when he  smelled the ground and appeared as if inclined to walk. He advanced a  pace or two, staggered and fell, and remained extended on his side,  with his head on the ground. His eye, a few minutes ago so bright and  lively, now became fixed and dim, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8172"],[0,"History of Astronomy (#10)"],[1,", in Lincolnshire, where he had  been born; that he was sitting one day in the garden, reflecting upon  the force which prevents a planet from flying off at a tangent and  which draws it to the sun, and upon the force which draws the moon to  the earth; and that he saw in the case of the planets that the sun's  force must clearly be unequal at different distances, for the pull out  of the tangential line in a minute is less for Jupiter than for  Mars. He then saw that the pull of the earth on the moon would be less  than for a nearer object. It is said that while thus meditating he saw  an apple fall from a tree to the ground, and that this fact suggested  the questions: Is the force that pulled that apple from the tree the  same as the force which draws the moon to the earth?  Does the  attraction for both of them follow the same law as to distance as is  given by the planetary motions round the sun? It has been stated that  in this way the first conception of universal gravitation arose.[1]    Quite the most important event in the whole history of physical  astronomy was the publication, in 1687, of Newton's _Principia  (Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica)_. In this great work  Newton started from the beginning of things, the laws of motion, and  carried his argument, step by step, into every branch of physical  astronomy; giving the physical meaning of Kepler's three laws, and  explaining, or indicating the explanation of, all the known heavenly  motions and their irregularities; showing that all of these were  included in his simple statement about the law of universal  gravitation; and proceeding to deduce from that law new irregularities  in the motions of the moon which had never been noticed, and to  discover the oblate figure of the earth and the cause of the  tides. These investigations occupied the best part of his life; but he  wrote the whole of his great book in fifteen months.    Having developed and enunciated the true laws of motion, he was able  to show that Kepler's second law (that equal areas are described by  the line from the planet to the sun in equal times) was only another  way of saying that the centripetal force on a planet is always  directed to the sun. Also that Kepler's first law (elliptic orbits  with the sun in one focus) was only another way of saying that the  force urging a planet to the sun varies inversely as the square of the  distance. Also (if these two be granted) it follows that Kepler's  third law is only another way of saying that the sun's force on  different planets (besides depending as above on distance) is  proportional to their masses.    Having further proved the, for that day, wonderful proposition that,  with the law of inverse squares, the attraction by the separate  particles of a sphere of uniform density (or one composed of  concentric spherical shells, each of uniform density) acts as if the  whole mass were collected at the centre, he was able to express the  meaning of Kepler's laws in propositions which have been summarised as  follows:--    The law of universal gravitation.--_Every particle of matter in the  universe attracts every other particle with a force varying inversely  as the square of the distance between them, and directly as the  product of the masses of the two particles_.[2]    But Newton did not commit himself to the law until he had answered  that question about the apple; and the above proposition now enabled  him to deal with the Moon and the apple. Gravity makes a stone fall  16.1 feet in a second. The moon is 60 times farther from the earth's  centre than the stone, so it ought to be drawn out of a straight  course through 16.1 feet in a minute. Newton found the distance  through which she is actually drawn as a fraction of the earth's  diameter.  But when he first examined this matter he proceeded to use  a wrong diameter for the earth, and he found a serious discrepancy.  This, for a time, seemed to condemn his theory, and regretfully he  laid that part of his work aside. Fortunately, before Newton wrote the  _Principia_ the French astronomer Picard made a new and correct  measure of an arc of the meridian, from which he obtained an accurate  value of the earth's diameter. Newton applied this value, and found,  to his great joy, that when the distance of the moon is 60 times the  radius of the earth she is attracted out of the straight course 16.1  feet per minute, and that the force acting on a stone or an apple  follows the same law as the force acting upon the heavenly bodies.[3]    The universality claimed for the law--if not by Newton, at least by  his commentators--was bold, and warranted only by the large number of  cases in which Newton had found it to apply. Its universality has been  under test ever since, and so far it has stood the test. There has  often been a suspicion of a doubt, when some inequality of motion in  the heavenly bodies has, for a time, foiled the astronomers in their  attempts to explain it. But improved mathematical methods have always  succeeded in the end, and so the seeming doubt has been converted into  a surer conviction of the universality of the law.    Having once established the law, Newton proceeded to trace some of its  consequences. He saw that the figure of the earth depends partly on  the mutual gravitation of its parts, and partly on the centrifugal  tendency due to the earth's rotation, and that these should cause a  flattening of the poles. He invented a mathematical method which he  used for computing the ratio of the polar to the equatorial diameter.    He then noticed that the consequent bulging of matter at the equator  would be attracted by the moon unequally, the nearest parts being most  attracted; and so the moon would tend to tilt the earth when in some  parts of her orbit; and the sun would do this to a less extent,  because of its great distance. Then he proved that the effect ought to  be a rotation of the earth's axis over a conical surface in space,  exactly as the axis of a top describes a cone, if the top has a sharp  point, and is set spinning and displaced from the vertical. He  actually calculated the amount; and so he explained the cause of the  precession of the equinoxes discovered by Hipparchus about 150 B.C.    One of his grandest discoveries was a method of weighing the heavenly  bodies by their action on each other. By means of this principle he  was able to compare the mass of the sun with the masses of those  planets that have moons, and also to compare the mass of our moon with  the mass of the earth.    Thus Newton, after having established his great principle, devoted his  splendid intellect to the calculation of its consequences. He proved  that if a body be projected with any velocity in free space, subject  only to a central force, varying inversely as the square of the  distance, the body must revolve in a curve which may be any one of the  sections of a cone--a circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola; and he  found that those comets of which he had observations move in parabolae  round the Sun, and are thus subject to the universal law.    Newton realised that, while planets and satellites are chiefly  controlled by the central body about which they revolve, the new law  must involve irregularities, due to their mutual action--such, in  fact, as Horrocks had indicated. He determined to put this to a test  in the case of the moon, and to calculate the sun's effect, from its  mass compared with that of the earth, and from its distance. He proved  that the average effect upon the plane of the orbit would be to cause  the line in which it cuts the plane of the ecliptic (i.e., the line of  nodes) to revolve in the ecliptic once in about nineteen years. This  had been a known fact from the earliest ages. He also concluded that  the line of apses would revolve in the plane of the lunar orbit also  in about nineteen years; but the observed period is only ten  years. For a long time this was the one weak point in the Newtonian  theory. It was not till 1747 that Clairaut reconciled this with the  theory, and showed why Newton's calculation was not exact.    Newton proceeded to explain the other inequalities recognised by Tycho  Brahe and older observers, and to calculate their maximum amounts as  indicated by his theory. He further discovered from his calculations  two new inequalities, one of the apogee, the other of the nodes, and  assigned the maximum value. Grant has shown the values of some of  these as given by observation in the tables of Meyer and more modern  tables, and has compared them with the values assigned by Newton from  his theory; and the comparison is very remarkable.

Considering that some of these perturbations had never been  discovered, that the cause of none of them had ever been known, and  that he exhibited his results, if he did not also make the  discoveries, by the synthetic methods of geometry, it is simply  marvellous that he reached to such a degree of accuracy. He invented  the infinitesimal calculus which is more suited for such calculations,  but had he expressed his results in that language he would have been  unintelligible to many.    Newton's method of calculating the precession of the equinoxes,  already referred to, is as beautiful as anything in the _Principia_.
