We give opposite illustrations of Schreiber's apparatus for revivifying  bone-black or animal charcoal. The object of revivification is to render  the black fit to be used again after it has lost its decolorizing  properties through service--that is to say, to free its pores from the  absorbed salts and insoluble compounds that have formed therein  during the operation of sugar refining. There are two methods  employed--fermentation and washing. At present the tendency is to  abandon the former in order to proceed with as small a stock of black as  possible, and to adopt the method of washing with water and acid in a  rotary washer.    Figs. 1 and 2 represent a plan and elevation of a bone-black room,  containing light filters, A, arranged in a circle around wells, B. These  latter have the form of a prism with trapezoidal base, whose small sides  end at the same point, d, and the large ones at the filter. The funnel,  E, of the washer, F, is placed in the space left by the small ends of  the wells, so that the black may be taken from these latter and thrown  directly into the washer. The washer is arranged so that the black may  flow out near the steam fitter, G, beneath the floor. The discharge of  this filter is toward the side of the elevator, H, which takes in the  wet black below, and carries it up and pours it into the drier situated  at the upper part of the furnace. This elevator, Figs. 3 and 4, is  formed of two vertical wooden uprights, A, ten centimeters in thickness,  to which are fixed two round-iron bars the same as guides. The lift,  properly so-called, consists of an iron frame, C, provided at the four  angles with rollers, D, and supporting a swinging bucket, E, which, on  its arrival at the upper part of the furnace, allows the black to fall  to an inclined plane that leads it to the upper part of the drier. The  left is raised and lowered by means of a pitch-chain, F, fixed to the  middle of the frame, C, and passing over two pulleys, G, at the upper  part of the frame and descending to the mechanism that actuates it.  This latter comprises a nut, I, acting directly on the chain; a toothed  wheel, K, and a pinion, J, gearing with the latter and keyed upon the  shaft of the pulleys, L and M. The diameter of the toothed wheel, K, is  0.295 of a meter, and it makes 53.4 revolutions per minute. The diameter  of the pinion is 0.197 of a meter, and it makes 80 revolutions per  minute. The pulleys, M and L, are 0.31 of a meter in diameter, and  make 80 revolutions per minute. Motion is transmitted to them by other  pulleys, N, keyed upon a shaft placed at the lower part, which receives  its motion from the engine of the establishment through the intermedium  of the pulley, O. The diameter of the latter is 0.385 of a meter, and  that of N is 0.58. They each make 43 revolutions per minute.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--ELEVATION OF BONE-BLACK REVIVIFYING PLANT  (SCHREIBER'S SYSTEM.)    FIG. 2.--PLAN VIEW.    FIG. 3.--LATERAL VIEW OF ELEVATOR.    FIG. 4.--FRONT VIEW OF ELEVATOR.    FIG. 5.--CONTINUOUS FURNACE FOR REVIVIFYING BONE-BLACK.]    The elevator is set in motion by the simple maneuver of the gearing  lever, P, and when this has been done all the other motions are effected  automatically.    _The Animal Black Furnace_.--This consists of a masonry casing of  rectangular form, in which are arranged on each side of the same  fire-place two rows of cast-iron retorts, D, of undulating form, each  composed of three parts, set one within the other. These retorts, which  serve for the revivification of the black, are incased in superposed  blocks of refractory clay, P, Q, S, designed to regularize the  transmission of heat and to prevent burning. These pieces are kept in  their respective places by crosspieces, R. The space between the retorts  occupied by the fire-place, Y, is covered with a cylindrical dome, O, of  refractory tiles, forming a fire-chamber with the inner surface of the  blocks, P, Q, and S. The front of the surface consists of a cast-iron  plate, containing the doors to the fire-place and ash pan, and a larger  one to allow of entrance to the interior to make repairs.    One of the principal disadvantages of furnaces for revivifying animal  charcoal has been that they possessed no automatic drier for drying the  black on its exit from the washer. It was for the purpose of remedying  this that Mr. Schreiber was led to invent the automatic system of drying  shown at the upper part of the furnace, and which is formed of two  pipes, B, of undulating form, like the retorts, with openings throughout  their length for the escape of steam. Between these pipes there is a  closed space into which enters the waste heat and products of combustion  from the furnace. These latter afterward escape through the chimney at  the upper part.    In order that the black may be put in bags on issuing from the furnace,  it must be cooled as much as possible. For this purpose there are  arranged on each side of the furnace two pieces of cast iron tubes, F,  of rectangular section, forming a prolongation of the retorts and making  with them an angle of about 45 degrees. The extremities of these tubes  terminate in hollow rotary cylinders, G, which permit of regulating the  flow of the black into a car, J (Fig. 1), running on rails.    From what precedes, it will be readily understood how a furnace is run  on this plan.    The bone-black in the hopper, A, descends into the drier, B, enters the  retorts, D, and, after revivification, passes into the cooling pipes, F,  from whence it issues cold and ready to be bagged. A coke fire having  been built in the fire-place, Y, the flames spread throughout the fire  chamber, direct themselves toward the bottom, divide into two parts to  the right and left, and heat the back of the retorts in passing. Then  the two currents mount through the lateral flues, V, and unite so as to  form but one in the drier. Within the latter there are arranged plates  designed to break the current from the flames, and allow it to heat all  the inner parts of the pipes, while the apertures in the drier allow of  the escape of the steam.    By turning one of the cylinders, G, so as to present its aperture  opposite that of the cooler, it instantly fills up with black. At this  moment the whole column, from top to bottom, is set in motion. The  bone-black, in passing through the undulations, is thrown alternately to  the right and left until it finally reaches the coolers. This operation  is repeated as many times as the cylinder is filled during the descent  of one whole column, that is to say, about forty times.    With an apparatus of the dimensions here described, 120 hectoliters  of bone-black may be revivified in twenty four hours, with 360 to 400  kilogrammes of coke.--_Annales Industrielles_.           *       *       *       *       *    [Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 330, page 5264.]          SOAP AND ITS MANUFACTURE, FROM A CONSUMER'S POINT OF VIEW.      In our last article, under the above heading, the advantages to be  gained by the use of potash soap as compared with soda soap were pointed  out, and the reasons of this superiority, especially in the case of  washing wool or woolen fabrics, were pretty fully gone into. It was also  further explained why the potash soaps generally sold to the public were  unfit for general use, owing to their not being neutral--that is to say,  containing a considerable excess of free or unsaponified alkali, which  acts injuriously on the fiber of any textile material, and causes sore  hands if used for household or laundry purposes. It was shown that the  cause of this defect was owing to the old-fashioned method of making  potash or soft soap, by boiling with wood ashes or other impure form of  potash; but that a perfectly pure and neutral potash soap could readily  be made with pure caustic potash, which within the last few years has  become a commercial article, manufactured on a large scale; just in  the same manner as the powdered 98 per cent. caustic soda, which was  recommended in our previous articles on making hard soap without  boiling.    The process of making pure neutral potash soap is very simple, and  almost identical with that for making hard soap with pure powdered  caustic soda. The following directions, if carefully and exactly  followed, will produce a first-class potash soap, suitable either for  the woolen manufacturer for washing his wool, and the cloth afterward  made from it, or for household and laundry purposes, for which uses it  will be found far superior to any soda soap, no matter how pure or well  made it may be.    Dissolve twenty pounds of pure caustic potash in two gallons of water.  Pure caustic potash is very soluble, and dissolves almost immediately,  heating the water. Let the lye thus made cool until warm to the  hand--say about 90 F. Melt eighty pounds of tallow or grease, which must  be free from salt, and let it cool until fairly hot to the hand--say  130 F.; or eighty pounds of any vegetable or animal oil may be taken  instead. Now pour the caustic potash lye into the melted tallow or oil,  stirring with a flat"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8564"],[0,"Life and Travels of Mungo Park (#10)"],[1,"about an hour at a small adjoining village to pay  customs to an officer of the King of Woolli; we rested the ensuing night  at a village called Tabajang; and at noon the next day, (December 5th,)  we reached Medina, the capital of the King of Woolli's dominions.    The kingdom of Woolli is bounded by Walli on the west, by the Gambia on  the south, by the small river Walli on the north-west, by Bondou on the  north-east, and on the east by the Simbani wilderness.    The country every where rises into gentle acclivities, which are  generally covered with extensive woods, and the towns are situated in the  intermediate valleys. Each town is surrounded by a tract of cultivated  land, the produce of which, I presume, is found sufficient to supply the  wants of the inhabitants; for the soil appeared to me to be every where  fertile, except near the tops of the ridges, where the red iron stone and  stunted shrubs sufficiently marked the boundaries between fertility and  barrenness. The chief productions are cotton, tobacco, and esculent  vegetables; all which are raised in the valleys, the rising grounds being  appropriated to different sorts of corn.    The inhabitants are Mandingoes; and, like most of the Mandingo nations,  are divided into two great sects, the Mahomedans, who are called  _Bushreens_, and the Pagans, who are called indiscriminately _Kafirs_,  (unbelievers,) and _Sonakies_, (_i. e._ men who drink strong liquors.)  The Pagan natives are by far the most numerous, and the government of the  country is in their hands; for though the most respectable among the  Bushreens are frequently consulted in affairs of importance, yet they are  never permitted to take any share in the executive government, which  rests solely in the hands of the _Mansa_, or sovereign, and great  officers of the state. Of these, the first in point of rank is the  presumptive heir of the crown, who is called the _Farbanna_; next to him  are the _Alkaids_, or provincial governors, who are more frequently  called _Keamos_. Then follow the two grand divisions of freemen and  slaves:[3] of the former, the Slatees, so frequently mentioned in the  preceding pages, are considered as the principal; but in all classes  great respect is paid to the authority of aged men. On the death of the  reigning monarch, his eldest son (if he has attained the age of manhood)  succeeds to the regal authority. If there is no son, or if the son is  under the age of discretion, a meeting of the great men is held, and the  late monarch's nearest relation (commonly his brother) is called to the  government, not as regent, or guardian to the infant son, but in full  right, and to the exclusion of the minor. The charges of the government  are defrayed by occasional tributes from the people, and by duties on  goods transported across the country. Travellers, on going from the  Gambia towards the interior, pay customs in European merchandize. On  returning they pay in iron and _shea-toulou_: these taxes are paid at  every town.      [3] The term which signifies a man of free condition is _Horia_; that      of a slave, _Jong_.    Medina,[4] the capital of the kingdom, at which I was now arrived, is a  place of considerable extent; and may contain from eight hundred to one  thousand houses. It is fortified in the common African manner, by a  surrounding high wall built of clay, and an outward fence of pointed  stakes and prickly bushes; but the walls are neglected, and the outward  fence has suffered considerably from the active hands of busy housewives,  who pluck up the stakes for firewood. I obtained a lodging at one of the  king's near relations, who apprized me, that at my introduction to the  king, I must not presume _to shake hands with him_. It was not usual, he  said, to allow this liberty to strangers. Thus instructed, I went in the  afternoon to pay my respects to the sovereign; and ask permission to pass  through his territories to Bondou. The king's name was _Jatta_. He was  the same venerable old man of whom so favourable an account was  transmitted by Major Houghton. I found him seated upon a mat before the  door of his hut: a number of men and women were arranged on each side,  who were singing and clapping their hands. I saluted him respectfully,  and informed him of the purport of my visit. The king graciously replied,  that he not only gave me leave to pass through his country, but would  offer up his prayers for my safety. On this, one of my attendants,  seemingly in return for the king's condescension, began to sing, or  rather to roar, an Arabic song; at every pause of which, the king  himself, and all the people present, struck their hands against their  forehead, and exclaimed, with devout and affecting solemnity, _Amen!  Amen!_[5] The king told me furthermore, that I should have a guide the  day following, who would conduct me safely to the frontier of his  kingdom. I then took my leave, and in the evening sent the king an order  upon Dr. Laidley for three gallons of rum, and received in return great  store of provisions.      [4] Medina in the Arabic signifies a city. The name is not uncommon      among the Negroes, and has probably been burrowed from the      Mohamedans.      [5] It may seem from hence that the king was a Mahomedan; but I was      assured to the contrary. He joined in prayer on this occasion      probably from the mere dictates of his benevolent mind, considering      perhaps that prayers to the Almighty, offered up with true devotion      and sincerity, were equally acceptable, whether from Bushreen or      Pagan.    December 6th, early in the morning, I went to the king a second time, to  learn if the guide was ready. I found his majesty sitting upon a  bullock's hide, warming himself before a large fire; for the Africans are  sensible of the smallest variation in the temperature of the air, and  frequently complain of cold when a European is oppressed with heat. He  received me with a benevolent countenance, and tenderly entreated me to  desist from my purpose of travelling into the interior; telling me that  Major Houghton had been killed in his route, and that if I followed his  footsteps, I should probably meet with his fate. He said that I must not  judge of the people of the eastern country by those of Woolli: that the  latter were acquainted with white men, and respected them; whereas the  people of the east had never seen a white man, and would certainly  destroy me. I thanked the king for his affectionate solicitude, but told  him that I had considered the matter, and was determined, notwithstanding  all dangers, to proceed. The king shook his head, but desisted from  further persuasion; and told me the guide should be ready in the  afternoon.    About two o'clock, the guide appearing, I went and took my last farewell  of the good old king, and in three hours reached Konjour, a small  village, where we determined to rest for the night. Here I purchased a  fine sheep for some beads, and my Serawoolli attendants killed it with  all the ceremonies prescribed by their religion: part of it was dressed  for supper: after which a dispute arose between one of the Serawoolli  Negroes and Johnson, my interpreter, about the sheep's horns. The former  claimed the horns as his perquisite, for having acted the part of our  butcher, and Johnson contested the claim. I settled the matter by giving  a horn to each of them. This trifling incident is mentioned as  introductory to what follows; for it appeared on inquiry that these horns  were highly valued, as being easily convertible into portable sheaths, or  cases, for containing and keeping secure certain charms or amulets called  _saphies_, which the Negroes constantly wear about them. These saphies  are prayers, or rather sentences, from the Koran, which the Mahomedan  priests write on scraps of paper, and sell to the simple natives, who  consider them to possess very extraordinary virtues. Some of the Negroes  wear them to guard themselves against the bite of snakes or alligators;  and on this occasion the saphie is commonly enclosed in a snake's or  alligator's skin, and tied round the ancle. Others have recourse to them  in time of war, to protect their persons against hostile weapons; but the  common use to which these amulets are applied is to prevent or cure  bodily diseases; to preserve from hunger and thirst; and generally to  conciliate the favour of superior powers under all the circumstances and  occurrences of life.[6]      [6] I believe that similar charms or amulets, under the names of      _domini, grigri, fetich_ &c. &c. are common in all parts of Africa.    In this case it is impossible not to admire the wonderful contagion of  superstition; for, notwithstanding that the majority of the Negroes are  Pagans, and absolutely reject the doctrines of Mahomet. I did not meet  with a man, whether a Bushreen or Kafir, who was not fully persuaded of  the powerful efficacy of these amulets. The truth is, that all the  natives of this part of Africa consider the art of writing as bordering  on magic; and it is not in the doctrines of the prophet, but in the arts  of the magician, that their confidence is placed. It will hereafter be  seen that I was myself lucky enough, in circumstances of distress, to  turn the popular credulity in this respect to good account.    On the 7th I departed from Konjour, and slept at a village called Malla,  (or Mallaing;) and on the 8th about noon I arrived at Kolor, a  considerable town; near the entrance into which I observed, hanging upon  a tree, a sort of masquerade habit, made of the bark of trees, which I  was told on inquiry belonged to MUMBO JUMBO. This is a strange bugbear,  common to all the Mandingo towns, and much employed by the Pagan natives  in keeping their women in subjection; for as the Kafirs are not  restricted in the number of their wives, every one marries as many as he  can conveniently maintain; and as it"]]]
