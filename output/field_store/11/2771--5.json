Infection usually occurs within a day or two following  hatching. Chicks two or three weeks of age seldom develop the acute form of  the disease. Incubator chicks are the most susceptible to the disorder.    _The following symptoms occur_: The chicks present a droopy, sleepy  appearance; the eyes are closed, and the chicks huddle together and peep  much of the time; the whitish intestinal discharge is noticed adhering to  the fluff near the margins of the vent, and the young bird is very weak;  death may occur within the first few days. After the first two weeks the  disease becomes less acute. In the highly acute form the chicks die without  showing the usual train of symptoms.    It is very easy to differentiate between the infectious and the  non-infectious diarrhoea. In the latter, the percentage of chicks affected  is small and the disease responds to treatment more readily than does the  infectious form. The death-rate in the latter form is about eighty per  cent.    _The treatment_ of diarrhoea in chicks from any cause is preventive. This  consists in removing the cause. No person can successfully handle poultry  if he does not give the necessary attention to sanitation. Poultry houses,  runs, watering fountains and feeding places must be constantly cleaned and  disinfected. The degree of attention necessary depends on the surroundings,  the crowded condition of the poultry houses and runs, and the presence of  disease in the flock. If disease is present, we can not clean and disinfect  the quarters too often. The attendant can not overlook details in handling  the incubator or brooder and feeding the chicks and be uniformly  successful.    If the disease is known to be present in the flock, the incubators and  brooders should be thoroughly disinfected by fumigating them with  formaldehyde gas. If dirty, they should first be washed with a water  solution of a good disinfectant. For a period of from twenty-four to  forty-eight hours after hatching, the chicks should receive no feed. Dr.  Kaupp recommends as an intestinal antiseptic, sulfocarbolate thirty grains,  bichloride of mercury six grains, and citric acid three grains, dissolved  in one gallon of water. This solution should be kept in front of the chicks  all the time. A water solution of powdered copper sulfate (about one-half  teaspoonful dissolved in one gallon of water) may be used.

CHAPTER V    DISEASES OF THE LIVER      GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The liver is one of the most important glands of the  body, as well as the largest. Because of its physiological influence over  the functions of the kidneys, intestines, and body in general and the  varied functions that it possesses, it is frequently affected by functional  disorders.    All of the blood that comes directly from the intestine is received by the  liver. It secretes the bile, neutralizes many of the poisonous substances  and end products of digestion that are taken up by the absorbing vessels of  the intestine, and acts as a storehouse for the glycogen.    It can be readily understood from this brief statement of the nature of the  liver functions, that any functional disorder of the liver may be far  reaching in its effect. In many of the diseases that involve other organs,  the liver may be primarily affected. It is difficult to diagnose functional  disorders of the liver that are responsible for a diseased condition of  some other body organ. A knowledge of the physiology and pathology of the  liver is of the greatest importance in the diagnosis of this class of  disorders.    In the larger domestic animals, symptoms of liver diseases are more obscure  than in the small animals. In certain parasitic diseases and in mixed and  specific infectious diseases, the liver may show marked pathological  changes.    COMMON CAUSES OF LIVER DISORDERS.--Domestic animals commonly live under  very unnatural conditions. Ill results do not follow unless these  conditions are so extreme as to violate practically all of the health laws.  Pampered animals are especially prone to liver disorders. The feeding of  too heavy and too concentrated a ration together with insufficient exercise  is one of the most common causes of disorders of the liver. The feeding of  a ration that is unsuitable for that particular species is a common source  of disease in animals. For example, the feeding to carnivora of a ration  made up largely of starchy feed, and the feeding of a ration containing an  excessive quantity of protein to herbivorous animals may result in  intestinal, liver and nervous disorders. Spoiled feed may prove highly  injurious. Catarrhal inflammation of the intestine and intestinal parasites  may obstruct the bile duct, and interfere seriously with the functions of  the liver.    _Symptoms_.--In diseases of the liver the appetite is irregular or the  animal refuses to eat, is constipated, or has diarrhoea. The faeces may be  grayish colored or foul smelling. Colicky pains are sometimes manifested.  Usually the animal acts dull and weak. A raise in body temperature may be  noted. The visible mucous membranes may appear yellowish- or brownish-red in  color.    _Treatment_.--Animals grazing over well drained pastures that are free from  injurious weeds and provided with plenty of drinking water, seldom develop  diseases of the liver. Exercise, a natural diet and plenty of clean water,  as well as preventing liver disorders, may be classed among the most  important of all curative agents. Laxatives or cathartics, such as oils,  salts, aloes, and calomel, in small doses may be given. We prefer the  administration of oil or aloes to horses, Glauber's or Epsom salts to  ruminants, and calomel to dogs. The administration of minimum doses of  these drugs, and repeating the dose after a short interval, is preferable  to large doses. Alkaline tonics are also indicated. The following mixture  may be given: bicarbonate of soda, sulfate of soda and common salt, eight  ounces of each, and powdered gentian and sulfate of iron, four ounces of  each. Large animals may be given a small tablespoonful of this mixture with  the feed three times a day. The dose for sheep and hogs is one teaspoonful.  A very light, easily digested ration should be fed.      QUESTIONS    1. What can be said of the importance of the liver?    2. Tell something of its duties as a gland.    3. In what animals are liver troubles most conspicuous when present?    4. Give causes of liver disorders.    5. What are the symptoms?    6. What are the most important natural cures?    7. What rule may be given for adapting suitable laxatives to different     classes of animals?          CHAPTER VI    DISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS      GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The urinary apparatus is composed of two glands, the  kidneys and an excretory apparatus that carries the excretion of the  kidneys to the outside.    The kidneys are situated in the superior region of the abdominal cavity  (sublumbar) above the peritoneum, and to the right and left of the median  line. They are highly vascular glands, somewhat bean-shaped and of a deep  red color. These glands are capable of removing from the blood a fluid that  is essentially different in composition and which, if retained in the  blood, would be harmful or poisonous to the body tissues.    The kidney excretions are carried from the pelvis of the kidneys by the  right and left ureters. These canals terminate in the bladder, an  oval-shaped reservoir for the urine. This organ is situated in the  posterior portion of the abdominal cavity and at the entrance to the pelvic  cavity. Posteriorly, it forms a constricted portion or neck. It is here  that the urethra originates. This canal represents the last division of the  excretory apparatus. In the female, the urethra is short and terminates in  the vulva. In the male it is long and is supported by the penis.    The urine secreted by the kidneys is a body excretion, and consists of  water, organic matter and salts. The nitrogenous end-products, aromatic  compounds, coloring matter, and mucin form the organic matter. The  nitrogenous end-products and aromatic compounds are urea, uric and hippuric  acids, benzoic acid and ethereal sulfates of phenol and cresol. The salts  are sulfates, phosphates and chlorides of sodium, potassium, calcium and  magnesium. The organic and inorganic matter varies with the ration.    The quantity of urine secreted within a given time varies in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8508"],[0,"The Evolution of Man Scientifically Disproved in 50 Arguments (#10)"],[1,"and a personal active Creator. The theory of natural  selection allows no design, no intelligence, no interference, no  control, by the Creator.  He does not interfere even by means of  law. M. M. Metcalf, of Oberlin, O., (shades of Chas. G. Finney!), a  prominent evolutionist, says, \"The last stand was made by those who  claim that supernatural agency intervenes in nature in such a way as  to modify the natural order of events. When Darwin came to dislodge  them from this, their last intrenchment, there was a fight.\" Yes! the  fight will last while any one tries to substitute chance for the  control of Almighty God.    The universe teems with countless evidences of intelligent design of  the highest order, whether it is found in the starry heavens, or in  the law and order of the atoms hiding from the most powerful  microscope. All things came by chance or by design. They say there is  no design.  We wonder that the hand that wrote the lie was not  palsied.  It would be, if the same Creator that filled every muscle,  nerve, bone, and tissue of the sacrilegious hand, with numberless  proofs of design, were not a long-suffering and merciful God.    Prof. Vernon Kellogg says: \"Darwinism may be defined as a certain  rational causo-mechanical (hence non-teleologic) explanation of the  origin of species.\" Translated into plain English, this euphemistic  expression means that Darwinism excludes all design and control by a  Creator. Chance pure and simple. All species originated by chance,  without interference by a supreme Being. This senseless doctrine of  chance has been condemned by man in every age.    We can only note a few of the evidences of design, found in  bewildering numbers in every part of God's great creation.    THE HUMAN BODY. Can evolutionists imagine how the human body  could be crammed fuller of the clearest proofs of the most intelligent  design, indicating a mind of the highest order? Many of the most  remarkable inventions of man were suggested by the wonderful  contrivances found in the human body. Yet they say this marvelous  piece of ingenuity did not come from the hand of the Creator but was  developed by blind chance or \"natural laws,\" without a trace of  intelligent design by the Creator, or by man or beast. The human body  can no more be a product of chance or causo-mechanical evolution than  a Hoe printing press, or Milton's Paradise Lost.    On high medical authority, we are told that there are in the human  body 600 muscles, 1000 miles of blood vessels, and 550 arteries  important enough to name. The skin, spread out, would cover 16 square  feet. It has 1,500,000 sweat glands which spread out on one surface,  would occupy over 10,000 sq. ft., and would cover 5 city lots, 20 x  100 ft. The lungs are composed of 700,000,000 cells of honey comb, all  of which we use in breathing,--equal to a flat surface of 2,000 square  feet, which would cover a city lot. In 70 years, the heart beats  2,500,000,000 times, and lifts 500,000 tons of blood. The nervous  system, controlled by the brain has 3,000,000,000,000 nerve cells,  9,200,000,000 of which are in the cortex or covering of the brain  alone. In the blood are 30,000,000 white corpuscles, and  180,000,000,000,000 red ones. Almost 3 pints of saliva are swallowed  every day, and the stomach generates daily from 5 to 10 quarts of  gastric juice, which digests food and destroys germs. Two gallons  daily! It is easy also to believe that the \"very hairs of our heads  are numbered,\"--about 250,000.    Yet many an upstart, with thousands of the most marvelous contrivances  in his own body, is ready to shout that there is no God and no design,  or that there has been no interference since creation, and that our  bodies have reached the dizzy heights of perfection, without  intelligence, purpose or design. Absurd in the highest degree!  \"We  are fearfully and wonderfully made.\"    THE EYE. Darwin says, \"To suppose that the eye with all its  inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different  distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the  correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been  formed by natural selection, _seems, I frankly confess absurd in the  highest degree_.\"  (Italics ours). After admitting that it \"seems  absurd in the highest degree,\" he proceeds, as if it were certainly  true. Darwin has been admired for his candor, but not for his  consistency. After admitting that an objection is insuperable, he goes  on as if it had little or no weight.  And many of his followers take  the same unscientific attitude.  They try to establish their theory in  spite of overwhelming arguments.    \"Reason tells me,\" he says, \"that if numerous gradations from a simple  and imperfect eye, to one complex and perfect, can be shown to exist,  such gradation being useful to its possessor, as is certainly the  case\" (certainly?), \"if further,\" he continues, \"the eye varies and  the variations be inherited, as is likewise certainly the case\" (most  modern evolutionists say certainly _not_ the case; what, if  variations are unfavorable?); \"And if such variations should be  useful, (what if not useful?) to any animal under changing conditions  of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex  eye _could_ be formed by natural selection, _though insuperable  to the imagination_ (Italics ours) should not be considered as  subversive of the theory\"!! Darwin undertakes a task far too great for  his mighty genius. \"Believing that a perfect and complex eye could be  formed\" is many moral leagues from proving that it was so formed. We  must have stronger proof than sufficient to lead us to believe that  such an eye could possibly be so formed. All proof is exhausted in the  struggle to prove the possibility of the formation of so marvelous an  eye, to say nothing of the probability, much less the certainty  required by science.  We hold evolutionists to the necessity of  proving that the eye was _certainly_ so formed. We demand  it. Otherwise, we shall certainly \"consider it subversive of the  theory.\"  And if acquired by one species, how could it benefit another  species? But we must contest the claim that the wonderful eye of man  and animals _could_ have been formed by evolution. Darwin's whole  theory aims to account for all creation, with its super-abundant  evidences of design, by natural selection, which works without design  and without intelligence. The theory is founded upon the monstrous  assumption that unintelligent animals and plants, can, by aimless  effort arrive at such perfection as the organs of the human body,  exceeding anything in mechanical contrivance, invented to date by the  genius of man. Indeed, that wonderful invention of the telescope is  but a poor imitation of the eye, and does not begin to equal it in  marvelous design. Who would say that the telescope might have been  constructed by chance, or the fortuitous concurrence of atoms, or by  natural selection, or any other attempted method of blotting out the  great intelligent Designer of the universe? It not only \"_seems_  absurd in the highest degree,\" but certainly _is_, and is fatal  to the theory.    The eye is so wonderful in its powers, and delicate adjustments, that  we stand amazed at the evidences of design, and at the wisdom of the  Maker of the eye, far exceeding the highest inventive genius of  man. To say that this is the result of \"natural selection,\" is absurd  and ridiculous.  Evolution eliminates design, mind, and an active and  ever present God, and substitutes blind chance or natural selection,  dubs it \"science\" and asks the world to believe it!    According to the evolution theory, the gain in the mechanism of the  eye causes its possessors to survive, and others to die. Is that true?  Are there not many species that survive, whose eyes are less perfect  than the eye of man? Indeed, it is claimed that many animals have eyes  superior to man. If so, why did man survive and become the dominant  species, with eyes less perfect? The compound eyes of some species are  superior in some respects, as every one knows, who has ever tried to  slip up on a fly. A scientist says that fleas have such perfect vision  that the darkness under the bed clothes is to them a glaring light.    Darwin makes a fatal admission, when he says, \"To arrive, however, at  a conclusion regarding the formation of the eye with all its marvelous  yet not absolutely perfect characters, it is indispensable that the  reason should conquer the imagination; But I _have felt the  difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at others hesitating to  extend the principle of natural selection to so startling a  length_.\"  (Italics ours). No wonder the reason and judgment of  mankind revolts against such a theory and that so many evolutionists  themselves reject it.    Three or four per cent. of the population are color blind--\"red-blind\"  --and are not able to distinguish the color of the green leaves from  that of the red ripe cherries.  Can it be possible that the eye  becomes more perfect, because those who had less perfect eyes  perished, and only those who could recognize colors survive until  color blindness is finally eliminated? Is such a doctrine scientific?  Is it more reasonable to believe it than to believe that an infinitely  wise and powerful God created this organ of marvelous value and  beauty? Of course, the ability to recognize color is only one of the  many perfections of the eye.    Evolution is made so much more incredible, because it teaches that  every permanent improvement in the eye is made at the expense of  multitudes of individuals that perished because of the lack of the  improvement. The defect perished only because all individuals  afflicted with it perished. Is this true?    The bureau of education of the U.S. government reports that, of  _22,000,000_ school children examined, 5,000,000 have defective  eyes; 1,000,0"]]]
