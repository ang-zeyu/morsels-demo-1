Dikaearchus says that Echemus and  Marathus, two Arcadians, took part in that war with the sons of  Tyndareus; and that from the first the place now called Akademeia was  then named Echedemia, and that from the second the township of Marathon  takes its names, because he in accordance with some oracle voluntarily  offered himself as a sacrifice there in the sight of the whole army.    However, the sons of Tyndareus came to Aphidnae, and took the place  after a battle, in which it is said that Alykus fell, the son of  Skeiron, who then was fighting on the side of the Dioskuri. In memory  of this man it is said that the place in the territory of Megara where  his remains lie is called Alykus. But Hereas writes that Alykus was  slain by Theseus at Aphidnae, and as evidence he quotes this verse about  Alykus,        \"Him whom Theseus slew in the spacious streets of Aphidnae,      Fighting for fair-haired Helen.\"    But it is not likely that if Theseus had been there, his mother and the  town of Aphidnae would have been taken.    XXXIII. After the fall of Aphidnae, the people of Athens became  terrified, and were persuaded by Mnestheus to admit the sons of  Tyndareus to the city, and to treat them as friends, because, he said,  they were only at war with Theseus, who had been the first to use  violence, and were the saviours and benefactors of the rest of mankind.  These words of his were confirmed by their behaviour, for, victorious as  they were, they yet demanded nothing except initiation into the  mysteries, as they were, no less than Herakles, connected with the city.  This was permitted them, and they were adopted by Aphidnus, as Herakles  had been by Pylius. They received divine honours, being addressed as  \"Anakes,\" either because of the cessation of the war, or from the care  they took, when they had such a large army within the walls of Athens,  that no one should be wronged; for those who take care of or guard  anything are said to do it \"anakos,\" and perhaps for this reason kings  are called \"Anaktes.\" Some say that they were called Anakas because of  the appearance of their stars in the heavens above, for the Attics  called \"above\" \"anekas.\"    XXXIV. It is said that Aethra, the mother of Theseus, was carried off as  a captive to Lacedaemon, and thence to Troy with Helen, and Homer  supports this view, when he says that there followed Helen,        \"Aithra the daughter of Pittheus and large-eyed Klymene.\"    Others reject this verse, and the legend about Mounychus, who is said to  have been the bastard son of Laodike, by Demophoon, and to have been  brought up in Troy by Aithra. But Istrus, in his thirteenth book of his  'History of Attica,' tells quite a different and peculiar story about  Aithra, that he had heard that Paris was conquered by Achilles and  Patroklus near the river Spercheius, in Thessaly, and that Hector took  the city of Troezen by storm, and amongst the plunder carried off  Aithra, who had been left there. But this seems impossible.    XXXV. Now Aidoneus the Molossian king chanced to be entertaining  Herakles, and related to him the story of Theseus and Peirithous, what  they had intended to do, and how they had been caught in the act and  punished. Herakles was much grieved at hearing how one had perished  ingloriously, and the other was like to perish. He thought that nothing  would be gained by reproaching the king for his conduct to Peirithous,  but he begged for the life of Theseus, and pointed out that the release  of his friend was a favour which he deserved. Aidoneus agreed, and  Theseus, when set free, returned to Athens, where he found that his  party was not yet overpowered. Whatever consecrated grounds had been set  apart for him by the city, he dedicated to Herakles, and called Heraklea  instead of Thesea, except four, according to Philochorus. But, as he at  once wished to preside and manage the state as before, he was met by  factious opposition, for he found that those who had been his enemies  before, had now learned not to fear him, while the common people had  become corrupted, and now required to be specially flattered instead of  doing their duty in silence.    He endeavoured to establish his government by force, but was overpowered  by faction; and at last, despairing of success, he secretly sent his  children to Euboea, to Elephenor, the son of Chalkodous; and he himself,  after solemnly uttering curses on the Athenians at Gargettus, where now  is the place called Araterion, or the place of curses, set sail for  Skyros, where he was, he imagined, on friendly terms with the  inhabitants, and possessed a paternal estate in the island. At that time  Lykomedes was king of Skyros; so he proceeded to demand from him his  lands, in order to live there, though some say that he asked him to  assist him against the Athenians. Lykomedes, either in fear of the great  reputation of Theseus, or else to gain the favour of Mnestheus, led him  up to the highest mountain top in the country, on the pretext of  showing him his estate from thence, and pushed him over a precipice.  Some say that he stumbled and fell of himself, as he was walking after  supper, according to his custom. As soon as he was dead, no one thought  any more of him, but Mnestheus reigned over the Athenians, while  Theseus's children were brought up as private citizens by Elephenor, and  followed him to Ilium. When Mnestheus died at Ilium, they returned home  and resumed their rightful sovereignty. In subsequent times, among many  other things which led the Athenians to honour Theseus as a hero or  demi-god, most remarkable was his appearance at the battle of Marathon,  where his spirit was seen by many, clad in armour, leading the charge  against the barbarians.    XXXVI. After the Persian war, in the archonship of Phaedo, the Athenians  were told by the Delphian Oracle to take home the bones of Theseus and  keep them with the greatest care and honour. There was great difficulty  in obtaining them and in discovering his tomb, on account of the wild  and savage habits of the natives of the island. However, Kimon took the  island, as is written in my history of his Life, and making it a point  of honour to discover his tomb, he chanced to behold an eagle pecking  with its beak and scratching with its talons at a small rising ground.  Here he dug, imagining that the spot had been pointed out by a miracle.  There was found the coffin of a man of great stature, and lying beside  it a brazen lance-head and a sword. These relics were brought to Athens  by Kimon, on board of his trireme, and the delighted Athenians received  them with splendid processions and sacrifices, just as if the hero  himself were come to the city. He is buried in the midst of the city,  near where the Gymnasium now stands, and his tomb is a place of  sanctuary for slaves, and all that are poor and oppressed, because  Theseus, during his life, was the champion and avenger of the poor, and  always kindly hearkened to their prayers. Their greatest sacrifice in  his honour takes place on the eighth of the month of Pyanepsion, upon  which day he and the youths came back from Crete. But besides this they  hold a service in his honour on the eighth of all the other months,  either because it was on the eighth day of Hekatombeion that he first  arrived in Athens from Troezen, as is related by Diodorus the  topographer, or else thinking that number to be especially his own,  because he is said to have been the son of Poseidon, and Poseidon is  honoured on the eighth day of every month. For the number eight is the  first cube of an even number, and is double the first square, and  therefore peculiarly represents the immovable abiding power of that god  whom we address as \"the steadfast,\" and the \"earth upholder.\"          LIFE OF ROMULUS.      Historians are not agreed upon the origin and meaning of the famous name  of Rome, which is so celebrated through all the world. Some relate that  the Pelasgi, after wandering over the greater part of the world, and  conquering most nations, settled there, and gave the city its name from  their own strength in battle.[A] Others tell us that after the capture  of Troy some fugitives obtained ships, were carried by the winds to the  Tyrrhenian or Tuscan coast, and cast anchor in the Tiber. There the  women, who had suffered much from the sea voyage, were advised by one  who was accounted chief among them for wisdom and noble birth, Roma by  name, to burn the ships. At first the men were angry at this, but  afterwards, being compelled to settle round about the Palatine Hill,  they fared better than they expected, as they found the country fertile  and the neighbours hospitable; so they paid great honour to Roma, and  called the city after her name. From this circumstance, they say, arose  the present habit of women kissing their male relatives and connections;  because those women, after they had burned the ships, thus embraced and  caressed the men, trying to pacify their rage.    [Footnote A: The Greek [Greek: rhome] = strength.]    II. Some say that Roma, who gave the name to the city, was the daughter  of Italus and Leucaria, or of Telephus the son of Hercules, and the wife  of Aeneas, while others say that she was the daughter of Ascanius the  son of Aeneas. Others relate that Romanus, the son of Odysseus and  Circe, founded the city, or that it was Romus, the son of Hemathion, who  was sent from Troy by Diomedes; or Romis the despot of the Latins, who  drove out of his kingdom the Tyrrhenians, who, starting from Thessaly,  had made their way to Lydia, and thence to Italy. And even those who  follow the most reasonable of these legends, and admit that it was  Romulus who founded the city after his own name, do not agree about his  birth; for some say that he was the son"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14056"],[0,"The French Impressionists (1860-1900) (#11)"],[1,"of the Seine which are quite wonderful in their power of conjuring up  these scenes, and over all this has roved his splendid vision of a  great, amorous and radiant colourist. The _Cathedrals_ are even more of  a _tour de force_ of his talent. They consist of seventeen studies of  Rouen Cathedral, the towers of which fill the whole of the picture,  leaving barely a little space, a little corner of the square, at the  foot of the enormous stone-shafts which mount to the very top of the  picture. Here he has no proper means to express the play of the  reflections, no changeful waters or foliage: the grey stone, worn by  time and blackened by centuries, is for seventeen times the monochrome,  the thankless theme upon which the painter is about to exercise his  vision. But Monet finds means of making the most dazzling atmospheric  harmonies sparkle upon this stone. Pale and rosy at sunrise, purple at  midday, glowing in the evening under the rays of the setting sun,  standing out from the crimson and gold, scarcely visible in the mist,  the colossal edifice impresses itself upon the eye, reconstructed with  its thousand details of architectural chiselling, drawn without  minuteness but with superb decision, and these pictures approach the  composite, bold and rich tone of Oriental carpets.    [Illustration: CLAUDE MONET    POPLARS ON THE EPTE IN AUTUMN]    Monet excels also in suggesting the _drawing of light_, if I may venture  to use this expression. He makes us understand the movement of the  vibrations of heat, the movement of the luminous waves; he also  understands how to paint the sensation of strong wind. \"Before one of  Manet's pictures,\" said Mme. Morisot, \"I always know which way to  incline my umbrella.\" Monet is also an incomparable painter of water.  Pond, river, or sea--he knows how to differentiate their colouring,  their consistency, and their currents, and he transfixes a moment of  their fleeting life. He is intuitive to an exceptional degree in the  intimate composition of matter, water, earth, stone or air, and this  intuition serves him in place of intellectuality in his art. He is a  painter _par excellence_, a man born for painting, and this power of  penetrating the secrets of matter and of light helps him to attain a  kind of grand, unconsciously lyrical poetry. He transposes the immediate  truth of our vision and elevates it to decorative grandeur. If Manet is  the realist-romanticist of Impressionism, if Degas is its psychologist,  Claude Monet is its lyrical pantheist.    His work is immense. He produces with astonishing rapidity, and he has  yet another characteristic of the great painters: that of having put his  hand to every kind of subject. His recent studies of the Thames are, at  the decline of his energetic maturity, as beautiful and as spontaneous  as the _Hay-ricks_ of seventeen years back. They are thrillingly  truthful visions of fairy mists, where showers of silver and gold  sparkle through rosy vapours; and at the same time Monet combines in  this series the dream-landscapes of Turner with Monticelli's  accumulation of precious stones. Thus interpreted by this intense  faculty of synthesis, nature, simplified in detail and contemplated in  its grand lines, becomes truly a living dream.    Since the _Hay-ricks_ one can say that the work of Claude Monet is  glorious. It has been made sacred to the admiring love of the  connoisseurs on the day when Monet joined Rodin in an exhibition which  is famous in the annals of modern art. Yet no official distinction has  intervened to recognise one of the greatest painters of the nineteenth  century. The influence of Monet has been enormous all over Europe and  America. The _process of colour spots_[1] (let us adhere to this  rudimentary name which has become current) has been adopted by a whole  crowd of painters. I shall have to say a few words about it at the end  of this book. But it is befitting to terminate this all too short study  by explaining that the most lyrical of the Impressionists has also been  the theorist _par excellence_. His work connects easel painting with  mural painting. No Minister of Fine Arts has been found, who would  surmount the systematic opposition of the official painters, and give  Manet a commission for grand mural compositions, for which his method is  admirably suited. It has taken long years before such works were  entrusted to Besnard, who, with Puvis de Chavannes, has given Paris  her most beautiful modern decorations, but Besnard's work is the direct  outcome of Claude Monet's harmonies. The principle of the division of  tones and of the study of complementary colours has been full of  revelations, and one of the most fruitful theories. It has probably been  the principle which will designate most clearly the originality of the  painting of the future. To have invented it, is enough to secure  permanent glory for a man. And without wishing to put again the question  of the antagonism of realism and idealism, one may well say that a  painter who invents a method and shows such power, is highly  intellectual and gifted with a pictorial intelligence. Whatever the  subjects he treats, he creates an aesthetic emotion equivalent, if not  similar, to those engendered by the most complex symbolism. In his  ardent love of nature Monet has found his greatness; he suggests the  secrets by stating the evident facts. That is the law common to all the  arts.    [Footnote 1: _Procede de la tache._]    [Illustration: CLAUDE MONET    THE BRIDGE AT ARGENTEUIL]          VI    AUGUSTE RENOIR AND HIS WORK      The work of Auguste Renoir extends without interruption over a period of  forty years. It appears to sum up the ideas and methods of Impressionist  art so completely that, should it alone be saved from a general  destruction, it would suffice to bear witness to this entire art  movement. It has unfolded itself from 1865 to our days with a happy  magnificence, and it allows us to distinguish several periods, in the  technique at least, since the variety of its subjects is infinite. Like  Manet, and like all truly great and powerful painters, M. Renoir has  treated almost everything, nudes, portraits, subject pictures, seascapes  and still-life, all with equal beauty.    His first manner shows him to be a very direct descendant of Boucher.  His female nudes are altogether in eighteenth century taste and he uses  the same technique as Boucher: fat and sleek paint of soft brilliancy,  laid on with the palette knife, with precise strokes round the principal  values; pink and ivory tints relieved by strong blues similar to those  of enamels; the light distributed everywhere and almost excluding the  opposition of the shadows; and, finally, vivacious attitudes and an  effort towards decorative convention. Nevertheless, his _Bathers_, of  which he has painted a large series, are in many ways thoroughly modern  and personal. Renoir's nude is neither that of Monet, nor of Degas,  whose main concern was truth, the last-named even trying to define in  the undressed being such psychologic observations as are generally  looked for in the features of the clothed being. Nor is Renoir's nude  that of the academicians, that poetised nude arranged according to a  pseudo-Greek ideal, which has nothing in common with contemporary women.  What Renoir sees in the nude is less the line, than the brilliancy of  the epidermis, the luminous, nacreous substance of the flesh: it is the  \"ideal clay\"; and in this he shows the vision of a poet; he transfigures  reality, but in a very different sense from that of the School.  Renoir's woman comes from a primitive dream-land; she is an artless,  wild creature, blooming in perfumed scrub. He sets her in backgrounds of  foliage or of blue, foam-fringed torrents. She is a luxuriant, firm,  healthy and naive woman with a powerful body, a small head, her eyes  wide open, thoughtless, brilliant and ignorant, her lips blood-red and  her nostrils dilated; she is a gentle being, like the women of Tahiti,  born in a tropical clime where vice is as unknown as shame, and where  entire ingenuousness is a guarantee against all indecency. One cannot  but be astonished at this mixture of \"Japanism,\" savagism and eighteenth  century taste, which constitutes inimitably the nude of Renoir.    [Illustration: RENOIR    DEJEUNER]    [Illustration: RENOIR    IN THE BOX]    M. Renoir's second manner is more directly related to the Impressionist  methods: it is that of his landscapes, his flowers and his portraits.  Here one can feel his relationship with Manet and with Claude Monet.  These pictures are hatchings of colours accumulated to render less the  objects than their transparency across the atmosphere. The portraits are  frankly presented and broadly executed. The artist occupies himself in  the first place with getting correct values and an exact suggestion of  depth. He understands the illogicality of a false perfection which is as  interested in a trinket as in an eye, and he knows how to proportion the  interest of the picture which should guide the beholder's look to the  essential point, though every part should be correctly executed. He  knows how to interpret nature in a certain sense; how to stop in time;  how to suggest by leaving a part apparently unfinished; how to indicate,  behind a figure, the sea or some landscape with just a few broad touches  which suffice to suggest it without usurping the principal part. It is  now, that Renoir paints his greatest works, the _Dejeuner des  Canotiers_, the _Bal au Moulin de la Galette_, the _Box_, the _Terrace_,  the _First Step_, the _Sleeping Woman with a Cat_, and his most  beautiful landscapes; but his nature is too capricious to be satisfied  with a single technique. There are some landscapes that are reminiscent  of Corot or of Anton Mauve; the _Woman with the broken neck_ is related  to Manet; the portrait of _Sisley_ invents pointillism"]]]
