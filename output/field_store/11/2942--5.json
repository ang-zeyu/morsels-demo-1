The countenance of Pitt was turned with      interest on the young lawyer, who seemed not only to share      that horror of revolutionary movements with which he was      himself so strongly imbued, but who had so gallantly acted      upon it. 'What was your motive, young gentleman,' he inquired,      'for thus entering the shop?' 'I, Sir,' answered young Ward,      'am not long returned from France, and have there seen in      practice what sounds so fine in theory.'\"    Though, according to report, Pitt was not the man to overlook rising  talent or lose sight of a useful adherent, eight years elapsed before  much came of this singular introduction; during which the young  barrister published two books or pamphlets on the Laws of Nations,  married a sister of Lady Mulgrave, and was slowly working his way  at the bar. In 1802, Pitt, in a stiff enough letter, offered Mr.  Ward a seat for Cockermouth, one of the Lowther boroughs; and when  he returned to power, his protege became Under-Secretary of State  for the Foreign Department, (his brother-in-law, Lord Mulgrave,  being Principal Secretary,) _after_ he had published a pamphlet  in justification of Pitt's highhanded seizure of the Spanish  treasure-ships. Of course he went out on the accession of All the  Talents after Pitt's death; and came in again on their expulsion,  as a Lord of the Admiralty, still under Lord Mulgrave. In 1812, he  was moved to the Ordnance, as \"Clerk.\" In 1823, he quitted office,  withdrew from Parliament, and began novel-writing as an amusement, at  fifty-eight. He died in 1846, in his eighty-second year; having lived  long enough to see his son, the present Lord High Commissioner of the  Ionian Islands, Secretary to the Admiralty under a Whig Ministry. He  was thrice married, and each time advantageously. His first wife, as  we have seen, was a sister-in-law of Lord Mulgrave; the second, whom  he wedded at the age of sixty-three, was the widow of Mr. Plumer  of Gilston Park, which became his through the marriage; his third  alliance, when he was nearly seventy, gave him the advantage of a  jointure of 1,000l. per annum allowance as guardian, and a couple of  mansions. His writings would lead to the notion that Robert Ward was  everything tender and amiable; and so he might be as long as he was  pleased; but he would seem to have had a quiet implacability, that was  offended on slight grounds, and obdurate in displeasure. He quarreled  with his son on account of his politics: he received some slight from  an official friend and repulsed all attempts at explanation, till a  letter written when Ward was seventy-two and his correspondent turned  of seventy produced a reconciliation rather dry on his part. It would  have been satisfactory to know that some relenting, some interest  beyond a \"suspicion\" of the writer, had been shown on the receipt  of the following manly letter, written after the publication of  _De Vere_. After alluding to the internal traits by which he had  identified the author, the anonymous correspondent continues:        \"It surprises me, I confess, that the feeling, judgment, and      sagacity, which sufficed to produce the work that I have been      commending, should have suffered the golden opinions of me,      which you entertained, to be filched and adulterated by mere      traducers, whose reports the hearer's own experience could      have almost refuted, and whose testimony was so obviously      liable to be warped by prejudice.        \"We live in a strange world. Before my feelings and      dispositions had changed from wavering and transient to      permanent and fixed,--before the desultory ramblings, which      almost became our age, had terminated in a path, and that,      I trust, a right and honorable one, and from which, with      moderate allowance for human inferiority, I have not deviated      since,--before my principles had attained their vigor, and      generated those correct habits which it was their province      to produce,--in short, while, like most young men, I might      be said to have as yet 'no character at all,' I obtained your      friendship. How I lost it, I have already told you. When,      remains to tell you. I lost it when any fruits which my youth      may have promised had appeared; lost it all at once, under      circumstances scarcely more annoying to my feelings than      revolting to my sense of what was right and just.        \"I am not seeking to penetrate what is to me, indeed, no      secret; neither do I form the unavailing wish that our expired      intercourse should revive. C'en est fait. A knot which has      been loosened or untied may be formed again, but this knot has      been cut. Accordingly, I neither address you by your name nor      subscribe my own. My hand-writing, though not disguised, is,      like yourself, much changed; and, though this were not the      case, you could not, after the lapse of so much time, have      recognized it.        \"My regard you continue to possess, though I am not certain      of your title to retain it. But you have, by means of your      estrangement, sustained a loss. In ceasing to entertain a      feeling of esteem and cordiality toward me, you have lost that      which is a source of soothing gratification to the mind in      which it is cherished, and which, I flatter myself, I as well      deserved to have retained with regard to me as any other of      your early friends, be that other who he may. Again: though      you have not lost a friend, (for my sentiments toward you      continue friendly,) you have elected to lose the usual and      not unpalatable fruits of friendship in my case: and this at      a time of life (for we are much of the same age) when old      friends can the less be spared, because new friendships are      rarely formed.        \"When our earliest meetings and the commencements of a      bygone friendship are called up before me by the letter which,      I scarcely know why, I am writing, I feel myself softened      as well as depressed by the recollection; and, as I write      farewell, it gives me pain to think that I might add to it      the words--probably forever. God bless you.\"    There is nothing in Robert Ward's life or literary eminence to require  or even justify so large a space as his nephew has bestowed upon it.  Strictly speaking, indeed, the biography occupies but a small portion  of these bulky volumes, which are chiefly filled with remains or  correspondence; and much of that little is not distinguished for  matter or character. The correspondence is indifferent. The latter  portion of it is mainly devoted to literary criticism, or compliments,  having for subject the author's works or those of his praisers; and is  weak and flimsy to a degree. The earlier portion principally relates  to politics, especially to the intrigues carried on by Canning and  Malmesbury during the Addington Ministry to procure Pitt's premature  return to office. To this Lord Mulgrave was judiciously opposed; and  although there is nothing very new or particular in the account, and  the letters are rather flat, it gives the Mulgrave version of the  business. The most valuable part of the book, and which was, indeed,  well worthy of separate publication, is a diary that Mr. Ward kept  through a considerable portion of his official life, beginning in  June 1809, and continuing with a short interruption till the death  of Perceval, when it ceased till 1819; after which it was maintained  to a later period than Mr. Phipps thinks it proper to publish it.  This diary consists of gossip, anecdote, on dits, and confidential  communications made to Mr. Ward on various occasions and at critical  times, together with his own observations and reflections on affairs,  or remarks on characters. As he was much in the confidence of  Perceval, saw a good deal of the Duke of Wellington, (Master-General  of the Ordnance during the era of the Manchester massacre and  Sidmouth's spy doings,) and was continually behind the scenes, the  diary is both curious and amusing. Allowance must of course be made  for the writer's position as a partisan, and some of his later  notions are those of the \"laudator temporis acti,\" speaking without  responsibility; but it is sufficiently interesting to raise a desire  for the whole, published as a diary, and not mixed up with other  matters to which it has small relation.    The diary begins with Canning's intrigue against Castlereagh; and  Canning is occasionally brought forward in the earlier period,  and painted with a good deal of shadow, (he was then in a sort of  opposition to Perceval,) and altogether a very different personage  from the Wentworth of _De Vere_. Lord Palmerston, then a \"very fine  young man,\" and a promising candidate for place, with no other faults,  in Mr. Ward's estimation, than what he has certainly got rid of long  since--nervousness and modesty!--also figures in the pages, and at a  critical conjuncture of his fortunes.        \"Lord Palmerston came to town, sent for by Perceval. He was      so good as to confide to me that three things were offered to      him,--the Chancellorship of the Exchequer, Secretaryship at      War, or a seat at the Treasury, by way of introduction to the      seals, if he was afraid of entering upon them at once. These      offers were, however, in the alternative of there being any      of them declined by Milnes (Member for Pomfret), to whom they      were made in the first instance. Lord P. consulted me very      frankly upon them, and asked if I thought he would be equal      to the seals either in Cabinet or Parliament, particularly the      latter, where he had barely made his debut. I told him, and      was most sincere, that in common with all his friends whom I      had ever heard speak on the subject, I thought him quite equal      to them in point of capacity, but as to nerves in Parliament,      (of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13056"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 10 (#11)"],[1,"the Poles,  especially after a disconsolate Jew had arrived, straight from Samter,  who told terrible stories about the lawless excesses of the Poles  against the Germans; he himself had been soundly beaten. * * *    Just for my sake do not alarm yourself if each mail does not bring you  a letter from me. There is not the slightest probability that a hair  of our heads will be touched, and my friends of all kinds overrun  me, to share their political wisdom with me, so that I began a letter  of one-quarter sheet to Malle this morning at 9, and could not finish  before 3. I am living in comfort and economy with Werdeck, only rather  far away, in consequence of which I already feel the pavement through  my soles. Cordial remembrances to the mother and the Bellins. I am  writing on the _table d'hote_ table of the Hotel des Princes, and a  small salad has just been brought for my supper.    Your very faithful B. April 3, '48.      Schoenhausen, August 21, '48. 8.30 P.M.    To HERR VON PUTTKAMER, AT REINFELD, NEAR ZUCKERS, POMERANIA.    _Dear Father_,--You have just become, with God's gracious help, the  grandfather of a healthy, well-formed girl that Johanna has presented  me with after hard but short pains. At the moment mother and child are  doing as well as one could wish. Johanna lies still and tired, yet  cheerful and composed, behind the curtain; the little creature, in the  meantime, under coverlets on the sofa, and squalls off and on. I am  quite glad that the first is a daughter, but if it had been a cat I  should have thanked God on my knees the moment Johanna was rid of it:  it is really a desperately hard business. I came from Berlin last  night, and this morning we had no premonition of what was to come. At  ten in the morning Johanna was seized with severe pains after eating a  grape, and the accompanying symptoms led me to put her at once to bed,  and to send in haste to Tangermuende, whence, in spite of the Elbe, Dr.  Fricke arrived soon after 12. At 8 my daughter was audible, with  sonorous voice. This afternoon I sent Hildebrand off to fetch nurse  Boldt from Berlin in a great hurry. I hope you will not postpone your  journey now; but earnestly beg dear mother not to make the trip in an  exhausting manner. I know, of course, that she has little regard for  her own health, but just for Johanna's sake you must take care of  yourself, dear mother, so that she may not be anxious on your account.  Fricke pleases us very much--experienced and careful. I do not admit  visits: Bellin's wife, the doctor, and I attend to everything. Fricke  estimates the little one at about nine pounds in weight. Up to the  present time, then, everything has gone according to rule, and for  that praise and thanks be to the Lord. If you could bring Aennchen  with you that would make Johanna very happy.    22. _Morning_.--It is all going very well, only the cradle is still  lacking, and the little miss must camp meanwhile on a forage-crib. May  God have you and us in his keeping, dear parents.    Until we meet again, presently. B.    Have the kindness to attend to the announcements, save in Berlin and  Reddentin, in your neighborhood: Seehof, Satz, and so forth. Johanna  sends cordial greetings. She laments her daughter's large nose. I  think it no larger than it has a right to be.    Berlin, Saturday, 11 p. m. September 23, '48.      To FRAU VON BISMARCK, SCHOeNHAUSEN, NEAR JERICHOW.    _My Pet!_--Today at last I have news of your condition, and am very  grateful to mother for the letter. * * * I am beginning to be really  homesick for you, my heart, and mother's letter today threw me into a  mood utterly sad and crippling: a husband's heart, and a father's--at  any rate, mine in the present circumstances--does not fit in with the  whirl of politics and intrigue. On Monday, probably, the die will be  cast here. Either the ministry will be shown to be weak, like its  predecessors, and sink out--and against this I shall still  struggle--or it will do its duty, and then I do not for a moment doubt  that blood will flow on Monday evening or on Tuesday. I should not  have believed that the democrats would be confident enough to take up  the gage of battle, but all their behavior indicates that they are  bent on it. Poles, Frankfort men, loafers, volunteers--all sorts of  riffraff are again at hand. They count on the defection of the troops,  apparently misled by the talk of individual discontented gabblers  among the soldiers; but I think they will make a great mistake. I  personally have no occasion to await the thing here, and so to tempt  God by asking him to protect me in perils that I have no call to seek.  Accordingly, I shall betake my person to a place of safety not later  than tomorrow. If nothing important occurs on Monday, on Tuesday I  shall reach you; but, if the trouble begins, I should still like to  stay near the King. But there you may (in an aside I say  \"unfortunately\") assume with confidence that there will be no danger.  You received no letter from me today, because I sent a report about  the society to Gaertner, and you will learn from him that I am all  right. You will receive this tomorrow, and I shall write again on  Monday. Send horses for me on Tuesday. God bless and guard you, my  sweetheart.    Your faithful B.      (Postmark, Berlin, November 9, '48.)    _My Dearest_,--Although I am confident that I shall be with you in  person a few hours after this letter, I want to inform you immediately  that everything is quiet till now. I go to Potsdam at nine, but must  post the letter here now, as otherwise it will not reach you today.  Our friends have been steadfast till now, but I cannot take courage  yet to believe in anything energetic. I still fear, fear, and the  weather is unfavorable, too. Above all, you must not be afraid of  anything, if I should stay away today by any chance. The K. may send  for me, or some one else in Potsdam earnestly wish that I should stay  there to advise upon further measures, the trains may be delayed  because the carriages are required for soldiers, and other things of  the sort. Then, courage and patience, my heart, in any event. The God  who makes worlds go round can also cover me with his wings. And in P.  there is no danger anyhow. So expect me in the evening; if I happen  not to come, I shall be all right nevertheless. Cordial remembrances  to our cross little mother.    Your most faithful B.      Potsdam, November 10, '48.    _My Angel_,--Please, please do not scold me for not coming today  either; I must try to put through some more matters in relation to the  immediate future. At two this afternoon all Wrangel's troops will  reach Berlin, disarm the flying corps, maybe, take the disaffected  deputies from the _Concertsaal,_ and make the city again a royal  Prussian one. It is doubtful whether they will come to blows in the  process. Contrary to our expectations, everything remained quiet  yesterday; the democrats seem to be much discouraged. * * *    Your v.B.      Potsdam, November 14, '48.    _My Dear Pet_,--Long sleep can certainly become a vice. Senfft has  just waked me at nine o'clock, and I cannot yet get the sand out of my  eyes. It is quiet here. Yesterday it was said to be the intention to  serenade the Queen (on her birthday) with mock music; one company  posted there sufficed to make the audacious people withdraw in  silence. Berlin is in a state of siege, but as yet not a shot fired.  The disarming of the city militia goes on forcibly and very gradually.  The meeting in the Schuetzenhaus was dispersed by soldiers yesterday;  six men who were unwilling to go were thrown out. Martial law will be  proclaimed over there today. My friend Schramm has been arrested. That  Rob. Blum, Froebel, Messenhauser, have been shot in Vienna, you already  know from the newspapers. Good-by, you angel; I must close. Many  remembrances to all. The peasants of the neighborhood have declared to  the King that if he has need of them he should just call them: that  they would come with weapons and supplies to aid his troops, from the  Zauch-Belzig-Teltow, the Havelland, and other districts. Mention that  in Schoenhausen, please, so that it may go the rounds.    Your v.B.      Potsdam, Thursday Morning, November 16, '48.    _Dear Nanne!_--I did not get your very dear, nice letter of Tuesday  morning until yesterday afternoon, but none the less did I right  fervently rejoice and take comfort in it, because you are well, at  least in your way, and are fond of me. There is no news from here  except that Potsdam and Berlin are as quiet as under the former King,  and the surrender of arms in B. continues without interruption, with  searching of houses, etc. It is possible that there may be scenes of  violence incidentally--the troops secretly long for them--but on the  whole the \"passive resistance\" of the democrats seems to me only a  seasonable expression for what is usually called fear. Yesterday I  dined with the King. The Queen was amiable in the English fashion. The  enclosed twig of erica I picked from her sewing-table, and send it to  keep you from being jealous. * * *    If a letter from the Stettin bank has arrived, send it to me  immediately, please, marked, \"To be delivered promptly.\" If I do not  receive it before day after tomorrow, I shall return home, but must  then go to Stettin at the beginning of next week. So let horses be  sent for me on Saturday afternoon; this evening I unfortunately cannot  go to Genthin, because I expect Manteuffel here. * * *    The democrats are working all their schemes in order to represent the  opinion of the \"people\" as hostile to the King; hundreds of feigned  signatures. Please ask the town-councillor whether there are not some  sensible people in Magdeburg, who care more for their neck, with quiet  and good order, than for this outcry of street politicians, and who  will send the King a counter-address from Magdeburg.
