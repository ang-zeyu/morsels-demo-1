He said he died with less reluctance because his ruin involved  nobody but himself, he leaving no children behind him, and his wife  being young enough to get a living honestly.          BARBARA SPENCER, Coiner, etc.      Before we proceed to mention the particulars that have come to our hands  concerning this unhappy criminal, it may not be amiss to take notice of  the rigour with which all civilised nations have treated offenders in  this kind, by considering the crime itself as a species of treason. The  reason of which arises thus. As money is the universal standard or  measure of the value of any commodity, so the value of money is always  regulated, in respect of its weight, fineness, etc., by the public  authority of the State. To counterfeit, therefore, is in some degree to  assume the supreme authority, inasmuch as it is giving a currency to  another less valuable piece of metal than that made current by the  State. The old laws of England were very severe on this head, and  carried their care of preventing it so far as to damage the public in  other respects, as by forbidding the importation of bullion, and  punishing with death attempts made to discover the Philosopher's Stone  which forced whimsical persons who were enamoured of that experiment to  go abroad and spend their money in pursuit of that project there. These  causes, therefore, upon a review of the laws on this head, were  abrogated; but the edge in other respects was rather sharpened than  abated. For as the trade of the nation increased, frauds in the coin  became of worse consequence and not only so, but were more practised.    In the reign of King William and Queen Mary, clipping and coining grew  so notorious and had so great and fatal influences on the public trade  of the nation, that Parliament found it necessary to enter upon that  great work of a recoinage[5] and in order to prevent all future  inconveniences of a like nature, they at the same time enacted that not  only counterfeiting, chipping, scaling, lightening, or otherwise  debasing the current specie of this realm, should be deemed and punished  as high treason, but they included also under the same charge and  punishment the having any press, engine, tool, or implement proper for  coining, the mending, buying, selling, etc., of them; and upon this Act,  which was rendered perpetual by another made in the seventh year of the  reign of Queen Anne, all our proceedings on this head are at this day  grounded. Many executions and many more trials happened on these laws  being first made, dipping, especially, being an ordinary thing, and some  persons of tolerable reputation in the world engaged in it; but the  strict proceedings (in the days of King William, especially) against  all, without distinction, who offended in that way, so effectually  crushed them that a coiner nowadays is looked upon as an extraordinary  criminal, though the Law still continues to take its course, whenever  they are convicted, the Crown being seldom or never induced to grant a  pardon.    As to this poor woman, Barbara Spencer, she was the daughter of mean  parents and was left very young to the care of her mother, who lived in  the parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate. This old creature, as is common  enough with ordinary people, indulged her daughter so much in all her  humours, and suffered her to take so uncontrolled a liberty that all her  life-time after, she was incapable of bearing restraint, but, on every  slight contradiction flew out into the wildest excesses of passion and  fury. When but a child, on a very slight difference at home, she must  needs go out 'prentice, and was accordingly put to a mantua-maker, who  having known her throughout her infancy, fatally treated her with the  same indulgence and tenderness. She continued with her about two years,  and then, on a few warm words happening, went away from so good a  mistress, and came home again to her mother, who by that time had set up  a brandy shop.    On Miss Barbara's return, a maid had to be taken, for she was much too  good to do the work of the house. The servant had not been there long  before they quarrelled, the mother taking the wench's part. Away went  the young woman, but matters being made up and the old mother keeping an  alehouse in Cripplegate parish, she once more went to live with her.  This reconciliation lasted longer, but was more fatal to Barbara than  her late falling out.    One day, it seems, she took into her head to go and see the prisoners  die at Tyburn, but her mother meeting her at the door, told her that  there was too much business for her to do at home, and that she should  not go. Harsh words ensuing on this, her mother at last struck her, and  said she should be her death. However, Barbara went, and the man who  attended her to Tyburn, brought her afterwards to a house by St. Giles's  Pound[6] where after relating the difference between herself and her  mother, she vowed she would never return any more home. In this  resolution she was encouraged, and soon after was acquainted with the  secrets of the house, and appointed to go out with their false money, in  order to vend, or utter it; which trade, as it freed her from all  restraint, she was at first mightily pleased with. But being soon  discovered she was committed to Newgate, convicted and fined.    About this time she first became acquainted with Mrs. Miles, who  afterwards betrayed her, and upon this occasion was, it seems, so kind  as to advance some money for her. On the affair for which she died, the  evidence could have hardly done without Miles's assistance, which so  enraged poor Barbara that even to the instant of death, she could hardly  prevail with herself to forgive her, and never spoke of her without a  kind of heat, very improper and unbecoming in a person in her  distressful state.    The punishment ordained by our laws for treasons committed by women,  whether high or petty, is burning alive.[7] This, though pronounced upon  her by the judge, she could never be brought to believe would be  executed, but while she lay under sentence, she endeavoured to put off  the thoughts of the fatal day as much as she could, always asserting  that she thought the crime no sin, for which she was condemned. It seems  her mother died at Tyburn before midsummer, and this poor wretch would  often say that she little thought she should so soon follow her, when  she attended her to death, averring also that she suffered unjustly. As  for this poor woman, her temper was exceedingly unhappy, and as it had  made her uneasy and miserable all her life, so at her death it  occasioned her to be impatient, and to behave inconsistently. For which,  sometimes, she would apologise, by saying that though it was not in her  power to put on grave looks, yet her heart was as truly affected as  theirs who gave greater outward signs of contrition; a manner of  speaking usually taken up by those who would be thought to think  seriously in the midst of outward gaiety, and of whose sincerity in  cases like these. He only can judge who is acquainted with the secrets  of all hearts and who, as He is not to be deceived, so His penetration  is utterly unknown to us, who are confined to appearances and the  exterior marks of things.    She lost all her boldness at the near approach of death and seemed  excessively surprised and concerned at the apprehension of the flames.  When she went out to die, she owned her crime more fully than she had  ever done. She said she had learnt to coin of a man and woman who had  now left off and lived very honestly, wherefore she said she would not  discover them. At the very slake she complained how hard she found it to  forgive Miles, who had been her accomplice and then betrayed her, adding  that though she saw faggots and brushes ready to be lighted and to  consume her, yet she would not receive life at the expense of another's  blood. She averred there were great numbers of London who followed the  same trade of coining, and earnestly wished they might take warning by  her death. At the instant of suffering, she appeared to have reassumed  all her resolution, for which she had, indeed, sufficient occasion, when  to the lamentable death by burning was added the usual noise and clamour  of the mob, who also threw stones and dirt, which beat her down and  wounded her. However, she forgave them cheerfully, prayed with much  earnestness and ended her life the same day as the last mentioned  malefactor, Perkins, aged about twenty-four years.    FOOTNOTES:        [5] A commission was appointed to consider the debased state of          the currency and, not without considerable opposition, a bill          was passed in 1696, withdrawing all debased coin from          circulation. This incurred an expense of some L1,200,000, which          the Government met by imposing a window tax.        [6] This was at the corner of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford          Street. It was an old London landmark, from which distances were          measured as from the Standard in Cornhill. It was demolished in          1765.        [7] In practice, criminals were strangled before being burned.          The last case in which this penalty was inflicted was in 1789;          it was abolished the following year.          WALTER KENNEDY, a Pirate      Piracy was anciently in this kingdom considered as a petty treason at  Common Law; but the multitude of treasons, or to speak more properly of  offences construed into treason, becoming a very great grievance to the  subject, this with many others was left out in the famous Statute of the  25th Edward the Third, for limiting what thenceforth should be deemed  treason. From that time piracy was regarded in England only as a crime  against the Civil Law, by which it was always capital; but there being  some circumstances very troublesome, as to the proofs therein"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13102"],[0,"The Decameron, Volume II (#11)"],[1,"to the King, who  kept her at Cuba, he was sore troubled, insomuch that he now scarce  ventured to hope that he should ever set eyes on her, not to speak of  having her for his own, again. But still, holden by Love, and seeing that  none there knew him, he sent the felucca away, and tarried there, and  frequently passing by Cuba, he chanced one day to catch sight of her at a  window, and was seen of her, to their great mutual satisfaction. And  Gianni, taking note that the place was lonely, made up to her, and had  such speech of her as he might, and being taught by her after what  fashion he must proceed, if he would have further speech of her, he  departed, but not till he had made himself thoroughly acquainted with the  configuration of the place; and having waited until night was come and  indeed far spent, he returned thither, and though the ascent was such  that 'twould scarce have afforded lodgment to a woodpecker, won his way  up and entered the garden, where, finding a pole, he set it against the  window which the damsel had pointed out as hers, and thereby swarmed up  easily enough.    The damsel had aforetime shewn herself somewhat distant towards him,  being careful of her honour, but now deeming it already lost, she had  bethought her that there was none to whom she might more worthily give  herself than to him; and reckoning upon inducing him to carry her off,  she had made up her mind to gratify his every desire; and to that end had  left the window open that his ingress might be unimpeded. So, finding it  open, Gianni softly entered, lay down beside the damsel, who was awake,  and before they went further, opened to him all her mind, beseeching him  most earnestly to take her thence, and carry her off. Gianni replied that  there was nought that would give him so much pleasure, and that without  fail, upon leaving her, he would make all needful arrangements for  bringing her away when he next came. Whereupon with exceeding great  delight they embraced one another, and plucked that boon than which Love  has no greater to bestow; and having so done divers times, they  unwittingly fell asleep in one another's arms.    Now towards daybreak the King, who had been greatly charmed with the  damsel at first sight, happened to call her to mind, and feeling himself  fit, resolved, notwithstanding the hour, to go lie with her a while; and  so, attended by a few of his servants, he hied him privily to Cuba.  Having entered the house, he passed (the door being softly opened) into  the room in which he knew the damsel slept. A great blazing torch was  borne before him, and so, as he bent his glance on the bed, he espied the  damsel and Gianni lying asleep, naked and in one another's arms. Whereat  he was seized with a sudden and vehement passion of wrath, insomuch that,  albeit he said never a word, he could scarce refrain from slaying both of  them there and then with a dagger that he had with him. Then, bethinking  him that 'twere the depth of baseness in any man--not to say a king--to  slay two naked sleepers, he mastered himself, and determined to do them  to death in public and by fire. Wherefore, turning to a single companion  that he had with him, he said:--\"What thinkest thou of this base woman,  in whom I had placed my hope?\" And then he asked whether he knew the  gallant, that had presumed to enter his house to do him such outrage and  despite. Whereto the other replied that he minded not ever to have seen  him. Thereupon the King hied him out of the room in a rage, and bade take  the two lovers, naked as they were, and bind them, and, as soon as 'twas  broad day, bring them to Palermo, and bind them back to back to a stake  in the piazza, there to remain until tierce, that all might see them,  after which they were to be burned, as they had deserved. And having so  ordered, he went back to Palermo, and shut himself up in his room, very  wroth.    No sooner was he gone than there came unto the two lovers folk not a few,  who, having awakened them, did forthwith ruthlessly take and bind them:  whereat, how they did grieve and tremble for their lives, and weep and  bitterly bewail their fate, may readily be understood.    Pursuant to the King's commandment they were brought to Palermo, and  bound to a stake in the piazza; and before their eyes faggots and fire  were made ready to burn them at the hour appointed by the King. Great was  the concourse of the folk of Palermo, both men and women, that came to  see the two lovers, the men all agog to feast their eyes on the damsel,  whom they lauded for shapeliness and loveliness, and no less did the  women commend the gallant, whom in like manner they crowded to see, for  the same qualities. Meanwhile the two hapless lovers, both exceeding  shamefast, stood with bent heads bitterly bewailing their evil fortune,  and momently expecting their death by the cruel fire. So they awaited the  time appointed by the King; but their offence being bruited abroad, the  tidings reached the ears of Ruggieri dell' Oria, a man of peerless worth,  and at that time the King's admiral, who, being likewise minded to see  them, came to the place where they were bound, and after gazing on the  damsel and finding her very fair, turned to look at the gallant, whom  with little trouble he recognized, and drawing nearer to him, he asked  him if he were Gianni di Procida. Gianni raised his head, and recognizing  the admiral, made answer:--\"My lord, he, of whom you speak, I was; but I  am now as good as no more.\" The admiral then asked him what it was that  had brought him to such a pass. Whereupon:--\"Love and the King's wrath,\"  quoth Gianni. The admiral induced him to be more explicit, and having  learned from him exactly how it had come about, was turning away, when  Gianni called him back, saying:--\"Oh! my lord, if so it may be, procure  me one favour of him by whose behest I thus stand here.\" \"What favour?\"  demanded Ruggieri. \"I see,\" returned Gianni, \"that die I must, and that  right soon. I crave, then, as a favour, that, whereas this damsel and I,  that have loved one another more dearly than life, are here set back to  back, we may be set face to face, that I may have the consolation of  gazing on her face as I depart.\" Ruggieri laughed as he replied:--\"With  all my heart. I will so order it that thou shalt see enough of her to  tire of her.\" He then left him and charged the executioners to do nothing  more without further order of the King; and being assured of their  obedience, he hied him forthwith to the King, to whom, albeit he found  him in a wrathful mood, he spared not to speak his mind, saying:--\"Sire,  wherein have they wronged thee, those two young folk, whom thou hast  ordered to be burned down there in the piazza?\" The King told him.  Whereupon Ruggieri continued:--\"Their offence does indeed merit such  punishment, but not at thy hands, and if misdeeds should not go  unpunished, services should not go unrewarded; nay, may warrant  indulgence and mercy. Knowest thou who they are whom thou wouldst have  burned?\" The King signified that he did not. Whereupon Ruggieri:--\"But  I,\" quoth he, \"am minded that thou shouldst know them, to the end that  thou mayst know with what discretion thou surrenderest thyself to a  transport of rage. The young man is the son of Landolfo di Procida,  brother of Messer Gianni di Procida, to whom thou owest it that thou art  lord and king of this island. The damsel is a daughter of Marin Bolgaro,  whose might alone to-day prevents Ischia from throwing off thy yoke.  Moreover, these young folk have long been lovers, and 'tis for that the  might of Love constrained them, and not that they would do despite to thy  lordship, that they have committed this offence, if indeed 'tis meet to  call that an offence which young folk do for Love's sake. Wherefore,  then, wouldst thou do them to death, when thou shouldst rather do them  all cheer, and honour them with lordly gifts?\" The King gave ear to  Ruggieri's words, and being satisfied that he spoke sooth, repented him,  not only of his evil purpose, but of what he had already done, and  forthwith gave order to loose the two young folk from the stake, and  bring them before him; and so 'twas done. And having fully apprised  himself of their case, he saw fit to make them amends of the wrong he had  done them with honours and largess. Wherefore he caused them to be  splendidly arrayed, and being assured that they were both minded to wed,  he himself gave Gianni his bride, and loading them with rich presents,  sent them well content back to Ischia, where they were welcomed with all  festal cheer, and lived long time thereafter to their mutual solace and  delight.      NOVEL VII.    --  Teodoro, being enamoured of Violante, daughter of Messer Amerigo, his  lord, gets her with child, and is sentenced to the gallows; but while he  is being scourged thither, he is recognized by his father, and being set  at large, takes Violante to wife.  --    While they doubted whether the two lovers would be burned, the ladies  were all fear and suspense; but when they heard of their deliverance,  they all with one accord put on a cheerful countenance, praising God. The  story ended, the queen ordained that the next should be told by Lauretta,  who blithely thus began:--    Fairest ladies, what time good King Guglielmo ruled Sicily there dwelt on  the island a gentleman, Messer Amerigo Abate da Trapani by name, who was  well provided, as with other temporal goods, so also with children. For  which cause being in need of servants, he took occasion of the appearance  in Trapani waters of certain Genoese corsairs from the Levant, who,  scouring the coast of Armenia, had captured not a few boys, to purchase  of them some of these youngsters, supposing them to be Turks; among whom,  albeit most shewed as mere shepherd boys, there was one, Teodoro, by  name, whose less rustic mien seemed to betoken gentle blood.
