I'd have Rad do it, but he's out of the game.\"    \"Poor old Rad!\" murmured Ned. \"Do you think he'll ever get better, Tom?\"    \"I don't know,\" sighed the young inventor. \"All I can do is to hope. He  is very patient, and Koku is devoted to him. All their little  bickerings and squabbles seem to have been forgotten.\"    Tom called some of his workmen, some of them to start the blaze of  inflammable material in the pit, while one climbed up to the top of the  tower of scantlings and made his way out on the extended arm, where  there was a little platform for him to stand until it was time to drop  the chemicals.    \"Light her up!\" cried Tom Swift, and a match was thrown in among the  oiled wood. In an instant a fierce blaze shot up, as hot, in  proportion, as would come from any burning building.    For the second time Tom was about to make a test on a fairly large  scale of his experimental extinguisher mixture.    \"All ready up there?\" he called to his helper perched high in the air.    \"All ready!\" came back the answer above the roar and crackle of the  flames that made Tom and Ned step back.    Would success or failure attend the young inventor's project?          CHAPTER XI    THE BLAZING TREE      Tom Swift hesitated a moment before giving the final word that would  send the metal container of powerful chemicals down into the midst of  the crackling flames. He wanted to make sure, in his own mind, that he  had done everything possible to insure the success of his undertaking.  The young inventor never attempted the solution of any problem without  going into it with his whole energy. So he wanted this experiment to  succeed.    He quickly reviewed, mentally, the composition of the chemical  compound. He had made it as strong as possible, and he had spared no  pains to insure a hot fire, so that the test would not be too simple.    \"What's the matter, Tom?\" asked Ned, as his chum appeared to hesitate  about giving the word that would send the chemicals hurtling down into  the fire.    \"Nothing. I was just making sure I hadn't forgotten anything,\" Tom  answered. \"I guess I haven't.\"    He paused a moment, looked up at his assistant on the overhanging arm  of the tower, glanced down at the flames, now at their height, and then  suddenly cried:    \"Let her go!\"    \"Right!\" came back the man's voice, and then a dark object, like a  bomb, was seen descending from the skeleton framework above the flames.    There was a scattering of the fire in the pit as the extinguisher bomb  fell among the blazing embers. Then followed a slight explosion when  the bomb broke, as it was intended it should.    Tom and Ned leaned forward to peer through the pall of smoke which  swirled this way and that. Here was to come the real test of the  device. Would the fumes of the liberated chemicals choke the fire, or  would it burn on in spite of them? That was the question to be settled  for Tom Swift.    Almost immediately he had his answer. For after a fierce burst of the  tongues of fire following the fall of the bomb, there was a distinct  dying down of the conflagration in the pit. Great clouds of smoke  arose, but the fire was quenched in a great measure, and as the  fire-blanketing gas continued to be generated from the chemicals  liberated from the bomb, there was a further dying down of the  crackling fire.    \"Tom, you've struck it!\" yelled Ned in delight. \"You have the right  combination this time!\"    Tom did not answer. He leaned forward and looked eagerly down into the  pit. He was about to join with Ned in agreeing that he had, indeed,  solved the problem, when, to his surprise, the flames started up again.    \"What's this?\" asked the young financial manager. \"Are you going to  have a second test, Tom?\"    \"Not that I know of,\" was the puzzled answer. \"I don't exactly  understand this myself, Ned. By all calculations this fire ought to  have died a natural death, but now it is breaking out again. I think  what must have happened is that a quantity of the oil they poured on  collected in a pool and didn't get all the effects of the chemicals  from the bomb. Then the oil started to blaze.\"    \"What can you do about it?\" Ned wanted to know.    \"Oh, I've got another bomb up there,\" and Tom pointed to his helper who  was still perched on the overhanging arm. \"I was prepared for some such  emergency as this. Drop the other one!\" Tom yelled, and again a dark  object fell, bursting in the pit and again liberating the gas that was  supposed to choke any fire.    The flames that had started up for the second time instantly died down,  and Ned, leaning over the edge of the pit, cried:    \"Hurray, Tom! That does the business!\" But the young inventor shook his  head. \"I'm not quite satisfied,\" he remarked. \"It didn't work quickly  enough. What I want is a chemical combination that will choke the fire  off first shot.\"    \"Well, you pretty nearly have it,\" observed Ned.    \"Yes. But 'good enough' isn't what I want,\" Tom said. \"I've got to work  on that chemical compound again. I think I know where I can improve it.\"    \"Well, if I were a fire, and I had this happen to me,\" remarked Ned,  laughing and pointing to the heap of blackened embers in the pit, \"I  should feel very much discouraged.\"    \"But not enough,\" declared Tom. \"I want the fire to be out more quickly  than this one was. I think I can improve that chemical compound, and  I'm going to do it.\"    \"All right! Come on down!\" he called to his helper, who was still  perched on the overhanging arm. \"We won't do any more today.\"    \"What is your next move?\" asked Ned, as Tom started for his small,  private laboratory.    \"Oh, I'm going to fiddle around among those sweet-smelling chemicals,\"  answered the young inventor.    \"Bless my vest buttons! then I'm not coming in, exclaimed a voice which  could proceed from none other than Mr. Damon. And he it proved to be.  He had driven over from Waterford in his automobile and had arrived  just as the fire test was concluded.    \"Oh, come on in!\" called Tom. \"You can visit with dad, and Eradicate  will be glad to see you.\"    \"Poor Rad! How is he?\" asked Mr. Damon, walking along with Tom and Ned.    \"No change,\" was the sad answer of the young inventor, for he felt  responsible for the mishap to the colored man. \"They can't operate on  his eyes yet.\"    \"And when they do will he be able to see?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"That is what we are all hoping,\" answered Tom with a sigh.  \"But do go  in to see him, Mr. Damon. It will cheer him up.\"    \"I will,\" promised the eccentric man. \"At any rate I'll not venture  near your perfume shop, Tom Swift!\"    \"And I don't see that I can be of any service,\" added Ned, \"so I'm off  to my work.\"    \"All right,\" assented Tom. \"I've got several new schemes to try. Some  of them ought to work.\"    Tom Swift was very busy for the next few days--so busy, in fact, that  even Mary saw little of him. He was closeted with Mr. Baxter more than  once, and that individual seemed to lose some of his bitter feelings  over the loss of his formulae as he found he could be of service to the  young inventor. For he was of service in suggesting new ways of  combining fire-fighting chemicals, gained by his association with the  fireworks concern.    \"And that's about all the benefit I derived from being with those  scoundrels, Field and Melling,\" said Mr. Baxter gloomily.    \"You still think they took your dye formulae?\" asked Tom.    \"I'm positive of it, but I can't prove anything. They threatened to get  the best of me when I would not sell them, for a ridiculously low sum,  an interest in the secrets. And I believe they did get the best of me  during that fire.\"    \"I believe the same!\" exclaimed Tom.    \"How is that? What do you know? Can you help me prove anything against  them?\" eagerly asked the chemist.    \"Well, I don't know,\" answered Tom slowly. \"I'll tell you what I heard.\"    Thereupon he related the conversation he had overheard while with Mary  at the wayside inn. The eyes of Josephus Baxter gleamed as he listened  to this recital.    \"So that was their game!\" he cried, as he smote the table with his  fist, thereby nearly upsetting a test tube of acid, which Tom caught  just in time. \"I knew something crooked was going on, and they thought  I'd be so badly overcome in the fire that I wouldn't know, or wouldn't  remember, what happened.\"    \"What did happen?\" asked Tom. \"All I know is that you were overcome in  the laboratory room.\"    \"It's too long a story to tell in detail now,\" said Mr. Baxter.  \"But  the main facts are that through misrepresentations I was induced to  associate myself with Field and Melling. They had a good factory for  the making of fireworks, and some of the chemicals used in that  industry also enter into the manufacture of the kind of dyes I have in  mind to make. So I associated myself with them, they agreeing to let me  use their laboratory.    \"One night they came to see me as I was working there over my formulae.  They pretended to have discovered something in an expired patent that  nullified what I had. I did not believe this to be so, and I brought  out my formulae to compare with theirs--or what they said they had. The  next thing I remember was that the fire broke out and my formulae  disappeared. Then I was overcome, and I did not care what happened to  me, for, having lost the valuable dye formulae, I did not think life  worth living.    \"Perhaps I was foolish,\" said Mr. Baxter, \"but I had tried so many  things and failed, and I counted so much on these formulae that it  seemed as if the bottom dropped out of everything when I lost them.\"    \"I know,\" said Tom sympathetically. \"I've been in the same boat myself.  But are you sure they took the papers which meant so much to you?\"    \"I don't see who else could,\" answered the chemist. \"The papers were in  a tin box on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13635"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War, Vol 1, No. 1 (#11)"],[1,"the authority of the House of  Commons, all diplomatic business being conducted in a blaze of  publicity, and the present regulation which exacts the qualification of  a private income of at least L400 a year for a position in the  Diplomatic Service replaced by a new regulation that at least half the  staff shall consist of persons who have never dined out at the houses of  hosts of higher rank than unfashionable solicitors or doctors.    In these recommendations I am not forgetting that an effective check on  diplomacy is not easy to devise, and that high personal character and  class disinterestedness (the latter at present unattainable) on the part  of our diplomatists will be as vital as ever. I well know that diplomacy  is carried on at present not only by official correspondence meant for  possible publication and subject to an inspection which is in some  degree a responsible inspection, but by private letters which the King  himself has no right to read. I know that even in the United States,  where treaties and declarations of war must be made by Parliament, it is  nevertheless possible for the President to bring about a situation in  which Congress, like our House of Commons in the present instance, has  no alternative but to declare war. But though complete security is  impracticable, it does not follow that no precautions should be taken,  or that a democratic tradition is no safer than a feudal tradition. A  far graver doubt is raised by the susceptibility of the masses to war  fever, and the appalling danger of a daily deluge of cheap newspapers  written by nameless men and women whose scandalously low payment is a  guarantee of their ignorance and their servility to the financial  department, controlled by a moneyed class which not only curries favour  with the military caste for social reasons, but has large direct  interests in war as a method of raising the price of money, the only  commodity the moneyed class has to sell. But I am quite unable to see  that our Junkers are less susceptible to the influence of the Press than  the people educated by public elementary schools. On the contrary, our  Democrats are more fool-proof than our Plutocrats; and the ravings our  Junkers send to the papers for nothing in war time would be dear at a  halfpenny a line. Plutocracy makes for war because it offers prizes to  Plutocrats: Socialism makes for peace because the interests it serves  are international. So, as the Socialist side is the democratic side, we  had better democratize our diplomacy if we desire peace.          II.    *RECRUITING.*      And now as to the question of recruiting. This is pressing, because it  is not enough for the Allies to win: we and not Russia must be the  decisive factor in the victory, or Germany will not be fairly beaten,  and we shall be only rescued _proteges_ of Russia instead of the  saviours of Western Europe. We must have the best army in Europe; and we  shall not get it under existing arrangements. We are passing out of the  first phase of the war fever, in which men flock to the colours by  instinct, by romantic desire for adventure, by the determination not, as  Wagner put it, \"to let their lives be governed by fear of the end,\" by  simple destitution through unemployment, by rancour and pugnacity  excited by the inventions of the Press, by a sense of duty inculcated in  platform orations which would not stand half an hour's discussion, by  the incitements and taunts of elderly non-combatants and maidens with a  taste for mischief, and by the verses of poets jumping at the cheapest  chance in their underpaid profession. The difficulty begins when all the  men susceptible to these inducements are enlisted, and we have to draw  on the solid, sceptical, sensible residuum who know the value of their  lives and services and liberties, and will not give them except on  substantial and honourable conditions. These Ironsides know that it is  one thing to fight for your country, and quite another to let your wife  and children starve to save our rich idlers from a rise in the supertax.  They also know that it is one thing to wipe out the Prussian drill  sergeant and snob officer as the enemies of manhood and honour, and  another to let that sacred mission be made an excuse for subjecting us  to exactly the same tyranny in England. They have not forgotten the \"On  the knee\" episode, nor the floggings in our military prisons, nor the  scandalous imprisonment of Tom Mann, nor the warnings as to military law  and barrack life contained even in Robert Blatchford's testimony that  the army made a man of him.      *What the Labour Party Owes to the Army.*    And here is where the Labour Party should come in. The Labour Party's  business is to abolish the Militarist soldier, who is only a quaint  survival of the King's footman (himself a still quainter survival of the  medieval baron's retainer), and substitute for him a trained combatant  with full civil rights, receiving the Trade Union rate of wages proper  to a skilled worker at a dangerous trade. It must co-operate with the  Trade Unions in fixing this moral minimum wage for the citizen soldier,  and in obtaining for him a guarantee that the wage shall continue until  he obtains civil employment on standard terms at the conclusion of the  war. It must make impossible the scandal of a monstrously rich peer (his  riches, the automatic result of ground land-landlordism, having \"no  damned nonsense of merit about them\") proclaiming the official weekly  allowance for the child of the British soldier in the trenches. That  allowance is eighteenpence, being less than one third of the standard  allowance for an illegitimate child under an affiliation order. And the  Labour Party must deprive the German bullet of its present double effect  in killing an Englishman in France and simultaneously reducing his  widow's subsistence from a guinea a week to five shillings. Until this  is done we are simply provoking Providence to destroy us.    I wish I could say that it is hardly necessary to add that Trade  Unionism must be instituted in the Army, so that there shall be  accredited secretaries in the field to act as a competent medium of  communication between the men on service and the political  representatives of their class at the War Office (for I shall propose  this representative innovation presently). It will shock our colonels;  but I know of no bodies of men for whom repeated and violent shocking is  more needed and more likely to prove salutary than the regimental masses  of the British army. One rather pleasant shock in store for them is the  discovery that an officer and a gentleman, whose sole professional  interest is the honour and welfare of his country, and who is bound to  the mystical equality of life-and-death duty for all alike, will get on  much more easily with a Trade Union secretary than a commercial employer  whose aim is simply private profit and who regards every penny added to  the wages of his employees as a penny taken off his own income. Howbeit,  whether the colonels like it or not--that is, whether they have become  accustomed to it or not--it has to come, and its protection from Junker  prejudice is another duty of the Labour Party. The Party as a purely  political body must demand that the defender of his country shall retain  his full civil rights unimpaired; that, the unnecessary, mischievous,  dishonourable and tyrannical slave code called military law, which at  its most savagely stern point produced only Wellington's complaint that  \"it is impossible to get a command obeyed in the British Army,\" be  carted away to the rubbish heap of exploded superstitions; and that if  Englishmen are not to be allowed to serve their country in the field as  freely as they do in the numerous civil industries in which neglect and  indiscipline are as dangerous as they are in war, their leaders and  Parliamentary representatives will not recommend them to serve at all.  In wartime these things may not matter: discipline either goes by the  board or keeps itself under the pressure of the enemy's cannon; and  bullying sergeants and insolent officers have something else to do than  to provoke men they dislike into striking them and then reporting them  for two years' hard labour without trial by jury. In battle such  officers are between two fires. But soldiers are not always, or even  often, at war; and the dishonour of abdicating dearly-bought rights and  liberties is a stain both on war and peace. Now is the time to get rid  of that stain. If any officer cannot command men without it, as  civilians and police inspectors do, that officer has mistaken his  profession and had better come home.      *Obsolete Tests in the Army.*    Another matter needs to be dealt with at the same time. There are  immense numbers of atheists in this country; and though most of them,  like the Kaiser, regard themselves as devout Christians, the best are  intellectually honest enough to object to profess beliefs they do not  hold, especially in the solemn act of dedicating themselves to death in  the service of their country. Army form E 501 A (September, 1912)  secured to these the    [Illustration: JOHN GALSWORTHY. (_Photo by E.O. Hoppe_.) _See Page_  102]    [Illustration: RUDYARD KIPLING _(Photo by E.O. Hoppe_.) _See Page_ 106]    benefit of the Bradlaugh Affirmation Act of 1888, as the enlisting  soldier said simply \"I, So and So, do make Oath, &c.\" But recruits are  now confronted with another form (E 501, June, 1914) running \"I, So and  So, swear by Almighty God, &c.\" On September 1st, at Lord Kitchener's  call, a civil servant obtained leave to enlist and had the oath put to  him, in this form by the attesting officer. He offered to swear in the  1912 form. This was refused; and we accordingly lost a recruit of just  that sturdily conscientious temper which has made the most formidable  soldiers known to history.
