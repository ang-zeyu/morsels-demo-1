Of the many  islands--whose number amounts to about 3,000--we could admire the beauties  of but few; for most of them dot the Canadian coast line.    As the wind increased rapidly, it was deemed advisable to take harbor at  _False Presqu'ile_, where we arrived at 9 A.M. Although this small body of  land appeared very insignificant, inhabited by only twelve families, we  decided to remain there, until wind and waves would prove more favorable.    We had no motive to regret that resolution; for we experienced that this  solitary tract not only afforded us enchanting views of lovely scenery; it  was also the abode of noble-hearted mortals. Immediately after our arrival  a very amiable gentleman, introducing himself as Mr. W.A. French, a  wealthy lumber merchant of this place, visited us on board; giving us a  cordial welcome. Not satisfied with a kind reception, he and his pretty  wife presented us with all sorts of provisions, indigenous to this  locality; thus evincing the abundant supply of delicacies at their  disposal, notwithstanding their residing in such solitude.    The time passed with marvelous rapidity in the pleasant company of our new  friends. When the gloom of the growing twilight reminded us of the fading  day, we could hardly realize this fact. We wished to stay there another  day; but when the following morning rose fair and beautiful in the clear  heavens, the wind had changed to the southeast, which was disadvantageous  for our mooring place; and it might have been dangerous for us to remain  in that harbor, should the breeze become violent.    Leaving False Presqu'ile, we pursued our voyage under the most favorable  auspices.    After a course of several hours, we reached _Cheboygan_, a town situated  on the northern shore of the Michigan Peninsula, thirteen miles from the  Straits of Mackinaw. Lumber trade is carried on especially in this place,  which contains about 7,500 inhabitants.    Resuming our trip the next forenoon, a short course brought us to the  terminus of our voyage on Lake Huron; when reaching the _Straits of  Mackinaw_, whose blue green waves divide the State of Michigan.    Extending nearly nine miles in circumference, and rising at its highest  point over 300 feet above the waves, we beheld the famous _Mackinaw  Island_, which has filled an important place in the history of  exploration. Here was the meeting place of the daring French _voyageurs_  and _aventuriers_, before the pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock. Many wild  and thrilling incidents in the lives of Marquette, Hennepin, and La Salle  occurred on this island; and over at Point St. Ignace, in plain view,  Marquette was escorted to his burial place by a hundred canoes of plumed  and painted Ottawa and Huron warriors in 1677.    Just across, on the most northern point of the Lower Peninsula, stood old  Fort Mackinaw, the scene of the terrible massacre of the whites by the  Indians under Pontiac in 1763.    On this island were fought two battles in the war of 1812. It was here  that Schoolcraft wrote his celebrated History of the North American  Indians, and the Legend of Hiawatha, which Longfellow, visiting him here,  afterward expanded into a poem.    The island's varied scenery, and its history and traditions, have been  portrayed in vivid word pictures by Marion Harland in a book, bearing the  title \"With the Best Intentions,\" by which she has recently added to her  wide fame.    Having crossed the strait at its narrowest part four miles in width, we  caught sight of the beautiful waters of _Lake Michigan_, the only one in  the group of the North American great lakes which extends entirely within  the territory of the United States, having a maximum breadth of eighty  four miles, and a depth varying from 700 to 1,000 feet. Its length amounts  to 345 miles from the northwestern corner of Indiana and the northern part  of Illinois to the Straits of Mackinaw.    We followed the same route which more than two centuries ago was taken by  Jacques Marquette who, in the spring of 1673, with Joliet for his  chieftain, and five other Frenchmen, embarked at Mackinaw in two frail  bark canoes.    The disposition to pause for an instant, and to reflect upon the character  and circumstance of our luxurious voyage as contrasted with that of these  few adventurers in their fragile birch canoes--a little over 220 years  ago--is almost irresistible.    On that occasion it was a journey of extreme peril--with no friendly  populous havens at which the necessary commodities could be obtained.  Those densely wooded shores afforded no hospitable refuge to these hardy  men, and their destination or return was a question of great uncertainty.    We pushed along with the marvelous propeller and, surrounded with every  comfort, had the assurance of each evening anchoring in some safe  harbor--encountering cheerful voices, and seeing glad faces--with the  possibility of daily finding everything we wanted, in profusion. There  was the postoffice, with its rapid service at our disposal, or the  electric telegraph, by means of which we could communicate with every  part of civilization, ever within our reach--and the climax of modern  genius in the magnificent structures of the Columbian Exposition awaiting  us--the marvel of the nineteenth century, with its unparalleled  aggregation. The thought is overwhelming! And could these explorers have  seen in a dream--what we witnessed in reality--it would have seemed to  them an impossibility that so short a time could have brought about such  great events.    The eastern lake shore was richly garlanded with forests displaying a vast  multitude of verdant hues, varying through all the shades of green. Over  the whole the azure of the sky cast a deep, misty blue; blending toward  the rocks of lime- and sandstone, seemingly embracing every possible tint  and shade of color.    Having achieved a course of sixty miles, the yacht cast anchor in the  excellent harbor of St. James on _Beaver Island_, a large tract of land  covering an area of 3,700 acres. Vessels of various kinds and shapes lay  moored in this spacious inlet. Being wind-bound, we tarried for two days,  which gave us opportunity to become acquainted with the features of the  island. We were informed that it is identified with the history of  Mormonism; since it was first settled by adherents of that sect, who  robbed the ships entering this port, and who led the lives of pirates.  After their leader was killed in one of the numerous combats which ensued  with the attacked sailors, they abandoned the place; but the habitation of  the Mormon chief is still existing, probably the only vestige left here of  the followers of Joseph Smith.    At 1 o'clock A.M., on Wednesday, August 16th, we departed from Beaver  Island. The pilot had guided the \"Marguerite\" on a course of about  forty-five miles southward, when we approached _Northport_, Michigan, a  place noteworthy for having not a single of those maleficient institutions,  commonly styled beer-saloons.    We lingered two hours at the dock of this town. The white fields of  blinding mist floated along the winding valleys of the low lake shore; and  from the dark clouds curtaining the sun, the rain fell continuously. Thus  the landscape on our left bore a gray and dim tincture.    Before the darkness of evening had gathered about us, the yacht was made  fast to the dock of _Frankfort_, on the Michigan coast, a small place with  a population of about 1,000, romantically situated. Taking our departure  from the town on the following morning, we observed that the fog, covering  the surrounding landscape with a thick, impenetrable veil, increased in  density until it seemed as if from moment to moment additional tints of  sombre gray were united to the haze. In fact, after a while we were unable  to discern the outline of the coast, having to pursue our way with great  caution.    After the lapse of four anxious hours, we had the great satisfaction to  hear the welcome sound of the fog-horn of _Manistee_, the county seat of  Manistee County, in Michigan. It is situated at the mouth of the  same-named river, which is navigable for vessels, drawing ten to twelve  feet of water, for the distance of one and one-half miles to Manistee  Lake. Largely engaged in lumber trade, the city has a score of saw-mills  and about as many shingle-mills, the latter of which produce annually  450,000,000 shingles, the largest number made at any one place in the  world. In consequence of the discovery in 1881 of a bed of solid salt,  thirty feet thick, extensive salt factories are being built. The  population of the city has rapidly increased in later years, comprising  about 14,000 residents at present. The surrounding district is especially  adapted for fruit-growing; and sportsmen are attracted to the Manistee  River and its tributaries by the abundance of the otherwise rarely found  grayling.    Since we expected company on board the \"Marguerite\" in the evening--Mr.  Wilkinson, a citizen of Milwaukee, who intended to make us acquainted with  his wife, we went on shore immediately after dinner to view the city, so  as to return in time to meet our visitors.    Manistee made the impression of a flourishing business town. The  comparatively long trading thoroughfare is a broad street nicely laid out,  and adorned with numerous stately buildings and spacious stores.    Not long after our departure from Manistee, which occurred early on the  following morning, a sudden squall threatened us; and a few minutes later,  a terrific flash and peal broke almost simultaneously upon us, followed by  a violent shower. Fortunately, it lasted but a short time. The tempest  gradually ceased; the irregular and blinding flashes became fewer and the  thunder rolled less loudly."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9411"],[0,"Legends of the Gods (#10)"],[1,"in  niches in the walls of various chambers, or in some place outside but  near the house, or buried them in the earth with their faces turned in  the direction from which he expected the attack to come.        PLATE XVII.  The Metternich Stele--Obverse.        PLATE XVIII.  The Metternich Stele--Reverse.        Towards the close of the XXVIth Dynasty, when superstition in its most  exaggerated form was general in Egypt, it became the custom to make  house talismans in the form of small stone stelae, with rounded tops,  which rested on bases having convex fronts.  On the front of such a  talisman was sculptured in relief a figure of Horus the Child  (Harpokrates), standing on two crocodiles, holding in his hands figures  of serpents, scorpions, a lion, and a horned animal, each of these  being a symbol of an emissary or ally of Set, the god of Evil.  Above  his head was the head of Bes, and on each side of him were: solar  symbols, i.e., the lily of Nefer-Tem, figures of Ra and Harmakhis, the  Eyes of Ra (the Sun and Moon), etc.  The reverse of the stele and the  whole of the base were covered with magical texts and spells, and when  a talisman of this kind was placed in a house, it was supposed to be  directly under the protection of Horus and his companion gods, who had  vanquished all the hosts of darkness and all the powers of physical and  moral evil.  Many examples of this talisman are to be seen in the great  Museums of Europe, and there are several fine specimens in the Third  Egyptian Room in the British Museum.  They are usually called \"Cippi of  Horus.\"  The largest and most important of all these \"cippi\" is that  which is commonly known as the \"Metternich Stele,\" because it was given  to Prince Metternich by Muhammad `Ali Pasha; it was dug up in 1828  during the building of a cistern in a Franciscan Monastery in  Alexandria, and was first published, with a translation of a large part  of the text, by Professor Golenischeff.[FN#48]   The importance of the  stele is enhanced by the fact that it mentions the name of the king in  whose reign it was made, viz., Nectanebus I., who reigned from B.C. 378  to B.C. 360.        [FN#48]  See Metternichstele, Leipzig, 1877.  The Stele was made for  Ankh-Psemthek, son of the lady Tent-Het-nub, prophet of Nebun, overseer  of Temt and scribe of Het (see line 87).        The obverse, reverse, and two sides of the Metternich Stele have cut  upon them nearly three hundred figures of gods and celestial beings.  These include figures of the great gods of heaven, earth, and the Other  World, figures of the gods of the planets and the Dekans, figures of  the gods of the days of the week, of the weeks, and months, and seasons  of the year, and of the year.  Besides these there are a number of  figures of local forms of the gods which it is difficult to identify.  On the rounded portion of the obverse the place of honour is held by  the solar disk, in which is seen a figure of Khnemu with four ram's  heads, which rests between a pair of arms, and is supported on a lake  of celestial water; on each side of it are four of the spirits of the  dawn, and on the right stands the symbol of the rising sun, Nefer-Temu,  and on the left stands Thoth.  Below this are five rows of small  figures of gods.  Below these is Harpokrates in relief, in the attitude  already described.  He stands on two crocodiles under a kind of canopy,  the sides of which are supported by Thoth and Isis, and holds Typhonic  animals and reptiles.  Above the canopy are the two Eyes of Ra, each  having a pair of human arms and hands.  On the right of Harpokrates are  Seker and Horus, and on his left the symbol of Nefer-Temu.  On the left  and right are the goddesses Nekhebet and Uatchet, who guard the South  of Egypt and the North respectively.  On the reverse and sides are  numerous small figures of gods.  This stele represented the power to  protect man possessed by all the divine beings in the universe, and,  however it was placed, it formed an impassable barrier to every spirit  of evil and to every venomous reptile.  The spells, which are cut in  hieroglyphics on all the parts of the stele not occupied by figures of  gods, were of the most potent character, for they contained the actual  words by which the gods vanquished the powers of darkness and evil.  These spells form the texts which are printed on p. 142 ff., and may be  thus summarized:--    The first spell is an incantation directed against reptiles and noxious  creatures in general.  The chief of these was Apep, the great enemy of  Ra, who took the form of a huge serpent that \"resembled the  intestines,\" and the spell doomed him to decapitation, and burning and  backing in pieces.  These things would be effected by Serqet, the  Scorpion-goddess.  The second part of the spell was directed against  the poison of Apep, and was to be recited over anyone who was bitten by  a snake.  When uttered by Horus it made Apep to vomit, and when used by  a magician properly qualified would make the bitten person to vomit,  and so free his body from the poison.    The next spell is directed to be said to the Cat, i.e., a symbol of the  daughter of Ra, or Isis, who had the head of Ra, the eyes of the  uraeus, the nose of Thoth, the ears of Neb-er-tcher, the mouth of Tem,  the neck of Neheb-ka, the breast of Thoth, the heart of Ra, the hands  of the gods, the belly of Osiris, the thighs of Menthu, the legs of  Khensu, the feet of Amen-Horus, the haunches of Horus, the soles of the  feet of Ra, and the bowels of Meh-urit.  Every member of the Cat  contained a god or goddess, and she was able to destroy the poison of  any serpent, or scorpion, or reptile, which might be injected into her  body.  The spell opens with an address to Ra, who is entreated to come  to his daughter, who has been stung by a scorpion on a lonely road, and  to cause the poison to leave her body.  Thus it seems as if Isis, the  great magician, was at some time stung by a scorpion.    The next section is very difficult to understand.  Ra-Harmakhis is  called upon to come to his daughter, and Shu to his wife, and Isis to  her sister, who has been poisoned.  Then the Aged One, i.e., Ra, is  asked to let Thoth turn back Neha-her, or Set.  \"Osiris is in the  water, but Horus is with him, and the Great Beetle overshadows him,\"  and every evil spirit which dwells in the water is adjured to allow  Horus to proceed to Osiris.  Ra, Sekhet, Thoth, and Heka, this last-  named being the spell personified, are the four great gods who protect  Osiris, and who will blind and choke his enemies, and cut out their  tongues.  The cry of the Cat is again referred to, and Ra is asked if  he does not remember the cry which came from the bank of Netit.  The  allusion here is to the cries which Isis uttered when she arrived at  Netit near Abydos, and found lying there the dead body of her husband.    At this point on the Stele the spells are interrupted by a long  narrative put into the mouth of Isis, which supplies us with some  account of the troubles that she suffered, and describes the death of  Horus through the sting of a scorpion.  Isis, it seems, was shut up in  some dwelling by Set after he murdered Osiris, probably with the  intention of forcing her to marry him, and so assist him to legalize  his seizure of the kingdom.  Isis, as we have already seen, had been  made pregnant by her husband after his death, and Thoth now appeared to  her, and advised her to hide herself with her unborn child, and to  bring him forth in secret, and he promised her that her son should  succeed in due course to his father's throne.  With the help of Thoth  she escaped from her captivity, and went forth accompanied by the Seven  Scorpion-goddesses, who brought her to the town of Per-Sui, on the edge  of the Reed Swamps.  She applied to a woman for a night's shelter, but  the woman shut her door in her face.  To punish her one of the  Scorpion-goddesses forced her way into the woman's house, and stung her  child to death.  The grief of the woman was so bitter and sympathy-  compelling that Isis laid her hands on the child, and, having uttered  one of her most potent spells over him, the poison of the scorpion ran  out of his body, and the child came to life again.  The words of the  spell are cut on the Stele, and they were treasured by the Egyptians as  an infallible remedy for scorpion stings.  When the woman saw that her  son had been brought back to life by Isis, she was filled with joy and  gratitude, and, as a mark of her repentance, she brought large  quantities of things from her house as gifts for Isis, and they were so  many that they filled the house of the kind, but poor, woman who had  given Isis shelter.    Now soon after Isis had restored to life the son of the woman who had  shown churlishness to her, a terrible calamity fell upon her, for her  beloved son Horus was stung by a scorpion and died.  The news of this  event was conveyed to her by the gods, who cried out to her to come to  see her son Horus, whom the terrible scorpion Uhat had killed.  Isis,  stabbed with pain at the news, as if a knife had been driven into her  body, ran out distraught with grief.  It seems that she had gone to  perform a religious ceremony in honour of Osiris in a temple near  Hetep-hemt, leaving her child carefully concealed in Sekhet-An.  During  her absence the scorpion Uhat, which had been sent by Set, forced its  way into the biding-place of Horus, and there stung him to death.  When  Isis came and found the dead body, she burst forth in lamentations, the  sound of which brought all the people from the neighbouring districts  to her side.  As she related to them the history of her sufferings they  endeavoured to console her, and when they found this to be impossible  they lifted up their voices and wept with her.  Then Isis placed her  nose in the mouth of Horus so that she might discover if he still  breathed, but there was "]]]
