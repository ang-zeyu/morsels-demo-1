And just as they were going around a curve, Sahwah,  who sat at the front end of the sled, untied the rope, and away went the  machine around the corner, and left them stranded in the snow. Gladys  felt the release of the trailer, but pretended that she knew nothing  about it, and drove ahead at full speed, and traveling in a circle, came  up behind the marooned voyagers and surprised them with a hearty laugh.  This time she towed them back to Sahwah's house, where they drank hot  cocoa to warm themselves up, and all declared they had never had such  fun in their lives.    \"And to think how near I came to missing this!\" said Mrs. Evans, as she  and Gladys were driving home, and she shivered when she remembered how  she had almost gone to the musicale.          CHAPTER VI.      GLADYS UPHOLDS THE FAMILY CREDIT.    Mrs. Evans confided her plans for a Christmas week party to Gladys the  day following the snow frolic, and Gladys was delighted with the idea.  She dearly loved to entertain her friends. The frock was ordered from  New York and Mrs. Evans and Gladys spent long hours working out the  details of the affair. Rumors of the party and the dress Gladys was to  have leaked out to the Winnebagos and from them to the whole class.  Every one was on tiptoe to find out who would be invited. Mrs. Davis and  Mrs. Jones, hearing the talk about the coming function, began to wonder  if they were on the right track after all in regard to the Evans  fortune. Two weeks before Christmas the invitations came out.  Twenty-five girls and twenty-five boys, mostly from the high school  class, were asked. What a flutter of satisfaction there was among those  who had been invited, and what a disappointment among those who had not  been, and what consultations about dresses among the favored ones!    This question was an acute one with Migwan. She had not had a new party  dress for several years, and in the present state of their finances she  could not get one now. She looked at the old one, faded and spotted, and  shook her head despairingly. \"I foresee where Miss Migwan develops a  sudden illness on the night of the party,\" she said with tight lips,  \"unless I hear from my story in time.\" As if in answer to her thoughts  the story came back the very next day. There was no letter from the  editor concerning the merits or faults of the piece, only a printed  rejection slip, but that stated that only typewritten manuscripts would  be considered. Migwan's air castle tumbled about her ears. She had no  typewriter and knew no one who had. Her experience did not include a  knowledge of public stenographers, and even if she had thought of that  way out the expense would have prevented her from having her story  copied. Her dream of fame and wealth was short-lived, and the world was  stale, flat and unprofitable. The house was not yet rented, as the  repairs had been delayed again and again. It would be another month at  least before that would be a paying proposition. Hearing the other girls  talk about Gladys's party all the time filled her with desperation. She  began to shun the Winnebagos. The keen zest went out of her studying and  even her beloved Latin lost its savor.    Nyoda finally noticed it. Migwan failed to recite in English class for  two days in succession, which was an unheard-of thing. Nyoda thought  that Migwan had her head so full of the coming party that she was  neglecting her lessons, and said so, half banteringly, as Migwan  lingered after class to pick up some papers she had dropped on the  floor. That was the last straw, and Migwan burst into tears. Nyoda was  all sympathy in a moment. Now Nyoda happened to have the \"seeing eye,\"  with which some people are blessed, and had surmised, from certain  little signs she had observed, that Migwan had written something or  other, and sent it away to a magazine. She knew only too well what the  outcome would be, and her heart ached when she thought of Migwan's  coming disappointment. Therefore, when Migwan, quickly recovering her  composure, said calmly, \"It's nothing, Nyoda; I simply tried to do  something and failed,\" Nyoda asked quietly, \"Did your story come back?\"    Migwan looked at her in amazement. \"How did you know I had written any  story?\" she asked.    \"Oh, a little bird told me,\" replied Nyoda lightly. \"Cheer up. All the  famous authors had their first work rejected. You have achieved the  first mark of fame.\" Migwan smiled wanly. Her tragedies always seemed to  lose their sting in the light of Nyoda's optimism. She told her about  the necessity for a typewriter. \"I could have told you that to begin  with, if you had asked my humble advice,\" replied Nyoda. \"But if a  miserable writing machine is all that stands between you and fame and  fortune, your fortune is already made. The woman whose rooms I am living  in has one in her possession. It belongs to her son, I believe, but as  he is at present in China there is no danger of his wanting it for some  time. She has offered to let me use it on several occasions, and I don't  doubt but what we can make some arrangement to accommodate you.\"    The world seemed a pretty good place of habitation after all to Migwan  that day when she went home from school, in spite of the fact that she  had no dress to wear to the party. The situation began to appear faintly  humorous to her. Here was all the interest centered on what Gladys was  going to wear, when all the time the real, vital question was what _she_  was going to wear! What a commotion there would be if the other  Winnebagos knew the truth! Her thoughts began to beat themselves, into  rhythm as she walked home through the crunching snow:      \"Broke, broke, broke,    And such clothes in the windows I see!    And I would that my purse could answer    The demands that are made on she!      \"O well for the millionaire's wife,    Who can pay eighty bones for a shawl,    And well for the African maids,    Who don't need any clothes at all!      \"And the pennies, they all go    To the grocer, and so do the dimes,    But, O, for the little crepe meteor dress    I saw down in Oppenheim's!      \"Broke, broke, broke,    And such styles in the windows I see!    What would I not give for the rest of the month    For the salary of John D!\"    \"Would you just as soon run up to the attic and get the blanket sheets  out of the trunk?\" asked her mother when she had finished her dinner. \"I  was cold in bed last night.\" Migwan went up promptly. She found the  sheets and laid them out, and was then seized with a desire to rummage  among the things in the trunk. She pawed over old valentines, bonnets of  a by-gone day, lace mitts, and all the useless relics that are usually  found in mother's trunk that had been _her_ mother's. Down at the  bottom, however, there was a paper package of considerable size. Migwan  opened it carefully and brought to view a dress made of white brocaded  satin, yellowed with age. A sudden inspiration struck her, and, laying  it carefully on top of the blankets, she ran downstairs to her mother.  \"What is this dress?\" she asked eagerly.    Mrs. Gardiner's face lighted tenderly when she saw it. \"Why, that's my  wedding dress,\" she said.    \"Oh,\" said Migwan in a disappointed tone, laying the dress down.    \"What did you want with it?\" asked her mother.    \"Why, I thought if it was just a dress,\" replied Migwan, \"I could make  it over to wear to Gladys's party, but of course if it is your wedding  dress you wouldn't care to have it changed.\"    \"I don't see why not,\" said Mrs. Gardiner. \"It's no good as it is. I've  never had it on since my wedding day. The material in that dress cost  two dollars a yard and is better than what you get at that price  nowadays.\" A sudden recollection illumined her face. \"The night of the  party is my wedding anniversary,\" she said. \"There couldn't be a better  occasion to wear it!\"    \"Would you really be willing to have me cut it up?\" asked Migwan  rapturously clasping her hands. That afternoon her head really was so  full of party plans that she forgot to get her lessons. The dress was  laid out on the dining room table and examined as to its possibilities.  \"I don't know but what it would be best to dye it some pretty shade of  green or blue,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, after thinking the matter over. \"It  is too yellow to use as it is, and there is no time to bleach it  properly.\" So it was ripped up and dyed Nile green, a shade which was  particularly becoming to Migwan. There was enough goods in the train to  make the entire dress, so there was no need to do any piecing.    Instead of avoiding the subject of the party, Migwan now joined happily  in the discussions, and asked questions right and left about the best  style in which to make her dress. She said nothing about the former  function of that particular piece of goods. \"Extravagant Migwan!\" said  Sahwah, \"getting a satin dress for the party. My mother made me get silk  poplin,\" Gladys's dress had arrived from New York, but she would not  breathe a word in regard to it and the girls were wild with curiosity.  Only Hinpoha was allowed to behold its glories, as a consolation for not  being able to come to the party. Of course Hinpoha had been sworn to  secrecy regarding it, but that did not keep her from rhapsodizing about  it on general principles and pitching the girls' curiosity still higher.    Now there was one girl who had been invited to the party who said very  little about it. This was Emily Meeks, who sat beside Gladys in the  session room. Emily had also entered the class this fall, but, unlike  Gladys, her path had not been marked by triumphs. She was timid and  retiring, and after being three months in the class was little better  known than she had been at first. The truth was that Emily was an  orphan, working her way through High School by taking care of the  children of one of the professors after school hours, and had neither"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11734"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 460, October 25, 1884 (#11)"],[1,"snake-bite, but the mere fact of  having it about one was supposed to keep away snakes, who were said  altogether to avoid the places where it grew. But, apart from this, the  striking appearance of this plant, which often grows to an enormous size,  would be sufficient to suggest its employment in art. According to  measurements of Dr. Julius Schmidt, who is not long since dead, and was the  director of the Observatory at Athens, a number of these plants grow in the  Valley of Cephisus, and attain a height of as much as two meters, the  spathe alone measuring nearly one meter. [The lecturer here exhibited a  drawing (natural size) of this species, drawn to the measurements above  referred to.]    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    Dr. Sintenis, the botanist, who last year traveled through Asia Minor and  Greece, tells me that he saw beautiful specimens of the plant in many  places, _e.g._, in Assos, in the neighborhood of the Dardanelles, under the  cypresses of the Turkish cemeteries.    The inflorescence corresponds almost exactly to the ornament, but the  multipartite leaf has also had a particular influence upon its development  and upon that of several collateral forms which I cannot now discuss. The  shape of the leaf accounts for several as yet unexplained extraordinary  forms in the ancient plane-ornament, and in the Renaissance forms that have  been thence developed. It first suggested the idea to me of studying the  plant attentively after having had the opportunity five years ago of seeing  the leaves in the Botanic Gardens at Pisa. It was only afterward that I  succeeded in growing some flowers which fully confirmed the expectations  that I had of them (Figs. 10 and 11).    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]    The leaf in dracunculus has a very peculiar shape; it consists of a number  of lobes which are disposed upon a stalk which is more or less forked  (tends more or less to dichotomize). If you call to your minds some of the  Pompeian wall decorations, you will perceive that similar forms occur there  in all possible variations. Stems are regularly seen in decorations that  run perpendicularly, surrounded by leaves of this description. Before this,  these suggested the idea of a misunderstood (or very conventional)  perspective representation of a circular flower. Now the form also occurs  in this fashion, and thus negatives the idea of a perspective  representation of a closed flower. It is out of this form in combination  with the flower-form that the series of patterns was developed which we  have become acquainted with in Roman art, especially in the ornament of  Titus' Thermae and in the Renaissance period in Raphael's work. [The  lecturer here explained a series of illustrations of the ornaments referred  to (Figs. 12, 13, 14).]    The attempt to determine the course of the first group of forms has been to  a certain extent successful, but we meet greater difficulties in the study  of the second.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.]    It is difficult to obtain a firm basis on which to conduct our  investigations from the historical or geographical point of view into this  form of art, which was introduced into the West by Arabico-Moorish culture,  and which has since been further developed here. There is only one method  open to us in the determination of the form, which is to pass gradually  from the richly developed and strongly differentiated forms to the smaller  and simpler ones, even if these latter should have appeared  contemporaneously or even later than the former. Here we have again to  refer to the fact that has already been mentioned, to wit, that Oriental  art remained stationary throughout long periods of time. In point of fact,  the simpler forms are invariably characterized by a nearer and nearer  approach to the more ancient patterns and also to the natural flower-forms  of the Araceae. We find the spathe, again, sometimes drawn like an acanthus  leaf, more often, however, bulged out, coming to be more and more of a mere  outline figure, and becoming converted into a sort of background; then the  spadix, generally conical in shape, sometimes, however, altogether replaced  by a perfect thistle, at other times again by a pomegranate. Auberville, in  his magnificent work \"L'Ornement des Tissus,\" is astonished to find the  term pomegranate-pattern almost confined to these forms, since their  central part is generally formed of a thistle-form. As far as I can  discover in the literature that is at my disposal, this question has not  had any particular attention devoted to it except in the large work upon  Ottoman architecture published in Constantinople under the patronage of  Edhem Pasha. The pomegranate that has served as the original of the pattern  in question is in this work surrounded with leaves till it gives some sort  of an approach to the pattern. (There are important suggestions in the book  as to the employment of melon-forms.) Whoever has picked the fruit from the  tender twigs of the pomegranate tree, which are close set with small  altered leaves, will never dream of attributing the derivation of the  thorny leaves that appear in the pattern to pomegranate leaves at any stage  of their development.    [Illustration: FIG. 14]    It does not require much penetration to see that the outline of the whole  form corresponds to the spathe of the Araceae, even although in later times  the jagged contour is all that has remained of it, and it appears to have  been provided with ornamental forms quite independently of the rest of the  pattern. The inner thistle-form cannot be derived from the common thistle,  because the surrounding leaves negative any such idea. The artichoke theory  also has not enough in its favor, although the artichoke, as well as the  thistle, was probably at a later time directly pressed into service. Prof.  Ascherson first called my attention to the extremely anciently cultivated  plant, the safflor (_Carthamus tinctoris_, Fig. 15), a thistle plant whose  flowers were employed by the ancients as a dye. Some drawings and dried  specimens, as well as the literature of the subject, first gave me a hope  to find that this plant was the archetype of this ornament, a hope that was  borne out by the study of the actual plant, although I was unable to grow  it to any great perfection.    In the days of the Egyptian King Sargo (according to Ascherson and  Schweinfurth) this plant was already well known as a plant of cultivation;  in a wild state it is not known (De Candolle, \"Originel des Plantes  cultivees\"). In Asia its cultivation stretches to Japan. Semper cites a  passage from an Indian drama to the effect that over the doorway there was  stretched an arch of ivory, and about it were bannerets on which wild  safran (_Saflor_) was painted.    [Illustration: FIG. 15]    The importance of the plant as a dye began steadily to decrease, and it has  now ceased to have any value as such in the face of the introduction of  newer coloring matters (a question that was treated of in a paper read a  short time ago by Dr. Reimann before this Society). Perhaps its only use  nowadays is in the preparation of rouge (_rouge vegetale_).    But at a time when dyeing, spinning, and weaving were, if not in the one  hand, yet at any rate intimately connected with one another in the narrow  circle of a home industry, the appearance of this beautiful gold-yellow  plant, heaped up in large masses, would be very likely to suggest its  immortalization in textile art, because the drawing is very faithful to  nature in regard to the thorny involucre. Drawings from nature of the plant  in the old botanical works of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries look  very like ornamental patterns. Now after the general form had been  introduced, pomegranates or other fruits--for instance, pine-apples--were  introduced within the nest of leaves.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.]    Into the detailed study of the intricacies of this subject I cannot here  enter; the East-Asian influences are not to be neglected, which had  probably even in early times an effect upon the form that was assumed, and  have fused the correct style of compound flowers for flat ornament with the  above-mentioned forms, so as to produce peculiar patterns; we meet them  often in the so-called Persian textures and flat ornaments (Fig. 16).    We now come to the third group of forms--the so-called Cashmere pattern, or  Indian palmetta. The developed forms, which, when they have attained their  highest development, often show us outlines that are merely fanciful, and  represent quite a bouquet of flowers leaning over to one side, and  springing from a vessel (the whole corresponding to the Roman form with the  vessel), must be thrown to one side, while we follow up the simpler forms,  because in this case also we have no information as to either the where or  the when the forms originated. (Figs. 17, 18, 19.)    [Illustration: FIG. 17.]    Here again we are struck by resemblances to the forms that were the  subjects of our previous study, we even come across direct transitional  forms, which differ from the others only by the lateral curve of the apex  of the leaf; sometimes it is the central part, the spadix, that is bent  outward, and the very details show a striking agreement with the structure  of the aroid inflorescence, so much so that one might regard them as  actually copied from them.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.]    This form of ornament has been introduced into Europe since the French  expedition to Egypt, owing to the importation of genuine Cashmere shawls.  (When it cropped up in isolated forms, as in Venice in the fifteenth  century, it appears not to have exerted any influence; its introduction is  perhaps rather to be attributed to calico-printing.) Soon afterward the  European shawl-manufacture, which is still in a flourishing state, was  introduced. Falcot informs us that designs of a celebrated French artist,  Couder, for"]]]
