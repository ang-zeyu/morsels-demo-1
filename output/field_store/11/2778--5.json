Same source as 2.        (7) KADDY'S LUCK.    Same source as 2.        (8) STORY OF GELERT.    As told by an old fisherman. The variant of this well-known story may  prove useful. Borrow's \"tent\" theory is, I think, an invention of his  own. I was fortunate enough to get possession of an old book (without  title-page, title, or author's name), in which the following remarks on  this story occur:--    \"Some say this should be written Bedd Gelert, or Gilert, signifying  Gelert's, or Gilert's Grave. To this name is annexed a traditional  story, which it is hardly worth while to mention. However, the substance  of the tradition is, that Prince Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, in a fit of  passion, killed a favourite greyhound in this place, named Gelert, or  Gilert, and that, repenting of the deed, he caused a tomb to be erected  over his grave, where afterwards the parish church was built. See the  story at large in Mr. Edw. Jones's _Welsh Music_. But we may reasonably  conclude that this is all a fable, both when we consider the impiety of  building a church for divine worship over the grave of a dog, an impiety  not consistent with the genius of that age; and when we consider, also,  that the establishment of parochial cures, and the building of our  country churches in Wales, began soon after the dispersion of the  British clergy, which happened at the time of the massacre at Bangor  Iscoed, A.D. 603, at the instigation of Augustine the Monk, employed  for that purpose by the See of Rome. Llewelyn ap Iorwerth governed Wales  from A.D. 1194 to 1240, when he died; so that parish churches were built  between five and six hundred years before the time of this prince.    \"This Gelert, or Gilert, must, in all probability, have been some old  monk or saint of that name, who was interred here, and was either the  first founder of this church, or one to whose memory it was dedicated,  if built after his time. Bethgelert, before the Reformation, was a  priory. Lewis Dwnn, a bard of the fifteenth century, in a poem (the  purport of which is to solicit David, the Prior of Bethgelert, to bestow  on John Wynne, of Gwydwr, Esq., a fine bay horse which he possessed)  extols the Prior for his liberality and learning. Hence we are led to  suppose that this monk was very opulent, and a popular character in his  time.\"    The stories of a hunter killing his favourite greyhound (always a  greyhound) are common to many districts. The book quoted is said to be  written by a Mr. Williams, in 1800.        (9) ORIGIN OF THE WELSH.    Source: An old seaman, who avers he heard it on a ship, on the way home  from Calcutta. I look with suspicion on the story. However, the Welsh  always believed they were descended from the Trojans, and the author of  the book cited says on this point:--    \"Elen was a very common name among the ancient British ladies, and it  seems to have been often bestowed out of compliment upon genteel and  beautiful women; as we sometimes hear at this day _Ei Elen O--his  Elen_ when a man has a young and beautiful wife; and there is hardly  a love-song but the woman is called or compared in it to the Trojan  Helena, or Elen, as the Welsh write and pronounce the word. The Welsh  have had amongst them, time out of mind, a tradition that the first  colony of Bretons came to these islands from Troy after the destruction  of that city.\"        (10) THE STORY OF THE CROWS.    Source: Told me by an old man, who knew the defunct.        (11) ROBERTS AND THE FAIRIES.    Source: Told me by another old man, and I believe it to be genuine.    There is another story of the same kind, of a man who was searching for  treasure in Beaumaris Castle, and after he had told of his luck a stone  fell on him, so that he had to go away.        (12) THE QUEEN OF THE DELL.    Came from the same old pedlar as No. 1. A genuine story. The narrator  says you seldom hear a fairy story in Anglesea unless there is a witch  in it.        (13) ELLEN'S LUCK.    Source: Told me by the same old man as No. 11. I believe it to be  genuine, and the narrator trustworthy.        (14) THE PELLINGS.    Source: Taken _verbatim_ from the old book referred to. In the context  the author says these people inhabited the districts about the foot of  Snowdon, and were known by the nickname of Pellings, which is not yet  extinct; and he says they tell the tale as given. After telling  the story, which he entitles a fairy story, he makes the following  suggestive comments:--    \"Before the Reformation, when the Christian world was enveloped in  Popish darkness and superstition, when the existence of fairies and  other spectres was not questioned, and when such a swarm of idle  people, under the names of minstrels, poets, begging friars, etc., were  permitted to ramble about, it may be supposed that these vagrants had  amongst themselves some kind of rule or government, if I may so term  it, as we are assured those that now-a-days go under the name of gypsies  have. Such people might, at appointed times on fine moonlight nights,  assemble in some sequestered spot, to regulate their dark affairs and  divide the spoil; and then perform their nightly _orgies_, so as to  terrify people from coming near them, lest their tricks and cheats  should be discovered. It is possible the men of Ystrad might have less  superstition, and somewhat more courage, than their neighbours, and  supposing such a one to come suddenly on these nightly revellers, he  would of course cause great consternation amongst them; and, on finding  a comely female in the group, it is not unnatural to imagine that he  might, as the heroes of old have done before him, seize on a beauteous  Helen, carry her home, and in process of time marry her--for many  valorous knights have done the latter; but she, on account of some  domestic jars, might afterwards have eloped from him, and returned to  her former companions and occupation.\"    The author makes the following remarks in a foot-note:--    \"The English writers of romances feign the fairies to be of a smaller  size than even the fabled pigmies; the Welsh people ever supposed them  to be of the same stature with mankind. Shakespeare describes his fairy  as less than a mite, riding through people's brains to make the chase.  This has not been my experience. I have had them described to me of all  sizes, varying from a woman to little people two feet high. They have  been described, when large, as dressed like ordinary ladies, when small,  with short dresses; no hats, and hair in a plaited pigtail down the  back.\"    Finally, the writer says:    \"What other interpretation can be given to this tale I know not. This,  and such other tales, the material of which one might collect a volume,  must, it may reasonably be supposed, have something of reality for their  origin and foundation, before they were dressed out in the familiar garb  given them by their authors.\"    So our author is a \"realist\" as regards the origin of fairies.        (15) THE LONG-LIVED ANCESTORS.    Source: Taken _verbatim_ from the book quoted. This fable refers to the  place, _Cwm Caw Lwyd_, regarding which the writer says:    \"With regard to the _Cwm Caw Lwyd_, there is a still extant fable  entitled _Creaduriaid Hir Hoedlog_ (i.e., the long-lived ancestors),  which seems to be a composition of no modern date. At present the moral  of it cannot be elucidated; but it seems that, in one respect, it was  intended to represent the solitariness of this place, inhabited only  by the weeping owl from remote antiquity; and certainly it is the most  solitary and romantic retreat that the mind of man could imagine.\" The  writer says his is a \"literal translation of the story, according to the  Welsh phraseology\".        (16) THE GIANTESS'S APRON-FULL.    Source: _Verbatim_ from the same book. Referring to the heaps of stone  found on the hill-tops, he gives the fable of the heap found  upon _Bwlchy Ddeufaen_, which he says is called _Ban Clodidd y  Gawres_--literally, the giantess's apron-full.    \"The writer regards such tales as originally intended as hyperboles, to  magnify the prowess and magnanimity of renowned persons.\"        (17) A FABLE.    Source: Taken _verbatim_ from the same book. The writer quotes it  apropos of the Roman custom of bribing the Britons on the mountain tops.  We are told the fable was delivered by one of the Britons, named _Gwrgan  Farfdrwch_, who spoke to this effect, and then follows the fable.        (18) THE STORY OF THE PIG-TROUGH.    Source: Told by Hugh's daughter. Genuine.        (19) BILLY DUFFY AND THE DEVIL.    Source: Told me by the old man who told me of the origin of the Welsh.  Vague.        (20) JOHN O' GROATS.    Same source. Vague.        (21) EVA'S LUCK.    Source: A Jersey fisherman. Reliable. He also informed me that large  stones, supported on others, were called \"Fairy Stones\" in Jersey.        (22) THE FISHERMEN OF SHETLAND.    Source: Told me by a yachting hand, who heard it from a Shetlander named  Abernethy who was serving in the same yacht with him. Not many years  ago, some volunteers at Beaumaris swore they saw a mermaid there,  and fired several shots at it. I think this story to be genuine and  beautiful.        (23) THE PASTOR'S NURSE.    Source: Reliable. Written for me by the Pastor's mother in French. Given  _verbatim_.        FINAL.    The book I have quoted is in my possession, and was written, I am told,  by a Mr. Williams, a Welshman, of Llandegai in Anglesea. That he was  shrewd, reasonable, and knew the people of North Wales thoroughly, is  evident from the context. The book has no date, but appears to have been  written in 1800."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8694"],[0,"The Abbot's Ghost, or Maurice Treherne's Temptation: A Christmas Story (#10)"],[1,"labor under some mistake; Treherne is by no means a  gambler. I owe him no goodwill, but I cannot hear him slandered.\"    \"You are generous, but I am not mistaken. Can you, on your honor, assure  me that Maurice never played?\"    Mrs. Snowdon's keen eyes were on him, and he looked embarrassed for a  moment, but answered with some hesitation, \"Why, no, I cannot say that,  but I can assure you that he is not an habitual gambler. All young men  of his rank play more or less, especially abroad. It is merely an  amusement with most, and among men is not considered dishonorable or  dangerous. Ladies think differently, I believe, at least in England.\"    At the word \"abroad,\" Mrs. Snowdon's face brightened, and she suddenly  dropped her eyes, as if afraid of betraying some secret purpose.    \"Indeed we do, and well we may, many of us having suffered from this  pernicious habit. I have had special cause to dread and condemn it, and  the fear that Octavia should in time suffer what I have suffered as a  girl urges me to interfere where otherwise I should be dumb. Mr. Annon,  there was a rumor that Maurice was forced to quit Paris, owing to some  dishonorable practices at the gaming table. Is this true?\"    \"Nay, don't ask me; upon my soul I cannot tell you. I only know that  something was amiss, but what I never learned. Various tales were  whispered at the clubs, and Sir Jasper indignantly denied them all. The  bravery with which Maurice saved his cousin, and the sad affliction  which fell upon him, silenced the gossip, and it was soon forgotten.\"    Mrs. Snowdon remained silent for a moment, with brows knit in deep  thought, while Annon uneasily watched her. Suddenly she glanced over her  shoulder, drew nearer, and whispered cautiously, \"Did the rumors of  which you speak charge him with--\" and the last word was breathed into  Annon's ear almost inaudibily.    He started, as if some new light broke on him, and stared at the speaker  with a troubled face for an instant, saying hastily, \"No, but now you  remind me that when an affair of that sort was discussed the other day  Treherne looked very odd, and rolled himself away, as if it didn't  interest him. I can't believe it, and yet it may be something of the  kind. That would account for old Sir Jasper's whim, and Treherne's  steady denial of any knowledge of the cause. How in heaven's name did  you learn this?\"    \"My woman's wit suggested it, and my woman's will shall confirm or  destroy the suspicion. My lady and Octavia evidently know nothing, but  they shall if there is any danger of the girl's being won by him.\"    \"You would not tell her!\" exclaimed Annon.    \"I will, unless you do it\" was the firm answer.    \"Never! To betray a friend, even to gain the woman I love, is a thing I  cannot do; my honor forbids it.\"    Mrs. Snowdon smiled scornfully.    \"Men's code of honor is a strong one, and we poor women suffer from it.  Leave this to me; do your best, and if all other means fail, you may be  glad to try my device to prevent Maurice from marrying his cousin.  Gratitude and pity are strong allies, and if he recovers, his strong  will will move heaven and earth to gain her. Good night.\" And leaving  her last words to rankle in Annon's mind, Mrs. Snowdon departed to  endure sleepless hours full of tormenting memories, newborn hopes, and  alternations of determination and despair.    Treherne's prospect of recovery filled the whole house with delight, for  his patient courage and unfailing cheerfulness had endeared him to all.  It was no transient amendment, for day by day he steadily gained  strength and power, passing rapidly from chair to crutches, from  crutches to a cane and a friend's arm, which was always ready for him.  Pain returned with returning vitality, but he bore it with a fortitude  that touched all who witnessed it. At times motion was torture, yet  motion was necessary lest the torpidity should return, and Treherne took  his daily exercise with unfailing perseverance, saying with a smile,  though great drops stood upon his forehead, \"I have something dearer  even than health to win. Hold me up, Jasper, and let me stagger on, in  spite of everything, till my twelve turns are made.\"    He remembered Lady Treherne's words, \"If you were well, I'd gladly give  my girl to you.\" This inspired him with strength, endurance, and a  happiness which could not be concealed. It overflowed in looks, words,  and acts; it infected everyone, and made these holidays the blithest the  old abbey had seen for many a day.    Annon devoted himself to Octavia, and in spite of her command to be left  in peace till the New Year, she was very kind--so kind that hope flamed  up in his heart, though he saw that something like compassion often  shone on him from her frank eyes, and her compliance had no touch of the  tender docility which lovers long to see. She still avoided Treherne,  but so skillfully that few observed the change but Annon and himself. In  public Sir Jasper appeared to worship at the sprightly Rose's shrine,  and she fancied her game was prospering well.    But had any one peeped behind the scenes it would have been discovered  that during the half hour before dinner, when everyone was in their  dressing rooms and the general taking his nap, a pair of ghostly black  figures flitted about the haunted gallery, where no servant ventured  without orders. The major fancied himself the only one who had made this  discovery, for Mrs. Snowdon affected Treherne's society in public, and  was assiduous in serving and amusing the \"dear convalescent,\" as she  called him. But the general did not sleep; he too watched and waited,  longing yet dreading to speak, and hoping that this was but a harmless  freak of Edith's, for her caprices were many, and till now he had  indulged them freely. This hesitation disgusted the major, who, being a  bachelor, knew little of women's ways, and less of their powers of  persuasion. The day before New Year he took a sudden resolution, and  demanded a private interview with the general.    \"I have come on an unpleasant errand, sir,\" he abruptly began, as the  old man received him with an expression which rather daunted the major.  \"My friendship for Lady Treherne, and my guardianship of her children,  makes me jealous of the honor of the family. I fear it is in danger,  sir; pardon me for saying it, but your wife is the cause.\"    \"May I trouble you to explain, Major Royston\" was all the general's  reply, as his old face grew stern and haughty.    \"I will, sir, briefly. I happen to know from Jasper that there were love  passages between Miss Dubarry and himself a year or more ago in Paris. A  whim parted them, and she married. So far no reproach rests upon either,  but since she came here it has been evident to others as well as myself  that Jasper's affection has revived, and that Mrs. Snowdon does not  reject and reprove it as she should. They often meet, and from Jasper's  manner I am convinced that mischief is afloat. He is ardent, headstrong,  and utterly regardless of the world's opinion in some cases. I have  watched them, and what I tell you is true.\"    \"Prove it.\"    \"I will. They meet in the north gallery, wrapped in dark cloaks, and  play ghost if anyone comes. I concealed myself behind the screen last  evening at dusk, and satisfied myself that my suspicions were correct. I  heard little of their conversation, but that little was enough.\"    \"Repeat it, if you please.\"    \"Sir Jasper seemed pleading for some promise which she reluctantly gave,  saying, 'While you live I will be true to my word with everyone but him.  He will suspect, and it will be useless to keep it from him.'    \"'He will shoot me for this if he knows I am the traitor,'  expostulated Jasper.    \"'He shall not know that; I can hoodwink him easily, and serve my  purpose also.'    \"'You are mysterious, but I leave all to you and wait for my reward.  When shall I have it, Edith?' She laughed, and answered so low I could  not hear, for they left the gallery as they spoke. Forgive me, General,  for the pain I inflict. You are the only person to whom I have spoken,  and you are the only person who can properly and promptly prevent this  affair from bringing open shame and scandal on an honorable house. To  you I leave it, and will do my part with this infatuated young man if  you will withdraw the temptation which will ruin him.\"    \"I will. Thank you, Major. Trust to me, and by tomorrow I will prove  that I can act as becomes me.\"    The grief and misery in the general's face touched the major; he  silently wrung his hand and went away, thanking heaven more fervently  than ever that no cursed coquette of a woman had it in her power to  break his heart.    While this scene was going on above, another was taking place in the  library. Treherne sat there alone, thinking happy thoughts evidently,  for his eyes shone and his lips smiled as he mused, while watching the  splendors of a winter sunset. A soft rustle and the faint scent of  violets warned him of Mrs. Snowdon's approach, and a sudden foreboding  told him that danger was near. The instant he saw her face his fear  was confirmed, for exultation, resolve, and love met and mingled in  the expression it wore. Leaning in the window recess, where the red  light shone full on her lovely face and queenly figure, she said,  softly yet with a ruthless accent below the softness, \"Dreaming  dreams, Maurice, which will never come to pass, unless I will it. I  know your secret, and I shall use it to prevent the fulfillment of the  foolish hope you cherish.\"    \"Who told you?\" he demanded, with an almost fierce flash of the eye and  an angry flush.    \"I discovered it, as I warned you I should. My memory is good, I recall  the gossip of long ago, I observe the faces, words, and acts of those  whom I suspect, and unconscious hints from them give me the truth.\"    \"I doubt it,\" and Treherne smiled securely.
