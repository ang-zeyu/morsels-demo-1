Look what you did for my chicken run. And believe me,  that entanglement will give a shock that makes a man stand right up and  shake.\"    \"Have you tried it yourself?\" asked Tom.    \"No. But my servant did. I saw him through the window of my study doing  some kind of a shimmy with the shovel. Thought he'd gone crazy. Then I  saw what he had done. It was early in the morning and I hadn't turned  the current off, and he had put one hand against the wires. When he  dropped the shovel as I told him to, bless my plyers and nippers! he  was all right.\"    \"The current would not seriously hurt him,\" said Tom. \"I was careful  about that.\"    \"It killed two tomcats,\" said Mr. Damon. \"I certainly was glad of that,  for those two ash-barrel cats kept the whole neighborhood awake. Bless  my claws and whiskers! how those two cats did use to yell. But when one  tried to climb the wires and the other sprang on him, it was all over!  That is, all over but the burial party.\"    Mr. Damon was on the ground when the mechanical equipment and a part of  the electrical equipment of the new locomotive arrived and was set up  in the erection shed. The length of the machine was what first  impressed Ned Newton as well as Mr. Damon.    \"Bless my yardstick!\" exclaimed the eccentric man, \"it's as long as a  gossip's tongue. What a monster it will be!\"    \"How long is it, Tom?\" asked Ned Newton.    \"When completed, and standing on its drivers and bogie truck and  trailer truck, from cow-catcher to rear bumper it will be a few inches  over ninety feet. And that is slightly longer than the biggest electric  locomotive so far built. But length does not so much enter into the  value of the machine. I would have it built more compactly if I could.\"    \"What is the horsepower?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"I figure on forty-four hundred horsepower. The power must be received  from a three thousand-volt direct-current trolley.  There are twelve  driving-wheels, as you can see. Each pair of drivers will be driven by  a twin-motor geared to the axles through a system of flexible spring  drive. Remember, I have got to obtain both speed as well as power in  this locomotive, for it is being built to pull a passenger train--a  fast cross-continent express--to compete with the best passenger  equipment in the country.\"    \"Bless my combination ticket!\" murmured Mr. Damon. \"You have picked out  some task, and no mistake, Tom Swift.\"    \"He'll do it,\" cried Ned, with his usual optimism when Tom had once  started on any experimental work. \"Of course he will. Just as she  stands there now, only half put together, I would be willing to bet a  farm that she is a better locomotive than the Jandel patent.\"    \"Three cheers!\" laughed Tom. \"Ned is as enthusiastic as usual.  But  believe me, friends, we are not going to turn out a better locomotive  than the Jandel without both thought and work.\"    His friends' enthusiasm was heartening, however. No doubt of that. He  never let them into his experiment room, any more than he allowed his  workmen in there. Aside from his own father, nobody really knew what  Tom Swift was doing behind that always-locked door.    The huge structure of the locomotive was set up on the driving wheels  and leading and trailing trucks by Tom's chief foreman and a picked  crew. Just such another locomotive had never been seen anywhere about  Shopton. Naturally the men at work on the monster began to speak of it  outside the works.    Not that they betrayed any secrets regarding the locomotive. In fact,  as yet none of them knew anything about what Tom intended to do with  the big machine. But the story soon circulated that Tom Swift, the  young inventor, was about to show all the previous builders of electric  locomotives how such machines should be built.    It was even whispered that Tom's objective was a two-mile-a-minute  locomotive. And when this was publicly known the information was not  long in seeping to the ears of certain men who had been keeping as  close a watch as they dared on the Swift Construction Company and the  activities of Tom himself.    Ned Newton went to the bank one Friday for money for the payroll of the  working and clerical force of the Swift Company.  It was an errand he  never relegated to any employee.    Ned had once worked himself in the bank, and naturally he knew many of  its employees as well as the officials. With his back to the general  waiting room, he sat at the vice president's desk discussing some minor  matter. Only a railing divided the vice president's enclosure from the  long settee on which waiting customers of the bank were seated.    Ned knew that there were two men directly behind him, whispering  together; but he paid no attention to them until he heard this phrase:    \"It's time to explode in just five hours; then good-night to that  invention, whatever it is.\"    This statement might mean almost anything--or nothing.  Ordinarily Ned  Newton might not have paid any consideration to the words. But  \"invention\" was a term that he could not overlook. His mind then was  fixed upon Tom's invention almost as closely as the mind of the young  inventor himself.    Ned turned around slowly, as though idly, indeed, and tried to see the  faces of the two men behind him. One was a small, neatly dressed man of  professional appearance. He wore a Vandyke beard and eyeglasses. The  other's face Ned could not see; but as they both rose just then and  strolled toward the door of the bank he could observe that the fellow  was big and burly.    Ned wheeled to his friend, the vice president, and asked:    \"Who are those men, Mr. Stanley? Do you know them?\"    The pair were just going out through the revolving door. The vice  president craned his neck for a look at them.    \"Don't know the small man, Ned. But the other is named O'Malley, I  believe. Somebody introduced him here and he gets a check cashed  occasionally. Not a customer of the bank.\"    At that moment the name \"O'Malley\" did not mean anything to Ned Newton.  But he bade his friend good-bye and went out after the two men. They  had disappeared.    Rad was in the electric runabout, waiting for him. The words spoken by  O'Malley (Ned thought it must have been he who spoke of the invention  because of his deep voice) continued to disturb Ned's thought.    \"Rad,\" he said, as he got into the runabout, \"did you ever hear the  name O'Malley?\"    \"Sure has,\" declared the colored man. \"And it's a bad name and a bad  man owns it.\"    \"Do you mean that?\" exclaimed the financial manager of the Swift  Construction Company, with increasing apprehension. \"Who is he?\"    \"Why, Mr. Newton, don't you 'member dat man?\"    \"Who is he?\" repeated Ned.    \"Dat Andy O'Malley is de one what tried to hold up Massa Tom dat time.  O'Malley is de man what's been spyin' on Massa Tom--\"    \"Great grief!\" exclaimed Ned, breaking in with excitement.  \"I'll drive  as fast as I can, Rad. There is something wrong at the works, I do  believe!\"    \"What's wrong, Mr. Ned?\" demanded Rad. \"We just come from dere, and  everyt'ing was all right.\"    \"I just heard something that O'Malley said. I want to get back in a  hurry. I believe that scoundrel is attempting to blow up Tom's  locomotive. We've got to get to the works just as quick as we can.\"          Chapter XI    Touch and Go      The mechanical equipment of the new locomotive was now complete and Tom  was establishing the electrical equipment as rapidly as possible. He  not only acted as overseer of this work, but in overalls and jumper he  was doing a good share of the work himself.    The weight of the electrical equipment when it was finally set up was  not far from two hundred thousand pounds. Altogether, when the oil,  sand, and water tanks were filled, the great machine would weigh two  hundred and eighty-five tons--a monster indeed!    \"She is going to take a lot of current to run her,\" said Tom to his  father, who was standing by. \"When I come to arrange with the Shopton  Electric Company for power, it's a question if they can give me all I  need. And I must have plenty of current to make sure that my motors  fill the bill.\"    \"As your tests will be made in the daytime, the company should be able  to furnish the power you need,\" rejoined Mr. Swift. \"At night, of  course, when they must furnish so much light as well as power, it might  be difficult for them to give you the proper current.\"    \"Forty-four hundred horsepower is a big demand,\" went on Tom.  \"I've  got to have at least a three-thousand-volt direct-current to feed my  motors. I will soon have to take up the matter with the Electric  Company.\"    The heavy work of setting the electrical parts of the locomotive had  been finished the day previous, and the track-derrick was removed. Tom  was engaged in adjusting the more delicate parts of the equipment and  had merely stepped down from the cab to speak to Mr. Swift.    Now he climbed back into the interior of the great machine which, in a  general way, looked like a box car. An electric locomotive has not much  of the appearance of a steam engine. The machinery is all boxed in and  the entire floor of the locomotive is above even the drivers.    These six pairs of driving wheels were about seventy inches in  diameter, while the diameter of the leading and following truck-wheels  was but half that number of inches.    Mr. Swift had turned away from the locomotive when Tom put his head out  of the door again.    \"Do you hear that, father?\" he demanded in a puzzled tone.    \"Hear what, Tom?\" asked the old inventor, looking up.    \"That ticking sound? I declare, I'd think it was one of those  death-watch beetles had got in here. Sounds like a big watch ticking. I  can't make it out.\"    \"Where is it? What is it?\" repeated Mr. Swift. \"I hear nothing down  here on the floor of the shed.\"    \"Well, it gets me,\" muttered Tom, and disappeared again. In a moment he  called out: \"Say, you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13640"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 821, September 26, 1891 (#11)"],[1,"taped in order to get  as much insulating compound around each splice as possible in the  limited space. The splices should be \"broken\" as much as possible, so as  to avoid having adjoining splices coming over each other. After the  joint has been saturated with insulating compound the wires should have  an outside wrapping of tape to keep them in shape, and then the sleeve  is wiped on and filled. If the insulation resistance of the jointed  telegraph or telephone cable is a quarter of what the cable tested in  the factory, it may be considered that an exceptionally good piece of  work has been done. I have spoken more particularly of fibrous lead  covered cables, as the handling of them includes practically every step  of the work on any other kind of underground cable. In insulating dry  core paper cables a paper sleeve is slipped over the splice, and in  rubber cables the splice is wrapped with rubber tape; all other details  are the same for these as for the fibrous cable.    In the laying of light and power cables every joint, as made, should be  tested for insulation with a Thomson galvanometer, as the insulation  must necessarily be very high, and if one joint or section of cable is  any weaker than another it may be very important in the future to know  it. All tests must be made after the joint has cooled, for while hot its  insulation resistance will be very low.    Tests for copper resistance should also be made to determine if the  splices are electrically perfect; an imperfect splice may cause  considerable trouble. In telegraph and telephone cables the conductors  should be of very soft copper, for in stripping the conductor of  insulation it is very easy to nick the wire, and if of hard drawn copper  open wires will be the result.    All work should be frequently tested for continuity with telephones,  magnetos, or small portable galvanometers. It is only necessary to  ground the conductors at one end and try each wire at the other end. For  this sort of work a telephone receiver used with one cell of some dry  battery is most convenient, and has the additional advantage of  affording a means of communication while testing, and is by far the best  thing for identifying and tagging conductors.    These cables should be frequently tested during the progress of the work  for grounds and crosses with a Thomson instrument, and when the cable is  complete, a careful series of tests of the capacity, insulation  resistance, and copper resistance of each wire should be made and the  exact condition of the cable determined before it is put in service, and  thereafter an intelligent oversight of the condition of the circuits  can thus be more readily maintained.    Where a company has extensive underground service, a regular cable gang  should be in its employ, for quick and safe handling of cables demands  the employment of men accustomed to the work. If the cable has been  properly laid and tests show it to be in good condition before current  is turned on, almost the only trouble to be anticipated will be due to  mechanical injury. Disruptive discharge, puncturing the lead, may occur;  but the small chance of its occurring can be greatly lessened by the use  of some kind of \"cable protector,\" which will provide for the spark an  artificial path of less resistance than the dielectric of the condenser,  which the cable in fact becomes.    If a fault suddenly develops on a circuit, the chances are it will be  found in a manhole, and an inspection of the cable in the manhole will  generally reveal the trouble without resorting to locating with a  Wheatstone bridge. The cable is often cut through at the edge of the  duct, or damaged by something falling on it, or by some one \"walking all  over it.\" To guard against these, the ducts should always be fitted with  protectors both above and below the cable. The cables should never be  left across the manholes, for they then answer the purpose of a ladder,  but should be bent, around the walls of the hole and securely fastened  with lead straps, that they may not be moved and the lead gradually worn  through.    In telegraph cables, when one or two conductors \"go,\" it will probably  be useless to look for trouble except with instruments; but if several  wires are \"lost\" at once it will probably be found to be caused by  mechanical injury, which can be located by inspection. If it is ever  necessary to loop out conductors, a joint can be readily opened and the  conductors wanted picked out and connected into the branch cable and the  joint again closed without disturbing the working wires. In doing this a  split sleeve must be used, and the only additional precaution to be  taken is in filling the sleeve to have the insulating compound not hot  enough to melt the solder and open up the split in the sleeve. In  cutting in service on light and power cables it is entirely practicable  to do so without interruption of service on multiple arc circuits, even  those of very high voltage; but they require great precaution and  involve considerable risk to the jointer, and where possible the circuit  to which the connection is to be made should previously be cut dead.  Where the voltage is not dangerous to human life, almost any service  connection can be made without interruption of service.    I have only indicated a very few of the operations that may be found  necessary, and the probable causes of troubles that may be encountered  in the operating of underground circuits, believing that the different  problems that arise can, with a little experience, be successfully met  by any one who has a fair knowledge of the original construction of  cable lines.--_Electrical World_.           *       *       *       *       *          RAILROADS TO THE CLOUDS.      If George Stephenson, when he placed the first locomotive on the track  and guaranteed it a speed of six miles an hour, could have foreseen that  in less than eighty years the successors of his rude machine would be  climbing the sides of mountain ranges, piercing gorges hitherto deemed  inaccessible, crossing ravines on bridges higher than the dome of St.  Paul's, and traversing the bowels of the earth by means of tunnels, no  doubt his big blue eyes would have stood out with wonder and amazement.  But he foresaw nothing of the kind; the only problem present in his mind  was how to get goods from the seaports in western England to London as  easily and cheaply as possible, and to do this he substituted for  horses, which had for 150 years been drawing cars along wooden or iron  tracks, the wonderful machine which has revolutionized the freight and  passenger traffic of the world.    It was, indeed, impossible for any one to foresee the triumphs of  engineering which have accompanied the advances in transportation. To  the engineer of the present day there are no impossibilities. The  engineer is a wizard at whose command space and matter are annihilated.  The highest mountain, the deepest valley, has no terrors for him. He can  bridge the latter and encircle or tunnel the former. The only requisites  which he demands are that something in his line be needed, and that the  money is forthcoming to defray the expense, and the thing will be done.  But the railroad he is asked to construct must be necessary, and the  necessity must be plainly shown, or no funds will be advanced; and  although the theory does not invariably hold good, especially when a  craze for railroad building is raging, as a rule no expense for the  construction of a road will be incurred without a prospect of  remuneration.    Hence the need of railroad communication has caused lines to be  constructed through districts where only a few years ago the thing would  have been deemed impossible. The Pacific roads of this country were a  necessity long before their construction, and in the face of  difficulties almost insuperable were carried to successful completion.  So, also, of the railroads in the Andes of South America. The famous  road from Callao through the heart of Peru is one of the highest  mountain roads in the world, as well as of the most difficult  construction. The grades are often of 300 feet and more to the mile, and  when the mountains were reached so great were the difficulties the  engineers were forced to confront that in some places laborers were  lowered from cliffs by ropes in order that, with toil and difficulty,  they might carve a foothold in order to begin the cutting for the  roadway.    In some sections tunnels are more numerous than open cuts, and so far as  the road has gone sixty-one tunnels, great and small, have been  constructed, aggregating over 20,000 feet in length. The road attains a  height of 15,000 feet above the level of the sea, and at the highest  point of the track is about as high as the topmost peak of Mont Blanc.  It pierces the range above it by a tunnel 3,847 feet long. The stern  necessities of business compelled the construction of this road,  otherwise it never would have been begun.    The tunnels of the Andes, however, do not bear comparison with the  tunnels, bridges, and snow sheds of the Union Pacific, nor do even these  compare with the vast undertakings in the Alps--three great tunnels of  nine to eleven miles in length, which have been prepared for the  transit of travelers and freight. The requirements of business  necessitated the piercing of the Alps, and as soon as the necessity was  shown, funds in abundance were forthcoming for the enterprise.    But tunneling a mountain is a different thing from climbing it. Many  years ago the attention of inventors was directed to the practicability  of constructing a railroad up the side of a mountain on grades which, to  an ordinary engine, were quite impossible. The improvements in  locomotives twenty-five and thirty years ago rendered them capable of  climbing grades which, in the early days of railroad engineering, were  deemed out of"]]]
