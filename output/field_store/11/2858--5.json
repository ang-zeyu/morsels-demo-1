It would  appear that, at some moment in a vacuous eternity, He calls matter out  of nothing, whirls it into fiery vortices, and then lets it cool down to  the absolute zero wherein death reigns for ever.    [Sidenote: The Protest of Faith.]    [Sidenote: Sustained by Latest Science.]    [Sidenote: Which Suggests an Infinite Unity.]    But, after all, \"there is a spirit in man,\" and \"the inspiration of the  Almighty,\" of the Eternal, of the glorious Whole to which we belong,  stirs in us a protest against this blasphemy of ignorance. Ignorance, I  say, for it was not the knowledge of our wise men that whispered such  things, but their sense of the vacuity beyond their knowledge. Up to  certain bounds, their grasp of facts, their insight into physical order,  their mathematical skill, were beyond all praise. But beyond that bound,  aye, and within it, in every inconceivable mode of the action of force,  as, for example, in gravitation, brooded the Unknowable. And it was not  their knowledge, but their ignorance that entailed absurd issues.  Already there are signs that even celestial physics and mathematics will  refuse to endorse as final so revolting a scheme of material evolution  and devolution, ending only in universal death.[23] And when once the  re-birth of new order out of the old is seen to be everywhere and  eternally taking place, then all the hints given us by science of the  ultimate oneness of all things, converge in the faith that All is God,  and God is All. For certainly, the latest observations on Matter suggest  that all forms of it are variations of one ultimate Substance. And the  convertibility of forces, as well as the conservation of force, point to  one eternal energy. Nor is the duality thus suggested any final  conclusion. For few, I imagine, would now contend that, in the last  result Matter and Force are fundamentally different things. In fact,  Monism holds the field; and though the evolution of human opinion is  very slow, it appears safe to predict that the triumph of that world  theory is assured.    [Sidenote: Idea of Creation Incongruous with Modern Knowledge.]    This result Is additionally secured by the increasing incongruity felt  between the immeasurable vastness of the Universe, even as known, and  the idea of creation out of nothing. When the Almighty could be  seriously pictured as constructing chambers for Himself and His heavenly  host above, the middle floor of earth for the children of men, and the  abyss for ghosts and devils, the notion that His word evoked that puny  structure from nothing might be invested by poets and prophets with a  certain grandeur. Each part of the work had an object as conceivable as  that of each floor in a house; and, according to petty human notions of  utility, nothing was wasted. But now, when our astronomers confront us  with countless millions of orbs, to whose extension In space no bound  can be proved, while some of them tell us that the whole immensity is a  desert of alternate fire and darkness, with no spark of finite intellect  except in our tiny earth, some of us, at least, cannot help feeling that  the notion of a personal divine worker calling this huge enigma out of  blank eternal nothing, is enormously and utterly incongruous both with  reverence and common sense.    And if the Pantheist in these days be asked, \"What interpretation then  do you propose?\" his answer is, \"I propose none. I take things as they  are. In their totality they are unknowable, as, indeed, even science  finds they are in their infinitesimal parts.\" But we need not on this  account lose \"the divinity that shapes our ends.\"    [Sidenote: Pantheistic Morality.]    [Sidenote: The Law of the Whole.]    For, between the infinite and the infinitesimal the human experience  realizes itself in surroundings which, when observed and reflected on,  make the impression of ordered relations of parts. By a necessity of our  finite and individual existence as centres of action--a necessity of  which we can give no account--we present those relations to ourselves in  forms of time and space. Then, when our experience is large enough and  ripe enough, being enriched and stimulated by the stored-up experience  of humanity, as recorded in tradition, custom, Bibles, and Epics, we  attain to the moral sense, and realize that we are bound to be loyal to  something greater than self. That \"greater\" may be the tribe, the  nation, humanity or God. But in far the larger number of cases in which  this sense of willing loyalty is aroused, its cause is the appeal to us  of some whole of which we form a part. Certainly this is so with the  patriot and the philanthropist. Indeed, it would be difficult, or  impossible, to find any human relationship, from the family upwards,  through the wider circles of school, club, municipality, nationality, in  which this sense of loyalty or devotion to the law of the whole is not  the best incentive to devotion.    [Sidenote: Of that Law of the Whole Loyalty to God in the Supreme  Application.]    Yet, when we come to contemplate the final and supreme object of  devotion, the Eternal Himself, it has been almost the universal custom  to make a surprising exception, and to regard religion as maintainable  only by recognition of a tremendous outward authority, to which only  such loyalty is possible as in barbarous times was fostered towards a  personal chieftain, or feudal king. Now Pantheism holds this to be an  error, and regards obedience and devotion to God as the ultimate and  most inspiring application of that principle of the loyalty of the part  to the whole which runs through all morality.    [Sidenote: Conclusion.]    Why should we be supposed to be without God because we acknowledge Him  to be superpersonal, and \"past finding out\"? Or why should we be  suspected of denying the divinity of evolution because we do not  believe the Eternal All to be subject to it? This instinct of loyalty,  in the sense of self-subordination to any greater Whole of which we are  part, the distinction of right and wrong thence arising, and the  aspiration after a moral ideal, are not of man's invention. Speaking, as  we cannot help doing, in terms of time, I hold that the germs of this  higher creature-life were always in the divine unity out of which man is  evolved. And in pursuing the inspirations of that higher life, as  experience suggests them, humanity has always had a guide and a saviour  in the Living God, of whom the race life-time of man is an infinitesimal  phase. In such an interpretation of man's relations to God there is  nothing necessarily hostile to any form of genuine religion.[24] True,  there are in the creeds many statements which we cannot accept in the  letter. But there are few which have not some spiritual suggestion for  us. And if we can attain to that intellectual love of God in which  Spinoza was absorbed, we have no quarrel with any mode of sincere  devotion. Pious Catholic, Protestant, Vedantist, Mohammedan--all, by  the implicit, though unrecognised necessities of their faith, worship  the same God as ourselves. But the wrangles of sectarian zeal no longer  concern us: for we have passed      \"To where beyond those voices there is peace.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 22: Quoted by Dr. J.

During the early part of the night he was all right, but later it  occurred to him that he might be seen and killed by the ladrones,  who often passed that way.    Below the bridge was a raft of bamboo poles, and he thought it would  be wise to get down there, where he could not so easily be seen. But  there were many mosquitoes over the water, so that he was unable to  sleep. He determined, however, to stay there until day dawned.    At about four o'clock he heard a heavy step upon the floor of the  bridge, and by the moonlight he could see that the new-comer was a  huge giant with a long club.    A little later another giant came, and Tanag, full of fear, heard  the following dialogue:--    \"Did you kill many people?\"    \"Yes, I put my poison on the food, and in a short time those who ate  of it were attacked by the cholera and died. And how are you getting  along yourself?\"    \"At first I killed many people with my poison, but now I am  disappointed, because they have found out the antidote for it.\"    \"What is that?\"    \"The root of the balingay tree boiled in water. It is a powerful  antidote against the poison I use. And what is the antidote against  yours?\"    \"Simply the root of the alibutbut tree boiled in water. Luckily,  no one has discovered this antidote, and so many people will die.\"    In the morning Tanag saw the giants going to the shore, where many  people were fishing with their nets. The giants flung their poison  on the fish, and then disappeared from Tanag's sight.    Tanag believed that the cholera was caused by the two giants, who  poisoned the food and water by sprinkling poison on them, and he did  not doubt that the roots of the balingay and alibutbut trees would  prove to be the antidotes to the poison. So he gathered the roots  and cooked them and advertised himself as a doctor.    In fact he cured many people and earned so much money that he soon  became rich.      CHAPTER 19    Masoy and the Ape. [6]    Masoy was a poor man who lived on a farm some miles from the town. His  clothing was very poor, and his little garden furnished him scarcely  enough to live on. Every week day he went to town to sell his fruits  and vegetables and to buy rice. Upon his return he noticed each day  that some one had entered the garden in his absence and stolen some  of the fruit. He tried to protect the garden by making the fence  very strong and locking the gate; but, in spite of all he could do,  he continued to miss his fruit.    At length Masoy conceived the happy idea of taking some pitch and  moulding it into the shape of a man. He put a bamboo hat on it and  stood it up in one comer of the garden. Then he went away.    As soon as he was gone, the robber, who was none other than a huge ape,  climbed the fence and got in.    \"Oh!\" he said to himself, \"I made a mistake! There is Masoy  watching. He did not go away as I thought. He is here with a big bamboo  hat, but he could not catch me if he tried. I am going to greet him,  for fear he may consider me impolite.\"    \"Good morning, Masoy,\" he said. \"Why do you not answer me? What  is the matter with you? Oh! you are joking, are you, by keeping  so silent? But you will not do it again.\" On saying this, the ape  slapped the man of pitch with his right hand, and of course it stuck,  and he could not get it loose.    \"For heaven's sake,\" cried the ape, \"let me go. If you do not, I will  slap you with my other hand.\" Then he struck him with the other hand,  which, of course, stuck fast also.    \"Well, Masoy,\" cried the ape, \"you have entirely exhausted my  patience! If you don't let go of me at once, I shall kick you.\" No  sooner said than done, with a result which may easily be imagined.    \"Masoy,\" cried the now enraged ape, \"if you have any regard for your  own welfare, let me go, for if you don't, I still have one leg left  to kill you with.\" So saying, he kicked him with the remaining foot,  getting so tangled up that he and the tar man fell to the ground,  rolling over and over.    Then Masoy came, and, when he saw the ape, he said: \"So you are  the robber who has stolen my fruit! Now you will pay for it with  your life.\"    But the ape cried, \"Oh, spare my life, and I will be your slave  forever!\"    \"Do you promise not to steal my fruit again?\"    \"I do, and I will serve you faithfully all my life.\"    Masoy agreed to spare him.    From that time on the ape worked very hard for his master. He sold  the fruit and bought the rice and was honest and industrious. One  day, on his way to market, he happened to find a small piece of gold  and another of silver. At that time this country was not ruled by  any foreign power, but each tribe was governed by its own datto or  chief. The chief was naturally the bravest and richest of the tribe.    The chief of Masoy's tribe had a very beautiful daughter. The ape  schemed to have her marry his master. Now he hit upon a plan. He  went to the chief's house and asked for a ganta, which is a measure  holding about three quarts and used for measuring rice.    \"My master,\" he said, \"begs you to lend him a ganta to measure his  gold with.\"    The chief was astonished at such an extraordinary request, and asked:  \"Who is your master?\"    \"Masoy, who owns many gantas of gold and silver, acres upon acres of  land; and uncountable heads of cattle,\" was the reply.    The ape carried the ganta home, and there he stuck the piece of gold  he had found on the inside of the bottom of the measure, and then  returned it to the chief.    \"Oh, ape!\" said the datto, \"your master has forgotten to take out  one piece of gold. Take it and give it back to him.\"    \"Never mind, sir,\" answered the ape, \"he has so much gold that that  small piece is nothing to him. You may keep it.\"    Some weeks afterward, the ape went again to borrow the chief's ganta.    \"What do you want it for now?\" asked the chief.    \"To measure my master's silver with,\" was the answer. So he carried  it home, stuck inside the piece of silver he had found, and returned  it. The chief found the piece of silver and offered to return it,  but was answered as before, that it did not matter.    The chief believed all that the ape said, but was puzzled to know how  such a rich man could be living in his territory without his having  heard of him.    After a few days the ape, considering the way well prepared for his  plans, called upon the datto and said: \"My master requests you to  give him your daughter in marriage. I am authorized to make all the  arrangements with you for the wedding, if you consent to it.\"    \"Very well,\" answered the chief, \"but before we arrange matters I  wish to see my future son-in-law. Ask him to come to see me, and I  will receive him in a manner befitting his rank.\"    The ape returned home and said to Masoy, who knew nothing at all of  the negotiations with the chief: \"I have good news for you. The chief  wants to see you, for he intends to give you his daughter in marriage.\"    \"What are you chattering about?\" answered Masoy. \"Have you lost  your senses? Don't you know that I am too poor to marry the chief's  daughter? I have not even decent clothes to wear and no means of  getting any.\"    \"Do not worry about the clothes. I will get them for you somewhere,\"  replied the ape.    \"And how shall I talk? You know that I am ignorant of city ways.\"    \"Oh, Masoy, don't trouble about that! Just answer 'Yes' to the  questions they ask you and you will be all right.\"    Finally Masoy consented to go, and went down to the river to wash  off the dirt and grime. A rich merchant was bathing some distance up  the river, and the ape slipped along the bank, stole the merchant's  clothes, hat, and shoes, and running back swiftly to his master,  bade him put them on. Masoy did so, and found himself, for the first  time in his life, so well dressed that he no longer hesitated about  going to the chief's house. When they arrived there they found that  the chief was expecting them and had made a big feast and reception  in honor of his future son-in-law. The chief began to talk about the  wedding and said:    \"Shall we have the wedding in your palace, Masoy?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Masoy.    \"You have a large palace, I suppose, have n't you, sir?\"    \"Yes,\" was the reply.    \"Don't you think it would be well for us to go there this afternoon?\"    \"Yes,\" was again the reply.    Meanwhile the ape had disappeared. He went along the road towards home  and said to all the people he met: \"The datto will be along this way  pretty soon and when he asks you to whom all these farms and cattle  belong, you must say that they are Masoy's, for otherwise he will  kill you.\"    The ape knew that in a certain spot stood an enchanted palace invisible  to men. He went to the place, and just where the front of the house  appeared whenever it was visible, he began to dig a ditch. The witch  who lived in the house appeared and asked: \"What are you ditching  there for, Mr. Ape?\"    \"Oh, madam,\" was his answer, \"have n't you heard the news? The chief  is coming this way soon, and is going to have all witches and the  low animals like myself put to death. For this reason I am digging  a pit to hide myself in.\"    \"Oh, Mr. Ape!\" said the witch, \"let me hide myself first, for I am  not able to dig for myself, and you are. Do me this favor, please.\"    \"I should be very impolite, if I refused to do a favor for a lady,\"  said the ape. \"Come down, but hurry, or you will be too late.\"    The witch hurried as fast as she could and got down into the pit. Then  the ape threw stones down on her until she was dead. The house then  became free from enchantment and always visible.    The ape then returned to the chief's house and reported that all was  ready for the wedding. So the chief, Masoy, and the bride, escorted  by a large number of people, set out for Masoy's"]]]
