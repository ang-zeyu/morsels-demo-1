Behold thy sire and I  Sorrowing have sought thee;\" and so held her peace,  And straight the vision fled.  A female next  Appear'd before me, down whose visage cours'd  Those waters, that grief forces out from one  By deep resentment stung, who seem'd to say:  \"If thou, Pisistratus, be lord indeed  Over this city, nam'd with such debate  Of adverse gods, and whence each science sparkles,  Avenge thee of those arms, whose bold embrace  Hath clasp'd our daughter; \"and to fuel, meseem'd,  Benign and meek, with visage undisturb'd,  Her sovran spake: \"How shall we those requite,  Who wish us evil, if we thus condemn  The man that loves us?\"  After that I saw  A multitude, in fury burning, slay  With stones a stripling youth, and shout amain  \"Destroy, destroy:\" and him I saw, who bow'd  Heavy with death unto the ground, yet made  His eyes, unfolded upward, gates to heav'n,    Praying forgiveness of th' Almighty Sire,  Amidst that cruel conflict, on his foes,  With looks, that With compassion to their aim.    Soon as my spirit, from her airy flight  Returning, sought again the things, whose truth  Depends not on her shaping, I observ'd  How she had rov'd to no unreal scenes    Meanwhile the leader, who might see I mov'd,  As one, who struggles to shake off his sleep,  Exclaim'd: \"What ails thee, that thou canst not hold  Thy footing firm, but more than half a league  Hast travel'd with clos'd eyes and tott'ring gait,  Like to a man by wine or sleep o'ercharg'd?\"    \"Beloved father! so thou deign,\" said I,  \"To listen, I will tell thee what appear'd  Before me, when so fail'd my sinking steps.\"    He thus: \"Not if thy Countenance were mask'd  With hundred vizards, could a thought of thine  How small soe'er, elude me.  What thou saw'st  Was shown, that freely thou mightst ope thy heart  To the waters of peace, that flow diffus'd  From their eternal fountain.  I not ask'd,  What ails theeor such cause as he doth, who  Looks only with that eye which sees no more,  When spiritless the body lies; but ask'd,  To give fresh vigour to thy foot.  Such goads  The slow and loit'ring need; that they be found  Not wanting, when their hour of watch returns.\"    So on we journey'd through the evening sky  Gazing intent, far onward, as our eyes  With level view could stretch against the bright  Vespertine ray: and lo! by slow degrees  Gath'ring, a fog made tow'rds us, dark as night.  There was no room for 'scaping; and that mist  Bereft us, both of sight and the pure air.          CANTO XVI    Hell's dunnest gloom, or night unlustrous, dark,  Of every planes 'reft, and pall'd in clouds,  Did never spread before the sight a veil  In thickness like that fog, nor to the sense  So palpable and gross.  Ent'ring its shade,  Mine eye endured not with unclosed lids;  Which marking, near me drew the faithful guide,  Offering me his shoulder for a stay.    As the blind man behind his leader walks,  Lest he should err, or stumble unawares  On what might harm him, or perhaps destroy,  I journey'd through that bitter air and foul,  Still list'ning to my escort's warning voice,  \"Look that from me thou part not.\"  Straight I heard  Voices, and each one seem'd to pray for peace,  And for compassion, to the Lamb of God  That taketh sins away.  Their prelude still  Was \"Agnus Dei,\" and through all the choir,  One voice, one measure ran, that perfect seem'd  The concord of their song.  \"Are these I hear  Spirits, O master?\"  I exclaim'd; and he:  \"Thou aim'st aright: these loose the bonds of wrath.\"    \"Now who art thou, that through our smoke dost cleave?  And speak'st of us, as thou thyself e'en yet  Dividest time by calends?\"  So one voice  Bespake me; whence my master said: \"Reply;  And ask, if upward hence the passage lead.\"    \"O being! who dost make thee pure, to stand  Beautiful once more in thy Maker's sight!  Along with me: and thou shalt hear and wonder.\"  Thus I, whereto the spirit answering spake:    \"Long as 't is lawful for me, shall my steps  Follow on thine; and since the cloudy smoke  Forbids the seeing, hearing in its stead  Shall keep us join'd.\"  I then forthwith began  \"Yet in my mortal swathing, I ascend  To higher regions, and am hither come  Through the fearful agony of hell.  And, if so largely God hath doled his grace,  That, clean beside all modern precedent,  He wills me to behold his kingly state,  From me conceal not who thou wast, ere death  Had loos'd thee; but instruct me: and instruct  If rightly to the pass I tend; thy words  The way directing as a safe escort.\"    \"I was of Lombardy, and Marco call'd:  Not inexperienc'd of the world, that worth  I still affected, from which all have turn'd  The nerveless bow aside.  Thy course tends right  Unto the summit:\" and, replying thus,  He added, \"I beseech thee pray for me,  When thou shalt come aloft.\"  And I to him:  \"Accept my faith for pledge I will perform  What thou requirest.  Yet one doubt remains,  That wrings me sorely, if I solve it not,  Singly before it urg'd me, doubled now  By thine opinion, when I couple that  With one elsewhere declar'd, each strength'ning other.  The world indeed is even so forlorn  Of all good as thou speak'st it and so swarms  With every evil.  Yet, beseech thee, point  The cause out to me, that myself may see,  And unto others show it: for in heaven  One places it, and one on earth below.\"    Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh,  \"Brother!\" he thus began, \"the world is blind;  And thou in truth com'st from it.  Ye, who live,  Do so each cause refer to heav'n above,  E'en as its motion of necessity  Drew with it all that moves.  If this were so,  Free choice in you were none; nor justice would  There should be joy for virtue, woe for ill.  Your movements have their primal bent from heaven;  Not all; yet said I all; what then ensues?  Light have ye still to follow evil or good,  And of the will free power, which, if it stand  Firm and unwearied in Heav'n's first assay,  Conquers at last, so it be cherish'd well,  Triumphant over all.  To mightier force,  To better nature subject, ye abide  Free, not constrain'd by that, which forms in you  The reasoning mind uninfluenc'd of the stars.  If then the present race of mankind err,  Seek in yourselves the cause, and find it there.  Herein thou shalt confess me no false spy.    \"Forth from his plastic hand, who charm'd beholds  Her image ere she yet exist, the soul  Comes like a babe, that wantons sportively  Weeping and laughing in its wayward moods,  As artless and as ignorant of aught,  Save that her Maker being one who dwells  With gladness ever, willingly she turns  To whate'er yields her joy.  Of some slight good  The flavour soon she tastes; and, snar'd by that,  With fondness she pursues it, if no guide  Recall, no rein direct her wand'ring course.  Hence it behov'd, the law should be a curb;  A sovereign hence behov'd, whose piercing view  Might mark at least the fortress and main tower  Of the true city.  Laws indeed there are:  But who is he observes them?  None; not he,  Who goes before, the shepherd of the flock,  Who chews the cud but doth not cleave the hoof.  Therefore the multitude, who see their guide  Strike at the very good they covet most,  Feed there and look no further.  Thus the cause  Is not corrupted nature in yourselves,  But ill-conducting, that hath turn'd the world  To evil.  Rome, that turn'd it unto good,  Was wont to boast two suns, whose several beams  Cast light on either way, the world's and God's.  One since hath quench'd the other; and the sword  Is grafted on the crook; and so conjoin'd  Each must perforce decline to worse, unaw'd  By fear of other.  If thou doubt me, mark  The blade: each herb is judg'd of by its seed.  That land, through which Adice and the Po  Their waters roll, was once the residence  Of courtesy and velour, ere the day,  That frown'd on Frederick; now secure may pass  Those limits, whosoe'er hath left, for shame,  To talk with good men, or come near their haunts.  Three aged ones are still found there, in whom  The old time chides the new: these deem it long  Ere God restore them to a better world:  The good Gherardo, of Palazzo he  Conrad, and Guido of Castello, nam'd  In Gallic phrase more fitly the plain Lombard.  On this at last conclude.  The church of Rome,  Mixing two governments that ill assort,  Hath miss'd her footing, fall'n into the mire,  And there herself and burden much defil'd.\"    \"O Marco!\" I replied, shine arguments  Convince me: and the cause I now discern  Why of the heritage no portion came  To Levi's offspring.  But resolve me this  Who that Gherardo is, that as thou sayst  Is left a sample of the perish'd race,  And for rebuke to this untoward age?\"    \"Either thy words,\" said he, \"deceive; or else  Are meant to try me; that thou, speaking Tuscan,  Appear'st not to have heard of good Gherado;  The sole addition that, by which I know him;  Unless I borrow'd from his daughter Gaia  Another name to grace him.  God be with you.  I bear you company no more.  Behold  The dawn with white ray glimm'ring through the mist.  I must away--the angel comes--ere he  Appear.\"  He said, and would not hear me more.          CANTO XVII    Call to remembrance, reader, if thou e'er  Hast, on a mountain top, been ta'en by cloud,  Through which thou saw'st no better, than the mole  Doth through opacous membrane; then, whene'er  The wat'ry vapours dense began to melt  Into thin air, how faintly the sun's sphere  Seem'd wading through them; so thy nimble thought  May image, how at first I re-beheld  The sun, that bedward now his couch o'erhung.    Thus with my leader's feet still equaling pace  From forth that cloud I came, when now expir'd  The parting beams from off the nether shores.    O quick and forgetive power! that sometimes dost  So"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8800"],[0,"An Index of The Divine Comedy (#10)"],[1,"ye well discern,  With unlike wings are fledge.  A mortal I  Experience inequality like this,  And therefore give no thanks, but in the heart,  For thy paternal greeting.  This howe'er  I pray thee, living topaz! that ingemm'st  This precious jewel, let me hear thy name.\"    \"I am thy root, O leaf! whom to expect  Even, hath pleas'd me:\" thus the prompt reply  Prefacing, next it added; \"he, of whom  Thy kindred appellation comes, and who,  These hundred years and more, on its first ledge  Hath circuited the mountain, was my son  And thy great grandsire.  Well befits, his long  Endurance should be shorten'd by thy deeds.    \"Florence, within her ancient limit-mark,  Which calls her still to matin prayers and noon,  Was chaste and sober, and abode in peace.  She had no armlets and no head-tires then,  No purfled dames, no zone, that caught the eye  More than the person did.  Time was not yet,  When at his daughter's birth the sire grew pale.  For fear the age and dowry should exceed  On each side just proportion.  House was none  Void of its family; nor yet had come  Hardanapalus, to exhibit feats  Of chamber prowess.  Montemalo yet  O'er our suburban turret rose; as much  To be surpass in fall, as in its rising.  I saw Bellincione Berti walk abroad  In leathern girdle and a clasp of bone;  And, with no artful colouring on her cheeks,  His lady leave the glass.  The sons I saw  Of Nerli and of Vecchio well content  With unrob'd jerkin; and their good dames handling  The spindle and the flax; O happy they!  Each sure of burial in her native land,  And none left desolate a-bed for France!  One wak'd to tend the cradle, hushing it  With sounds that lull'd the parent's infancy:  Another, with her maidens, drawing off  The tresses from the distaff, lectur'd them  Old tales of Troy and Fesole and Rome.  A Salterello and Cianghella we  Had held as strange a marvel, as ye would  A Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.    \"In such compos'd and seemly fellowship,  Such faithful and such fair equality,  In so sweet household, Mary at my birth  Bestow'd me, call'd on with loud cries; and there  In your old baptistery, I was made  Christian at once and Cacciaguida; as were  My brethren, Eliseo and Moronto.    \"From Valdipado came to me my spouse,  And hence thy surname grew.  I follow'd then  The Emperor Conrad; and his knighthood he  Did gird on me; in such good part he took  My valiant service.  After him I went  To testify against that evil law,  Whose people, by the shepherd's fault, possess  Your right, usurping.  There, by that foul crew  Was I releas'd from the deceitful world,  Whose base affection many a spirit soils,  And from the martyrdom came to this peace.\"          CANTO XVI    O slight respect of man's nobility!  I never shall account it marvelous,  That our infirm affection here below  Thou mov'st to boasting, when I could not choose,  E'en in that region of unwarp'd desire,  In heav'n itself, but make my vaunt in thee!  Yet cloak thou art soon shorten'd, for that time,  Unless thou be eked out from day to day,  Goes round thee with his shears.  Resuming then  With greeting such, as Rome, was first to bear,  But since hath disaccustom'd I began;  And Beatrice, that a little space  Was sever'd, smil'd reminding me of her,  Whose cough embolden'd (as the story holds)  To first offence the doubting Guenever.    \"You are my sire,\" said I, \"you give me heart  Freely to speak my thought: above myself  You raise me.  Through so many streams with joy  My soul is fill'd, that gladness wells from it;  So that it bears the mighty tide, and bursts not  Say then, my honour'd stem! what ancestors  Where those you sprang from, and what years were mark'd  In your first childhood?  Tell me of the fold,  That hath Saint John for guardian, what was then  Its state, and who in it were highest seated?\"    As embers, at the breathing of the wind,  Their flame enliven, so that light I saw  Shine at my blandishments; and, as it grew  More fair to look on, so with voice more sweet,  Yet not in this our modern phrase, forthwith  It answer'd: \"From the day, when it was said  'Hail Virgin!' to the throes, by which my mother,  Who now is sainted, lighten'd her of me  Whom she was heavy with, this fire had come,  Five hundred fifty times and thrice, its beams  To reilumine underneath the foot  Of its own lion.  They, of whom I sprang,  And I, had there our birth-place, where the last  Partition of our city first is reach'd  By him, that runs her annual game.  Thus much  Suffice of my forefathers: who they were,  And whence they hither came, more honourable  It is to pass in silence than to tell.  All those, who in that time were there from Mars  Until the Baptist, fit to carry arms,  Were but the fifth of them this day alive.  But then the citizen's blood, that now is mix'd  From Campi and Certaldo and Fighine,  Ran purely through the last mechanic's veins.  O how much better were it, that these people  Were neighbours to you, and that at Galluzzo  And at Trespiano, ye should have your bound'ry,  Than to have them within, and bear the stench  Of Aguglione's hind, and Signa's, him,  That hath his eye already keen for bart'ring!  Had not the people, which of all the world  Degenerates most, been stepdame unto Caesar,  But, as a mother, gracious to her son;  Such one, as hath become a Florentine,  And trades and traffics, had been turn'd adrift  To Simifonte, where his grandsire ply'd  The beggar's craft.  The Conti were possess'd  Of Montemurlo still: the Cerchi still  Were in Acone's parish; nor had haply  From Valdigrieve past the Buondelmonte.  The city's malady hath ever source  In the confusion of its persons, as  The body's, in variety of food:  And the blind bull falls with a steeper plunge,  Than the blind lamb; and oftentimes one sword  Doth more and better execution,  Than five.  Mark Luni, Urbisaglia mark,  How they are gone, and after them how go  Chiusi and Sinigaglia; and 't will seem  No longer new or strange to thee to hear,  That families fail, when cities have their end.  All things, that appertain t' ye, like yourselves,  Are mortal: but mortality in some  Ye mark not, they endure so long, and you  Pass by so suddenly.  And as the moon  Doth, by the rolling of her heav'nly sphere,  Hide and reveal the strand unceasingly;  So fortune deals with Florence.  Hence admire not  At what of them I tell thee, whose renown  Time covers, the first Florentines.  I saw  The Ughi, Catilini and Filippi,  The Alberichi, Greci and Ormanni,  Now in their wane, illustrious citizens:  And great as ancient, of Sannella him,  With him of Arca saw, and Soldanieri  And Ardinghi, and Bostichi.  At the poop,  That now is laden with new felony,  So cumb'rous it may speedily sink the bark,  The Ravignani sat, of whom is sprung  The County Guido, and whoso hath since  His title from the fam'd Bellincione ta'en.  Fair governance was yet an art well priz'd  By him of Pressa: Galigaio show'd  The gilded hilt and pommel, in his house.  The column, cloth'd with verrey, still was seen  Unshaken: the Sacchetti still were great,  Giouchi, Sifanti, Galli and Barucci,  With them who blush to hear the bushel nam'd.  Of the Calfucci still the branchy trunk  Was in its strength: and to the curule chairs  Sizii and Arigucci yet were drawn.  How mighty them I saw, whom since their pride  Hath undone! and in all her goodly deeds  Florence was by the bullets of bright gold  O'erflourish'd.  Such the sires of those, who now,  As surely as your church is vacant, flock  Into her consistory, and at leisure  There stall them and grow fat.  The o'erweening brood,  That plays the dragon after him that flees,  But unto such, as turn and show the tooth,  Ay or the purse, is gentle as a lamb,  Was on its rise, but yet so slight esteem'd,  That Ubertino of Donati grudg'd  His father-in-law should yoke him to its tribe.  Already Caponsacco had descended  Into the mart from Fesole: and Giuda  And Infangato were good citizens.  A thing incredible I tell, tho' true:  The gateway, named from those of Pera, led  Into the narrow circuit of your walls.  Each one, who bears the sightly quarterings  Of the great Baron (he whose name and worth  The festival of Thomas still revives)  His knighthood and his privilege retain'd;  Albeit one, who borders them With gold,  This day is mingled with the common herd.  In Borgo yet the Gualterotti dwelt,  And Importuni: well for its repose  Had it still lack'd of newer neighbourhood.  The house, from whence your tears have had their spring,  Through the just anger that hath murder'd ye  And put a period to your gladsome days,  Was honour'd, it, and those consorted with it.  O Buondelmonte! what ill counseling  Prevail'd on thee to break the plighted bond  Many, who now are weeping, would rejoice,  Had God to Ema giv'n thee, the first time  Thou near our city cam'st.  But so was doom'd:  On that maim'd stone set up to guard the bridge,  At thy last peace, the victim, Florence! fell.  With these and others like to them, I saw  Florence in such assur'd tranquility,  She had no cause at which to grieve: with these  Saw her so glorious and so just, that ne'er  The lily from the lance had hung reverse,  Or through division been with vermeil dyed.\"          CANTO XVII    Such as the youth, who came to Clymene  To certify himself of that reproach,  Which had been fasten'd on him, (he whose end  Still makes the fathers chary to their sons),  E'en such was I; nor unobserv'd was such  Of Beatrice, and that saintly lamp,  Who had erewhile for me his station mov'd;  When thus by lady: \"Give thy wish free vent,  That it may issue, bearing true report  Of the mind's impress; not that aught thy words  May to our knowledge add, but to the end,  That thou mayst use thyself to own thy thirst  And men may mingle for thee when they hear.\"    \"O plant! from whence I spring! rever'd and lov'd!  Who soar'st so high a pitch, thou seest as clear,  As earthly thought determines"]]]
