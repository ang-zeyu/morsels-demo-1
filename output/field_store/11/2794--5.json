In this instance it was the anthropoid that retired in stiff dignity to  inspect an unhappy caterpillar, which he presently devoured.  For a  moment Tarzan seemed inclined to pursue the argument.  He swaggered  truculently, stuck out his chest, roared and advanced closer to the  bull.  It was with difficulty that Werper finally persuaded him to  leave well enough alone and continue his way from the ancient city of  the Sun Worshipers.    The two searched for nearly an hour before they found the narrow exit  through the inner wall.  From there the well-worn trail led them beyond  the outer fortification to the desolate valley of Opar.    Tarzan had no idea, in so far as Werper could discover, as to where he  was or whence he came.  He wandered aimlessly about, searching for  food, which he discovered beneath small rocks, or hiding in the shade  of the scant brush which dotted the ground.    The Belgian was horrified by the hideous menu of his companion.  Beetles, rodents and caterpillars were devoured with seeming relish.  Tarzan was indeed an ape again.    At last Werper succeeded in leading his companion toward the distant  hills which mark the northwestern boundary of the valley, and together  the two set out in the direction of the Greystoke bungalow.    What purpose prompted the Belgian in leading the victim of his  treachery and greed back toward his former home it is difficult to  guess, unless it was that without Tarzan there could be no ransom for  Tarzan's wife.    That night they camped in the valley beyond the hills, and as they sat  before a little fire where cooked a wild pig that had fallen to one of  Tarzan's arrows, the latter sat lost in speculation.  He seemed  continually to be trying to grasp some mental image which as constantly  eluded him.    At last he opened the leathern pouch which hung at his side.  From it  he poured into the palm of his hand a quantity of glittering gems.  The  firelight playing upon them conjured a multitude of scintillating rays,  and as the wide eyes of the Belgian looked on in rapt fascination, the  man's expression at last acknowledged a tangible purpose in courting  the society of the ape-man.          9    The Theft of the Jewels      For two days Werper sought for the party that had accompanied him from  the camp to the barrier cliffs; but not until late in the afternoon of  the second day did he find clew to its whereabouts, and then in such  gruesome form that he was totally unnerved by the sight.    In an open glade he came upon the bodies of three of the blacks,  terribly mutilated, nor did it require considerable deductive power to  explain their murder.  Of the little party only these three had not  been slaves.  The others, evidently tempted to hope for freedom from  their cruel Arab master, had taken advantage of their separation from  the main camp, to slay the three representatives of the hated power  which held them in slavery, and vanish into the jungle.    Cold sweat exuded from Werper's forehead as he contemplated the fate  which chance had permitted him to escape, for had he been present when  the conspiracy bore fruit, he, too, must have been of the garnered.    Tarzan showed not the slightest surprise or interest in the discovery.  Inherent in him was a calloused familiarity with violent death.  The  refinements of his recent civilization expunged by the force of the sad  calamity which had befallen him, left only the primitive sensibilities  which his childhood's training had imprinted indelibly upon the fabric  of his mind.    The training of Kala, the examples and precepts of Kerchak, of Tublat,  and of Terkoz now formed the basis of his every thought and action.  He  retained a mechanical knowledge of French and English speech.  Werper  had spoken to him in French, and Tarzan had replied in the same tongue  without conscious realization that he had departed from the  anthropoidal speech in which he had addressed La.  Had Werper used  English, the result would have been the same.    Again, that night, as the two sat before their camp fire, Tarzan played  with his shining baubles.  Werper asked him what they were and where he  had found them.  The ape-man replied that they were gay-colored stones,  with which he purposed fashioning a necklace, and that he had found  them far beneath the sacrificial court of the temple of the Flaming God.    Werper was relieved to find that Tarzan had no conception of the value  of the gems.  This would make it easier for the Belgian to obtain  possession of them.  Possibly the man would give them to him for the  asking.  Werper reached out his hand toward the little pile that Tarzan  had arranged upon a piece of flat wood before him.    \"Let me see them,\" said the Belgian.    Tarzan placed a large palm over his treasure.  He bared his fighting  fangs, and growled.  Werper withdrew his hand more quickly than he had  advanced it.  Tarzan resumed his playing with the gems, and his  conversation with Werper as though nothing unusual had occurred.  He  had but exhibited the beast's jealous protective instinct for a  possession.  When he killed he shared the meat with Werper; but had  Werper ever, by accident, laid a hand upon Tarzan's share, he would  have aroused the same savage, and resentful warning.    From that occurrence dated the beginning of a great fear in the breast  of the Belgian for his savage companion.  He had never understood the  transformation that had been wrought in Tarzan by the blow upon his  head, other than to attribute it to a form of amnesia.  That Tarzan had  once been, in truth, a savage, jungle beast, Werper had not known, and  so, of course, he could not guess that the man had reverted to the  state in which his childhood and young manhood had been spent.    Now Werper saw in the Englishman a dangerous maniac, whom the slightest  untoward accident might turn upon him with rending fangs.  Not for a  moment did Werper attempt to delude himself into the belief that he  could defend himself successfully against an attack by the ape-man.  His one hope lay in eluding him, and making for the far distant camp of  Achmet Zek as rapidly as he could; but armed only with the sacrificial  knife, Werper shrank from attempting the journey through the jungle.  Tarzan constituted a protection that was by no means despicable, even  in the face of the larger carnivora, as Werper had reason to  acknowledge from the evidence he had witnessed in the Oparian temple.    Too, Werper had his covetous soul set upon the pouch of gems, and so he  was torn between the various emotions of avarice and fear.  But avarice  it was that burned most strongly in his breast, to the end that he  dared the dangers and suffered the terrors of constant association with  him he thought a mad man, rather than give up the hope of obtaining  possession of the fortune which the contents of the little pouch  represented.    Achmet Zek should know nothing of these--these would be for Werper  alone, and so soon as he could encompass his design he would reach the  coast and take passage for America, where he could conceal himself  beneath the veil of a new identity and enjoy to some measure the fruits  of his theft.  He had it all planned out, did Lieutenant Albert Werper,  living in anticipation the luxurious life of the idle rich.  He even  found himself regretting that America was so provincial, and that  nowhere in the new world was a city that might compare with his beloved  Brussels.    It was upon the third day of their progress from Opar that the keen  ears of Tarzan caught the sound of men behind them.  Werper heard  nothing above the humming of the jungle insects, and the chattering  life of the lesser monkeys and the birds.    For a time Tarzan stood in statuesque silence, listening, his sensitive  nostrils dilating as he assayed each passing breeze.  Then he withdrew  Werper into the concealment of thick brush, and waited.  Presently,  along the game trail that Werper and Tarzan had been following, there  came in sight a sleek, black warrior, alert and watchful.    In single file behind him, there followed, one after another, near  fifty others, each burdened with two dull-yellow ingots lashed upon his  back.  Werper recognized the party immediately as that which had  accompanied Tarzan on his journey to Opar.  He glanced at the ape-man;  but in the savage, watchful eyes he saw no recognition of Basuli and  those other loyal Waziri.    When all had passed, Tarzan rose and emerged from concealment.  He  looked down the trail in the direction the party had gone.  Then he  turned to Werper.    \"We will follow and slay them,\" he said.    \"Why?\" asked the Belgian.    \"They are black,\" explained Tarzan.  \"It was a black who killed Kala.  They are the enemies of the Manganis.\"    Werper did not relish the idea of engaging in a battle with Basuli and  his fierce fighting men.  And, again, he had welcomed the sight of them  returning toward the Greystoke bungalow, for he had begun to have  doubts as to his ability to retrace his steps to the Waziri country.  Tarzan, he knew, had not the remotest idea of whither they were going.  By keeping at a safe distance behind the laden warriors, they would  have no difficulty in following them home.  Once at the bungalow,  Werper knew the way to the camp of Achmet Zek.  There was still another  reason why he did not wish to interfere with the Waziri--they were  bearing the great burden of treasure in the direction he wished it  borne.  The farther they took it, the less the distance that he and  Achmet Zek would have to transport it.    He argued with the ape-man therefore, against the latter's desire to  exterminate the blacks, and at last he prevailed upon Tarzan to follow  them in peace, saying that he was sure they would lead them out of the  forest into a rich country, teeming"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/926"],[0,"Ten Thousand Dreams Interpreted; Or, What's in a Dream (#10)"],[1,"nce,  signifies that she will be the possessor of vast interests, and her love  will be worthy the winning.  If her circle of acquaintances is small,  she will be unlucky in gaining social favors.    [9] After dreaming of acquaintances, you may see or hear from them.    _Acquit_.    To dream that you are acquitted of a crime, denotes that you  are about to come into possession of valuable property,  but there is danger of a law suit before obtaining possession.    To see others acquitted, foretells that your friends will add  pleasure to your labors.    _Acrobat_.    To dream of seeing acrobats, denotes that you will be prevented from carrying  out hazardous schemes by the foolish fears of others.    To see yourself acrobating, you will have a sensation to answer for,  and your existence will be made almost unendurable by the guying  of your enemies.    To see women acrobating, denotes that your name will be maliciously  and slanderously handled.  Also your business interests will be hindered.    For a young woman to dream that she sees acrobats in tights,  signifies that she will court favor of men.    _Actor and Actress_.    To see in your dreams an actress, denotes that your present state  will be one of unbroken pleasure and favor.    To see one in distress, you will gladly contribute your means and influence  to raise a friend from misfortune and indebtedness.    If you think yourself one, you will have to work for subsistence,  but your labors will be pleasantly attended.    If you dream of being in love with one, your inclination and talent  will be allied with pleasure and opposed to downright toil.    To see a dead actor, or actress, your good luck will be overwhelmed  in violent and insubordinate misery.    To see them wandering and penniless, foretells that your affairs  will undergo a change from promise to threatenings of failure.  To those enjoying domestic comforts, it is a warning of revolution  and faithless vows.    For a young woman to dream that she is engaged to an actor,  or about to marry one, foretells that her fancy will bring  remorse after the glamor of pleasure has vanished.    If a man dreams that he is sporting with an actress,  it foretells that private broils with his wife, or sweetheart,  will make him more misery than enjoyment.    _Adam and Eve_.    To dream of Adam and Eve, foretells that some eventful occasion  will rob you of the hope of success in your affairs.    To see them in the garden, Adam dressed in his fig leaf, but Eve perfectly  nude save for an Oriental colored serpent ornamenting her waist and abdomen,  signifies that treachery and ill faith will combine to overthrow your fortune.    To see or hear Eve conversing with the serpent, foretells that artful  women will reduce you to the loss of fortune and reputation.    _Adamant_.    To dream of adamant, denotes that you will be troubled and defeated  in some desire that you held as your life.    _Adder_.    To dream of seeing an adder strike, and a friend, who is dead but seems  to be lying down and breathing, rises partly to a sitting position when  the adder strikes at him, and then both disappearing into some bushes nearby,  denotes that you will be greatly distressed over the ill luck of friends,  and a loss threatened to yourself.    For a young woman to see an adder, foretells a deceitful  person is going to cause her trouble.  If it runs from her,  she will be able to defend her character in attacks made on her.    _Addition_.    To dream of pondering over addition, denotes that you will have a struggle  to overcome difficult situations, which will soon prominently assume  formidable shapes in your business transactions.    To find some error in addition, shows that you will be able  to overcome enemies by fortunately discerning their intention  before they have executed their design.    To add figures with a machine, foretells that you will have a powerful ally  who will save you from much oppression.    If you fail to read the figures, you will lose fortune by blind speculation.    _Adieu_.    To dream of bidding cheerful adieus to people, denotes that you  will make pleasant visits and enjoy much social festivity;  but if they are made in a sad or doleful strain, you will endure  loss and bereaving sorrow.    If you bid adieu to home and country, you will travel in the nature  of an exile from fortune and love.    To throw kisses of adieu to loved ones, or children, foretells that you  will soon have a journey to make, but there will be no unpleasant accidents  or happenings attending your trip.    _Admire_.    To dream that you are an object of admiration, denotes that you  will retain the love of former associates, though your position  will take you above their circle.    _Admonish_.    To admonish your child, or son, or some young person,  denotes that your generous principles will keep you in favor,  and fortune will be added to your gifts.    _Adopted_.    To see your adopted child, or parent, in your dreams, indicates that you  will amass fortune through the schemes and speculations of strangers.    To dream that you or others are adopting a child, you will make  an unfortunate change in your abode.    _Adultery_.[10]    To dream that you commit adultery, foretells that you will be  arrainged{sic} for some illegal action.  If a woman has this dream,  she will fail to hold her husband's affections, letting her  temper and spite overwhelm her at the least provocation.  If it is with her husband's friend, she will be unjustly ignored  by her husband.  Her rights will be cruelly trampled upon by him.  If she thinks she is enticing a youth into this act, she will be  in danger of desertion and divorced for her open intriguing.    For a young woman this implies abasement and low desires,  in which she will find strange adventures afford her pleasure.    [10] It is always good to dream that you have successfully resisted  any temptation.  To yield, is bad.  If a man chooses low ideals, vampirish  influences will swarm around him ready to help him in his nefarious designs.  Such dreams may only be the result of depraved elementary influences.  If a man chooses high ideals, he will be illuminated by the deific  principle within him, and will be exempt from lascivious dreams.  The man who denies the existence and power of evil spirits has no arcana  or occult knowledge.  Did not the black magicians of Pharaoh's time,  and Simon Magnus, the Sorcerer, rival the men of God?  The dreamer  of amorous sweets is warned to beware of scandal.    _Adulation_.    To dream that you seek adulation, foretells that you will pompously  fill unmerited positions of honor.    If you offer adulation, you will expressly part with some dear  belonging in the hope of furthering material interests.    _Advancement_.    To dream of advancing in any engagement, denotes your rapid ascendency  to preferment and to the consummation of affairs of the heart.    To see others advancing, foretells that friends will hold positions  of favor near you.    _Adversary_.[11]    To dream that you meet or engage with an adversary, denotes that  you will promptly defend any attacks on your interest.  Sickness may also threaten you after this dream.    If you overcome an adversary, you will escape the effect  of some serious disaster.    [11] See Enemies.    _Adventurer_.    To dream that you are victimized by an adventurer, proves that you  will be an easy prey for flatterers and designing villains.  You will be unfortunate in manipulating your affairs to  a smooth consistency.    For a young woman to think she is an adventuress, portends that she  will be too wrapped up in her own conduct to see that she is being  flattered into exchanging her favors for disgrace.    _Adversity_.    To dream that you are in the clutches of adversity, denotes that you  will have failures and continued bad prospects.    To see others in adversity, portends gloomy surroundings, and the illness  of some one will produce grave fears of the successful working of plans.[12]    [12] The old dream books give this as a sign of coming prosperity.  This definition is untrue.  There are two forces at work in man, one from  within and the other from without.  They are from two distinct spheres;  the animal mind influenced by the personal world of carnal appetites,  and the spiritual mind from the realm of universal Brotherhood,  present antagonistic motives on the dream consciousness.  If these two  forces were in harmony, the spirit or mental picture from the dream  mind would find a literal fulfilment in the life of the dreamer.  The pleasurable sensations of the body cause the spirit anguish.  The selfish enrichment of the body impoverishes the spirit influence upon  the Soul.  The trials of adversity often cause the spirit to rejoice  and the flesh to weep.  If the cry of the grieved spirit is left  on the dream mind it may indicate to the dreamer worldly advancement,  but it is hardly the theory of the occult forces, which have contributed  to the contents of this book.    _Advertisement_.    To dream that you are getting out advertisements, denotes that you  will have to resort to physical labor to promote your interest,  or establish your fortune.    To read advertisements, denotes that enemies will overtake you,  and defeat you in rivalry.    _Advice_.    To dream that you receive advice, denotes that you will be enabled to raise  your standard of integrity, and strive by honest means to reach independent  competency and moral altitude.    To dream that you seek legal advice, foretells that there will  be some transactions in your affairs which will create doubt  of their merits and legality.    _Advocate_.    To dream that you advocate any cause, denotes that you will be faithful  to your interests, and endeavor to deal honestly with the public,  as your interests affect it, and be loyal to your promises to friends.    _Afraid_.    To feel that you are afraid to"]]]
