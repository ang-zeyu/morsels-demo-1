[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13486"],[0,"The Story of Sigurd the Volsung (#11)"],[1," began;--\"    The three wandered over the earth till they came to a mighty river,  haunted for long by Otter, by reason of its great wealth of fish.  There he lay on the bank, and as he watched the fish in the water his  shape was changed to that of a true otter, and he began to devour a  golden trout. Two of the gods would have passed without stay, but in  the otter Loki saw an enemy, and straightway killed him, rejoicing  over his dead body.    As night fell the three gods came to a great hall, wondrously wrought  and carved, with golden hangings and forests of pillars. In the midst  of the hall sat a king on an ivory throne, and his garments were made  of purple from the sea. Kind welcome he gave to the wanderers, and  there they feasted and delighted in music and song; but even as they  drank and made merry they knew they were caught in the snare.    The king's welcome changed to scornful laughter, and thus he spoke:  \"Truly are ye gods, but ye are come to people who want you not. Before  ye were known to us, still was the winter cold, and the summer warm,  and still could we find meat and drink. I am Reidmar, and ye come  straight from the slaying of Reidmar's son. Shall I not then take the  vengeance I will? Unless, indeed, ye give me the treasure I covet, and  then shall ye go your way. This is my sentence. Choose ye which ye  will.\"    Then spake the wise Allfather and prayed Reidmar to unsay his word,  and cease to desire the gold. But Reidmar the Wise, and Fafnir the  Lord, and Regin the Worker cried aloud in their wrath:--      \"'O hearken Gods of the Goths! ye shall die, and we shall be Gods,    And rule your men beloved with bitter-heavy rods,    And make them beasts beneath us, save today ye do our will,    And pay us the ransom of blood, and our hearts with the gold fulfill.'      \"But Odin spake in answer, and his voice was awful and cold:    'Give righteous doom, O Reidmar! say what ye will of the Gold!'      \"Then Reidmar laughed in his heart, and his wrath and his wisdom fled,    And nought but his greed abided; and he spake from his throne and said:      \"'Now hearken the doom I shall speak! Ye stranger-folk shall be free    When ye give me the Flame of the Waters, the gathered Gold of the Sea,    That Andvari hideth rejoicing in the wan realm pale as the grave;    And the Master of Sleight shall fetch it, and the hand that never gave,    And the heart that begrudgeth for ever shall gather and give and rue.    --Lo this is the doom of the wise, and no doom shall be spoken anew.'      \"Then Odin spake: 'It is well; the Curser shall seek for the curse;    And the Greedy shall cherish the evil--and the seed of the Great they shall         nurse.'      \"No word spake Reidmar the great, for the eyes of his heart were turned    To the edge of the outer desert, so sore for the gold he yearned.    But Loki I loosed from the toils, and he goeth his way abroad;    And the heart of Odin he knoweth, and where he shall seek the Hoard.      \"There is a desert of dread in the uttermost part of the world,    Where over a wall of mountains is a mighty water hurled,    Whose hidden head none knoweth, nor where it meeteth the sea;    And that force is the Force of Andvari, and an Elf of the Dark is he.    In the cloud and the desert he dwelleth amid that land alone;    And his work is the storing of treasure within his house of stone.    Time was when he knew of wisdom, and had many a tale to tell    Of the days before the Dwarf-age, and of what in that world befell:    And he knew of the stars and the sun, and the worlds that come and go    On the nether rim of heaven, and whence the wind doth blow,    And how the sea hangs balanced betwixt the curving lands,    And how all drew together for the first Gods' fashioning hands.    But now is all gone from him, save the craft of gathering gold,    And he heedeth nought of the summer, nor knoweth the winter cold,    Nor looks to the sun nor the snowfall, nor ever dreams of the sea,    Nor hath heard of the making of men-folk, nor of where the high Gods be;    But ever he gripeth and gathereth, and he toileth hour by hour,    Nor knoweth the noon from the midnight as he looks on his stony bower,    And saith: 'It is short, it is narrow for all I shall gather and get;    For the world is but newly fashioned, and long shall its years be yet.'      \"There Loki fareth, and seeth in a land of nothing good,    Far off o'er the empty desert, the reek of the falling flood    Go up to the floor of heaven, and thither turn his feet    As he weaveth the unseen meshes and the snare of strong deceit;    So he cometh his ways to the water, where the glittering foam-bow glows,    And the huge flood leaps the rock-wall and a green arch over it throws.    There under the roof of water he treads the quivering floor,    And the hush of the desert is felt amid the water's roar,    And the bleak sun lighteth the wave-vault, and tells of the fruitless plain,    And the showers that nourish nothing, and the summer come in vain.      \"There did the great Guile-master his toils and his tangles set,    And as wide as was the water, so wide was woven the net;    And as dim as the Elf's remembrance did the meshes of it show;    And he had no thought of sorrow, nor spared to come and go    On his errands of griping and getting till he felt himself tangled and         caught:    Then back to his blinded soul was his ancient wisdom brought,    And he saw his fall and his ruin, as a man by the lightning's flame    Sees the garth all flooded by foemen; and again he remembered his name;    And e'en as a book well written the tale of the Gods he knew,    And the tale of the making of men, and much of the deeds they should do.           *       *       *       *       *      \"Then Andvari groaned and answered: 'I know what thou wouldst have,    The wealth mine own hands gathered, the gold that no man gave.'      \"'Come forth,' said Loki, 'and give it, and dwell in peace henceforth--    Or die in the toils if thou listeth, if thy life be nothing worth.'      \"Full sore the Elf lamented, but he came before the God,    And the twain went into the rock-house and on fine gold they trod,    And the walls shone bright, and brighter than the sun of the upper air.    How great was that treasure of treasures: and the Helm of Dread was there;    The world but in dreams had seen it; and there was the hauberk of gold;    None other is in the heavens, nor has earth of its fellow told.      \"Then Loki bade the Elf-king bring all to the upper day,    And he dight himself with his Godhead to bear the treasure away:    So there in the dim grey desert before the God of Guile,    Great heaps of the hid-world's treasure the weary Elf must pile,    And Loki looked on laughing: but, when it all was done,    And the Elf was hurrying homeward, his finger gleamed in the sun:    Then Loki cried: 'Thou art guileful: thou hast not learned the tale    Of the wisdom that Gods hath gotten and their might of all avail.           *       *       *       *       *      \"'Come hither again to thy master, and give the ring to me;    For meseems it is Loki's portion, and the Bale of Men shall it be.'      \"Then the Elf drew off the gold-ring and stood with empty hand    E'en where the flood fell over 'twixt the water and the land,    And he gazed on the great Guile-master, and huge and grim he grew;    And his anguish swelled within him, and the word of the Norns he knew;    How that gold was the seed of gold to the wise and the shapers of things,    The hoarders of hidden treasure, and the unseen glory of rings;    But the seed of woe to the world and the foolish wasters of men,    And grief to the generations that die and spring again:    Then he cried:                 'There farest thou Loki, and might I load thee worse    Than with what thine ill heart beareth, then shouldst thou bear my curse:    But for men a curse thou bearest: entangled in my gold,    Amid my woe abideth another woe untold.    Two brethren and a father, eight kings my grief shall slay;    And the hearts of queens shall be broken, and their eyes shall loathe the         day.'           *       *       *       *       *      \"But Loki laughed in silence, and swift in Godhead went,    To the golden hall of Reidmar and the house of our content.    But when that world of treasure was laid within our hall    'Twas as if the sun were minded to live 'twixt wall and wall,    And all we stood by and panted. Then Odin spake and said:      \"'O Kings, O folk of the Dwarf-kind, lo, the ransom duly paid!    Will ye have this sun of the ocean, and reap the fruitful field,    And garner up the harvest that earth therefrom shall yield.'      \"So he spake; but a little season nought answered Reidmar the wise,    But turned his face from the Treasure, and peered with eager eyes    Endlong the hall and athwart it, as a man may chase about    A ray of the sun of the morning that a naked sword throws out;    And lo from Loki's right-hand came the flash of the fruitful ring,    And at last spake Reidmar scowling:                                      'Ye wait for my yea-saying    That your feet may go free on the earth, and the fear of my toils may be         done;    That then ye may say in your laughter: The fools of the time agone!    The purblind eyes of the Dwarf-kind! they have gotten the garnered sheaf    And have let their Masters depart with the Seed of Gold and of Grief:    O Loki, friend of Allfather, cast down Andvari's ring,    Or the world shall yet turn backward and the high heavens lack a king.'      \"Then Loki drew off the Elf-ring and cast it down on the heap,    And forth as the gold met gold did the light of its glory leap:    But he spake: 'It rejoiceth my heart that no whit of all ye shall lack.    Lest the curse of the Elf-king cleave not, and ye 'scape the utter wrack.'

Dried peas need not be soaked over night. They should be stewed slowly  four or five hours in considerable water, with a piece of pork. The  older beans and peas are, the longer they should cook. Indeed, this is  the case with all vegetables.      SOUSE.    Pigs' feet, ears, &c., should be cleaned after being soaked in water  not very hot; the hoofs will then come off easily with a sharp knife;  the hard, rough places should be cut off; they should be thoroughly  singed, and then boiled as much as four or five hours, until they are  too tender to be taken out with a fork. When taken from the boiling  water, it should be put into cold water. After it is packed down  tight, boil the jelly-like liquor in which it was cooked with an equal  quantity of vinegar; salt as you think fit, and cloves, allspice, and  cinnamon, at the rate of a quarter of a pound to one hundred weight:  to be poured on scalding hot.      TRIPE.    Tripe should be kept in cold water, or it will become too dry for  cooking. The water in which it is kept should be changed more or less  frequently, according to the warmth of the weather. Broiled like  a steak, buttered, peppered, &c. Some people like it prepared like  souse.      GRAVY.    Most people put a half a pint of flour and water into their  tin-kitchen, when they set meat down to roast. This does very well;  but gravy is better flavored, and looks darker, to shake flour and  salt upon the meat; let it brown thoroughly, put flour and salt on  again, and then baste the meat with about half a pint of hot water (or  more, according to the gravy you want.) When the meat is about done,  pour these drippings into a skillet, and let it boil. If it is not  thick enough, shake in a little flour; but be sure to let it boil,  and be well stirred, after the flour is in. If you fear it will be too  greasy, take off a cupful of the fat before you boil. The fat of beef,  pork, turkeys and geese is as good for shortening as lard. Salt gravy  to your taste. If you are very particular about dark gravies, keep  your dredging-box full of scorched flour for that purpose.      POULTRY.    There are various ways of deciding about the age of poultry.    If the bottom of the breast bone, which extends down between the  legs, is soft, and gives easily, it is a sign of youth; if stiff, the  poultry is old.    If young, the legs are lighter, and the feet do not look so hard,  stiff, and worn.    There is more deception in geese than in any other kind of poultry.  The above remarks are applied to them; but there are other signs  more infallible. In a young goose, the cavity under the wings is very  tender; it is a bad sign if you cannot, with very little trouble, push  your finger directly into the flesh. There is another means by which  you may decide whether a goose be tender, if it be frozen or not.  Pass the head of a pin along the breast, or sides, and if the goose be  young, the skin will rip, like fine paper under a knife.    Something may be judged concerning the age of a goose by the  thickness of the web between the toes. When young, this is tender and  transparent; it grows coarser and harder with time.    In broiling chickens, it is difficult to do the inside of the thickest  pieces without scorching the outside. It is a good plan to parboil  them about ten minutes in a spider or skillet, covered close to keep  the steam in; then put them upon the gridiron, broil and butter. It  is a good plan to cover them with a plate, while on the gridiron.  They may be basted with a very little of the water in which they were  broiled; and if you have company who like melted butter to pour upon  the chicken, the remainder of the liquor will be good use for that  purpose.    An hour is enough for common sized chickens to roast. A smart fire  is better than a slow one; but they must be tended closely. Slices of  bread, buttered, salted, and peppered, put into the stomach (not the  crop) are excellent.    Chickens should boil about an hour. If old, they should boil longer.  In as little water as will cook them. Chicken-broth made like  mutton-broth.      FRICASSEED CHICKEN, BROWN.    Singe the chickens; cut them in pieces; pepper, salt, and flour them;  fry them in fresh butter, till they are very brown: take the chickens  out, and make a good gravy, into which put sweet herbs (marjoram or  sage) according to your taste; if necessary, add pepper and salt;  butter and flour must be used in making the gravy, in such quantities  as to suit yourself for thickness and richness. After this is all  prepared, the chicken must be stewed in it, for half an hour, closely  covered. A pint of gravy is about enough for two chickens; I should  think a piece of butter about as big as a walnut, and a table-spoonful  of flour, would be enough for the gravy. The herbs should, of course,  be pounded and sifted. Some, who love onions, slice two or three, and  brown them with the chicken. Some slice a half lemon, and stew with  the chicken. Some add tomatoes catsup.      FRICASSEED CHICKEN, WHITE.    The chickens are cut to pieces, and covered with warm water, to draw  out the blood. Then put into a stew-pan, with three quarters of a  pint of water, or veal broth, salt, pepper, flour, butter, mace, sweet  herbs pounded and sifted; boil it half an hour. If it is too fat, skim  it a little. Just before it is done, mix the yolk of two eggs with a  gill of cream, grate in a little nutmeg, stir it up till it is thick  and smooth, squeeze in half a lemon. If you like onions, stew some  slices with the other ingredients.      TO CURRY FOWL.    Fry out two or three slices of salt pork; cut the chicken in pieces,  and lay it in the stew-pan with one sliced onion; when the fowl  is tender, take it out, and put in thickening into the liquor, one  spoonful of flour, and one spoonful of curry-powder, well stirred  up in water. Then lay the chicken in again, and let it boil up a few  minutes. A half a pint of liquor is enough for one chicken. About half  an hour's stewing is necessary. The juice of half a lemon improves it;  and some like a spoonful of tomatoes catsup.      CHICKEN BROTH.    Cut a chicken in quarters; put it into three or four quarts of water;  put in a cup of rice while the water is cold; season it with pepper  and salt; some use nutmeg. Let it stew gently, until the chicken falls  apart. A little parsley, shred fine, is an improvement. Some slice up  a small onion and stew with it. A few pieces of cracker may be thrown  in if you like.    A common sized goose should roast full three quarters of an hour. The  oil that drips from it should be nearly all turned off; it makes the  gravy too greasy; and it is nice for shortening. It should first be  turned into cold water; when hardened, it should be taken off and  scalded in a skillet. This process leaves it as sweet as lard.    Ducks do not need to be roasted more than fifteen or twenty minutes.  Butter melted in boiling flour and water is proper sauce for boiled  lamb, mutton, veal, turkeys, geese, chickens, and fish. Some people  cut up parsley fine, and throw in. Some people like capers put in.  Others heat oysters through on the gridiron, and take them out of the  shells, and throw them into the butter.    A good sized turkey should be roasted two hours and a half, or three  hours; very slowly at first. If you wish to make plain stuffing, pound  a cracker, or crumble some bread very fine, chop some raw salt pork  very fine, sift some sage, (and summer-savory, or sweet-marjoram,  if you have them in the house, and fancy them,) and mould them all  together, seasoned with a little pepper. An egg worked in makes the  stuffing cut better; but it is not worth while when eggs are dear.  About the same length of time is required for boiling and roasting.    Pigeons may be either roasted, potted or stewed. Potting is the best,  and the least trouble. After they are thoroughly picked and cleaned,  put a small slice of salt pork, and a little ball of stuffing, into  the body of every pigeon. The stuffing should be made of one egg  to one cracker, an equal quantity of suet, or butter, seasoned with  sweet-marjoram, or sage, if marjoram cannot be procured. Flour the  pigeons well, lay them close together in the bottom of the pot, just  cover them with water, throw in a bit of butter, and let them stew an  hour and a quarter if young; an hour and three quarters if old. Some  people turn off the liquor just before they are done, and brown the  pigeons on the bottom of the pot; but this is very troublesome, as  they are apt to break to pieces.    Stewed pigeons are cooked in nearly the same way, with the omission of  the stuffing. Being dry meat, they require a good deal of butter.    Pigeons should be stuffed and roasted about fifteen minutes before a  smart fire. Those who like birds just warmed through, would perhaps  think less time necessary. It makes them nicer to butter them well  just before you take them off the spit, and sprinkle them with nicely  pounded bread, or cracker. All poultry should be basted and floured a  few minutes before it is taken up.    The age of pigeons can be judged by the color of the legs. When young,  they are of a pale delicate brown; as they grow older, the color is  deeper and redder.    A nice way of serving up cold chicken, or pieces of cold fresh meat,  is to make them into a meat pie. The gizzards, livers, and necks of  poultry, parboiled, are good for the same purpose. If you wish to  bake your meat pie, line a deep earthen or tin pan with paste made of  flour, cold water, and lard; use but little lard, for the fat of the  meat will shorten the crust. Lay in your bits of meat, or chicken,  with two or three slices of salt pork; place a few thin slices of your  paste here and there; drop in an egg or two, if you have "]]]
