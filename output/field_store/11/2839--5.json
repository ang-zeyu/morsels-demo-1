And now we may take it  for granted that my classification of five types is everywhere accepted.  These are the following: The _born criminal_ who has a congenital  predisposition for crime; the _insane criminal_ suffering from some  clinical form of mental alienation, and whom even our existing penal  code had to recognize; the _habitual criminal_, that is to say one who  has acquired the habit of crime mainly through the ineffective measures  employed by society for the prevention and repression of crime. A common  figure in our large industrial centers is that of the abandoned child  which has to go begging from its earliest youth in order to collect an  income for the enterprising boss or for its poor family, without an  opportunity to educate its moral sense in the filth of the streets. It  is punished for the first time by the law and sent to prison or to a  reformatory, where it is inevitably corrupted. Then, when such an  individual comes out of prison, he is stigmatized as a thief or forger,  watched by the police, and if he secures work in some shop, the owner is  indirectly induced to discharge him, so that he must inevitably fall  back upon crime.    Thus one acquires crime as a habit, a product of social rottenness, due  to the ineffective measures for the prevention and repression of crime.  There is furthermore the _occasional criminal_, who commits very  insignificant criminal acts, more because he is led astray by his  conditions of life than because the aggressive energy of a degenerate  personality impels him. If he is not made worse by a prison life, he may  find an opportunity to return to a normal life in society. Finally there  is the _passionate criminal,_ who, like the insane criminal, has  received attention from the positive school of criminology; which,  however, did not come to any definite conclusions regarding him, such as  may be gathered by means of the experimental method through study in  prisons, insane asylums, or in freedom. The relations between passion  and crime have so far been studied on a field in which no solution was  possible. For the classic school considers such a crime according to  the greater or smaller intensity and violence of passion and comes to  the conclusion that the degree of responsibility decreases to the extent  that the intensity of a passion increases, and vice versa. The problem  cannot be solved in this way. There are passions which may rise to the  highest degree of intensity without reducing the responsibility. For  instance, is one who murders from motives of revenge a passionate  criminal who must be excused?    The classic school of criminology says \"No,\" and for my part I agree  with them. Francesco Carrara says: \"There are blind passions, and others  which are reasonable. Blind passions deprive one of free will,  reasonable ones do not. Blind and excusable passions are fear, honor,  love, reasonable and inexcusable ones are hatred and revenge.\" But how  so? I have studied murderers who killed for revenge and who told me that  the desire for revenge took hold of them like a fever, so that they  \"forgot even to eat.\" Hate and revenge can take possession of a man to  such an extent that he becomes blind with passion. The truth is that  passion must be considered not so far as its violence or quantity are  concerned, but rather as to its quality. We must distinguish between  social and anti-social passion, the one favoring the conditions of life  for the species and collectivity, the other antagonistic to the  development of the collectivity. In the first case, we have love,  injured honor, etc, which are passions normally useful to society, and  aberrations of which may be excused more or less according to individual  cases. On the other hand, we have inexcusable passions, because their  psychological tendency is to antagonize the development of society. They  are antisocial, and cannot be excused, and hate and revenge are among  them.    The positive school therefore admits that a passion is excusable, when  the moral sense of a man is normal, when his past record is clear, and  when his crime is due to a social passion, which makes it excusable.    We shall see tomorrow what remedies the positive school of criminology  proposes for each one of these categories of criminals, in distinction  from the measuring of doses of imprisonment advocated by the classic  school.    We have thus exhausted in a short and general review the subject of the  natural origin of criminality.--To sum up, crime is a social  phenomenon, due to the interaction of anthropological, telluric, and  social factors. This law brings about what I have called criminal  saturation, which means that every society has the criminality which it  deserves, and which produces by means of its geographical and social  conditions such quantities and qualities of crime as correspond to the  development of each collective human group.    Thus the old saying of Imetelet is confirmed: \"There is an annual  balance of crime, which must be paid and settled with greater regularity  than the accounts of the national revenue.\" However, we positivists give  to this statement a less fatalistic interpretation, since we have  demonstrated that crime is not our immutable destiny, even though it is  a vain beginning to attempt to attenuate or eliminate crime by mere  schemes. The truth is that the balance of crime is determined by the  physical and social environment. But by changing the condition of the  social environment, which is most easily modified, the legislator may  alter the influence of the telluric environment and the organic and  psychic conditions of the population, control the greater portion of  crimes, and reduce them considerably. It is our firm conviction that a  truly civilized legislator can attenuate the plague of criminality, not  so much by means of the criminal code, as by means of remedies which are  latent in the remainder of the social life and of legislation. And the  experience of the most advanced countries confirms this by the  beneficent and preventive influence of criminal legislation resting on  efficacious social reforms.    We arrive, then, at this scientific conclusion: In the society of the  future, the necessity for penal justice will be reduced to the extent  that social justice grows intensively and extensively.      III.    In the preceding two lectures, I have given you a short review of the  new current in scientific thought, which studies the painful and  dangerous phenomena of criminality. We must now draw the logical  conclusions, in theory and practice, from the teachings of experimented  science, for the removal of the gangrenous plague of crime. Under the  influence of the positive methods of research, the old formula \"Science  for science's sake\" has given place to the new formula \"Science for  life's sake.\" For it would be useless for the human mind to retreat into  the vault of philosophical concentration, if this intellectual mastery  did not produce as a counter-effect a beneficent wave of real  improvement in the destinies of the human race.    What, then, has the civilized world to offer in the way of remedies  against criminality? The classic school of criminology, being unable to  locate in the course of its scientific and historical mission the  natural causes of crime, as I have shown in the preceding lectures, was  not in a position to deal in a comprehensive and far-seeing manner with  this problem of the remedy against criminality. Some of the classic  criminologists, such as Bentham, Romagnosi, or Ellero, with a more  positive bent of mind than others, may have given a little of their  scientific activity to the analysis of this problem, namely the  prevention of crime. But Ellero himself had to admit that \"the classic  school of criminology has written volumes concerning the death penalty  and torture, but has produced but a few pages on the prevention of  criminality.\" The historical mission of that school consisted in a  reduction of punishment. For being born on the eve of the French  revolution in the name of individualism and natural rights, it was a  protest against the barbarian penalties of the Middle Ages. And thus the  practical and glorious result of the classic school was a propaganda for  the abolition of the most brutal penalties of the Middle Ages, such as  the death penalty, torture, mutilation. We in our turn now follow up the  practical and scientific mission of the classic school of criminology  with a still more noble and fruitful mission by adding to the problem of  the _diminution of penalties_ the problem of the _diminution of crimes_.  It is worth more to humanity to reduce the number of crimes than to  reduce the dread sufferings of criminal punishments, although even this  is a noble work, after the evil plant of crime has been permitted to  grow in the realm of life. Take, for instance, the philanthropic  awakening due to the Congress of Geneva in the matter of the Red Cross  Society, for the care, treatment and cure of the wounded in war. However  noble and praiseworthy this mission may be, it would be far nobler and  better to prevent war than to heal the mutilated and wounded. If the  same zeal and persistence, which have been expended in the work of the  Red Cross Society, had been devoted to the realization of international  brotherhood, the weary road of human progress would show far better  results.    It is a noble mission to oppose the ferocious penalties of the Middle  Ages. But it is still nobler to forestall crime. The classic school of  criminology directed its attention merely to penalties, to repressive  measures after crime had been committed, with all its terrible moral  and material consequences. For in the classic school, the remedies  against criminality have not the social aim of improving human life, but  merely the illusory mission of retributive"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],[0,"Mike and Psmith (#11)"],[1,"as a punishment for some slip from the narrow path which the  ideal small boy should tread, regarded Stone and Robinson as bullies of  the genuine \"Eric\" and \"St. Winifred's\" brand. Masters were rather  afraid of them. Adair had a smouldering dislike for them. They were  useful at cricket, but apt not to take Sedleigh as seriously as he could  have wished.    As for Mike, he now found them pleasant company, and began to get out  the tea things.    \"Those Fire Brigade meetings,\" said Stone, \"are a rag. You can do what  you like, and you never get more than a hundred lines.\"    \"Don't you!\" said Mike. \"I got Saturday afternoon.\"    \"What!\"    \"Is Wilson in too?\"    \"No. He got a hundred lines.\"    Stone and Robinson were quite concerned.    \"What a beastly swindle!\"    \"That's because you don't play cricket. Old Downing lets you do what you  like if you join the Fire Brigade and play cricket.\"    \"'We are, above all, a keen school,'\" quoted Stone. \"Don't you ever  play?\"    \"I have played a bit,\" said Mike.    \"Well, why don't you have a shot? We aren't such flyers here. If you  know one end of a bat from the other, you could get into some sort of a  team. Were you at school anywhere before you came here?\"    \"I was at Wrykyn.\"    \"Why on earth did you leave?\" asked Stone. \"Were you sacked?\"    \"No. My father took me away.\"    \"Wrykyn?\" said Robinson. \"Are you any relation of the Jacksons  there--J.W. and the others?\"    \"Brother.\"    \"What!\"    \"Well, didn't you play at all there?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mike, \"I did. I was in the team three years, and I should  have been captain this year, if I'd stopped on.\"    There was a profound and gratifying sensation. Stone gaped, and Robinson  nearly dropped his teacup.    Stone broke the silence.    \"But I mean to say--look here? What I mean is, why aren't you playing?  Why don't you play now?\"    \"I do. I play for a village near here. Place called Lower Borlock. A man  who played against Wrykyn for the Free Foresters captains them. He asked  me if I'd like some games for them.\"    \"But why not for the school?\"    \"Why should I? It's much better fun for the village. You don't get  ordered about by Adair, for a start.\"    \"Adair sticks on side,\" said Stone.    \"Enough for six,\" agreed Robinson.    \"By Jove,\" said Stone, \"I've got an idea. My word, what a rag!\"    \"What's wrong now?\" inquired Mike politely.    \"Why, look here. Tomorrow's Mid-Term Service Day. It's nowhere near the  middle of the term, but they always have it in the fourth week. There's  chapel at half past nine till half past ten. Then the rest of the day's  a whole holiday. There are always house matches. We're playing  Downing's. Why don't you play and let's smash them?\"    \"By Jove, yes,\" said Robinson. \"Why don't you? They're always sticking  on side because they've won the house cup three years running. I say, do  you bat or bowl?\"    \"Bat. Why?\"    Robinson rocked on the table.    \"Why, old Downing fancies himself as a bowler. You _must_ play, and  knock the cover off him.\"    \"Masters don't play in house matches, surely?\"    \"This isn't a real house match. Only a friendly. Downing always turns  out on Mid-Term Service Day. I say, do play.\"    \"Think of the rag.\"    \"But the team's full,\" said Mike.    \"The list isn't up yet. We'll nip across to Barnes's study, and make him  alter it.\"    They dashed out of the room. From down the passage Mike heard yells of  \"_Barnes_!\" the closing of a door, and a murmur of excited conversation.  Then footsteps returning down the passage.    Barnes appeared, on his face the look of one who has seen visions.    \"I say,\" he said, \"is it true? Or is Stone rotting? About Wrykyn, I  mean.\"    \"Yes, I was in the team.\"    Barnes was an enthusiastic cricketer. He studied his _Wisden_, and he  had an immense respect for Wrykyn cricket.    \"Are you the M. Jackson, then, who had an average of fifty-one point  naught three last year?\"    \"Yes.\"    Barnes's manner became like that of a curate talking to a bishop.    \"I say,\" he said, \"then--er--will you play against Downing's tomorrow?\"    \"Rather,\" said Mike. \"Thanks awfully. Have some tea?\"        11    THE MATCH WITH DOWNING'S      It is the curious instinct which prompts most people to rub a thing in  that makes the lot of the average convert an unhappy one. Only the very  self-controlled can refrain from improving the occasion and scoring off  the convert. Most leap at the opportunity.    It was so in Mike's case. Mike was not a genuine convert, but to Mr.  Downing he had the outward aspect of one. When you have been impressing  upon a noncricketing boy for nearly a month that (_a_) the school is  above all a keen school, (_b_) that all members of it should play  cricket, and (_c_) that by not playing cricket he is ruining his chances  in this world and imperiling them in the next; and when, quite  unexpectedly, you come upon this boy dressed in cricket flannels,  wearing cricket boots and carrying a cricket bag, it seems only natural  to assume that you have converted him, that the seeds of your eloquence  have fallen on fruitful soil and sprouted.    Mr. Downing assumed it.    He was walking to the field with Adair and another member of his team  when he came upon Mike.    \"What!\" he cried. \"Our Jackson clad in suit of mail and armed for the  fray!\"    This was Mr. Downing's No. 2 manner--the playful.    \"This is indeed Saul among the prophets. Why this sudden enthusiasm for  a game which I understood that you despised? Are our opponents  so reduced?\"    Psmith, who was with Mike, took charge of the affair with a languid  grace which had maddened hundreds in its time, and which never failed to  ruffle Mr. Downing.    \"We are, above all, sir,\" he said, \"a keen house. Drones are not  welcomed by us. We are essentially versatile. Jackson, the archaeologist  of yesterday, becomes the cricketer of today. It is the right spirit,  sir,\" said Psmith earnestly. \"I like to see it.\"    \"Indeed, Smith? You are not playing yourself, I notice. Your enthusiasm  has bounds.\"    \"In our house, sir, competition is fierce, and the Selection Committee  unfortunately passed me over.\"           *       *       *       *       *    There were a number of pitches dotted about over the field, for there  was always a touch of the London Park about it on Mid-Term Service Day.  Adair, as captain of cricket, had naturally selected the best for his  own match. It was a good wicket, Mike saw. As a matter of fact the  wickets at Sedleigh were nearly always good. Adair had infected the  groundsman with some of his own keenness, with the result that that  once-leisurely official now found himself sometimes, with a kind of mild  surprise, working really hard. At the beginning of the previous season  Sedleigh had played a scratch team from a neighboring town on a wicket  which, except for the creases, was absolutely undistinguishable from the  surrounding turf, and behind the pavilion after the match Adair had  spoken certain home truths to the groundsman. The latter's reformation  had dated from that moment.           *       *       *       *       *    Barnes, timidly jubilant, came up to Mike with the news that he had won  the toss, and the request that Mike would go in first with him.    In stories of the \"Not Really a Duffer\" type, where the nervous new boy,  who has been found crying in the changing room over the photograph of  his sister, contrives to get an innings in a game, nobody suspects that  he is really a prodigy till he hits the Bully's first ball out of the  ground for six.    With Mike it was different. There was no pitying smile on Adair's face  as he started his run preparatory to sending down the first ball. Mike,  on the cricket field, could not have looked anything but a cricketer if  he had turned out in a tweed suit and hobnail boots. Cricketer was  written all over him--in his walk, in the way he took guard, in his  stand at the wicket. Adair started to bowl with the feeling that this  was somebody who had more than a little knowledge of how to deal with  good bowling and punish bad.    Mike started cautiously. He was more than usually anxious to make runs  today, and he meant to take no risks till he could afford to do so. He  had seen Adair bowl at the nets, and he knew that he was good.    The first over was a maiden, six dangerous balls beautifully played. The  fieldsmen changed over.    The general interest had now settled on the match between Outwood's and  Downing's. The facts in Mike's case had gone around the field, and, as  several of the other games had not yet begun, quite a large crowd had  collected near the pavilion to watch. Mike's masterly treatment of the  opening over had impressed the spectators, and there was a popular  desire to see how he would deal with Mr. Downing's slows. It was  generally anticipated that he would do something special with them.    Off the first ball of the master's over a leg-bye was run.    Mike took guard.    Mr. Downing was a bowler with a style of his own. He took two short  steps, two long steps, gave a jump, took three more short steps, and  ended with a combination of step and jump, during which the ball emerged  from behind his back and started on its slow career to the wicket. The  whole business had some of the dignity of the old-fashioned minuet,  subtly blended with the careless vigor of a cakewalk. The ball, when  delivered, was billed to break from leg, but the program was subject to  alterations.    If the spectators had expected Mike to begin any firework effects with  the first ball, they were disappointed. He played the over through with  a grace worthy of his brother Joe. The last ball he turned to leg for  a single.    His treatment of Adair's next over was freer. He had got a sight of the  ball now. Halfway through the over a beautiful square cut forced a  passage through the crowd by the pavilion, and dashed up against the  rails. He drove the sixth ball past"]]]
