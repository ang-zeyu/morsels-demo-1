These important advantages D'Artagnan found to his  own taste in the Rue Tiquetonne at the sign of the Roe.    From the time D'Artagnan took quarters in that hotel, the mistress of  the house, a pretty and fresh looking Flemish woman, twenty-five or  twenty-six years old, had been singularly interested in him; and after  certain love passages, much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to  whom a dozen times D'Artagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword  through his body, that husband had disappeared one fine morning, after  furtively selling certain choice lots of wine, carrying away with him  money and jewels. He was thought to be dead; his wife, especially, who  cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow, stoutly maintained  that death had taken him. Therefore, after the connection had continued  three years, carefully fostered by D'Artagnan, who found his bed and his  mistress more agreeable every year, each doing credit to the other, the  mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and  proposed to D'Artagnan that he should marry her.    \"Ah, fie!\" D'Artagnan replied. \"Bigamy, my dear! Come now, you don't  really wish it?\"    \"But he is dead; I am sure of it.\"    \"He was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us  hanged.\"    \"All right; if he comes back you will kill him, you are so skillful and  so brave.\"    \"Peste! my darling! another way of getting hanged.\"    \"So you refuse my request?\"    \"To be sure I do--furiously!\"    The pretty landlady was desolate. She would have taken D'Artagnan not  only as her husband, but as her God, he was so handsome and had so  fierce a mustache.    Then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of Franche-Comte.  D'Artagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart. There  were then great griefs, tears without end and solemn promises to remain  faithful--all of course on the part of the hostess. D'Artagnan was too  grand to promise anything; he purposed only to do all that he could to  increase the glory of his name.    As to that, we know D'Artagnan's courage; he exposed himself freely to  danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball  through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle. He  had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise;  every one, therefore, believed him to be dead, especially those to whom  his death would give promotion. One believes readily what he wishes to  believe. Now in the army, from the division-generals who desire the  death of the general-in-chief, to the soldiers who desire the death of  the corporals, all desire some one's death.    But D'Artagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that. After  he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the  battle-field, the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself. He  gained a village, knocked at the door of the finest house and was  received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in France. He  was petted, tended, cured; and one fine morning, in better health than  ever before, he set out for France. Once in France he turned his course  toward Paris, and reaching Paris went straight to Rue Tiquetonne.    But D'Artagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man,  complete, except for the sword, arranged along the wall.    \"He has returned,\" said he. \"So much the worse, and so much the better!\"    It need not be said that D'Artagnan was still thinking of the husband.  He made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the  mistress had gone for a walk.    \"Alone?\" asked D'Artagnan.    \"With monsieur.\"    \"Monsieur has returned, then?\"    \"Of course,\" naively replied the servant.    \"If I had any money,\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"I would go away; but  I have none. I must stay and follow the advice of my hostess, while  thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition.\"    He had just completed this monologue--which proves that in momentous  circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologue--when the  servant-maid, watching at the door, suddenly cried out:    \"Ah! see! here is madame returning with monsieur.\"    D'Artagnan looked out and at the corner of Rue Montmartre saw the  hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous Swiss, who  tiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him  of his old friend Porthos.    \"Is that monsieur?\" said D'Artagnan to himself. \"Oh! oh! he has grown a  good deal, it seems to me.\" And he sat down in the hall, choosing a  conspicuous place.    The hostess, as she entered, saw D'Artagnan and uttered a little cry,  whereupon D'Artagnan, judging that he had been recognized, rose, ran to  her and embraced her tenderly. The Swiss, with an air of stupefaction,  looked at the hostess, who turned pale.    \"Ah, it is you, monsieur! What do you want of me?\" she asked, in great  distress.    \"Is monsieur your cousin? Is monsieur your brother?\" said D'Artagnan,  not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing. And  without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the  Helvetian, who received him with great coldness.    \"Who is that man?\" he asked.    The hostess replied only by gasps.    \"Who is that Swiss?\" asked D'Artagnan.    \"Monsieur is going to marry me,\" replied the hostess, between two gasps.    \"Your husband, then, is at last dead?\"    \"How does that concern you?\" replied the Swiss.    \"It concerns me much,\" said D'Artagnan, \"since you cannot marry madame  without my consent and since----\"    \"And since?\" asked the Swiss.    \"And since--I do not give it,\" said the musketeer.    The Swiss became as purple as a peony. He wore his elegant uniform,  D'Artagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak; the Swiss was six feet  high, D'Artagnan was hardly more than five; the Swiss considered himself  on his own ground and regarded D'Artagnan as an intruder.    \"Will you go away from here?\" demanded the Swiss, stamping violently,  like a man who begins to be seriously angry.    \"I? By no means!\" said D'Artagnan.    \"Some one must go for help,\" said a lad, who could not comprehend that  this little man should make a stand against that other man, who was so  large.    D'Artagnan, with a sudden accession of wrath, seized the lad by the ear  and led him apart, with the injunction:    \"Stay you where you are and don't you stir, or I will pull this ear off.  As for you, illustrious descendant of William Tell, you will straightway  get together your clothes which are in my room and which annoy me, and  go out quickly to another lodging.\"    The Swiss began to laugh boisterously. \"I go out?\" he said. \"And why?\"    \"Ah, very well!\" said D'Artagnan; \"I see that you understand French.  Come then, and take a turn with me and I will explain.\"    The hostess, who knew D'Artagnan's skill with the sword, began to weep  and tear her hair. D'Artagnan turned toward her, saying, \"Then send him  away, madame.\"    \"Pooh!\" said the Swiss, who had needed a little time to take in  D'Artagnan's proposal, \"pooh! who are you, in the first place, to ask me  to take a turn with you?\"    \"I am lieutenant in his majesty's musketeers,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and  consequently your superior in everything; only, as the question now is  not of rank, but of quarters--you know the custom--come and seek for  yours; the first to return will recover his chamber.\"    D'Artagnan led away the Swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of  the hostess, who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former  lover, though she would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that  haughty musketeer who had affronted her by the refusal of her hand.    It was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle.  D'Artagnan politely begged the Swiss to yield to him the disputed  chamber; the Swiss refused by shaking his head, and drew his sword.    \"Then you will lie here,\" said D'Artagnan. \"It is a wretched bed, but  that is not my fault, and it is you who have chosen it.\" With these  words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary.    He had to contend against a strong wrist, but his agility was superior  to all force. The Swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it, by  reason of the cold; but suddenly feebleness, occasioned by loss of  blood, obliged him to sit down.    \"There!\" said D'Artagnan, \"what did I tell you? Fortunately, you won't  be laid up more than a fortnight. Remain here and I will send you your  clothes by the boy. Good-by! Oh, by the way, you'd better take lodging  in the Rue Montorgueil at the Chat Qui Pelote. You will be well fed  there, if the hostess remains the same. Adieu.\"    Thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the Swiss  the things that belonged to him. The boy found him sitting where  D'Artagnan had left him, still overwhelmed by the coolness of his  adversary.    The boy, the hostess, and all the house had the same regard for  D'Artagnan that one would have for Hercules should he return to earth to  repeat his twelve labors.    But when he was alone with the hostess he said: \"Now, pretty Madeleine,  you know the difference between a Swiss and a gentleman. As for you, you  have acted like a barmaid. So much the worse for you, for by such  conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage. I have driven away the  Swiss to humiliate you, but I shall lodge here no longer. I will not  sleep where I must scorn. Ho, there, boy! Have my valise carried to the  Muid d'Amour, Rue des Bourdonnais. Adieu, madame.\"    In saying these words D'Artagnan appeared at the same time majestic and  grieved. The hostess threw herself at his feet, asked his pardon and  held him back with a sweet violence. What more need be said? The spit  turned, the stove roared, the pretty Madeleine wept; D'Artagnan felt  himself invaded by hunger, cold and love. He pardoned,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12590"],[0,"The Shadow of the Rope (#11)"],[1,"s; the fire still burned brightly, also the  electric-light, though the blind was up and the window filled with a  dull November sky. It was a delicious awakening, recollection was so  slow to come. Rachel might have been ill for days. She experienced the  peace that is left by illness of sufficient gravity. But all she ailed  was a slight headache, quickly removed by an inimitable cup of tea, that  fortified her against the perplexing memories which now came swarming to  her mind. This morning, however, enlightenment was due, and meanwhile  Rachel received a hint, though a puzzling one, from the Swiss maid, as  to the new identity which had been thrust upon her for the time being in  lieu of her own.    \"It was very sad for madame to lose all her things,\" cooed the girl, as  she busied herself about the room.    \"It was irritating,\" Rachel owned, beginning to wonder how much the  other knew.    \"But it was better than losing your life, madame!\" the girl added with a  smile.    And now Rachel lay silent. Could this amiable young woman know all? In  one way Rachel rather hoped it was the case; it would be something to  have received so much kindness and attention, even though bought and  paid for, from one of her own sex who knew all there was to know, and  yet did not shrink from her. But the young woman's next words dismissed  this idea.    \"When so many poor people were drowned!\" said she. And the mystification  increased.    Presently there was a knock at the outer door, which the maid answered,  returning with Mr. Steele's card.    \"Is he there?\" asked Rachel, hastily.    \"No, madame, but one of the servants is waiting for an answer. I think  there is something written on the back, madame.\"    Rachel read the harmless request on the back of the card; nothing could  have been better calculated to turn away suspicion of one sort or  another, and there was obvious design in the absence of an envelope. But  Rachel was not yet in the secret, and she was determined not to wait an  hour longer than she need.    \"What is the time, please?\"    \"I will see, madame.\"    The girl glided out and in.    \"Well?\"    \"A quarter to ten, madame.\"    \"Then order my breakfast for a quarter past, and let Mr. Steele be told  that I shall be delighted to see him at eleven o'clock.\"          CHAPTER VII    A MORNING CALL      \"The way to conceal one's identity,\" observed Mr. Steel, \"is to assume  another as distinctive as one's own.\"    This oracular utterance was confidentially delivered from the leathern  chair at the writing-table, in an inner recess of Rachel's sumptuous  sitting-room. The chair had been wheeled aloof from the table, on which  were Steel's hat and gloves, and such a sheaf of book-stall literature  as suggested his immediate departure upon no short journey, unless,  indeed, the magazines and the Sunday newspapers turned out to be another  offering to Mrs. Minchin, like the nosegay of hothouse flowers which she  still held in her hand. Rachel herself had inadvertently taken the very  easy-chair which was a further feature of the recess; in its cushioned  depths she already felt at a needless disadvantage, with Mr. Steel  bending over her, his strong face bearing down, as it were, upon hers,  and his black eyes riddling her with penetrating glances. But to have  risen now would have been to show him what she felt. So she trifled with  his flowers without looking up, though her eyebrows rose a little on  their own account.    \"I know what you are thinking,\" resumed Steel; \"that you had no desire  to assume any new identity, or for a single moment to conceal your own,  and that I have taken a great deal upon myself. That I most freely  admit. And I think you will forgive me when you see the papers!\"    \"Is there so much about me, then?\" asked Rachel, with a sigh of  apprehension.    \"A leading article in every one of them. But they will keep. Indeed, I  would much rather you never saw them at all.\"    \"Was that why you brought them in, Mr. Steel?\"    The question was irresistible, its satire unconcealed; but Steel's  disregard of it steered admirably clear of contempt.    \"That was why I bought them, certainly,\" he admitted. \"But I brought  them with me for quite a different purpose, for which one would indeed  have been enough. I was saying, however, that the best way to sink one's  identity is to assume another, provided that the second be as  distinctive as the first. We will leave for a moment the question of my  officiousness in the matter, and we'll suppose, for the sake of  argument, that I was authorized by you to do what in fact I have done.  All last week the papers were literally full of your trial, but on  Saturday there was a second sensation as well, and this morning it is  hard to say which is first and which second; they both occupy so many  columns. You may not know it, but the Cape liner due on Saturday was  lost with scores of lives, off Finisterre, on Friday morning last.\"    Rachel failed to see the connection, and yet she felt vaguely that there  was one, if she could but recall it; meanwhile she said nothing, but  listened with as much attention as a mental search would permit.    \"I heard of it first,\" continued Steel, \"late on Friday afternoon, as I  came away from the Old Bailey. Now, it was on Friday afternoon, if you  recollect, that you gave evidence yourself in your own defence. When you  left the witness-box, Mrs. Minchin, and even before you left it, I knew  that you were saved!\"    Rachel remembered the Swiss maid's remark about the loss of her clothes  and the number of persons who had fared so much worse and lost their  lives. But Steel's last words dismissed every thought but that of their  own import. And in an instant she was trembling upright in the  easy-chair.    \"You believed me!\" she whispered. \"You believed me at the time!\"    And for nothing had he earned such gratitude yet; her moist eyes saw the  old-fashioned courtesy of his bow in answer, but not the subtlety of the  smile that bore it company in the depths of the dark eyes: it was a  smile that did not extend to the short, tight mouth.    \"What is more to the point, my dear lady,\" he went on in words, \"the  jury believed you, and I saw that they did. You made a tremendous  impression upon them. The lawyer against you was too humane to try very  hard to remove it, and the judge too just--though your own man did his  best. But I saw at once that it would never be removed. It was between  you and the jury--human being to human beings--and no third legal party  intervening. That was where you scored; you went straight as a die to  those twelve simple hearts. And I saw what you had done--what the  lawyers between them could not undo--and took immediate measures.\"    Rachel looked up with parted lips, only to shut them firmly without a  word.    \"And who was I to take measures on your behalf?\" queried Steel, putting  the question for her. \"What right or excuse had I to mix myself up in  your affairs? I will tell you, for this morning is not last night, and  at least you have one good night's rest between you and the past. My  dear Mrs. Minchin, I had absolutely no right at all; but I had the  excuse which every man has who sees a woman left to stand alone against  the world, and who thrusts himself, no matter how officiously, into the  breach beside her. And then for a week I had seen you all day and every  day, upon your trial!\"    At last there something with a ring of definite insincerity, something  that Rachel could take up; and she gazed upon her self-appointed  champion with candid eyes.    \"Do you mean to say that you never saw me before--my trouble, Mr.  Steel?\"    \"Never in my life, my dear lady.\"    \"Then you knew something about me or mine!\"    \"What one read in the newspapers--neither more nor less--upon my most  solemn word--if that will satisfy you.\"    And it did; for if there had been palpable insincerity in his previous  protestations, there was sincerity of a still more obvious order in Mr.  Steel's downright assurances on these two points. He had never ever  seen her before. He knew nothing whatever about her up to the period of  notoriety; he had no special and no previous knowledge of his own. It  might not be true, of course; but there was that in the deep-set eyes  which convinced Rachel once and for all. There was a sudden light in  them, a light as candid as that which happened to be shining in her own,  but a not too kindly one, rather a glint of genuine resentment. It was  his smooth protestations that Rachel distrusted and disliked. If she  could ruffle him, she might get at the real man; and with her questions  she appeared to have done so already.    \"I am more than satisfied, in one way,\" replied Rachel, \"and less in  another. I rather wish you had known something about me; it would have  made it more natural for you to come to my assistance. But never mind.  What were these immediate measures?\"    \"I took these rooms; I had spoken of taking them earlier in the week.\"    \"For me?\"    \"Yes, on the chance of your getting off.\"    \"But you did not say they were for me!\"    \"No; and I was vague in what I had said until then. I had a daughter--a  widow--whom I rather expected to arrive from abroad towards the end of  the week. But I was quite vague.\"    \"Because you thought I had no chance!\"    \"I had not heard your evidence. The very afternoon I did hear it, and  had no longer any doubt about the issue in my own mind, I also heard of  this wreck. The very thing! I waited till next morning for the list of  the saved; luckily there were plenty of them; and I picked out the name  of a married woman travelling alone, and therefore very possibly a  widow, from the number. Then I went to the manager. The daughter whom I  expected had been wrecked, but she was saved, and would arrive that  night. As a matter of fact, the survivors were picked up by a passing  North German Lloyd, and they did reach"]]]
