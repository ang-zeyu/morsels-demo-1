In fact, the active cells are  passing their daughters into the middle of the process, and these pass  through similar stages as those derived from the ensheathing epidermis. In  other words, the daughter cells of the constituents of the rete Malpighii  which have grown into the corium pass through a degeneration precisely  similar to that undergone by cells shed at desquamation, or those which  eventually give rise by their agglutination to a hair.    This is the real origin of the horny laminae, and the thickness of these is  increased merely by an increase in the area covered by the cells of the  rete Malpighii--i.e., by the development of secondary laminar ridges. If  a section from a foal at term be examined, the processes will be found far  advanced into the corium, and, occupying the axis of each process, will  be seen a horny plate, continuous with the horn of the wall. No line of  demarcation can be observed between the horn so formed and the intertubular  material of the wall. They merge into and blend with each other, with no  indication of their different origins. The cells that have invaded the  corium have thus _not lost their horn-forming function_. There has merely  been an increase in the area for horn-producing cells. The horny processes  are continuous with the hoof proper at the point where the epithelial  ingrowth first commenced to invade the corium, and fuses here with the  horn derived from the cells of the rete Malpighii which have _not_ grown  inwards, and which are found between the processes in the intact foot. From  this it is clear that some considerable portion of the horn of the wall is  derived from the cells of the rete Malpighii covering the corium of the  foot. It becomes even more clear when we remember the prompt appearance of  horn in cases where a portion, or the whole, of the wall has been removed  by operation or by accident (see reported cases in Chapter VII.).    The activity of the cells of the rete Malpighii of the corium covering the  remainder of the foot will be quite as necessary as the activity of the  cells of the coronary papillae which form the horn tubes themselves. 'For,'  in Professor Mettam's own words, 'I am inclined to believe that much of the  \"white line\" which is found uniting the wall of the hoof to the sole has  been derived from the horn formed from the rete of the foot corium. This  origin will explain the absence of pigment from this thin uniting \"line,\"  as it does from the horn lining the interior of the wall. The cells of the  rete are free of colouring matter.'    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--SECTION THROUGH HOOF AND SOFT TISSUES OF A FOAL AT  TERM. The horn of the wall is shown, and the horn-core ('horny laminae') of  the epithelial ingrowth. The latter has advanced far into the corium, and  is now provided with abundant secondary laminar ridges (Mettam).]    From the matter here given us it is easy to understand how, in a macerated  foot, the appearance is given of interlocking of the sensitive and horny  laminae. We see that the horny laminae are ingrowths of the rete Malpighii,  ploughing into and excavating the corium into the shape of leaves--the  sensitive laminae. Putrefactive changes simply break into two separate  portions what originally was one whole, by destroying the cells along its  weakest part. This part is the line of soft protoplasmic cells of the rete  Malpighii. Thus the more resistant parts (the horn on the one hand, and the  corium covering the foot on the other) are easily torn asunder.    As a result of the evidence we have quoted, we are able to answer our  original question in the affirmative. Seeing that the horny and the  sensitive laminae are both portions of the same thing--namely, a modified  skin, in which the epidermis is represented by the horny laminae, and the  corium by the sensitive--it is clear to see that the cells covering the  inspreading horny laminae are dependent for their growth and reproduction  upon the cells with which they are in immediate contact--namely, those  of the sensitive laminae--and that therefore the sensitive laminae are  responsible for the growth of the horny.      B. CHEMICAL PROPERTIES AND HISTOLOGY OF HORN.    Horn is a solid, tenacious, fibrous material, and its density in the hoof  varies in different situations. It is softened by alkalies, such as caustic  potash or soda and ammonia, the parts first attacked being the commissures,  then the frog, and afterwards the sole and wall. Strong acids, such as  sulphuric acid and nitric acid, also dissolve it.    The chemical composition of the hoof shows it to be a modification of  albumin, its analysis yielding water, a large percentage of animal matter,  and materials soluble and insoluble in water. The proportions of these, as  existing in the various parts of the hoof, have been given by Professor  Clement as follows:                                 Wall.    Sole.   Frog.    Water                      16.12     36.0    42.0    Fatty matter                0.95     0.25    0.50    Matters soluble in water    1.04     1.50    1.50    Insoluble salts             0.26     0.25    0.22    Animal matter              81.63     62.0   55.78    Horn appears to be identical with epidermis, hair, wool, feathers, and  whalebone, in yielding 'keratin,' a substance intermediate between albumin  and gelatine, and containing from 60 to 80 per cent. of sulphur.    That horn is combustible everyone who has watched the fitting of a hot shoe  knows. That it is a bad conductor of heat, the absence of bad after-effects  on the foot testifies.    [Illustration: FIG. 31.--PERPENDICULAR SECTION OF HORN OF WALL.]    In a previous page we have described the manner of growth of the horn  tubules, and noted the direction they took in the wall; also, we have  noticed the existence between them of an intertubular horn or cement.    Those who wish to give this subject further study will find an excellent  series of articles by Fleming in the _Veterinarian_ for 1871. We  shall content ourselves here with introducing one or two diagrams and  photo-micrographs, and dealing with the histology very briefly.    Under the microscope the longitudinal striation of the wall is found to be  due to the direction taken by the horn tubules.    Fig. 31 is a magnified perpendicular section of the wall. In it the  parallel dark striae are the horn tubules in longitudinal section. The  lighter striae represent the intertubular material.    Fig. 32 gives us the wall in horizontal section. To the left of this  picture we find the horn tubules cut across, and standing out as so many  concentrically ringed circles. In the centre of the figure are seen the  horny laminae, with their laminellae, and the sensitive laminae. The right  portion of the figure pictures the corium.    [Illustration: FIG. 32.--HORIZONTAL SECTION OF HORN OF WALL.]    Fig. 33 is, again, a horizontal section, cut this time at the junction of  the wall with the sole. To the left are seen, again, the horn tubules of  the wall, and to the centre the horny laminae. In this position, however,  the structures interdigitating with the horny laminae are not sensitive, but  are themselves horny. As the diagram shows, they contain regularly arranged  horn tubules cut across obliquely. It is this horn which forms the 'white  line.' To the extreme right of the figure are seen the horn tubules of the  sole.    There remains now but to notice the arrangement of the horn tubules in the  frog. The peculiar, indiarubber-like toughness of this organ is well known.  Histological examination gives a reason for this.    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--HORIZONTAL SECTION OF HORN THROUGH THE JUNCTION OF  THE WALL WITH THE SOLE. _a_, Horn tubule of the wall; _b_, horn tubule of  the sole; _c, d_, horny laminae.]    [Illustration: FIG. 34.--SECTION OF FROG THROUGH CORIUM AND HORN. The long  finger-like projections of corium into epidermis are sections of the long  papillae from which the horn-tubes of the sole grow. In the stainable  portion of the epidermis are to be clearly seen light and dark streaks  pointing out the alternate strata-like arrangement of cells mentioned in  the text (Mettam).]    The horn tubules of the frog are sinuous in their course. This is accounted  for by the fact that in the horn of the frog there is a large amount of  intertubular material, this having the effect of frequently turning the  horn tubules from the straight. In addition to this, the intertubular  material has a peculiar arrangement of the cells composing it. These  are laid down in alternating striae (1) of cells with their long axes  longitudinal, and (2) of cells with their long axes horizontal. This is  seen in Fig. 34, between the long papillae of the corium, where the lines of  longitudinally arranged cells in horizontal section stand out darker than  the adjoining strata in which their arrangement is horizontal. The tortuous  direction of the horn tubules, and the almost interlocking nature of the  alternating strata of the intertubular material, together combine to give  the frog its characteristic toughness and resiliency.      C. EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION OF THE HOOF.    Among other questions productive of heated argument come those relating to  expansion of the horse's hoof. In the past many observers have strenuously  insisted on the fact that expansion and contraction regularly occur during  progression. Opposed to them have been others equally firm in the belief  that neither took place. Quite within recent times this question also  has been settled once and for all by the experiments of A. Lungwitz, of  Dresden. His conclusions were published in an article entitled 'Changes in  Form of the Hoof under the Action of the Body-weight.'[A]    [Footnote A: _Journal of Comparative Pathology and Therapeutics_, vol.  iv."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11212"],[0,"Modern India (#11)"],[1,"                    1,290,961    Bankers, money lenders, etc.                     1,200,998    Tailors, milliners and dressmakers               1,142,153    Officers of the civil service                    1,043,872    Water carriers                                   1,089,574    Oil pressers                                     1,055,933    Dairy men, milk and butter dealers               1,013,000    The enormous number of 1,563,000, which is equal to the population of  half our states, are engaged in what the census terms \"disreputable\"  occupations. There are about eighty other classes, but none of  them embraces more than a million members.    Among the curiosities of the census we find that 603,741 people  are engaged in making and selling sweetmeats, and 550,241 in selling  cardamon seeds and betel leaves, and 548,829 in manufacturing  and selling bangles, necklaces, beads and sacred threads. There  are 497,509 teachers and professors, 562,055 actors, singers  and dancers, 520,044 doctors and 279,646 lawyers.    The chewing of betel leaves is one of the peculiar customs of  the country, even more common than tobacco chewing ever was with  us. At almost every street corner, in the porticos of the temples,  at the railway stations and in the parks, you will see women and  men, squatting on the ground behind little trays covered with  green leaves, powdered nuts and a white paste, made of the ashes  of cocoanut fiber, the skins of potatoes and a little lime. They  take a leaf, smear it with the lime paste, which is intended  to increase the saliva, and then wrap it around the powder of  the betel nut. Natives stop at these stands, drop a copper, pick  up one of these folded leaves, put it in their mouths, and go  off chewing, and spitting out saliva as red as blood. Strangers  are frequently attracted by dark red stains upon pavements and  floors which look as if somebody had suffered from a hemorrhage or  had opened an artery, but they are only traces of the chewers of  the betel nut. The habit is no more harmful than chewing tobacco.  The influence of the juice is slightly stimulating to the nerves,  but not injurious, although it is filthy and unclean.    It is a popular impression that the poor of India live almost  exclusively upon rice, which is very cheap and nourishing, hence  it is possible for a family to subsist upon a few cents a day.  This is one of the many delusions that are destroyed when you  visit the country. Rice in India is a luxury that can be afforded  only by the people of good incomes, and throughout four-fifths of  the country is sold at prices beyond the reach of common working  people. Sixty per cent. of the population live upon wheat, barley,  fruit, various kinds of pulses and maize. Rice can be grown only in  hot and damp climates, where there are ample means of irrigation,  and only where the conditions of soil, climate and water supply  allow its abundant production does it enter into the diet of the  working classes. Three-fourths of the people are vegetarians,  and live upon what they produce themselves.    The density of the population is very great, notwithstanding  the enormous area of the empire, being an average of 167 to the  square mile, including mountains, deserts and jungles, as against  21.4 to the square mile in the United States. Bengal, the province  of which Calcutta is the capital, on the eastern coast of India,  is the most densely populated, having 588 people to the square  mile. Behar in the south has 548, Oudh in the north 531; Agra,  also in the north, 419, and Bombay 202. Some parts of India have  a larger population to the acre than any other part of the world.  The peasants, or coolies, as they are called, are born and live  and die like animals. Indeed animals seldom are so closely herded  together, or live such wretched lives. In 1900, 54,000,000 people  were more or less affected by the famine, and 5,607,000 were fed  by the government for several months, simply because there was  no other way for them to obtain food. There was no labor they  could perform for wages, and those who were fortunate enough to  secure employment could not earn enough to buy bread to satisfy  the hunger of their families. It is estimated that 30,000,000  human beings starved to death in India during the nineteenth  century, and in one year alone, the year in which that good woman,  Queen Victoria, assumed the title of empress, more than 5,000,000  of her subjects died from hunger. Yet the population without  immigration is continually increasing from natural causes. The  net increase during the ten years from 1891 to 1901 was 7,046,385.  The, struggle for life is becoming greater every year; wages are  going down instead of up, notwithstanding the rapid increase  of manufacturing industries, the extension of the railway system  and other sources of wealth and employment that are being rapidly  developed.    More than 200,000,000 persons in India are living upon less than  5 cents a day of our money; more than 100,000,000 are living  upon less than 3 cents; more than 50,000,000 upon less than 1  cent and at least two-thirds of the entire population do not  have food enough during any year of their lives to supply the  nourishment demanded by the human system. As I have already shown,  there are only two acres of land under cultivation for each  inhabitant of India. This includes gardens, parks and pastures,  and it is not evenly distributed. In many parts of the country,  millions are compelled to live upon an average of one-fourth  of an acre of land and millions more upon half an acre each,  whereas an average of five acres of agricultural land per capita  of population is believed to be necessary to the prosperity of  a nation.    Few countries have such an enormous birth rate and death rate.  Nowhere else are babies born in such enormous numbers, and nowhere  does death reap such awful harvests. Sometimes a single famine or  plague suddenly sweeps millions into eternity, and their absence  is scarcely noticed. Before the present sanitary regulations and  inspections were introduced the death rate was nearly double  what it is now; indeed, some experts estimate that it must have  been several times as great, but no records were kept in some  of the provinces, and in most of them, they were incomplete and  inaccurate. India is now in a healthier condition than ever before,  and yet the death rate varies from 31.10 per 1,000 in the cold  provinces of Agra and Oudh to 82.7 per 1,000 in the tropical  regions of Behar. In Bombay last year the rate was 70.07 per  1,000; in the central provinces 56.75; in the Punjab, which has  a wide area in northwestern India, it was 47.7 and in Bengal  36.63.    The birth rate is almost as large, the following table being reported  from the principal provinces named:                        Births per                     Births per                      1,000 pop.                     1,000 pop.    Behar                   50.5   Burmah                  37.4    Punjab                  48.4   Bombay                  36.3    Agra                    48.9   Assam                   35.4    Central provinces       47.3   Madras                  31.3    Bengal                  42.9    Even with the continual peril from plague and famine, the government  does not encourage emigration, as you think would be considered  a wise policy, but retards it by all sorts of regulations and  restrictions, and it is difficult to drive the Hindus out of  the wretched hovels in which they live and thrive and breed like  rats or rabbits. The more wretched and comfortless a home, the  more attached the natives are to it. The less they have to leave  the more reluctant they are to leave it, but the same rule applies  to every race and every nation in the south of Europe and the  Turkish Empire, in Syria, Egypt, the East India Islands, and  wherever the population is dense and wages are low. It is the  semi-prosperous middle class who emigrate in the hope of bettering  their condition.    There is less emigration from India than from any other country.  During the last twenty years the total number of persons emigrating  from the Indian Empire was only 316,349, less than come to the  United States annually from Italy, and the statistics show that  138,660 of these persons returned to their former homes during  that period, leaving the net emigration since 1882 only 177,689  out of 300,000,000 of population. And most of these settled in  other British colonies. We have a few Hindu merchants and Parsees  in the United States, but no coolies whatever. The coolies are  working classes that have gone to British Guiana, Trinidad, Jamaica  and other West Indies, Natal, East Africa, Fiji and other British  possessions in the Pacific. There has been a considerable flow  of workmen back and forth between India and Burma and Ceylon,  for in those provinces labor is scarce, wages are high and large  numbers of Hindus are employed in the rice paddies and tea  plantations.    The government prevents irregular emigration. It has a \"protectorate  of emigrants\" who is intrusted with the enforcement of the laws.  Natives of India are not permitted to leave the country unless  they are certain of obtaining employment at the place where they  desire to go, and even then each intending emigrant must file  a copy of his contract with the commissioner in order that he  may be looked after in his new home, for the Indian government  always sends an agent to protect the interests of its coolies to  every country where they have gone in any considerable numbers.  Every intending emigrant must submit to a medical examination also,  for the navigation laws prohibit vessels from taking aboard any  native who does not show a certificate from an official that he  is in full possession of his health and faculties and physically  fit to earn his living in a strange country.
