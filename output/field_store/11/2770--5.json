[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8492"],[0,"The King in Yellow (#10)"],[1,"the doctor stepped swiftly into the room,  saying--\"Ah, the fever!\" I seized Jack Scott and hurried him to the  street, saying, \"Boris would rather be alone.\" We crossed the street to  our own apartments, and that night, seeing I was going to be ill too, he  went for the doctor again. The last thing I recollect with any  distinctness was hearing Jack say, \"For Heaven's sake, doctor, what ails  him, to wear a face like that?\" and I thought of _The King in  Yellow_ and the Pallid Mask.    I was very ill, for the strain of two years which I had endured since  that fatal May morning when Genevieve murmured, \"I love you, but I think  I love Boris best,\" told on me at last. I had never imagined that it  could become more than I could endure. Outwardly tranquil, I had deceived  myself. Although the inward battle raged night after night, and I, lying  alone in my room, cursed myself for rebellious thoughts unloyal to Boris  and unworthy of Genevieve, the morning always brought relief, and I  returned to Genevieve and to my dear Boris with a heart washed clean by  the tempests of the night.    Never in word or deed or thought while with them had I betrayed my sorrow  even to myself.    The mask of self-deception was no longer a mask for me, it was a part of  me. Night lifted it, laying bare the stifled truth below; but there was  no one to see except myself, and when the day broke the mask fell back  again of its own accord. These thoughts passed through my troubled mind  as I lay sick, but they were hopelessly entangled with visions of white  creatures, heavy as stone, crawling about in Boris' basin,--of the wolf's  head on the rug, foaming and snapping at Genevieve, who lay smiling  beside it. I thought, too, of the King in Yellow wrapped in the fantastic  colours of his tattered mantle, and that bitter cry of Cassilda, \"Not  upon us, oh King, not upon us!\" Feverishly I struggled to put it from me,  but I saw the lake of Hali, thin and blank, without a ripple or wind to  stir it, and I saw the towers of Carcosa behind the moon. Aldebaran, the  Hyades, Alar, Hastur, glided through the cloud-rifts which fluttered and  flapped as they passed like the scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow.  Among all these, one sane thought persisted. It never wavered, no matter  what else was going on in my disordered mind, that my chief reason for  existing was to meet some requirement of Boris and Genevieve. What this  obligation was, its nature, was never clear; sometimes it seemed to be  protection, sometimes support, through a great crisis. Whatever it seemed  to be for the time, its weight rested only on me, and I was never so ill  or so weak that I did not respond with my whole soul. There were always  crowds of faces about me, mostly strange, but a few I recognized, Boris  among them. Afterward they told me that this could not have been, but I  know that once at least he bent over me. It was only a touch, a faint  echo of his voice, then the clouds settled back on my senses, and I lost  him, but he _did_ stand there and bend over me _once_ at least.    At last, one morning I awoke to find the sunlight falling across my bed,  and Jack Scott reading beside me. I had not strength enough to speak  aloud, neither could I think, much less remember, but I could smile  feebly, as Jack's eye met mine, and when he jumped up and asked eagerly  if I wanted anything, I could whisper, \"Yes--Boris.\" Jack moved to the  head of my bed, and leaned down to arrange my pillow: I did not see his  face, but he answered heartily, \"You must wait, Alec; you are too weak to  see even Boris.\"    I waited and I grew strong; in a few days I was able to see whom I would,  but meanwhile I had thought and remembered. From the moment when all the  past grew clear again in my mind, I never doubted what I should do when  the time came, and I felt sure that Boris would have resolved upon the  same course so far as he was concerned; as for what pertained to me  alone, I knew he would see that also as I did. I no longer asked for any  one. I never inquired why no message came from them; why during the week  I lay there, waiting and growing stronger, I never heard their name  spoken. Preoccupied with my own searchings for the right way, and with my  feeble but determined fight against despair, I simply acquiesced in  Jack's reticence, taking for granted that he was afraid to speak of them,  lest I should turn unruly and insist on seeing them. Meanwhile I said  over and over to myself, how would it be when life began again for us  all? We would take up our relations exactly as they were before Genevieve  fell ill. Boris and I would look into each other's eyes, and there would  be neither rancour nor cowardice nor mistrust in that glance. I would be  with them again for a little while in the dear intimacy of their home,  and then, without pretext or explanation, I would disappear from their  lives for ever. Boris would know; Genevieve--the only comfort was that  she would never know. It seemed, as I thought it over, that I had found  the meaning of that sense of obligation which had persisted all through  my delirium, and the only possible answer to it. So, when I was quite  ready, I beckoned Jack to me one day, and said--    \"Jack, I want Boris at once; and take my dearest greeting to  Genevieve....\"    When at last he made me understand that they were both dead, I fell into  a wild rage that tore all my little convalescent strength to atoms. I  raved and cursed myself into a relapse, from which I crawled forth some  weeks afterward a boy of twenty-one who believed that his youth was gone  for ever. I seemed to be past the capability of further suffering, and  one day when Jack handed me a letter and the keys to Boris' house, I took  them without a tremor and asked him to tell me all. It was cruel of me to  ask him, but there was no help for it, and he leaned wearily on his thin  hands, to reopen the wound which could never entirely heal. He began very  quietly--    \"Alec, unless you have a clue that I know nothing about, you will not be  able to explain any more than I what has happened. I suspect that you  would rather not hear these details, but you must learn them, else I  would spare you the relation. God knows I wish I could be spared the  telling. I shall use few words.    \"That day when I left you in the doctor's care and came back to Boris, I  found him working on the 'Fates.' Genevieve, he said, was sleeping under  the influence of drugs. She had been quite out of her mind, he said. He  kept on working, not talking any more, and I watched him. Before long, I  saw that the third figure of the group--the one looking straight ahead,  out over the world--bore his face; not as you ever saw it, but as it  looked then and to the end. This is one thing for which I should like to  find an explanation, but I never shall.    \"Well, he worked and I watched him in silence, and we went on that way  until nearly midnight. Then we heard the door open and shut sharply, and  a swift rush in the next room. Boris sprang through the doorway and I  followed; but we were too late. She lay at the bottom of the pool, her  hands across her breast. Then Boris shot himself through the heart.\" Jack  stopped speaking, drops of sweat stood under his eyes, and his thin  cheeks twitched. \"I carried Boris to his room. Then I went back and let  that hellish fluid out of the pool, and turning on all the water, washed  the marble clean of every drop. When at length I dared descend the steps,  I found her lying there as white as snow. At last, when I had decided  what was best to do, I went into the laboratory, and first emptied the  solution in the basin into the waste-pipe; then I poured the contents of  every jar and bottle after it. There was wood in the fire-place, so I  built a fire, and breaking the locks of Boris' cabinet I burnt every  paper, notebook and letter that I found there. With a mallet from the  studio I smashed to pieces all the empty bottles, then loading them into  a coal-scuttle, I carried them to the cellar and threw them over the  red-hot bed of the furnace. Six times I made the journey, and at last,  not a vestige remained of anything which might again aid in seeking for  the formula which Boris had found. Then at last I dared call the doctor.  He is a good man, and together we struggled to keep it from the public.  Without him I never could have succeeded. At last we got the servants  paid and sent away into the country, where old Rosier keeps them quiet  with stones of Boris' and Genevieve's travels in distant lands, from  whence they will not return for years. We buried Boris in the little  cemetery of Sevres. The doctor is a good creature, and knows when to pity  a man who can bear no more. He gave his certificate of heart disease and  asked no questions of me.\"    Then, lifting his head from his hands, he said, \"Open the letter, Alec;  it is for us both.\"    I tore it open. It was Boris' will dated a year before. He left  everything to Genevieve, and in case of her dying childless, I was to  take control of the house in the Rue Sainte-Cecile, and Jack Scott the  management at Ept. On our deaths the property reverted to his mother's  family in Russia, with the exception of the sculptured marbles executed  by himself. These he left to me.    The page blurred under our eyes, and Jack got up and walked to the  window. Presently he returned and sat down again. I dreaded to hear what  he was going to say, but he spoke with the same simplicity and  gentleness.    \"Genevieve lies before the Madonna in the marble room. The Madonna bends  tenderly above her, and Genevieve smiles back into that calm face that  never would have been except for her.\"    His voice broke, but he grasped my hand, saying, \"Courage, Alec.\" Next  morning he left for Ept to fulfil his trust.          IV    The same evening I took the keys and went into the house I had known so  well. Everything"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/85"],[0,"The Beasts of Tarzan (#10)"],[1,"with a little  squall of wind their terror broke all bounds, and, leaping to their  feet, they all but overturned the boat before Akut and Tarzan together  could quiet them.  At last calm was restored, and eventually the apes  became accustomed to the strange antics of their craft, after which no  more trouble was experienced with them.    The trip was uneventful, the wind held, and after ten hours' steady  sailing the black shadows of the coast loomed close before the  straining eyes of the ape-man in the bow.  It was far too dark to  distinguish whether they had approached close to the mouth of the  Ugambi or not, so Tarzan ran in through the surf at the closest point  to await the dawn.    The dugout turned broadside the instant that its nose touched the sand,  and immediately it rolled over, with all its crew scrambling madly for  the shore.  The next breaker rolled them over and over, but eventually  they all succeeded in crawling to safety, and in a moment more their  ungainly craft had been washed up beside them.    The balance of the night the apes sat huddled close to one another for  warmth; while Mugambi built a fire close to them over which he  crouched.  Tarzan and Sheeta, however, were of a different mind, for  neither of them feared the jungle night, and the insistent craving of  their hunger sent them off into the Stygian blackness of the forest in  search of prey.    Side by side they walked when there was room for two abreast.  At other  times in single file, first one and then the other in advance.  It was  Tarzan who first caught the scent of meat--a bull buffalo--and  presently the two came stealthily upon the sleeping beast in the midst  of a dense jungle of reeds close to a river.    Closer and closer they crept toward the unsuspecting beast, Sheeta upon  his right side and Tarzan upon his left nearest the great heart.  They  had hunted together now for some time, so that they worked in unison,  with only low, purring sounds as signals.    For a moment they lay quite silent near their prey, and then at a sign  from the ape-man Sheeta sprang upon the great back, burying his strong  teeth in the bull's neck.   Instantly the brute sprang to his feet with  a bellow of pain and rage, and at the same instant Tarzan rushed in  upon his left side with the stone knife, striking repeatedly behind the  shoulder.    One of the ape-man's hands clutched the thick mane, and as the bull  raced madly through the reeds the thing striking at his life was  dragged beside him.  Sheeta but clung tenaciously to his hold upon the  neck and back, biting deep in an effort to reach the spine.    For several hundred yards the bellowing bull carried his two savage  antagonists, until at last the blade found his heart, when with a final  bellow that was half-scream he plunged headlong to the earth.  Then  Tarzan and Sheeta feasted to repletion.    After the meal the two curled up together in a thicket, the man's black  head pillowed upon the tawny side of the panther.   Shortly after dawn  they awoke and ate again, and then returned to the beach that Tarzan  might lead the balance of the pack to the kill.    When the meal was done the brutes were for curling up to sleep, so  Tarzan and Mugambi set off in search of the Ugambi River.   They had  proceeded scarce a hundred yards when they came suddenly upon a broad  stream, which the Negro instantly recognized as that down which he and  his warriors had paddled to the sea upon their ill-starred expedition.    The two now followed the stream down to the ocean, finding that it  emptied into a bay not over a mile from the point upon the beach at  which the canoe had been thrown the night before.    Tarzan was much elated by the discovery, as he knew that in the  vicinity of a large watercourse he should find natives, and from some  of these he had little doubt but that he should obtain news of Rokoff  and the child, for he felt reasonably certain that the Russian would  rid himself of the baby as quickly as possible after having disposed of  Tarzan.    He and Mugambi now righted and launched the dugout, though it was a  most difficult feat in the face of the surf which rolled continuously  in upon the beach; but at last they were successful, and soon after  were paddling up the coast toward the mouth of the Ugambi.  Here they  experienced considerable difficulty in making an entrance against the  combined current and ebb tide, but by taking advantage of eddies close  in to shore they came about dusk to a point nearly opposite the spot  where they had left the pack asleep.    Making the craft fast to an overhanging bough, the two made their way  into the jungle, presently coming upon some of the apes feeding upon  fruit a little beyond the reeds where the buffalo had fallen.  Sheeta  was not anywhere to be seen, nor did he return that night, so that  Tarzan came to believe that he had wandered away in search of his own  kind.    Early the next morning the ape-man led his band down to the river, and  as he walked he gave vent to a series of shrill cries.  Presently from  a great distance and faintly there came an answering scream, and a  half-hour later the lithe form of Sheeta bounded into view where the  others of the pack were clambering gingerly into the canoe.    The great beast, with arched back and purring like a contented tabby,  rubbed his sides against the ape-man, and then at a word from the  latter sprang lightly to his former place in the bow of the dugout.    When all were in place it was discovered that two of the apes of Akut  were missing, and though both the king ape and Tarzan called to them  for the better part of an hour, there was no response, and finally the  boat put off without them.   As it happened that the two missing ones  were the very same who had evinced the least desire to accompany the  expedition from the island, and had suffered the most from fright  during the voyage, Tarzan was quite sure that they had absented  themselves purposely rather than again enter the canoe.    As the party were putting in for the shore shortly after noon to search  for food a slender, naked savage watched them for a moment from behind  the dense screen of verdure which lined the river's bank, then he  melted away up-stream before any of those in the canoe discovered him.    Like a deer he bounded along the narrow trail until, filled with the  excitement of his news, he burst into a native village several miles  above the point at which Tarzan and his pack had stopped to hunt.    \"Another white man is coming!\" he cried to the chief who squatted  before the entrance to his circular hut.   \"Another white man, and with  him are many warriors.   They come in a great war-canoe to kill and rob  as did the black-bearded one who has just left us.\"    Kaviri leaped to his feet.  He had but recently had a taste of the  white man's medicine, and his savage heart was filled with bitterness  and hate.  In another moment the rumble of the war-drums rose from the  village, calling in the hunters from the forest and the tillers from  the fields.    Seven war-canoes were launched and manned by paint-daubed, befeathered  warriors.  Long spears bristled from the rude battle-ships, as they  slid noiselessly over the bosom of the water, propelled by giant  muscles rolling beneath glistening, ebony hides.    There was no beating of tom-toms now, nor blare of native horn, for  Kaviri was a crafty warrior, and it was in his mind to take no chances,  if they could be avoided.  He would swoop noiselessly down with his  seven canoes upon the single one of the white man, and before the guns  of the latter could inflict much damage upon his people he would have  overwhelmed the enemy by force of numbers.    Kaviri's own canoe went in advance of the others a short distance, and  as it rounded a sharp bend in the river where the swift current bore it  rapidly on its way it came suddenly upon the thing that Kaviri sought.    So close were the two canoes to one another that the black had only an  opportunity to note the white face in the bow of the oncoming craft  before the two touched and his own men were upon their feet, yelling  like mad devils and thrusting their long spears at the occupants of the  other canoe.    But a moment later, when Kaviri was able to realize the nature of the  crew that manned the white man's dugout, he would have given all the  beads and iron wire that he possessed to have been safely within his  distant village.   Scarcely had the two craft come together than the  frightful apes of Akut rose, growling and barking, from the bottom of  the canoe, and, with long, hairy arms far outstretched, grasped the  menacing spears from the hands of Kaviri's warriors.    The blacks were overcome with terror, but there was nothing to do other  than to fight.  Now came the other war-canoes rapidly down upon the two  craft.  Their occupants were eager to join the battle, for they thought  that their foes were white men and their native porters.    They swarmed about Tarzan's craft; but when they saw the nature of the  enemy all but one turned and paddled swiftly up-river.   That one came  too close to the ape-man's craft before its occupants realized that  their fellows were pitted against demons instead of men.  As it touched  Tarzan spoke a few low words to Sheeta and Akut, so that before the  attacking warriors could draw away there sprang upon them with a  blood-freezing scream a huge panther, and into the other end of their  canoe clambered a great ape.    At one end the panther wrought fearful havoc with his mighty talons and  long, sharp fangs, while Akut at the other buried his yellow canines in  the necks of those that came within his reach, hurling the  terror-stricken blacks overboard as he made his way toward the centre  of the canoe.    Kaviri was so busily engaged with the demons that had entered his own  craft that he could offer no assistance to his"]]]
