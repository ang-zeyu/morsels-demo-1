[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1188"],[0,"The Lair of the White Worm (#11)"],[1,"Nathaniel came in, shutting the door behind him.    \"I have come,\" he said, \"while we have an opportunity of being alone, to  tell you something of the Caswall family which I think will interest you.  There is, or used to be, a belief in this part of the world that the  Caswall family had some strange power of making the wills of other  persons subservient to their own.  There are many allusions to the  subject in memoirs and other unimportant works, but I only know of one  where the subject is spoken of definitely.  It is _Mercia and its  Worthies_, written by Ezra Toms more than a hundred years ago.  The  author goes into the question of the close association of the then Edgar  Caswall with Mesmer in Paris.  He speaks of Caswall being a pupil and the  fellow worker of Mesmer, and states that though, when the latter left  France, he took away with him a vast quantity of philosophical and  electric instruments, he was never known to use them again.  He once made  it known to a friend that he had given them to his old pupil.  The term  he used was odd, for it was 'bequeathed,' but no such bequest of Mesmer  was ever made known.  At any rate the instruments were missing, and never  turned up.\"    A servant came into the room to tell Adam that there was some strange  noise coming from the locked room into which he had gone when he came in.  He hurried off to the place at once, Sir Nathaniel going with him.  Having  locked the door behind them, Adam opened the packing-case where the boxes  of the two mongooses were locked up.  There was no sound from one of  them, but from the other a queer restless struggling.  Having opened both  boxes, he found that the noise was from the Nepaul animal, which,  however, became quiet at once.  In the other box the new mongoose lay  dead, with every appearance of having been strangled!          CHAPTER X--THE KITE      On the following day, a little after four o'clock, Adam set out for  Mercy.    He was home just as the clocks were striking six.  He was pale and upset,  but otherwise looked strong and alert.  The old man summed up his  appearance and manner thus: \"Braced up for battle.\"    \"Now!\" said Sir Nathaniel, and settled down to listen, looking at Adam  steadily and listening attentively that he might miss nothing--even the  inflection of a word.    \"I found Lilla and Mimi at home.  Watford had been detained by business  on the farm.  Miss Watford received me as kindly as before; Mimi, too,  seemed glad to see me.  Mr. Caswall came so soon after I arrived, that  he, or someone on his behalf, must have been watching for me.  He was  followed closely by the negro, who was puffing hard as if he had been  running--so it was probably he who watched.  Mr. Caswall was very cool  and collected, but there was a more than usually iron look about his face  that I did not like.  However, we got on very well.  He talked pleasantly  on all sorts of questions.  The nigger waited a while and then  disappeared as on the other occasion.  Mr. Caswall's eyes were as usual  fixed on Lilla.  True, they seemed to be very deep and earnest, but there  was no offence in them.  Had it not been for the drawing down of the  brows and the stern set of the jaws, I should not at first have noticed  anything.  But the stare, when presently it began, increased in  intensity.  I could see that Lilla began to suffer from nervousness, as  on the first occasion; but she carried herself bravely.  However, the  more nervous she grew, the harder Mr. Caswall stared.  It was evident to  me that he had come prepared for some sort of mesmeric or hypnotic  battle.  After a while he began to throw glances round him and then  raised his hand, without letting either Lilla or Mimi see the action.  It  was evidently intended to give some sign to the negro, for he came, in  his usual stealthy way, quietly in by the hall door, which was open.  Then  Mr. Caswall's efforts at staring became intensified, and poor Lilla's  nervousness grew greater.  Mimi, seeing that her cousin was distressed,  came close to her, as if to comfort or strengthen her with the  consciousness of her presence.  This evidently made a difficulty for Mr.  Caswall, for his efforts, without appearing to get feebler, seemed less  effective.  This continued for a little while, to the gain of both Lilla  and Mimi.  Then there was a diversion.  Without word or apology the door  opened, and Lady Arabella March entered the room.  I had seen her coming  through the great window.  Without a word she crossed the room and stood  beside Mr. Caswall.  It really was very like a fight of a peculiar kind;  and the longer it was sustained the more earnest--the fiercer--it grew.  That combination of forces--the over-lord, the white woman, and the black  man--would have cost some--probably all of them--their lives in the  Southern States of America.  To us it was simply horrible.  But all that  you can understand.  This time, to go on in sporting phrase, it was  understood by all to be a 'fight to a finish,' and the mixed group did  not slacken a moment or relax their efforts.  On Lilla the strain began  to tell disastrously.  She grew pale--a patchy pallor, which meant that  her nerves were out of order.  She trembled like an aspen, and though she  struggled bravely, I noticed that her legs would hardly support her.  A  dozen times she seemed about to collapse in a faint, but each time, on  catching sight of Mimi's eyes, she made a fresh struggle and pulled  through.    \"By now Mr. Caswall's face had lost its appearance of passivity.  His  eyes glowed with a fiery light.  He was still the old Roman in  inflexibility of purpose; but grafted on to the Roman was a new Berserker  fury.  His companions in the baleful work seemed to have taken on  something of his feeling.  Lady Arabella looked like a soulless, pitiless  being, not human, unless it revived old legends of transformed human  beings who had lost their humanity in some transformation or in the sweep  of natural savagery.  As for the negro--well, I can only say that it was  solely due to the self-restraint which you impressed on me that I did not  wipe him out as he stood--without warning, without fair play--without a  single one of the graces of life and death.  Lilla was silent in the  helpless concentration of deadly fear; Mimi was all resolve and  self-forgetfulness, so intent on the soul-struggle in which she was  engaged that there was no possibility of any other thought.  As for  myself, the bonds of will which held me inactive seemed like bands of  steel which numbed all my faculties, except sight and hearing.  We seemed  fixed in an _impasse_.  Something must happen, though the power of  guessing was inactive.  As in a dream, I saw Mimi's hand move restlessly,  as if groping for something.  Mechanically it touched that of Lilla, and  in that instant she was transformed.  It was as if youth and strength  entered afresh into something already dead to sensibility and intention.  As if by inspiration, she grasped the other's band with a force which  blenched the knuckles.  Her face suddenly flamed, as if some divine light  shone through it.  Her form expanded till it stood out majestically.  Lifting her right hand, she stepped forward towards Caswall, and with a  bold sweep of her arm seemed to drive some strange force towards him.  Again and again was the gesture repeated, the man falling back from her  at each movement.  Towards the door he retreated, she following.  There  was a sound as of the cooing sob of doves, which seemed to multiply and  intensify with each second.  The sound from the unseen source rose and  rose as he retreated, till finally it swelled out in a triumphant peal,  as she with a fierce sweep of her arm, seemed to hurl something at her  foe, and he, moving his hands blindly before his face, appeared to be  swept through the doorway and out into the open sunlight.    \"All at once my own faculties were fully restored; I could see and hear  everything, and be fully conscious of what was going on.  Even the  figures of the baleful group were there, though dimly seen as through a  veil--a shadowy veil.  I saw Lilla sink down in a swoon, and Mimi throw  up her arms in a gesture of triumph.  As I saw her through the great  window, the sunshine flooded the landscape, which, however, was  momentarily becoming eclipsed by an onrush of a myriad birds.\"    By the next morning, daylight showed the actual danger which threatened.  From every part of the eastern counties reports were received concerning  the enormous immigration of birds.  Experts were sending--on their own  account, on behalf of learned societies, and through local and imperial  governing bodies--reports dealing with the matter, and suggesting  remedies.    The reports closer to home were even more disturbing.  All day long it  would seem that the birds were coming thicker from all quarters.  Doubtless many were going as well as coming, but the mass seemed never to  get less.  Each bird seemed to sound some note of fear or anger or  seeking, and the whirring of wings never ceased nor lessened.  The air  was full of a muttered throb.  No window or barrier could shut out the  sound, till the ears of any listener became dulled by the ceaseless  murmur.  So monotonous it was, so cheerless, so disheartening, so  melancholy, that all longed, but in vain, for any variety, no matter how  terrible it might be.    The second morning the reports from all the districts round were more  alarming than ever.  Farmers began to dread the coming of winter as they  saw the dwindling of the timely fruitfulness of the earth.  And as yet it  was only a warning of evil, not the evil accomplished; the ground began  to look bare whenever some passing sound temporarily frightened the  birds.    Edgar Caswall tortured his brain for a long time unavailingly, to think  of some means of getting rid of what he, as well as his neighbours, had  come to regard as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11880"],[0,"Ronicky Doone (#11)"],[1," the adventure he wondered more  and more what he could possibly gain by it. But still he went on, and,  in spite of the danger, it is doubtful if Ronicky would have willingly  changed places with any man in the world at that moment.    At least there was not the slightest sense in remaining on the lower  floor of the house. He slipped down the shadow of the main stairs,  swiftly circled through the danger of the light of the lower hall lamp  and started his ascent. Still the carpet muffled every sound which  he made in climbing, and the solid construction of the house did not  betray him with a single creaking noise.    He reached the first hall. This, beyond doubt, was where he would find  the room of the man who sneered--the archenemy, as Ronicky Doone was  beginning to think of him. A shiver passed through his lithe, muscular  body at the thought of that meeting.    He opened the first door to his left. It was a small closet for brooms  and dust cloths and such things. Determining to be methodical he went  to the extreme end of the hall and tried that door. It was  locked, but, while his hand was still on the knob, turning it in  disappointment, a door, higher up in the house, opened and a hum  of voices passed out to him. They grew louder, they turned to the  staircase from the floor above and commenced to descend at a running  pace. Three or four men at least, there must be, by the sound, and  perhaps more!    Ronicky started for the head of the stairs to make his retreat,  but, just as he reached there, the party turned into the hall and  confronted him.          Chapter Ten      _Mistaken Identity_    To flee down the stairs now would be rank folly. If there happened to  be among these fellows a man of the type of him who sneered, a bullet  would catch the fugitive long before he reached the bottom of the  staircase. And, since he could not retreat, Ronicky went slowly and  steadily ahead, for, certainly, if he stood still, he would be spoken  to. He would have to rely now on the very dim light in this hall and  the shadow of his cap obscuring his face. If these were roomers,  perhaps he would be taken for some newcomer.    But he was hailed at once, and a hand was laid on his shoulder.    \"Hello, Pete. What's the dope?\"    Ronicky shrugged the hand away and went on.    \"Won't talk, curse him. That's because the plant went fluey.\"    \"Maybe not; Pete don't talk much, except to the old man.\"    \"Lemme get at him,\" said a third voice. \"Beat it down to Rooney's. I'm  going up with Pete and get what he knows.\"    And, as Ronicky turned onto the next flight of the stairway, he was  overtaken by hurrying feet. The other two had already scurried down  toward the front door of the house.    \"I got some stuff in my room, Pete,\" said the friendly fellow who  had overtaken him. \"Come up and have a jolt, and we can have a talk.  'Lefty' and Monahan think you went flop on the job, but I know better,  eh? The old man always picks you for these singles; he never gives me  a shot at 'em.\" Then he added: \"Here we are!\" And, opening a door in  the first hall, he stepped to the center of the room and fumbled at  a chain that broke loose and tinkled against glass; eventually he  snapped on an electric light. Ronicky Doone saw a powerfully built,  bull-necked man, with a soft hat pulled far down on his head. Then the  man turned.    It was much against the grain for Ronicky Doone to attack a man by  surprise, but necessity is a stern ruler. And the necessity which made  him strike made him hit with the speed of a snapping whiplash and the  weight of a sledge hammer. Before the other was fully turned that  iron-hard set of knuckles crashed against the base of his jaw.    He fell without a murmur, without a struggle, Ronicky catching him in  his arms to break the weight of the fall. It was a complete knock-out.  The dull eyes, which looked up from the floor, saw nothing. The  square, rather brutal, face was relaxed as if in sleep, but here was  the type of man who would recuperate with great speed.    Ronicky set about the obvious task which lay before him, as fast as he  could. In the man's coat pocket he found a handkerchief which, hard  knotted, would serve as a gag. The window curtain was drawn with a  stout, thick cord. Ronicky slashed off a convenient length of it and  secured the hands and feet of his victim, before he turned the fellow  on his face.    Next he went through the pockets of the unconscious man who was only  now beginning to stir slightly, as life returned after that stunning  blow.    It was beginning to come to Ronicky that there was a strange relation  between the men of this house. Here were three who apparently started  out to work at night, and yet they were certainly not at all the type  of night clerks or night-shift engineers or mechanics. He turned over  the hand of the man he had struck down. The palm was as soft as his  own.    No, certainly not a laborer. But they were all employed by \"the old  man.\" Who was he? And was there some relation between all of these and  the man who sneered?    At least Ronicky determined to learn all that could be read in  the pockets of his victim. There was only one thing. That was a  stub-nosed, heavy automatic.    It was enough to make Ronicky Doone sigh with relief. At least he had  not struck some peaceful, law-abiding fellow. Any man might carry a  gun--Ronicky himself would have been uncomfortable without some sort  of weapon about him but there are guns and guns. This big, ugly  automatic seemed specially designed to kill swiftly and surely.    He was considering these deductions when a tap came on the door.  Ronicky groaned. Had they come already to find out what kept the  senseless victim so long?    \"Morgan, oh, Harry Morgan!\" called a girl's voice.    Ronicky Doone started. Perhaps--who could tell--this might be Caroline  Smith herself, come to tap at the door when he was on the very verge  of abandoning the adventure. Suppose it were someone else?    If he ventured out expecting to find Gregg's lady and found instead  quite another person--well, women screamed at the slightest  provocation, and, if a woman screamed in this house, it seemed  exceedingly likely that she would rouse a number of men carrying just  such short-nosed, ugly automatics as that which he had just taken from  the pocket of Harry Morgan.    In the meantime he must answer something. He could not pretend that  the room was empty, for the light must be showing around the door.    \"Harry!\" called the voice of the girl again. \"Do you hear me? Come  out! The chief wants you!\" And she rattled the door.    Fear that she might open it and, stepping in, see the senseless figure  on the floor, alarmed Ronicky. He came close to the door.    \"Well?\" he demanded, keeping his voice deep, like the voice of Harry  Morgan, as well as he could remember it.    \"Hurry! The chief, I tell you!\"    He snapped out the light and turned resolutely to the door. He felt  his faithful Colt, and the feel of the butt was like the touch of a  friendly hand before he opened the door.    She was dressed in white and made a glimmering figure in the darkness  of the hall, and her hair glimmered, also, almost as if it possessed  a light and a life of its own. Ronicky Doone saw that she was a very  pretty girl, indeed. Yes, it must be Caroline Smith. The very perfume  of young girlhood breathed from her, and very sharply and suddenly he  wondered why he should be here to fight the battle of Bill Gregg in  this matter--Bill Gregg who slept peacefully and stupidly in the room  across the street!    She had turned away, giving him only a side glance, as he came out.  \"I don't know what's on, something big. The chief's going to give you  your big chance--with me.\"    Ronicky Doone grunted.    \"Don't do that,\" exclaimed the girl impatiently. \"I know you think  Pete is the top of the world, but that doesn't mean that you can make  a good imitation of him. Don't do it, Harry. You'll pass by yourself.  You don't need a make-up, and not Pete's on a bet.\"    They reached the head of the stairs, and Ronicky Doone paused. To go  down was to face the mysterious chief whom he had no doubt was the old  man to whom Harry Morgan had already referred. In the meantime the  conviction grew that this was indeed Caroline Smith. Her free-and-easy  way of talk was exactly that of a girl who might become interested in  a man whom she had never seen, merely by letters.    \"I want to talk to you,\" said Ronicky, muffling his voice. \"I want to  talk to you alone.\"    \"To me?\" asked the girl, turning toward him. The light from the hall  lamp below gave Ronicky the faintest hint of her profile.    \"Yes.\"    \"But the chief?\"    \"He can wait.\"    She hesitated, apparently drawn by curiosity in one direction, but  stopped by another thought. \"I suppose he can wait, but, if he gets  stirred up about it--oh, we'll, I'll talk to you--but nothing foolish,  Harry. Promise me that?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Slip into my room for a minute.\" She led the way a few steps down  the hall, and he followed her through the door, working his mind  frantically in an effort to find words with which to open his speech  before she should see that he was not Harry Morgan and cry out to  alarm the house. What should he say? Something about Bill Gregg at  once, of course. That was the thing.    The electric light snapped on at the far side of the room. He saw  a dressing table, an Empire bed covered with green-figured silk, a  pleasant rug on the floor, and, just as he had gathered an impression  of delightful femininity from these furnishings, the girl turned from  the lamp on the dressing table, and he saw--not Caroline Smith, but a  bronze-haired beauty, as different from Bill Gregg's lady as day is  from night.          Chapter Eleven      _A Cross-Examination_    He was conscious then only of green-blue eyes, very wide, very bright,  and lips that parted on a word and froze"]]]
