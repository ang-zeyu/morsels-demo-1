I hope I shall not be obliged to leave the poor old  horse behind, but I very much fear that I shall have to do so if nothing  turns up to-morrow. The country is still the same. This is dreadful work!    Saturday, 14th August, Dense Scrub. Started at 8.15 on the same bearing,  165 degrees. At ten miles came upon some green feed for the horses, and  gave them the benefit of it for the rest of the day. Bonney still very  bad. For the last two miles we have had no sand hills, but very dense  mallee and tea-tree, with a light sandy soil with a little limestone,  also salt bush and pig-face in abundance. No water.    Sunday, 15th August, Dense Mallee Scrub. Started at 8.45 on same bearing,  165 degrees. At two miles and a half changed our course to 225 degrees,  having found some fresh horse-tracks; at seven miles camped for the  remainder of the day to recruit the horses, having come upon some new  green grass. Distance actually travelled, fifteen miles.    Monday, 16th August, Dense Mallee Scrub. Started at 9 on a course of 205  degrees. Twelve miles to Miller's Water. I intended to have given the  horses two days' rest here, but there is not sufficient water; there are  only three holes in the limestone rock, and the thirsty animals have  nearly drunk it all: there will not be enough for them in the morning.  The country that we have come through yesterday and to-day resembles the  scrub between Franklin Harbour and Port Lincoln--mallee with grassy  plains occasionally--only the mallee is larger, and the plains are met  with at shorter intervals, more numerous and of larger extent. The soil  is good but light, being produced by decomposed limestone, of which the  low range to the north-west is composed. I am unable to go to Fowler's  Bay as I intended; our provisions are exhausted, and the horses unable to  do the journey. I must now shape my course for Streaky Bay to get  something to eat.    Tuesday, 17th August, Miller's Water. Watered our horses from a  waterproof with a quart pot. Started at 9.15, our course 160 degrees, six  miles to Bectimah Gaip. For the first three miles the grassy plains are  very good, and seem to run a considerable distance between belts of large  mallee, in some places wider than in others, and seem to be connected by  small gaips; I think water could be easily obtained by digging. The last  three miles to the coast is very dense small mallee. Actual distance,  twelve miles. I intend to give the horses a rest to-morrow. I regret  exceedingly that I was unable to make Fowler's Bay. It is with difficulty  that I have been able to save Bonney; he is still very weak and unable to  do a day's journey; we can scarcely get him to do the short journeys we  have been doing lately. For upwards of a month we have been existing upon  two pounds and a half of flour cake daily, without animal food. Since we  commenced the journey, all the animal food we have been able to obtain  has been four wallabies, one opossum, one small duck, one pigeon, and  latterly a few kangaroo mice, which were very welcome; we were anxious to  find more, but we soon got out of their country.    These kangaroo mice are elegant little animals, about four inches in  length, and resemble the kangaroo in shape, with a long tail terminating  with a sort of brush. Their habitations are of a conical form, built with  twigs and rotten wood, about six feet in diameter at the base, and rising  to a height of three or four feet. When the natives discover one of these  nests they surround it, treading firmly round the base in order to secure  any outlet; they then remove the top of the cone, and, as the mice  endeavour to escape, they kill them with the waddies which they use with  such unfailing skill. When the nest is found by only a few natives, they  set fire to the top of the cone, and thus secure the little animals with  ease. For the last month we have been reduced to one meal a-day, and that  a very small one, which has exhausted us both very much and made us  almost incapable of exertion. We have now only TWO meals left to take us  to Streaky Bay, which is distant from this place ONE HUNDRED MILES. We  have been forced to boil the tops of the pigface, to satisfy the wants of  nature. Being short of water, we boiled them in their own juice. To a  hungry man they were very palatable, and, had they been boiled in fresh  water, would have made a good vegetable. Yesterday we obtained a few  sow-thistles, which we boiled, and found to be very good.    Wednesday, 18th August, Bectimah Gaip. Rested the horses and obtained a  few shell-fish from the beach: there are very few, which was a  disappointment to us.    Thursday, 19th August, Bectimah Gaip. Started at 8 a.m. for Streaky Bay.  I managed to get thirty miles to-day, which is a great help. I only hope  that Mr. Gibson is at Streaky Bay, so that we may be able to get  something to eat; we must endure three days' more starving before we  shall be able to reach there.    Friday, 20th August, Smoky Bay. Started at 7.15. Mallee scrub in some  places very dense, in others open, with good grassy plains at intervals,  in which I think water could be had by digging; very few birds about, and  those small. At twenty-five miles we got some rock water. Distance  to-day, thirty-five miles.    Saturday, 21st August, Small Grassy Plains. Started at 7.30 on a  south-easterly course. Got a little water in the limestone rock for our  horses. Camped on the shore at Streaky Bay at sundown. The last sixteen  miles were through very dense scrub; the former part through scrub with  good grassy plains at intervals. Distance, thirty-eight miles.    Sunday, 22nd August, On the Shore at Streaky Bay. Started at 11 a.m. to  make Mr. Gibson's station. The horses did not arrive until 10.30, as they  had gone back on their tracks of yesterday. During the time Forster was  after them, I managed to shoot a crow, and cooked him in the ashes. We  had him for breakfast--the first food we have had for the last three  days; it was very agreeable to taste and stomach, for we were beginning  to feel the cravings of nature rather severely. I hope Mr. Gibson will be  at the Depot; it will be a fine trouble if he is not, and we have to  travel two hundred and forty miles on the chance of shooting something.  Twenty-four miles to Mr. Gibson's station, where we were received and  treated with great kindness, for which we were very thankful. We enjoyed  a good supper, which, after three days' fasting, as may readily be  imagined, was quite a treat.    Monday, 23rd August, Mr. Gibson's Station. Both Forster and myself felt  very unwell, especially Forster, who is very bad; the sudden change from  a state of starvation to plenty of good and wholesome food has been the  cause. I am suffering chiefly from weakness and a very severe pain  between the shoulder-blades, which I have felt for some weeks back. It is  a dreadful pain, and nearly incapacitated me from sitting in the saddle  all day yesterday; I thought I should not have been able to reach here, I  was so very bad with it. I have been obliged to send down to the next  station, about thirty miles distant, to try and get some horseshoes. I  must rest here a few days to recover.    Tuesday, 24th August, Mr. Gibson's Station. Forster appears to be a  little better this morning, but very weak; I also feel a little better  this morning from yesterday's rest.    Wednesday, 25th August, Mr. Gibson's Station. I have succeeded in getting  some shoes for the horses from Mr. Miller, to whom I am deeply indebted  for his kindness in allowing me to have them.    Thursday, 26th August, Mr. Gibson's Station. Shoeing the horses and  preparing for a start at the beginning of next week.    Friday, 27th August, Mr. Gibson's Station. At the same thing. Improving  in health and strength.    Saturday, 28th August, Mr. Gibson's Station. I have been very unwell all  night.    Sunday, 29th August, Mr. Gibson's Station. Still very ill; unable to do  anything.    Monday, 30th August, Mr. Gibson's Station. The same.    Tuesday, 31st August, Mr. Gibson's Station. I had a dreadful night of it;  seized with cramp in the stomach, and thought I should never see morning;  no medicine to relieve me. I intended to have started to-day, but am  quite unable to do so.    Wednesday, 1st September, Mr. Gibson's Station. Can stay no longer; made  a start to-day, and got as far as one of Mr. Gibson's out-stations,  twenty-five miles. Quite done up.    Thursday, 2nd September, One of Mr. Gibson's Out-Stations. Raining this  morning; unable to proceed. Very unwell.    Friday, 3rd September, Same Place. Feel better this morning. Started at  8.30 for Parla. I am unable to make any attempt to recover the grey mare.  Made Parla at 1 p.m.; camped at ten miles beyond. Distance to-day,  twenty-five miles.    Saturday, 4th September, Ten Miles beyond Parla. Started at 8.15 on an  east bearing twenty-three miles to Rock Water. Camped. Very poor country.  The granite range that Mr. Hack has laid down on his chart, I cannot  find. I have come east from Parla, and ought to have crossed about the  middle of it.    Sunday, 5th September, Rock Water. I shall shape my course for the  Freeling range, and see what that is made of. Started at 7.30 on a  bearing of 84 degrees twenty-two miles. Rock water with plenty of grass.  Gave the horses the rest of the day.    Monday, 6th September, South of Mount Sturt. Started at 8.15 on a bearing  of 84 degrees for twenty-five miles. Changed the bearing to 60 degrees  for three miles to a fine plain covered with grass. Halted. No water.  There are some high hills to the east-north-east, to which I have now  changed my course, and which I conclude to be the Freeling range. Our  journey to-day has been through very scrubby and sandy country,  especially the last fifteen miles.

'Nay,' said Polly. 'We're all here waiting for you.'    'We've got to be up in good time in the morning,' he said, in the  benevolent official manner.    They all laughed.    'Nay,' said Muriel. 'Don't leave us all lonely, John Thomas. Take one!'    'I'll take the lot, if you like,' he responded gallantly.    'That you won't either,' said Muriel, 'Two's company; seven's too much of  a good thing.'    'Nay--take one,' said Laura. 'Fair and square, all above board, and say  which.'    'Ay,' cried Annie, speaking for the first time. 'Pick, John Thomas; let's  hear thee.'    'Nay,' he said. 'I'm going home quiet tonight. Feeling good, for once.'    'Whereabouts?' said Annie. 'Take a good 'un, then. But tha's got to take  one of us!'    'Nay, how can I take one,' he said, laughing uneasily. 'I don't want to  make enemies.'    'You'd only make _one_' said Annie.    'The chosen _one_,' added Laura.    'Oh, my! Who said girls!' exclaimed John Thomas, again turning, as if to  escape. 'Well--good-night.'    'Nay, you've got to make your pick,' said Muriel. 'Turn your face to the  wall, and say which one touches you. Go on--we shall only just touch your  back--one of us. Go on--turn your face to the wall, and don't look, and  say which one touches you.'    He was uneasy, mistrusting them. Yet he had not the courage to break  away. They pushed him to a wall and stood him there with his face to it.  Behind his back they all grimaced, tittering. He looked so comical. He  looked around uneasily.    'Go on!' he cried.    'You're looking--you're looking!' they shouted.    He turned his head away. And suddenly, with a movement like a swift cat,  Annie went forward and fetched him a box on the side of the head that  sent his cap flying and himself staggering. He started round.    But at Annie's signal they all flew at him, slapping him, pinching him,  pulling his hair, though more in fun than in spite or anger. He, however,  saw red. His blue eyes flamed with strange fear as well as fury, and he  butted through the girls to the door. It was locked. He wrenched at it.  Roused, alert, the girls stood round and looked at him. He faced them, at  bay. At that moment they were rather horrifying to him, as they stood in  their short uniforms. He was distinctly afraid.    'Come on, John Thomas! Come on! Choose!' said Annie.    'What are you after? Open the door,' he said.    'We shan't--not till you've chosen!' said Muriel.    'Chosen what?' he said.    'Chosen the one you're going to marry,' she replied.    He hesitated a moment.    'Open the blasted door,' he said, 'and get back to your senses.' He spoke  with official authority.    'You've got to choose!' cried the girls.    'Come on!' cried Annie, looking him in the eye.' Come on! Come on!'    He went forward, rather vaguely. She had taken off her belt, and swinging  it, she fetched him a sharp blow over the head with the buckle end. He  sprang and seized her. But immediately the other girls rushed upon him,  pulling and tearing and beating him. Their blood was now thoroughly up.  He was their sport now. They were going to have their own back, out of  him. Strange, wild creatures, they hung on him and rushed at him to bear  him down. His tunic was torn right up the back, Nora had hold at the back  of his collar, and was actually strangling him. Luckily the button burst.  He struggled in a wild frenzy of fury and terror, almost mad terror. His  tunic was simply torn off his back, his shirt-sleeves were torn away, his  arms were naked. The girls rushed at him, clenched their hands on him and  pulled at him: or they rushed at him and pushed him, butted him with all  their might: or they struck him wild blows. He ducked and cringed and  struck sideways. They became more intense.    At last he was down. They rushed on him, kneeling on him. He had neither  breath nor strength to move. His face was bleeding with a long scratch,  his brow was bruised.    Annie knelt on him, the other girls knelt and hung on to him. Their faces  were flushed, their hair wild, their eyes were all glittering strangely.  He lay at last quite still, with face averted, as an animal lies when it  is defeated and at the mercy of the captor. Sometimes his eye glanced  back at the wild faces of the girls. His breast rose heavily, his wrists  were torn.    'Now, then, my fellow!' gasped Annie at length. 'Now then--now--'    At the sound of her terrifying, cold triumph, he suddenly started to  struggle as an animal might, but the girls threw themselves upon him with  unnatural strength and power, forcing him down.    'Yes--now, then!' gasped Annie at length.    And there was a dead silence, in which the thud of heart-beating was to  be heard. It was a suspense of pure silence in every soul.    'Now you know where you are,' said Annie.    The sight of his white, bare arm maddened the girls. He lay in a kind of  trance of fear and antagonism. They felt themselves filled with  supernatural strength.    Suddenly Polly started to laugh--to giggle wildly--helplessly--and Emma  and Muriel joined in. But Annie and Nora and Laura remained the same,  tense, watchful, with gleaming eyes. He winced away from these eyes.    'Yes,' said Annie, in a curious low tone, secret and deadly. 'Yes! You've  got it now! You know what you've done, don't you? You know what you've  done.'    He made no sound nor sign, but lay with bright, averted eyes, and  averted, bleeding face.    'You ought to be _killed_, that's what you ought,' said Annie, tensely.  'You ought to be _killed_.' And there was a terrifying lust in her voice.    Polly was ceasing to laugh, and giving long-drawn Oh-h-hs and sighs as  she came to herself.    'He's got to choose,' she said vaguely.    'Oh, yes, he has,' said Laura, with vindictive decision.    'Do you hear--do you hear?' said Annie. And with a sharp movement, that  made him wince, she turned his face to her.    'Do you hear?' she repeated, shaking him.    But he was quite dumb. She fetched him a sharp slap on the face. He  started, and his eyes widened. Then his face darkened with defiance,  after all.    'Do you hear?' she repeated.    He only looked at her with hostile eyes.    'Speak!' she said, putting her face devilishly near his.    'What?' he said, almost overcome.    'You've got to _choose_!' she cried, as if it were some terrible menace,  and as if it hurt her that she could not exact more.    'What?' he said, in fear.    'Choose your girl, Coddy. You've got to choose her now. And you'll get  your neck broken if you play any more of your tricks, my boy. You're  settled now.'    There was a pause. Again he averted his face. He was cunning in his  overthrow. He did not give in to them really--no, not if they tore him to  bits.    'All right, then,' he said, 'I choose Annie.' His voice was strange and  full of malice. Annie let go of him as if he had been a hot coal.    'He's chosen Annie!' said the girls in chorus.    'Me!' cried Annie. She was still kneeling, but away from him. He was  still lying prostrate, with averted face. The girls grouped uneasily  around.    'Me!' repeated Annie, with a terrible bitter accent.    Then she got up, drawing away from him with strange disgust and  bitterness.    'I wouldn't touch him,' she said.    But her face quivered with a kind of agony, she seemed as if she would  fall. The other girls turned aside. He remained lying on the floor, with  his torn clothes and bleeding, averted face.    'Oh, if he's chosen--' said Polly.    'I don't want him--he can choose again,' said Annie, with the same rather  bitter hopelessness.    'Get up,' said Polly, lifting his shoulder. 'Get up.'    He rose slowly, a strange, ragged, dazed creature. The girls eyed him  from a distance, curiously, furtively, dangerously.    'Who wants him?' cried Laura, roughly.    'Nobody,' they answered, with contempt. Yet each one of them waited for  him to look at her, hoped he would look at her. All except Annie, and  something was broken in her.    He, however, kept his face closed and averted from them all. There was a  silence of the end. He picked up the torn pieces of his tunic, without  knowing what to do with them. The girls stood about uneasily, flushed,  panting, tidying their hair and their dress unconsciously, and watching  him. He looked at none of them. He espied his cap in a corner, and went  and picked it up. He put it on his head, and one of the girls burst into  a shrill, hysteric laugh at the sight he presented. He, however, took no  heed, but went straight to where his overcoat hung on a peg. The girls  moved away from contact with him as if he had been an electric wire. He  put on his coat and buttoned it down. Then he rolled his tunic-rags into  a bundle, and stood before the locked door, dumbly.    'Open the door, somebody,' said Laura.    'Annie's got the key,' said one.    Annie silently offered the key to the girls. Nora unlocked the door.    'Tit for tat, old man,' she said. 'Show yourself a man, and don't bear a  grudge.'    But without a word or sign he had opened the door and gone, his face  closed, his head dropped.    'That'll learn him,' said Laura.    'Coddy!' said Nora.    'Shut up, for God's sake!' cried Annie fiercely, as if in torture.    'Well, I'm about ready to go, Polly. Look sharp!' said Muriel.    The girls were all anxious to be off. They were tidying themselves  hurriedly, with mute, stupefied faces.          _The Blind Man_      Isabel Pervin was listening for two sounds--for the sound of wheels on  the drive outside and for the noise of her husband's footsteps in the  hall. Her dearest and oldest friend, a man who seemed almost  indispensable to her living, would drive up in the rainy dusk of the  closing November day. The trap had gone to fetch him from the station.  And her husband, who had been blinded in Flanders, and who had a  disfiguring mark on "]]]
