[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11224"],[0,"Utilitarianism (#11)"],[1," act of will in the individual instance is not in contradiction to the  general intention prevailing at other times, but in fulfilment of it; as  in the case of the person of confirmed virtue, and of all who pursue  deliberately and consistently any determinate end. The distinction  between will and desire thus understood, is an authentic and highly  important psychological fact; but the fact consists solely in this--that  will, like all other parts of our constitution, is amenable to habit,  and that we may will from habit what we no longer desire for itself, or  desire only because we will it. It is not the less true that will, in  the beginning, is entirely produced by desire; including in that term  the repelling influence of pain as well as the attractive one of  pleasure. Let us take into consideration, no longer the person who has a  confirmed will to do right, but him in whom that virtuous will is still  feeble, conquerable by temptation, and not to be fully relied on; by  what means can it be strengthened? How can the will to be virtuous,  where it does not exist in sufficient force, be implanted or awakened?  Only by making the person _desire_ virtue--by making him think of it in  a pleasurable light, or of its absence in a painful one. It is by  associating the doing right with pleasure, or the doing wrong with pain,  or by eliciting and impressing and bringing home to the person's  experience the pleasure naturally involved in the one or the pain in the  other, that it is possible to call forth that will to be virtuous,  which, when confirmed, acts without any thought of either pleasure or  pain. Will is the child of desire, and passes out of the dominion of its  parent only to come under that of habit. That which is the result of  habit affords no presumption of being intrinsically good; and there  would be no reason for wishing that the purpose of virtue should become  independent of pleasure and pain, were it not that the influence of the  pleasurable and painful associations which prompt to virtue is not  sufficiently to be depended on for unerring constancy of action until it  has acquired the support of habit. Both in feeling and in conduct, habit  is the only thing which imparts certainty; and it is because of the  importance to others of being able to rely absolutely on one's feelings  and conduct, and to oneself of being able to rely on one's own, that the  will to do right ought to be cultivated into this habitual independence.  In other words, this state of the will is a means to good, not  intrinsically a good; and does not contradict the doctrine that nothing  is a good to human beings but in so far as it is either itself  pleasurable, or a means of attaining pleasure or averting pain.    But if this doctrine be true, the principle of utility is proved.  Whether it is so or not, must now be left to the consideration of the  thoughtful reader.          CHAPTER V.      ON THE CONNEXION BETWEEN JUSTICE AND UTILITY.    In all ages of speculation, one of the strongest obstacles to the  reception of the doctrine that Utility or Happiness is the criterion of  right and wrong, has been drawn from the idea of Justice, The powerful  sentiment, and apparently clear perception, which that word recalls with  a rapidity and certainty resembling an instinct, have seemed to the  majority of thinkers to point to an inherent quality in things; to show  that the Just must have an existence in Nature as something  absolute-generically distinct from every variety of the Expedient, and,  in idea, opposed to it, though (as is commonly acknowledged) never, in  the long run, disjoined from it in fact.    In the case of this, as of our other moral sentiments, there is no  necessary connexion between the question of its origin, and that of its  binding force. That a feeling is bestowed on us by Nature, does not  necessarily legitimate all its promptings. The feeling of justice might  be a peculiar instinct, and might yet require, like our other instincts,  to be controlled and enlightened by a higher reason. If we have  intellectual instincts, leading us to judge in a particular way, as well  as animal instincts that prompt us to act in a particular way, there is  no necessity that the former should be more infallible in their sphere  than the latter in theirs: it may as well happen that wrong judgments  are occasionally suggested by those, as wrong actions by these. But  though it is one thing to believe that we have natural feelings of  justice, and another to acknowledge them as an ultimate criterion of  conduct, these two opinions are very closely connected in point of fact.  Mankind are always predisposed to believe that any subjective feeling,  not otherwise accounted for, is a revelation of some objective reality.  Our present object is to determine whether the reality, to which the  feeling of justice corresponds, is one which needs any such special  revelation; whether the justice or injustice of an action is a thing  intrinsically peculiar, and distinct from all its other qualities, or  only a combination of certain of those qualities, presented under a  peculiar aspect. For the purpose of this inquiry, it is practically  important to consider whether the feeling itself, of justice and  injustice, is _sui generis_ like our sensations of colour and taste, or  a derivative feeling, formed by a combination of others. And this it is  the more essential to examine, as people are in general willing enough  to allow, that objectively the dictates of justice coincide with a part  of the field of General Expediency; but inasmuch as the subjective  mental feeling of Justice is different from that which commonly attaches  to simple expediency, and, except in extreme cases of the latter, is far  more imperative in its demands, people find it difficult to see, in  Justice, only a particular kind or branch of general utility, and think  that its superior binding force requires a totally different origin.    To throw light upon this question, it is necessary to attempt to  ascertain what is the distinguishing character of justice, or of  injustice: what is the quality, or whether there is any quality,  attributed in common to all modes of conduct designated as unjust (for  justice, like many other moral attributes, is best defined by its  opposite), and distinguishing them from such modes of conduct as are  disapproved, but without having that particular epithet of  disapprobation applied to them. If, in everything which men are  accustomed to characterize as just or unjust, some one common attribute  or collection of attributes is always present, we may judge whether this  particular attribute or combination of attributes would be capable of  gathering round it a sentiment of that peculiar character and intensity  by virtue of the general laws of our emotional constitution, or whether  the sentiment is inexplicable, and requires to be regarded as a special  provision of Nature. If we find the former to be the case, we shall, in  resolving this question, have resolved also the main problem: if the  latter, we shall have to seek for some other mode of investigating it.           *       *       *       *       *    To find the common attributes of a variety of objects, it is necessary  to begin, by surveying the objects themselves in the concrete. Let us  therefore advert successively to the various modes of action, and  arrangements of human affairs, which are classed, by universal or widely  spread opinion, as Just or as Unjust. The things well known to excite  the sentiments associated with those names, are of a very multifarious  character. I shall pass them rapidly in review, without studying any  particular arrangement.    In the first place, it is mostly considered unjust to deprive any one  of his personal liberty, his property, or any other thing which belongs  to him by law. Here, therefore, is one instance of the application of  the terms just and unjust in a perfectly definite sense, namely, that it  is just to respect, unjust to violate, the _legal rights_ of any one.  But this judgment admits of several exceptions, arising from the other  forms in which the notions of justice and injustice present themselves.  For example, the person who suffers the deprivation may (as the phrase  is) have _forfeited_ the rights which he is so deprived of: a case to  which we shall return presently. But also,    Secondly; the legal rights of which he is deprived, may be rights which  _ought_ not to have belonged to him; in other words, the law which  confers on him these rights, may be a bad law. When it is so, or when  (which is the same thing for our purpose) it is supposed to be so,  opinions will differ as to the justice or injustice of infringing it.  Some maintain that no law, however bad, ought to be disobeyed by an  individual citizen; that his opposition to it, if shown at all, should  only be shown in endeavouring to get it altered by competent authority.  This opinion (which condemns many of the most illustrious benefactors of  mankind, and would often protect pernicious institutions against the  only weapons which, in the state of things existing at the time, have  any chance of succeeding against them) is defended, by those who hold  it, on grounds of expediency; principally on that of the importance, to  the common interest of mankind, of maintaining inviolate the sentiment  of submission to law. Other persons, again, hold the directly contrary  opinion, that any law, judged to be bad, may blamelessly be disobeyed,  even though it be not judged to be unjust, but only inexpedient; while  others would confine the licence of disobedience to the case of unjust  laws: but again, some say, that all laws which are inexpedient are  unjust; since every law imposes some restriction on the natural liberty  of mankind, which restriction is an injustice, unless legitimated by  tending to their good.

I think we may assume that  the Bruges Madonna is the piece which Michelangelo executed for the  Mouscron brothers, and that Condivi was wrong in believing it to have  been cast in bronze. That the statue was sent some time after the  order had been given, appears from the fact that Balducci consigned it  to the heir of John and Alexander, \"as being their property;\" but it  cannot be certain at what exact date it was begun and finished.      IX    While Michelangelo was acquiring immediate celebrity and immortal fame  by these three statues, so different in kind and hitherto unrivalled  in artistic excellence, his family lived somewhat wretchedly at  Florence. Lodovico had lost his small post at the Customs after the  expulsion of the Medici; and three sons, younger than the sculptor,  were now growing up. Buonarroto, born in 1477, had been put to the  cloth-trade, and was serving under the Strozzi in their warehouse at  the Porta Rossa. Giovan-Simone, two years younger (he was born in  1479), after leading a vagabond life for some while, joined Buonarroto  in a cloth-business provided for them by Michelangelo. He was a  worthless fellow, and gave his eldest brother much trouble.  Sigismondo, born in 1481, took to soldiering; but at the age of forty  he settled down upon the paternal farm at Settignano, and annoyed his  brother by sinking into the condition of a common peasant.    The constant affection felt for these not very worthy relatives by  Michelangelo is one of the finest traits in his character. They were  continually writing begging letters, grumbling and complaining. He  supplied them with funds, stinting himself in order to maintain them  decently and to satisfy their wishes. But the more he gave, the more  they demanded; and on one or two occasions, as we shall see in the  course of this biography, their rapacity and ingratitude roused his  bitterest indignation. Nevertheless, he did not swerve from the path  of filial and brotherly kindness which his generous nature and steady  will had traced. He remained the guardian of their interests, the  custodian of their honour, and the builder of their fortunes to the  end of his long life. The correspondence with his father and these  brothers and a nephew, Lionardo, was published in full for the first  time in 1875. It enables us to comprehend the true nature of the man  better than any biographical notice; and I mean to draw largely upon  this source, so as gradually, by successive stipplings, as it were, to  present a miniature portrait of one who was both admirable in private  life and incomparable as an artist.    This correspondence opens in the year 1497. From a letter addressed to  Lodovico under the date August 19, we learn that Buonarroto had just  arrived in Rome, and informed his brother of certain pecuniary  difficulties under which the family was labouring. Michelangelo gave  advice, and promised to send all the money he could bring together.  \"Although, as I have told you, I am out of pocket myself, I will do my  best to get money, in order that you may not have to borrow from the  Monte, as Buonarroto says is possible. Do not wonder if I have  sometimes written irritable letters; for I often suffer great distress  of mind and temper, owing to matters which must happen to one who is  away from home.... In spite of all this, I will send you what you ask  for, even should I have to sell myself into slavery.\" Buonarroto must  have paid a second visit to Rome; for we possess a letter from  Lodovico to Michelangelo, under date December 19, 1500, which throws  important light upon the latter's habits and designs. The old man  begins by saying how happy he is to observe the love which  Michelangelo bears his brothers. Then he speaks about the  cloth-business which Michelangelo intends to purchase for them.  Afterwards, he proceeds as follows: \"Buonarroto tells me that you live  at Rome with great economy, or rather penuriousness. Now economy is  good, but penuriousness is evil, seeing that it is a vice displeasing  to God and men, and moreover injurious both to soul and body. So long  as you are young, you will be able for a time to endure these  hardships; but when the vigour of youth fails, then diseases and  infirmities make their appearance; for these are caused by personal  discomforts, mean living, and penurious habits. As I said, economy is  good; but, above all things, shun stinginess. Live discreetly well,  and see you have what is needful. Whatever happens, do not expose  yourself to physical hardships; for in your profession, if you were  once to fall ill (which God forbid), you would be a ruined man. Above  all things, take care of your head, and keep it moderately warm, and  see that you never wash: have yourself rubbed down, but do not wash.\"  This sordid way of life became habitual with Michelangelo. When he was  dwelling at Bologna in 1506, he wrote home to his brother Buonarroto:  \"With regard to Giovan-Simone's proposed visit, I do not advise him to  come yet awhile, for I am lodged here in one wretched room, and have  bought a single bed, in which we all four of us (_i.e_., himself and  his three workmen) sleep.\" And again: \"I am impatient to get away from  this place, for my mode of life here is so wretched, that if you only  knew what it is, you would be miserable.\" The summer was intensely hot  at Bologna, and the plague broke out. In these circumstances it seems  miraculous that the four sculptors in one bed escaped contagion.  Michelangelo's parsimonious habits were not occasioned by poverty or  avarice. He accumulated large sums of money by his labour, spent it  freely on his family, and exercised bountiful charity for the welfare  of his soul. We ought rather to ascribe them to some constitutional  peculiarity, affecting his whole temperament, and tinging his  experience with despondency and gloom. An absolute insensibility to  merely decorative details, to the loveliness of jewels, stuffs, and  natural objects, to flowers and trees and pleasant landscapes, to  everything, in short, which delighted the Italians of that period, is  a main characteristic of his art. This abstraction and aridity, this  ascetic devotion of his genius to pure ideal form, this almost  mathematical conception of beauty, may be ascribed, I think, to the  same psychological qualities which determined the dreary conditions of  his home-life. He was no niggard either of money or of ideas; nay,  even profligate of both. But melancholy made him miserly in all that  concerned personal enjoyment; and he ought to have been born under  that leaden planet Saturn rather than Mercury and Venus in the house  of Jove. Condivi sums up his daily habits thus: \"He has always been  extremely temperate in living, using food more because it was  necessary than for any pleasure he took in it; especially when he was  engaged upon some great work; for then he usually confined himself to  a piece of bread, which he ate in the middle of his labour. However,  for some time past, he has been living with more regard to health, his  advanced age putting this constraint upon his natural inclination.  Often have I heard him say: 'Ascanio, rich as I may have been, I have  always lived like a poor man.' And this abstemiousness in food he has  practised in sleep also; for sleep, according to his own account,  rarely suits his constitution, since he continually suffers from pains  in the head during slumber, and any excessive amount of sleep deranges  his stomach. While he was in full vigour, he generally went to bed  with his clothes on, even to the tall boots, which he has always worn,  because of a chronic tendency to cramp, as well as for other reasons.  At certain seasons he has kept these boots on for such a length of  time, that when he drew them off the skin came away together with the  leather, like that of a sloughing snake. He was never stingy of cash,  nor did he accumulate money, being content with just enough to keep  him decently; wherefore, though innumerable lords and rich folk have  made him splendid offers for some specimen of his craft, he rarely  complied, and then, for the most part, more out of kindness and  friendship than with any expectation of gain.\" In spite of all this,  or rather because of his temperance in food and sleep and sexual  pleasure, together with his manual industry, he preserved excellent  health into old age.    I have thought it worth while to introduce this general review of  Michelangelo's habits, without omitting some details which may seem  repulsive to the modern reader, at an early period of his biography,  because we ought to carry with us through the vicissitudes of his long  career and many labours an accurate conception of our hero's  personality. For this reason it may not be unprofitable to repeat what  Condivi says about his physical appearance in the last years of his  life. \"Michelangelo is of a good complexion; more muscular and bony  than fat or fleshy in his person: healthy above all things, as well by  reason of his natural constitution as of the exercise he takes, and  habitual continence in food and sexual indulgence. Nevertheless, he  was a weakly child, and has suffered two illnesses in manhood. His  countenance always showed a good and wholesome colour. Of stature he  is as follows: height middling; broad in the shoulders; the rest of  the body somewhat slender in proportion. The shape of his face is  oval, the space above the ears being one sixth higher than a  semicircle. Consequently the temples project beyond the ears, and the  ears beyond the cheeks, and these beyond the rest; so that the skull,  in relation to the whole head, must be called large. The forehead,  seen in front, is square; the nose, a little flattened--not by nature,  but because, when he was a young boy, Torrigiano de' Torrigiani, a  brutal and insolent fellow, smashed in the cartilage with his fist.  Michelangelo was carried home"]]]
