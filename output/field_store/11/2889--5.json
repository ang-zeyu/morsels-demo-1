And, O foremost of kings,  directly I heard it with a heart sore agitated by grief, have I speedily  come here wishing to see thee, O king! Alas! O bull of the Bharata race,  ye have all fallen into dire distress! I see thee with thy brothers  plunged in misfortune!'\"      SECTION XIV    \"Yudhishthira said, 'O Krishna, why wert thou absent (from the Anartta  country)? And, O descendant of the Vrishni race, while thou wert away,  where didst thou dwell? And what didst thou do while out of thy  kingdom?'    \"Krishna said, 'O bull of the Bharata race, I had gone for the purpose  of destroying the (ranging) city Salwa. And, O foremost of the  Kauravas, listen to the reasons I had for so doing! The heroic son of  Damaghosha, the well-known king Sisupala of mighty arms and great  energy, was slain by me, O best of Bharatas, at thy _Rajasuya_  sacrifice, because that wicked one could not from anger bear to see the  first worship offered to me! Hearing that he had been slain, Salwa,  burning with fierce anger, came to Dwaraka, while, O Bharata, it was  empty, myself being away, residing with you here. And having arrived  there on a car made of precious metals and hence called the _Souva_, he  had an encounter with the youthful princes of the Vrishni race--those  bulls of that line--and fought with them mercilessly. And slaughtering  many youthful Vrishnis of heroic valour, the wicked one devastated all  the gardens of the city. And, O thou of mighty arms, he said, \"Where is  that wretch of the Vrishni race, Vasudeva, the evil-souled son of  Vasudeva? I will humble in battle the pride of that person so eager for  fight! Tell me truly, _O Anarttas_! I will go there where he is. And  after killing that slayer of Kansa and Kesi, will I return! By my weapon  I swear that I will not return without slaying him!\" And exclaiming  repeatedly--_Where is he? Where is he?_ the lord of Saubha rusheth to  this place and that, desirous of encountering me in battle. And Salwa  also said, \"Impelled by wrath for the destruction of Sisupala I shall  today send to the mansion of Yama that treacherous miscreant of mean  mind.\" And, O king, he further said, \"That Janardana shall I slay, who,  wretch that he is, hath killed my brother who was but a boy of tender  years, and who was slain not on the field of battle, unprepared as he  was!\" Having, O great king, wailed thus, and having, O son of the Kuru  race, abused me thus, he rose into the sky on his car of precious metals  capable of going anywhere at will! On returning (to my kingdom) I heard  what, O Kaurava, the evil-minded and wicked king of Maticka had said  regarding myself! And, O descendant of the Kuru race, I was agitated  with wrath, and, O king, having reflected upon everything, I set my  heart upon slaying him! And, learning, O Kauravya, of his oppression of  the _Anarttas_, of his abuse of myself, and of his excessive arrogance,  I resolved upon the destruction of that wretch! And, O lord of earth, I  accordingly set out (from my city), for slaying the (lord of) the  Saubha. And searching him here and there, I found him in an island in  the midst of the ocean! Then, O king, blowing my conch called the  _Panchajanya_ obtained from the sea, and challenging Salwa to combat, I  stood for the fight! At that instant, I had an encounter with numerous  Danavas, all of whom, however, I subdued and prostrated on the ground. O  mighty-armed one, it was owing to this affair that I could not then come  (unto thee)! As soon as I heard of the unfair game of dice at  Hastinapura, I have come here desirous of seeing ye who have been  plunged in distress.'\"      SECTION XV    \"Yudhishthira said, 'O illustrious Vasudeva of mighty arms, tell thou in  detail of the death of the lord of Saubha. My curiosity hath not been  appeased by thy narration.'    \"Vasudeva said, 'O mighty-armed king, hearing that the son of  Srutaslavas (Sisupala) had been slain by me, Salwa, O best of the  Bharata race, came to the city of Dwaravati! And, O son of Pandu, the  wicked king, stationing his forces in array, besieged that city around  and above. And stationing himself in the upper regions, the king began  his fight with the city. And that encounter commenced with a thick  shower of weapons from all sides. And, O bull of the Bharata race, the  city at that time was well-fortified on all sides, according to the  science (of fortification), with pennons, and arches, and combatants,  and walls and turrets, and engines, and miners, and streets barricaded  with spiked wood-works and towers and edifices with gate-ways  well-filled with provisions, and engines for hurling burning brands and  fires, and vessels of deer-skins (for carrying water), and trumpets,  tabors, and drums, lances and forks, and _Sataghnis_, and plough-shares,  rockets, balls of stone and battle-axes and other weapons and shield  embossed with iron, and engines for hurling balls and bullets and hot  liquids! And the city was also well-defended by numerous cars, and, O  tiger among Kurus, by Gada and Shamva and Uddhava and others, and by  warriors of prowess tried in battle, all well-born and capable of  encountering any foe! And these all placing themselves on commanding  posts, aided by cavalry and standard-bearers, began to defend the town.  And Ugrasena and Uddhava and others, to prevent carelessness, proclaimed  throughout the city that nobody should drink. And all the Vrishnis and  the Andhakas, well-knowing that they would be slain by Salwa if they  behaved carelessly, remained sober and watchful. And the police soon  drove out of the city all mimes and dancers and singers of the Anartta  country. And all the bridges over rivers were destroyed, and boats  forbidden to ply, and the trenches (around the city) were spiked with  poles at the bottom. And the land around the city for full two miles was  rendered uneven, and holes and pits were dug thereon, and combustibles  were secreted below the surface. Our fort, O sinless one, is naturally  strong and always well-defended and filled with all kinds of weapons!  And in consequence of the preparations made, our city was more prepared  than ever to meet the foe. And, O chief of the Bharatas, in consequence  of all this, the city looked like that of Indra himself. And, O king, at  the time of Salwa's approach, nobody could either enter or leave the  town of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas without presenting the sign that  had been agreed upon. And all the streets of the town and the open  spaces were filled with numerous elephants and horses! And, O thou of  mighty arms, the combatants were all specially gratified with allowances  and wages, and rations, and weapons, and dresses! And amongst the  combatants there was none who was not paid in gold, and none who was not  paid at all, and none who was not somehow obliged, and none who was not  of tried valour! And, O thou of eyes like lotus-leaves, it was thus  Dwaraka, abounding in well-ordered arrangements, was defended by Ahuka  (Ugrasena)!'\"      SECTION XVI    \"Vasudeva continued, 'O king of kings, Salwa, the lord of Saubha, came  towards our city with an immense force consisting of infantry, cavalry  and elephants! And the army headed by king Salwa, consisting of four  kinds of forces, occupied a level ground commanding a copious  water-supply. And forsaking cemeteries and temples dedicated to the  gods, and sacred trees, and grounds covered by ant-hills, that host  occupied every other place. And the roads (leading to the city) were  blocked up by the divisions of the army, and the secret entrances also  were all blocked up by the enemy's camp. And, O Kauravya, like unto the  lord of birds (Garuda), the ruler of Saubha rushed towards Dwaraka,  bringing with him, O bull among men, his host equipped with all kinds of  arms, skilled in all weapons, consisting of a dense display of cars and  elephants and cavalry abounding in banners, and well-paid and well-fed  foot-soldiers possessed of great strength and bearing every mark of  heroism and furnished with wonderful chariots and bows. And beholding  the army of Salwa, the youthful princes of the Vrishni race resolved to  encounter it sallying out of the city. And, O king, Charudeshna, Samva,  and the mighty warrior Pradyumna, O descendant of the Kuru race, sallied  out, ascending on their chariots, and clad in mail, and decked with  ornaments, with colours flying, resolved to encounter the mighty and  countless host of Salwa! And Samva taking up his bows eagerly attacked  on the field of battle Kshemavriddhi, the commander of Salwa's forces  and his chief counsellor also! And, O thou foremost of Bharatas, the son  of Jambavati then began to shower arrows in a continuous stream even as  Indra showereth down rain! And, O mighty king, then Kshemavriddhi, the  commander of Salwa's forces, bore that shower of arrows, immovable as  the Himavat! And, O foremost of kings, Kshemavriddhi on his part,  discharged at Samva a mightier volley of shafts, aided by his powers of  illusion! And dispersing by counter illusion that discharge inspired by  illusion, Samva showered on his (adversary's) car a thousand arrows!  Then pierced by the shafts of Samva and overwhelmed there with those of  Kshemavriddhi, the commander of the hostile host, left the field by the  help of his fleet steed! And when the wicked general of Salwa had left  the field, a mighty Daitya called Vegavat rushed at my son! And, O best  of monarchs, thus attacked, the heroic Samva, the perpetuator of the  Vrishni race, bore that onset of Vegavat, keeping his ground. And, O son  of Kunti, the heroic Samva, of prowess incapable of being baffled,  whirling a quickly-going mace, hurled it speedily at Vegavat! And, O  king, struck with that mace, Vegavat fell down on the ground, like a  weather-beaten and faded lord of the forest of decayed roots!

The family  priest is accordingly consulted and it is decided that a ceremony for  admitting them into caste must be performed. This is done and Krishna and  Balarama are given the customary sacred threads. They are now no longer  cowherds but true Yadavas. At the same time they are given a spiritual  preceptor who instructs them in the sacred texts and manuals of learning.  When they have finished the course, they express their gratitude by  restoring to him his dead son who has been drowned in the sea.    One further obligation springs from their new position. We have seen how  in the epic, the _Mahabharata_, Krishna stands in a special relation to  the Pandavas, the faction which emerges victorious from the great feud.  The mother of the Pandavas is called Kunti and it is Kunti who is the  sister of Krishna's father, Vasudeva. Since he is now with his true  father, rumours concerning Kunti reach Krishna and he learns that along  with her sons, the five Pandavas, she is being harassed by the Kaurava  king, the blind Dhritarashtra, egged on by his son, the evil Duryodhana.  Being now a part of his father's family, Krishna can hardly be indifferent  to the fate of so intimate a relative. Akrura, the leading Yadava  diplomat, whom the tyrant had employed to bring Krishna to Mathura, is  accordingly despatched on yet another mission. He is to visit the Kauravas  and Pandavas, ascertain the facts, console Krishna's aunt, Kunti, and then  return and report. Akrura reaches the Kauravas' capital and discovers that  the rumours are only too correct. Relations between the two families are  strained to breaking point. The blind king is at the mercy of his son,  Duryodhana, and it is the latter who is ceaselessly harrying Kunti and her  sons. A little later, as we have already seen, a final attempt on their  lives will be made, they will be induced to sleep in a new house, the  house will be fired and only by a fortunate chance will the Pandavas  escape to the forest and dwell in safety. This, however, is in the future  and for the moment Kunti and her sons are still at court. Akrura assures  Kunti of Krishna's abiding concern and returns to Mathura. Krishna and  Balarama are perturbed to hear his news, deliberate on whether to  intervene, but decide for the moment to do nothing.    The second adjustment which Krishna has now to make is to reconcile the  cowherds to his permanent departure from them and to wean them from their  passionate adherence to his presence. This is much more difficult. We have  seen how on the journey to Mathura, Krishna has been accompanied by Nanda  and the cowherds and how during the closing struggle with the tyrant they  also have been present. When the fight is finally over, they prepare to  depart, taking it for granted that Krishna and Balarama will come with  them. Krishna has therefore to disillusion Nanda. He breaks the news to  him that it is not he and Yasoda who are actually his parents but Vasudeva  and Devaki. He loads Nanda with jewels and costly dresses and thanks him  again and again for all his loving care. He then explains that he has now  to stay in Mathura for a time to meet his castemen, the Yadavas. Nanda is  greatly saddened by the news. The cowherds strive to dissuade him but  Krishna is adamant. He retains a few cowherds with him, but the rest  return to Brindaban, Krishna promising that after a time he will visit  them. On arrival Nanda strives in vain to console Yasoda and is forced to  tell her that Krishna has now acknowledged Vasudeva as his true father,  that he has probably left Brindaban for good and that his own early  intuition that Krishna was God is correct. Yasoda, as she thinks of her  lost 'son,' is overwhelmed with grief, but recovers when she realizes that  actually he is God. As to the cowgirls, their grief is endless as they  recall Krishna's heart-ensnaring charms.    Such a step is obviously only the first move in what must necessarily be a  long and arduous operation. Finding it impossible to say outright that he  will never see them again, Krishna has committed himself to paying the  cowherds a visit. Yet he realizes that nothing can be gained by such a  step since, if his future lies with the princely Yadavas, any mingling  with the cowherds will merely disrupt this final role. Yet clearly he  cannot just abandon his former associates without any regard at all for  their proper feelings. Weaning is necessary, and it must above all be  gradual. He decides, therefore, that since he himself cannot go, someone  must be sent on his behalf. Accordingly, he instructs a friend, Udho, to  go to Brindaban, meet the cowherds and make excuses for his absence. At  the same time, he must urge the cowgirls to give up regarding Krishna as  their lover but worship him as God. Udho is accordingly dressed in  Krishna's clothes, thereby making him appear a real substitute and is  despatched in Krishna's chariot.    When Udho arrives, he finds Nanda and Yasoda still lamenting Krishna's  absence and the cowgirls still longing for him as their lover. He begs  them to regard Krishna as God--as someone who is constantly near those who  love him even if he cannot be seen. Krishna, he says, has forbidden them  to hope for any further impassioned ecstasies and now requires them to  offer him their devotion only. If they do penance and meditate, Krishna  will never leave them. From the day they commenced thinking of him, none  have been so much loved as they. 'As earth, wind, water, fire, rain dwell  in the body, so Krishna dwells in you; but through the influence of his  delusive power seems to be apart.' Udho's pleading shocks and embitters  the cowgirls. 'How can he talk to us like that?' they ask. 'It is  Krishna's body that we adore, not some invisible idea high up in the sky.  How has Krishna suddenly become invisible and imperceptible, a being  without qualities and form, when all along he has delighted us with his  physical charms. As to penance and meditation, these concern widows. What  woman does penance while her husband is alive? It is all the doing of  Kubja, the girl of Mathura whose charms have captivated Krishna. Were it  not for Kubja and other beauties of Mathura, Krishna would now be with us  in Brindaban. Had we known he would not return, we would never have let  him go.' In such words they repudiate Udho's message, upbraid Krishna for  his fickle conduct and demonstrate with what intensity they still adore  him.    Udho is reduced to silence and can only marvel at the cowgirls' bliss in  abandoning everything to think only of Krishna. Finally they send Krishna  the message--that if he really desires them to abandon loving him with  their bodies and resort to penance, he himself must come and show them how  to do it. Unless he comes, they will die of neglect.    A few days later, Udho returns to Mathura bringing with him milk and  butter as presents to Krishna from Nanda and Yasoda and escorting Rohini,  Vasudeva's other wife and Balarama's mother. He gives Krishna the  cowgirls' message and reports how all Brindaban longs for his return.  'Great King,' he says, 'I cannot tell you how they love you. You are their  life. Night and day they think of you. Their love for you is complete as  perfect worship. I gave them your advice concerning penance, but I have  learnt from them perfect adoration. They will only be content when they  see and touch you again.' Krishna listens and is silent. It is clear that  efforts at weaning the cowgirls from him have so far failed and something  further must be attempted.    Yet his resolve to sever all connections with his former life remains and  it is perhaps symbolic of his purpose that he now recalls the hunch-back  girl, Kubja, takes Udho with him and in a single ecstatic visit becomes  her lover. As he reaches her house, the girl greets him with delight,  takes him inside and seats him on a couch of flowers. Udho stays outside  and then while Krishna waits, the girl quickly bathes, scents herself,  combs her hair and changes her dress. Then 'with gaiety and endearment'  she approaches Krishna. Krishna, however, takes her by the hand and  places her near him. Their passions rise and the two achieve the utmost  bliss. Krishna then leaves her, rejoins Udho and 'blushing and smiling'  returns home.    The third step which Krishna must take is to deal with the political and  military situation which has arisen from the slaying of the tyrant. We  have seen how Kansa, although actually begotten by a demon was officially  a son of Ugrasena, the king of Mathura, and as one of his many demon acts,  had dethroned his father and seized the kingdom for himself. Ugrasena is  still alive and the obvious course, therefore, is to reinstate him on the  throne. Ugrasena, however, is unwilling to assume power and he and the  other Yadavas implore Krishna to accept the title for himself. Krishna,  however, has no desire to become king. He therefore overcomes Ugrasena's  hesitations and in due course the latter is enthroned.    This settles the succession problem, but almost immediately a graver issue  arises. During his reign of terror, Kansa had made war on Jarasandha, king  of Magadha. He had defeated him but as part of the peace terms had taken  two of his daughters as queens. These have now been widowed by his death  and repairing to their father's court, they rail bitterly against Krishna  and beg their father to avenge their husband's death. Jarasandha, although  a former rival of Kansa, is also a demon and can therefore summon to his  aid a number of demon allies. Great armies are accordingly mobilized.  Mathura is surrounded and the Yadavas are in dire peril. Krishna and  Balarama, however, are undismayed. They attack the foes single-handed and  by dint of their supernatural powers, utterly rout them. Jarasandha is"]]]
