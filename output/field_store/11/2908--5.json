BAKED CHOPPED HERRING    Soak herring one hour in water and then one and a half in sweet milk,  skin, bone and chop; cut up a medium-sized onion, fry in butter until  golden brown, add a cup of cream, two egg yolks and one-fourth cup of  white bread crumbs, then put in a little more cream. Butter pan,  sprinkle with crumbs or cracker dust, then put in herring, pepper  slightly. Bake in moderate oven three-quarters of an hour.      MARINIRTE (PICKLED) HERRING    Take new Holland herring, remove the heads and scales, wash well, open  them and take out the milch and lay the herring and milch in milk or  water over night. Next day lay the herring in a stone jar with alternate  layers of onions cut up, also lemon cut in slices, a few cloves, whole  peppers and a few bay leaves, some capers and whole mustard seed. Take  the milch and rub it through a hair sieve, the more of them you have the  better for the sauce; stir in a spoon of brown sugar and vinegar and  pour it over the herring.      SALT HERRING    Soak salt herring over night in cold water, that the salt may be drawn  out. Drain and serve with boiled potatoes, or bone and place in kettle  of cold water, let come to a boil and let simmer a few minutes until  tender, drain and pour melted butter over them and serve hot with boiled  or fried potatoes.      BROILED SALT MACKEREL    Freshen the fish by soaking it over night in cold water, with the skin  uppermost. Drain and wipe dry, remove the head and tail; place it upon a  butter broiler, and slowly broil to a light brown. Place upon a hot  dish, add pepper, bits of butter, a sprinkling of parsley and a little  lemon juice.      BOILED SALT MACKEREL    Soak mackerel over night in cold water, with the skin side up, that the  salt may be drawn out, change the water often, and less time is  required. Drain. Place mackerel in shallow kettle, pour water over to  cover and boil ten to fifteen minutes or until flesh separates from the  bone. Remove to platter and pour hot, melted butter over and serve with  hot potatoes.    They may also be boiled and served with a White Sauce.      MARINIRTE FISH    Take pickerel, pike or any fish that is not fat, cut into two-inch  slices, wash well, salt and set aside in a cool place for a few hours.  When ready to cook, wash slightly so as not to remove all salt from  fish. Take heads and set up to boil with a whole onion for twenty-five  minutes, then add the other pieces and two cups of vinegar, one cup of  water, four bay leaves and twelve allspice, a little pepper and ginger.  Cook for thirty-five minutes longer. Taste fish, add a little water or a  little more vinegar to taste. Then remove fish carefully so as not to  break the pieces and let cool. Strain the sauce, return fish to same,  adding a few bay leaves and allspice. Set in a cool place until sauce  forms a jelly around the fish. Can be kept covered and in a cool place  for some time.      SOUSED HERRING    Split and half three herrings, roll and tie them up. Place them in a pie  plate, pour over them a cup of vinegar, add whole peppers, salt, cloves  to taste and two bay leaves. Bake in a slow oven until soft (about  twenty minutes).      SALMON LOAF    Blend together one can of salmon, one cup of grated bread crumbs, two  beaten eggs, one cup of milk, one teaspoon of lemon juice, one-half  teaspoon of paprika, one-half teaspoon of salt, one tablespoon of  chopped parsley and one tablespoon of onion juice. Place in a greased  baking dish. Sprinkle top with thin layer of bread crumbs. Bake in hot  oven for thirty minutes or until the crumbs that cover the dish are  browned. Serve with a white sauce.      CREAM SALMON    Remove salmon from the can, place it in a colander and wash under  running water or scald with boiling water. Break into small pieces, stir  into one cup of hot cream sauce; bring all to a boil and serve in patty  cups or on toasted bread or crackers.      PICKLE FOR SALMON    Take equal parts of vinegar, white wine and water. Boil these with a  little mace, a clove or two, a bit of ginger root, one or two whole  peppers and some grated horseradish. Take out the last named ingredient  when sufficiently boiled, and pour the pickle over the salmon,  previously boiled in strong salt and water.      KEDGEREE    Cut up in small pieces about a pound of any kind of cooked fish except  herring. Boil two eggs hard and chop up. Take one cup of rice and boil  in the following manner:--After washing it well and putting it on in  boiling water, with a little salt, let it boil for ten minutes, drain it  almost dry and let it steam with the lid closely shut for ten minutes  longer without stirring. Take a clean pot and put in the fish, eggs,  rice, a good dessertspoon of butter, and pepper and salt to taste. Stir  over the fire until quite hot. Press into a mould and turn it out at  once and serve.      SWISS CREAMED FISH    Mix smoothly in one cup of cold water a teaspoon of flour. Stir it into  one cup of boiling milk and when thick and smooth add the meat of any  cold fish, picked free from skin and bones. Season with salt, pepper and  a tablespoon of butter. If the cream is desired to be extra rich one  well-beaten egg may be added one minute before removing from the fire.  Serve hot. A pinch of cayenne or a saltspoon of paprika is relished by  many.      COD FISH BALLS    Put the fish to soak over night in lukewarm water. Change again in the  morning and wash off all the salt. Cut into pieces and boil about  fifteen minutes, pour off this water and put on to boil again with  boiling water. Boil twenty minutes this time, drain off every bit of  water, put on a platter to cool and pick to pieces as fine as possible,  removing every bit of skin and bone. When this is done, add an equal  quantity of mashed potatoes, a tablespoon of butter, a very little salt  and pepper, beat up one egg and a little milk, if necessary, mix with a  fork. Flour your hands well and form into biscuit-shaped balls. Fry in  hot oil.      FINNAN HADDIE    Parboil ten minutes and then broil like fresh fish.    To bake, place the fish in a pan, add one cup of milk and one cup of  water; cover. Cook ten minutes in hot oven. Remove cover, drain, spread  with butter and season with pepper.      FINNAN HADDIE AND MACARONI    Break up and cook until tender about a package of macaroni. Pick up the  finnan haddie until you have about three-quarters as much as you have  macaroni. Mix in a greased baking-dish and pour over a drawn butter  sauce, made with cornstarch or with any good milk or cream dressing,  then cover with bread or cracker crumbs or leave plain to brown in oven.  Bake from twenty to thirty minutes.      SCALLOPED FISH, No. 1    Line a buttered baking-dish with cold flaked fish. Sprinkle with salt  and pepper; add a layer of cold cooked rice, dot with butter; repeat and  cover with cracker or bread crumbs. Bake fifteen to twenty minutes.      SCALLOPED FISH, No. 2    Butter a dish, place in a layer of cold cooked fish, sprinkle with bread  crumbs, parsley, salt, butter and pepper; repeat. Cover with white  sauce, using one tablespoon of flour to two tablespoons of butter and  one cup of milk. Sprinkle top with buttered bread crumbs and bake.          *SAUCES FOR FISH AND VEGETABLES*      These sauces are made by combining butter and flour and thinning with  water or other liquid. A sauce should never be thickened by adding a  mixture of flour and water, as in that case the flour is seldom well  cooked; or by adding flour alone, as this way is certain to cause lumps.  The flour should be allowed to cook before the liquid is added.    All sauces containing butter and milk should be cooked in a double  boiler.    If so desired, any neutral oil--that is, vegetable or nut oil--may be  substituted for the butter called for in the recipe.    Care in preparation of a sauce is of as much importance as is the  preparation of the dish the sauce garnishes.      DRAWN BUTTER SAUCE    Melt two tablespoons of butter and stir in two tablespoons of flour. Add  carefully one cup of boiling water, then season with one-half teaspoon  of salt and a dash of pepper and paprika.    Many sauces are made with drawn butter as a foundation. For caper sauce  add three tablespoons of capers.    For egg sauce add one egg, hard-boiled and chopped fine.      BEARNAISE SAUCE    There are several ways of making Bearnaise sauce. This is one very  simple rule: Bring to the boil two tablespoons each of vinegar and  water. Simmer in it for ten minutes a slice of onion. Take out the onion  and add the yolks of three eggs beaten very light. Take from the fire,  add salt and pepper to season, and four tablespoons of butter beaten to  a cream, and added slowly.    *Quick Bearnaise Sauce.*--Beat the yolks of four eggs with four  tablespoons of oil and four of water. Add a cup of boiling water and  cook slowly until thick and smooth. Take from the fire, and add minced  onion, capers, olives, pickles, and parsley and a little tarragon  vinegar.      CUCUMBER SAUCE    Pare two large cucumbers; remove seeds, if large; chop fine and squeeze  dry. Season with salt, vinegar, paprika and add one-half cup of cream.      SAUCE HOLLANDAISE    Mix one tablespoon of butter and one of flour in a saucepan and add  gradually half a pint of boiling water. Stir until it just reaches the  boiling point; take from the fire and add the yolks of two eggs. Into  another saucepan put a slice of onion, a bay leaf, and a clove of  garlic; add four tablespoons of vinegar, and stand this over the fire  until the vinegar is reduced one-half. Turn this into the sauce, stir  for a moment; strain through a fine sieve; add half a teaspoon of salt  and serve. This sauce may be varied by adding lemon juice instead of  vinegar, or by using the water in which the fish was boiled. It is one  of the daintiest of all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12351"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 07 (#11)"],[1,"feeble will affords no sufficient  exercise to the faculties--leaving them therefore to find occupation  within themselves and to expand themselves on moral self-adulation.    It is quite otherwise with the comprehensive relations with which  history has to do. In this sphere are presented those momentous  collisions between existing, acknowledged duties, laws, and rights, and  those contingencies which are adverse to this fixed system, which assail  and even destroy its foundations and existence, and whose tenor may  nevertheless seem good--on the large scale, advantageous--yes, even  indispensable and necessary. These contingencies realize themselves in  history; they involve a general principle of a different order from that  on which depends the permanence of a people or a State. This principle  is an essential phase in the development of the creating Idea, of Truth  striving and urging toward (consciousness of) itself. Historical  men--world-famous individuals--are those in whose aims such a general  principle lies.    Caesar, in danger of losing a position--not perhaps at that time of  superiority, yet at least of equality with the others who were at the  head of the State, and of succumbing to those who were just on the point  of becoming his enemies--belongs essentially to this category. These  enemies--who were at the same time pursuing their own personal aims--had  on their side the form of the constitution, and the power conferred by  an appearance of justice. Caesar was contending for the maintenance of  his position, honor, and safety; and, since the power of his opponents  included the sovereignty over the provinces of the Roman Empire, his  victory secured for him the conquest of that entire Empire; and he thus  became--though leaving the form of the constitution--the autocrat of the  State. What secured for him the execution of a design, which in the  first instance was of negative import--the autocracy of Rome--was,  however, at the same time an independently necessary feature in the  history of Rome and of the world. It was not, then, his private gain  merely, but an unconscious impulse that occasioned the accomplishment of  that for which the time was ripe. Such are all great historical men,  whose own particular aims involve those large issues which are the will  of the World-Spirit. They may be called heroes, inasmuch as they have  derived their purposes and their vocation, not from the calm, regular  course of things, sanctioned by the existing order, but from a concealed  fount--one which has not attained to phenomenal, present existence--from  that inner Spirit, still hidden beneath the surface, which, impinging on  the outer world as on a shell, bursts it in pieces, because it is  another kernel than that which belonged to the shell in question. They  are men, therefore, who appear to draw the impulse of their life from  themselves, and whose deeds have produced a condition of things and a  complex of historical relations which appear to be only their own  interest and their own work.    Such individuals had no consciousness of the general Idea they were  unfolding, while prosecuting their aims; on the contrary, they were  practical, political men. But, at the same time, they were thinking men,  who had an insight into the requirements of the time--_what was ripe  for development_. This was the very truth for their age, for their  world--the species next in order, so to speak, and which was already  formed in the womb of time. It was theirs to know this nascent  principle, the necessary, directly sequent step in progress, which their  world was to take, to make this their aim, and to expend their energy in  promoting it. World-historical men--the heroes of an epoch--must,  therefore, be recognized as its clear-sighted ones; their deeds, their  words are the best of that time. Great men have formed purposes to  satisfy themselves, not others. Whatever prudent designs and counsels  they might have learned from others would be the more limited and  inconsistent features in their career; for it was they who best  understood affairs, from whom others learned, and approved, or at least  acquiesced in, their policy. For that Spirit which had taken this fresh  step in history is the inmost soul of all individuals, but in a state of  unconsciousness which the great men in question aroused. Their fellows,  therefore, follow these soul-leaders; for they feel the irresistible  power of their own inner Spirit thus embodied. If we go on to cast a  look at the fate of these world-historical persons, whose vocation it  was to be the agents of the World-Spirit, we shall find it to have been  no happy one. They attained no calm enjoyment; their whole life was  labor and trouble; their whole nature was naught else but their  master-passion. When their object is attained they fall off like empty  husks from the kernel. They die early, like Alexander; they are  murdered, like Caesar; transported to St. Helena, like Napoleon. This  fearful consolation--that historical men have not enjoyed what is called  happiness, and of which only private life (and this may be passed under  various external circumstances) is capable--this consolation those may  draw from history who stand in need of it; and it is craved by envy,  vexed at what is great and transcendent, striving, therefore, to  depreciate it and to find some flaw in it. Thus in modern times it has  been demonstrated _ad nauseam_ that princes are generally unhappy on  their thrones; in consideration of which the possession of a throne is  tolerated, and men acquiesce in the fact that not themselves but the  personages in question are its occupants. The free man, we may observe,  is not envious, but gladly recognizes what is great and exalted, and  rejoices that it exists.    It is in the light of those common elements which constitute the  interest and therefore the passions of individuals that these historical  men are to be regarded. They are great men, because they willed and  accomplished something great--not a mere fancy, a mere intention, but  whatever met the case and fell in with the needs of the age. This mode  of considering them also excludes the so-called \"psychological\" view,  which, serving the purpose of envy most effectually, contrives so to  refer all actions to the heart, to bring them under such a subjective  aspect, that their authors appear to have done everything under the  impulse of some passion, mean or grand, some morbid craving, and, on  account of these passions and cravings, to have been immoral men.  Alexander of Macedon partly subdued Greece, and then Asia; therefore he  was possessed by a morbid craving for conquest. He is alleged to have  acted from a craving for fame, for conquest; and the proof that these  were the impelling motives is that he did what resulted in fame. What  pedagogue has not demonstrated of Alexander the Great, of Julius Caesar,  that they were instigated by such passions, and were consequently  immoral men? From this the conclusion immediately follows that he, the  pedagogue, is a better man than they, because he has not such  passions--a proof of which lies in the fact that he does not conquer  Asia, or vanquish Darius and Porus, but, while he enjoys life himself,  lets others enjoy it too. These psychologists are particularly fond of  contemplating those peculiarities of great historical figures which  appertain to them as private persons. Man must eat and drink; he  sustains relations to friends and acquaintances; he has passing  impulses and ebullitions of temper. \"No man is a hero to his  valet-de-chambre,\" is a well-known proverb; I have added--and Goethe  repeated it ten years later--\"but not because the former is no hero, but  because the latter is a valet.\" He takes off the hero's boots, assists  him to bed, knows that he prefers champagne, etc. Historical personages  waited upon in historical literature by such psychological valets come  poorly off; they are brought down by these their attendants to a level  with, or, rather, a few degrees below the level of, the morality of such  exquisite discerners of spirits. The Thersites of Homer who abuses the  kings is a standing figure for all times. Blows--that is, beating with a  solid cudgel--he does not get in every age, as in the Homeric one; but  his envy, his egotism, is the thorn which he has to carry in his flesh;  and the undying worm that gnaws him is the tormenting consideration that  his excellent views and vituperations remain absolutely without result  in the world. But our satisfaction at the fate of Thersitism also, may  have its sinister side.    A world-famous individual is not so unwise as to indulge a variety of  wishes to divide his regards. He is devoted to the one aim, regardless  of all else. It is even possible that such men may treat other great,  even sacred interests, inconsiderately--conduct which is deserving of  moral reprehension. But so mighty a form must trample down many innocent  flowers and crush to pieces many an object in its path.    The special interest of passion is thus inseparable from the active  development of a general principle; for it is from the special and  determinate, and from its negation, that the universal results.  Particularity contends with its like, and some loss is involved in the  issue. It is not the general idea that is implicated in opposition and  combat, and that is exposed to danger. It remains in the background,  untouched and uninjured. This may be called the cunning of reason--that  it sets the passions to work for itself, while that which develops its  existence through such impulsion pays the penalty and suffers loss. For  it is _phenomenal_ being that is so treated, and, of this, a portion is  of no value, another is positive and real. The particular is, for the  most part, of too trifling value as compared with the general;  individuals are sacrificed and abandoned. The"]]]
