They have the minds of little children--that  is why they remain what they are.\"    \"You call them Mangani and yourself Tarmangani--what is the  difference?\" asked Major Preswick.    \"Tar means white,\" replied Tarzan, \"and Mangani, great ape. My name--the  name they gave me in the tribe of Kerchak--means White-skin. When  I was a little balu my skin, I presume, looked very white indeed  against the beautiful, black coat of Kala, my foster mother  and so they called me Tarzan, the Tarmangani. They call you, too,  Tarmangani,\" he concluded, smiling.    Capell smiled. \"It is no reproach, Greystoke,\" he said; \"and, by  Jove, it would be a mark of distinction if a fellow could act the  part. And now how about your plan? Do you still think you can empty  the trench opposite our sector?\"    \"Is it still held by Gomangani?\" asked Tarzan.    \"What are Gomangani?\" inquired the colonel. \"It is still held by  native troops, if that is what you mean.\"    \"Yes,\" replied the ape-man, \"the Gomangani are the great black  apes--the Negroes.\"    \"What do you intend doing and what do you want us to do?\" asked  Capell.    Tarzan approached the table and placed a finger on the map. \"Here  is a listening post,\" he said; \"they have a machine gun in it. A  tunnel connects it with this trench at this point.\" His finger moved  from place to place on the map as he talked.  \"Give me a bomb and  when you hear it burst in this listening post let your men start  across No Man's Land slowly. Presently they will hear a commotion  in the enemy trench; but they need not hurry, and, whatever they  do, have them come quietly. You might also warn them that I may be  in the trench and that I do not care to be shot or bayoneted.\"    \"And that is all?\" queried Capell, after directing an officer to  give Tarzan a hand grenade; \"you will empty the trench alone?\"    \"Not exactly alone,\" replied Tarzan with a grim smile; \"but I shall  empty it, and, by the way, your men may come in through the tunnel  from the listening post if you prefer. In about half an hour,  Colonel,\" and he turned and left them.    As he passed through the camp there flashed suddenly upon the screen  of recollection, conjured there by some reminder of his previous  visit to headquarters, doubtless, the image of the officer he had  passed as he quit the colonel that other time and simultaneously  recognition of the face that had been revealed by the light from  the fire. He shook his head dubiously. No, it could not be and  yet the features of the young officer were identical with those of  Fraulein Kircher, the German spy he had seen at German headquarters  the night he took Major Schneider from under the nose of the Hun  general and his staff.    Beyond the last line of sentinels Tarzan moved quickly in the  direction of Numa, the lion. The beast was lying down as Tarzan  approached, but he rose as the ape-man reached his side. A low  whine escaped his muzzled lips. Tarzan smiled for he recognized in  the new note almost a supplication--it was more like the whine of  a hungry dog begging for food than the voice of the proud king of  beasts.    \"Soon you will kill--and feed,\" he murmured in the vernacular of  the great apes.    He unfastened the rope from about the tree and, with Numa close  at his side, slunk into No Man's Land. There was little rifle fire  and only an occasional shell vouched for the presence of artillery  behind the opposing lines. As the shells from both sides were  falling well back of the trenches, they constituted no menace to  Tarzan; but the noise of them and that of the rifle fire had a marked  effect upon Numa who crouched, trembling, close to the Tarmangani  as though seeking protection.    Cautiously the two beasts moved forward toward the listening post  of the Germans. In one hand Tarzan carried the bomb the English had  given him, in the other was the coiled rope attached to the lion.  At last Tarzan could see the position a few yards ahead. His keen  eyes picked out the head and shoulders of the sentinel on watch.  The ape-man grasped the bomb firmly in his right hand. He measured  the distance with his eye and gathered his feet beneath him, then  in a single motion he rose and threw the missile, immediately  flattening himself prone upon the ground.    Five seconds later there was a terrific explosion in the center of  the listening post. Numa gave a nervous start and attempted to break  away; but Tarzan held him and, leaping to his feet, ran forward,  dragging Numa after him. At the edge of the post he saw below him  but slight evidence that the position had been occupied at all,  for only a few shreds of torn flesh remained. About the only thing  that had not been demolished was a machine gun which had been  protected by sand bags.    There was not an instant to lose. Already a relief might be crawling  through the communication tunnel, for it must have been evident to  the sentinels in the Hun trenches that the listening post had been  demolished. Numa hesitated to follow Tarzan into the excavation;  but the ape-man, who was in no mood to temporize, jerked him roughly  to the bottom.  Before them lay the mouth of the tunnel that led  back from No Man's Land to the German trenches. Tarzan pushed Numa  forward until his head was almost in the aperture, then as though  it were an afterthought, he turned quickly and, taking the machine  gun from the parapet, placed it in the bottom of the hole close  at hand, after which he turned again to Numa, and with his knife  quickly cut the garters that held the bags upon his front paws.  Before the lion could know that a part of his formidable armament  was again released for action, Tarzan had cut the rope from his  neck and the head bag from his face, and grabbing the lion from  the rear had thrust him partially into the mouth of the tunnel.    Then Numa balked, only to feel the sharp prick of Tarzan's knife  point in his hind quarters. Goading him on the ape-man finally  succeeded in getting the lion sufficiently far into the tunnel  so that there was no chance of his escaping other than by going  forward or deliberately backing into the sharp blade at his rear.  Then Tarzan cut the bags from the great hind feet, placed his  shoulder and his knife point against Numa's seat, dug his toes  into the loose earth that had been broken up by the explosion of  the bomb, and shoved.    Inch by inch at first Numa advanced. He was growling now and presently  he commenced to roar. Suddenly he leaped forward and Tarzan knew  that he had caught the scent of meat ahead. Dragging the machine  gun beside him the ape-man followed quickly after the lion whose  roars he could plainly hear ahead mingled with the unmistakable  screams of frightened men. Once again a grim smile touched the lips  of this man-beast.    \"They murdered my Waziri,\" he muttered; \"they crucified Wasimbu,  son of Muviro.\"    When Tarzan reached the trench and emerged into it there was no one  in sight in that particular bay, nor in the next, nor the next as  he hurried forward in the direction of the German center; but in the  fourth bay he saw a dozen men jammed in the angle of the traverse  at the end while leaping upon them and rending with talons and fangs  was Numa, a terrific incarnation of ferocity and ravenous hunger.    Whatever held the men at last gave way as they fought madly with  one another in their efforts to escape this dread creature that  from their infancy had filled them with terror, and again they  were retreating. Some clambered over the parados and some even over  the parapet preferring the dangers of No Man's Land to this other  soul-searing menace.    As the British advanced slowly toward the German trenches, they  first met terrified blacks who ran into their arms only too willing  to surrender. That pandemonium had broken loose in the Hun trench  was apparent to the Rhodesians not only from the appearance of the  deserters, but from the sounds of screaming, cursing men which came  clearly to their ears; but there was one that baffled them for it  resembled nothing more closely than the infuriated growling of an  angry lion.    And when at last they reached the trench, those farthest on the left  of the advancing Britishers heard a machine gun sputter suddenly  before them and saw a huge lion leap over the German parados with  the body of a screaming Hun soldier between his jaws and vanish  into the shadows of the night, while squatting upon a traverse to  their left was Tarzan of the Apes with a machine gun before him  with which he was raking the length of the German trenches.    The foremost Rhodesians saw something else--they saw a huge German  officer emerge from a dugout just in rear of the ape-man. They saw  him snatch up a discarded rifle with bayonet fixed and creep upon  the apparently unconscious Tarzan. They ran forward, shouting  warnings; but above the pandemonium of the trenches and the machine  gun their voices could not reach him. The German leaped upon the  parapet behind him--the fat hands raised the rifle butt aloft for  the cowardly downward thrust into the naked back and then, as moves  Ara, the lightning, moved Tarzan of the Apes.    It was no man who leaped forward upon that Boche officer,  striking  aside the sharp bayonet as one might strike aside a straw in a  baby's hand--it was a wild beast and the roar of a wild beast was  upon those savage lips, for as that strange sense that Tarzan owned  in common with the other jungle-bred creatures of his wild domain  warned him of the presence behind him and he had whirled to meet  the attack, his eyes had seen the corps and regimental insignia upon  the other's blouse--it was the same as that worn by the murderers  of his wife and his people, by the despoilers of his home and his  happiness.    It was a wild beast whose teeth fastened upon the shoulder of the  Hun--it was a wild beast whose talons sought that fat neck.

'Vous m'excuserez beaucoup de mon retard.    'Je termine en vous presentant mes respectueuses salutations. Vous  noublierez pas ce que vous mavez promis'[22]St. Georges, le 24 Juillet,  1864. _Dimanche_.    'JULES MIGNOT.'    Instead of three francs the quintal, Mignot had previously told me that  he got four francs, delivered at Gland, and five at Geneva. His ordinary  staff during the time of the exploitation was ten men to carry and load,  and two to cut the ice in the cave.    It was a matter of considerable importance to catch the Poste at  Gimel, and the two Swiss groaned loudly on the consequent pace,  unnecessary, as far as they were concerned, for the Poste was nothing  to them. As a general rule, the Swiss of this district cannot walk so  fast as their Burgundian or French neighbours, unless it is very much  to their interest to do so, and then they can go fast enough. A legend  is still preserved in the valleys of Joux and Les Rousses, to the  following effect. While the Franche Comte was still Spanish, in 1648,  commissioners were appointed to fix the boundaries between Berne and  Burgundy, on the other side of the range of hill we were now  descending, and they decided that one of the boundary stones must be  placed at the distance of a common league from the Lake of Les  Rousses. Unfortunately, no one could say what a common league was,  beyond the vague definition of 'an hour's walk;' so two men were  started from the shore of the lake, the one a Burgundian and the other  a Swiss, with directions to walk for an hour down the Orbe towards  Chenit, the stone to be placed half-way between the points they should  respectively reach at the end of the hour. It was for the interest of  the Franche Comte that the stone should be as near the lake as  possible, and accordingly the Swiss champion made such walking as had  never been seen before, and gained for Berne a considerable amount of  territory. There was no such tragic result in this case as that which  induced the Carthaginians to pay divine honours to the brothers whose  speed, on a like occasion, had added an appreciable amount to the  possessions of the republic.    At length we reached the point where the roads for Gimel and S.  Georges separate, and there, under a glorious sapin, we said our  adieux, and wished our _au revoirs_, and settled those little matters  which the best friends must settle, when one is of the nature of a  monsieur, and the others are guides. They burdened their souls with  many politenesses, and so we parted. The inclemency of the weather was  such, that the people in the lower country asked, as they passed,  whether snow had fallen in the mountains, and the cold rain continued  unceasingly down to the large plain on which the Federal Camp of  Biere[23] is placed. Here for a few moments the sun showed itself,  lighting up the white tents, and displaying to great advantage the  masses of scented orchises, and the feathery _reine-des-pres_, which  hemmed the road in on either side. All through the earlier part of the  day, flowers had forced themselves upon our notice as mere vehicles  for collected rain, when we came in contact with them; but now, for a  short time, they resumed their proper place,--only for a short time,  for the rain soon returned, and did not cease till midnight. Not all  the garden scenery about Aubonne and Allaman (_ad Lemannum_), nor all  the vineyards which yield the choice white wine of the Cote, could  counterbalance the united discomfort of the rain, and the cold which  had got into the system in the two glacieres; and matters were not  mended by the discovery that _Bradshaw_ was treacherous, and that a  junction with dry baggage at Neufchatel could not be effected before  eleven at night.    There are some curious natural phenomena in this neighbourhood, due to  the subterranean courses which the fissured limestone of the Jura  affords to the meteoric waters. Not far from Biere, the river Aubonne  springs out at the bottom of an amphitheatre of rock, receiving  additions soon after from a group of twenty natural pits, which the  peasants call unfathomable--an epithet freely applied to the strange  holes found in the Jura. It is remarkable that the way seems to stand  at different levels in the various pits.[24] The plain of Champagne,  in which they occur, is unlike the surrounding soil in being formed of  calcareous detritus, evidently brought down by some means or other  from the Jura, and is dry and parched up to the very edges of the  pits. The Toleure, a tributary of the Aubonne, frequently large enough  to be called a confluent, flows out from the foot of a wall of rock  composed of regular parallelopipeds, and in the spring, when the snows  are melting freely, its sources burst out at various levels of the  rock. Farther to the west, the Versoie, famous for its trout, pours  forth a full-sized stream near the Chateau of Divonne, which is said  to take its name (_Divorum unda_) from this phenomenon. Passing to the  northern slope of this range of the Jura, the Orbe is a remarkable  example of the same sort of thing, flowing out peacefully in very  considerable bulk from an arch at the bottom of a perpendicular rock  of great height. This river no doubt owes its origin to the  superfluous waters of the Lake of Brenets, which have no visible  outlet, and sink into fissures and _entonnoirs_ in the rock at the  edge of the lake. Notwithstanding that the lake is three-quarters of a  league distant, horizontally, and nearly 700 feet higher, the belief  had always been that it was the source of the stream, and in 1776 this  was proved to be the fact. For some years before that date, the waters  of the Lake of Joux had been inconveniently high, and the people  determined to clean out the _entonnoirs_ and fissures of the Lake of  Brenets, which is only separated from the Lake of Joux by a narrow  tongue of land, in the expectation that the water would then pass away  more freely. In order to reach the fissures, they dammed up the outlet  of the upper into the lower lake; but the pressure on the embankment  became too great, and the waters burst through with much violence,  creating an immense disturbance in the lake; and the Orbe, which had  always been perfectly clear, was troubled and muddy for some little  time. The source of the Loue, near Pontarlier, is more striking than  even that of the Orbe.[25]      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 21: A point common to the two sections, which are made by  planes nearly at right angles to each other.]    [Footnote 22: The dimensions of the two caves, and of the various masses  of ice.]    [Footnote 23: The Cartulary of Lausanne states that the wealthy village  of Biere received its name from the following historical fact:--In 522,  the Bishop of Lausanne, S. Prothais, was superintending the cutting of  wood in the Jura for his cathedral, when he died suddenly, and was  carried down on a litter to a place where a proper _bier_ could he  procured, whence the place was named Biere.]    [Footnote 24: The most curious pit of this kind is the _frais-puits_ of  Vesoul, in the Vosgian Jura, which pours forth immense quantities of  water after rain has fallen in the neighbourhood. The water rushes out  in the shape of a fountain, and on one occasion, in November 1557, saved  the town of Vesoul from pillage by a passing army. This pit is carefully  described by M. Hassenfratz, in the _Journal de Physique_, t. xx. p. 259  (an. 1782), where he says that Caesar was driven away from the town of  Vesoul, which he had intended to besiege, by the floods of water poured  forth from the _frais-puits_. I know of no such incident in Caesar's  life, though M. Hassenfratz quotes Caesar's own words: the town of  Vesoul, too, had no historical existence before the 9th or 10th century  of our era. There is also a pit near Vesoul which contains icicles in  summer, and may be the same as the _frais-puits_, for the old historian  of Franche Comte, Gollut, in describing the latter, mentions that it is  so cold that no one cares to explore it (pp. 91. 92).]    [Footnote 25: See p. 122.]             *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER V.

The grand and lovely scenery of the Val de Travers has at length been  opened up for the ordinary tourist world, by the railway which connects  Pontarlier with Neufchatel. The beauties of the valley are an  unfortunate preparation for the dull expanse of ugly France which greets  the traveller passing north from the former town; but the country soon  assumes a pleasanter aspect, and nothing can be more charming than the  soft green slopes, dotted with the richest pines, which form the  approach to the station of Boujeailles. It is impossible for the most  careless traveller to avoid observing the ill effects produced upon the  trees on the south side of the forest of Chaux, by the crowded and  neglected state in which they have been left, and the wet state of the  soil. The branches become covered with moss, which first kills them, and  then breaks them off, so that many tall and tapering sapins point their  heads to the sky with trunks wholly guiltless of branches; while in  other cases, where decay has not yet gone so far, the branches wear the  appearance of gigantic stags' horns, with the velvet; and when a number  of these interlace, the mosses unite"]]]
