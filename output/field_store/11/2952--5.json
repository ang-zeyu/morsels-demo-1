Real.,  Parte 1, lib. 5, cap. 1.    \"Si estas partes fuesen iguales, o qual fuese mayor, yo lo he  procurado averiguar, y en unas es diferente de otras, y finalmte  yo tengo entendido que se hacia conforme a la disposicion de la  tierra y a la calidad de los Indios\" Ondegardo, Rel Prim., Ms]    The lands assigned to the Sun furnished a revenue to support the  temples, and maintain the costly ceremonial of the Peruvian  worship and the multitudinous priesthood.  Those reserved for the  Inca went to support the royal state, as well as the numerous  members of his household and his kindred, and supplied the  various exigencies of government.  The remainder of the lands was  divided, per capita, in equal shares among the people.  It was  provided by law, as we shall see hereafter, that every Peruvian  should marry at a certain age.  When this event took place, the  community or district in which he lived furnished him with a  dwelling, which, as it was constructed of humble materials, was  done at little cost.  A lot of land was then assigned to him  sufficient for his own maintenance and that of his wife. An  additional portion was granted for every child, the amount  allowed for a son being the double of that for a daughter.  The  division of the soil was renewed every year, and the possessions  of the tenant were increased or diminished according to the  numbers in his family. *14 The same arrangement was observed with  reference to the curacas, except only that a domain was assigned  to them corresponding with the superior dignity of their stations  *15    [Footnote 14: Ondegardo, Rel. Prim., Ms. - Garcilasso, Com.  Real., Parte 1, lib. 5, cap. 2.    The portion granted to each new-married couple, according to  Garcilasso, was a fanega and a half of land.  A similar quantity  was added for each male child that was born; and half of the  quantity for each female.  The fanega was as much land as could  be planted with a hundred weight of Indian corn. In the fruitful  soil of Peru, this was a liberal allowance for a family.]    [Footnote 15: Ibid., Parte 1, lib. 5, cap. 3.    It is singular, that while so much is said of the Inca sovereign,  so little should be said of the Inca nobility, of their estates,  or the tenure by which they held them.  Their historian tells us,  that they had the best of the lands, wherever they resided,  besides the interest which they had in those of the Sun and the  Inca, as children of the one, and kinsmen of the other.  He  informs us, also, that they were supplied from the royal table,  when living at court.  (lib. 6, cap. 3.) But this is very loose  language. The student of history will learn, on the threshold,  that he is not to expect precise, or even very consistent,  accounts of the institutions of a barbarous age and people from  contemporary annalists.]    A more thorough and effectual agrarian law than this cannot be  imagined. In other countries where such a law has been  introduced, its operation, after a time, has given way to the  natural order of events, and, under the superior intelligence and  thrift of some and the prodigality of others, the usual  vicissitudes of fortune have been allowed to take their course,  and restore things to their natural inequality.  Even the iron  law of Lycurgus ceased to operate after a time, and melted away  before the spirit of luxury and avarice. The nearest approach to  the Peruvian constitution was probably in Judea, where, on the  recurrence of the great national jubilee, at the close of every  half-century, estates reverted to their original proprietors.  There was this important difference in Peru; that not only did  the lease, if we may so call it, terminate with the year, but  during that period the tenant had no power to alienate or to add  to his possessions.  The end of the brief term found him in  precisely the same condition that he was in at the beginning.  Such a state of things might be supposed to be fatal to any thing  like attachment to the soil, or to that desire of improving it,  which is natural to the permanent proprietor, and hardly less so  to the holder of a long lease.  But the practical operation of  the law seems to have been otherwise; and it is probable, that,  under the influence of that love of order and aversion to change  which marked the Peruvian institutions, each new partition of the  soil usually confirmed the occupant in his possession, and the  tenant for a year was converted into a proprietor for life.    The territory was cultivated wholly by the people.  The lands  belonging to the Sun were first attended to.  They next tilled  the lands of the old, of the sick, of the window and the orphan,  and of soldiers engaged in actual service; in short, of all that  part of the community who, from bodily infirmity or any other  cause, were unable to attend to their own concerns. The people  were then allowed to work on their own ground, each man for  himself, but with the general obligation to assist his neighbour,  when any circumstance - the burden of a young and numerous  family, for example - might demand it. *16 Lastly, they  cultivated the lands of the Inca.  This was done, with great  ceremony, by the whole population in a body.  At break of day,  they were summoned together by proclamation from some  neighbouring tower or eminence, and all the inhabitants of the  district, men, women, and children, appeared dressed in their  gayest apparel, bedecked with their little store of finery and  ornaments, as if for some great jubilee.  They went through the  labors of the day with the same joyous spirit, chanting their  popular ballads which commemorated the heroic deeds of the Incas,  regulating their movements by the measure of the chant, and all  mingling in the chorus, of which the word hailli, or \"triumph,\"  was usually the burden.  These national airs had something soft  and pleasing in their character, that recommended them to the  Spaniards; and many a Peruvian song was set to music by them  after the Conquest, and was listened to by the unfortunate  natives with melancholy satisfaction, as it called up  recollections of the past, when their days glided peacefully away  under the sceptre of the Incas. *17    [Footnote 16: Garcilasso relates that an Indian was hanged by  Huayna Capac for tilling a curaca's ground, his near relation,  before that of the poor. The gallows was erected on the curaca's  own land.  Ibid., Parte 1, lib. 5, cap. 2.]    [Footnote 17: Ibid., Parte 1, lib. 5, cap. 1-3. - Ondegardo, Rel.  Seg., Ms.]    A similar arrangement prevailed with respect to the different  manufactures as to the agricultural products of the country.  The  flocks of llamas, or Peruvian sheep, were appropriated  exclusively to the Sun and to the Inca. *18 Their number was  immense.  They were scattered over the different provinces,  chiefly in the colder regions of the country, where they were  intrusted to the care of experienced shepherds, who conducted  them to different pastures according to the change of season.  A  large number was every year sent to the capital for the  consumption of the Court, and for the religious festivals and  sacrifices.  But these were only the males, as no female was  allowed to be killed.  The regulations for the care and breeding  of these flocks were prescribed with the greatest minuteness, and  with a sagacity which excited the admiration of the Spaniards,  who were familiar with the management of the great migratory  flocks of merinos in their own country. *19    [Footnote 18: Ondegardo, Rel. Prim., Ms.    Yet sometimes the sovereign would recompense some great chief, or  even some one among the people, who had rendered him a service,  by the grant of a small number of llamas, - never many.  These  were not to be disposed of or killed by their owners, but  descended as common property to their heirs. This strange  arrangement proved a fruitful source of litigation after the  Conquest. Ibid., ubi supra.]    [Footnote 19: See especially the account of the Licentiate  Ondegardo, who goes into more detail than any contemporary  writer, concerning the management of the Peruvian flocks.  Rel.  Seg., Ms.]    At the appointed season, they were all sheared, and the wool was  deposited in the public magazines.  It was then dealt out to each  family in such quantities as sufficed for its wants, and was  consigned to the female part of the household, who were well  instructed in the business of spinning and weaving When this  labor was accomplished, and the family was provided with a coarse  but warm covering, suited to the cold climate of the mountains, -  for, in the lower country, cotton, furnished in like manner by  the Crown, took the place, to a certain extent, of wool, - the  people were required to labor for the Inca.  The quantity of the  cloth needed, as well as the peculiar kind and quality of the  fabric, was first determined at Cuzco.  The work was then  apportioned among the different provinces.  Officers, appointed  for the purpose, superintended the distribution of the wool, so  that the manufacture of the different articles should be  intrusted to the most competent hands. *20 They did not leave the  matter here but entered the dwellings, from time to time, and saw  that the work was faithfully executed. This domestic inquisition  was not confined to the labors for the Inca.  It included, also,  those for the several families; and care was taken that each  household should employ the materials furnished for its own use  in the manner that was intended, so that no one should be  unprovided with necessary apparel. *21 In this domestic labor all  the female part of the establishment was expected to join.  Occupation was found for all, from the child five years old to  the aged matron not too infirm to hold a distaff.  No one, at  least none but the decrepit and the sick, was allowed to eat the  bread of idleness in Peru.  Idleness was a crime in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13240"],[0,"A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature (#11)"],[1,"first work was a  translation from Ovid, followed by commendatory verses prefixed to  certain plays of Jonson. Soon afterwards his friendship with F. began.  They lived in the same house and had practically a community of goods  until B.'s marriage in 1613 to Ursula, _dau._ and co-heiress of Henry  Isley of Sundridge in Kent, by whom he had two _dau._ He _d._ in 1616,  and is buried in Westminster Abbey. F. was the youngest _s._ of Richard  F., Bishop of London, who accompanied Mary Queen of Scots to the  scaffold. He went to Cambridge, but it is not known whether he took a  degree, though he had some reputation as a scholar. His earliest play is  _The Woman Hater_ (1607). He is said to have died of the plague, and is  buried in St. Saviour's Church, Southwark. The plays attributed to B. and  F. number 52 and a masque, and much labour has been bestowed by critics  in endeavouring to allocate their individual shares. It is now generally  agreed that others collaborated with them to some extent--Massinger,  Rowley, Shirley, and even Shakespeare. Of those believed to be the joint  work of B. and F. _Philaster_ and _The Maid's Tragedy_ are considered the  masterpieces, and are as dramas unmatched except by Shakespeare. _The Two  Noble Kinsmen_ is thought to contain the work of Shakespeare. As regards  their respective powers, B. is held to have had the graver, solider, and  more stately genius, while F. excelled in brightness, wit, and gaiety.  The former was the stronger in judgment, the latter in fancy. The plays  contain many very beautiful lyrics, but are often stained by gross  indelicacy. The play of _Henry VIII._ included in Shakespeare's works, is  now held to be largely the work of F. and Massinger. Subjoined is a list  of the plays with the authorship according to the latest authorities.    (1) BEAUMONT.--_The Masque_.

The latest ed. is that of Mr. Bullen (11 vols., 1904), and A.R. Waller (7  vols., _pub._ C.U.P., 1909); Dyce (11 vols., 1843-46); _Francis  Beaumont_, G.C. Macaulay (1883); _Lyric Poems_ of B. and F., E. Rhys  (1897); _Bibliography_, A.C. Potter in _Harvard Bibliograph.  Contributions_, 1891.      BEAUMONT, SIR JOHN (1582-1627?).--Poet, elder brother of Francis B., the  dramatist (_q.v._). His poems, of which the best known is _Bosworth  Field_, _pub._ by his _s._, 1629. Another, _The Crown of Thorns_, is  lost.      BECKFORD, WILLIAM (_c._ 1760-1844).--Miscellaneous writer, only _s._ of  William B., Lord Mayor of London, the associate and supporter of John  Wilkes, inherited at the age of 9 an enormous fortune. In these  circumstances he grew up wayward and extravagant, showing, however, a  strong bent towards literature. His education was entrusted to a private  tutor, with whom he travelled extensively on the Continent. At the age of  22 he produced his oriental romance, _Vathek_ (_c._ 1781), written  originally in French and, as he was accustomed to boast, at a single  sitting of three days and two nights. There is reason, however, to  believe that this was a flight of imagination. It is an impressive work,  full of fantastic and magnificent conceptions, rising occasionally to  sublimity. His other principal writings are _Memoirs of Extraordinary  Painters_ (1780), a satirical work, and _Letters from Italy with Sketches  of Spain and Portugal_ (1835), full of brilliant descriptions of scenes  and manners. B.'s fame, however, rests nearly as much upon his eccentric  extravagances as a builder and collector as upon his literary efforts. In  carrying out these he managed to dissipate his fortune of L100,000 a  year, only L80,000 of his capital remaining at his death. He sat in  parliament for various constituencies, and one of his two _dau._ became  Duchess of Hamilton.      BEDDOES, THOMAS LOVELL (1803-1849).--Dramatic poet and physiologist, _s._  of Dr. Thos. B., an eminent physician, and nephew of Maria Edgeworth.  _Ed._ at the Charterhouse and Oxford, he _pub._ in 1821 _The  Improvisatore_, which he afterwards endeavoured to suppress. His next  venture was _The Bride's Tragedy_ (1822), which had considerable success,  and won for him the friendship of \"Barry Cornwall.\" Thereafter he went to  Goettingen and studied medicine. He then wandered about practising his  profession, and expounding democratic theories which got him into  trouble. He _d._ at Bale in mysterious circumstances. For some time  before his death he had been engaged upon a drama, _Death's Jest Book_,  which was published in 1850 with a memoir by his friend, T.F. Kelsall. B.  had not the true dramatic instinct, but his poetry is full of thought and  richness of diction. Some of his short pieces, _e.g._: \"If there were  dreams to sell,\" and \"If thou wilt ease thine heart,\" are masterpieces of  intense feeling exquisitely expressed.      BEDE or BAEDA (673-735).--Historian and scholar. B., who is sometimes  referred to as \"the father of English history,\" was in his youth placed  under the care of Benedict Biscop, Abbot of Wearmouth, and of Ceolfrith,  afterwards Abbot of Jarrow. Ordained deacon in 692 and priest in 703, he  spent most of his days at Jarrow, where his fame as a scholar and teacher  of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew brought him many disciples. Here likewise he  _d._ and was buried, but his bones were, towards the beginning of the  11th century, removed to Durham. The well-deserved title of \"Venerable\"  usually prefixed to his name first appears in 836. He was the most  learned Englishman of his age. His industry was marvellous, and its  results remain embodied in about 40 books, of which about 25 are  commentaries on books of Scripture. The others are lives of saints and  martyrs, and his two great works, _The Ecclesiastical History of England_  and the scientific treatise, _De Natura Rerum_. The former of these gives  the fullest and best information we have as to the history of England  down to the year 731, and the latter is an encyclopaedia of the sciences  as then known. In the anxious care with which he sought out and selected  reliable information, and referred to authorities he shows the best  qualities of the modern historian, and his style is remarkable for \"a  pleasing artlessness.\"    _History of Early Engl. Lit._, Stopford Brooke (2 vols., 1892), etc.      BEECHER, HENRY WARD (1813-1887).--Orator and divine, _s._ of Lyman B. and  _bro._ of Harriet Beecher Stowe, was one of the most popular of American  preachers and platform orators, a prominent advocate of temperance and of  the abolition of slavery. His writings, which had a wide popularity,  include _Summer in the Soul_ and _Life Thoughts_.      BEHN, APHRA (JOHNSTON) (1640-1689).--Novelist and dramatist, _dau._ of a  barber named Johnston, but went with a relative whom she called father to  Surinam, of which he had been appointed Governor. He, however, _d._ on  the passage thither, and her childhood and youth were passed there. She  became acquainted with the celebrated slave Oronoko, afterwards the hero  of one of her novels. Returning to England in 1658 she _m._ Behn, a Dutch  merchant, but was a widow at the age of 26. She then became attached to  the Court, and was employed as a political spy at Antwerp. Leaving that  city she cultivated the friendship of various playwrights, and produced  many plays and novels, also poems and pamphlets. The former are extremely  gross, and are now happily little known. She was the first English  professional authoress. Among her plays are _The Forced Marriage_,  _Abdelazer_, _The Rover_, _The Debauchee_, etc., and her novels include  _Oronoko_ and _The Nun_. The former of these was the first book to bring  home to the country a sense of the horrors of slavery, for which let her  have credit.      BELL, HENRY GLASSFORD (1805-1874).--Poet and historian, was a member of  the Scottish Bar, and became Sheriff of Lanarkshire. He wrote a _Life of  Mary Queen of Scots_ (1830), strongly in her defence, and two vols. of  poetry, _Summer and Winter Hours_ (1831), and _My Old Portfolio_, the  latter also containing pieces in prose.
