These slips represent  old books destroyed, and like the slips already noticed, should always  be carefully examined.    When valuable books have been evil-entreated, when they have become  soiled by dirty hands, or spoiled by water stains, or injured by  grease spots, nothing is more astonishing to the uninitiated than the  transformation they undergo in the hands of a skilful restorer. The  covers are first carefully dissected, the eye of the operator keeping  a careful outlook for any fragments of old MSS. or early printed books,  which may have been used by the original binder. No force should be  applied to separate parts which adhere together; a little warm water  and care is sure to overcome that difficulty. When all the sections are  loose, the separate sheets are placed singly in a bath of cold water,  and allowed to remain there until all the dirt has soaked out. If not  sufficiently purified, a little hydrochloric or oxalic acid, or caustic  potash may be put in the water, according as the stains are from grease  or from ink. Here is where an unpractised binder will probably injure a  book for life. If the chemicals are too strong, or the sheets remain too  long in the bath, or are not thoroughly cleansed from the bleach before  they are re-sized, the certain seeds of decay are planted in the paper,  and although for a time the leaves may look bright to the eye, and even  crackle under the hand like the soundest paper, yet in the course of a  few years the enemy will appear, the fibre will decay, and the existence  of the books will terminate in a state of white tinder.    Everything which diminishes the interest of a book is inimical to its  preservation, and in fact is its enemy. Therefore, a few words upon the  destruction of old bindings.    I remember purchasing many years ago at a suburban book stall, a perfect  copy of Moxon's Mechanic Exercises, now a scarce work. The volumes were  uncut, and had the original marble covers. They looked so attractive in  their old fashioned dress, that I at once determined to preserve it. My  binder soon made for them a neat wooden box in the shape of a book,  with morocco back properly lettered, where I trust the originals will be  preserved from dust and injury for many a long year.    Old covers, whether boards or paper, should always be retained if in  any state approaching decency. A case, which can be embellished to any  extent looks every whit as well upon the shelf! and gives even greater  protection than binding. It has also this great advantage: it does not  deprive your descendants of the opportunity of seeing for themselves  exactly in what dress the book buyers of four centuries ago received  their volumes.        CHAPTER IX. COLLECTORS.    AFTER all, two-legged depredators, who ought to have known better, have  perhaps done as much real damage in libraries as any other enemy. I do  not refer to thieves, who, if they injure the owners, do no harm to the  books themselves by merely transferring them from one set of bookshelves  to another. Nor do I refer to certain readers who frequent our public  libraries, and, to save themselves the trouble of copying, will cut out  whole articles from magazines or encyclopaedias. Such depredations are  not frequent, and only occur with books easily replaced, and do not  therefore call for more than a passing mention; but it is a serious  matter when Nature produces such a wicked old biblioclast as John  Bagford, one of the founders of the Society of Antiquaries, who, in the  beginning of the last century, went about the country, from library to  library, tearing away title pages from rare books of all sizes. These  he sorted out into nationalities and towns, and so, with a lot of  hand-bills, manuscript notes, and miscellaneous collections of all  kinds, formed over a hundred folio volumes, now preserved in the British  Museum. That they are of service as materials in compiling a general  history of printing cannot be denied, but the destruction of many  rare books was the result, and more than counter-balanced any benefit  bibliographers will ever receive from them. When here and there  throughout those volumes you meet with titles of books now either  unknown entirely, or of the greatest rarity; when you find the Colophon  from the end, or the \"insigne typographi\" from the first leaf of a rare  \"fifteener,\" pasted down with dozens of others, varying in value, you  cannot bless the memory of the antiquarian shoemaker, John Bagford. His  portrait, a half-length, painted by Howard, was engraved by Vertue, and  re-engraved for the Bibliographical Decameron.    A bad example often finds imitators, and every season there crop up for  public sale one or two such collections, formed by bibliomaniacs, who,  although calling themselves bibliophiles, ought really to be ranked  among the worst enemies of books.    The following is copied from a trade catalogue, dated April, 1880, and  affords a fair idea of the extent to which these heartless destroyers  will go:--    \"MISSAL ILLUMINATIONS.    FIFTY DIFFERENT CAPITAL LETTERS _on_ VELLUM; _all in rich Gold and  Colours. Many 3 inches square: the floral decorations are of great  beauty, ranging from the XIIth to XVth century. Mounted on stout  card-board_. IN NICE PRESERVATION, L6 6_s_.       These beautiful letters have been cut from precious       MSS., and as specimens of early art are extremely       valuable, many of them being worth 15_s_. each.\"      Mr. Proeme is a man well known to the London dealers in old books. He is  wealthy, and cares not what he spends to carry out his bibliographical  craze, which is the collection of title pages. These he ruthlessly  extracts, frequently leaving the decapitated carcase of the books, for  which he cares not, behind him. Unlike the destroyer Bagford, he has  no useful object in view, but simply follows a senseless kind of  classification. For instance: One set of volumes contains nothing but  copper-plate engraved titles, and woe betide the grand old Dutch folios  of the seventeenth century if they cross his path. Another is a volume  of coarse or quaint titles, which certainly answer the end of showing  how idiotic and conceited some authors have been. Here you find Dr.  Sib's \"Bowels opened in Divers Sermons,\" 1650, cheek by jowl with the  discourse attributed falsely to Huntington, the Calvinist, \"Die and  be damned,\" with many others too coarse to be quoted. The odd titles  adopted for his poems by Taylor, the water-poet, enliven several pages,  and make one's mouth water for the books themselves. A third volume  includes only such titles as have the printer's device. If you shut  your eyes to the injury done by such collectors, you may, to a certain  extent, enjoy the collection, for there is great beauty in some titles;  but such a pursuit is neither useful nor meritorious. By and by the end  comes, and then dispersion follows collection, and the volumes, which  probably Cost L200 each in their formation, will be knocked down to a  dealer for L10, finally gravitating into the South Kensington Library,  or some public museum, as a bibliographical curiosity. The following has  just been sold (July, 1880) by Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge, in  the Dunn-Gardinier collection, lot 1592:--    \"TITLEPAGES AND FRONTISPIECES.      _A Collection of upwards of_ 800 ENGRAVED TITLES AND FRONTISPIECES,  ENGLISH AND FOREIGN (_some very fine and curious) taken from old books  and neatly mounted on cartridge paper in 3 vol, half morocco gilt. imp.  folio_.\"      The only collection of title-pages which has afforded me unalloyed  pleasure is a handsome folio, published by the directors of the Plantin  Museum, Antwerp, in 1877, just after the purchase of that wonderful  typographical storehouse. It is called \"Titels en Portretten gesneden  naar P. P. Rubens voor de Plantijnsche Drukkerij,\" and it contains  thirty-five grand title pages, reprinted from the original seventeenth  century plates, designed by Rubens himself between the years 1612 and  1640, for various publications which issued from the celebrated Plantin  Printing Office. In the same Museum are preserved in Rubens' own  handwriting his charge for each design, duly receipted at foot.    I have now before me a fine copy of \"Coclusiones siue decisiones antique  dnor' de Rota,\" printed by Gutenberg's partner, Schoeffer, in the year  1477. It is perfect, except in a most vital part, the Colophon, which  has been cut out by some barbaric \"Collector,\" and which should read  thus: \"Pridie nonis Januarii Mcccclxxvij, in Civitate Moguntina,  impressorie Petrus Schoyffer de Gernsheym,\" followed by his well-known  mark, two shields.    A similar mania arose at the beginning of this century for collections  of illuminated initials, which were taken from MSS., and arranged on  the pages of a blank book in alphabetical order. Some of our cathedral  libraries suffered severely from depredations of this kind. At Lincoln,  in the early part of this century, the boys put on their robes in the  library, a room close to the choir. Here were numerous old MSS.,  and eight or ten rare Caxtons. The choir boys used often to amuse  themselves, while waiting for the signal to \"fall in,\" by cutting out  with their pen-knives the illuminated initials and vignettes, which they  would take into the choir with them and pass round from one to another.  The Dean and Chapter of those days were not much better, for they let  Dr. Dibdin have all their Caxtons for a \"consideration.\" He made  a little catalogue of them, which he called \"A Lincolne"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13029"],[0,"The Art of the Moving Picture (#11)"],[1,"nd.    In a comedy of the history of a newspaper, the very columns of the  publication are actors, and may be photographed oftener than the human  hero. And in the higher realms this same tendency gives particular power  to the panorama and trappings. It makes the natural and artificial  magnificence more than a narrative, more than a color-scheme, something  other than a drama. In a photoplay by a master, when the American flag is  shown, the thirteen stripes are columns of history and the stars are  headlines. The woods and the templed hills are their printing press,  almost in a literal sense.    Going back to the illustration of the engine, in chapter two, the  non-human thing is a personality, even if it is not beautiful. When it  takes on the ritual of decorative design, this new vitality is made  seductive, and when it is an object of nature, this seductive ritual  becomes a new pantheism. The armies upon the mountains they are defending  are rooted in the soil like trees. They resist invasion with the same  elementary stubbornness with which the oak resists the storm or the cliff  resists the wave.           *       *       *       *       *    Let the reader consider Antony and Cleopatra, the Cines film. It was  brought to America from Italy by George Klein. This and several ambitious  spectacles like it are direct violations of the foregoing principles.  True, it glorifies Rome. It is equivalent to waving the Italian above the  Egyptian flag, quite slowly for two hours. From the stage standpoint,  the magnificence is thoroughgoing. Viewed as a circus, the acting is  elephantine in its grandeur. All that is needed is pink lemonade sold in  the audience.    The famous Cabiria, a tale of war between Rome and Carthage, by  D'Annunzio, is a prime example of a success, where Antony and Cleopatra  and many European films founded upon the classics have been failures.  With obvious defects as a producer, D'Annunzio appreciates spectacular  symbolism. He has an instinct for the strange and the beautifully  infernal, as they are related to decorative design. Therefore he is able  to show us Carthage indeed. He has an Italian patriotism that amounts to  frenzy. So Rome emerges body and soul from the past, in this spectacle.  He gives us the cruelty of Baal, the intrepidity of the Roman legions.  Everything Punic or Italian in the middle distance or massed background  speaks of the very genius of the people concerned and actively generates  their kind of lightning.    The principals do not carry out the momentum of this immense resource.  The half a score of leading characters, with the costumes, gestures, and  aspects of gods, are after all works of the taxidermist. They are  stuffed gods. They conduct a silly nickelodeon romance while Carthage  rolls on toward her doom. They are like sparrows fighting for grain on  the edge of the battle.    The doings of his principals are sufficiently evident to be grasped with  a word or two of printed insert on the films. But he sentimentalizes  about them. He adds side-elaborations of the plot that would require much  time to make clear, and a hard working novelist to make interesting. We  are sentenced to stop and gaze long upon this array of printing in the  darkness, just at the moment the tenth wave of glory seems ready to sweep  in. But one hundred words cannot be a photoplay climax. The climax must  be in a tableau that is to the eye as the rising sun itself, that follows  the thousand flags of the dawn.    In the New York performance, and presumably in other large cities, there  was also an orchestra. Behold then, one layer of great photoplay, one  layer of bad melodrama, one layer of explanation, and a final cement of  music. It is as though in an art museum there should be a man at the door  selling would-be masterly short-stories about the paintings, and a man  with a violin playing the catalogue. But for further discourse on the  orchestra read the fourteenth chapter.    I left Cabiria with mixed emotions. And I had to forget the distressful  eye-strain. Few eyes submit without destruction to three hours of film.  But the mistakes of Cabiria are those of the pioneer work of genius. It  has in it twenty great productions. It abounds in suggestions. Once the  classic rules of this art-unit are established, men with equal genius  with D'Annunzio and no more devotion, will give us the world's  masterpieces. As it is, the background and mass-movements must stand as  monumental achievements in vital patriotic splendor.    D'Annunzio is Griffith's most inspired rival in these things. He lacks  Griffith's knowledge of what is photoplay and what is not. He lacks  Griffith's simplicity of hurdle-race plot. He lacks his avalanche-like  action. The Italian needs the American's health and clean winds. He needs  his foregrounds, leading actors, and types of plot. But the American has  never gone as deep as the Italian into landscapes that are their own  tragedians, and into Satanic and celestial ceremonials.    Judith of Bethulia and The Battle Hymn of the Republic have impressed me  as the two most significant photoplays I have ever encountered. They may  be classed with equal justice as religious or patriotic productions. But  for reasons which will appear, The Battle Hymn of the Republic will be  classed as a film of devotion and Judith as a patriotic one. The latter  was produced by D.W. Griffith, and released by the Biograph Company in  1914. The original stage drama was once played by the famous Boston  actress, Nance O'Neil. It is the work of Thomas Bailey Aldrich. The  motion picture scenario, when Griffith had done with it, had no especial  Aldrich flavor, though it contained several of the characters and events  as Aldrich conceived them. It was principally the old apocryphal story  plus the genius of Griffith and that inner circle of players whom he has  endowed with much of his point of view.    This is his cast of characters:--    Judith                                   Blanche Sweet  Holofernes                               Henry Walthall  His servant                              J.J. Lance  Captain of the Guards                    H. Hyde  Judith's maid                            Miss Bruce  General of the Jews                      C.H. Mailes  Priests                                  Messrs. Oppleman and Lestina  Nathan                                   Robert Harron  Naomi                                    Mae Marsh  Keeper of the slaves for Holofernes      Alfred Paget  The Jewish mother                        Lillian Gish    The Biograph Company advertises the production with the following Barnum  and Bailey enumeration: \"In four parts. Produced in California. Most  expensive Biograph ever produced. More than one thousand people and about  three hundred horsemen. The following were built expressly for the  production: a replica of the ancient city of Bethulia; the mammoth wall  that protected Bethulia; a faithful reproduction of the ancient army  camps, embodying all their barbaric splendor and dances; chariots,  battering rams, scaling ladders, archer towers, and other special war  paraphernalia of the period.    \"The following spectacular effects: the storming of the walls of the  city of Bethulia; the hand-to-hand conflicts; the death-defying chariot  charges at break-neck speed; the rearing and plunging horses infuriated  by the din of battle; the wonderful camp of the terrible Holofernes,  equipped with rugs brought from the far East; the dancing girls in their  exhibition of the exquisite and peculiar dances of the period; the  routing of the command of the terrible Holofernes, and the destruction of  the camp by fire. And overshadowing all, the heroism of the beautiful  Judith.\"    This advertisement should be compared with the notice of Your Girl and  Mine transcribed in the seventeenth chapter.    But there is another point of view by which this Judith of Bethulia  production may be approached, however striking the advertising notice.    There are four sorts of scenes alternated: (1) the particular history of  Judith; (2) the gentle courtship of Nathan and Naomi, types of the  inhabitants of Bethulia; (3) pictures of the streets, with the population  flowing like a sluggish river; (4) scenes of raid, camp, and battle,  interpolated between these, tying the whole together. The real plot is  the balanced alternation of all the elements. So many minutes of one,  then so many minutes of another. As was proper, very little of the tale  was thrown on the screen in reading matter, and no climax was ever a  printed word, but always an enthralling tableau.    The particular history of Judith begins with the picture of her as the  devout widow. She is austerely garbed, at prayer for her city, in her own  quiet house. Then later she is shown decked for the eyes of man in the  camp of Holofernes, where all is Assyrian glory. Judith struggles between  her unexpected love for the dynamic general and the resolve to destroy  him that brought her there. In either type of scene, the first gray and  silver, the other painted with Paul Veronese splendor, Judith moves with  a delicate deliberation. Over her face the emotions play like winds on a  meadow lake. Holofernes is the composite picture of all the Biblical  heathen chieftains. His every action breathes power. He is an Assyrian  bull, a winged lion, and a god at the same time, and divine honors are  paid to him every moment.    Nathan and Naomi are two Arcadian lovers. In their shy meetings they  express the life of the normal Bethulia. They are seen among the reapers  outside the city or at the well near the wall, or on the streets of the  ancient town. They are generally doing the things the crowd behind them  is doing, meanwhile evolving their own little heart affair. Finally when  the Assyrian comes down like a wolf on the fold, the gentle Naomi becomes  a prisoner in Holofernes' camp. She is in the"]]]
