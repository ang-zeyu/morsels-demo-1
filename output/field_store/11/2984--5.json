For he knew that all those titles had their origin and  nomenclature from military services, and belong to military men, like  their epaulets and spurs and chargers. They sound well enough against  the sword and helmet, but strangely in law-courts and cathedrals: but,  reformer as he was, he could not reform all this; he could only keep  clear of it in his own person.    I now come to the main object of my letter.    Subscriptions are advertised for the purpose of raising monuments  to Sir Robert Peel; and a motion has been made in Parliament for  one in Westminster Abbey at the public expense, Whatever may be the  precedents, surely the house of God should contain no object but  such as may remind us of His presence and our duty to Him. Long ago I  proposed that ranges of statues and busts should commemorate the great  worthies of our country. All the lower part of our National Gallery  might be laid open for this purpose. Even the best monuments in  Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's are deformities to the edifice. Let  us not continue this disgrace. Deficient as we are in architects,  we have many good statuaries, and we might well employ them on the  statues of illustrious commanders, and the busts of illustrious  statesmen and writers. Meanwhile our cities, and especially the  commercial, would, I am convinced, act more wisely, and more  satisfactorily to the relict of the deceased, if, instead of statues,  they erected schools and almshouses, with an inscription to his  memory.    We glory in about sixty whose busts and statues may occupy what are  now the \"deep solitudes and awful cells\" in our national gallery. Our  literary men of eminence are happily more numerous than the political  or the warlike, or both together. There is only one class of them  which might be advantageously excluded, namely, the theological; and  my reasons are these. First, their great talents were chiefly employed  on controversy; secondly, and consequently, their images would excite  dogmatical discord. Every sect of the Anglican Church, and every  class of dissenters, complaining of undue preferences. Painture and  sculpture lived in the midst of corruption, lived throughout it, and  seemed indeed to draw vitality from it, as flowers the most delicate  from noxious air; but they collapsed at the searching breath of free  inquiry, and could not abide persecution. The torch of Philosophy  never kindled the suffocating fagot, under whose smoke Theology was  mistaken for Religion. Theology had, until now, been speculative  and quiescent: she abandoned to Philosophy these humbler qualities:  instead of allaying and dissipating, as Philosophy had always done,  she excited and she directed animosities. Oriental in her parentage,  and keeping up her wide connections in that country, she acquired  there all the artifices most necessary to the furtherance of her  designs: among the rest was ventriloquism, which she quite perfected,  making her words seem to sound from above and from below and from  every side around. Ultimately, when men had fallen on their faces at  this miracle, she assumed the supreme power. Kings were her lackeys,  and nations the dust under her palfrey's hoof. By her sentence Truth  was gagged, scourged, branded, cast down on the earth in manacles; and  Fortitude, who had stood at Truth's side, was fastened with nails and  pulleys to the stake. I would not revive by any images, in the abode  of the graceful and the gentle Arts, these sorrowful reminiscences.  The vicissitudes of the world appear to be bringing round again the  spectral Past. Let us place great men between it and ourselves: they  all are tutelar: not the warrior and the statesman only; not only the  philosopher; but also the historian who follows them step by step, and  the poet who secures us from peril and dejection by his counter-charm.  Philosophers in most places are unwelcome: but there is no better  reason why Shaftesbury and Hobbes should be excluded from our  gallery, than why Epicurus should have been from Cicero's or Zeno from  Lucullus's. Of our sovereigns, I think Alfred, Cromwell, and William  III alone are eligible; and they, because they opposed successfully  the subverters of the laws. Three viceroys of Ireland will deservedly  be placed in the same receptacle; Sir John Perrot, Lord Chesterfield,  and (in due time) the last Lord-Deputy. One Speaker, one only, of the  Parliament; he without whom no Parliament would be now existing;  he who declared to Henry IV. that until all public grievances were  removed, no subsidy should be granted. The name of this Speaker may be  found in Rapin; English historians talk about facts, forgetting men.    Admirals and generals are numerous and conspicuous. Drake, Blake,  Rodney, Jervis, Nelson, Collingwood; the subduer of Algiers beaten  down for the French to occupy: and the defender of Acre, the first who  defeated, discomfited, routed, broke, and threw into shameful flight,  Bonaparte. Our generals are Marlborough, Peterborough, Wellington, and  that successor to his fame in India, who established the empire that  was falling from us, who achieved in a few days two arduous victories,  who never failed in any enterprise, who accomplished the most  difficult with the smallest expenditure of blood, who corrected  the disorders of the military, who gave the soldier an example of  temperance, the civilian of simplicity and frugality, and whose sole  (but exceedingly great) reward, was the approbation of our greatest  man.    With these come the statesmen of the Commonwealth, the students of  Bacon, the readers of Philip Sidney, the companions of Algernon, the  precursors of Locke and Newton. Opposite to them are Chaucer, Spenser,  Shakspeare, Milton; lower in dignity, Dryden, Pope, Gray, Goldsmith,  Cowper, Scott, Burns, Shelley, Southey, Byron, Wordsworth; the author  of _Hohenlinden_ and the _Battle of the Baltic_; and the glorious  woman who equaled these, two animated works in her _Ivan_ and  _Casabianca_. Historians have but recently risen up among us: and long  be it before, by command of Parliament, the chisel grates on the brow  of a Napier, a Grote, and Macaulay!

Warren Hastings  was the first to recognize the value of such knowledge; and to his  encouragement, if not to his incitement, we are indebted for the  compilation of Hindoo law translated by Halbed, Jones, Colebrooke,  Macnaghten, Hamilton, and a pretty numerous body of accomplished  men, of whom Mr. Baillie is the most recently enrolled laborer in  the vineyard, have carried on the good work. More comprehensive and  accurate views of Hindoo law have gradually been developed, and the  more advanced and more influential system of Mahometan jurisprudence  has also shared in the attention of European students. There is,  however, still much to be done in this field of inquiry; as a few  remarks on the nature of the present publication, and the source  whence its materials are derived, will show.    [Footnote 4: The Moohummadan Law of Sale, according to the Hunefeea  Code: from the Futawa Alumgeeree, a Digest of the whole Law, prepared  by command of the Emperor Aurungzebe Alumgeer. Selected and translated  from the original Arabic, with an Introduction and explanatory Notes,  by Neil B.E. Baillie, Author of \"The Moohummadan Law of inheritance.\"  Published by Smith and Elder.]    The law of Mahometan jurists is for India pretty much what the Roman  law is for Scotland and the Continental nations of Europe. Savigny has  shown how, throughout all the territories formerly included within the  limits of the Roman Empire, a large amount of Roman legal doctrines  and forms of procedure continued to be operative after the Empire's  subversion. The revival of the study of the Roman law, as embodied  in the compilations of Justinian, by the doctors of the school  of Bologna, augmented and systematized these remnants of Roman  jurisprudence, and extended their application to countries which (like  great part of Germany) had never been subjected to the sway of Rome.  In like manner, throughout that part of India which was permanently  subdued and organized by the Mogul dynasty, and also those parts in  which minor Islamitic states were established, the organization of  the courts of justice, and the legal opinions of the individuals who  officiated in them, necessarily introduced a large amount of Mahometan  jurisprudence. This element of the law of India was augmented and  systematized by the writings of private jurists, and by compilations  undertaken by command of princes. As with the Roman jurisprudence in  Europe, so with Mahometan jurisprudence in India, only so much of its  doctrines and forms could at any time be considered to possess legal  force as had been reenacted by the local sovereigns, or introduced by  judges in the form of decisions. A systematic knowledge of the whole  body of Mahometan law was important to the Indian lawyer, as enabling  him more thoroughly to understand the system, and its various isolated  doctrines; but the whole body of that law was at no time binding in  India. Since the establishment of British sway, only so much of the  Mahometan law as has kept its ground in the practice of the courts,  or has been reenacted by the \"regulations\" or \"ordinances\" of the  Anglo-Indian Government, _is law_; the rest is only valuable as the  \"antiquities of the law,\" which help to trace the origin of what  survives, and thereby throw light upon what in it is obscure or  doubtful.

The devil has indeed begotten a devil, even that spirit  Petrol. And the young devil waxeth, and increaseth in lustihood and is  ten years old and becoming like to his father. Come therefore and help  us with the ineffable seal.

The Bureau d'Echange de Maux    I often think of the Bureau d'Echange de Maux and the wondrously evil  old man that sate therein. It stood in a little street that there is  in Paris, its doorway made of three brown beams of wood, the top one  overlapping the others like the Greek letter _pi_, all the rest  painted green, a house far lower and narrower than its neighbours and  infinitely stranger, a thing to take one's fancy. And over the doorway  on the old brown beam in faded yellow letters this legend ran, Bureau  Universel d'Echanges de Maux.    I entered at once and accosted the listless man that lolled on a stool  by his counter. I demanded the wherefore of his wonderful house, what  evil wares he exchanged, with many other things that I wished to know,  for curiosity led me; and indeed had it not I had gone at once from  that shop, for there was so evil a look in that fattened man, in the  hang of his fallen cheeks and his sinful eye, that you would have said  he had had dealings with Hell and won the advantage by sheer  wickedness.    Such a man was mine host; but above all the evil of him lay in his  eyes, which lay so still, so apathetic, that you would have sworn that  he was drugged or dead; like lizards motionless on a wall they lay,  then suddenly they darted, and all his cunning flamed up and revealed  itself in what one moment before seemed no more than a sleepy and  ordinary wicked old man. And this was the object and trade of that  peculiar shop, the Bureau Universel d'Echange de Maux: you paid twenty  francs, which the old man proceeded to take from me, for admission to  the bureau and then had the right to exchange any evil or misfortune  with anyone on the premises for some evil or misfortune that he \"could  afford,\" as the old man put it.    There were four or five men in the dingy ends of that low-ceilinged  room who gesticulated and muttered softly in twos as men who make a  bargain, and now and then more came in, and the eyes of the flabby  owner of the house leaped up at them as they entered, seemed to know  their errands at once and each one's peculiar need, and fell back  again into somnolence, receiving his twenty francs in an almost  lifeless hand and biting the coin as though in pure absence of mind.    \"Some of my clients,\" he told me. So amazing to me was the trade of  this extraordinary shop that I engaged the old man in conversation,  repulsive though he was, and from his garrulity I gathered these  facts. He spoke in perfect English though his utterance was somewhat  thick and heavy; no language seemed to come amiss to him. He had been  in business a great many years, how many he would not say, and was far  older than he looked. All kinds of people did business in his shop.  What they exchanged with each other he did not care except that it had  to be evils, he was not empowered to carry on any other kind of  business.    There was no evil, he told me, that was not negotiable there; no evil  the old man knew had ever been taken away in despair from his shop. A  man might have to wait and come back again next day, and next day and  the day after, paying twenty francs each time, but the old man had the  addresses of all his clients and shrewdly knew their needs, and soon  the right two met and eagerly exchanged their commodities.  \"Commodities\" was the old man's terrible word, said with a gruesome  smack of his heavy lips, for he took a pride in his business and evils  to him were goods.    I learned from him in ten minutes very much of human nature, more than  I have ever learned from any other man; I learned from him that a  man's own evil is to him the worst thing there is or ever could be,  and that an evil so unbalances all men's minds that they always seek  for extremes in that small grim shop. A woman that had no children had  exchanged with an impoverished half-maddened creature with twelve. On  one occasion a man had exchanged wisdom for folly.    \"Why on earth did he do that?\" I said.    \"None of my business,\" the old man answered in his heavy indolent way.  He merely took his twenty francs from each and ratified the agreement  in the little room at the back opening out of the shop where his  clients do business. Apparently the man that had parted with wisdom  had left the shop upon the tips of his toes with a happy though  foolish expression all over his face, but the other went thoughtfully  away wearing a troubled and very puzzled look. Almost always it seemed  they did business in opposite evils.    But the thing that puzzled me most in all my talks with that unwieldy  man, the thing that puzzles me still, is that none that had once done  business in that shop ever returned again; a man might come day after  day for many weeks, but once do business and he never returned; so  much the old man told me, but when I asked him why, he only muttered  that he did not know.    It was to discover the wherefore of this strange thing and for no  other reason at all that I determined myself to do business sooner or  later in the little room at the back of that mysterious shop. I  determined to exchange some very trivial evil for some evil equally  slight, to seek for myself an advantage so very small as scarcely to  give Fate as it were a grip, for I deeply distrusted these bargains,  knowing well that man has never yet benefited by the marvellous and  that the more miraculous his advantage appears to be the more securely  and tightly do the gods or the witches catch him. In a few days more I  was going back to England and I was beginning to fear that I should be  sea-sick: this fear of sea-sickness, not the actual malady but only  the mere fear of it, I decided to exchange for a suitably little evil.  I did not know with whom I should be dealing, who in reality was the  head of the firm (one never does when shopping) but I decided that  neither Jew nor Devil could make very much on so small a bargain as  that.    I told the old man my project, and he scoffed at the smallness of my  commodity trying to urge me to some darker bargain, but could not move  me from my purpose. And then he told me tales with a somewhat boastful  air of the big business, the great bargains that had passed through  his hands. A man had once run in there to try and exchange death, he  had swallowed poison by accident and had only twelve hours to live.  That sinister old man had been able to oblige him. A client was  willing to exchange the commodity.    \"But what did he give in exchange for death?\" I said.    \"Life,\" said that grim old man with a furtive chuckle.    \"It must have been a horrible life,\" I said.    \"That was not my affair,\" the proprietor said, lazily rattling  together as he spoke a little pocketful of twenty-franc pieces.    Strange business I watched in that shop for the next few days, the  exchange of odd commodities, and heard strange mutterings in corners  amongst couples who presently rose and went to the back room, the old  man following to ratify.    Twice a day for a week I paid my twenty francs, watching life with its  great needs and its little needs morning and afternoon spread out  before me in all its wonderful variety.    And one day I met a comfortable man with only a little need, he seemed  to have the very evil I wanted. He always feared the lift was going to  break. I knew too much of hydraulics to fear things as silly as that,  but it was not my business to cure his ridiculous fear. Very few words  were needed to convince him that mine was the evil for him, he never  crossed the sea, and I on the other hand could always walk upstairs,  and I also felt at the time, as many must feel in that shop, that so  absurd a fear could never trouble me. And yet at times it is almost  the curse of my life. When we both had signed the parchment in the  spidery back room and the old man had signed and ratified (for which  we had to pay him fifty francs each) I went back to my hotel, and  there I saw the deadly thing in the basement. They asked me if I would  go upstairs in the lift, from force of habit I risked it, and I held  my breath all the way and clenched my hands. Nothing will induce me to  try such a journey again. I would sooner go up to my room in a  balloon. And why? Because if a balloon goes wrong you have a chance,  it may spread out into a parachute after it has burst, it may catch in  a tree, a hundred and one things may happen, but if the lift falls  down its shaft you are done. As for sea-sickness I shall never be sick  again, I cannot tell you why except that I know that it is so.    And the shop in which I made this remarkable bargain, the shop to  which none return when their business is done: I set out for it next  day. Blindfold I could have found my way to the unfashionable quarter  out of which a mean street runs, where you take the alley at the end,  whence runs the cul de sac where the queer shop stood. A shop with  pillars, fluted and painted red, stands on its near side, its other  neighbour is a low-class jeweller's with little silver brooches in the  window. In such incongruous company stood the shop with beams with its  walls painted green.    In half an hour I found the cul de sac to which I had gone twice a day  for the last week, I found the"]]]
