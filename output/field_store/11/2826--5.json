But  come, tell me for what price thou wilt sell me all of thy meat and thy  horse and cart.\"    \"At four marks do I value meat, cart, and mare,\" quoth the Butcher, \"but  if I do not sell all my meat I will not have four marks in value.\"    Then Robin Hood plucked the purse from his girdle, and quoth he, \"Here  in this purse are six marks.  Now, I would fain be a butcher for the day  and sell my meat in Nottingham Town.  Wilt thou close a bargain with me  and take six marks for thine outfit?\"    \"Now may the blessings of all the saints fall on thine honest head!\"  cried the Butcher right joyfully, as he leaped down from his cart and  took the purse that Robin held out to him.    \"Nay,\" quoth Robin, laughing loudly, \"many do like me and wish me well,  but few call me honest.  Now get thee gone back to thy lass, and give  her a sweet kiss from me.\"  So saying, he donned the Butcher's apron,  and, climbing into the cart, he took the reins in his hand and drove off  through the forest to Nottingham Town.    When he came to Nottingham, he entered that part of the market where  butchers stood, and took up his inn[Stand for selling] in the best  place he could find. Next, he opened his stall and spread his meat upon  the bench, then, taking his cleaver and steel and clattering them  together, he trolled aloud in merry tones:     \"Now come, ye lasses, and eke ye dames,       And buy your meat from me;   For three pennyworths of meat I sell       For the charge of one penny.     \"Lamb have I that hath fed upon nought       But the dainty dames pied,   And the violet sweet, and the daffodil       That grow fair streams beside.     \"And beef have I from the heathery words,       And mutton from dales all green,   And veal as white as a maiden's brow,       With its mother's milk, I ween.     \"Then come, ye lasses, and eke ye dames,       Come, buy your meat from me,   For three pennyworths of meat I sell       For the charge of one penny.\"    Thus he sang blithely, while all who stood near listened amazedly. Then,  when he had finished, he clattered the steel and cleaver still more  loudly, shouting lustily, \"Now, who'll buy?  Who'll buy? Four fixed  prices have I. Three pennyworths of meat I sell to a fat friar or priest  for sixpence, for I want not their custom; stout aldermen I charge  threepence, for it doth not matter to me whether they buy or not; to  buxom dames I sell three pennyworths of meat for one penny for I like  their custom well; but to the bonny lass that hath a liking for a good  tight butcher I charge nought but one fair kiss, for I like her custom  the best of all.\"    Then all began to stare and wonder and crowd around, laughing, for never  was such selling heard of in all Nottingham Town; but when they came to  buy they found it as he had said, for he gave goodwife or dame as much  meat for one penny as they could buy elsewhere for three, and when a  widow or a poor woman came to him, he gave her flesh for nothing; but  when a merry lass came and gave him a kiss, he charged not one penny for  his meat; and many such came to his stall, for his eyes were as blue as  the skies of June, and he laughed merrily, giving to each full measure.  Thus he sold his meat so fast that no butcher that stood near him could  sell anything.    Then they began to talk among themselves, and some said, \"This must be  some thief who has stolen cart, horse, and meat\"; but others said, \"Nay,  when did ye ever see a thief who parted with his goods so freely and  merrily?  This must be some prodigal who hath sold his father's land,  and would fain live merrily while the money lasts.\" And these latter  being the greater number, the others came round, one by one to their way  of thinking.    Then some of the butchers came to him to make his acquaintance. \"Come,  brother,\" quoth one who was the head of them all, \"we be all of one  trade, so wilt thou go dine with us? For this day the Sheriff hath asked  all the Butcher Guild to feast with him at the Guild Hall.  There will  be stout fare and much to drink, and that thou likest, or I much mistake  thee.\"    \"Now, beshrew his heart,\" quoth jolly Robin, \"that would deny a butcher.  And, moreover, I will go dine with you all, my sweet lads, and that as  fast as I can hie.\"  Whereupon, having sold all his meat, he closed his  stall and went with them to the great Guild Hall.    There the Sheriff had already come in state, and with him many butchers.  When Robin and those that were with him came in, all laughing at some  merry jest he had been telling them, those that were near the Sheriff  whispered to him, \"Yon is a right mad blade, for he hath sold more meat  for one penny this day than we could sell for three, and to whatsoever  merry lass gave him a kiss he gave meat for nought.\" And others said,  \"He is some prodigal that hath sold his land for silver and gold, and  meaneth to spend all right merrily.\"    Then the Sheriff called Robin to him, not knowing him in his butcher's  dress, and made him sit close to him on his right hand; for he loved a  rich young prodigal--especially when he thought that he might lighten  that prodigal's pockets into his own most worshipful purse. So he made  much of Robin, and laughed and talked with him more than with any of the  others.    At last the dinner was ready to be served and the Sheriff bade Robin say  grace, so Robin stood up and said, \"Now Heaven bless us all and eke good  meat and good sack within this house, and may all butchers be and remain  as honest men as I am.\"    At this all laughed, the Sheriff loudest of all, for he said to himself,  \"Surely this is indeed some prodigal, and perchance I may empty his  purse of some of the money that the fool throweth about so freely.\" Then  he spake aloud to Robin, saying, \"Thou art a jolly young blade, and I  love thee mightily\"; and he smote Robin upon the shoulder.    Then Robin laughed loudly too.  \"Yea,\" quoth he, \"I know thou dost love  a jolly blade, for didst thou not have jolly Robin Hood at thy shooting  match and didst thou not gladly give him a bright golden arrow for his  own?\"    At this the Sheriff looked grave and all the guild of butchers too, so  that none laughed but Robin, only some winked slyly at each other.    \"Come, fill us some sack!\" cried Robin.  \"Let us e'er be merry while we  may, for man is but dust, and he hath but a span to live here till the  worm getteth him, as our good gossip Swanthold sayeth; so let life be  merry while it lasts, say I. Nay, never look down i' the mouth, Sir  Sheriff.  Who knowest but that thou mayest catch Robin Hood yet, if thou  drinkest less good sack and Malmsey, and bringest down the fat about thy  paunch and the dust from out thy brain. Be merry, man.\"    Then the Sheriff laughed again, but not as though he liked the jest,  while the butchers said, one to another, \"Before Heaven, never have we  seen such a mad rollicking blade.  Mayhap, though, he will make the  Sheriff mad.\"    \"How now, brothers,\" cried Robin, \"be merry! nay, never count over your  farthings, for by this and by that I will pay this shot myself, e'en  though it cost two hundred pounds. So let no man draw up his lip, nor  thrust his forefinger into his purse, for I swear that neither butcher  nor Sheriff shall pay one penny for this feast.\"    \"Now thou art a right merry soul,\" quoth the Sheriff, \"and I wot thou  must have many a head of horned beasts and many an acre of land, that  thou dost spend thy money so freely.\"    \"Ay, that have I,\" quoth Robin, laughing loudly again, \"five hundred and  more horned beasts have I and my brothers, and none of them have we been  able to sell, else I might not have turned butcher. As for my land, I  have never asked my steward how many acres I have.\"    At this the Sheriff's eyes twinkled, and he chuckled to himself. \"Nay,  good youth,\" quoth he, \"if thou canst not sell thy cattle, it may be I  will find a man that will lift them from thy hands; perhaps that man may  be myself, for I love a merry youth and would help such a one along the  path of life.  Now how much dost thou want for thy horned cattle?\"    \"Well,\" quoth Robin, \"they are worth at least five hundred pounds.\"    \"Nay,\" answered the Sheriff slowly, and as if he were thinking within  himself, \"well do I love thee, and fain would I help thee along, but  five hundred pounds in money is a good round sum; besides I have it not  by me. Yet I will give thee three hundred pounds for them all, and that  in good hard silver and gold.\"    \"Now thou old miser!\" quoth Robin, \"well thou knowest that so many  horned cattle are worth seven hundred pounds and more, and even that is  but small for them, and yet thou, with thy gray hairs and one foot in  the grave, wouldst trade upon the folly of a wild youth.\"    At this the Sheriff looked grimly at Robin.  \"Nay,\" quoth Robin, \"look  not on me as though thou hadst sour beer in thy mouth, man. I will take  thine offer, for I and my brothers do need the money. We lead a merry  life, and no one leads a merry life for a farthing, so I will close the  bargain with thee.  But mind that thou bringest a good three hundred  pounds with thee, for I trust not one that driveth so shrewd a bargain.\"    \"I will bring the money,\" said the Sheriff.  \"But what is thy name, good  youth?\"    \"Men call me Robert o' Locksley,\" quoth bold Robin.    \"Then, good Robert o' Locksley,\" quoth the Sheriff, \"I will come this  day to see thy horned beasts.  But first my clerk shall draw up a paper  in which thou shalt be bound to the sale, for thou gettest not my money  without I get thy beasts in return.\"    Then Robin Hood laughed again.  \"So be it,\" he said, smiting his palm  upon the Sheriff's hand.  \"Truly my brothers will be thankful to thee  for thy money.\"    Thus the bargain was closed, but many of the butchers talked among  themselves of the Sheriff, saying that it was but a scurvy trick to  beguile a poor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1015"],[0,"The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life (#11)"],[1,"encircled by  bushes and a rock or two. The water lay in the bottom of a hollow, the  smooth prairie gracefully rising in oceanlike swells on every side.  We pitched our tents by it; not however before the keen eye of Henry  Chatillon had discerned some unusual object upon the faintly-defined  outline of the distant swell. But in the moist, hazy atmosphere of the  evening, nothing could be clearly distinguished. As we lay around the  fire after supper, a low and distant sound, strange enough amid the  loneliness of the prairie, reached our ears--peals of laughter, and the  faint voices of men and women. For eight days we had not encountered a  human being, and this singular warning of their vicinity had an effect  extremely wild and impressive.    About dark a sallow-faced fellow descended the hill on horseback, and  splashing through the pool rode up to the tents. He was enveloped in a  huge cloak, and his broad felt hat was weeping about his ears with  the drizzling moisture of the evening. Another followed, a stout,  square-built, intelligent-looking man, who announced himself as leader  of an emigrant party encamped a mile in advance of us. About twenty  wagons, he said, were with him; the rest of his party were on the  other side of the Big Blue, waiting for a woman who was in the pains of  child-birth, and quarreling meanwhile among themselves.    These were the first emigrants that we had overtaken, although we had  found abundant and melancholy traces of their progress throughout the  whole course of the journey. Sometimes we passed the grave of one who  had sickened and died on the way. The earth was usually torn up, and  covered thickly with wolf-tracks. Some had escaped this violation. One  morning a piece of plank, standing upright on the summit of a grassy  hill, attracted our notice, and riding up to it we found the following  words very roughly traced upon it, apparently by a red-hot piece of  iron:      MARY ELLIS    DIED MAY 7TH, 1845.    Aged two months.      Such tokens were of common occurrence, nothing could speak more for the  hardihood, or rather infatuation, of the adventurers, or the sufferings  that await them upon the journey.    We were late in breaking up our camp on the following morning, and  scarcely had we ridden a mile when we saw, far in advance of us, drawn  against the horizon, a line of objects stretching at regular intervals  along the level edge of the prairie. An intervening swell soon hid them  from sight, until, ascending it a quarter of an hour after, we saw close  before us the emigrant caravan, with its heavy white wagons creeping on  in their slow procession, and a large drove of cattle following behind.  Half a dozen yellow-visaged Missourians, mounted on horseback, were  cursing and shouting among them; their lank angular proportions  enveloped in brown homespun, evidently cut and adjusted by the hands  of a domestic female tailor. As we approached, they greeted us with  the polished salutation: \"How are ye, boys? Are ye for Oregon or  California?\"    As we pushed rapidly past the wagons, children's faces were thrust  out from the white coverings to look at us; while the care-worn,  thin-featured matron, or the buxom girl, seated in front, suspended  the knitting on which most of them were engaged to stare at us with  wondering curiosity. By the side of each wagon stalked the proprietor,  urging on his patient oxen, who shouldered heavily along, inch by  inch, on their interminable journey. It was easy to see that fear and  dissension prevailed among them; some of the men--but these, with one  exception, were bachelors--looked wistfully upon us as we rode lightly  and swiftly past, and then impatiently at their own lumbering wagons  and heavy-gaited oxen. Others were unwilling to advance at all until  the party they had left behind should have rejoined them. Many were  murmuring against the leader they had chosen, and wished to depose him;  and this discontent was fermented by some ambitious spirits, who had  hopes of succeeding in his place. The women were divided between regrets  for the homes they had left and apprehension of the deserts and the  savages before them.    We soon left them far behind, and fondly hoped that we had taken a final  leave; but unluckily our companions' wagon stuck so long in a deep muddy  ditch that, before it was extricated, the van of the emigrant caravan  appeared again, descending a ridge close at hand. Wagon after wagon  plunged through the mud; and as it was nearly noon, and the place  promised shade and water, we saw with much gratification that they were  resolved to encamp. Soon the wagons were wheeled into a circle; the  cattle were grazing over the meadow, and the men with sour, sullen  faces, were looking about for wood and water. They seemed to meet with  but indifferent success. As we left the ground, I saw a tall slouching  fellow with the nasal accent of \"down east,\" contemplating the contents  of his tin cup, which he had just filled with water.    \"Look here, you,\" he said; \"it's chock full of animals!\"    The cup, as he held it out, exhibited in fact an extraordinary variety  and profusion of animal and vegetable life.    Riding up the little hill and looking back on the meadow, we could  easily see that all was not right in the camp of the emigrants. The  men were crowded together, and an angry discussion seemed to be going  forward. R. was missing from his wonted place in the line, and the  captain told us that he had remained behind to get his horse shod by a  blacksmith who was attached to the emigrant party. Something whispered  in our ears that mischief was on foot; we kept on, however, and coming  soon to a stream of tolerable water, we stopped to rest and dine. Still  the absentee lingered behind. At last, at the distance of a mile, he  and his horse suddenly appeared, sharply defined against the sky on the  summit of a hill; and close behind, a huge white object rose slowly into  view.    \"What is that blockhead bringing with him now?\"    A moment dispelled the mystery. Slowly and solemnly one behind the  other, four long trains of oxen and four emigrant wagons rolled over the  crest of the declivity and gravely descended, while R. rode in state  in the van. It seems that, during the process of shoeing the horse,  the smothered dissensions among the emigrants suddenly broke into open  rupture. Some insisted on pushing forward, some on remaining where they  were, and some on going back. Kearsley, their captain, threw up his  command in disgust. \"And now, boys,\" said he, \"if any of you are for  going ahead, just you come along with me.\"    Four wagons, with ten men, one woman, and one small child, made up  the force of the \"go-ahead\" faction, and R., with his usual proclivity  toward mischief, invited them to join our party. Fear of the  Indians--for I can conceive of no other motive--must have induced him  to court so burdensome an alliance. As may well be conceived, these  repeated instances of high-handed dealing sufficiently exasperated  us. In this case, indeed, the men who joined us were all that could be  desired; rude indeed in manner, but frank, manly, and intelligent.  To tell them we could not travel with them was of course out of the  question. I merely reminded Kearsley that if his oxen could not keep up  with our mules he must expect to be left behind, as we could not consent  to be further delayed on the journey; but he immediately replied, that  his oxen \"SHOULD keep up; and if they couldn't, why he allowed that he'd  find out how to make 'em!\" Having availed myself of what satisfaction  could be derived from giving R. to understand my opinion of his conduct,  I returned to our side of the camp.    On the next day, as it chanced, our English companions broke the  axle-tree of their wagon, and down came the whole cumbrous machine  lumbering into the bed of a brook! Here was a day's work cut out for us.  Meanwhile, our emigrant associates kept on their way, and so vigorously  did they urge forward their powerful oxen that, with the broken  axle-tree and other calamities, it was full a week before we overtook  them; when at length we discovered them, one afternoon, crawling quietly  along the sandy brink of the Platte. But meanwhile various incidents  occurred to ourselves.    It was probable that at this stage of our journey the Pawnees would  attempt to rob us. We began therefore to stand guard in turn, dividing  the night into three watches, and appointing two men for each. Delorier  and I held guard together. We did not march with military precision to  and fro before the tents; our discipline was by no means so stringent  and rigid. We wrapped ourselves in our blankets, and sat down by the  fire; and Delorier, combining his culinary functions with his duties as  sentinel, employed himself in boiling the head of an antelope for our  morning's repast. Yet we were models of vigilance in comparison with  some of the party; for the ordinary practice of the guard was to  establish himself in the most comfortable posture he could; lay his  rifle on the ground, and enveloping his nose in the blanket, meditate  on his mistress, or whatever subject best pleased him. This is all well  enough when among Indians who do not habitually proceed further in their  hostility than robbing travelers of their horses and mules, though,  indeed, a Pawnee's forebearance is not always to be trusted; but in  certain regions farther to the west, the guard must beware how he  exposes his person to the light of the fire, lest perchance some  keen-eyed skulking marksman should let fly a bullet or an arrow from  amid the darkness.    Among various tales that circulated around our camp fire was a rather  curious one, told by Boisverd, and not inappropriate here. Boisverd was  trapping with several companions on the skirts of the Blackfoot country.  The man on guard, well knowing that it behooved him to put forth his "]]]
