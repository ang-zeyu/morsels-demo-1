Catherine, at first, was struck with  awe.    \"It is herself,\" she cried; \"it is the Queen of Heaven. I never saw one  like her to my mind before.\"    \"And her eyes, mother: lifted to the sky, as if they belonged there, and  not to a mortal creature. And her beautiful hair of burning gold.\"    \"And to think I have a son that can make the saints live again upon a  piece of wood!\"    \"The reason is, he is a young saint himself, mother. He is too good for  this world; he is here to portray the blessed, and then to go away and  be with them for ever.\"    Ere they had half done admiring it, a strange voice was heard at the  door. By one of the furtive instincts of their sex they hastily hid the  picture in the cloth, though there was no need, And the next moment in  came, casting his eyes furtively around, a man that had not entered the  house this ten years Ghysbrecht Van Swieten.    The two women were so taken by surprise, that they merely stared at  him and at one another, and said, \"The burgomaster!\" in a tone so  expressive, that Ghysbrecht felt compelled to answer it.    \"Yes! I own the last time I came here was not on a friendly errand. Men  love their own interest--Eli's and mine were contrary. Well, let this  visit atone the last. To-day I come on your business and none of mine.\"  Catherine and her daughter exchanged a swift glance of contemptuous  incredulity. They knew the man better than he thought.    \"It is about your son Gerard.\"    \"Ay! ay! you want him to work for the town all for nothing. He told us.\"    \"I come on no such errand. It is to let you know he has fallen into bad  hands.\"    \"Now Heaven and the saints forbid! Man, torture not a mother! Speak out,  and quickly: speak ere you have time to coin falsehood: we know thee.\"    Ghysbrecht turned pale at this affront, and spite mingled with the other  motives that brought him here. \"Thus it is, then,\" said he, grinding his  teeth and speaking very fast. \"Your son Gerard is more like to be father  of a family than a priest: he is for ever with Margaret, Peter Brandt's  red-haired girl, and loves her like a cow her calf.\"    Mother and daughter both burst out laughing. Ghysbrecht stared at them.    \"What! you knew it?\"    \"Carry this tale to those who know not my son, Gerard. Women are nought  to him.\"    \"Other women, mayhap. But this one is the apple of his eye to him, or  will be, if you part them not, and soon. Come, dame, make me not waste  time and friendly counsel: my servant has seen them together a score  times, handed, and reading babies in one another's eyes like--you know,  dame--you have been young, too.\"    \"Girl, I am ill at ease. Yea, I have been young, and know how blind  and foolish the young are. My heart! he has turned me sick in a moment.  Kate, if it should be true?\"    \"Nay, nay!\" cried Kate eagerly. \"Gerard might love a young woman: all  young men do: I can't find what they see in them to love so; but if he  did, he would let us know; he would not deceive us. You wicked man!  No, dear mother, look not so! Gerard is too good to love a creature of  earth. His love is for our Lady and the saints. Ah! I will show you the  picture there: if his heart was earthly, could he paint the Queen  of Heaven like that--look! look!\" and she held the picture out  triumphantly, and, more radiant and beautiful in this moment of  enthusiasm than ever dead picture was or will be, over-powered the  burgomaster with her eloquence and her feminine proof of Gerard's  purity. His eyes and mouth opened, and remained open: in which state  they kept turning, face and all as if on a pivot, from the picture to  the women, and from the women to the picture.    \"Why, it is herself,\" he gasped.    \"Isn't it!\" cried Kate, and her hostility was softened. \"You admire it?  I forgive you for frightening us.\"    \"Am I in a mad-house?\" said Ghysbrecht Van Swieten thoroughly puzzled.  \"You show me a picture of the girl; and you say he painted it; and that  is a proof he cannot love her. Why, they all paint their sweethearts,  painters do.\"    \"A picture of the girl?\" exclaimed Kate, shocked. \"Fie! this is no girl;  this is our blessed Lady.\"    \"No, no; it is Margaret Brandt.\"    \"Oh blind! It is the Queen of Heaven.\"    \"No; only of Sevenbergen village.\"    \"Profane man! behold her crown!\"    \"Silly child! look at her red hair! Would the Virgin be seen in red  hair? She who had the pick of all the colours ten thousand years before  the world began.\"    At this moment an anxious face was insinuated round the edge of the open  door: it was their neighbour Peter Buyskens.    \"What is to do?\" said he in a cautious whisper. \"We can hear you all  across the street. What on earth is to do?\"    \"Oh, neighbour! What is to do? Why, here is the burgomaster blackening  our Gerard.\"    \"Stop!\" cried Van Swieten. \"Peter Buyskens is come in the nick of time.  He knows father and daughter both. They cast their glamour on him.\"    \"What! is she a witch too?\"    \"Else the egg takes not after the bird. Why is her father called the  magician? I tell you they bewitched this very Peter here; they cast  unholy spells on him, and cured him of the colic: now, Peter, look and  tell me who is that? and you be silent, women, for a moment, if you can;  who is it, Peter?\"    \"Well, to be sure!\" said Peter, in reply; and his eye seemed fascinated  by the picture.    \"Who is it?\" repeated Ghysbrecht impetuously.    Peter Buyskens smiled. \"Why, you know as well as I do; but what have  they put a crown on her for? I never saw her in a crown, for my part.\"    \"Man alive! Can't you open your great jaws, and just speak a wench's  name plain out to oblige three people?\"    \"I'd do a great deal more to oblige one of you than that, burgomaster.  If it isn't as natural as life!\"    \"Curse the man! he won't, he won't--curse him!\"    \"Why, what have I done now?\"    \"Oh, sir!\" said little Kate, \"for pity's sake tell us; are these the  features of a living woman, of--of--Margaret Brandt?\"    \"A mirror is not truer, my little maid.\"    \"But is it she, sir, for very certain?\"    \"Why, who else should it be?\"    \"Now, why couldn't you say so at once?\" snarled Ghysbrecht.    \"I did say so, as plain as I could speak,\" snapped Peter; and they  growled over this small bone of contention so zealously, that they did  not see Catherine and her daughter had thrown their aprons over their  heads, and were rocking to and fro in deep distress. The next moment  Elias came in from the shop, and stood aghast. Catherine, though her  face was covered, knew his footstep.    \"That is my poor man,\" she sobbed. \"Tell him, good Peter Buyskens, for I  have not the courage.\"    Elias turned pale. The presence of the burgomaster in his house, after  so many years of coolness, coupled with his wife's and daughter's  distress, made him fear some heavy misfortune.    \"Richart! Jacob!\" he gasped.    \"No, no!\" said the burgomaster; \"it is nearer home, and nobody is dead  or dying, old friend.\"    \"God bless you, burgomaster! Ah! something has gone off my breast that  was like to choke me. Now, what is the matter?\"    Ghysbrecht then told him all that he told the women, and showed the  picture in evidence.    \"Is that all?\" said Eli, profoundly relieved. \"What are ye roaring and  bellowing for? It is vexing--it is angering, but it is not like death,  not even sickness. Boys will be boys. He will outgrow that disease: 'tis  but skin-deep.\"    But when Ghysbrecht told him that Margaret was a girl of good character;  that it was not to be supposed she would be so intimate if marriage had  not been spoken of between them, his brow darkened.    \"Marriage! that shall never be,\" said he sternly. \"I'll stay that; ay,  by force, if need be--as I would his hand lifted to cut his throat. I'd  do what old John Koestein did t'other day.\"    \"And what is that, in Heaven's name?\" asked the mother, suddenly  removing her apron.    It was the burgomaster who replied:    \"He made me shut young Albert Koestein up in the prison of the  Stadthouse till he knocked under. It was not long: forty-eight hours,  all alone, on bread and water, cooled his hot stomach. 'Tell my father I  am his humble servant,' says he, 'and let me into the sun once more--the  sun is worth all the wenches in the world.'\"    \"Oh, the cruelty of men!\" sighed Catherine.    \"As to that, the burgomaster has no choice: it is the law. And if a  father says, 'Burgomaster, lock up my son,' he must do it. A fine thing  it would be if a father might not lock up his own son.\"    \"Well, well! it won't come to that with me and my son. He never  disobeyed me in his life: he never shall, Where is he? It is past  supper-time. Where is he, Kate?\"    \"Alas! I know not, father.\"    \"I know,\" said Ghysbrecht; \"he is at Sevenbergen. My servant met him on  the road.\"    Supper passed in gloomy silence. Evening descended--no Gerard! Eight  o'clock came--no Gerard! Then the father sent all to bed, except  Catherine.    \"You and I will walk abroad, wife, and talk over this new care.\"    \"Abroad, my man, at this time? Whither?\"    \"Why, on the road to Sevenbergen.\"    \"Oh no; no hasty words, father. Poor Gerard! he never vexed you before.\"    \"Fear me not. But it must end; and I am not one that trusts to-morrow  with to-day's work.\"    The old pair walked hand in hand; for, strange is it may appear to  some of my readers, the use of the elbow to couples walking was not  discovered in Europe till centuries after this. They sauntered on a long  time in silence. The night was clear and balmy. Such nights, calm and  silent, recall the past from the dead.    \"It is a many years since we walked so late, my man,\" said Catherine  softly.    \"Ay, sweetheart, more than we shall see again (is he never coming, I  wonder?)\"    \"Not since our courting days, Eli.\"    \"No. Ay, you were a buxom lass then.\"    \"And you were a comely lad, as ever a girl's eye stole a look at.

On  the fourth day of our isolation the river subsided as rapidly as it had  risen.    We had good patrolling conditions, and each day we made long circuits.  Sometimes we would run into a body of enemy cavalry and have a skirmish  with them. Again we would come upon an infantry outpost and manoeuvre  about in an effort to damage it. The enemy set traps for us, digging big  holes in the road and covering them over with matting on which they  scattered dirt to make the surface appear normal. The nearest town  occupied by the Turks was Kara Tepe, distant from Mirjana eight or ten  miles as the crow flies. In the debatable land were a number of native  villages, and such inhabitants as remained in them led an unpleasantly  eventful existence. In the morning they would be visited by a Turkish  patrol, which would be displaced by us in our rounds. Perhaps in the  evening a band of wild mountainy Kurds would blow in and run off some of  their few remaining sheep. Then the Turks would return and accuse them of  having given us information, and carry off some hostages or possibly beat  a couple of them for having received us, although goodness knows they had  little enough choice in the matter. There was one old sheik with whom I  used often to sit and gossip while an attendant was roasting the berries  for our coffee over the near-by fire. He was ever asking why we couldn't  make an advance and put his village safely behind our lines, so that the  children could grow fat and the herds graze unharmed. In this country  Kurdish and Turkish were spoken as frequently as Arabic, and many of the  names of places were Turkish--such as Kara Tepe, which means Black  Mountain, and Kizil Robat, the Tomb of the Maidens. My spelling of these  names differs from that found on many maps. It would be a great  convenience if some common method could be agreed upon. At present the  map-makers conform only in a unanimous desire to each use a different  transliteration.    Kizil Robat is an attractive town. I spent some pleasant mornings  wandering about it with the mayor, Jameel Bey, a fine-looking Kurdish  chieftain of the Jaf tribe. He owned a lovely garden with date-palms,  oranges, pomegranates, and figs. Tattered Kurds were working on the  irrigation ditches, and a heap of rags lying below the wall in the sun  changed itself into a small boy, just as I was about to step on it.  Jameel's son was as white, with as rosy cheeks, as any American baby.    Harry Bowen, brother-in-law of General Cobbe, was the political officer  in charge of Kizil Robat. He spoke excellent Arabic and was much respected  by the natives. His house was an oasis in which I could always look  forward to a pleasant talk, an excellent native dinner, and some  interesting book to carry off. Although the town was small, there were  three good Turkish baths. One of them belonged to Jameel Bey, but, judging  from the children tending babies while squatting in the entrance portico,  was generally given over to the distaff side and its friends. The one  which we patronized, while not so grand a building, had an old Persian who  understood the art of massage thoroughly, and there was nothing more  restful after a number of days' hard work with the cars.    In the end of February there passed through Kizil Robat the last  contingent of our former Russian Allies. They were Cossacks--a  fine-looking lot as they rode along perched on their small chunky saddles  atop of their unkempt but hardy ponies. When Russia went out of the war  they asked permission to keep on fighting with us. They were a good deal  of a problem, for they had no idea whatever of discipline, and it was most  difficult to keep them in hand and stop them from pillaging the natives  indiscriminately. They had been completely cut off from Russia for a long  time but were now on their way back. A very intelligent woman doctor and a  number of nurses who had been with them were sick with smallpox in one of  our hospitals in Baghdad. When they recovered they were sent to India, for  it was not feasible to repatriate them by way of Persia. When the Russians  first established connection with us, some armored cars were sent to bring  in the Cossack general, whose name we were told was Leslie. We were  unprepared to find that he spoke no English! It turned out that his  ancestors had gone over from Scotland to the court of Peter the Great.          V    THE ADVANCE ON THE EUPHRATES      Early in March we got orders to return to Baghdad, where all the armored  cars were to be concentrated preparatory to an attack on the Euphrates  front. There was much speculation as to our mission. Some said that we  were to break through and establish connection with General Allenby's  forces in Palestine. While I know nothing about it authoritatively, it is  certain that if the state of affairs in France had not called for the  withdrawal from the East of all the troops that could be spared, the  attack that was launched in October would have taken place in March. We  could then have advanced up the Euphrates, and it would have been entirely  practical to cross over the desert in the cars by way of Tadmor.    When we got word to come in, the roads were in fearful shape and the rain  was falling in torrents, but we were so afraid that we might miss the  attack that we salvaged everything not essential and started to fight our  way through the mud. It was a slow and wearisome process, but we managed  to get as far as Bakuba by evening. The river was rising in one of its  periodical floods and we found that the pontoon bridge had been cut half  an hour before our arrival. No one could predict how long the flood would  last, but the river rarely went down sufficiently to allow the bridge to  be replaced within a week. At that time the railroad went only as far as  Bakuba, and crossed the river on a wooden trestle, so I decided to try to  load the motors on a flat car and get across the Diyala in that way.    After having made arrangements to do this I wandered off into the bazaar  to get something to eat. In native fashion I first bought a big flap of  bread from an old woman, and then went to a pickle booth to get some  beets, which I wrapped in my bread. Next I proceeded to a meat-shop and  ordered some lamb kababs roasted. The meat is cut in pellets, spitted on  rods six or eight inches long, and lain over the glowing charcoal embers.  In the shop there are long tables with benches beside them. The customer  spreads his former purchases, and when his kababs are ready he eats his  dinner. He next proceeds to a coffee-house, where he has a couple of  glasses of tea and three or four diminutive cups of coffee to top off, and  the meal is finished. The Arab eats sparingly as a rule, but when he gives  or attends a banquet he stuffs himself to his utmost capacity.    Next morning we loaded our cars successfully and started off by rail for  Baghdad, some thirty miles away. The railroad wound across the desert,  with here and there a water-tank with a company from a native regiment  guarding it. As we stopped at one particularly desolate spot, a young  officer came running up and asked if we would have tea with him. He took  us to his tent, where everything was ready, for he apparently always met  the two trains that passed through daily. Poor fellow, he was only a  little over twenty, and desperately lonely and homesick. Many of the young  officers who were wounded in France were sent to India with the idea that  they could be training men and getting on to the methods of the Indian  army while yet recuperating and unfit to go back to the front. They were  shipped out with a new draft when they had fully recovered. This boy had  only been a month in the country, and ten days before had been sent off in  charge of his Sikh company to do this wearisome guard duty.    We spent a few days in Baghdad refitting. The cars were to go out  camouflaged to resemble supply-trucks, for every precaution was taken to  prevent the Turks from realizing that we were massing men for an attack.  The night before we were to start, word came in that the political officer  at Nejef had been murdered, and the town was in revolt. We were ordered to  send a section there immediately, so Lieutenant Ballingal's was chosen,  while the rest of us left next morning with the balance of the battery for  Hit. The first part of the route lay across the desert to Falujah, a  prosperous agricultural town on the Euphrates. Rail-head lies just beyond  at a place known as Tel El Dhubban--the \"Hill of the Flies.\" From there on  supplies were brought forward by motor transport, or in Arab barges,  called shakturs. We crossed the river on a bridge of boats and continued  up along the bank to Ramadie. Here I stayed over, detailed to escort the  army commander on a tour of inspection.    The smaller towns along the Euphrates are far more attractive than those  on the Tigris. The country seems more developed, and most inviting  gardens surround the villages. Hit, which lies twenty miles up-stream of  Ramadie, is an exception. It is of ancient origin and built upon a hill,  with a lovely view of the river. It has not a vestige of green on it, but  stands out bleak and harsh in contrast to the palm-groves fringing the  bank. The bitumen wells near by have been worked for five thousand years  and are responsible for the town being a centre of boat manufacture. With  the bitumen, the gufas and mahelas are \"pitched without and within,\" in  the identical manner in which we are told that the ark was built. The jars  in which the women of the town draw water from the river, instead of being  of copper or earthenware as elsewhere, are here made of pitched  wicker-work. The smell of the boiling bitumen and the sulphur springs is  trying to a stranger,"]]]
