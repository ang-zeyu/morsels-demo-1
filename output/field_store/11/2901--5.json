[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],[0,"Poems (#11)"],[1,"barefoot,  I more than once, at morn,    Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash  Unbraiding in the sun, --  When, stooping to secure it,  It wrinkled, and was gone.    Several of nature's people  I know, and they know me;  I feel for them a transport  Of cordiality;    But never met this fellow,  Attended or alone,  Without a tighter breathing,  And zero at the bone.            XXV.    THE MUSHROOM.    The mushroom is the elf of plants,  At evening it is not;  At morning in a truffled hut  It stops upon a spot    As if it tarried always;  And yet its whole career  Is shorter than a snake's delay,  And fleeter than a tare.    'T is vegetation's juggler,  The germ of alibi;  Doth like a bubble antedate,  And like a bubble hie.    I feel as if the grass were pleased  To have it intermit;  The surreptitious scion  Of summer's circumspect.    Had nature any outcast face,  Could she a son contemn,  Had nature an Iscariot,  That mushroom, -- it is him.            XXVI.    THE STORM.    There came a wind like a bugle;  It quivered through the grass,  And a green chill upon the heat  So ominous did pass  We barred the windows and the doors  As from an emerald ghost;  The doom's electric moccason  That very instant passed.  On a strange mob of panting trees,  And fences fled away,  And rivers where the houses ran  The living looked that day.  The bell within the steeple wild  The flying tidings whirled.  How much can come  And much can go,  And yet abide the world!            XXVII.    THE SPIDER.    A spider sewed at night  Without a light  Upon an arc of white.  If ruff it was of dame  Or shroud of gnome,  Himself, himself inform.  Of immortality  His strategy  Was physiognomy.            XXVIII.    I know a place where summer strives  With such a practised frost,  She each year leads her daisies back,  Recording briefly, \"Lost.\"    But when the south wind stirs the pools  And struggles in the lanes,  Her heart misgives her for her vow,  And she pours soft refrains    Into the lap of adamant,  And spices, and the dew,  That stiffens quietly to quartz,  Upon her amber shoe.            XXIX.    The one that could repeat the summer day  Were greater than itself, though he  Minutest of mankind might be.  And who could reproduce the sun,  At period of going down --  The lingering and the stain, I mean --  When Orient has been outgrown,  And Occident becomes unknown,  His name remain.            XXX.    THE WIND'S VISIT.    The wind tapped like a tired man,  And like a host, \"Come in,\"  I boldly answered; entered then  My residence within    A rapid, footless guest,  To offer whom a chair  Were as impossible as hand  A sofa to the air.    No bone had he to bind him,  His speech was like the push  Of numerous humming-birds at once  From a superior bush.    His countenance a billow,  His fingers, if he pass,  Let go a music, as of tunes  Blown tremulous in glass.    He visited, still flitting;  Then, like a timid man,  Again he tapped -- 't was flurriedly --  And I became alone.            XXXI.    Nature rarer uses yellow     Than another hue;  Saves she all of that for sunsets, --     Prodigal of blue,    Spending scarlet like a woman,     Yellow she affords  Only scantly and selectly,     Like a lover's words.            XXXII.    GOSSIP.    The leaves, like women, interchange    Sagacious confidence;  Somewhat of nods, and somewhat of    Portentous inference,    The parties in both cases    Enjoining secrecy, --  Inviolable compact    To notoriety.            XXXIII.    SIMPLICITY.    How happy is the little stone  That rambles in the road alone,  And doesn't care about careers,  And exigencies never fears;  Whose coat of elemental brown  A passing universe put on;  And independent as the sun,  Associates or glows alone,  Fulfilling absolute decree  In casual simplicity.            XXXIV.    STORM.    It sounded as if the streets were running,  And then the streets stood still.  Eclipse was all we could see at the window,  And awe was all we could feel.    By and by the boldest stole out of his covert,  To see if time was there.  Nature was in her beryl apron,  Mixing fresher air.            XXXV.    THE RAT.    The rat is the concisest tenant.  He pays no rent, --  Repudiates the obligation,  On schemes intent.    Balking our wit  To sound or circumvent,  Hate cannot harm  A foe so reticent.    Neither decree  Prohibits him,  Lawful as  Equilibrium.            XXXVI.    Frequently the woods are pink,  Frequently are brown;  Frequently the hills undress  Behind my native town.    Oft a head is crested  I was wont to see,  And as oft a cranny  Where it used to be.    And the earth, they tell me,  On its axis turned, --  Wonderful rotation  By but twelve performed!            XXXVII.    A THUNDER-STORM.    The wind begun to rock the grass  With threatening tunes and low, --  He flung a menace at the earth,  A menace at the sky.    The leaves unhooked themselves from trees  And started all abroad;  The dust did scoop itself like hands  And throw away the road.    The wagons quickened on the streets,  The thunder hurried slow;  The lightning showed a yellow beak,  And then a livid claw.    The birds put up the bars to nests,  The cattle fled to barns;  There came one drop of giant rain,  And then, as if the hands    That held the dams had parted hold,  The waters wrecked the sky,  But overlooked my father's house,  Just quartering a tree.            XXXVIII.    WITH FLOWERS.    South winds jostle them,  Bumblebees come,  Hover, hesitate,  Drink, and are gone.    Butterflies pause  On their passage Cashmere;  I, softly plucking,  Present them here!            XXXIX.    SUNSET.    Where ships of purple gently toss  On seas of daffodil,  Fantastic sailors mingle,  And then -- the wharf is still.            XL.    She sweeps with many-colored brooms,  And leaves the shreds behind;  Oh, housewife in the evening west,  Come back, and dust the pond!    You dropped a purple ravelling in,  You dropped an amber thread;  And now you 've littered all the East  With duds of emerald!    And still she plies her spotted brooms,  And still the aprons fly,  Till brooms fade softly into stars --  And then I come away.            XLI.    Like mighty footlights burned the red  At bases of the trees, --  The far theatricals of day  Exhibiting to these.    'T was universe that did applaud  While, chiefest of the crowd,  Enabled by his royal dress,  Myself distinguished God.            XLII.    PROBLEMS.    Bring me the sunset in a cup,  Reckon the morning's flagons up,     And say how many dew;  Tell me how far the morning leaps,  Tell me what time the weaver sleeps     Who spun the breadths of blue!    Write me how many notes there be  In the new robin's ecstasy     Among astonished boughs;  How many trips the tortoise makes,  How many cups the bee partakes, --     The debauchee of dews!    Also, who laid the rainbow's piers,  Also, who leads the docile spheres     By withes of supple blue?  Whose fingers string the stalactite,  Who counts the wampum of the night,     To see that none is due?    Who built this little Alban house  And shut the windows down so close     My spirit cannot see?  Who 'll let me out some gala day,  With implements to fly away,     Passing pomposity?            XLIII.    THE JUGGLER OF DAY.    Blazing in gold and quenching in purple,  Leaping like leopards to the sky,  Then at the feet of the old horizon  Laying her spotted face, to die;    Stooping as low as the otter's window,  Touching the roof and tinting the barn,  Kissing her bonnet to the meadow, --  And the juggler of day is gone!          XLIV.    MY CRICKET.    Farther in summer than the birds,  Pathetic from the grass,  A minor nation celebrates  Its unobtrusive mass.    No ordinance is seen,  So gradual the grace,  A pensive custom it becomes,  Enlarging loneliness.    Antiquest felt at noon  When August, burning low,  Calls forth this spectral canticle,  Repose to typify.    Remit as yet no grace,  No furrow on the glow,  Yet a druidic difference  Enhances nature now.          XLV.    As imperceptibly as grief  The summer lapsed away, --  Too imperceptible, at last,  To seem like perfidy.    A quietness distilled,  As twilight long begun,  Or Nature, spending with herself  Sequestered afternoon.    The dusk drew earlier in,  The morning foreign shone, --  A courteous, yet harrowing grace,  As guest who would be gone.    And thus, without a wing,  Or service of a keel,  Our summer made her light escape  Into the beautiful.            XLVI.    It can't be summer, -- that got through;  It 's early yet for spring;  There 's that long town of white to cross  Before the blackbirds sing.    It can't be dying, -- it's too rouge, --  The dead shall go in white.  So sunset shuts my question down  With clasps of chrysolite.            XLVII.    SUMMER'S OBSEQUIES.    The gentian weaves her fringes,  The maple's loom is red.  My departing blossoms  Obviate parade.    A brief, but patient illness,  An hour to prepare;  And one, below this morning,  Is where the angels are.    It was a short procession, --  The bobolink was there,  An aged bee addressed us,  And then we knelt in prayer.    We trust that she was willing, --  We ask that we may be.  Summer, sister, seraph,  Let us go with thee!    In the name of the bee  And of the butterfly  And of the breeze, amen!            XLVIII.    FRINGED GENTIAN.    God made a little gentian;  It tried to be a rose  And failed, and all the summer laughed.  But just before the snows  There came a purple creature  That ravished all the hill;  And summer hid her forehead,  And mockery was still.  The frosts were her condition;  The Tyrian would not come  Until the North evoked it.  \"Creator! shall I bloom?\"            XLIX.    NOVEMBER.    Besides the autumn poets sing,  A few prosaic days  A little this side of the snow  And that side of the haze.    A few incisive mornings,  A few ascetic eyes, --  Gone Mr. Bryant's golden-rod,  And "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12259"],[0,"Memoirs of a Cavalier (#11)"],[1,"bruises of musket bullets,  and the rust of the winter storms. I observed of them their clothes  were always dirty, but their arms were clean and bright; they were  used to camp in the open fields, and sleep in the frosts and rain;  their horses were strong and hardy like themselves, and well taught  their exercises; the soldiers knew their business so exactly that  general orders were enough; every private man was fit to command, and  their wheelings, marchings, counter-marchings and exercise were done  with such order and readiness, that the distinct words of command  were hardly of any use among them; they were flushed with victory, and  hardly knew what it was to fly.    There had passed some messages between Tilly and the duke, and he gave  always such ambiguous answers as he thought might serve to gain time;  but Tilly was not to be put off with words, and drawing his army  towards Saxony, sends four propositions to him to sign, and demands an  immediate reply. The propositions were positive.    1. To cause his troops to enter into the emperor's service, and to  march in person with them against the King of Sweden.    2. To give the Imperial army quarters in his country, and supply them  with necessary provisions.    3. To relinquish the union of Leipsic, and disown the ten Conclusions.    4. To make restitution of the goods and lands of the Church.    The duke being pressed by Tilly's trumpeter for an immediate answer  sat all night, and part of the next day, in council with his privy  councillors, debating what reply to give him, which at last was  concluded, in short, that he would live and die in defence of the  Protestant religion, and the Conclusions of Leipsic, and bade Tilly  defiance.    The die being thus cast, he immediately decamped with his whole army  for Torgau, fearing that Tilly should get there before him, and so  prevent his conjunction with the Swede. The duke had not yet concluded  any positive treaty with the King of Swedeland, and the Duke of  Brandenburg having made some difficulty of joining, they both stood  on some niceties till they had like to have ruined themselves all at  once.    Brandenburg had given up the town of Spandau to the king by a former  treaty to secure a retreat for his army, and the king was advanced  as far as Frankfort-upon-the-Oder, when on a sudden some small  difficulties arising, Brandenburg seems cold in the matter, and with  a sort of indifference demands to have his town of Spandau restored to  him again. Gustavus Adolphus, who began presently to imagine the duke  had made his peace with the emperor, and so would either be his enemy  or pretend a neutrality, generously delivered him his town of Spandau,  but immediately turns about, and with his whole army besieges him in  his capital city of Berlin. This brought the duke to know his error,  and by the interpositions of the ladies, the Queen of Sweden being the  duke's sister, the matter was accommodated, and the duke joined his  forces with the king.    But the duke of Saxony had like to have been undone by this delay,  for the Imperialists, under Count de Furstenberg, were entered his  country, and had possessed themselves of Halle, and Tilly was on  his march to join him, as he afterwards did, and ravaging the  whole country laid siege to Leipsic itself. The duke driven to this  extremity rather flies to the Swede than treats with him, and on the  2nd of September the duke's army joined with the King of Sweden.    I had not come to Leipsic but to see the Duke of Saxony's army, and  that being marched, as I have said, for Torgau, I had no business  there, but if I had, the approach of Tilly and the Imperial army was  enough to hasten me away, for I had no occasion to be besieged there;  so on the 27th of August I left the town, as several of the principal  inhabitants had done before, and more would have done had not the  governor published a proclamation against it, and besides they knew  not whither to fly, for all places were alike exposed. The poor people  were under dreadful apprehensions of a siege, and of the merciless  usage of the Imperial soldiers, the example of Magdeburg being fresh  before them, the duke and his army gone from them, and the town,  though well furnished, but indifferently fortified.    In this condition I left them, buying up stores of provisions,  working hard to scour their moats, set up palisadoes, repair their  fortifications, and preparing all things for a siege; and following  the Saxon army to Torgau, I continued in the camp till a few days  before they joined the King of Sweden.    I had much ado to persuade my companion from entering into the  service of the Duke of Saxony, one of whose colonels, with whom we had  contracted a particular acquaintance, offering him a commission to be  cornet in one of the old regiments of horse; but the difference I had  observed between this new army and Tilly's old troops had made such  an impression on me, that I confess I had yet no manner of inclination  for the service, and therefore persuaded him to wait a while till we  had seen a little further into affairs, and particularly till we had  seen the Swedish army which we had heard so much of.    The difficulties which the Elector-Duke of Saxony made of joining with  the king were made up by a treaty concluded with the king on the 2nd  of September at Coswig, a small town on the Elbe, whither the king's  army was arrived the night before; for General Tilly being now entered  into the duke's country, had plundered and ruined all the lower part  of it, and was now actually besieging the capital city of Leipsic.  These necessities made almost any conditions easy to him; the greatest  difficulty was that the King of Sweden demanded the absolute command  of the army, which the duke submitted to with less goodwill than he  had reason to do, the king's experience and conduct considered.    I had not patience to attend the conclusions of their particular  treaties, but as soon as ever the passage was clear I quitted the  Saxon camp and went to see the Swedish army. I fell in with the  out-guards of the Swedes at a little town called Beltsig, on the river  Wersa, just as they were relieving the guards and going to march, and  having a pass from the English ambassador was very well received by  the officer who changed the guards, and with him I went back into  the army. By nine in the morning the army was in full march, the king  himself at the head of them on a grey pad, and riding from one brigade  to another, ordered the march of every line himself.    When I saw the Swedish troops, their exact discipline, their order,  the modesty and familiarity of their officers, and the regular living  of the soldiers, their camp seemed a well-ordered city; the meanest  country woman with her market ware was as safe from violence as in the  streets of Vienna. There were no women in the camp but such as being  known to the provosts to be the wives of the soldiers, who were  necessary for washing linen, taking care of the soldiers' clothes, and  dressing their victuals.    The soldiers were well clad, not gay, furnished with excellent arms,  and exceedingly careful of them; and though they did not seem so  terrible as I thought Tilly's men did when I first saw them, yet the  figure they made, together with what we had heard of them, made them  seem to me invincible: the discipline and order of their marchings,  camping, and exercise was excellent and singular, and, which was to  be seen in no armies but the king's, his own skill, judgment, and  vigilance having added much to the general conduct of armies then in  use.    As I met the Swedes on their march I had no opportunity to acquaint  myself with anybody till after the conjunction of the Saxon army,  and then it being but four days to the great battle of Leipsic, our  acquaintance was but small, saving what fell out accidentally by  conversation.    I met with several gentlemen in the king's army who spoke English very  well; besides that there were three regiments of Scots in the army,  the colonels whereof I found were extraordinarily esteemed by the  king, as the Lord Reay, Colonel Lumsdell, and Sir John Hepburn. The  latter of these, after I had by an accident become acquainted with, I  found had been for many years acquainted with my father, and on that  account I received a great deal of civility from him, which afterwards  grew into a kind of intimate friendship. He was a complete soldier  indeed, and for that reason so well beloved by that gallant king, that  he hardly knew how to go about any great action without him.    It was impossible for me now to restrain my young comrade from  entering into the Swedish service, and indeed everything was so  inviting that I could not blame him. A captain in Sir John Hepburn's  regiment had picked acquaintance with him, and he having as much  gallantry in his face as real courage in his heart, the captain had  persuaded him to take service, and promised to use his interest to get  him a company in the Scotch brigade. I had made him promise me not  to part from me in my travels without my consent, which was the only  obstacle to his desires of entering into the Swedish pay; and being  one evening in the captain's tent with him and discoursing very freely  together, the captain asked him very short but friendly, and looking  earnestly at me, \"Is this the gentleman, Mr Fielding, that has done  so much prejudice to the King of Sweden's service?\" I was doubly  surprised at the expression, and at the colonel, Sir John Hepburn,  coming at that very moment into the tent. The colonel hearing  something of the question, but knowing nothing of the reason of it,  any more than as I seemed a little to concern myself at it, yet after  the ceremony due to his character was over, would needs know what I  had done to hinder his Majesty's service. \"So much truly,\" says the  captain, \"that if his Majesty"]]]
