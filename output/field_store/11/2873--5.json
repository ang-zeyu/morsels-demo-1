[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11438"],[0,"The Willows (#11)"],[1,"me again, and this time spread to my  friend too--great healing gusts of shaking laughter that brought a  tremendous sense of relief in their train. We made our way back to the fire  and put the wood on so that it blazed at once. Then we saw that the tent  had fallen over and lay in a tangled heap upon the ground.    We picked it up, and during the process tripped more than once and caught  our feet in sand.    \"It's those sand-funnels,\" exclaimed the Swede, when the tent was up again  and the firelight lit up the ground for several yards about us. \"And look  at the size of them!\"    All round the tent and about the fireplace where we had seen the moving  shadows there were deep funnel-shaped hollows in the sand, exactly similar  to the ones we had already found over the island, only far bigger and  deeper, beautifully formed, and wide enough in some instances to admit the  whole of my foot and leg.    Neither of us said a word. We both knew that sleep was the safest thing we  could do, and to bed we went accordingly without further delay, having  first thrown sand on the fire and taken the provision sack and the paddle  inside the tent with us. The canoe, too, we propped in such a way at the  end of the tent that our feet touched it, and the least motion would  disturb and wake us.    In case of emergency, too, we again went to bed in our clothes, ready for a  sudden start.    It was my firm intention to lie awake all night and watch, but the  exhaustion of nerves and body decreed otherwise, and sleep after a while  came over me with a welcome blanket of oblivion. The fact that my companion  also slept quickened its approach. At first he fidgeted and constantly sat  up, asking me if I \"heard this\" or \"heard that.\" He tossed about on his  cork mattress, and said the tent was moving and the river had risen over  the point of the island, but each time I went out to look I returned with  the report that all was well, and finally he grew calmer and lay still.  Then at length his breathing became regular and I heard unmistakable sounds  of snoring--the first and only time in my life when snoring has been a  welcome and calming influence.    This, I remember, was the last thought in my mind before dozing off.    A difficulty in breathing woke me, and I found the blanket over my face.  But something else besides the blanket was pressing upon me, and my first  thought was that my companion had rolled off his mattress on to my own in  his sleep. I called to him and sat up, and at the same moment it came to me  that the tent was surrounded. That sound of multitudinous soft pattering  was again audible outside, filling the night with horror.    I called again to him, louder than before. He did not answer, but I missed  the sound of his snoring, and also noticed that the flap of the tent was  down. This was the unpardonable sin. I crawled out in the darkness to hook  it back securely, and it was then for the first time I realized positively  that the Swede was not here. He had gone.    I dashed out in a mad run, seized by a dreadful agitation, and the moment I  was out I plunged into a sort of torrent of humming that surrounded me  completely and came out of every quarter of the heavens at once. It was  that same familiar humming--gone mad! A swarm of great invisible bees might  have been about me in the air. The sound seemed to thicken the very  atmosphere, and I felt that my lungs worked with difficulty.    But my friend was in danger, and I could not hesitate.    The dawn was just about to break, and a faint whitish light spread upwards  over the clouds from a thin strip of clear horizon. No wind stirred. I  could just make out the bushes and river beyond, and the pale sandy  patches. In my excitement I ran frantically to and fro about the island,  calling him by name, shouting at the top of my voice the first words that  came into my head. But the willows smothered my voice, and the humming  muffled it, so that the sound only traveled a few feet round me. I plunged  among the bushes, tripping headlong, tumbling over roots, and scraping my  face as I tore this way and that among the preventing branches.    Then, quite unexpectedly, I came out upon the island's point and saw a dark  figure outlined between the water and the sky. It was the Swede. And  already he had one foot in the river! A moment more and he would have taken  the plunge.    I threw myself upon him, flinging my arms about his waist and dragging him  shorewards with all my strength. Of course he struggled furiously, making a  noise all the time just like that cursed humming, and using the most  outlandish phrases in his anger about \"going inside to Them,\" and \"taking  the way of the water and the wind,\" and God only knows what more besides,  that I tried in vain to recall afterwards, but which turned me sick with  horror and amazement as I listened. But in the end I managed to get him  into the comparative safety of the tent, and flung him breathless and  cursing upon the mattress where I held him until the fit had passed.    I think the suddenness with which it all went and he grew calm, coinciding  as it did with the equally abrupt cessation of the humming and pattering  outside--I think this was almost the strangest part of the whole business  perhaps. For he had just opened his eyes and turned his tired face up to me  so that the dawn threw a pale light upon it through the doorway, and said,  for all the world just like a frightened child:    \"My life, old man--it's my life I owe you. But it's all over now anyhow.  They've found a victim in our place!\"    Then he dropped back upon his blankets and went to sleep literally under my  eyes. He simply collapsed, and began to snore again as healthily as though  nothing had happened and he had never tried to offer his own life as a  sacrifice by drowning. And when the sunlight woke him three hours  later--hours of ceaseless vigil for me--it became so clear to me that he  remembered absolutely nothing of what he had attempted to do, that I deemed  it wise to hold my peace and ask no dangerous questions.    He woke naturally and easily, as I have said, when the sun was already high  in a windless hot sky, and he at once got up and set about the preparation  of the fire for breakfast. I followed him anxiously at bathing, but he did  not attempt to plunge in, merely dipping his head and making some remark  about the extra coldness of the water.    \"River's falling at last,\" he said, \"and I'm glad of it.\"    \"The humming has stopped too,\" I said.    He looked up at me quietly with his normal expression. Evidently he  remembered everything except his own attempt at suicide.    \"Everything has stopped,\" he said, \"because--\"    He hesitated. But I knew some reference to that remark he had made just  before he fainted was in his mind, and I was determined to know it.    \"Because 'They've found another victim'?\" I said, forcing a little laugh.    \"Exactly,\" he answered, \"exactly! I feel as positive of it as though--as  though--I feel quite safe again, I mean,\" he finished.    He began to look curiously about him. The sunlight lay in hot patches on  the sand. There was no wind. The willows were motionless. He slowly rose to  feet.    \"Come,\" he said; \"I think if we look, we shall find it.\"    He started off on a run, and I followed him. He kept to the banks, poking  with a stick among the sandy bays and caves and little back-waters, myself  always close on his heels.    \"Ah!\" he exclaimed presently, \"ah!\"    The tone of his voice somehow brought back to me a vivid sense of the  horror of the last twenty-four hours, and I hurried up to join him. He was  pointing with his stick at a large black object that lay half in the water  and half on the sand. It appeared to be caught by some twisted willow roots  so that the river could not sweep it away. A few hours before the spot must  have been under water.    \"See,\" he said quietly, \"the victim that made our escape possible!\"    And when I peered across his shoulder I saw that his stick rested on the  body of a man. He turned it over. It was the corpse of a peasant, and the  face was hidden in the sand. Clearly the man had been drowned, but a few  hours before, and his body must have been swept down upon our island  somewhere about the hour of the dawn--at the very time the fit had passed.    \"We must give it a decent burial, you know.\"    \"I suppose so,\" I replied. I shuddered a little in spite of myself, for  there was something about the appearance of that poor drowned man that  turned me cold.    The Swede glanced up sharply at me, an undecipherable expression on his  face, and began clambering down the bank. I followed him more leisurely.  The current, I noticed, had torn away much of the clothing from the body,  so that the neck and part of the chest lay bare.    Halfway down the bank my companion suddenly stopped and held up his hand in  warning; but either my foot slipped, or I had gained too much momentum to  bring myself quickly to a halt, for I bumped into him and sent him forward  with a sort of leap to save himself. We tumbled together on to the hard  sand so that our feet splashed into the water. And, before anything could  be done, we had collided a little heavily against the corpse.    The Swede uttered a sharp cry. And I sprang back as if I had been shot.    At the moment we touched the body there rose from its surface the loud  sound of humming--the sound of several hummings--which passed with a vast  commotion as of winged things in the air about us and disappeared upwards  into the sky, growing fainter and fainter till they finally ceased in the  distance. It was exactly as though we had disturbed some living yet  invisible creatures at work.    My companion clutched me, and I think I clutched him, but before either of  us had time properly to recover from the unexpected shock, we saw that a  movement of the current was turning the corpse round"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11440"],[0,"Tales of Three Hemispheres (#11)"],[1,"little  cottages in whose upper chambers poets look out upon the fields we  know not, for I wish to go into the Land of Dream and to sail once  more upon mighty, sea-like Yann.\"    At that he moved heavily and slowly in way-worn carpet slippers,  panting as he went, to the back part of his shop, and I went with him.  This was a dingy lumber-room full of idols: the near end was dingy and  dark but at the far end was a blue caerulean glow in which stars seemed  to be shining and the heads of the idols glowed. \"This,\" said the fat  old man in carpet slippers, \"is the heaven of the gods who sleep.\"  I  asked him what gods slept and he mentioned names that I had never  heard as well as names that I knew.  \"All those,\" he said, \"that are  not worshipped now are asleep.\"    \"Then does Time not kill the gods?\" I said to him and he answered,  \"No. But for three or four thousand years a god is worshipped and for  three or four he sleeps.  Only Time is wakeful always.\"    \"But they that teach us of new gods\"--I said to him, \"are they not  new?\"    \"They hear the old ones stirring in their sleep being about to wake,  because the dawn is breaking and the priests crow.  These are the  happy prophets: unhappy are they that hear some old god speak while he  sleeps still being deep in slumber, and prophesy and prophesy and no  dawn comes, they are those that men stone saying, 'Prophesy where this  stone shall hit you, and this.'\"    \"Then shall Time never slay the gods,\" I said.  And he answered, \"They  shall die by the bedside of the last man.  Then Time shall go mad in  his solitude and shall not know his hours from his centuries of years  and they shall clamour round him crying for recognition and he shall  lay his stricken hands on their heads and stare at them blindly and  say, 'My children, I do not know you one from another,' and at these  words of Time empty worlds shall reel.\"    And for some while then I was silent, for my imagination went out into  those far years and looked back at me and mocked me because I was the  creature of a day.    Suddenly I was aware by the old man's heavy breathing that he had gone  to sleep.  It was not an ordinary shop: I feared lest one of his gods  should wake and call for him: I feared many things, it was so dark,  and one or two of those idols were something more than grotesque.  I  shook the old man hard by one of his arms.    \"Tell me the way to the cottages,\" I said, \"on the edge of the fields  we know.\"    \"I don't think we can do that,\" he said.    \"Then supply me,\" I said, \"with the goods.\"    That brought him to his senses.  He said, \"You go out by the back door  and turn to the right\"; and he opened a little, old, dark door in the  wall through which I went, and he wheezed and shut the door. The back  of the shop was of incredible age.  I saw in antique characters upon a  mouldering board, \"Licensed to sell weasels and jade earrings.\"  The  sun was setting now and shone on little golden spires that gleamed  along the roof which had long ago been thatched and with a wonderful  straw.  I saw that the whole of Go-by Street had the same strange  appearance when looked at from behind.  The pavement was the same as  the pavement of which I was weary and of which so many thousand miles  lay the other side of those houses, but the street was of most pure  untrampled grass with such marvellous flowers in it that they lured  downward from great heights the flocks of butterflies as they traveled  by, going I know not whence.  The other side of the street there was  pavement again but no houses of any kind, and what there was in place  of them I did not stop to see, for I turned to my right and walked  along the back of Go-by Street till I came to the open fields and the  gardens of the cottages that I sought.  Huge flowers went up out of  these gardens like slow rockets and burst into purple blooms and stood  there huge and radiant on six-foot stalks and softly sang strange  songs.  Others came up beside them and bloomed and began singing too.  A very old witch came out of her cottage by the back door and into the  garden in which I stood.    \"What are these wonderful flowers?\" I said to her.    \"Hush!  Hush!\" she said, \"I am putting the poets to bed.  These  flowers are their dreams.\"    And in a lower voice I said: \"What wonderful songs are they singing?\"  and she said, \"Be still and listen.\"    And I listened and found they were singing of my own childhood and of  things that happened there so far away that I had quite forgotten them  till I heard the wonderful song.    \"Why is the song so faint?\" I said to her.    \"Dead voices,\" she said, \"Dead voices,\" and turned back again to her  cottage saying: \"Dead voices\" still, but softly for fear that she  should wake the poets.  \"They sleep so badly while they live,\" she  said.    I stole on tiptoe upstairs to the little room from whose windows,  looking one way, we see the fields we know and, looking another, those  hilly lands that I sought--almost I feared not to find them.  I looked  at once toward the mountains of faery; the afterglow of the sunset  flamed on them, their avalanches flashed on their violet slopes coming  down tremendous from emerald peaks of ice; and there was the old gap  in the blue-grey hills above the precipice of amethyst whence one sees  the Lands of Dream.    All was still in the room where the poets slept when I came quietly  down.  The old witch sat by a table with a lamp, knitting a splendid  cloak of gold and green for a king that had been dead a thousand  years.    \"Is it any use,\" I said, \"to the king that is dead that you sit and  knit him a cloak of gold and green?\"    \"Who knows?\" she said.    \"What a silly question to ask,\" said her old black cat who lay curled  by the fluttering fire.    Already the stars were shining on that romantic land when I closed the  witch's door; already the glow-worms were mounting guard for the night  around those magical cottages.  I turned and trudged for the gap in  the blue-grey mountains.    Already when I arrived some colour began to show in the amethyst  precipice below the gap although it was not yet morning.  I heard a  rattling and sometimes caught a flash from those golden dragons far  away below me that are the triumph of the goldsmiths of Sirdoo and  were given life by the ritual incantations of the conjurer Amargrarn.  On the edge of the opposite cliff, too near I thought for safety, I  saw the ivory palace of Singanee that mighty elephant-hunter; small  lights appeared in windows, the slaves were awake, and beginning with  heavy eyelids the work of the day.    And now a ray of sunlight topped the world.  Others than I must  describe how it swept from the amethyst cliff the shadow of the black  one that opposed it, how that one shaft of sunlight pierced the  amethyst for leagues, and how the rejoicing colour leaped up to  welcome the light and shot back a purple glow on the walls of the  palace of ivory while down in that incredible ravine the golden  dragons still played in the darkness.    At this moment a female slave came out by a door of the palace and  tossed a basket-full of sapphires over the edge.  And when day was  manifest on those marvellous heights and the flare of the amethyst  precipice filled the abyss, then the elephant-hunter arose in his  ivory palace and took his terrific spear and going out by a landward  door went forth to avenge Perdondaris    I turned then and looked upon the lands of Dream, and the thin white  mist that never rolls quite away was shifting in the morning. Rising  like isles above it I saw the Hills of Hap and the city of copper,  old, deserted Bethmoora, and Utnar Vehi and Kyph and Mandaroon and the  wandering leagues of Yann.  Rather I guessed than saw the Hian Min  whose imperturbable and aged heads scarce recognize for more than  clustered mounds the round Acroctian hills, that are heaped about  their feet and that shelter, as I remembered, Durl and Duz.  But most  clearly I discerned that ancient wood through which one going down to  the bank of Yann whenever the moon is old may come on _Bird of the  River_ anchored there, waiting three days for travellers, as has been  prophesied of her.  And as it was now that season I hurried down from  the gap in the blue-grey hills by an elfin path that was coeval with  fable, and came by means of it to the edge of the wood.  Black though  the darkness was in that ancient wood the beasts that moved in it were  blacker still.  It is very seldom that any dreamer travelling in Lands  of Dream is ever seized by these beasts, and yet I ran; for if a man's  spirit is seized in the Lands of Dream his body may survive it for  many years and well know the beasts that mouthed him far away and the  look in their little eyes and the smell of their breath; that is why  the recreation field at Hanwell is so dreadfully trodden into restless  paths.    And so I came at last to the sea-like flood of proud, tremendous Yann,  with whom there tumbled streams from incredible lands--with these he  went by singing.  Singing he carried drift-wood and whole trees,  fallen in far-away, unvisited forests, and swept them mightily by, but  no sign was there either out in the river or in the olden anchorage  near by of the ship I came to see.    And I built myself a hut and roofed it over with the huge abundant  leaves of a marvellous weed and ate the meat that grows on the  targar-tree and waited there three days.  And all day long the river  tumbled by and all night long the tolulu-bird sang on and the huge  fireflies had no other care than to pour past in torrents of dancing  sparks, and nothing rippled the surface of the Yann by day and nothing  disturbed the tolulu-bird by night.  I know not what I feared for the  ship I sought and its friendly captain who came from fair Belzoond and  its cheery sailors out of Durl and Duz; all day long I looked for it  on the river and listened for it by night"]]]
