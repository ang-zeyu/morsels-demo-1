And Absalom rode upon a             mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak,             and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up             between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under             him went away.    10:018:010 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I             saw Absalom hanged in an oak.    10:018:011 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou             sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the             ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and             a girdle.    10:018:012 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand             shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine             hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king             charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none             touch the young man Absalom.    10:018:013 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own             life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou             thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.    10:018:014 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took             three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of             Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.    10:018:015 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and             smote Absalom, and slew him.    10:018:016 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from             pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.    10:018:017 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the             wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all             Israel fled every one to his tent.    10:018:018 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for             himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I             have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the             pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day,             Absalom's place.    10:018:019 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear             the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his             enemies.    10:018:020 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,             but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou             shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.    10:018:021 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.             And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.    10:018:022 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But             howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab             said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast             no tidings ready?    10:018:023 But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run.             Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.    10:018:024 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up             to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his             eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.    10:018:025 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said,             If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came             apace, and drew near.    10:018:026 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman             called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running             alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.    10:018:027 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost             is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king             said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.    10:018:028 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And             he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and             said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the             men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.    10:018:029 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz             answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy             servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.    10:018:030 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he             turned aside, and stood still.    10:018:031 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the             king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that             rose up against thee.    10:018:032 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe?             And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all             that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man             is.    10:018:033 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over             the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son             Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for             thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!    10:019:001 And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth             for Absalom.    10:019:002 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the             people: for the people heard say that day how the king was             grieved for his son.    10:019:003 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as             people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.    10:019:004 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud             voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!    10:019:005 And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast             shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day             have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy             daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy             concubines;    10:019:006 In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For             thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither             princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom             had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased             thee well.    10:019:007 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy             servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there             will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be             worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy             youth until now.    10:019:008 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto             all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate.             And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled             every man to his tent.    10:019:009 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of             Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our             enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the             Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.    10:019:010 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now             therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?    10:019:011 And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,             saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the             last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of             all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.    10:019:012 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore             then are ye the last to bring back the king?    10:019:013 And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh?             God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the             host before me continually in the room of Joab.    10:019:014 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the             heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king,             Return thou, and all thy servants.    10:019:015 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to             Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over             Jordan.    10:019:016 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,             hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.    10:019:017 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba             the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his             twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the             king.    10:019:018 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's             household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son             of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;    10:019:019 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto             me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did             perversely the day that my lord the king went out of             Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.    10:019:020 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore,             behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of             Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.    10:019:021 But Abishai the son of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8018"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 18: Job (#10)"],[1,"spoken in             my mouth.    18:033:003 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips             shall utter knowledge clearly.    18:033:004 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty             hath given me life.    18:033:005 If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me,             stand up.    18:033:006 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am             formed out of the clay.    18:033:007 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my             hand be heavy upon thee.    18:033:008 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the             voice of thy words, saying,    18:033:009 I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is             there iniquity in me.    18:033:010 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for             his enemy,    18:033:011 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.    18:033:012 Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that             God is greater than man.    18:033:013 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of             any of his matters.    18:033:014 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.    18:033:015 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth             upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;    18:033:016 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their             instruction,    18:033:017 That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from             man.    18:033:018 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from             perishing by the sword.    18:033:019 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude             of his bones with strong pain:    18:033:020 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.    18:033:021 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his             bones that were not seen stick out.    18:033:022 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the             destroyers.    18:033:023 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a             thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:    18:033:024 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from             going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.    18:033:025 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to             the days of his youth:    18:033:026 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him:             and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto             man his righteousness.    18:033:027 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and             perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;    18:033:028 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life             shall see the light.    18:033:029 Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,    18:033:030 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with             the light of the living.    18:033:031 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will             speak.    18:033:032 If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire             to justify thee.    18:033:033 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach             thee wisdom.    18:034:001 Furthermore Elihu answered and said,    18:034:002 Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that             have knowledge.    18:034:003 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.    18:034:004 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what             is good.    18:034:005 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my             judgment.    18:034:006 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without             transgression.    18:034:007 What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?    18:034:008 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and             walketh with wicked men.    18:034:009 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should             delight himself with God.    18:034:010 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it             from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty,             that he should commit iniquity.    18:034:011 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause             every man to find according to his ways.    18:034:012 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the             Almighty pervert judgment.    18:034:013 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath             disposed the whole world?    18:034:014 If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his             spirit and his breath;    18:034:015 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto             dust.    18:034:016 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the             voice of my words.    18:034:017 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn             him that is most just?    18:034:018 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes,             Ye are ungodly?    18:034:019 How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of             princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they             all are the work of his hands.    18:034:020 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled             at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away             without hand.    18:034:021 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his             goings.    18:034:022 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers             of iniquity may hide themselves.    18:034:023 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should             enter into judgment with God.    18:034:024 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set             others in their stead.    18:034:025 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in             the night, so that they are destroyed.    18:034:026 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;    18:034:027 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any             of his ways:    18:034:028 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and             he heareth the cry of the afflicted.    18:034:029 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when             he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be             done against a nation, or against a man only:    18:034:030 That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.    18:034:031 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne             chastisement, I will not offend any more:    18:034:032 That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I             will do no more.    18:034:033 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it,             whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I:             therefore speak what thou knowest.    18:034:034 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken             unto me.    18:034:035 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without             wisdom.    18:034:036 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his             answers for wicked men.    18:034:037 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands             among us, and multiplieth his words against God.    18:035:001 Elihu spake moreover, and said,    18:035:002 Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My             righteousness is more than God's?    18:035:003 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and,             What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?    18:035:004 I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.    18:035:005 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which             are higher than thou.    18:035:006 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy             transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?    18:035:007 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth             he of thine hand?    18:035:008 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy             righteousness may profit the son of man.    18:035:009 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the             oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the             mighty.    18:035:010 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the             night;    18:035:011 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh             us wiser than the fowls of heaven?    18:035:012 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride             of evil men.    18:035:013 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty             regard it.    18:035:014 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is             before him; therefore trust thou in him.    18:035:015 But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger;             yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:    18:035:016 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth             words without knowledge.    18:036:001 Elihu also proceeded, and said,    18:036:002 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to             speak on God's behalf.    18:036:003 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe             righteousness to my Maker.    18:036:004 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in             knowledge is with thee.    18:036:005 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in             strength and wisdom.    18:036:006 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to             the poor.    18:036:007 He withdraweth"]]]
