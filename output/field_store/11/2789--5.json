This colossus of French literature, having been for a long time in  correspondence with the great Frederic, became particularly anxious  to see that monarch. On his arrival in a village where the  head-quarters of the Prussian army were then established, Voltaire  inquired for the king's lodging: thither he paced with redoubled  speed; and, being directed to the upper part of the house, he hastily  crossed a large garret; he then found himself in a second, and was  just on the point of entering the third, when, on turning round, he  perceived in one of the comers of the room, a soldier, not overclean  in appearance, lying on a sorry bedstead. He went up and said to him  with eagerness: \"Where's the king?\"--\"I am Frederic,\" replied the  soldier; and, sure enough, it was the monarch himself.    I am now settled in my new apartments, which are situated in the most  centrical part of Paris. When you visit this capital, I would by all  means, recommend to you, should you intend to remain here a few  weeks, to get into private lodgings.    I know of no article here so much augmented in price, within the last  ten years, as the apartments in all the hotels. After looking at  several of them in the _Rue de la Loi_, accompanied by a French  friend, who was so obliging as to take on himself all the trouble of  inquiry, while I remained a silent bystander, I had the curiosity to  go to the _Hôtel d'Angleterre_, in the _Rue des Filles St. Thomas_,  hot far from the _ci-devant Palais Royal_. The same apartments on the  first floor of this hotel which I occupied in 1789, happened to be  vacant. At that time I paid for them twelve louis d'or a month; the  furniture was then new; it is now much the worse for nearly eleven  years' wear; and the present landlord asked twenty-five louis a  month, and even refused twenty-two, if taken for three months  certain. The fact is, that all the landlords of ready-furnished  hotels in Paris seem to be buoyed up with an idea that, on the peace,  the English and foreigners of other nations will flock hither in such  numbers as to enable them to reap a certain and plentiful harvest.  Not but all lodgings are considerably increased in price, which is  ascribed to the increase of taxes.    To find private lodgings, you have only to cast your eye on the daily  advertiser of Paris, called _Les Petites Affiches_. There I read a  description of my present quarters, which are newly fitted up in  every particular, and, I assure you, with no small degree of tasteful  fancy. My landlady, who is a milliner, and, for aught I know, a very  fashionable one, left not the smallest convenience to my conjecture,  but explained the particular use of every hole and corner in the most  significant manner, not even excepting the _boudoir_.    This would be a most excellent situation for any one whose principal  object was to practise speaking French; for, on the right hand of the  _porte-cochère_ or gateway, (which, by the bye, is here reckoned an  indispensable appendage to a proper lodging), is the _magazin des  modes_, where my landlady presides over twenty damsels, many of whom,  though assiduously occupied in making caps and bonnets, would, I am  persuaded, find repartee for the most witty gallant.        LETTER IV.    _Paris, October 23, 1801._    Since my arrival, I have been so much engaged in paying and receiving  visits, that I really have not yet been able to take even a hasty  view of any of the grand sights introduced here since the revolution,    On Wednesday I dined with M. S----i, whose new 8vo edition of Buffon  proceeds, I find, with becoming spirit. It is quite a journey to his  residence; for he lives in one of the most retired quarters of Paris,  However, I had no reason to repine at the distance, as the party was  exceedingly cheerful. Naturalists and literati were not wanting.    Egypt was a subject that engrossed much of the conversation: it was  mentioned as a matter of regret that, during the dominion of the  French in that country, curiosity had not prompted the Institute,  established at Cairo, to open one of the pyramids, with a view of  ascertaining the object of the erection of those vast masses. At the  desert, we had luscious grapes as large as damsons, in bunches of  from three to five pounds in weight. They were of the species of the  famous _chasselas de Fontainebleau_, which are said to have sprung  from a stock of vine-plants, imported by Francis I. from the island  of Cyprus. These did not come from that town, but grew against the  naked wall in S----i's garden. From this you may form a judgment of  the climate of Paris.    The persons with whom I have had any correspondence, respecting  literature, vie with each other in shewing me every mark of cordial  hospitality; and those to whom I have been introduced, are by no  means backward in friendly attention. All the lovers of science here  seem to rejoice that the communication, which has been so long  interrupted between the two countries, promises to be shortly  re-opened.    After dining yesterday with Mr. M----y, the British minister, in  company with Mr. D----n, the member for Ilchester, we all three went  to an exhibition almost facing Mr. M----y's residence  in the _Rue  St. Dominique_. This was the third time of its being open to the  public. As it is of a novel kind, some account of it may not be  uninteresting. In French, it is denominated      THERMOLAMPES,    _or stoves which afford heat and light on an economical plan_.    The author of this invention, for which a patent has been obtained,  is M. LEBON, an engineer of bridges and highways. The place of  exhibition was the ground floor of one of the large hotels in the  _Faubourg St. Germain_, on which was a suite of rooms, extremely  favourable for displaying the effect of this new method of lighting  and warming apartments.    In lieu of fire or candle, on the chimney stood a large crystal  globe, in which appeared a bright and clear flame diffusing a very  agreeable heat; and on different pieces of furniture were placed  candlesticks with metal candles, from the top of each of which issued  a steady light, like that of a lamp burning with spirits of wine.  These different receptacles were supplied with inflammable gas by  means of tubes communicating with an apparatus underneath. By this  contrivance, in short, all the apartments were warmed very  comfortably, and illuminated in a brilliant manner.    On consulting M. LEBON, he communicated to me the following  observations: \"You may have remarked,\" said he, \"in sitting before a  fire, that wood sometimes burns without flame, but with much smoke,  and then you experience little heat, sometimes with flame, but with  little smoke, and then you find much warmth. You may have remarked  too, that ill-made charcoal emits smoke; it is, on that account,  susceptible of flaming again; and the characteristic difference  between wood and charcoal is, that the latter has lost, together with  its smoke, the principle and aliment of flame, without which you  obtain but little heat. Experience next informs us, that this portion  of smoke, the aliment of flame, is not an oily vapour condensable by  cooling, but a gas, a permanent air, which may be washed, purified,  conducted, distributed, and afterwards turned into flame at any  distance from the hearth.    \"It is almost needless,\" continued he, \"to point out the formation of  verdigrise, white lead, and a quantity of other operations, in which  acetous acid is employed. I shall only remark that it is this  pyroligneous acid which penetrates smoked meat and fish, that it has  an effect on leather which it hardens, and that _thermolampes_ are  likely to render tanning-mills unnecessary, by furnishing the tan  without further trouble. But to return to the aëriform principle.    \"This aliment of flame is deprived of those humid vapours, so  perceptible and so disagreeable to the organs of sight and smell.  Purified to a perfect transparency, it floats in the state of cold  air, and suffers itself to be directed by the smallest and most  fragil pipes. Chimnies of an inch square, made in the thickness of  the plaster of ceilings or walls, tubes even of gummed silk would  answer this purpose. The end alone of the tube, which, by bringing  the inflammable gas into contact with the atmospheric air, allows it  to catch fire, and on which the flame reposes, ought to be of metal.    \"By a distribution so easy to be established, a single stove may  supply the place of all the chimnies of a house. Every where  inflammable air is ready to diffuse immediately heat and light of the  most glowing or most mild nature, simultaneously or separately,  according to your wishes. In the twinkling of an eye, you may conduct  the flame from one room to another; an advantage equally convenient  and economical, and which can never be obtained with our common  stoves and chimnies. No sparks, no charcoal, no soot, to trouble you;  no ashes, no wood, to soil your apartments. By night, as well as by  day, you can have a fire in your room, without a servant being  obliged to look after it. Nothing in the _thermolampes_, not even the  smallest portion of inflammable air, can escape combustion; while in  our chimnies, torrents evaporate, and even carry off with them the  greater part of the heat produced.    \"The advantage of being able to purify and proportion, in some  measure, the principles of the gas which feeds the flame is,\" said M.  LEBON, \"set forth in the clearest manner. But this flame is so  subjected to our caprice, that even to tranquilize the imagination,  it suffers itself to be confined in a crystal globe, which is never  tarnished, and thus presents a filter pervious to light and heat. A  part of the tube that conducts the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/90"],[0,"The Son of Tarzan (#10)"],[1,"kicked me and hurt me so, Geeka; but I was only  sitting before the tent making a skirt for you.  That must be wicked,  or he would not have kicked me for it.  But why is it wicked, Geeka?  Oh dear!  I do not know, I do not know.  I wish, Geeka, that I were  dead.  Yesterday the hunters brought in the body of El Adrea.  El Adrea  was quite dead.  No more will he slink silently upon his unsuspecting  prey.  No more will his great head and his maned shoulders strike  terror to the hearts of the grass eaters at the drinking ford by night.  No more will his thundering roar shake the ground.  El Adrea is dead.  They beat his body terribly when it was brought into the village; but  El Adrea did not mind.  He did not feel the blows, for he was dead.  When I am dead, Geeka, neither shall I feel the blows of Mabunu, or the  kicks of The Sheik, my father.  Then shall I be happy.  Oh, Geeka, how  I wish that I were dead!\"    If Geeka contemplated a remonstrance it was cut short by sounds of  altercation beyond the village gates.  Meriem listened.  With the  curiosity of childhood she would have liked to have run down there and  learn what it was that caused the men to talk so loudly.  Others of the  village were already trooping in the direction of the noise.  But  Meriem did not dare.  The Sheik would be there, doubtless, and if he  saw her it would be but another opportunity to abuse her, so Meriem lay  still and listened.    Presently she heard the crowd moving up the street toward The Sheik's  tent.  Cautiously she stuck her little head around the edge of the  tent.  She could not resist the temptation, for the sameness of the  village life was monotonous, and she craved diversion.  What she saw  was two strangers--white men.  They were alone, but as they approached  she learned from the talk of the natives that surrounded them that they  possessed a considerable following that was camped outside the village.  They were coming to palaver with The Sheik.    The old Arab met them at the entrance to his tent.  His eyes narrowed  wickedly when they had appraised the newcomers.  They stopped before  him, exchanging greetings.  They had come to trade for ivory they said.  The Sheik grunted.  He had no ivory.  Meriem gasped.  She knew that in  a near-by hut the great tusks were piled almost to the roof.  She poked  her little head further forward to get a better view of the strangers.  How white their skins!  How yellow their great beards!    Suddenly one of them turned his eyes in her direction.  She tried to  dodge back out of sight, for she feared all men; but he saw her.  Meriem noticed the look of almost shocked surprise that crossed his  face.  The Sheik saw it too, and guessed the cause of it.    \"I have no ivory,\" he repeated.  \"I do not wish to trade.  Go away.  Go  now.\"    He stepped from his tent and almost pushed the strangers about in the  direction of the gates.  They demurred, and then The Sheik threatened.  It would have been suicide to have disobeyed, so the two men turned and  left the village, making their way immediately to their own camp.    The Sheik returned to his tent; but he did not enter it.  Instead he  walked to the side where little Meriem lay close to the goat skin wall,  very frightened.  The Sheik stooped and clutched her by the arm.  Viciously he jerked her to her feet, dragged her to the entrance of the  tent, and shoved her viciously within.  Following her he again seized  her, beating her ruthlessly.    \"Stay within!\" he growled.  \"Never let the strangers see thy face.  Next time you show yourself to strangers I shall kill you!\"    With a final vicious cuff he knocked the child into a far corner of the  tent, where she lay stifling her moans, while The Sheik paced to and  fro muttering to himself.  At the entrance sat Mabunu, muttering and  chuckling.    In the camp of the strangers one was speaking rapidly to the other.    \"There is no doubt of it, Malbihn,\" he was saying.  \"Not the slightest;  but why the old scoundrel hasn't claimed the reward long since is what  puzzles me.\"    \"There are some things dearer to an Arab, Jenssen, than money,\"  returned the first speaker--\"revenge is one of them.\"    \"Anyhow it will not harm to try the power of gold,\" replied Jenssen.    Malbihn shrugged.    \"Not on The Sheik,\" he said.  \"We might try it on one of his people;  but The Sheik will not part with his revenge for gold.  To offer it to  him would only confirm his suspicions that we must have awakened when  we were talking to him before his tent.  If we got away with our lives,  then, we should be fortunate.\"    \"Well, try bribery, then,\" assented Jenssen.    But bribery failed--grewsomely.  The tool they selected after a stay of  several days in their camp outside the village was a tall, old headman  of The Sheik's native contingent.  He fell to the lure of the shining  metal, for he had lived upon the coast and knew the power of gold.  He  promised to bring them what they craved, late that night.    Immediately after dark the two white men commenced to make arrangements  to break camp.  By midnight all was prepared.  The porters lay beside  their loads, ready to swing them aloft at a moment's notice.  The armed  askaris loitered between the balance of the safari and the Arab  village, ready to form a rear guard for the retreat that was to begin  the moment that the head man brought that which the white masters  awaited.    Presently there came the sound of footsteps along the path from the  village.  Instantly the askaris and the whites were on the alert.  More  than a single man was approaching.  Jenssen stepped forward and  challenged the newcomers in a low whisper.    \"Who comes?\" he queried.    \"Mbeeda,\" came the reply.    Mbeeda was the name of the traitorous head man.  Jenssen was satisfied,  though he wondered why Mbeeda had brought others with him.  Presently  he understood.  The thing they fetched lay upon a litter borne by two  men.  Jenssen cursed beneath his breath.  Could the fool be bringing  them a corpse?  They had paid for a living prize!    The bearers came to a halt before the white men.    \"This has your gold purchased,\" said one of the two.  They set the  litter down, turned and vanished into the darkness toward the village.  Malbihn looked at Jenssen, a crooked smile twisting his lips.  The  thing upon the litter was covered with a piece of cloth.    \"Well?\" queried the latter.  \"Raise the covering and see what you have  bought.  Much money shall we realize on a corpse--especially after the  six months beneath the burning sun that will be consumed in carrying it  to its destination!\"    \"The fool should have known that we desired her alive,\" grumbled  Malbihn, grasping a corner of the cloth and jerking the cover from the  thing that lay upon the litter.    At sight of what lay beneath both men stepped back--involuntary oaths  upon their lips--for there before them lay the dead body of Mbeeda, the  faithless head man.    Five minutes later the safari of Jenssen and Malbihn was forcing its  way rapidly toward the west, nervous askaris guarding the rear from the  attack they momentarily expected.          Chapter 6      His first night in the jungle was one which the son of Tarzan held  longest in his memory.  No savage carnivora menaced him.  There was  never a sign of hideous barbarian.  Or, if there were, the boy's  troubled mind took no cognizance of them.  His conscience was harassed  by the thought of his mother's suffering.  Self-blame plunged him into  the depths of misery.  The killing of the American caused him little or  no remorse.  The fellow had earned his fate.  Jack's regret on this  score was due mainly to the effect which the death of Condon had had  upon his own plans.  Now he could not return directly to his parents as  he had planned.  Fear of the primitive, borderland law, of which he had  read highly colored, imaginary tales, had thrust him into the jungle a  fugitive.  He dared not return to the coast at this point--not that he  was so greatly influenced through personal fear as from a desire to  shield his father and mother from further sorrow and from the shame of  having their honored name dragged through the sordid degradation of a  murder trial.    With returning day the boy's spirits rose.  With the rising sun rose  new hope within his breast.  He would return to civilization by another  way.  None would guess that he had been connected with the killing of  the stranger in the little out-of-the-way trading post upon a remote  shore.    Crouched close to the great ape in the crotch of a tree the boy had  shivered through an almost sleepless night.  His light pajamas had been  but little protection from the chill dampness of the jungle, and only  that side of him which was pressed against the warm body of his shaggy  companion approximated to comfort.  And so he welcomed the rising sun  with its promise of warmth as well as light--the blessed sun, dispeller  of physical and mental ills.    He shook Akut into wakefulness.    \"Come,\" he said.  \"I am cold and hungry.  We will search for food, out  there in the sunlight,\" and he pointed to an open plain, dotted with  stunted trees and strewn with jagged rock.    The boy slid to the ground as he spoke, but the ape first looked  carefully about, sniffing the morning air.  Then, satisfied that no  danger lurked near, he descended slowly to the ground beside the boy.    \"Numa, and Sabor his mate, feast upon those who descend first and look  afterward, while those who look first and descend afterward live to  feast themselves.\"  Thus the old ape imparted to the son of Tarzan the  boy's first lesson in jungle lore.  Side by side they set off across  the rough plain, for the boy wished first to be warm.  The ape showed  him the best places to dig for rodents and worms; but the lad only  gagged at the thought of devouring the repulsive things.  Some eggs  they found, and these he sucked raw, as also"]]]
