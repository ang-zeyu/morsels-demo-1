The     revision and codification when completed shall be embodied in a     treaty or treaties.       \"_Clause 3_       \"The International Council shall prepare and submit with the     notification and invitation above provided a preliminary programme of     the International Conference, which shall be subject to modification     or amendment by the Conference.       \"_Clause 4_       \"Until the treaty of revision of the constitution and procedure of     the Arbitral Tribunal becomes operative, the provisions of the I     Treaty signed at The Hague in 1907 shall continue in force, and all     references herein to the 'Arbitral Tribunal' shall be understood to     be the Tribunal constituted under the I Treaty, but upon the treaty     of revision coming into force the references shall be construed as     applying to the Arbitral Tribunal therein constituted.       \"ARTICLE V       \"_Publication of Treaties and Agreements_       \"_Clause 1_       \"Each power, signatory or adherent to this convention, severally     agrees with all other parties hereto that it will not exchange the     ratification of any treaty or convention hereinafter entered into by     it with any other power until thirty days after the full text of such     treaty or convention has been published in the public press of the     parties thereto and a copy has been filed with the Secretariat of the     League of Nations.       \"_Clause 2_       \"No international agreement, to which a power signatory or adherent     to this convention, is a party, shall become operative or be put in     force until published and filed as aforesaid.       \"_Clause 3_       \"All treaties, conventions and agreements, to which a power,     signatory or adherent to this convention, is a party, and which are     in force or to come into force and which have not been heretofore     published, shall within six months after the signature of this     convention be published and filed as aforesaid or abrogated or     denounced.       \"ARTICLE VI       \"_Equality of Commercial Privileges_       \"The powers, signatory and adherent to this convention agree jointly     and severally not to discriminate against or in favor of any power in     the matter of commerce or trade or of industrial privileges; and they     further agree that all treaties, conventions and agreements now in     force or to come into force or hereinafter negotiated shall be     considered as subject to the 'most favored nation' doctrine, whether     they contain or do not contain a clause to that effect. It is     specifically declared that it is the purpose of this article not to     limit any power in imposing upon commerce and trade such restrictions     and burdens as it may deem proper but to make such impositions apply     equally and impartially to all other powers, their nationals     and ships.       \"This article shall not apply, however, to any case, in which a power     has committed an unfriendly act against the members of the League of     Nations as defined in Article I and in which commercial and trade     relations are denied or restricted by agreements between the members     as a measure of restoration or protection of the rights of a power     injured by such unfriendly act.\"    These proposed articles, which were intended for discussion before  drafting the provisions constituting a League of Nations and which did  not purport to be a completed document, are given in full because there  seems no simpler method of showing the differences between the President  and me as to the form, functions, and authority of an international  organization. They should be compared with the draft of the \"Covenant\"  which the President had when these proposed articles were handed to him;  the text of the President's draft appears in the Appendix (page 281).  Comparison will disclose the irreconcilable differences between the  two projects.    Of these differences the most vital was in the character of the  international guaranty of territorial and political sovereignty. That  difference has already been discussed. The second in importance was the  practical repudiation by the President of the doctrine of the equality  of nations, which, as has been shown, was an unavoidable consequence of  an affirmative guaranty which he had declared to be absolutely essential  to an effective world union. The repudiation, though by indirection, was  none the less evident in the recognition in the President's plan of the  primacy of the Great Powers through giving to them a permanent majority  on the \"Executive Council\" which body substantially controlled the  activities of the League. A third marked difference was in Mr. Wilson's  exaltation of the executive power of the League and the subordination of  the administration of legal justice to that power, and in my advocacy of  an independent international judiciary, whose decisions would be final  and whose place in the organization of the nations would be superior,  since I considered a judicial tribunal the most practical agency for  removing causes of war.    The difference as to international courts and the importance of applied  legal justice requires further consideration in order to understand the  divergence of views which existed as to the fundamental idea of  organization of the League.    President Wilson in his Covenant, as at first submitted to the American  Commissioners, made no provision for the establishment of a World Court  of Justice, and no reference of any sort was made to The Hague Tribunal  of Arbitration. It is not, in my opinion, a misstatement to say that the  President intentionally omitted judicial means of composing  international disputes preferring to leave settlements of that sort to  arrangement between the parties or else to the Body of Delegates or the  Executive Council, both of which bodies being essentially diplomatic or  political in their composition would lack the judicial point of view,  since their members would presumably be influenced by their respective  national interests and by political considerations rather than by a  desire and purpose to do impartial justice by applying legal principles.    It is true that in Article V of the first draft of the Covenant  (Appendix) there is an agreement to submit to arbitration  certain classes of controversies and a method of selecting arbitrators  is provided--a method, by the way, which the actual experience of a  century has shown to be the least satisfactory in administering legal  justice, since it almost inevitably leads to a compromise which impairs  the just rights of one of the parties. But, to my mind, a provision, far  more objectionable than the antiquated and unsatisfactory method of  arbitration provided, was that which made an arbitral award reviewable  on appeal to the Body of Delegates of the League, which could set aside  the award even if the arbitrators had rendered a unanimous decision and  compel a rehearing before other arbitrators. International arbitration  as a method of applying the principles of justice to disputes between  nations would, in the first instance at least, have become a farce if  this provision had been adopted. As an award based on compromise is  seldom, if ever, satisfactory to both parties, the right of appeal would  in substantially every case have been invoked and the award would have  been reviewed by the Body of Delegates, who would practically render a  final decision since the new arbitrators would presumably adopt it. The  effect of this provision as to appeals was, therefore, to supplant  judicial settlements by political compromises and diplomatic  adjustments, in which the national interests of the judges, many of whom  would be untrained in juridical procedure, would be decided, if not  deciding, factors. Manifestly the expediency of the moment would be far  more potent in the decisions reached than the principles and precepts of  international law.    I shall not express here my opinion as to the reasons which I believe  impelled the President to insert in the Covenant these extraordinary  provisions which deprived arbitral courts of that independence of the  executive authority which has been in modern times considered essential  to the impartial administration of justice. But, when one considers how  jealously and effectively the Constitution of the United States and the  constitutions of the various States of the Union guard the judiciary  from executive and legislative interference, the proposal in the  President's plan for a League of Nations to abandon that great principle  in the settlement of international disputes of a justiciable nature  causes speculation as to Mr. Wilson's real opinion of the American  political system which emphasizes the separation and independence of the  three coordinate branches of government.    That a provision found its way into the draft of the Covenant, which the  President, on February 3, 1919, laid before the Commission on the League  of Nations, declaring for the creation by the League of a permanent  court of international justice, was not due, I feel sure, to any  spontaneous thought on the part of President Wilson.

The prayer of the  Buddhist was a yearning for deliverance from sorrow, a hope of final  rest; but this was not to be attained until desires and passions were  utterly suppressed in the soul, which could be effected only by prayer,  devout meditations, and a rigorous self-discipline. In order to be  purified and fitted for Nirvana the soul, it was supposed, must pass  through successive stages of existence in mortal forms, without  conscious recollection,--innumerable births and deaths, with sorrow and  disease. And the final state of supreme blessedness, the ending of the  long and weary transmigration, would be attained only with the  extinction of all desires, even the instinctive desire for existence.    Buddha had no definite ideas of the deity, and the worship of a personal  God is nowhere to be found in his teachings, which exposed him to the  charge of atheism. He even supposed that gods were subject to death, and  must return to other forms of life before they obtained final rest in  Nirvana. Nirvana means that state which admits of neither birth nor  death, where there is no sorrow or disease,--an impassive state of  existence, absorption in the Spirit of the Universe. In the Buddhist  catechism Nirvana is defined as the \"total cessation of changes; a  perfect rest; the absence of desire, illusion, and sorrow; the total  obliteration of everything that goes to make up the physical man.\" This  theory of re-births, or transmigration of souls, is very strange and  unnatural to our less imaginative and subtile Occidental minds; but to  the speculative Orientals it is an attractive and reasonable belief.  They make the \"spirit\" the immortal part of man, the \"soul\" being its  emotional embodiment, its \"spiritual body,\" whose unsatisfied desires  cause its birth and re-birth into the fleshly form of the physical  \"body,\"--a very brief and temporary incarnation. When by the progressive  enlightenment of the spirit its longings and desires have been gradually  conquered, it no longer needs or has embodiment either of soul or of  body; so that, to quote Elliott Coues in Olcott's \"Buddhist Catechism,\"  \"a spirit in a state of conscious formlessness, subject to no further  modification by embodiment, yet in full knowledge of its experiences  [during its various incarnations], is Nirvanic.\"    Buddhism, however, viewed in any aspect, must be regarded as a gloomy  religion. It is hard enough to crucify all natural desires and lead a  life of self-abnegation; but for the spirit, in order to be purified, to  be obliged to enter into body after body, each subject to disease,  misery, and death, and then after a long series of migrations to be  virtually annihilated as the highest consummation of happiness, gives  one but a poor conception of the efforts of the proudest unaided  intellect to arrive at a knowledge of God and immortal bliss. It would  thus seem that the true idea of God, or even that of immortality, is not  an innate conception revealed by consciousness; for why should good and  intellectual men, trained to study and reflection all their lives, gain  no clearer or more inspiring notions of the Being of infinite love and  power, or of the happiness which He is able and willing to impart? What  a feeble conception of God is a being without the oversight of the  worlds that he created, without volition or purpose or benevolence, or  anything corresponding to our notion of personality! What a poor  conception of supernal bliss, without love or action or thought or holy  companionship,--only rest, unthinking repose, and absence from disease,  misery, and death, a state of endless impassiveness! What is Nirvana but  an escape from death and deliverance from mortal desires, where there  are neither ideas nor the absence of ideas; no changes or hopes or  fears, it is true, but also no joy, no aspiration, no growth, no  life,--a state of nonentity, where even consciousness is practically  extinguished, and individuality merged into absolute stillness and a  dreamless rest? What a poor reward for ages of struggle and the final  achievement of exalted virtue!    But if Buddhism failed to arrive at what we believe to be a true  knowledge of God and the destiny of the soul,--the forgiveness and  remission, or doing-away, of sin, and a joyful and active immortality,  all which I take to be revelations rather than intuitions,--yet there  were some great certitudes in its teachings which did appeal to  consciousness,--certitudes recognized by the noblest teachers of all  ages and nations. These were such realities as truthfulness, sincerity,  purity, justice, mercy, benevolence, unselfishness, love. The human mind  arrives at ethical truths, even when all speculation about God and  immortality has failed. The idea of God may be lost, but not that of  moral obligation,--the mutual social duties of mankind. There is a sense  of duty even among savages; in the lowest civilization there is true  admiration of virtue. No sage that I ever read of enjoined immorality.  No ignorance can prevent the sense of shame, of honor, or of duty.  Everybody detests a liar and despises a thief. Thou shalt not bear false  witness; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not kill,--these are  laws written in human consciousness as well as in the code of Moses.  Obedience and respect to parents are instincts as well as obligations.    Hence the prince Siddartha, as soon as he had found the wisdom of inward  motive and the folly of outward rite, shook off the yoke of the priests,  and denounced caste and austerities and penances and sacrifices as of  no avail in securing the welfare and peace of the soul or the favor of  deity. In all this he showed an enlightened mind, governed by wisdom and  truth, and even a bold and original genius,--like Abraham when he  disowned the gods of his fathers. Having thus himself gained the  security of the heights, Buddha longed to help others up, and turned his  attention to the moral instruction of the people of India. He was  emphatically a missionary of ethics, an apostle of righteousness, a  reformer of abuses, as well as a tender and compassionate man, moved to  tears in view of human sorrows and sufferings. He gave up metaphysical  speculations for practical philanthropy. He wandered from city to city  and village to village to relieve misery and teach duties rather than  theological philosophies. He did not know that God is love, but he did  know that peace and rest are the result of virtuous thoughts and acts.    \"Let us then,\" said he, \"live happily, not hating those who hate us;  free from greed among the greedy.... Proclaim mercy freely to all men;  it is as large as the spaces of heaven.... Whoever loves will feel the  longing to save not himself alone, but all others.\" He compares himself  to a father who rescues his children from a burning house, to a  physician who cures the blind. He teaches the equality of the sexes as  well as the injustice of castes. He enjoins kindness to servants and  emancipation of slaves. \"As a mother, as long as she lives, watches over  her child, so among all beings,\" said Gautama, \"let boundless good-will  prevail.... Overcome evil with good, the avaricious with generosity, the  false with truth.... Never forget thy own duty for the sake of  another's.... If a man speaks or acts with evil thoughts pain follows,  as the wheel the foot of him who draws the carriage.... He who lives  seeking pleasure, and uncontrolled, the tempter will overcome.... The  true sage dwells on earth, as the bee gathers sweetness with his mouth  and wings.... One may conquer a thousand men in battle, but he who  conquers himself alone is the greatest victor.... Let no man think  lightly of sin, saying in his heart, 'It cannot overtake me.'... Let a  man make himself what he preaches to others.... He who holds back rising  anger as one might a rolling chariot, him, indeed, I call a driver;  others may hold the reins.... A man who foolishly does me wrong, I will  return to him the protection of my ungrudging love; the more evil comes  from him, the more good shall go from me.\"    These are some of the sayings of the Indian reformer, which I quote from  extracts of his writings as translated by Sanskrit scholars. Some of  these sayings rise to a height of moral beauty surpassed only by the  precepts of the great Teacher, whom many are too fond of likening to  Buddha himself. The religion of Buddha is founded on a correct and  virtuous life, as the only way to avoid sorrow and reach Nirvana. Its  essence, theologically, is \"Quietism,\" without firm belief in anything  reached by metaphysic speculation; yet morally and practically it  inculcates ennobling, active duties.    Among the rules that Buddha laid down for his disciples were--to keep  the body pure; not to enter upon affairs of trade; to have no lands and  cattle, or houses, or money; to abhor all hypocrisy and dissimulation;  to be kind to everything that lives; never to take the life of any  living being; to control the passions; to eat food only to satisfy  hunger; not to feel resentment from injuries; to be patient and  forgiving; to avoid covetousness, and never to tire of self-reflection.  His fundamental principles are purity of mind, chastity of life,  truthfulness, temperance, abstention from the wanton destruction of  animal life, from vain pleasures, from envy, hatred, and malice. He does  not enjoin sacrifices, for he knows no god to whom they can be offered;  but \"he proclaimed the brotherhood of man, if he did not reveal the  fatherhood of God.\" He insisted on the natural equality of all  men,--thus giving to caste a mortal wound, which offended the Brahmans,  and finally led to the expulsion of his followers from India. He  protested against all absolute authority, even that of the Vedas. Nor  did he claim, any more than Confucius, originality of doctrines, only  the revival of forgotten or"]]]
