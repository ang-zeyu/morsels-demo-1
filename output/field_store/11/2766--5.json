That vile servant called my father 'a  meddling old fool,' 'Fool and meddler art thou thyself, varlet,' I  shouted, springing through the window, '_that_ for thy impudence!' and  in my heat I smote him a blow mightier than I intended, for I have  some strength in mine arm. The fellow rolled over and never breathed  afterwards, I think I broke his neck or something the like. Then I knew  that the Sheriff would use this as a pretext to hound my father, if I  tarried. So I bade the Squire farewell and told him I would seek you in  Sherwood.\"    \"Now by my halidom!\" said Robin Hood; \"for a man escaping the law, you  took it about as coolly as one could wish. To see you come tripping  along decked out in all your gay plumage and trolling forth a roundelay,  one would think you had not a care in all the world. Indeed I remarked  to Little John here that I hoped your purse was not as light as your  heart.\"    \"Belike you meant _head_,\" laughed Will; \"and is this Little John the  Great? Shake hands with me, an you will, and promise me to cross a staff  with me in friendly bout some day in the forest!\"    \"That will I!\" quoth Little John heartily. \"Here's my hand on it. What  is your last name again, say you?\"    \"'Tis to be changed,\" interposed Robin; \"then shall the men armed with  warrants go hang for all of us. Let me bethink myself. Ah!--I have it!  In scarlet he came to us, and that shall be his name henceforth. Welcome  to the greenwood, Will Scarlet!\"    \"Aye, welcome, Will Scarlet!\" said Little John; and they all clasped  hands again and swore to be true each to the other and to Robin Hood's  men in Sherwood Forest.          CHAPTER VII    HOW ROBIN HOOD MET FRIAR TUCK         The friar took Robin Hood on his back,       Deep water he did bestride,       And spake neither good word nor bad,       Till he came at the other side.    In summer time when leaves grow green, and flowers are fresh and gay,  Robin Hood and his merry men were all disposed to play. Thus runs a  quaint old ballad which begins the next adventure. Then some would leap  and some would run and some try archery and some ply the quarter-staff  and some fall to with the good broad sword. Some again would try a round  at buffet and fisticuff; and thus by every variety of sport and exercise  they perfected themselves in skill and made the band and its prowess  well known throughout all England.    It had been a custom of Robin Hood's to pick out the best men in all the  countryside. Whenever he heard of one more than usually skilled in  any feat of arms he would seek the man and test him in personal  encounter--which did not always end happily for Robin. And when he had  found a man to his liking he offered him service with the bold fellows  of Sherwood Forest.    Thus it came about that one day after a practice at shooting, in which  Little John struck down a hart at five hundred feet distance, Robin Hood  was fain to boast.    \"God's blessing on your heart!\" he cried, clapping the burly fellow on  the shoulder; \"I would travel an hundred miles to find one who could  match you!\"    At this Will Scarlet laughed full roundly.    \"There lives a curtall friar in Fountain's Abbey--Tuck, by name--who can  beat both him and you,\" he said.    Robin pricked up his ears at this free speech.    \"By our Lady,\" he said, \"I'll neither eat nor drink till I see this same  friar.\"    And with his usual impetuosity he at once set about arming himself for  the adventure. On his head he placed a cap of steel. Underneath his  Lincoln green he wore a coat of chain metal. Then with sword and buckler  girded at his side he made a goodly show. But he also took with him his  stout yew bow and a sheaf of chosen arrows.    So he set forth upon his way with blithe heart; for it was a day when  the whole face of the earth seemed glad and rejoicing in pulsing life.  Steadily he pressed forward by winding ways till he came to a green  broad pasture land at whose edge flowed a stream dipping in and out  among the willows and rushes on the banks. A pleasant stream it was, but  it flowed calmly as though of some depth in the middle. Robin did not  fancy getting his feet wet, or his fine suit of mail rusted, so he  paused on the hither bank to rest and take his bearings.    As he sat down quietly under the shade of a drooping willow he heard  snatches of a jovial song floating to him from the farther side; then  came a sound of two men's voices arguing. One was upholding the  merits of hasty pudding and the other stood out stoutly for meat pie,  \"especially\"--quoth this one--\"when flavored with young onions!\"    \"Gramercy!\" muttered Robin to himself, \"that is a tantalizing speech to  a hungry man! But, odds bodikins! did ever two men talk more alike than  those two fellows yonder!\"    In truth Robin could well marvel at the speech, for the voices were  curiously alike.    Presently the willows parted on the other bank, and Robin could hardly  forebear laughing out right. His mystery was explained. It was not two  men who had done all this singing and talking, but one--and that one a  stout curtall friar who wore a long cloak over his portly frame, tied  with a cord in the middle. On his head was a knight's helmet, and in his  hand was a no more warlike weapon than a huge pasty pie, with which he  sat down by the water's edge. His twofold argument was finished. The  meat pie had triumphed; and no wonder! for it was the present witness,  soon to give its own testimony.    But first the friar took off his helmet to cool his head, and a droll  picture he made. His head was as round as an apple, and eke as smooth in  spots. A fringe of close curling black hair grew round the base of his  skull, but his crown was bare and shiny as an egg. His cheeks also were  smooth and red and shiny; and his little gray eyes danced about with  the funniest air imaginable. You would not have blamed Robin Hood for  wanting to laugh, had you heard this serious two-faced talk and then  seen this jovial one-faced man. Good humor and fat living stood out all  over him; yet for all that he looked stout enough and able to take  care of himself with any man. His short neck was thick like that of a  Berkshire bull; his shoulders were set far back, and his arms sprouted  therefrom like two oak limbs. As he sat him down, the cloak fell apart  disclosing a sword and buckler as stout as Robin's own.    Nathless, Robin was not dismayed at sight of the weapons. Instead, his  heart fell within him when he saw the meat pie which was now in fair  way to be devoured before his very eyes; for the friar lost no time in  thrusting one hand deep into the pie, while he crossed himself with the  other.    Thereupon Robin seized his bow and fitted a shaft.    \"Hey, friar!\" he sang out, \"carry me over the water, or else I cannot  answer for your safety.\"    The other started at the unexpected greeting, and laid his hand upon  his sword. Then he looked up and beheld Robin's arrow pointing full upon  him.    \"Put down your bow, fellow,\" he shouted back, \"and I will bring you over  the brook. 'Tis our duty in life to help each other, and your keen shaft  shows me that you are a man worthy of some attention.\" So the friar  knight got him up gravely, though his eyes twinkled with a cunning  light, and laid aside his beloved pie and his cloak and his sword and  his buckler, and waded across the stream with waddling dignity. Then he  took Robin Hood upon his back and spoke neither good word nor bad till  he came to the other side.    Lightly leaped Robin off his back, and said, \"I am much beholden to you,  good father.\"    \"Beholden, say you!\" rejoined the other drawing his sword; \"then by my  faith you shall e'en repay your score. Now mine own affairs, which are  of a spiritual kind and much more important than yours which are carnal,  lie on the other side of this stream. I see that you are a likely man  and one, moreover, who would not refuse to serve the church. I must  therefore pray of you that whatsoever I have done unto you, you will do  also unto me. In short, my son, you must e'en carry me back again.\"    Courteously enough was this said; but so suddenly had the friar drawn  his sword that Robin had no time to unsling his bow from his back,  whither he had placed it to avoid getting it wet, or to unfasten his  scabbard. So he was fain to temporize.    \"Nay, good father, but I shall get my feet wet,\" he commenced.    \"Are your feet any better than mine?\" retorted the other. \"I fear me  now that I have already wetted myself so sadly as to lay in a store of  rheumatic pains by way of penance.\"    \"I am not so strong as you,\" continued Robin; \"that helmet and sword and  buckler would be my undoing on the uncertain footing amidstream, to say  nothing of your holy flesh and bones.\"    \"Then I will lighten up, somewhat,\" replied the other calmly. \"Promise  to carry me across and I will lay aside my war gear.\"    \"Agreed,\" said Robin; and the friar thereupon stripped himself; and  Robin bent his stout back and took him up even as he had promised.    Now the stones at the bottom of the stream were round and slippery, and  the current swept along strongly, waist-deep, in the middle. More-over  Robin had a heavier load than the other had borne, nor did he know the  ford. So he went stumbling along now stepping into a deep hole, now  stumbling over a boulder in a manner that threatened to unseat his rider  or plunge them both clear under current. But the fat friar hung on and  dug his heels into his steed's ribs in as gallant manner as if he were  riding in a tournament; while as for poor Robin the sweat ran down him  in torrents and he gasped like the winded horse he was. But at last he  managed to stagger out on the bank and deposit his unwieldy load.    No sooner had he set the friar down than he seized his own sword.    \"Now, holy friar,\" quoth he, panting and wiping the sweat from his brow,  \"what say the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/836"],[0,"The Phoenix and the Carpet (#10)"],[1," it took him quite a long time to get the sand out of his  mouth afterwards.    'He says,' the Phoenix remarked after some time, 'that they wish to  engage your cook permanently.'    'Without a character?' asked Anthea, who had heard her mother speak of  such things.    'They do not wish to engage her as cook, but as queen; and queens need  not have characters.'    There was a breathless pause.    'WELL,' said Cyril, 'of all the choices! But there's no accounting for  tastes.'    Every one laughed at the idea of the cook's being engaged as queen; they  could not help it.    'I do not advise laughter,' warned the Phoenix, ruffling out his golden  feathers, which were extremely wet. 'And it's not their own choice. It  seems that there is an ancient prophecy of this copper-coloured tribe  that a great queen should some day arise out of the sea with a white  crown on her head, and--and--well, you see! There's the crown!'    It pointed its claw at cook's cap; and a very dirty cap it was, because  it was the end of the week.    'That's the white crown,' it said; 'at least, it's nearly white--very  white indeed compared to the colour THEY are--and anyway, it's quite  white enough.'    Cyril addressed the cook. 'Look here!' said he, 'these brown people want  you to be their queen. They're only savages, and they don't know any  better. Now would you really like to stay? or, if you'll promise not to  be so jolly aggravating at home, and not to tell any one a word about  to-day, we'll take you back to Camden Town.'    'No, you don't,' said the cook, in firm, undoubting tones. 'I've always  wanted to be the Queen, God bless her! and I always thought what a good  one I should make; and now I'm going to. IF it's only in a dream, it's  well worth while. And I don't go back to that nasty underground kitchen,  and me blamed for everything; that I don't, not till the dream's  finished and I wake up with that nasty bell a rang-tanging in my  ears--so I tell you.'    'Are you SURE,' Anthea anxiously asked the Phoenix, 'that she will be  quite safe here?'    'She will find the nest of a queen a very precious and soft thing,' said  the bird, solemnly.    'There--you hear,' said Cyril. 'You're in for a precious soft thing,  so mind you're a good queen, cook. It's more than you'd any right to  expect, but long may you reign.'    Some of the cook's copper-coloured subjects now advanced from the forest  with long garlands of beautiful flowers, white and sweet-scented, and  hung them respectfully round the neck of their new sovereign.    'What! all them lovely bokays for me!' exclaimed the enraptured cook.  'Well, this here is something LIKE a dream, I must say.'    She sat up very straight on the carpet, and the copper-coloured ones,  themselves wreathed in garlands of the gayest flowers, madly stuck  parrot feathers in their hair and began to dance. It was a dance such as  you have never seen; it made the children feel almost sure that the  cook was right, and that they were all in a dream. Small, strange-shaped  drums were beaten, odd-sounding songs were sung, and the dance got  faster and faster and odder and odder, till at last all the dancers fell  on the sand tired out.    The new queen, with her white crown-cap all on one side, clapped wildly.    'Brayvo!' she cried, 'brayvo! It's better than the Albert Edward  Music-hall in the Kentish Town Road. Go it again!'    But the Phoenix would not translate this request into the  copper-coloured language; and when the savages had recovered their  breath, they implored their queen to leave her white escort and come  with them to their huts.    'The finest shall be yours, O queen,' said they.    'Well--so long!' said the cook, getting heavily on to her feet, when the  Phoenix had translated this request. 'No more kitchens and attics for  me, thank you. I'm off to my royal palace, I am; and I only wish this  here dream would keep on for ever and ever.'    She picked up the ends of the garlands that trailed round her feet,  and the children had one last glimpse of her striped stockings and worn  elastic-side boots before she disappeared into the shadow of the forest,  surrounded by her dusky retainers, singing songs of rejoicing as they  went.    'WELL!' said Cyril, 'I suppose she's all right, but they don't seem to  count us for much, one way or the other.'    'Oh,' said the Phoenix, 'they think you're merely dreams. The prophecy  said that the queen would arise from the waves with a white crown and  surrounded by white dream-children. That's about what they think YOU  are!'    'And what about dinner?' said Robert, abruptly.    'There won't be any dinner, with no cook and no pudding-basin,' Anthea  reminded him; 'but there's always bread-and-butter.'    'Let's get home,' said Cyril.    The Lamb was furiously unwishful to be dressed in his warm clothes  again, but Anthea and Jane managed it, by force disguised as coaxing,  and he never once whooping-coughed.    Then every one put on its own warm things and took its place on the  carpet.    A sound of uncouth singing still came from beyond the trees where the  copper-coloured natives were crooning songs of admiration and respect  to their white-crowned queen. Then Anthea said 'Home,' just as duchesses  and other people do to their coachmen, and the intelligent carpet in  one whirling moment laid itself down in its proper place on the nursery  floor. And at that very moment Eliza opened the door and said--    'Cook's gone! I can't find her anywhere, and there's no dinner ready.  She hasn't taken her box nor yet her outdoor things. She just ran out to  see the time, I shouldn't wonder--the kitchen clock never did give her  satisfaction--and she's got run over or fell down in a fit as likely  as not. You'll have to put up with the cold bacon for your dinners; and  what on earth you've got your outdoor things on for I don't know.  And then I'll slip out and see if they know anything about her at the  police-station.'    But nobody ever knew anything about the cook any more, except the  children, and, later, one other person.      Mother was so upset at losing the cook, and so anxious about her, that  Anthea felt most miserable, as though she had done something very wrong  indeed. She woke several times in the night, and at last decided that  she would ask the Phoenix to let her tell her mother all about it. But  there was no opportunity to do this next day, because the Phoenix, as  usual, had gone to sleep in some out-of-the-way spot, after asking, as a  special favour, not to be disturbed for twenty-four hours.    The Lamb never whooping-coughed once all that Sunday, and mother and  father said what good medicine it was that the doctor had given him. But  the children knew that it was the southern shore where you can't have  whooping-cough that had cured him. The Lamb babbled of coloured sand  and water, but no one took any notice of that. He often talked of things  that hadn't happened.    It was on Monday morning, very early indeed, that Anthea woke and  suddenly made up her mind. She crept downstairs in her night-gown (it  was very chilly), sat down on the carpet, and with a beating heart  wished herself on the sunny shore where you can't have whooping-cough,  and next moment there she was.    The sand was splendidly warm. She could feel it at once, even through  the carpet. She folded the carpet, and put it over her shoulders like  a shawl, for she was determined not to be parted from it for a single  instant, no matter how hot it might be to wear.    Then trembling a little, and trying to keep up her courage by saying  over and over, 'It is my DUTY, it IS my duty,' she went up the forest  path.    'Well, here you are again,' said the cook, directly she saw Anthea.    'This dream does keep on!'    The cook was dressed in a white robe; she had no shoes and stockings  and no cap and she was sitting under a screen of palm-leaves, for it was  afternoon in the island, and blazing hot. She wore a flower wreath  on her hair, and copper-coloured boys were fanning her with peacock's  feathers.    'They've got the cap put away,' she said. 'They seem to think a lot of  it. Never saw one before, I expect.'    'Are you happy?' asked Anthea, panting; the sight of the cook as queen  quite took her breath away.    'I believe you, my dear,' said the cook, heartily. 'Nothing to do unless  you want to. But I'm getting rested now. Tomorrow I'm going to start  cleaning out my hut, if the dream keeps on, and I shall teach them  cooking; they burns everything to a cinder now unless they eats it raw.'    'But can you talk to them?'    'Lor' love a duck, yes!' the happy cook-queen replied; 'it's quite easy  to pick up. I always thought I should be quick at foreign languages.  I've taught them to understand \"dinner,\" and \"I want a drink,\" and \"You  leave me be,\" already.'    'Then you don't want anything?' Anthea asked earnestly and anxiously.    'Not me, miss; except if you'd only go away. I'm afraid of me waking  up with that bell a-going if you keep on stopping here a-talking to me.  Long as this here dream keeps up I'm as happy as a queen.'    'Goodbye, then,' said Anthea, gaily, for her conscience was clear now.    She hurried into the wood, threw herself on the ground, and said  'Home'--and there she was, rolled in the carpet on the nursery floor.    'SHE'S all right, anyhow,' said Anthea, and went back to bed. 'I'm glad  somebody's pleased. But mother will never believe me when I tell her.'    The story is indeed a little difficult to believe. Still, you might try.        CHAPTER 4. TWO BAZAARS      Mother was really a great dear. She was pretty and she was loving, and  most frightfully good when you were ill, and always kind, and almost  always just. That is, she was just when she understood things. But  of course she did not always understand things. No one understands  everything, and mothers are not angels, though a good many of them come  pretty near"]]]
