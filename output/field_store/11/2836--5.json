One of these halls  in southern India had fifteen hundred cells. The most celebrated was  the Nalanda monastery, founded in the first century by Nagarjuna, which  accommodated ten thousand priests, and was enclosed by a wall measuring  sixteen hundred feet by four hundred. It was to Central India what Mount  Casino was to Italy, and Cluny was to France, in the Middle Ages,--the  seat of learning and art.    It was not until the Mohammedan conquest in India that architecture  received a new impulse from the Saracenic influence. Then arose the  mosques, minarets, and palaces which are a wonder for their  magnificence, and in which are seen the influence of Greek art as well  as that of India. There is an Oriental splendor in these palaces and  mosques which has called out the admiration of critics, although it is  different from those types of beauty which we are accustomed to praise.  But these later edifices were erected in the Middle Ages, coeval with  the cathedrals of Europe, and therefore do not properly come under the  head of ancient art, in which the ancient Hindus, whether of Aryan or  Turanian descent, did not particularly excel. It was in matters of  religion and philosophy that the Hindus felt most interest, even as the  ancient Jews thought more of theology than of art and science.    Architecture, however, as the expression of genius and high  civilization, was carried to perfection only by the Greeks, who excelled  in so many things. It was among the ancient Dorians, who descended from  the mountains of northern Greece eighty years after the fall of Troy,  that architectural art worthy of the name first appeared. The Pelasgi  erected Cyclopean structures fifteen hundred years before Christ, as  seen in the massive walls of the Acropolis at Athens, constructed of  huge blocks of hewn stone, and in the palaces of the princes of the  heroic times. The lintel of the doorway of the Mycenaean treasury is  composed of a single stone twenty-seven feet long and sixteen broad. But  these edifices, which aimed at splendor and richness merely, were  deficient in that simplicity and harmony which have given immortality to  the temples of the Dorians. In this style of architecture everything was  suitable to its object, and was grand and noble. The great thickness of  the columns, the beautiful entablature, the ample proportion of the  capital, the great horizontal lines of the architrave and cornice  predominating over the vertical lines of the columns, the severity of  geometrical forms produced for the most part by straight lines, gave an  imposing simplicity to the Doric temple.    How far the Greek architects were indebted to the Egyptian we cannot  tell, for though columns are found amid the ruins of the Egyptian  temples, they are of different shape from any made by the Greeks. In the  structures of Thebes we find both the tumescent and the cylindrical  columns, from which amalgamation might have been produced the Doric  column. The Greeks seized on beauty wherever they found it, and improved  upon it. The Doric column was not probably an entirely new creation, but  shaped after models furnished by the most original of all the ancient  nations, even the Egyptians. The Doric temples were uniform in plan. The  columns were fluted, and were generally about six diameters in height;  they diminished gradually upward from the base, with a slightly con  vexed swelling; they were surmounted by capitals regularly proportioned  according to their height. The entablature which the column supported  was also of a certain number of diameters in height. So regular and  perfect was the plan of the temple, that \"if the dimensions of a single  column and the proportion the entablature should bear to it were given  to two individuals acquainted with the style, with directions to compose  a temple, they would produce designs exactly similar in size,  arrangement, and general proportions.\" The Doric order possessed a  peculiar harmony, but taste and skill were nevertheless necessary in  order to determine the number of diameters a column should have, and  also the height of the entablature.    The Doric was the favorite order of European Greece for one thousand  years, and also of her colonies in Sicily and Magna Graecia. It was  used exclusively until after the Macedonian conquest, and was chiefly  applied to temples. The massive temples of Paestum, the colossal  magnificence of the Sicilian ruins, and the more elegant proportions of  the Athenian structures, like the Parthenon and Temple of Theseus, show  the perfection of the Doric architecture. Although the general style of  all the Doric temples is so uniform, hardly two temples were alike. The  earlier Doric was more massive; the later was more elegant, and its  edifices were rich in sculptured decorations. Nothing could surpass the  beauty of a Doric temple in the time of Pericles. The stylobate, or  general base upon which the columnar story stood, from two thirds to a  whole diameter of a column in height, was built in three equal courses,  which gradually receded upward and formed steps, as it were, of a grand  platform. The column, simply set upon the stylobate, without base or  pedestal, was from four to six diameters in height, with twenty flutes,  having a capital of half a diameter. On this rested the entablature, two  column-diameters in height, which was divided into architrave (lower  mouldings), frieze (broad middle space), and cornice (upper mouldings).  The great beauty of the temple was the portico in front,--a forest of  columns supporting the triangular pediment, about a diameter and a half  to the apex, making an angle at the base of about fourteen degrees.  From the pediment projects the cornice, while in the apex and at the  base of the flat three-cornered gable are sculptured ornaments,  generally the figures of men or animals. The whole outline of columns  supporting the entablature is graceful, while the variety of light and  shade arising from the arrangement of mouldings and capitals produces a  grand effect.    The Parthenon, the most beautiful specimen of the Doric, has never been  equalled, and it still stands august in its ruins, the glory of the old  Acropolis and the pride of Athens. It was built of white Pentelic  marble, and rested on a basement of limestone. It was two hundred and  twenty-seven feet in length, one hundred and one in breadth, and  sixty-five in height, surrounded with forty-eight fluted columns, six  feet and two inches at the base and thirty-four feet in height, while  within the peristyle, at either end, was an interior range of columns  standing before the end of the cella. The frieze and the pediment were  elaborately ornamented with reliefs and statues, and the cella, within  and without, was adorned with the choicest sculptures of Phidias, The  remains of the exquisite sculptures of the pediment and the frieze were  in the early part of this century brought from Greece by Lord Elgin,  purchased by the English government, and placed in the British Museum,  where, preserved from further dilapidation, they stand as indisputable  evidence of the perfection of Greek art. The grandest adornment of the  temple was the colossal statue of Minerva in the eastern apartment of  the cella, forty feet in height, composed of gold and ivory; the inner  walls of the chamber were decorated with paintings, and the whole temple  was a repository of countless treasure. But the Parthenon, so regular to  the eye with its vertical, oblique, and horizontal lines, was curved in  every line, with the exception of the gable,--with its entablature,  architrave, frieze, and cornice, together with the basement, all arched  upwards; and even the columns had a slight convexity of vertical line,  amounting to 1/550 of the entire height of shaft, though so slightly as  not to be perceptible. These curved lines gave to the structure a  peculiar grace which cannot be imitated, as well as an effect  of solidity.    Nearly coeval with the Doric was the Ionic order, invented by the  Asiatic Greeks, still more graceful, though not so imposing. The  Acropolis is a perfect example of this order. The column is nine  diameters in height, with a base, while the capital is more ornamented  than the Doric. The shaft is fluted with twenty-four flutes and  alternate fillets (flat longitudinal ridges), and the fillet is about a  quarter the width of the flute. The pediment is flatter than that of  the Doric order, and more elaborate. The great distinction of the Ionic  column is a base, and a capital formed with volutes (spiral scrolls),  the shaft also being more slender. Vitruvius, the greatest authority  among the ancients in architecture, says that \"the Greeks, in inventing  these two kinds of columns, imitated in the one the naked simplicity and  dignity of man, and in the other the delicacy and ornaments of woman;  the base of the Ionic was the imitation of sandals, and the volutes of  ringlets.\" The discoveries of many of the Ionic ornamentations among the  remains of Assyrian architecture indicate the Oriental source of the  Ionic ideas, just as the Doric style seems to have originated in Egypt.  The artistic Greeks, however, always simplified and refined upon  their masters.    The Corinthian order exhibits a still greater refinement and elegance  than the other two, and was introduced toward the end of the  Peloponnesian War. Its peculiarity consists in columns with foliated  capitals modelled after the acanthus leaf, and still greater height,  about ten diameters, surmounted with a more ornamented entablature. Of  this order the most famous temple in Greece was that of Minerva at  Tegea, built by Scopas of Paros, but destroyed by fire four hundred  years before Christ.    Nothing more distinguished Greek architecture than the variety, the  grace, and the beauty of the mouldings, generally in eccentric curves.

Pp. 54-55, l. 966 ff., That which Needs Must Be.]--Ananke or Necessity.--  Orphic rune.]--The charms inscribed by Orpheus on certain tablets in  Thrace. Orphic literature and worship had a strong magical element in  them.    P. 55, l. 995 ff., A grave-mound of the dead.]--Every existing Greek  tragedy has somewhere in it a taboo grave--a grave which is either  worshipped, or specially avoided or somehow magical. We may conjecture  from this passage that there was in the time of Euripides a sacred tomb  near Pherae, which received worship and had the story told about it that  she who lay there had died for her husband.    Pp. 56-67, ll. 1008-end. This last scene must have been exceedingly  difficult to compose, and some critics have thought it ineffective or  worse. To me it seems brilliantly conceived and written, though of course  it needs to be read with the imagination strongly at work. One must never  forget the silent and veiled Woman on whom the whole scene centres. I have  tried conjecturally to indicate the main lines of her acting, but, of  course, others may read it differently.    To understand Heracles in this scene, one must first remember the  traditional connexion of Satyrs (and therefore of satyric heroes) with the  re-awakening of the dead Earth in spring and the return of human souls to  their tribe. Dionysus was, of all the various Kouroi, the one most widely  connected with resurrection ideas, and the Satyrs are his attendant  daemons, who dance magic dances at the Return to Life of Semele or  Persephone. And Heracles himself, in certain of his ritual aspects, has  similar functions. See J.E. Harrison, _Themis_, pp. 422 f. and 365  ff., or my _Four Stages of Greek Religion_, pp. 46 f. This tradition  explains, to start with, what Heracles--and this particular sort of  revelling Heracles--has to do in a resurrection scene. Heracles bringing  back the dead is a datum of the saga. There remain then the more purely  dramatic questions about our poet's treatment of the datum.    Why, for instance, does Heracles mystify Admetus with the Veiled Woman? To  break the news gently, or to retort his own mystification upon him? I  think, the latter. Admetus had said that \"a woman\" was dead; Heracles  says: \"All right: here is 'a woman' whom I want you to look after.\"    Again, what are the feelings of Admetus himself? First, mere indignation  and disgust at the utterly tactless proposal: then, I think, in 1061 ff.  (\"I must walk with care\" ... end of speech), a strange discovery about  himself which amazes and humiliates him. As he looks at the woman he finds  himself feeling how exactly like Alcestis she is, and then yearning  towards her, almost falling in love with her. A most beautiful and  poignant touch. In modern language one would say that his subconscious  nature feels Alcestis there and responds emotionally to her presence; his  conscious nature, believing the woman to be a stranger, is horrified at  his own apparent baseness and inconstancy.    P. 57, l. 1051, Where in my castle, etc.]--The castle is divided into two  main parts: a public _megaron_ or great hall where the men live  during; the day and sleep at night, and a private region, ruled by the  queen and centring in the _thalamos_ or royal bed-chamber. If the new  woman were taken into this \"harem,\" even if Admetus never spoke to her,  the world outside would surmise the worst and consider him dishonoured.    P. 66, l. 1148, Be righteous to thy guest, As he would have thee be.]--  Does this mean \"Go on being hospitable, as you have been,\" or \"Learn after  this not to take liberties with other guests\"? It is hard to say.    P. 66, l. 1152, The feasting day shall surely come; now I must needs  away.]--A fine last word for Heracles. We have seen him feasting, but that  makes a small part in his life. His main life is to perform labour upon  labour in service to his king. Euripides occasionally liked this method of  ending a play, not with a complete finish (Greek _catastrophe_), but  with the opening of a door into some further vista of endurance or  adventure. The _Trojan Women_ ends by the women going out to the  Greek ships to begin a life of slavery; the _Rhesus_ with the doomed  army of Trojans gathering bravely for an attack which we know will be  disastrous. Here we have the story finished for Admetus and Alcestis, but  no rest for Heracles. See the note at the end of my _Trojan Women_."]]]
