No fantastic foolery could look him in the face. So  stern was the energy of his aspect that the whole man, visage, frame  and soul, seemed wrought of iron gifted with life and thought, yet all  of one substance with his headpiece and breastplate. It was the  Puritan of Puritans: it was Endicott himself.    \"Stand off, priest of Baal!\" said he, with a grim frown and laying no  reverent hand upon the surplice. \"I know thee, Blackstone![1] Thou art  the man who couldst not abide the rule even of thine own corrupted  Church, and hast come hither to preach iniquity and to give example of  it in thy life. But now shall it be seen that the Lord hath sanctified  this wilderness for his peculiar people. Woe unto them that would  defile it! And first for this flower-decked abomination, the altar of  thy worship!\"    [Footnote 1: Did Governor Endicott speak less positively, we should  suspect a mistake here. The Rev. Mr. Blackstone, though an eccentric,  is not known to have been an immoral man. We rather doubt his identity  with the priest of Merry Mount.]    And with his keen sword Endicott assaulted the hallowed Maypole. Nor  long did it resist his arm. It groaned with a dismal sound, it  showered leaves and rosebuds upon the remorseless enthusiast, and  finally, with all its green boughs and ribbons and flowers, symbolic  of departed pleasures, down fell the banner-staff of Merry Mount. As  it sank, tradition says, the evening sky grew darker and the woods  threw forth a more sombre shadow.    \"There!\" cried Endicott, looking triumphantly on his work; \"there lies  the only Maypole in New England. The thought is strong within me that  by its fall is shadowed forth the fate of light and idle mirthmakers  amongst us and our posterity. Amen, saith John Endicott!\"    \"Amen!\" echoed his followers.    But the votaries of the Maypole gave one groan for their idol. At the  sound the Puritan leader glanced at the crew of Comus, each a figure  of broad mirth, yet at this moment strangely expressive of sorrow and  dismay.    \"Valiant captain,\" quoth Peter Palfrey, the ancient of the band, \"what  order shall be taken with the prisoners?\"    \"I thought not to repent me of cutting down a Maypole,\" replied  Endicott, \"yet now I could find in my heart to plant it again and give  each of these bestial pagans one other dance round their idol. It  would have served rarely for a whipping-post.\"    \"But there are pine trees enow,\" suggested the lieutenant.    \"True, good ancient,\" said the leader. \"Wherefore bind the heathen  crew and bestow on them a small matter of stripes apiece as earnest of  our future justice. Set some of the rogues in the stocks to rest  themselves so soon as Providence shall bring us to one of our own  well-ordered settlements where such accommodations may be found.  Further penalties, such as branding and cropping of ears, shall be  thought of hereafter.\"    \"How many stripes for the priest?\" inquired Ancient Palfrey.    \"None as yet,\" answered Endicott, bending his iron frown upon the  culprit. \"It must be for the Great and General Court to determine  whether stripes and long imprisonment, and other grievous penalty, may  atone for his transgressions. Let him look to himself. For such as  violate our civil order it may be permitted us to show mercy, but woe  to the wretch that troubleth our religion!\"    \"And this dancing bear?\" resumed the officer. \"Must he share the  stripes of his fellows?\"    \"Shoot him through the head!\" said the energetic Puritan. \"I suspect  witchcraft in the beast.\"    \"Here be a couple of shining ones,\" continued Peter Palfrey, pointing  his weapon at the Lord and Lady of the May. \"They seem to be of high  station among these misdoers. Methinks their dignity will not be  fitted with less than a double share of stripes.\"    Endicott rested on his sword and closely surveyed the dress and aspect  of the hapless pair. There they stood, pale, downcast and  apprehensive, yet there was an air of mutual support and of pure  affection seeking aid and giving it that showed them to be man and  wife with the sanction of a priest upon their love. The youth in the  peril of the moment, had dropped his gilded staff and thrown his arm  about the Lady of the May, who leaned against his breast too lightly  to burden him, but with weight enough to express that their destinies  were linked together for good or evil. They looked first at each other  and then into the grim captain's face. There they stood in the first  hour of wedlock, while the idle pleasures of which their companions  were the emblems had given place to the sternest cares of life,  personified by the dark Puritans. But never had their youthful beauty  seemed so pure and high as when its glow was chastened by adversity.    \"Youth,\" said Endicott, \"ye stand in an evil case--thou and thy  maiden-wife. Make ready presently, for I am minded that ye shall both  have a token to remember your wedding-day.\"    \"Stern man,\" cried the May-lord, \"how can I move thee? Were the means  at hand, I would resist to the death; being powerless, I entreat. Do  with me as thou wilt, but let Edith go untouched.\"    \"Not so,\" replied the immitigable zealot. \"We are not wont to show an  idle courtesy to that sex which requireth the stricter discipline.--What  sayest thou, maid? Shall thy silken bridegroom suffer thy share of the  penalty besides his own?\"    \"Be it death,\" said Edith, \"and lay it all on me.\"    Truly, as Endicott had said, the poor lovers stood in a woeful case.  Their foes were triumphant, their friends captive and abased, their  home desolate, the benighted wilderness around them, and a rigorous  destiny in the shape of the Puritan leader their only guide. Yet the  deepening twilight could not altogether conceal that the iron man was  softened. He smiled at the fair spectacle of early love; he almost  sighed for the inevitable blight of early hopes.    \"The troubles of life have come hastily on this young couple,\"  observed Endicott. \"We will see how they comport themselves under  their present trials ere we burden them with greater. If among the  spoil there be any garments of a more decent fashion, let them be put  upon this May-lord and his Lady instead of their glistening vanities.  Look to it, some of you.\"    \"And shall not the youth's hair be cut?\" asked Peter Palfrey, looking  with abhorrence at the lovelock and long glossy curls of the young  man.    \"Crop it forthwith, and that in the true pumpkin-shell fashion,\"  answered the captain. \"Then bring them along with us, but more gently  than their fellows. There be qualities in the youth which may make him  valiant to fight and sober to toil and pious to pray, and in the  maiden that may fit her to become a mother in our Israel, bringing up  babes in better nurture than her own hath been.--Nor think ye, young  ones, that they are the happiest, even in our lifetime of a moment,  who misspend it in dancing round a Maypole.\"    And Endicott, the severest Puritan of all who laid the rock-foundation  of New England, lifted the wreath of roses from the ruin of the  Maypole and threw it with his own gauntleted hand over the heads of  the Lord and Lady of the May. It was a deed of prophecy. As the moral  gloom of the world overpowers all systematic gayety, even so was their  home of wild mirth made desolate amid the sad forest. They returned to  it no more. But as their flowery garland was wreathed of the brightest  roses that had grown there, so in the tie that united them were  intertwined all the purest and best of their early joys. They went  heavenward supporting each other along the difficult path which it was  their lot to tread, and never wasted one regretful thought on the  vanities of Merry Mount.          THE GENTLE BOY.      In the course of the year 1656 several of the people called  Quakers--led, as they professed, by the inward movement of the  spirit--made their appearance in New England. Their reputation as  holders of mystic and pernicious principles having spread before them,  the Puritans early endeavored to banish and to prevent the further  intrusion of the rising sect. But the measures by which it was  intended to purge the land of heresy, though more than sufficiently  vigorous, were entirely unsuccessful. The Quakers, esteeming  persecution as a divine call to the post of danger, laid claim to a  holy courage unknown to the Puritans themselves, who had shunned the  cross by providing for the peaceable exercise of their religion in a  distant wilderness. Though it was the singular fact that every nation  of the earth rejected the wandering enthusiasts who practised peace  toward all men, the place of greatest uneasiness and peril, and  therefore in their eyes the most eligible, was the province of  Massachusetts Bay.    The fines, imprisonments and stripes liberally distributed by our  pious forefathers, the popular antipathy, so strong that it endured  nearly a hundred years after actual persecution had ceased, were  attractions as powerful for the Quakers as peace, honor and reward  would have been for the worldly-minded. Every European vessel brought  new cargoes of the sect, eager to testify against the oppression which  they hoped to share; and when shipmasters were restrained by heavy  fines from affording them passage, they made long and circuitous  journeys through the Indian country, and appeared in the province as  if conveyed by a supernatural power. Their enthusiasm, heightened  almost to madness by the treatment which they received, produced  actions contrary to the rules of decency as well as of rational  religion, and presented a singular contrast to the calm and staid  deportment of their sectarian successors of the present day. The  command of the Spirit, inaudible except to the soul and not to be  controverted on grounds of human wisdom, was made a plea for most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1371"],[0,"Astoria; Or, Anecdotes of an Enterprise Beyond the Rocky Mountains (#11)"],[1,"ealing--A Royal Pork       Merchant--Grievances of a Matter-of-Fact Man.    OWYHEE, or Hawaii, as it is written by more exact orthographers, is the  largest of the cluster, ten in number, of the Sandwich Islands. It is  about ninety-seven miles in length, and seventy-eight in breadth, rising  gradually into three pyramidal summits or cones; the highest, Mouna  Roa, being eighteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, so as to  domineer over the whole archipelago, and to be a landmark over a wide  extent of ocean. It remains a lasting monument of the enterprising  and unfortunate Captain Cook, who was murdered by the natives of this  island.    The Sandwich Islanders, when first discovered, evinced a character  superior to most of the savages of the Pacific isles. They were frank  and open in their deportment, friendly and liberal in their dealings,  with an apt ingenuity apparent in all their rude inventions.    The tragical fate of the discoverer, which, for a time, brought them  under the charge of ferocity, was, in fact, the result of sudden  exasperation, caused by the seizure of their chief.    At the time of the visit of the Tonquin, the islanders had profited, in  many respects, by occasional intercourse with white men; and had shown a  quickness to observe and cultivate those arts important to their mode  of living. Originally they had no means of navigating the seas by which  they were surrounded, superior to light pirogues, which were little  competent to contend with the storms of the broad ocean. As the  islanders are not in sight of each other, there could, therefore, be but  casual intercourse between them. The traffic with white men had put  them in possession of vessels of superior description; they had made  themselves acquainted with their management, and had even made rude  advances in the art of ship-building.    These improvements had been promoted, in a great measure, by the energy  and sagacity of one man, the famous Tamaahmaah. He had originally been  a petty eri, or chief; but, being of an intrepid and aspiring nature, he  had risen in rank, and, availing himself of the superior advantages now  afforded in navigation, had brought the whole archipelago in subjection  to his arms. At the time of the arrival of the Tonquin he had about  forty schooners, of from twenty to thirty tons burden, and one old  American ship. With these he held undisputed sway over his insular  domains, and carried on intercourse with the chiefs or governors whom he  had placed in command of the several islands.    The situation of this group of islands, far in the bosom of the  vast Pacific, and their abundant fertility, render them important  stopping-places on the highway to China, or to the northwest coast  of America. Here the vessels engaged in the fur trade touched to make  repairs and procure provisions; and here they often sheltered themselves  during the winters that occurred in their long coasting expeditions.    The British navigators were, from the first, aware of the value of these  islands to the purposes of commerce; and Tamaahmaah, not long after  he had attained the sovereign sway, was persuaded by Vancouver, the  celebrated discoverer, to acknowledge, on behalf of himself, and  subjects, allegiance to the king of Great Britain. The reader cannot but  call to mind the visit which the royal family and court of the Sandwich  Islands was, in late years, induced to make to the court of St. James;  and the serio-comic ceremonials and mock parade which attended that  singular travesty of monarchal style.    It was a part of the wide and comprehensive plan of Mr. Astor to  establish a friendly intercourse between these islands and his intended  colony, which might, for a time, have occasion to draw supplies thence;  and he even had a vague idea of, some time or other, getting possession  of one of their islands as a rendezvous for his ships, and a link in the  chain of his commercial establishments.    On the evening of the 12th of February, the Tonquin anchored in the bay  of Karakakooa, in the island of Owyhee. The surrounding shores were wild  and broken, with overhanging cliffs and precipices of black volcanic  rock. Beyond these, however, the country was fertile and well  cultivated, with inclosures of yams, plantains, sweet potatoes,  sugar-canes, and other productions of warm climates and teeming soils;  and the numerous habitations of the natives were pleasantly sheltered  beneath clumps of cocoanut and bread-fruit trees, which afforded both  food and shade. This mingled variety of garden and grove swept gradually  up the sides of the mountains, until succeeded by dense forests, which  in turn gave place to naked and craggy rocks, until the summits rose  into the regions of perpetual snow.    The royal residence of Tamaahmaah was at this time at another island  named Woahoo. The island of Owyhee was under the command of one of his  eris, or chiefs, who resided at the village of Tocaigh, situated on a  different part of the coast from the bay of Karakakooa.    On the morning after her arrival, the ship was surrounded by canoes and  pirogues, filled with the islanders of both sexes, bringing off supplies  of fruits and vegetables, bananas, plantains, watermelons, yams,  cabbages and taro. The captain was desirous, however, of purchasing a  number of hogs, but there were none to be had--The trade in pork was a  royal monopoly, and no subject of the great Tamaahmaah dared to meddle  with it. Such provisions as they could furnish, however, were brought  by the natives in abundance, and a lively intercourse was kept up during  the day, in which the women mingled in the kindest manner.    The islanders are a comely race, of a copper complexion. The men are  tall and well made, with forms indicating strength and activity; the  women with regular and occasionally handsome features, and a lascivious  expression, characteristic of their temperament. Their style of dress  was nearly the same as in the days of Captain Cook. The men wore the  maro, a band one foot in width and several feet in length, swathed round  the loins, and formed of tappa, or cloth of bark; the kihei, or mantle,  about six feet square, tied in a knot over one shoulder, passed under  the opposite arm, so as to leave it bare, and falling in graceful folds  before and behind, to the knee, so as to bear some resemblance to a  Roman toga.    The female dress consisted of the pau, a garment formed of a piece  of tappa, several yards in length and one in width, wrapped round the  waist, and reaching like a petticoat, to the knees. Over this kihei, or  mantle, larger than that of the men, sometimes worn over both shoulders,  like a shawl, sometimes over one only. These mantles were seldom worn  by either sex during the heat of the day, when the exposure of their  persons was at first very revolting to a civilized eye.    Towards evening several of the partners and clerks went on shore,  where they were well received and hospitably entertained. A dance was  performed for their amusement, in which nineteen young women and one man  figured very gracefully, singing in concert, and moving to the cadence  of their song.    All this, however, was nothing to the purpose in the eyes of Captain  Thorn, who, being disappointed in his hope of obtaining a supply of  pork, or finding good water, was anxious to be off. This it was not so  easy to effect. The passengers, once on shore, were disposed, as usual,  to profit by the occasion. The partners had many inquiries to make  relative to the island, with a view to business; while the young clerks  were delighted with the charms and graces of the dancing damsels.    To add to their gratifications, an old man offered to conduct them to  the spot where Captain Cook was massacred. The proposition was eagerly  accepted, and all hands set out on a pilgrimage to the place. The  veteran islander performed his promise faithfully, and pointed out  the very spot where the unfortunate discoverer fell. The rocks and  cocoa-trees around bore record of the fact, in the marks of the balls  fired from the boats upon the savages. The pilgrims gathered round  the old man, and drew from him all the particulars he had to relate  respecting this memorable event; while the honest captain stood by and  bit his nails with impatience. To add to his vexation, they employed  themselves in knocking off pieces of the rocks, and cutting off the bark  of the trees marked by the balls, which they conveyed back to the ship  as precious relics.    Right glad, therefore, was he to get them and their treasures fairly on  board, when he made sail from this unprofitable place, and steered  for the Bay of Tocaigh, the residence of the chief or governor of the  island, where he hoped to be more successful in obtaining supplies. On  coming to anchor the captain went on shore, accompanied by Mr. M'Dougal  and Mr. M'Kay, and paid a visit to the governor. This dignitary proved  to be an old sailor, by the name of John Young; who, after being tossed  about the seas like another Sinbad, had, by one of the whimsical freaks  of fortune, been elevated to the government of a savage island. He  received his visitors with more hearty familiarity than personages in  his high station are apt to indulge, but soon gave them to understand  that provisions were scanty at Tocaigh, and that there was no good  water, no rain having fallen in the neighborhood in three years.    The captain was immediately for breaking up the conference and  departing, but the partners were not so willing to part with the  nautical governor, who seemed disposed to be extremely communicative,  and from whom they might be able to procure some useful information. A  long conversation accordingly ensued, in the course of which they  made many inquiries about the affairs of the islands, their natural  productions, and the possibility of turning them to advantage in the way  of trade;"]]]
