IV.    _Laws of Motion, common to every Being of Nature.--Attraction and  Repulsion.--Inert Force.--Necessity._      Man is never surprised at those effects, of which he thinks he knows the  cause; he believes he does know the cause, as soon as he sees them act  in an uniform and determinate manner, or when the motion excited is  simple: the descent of a stone, that falls by its own peculiar weight,  is an object of contemplation to the philosopher only; to whom the mode  by which the most immediate causes act, and the most simple motion, are  no less impenetrable mysteries than the most complex motion, and the  manner by which the most complicated causes give impulse. The uninformed  are seldom tempted either to examine the effects which are familiar to  them, or to recur to first principles. They think they see nothing in  the descent of a stone, which ought to elicit their surprise, or become  the object of their research: it requires a NEWTON to feel that the  descent of heavy bodies is a phenomenon, worthy his whole, his most  serious attention; it requires the sagacity of a profound experimental  philosopher, to discover the laws by which heavy bodies fall, by which  they communicate to others their peculiar motion. In short, the mind  that is most practised in philosophical observation, has frequently the  chagrin to find, that the most simple and most common effects escape all  his researches, and remain inexplicable to him.    When any extraordinary, any unusual, effect is produced, to which our  eyes have not been accustomed; or when we are ignorant of the energies  of the cause, the action of which so forcibly strikes our senses, we  are tempted to meditate upon it, and take it into our consideration.  The European, accustomed to the use of GUNPOWDER, passes it by, without  thinking much of its extraordinary energies; the workman, who labours to  manufacture it, finds nothing marvellous in its properties, because he  daily handles the matter that forms its composition. The American, to  whom this powder was a stranger, who had never beheld its operation,  looked upon it as a divine power, and its energies as supernatural. The  uninformed, who are ignorant of the true cause of THUNDER, contemplate  it as the instrument of divine vengeance. The experimental philosopher  considers it as the effect of the electric matter, which, nevertheless,  is itself a cause which he is very far from perfectly understanding.--It  required the keen, the penetrating mind of a FRANKLIN, to throw light  on the nature of this subtle fluid--to develop the means by which  its effects might be rendered harmless--to turn to useful purposes, a  phenomenon that made the ignorant tremble--that filled their minds with  terror, their hearts with dismay, as indicating the anger of the gods:  impressed with this idea, they prostrated themselves, they sacrificed to  JUPITER, to deprecate his wrath.    Be this as it may, whenever we see a cause act, we look upon its effect  as natural: when this cause becomes familiar to the sight, when we are  accustomed to it, we think we understand it, and its effects surprise  us no longer. Whenever any unusual effect is perceived, without our  discovering the cause, the mind sets to work, becomes uneasy; this  uneasiness increases in proportion to its extent: as soon as it is  believed to threaten our preservation, we become completely agitated; we  seek after the cause with an earnestness proportioned to our alarm;  our perplexity augments in a ratio equivalent to the persuasion we are  under: how essentially requisite it is, we should become acquainted with  the cause that has affected us in so lively a manner. As it frequently  happens that our senses can teach us nothing respecting this cause  which so deeply interests us--which we seek with so much ardour, we have  recourse to our imagination; this, disturbed with alarm, enervated by  fear, becomes a suspicious, a fallacious guide: we create chimeras,  fictitious causes, to whom we give the credit, to whom we ascribe the  honour of those phenomena by which we have been so much alarmed. It is  to this disposition of the human mind that must be attributed, as will  be seen in the sequel, the religious errors of man, who, despairing of  the capacity to trace the natural causes of those perplexing phenomena  to which he was the witness, and sometimes the victim, created in his  brain (heated with terror) imaginary causes, which have become to him a  source of the most extravagant folly.    In Nature, however, there can be only natural causes and effects; all  motion excited in this Nature, follows constant and necessary laws: the  natural operations, to the knowledge of which we are competent, of which  we are in a capacity to judge, are of themselves sufficient to enable us  to discover those which elude our sight; we can at least judge of them  by analogy. If we study Nature with attention, the modes of action which  she displays to our senses will teach us not to be disconcerted by those  which she refuses to discover. Those causes which are the most remote  from their effects, unquestionably act by intermediate causes; by the  aid of these, we can frequently trace out the first. If in the chain of  these causes we sometimes meet with obstacles that oppose themselves  to our research, we ought to endeavour by patience and diligence to  overcome them; when it so happens we cannot surmount the difficulties  that occur, we still are never justified in concluding the chain to be  broken, or that the cause which acts is SUPER-NATURAL. Let us, then, be  content with an honest avowal, that Nature contains resources of which  we are ignorant; but never let us substitute phantoms, fictions, or  imaginary causes, senseless terms, for those causes which escape our  research; because, by such means we only confirm ourselves in ignorance,  impede our enquiries, and obstinately remain in error.    In spite of our ignorance with respect to the meanderings of Nature,  (for of the essence of being, of their properties, their elements, their  combinations, their proportions, we yet know the simple and general  laws, according to which bodies move;) we see clearly, that some of  these laws, common to all beings, never contradict themselves; although,  on some occasions, they appear to vary, we are frequently competent to  discover that the cause becoming complex, from combination with other  causes, either impedes or prevents its mode of action being such as  in its primitive state we had a right to expect. We know that active,  igneous matter, applied to gunpowder, must necessarily cause it to  explode: whenever this effect does not follow the combination of the  igneous matter with the gunpowder--whenever our senses do not give us  evidence of the fact, we are justified in concluding, either that the  powder is damp, or that it is united with some other substance that  counteracts its explosion. We know that all the actions of man have a  tendency to render him happy: whenever, therefore, we see him labouring  to injure or destroy himself, it is just to infer that he is moved by  some cause opposed to his natural tendency; that he is deceived by some  prejudice; that, for want of experience, he is blind to consequences:  that he does not see whither his actions will lead him.    If the motion excited in beings was always simple; if their actions did  not blend and combine with each other, it would be easy to know, and we  should be assured, in the first instance, of the effect a cause would  produce. I know that a stone, when descending, ought to describe a  perpendicular: I also know, that if it encounters any other body which  changes its course, it is obliged to take an oblique direction, but if  its fall be interrupted by several contrary powers, which act upon it  alternately, I am no longer competent to determine what line it will  describe. It may be a parabola, an ellipsis, spiral, circular, &c. this  will depend on the impulse, it receives, and the powers by which it is  impelled.    The most complex motion, however, is never more than the result of  simple motion combined: therefore as soon as we know the general laws of  beings and their action, we have only to decompose, to analyse them, in  order to discover those of which they are combined; experience teaches  us the effects we are to expect. Thus it is clear, the simplest motion  causes that necessary junction of different matter, of which all bodies  are composed: that matter, varied in its essence, in its properties,  in its combinations, has each its several modes of action or motion,  peculiar to itself; the whole motion of a body is consequently the sum  total of each particular motion that is combined.    Amongst the matter we behold, some is constantly disposed to unite,  whilst other is incapable of union; that which is suitable to unite,  forms combinations, more or less intimate, possessing more or less  durability: that is to say, with more or less capacity to preserve their  union, to resist dissolution. Those bodies which are called SOLIDS,  receive into their composition a great number of homogeneous, similar,  and analogous particles, disposed to unite themselves with energies  conspiring or tending to the same point. The primitive beings, or  elements of bodies, have need of supports, of props; that is to say, of  the presence of each other, for the purpose of preserving themselves;  of acquiring consistence or solidity: a truth, which applies with equal  uniformity to what is called _physical_, as to what is termed _moral_.    It is upon this disposition in matter and bodies, with relation to each  other, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8910"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 2 (#10)"],[1,"of folly, into  the most delirious acts of madness, to render them propitious to their  views; thus, for want of being acquainted with the reality of things,  their worship frequently degenerated into the most cruel extravagance,  into the most ridiculous folly.    Thus it is obvious, that every thing proves nature and its various  parts to have every where been the first divinities of man.  Natural philosophers studied these deities, either superficially or  profoundly,--explained some of their properties, detailed some of their  modes of action. Poets painted them to the imagination of mortals,  either in the most fascinating colours, or under the most  hideous deformities; embodied them--furnished them with reasoning  faculties--recounted their exploits--recorded their will. The statuary  executed sometimes with the most enrapturing art, the ideas of the  poets,--gave substance to their shadows--form to their airy nothings.  The priest decorated these united works with a thousand marvellous  qualities--with the most terrible passions--with the most inconceivable  attributes; gave them, \"a local habitation and a name.\" The people  adored them; prostrated themselves before these gods, who were neither  susceptible of love or hatred, goodness, or malice; they became  persecuting, malevolent, cruel, unjust, in order to render themselves  acceptable to powers generally described to them under the most odious  features.    By dint of reasoning upon these emblems, by meditating upon nature,  thus decorated, or rather disfigured, subsequent speculators no longer  recollected the source from whence their predecessors had drawn their  gods, nor the fantastic ornaments with which they had embellished  them. Natural philosophers and poets were transformed by leisure into  metaphysicians and theologians; tired with contemplating what they could  have understood, they believed they had made an important discovery  by subtilly distinguishing nature from herself--from her own peculiar  energies--from her faculty of action. By degrees they made an  incomprehensible being of this energy, which as before they personified,  this they called the mover of nature, divided it into two, one congenial  to man's happiness, the other inimical to his welfare; these they  deified in the same manner as they had before done nature with her  various parts. These abstract, metaphysical beings, became the  sole object of their thoughts; were the subject of their continual  contemplation; they looked upon them as realities of the highest  importance: thus nature quite disappeared; she was despoiled of her  rights; she was considered as nothing more than an unwieldy mass,  destitute of power; devoid of energy, as an heap of ignoble matter  purely passive: who, incapable of acting by herself, was not competent  to any of the operations they beheld, without the direct, the immediate  agency of the moving powers they had associated with her: which they had  made the fulcrum necessary to the action of the lever. They either did  not or would not perceive, that the _great Cause of causes, ens entium,  Parent of parents_, had, in unravelling chaotic matter, with a wisdom  for which man can never be sufficiently grateful, with a sagacity  which he can never sufficiently admire, foreseen every thing that could  contribute not only to his own individual happiness, but also to that of  all the beings in nature; that he had given this nature immutable laws,  according to which she is for ever regulated; after which she is obliged  invariably to act; that he has described for her an eternal course, from  which it is not permitted her to deviate, even for an instant; that she  is therefore, rendered competent to the production of every phenomena,  not only that he beholds, but of an infinity that he has never yet  contemplated; that she needs not any exterior energy for this purpose,  having received her powers from a hand far superior to any the feeble  weak imagination of man is able to form; that when this nature appears  to afflict him, it is only from the contraction of his own views, from  the narrowness of his own ideas, that he judges; that, in fact, what he  considers the evils of nature, are the greatest possible benefits he  can receive, if he was but in a condition to be acquainted with previous  causes, with subsequent effects. That the evils resulting to him from  his own vices, have equally their remedies in this nature, which it  is his duty to study; which if he does he will find, that the same  omnipotent goodness, who gave her irrefragable laws, also planted in her  bosom, balsams for all his maladies, whether physical or moral: but that  it is not given him to know what this great, this universal cause  is, for purposes of which he ought not to dispute the wisdom, when he  contemplates the mighty wonders that surround him.    Thus man ever preferred an unknown power, to that of which he was  enabled to have some knowledge, if he had only deigned to consult  his experience; but he presently ceases to respect that which he  understands; to estimate those objects which are familiar to him: he  figures to himself something marvellous in every thing he does not  comprehend; his mind, above all, labours to seize upon that which  appears to escape his consideration; in default of experience, he no  longer consults any thing, but his imagination, which feeds him  with chimeras. In consequence, those speculators who have subtilly  distinguished nature from her own powers, have successively laboured  to clothe the powers thus separated with, a thousand incomprehensible  qualities: as they did not see this power, which is only a mode, they  made it a spirit--an intelligence--an incorporeal being; that is to say,  of a substance totally different from every thing of which we have a  knowledge. They never perceived that all their inventions, that all the  words which they imagined, only served to mask their real ignorance;  that all their pretended science was limited to saying, in what manner  nature acted, by a thousand subterfuges which they themselves found  it impossible to comprehend. Man always deceives himself for want of  studying nature; he leads himself astray, every time he is disposed to  go out of it; he is always quickly necessitated to return; he is even  in error when he substitutes words which he does not himself understand,  for things which he would much better comprehend if he was willing to  look at them without prejudice.    Can a theologian ingenuously believe himself more enlightened, for  having substituted the vague words spirit, incorporeal substance, &c. to  the more intelligible terms nature, matter, mobility, necessity? However  this may be, these obscure words once imagined, it was necessary to  attach ideas to them; in doing this, he has not been able to draw them  from any other source than the beings of this despised nature, which are  ever the only beings of which he is enabled to have any knowledge. Man,  consequently, drew them up in himself; his own soul served for the model  of the universal soul, of which indeed according to some it only formed  a portion; his own mind was the standard of the mind that regulated  nature; his own passions, his own desires, were the prototypes of those  by which he actuated this being; his own intelligence was that from  which he formed that of the mover of nature; that which was suitable  to himself, he called the order of nature; this pretended order was the  scale by which he measured the wisdom of this being; in short, those  qualities which he calls perfections in himself, were the archetypes  in miniature, of the perfections of the being, he thus gratuitously  supposed to be the agent, who operated the phenomena of nature. It  was thus, that in despite of all their efforts, the theologians  were, perhaps always will be, true Anthropomorphites. A sect of this  denomination appeared in 359, in Egypt, they held the doctrine that  their god had a bodily shape. Indeed it is very difficult, if not  impossible to prevent man from making himself the sole model of his  divinity. Montaigne says \"man is not able to be other than he is, nor  imagine but after his capacity; let him take what pains he may, he will  never have a knowledge of any soul but his own.\" Xenophanes said, \"if  the ox or the elephant understood either sculpture or painting, they  would not fail to represent the divinity under their own peculiar figure  that in this, they would have as much reason as Polyclitus or Phidias,  who gave him the human form.\" It was said to a very celebrated man that  \"God made man after his own image;\" \"man has returned the compliment,\"  replied the philosopher. Indeed, man generally sees in his God, nothing  but a man. Let him subtilize as he will, let him extend his own powers  as he may, let him swell his own perfections to the utmost, he will have  done nothing more than make a gigantic, exaggerated man, whom he will  render illusory by dint of heaping together incompatible qualities. He  will never see in such a god, but a being of the human species, in whom  he will strive to aggrandize the proportions, until he has formed a  being totally inconceivable. It is according to these dispositions that  he attributes intelligence, wisdom, goodness, justice, science, power,  to his divinity, because he is himself intelligent; because he has the  idea of wisdom in some beings of his own species; because he loves to  find in them ideas favourable to himself: because he esteems those  who display equity; because he has a knowledge, which he holds more  extensive in some individuals than himself; in short, because he enjoys  certain faculties which depend on his own organization. He presently  extends or exaggerates all these qualities in forming his god; the sight  of the phenomena of nature, which he feels he is himself incapable  of either producing or imitating, obliges him to"]]]
