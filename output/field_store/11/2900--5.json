We do have similar laws saying how  much a bushel of potatoes shall weigh, how much a barrel of flour  shall weigh. That isn't fixing the price; it is only fixing a uniform  size so that the public may not be cheated in its dealings, and one  must not take such a law as justifying the fixing of prices.    In the year 1266 I find the first statute in the French language,  Norman French; before that they were all in Latin; and they lasted in  French for some four or five hundred years, and then they were put in  English. The Statute of Marlborough, 1267, is a very important one  historically, but it does not concern us, because it mainly had to  do with the ownership of land, the tenure of land in England, an  extremely important subject, but one that is obsolete here. Then we  have something about the trial of clerks for murder. Of course the  word clerk there means not what we mean by a clerk, but a person who  could read and write; and nothing more than that. It originally meant  persons in holy orders, who were called clerks (clerics), but there  got to be clerks who were not in holy orders. Originally only priests  could read and write. No one else knew how, except possibly great  personages like kings, and consequently it was the same thing whether,  when you said a clerk, you meant a person who could read and write or  a priest. But when there got to be people who could read and write and  who were not priests, it became an important distinction. There was  a privilege in England known as the \"benefit of the clergy\"; if any  clerk was tried for a criminal offence, no matter what, all he had to  do was to state that he was a priest and he was at once set free. In  other words, he could not be punished. That doesn't concern us; but, I  suppose, it resulted from the old notion that all priests were subject  only to Rome, and to the church courts, and not to the civil law  courts; and consequently when a priest was attempted to be tried in a  civil law court, it was a way of doing what we should call \"pleading  to the jurisdiction\" of the court. Later, as time went on, in England  it was greatly abused, especially when there got to be clerks who  were not priests. When it meant anybody who could read and write, and  anybody who had committed a murder had only to say, \"I can read and  write,\" and be set free, it led to an extraordinary state of things.  So, from time to time, they modified the benefit of the clergy, until  ultimately it was abolished entirely; first by not allowing it in high  offences like murder; then by imposing certain slight punishment--they  were \"burned in the hand\"; then by applying it only to the first  offence, and so on, until they got rid of it entirely; and this  Statute of Marlborough is simply one of the first of that long chain  of statutes which finally did away with it and prevented people from  getting rid of a criminal prosecution merely because they knew how to  read and write or were priests.    In 1275 I note the first use of the word parliament. I have used it  from the beginning, but it is important to remember that the thing  was not _called_ parliament until 1275. Before that it was called  the Great Council or the King's Council, and in Saxon times the  Witenagemot.    Then we come down to the Statute of Westminster I. That is considered  a great landmark in statutory legislation mainly because it is the  first attempt to establish a code, or, at least, a large collection of  the laws of England. It is an attempt to put what they supposed to be  a good part of them into writing. We have no codes in this country,  as a rule; nor to-day in England; the ordinary Anglo-Saxon does  not believe in codes. It is the French and Germans who have codes.  Nevertheless, you often find collections of statutes. It is important  not to confound these things with codes, because they never pretend to  be complete. Many States in this country never make revision of the  statutes. Nevertheless, every ten or twenty years they will print a  collection of the statutes arranged alphabetically. In some States, as  in Massachusetts, those collections are official; but in other  States they are simply matters of private enterprise. They are of no  authority, and if they are wrong it is no protection to you. You are  bound to know the laws. These early so-called codes, especially this  code of Edward I, although it caused him to be called the English  Justinian, because it was the first attempt of putting any large  body of the Anglo-Saxon laws in writing at all, are still not at all  _codes_ in the technical sense. This one was merely a collection of a  certain number of laws reduced to writing and re-enacted by Edward I.  We note here the phrase \"common right shall be done to rich and poor,\"  rather an interesting landmark; it shows what progress was being made  by the people in establishing their rights as freemen and to equal  laws. For the laws of Norman England mainly applied to land-owners,  and were made by the barons, the only people that had property; there  was but a small class in those early days between the land-owners and  actual serfs, villeins, who were practically attached to the soil,  in a condition almost of servitude; they did service, were not paid  wages, and couldn't leave the place where they were born--and both  these are tests of slavery. But in the first two centuries after the  Conquest the number of freemen very rapidly increased; men who were  not property owners, not land-owners, but still freemen. Especially  it increased in the towns, for the towns very early established their  right to be free, far earlier than the country. It was very early  established that the citizens of any town, that is, the members of  the guild of the town, duly admitted to the guild, were freemen, and  probably before this statute. But this is interesting as a recognition  of the fact that there were free poor people--people without property,  who nevertheless were neither villeins nor serfs--and that they were  entitled to equality before the law, just as we are to-day, as early  as 1275. Otherwise, the Statute of Westminster concerns mainly the  criminal law. There is one very important provision--because it has  been historically followed from then down to now--that there shall  be no disturbance of the elections. Elections shall be free and  unimpeded, uncontrolled by any power, either by the crown, or  Parliament, or any trespasser. That has been a great principle of  English freedom ever since, and passed into our unwritten constitution  over here, and of course has been re-enacted in many of our laws. That  is the feeling which lay behind those statutes which we enacted after  our slaves were freed, for the making of elections free in the  South; for protecting negroes in the act of voting and preventing  interference with them by the Ku Klux Klan. The Democratic party  strongly objected and objects still to such legislation on the part of  the government, on the ground that the right of regulating elections  belongs to the States and not to the Federal government; which,  constitutionally speaking, before the Fifteenth Amendment at least,  was true. They do not, of course, deny this great old English  principle that elections must be free and must not be intimidated or  controlled by anybody; but, they say, we left the machinery of the  elections in the hands of the States when we adopted the Federal  Constitution; and although at our State elections some of the officers  elected are Federal officers--as, for instance, the President of the  United States, or rather the presidential electors, and members of  Congress--nevertheless, when we adopted the Federal Constitution, the  founders chose to rely for the machinery of a fair and free election  upon the officers of States; so that the Federal government has  nothing to do with it, and has no business to send Federal troops to  the South; and they called such bills the \"force\" bill. In theory, of  course, those elections were controlled in these bills just as much in  the North as in the South; but there being practically no complaint in  the North that the negroes were not allowed to vote, as a matter of  fact the strength of the Federal government was only invoked in the  Southern States.    \"Fines are to be reasonable.\" You find that principle in all our  constitutions to-day in the clause that there shall be no cruel or  unusual punishments, and that fines shall be proportionate to the  offence; this principle is expressed also in Magna Charta.    Then slander and rape were made criminal at common law; before this  only the church took jurisdiction. Slander Is the imputing of crime to  a person by speech, by word of mouth. If it be a written imputation,  it is libel and not slander. Then in this statute also we find the  first import tax upon wool. The constitutionality of revenue taxes,  duties, or taxes on imports, was once disputed by our parties; one  party denying the constitutional right to impose any tax upon imports  except for the strict purpose of raising necessary revenue; the  argument being perfectly logical and based upon the constitutional  principle we already have had that all taxation must be for the common  benefit. Democrats argued that if a tax upon imports was imposed to  raise the necessary revenue, that is for the common benefit; but if it  was imposed, as it avowedly is imposed in Republican legislation, for  the purpose of benefiting certain industries or classes, why that,  of course, is not for the common or general benefit and therefore  unconstitutional. The trouble with this position is that early English  laws were prohibitive of imports--that is, they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12238"],[0,"Science in the Kitchen (#11)"],[1,"les, which are almost wholly composed of  waste substances. Prof. Paule Bernard, of Paris, found that dogs fed  upon meat extracts died sooner than those which received only water.\"    FOOD COMBINATIONS.--Some persons, especially those of weak  digestive powers, often experience inconvenience in the use of certain  foods, owing to their improper combinations with other articles. Many  foods which are digested easily when partaken of alone or in harmonious  combinations, create much disturbance when eaten at the same meal with  several different articles of food, or with some particular article with  which they are especially incompatible. The following food combinations  are among the best, the relative excellence of each being indicated by  the order in which they are named: Milk and grains; grains and eggs;  grains and vegetables or meats; grains and fruits.    Persons with sound stomachs and vigorous digestion will seldom  experience inconvenience in making use of other and more varied  combinations, but dyspeptics and persons troubled with slow digestion  will find it to their advantage to select from the bill of fare such  articles as best accord with each other, and to avoid such combinations  as fruits and vegetables, milk and vegetables, milk and meats, sugar and  milk, meat or vegetables, fats with fruits, meats, or vegetables, or  cooked with grains.          TABLE TOPICS.        Now good digestion waits on appetite, and health on      both--_Shakespeare._        We live not upon what we eat, but upon what we digest.--_Abernethy._        If we consider the amount of ill temper, despondency, and general      unhappiness which arises from want of proper digestion and      assimilation of our food, it seems obviously well worth while to put      forth every effort, and undergo any sacrifice, for the purpose of      avoiding indigestion, with its resulting bodily ills; and yet year      after year, from the cradle to the grave, we go on violating the      plainest and simplest laws of health at the temptation of Cooks,      caterers, and confectioners, whose share in shortening the average      term of human life is probably nearly equal to that of the combined      armies and navies of the world.--_Richardson._        Almost every human malady is connected, either by highway or byway,      with the stomach.--_Sir Francis Head._        It is a well-established fact that a leg of mutton caused a      revolution in the affairs of Europe. Just before the battle of      Leipsic, Napoleon the Great insisted on dining on boiled mutton,      although his physicians warned him that it would disagree with him.      The emperor's brain resented the liberty taken with its colleague,      the stomach; the monarch's equilibrium was overturned, the battle      lost, and a new page opened in history.--_Sel._        Galloping consumption at the dinner table is one of the national      disorders.--_Sel._        The kitchen (that is, your stomach) being out of order, the garret      (the head) cannot be right, and every room in the house becomes      affected. Remedy the evil in the kitchen, and all will be right in      parlor and chamber. If you put improper food into the stomach, you      play the mischief with it, and with the whole machine      besides.--_Abernethy._        Cattle know when to go home from grazing, but a foolish man never      knows his stomachs measures.--_Scandinavian proverb._        Enough is as good as a feast.        Simplicity of diet is the characteristic of the dwellers in the      Orient. According to Niebuhr, the sheik of the desert wants only a      dish of pillau, or boiled rice, which he eats without fork or spoon.      Notwithstanding their frugal fare, these sons of the desert are      among the most hearty and enduring of all members of the human      family. A traveler tells of seeing one of them run up to the top of      the tallest pyramid and back in six minutes.        One fourth of what we eat keeps us, and the other three fourths we      keep at the peril of our lives.--_Abernethy._          COOKERY.    It is not enough that good and proper food material be provided; it must  have such preparation as will increase and not diminish its alimentary  value. The unwholesomeness of food is quite as often due to bad cookery  as to improper selection of material. Proper cookery renders good food  material more digestible. When scientifically done, cooking changes each  of the food elements, with the exception of fats, in much the same  manner as do the digestive juices, and at the same time it breaks up the  food by dissolving the soluble portions, so that its elements are more  readily acted upon by the digestive fluids. Cookery, however, often  fails to attain the desired end; and the best material is rendered  useless and unwholesome by a improper preparation.    It is rare to find a table, some portion of the food upon which is not  rendered unwholesome either by improper preparatory treatment, or by the  addition of some deleterious substance. This is doubtless due to the  fact that the preparation of food being such a commonplace matter, its  important relations to health, mind, and body have been overlooked, and  it has been regarded as a menial service which might be undertaken with  little or no preparation, and without attention to matters other than  those which relate to the pleasure of the eye and the palate. With taste  only as a criterion, it is so easy to disguise the results of careless  and improper cookery of food by the use of flavors and condiments, as  well as to palm off upon the digestive organs all sorts of inferior  material, that poor cookery has come to be the rule rather than the  exception.    Another reason for this prevalence of bad cookery, is to be found in the  fact that in so many homes the cooking is intrusted to an ignorant class  of persons having no knowledge whatever of the scientific principles  involved in this most important and practical of arts. An ethical  problem which we have been unable to solve is the fact that women who  would never think of trusting the care of their fine china and  bric-a-brac to unskilled hands, unhesitatingly intrust to persons who  are almost wholly untrained, the preparation of their daily food. There  is no department of life where superior intelligence is more needed than  in the selection and preparation of food, upon which so largely depend  the health and physical welfare of the family circle.    The evils of bad cookery and ill-selected food are manifold, so many, in  fact, that it has been calculated that they far exceed the mischief  arising from the use of strong drink; indeed, one of the evils of  unwholesome food is its decided tendency to create a craving for  intoxicants. Bad cookery causes indigestion, indigestion causes thirst,  and thirst perpetuates drunkenness. Any one who has suffered from a fit  of indigestion, and can recollect the accompanying headache and the  lowness of spirits, varying in degree from dejection or ill-humor to the  most extreme melancholy, until the intellectual faculties seemed dazed,  and the moral feelings blunted, will hardly wonder that when such a  condition becomes chronic, as is often the case from the use of  improperly prepared food, the victim is easily led to resort to  stimulants to drown depression and enliven the spirits.    A thorough practical knowledge of simple, wholesome cookery ought to  form a part of the education of every young woman, whatever her station  in life. No position in life is more responsible than that of the person  who arranges the bills of fare and selects the food for the household;  and what higher mission can one conceive than to intelligently prepare  the wherewithal to make shoulders strong to bear life's burdens and  heads clear to solve its intricate problems? what worthier work than to  help in the building up of bodies into pure temples fit for guests of  noble thoughts and high purposes? Surely, no one should undertake such  important work without a knowledge of the principles involved.      THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENTIFIC COOKERY.    Cookery is the art of preparing food for the table by dressing, or by  the application of heat in some manner.    FUELS.--Artificial heat is commonly produced by combustion, caused  by the chemical action of the oxygen of the air upon the hydrogen and  carbon found in fuel. The different fuels in common use for cooking  purposes are hard wood, soft wood, charcoal, anthracite coal, bituminous  coal, coke, lignite, kerosene oil, gasoline, and gas. As to their  respective values, much depends upon the purpose for which they are to  be used. Wood charcoal produces a greater amount of heat than an equal  weight of any other fuel. Soft wood burns quicker and gives a more  intense heat than hard wood, and hence is best for a quick fire. Hard  wood burns slowly, produces a larger mass of coals, and is best where  long-continued heat is desired. Anthracite coal kindles slowly, and  burns with little flame or smoke, but its vapor is sulphurous, and on  that account it should never be burned in an open stove, nor in one with  an imperfect draft. Its heat is steady and intense. Bituminous coal  ignites readily, burns with considerable flame and smoke, and gives a  much less intense heat than anthracite, Lignite, or brown coal, is much  less valuable as fuel. Coke is useful when a short, quick fire is  needed. Kerosene and gas are convenient and economical fuels.    MAKING FIRES.--If coal is the fuel to be used, first clean out the  stove by shaking the grate and removing all ashes and cinders. Remove  the stove covers, and brush the soot and ashes out of all the flues and  draft holes into the fire-box. Place a large handful of shavings or  loosely twisted or crumpled papers upon the grate, over which lay some  fine pieces of dry kindling-wood, arranged crosswise to permit a free  draft, then a few sticks "]]]
