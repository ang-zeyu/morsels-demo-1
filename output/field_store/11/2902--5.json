We must not overlook the immense opportunity for suggestion in the work of  psychoanalysis, both on the subject and the one who is in the work. The  Freudians vehemently deny that any of the results of dream analysis are  suggested into the mind of the dreamer, but the evidences are all on the  other side.  Freud, in referring to psychoanalysis of hysterical patients,  says, \"It is not possible to press upon the patient things which he  apparently does not know, or to influence the results of the analysis by  exciting his expectations.\" Such an attitude is fatal when it comes to a  question of accurate work. And no less important is the self-suggestion  practiced by the Freudians.  When we read of Freud's long struggle in an  attempt to find something which he felt surely was to be found, we see that  he had abundant opportunity to acquire almost an obsession. The long years  since, which he has spent in analyzing dreams and making them all come out  right some way, would serve to more firmly ground his conviction, and the  same is true of his disciples. Put a man to drawing square moons for ten  years, and at the end of the time he will swear that the moon is square.    A large portion of the scientific world seems to have gone mad over the term  \"psychoanalysis.\"  But this kind of work has been done by all peoples and  times under different names.  There can be no objection to such an analysis  of a dream if it is done by the right person. The dream may be used to aid  the dreamer in finding out his own life, it is true, and when we understand  psychoanalysis as this process, and only this, it is not objectionable.  But  if such is the case there is no need of all the mechanism and symbolism. The  preacher who uses the Old Testament stories of the wars with the Philistines  to illustrate a moral struggle is not to be criticised; but if he maintains  that they were written for that purpose, we should hardly feel inclined to  accept his position. A very inspiring message might be builded on the text,  \"The ants are a people not strong, but they prepare their meat in the  summer\"; but it is hardly possible that such thoughts were in the mind of  the writer. Just so, a dream or a story or any other situation may be used  to open the locked doors of a life, but to say that the dream has slipped  stealthily out of the keyholes and over the transoms and wonderfully,  mysteriously and magically clothed itself is quite another matter.        FREUD AND HIS SCHOOL    NEW PATHS OF PSYCHOLOGY    BY A. W. VAN RENTERGHEM M.D., AMSTERDAM    (Concluded)    WE are frequently confronted with the question: \"Just why does an erotic  conflict cause the neurosis? Why not just as well another conflict?\"  To  this the only answer is, \"No one asserts that this must be so, but evidently  it always is so, in spite of anything that can be said against it. It is,  notwithstanding all assurances to the contrary, still true that love (taken  in its large sense of nature's course, which does not mean sexuality alone),  with its problems and its conflicts of the most inclusive significance, has  in human life and in the regulation of the human lot a much greater  importance than the individual can image.    The trauma-theory (meaning what was in the beginning conceived by Breuer and  Freud) is therefore out of date.  When Freud came to the opinion that a  hidden erotic conflict forms the real root of the neurosis, the trauma lost  its pathogenic significance.    An entirely different light was now thrown upon the theory. The trauma  question was solved, and thrown aside. Next in order came the study of the  question of the erotic conflict. If we consider this in the light of the  chosen example, we see that this conflict contains plenty of abnormal  moments, and at first sight does not suffer comparison with an ordinary  erotic conflict. What is especially striking, seemingly almost unbelievable,  is the fact that it is only the exterior action, the pose, of which the  patient is conscious, while she remains unconscious of the passion which  governs her.  In the case in question the actual sexual factor  unquestionably remains hidden, while the field of consciousness is entirely  governed by the patient's pose. A proposition formulating this state of  affairs would read as follows.    In the neurosis there are two erotic inclinations which stand in a fixed  antithesis to each other, and one of these at least is unconscious.    It might be said of this formula, that although perhaps it is adapted to  this case, possibly it is not adapted to all cases. Most people, however,  are inclined to believe that the erotic is not so widespread.  It is granted  that it is so in a romance, but it is not believed that the most affecting  dramas are more often enacted in the heart of the citizen who daily passes  us by unnoticed, than upon the stage.    The neurosis is an unsuccessful attempt of the individual to solve in his  own bosom the sexual question which perplexes the whole of human society.  The neurosis is a disunity in one's inmost self. The cause of this inward  strife is because in most men the consciousness would gladly hold to its  moral ideal, but the subconsciousness strives toward its (in the present-day  meaning) immoral ideal.  This the consciousness always wants to deny. These  are the sort of people who would like to be more respectable than they are  at bottom.  But the conflict may be reversed; there are people who  apparently are very disreputable, and who do not take the slightest pains to  limit their sexual pleasures. But looked at from all sides this is only a  sinful attitude, adopted, God knows for what grounds, because in them, back  of this, there is a soul, which is kept just as much in the subconsciousness  as the immoral nature is kept in the subconscious of moral men. (It is best  for men to avoid extremes as far as possible, because extremes make us  suspect the contrary.)    This general explanation was necessary in order to explain to some extent  the conception of the erotic conflict in analytical psychology. It is the  turning-point of the entire conception of the neurosis.    After Breuer's discovery, putting into practice the \"chimney sweeping\" so  justly christened by his patient this method of treatment has evolved into  shorter psychoanalytical methods, which we will now discuss in succession in  their main points.    In his use of the primitive method, Freud depended upon the time saving of  hypnotism and upon the circumstance that many could not be brought into the  desired deep degree of provoked sleep. The aim of this operation was to call  up in the patient another state of consciousness, in which it would be  possible for him to remember facts which had given cause for the origin of  the phenomena, facts which thus far had remained hidden from the ordinary  daily consciousness. By questioning the patient when in this state, or by  spontaneous production of phantasies communicated by the patient while in  hypnosis, memories come to light and affects connected with them are relaxed  (these are abreagirt [rearranged], as the expression is) and the desired  cure is attained.  This just-mentioned method (cathartic, cleansing) and  more especially the modified one, which aims especially at the promotion of  a spontaneous production of phantasies communicated by the patient while  under hypnotism, is still used in practice by some investigators.  In what  follows we go still further back--Freud next sought for a method to render  hypnotism unnecessary.  He discovered it by applying an artifice which he  had seen Bernheim use during a visit (1887) to the latter's clinic at Nancy.  Bernheim demonstrated upon a hypnotized patient how the amnesia of the  somnambulist is only an appearance.    With this aim in view, Freud from then on ceased to hypnotize his patients  and substituted for that method, \"spontaneous ideas.\" This means that when  the analysis of a patient who is awake is obstructed, and has come to a dead  stop, he is told to communicate anything which comes into his mind, no  matter what idea, what thought, even if the thing were very queer to him or  seemed meaningless. In the material thus obtained the thread should be found  leading to the semi-forgotten, the thing hidden in the consciousness. In  single cases--where the resistance toward bringing into consciousness the  forgotten or repressed thing, the complex, was slight--this method of  treatment very quickly attains its end, but in others where the resistance  was greater, the spontaneous ideas merely brought about indirect  representations, mere allusions as it were to the forgotten element.  Here  favorable results either were not so readily obtained, or else were entirely  lacking. In conjunction with this, Freud planned a simple method of  interpretation by means of which, from the material thus obtained, the  repressed complexes could be brought to consciousness.    Independently of Freud, the Zurich school (Bleuler, Jung) had planned the  association method in order to penetrate into the patient's  subconsciousness. The value of this method is chiefly a theoretical  experimental one; it leads to an orientation of large circumference, but  necessarily superficial in regard to the subconscious conflict (complex).    Freud compares its importance for the psychoanalyticus; with the importance  of the qualitative analysis for the chemist.    Not being completely satisfied with his method of spontaneous ideas Freud  sought shorter paths to the subconscious, and therefore undertook the study  of the dream-life (dealing with forgetfulness, speaking to one's self,  making mistakes, giving offense to one's self, and with superstition and  absent-mindedness, and the study of word quibbles taken in their widest  sense), to all of which we are indebted for the possession of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12261"],[0,"Balder the Beautiful, Volume I. (#11)"],[1," discover how to cure his impotence; and while he  is closeted with the wizard, they fetch another man, who finishes the  ceremony with the young wife, in order that the relish may be given out  and that people may rub their feet with it. But if it happens that when  a girl comes to maturity she is not yet betrothed to any man, and  therefore has no husband to go to, the matrons tell her that she must go  to a lover instead. And this is the custom which they call _chigango_.  So in the evening she takes her cooking pot and relish and hies away to  the quarters of the young bachelors, and they very civilly sleep  somewhere else that night. And in the morning the girl goes back to the  _kuka_ hut.[73]    [Abstinence from salt associated with a rule of chastity in many  tribes.]    From the foregoing account it appears that among these tribes no sooner  has a girl attained to womanhood than she is expected and indeed  required to give proof of her newly acquired powers by cohabiting with a  man, whether her husband or another. And the abstinence from salt during  the girl's seclusion is all the more remarkable because as soon as the  seclusion is over she has to use salt for a particular purpose, to which  the people evidently attach very great importance, since in the event of  her husband proving impotent she is even compelled, apparently, to  commit adultery in order that the salted relish may be given out as  usual. In this connexion it deserves to be noted that among the Wagogo  of German East Africa women at their monthly periods may not sleep with  their husbands and may not put salt in food.[74] A similar rule is  observed by the Nyanja-speaking tribes of Central Angoniland, with whose  puberty customs we are here concerned. Among them, we are told, \"some  superstition exists with regard to the use of salt. A woman during her  monthly sickness must on no account put salt into any food she is  cooking, lest she give her husband or children a disease called _tsempo_  (_chitsoko soko_) but calls a child to put it in, or, as the song goes,  '_Natira nichere ni bondo chifukwa n'kupanda mwana_' and pours in the  salt by placing it on her knee, because there is no child handy. Should  a party of villagers have gone to make salt, all sexual intercourse is  forbidden among the people of the village, until the people who have  gone to make the salt (from grass) return. When they do come back, they  must make their entry into the village at night, and no one must see  them. Then one of the elders of the village sleeps with his wife. She  then cooks some relish, into which she puts some of the salt. This  relish is handed round to the people who went to make the salt, who rub  it on their feet and under their armpits.\"[75] Hence it would seem that  in the mind of these people abstinence from salt is somehow associated  with the idea of chastity. The same association meets us in the customs  of many peoples in various parts of the world. For example, ancient  Hindoo ritual prescribed that for three nights after a husband had  brought his bride home, the two should sleep on the ground, remain  chaste, and eat no salt.[76] Among the Baganda, when a man was making a  net, he had to refrain from eating salt and meat and from living with  his wife; these restrictions he observed until the net took its first  catch of fish. Similarly, so long as a fisherman's nets or traps were in  the water, he must live apart from his wife, and neither he nor she nor  their children might eat salt or meat.[77] Evidence of the same sort  could be multiplied,[78] but without going into it further we may say  that for some reason which is not obvious to us primitive man connects  salt with the intercourse of the sexes and therefore forbids the use of  that condiment in a variety of circumstances in which he deems  continence necessary or desirable. As there is nothing which the savage  regards as a greater bar between the sexes than the state of  menstruation, he naturally prohibits the use of salt to women and girls  at their monthly periods.    [Seclusion of girls at puberty among the tribes about Lake Nyassa and on  the Zambesi.]    With the Awa-nkonde, a tribe at the northern end of Lake Nyassa, it is a  rule that after her first menstruation a girl must be kept apart, with a  few companions of her own sex, in a darkened house. The floor is covered  with dry banana leaves, but no fire may be lit in the house, which is  called \"the house of the Awasungu,\" that is, \"of maidens who have no  hearts.\"[79] When a girl reaches puberty, the Wafiomi of Eastern Africa  hold a festival at which they make a noise with a peculiar kind of  rattle. After that the girl remains for a year in the large common hut  (_tembe_), where she occupies a special compartment screened off from  the men's quarters. She may not cut her hair or touch food, but is fed  by other women. At night, however, she quits the hut and dances with  young men.[80] Among the Barotse or Marotse of the upper Zambesi, \"when  a girl arrives at the age of puberty she is sent into the fields, where  a hut is constructed far from the village. There, with two or three  companions, she spends a month, returning home late and starting before  dawn in order not to be seen by the men. The women of the village visit  her, bringing food and honey, and singing and dancing to amuse her. At  the end of a month her husband comes and fetches her. It is only after  this ceremony that women have the right to smear themselves with  ochre.\"[81] We may suspect that the chief reason why the girl during her  seclusion may visit her home only by night is a fear, not so much lest  she should be seen by men, as that she might be seen by the sun. Among  the Wafiomi, as we have just learned, the young woman in similar  circumstances is even free to dance with men, provided always that the  dance is danced at night. The ceremonies among the Barotse or Marotse  are somewhat more elaborate for a girl of the royal family. She is shut  up for three months in a place which is kept secret from the public;  only the women of her family know where it is. There she sits alone in  the darkness of the hut, waited on by female slaves, who are strictly  forbidden to speak and may communicate with her and with each other only  by signs. During all this time, though she does nothing, she eats much,  and when at last she comes forth, her appearance is quite changed, so  fat has she grown. She is then led by night to the river and bathed in  presence of all the women of the village. Next day she flaunts before  the public in her gayest attire, her head bedecked with ornaments and  her face mottled with red paint. So everybody knows what has  happened.[82]    [Seclusion of girls at puberty among the Thonga on Delagoa Bay.]    Among the northern clans of the Thonga tribe, in South-Eastern Africa,  about Delagoa Bay, when a girl thinks that the time of her nubility is  near, she chooses an adoptive mother, perhaps in a neighbouring village.  When the symptoms appear, she flies away from her own village and  repairs to that of her adopted mother \"to weep near her.\" After that she  is secluded with several other girls in the same condition for a month.  They are shut up in a hut, and whenever they come outside they must wear  a dirty greasy cloth over their faces as a veil. Every morning they are  led to a pool and plunged in the water up to their necks. Initiated  girls or women accompany them, singing obscene songs and driving away  with sticks any man who meets them; for no man may see a girl during  this time of seclusion. If he saw her, it is said that he would be  struck blind. On their return from the river, the girls are again  imprisoned in the hut, where they remain wet and shivering, for they may  not go near the fire to warm themselves. During their seclusion they  listen to lascivious songs sung by grown women and are instructed in  sexual matters. At the end of the month the adoptive mother brings the  girl home to her true mother and presents her with a pot of beer.[83]    [Seclusion of girls at puberty among the Caffre tribes of South Africa.]    Among the Caffre tribes of South Africa the period of a girl's seclusion  at puberty varies with the rank of her father. If he is a rich man, it  may last twelve days; if he is a chief, it may last twenty-four  days.[84] And when it is over, the girl rubs herself over with red  earth, and strews finely powdered red earth on the ground, before she  leaves the hut where she has been shut up. Finally, though she was  forbidden to drink milk all the days of her separation, she washes out  her mouth with milk, and is from that moment regarded as a full-grown  woman.[85] Afterwards, in the dusk of the evening, she carries away all  the objects with which she came into contact in the hut during her  seclusion and buries them secretly in a sequestered spot.[86] When the  girl is a chief's daughter the ceremonies at her liberation from the hut  are more elaborate than usual. She is led forth from the hut by a son of  her father's councillor, who, wearing the wings of a blue crane, the  badge of bravery, on his head, escorts her to the cattle kraal, where  cows are slaughtered and dancing takes place. Large skins full of milk  are sent to the spot from neighbouring villages; and after the dances  are over the girl drinks milk for the first time since the day she  entered into retreat. But the first mouthful is drunk by the girl's aunt  or other female relative who had charge of her during her seclusion; and  a little of it is poured on the fire-place.[87] Amongst the Zulus, when  the girl was a princess royal, the end of her time of separation was  celebrated by a sort of saturnalia: law and order were for the time  being in abeyance: every man, woman, and child might appropriate any  article of property: the king abstained from interfering; and if during  this reign of misrule he was"]]]
