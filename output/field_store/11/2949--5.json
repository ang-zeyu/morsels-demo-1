MARSHMALLOW FUDGE    [Illustration: MARSHMALLOW FUDGE.]        1st BATCH        2 cups of granulated sugar,      1 cup of cream,      1/4 a teaspoonful of salt,      1 tablespoonful of butter,      2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla,      Nearly half a pound of marshmallows, split in halves.        2nd BATCH        2 cups of granulated sugar,      1 cup of cream,      1/4 a teaspoonful of salt,      1 tablespoonful of butter,      2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla.    Start with the first batch and when this is nearly boiled enough, set  the second batch to cook, preparing it in the same manner as the first.  Stir the sugar and cream, over a rather slack fire, until the sugar is  melted, when the sugar boils wash down the sides of the pan as in making  fondant, set in the thermometer and cook over a quick fire, without  stirring, to the soft ball degree, 236 deg. F.; add the butter, salt and  chocolate, melted or shaved fine, and let boil up vigorously, then  remove to a cake cooler (or two spoon handles to allow a circulation of  air below the pan). In the meantime the second batch should be cooking  and the marshmallows be gotten ready. When the first batch is about cold  add the vanilla and beat the candy vigorously until it begins to  thicken, then turn it into a pan lined with waxed paper. At once dispose  the halves of marshmallows close together upon the top of the fudge.  Soon the other dish of fudge will be ready; set it into cold water and  when nearly cold, add the vanilla and beat as in the first batch, then  pour it over the marshmallows. When the whole is about cold turn it onto  a marble, or hardwood board, pull off the paper and cut into cubes. If  one is able to work very quickly, but one batch need be prepared, half  of it being spread over the marshmallows.      CHOCOLATE DIPPED FRUIT FUDGE    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE DIPPED FRUIT FUDGE.]        FRUIT FUDGE        1-1/2 cups of granulated sugar,      1 cup of Maple Syrup,      1-1/2 cups of glucose (pure corn syrup),      1/2 a cup of thick cream, or      1/3 a cup of milk and 1/4 a cup of butter,      3/4 a cup of fruit, figs, and candied cherries and apricots, cut in          small pieces.        CHOCOLATE FOR DIPPING        1/2 a cake or more of Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.    Stir the sugar, syrup, glucose and cream until the sugar is melted,  cover and let boil three or four minutes, then uncover and let boil  stirring often but very gently until a soft ball may be formed in cold  water, or, until the thermometer registers 236 deg. F. Set the saucepan on a  cake cooler and when the mixture becomes cool, add the fruit and beat  until it becomes thick, then turn into pans lined with waxed paper. In  about fifteen minutes cut into squares. Coat these with the \"Dot\"  Chocolate.      CHOCOLATE COCOANUT CAKES    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE COCOANUT CAKES.]        2/3 a cup of granulated sugar,      1/4 a cup scant measure of water,      One cup, less one tablespoonful, of glucose,      1/2 a pound of dessicated cocoanut,      1/2 a pound or Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.    Heat the sugar, water and glucose to the boiling point, add the cocoanut  and stir constantly while cooking to the soft ball degree, or, until a  little of the candy dropped on a cold marble may be rolled into a ball.  Drop, by small teaspoonfuls, onto a marble or waxed paper, to make  small, thick, rather uneven rounds. When cold coat with \"Dot\" Chocolate  melted over hot water and cooled properly. These cakes are very easily  coated.      BAKER'S CHOCOLATE \"DIVINITY\"    [Illustration: BAKER'S CHOCOLATE \"DIVINITY.\"]        1-1/2 cups of brown sugar,      1 cup of maple syrup,      1/2 a cup of glucose pure corn syrup,      1/2 a cup of water,      1/4 a teaspoonful of salt,      The whites of 2 eggs,      1 cup of nut meats, chopped fine,      2 squares of Baker's Chocolate, broken in pieces.    Let the sugar, syrup, glucose and water stand on the back of the range,  stirring occasionally, until the sugar is melted, then cover and let  boil five minutes. Remove the cover and let boil to soft crack, 287 deg. F.,  or, until when tested in water a ball that rattles in the cup will be  formed. Add the salt and chocolate and beat over the fire, until the  chocolate is melted, then pour in a fine stream onto the whites of eggs,  beaten dry, beating constantly meanwhile; add the nuts and pour into a  pan lined with waxed paper. In about fifteen minutes lift the candy from  the pan (by the ends of the paper left for the purpose) and cut it into  small oblongs or squares. The candy must be stirred constantly during  the last of the cooking. In cooking without a thermometer one is liable  to remove the candy from the fire too soon--if this happens, return, egg  whites and all, to the saucepan, set this into a dish of boiling water  and stir constantly until the mixture thickens, then pour into the pan  lined with paper. On no account let even a few drops of water boil into  the candy.      CHOCOLATE NOUGATINES    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE NOUGATINES.]        1 cup of granulated sugar,      1/2 a cup of glucose,      1/2 a cup of honey (strained),      Piece of paraffine size of a pea,      1/4 a cup of water,      1/4 a teaspoonful of salt,      The whites of 2 eggs, beaten dry,      1 cup of almond or English walnut meats, chopped fine,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla,      About 1/2 a pound of Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.    Put the sugar, glucose, honey, paraffine and water over the fire, stir  occasionally and let boil to the hard ball degree, about 248 deg. F. Add the  salt to the eggs before beating them, and gradually pour on part of the  syrup, beating constantly meanwhile with the egg beater; return the rest  of the syrup to the fire and let boil until it is brittle when tested in  cold water or to 290 deg. F. Then turn this gradually onto the eggs, beating  constantly meanwhile. Return the whole to the saucepan, set over the  fire on an asbestos mat and beat constantly until it becomes crisp when  tested in cold water. Pour into a buttered pan a little larger than an  ordinary bread pan and set aside to become cold. When cold cut into  pieces about an inch and a quarter long and three-eighths of an inch  wide and thick. Coat these with \"Dot\" Chocolate.      PLAIN CHOCOLATE CARAMELS    [Illustration: PLAIN CHOCOLATE CARAMELS.]        2-1/2 cups of sugar,      3/4 cup of glucose, (pure corn syrup),      1/2 a cup of butter,      1/8 a teaspoonful of cream of tartar,      2-1/2 cups of whole milk, (not skimmed),      2-1/2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract.    Put the sugar, glucose, butter, cream of tartar and one cup of the milk  over the fire, stir constantly, and when the mass has boiled a few  moments, gradually stir in the rest of the milk. Do not let the mixture  stop boiling while the milk is being added. Stir every few moments and  cook to 248 deg. F., or, until when tested in cold water, a hard ball may be  formed; add the chocolate and vanilla and beat them thoroughly through  the candy, then turn it into two bread pans. When nearly cold cut into  squares.      CHOCOLATE NUT CARAMELS    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE NUT CARAMELS.]        2 cups of granulated sugar,      1-1/2 cups of glucose (pure corn syrup),      2 cups of cream,      1 cup of butter,      3 or 4 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      1-1/2 cups of English walnut meats,      2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla extract.    Put the sugar, glucose, _one_ cup of the cream and the butter over the  fire; stir and cook until the mixture boils vigorously, then gradually  add the other cup of cream. Do not allow the mixture to stop boiling  while the cream is being added. Cook until the thermometer registers  250 deg. F., stirring gently--move the thermometer, to stir beneath  it--every four or five minutes. Without a thermometer boil until--when  tested by dropping a little in cold water--a hard ball may be formed in  the water. Remove from the fire, add the chocolate and nuts and beat  until the chocolate is melted; beat in the vanilla and turn into a  biscuit pan, nicely oiled or buttered, to make a sheet three-fourths an  inch thick. When nearly cold turn from the pan and cut into cubes.      RIBBON CARAMELS    [Illustration: RIBBON CARAMELS.]        CHOCOLATE LAYERS        1-1/4 cups of granulated sugar,      1/2 cup of glucose (pure corn syrup) _scant_ measure,      1/4 a cup of butter,      1/16 a teaspoonful of cream of tartar,      1-1/4 cups of rich milk,      1-1/4 squares of Baker's Premium Chocolate,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract.        WHITE LAYER        2/3 a cup of granulated sugar,      1/4 (scant) a cup of water,      1 cup, less one tablespoonful, of glucose (pure corn syrup),      1/3 a pound of dessicated cocoanut.    Put the sugar, glucose, butter, cream of tartar and the fourth a cup of  milk over the fire, stir until the mixture boils, then very gradually  stir in the rest of the milk. Let cook, stirring occasionally, to 248 deg.  F., or until, when tested in water or on a cold marble, a pretty firm  ball may be formed. Add the chocolate and vanilla, mix thoroughly and  turn into two well-buttered shallow pans. For the white layer, put the  sugar, water and glucose over the fire, stir until boiling, then add the  cocoanut and stir occasionally until a soft ball may be formed when a  little of the mixture is dropped upon a cold marble. Put this mixture  over the fire, to dissolve the sugar, but do not let it begin to boil  until the chocolate layers are turned into the pans. When the white  mixture is ready, turn enough of it onto one of the chocolate layers to  make a layer about one-third an inch thick.

An experienced salesman who had lost his  <p 98>  position because of the San Francisco fire  applied to the sales manager for a position.  He was informed that there were fifteen applicants  for the Ohio territory, but that the  place would be given to him because of his  better record. The manager laid out an  initial territory in one corner and ordered the  salesman to work it first.    Working this territory, the salesman secured  substantial orders, but refrained from  ``over-selling'' any customer, gave considerable  time to missionary work and to cultivating  the acquaintance of buyers. His campaign  was planned less for immediate results  than for the future and for the effect on the  larger field of the state. Having no instructions  as to pushing his wider campaign, in  about sixty days he asked for instructions.  In answer he was ordered home and discharged  on the ground that business was dull and that  he had been a loss to the house. During the  sixty days he had been working on a losing  commission basis with the expectation of  taking his profits later. Investigation dis-  <p 99>  closed that he was but one of five salesmen to  whom the Ohio territory had been assigned  simultaneously. Of the five, one other also  had made good and had been retained because  he could be secured for less money.    This multiple try-out policy is entirely  fair when the applicants know the conditions.  But to lead each applicant to believe that he  has been engaged subject only to his ability  to make good is manifestly unjust. The facts  are bound to come out sooner or later and  create distrust among all employees of the  house. Loyalty is strictly reciprocal. If an  employee feels that he has no assurance of  fair treatment, his attitude towards the firm  is sure to be negative. Even the man who  secures the position will recognize the firm's  lack of candor and will never give his employers  the full measure of co<o:>peration which produces  maximum efficiency.    The ``square deal,'' indeed, is the indispensable  basis of loyalty and efficiency in an  organization. The spirit as well as the letter  of the bargain must be observed, else the work-  <p 100>  men will contrive to even up matters by loafing,  by slighting the work, or by a minimum production.  This means a loss of possible daily  earnings. On the other hand, employees never  fail to recognize and in time respect the executive  who holds the balance of loyalty and justice  level between them and the business.    Fair wages, reasonable hours, working quarters  and conditions of average comfort and  healthfulness, ordinary precautions against  accidents, and continuous employment are  all now regarded as primary requirements  and are not sufficient to create loyalty in the  men. More than this must be done.    The chief executive should create such a  spirit that his officers shall turn to him for  help when in perplexity or difficulty. The  superintendent and officers or bosses should  sustain this same sympathetic relationship  toward their men that the executive has toward  his officers. A reputation for taking care of  his men is a thing to be sought in a chief  executive as well as in all underofficers.    Personal relationships should be cultivated.  <p 101>  In some large organizations the chief executive  may secure this personal touch with individuals  through an agent or through a department  known as the department of ``promotion and  discharge,'' ``employment,'' or ``labor.'' In  others, occasional meetings on a level of equality  may be brought about through house picnics,  entertainments, vacation camps, and so  on, where employer and employee meet each  other outside their usual business environment.    It is not worth while to attempt to develop  loyalty to the house until there has been  developed a loyalty to the personalities  representing the house. Loyalty in business is  in the main a reciprocal relationship. The  way to begin it is for the chief to be loyal to  his subordinates and to see to it that all officers  are loyal to their inferiors. When loyalty  from above has been secured, loyalty from the  ranks may readily be developed.    The personality of the worker must be  respected by the employer. ``Giving a man  a chance'' to develop himself, allowing him  <p 102>  to express his individuality, is the surest way  of enlisting the interest and loyalty of a  creative man.    To identify the interests of employees with  the interests of the house, various plans of  profit sharing, sale of stock to employees,  pensions, insurance against sickness and accident,  and so on, have been successfully applied  by many companies.    So far as possible, responsibility for the  success of the house should be assumed by  all employees. In some way the workmen  should feel that they are in partnership with  the executives. We easily develop loyalty  for the cause for which we have taken responsibility  or rendered a service.    _Creating Loyalty to Firm itself by Educational  Campaign_    A perpetual campaign of publicity should be  maintained for the benefit of every man in the  employ of the house. In this there should be  a truthful but emphatic presentation of acts  of loyalty on the part of either employers or  <p 103>  workmen. Everything connected with the  firm which has human interest should be included  in this history. This educational campaign  should change the loyalty to the _*men_  in the firm into loyalty to the _*firm_ itself. It  should be an attempt to give the firm a personality,  and of such a noble character that it  would win the loyalty of the men. This could  be accomplished at little expense and with  great profit.        CHAPTER V    CONCENTRATION    AS A MEANS OF INCREASING HUMAN EFFICIENCY    THE owner of one of the largest and most  complex businesses in America handles  his day's work on a schedule as exacting  as a railway time-table. In no other way  could he keep in touch with and administer  the manifold activities of his industry and a  score of allied interests--buying of the day's  raw materials for a dozen plants in half as  many markets, direction of an organization  exceeding 20,000 men, selling and delivering  a multitude of products in a field as wide as  three continents, financing the whole tremendous  fabric.    Every department of his business, therefore,  has its hour or quarter hour in the daily program  when its big problems are considered  <p 104>  <p 105>  and settled on the tick of the clock. This  schedule is flexible, since no two days bring  from any division of production, distribution,  or financing the same demands upon the owner's  attention. Yet each keeps its place and  comes invariably under his eye--through  reports and his own mastery of conditions  affecting the department.    _To secure the high personal efficiency required  for this oversight and methodical dispatch of  affairs, the owner-executive is not only protected  from outside interruptions and distractions, but is  also guarded against intrusion of the vital  elements of his business--both men and matters  --except at the moment most advantageous for  dealing with them_.    Analysis and organization have determined  these moments--just as they have eliminated  every non-essential in the things presented  for consideration and decision. Except when  emergencies arise there is no departure from  the rule: ``One thing at a time--the big  thing--at the right time.'' The task in hand  is never cheated, or allowed to cheat the next  <p 106>  in line. Management is as much a continuous  process, organized and wasteproof, as the  journey of raw materials through his plants.    This is an illustration of remarkable individual  efficiency attained by concentration  --the power of the human mind which seems  inseparable from any great achievement in  business, in politics, in the arts, in education.  Through it men of moderate capacities have  secured results apparently beyond the reach  of genius. And in no field has this power of  concentration been displayed more vividly by  leaders or been more generally lacking in the  rank and file than in business. Analysis of  the conditions may suggest the reason and the  remedy.    _The modern business man is exhausted no  more by his actual achievements than by the  things which he is compelled to resist doing_.    Appeals for his attention are ceaseless.  The roar of the street, the ring of telephone  bells, the din of typewriting machines, the  sight of a row of men waiting for an interview,  the muffled voices from neighboring offices or  <p 107>  workers, the plan for the day's work which is  being delayed, the anxiety for the results for  certain endeavors, suspicion as to the loyalty  of employees--these and a score of other distractions  are constantly bombarding him.    Every appeal for attention demands expenditure  of energy--to ignore it and hold  the mind down to the business in hand. The  simple life with its single appeal is not for the  business man. For him life is complex and  strenuous. To overcome distractions and focus  his mind on one thing is a large part of his  task. If this single thing alone appealed to  his attention, the effort would be pleasing and  effective. It is not the work that is hard; the  strain comes in keeping other things at bay  while completing the pressing duty.    _He is exhausted, not because of his achievements,  but because of the expenditure of energy  in resisting distractions_.    He is inefficient, not through lack of industry,  but from lack of opportunity or of ability  to concentrate his energy upon the single task  at hand.  <p 108>    All sources of illumination--from the candle  to the sun--send out rays of light equally  in all directions.
