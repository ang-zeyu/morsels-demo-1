He used to say,  \"Beloved is man, for he was created in the image (of God); but it was  by a special love that it was made known to him that he was created in  the image of God, as it is said, 'For in the image of God made he man'  (52).  Beloved are Israel, or they were called children of the  All-present, but it was by a special love that it was made known to  them that they were called children of the All-present, as it is said,  'Ye are children unto the Lord your God' (53).  Beloved are Israel,  for unto them was given the desirable instrument (54); but it was by a  special love that it was made known to them that that desirable  instrument was theirs, through which the world was created, as it is  said, 'For I give you good doctrine; forsake ye not my _Torah_' (55).  19. Everything is foreseen, yet free will is given (56); and the world  is judged by grace, yet all is according to the amount of the work\"  (57).  20. He used to say, \"Everything is given on pledge (58), and a  net is spread for all living (59); the shop is open (60); the dealer  gives credit; the ledger lies open; the hand writes; and whosoever  wishes to borrow may come and borrow; but the collectors regularly  make their daily round, and exact payment from man whether he be  content or not (61); and they have that whereon they can rely in their  demand; and the judgment is a judgment of truth (62); and everything  is prepared for the feast\" (63).          (47) Akiba ben Joseph (born about 50 C.E., died about 132) was        the greatest of the _Tannaim_ (teachers mentioned in the        _Mishnah_).  He was a \"proselyte of righteousness\" (_ger        tzedek_).  Until middle age, he remained illiterate and averse        to study, but was spurred on to become learned in the _Torah_        by the daughter of the rich Kalba Shabua, whom he subsequently        married.  He was the pupil of R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanos, R.        Jochanan ben Chanania, and Nahum of Gimzo.  He espoused the        cause of Bar Kochba, acknowledging him as the Messiah, and is        said to have travelled throughout the land stirring up        opposition to Rome.  At the fall of Betar, he was captured by        the Romans, and most cruelly put to death, expiring with the        _Shema_ upon his lips.  R. Akiba definitely fixed the canon of        the Old Testament.  He compiled and systematized the        traditional law, in this respect being the forerunner of R.        Judah ha-Nasi (see chapter II, n. 1), whose _Mishnah_ may be        considered as being derived from that of the school of Akiba.        His importance may be gauged by the following statement from        the _Talmud_, \"Our _Mishnah_ comes directly from R. Meir (a        disciple of Akiba), the _Tosefta_ from R. Nehemiah, the        _Sifra_ from R. Judah, and the _Sifre_ from R. Simon; but they        all took Akiba for a model in their works and followed him\"        (_Sanhedrin_, 86a).  Akiba introduced a new method of        interpreting Scripture, in which not a word, syllable, or        letter was considered superfluous, finding thereby a basis for        many oral laws.  His hermeneutical and exegetical activities        were remarkable.  Many interesting legends have clustered        around his name.  See Bacher, _ibid._, 271-348; Meilziner,        _Introduction to the Talmud_, pp. 29, 125-126; Isaacs,        _Stories from the Rabbis_, p. 61 _et seq.;_  Danziger,        _ibid._, pp. 152-184; the _Jewish Encyclopedia_, arts. _Akiba        ben Joseph_ and _Akiba ben Joseph in Legend;_ Myers, _Story of        the Jewish People_, pp. 171-188; and Geiger, _Judaism and its        History_, p. 226 _et seq._, 230 _et seq._          (48) _Massorah_, from root _masar_, \"to deliver,\" \"hand over,\"        \"transmit,\" means a \"chain of tradition.\"  It is used to        designate tradition in general, and is thus correlative with        _kabbalah_.  The _Massorah_ contains information for the        correct transcription of the Scripture.  As used here, it        means the traditional interpretation of the _Torah_.  Cf.        chapter I, 1, \"Moses received the _Torah_ on Sinai, and handed        it down (_umsarah_) to Joshua,\" and \"make a fence around the        _Torah_.\"  Consult Driver, _Notes on Samuel_, _Intro._, p. 37        _et seq._; Schurer, _ibid._, II, i, 328; Taylor, _Sayings_, p.        55, n. 33; Friedlander _ibid._, p. 55, 203, 266; _Jewish        Encyclopedia s.v.;_ and _The Companion Bible_ (London, Oxford        University Press), Pt.

(56) The omniscience and prescience of God do not deprive men        of free will.  Maimonides explains this in the last chapter of        the _Shemonah Perakim_ (ed. Gorfinkle, p. 85 _et seq._).          (57) Maimonides interprets the last phrase as meaning to do        many small deeds of charity rather than one great deed of        goodness.  For instance, it is better to distribute one        hundred coins among one hundred people than to give them all        to one person.          (58) The world is compared to the office of a merchant.          (59) Ecc. IX, 12: \"for man also knoweth not his time, like the        fishes that are caught in an evil net.\"          (60) The shop stands for the world and its enjoyments.          (61) Man has free will, and is therefore responsible for all        his acts.          (62) For everything is recorded.          (63) This world is merely a preparation for the next.  The        enjoyment of the world to come is likened by the Rabbis to a        banquet, which is shared in by the good and the bad, after        they have paid off their moral debts.    21. R. Eleazar, the son of Azariah (64), said, \"Where there is no  _Torah_, there are no manners; where there are no manners, there is no  _Torah_: where there is no wisdom, there is no fear of God; where  there is no fear of God, there is no wisdom: where there is no  knowledge, there no understanding; where there is no understanding,  there is no knowledge (65): where there is no meal, there is no  _Torah;_ where there is no _Torah_, there is no meal\" (66).  22. He  used to say, \"He whose wisdom exceeds his works, to what is he like?  To a tree whose branches are many, but whose roots are few; and the  wind comes and plucks it up, and overturns it upon its face, as it is  said, 'And he shall be like a lonely juniper tree in the desert, and  shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places  in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited' (67).  But he whose  works exceed his wisdom, to what is he like?  To a tree whose branches  are few, but whose roots are many, so that though all the winds in the  world come and blow upon it, they cannot stir it from its place, as it  is said, 'And he shall be as a tree planted by the waters; and that  spreadeth out its roots by the river and shall not perceive when heat  cometh, but his leaf shall be green; and shall not be troubled in the  year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit'\" (68).          (64) R. Eleazar ben Azariah, a Mishnaic scholar of the first        century, was of a rich and influential family, and was a        descendent of Ezra the Scribe.  At seventeen or eighteen, upon        the deposition of Gamaliel II, Eleazar, because of his        popularity and erudition, was chosen to fill the position of        the president of the academy at Jabneh.  Upon Gamaliel's        restoration, he was made vice-president (_Ab bet din_).  See        Bacher, _ibid._, 219-240.          (65) Cf. Prov. IX, 10: \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning        of wisdom, and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.\"          (66) Where there is a want of the means of sustenance there is        no studying of _Torah_, and without spiritual nourishment,        physical nourishment has no value.          (67) Jer. XVII, 6.          (68) Jer. XVII, 8.  Cf. verse 12, above.    23. R. Eleazar Chisma (69) said, \"The laws concerning the sacrifices  of birds and the purification of women are essential ordinances (70);  astronomy and geometry are the after-courses of wisdom\" (71).    Rabbi Chanania, the son of Akashia, said, \"The Holy One, blessed be  He, was pleased to make Israel worthy; wherefore He gave them a  copious _Torah_ and many commandments, as it is said, 'It pleased the  Lord, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify the _Torah_ and make it  honorable'\".          (69) A contemporary of AKiba.          (70) _Kinnim_, \"nests,\" is the name of a tract in _Seder        Kodashim_ of the _Mishnah_, and tells of the young birds,        which men and women were at times required to offer as        sacrifice.  _Niddah_ is a tract of _Seder Teharot_ of the        _Mishnah_, and relates of the uncleannesses of woman.          (71) _I.e._, the mathematical sciences, in which R. Eleazar        was very proficient, are only to be considered as helps to the        study of the essentials of _Torah_.                CHAPTER IV    All Israel have a portion in the world to come, and it is said, \"And  thy people shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for  ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be  glorified\".    1.

They laid waste the coast lands;  attacked the city of Bristol, but were beaten off by the citizens; landed  again further down in Somerset, and were defeated in a great battle by  Ednoth, who had been Harold's staller, where many were killed on both  sides, including Ednoth himself; and then returned with nothing gained  but such plunder as they succeeded in carrying off. The next year they  repeated the attempt in the same style, and were again defeated, even  more disastrously, this time by one of the newcomers, Brian of Britanny.  Such piratical descents were not dangerous to the Norman government, nor  was a rally to beat them off any test of English loyalty to William.    Even the historian, Orderic Vitalis, half English by descent and wholly  so by birth, but writing in Normandy for Normans and very favourable to  William, or possibly the even more Norman William of Poitiers, whom he  may have been following, was moved by the sufferings of the land under  these repeated invasions, revolts, and harryings, and notes at the close  of his account of this year how conquerors and conquered alike were  involved in the evils of war, famine, and pestilence. He adds that the  king, seeing the injuries which were inflicted on the country, gathered  together the soldiers who were serving him for pay, and sent them home  with rich rewards. We may regard this disbanding of his mercenary troops  as another sign that William considered his position secure.    In truth, however, the year which was coming on, 1069, was another year  of crisis in the history of the Conquest. The danger which had been  threatening William from the beginning was this year to descend upon him,  and to prove as unreal as all those he had faced since the great battle  with Harold. For a long time efforts had been making to induce some  foreign power to interfere in England and support the cause of the  English against the invader. Two states seemed especially fitted for the  mission, from close relationship with England in the past,--Scotland and  Denmark. Fugitives, who preferred exile to submission, had early sought  the one or the other of these courts, and urged intervention upon their  kings. Scotland had for the moment formally accepted the Conquest.  Denmark had not done so, and Denmark was the more directly interested in  the result, not perhaps as a mere question of the independence of  England, but for other possible reasons. If England was to be ruled by a  foreign king, should not that king on historical grounds be a Dane rather  than a Norman? Ought he not to be of the land that had already furnished  kings to England? And if Sweyn dreamed of the possibility of extending  his rule, at such a time, over this other member of the empire of his  uncle, Canute the Great, he is certainly not to be blamed.    It is true that the best moment for such an intervention had been allowed  to slip by, the time when no beginning of conquest had been made in the  north, but the situation was not even yet unfavourable. William was to  learn, when the new year had hardly begun, that he really held no more of  the north than his garrisons commanded. Perhaps it was a rash attempt to  try to establish a Norman earl of Northumberland in Durham before the  land had been overawed by his own presence; but the post was important,  the two experiments which had been made to secure the country through the  appointment of English earls had failed, and the submission of the  previous summer might prove to be real. In January Robert of Comines was  made earl, and with rash confidence, against the advice of the bishop, he  took possession of Durham with five hundred men or more. He expected, no  doubt, to be very soon behind the walls of a new castle, but he was  allowed no time. The very night of his arrival the enemy gathered and  massacred him and all his men but two. Yorkshire took courage at this and  cut up a Norman detachment. Then the exiles in Scotland believed the time  had come for another attempt, and Edgar, Gospatric, and the others, with  the men of Northumberland at their back, advanced to attack the castle in  York. This put all the work of the previous summer in danger, and at the  call of William Malet, who held the castle for him, the king advanced  rapidly to his aid, fell unexpectedly on the insurgents, and scattered  them with great slaughter. As a result the Norman hold on York was  tightened by the building of a second castle, but Northumberland was  still left to itself.    William may have thought, as he returned to celebrate Easter at  Winchester, that the north had learned a lesson that would be sufficient  for some time, but he must have heard soon after his arrival that the men  of Yorkshire had again attacked his castles, though they had been beaten  off without much difficulty. Nothing had been gained by any of these  attempts, but they must have been indications to any abroad who were  watching the situation, and to William as well, that an invasion of  England in that quarter might hope for much local assistance. It was  nearly the end of the summer before it came, and a summer that was on the  whole quiet, disturbed only by the second raid of Harold's sons in the  Bristol Channel.    Sweyn of Denmark had at last made up his mind, and had got ready an  expedition, a somewhat miscellaneous force apparently, \"sharked up\" from  all the Baltic lands, and not too numerous. His fleet sailed along the  shores of the North Sea and first appeared off south-western England. A  foolish attack on Dover was beaten off, and three other attempts to land  on the east coast, where the country was securely held, were easily  defeated. Finally, it would seem, off the Humber they fell in with some  ships bearing the English leaders from Scotland, who had been waiting for  them. There they landed and marched upon York, joined on the way by the  men of the country of all ranks. And the mere news of their approach, the  prospect of new horrors to be lived through with no chance of mitigating  them, proved too much for the old archbishop, Aldred, and he died a few  days before the storm broke. William was hunting in the forest of Dean,  on the southern borders of Wales, when he heard that the invaders had  landed, but his over-confident garrison in York reported that they could  hold out for a year without aid, and he left them for the present to  themselves. They planned to stand a siege, and in clearing a space about  the castle they kindled a fire which destroyed the most of the city,  including the cathedral church; but when the enemy appeared, they tried a  battle in the open, and were killed or captured to a man.    The fall of York gave a serious aspect to the case, and called for  William's presence. Soon after the capture of the city the Danes had gone  back to the Humber, to the upper end of the estuary apparently, and there  they succeeded in avoiding attack by crossing one river or another as the  army of the king approached. In the meantime, in various places along the  west of England, insurrections had broken out, encouraged probably by  exaggerated reports of the successes of the rebels in the north. Only one  of these, that in Staffordshire, required any attention from William, and  in this case we do not know why. In all the other cases, in Devon, in  Somerset, and at Shrewsbury, where the Welsh helped in the attack on the  Norman castle, the garrisons and men of the locality unassisted, or  assisted only by the forces of their neighbours, had defended themselves  with success. If the Danish invasion be regarded as a test of the  security of the Conquest in those parts of England which the Normans had  really occupied, then certainly it must be regarded as complete.    Prom the west William returned to the north with little delay, and  occupied York without opposition. Then followed the one act of the  Conquest which is condemned by friend and foe alike. When William had  first learned of the fate of his castles in York, he had burst out into  ungovernable rage, and the mood had not passed away. He was determined to  exact an awful vengeance for the repeated defiance of his power. War in  its mildest form in those days was little regulated by any consideration  for the conquered. From the point of view of a passionate soldier there  was some provocation in this case. Norman garrisons had been massacred;  detached parties had been cut off; repeated rebellion had followed every  pacification. Plainly a danger existed here, grave in itself and inviting  greater danger from abroad. Policy might dictate measures of unusual  severity, but policy did not call for what was done, and clearly in this  case the Conqueror gave way to a passion of rage which he usually held in  check, and inflicted on the stubborn province a punishment which the  standard of his own time did not justify.    Slowly he passed with his army through the country to the north of York,  drawing a broad band of desolation between that city and Durham.  Fugitives he sought out and put to the sword, but even so he was not  satisfied. Innocent and guilty were involved in indiscriminate slaughter.  Houses were destroyed, flocks and herds exterminated. Supplies of food  and farm implements were heaped together and burned. With deliberate  purpose, cruelly carried out, it was made impossible for men to live  through a thousand square miles. Years afterwards the country was still a  desert; it was generations before it had fully recovered. The Norman  writer, Orderic Vitalis, perhaps following the king's chaplain and  panegyrist William of Poitiers, while he confesses here that he gladly  praised the king when he could, had only condemnation for this deed. He  believed that William, responsible to no earthly tribunal, must one day  answer for it to an infinite Judge before whom high and low"]]]
