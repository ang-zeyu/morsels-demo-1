While this motor preparation is going on, the entire digestive  tract is inhibited.  It thus becomes clear why an emotion is more  harmful than action.    Any agency that can sufficiently inspire faith,--dispel worry,--  whether that agency be mystical, human, or divine, will at once  stop the body-wide stimulations and inhibitions which cause  lesions which are as truly physical as is a fracture.  The striking benefits of good luck, success, and happiness;  of a change of scene; of hunting and fishing; of optimistic  and helpful friends, are at once explained by this hypothesis.  One can also understand the difference between the broken body  and spirits of an animal in captivity and its buoyant return to its  normal condition when freed.    But time will not permit me to follow this tempting lead, which has  been introduced for another purpose--the proposal of a remedy.    Worries either are or are not groundless.  Of those that have  a basis, many are exaggerated.  It has occurred to me to utilize  as an antidote an appeal to the same great law that originally  excited the instinctive involuntary reaction known as fear--  the law of self-preservation.    I have found that if an intelligent patient who is suffering from  fear can be made to see so plainly as to become firmly convinced  that his brain, his various organs, indeed his whole being,  could be physically damaged by fear, that this same instinct of  self-preservation will, to the extent of his conviction, banish fear.  It is hurling a threatened active militant danger, whose injurious  influences are both certain and known, against an uncertain,  perhaps a fancied, one.  In other words, fear itself is an injury  which when recognized is instinctively avoided.  In a similar manner  anger may be softened or banished by an appeal to the stronger  self-preserving instinct aroused by the fear of physical damage,  such as the physical injury of brain-cells. This playing of one  primitive instinct against another is comparable to the effect  produced upon two men who are quarreling when a more powerful enemy  of both comes threateningly on the scene.    The acute fear of a surgical operation may be banished by the use  of certain drugs that depress the associational power of the brain and  so minimize the effect of the preparations that usually inspire fear.  If, in addition, the entire field of operation is blocked by local  anesthesia so that the associational centers are not awakened,  the patient will pass through the operation unscathed.    The phylogenetic origin of fear is injury, hence injury and fear cause  the same phenomena.  In their quality and in their phenomena psychic  shock and traumatic shock are the same.  The perception of danger  by the special senses in the sound of the opening gun of a battle,  or in the sight of a venomous snake, is phylogenetically the same  and causes the same effects upon the entire body as an operation under  anesthesia or a physical combat in that each drives the motor mechanism.  The use of local anesthetics in the operative field prevents  nerve-currents from the seat of injury from reaching the brain and there  integrating the entire body for a self-defensive struggle.  The result,  even though a part of the brain is asleep and the muscles paralyzed,  is the same as that produced by the interception of the terrifying  sound of the gun, or of the sight of the dangerous reptile,  since the stimulation of the motor mechanism is prevented.    By both the positive and the negative evidence we are forced  to believe that the emotions are primitive instinctive reactions  which represent ancestral acts; and that they therefore utilize  the complicated motor mechanism which has been developed by the forces  of evolution as that best adapted to fit the individual for his  struggle with his environment or for procreation.    The mechanism by which the motor acts are performed and the mechanism  by which the emotions are expressed are one and the same.  These acts in their infinite complexity are suggested by association--  phylogenetic association.  When our progenitors came in contact  with any exciting element in their environment, action ensued then  and there.  There was much action--little restraint or emotion.  Civilized man is really in auto-captivity. He is subjected  to innumerable stimulations, but custom and convention frequently  prevent physical action.  When these stimulations are sufficiently  strong but no action ensues, the reaction constitutes an emotion.  A phylogenetic fight is anger; a phylogenetic flight is fear;  a phylogenetic copulation is sexual love, and so one finds in this  conception an underlying principle which may be the key to an  understanding of the emotions and of certain diseases.        PAIN, LAUGHTER, AND CRYING[*]    [*] Address delivered before the John Ashhurst, Jr.. Surgical Society  of the University of Pennsylvania, May 3, 1912.    PAIN      Pain, like other phenomena, was probably evolved for a particular purpose--  surely for the good of the individual; like fear and worry,  it frequently is injurious.  What then may be its purpose?    We postulate that pain is one of the phenomena which result  from a stimulation to motor action.  When a barefoot boy steps  on a sharp stone it is important that the injuring contact be  released as quickly as possible; and therefore physical injury pain  results and impels the required action.  Anemia of the soft parts  at the points of pressure results from prolonged sitting or lying  in one position, and as a result pain compels a muscular action  that shifts the damaging pressure--this is the pain of anemia;  when the rays of the blazing sun shine directly upon the retina,  pain immediately causes a protective muscular action--the lid is closed,  the head turns away--this is light pain; when standing too close  to a blazing fire the excessive heat causes a pain which results  in the protective muscular action of moving away--this is heat pain;  when the urinary bladder is acutely overdistended the resultant  pain induces voluntary as well as involuntary muscular contraction--  this is evacuation pain; associated with defecation is a characteristic  warning pain, and an active pain which induces the required  muscular action--this, like the pain accompanying micturition,  is an evacuation pain; in obstruction of the urinary passages  and of the large and the small intestine the pain is exaggerated,  as is the accompanying muscular contraction--this is a pathologic  evacuation pain; when the fetus reaches full term and labor is  to begin, it is heralded by pain which is associated with rhythmic  contractions of the uterine muscle; later, many other muscles  take part in the birth and pain is associated with all these  muscular contractions--these are labor pains; when a foreign body,  be it ever so small, falls upon the conjunctiva or cornea there  results what is perhaps the acutest pain known, and quick and active  muscular action follows--this is special contact pain.  Special pain  receptors are placed in certain parts of the nose, the pharynx,  and the larynx, the stimulation of which causes special motor acts,  such as sneezing, hawking, coughing.  Curiously vague pains are  associated with the protective motor act of vomiting and with the sexual  motor acts--these may be termed nausea pains and pleasure pains.  We now see, therefore, that against the injurious physical contacts  of environment, against heat and cold, against damaging sunlight,  against local anemia when resting or sleeping, the body is protected  by virtue of the muscular action which results from pain.  Then, too, for the emptying of the pregnant uterus, for the evacuation  of the intestine and of the urinary bladder as normal acts,  and for the overcoming of obstructions in these tracts,  pain compels the required muscular actions, For passing gall-stones  and urinary calculi, urgent motor stimuli are awakened by pain.  For each of these diversified pains the consequent muscular action  is specific in type, distribution, and intensity.  This statement  is so commonplace that we are apt to miss the significance and  the wonder of it.  It is probable that every nerve-ending in the skin  and every type of stimulation represents a separate motor pattern,  the adequate stimulation of which causes always the same response.    Let us pass on to the discussion of another and perhaps even  more interesting type of pain, that associated with infection.  Not all kinds of infection are painful; and in those infections  that may be associated with pain there is pain only when certain  regions of the body are involved.  Among the infections that are not  associated with pain are scarlet fever, typhoid fever, measles, malaria,  whooping-cough, typhus fever, and syphilis in its early stages.  The infections that are usually, though not always, associated with  pain are the pyogenic infections.  The pyogenic infections  and the exanthemata constitute the great majority of infections  and are the basis of the discussion which follows.    I will state one of my principal conclusions first, _i.  e_., that the only types of infection that are associated with pain  are those in which the infection may be spread by muscular action  or those in which the fixation of parts by continued muscular  rigidity is an advantage; and, further, as a striking corollary,  that the type of infection that may cause muscular action when it  attacks one region of the body may cause no such action when it  attacks another region.
