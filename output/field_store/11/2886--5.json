So much baseness and fury did not go unpunished; and soon  afterwards, while combating us anew, he met with his death, from which he,  in fact, did not merit to be rescued, but which he would probably have  avoided, if faithful to honor and to gratitude, he had remained among us.    Just when we had almost finished applying a kind of dressing to the wounds  of Dominique, another voice was heard; it was that of the unfortunate woman  who was on the raft with us, and whom the madmen had thrown into the sea,  as well as her husband, who defended her with courage. Mr. Correard, in  despair at seeing two poor wretches perish, whose lamentable cries,  especially those of the woman, pierced his heart, seized a large rope which  was on the front of the raft, which he fastened round the middle of his  body, and threw himself, a second time, into the sea, whence he was so  happy as to rescue the woman, who invoked, with all her might, the aid of  Our Lady of Laux, while her husband was likewise saved by the chief  workman, Lavillette. We seated these two poor people upon dead bodies, with  their backs leaning against a barrel. In a few minutes they had recovered  their senses. The first thought of the woman was to enquire the name of him  who had saved her, and to testify to him the warmest gratitude. Thinking,  doubtless, that her words did not sufficiently express her sentiments, she  recollected that she had, in her pocket, a little snuff, and immediately  offered it to him--it was all she possessed. Touched by this present, but  not making use of this antiscorbutic, Mr. Correard, in turn, made a present  of it to a poor sailor, who used it three or four days. But a more  affecting scene, which it is impossible for us to describe, is the joy  which this unfortunate couple displayed when they had sufficiently  recovered their senses to see that they were saved.    The mutineers being repulsed, as we have said above, left us at this moment  a little repose. The moon with her sad beams, illumined this fatal raft,  this narrow space, in which were united so many heart-rending afflictions,  so many cruel distresses, a fury so insensate, a courage so heroic, the  most pleasing and generous sentiments of nature and humanity.    The man and his wife, who just before had seen themselves attacked with  sabres and bayonets, and thrown at the same moment into the waves of a  stormy sea, could hardly believe their senses when they found themselves in  each others arms. They felt, they expressed, so fervently, the happiness  which they were alas, to enjoy for so short a time, that this affecting  sight might have drawn tears from the most insensible heart; but in this  terrible moment, when we were but just breathing after the most furious  attack, when we were forced to be constantly on our guard, not only against  the attacks of the men, but also against the fury of the waves: few of us  had time, if we may say so, to suffer ourselves to be moved by this scene  of conjugal friendship.    Mr. Correard, one of those whom it had most agreeably affected, hearing the  woman still recommend herself, as she had done when in the sea, to our Lady  of Laux, exclaiming every instant, \"our good Lady of Laux do not forsake  us,\" recollected that there was, in fact, in the Department of the Upper  Alps, a place of devotion so called,[23] and asked her if she came from  that country. She replied in the affirmative, and said she had quitted it  24 years before, and that since that time she had been in the Campaigns in  Italy, &c. as a sutler; that she had never quitted our armies. \"Therefore,\"  said she, \"preserve my life, you see that I am a useful woman.\" \"Oh! if you  knew how often I also have braved death on the field of battle, to carry  assistance to our brave men.\" Then she amused herself with giving some  account of her campaigns. She mentioned those she had assisted, the  provisions which she had provided them, the brandy with which she had  treated them. \"Whether they had money or not,\" said she, \"I always let them  have my goods. Sometimes a battle made me lose some of my poor debtors; but  then, after the victory, others paid me double or triple the value of the  provisions which they had consumed before the battle. Thus I had a share in  their victory.\" The idea of owing her life to Frenchmen, at this moment,  seemed still to add to her happiness. Unfortunate woman! she did not  foresee the dreadful fate that awaited her among us! Let us return to our  raft.    After this second check, the fury of the soldiers suddenly abated, and gave  place to extreme cowardice: many of them fell at our feet and asked pardon,  which was instantly granted them. It is here, the place to observe and to  proclaim aloud for the honour of the French army, which has shewn itself as  great, as courageous, under reverses, as formidable in battle, that most of  these wretches were not worthy to wear its uniform. They were the scum of  all countries, the refuse of the prisons, where they had been collected to  make up the force charged with the defence and the protection of the  colony. When, for the sake of health, they were made to bathe in the sea, a  ceremony from which some of them had the modesty to endeavour to excuse  themselves, the whole crew had ocular demonstration that it was not upon  the _breast_ that these heroes wore the insignia of the exploits, which had  led them to serve the state in the Ports of Toulon, Brest or Rochefort.    This is not the moment, and perhaps we are not competent to examine whether  the penalty of branding, as it is re-established in our present code, is  compatible with the true object of all good legislation, that of correcting  while punishing, of striking only as far as is necessary to prevent and  preserve; in short, of producing the greatest good to all with the least  possible evil to individuals. Reason at least seems to demonstrate, and  what has passed before our own eyes authorises us to believe that it is as  dangerous, as inconsistent, to entrust arms for the protection of society,  to the hands of those whom society has itself rejected from its bosom; that  it implies a contradiction to require courage, generosity, and that  devotedness which commands a noble heart to sacrifice itself for its  country and fellow creatures, from wretches branded, degraded by  corruption, in whom every moral energy is destroyed, or eternally  compressed by the weight of the indelible opprobrium which renders them  aliens to their country, which separates them for ever from the rest of  mankind.    We soon had on board our raft a fresh proof of the impossibility of  depending on the permanence of any honorable sentiment in the hearts of  beings of this description.    Thinking that order was restored, we had returned to our post at the center  of the raft, only we took the precaution to retain our arms. It was nearly  midnight: after an hours apparent tranquillity, the soldiers rose again:  their senses were entirely deranged; they rushed upon us like madmen, with  their knives or sabres in their hands. As they were in full possession of  their bodily strength, and were also armed, we were forced again to put  ourselves on our defence. Their revolt was the more dangerous, as in their  delirium they were entirely deaf to the cries of reason. They attacked us;  we charged them in our turn, and soon the raft was covered with their dead  bodies. Those among our adversaries who had no arms, attempted to tear us  with their teeth; several of us were cruelly bitten; Mr. Savigny was  himself bitten in the legs and the shoulder; he received also a wound with  a knife in his right arm which deprived him, for a long time, of the use of  the fourth and little fingers of that hand; many others were wounded; our  clothes were pierced in many places by knives and sabres. One of our  workmen was also seized by four of the mutineers, who were going to throw  him into the sea. One of them had seized him by the right leg, and was  biting him cruelly in the sinew above the heel. The others were beating him  severely with their sabres and the but end of their carbines; his cries  made us fly to his aid. On this occasion, the brave Lavillette, ex-serjeant  of the artillery on foot, of the old guard, behaved with courage worthy of  the highest praise: we rushed on these desperadoes, after the example of  Mr. Correard, and soon rescued the workman from the danger which threatened  him. A few moments after, the mutineers, in another charge, seized on the  sub-lieutenant Lozach, whom they took, in their delirium, for Lieutenant  Danglas, of whom we have spoken above, and who had abandoned the raft when  we were on the point of putting off from the frigate. The soldiers, in  general, bore much ill will to this officer, who had seen little service,  and whom they reproached with having treated them harshly while they were  in garrison in the Isle of Rhe. It would have been a favorable opportunity  for them to satiate their rage upon him, and the thirst of vengeance and  destruction which animated them to fancy that they had found him in the  person of Mr. Lozach, they were going to throw him into the sea. In truth,  the soldiers almost equally disliked the latter, who had served only in the  Vendean bands of Saint Pol de Leon. We believed this officer lost, when his  voice being heard, informed us that it was still possible to save him.  Immediately Messrs. Clairet, Savigny, l'Heureux, Lavillette, Coudin,  Correard, and some workmen, having formed themselves into little parties,  fell upon the insurgents with so much impetuosity that they overthrew all  who opposed them, recovered Mr. Lozach, and brought him back to the center  of the raft.    The preservation of this officer cost us infinite trouble. Every moment the  soldiers demanded that he should be given up to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1182"],[0,"Dope (#11)"],[1,"your permission, Margaret, I should like him to do so.\"    \"Why, certainly,\" agreed the girl. \"In fact, I shall be glad of his  advice.\"    Seton inclined his head, and without another word resumed his seat. Gray  was too excited to sit down again. He stood on the tiger-skin rug before  the fender, watching his cousin and smoking furiously.    \"Firstly, then,\" continued Margaret, \"please throw that cigarette in the  fire, Quentin.\"    Gray removed the cigarette from between his lips, and stared at it  dazedly. He looked at the girl, and the clear grey eyes were watching  him with an inscrutable expression.    \"Right-o!\" he said awkwardly, and tossed the cigarette in the fire. \"You  used to smoke like a furnace, Margaret. Is this some new 'cult'?\"    \"I still smoke a great deal more than is good for me,\" she confessed,  \"but I don't smoke opium.\"    The effect of these words upon the two men who listened was curious.  Gray turned an angry glance upon the brown packet lying on the table,  and \"Faugh!\" he exclaimed, and drawing a handkerchief from his sleeve  began disgustedly to wipe his lips. Seton stared hard at the speaker,  tossed his cheroot into the fire, and taking up the packet withdrew a  cigarette and sniffed at it critically. Margaret watched him.    He tore the wrapping off, and tasted a strand of the tobacco.    \"Good heavens!\" he whispered. \"Gray, these things are doped!\"        CHAPTER X. SIR LUCIEN'S STUDY WINDOW    Old Bond Street presented a gloomy and deserted prospect to Chief  Inspector Kerry as he turned out of Piccadilly and swung along toward  the premises of Kazmah. He glanced at the names on some of the shop  windows as he passed, and wondered if the furriers, jewelers and other  merchants dealing in costly wares properly appreciated the services of  the Metropolitan Police Force. He thought of the peacefully slumbering  tradesmen in their suburban homes, the safety of their stocks wholly  dependent upon the vigilance of that Unsleeping Eye--for to an  unsleeping eye he mentally compared the service of which he was a  member.    A constable stood on duty before the door of the block. Red Kerry was  known by sight and reputation to every member of the force, and the  constable saluted as the celebrated Chief Inspector appeared.    \"Anything to report, constable?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"What?\"    \"The ambulance has been for the body, and another gentleman has been.\"    Kerry stared at the man.    \"Another gentleman? Who the devil's the other gentleman?\"    \"I don't know, sir. He came with Inspector Whiteleaf, and was inside for  nearly an hour.\"    \"Inspector Whiteleaf is off duty. What time was this?\"    \"Twelve-thirty, sir.\"    Kerry chewed reflectively ere nodding to the man and passing on.    \"Another gentleman!\" he muttered, entering the hallway. \"Why didn't  Inspector Warley report this? Who the devil--\" Deep in thought he walked  upstairs, finding his way by the light of the pocket torch which he  carried. A second constable was on duty at Kazmah's door. He saluted.    \"Anything to report?\" rapped Kerry.    \"Yes, sir. The body has been removed, and the gentleman with  Inspector--\"    \"Damn that for a tale! Describe this gentleman.\"    \"Rather tall, pale, dark, clean-shaven. Wore a fur-collared overcoat,  collar turned up. He was accompanied by Inspector Whiteleaf.\"    \"H'm. Anything else?\"    \"Yes. About an hour ago I heard a noise on the next floor--\"    \"Eh!\" snapped Kerry, and shone the light suddenly into the man's face so  that he blinked furiously.    \"Eh? What kind of noise?\"    \"Very slight. Like something moving.\"    \"Like something! Like what thing? A cat or an elephant?\"    \"More like, say, a box or a piece of furniture.\"    \"And you did--what?\"    \"I went up to the top landing and listened.\"    \"What did you hear?\"    \"Nothing at all.\"    Chief Inspector Kerry chewed audibly.    \"All quiet?\" he snapped.    \"Absolutely. But I'm certain I heard something all the same.\"    \"How long had Inspector Whiteleaf and this dark horse in the fur coat  been gone at the time you heard the noise?\"    \"About half an hour, sir.\"    \"Do you think the noise came from the landing or from one of the offices  above?\"    \"An office I should say. It was very dim.\"    Chief Inspector Kerry pushed upon the broken door, and walked into the  rooms of Kazmah. Flashing the ray of his torch on the wall, he found the  switch and snapped up the lights. He removed his overall and tossed it  on a divan with his cane. Then, tilting his bowler further forward, he  thrust his hands into his reefer pockets, and stood staring toward the  door, beyond which lay the room of the murder, in darkness.    \"Who is he?\" he muttered. \"What's it mean?\"    Taking up the torch, he walked through and turned on the lights in  the inner rooms. For a long time he stood staring at the little square  window low down behind the ebony chair, striving to imagine uses for it  as his wife had urged him to do. The globular green lamp in the second  apartment was worked by three switches situated in the inside room,  and he had discovered that in this way the visitor who came to consult  Kazmah was treated to the illusion of a gradually falling darkness.  Then, the door in the first partition being opened, whoever sat in the  ebony chair would become visible by the gradual uncovering of a light  situated above the chair. On this light being covered again the figure  would apparently fade away.    It was ingenious, and, so far, quite clear. But two things badly puzzled  the inquirer; the little window down behind the chair, and the fact that  all the arrangements for raising and lowering the lights were situated  not in the narrow chamber in which Kazmah's chair stood, and in which  Sir Lucien had been found, but in the room behind it--the room with  which the little window communicated.    The table upon which the telephone rested was set immediately under this  mysterious window, the window was provided with a green blind, and the  switchboard controlling the complicated lighting scheme was also within  reach of anyone seated at the table.    Kerry rolled mint gum from side to side of his mouth, and absently tried  the handle of the door opening out from this interior room--evidently  the office of the establishment--into the corridor. He knew it to be  locked. Turning, he walked through the suite and out on to the landing,  passing the constable and going upstairs to the top floor, torch in  hand.    From the main landing he walked along the narrow corridor until he stood  at the head of the back stairs. The door nearest to him bore the name:  \"Cubanis Cigarette Company.\" He tried the handle. The door was locked,  as he had anticipated. Kneeling down, he peered into the keyhole,  holding the electric torch close beside his face and chewing  industriously.    Ere long he stood up, descended again, but by the back stair, and stood  staring reflectively at the door communicating with Kazmah's inner room.  Then walking along the corridor to where the man stood on, the landing,  he went in again to the mysterious apartments, but only to get his cane  and his overall and to turn out the lights.    Five minutes later he was ringing the late Sir Lucien's door-bell.    A constable admitted him, and he walked straight through into the study  where Coombes, looking very tired but smiling undauntedly, sat at a  littered table studying piles of documents.    \"Anything to report?\" rapped Kerry.    \"The man, Mareno, has gone to bed, and the expert from the Home office  has been--\"    Inspector Kerry brought his cane down with a crash upon the table,  whereat Coombes started nervously.    \"So that's it!\" he shouted furiously, \"an 'expert from the Home office'!  So that's the dark horse in the fur coat. Coombes! I'm fed up to the  back teeth with this gun from the Home office! If I'm not to have entire  charge of the case I'll throw it up. I'll stand for no blasted overseer  checking my work! Wait till I see the Assistant Commissioner! What the  devil has the job to do with the Home office!\"    \"Can't say,\" murmured Coombes. \"But he's evidently a big bug from the  way Whiteleaf treated him. He instructed me to stay in the kitchen and  keep an eye on Mareno while he prowled about in here.\"    \"Instructed you!\" cried Kerry, his teeth gleaming and his steel-blue  eyes creating upon Coombes' mind an impression that they were emitting  sparks. \"Instructed you! I'll ask you a question, Detective-Sergeant  Coombes: Who is in charge of this case?\"    \"Well, I thought you were.\"    \"You thought I was?\"    \"Well, you are.\"    \"I am? Very well--you were saying--?\"    \"I was saying that I went into the kitchen--\"    \"Before that! Something about 'instructed.'\"    Poor Coombes smiled pathetically.    \"Look here,\" he said, bravely meeting the ferocious glare of his  superior, \"as man to man. What could I do?\"    \"You could stop smiling!\" snapped Kerry. \"Hell!\" He paced several times  up and down the room. \"Go ahead, Coombes.\"    \"Well, there's nothing much to report. I stayed in the kitchen, and the  man from the Home office was in here alone for about half an hour.\"    \"Alone?\"    \"Inspector Whiteleaf stayed in the dining-room.\"    \"Had he been 'instructed' too?\"    \"I expect so. I think he just came along as a sort of guide.\"    \"Ah!\" muttered Kerry savagely, \"a sort of guide! Any idea what the bogey  man did in here?\"    \"He opened the window. I heard him.\"    \"That's funny. It's exactly what I'm going to do! This smart from  Whitehall hasn't got a corner in notions yet, Coombes.\"    The room was a large and lofty one, and had been used by a former tenant  as a studio. The toplights had been roofed over by Sir Lucien, however,  but the raised platform, approached by two steps, which had probably  been used as a model's throne, was a permanent fixture of the apartment.  It was backed now by bookcases, except where a blue plush curtain was  draped before a"]]]
