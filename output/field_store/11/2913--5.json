And at the end of  his account, fearing lest the good advice he had given for making the  condition of the slaves more comfortable should be construed into an  approbation of such a traffic, he employed several pages in showing its  utter inconsistency with sound policy, justice, reason, humanity, and  religion.    \"I will not here,\" says he, \"so far debase myself as to enlarge the  ignominious list of those writers, who devote their abilities to justify by  policy what morality condemns. In an age where so many errors are boldly  laid open, it would be unpardonable to conceal any truth that is  interesting to humanity. If whatever I have hitherto advanced hath  seemingly tended only to alleviate the burthen of slavery, the reason is,  that it was first necessary to give some comfort to those unhappy beings,  whom we cannot set free, and convince their oppressors, that they were  cruel, to the prejudice of their real interests. But, in the mean time,  till some considerable revolution shall make the evidence of this great  truth felt, it may not be improper to pursue this subject further. I shall  then first prove that there is no reason of state, which can authorize  slavery. I shall not be afraid to cite to the tribunal of reason and  justice those governments, which tolerate this cruelty, or which even are  not ashamed to make it the basis of their power.\"    And a little further on he observes--\"Will it be said that he, who wants to  make me a slave, does me no injury, but that he only makes use of his  rights? Where are those rights? Who hath stamped upon them so sacred a  character as to silence mine?\"--    In the beginning of the next paragraph he speaks thus: \"He, who supports  the system of slavery, is the enemy of the whole human race. He divides it  into two societies of legal assassins; the oppressors, and the oppressed.  It is the same thing as proclaiming to the world, If you would preserve  your life, instantly take away mine, for I want to have yours.\"    Going on two pages further, we find these words: \"But the Negros, they say,  are a race born for slavery; their dispositions are narrow, treacherous,  and wicked; they themselves allow the superiority of our understandings,  and almost acknowledge the justice of our authority.--Yes--The minds of the  Negros are contracted, because slavery destroys all the springs of the  soul. They are wicked, but not equally so with you. They are treacherous,  because they are under no obligation to speak truth to their tyrants. They  acknowledge the superiority of our understanding, because we have abused  their ignorance. They allow the justice of our authority, because we have  abused their weakness.\"    \"But these Negros, it is further urged, were born slaves. Barbarians! will  you persuade me, that a man can be the property of a sovereign, a son the  property of a father, a wife the property of a husband, a domestic the  property of a master, a Negro the property of a planter?\"    But I have no time to follow this animated author, even by short extracts,  through the varied strains of eloquence which he displays upon this  occasion. I can only say, that his labours entitle him to a high station  among the benefactors to the African race.    The third was Dr. Paley, whose genius, talents, and learning have been so  eminently displayed in his writings in the cause of natural and revealed  religion. Dr. Paley did not write any essay expressly in favour of the  Africans. But in his Moral Philosophy, where he treated on slavery, he took  an opportunity of condemning, in very severe terms, the continuance of it.  In this work he defined what slavery was, and how it might arise  consistently with the law of nature; but he made an exception against that  which arose from the African trade.    \"The Slave-trade,\" says he, \"upon the coast of Africa, is not excused by  these principles. When slaves in that country are brought to market, no  questions, I believe, are asked about the origin or justice of the vendor's  title. It may be presumed, therefore, that this title is not always, if it  be ever, founded in any of the causes above assigned.\"    \"But defect of right in the first purchase is the least crime with which  this traffic is chargeable. The natives are excited to war and mutual  depredation, for the sake of supplying their contracts, or furnishing the  markets with slaves. With this the wickedness begins. The slaves, torn away  from their parents, wives and children, from their friends and companions,  from their fields and flocks, from their home and country, are transported  to the European settlements in America, with no other accommodation on  ship-board than what is provided for brutes. This is the second stage of  the cruelty, from which the miserable exiles are delivered, only to be  placed, and that for life, in subjection to a dominion and system of laws,  the most merciless and tyrannical that ever were tolerated upon the face of  the earth: and from all that can be learned by the accounts of people upon  the spot, the inordinate authority, which the Plantation-laws confer upon  the slave-holder, is exercised by the English slave-holder, especially,  with rigour and brutality.\"    \"But necessity is pretended, the name under which every enormity is  attempted to be justified; and after all, What is the necessity? It has  never been proved that the land could not be cultivated there, as it is  here, by hired servants. It is said that it could not be cultivated with  quite the same conveniency and cheapness, as by the labour of slaves; by  which means, a pound of sugar, which the planter now sells for sixpence,  could not be afforded under sixpence-halfpenny--and this is the necessity!\"    \"The great revolution, which has taken place in the western world, may  probably conduce (and who knows but that it was designed) to accelerate the  fall of this abominable tyranny: and now that this contest and the passions  which attend it are no more, there may succeed perhaps a season for  reflecting, whether a legislature, which had so long lent its assistance to  the support of an institution replete with human misery, was fit to be  trusted with an empire, the most extensive that ever obtained in any age or  quarter of the world.\"    The publication of these sentiments may be supposed to have produced an  extensive effect. For the Moral Philosophy was adopted early by some of the  colleges in our universities into the system of their education. It soon  found its way also into most of the private libraries of the kingdom; and  it was, besides, generally read and approved. Dr. Paley, therefore, must be  considered as having been a considerable coadjutor in interesting the mind  of the public in favour of the oppressed Africans.    In the year 1783, we find Mr. Sharp coming again into notice. We find him  at this time taking a part in a cause, the knowledge of which, in  proportion as it was disseminated, produced an earnest desire among all  disinterested persons for the abolition of the Slave-trade.    In this year, certain underwriters desired to be heard against Gregson and  others of Liverpool, in the case of the ship Zong, captain Collingwood,  alleging that the captain and officers of the said vessel threw overboard  one hundred and thirty-two slaves alive into the sea, in order to defraud  them, by claiming the value of the said slaves, as if they had been lost in  a natural way. In the course of the trial, which afterwards came on, it  appeared, that the slaves on board the Zong were very sickly; that sixty of  them had already died; and several were ill and likely to die, when the  captain proposed to James Kelsall, the mate, and others, to throw several  of them overboard, stating \"that if they died a natural death, the loss  would fall upon the owners of the ship, but that, if they were thrown into  the sea, it would fall upon the underwriters.\" He selected accordingly one  hundred and thirty-two of the most sickly of the slaves. Fifty-four of  these were immediately thrown overboard, and forty-two were made to be  partakers of their fate on the succeeding day. In the course of three days  afterwards the remaining twenty-six were brought upon deck to complete the  number of victims. The first sixteen submitted to be thrown into the sea;  but the rest with a noble resolution would not suffer the officers to touch  them, but leaped after their companions and shared their fate.    The plea, which was set up in behalf of this atrocious and unparalleled act  of wickedness, was, that the captain discovered, when he made the proposal,  that he had only two hundred gallons of water on board, and that he had  missed his port; It was proved, however, in answer to this, that no one had  been put upon short allowance; and that, as if Providence had determined to  afford an unequivocal proof of the guilt, a shower of rain fell and  continued for three days immediately after the second lot of slaves had  been destroyed, by means of which they might have filled many of their  vessels[A] with water, and thus have prevented all necessity for the  destruction of the third.    [Footnote A: It appeared that they filled six.]    Mr. Sharp was present at this trial, and procured the attendance of a  short-hand-writer to take down the facts, which should come out in the  course of it. These he gave to the public afterwards. He communicated them  also, with a copy of the trial, to the Lords of the Admiralty, as the  guardians of justice upon the seas, and to the Duke of Portland, as  principal minister of state. No notice however was taken by any of these,  of the information which had been thus sent them.

Now as the boys grew Esau became a skilful hunter, but Jacob was a  quiet man, a dweller in tents.  And Isaac loved Esau--for he had a  taste for game--and Rebekah loved Jacob.    Once when Jacob was preparing a stew, Esau came in from the field,  and he was faint; therefore Esau said to Jacob, Let me eat quickly,  I pray, some of that red food, for I am faint.  (Therefore his name  was called Edom, Red.) But Jacob said, Sell me first of all your  birthright.  And Esau replied, Alas! I am nearly dead, therefore of  what use is this birthright to me?  And Jacob said, Swear to me  first; so he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.  Then  Jacob gave Esau bread and stewed lentils, and when he had eaten and  drank, he rose up and went his way.  Thus Esau despised his  birthright.--_Hist. Bible_.

South of the Dead Sea, bounded by the rocky desert on the east and  the hot barren Arabah on the west, extends the wild picturesque  range of Mount Seir.  It is a land of lofty heights and deep,  almost inaccessible valleys, the home of the hunter and the nomad.  From a few copious springs there issue clear, refreshing brooks,  which run rippling through the deep ravines, but soon lose  themselves in their hot, gravelly beds.  A few miles further on  they emerge and again disappear, as they approach the borders of  the hot, thirsty wilderness that surrounds Mount Seir on every  side.  Here in early times lived the Edomites, a nomadic people who  established themselves in this borderland of Palestine long before  the Hebrews gained a permanent foothold in the land of Canaan.  The  name, Edom, is found in an inscription of a king of the eighth  Egyptian Dynasty,    In the Biblical narrative, Esau evidently is the traditional  ancestor of the Edomites, even as Jacob figures as the father of  the twelve tribes.  One of the aims of these narratives, it seems  to many scholars, is to explain why the Israelites, the younger  people, who settled latest in Palestine, ultimately possessed the  land and conquered the Edomites.    The portraits of Esau and Jacob are remarkably true to the  characteristics of these two rival nations.  They are also faithful  to human nature as we find it to-day.  Of these two brothers which,  on the whole, is the more attractive? Which resembles his father  and which his mother?  (Read the accounts of their lives, Gen.  24-27.)  What noble virtues does Esau possess?  What was his great  fault?  Reckless men or drifters with generous impulses but with no  definite purpose, of whom gypsies and hoboes are extreme types, are  found in every age and society.  Why is it that men of the type of  Esau so often in time become criminals?      II.    THE MAN WITH A WRONG AMBITION.    The modern tendency to idealize the character of Jacob, simply  because he was one of the famous patriarchs, is both unfortunate  and misleading.  Although he vividly typifies certain  characteristics of his race, the Jacob of these early prophetic  accounts is portrayed with absolute fidelity and realism.  His  faults are revealed even more clearly than his virtues.  The  dominant motive in his life is ambition, but it is a thoroughly  selfish ambition.  In the light of the stories, state in your own  words what was the exact nature of Jacob's ambition.  How did it  differ from that of Abraham?  What methods did he use to achieve  his ambition?  Were these methods justifiable?  What is your view  of the statement, \"The end justifies the means\"?  Try to define  exactly the method of determining justifiable means.  May Jacob's  action be excused because he was acting under the direction of his  mother?    Does a man with a selfish ambition always injure others?  Does he  in the end injure himself most of all?  How?  Every type of  selfishness is directly opposed to a man's highest self-interest.  Jesus continually had this large truth in mind when he declared,  \"He that findeth his life shall lose it, but he that loseth his  life for my sake shall find it.\"  Jesus himself illustrated this  principle.  Cite other illustrations from history.  From your own  observation or experience.    Was Jacob, even with his wrong ambition, a stronger and more  promising character than his brother Esau?  Why?    Would you rather have your son a boy of strong character with  vicious tendency or a weakling with harmless, virtuous inclinations?      III.    JACOB'S TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL OF EXPERIENCE.    Jacob's experiences as a fugitive well illustrate the homely  proverb, \"The way of the transgressor is hard.\"  He who deceived  and cheated his brother soon became the victim of deception and  fraud.  Most painful of all was the ever-haunting sense of fear  because of the consequences of his wrong acts that followed him  even in his life as an exile and, like a spectre, confronted him as  he returned again to the scenes of his boyhood.  These painful  experiences were probably essential to the development of Jacob's  character.  Are there any other ways in which men of this type can  be led to appreciate that their ambitions are wrong?  Was Laban any  more unjust or tricky in his dealing with Jacob than Jacob had been  with Esau, or than Jacob was with Laban?  Note the grim humor  running through these stories.  They are the type of stories that  would be especially appreciated when told by shepherds beside the  camp fire.    The most significant point in these stories is that they declare  that Jehovah's care and guidance followed the selfish deceiver even  as he fled the consequences of his own misdeeds.  Why should that  divine care shield him from the consequences of his misdeeds?  Do  we find such instances to-day?  How do you explain them?  What is  the meaning of the story of Jacob's vision at Bethel?  What  promising elements did Jehovah find in Jacob's character?  What  practical lessons did Jacob learn during his sojourn in Aram?    Was Jacob really a hypocrite, or did he in fact fail to see any  inconsistency between, his trickery and meanness and his worship of  Jehovah?  A man may be sincere in his religious worship on Sunday  and yet cheat a neighbor on Monday.  Analyze carefully the nature  of his religion.      IV.    THE INVINCIBLE POWER OP AMBITION AND PERSEVERANCE.    History and modern life abound in illustrations of what can be  accomplished by the combination of ambition and perseverance.  Cyrus, the king of a little upland province, through a remarkable  series of victories became the undisputed master of south-western  Asia and laid the foundations of the great Persian Empire.  Julius  Caesar, who transformed Rome from a republic into an empire, and  Napoleon the Corsican, are the classic illustrations of the power  of great ambition and dauntless persistency.  Far nobler is that  quiet, courageous perseverance which led Livingston through the  trackless"]]]
