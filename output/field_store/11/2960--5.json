Don't say I had rather not; say I would rather not.    Don't say two spoonsful; say two spoonfuls.             *       *       *       *       *    ETIQUETTE OF DRESS AND HABITS.      Don't let one day pass without a thorough cleansing of your person.    Don't sit down to your evening meal before a complete toilet if you  have company.    Don't cleanse your nails, your nose or your ears in public.    Don't use hair dye, hair oil or pomades.    Don't wear evening dress in daytime.    Don't wear jewelry of a gaudy character; genuine jewelry modestly worn  is not out of place.    Don't overdress yourself or walk affectedly.    Don't wear slippers or dressing-gown or smoking-jacket out of your own  house.    Don't sink your hands in your trousers' pockets.    Don't whistle in public places, nor inside of houses either.    Don't use your fingers or fists to beat a tattoo upon floor desk or  window panes.    Don't examine other people's papers or letters scattered on their  desk.    Don't bring a smell of spirits or tobacco into the presence of ladies.    Never use either in the presence of ladies.    Don't drink spirits; millions have tried it to their sorrow.             *       *       *       *       *    ETIQUETTE ON THE STREET.      1. Your conduct on the street should always be modest and dignified.  Ladies should carefully avoid all loud and boisterous conversation or  laughter and all undue liveliness in public.    2. When walking on the street do not permit yourself to be  absent-minded, as to fail to recognize a friend; do not go along  reading a book or newspaper.    3. In walking with a lady on the street give her the inner side of  the walk, unless the outside if the safer part; in which case she is  entitled to it.    4. Your arm should not be given to any lady except your wife or a near  relative, or a very old lady, during the day, unless her comfort or  safety requires it. At night the arm should always be offered; also in  ascending the steps of a public building.    5. In crossing the street a lady should gracefully raise her dress  a little above her ankle with one hand. To raise the dress with both  hands is vulgar, except in places where the mud is very deep.    6. A gentleman meeting a lady acquaintance on the street should not  presume to join her in her walk without first asking her permission.    7. If you have anything to say to a lady whom you may happen to meet  in the street, however intimate you may be, do not stop her, but turn  round and walk in company with her; you can take leave at the end of  the street.    8. A lady should not venture out upon the street alone after dark. By  so doing she compromises her dignity, and exposes herself to indignity  at the hands of the rougher class.    9. Never offer to shake hands with a lady in the street if you have on  dark or soiled gloves, as you may soil hers.    10. A lady does not form acquaintances upon the street, or seek to  attract the attention of the other sex or of persons of her own sex.  Her conduct is always modest and unassuming. Neither does a lady  demand services or favors from a gentleman. She accepts them  graciously, always expressing her thanks. A gentleman will not stand  on the street corners, or in hotel doorways, or store windows and  gaze impertinently at ladies as they pass by. This is the exclusive  business of loafers.    11. In walking with a lady who has your arm, should you have to cross  the street, do not disengage your arm and go around upon the outside,  unless the lady's comfort renders it necessary. In walking with a  lady, where it is necessary for you to proceed singly, always go  before her.             *       *       *       *       *    ETIQUETTE BETWEEN SEXES.      1. A lady should be a lady, and a gentleman a gentleman under any and  all circumstances.    2. FEMALE INDIFFERENCE TO MAN.--There is nothing that affects  the nature and pleasure of man so much as a proper and friendly  recognition from a lady, and as women are more or less dependent upon  man's good-will, either for gain or pleasure, it surely stands to  their interest to be reasonably pleasant and courteous in his presence  or society. Indifference is always a poor investment, whether in  society or business.    3. GALLANTRY AND LADYISM should be a prominent feature in the  education of young people. Politeness to ladies cultivates the  intellect and refines the soul and he who can be easy and  entertaining in the society of ladies has mastered one of the greatest  accomplishments. There is nothing taught in school, academy or  college, that contributes so much to the happiness of man as a full  development of his social and moral qualities.    4. LADYLIKE ETIQUETTE.--No woman can afford to treat men rudely. A  lady must have a high intellectual and moral ideal and hold herself  above reproach. She must remember that the art of pleasing and  entertaining gentlemen is infinitely more ornamental than laces,  ribbons or diamonds. Dress and glitter may please man, but it will  never benefit him.    5. CULTIVATE DEFICIENCIES.--Men and women poorly sexed treat each  other with more or less indifference, whereas a hearty sexuality  inspires both to a right estimation of the faculties and qualities of  each other. Those who are deficient should seek society and overcome  their deficiencies. While some naturally inherit faculties as  entertainers others are compelled to acquire them by cultivation.    [Illustration: ASKING AN HONEST QUESTION.]    6. LADIES' SOCIETY.--He who seeks ladies' society should seek an  education and should have a pure heart and a pure mind. Read good,  pure and wholesome literature and study human nature, and you will  always be a favorite in the society circle.    7. WOMAN HATERS.--Some men with little refinement and strong sensual  feelings virtually insult and thereby disgust and repel every female  they meet. They look upon woman with an inherent vulgarity, and doubt  the virtue and integrity of all alike. But it is because they are  generally insincere and impure themselves, and with such a nature  culture and refinement are out of the question, there must be a  revolution.    8. MEN HATERS.--Women who look upon all men as odious, corrupt or  hateful, are no doubt so themselves, though they may be clad in  silk and sparkle with diamonds and be as pretty as a lily; but their  hypocrisy will out, and they can never win the heart of a faithful,  conscientious and well balanced man. A good woman has broad ideas and  great sympathy. She respects all men until they are proven unworthy.    9. FOND OF CHILDREN.--The man who is naturally fond of children will  make a good husband and a good father. So it behooves the young man,  to notice children and cultivate the art of pleasing them. It will be  a source of interest, education and permanent benefit to all.    10. EXCESSIVE LUXURY.--Although the association with ladies is an  expensive luxury, yet it is not an expensive education. It elevates,  refines, sanctifies and purifies, and improves the whole man. A young  man who has a pure and genuine respect for ladies, will not only make  a good husband, but a good citizen as well.    11. MASCULINE ATTENTION.--No woman is entitled to any more attention  than her loveliness and ladylike conduct will command. Those who are  most pleasing will receive the most attention, and those who desire  more should aspire to acquire more by cultivating those graces and  virtues which ennoble woman, but no lady should lower or distort her  own true ideal, or smother and crucify her conscience, in order  to please any living man. A good man will admire a good woman, and  deceptions cannot long be concealed. Her show of dry goods or glitter  of jewels cannot long cover up her imperfections or deceptions.    12. PURITY.--Purity of purpose will solve all social problems. Let all  stand on this exalted sexual platform, and teach every man just how  to treat the female sex, and every woman how to behave towards the  masculine; and it will incomparably adorn the manners of both, make  both happy in each other, and mutually develop each other's sexuality  and humanity.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]             *       *       *       *       *    PRACTICAL RULES ON TABLE MANNERS.      1. Help ladies with a due appreciation; do not overload the plate of  any person you serve. Never pour gravy on a plate without permission.  It spoils the meat for some persons.    2. Never put anything by force upon any one's plate. It is extremely  ill-bred, though extremely common, to press one to eat of anything.    3. If at dinner you are requested to help any one to sauce or gravy,  do not pour it over the meat or vegetables, but on one side of them.  Never load down a person's plate with anything.    4. As soon as you are helped, begin to eat, or at least begin to  occupy yourself with what you have before you. Do not wait till your  neighbors are served--a custom that was long ago abandoned.    5. Should you, however, find yourself at a table where they have the  old-fashioned steel forks, eat with your knife, as the others do, and  do not let it be seen that you have any objection to doing so.    6. Bread should be broken. To butter a large piece of bread and then  bite it, as children do, is something the knowing never do.    7. In eating game or poultry do not touch the bones with your fingers.  To take a bone in the fingers for the purpose of picking it, is looked  upon as being very inelegant.    8. Never use your own knife or fork to help another. Use rather the  knife or fork of the person you help.    9. Never send your knife or fork, or either of them, on your plate  when you send for second supply.    10. Never turn your elbows out when you use your knife and fork. Keep  them close to your sides.    11.

It recalls some crazy tale about the great works of the Wise Men  of Gotham.  It suggests the old joke about the man who made  a small hole for the kitten as well as a large hole for the cat.  Everybody has read about it by this time; but the immediate impression  of it is not merely an effect of reading or even of reasoning.  It looks lop-sided; like something done by a one-eyed giant.  But it was done by the last prince of the great Prussian imperial system,  in what was probably the proudest moment in all his life of pride.    What is true has a way of sounding trite; and what is trite has  a way of sounding false.  We shall now probably weary the world  with calling the Germans barbaric, just as we very recently wearied  the world with calling them cultured and progressive and scientific.  But the thing is true though we say it a thousand times.  And any one who  wishes to understand the sense in which it is true has only to contemplate  that fantasy and fallacy in stone; a gate with an open road beside it.  The quality I mean, however, is not merely in that particular contrast;  as of a front door standing by itself in an open field.  It is also in the origin, the occasion and the whole story of the thing.  There is above all this supreme stamp of the barbarian; the sacrifice  of the permanent to the temporary.  When the walls of the Holy City  were overthrown for the glory of the German Emperor, it was hardly  even for that everlasting glory which has been the vision and  the temptation of great men.  It was for the glory of a single day.  It was something rather in the nature of a holiday than anything  that could be even in the most vainglorious sense a heritage.  It did not in the ordinary sense make a monument, or even a trophy.  It destroyed a monument to make a procession.  We might almost say  that it destroyed a trophy to make a triumph.  There is the true  barbaric touch in this oblivion of what Jerusalem would look like a  century after, or a year after, or even the day after.  It is this  which distinguishes the savage tribe on the march after a victory from  the civilised army establishing a government, even if it be a tyranny.  Hence the very effect of it, like the effect of the whole Prussian  adventure in history, remains something negative and even nihilistic.  The Christians made the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Moslems  made the Mosque of Omar; but this is what the most scientific  culture made at the end of the great century of science.  It made an enormous hole.  The only positive contribution of  the nineteenth century to the spot is an unnaturally ugly clock,  at the top of an ornamental tower, or a tower that was meant to  be ornamental.  It was erected, I believe, to commemorate the reign  of Abdul Hamid; and it seems perfectly adapted to its purpose,  like one of Sir William Watson's sonnets on the same subject.  But this object only adds a touch of triviality to the much more  tremendous negative effect of the gap by the gate.  That remains a parable  as well as a puzzle, under all the changing skies of day and night;  with the shadows that gather tinder the narrow Gate of Humility;  and beside it, blank as daybreak and abrupt as an abyss, the broad  road that has led already to destruction.    The gap remains like a gash, a sort of wound in the walls; but it  only strengthens by contrast the general sense of their continuity.  Save this one angle where the nineteenth century has entered,  the vague impression of the thirteenth or fourteenth century rather  deepens than dies away.  It is supported more than many would suppose  even by the figures that appear in the gateways or pass in procession  under the walls.  The brown Franciscans and the white Dominicans  would alone give some colour to a memory of the Latin kingdom  of Jerusalem; and there are other examples and effects which are  less easily imagined in the West.  Thus as I look down the street,  I see coming out from under an archway a woman wearing a high white  head-dress very like those we have all seen in a hundred pictures  of tournaments or hunting parties, or the Canterbury Pilgrimage  or the Court of Louis XI.  She is as white as a woman of the North;  and it is not, I think, entirely fanciful to trace a certain  freedom and dignity in her movement, which is quite different  at least from the shuffling walk of the shrouded Moslem women.  She is a woman of Bethlehem, where a tradition, it is said, still claims  as a heroic heritage the blood of the Latin knights of the cross.  This is, of course, but one aspect of the city; but it is one  which may be early noted, yet one which is generally neglected.  As I have said, I had expected many things of Jerusalem,  but I had not expected this.  I had expected to be disappointed  with it as a place utterly profaned and fallen below its mission.  I had expected to be awed by it; indeed I had expected to be frightened  of it, as a place dedicated and even doomed by its mission.  But I had never fancied that it would be possible to be fond of it;  as one might be fond of a little walled town among the orchards  of Normandy or the hop-fields of Kent.    And just then there happened a coincidence that was also something  like a catastrophe.  I was idly watching, as it moved down  the narrow street to one of the dark doorways, the head-dress,  like a tower of white drapery, belonging to the Christian woman  from the place where Christ was born.  After she had disappeared  into the darkness of the porch I continued to look vaguely  at the porch, and thought how easily it might have been a small  Gothic gate in some old corner of Rouen, or even Canterbury.  In twenty such places in the town one may see the details that  appeal to the same associations, so different and so distant.  One may see that angular dogtooth ornament that makes the round  Norman gateways look like the gaping mouths of sharks.  One may see the pointed niches in the walls, shaped like windows  and serving somewhat the purpose of brackets, on which were  to stand sacred images possibly removed by the Moslems.  One may come upon a small court planted with ornamental trees  with some monument in the centre, which makes the precise impression  of something in a small French town.  There are no Gothic spires,  but there are numberless Gothic doors and windows; and he who  first strikes the place at this angle, as it were, may well feel  the Northern element as native and the Eastern element as intrusive.  While I was thinking all these things, something happened which in  that place was almost a portent.    It was very cold; and there were curious colours in the sky.  There had been chilly rains from time to time; and the whole  air seemed to have taken on something sharper than a chill.  It was as if a door had been opened in the northern corner of the heavens;  letting in something that changed all the face of the earth.  Great grey clouds with haloes of lurid pearl and pale-green were coming  up from the plains or the sea and spreading over the towers of the city.  In the middle of the moving mass of grey vapours was a splash  of paler vapour; a wan white cloud whose white seemed somehow more  ominous than gloom.  It went over the high citadel like a white  wild goose flying; and a few white feathers fell.    It was the snow; and it snowed day and night until that Eastern  city was sealed up like a village in Norway or Northern Scotland.  It rose in the streets till men might almost have been drowned  in it like a sea of solid foam.  And the people of the place told  me there had been no such thing seen in it in all recent records,  or perhaps in the records of all its four thousand years.    All this came later; but for me at the moment, looking at the scene  in so dreamy a fashion, it seemed merely like a dramatic conclusion  to my dream.  It was but an accident confirming what was but an aspect.  But it confirmed it with a strange and almost supernatural completeness.  The white light out of the window in the north lay on all the roofs  and turrets of the mountain town; for there is an aspect in which  snow looks less like frozen water than like solidified light.  As the snow accumulated there accumulated also everywhere  those fantastic effects of frost which seem to fit in with  the fantastic qualities of medieval architecture; and which  make an icicle seem like the mere extension of a gargoyle.  It was the atmosphere that has led so many romancers to make  medieval Paris a mere black and white study of night and snow.  Something had redrawn in silver all things from the rude ornament  on the old gateways to the wrinkles on the ancient hills of Moab.  Fields of white still spotted with green swept down into the valleys  between us and the hills; and high above them the Holy City lifted  her head into the thunder-clouded heavens, wearing a white head-dress  like a daughter of the Crusaders.        CHAPTER IV    THE PHILOSOPHY OF SIGHT-SEEING    Various cultivated critics told me that I should find  Jerusalem disappointing; and I fear it will disappoint them that I  am not disappointed.  Of the city as a city I shall try to say  something elsewhere; but the things which these critics have  especially in mind are at once more general and more internal.  They concern something tawdry, squalid or superstitious about the shrines  and those who use them.  Now the mistake of critics is not that they  criticise the world; it is that they never criticise themselves.  They compare the alien with the ideal; but they do not at the same  time compare themselves with the ideal; rather they identify  themselves with the ideal.  I have met a tourist who had seen  the great Pyramid, and who told me that the Pyramid looked small.  Believe me, the tourist looked much smaller.  There is indeed another  type of traveller, who is not at"]]]
