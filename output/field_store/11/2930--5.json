Jesus is to be God's new Man leading man back on the road into the divine  image again, with full mastery of his masterly powers, and through mastery  into full dominion again; but the road back seems to be _contested_, and  the new Man gets badly scarred as He fights through and up to victory.          The Tragic Break in the Plan        <u>The Jerusalem Climate.</u>      Then _Jesus_ came. His coming was greeted with great gladness above, and  great silence below. Above, the stars sent a special messenger to bid Him  welcome to the earth they lightened and brightened. Below, the rusty  hinges of earth's inn refused to swing for Him. So man failing, the lower  creation shared room with Him.    Above, was the sweetest music, the music of heaven. Three times the music  of heaven is mentioned: at the creation, at this coming of Jesus, at the  coming crowning of Jesus in John's Revelation. Below, the only music was  that of the babe's holy young mother, God's chosen one to mother His Son,  crooning to her babe; and the gentle lowing in minor key of the oxen whose  stall He shared. Above, the great glory shining, the messenger of God  speaking a message of peace and love. Below, only darkness and silence.    Among the cultured leaders of the city of David, and of Solomon, and of  God's once glorified temple, there were no ears for the message, nor eyes  for the glory. They had gone deaf and blind Godward long before. To them  came no message, for no door was open. To simple men of nature who lived  with the stars and the hills and the sheep, came the new shining of the  glory, and the wondrous messenger and message. Their doors were open. They  practised looking up. Of course neither city nor country mattered, nor  matters. God always speaks into the upturned ear and looks into the  upturned face.    And so Jesus came. With all of its contrasts it was a winsome coming. A  pure young mother nursing her babe; the babe with its sweet wondrous face,  a fresh act of God indeed; the simple unselfish cattle; the bright stars;  the Glory shining; the sudden flood of music; the Lord's messenger; the  message--a very winsome coming.    He came into the peculiar climate of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is Judea. Out of  the Babylonian remnant of Israel had come great men, true leaders, with  great zeal for the city, and the temple, and the temple service, and for  the law. They made the mould in which this later Jerusalem was cast. But  that mould retaining its old form, had now become filled with the baser  metals. The high ideals of the new makers of the city had shrunk into mere  ideas. The small, strongly entrenched ruling circle were tenacious  sticklers for traditions as interpreted by themselves. That fine old word  conservative (with an underneath meaning of \"what we prefer\") was one of  their sweetest morsels. Underneath their great pride as Moses' successors,  the favored custodians of the nation's most sacred treasures, was a  passionate love for gold. The temple service was secretly organized on  the profit-sharing plan, with the larger share, as usual, for the  organizers.    That hardest thing in the whole range of human action to overcome, either  by God or man or the devil--prejudice--they had, in the Simon-pure form,  superlatively refined. The original treasure of God's Word was about as  much overlaid and hidden away by writings about it as--it has been in some  other times. Of course they were looking for a Messiah, the one hope of  their sacredly guarded literature. But He must be the sort that they  wanted, and--could use.    Herod the King was a man of great ability, great ambition, great passion,  and great absence of anything akin to conscience. But the virtual ruler  was the high priest. His office was bargained for, bought and sold for the  money and power it controlled in the way all too familiar to corrupt  political life in all times, and not wholly unknown in our own. The old  spiritual ideals of Moses, and Samuel, preached amid degeneracy by Elijah  and Isaiah, were buried away clear out of sight by mere formalism, though  still burning warm and tender in the hearts of a few. This was the  atmosphere of the old national capital into which Jesus came.        <u>The Bethlehem Fog.</u>      Then it was that Jesus came. Strange to say, there is a shadow over His  coming from the beginning. A gray chilling shadow of the sort of gray that  a stormy sky sometimes shows, gray tingeing into slaty black. Yet it was  the coming that made the shadow. It takes light, and some thick thing like  a block, and some distance for perspective, to make a shadow. The nearer  the light to the block thing the blacker the shadow. Here the light came  close to some thick blocks; of stupid thickness; human blocks grown more  toughly thick by the persistent resisting of any such transparent thing as  light.    This was a foggy shadow. A fog is always made by influences from below. A  lowering temperature chills the air, and brings down its moisture in the  shape of a gray subtle pervasive mist, that blurs the outlook, and often  gathers and holds black smoke, and mean poisonous odors and gases from bog  and swamp. Such a fog endangers both health and life. This was just such a  shadowing fog. There was a decided drop in the temperature, a sudden  chill, a fog formed that sucked up the poison of the marshes, and  threatened to stifle the baby breath of the new-born King.    A subtle, intangible, but terribly sure something haunts and hunts the  King from the first. His virgin mother is suspected by the one nearest her  of the most serious offense that can be charged against a woman. The  shadow that later grew to inky blackness came ahead of the man, and, under  the stable eaves, waited grimly His arrival. The feverish green of Herod's  eyes will be content with nothing but a new, bright, running red, and  plenty of it. Satan's plan of killing was started early. He was not  particular about the way it was done. The first attempt was at Bethlehem.  The venomous spittle oozed out there first. But he must move along natural  channels: just now, a murderous king's jealous dread of a possible rival.    The first hint of the actual coming of the long expected One is from the  star-students of the east. Their long journey and eager questioning bring  the birth of Jesus before the official circle of the nation. It is most  significant that His birth causes at once a special meeting of the  nation's ruling body. Herod was troubled, of course. But--all Jerusalem  was troubled _with_ him. Here is a surprising sympathy. It reflects at  once vividly the situation. It was strangely suggestive that news of their  King coning should trouble these national leaders. These devout  star-watchers are wise in the source of information they came to. These  leaders knew. They quickly pointed out the spot where the coming One  _should_ be born.    A pure virgin under cruel suspicion, a roomless inn, a village filled with  heart-broken mothers, a quick flight on a dark night to a foreign land by  a young mother and her babe, the stealthy retirement into a secluded spot  away from his native province, a fellow feeling between a red-handed king  and the nation's leaders--ugh! an ugly, deadly fog.        <u>The Man Sent Ahead.</u>      A high fence of silence shuts out from view the after years. Just one  chink of a crack appears in the fence, peering through which, one gets a  suggestion of beautiful simplicity, of the true, natural human growing  going on beyond the fence.    When mature years are reached, the royal procession is formed. A man is  sent ahead to tell of the King's coming. John was Jesus' diplomatic  representative, His plenipotentiary extraordinary; that is, the one man  specifically sent to represent Him to the nation whose King He was.  Treatment of John was treatment of Jesus. A slight done him was slighting  his sovereign Master. If Sir Henry Mortimer Durand were to be slighted or  treated discourteously by the American authorities, it would be felt at  London as a slight upon the King, the government, and the nation they  represent. Any indignity permitted to be done on American soil to von  Stuckenburg would be instantly resented by Kaiser William as personal to  himself. John was Jesus' Durand, His von Stuckenburg, His Whitelaw Reid.  And no diplomat ever used more tactful language than this John when  questioned about his Master. In Jesus' own simile, John was His _best  man_. Jesus was a bridegroom. John stood by His side as His most intimate  friend.    Jesus and John are constantly interwoven in the events of Jesus' career.  We moderns, who do everything by the calendar, have been puzzled in the  attempt to piece together these events into an exact calendar arrangement.  And the beautiful mosaic of the Gospels has been cut up to make a new,  modern, calendar mosaic. But these writers see things by _events_, not by  _dates_. They have in mind four great events, and about these their story  clusters. And in these Jesus and John are inextricably interwoven. First  is John's wilderness ministry, heading up in his presenting Jesus to the  nation. Then John's violent seizure, and Jesus' withdrawal from the danger  zone. Then John's death, and Jesus' increased caution in His movements.  Then Jesus' death. John comes, points to Jesus, and goes. Jesus comes,  walks a bit with John, reaches beyond him and then goes, too.    John baptized. That is, he used a purifying rite in connection with his  preaching. It helps to remember the distinction between baptism as  practised in the Christian Church, and as practised by John, and by Jesus  in His early ministry. In the church, baptism has come to be regarded as a  dedicatory rite by some, and by others an initial and confessional rite.  But in the first use of it, by John and Jesus, it was a purifying "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12814"],[0,"Philippine Folk Tales (#11)"],[1," me.\" And the  stone opened its mouth and swallowed the boy.    When his grandmother missed the boy, she went out and looked  everywhere, hoping to find him. Finally she passed near the stone  and it cried out, \"Here he is.\" Then the old woman tried to open the  stone but she could not, so she called the horses to come and help  her. They came and kicked it, but it would not break. Then she called  the carabao and they hooked it, but they only broke their horns. She  called the chickens, which pecked it, and the thunder, which shook it,  but nothing could open it, and she had to go home without the boy.        The Turtle and the Lizard    _Tinguian_      A turtle and a big lizard once went to the field of Gotgotapa to steal  ginger, [88] When they reached the place the turtle said to the lizard:    \"We must be very still or the man will hear us and come out.\"    But as soon as the lizard tasted the ginger he was so pleased that  he said:    \"The ginger of Gotgotapa is very good.\"    \"Be still,\" said the turtle; but the lizard paid no attention to the  warning, and called louder than ever:    \"The ginger of Gotgotapa is very good.\"    Again and again he cried out, until finally the man heard him and  came out of the house to catch the robbers.    The turtle could not run fast, so he lay very still, and the man did  not see him. But the lizard ran and the man chased him. When they  were out of sight, the turtle went into the house and hid under a  cocoanut shell upon which the man used to sit. [89]    The man ran after the lizard for a long distance, but he could not  catch him. After a while he came back to the house and sat down on  the shell.    By and by, the turtle called, \"Kook.\" The man jumped up and looked all  around. Unable to tell where the noise came from, he sat down again,    A second time the turtle called, and this time the man looked  everywhere in the house except under the shell, but could not find  the turtle. Again and again the turtle called, and finally the man,  realizing that all his attempts were unsuccessful, grew so excited  that he died.    Then the turtle ran out of the house, and he had not gone far before  he met the lizard again. They walked along together until they saw  some honey in a tree, and the turtle said:    \"I will go first and get some of the honey.\"    The lizard would not wait, but ran ahead, and when he seized the honey,  the bees came out and stung him. So he ran back to the turtle for help.    After a while they came to a bird snare, and the turtle said:    \"That is the silver wire that my grandfather wore about his neck.\"    Then the lizard ran fast to get it first, but he was caught in the  snare and was held until the man came and killed him. Then the wise  turtle went on alone.        The Man with the Cocoanuts    _Tinguian_      One day a man who had been to gather his cocoanuts loaded his horse  heavily with the fruit. On the way home he _met_ a boy whom he asked  how long it would take to reach the house.    \"If you go slowly,\" said the boy, looking at the load on the horse,  \"you will arrive very soon; but if you go fast, it will take you  all day.\"    The man could not believe this strange speech, so he hurried his  horse. But the cocoanuts fell off and he had to stop to pick them  up. Then he hurried his horse all the more to make up for lost time,  but the cocoanuts fell off again. Many times he did this, and it was  night when he reached home. [90]        The Carabao and the Shell    _Tinguian_      One very hot day, when a carabao went into the river to bathe, he  met a shell and they began talking together.    \"You are very slow,\" said the carabao to the shell.    \"Oh, no,\" replied the shell. \"I can beat you in a race.\"    \"Then let us try and see,\" said the carabao.    So they went out on the bank and started to run.    After the carabao had gone a long distance he stopped and called,  \"Shell!\"    And another shell lying by the river answered, \"Here I am!\"    Then the carabao, thinking that it was the same shell with which he  was racing, ran on.    By and by he stopped again and called, \"Shell!\"    Again another shell answered, \"Here I am!\"    The carabao was surprised that the shell could keep up with him. But  he ran on and on, and every time he stopped to call, another shell  answered him. But he was determined that the shell should not beat him,  so he ran until he dropped dead. [91]        The Alligator's Fruit    _Tinguian_      Two women went to gather some wild fruit from a vine which belonged  to the alligator.    \"You must be careful not to throw the rind with your teeth marks  on it where the alligator can see it,\" said one of the women to the  other as they sat eating the fruit.    But the other woman paid no attention and threw the rind showing  teeth marks into the river, where the alligator saw it.    Thus he knew at once who had taken his fruit, and he was very angry. He  went to the house of the woman and called to the people:    \"Bring out the woman that I may eat her, for she has eaten my fruit\"    \"Very well,\" answered the people. \"But sit down and wait a little  while.\"    Then they put the iron soil-turner into the fire, and when it was  red hot, they took it to the door and said to the alligator:    \"Here, eat this first.\"    He opened his mouth, and they pushed the red hot iron down his throat,  and he died.        Dogedog    _Tinguian_      Dogedog had always been very lazy, and now that his father and mother  were dead and he had no one to care for him, he lived very poorly. He  had little to eat. His house was old and small and so poor that it  had not even a floor. Still he would rather sit all day and idle away  his time than to work and have more things.    One day, however, when the rainy season was near at hand, Dogedog  began thinking how cold he would be when the storms came, and he felt  so sorry for himself that he decided to make a floor in his house.    Wrapping some rice in a banana leaf for his dinner, he took his long  knife and went to the forest to cut some bamboo. He hung the bundle  of rice in a tree until he should need it; but while he was working  a cat came and ate it. When the hungry man came for his dinner, there  was none left. Dogedog went back to his miserable little house which  looked forlorn to him even, now that he had decided to have a floor.    The next day he went again to the forest and hung his rice in the  tree as he did before, but again the cat came and ate it. So the man  had to go home without any dinner.    The third day he took the rice, but this time he fixed a trap in the  tree, and when the cat came it was caught.    \"Now I have you!\" cried the man when he found the cat; \"and I shall  kill you for stealing my rice.\"    \"Oh, do not kill me,\" pleaded the cat, \"and I will be of some use  to you.\"    So Dogedog decided to spare the cat's life, and he took it home and  tied it near the door to guard the house.    Some time later when he went to look at it, he was very much surprised  to find that it had become a cock.    \"Now I can go to the cock-fight at Magsingal,\" cried the man. And he  was very happy, for he had much rather do that than work.    Thinking no more of getting wood for his floor, he started out at  once for Magsingal with the cock under his arm. As he was crossing  a river he met an alligator which called out to him:    \"Where are you going, Dogedog?\"    \"To the cock-fight at Magsingal,\" replied the man as he fondly stroked  the rooster.    \"Wait, and I will go with you,\" said the alligator; and he drew  himself out of the water.    The two walking along together soon entered a forest where they met  a deer and it asked:    \"Where are you going, Dogedog?\"    \"To the cock-fight at Magsingal,\" said the man.    \"Wait and I will go with you,\" said the deer; and he also joined them.    By and by they met a mound of earth that had been raised by the ants,  and they would have passed without noticing it had it not inquired:    \"Where are you going, Dogedog?\"    \"To the cock-fight at Magsingal,\" said the man once more; and the  mound of earth joined them.    The company then hurried on, and just as they were leaving the forest,  they passed a big tree in which was a monkey.    \"Where are you going, Dogedog?\" shrieked the monkey. And without  waiting for an answer he scrambled down the tree and followed them.    As the party walked along they talked together, and the alligator  said to Dogedog:    \"If any man wants to dive into the water, I can stay under longer  than he.\"    Then the deer, not to be outdone, said:    \"If any man wants to run, I can run faster.\"    The mound of earth, anxious to show its strength, said:    \"If any man wants to wrestle, I can beat him.\"    And the monkey said:    \"If any man wants to climb, I can go higher.\"    They reached Magsingal in good time and the people were ready for the  fight to begin. When Dogedog put his rooster, which had been a cat,  into the pit, it killed the other cock at once, for it used its claws  like a cat.    The people brought more roosters and wagered much money, but Dogedog's  cock killed all the others until there was not one left in Magsingal,  and Dogedog won much money. Then they went outside the town and  brought all the cocks they could find, but not one could win over  that of Dogedog.    When the cocks were all dead, the people wanted some other sport,  so they brought a man who could stay under water for a long time,  and Dogedog made him compete with the alligator. But after a while  the man had to come up first Then they brought a swift runner and he  raced with the deer, but the man was left far behind. Next they looked  around until they found a very large man who was willing to contend  with the mound of earth, but after a hard struggle the man was thrown.    Finally they brought a man who could climb higher than anyone else,  but the monkey went far above him, and he had to give up.    All these"]]]
