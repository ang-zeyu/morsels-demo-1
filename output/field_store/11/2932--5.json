The Spanish ambassador met him at  court and asked him to dinner, where, over the wine, Hawkins assured him  that he was going out again next year. Meanwhile, however, the famous  Captain-General of the Indian trade, Don Pedro Menendez de Aviles, the  best naval officer that Spain perhaps has ever had, swooped down on the  French in Florida, killed them all, and built the fort of St. Augustine  to guard the 'Mountains of Bright Stones' somewhere in the hinterland.  News of this slaughter soon arrived at Madrid, whence orders presently  went out to have an eye on Hawkins, whom Spanish officials thenceforth  regarded as the leading interloper in New Spain.    Nevertheless Hawkins set out on his third and very 'troublesome' voyage  in 1567, backed by all his old and many new supporters, and with a  flotilla of six vessels, the _Jesus_, the _Minion_ (which then meant  darling), the _William and John_, the _Judith_, the _Angel_, and the  _Swallow_. This was the voyage that began those twenty years of sea-dog  fighting which rose to their zenith in the battle against the Armada;  and with this voyage Drake himself steps on to the stage as captain of  the _Judith_.    There had been a hitch in 1566, for the Spanish ambassador had reported  Hawkins's after-dinner speech to his king. Philip had protested to  Elizabeth, and Elizabeth had consulted with Cecil, afterwards 'the great  Lord Burleigh,' ancestor of the Marquis of Salisbury, British Prime  Minister during the Spanish-American War of 1898. The result was that  orders went down to Plymouth stopping Hawkins and binding him over, in a  bond of five hundred pounds, to keep the peace with Her Majesty's right  good friend King Philip of Spain. But in 1567 times had changed again,  and Hawkins sailed with colors flying, for Elizabeth was now as ready to  hurt Philip as he was to hurt her, provided always that open war was  carefully avoided.    But this time things went wrong from the first. A tremendous autumnal  storm scattered the ships. Then the first negroes that Hawkins tried to  'snare' proved to be like that other kind of prey of which the sarcastic  Frenchman wrote: 'This animal is very wicked; when you attack it, it  defends itself.' The 'envenomed arrows' of the negroes worked the  mischief. 'There hardly escaped any that had blood drawn of them, but  died in strange sort, with their mouths shut some ten days before they  died.' Hawkins himself was wounded, but, 'thanks be to God,' escaped  the lockjaw. After this the English took sides in a native war and  captured '250 persons, men, women, and children,' while their friend the  King captured '600 prisoners, whereof we hoped to have had our choice.  But the negro, in which nation is seldom or never found truth, that  night removed his camp and prisoners, so that we were fain to content  ourselves with those few we had gotten ourselves.'    However, with 'between 400 and 500 negroes,' Hawkins crossed over from  Africa to the West Indies and 'coasted from place to place, making our  traffic with the Spaniards as we might, somewhat hardly, because the  King had straitly commanded all his governors by no means to suffer any  trade to be made with us. Notwithstanding, we had reasonable trade, and  courteous entertainment' for a good part of the way. In Rio de la Hacha  the Spaniards received the English with a volley that killed a couple of  men, whereupon the English smashed in the gates, while the Spaniards  retired. But, after this little bit of punctilio, trade went on under  cover of night so briskly that two hundred negroes were sold at good  prices. From there to Cartagena 'the inhabitants were glad of us and  traded willingly,' supply being short and demand extra high.    Then came a real rebuff from the governor of Cartagena, followed by a  terrific storm 'which so beat the _Jesus_ that we cut down all her  higher buildings' (deck superstructures). Then the course was shaped for  Florida. But a new storm drove the battered flotilla back to 'the port  which serveth the city of Mexico, called St. John de Ulua,' the modern  Vera Cruz. The historic Vera Cruz was fifteen miles north of this  harbor. Here 'thinking us to be the fleet of Spain, the chief officers  of the country came aboard us. Which, being deceived of their  expectation, were greatly dismayed; but ... when they saw our demand was  nothing but victuals, were recomforted. I [for it is Hawkins's own  story] found in the same port 12 ships which had in them by report  L200,000 in gold and silver, all which, being in my possession [i.e., at  my mercy] with the King's Island ... I set at liberty.'    What was to be done? Hawkins had a hundred negroes still to sell. But it  was four hundred miles to Mexico City and back again; and a new Spanish  viceroy was aboard the big Spanish fleet that was daily expected to  arrive in this very port. If a permit to sell came back from the capital  in time, well and good. If no more than time to replenish stores was  allowed, good enough, despite the loss of sales. But what if the Spanish  fleet arrived? The 'King's Island' was a low little reef right in the  mouth of the harbor, which it all but barred. Moreover, no vessel could  live through a northerly gale inside the harbor--the only one on that  coast--unless securely moored to the island itself. Consequently whoever  held the island commanded the situation altogether.    There was not much time for consultation; for the very next morning 'we  saw open of the haven 13 great ships, the fleet of Spain.' It was a  terrible predicament. '_Now_, said I, _I am in two dangers, and forced  to receive the one of them_.... Either I must have kept out the fleet,  which, with God's help, I was very well able to do, or else suffer them  to enter with their accustomed treason.... If I had kept them out, then  there had been present shipwreck of all that fleet, which amounted in  value to six millions, which was in value of our money L1,800,000, which  I considered I was not able to answer, fearing the Queen's Majesty's  indignation.... Thus with myself revolving the doubts, I thought better  to abide the jut of the uncertainty than of the certainty.' So, after  conditions had been agreed upon and hostages exchanged, the thirteen  Spanish ships sailed in. The little island remained in English hands;  and the Spaniards were profuse in promises.    But, having secretly made their preparations, the Spaniards, who were in  overwhelming numbers, suddenly set upon the English by land and sea.  Every Englishman ashore was killed, except a few who got off in a boat  to the _Jesus_. The _Jesus_ and the _Minion_ cut their headfasts, hauled  clear by their sternfasts, drove back the boarding parties, and engaged  the Spanish fleet at about a hundred yards. Within an hour the Spanish  flagship and another were sunk, a third vessel was burning furiously,  fore and aft, while every English deck was clear of enemies. But the  Spaniards had swarmed on to the island from all sides and were firing  into the English hulls at only a few feet from the cannon's mouth.  Hawkins was cool as ever. Calling for a tankard of beer he drank to the  health of the gunners, who accounted for most of the five hundred and  forty men killed on the Spanish side. 'Stand by your ordnance lustily,'  he cried, as he put the tankard down and a round shot sent it flying.  'God hath delivered me,' he added, 'and so will He deliver you from  these traitors and villains.'    The masts of the _Jesus_ went by the board and her old, strained timbers  splintered, loosened up, and were stove in under the storm of cannon  balls. Hawkins then gave the order to abandon ship after taking out what  stores they could and changing her berth so that she would shield the  little _Minion_. But while this desperate manoeuvre was being executed  down came two fire-ships. Some of the _Minion's_ crew then lost their  heads and made sail so quickly that Hawkins himself was nearly left  behind.    The only two English vessels that escaped were the _Minion_ and the  _Judith_. When nothing else was left to do, Hawkins shouted to Drake to  lay the _Judith_ aboard the _Minion_, take in all the men and stores he  could, and put to sea. Drake, then only twenty-three, did this with  consummate skill. Hawkins followed some time after and anchored just out  of range. But Drake had already gained an offing that caused the two  little vessels to part company in the night, during which a whole gale  from the north sprang up, threatening to put the _Judith_ on a lee  shore. Drake therefore fought his way to windward; and, seeing no one  when the gale abated, and having barely enough stores to make a friendly  land, sailed straight home. Hawkins reported the _Judith_, without  mentioning Drake's name, as 'forsaking' the _Minion_. But no other  witness thought Drake to blame.    Hawkins himself rode out the gale under the lee of a little island, then  beat about for two weeks of increasing misery, when 'hides were thought  very good meat, and rats, cats, mice, and dogs, parrots and monkeys that  were got at great price, none escaped.' The _Minion_ was of three  hundred tons; and so was insufferably overcrowded with three hundred  men, two hundred English and one hundred negroes. Drake's little  _Judith_, of only fifty tons, could have given no relief, as she was  herself overfull. Hawkins asked all the men who preferred to take their  chance on land to get round the foremast and all those who wanted to  remain afloat to get round the mizzen. About a hundred chose one course  and a hundred the other. The landing took place about a hundred and  fifty miles south of the Rio Grande. The shore party nearly all died.  But three lived to write of their adventures.

Every advance  which one man makes, human nature, in its entirety, makes with him.    Here, where the petty, narrow self of the person is already  annihilated by the Polity, every one loves every other one as truly as  himself, as a component part of that great _Self_ which alone remains  for him to love, and of which he is nothing but a component part,  which only through the Whole can gain or lose. Here the conflict of  evil with good is done away, for no evil can any longer spring up.  The contest of the good among themselves, even concerning the good,  vanishes, now that it has become easy to them to love the good for its  own sake, and not for their sakes, as the authors of it--now that the  only interest they can have is that it come to pass, that truth  be discovered, that the good deed be executed--not by whom it is  accomplished. Here every one is always prepared to join his power to  that of his neighbor, and to subordinate it to that of his neighbor.  Whoever, in the judgment of all, shall accomplish the best, in the  best way, him all will support and partake with equal joy in his  success.    This is the aim of earthly existence which Reason sets before us, and  for the sure attainment of which Reason vouches. It is not a goal for  which we are to strive merely that our faculties may be exercised on  something great, but which we must relinquish all hope of realizing.  It shall and must be realized. At some time or other this goal must be  attained, as surely as there is a world of the senses, and a race of  reasonable beings in time, for whom no serious and rational object can  be imagined but this, and whose existence is made intelligible by this  alone. Unless the whole life of man is to be considered as the sport  of an evil Spirit, who implanted this ineradicable striving after  the imperishable in the breasts of poor wretches merely that he might  enjoy their ceaseless struggle after that which unceasingly flees  from them, their still repeated grasping after that which still  eludes their grasp, their restless driving about in an ever-returning  circle--and laugh at their earnestness in this senseless sport--unless  the wise man, who must soon see through this game and be tired of his  own part in it, is to throw away his life, and the moment of awakening  reason is to be the moment of earthly death--that goal must be  attained. O it is attainable in life and by means of life; for Reason  commands me to live. It is attainable, for I am.          III    But now, when it is attained, when Humanity shall stand at the  goal--what then? There is no higher condition on earth than that.  The generation which first attains it can do nothing further than to  persist in it, maintain it with all their powers, and die and leave  descendants who shall do the same that they have done, and who, in  their turn, shall leave descendants that shall do the same. Humanity  would then stand still in its course. Therefore its earthly goal  cannot be its highest goal, for this earthly goal is intelligible, and  attainable, and finite. Though we consider the preceding generations  as means of developing the last and perfected, still we cannot escape  the inquiry of earnest Reason: \"Wherefore then these last?\" Given a  human race on the earth, its existence must indeed be in accordance  with Reason, and not contrary to it. It must become all that it can  become on earth. But why should it exist at all--this human race? Why  might it not as well have remained in the womb of the Nothing? Reason  is not for the sake of existence, but existence for the sake of  Reason. An existence which does not, in itself, satisfy Reason and  solve all her questions, cannot possibly be the true one.    Then, too, are the actions commanded by the voice of Conscience, whose  dictates I must not speculate about, but obey in silence--are they  actually the means, and the only means, of accomplishing the earthly  aim of mankind? That I cannot refer them to any other object but this,  that I can have no other intent with them, is unquestionable. But is  this, my intent, fulfilled in every case? Is nothing more needed but  to will the best, in order that it may be accomplished? Alas! most of  our good purposes are, for this world, entirely lost, and some of  them seem even to have an entirely opposite effect to that which was  proposed. On the other hand, the most despicable passions of men,  their vices and their misdeeds, seem often to bring about the good  more surely than the labors of the just man, who never consents to do  evil that good may come. It would seem that the highest good of the  world grows and thrives quite independently of all human virtues or  vices, according to laws of its own, by some invisible and unknown  power, just as the heavenly bodies run through their appointed course,  independently of all human effort; and that this power absorbs into  its own higher plan all human designs, whether good or ill, and,  by its superior strength, appropriates what was intended for other  purposes to its own ends.    If, therefore, the attainment of that earthly goal could be the design  of our existence, and if no further question concerning it remained  to Reason, that aim, at least, would not be ours, but the aim of that  unknown Power. We know not at any moment what may promote it. Nothing  would be left us but to supply to that Power, by our actions, so much  material, no matter what, to work up in its own way, for its own ends.  Our highest wisdom would be, not to trouble ourselves about things  in which we have no concern, but to live, in each case, as the fancy  takes us, and quietly leave the consequences to that Power. The moral  law within us would be idle and superfluous, and wholly unsuited to a  being that had no higher capacity and no higher destination. In order  to be at one with ourselves, we should refuse obedience to the voice  of that law and suppress it as a perverse and mad enthusiasm.           *       *       *       *       *    If the whole design of our existence were to bring about a purely  earthly condition of our race, all that would be required would be  some infallible mechanism to direct our action; and we need be nothing  more than wheels well fitted to the whole machine. Freedom would then  not only be useless, but even contrary to the purpose of existence;  and good-will would be quite superfluous. The world, in that case,  would be very clumsily contrived--would proceed to its goal with waste  of power and by circuitous paths. Rather, mighty World-Spirit, hadst  thou taken from us this freedom, which, only with difficulty and by a  different arrangement, thou canst fit to thy plans, and compelled us  at once to act as those plans required! Thou wouldst then arrive at  thy goal by the shortest road, as the meanest of the inhabitants of  thy worlds can tell thee.    But I am free, and therefore such a concatenation of cause and effect,  in which freedom is absolutely superfluous and useless, cannot exhaust  my whole destination. I must be free; for not the mechanical act, but  the free determination of free-will, for the sake of the command  alone and absolutely for no other purpose (so says the inward voice of  conscience)--this alone determines our true worth. The band with which  the law binds me is a band for living spirits. It scorns to rule  over dead mechanism, and applies itself alone to the living and  self-acting. Such obedience it demands. This obedience cannot be  superfluous.    And, herewith, the eternal world rises more brightly before me, and  the fundamental law of its order stands clear before the eye of my  mind. In that world the _will_, purely and only, as it lies, locked up  from all eyes, in the secret dark of my soul, is the first link in a  chain of consequences which runs through the whole invisible world  of spirits; so in the earthly world the _deed_, a certain movement  of matter, becomes the first link in a material chain which extends  through the whole system of matter. The will is the working and living  principle in the world of Reason, as motion is the working and living  principle in the world of the senses. I stand in the centre of two  opposite worlds, a visible in which the deed, and an invisible,  altogether incomprehensible, in which the will, decides. I am one  of the original forces for both these worlds. My will is that which  embraces both. This will is in and of itself a constituent portion of  the supersensuous world. When I put it in motion by a resolution, I  move and change something in that world, and my activity flows on over  the whole and produces something new and ever-during which then exists  and needs not to be made anew. This will breaks forth into a material  act, and this act belongs to the world of the senses, and effects, in  that, what it can.    I have not to wait until after I am divorced from the connection  of the earthly world to gain admission into that which is above  the earth. I am and live in it already, far more truly than in the  earthly. Even now it is my only firm standing-ground, and the eternal  life, which I have long since taken possession of, is the only  reason why I am willing still to prolong the earthly. That which  they denominate Heaven lies not beyond the grave. It is already here,  diffused around our Nature, and its light arises in every pure heart.  My will is mine, and it is the only thing that is entirely mine and  depends entirely upon myself. By it I am already a citizen of the  kingdom of liberty and of self-active Reason. My conscience, the tie  by which that world holds me unceasingly and binds me to itself, tells  me at every moment what determination of"]]]
