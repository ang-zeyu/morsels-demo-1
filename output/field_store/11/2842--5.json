In these national  conventions were the regal offices conferred. Every individual had a  voice on the occasion, and every individual was free. The person upon  whom the general approbation appeared to fall, was immediately advanced  to pre-eminence in the state. He was uniformly one, whose actions had  made him eminent; whose conduct had gained him previous applause; whose  valour the very assembly, that elected him, had themselves witnessed in  the field; whose prudence, wisdom and justice, having rendered him  signally serviceable, had endeared him to his tribe. For this reason,  their kingdoms were not hereditary; the son did not always inherit the  virtues of the sire; and they were determined that he alone should  possess authority, in whose virtues they could confide. Nor was this  all. So sensible were they of the important sacrifice they had made; so  extremely jealous even of the name of superiority and power, that they  limited, by a variety of laws, the authority of the very person, whom  they had just elected, from a confidence of his integrity; Ambiorix  himself confessing, \"that his people had as much power over him, as he  could possibly have over his people.\"    The same custom, as appears from Tacitus, prevailed also among the  Germans. They had their national councils, like the Gauls; in which the  regal and ducal offices were confirmed according to the majority of  voices. They elected also, on these occasions, those only, whom their  virtue, by repeated trial, had unequivocally distinguished from the  rest; and they limited their authority so far, as neither to leave them  the power of inflicting imprisonment or stripes, nor of exercising any  penal jurisdiction. But as punishment was necessary in a state of civil  society, \"it was permitted to the priests alone, that it might appear to  have been inflicted, by the order of the gods, and not by any superiour  authority in man.\"    The accounts which we have thus given of the ancient Germans and Gauls,  will be found also to be equally true of those people, which had arrived  at the same state of subordinate society. We might appeal, for a  testimony of this, to the history of the Goths; to the history of the  Franks and Saxons; to, the history, in short, of all those nations, from  which the different governments, now conspicuous in Europe, have  undeniably sprung. And we might appeal, as a farther proof, to the  Americans, who are represented by many of the moderns, from their own  ocular testimony, as observing the same customs at the present day.    It remains only to observe, that as these customs prevailed among the  different nations described, in their early state of subordinate  society, and as they were moreover the customs of their respective  ancestors, it appears that they must have been handed down, both by  tradition and use, from the first introduction of _government_.             *        *        *        *        *        CHAP. III.    We may now deduce those general maxims concerning _subordination_,  and _liberty_, which we mentioned to have been essentially  connected with the subject, and which some, from speculation only, and  without any allusion to facts, have been bold enough to deny.    It appears first, that _liberty_ is a _natural_, and  _government_ an _adventitious_ right, because all men were  originally free.    It appears secondly, that government is a [042]_contract_ because,  in these primeval subordinate societies, we have seen it voluntarily  conferred on the one hand, and accepted on the other. We have seen it  subject to various restrictions. We have seen its articles, which could  then only be written by tradition and use, as perfect and binding as  those, which are now committed to letters. We have seen it, in short,  partaking of the _federal_ nature, as much as it could in a state,  which wanted the means of recording its transactions.    It appear thirdly, that the grand object of the _contrast_, is the  _happiness_ of the people; because they gave the supremacy to him  alone, who had been conspicuous for the splendour of his abilities, or  the integrity of his life: that the power of the multitude being  directed by the _wisdom_ and _justice_ of the prince, they  might experience the most effectual protection from injury, the highest  advantages of society, the greatest possible _happiness_.             *        *        *        *        *      FOOTNOTES      [Footnote 042: The author has lately read a work, intitled Paley's Moral  and Political Philosophy, which, in this one respect, favours those  which have been hinted at, as it denies that government was a contract.  \"No social compact was ever made in fact,\"--\"it is to suppose it  possible to call savages out of caves and deserts, to deliberate upon  topicks, which the experience and studies, and the refinements of civil  life alone suggest. Therefore no government in the universe begun from  this original.\" But there are no grounds for so absurd a supposition;  for government, and of course the social compact, does not appear to  have been introduced at the time, when families coming out of their  caves and deserts, or, in other words, quitting their former  _dissociated_ state, joined themselves together. They had lived a  considerable time in _society_, like the Lybians and Gaetulians  before-mentioned, and had felt many of the disadvantages of a want of  discipline and laws, before government was introduced at all. The author  of this Essay, before he took into consideration the origin of  government, was determined, in a matter of such importance, to be  biassed by no opinion whatever, and much less to indulge himself in  speculation. He was determined solely to adhere to fact, and, by looking  into the accounts left us of those governments which were in their  infancy, and, of course in the least complicated state, to attempt to  discover their foundation: he cannot say therefore, that upon a very  minute perusal of the excellent work before quoted, he has been so far  convinced, as to retract in the least from his sentiments on this head,  and to give up maxims, which are drawn from historical facts, for those,  which are the result of speculation. He may observe here, that whether  government was a _contract_ or not, it will not affect the  reasoning of the present Essay; since where ever the contract is  afterwards mentioned, it is inferred only that its object was \"the  _happiness of the people_,\" which is confessedly the end of  government. Notwithstanding this, he is under the necessity of inserting  this little note, though he almost feels himself ungrateful in  contradicting a work, which has afforded him so much entertainment.]             *        *        *        *        *        CHAP. IV.    Having now collected the materials that are necessary for the  prosecution of our design, we shall immediately enter upon the  discussion.    If any man had originally been endued with power, as with other  faculties, so that the rest of mankind had discovered in themselves an  _innate necessity_ of obeying this particular person; it is evident  that he and his descendants, from the superiority of their nature, would  have had a claim upon men for obedience, and a natural right to command:  but as the right to empire is _adventitious_; as all were  originally free; as nature made every man's body and mind _his  own_; it is evident that no just man can be consigned to  _slavery_, without his own _consent_.    Neither can men, by the same principles, be considered as lands, goods,  or houses, among _possessions_. It is necessary that all  _property_ should be inferiour to its _possessor_. But how  does the _slave_ differ from his _master_, but by _chance_?  For though the mark, with which the latter is pleased to  brand him, shews, at the first sight, the difference of their  _fortune_; what mark can be found in his _nature_, that can  warrant a distinction?    To this consideration we shall add the following, that if men can justly  become the property of each other, their children, like the offspring of  cattle, must inherit their _paternal_ lot. Now, as the actions of  the father and the child must be thus at the sole disposal of their  common master, it is evident, that the _authority_ of the one, as a  _parent_, and the _duty_ of the other, as a _child_, must  be instantly annihilated; rights and obligations, which, as they are  sounded in nature, are implanted in our feelings, and are established by  the voice of God, must contain in their annihilation a solid argument to  prove, that there cannot be any _property_ whatever in the _human  species_.    We may consider also, as a farther confirmation, that it is impossible,  in the nature of things, that _liberty_ can be _bought_ or  _sold_! It is neither _saleable_, nor _purchasable_. For  if any one man can have an absolute property in the liberty of another,  or, in other words, if he, who is called a _master_, can have a  _just_ right to command the actions of him, who is called a  _slave_, it is evident that the latter cannot be accountable for  those crimes, which the former may order him to commit. Now as every  reasonable being is accountable for his actions, it is evident, that  such a right cannot _justly_ exist, and that human liberty, of  course, is beyond the possibility either of _sale_ or _purchase_.  Add to this, that, whenever you sell the liberty of a man,  you have the power only of alluding to the _body_: the _mind_  cannot be confined or bound: it will be free, though its  mansion be beset with chains. But if, in every sale of the _human  species_, you are under the necessity of considering your slave in  this abstracted light; of alluding only to the body, and of making no  allusion to the mind; you are under the necessity also of treating him,  in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10633"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#11)"],[1,"been  necessary precursors in it. And here it may be proper to observe, that  it is by no means necessary that all these should have been themselves  actors in the production of this great event. Persons have contributed  towards it in different ways:--Some have written expressly on the  subject, who have had no opportunity of promoting it by personal  exertions. Others have only mentioned it incidentally in their writings.  Others, in an elevated rank and station, have cried out publicly  concerning it, whose sayings have been recorded. All these, however, may  be considered as necessary forerunners in their day; for all of them  have brought the subject more or less into notice. They have more or  less enlightened the mind upon it; they have more or less impressed it;  and therefore each may be said to have had his share in diffusing and  keeping up a certain portion of knowledge and feeling concerning it,  which has been eminently useful in the promotion of the cause.    It is rather remarkable, that the first forerunners and coadjutors  should have been men in power.    So early as in the year 1503, a few slaves had been sent from the  Portuguese settlements in Africa into the Spanish colonies in America.  In 1511, Ferdinand the Fifth, king of Spain, permitted them to be  carried in great numbers. Ferdinand, however, must have been ignorant in  these early times of the piratical manner in which the Portuguese had  procured them. He could have known nothing of their treatment when in  bondage, nor could he have viewed the few uncertain adventurous  transportations of them into his dominions in the western world, in the  light of a regular trade. After his death, however; a proposal was made  by Bartholomew de las Casas, the bishop of Chiapa, to Cardinal Ximenes,  who held the reigns of the government of Spain till Charles the Fifth  came to the throne, for the establishment of a regular system of  commerce in the persons of the native Africans. The object of  Bartholomew de las Casas was undoubtedly to save the American Indians,  whose cruel treatment and almost extirpation he had witnessed during his  residence among them, and in whose behalf he had undertaken a voyage to  the court of Spain. It is difficult to reconcile this proposal with the  humane and charitable spirit of the bishop of Chiapa. But it is probable  he believed that a code of laws would soon be established in favour both  of Africans and of the natives in the Spanish settlements, and that he  flattered himself that, being about to return and to live in the country  of their slavery, he could look to the execution of it. The cardinal,  however, with a foresight, a benevolence, and a justice which will  always do honour to his memory, refused the proposal, not only judging  it to be unlawful to consign innocent people to slavery at all, but to  be very inconsistent to deliver the inhabitants of one country from a  state of misery by consigning to it those of another. Ximenes,  therefore, may be considered as one of the first great friends of the  Africans after the partial beginning of the trade.    This answer of the cardinal, as it showed his virtue as an individual,  so was it peculiarly honourable to him as a public man, and ought to  operate as a lesson to other statesmen, how they admit any thing new  among political regulations and establishments, which is connected in  the smallest degree with injustice; for evil, when once sanctioned by  governments, spreads in a tenfold degree, and may, unless seasonably  checked, become so ramified as to effect the reputation of a country,  and to render its own removal scarcely possible without detriment to the  political concerns of the state. In no instance has this been verified  more than in the case of the Slave Trade. Never was our national  character more tarnished, and our prosperity more clouded by guilt.  Never was there a monster more difficult to subdue. Even they, who heard  as it were the shrieks of oppression, and wished to assist the  sufferers, were fearful of joining in their behalf. While they  acknowledged the necessity of removing one evil, they were terrified by  the prospect of introducing another; and were, therefore, only able to  relieve their feelings by, lamenting, in the bitterness of their hearts,  that this traffic had ever been begun at all.    After the death of Cardinal Ximenes, the emperor Charles the Fifth, who  had come into power, encouraged the Slave Trade. In 1517, he granted a  patent to one of his Flemish favourites, containing an exclusive right  of importing four thousand Africans into America. But he lived long  enough to repent of what he had thus inconsiderately done; for in the  year 1542, he made a code of laws for the better protection of the  unfortunate Indians in his foreign dominions, and he stopped the  progress of African slavery by an order that all slaves in his American  islands should he made free. This order was executed by Pedro de la  Gasca. Manumission took place as well in Hispaniola as on the Continent;  but on the return of Gasca to Spain, and the retirement of Charles into  a monastery, slavery was revived.    It is impossible to pass over this instance of the abolition of slavery  by Charles, in all his foreign dominions, without some comments. It  shows him, first, to have been a friend both to the Indians and the  Africans, as a part of the human race; it shows he was ignorant of what  he was doing when he gave his sanction to this cruel trade; it shows  when legislators give one set of men undue power over another, how  quickly they abuse it, or he never would have found himself obliged, in  the short space of twenty-five years, to undo that which he had  countenanced as a great state measure; and while it confirms the former  lesson to statesmen of watching the beginnings or principles of things  in their political movements, it should teach them never to persist in  the support of evils, through the false shame of being obliged to  confess that they had once given them their sanction, nor to delay the  cure of them because, politically speaking, neither this nor that is the  proper season; but to do them away instantly, as there can only be one  fit or proper time in the eye of religion, namely, on the conviction of  their existence.    From the opinions of Cardinal Ximenes and of the emperor Charles the  Fifth, I hasten to that which was expressed much about the same time, in  a public capacity, by Pope Leo the Tenth. The Dominicans in Spanish  America, witnessing the cruel treatment which the slaves underwent  there, considered slavery as utterly repugnant to the principles of the  gospel, and recommended the abolition of it. The Franciscans did not  favour the former in this their scheme of benevolence; and the  consequence was, that a controversy on this subject sprung up between  them, which was carried to this pope for his decision. Leo exerted  himself, much to his honour, in behalf of the poor sufferers, and  declared \"That not only the Christian religion, but that Nature herself  cried out against a state of slavery.\" This answer was certainly worthy  of one who was deemed the head of the Christian Church. It must,  however, be confessed that it would have been strange if Leo, in his  situation as pontiff, had made a different reply. He could never have  denied that God was no respecter of persons. He must have acknowledged  that men were bound to love each other as brethren; and, if he admitted  the doctrine that all men were accountable for their actions hereafter,  he could never have prevented the deduction that it was necessary they  should be free. Nor could he, as a man of high attainments, living early  in the sixteenth century, have been ignorant of what had taken place in  the twelfth; or that, by the latter end of this latter century,  christianity had obtained the undisputed honour of having extirpated  slavery from the western part of the European world.    From Spain and Italy I come to England. The first importation of slaves  from Africa, by our countrymen, was in the reign of Elizabeth, in the  year 1562. This great princess seems on the very commencement of the  trade to have questioned its lawfulness. She seems to have entertained a  religious scruple concerning it; and, indeed, to have revolted at the  very thought of it. She seems to have been aware of the evils to which  its continuance might lead, or that, if it were sanctioned, the most  unjustifiable means might be made use of to procure the persons of the  natives of Africa. And in what light she would have viewed any acts of  this kind, had they taken place, we may conjecture from this fact,--that  when Captain (afterwards Sir John) Hawkins returned from his first  voyage to Africa and Hispaniola, whither he had carried slaves, she sent  for him, and, as we learn from Hill's _Naval History_ expressed her  concern lest any of the Africans should be carried off without their  free consent, declaring that \"it would be detestable, and call down the  vengeance of heaven upon the undertakers.\" Captain Hawkins promised to  comply with the injunctions of Elizabeth in this respect, but he did not  keep his word; for when he went to Africa again, he seized many of the  inhabitants and carried them off as slaves, which occasioned Hill, in  the account he gives of his second voyage, to use these remarkable  words:--\"Here began the horrid practice of forcing the Africans into  slavery, an injustice and barbarity which, so sure as there is vengeance  in heaven for the worst of crimes, will some time be the destruction of  all who allow or encourage it.\" That the trade should have been suffered  to continue under such a princess, and after such solemn expressions as  those which she has been described to have uttered, can be only  attributed to the pains taken by those concerned in it to keep her  ignorant of the truth.
