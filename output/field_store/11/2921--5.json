Now for a leap into the abyss, which won't be so terrifying, since  it involves no change of method. The cube must move into the fourth  dimension, developing there a hyper-cube. This is impossible, for  the reason the cube would have to move out of our space  altogether--three-dimensional space will not contain a hyper-cube. But  neither is the cube itself contained within the plane of the paper;  it is only there _represented_. The y direction had to be imagined and  then arbitrarily established; we can arbitrarily establish the fourth  direction in the same way. As this is at right angles to y, its  indication may be diagonally downward and to the left--the direction  z. As y is known to be at right angles both to w and to x, z is at  right angles to all three, and we have thus established the four  mutually perpendicular axes necessary to complete the figure.    The cube must now move in the z direction (the fourth dimension)  a distance equal to the length of one of its sides. Just as we did  previously in the case of the square, we draw the cube in its new  position (ABB'D'C'C) and also as before we connect each apex of the  first cube with the corresponding apex of the other, because each of  these points generates a line (an edge), each line a plane, and  each plane a solid. This is the tesseract or hyper-cube in plane  projection. It has the 16 points, 32 lines, and 8 cubes known to  compose the figure. These cubes occur in pairs, and may be readily  identified.[1]    The tesseract as portrayed in A, Figure 14, is shown according to the  conventions of oblique, or two-point perspective; it can equally be  represented in a manner correspondent to parallel perspective. The  parallel perspective of a cube appears as a square inside another  square, with lines connecting the four vertices of the one with those  of the other. The third dimension (the one beyond the plane of the  paper) is here conceived of as being not beyond the boundaries of the  first square, but _within_ them. We may with equal propriety conceive  of the fourth dimension as a \"beyond which is within.\" In that case  we would have a rendering of the tesseract as shown in B, Figure 14:  a cube within a cube, the space between the two being occupied by six  truncated pyramids, each representing a cube. The large outside cube  represents the original generating cube at the beginning of its motion  into the fourth dimension, and the small inside cube represents it at  the end of that motion.    [Illustration: PLATE XIII. IMAGINARY COMPOSITION: THE AUDIENCE  CHAMBER]    These two projections of the tesseract upon plane space are not the  only ones possible, but they are typical. Some idea of the variety of  aspects may be gained by imagining how a nest of inter-related cubes  (made of wire, so as to interpenetrate), combined into a single  symmetrical figure of three-dimensional space, would appear  from several different directions. Each view would yield new  space-subdivisions, and all would be rhythmical--susceptible,  therefore, of translation into ornament. C and D represent such  translations of A and B.    In order to fix these unfamiliar ideas more firmly in the reader's  mind, let him submit himself to one more exercise of the creative  imagination, and construct, by a slightly different method, a  representation of a hexadecahedroid, or 16-hedroid, on a plane. This  regular solid of four-dimensional space consists of sixteen cells,  each a regular tetrahedron, thirty-two triangular faces, twenty-four  edges and eight vertices. It is the correlative of the octahedron of  three-dimensional space.    First it is necessary to establish our four axes, all mutually  at right angles. If we draw three lines intersecting at a point,  subtending angles of 60 degrees each, it is not difficult to  conceive of these lines as being at right angles with one another  in three-dimensional space. The fourth axis we will assume to pass  vertically through the point of intersection of the three lines,  so that we see it only in cross-section, that is, as a point. It is  important to remember that all of the angles made by the four axes  are right angles--a thing possible only in a space of four dimensions.  Because the 16-hedroid is a symmetrical hyper-solid all of its  eight apexes will be equidistant from the centre of a containing  hyper-sphere, whose \"surface\" these will intersect at symmetrically  disposed points. These apexes are established in our representation by  describing a circle--the plane projection of the hyper-sphere--about  the central point of intersection of the axes. (Figure 15, left.)  Where each of these intersects the circle an apex of the 16-hedroid  will be established. From each apex it is now necessary to draw  straight lines to every other, each line representing one edge of the  sixteen tetrahedral cells. But because the two ends of the fourth axis  are directly opposite one another, and opposite the point of sight,  all of these lines fail to appear in the left hand diagram. It  therefore becomes necessary to _tilt_ the figure slightly, bringing  into view the fourth axis, much foreshortened, and with it, all of the  lines which make up the figure. The result is that projection of the  16-hedroid shown at the right of Figure 15.[2] Here is no fortuitous  arrangement of lines and areas, but the \"shadow\" cast by an  archetypal, figure of higher space upon the plane of our materiality.  It is a wonder, a mystery, staggering to the imagination,  contradictory to experience, but as well entitled to a place at the  high court of reason as are any of the more familiar figures with  which geometry deals. Translated into ornament it produces such an  all-over pattern as is shown in Figure 16 and the design which adorns  the curtains at right and left of pl. XIII. There are also other  interesting projections of the 16-hedroid which need not be gone into  here.    [Illustration: Figure 15. DIRECT VIEW AXES SHOWN BY HEAVY LINES TILTED  VIEW APEXES SHOWN BY CIRCLES THE 16-HEDROID IN PLANE PROJECTION]    For if the author has been successful in his exposition up to  this point, it should be sufficiently plain that the geometry  of four-dimensions is capable of yielding fresh and interesting  ornamental motifs. In carrying his demonstration farther, and in  multiplying illustrations, he would only be going over ground already  covered in his book _Projective Ornament_ and in his second Scammon  lecture.    Of course this elaborate mechanism for producing quite obvious and  even ordinary decorative motifs may appear to some readers like  Goldberg's nightmare mechanics, wherein the most absurd and intricate  devices are made to accomplish the most simple ends. The author is  undisturbed by such criticisms. If the designs dealt with in this  chapter are \"obvious and even ordinary\" they are so for the reason  that they were chosen less with an eye to their interest and beauty  than as lending themselves to development and demonstration by an  orderly process which should not put too great a tax upon the patience  and intelligence of the reader. Four-dimensional geometry yields  numberless other patterns whose beauty and interest could not possibly  be impeached--patterns beyond the compass of the cleverest designer  unacquainted with projective geometry.    [Illustration: Figure 16.]    The great need of the ornamentalist is this or some other solid  foundation. Lacking it, he has been forced to build either on the  shifting sands of his own fancy, or on the wrecks and sediment of the  past. Geometry provides this sure foundation. We may have to work hard  and dig deep, but the results will be worth the effort, for only on  such a foundation can arise a temple which is beautiful and strong.    In confirmation of his general contention that the basis of all  effective decoration is geometry and number, the author, in closing,  desires to direct the reader's attention to Figure 17 a slightly  modified rendering of the famous zodiacal ceiling of the Temple of  Denderah, in Egypt. A sun and its corona have been substituted for the  zodiacal signs and symbols which fill the centre of the original, for  except to an Egyptologist these are meaningless. In all essentials the  drawing faithfully follows the original--was traced, indeed, from a  measured drawing.    [Illustration: Figure 17. CEILING DECORATION FROM THE TEMPLE OF  DENDERAH]    Here is one of the most magnificent decorative schemes in the whole  world, arranged with a feeling for balance and rhythm exceeding the  power of the modern artist, and executed with a mastery beyond the  compass of a modern craftsman. The fact that first forces itself upon  the beholder is that the thing is so obviously mathematical in its  rhythms, that to reduce it to terms of geometry and number is a matter  of small difficulty. Compare the frozen music of these rhymed and  linked figures with the herded, confused, and cluttered compositions  of even our best decorative artists, and argument becomes  unnecessary--the fact stands forth that we have lost something  precious and vital out of art of which the ancients possessed the  secret.    It is for the restoration of these ancient verities and the discovery  of new spatial rhythms--made possible by the advance of mathematical  science--that the author pleads. Artists, architects, designers,  instead of chewing the cud of current fashion, come into these  pastures new!

A series of tones executed on  continuant consonants, like _m_, _z_, or _l_, gives the effect of  humming, droning, or buzzing. The sound of \"humming,\" indeed, is nothing  but a continuous voiced nasal, held on one pitch or varying in pitch, as  desired.]    [Footnote 16: The whisper of ordinary speech is a combination of  unvoiced sounds and \"whispered\" sounds, as the term is understood in  phonetics.]    The nose is not an active organ of speech, but it is highly important as  a resonance chamber. It may be disconnected from the mouth, which is  the other great resonance chamber, by the lifting of the movable part of  the soft palate so as to shut off the passage of the breath into the  nasal cavity; or, if the soft palate is allowed to hang down freely and  unobstructively, so that the breath passes into both the nose and the  mouth, these make a combined resonance chamber. Such sounds as _b_ and  _a_ (as in _father_) are voiced \"oral\" sounds, that is, the voiced  breath does not receive a nasal resonance. As soon as the soft palate is  lowered, however, and the nose added as a participating resonance  chamber, the sounds _b_ and _a_ take on a peculiar \"nasal\" quality and  become, respectively, _m_ and the nasalized vowel written _an_ in French  (e.g., _sang_, _tant_). The only English sounds[17] that normally  receive a nasal resonance are _m_, _n_, and the _ng_ sound of _sing_.  Practically all sounds, however, may be nasalized, not only the  vowels--nasalized vowels are common in all parts of the world--but such  sounds as _l_ or _z_. Voiceless nasals are perfectly possible. They  occur, for instance, in Welsh and in quite a number of American Indian  languages.    [Footnote 17: Aside from the involuntary nasalizing of all voiced sounds  in the speech of those that talk with a \"nasal twang.\"]    The organs that make up the oral resonance chamber may articulate in two  ways. The breath, voiced or unvoiced, nasalized or unnasalized, may be  allowed to pass through the mouth without being checked or impeded at  any point; or it may be either momentarily checked or allowed to stream  through a greatly narrowed passage with resulting air friction. There  are also transitions between the two latter types of articulation. The  unimpeded breath takes on a particular color or quality in accordance  with the varying shape of the oral resonance chamber. This shape is  chiefly determined by the position of the movable parts--the tongue and  the lips. As the tongue is raised or lowered, retracted or brought  forward, held tense or lax, and as the lips are pursed (\"rounded\") in  varying degree or allowed to keep their position of rest, a large number  of distinct qualities result. These oral qualities are the vowels. In  theory their number is infinite, in practice the ear can differentiate  only a limited, yet a surprisingly large, number of resonance positions.  Vowels, whether nasalized or not, are normally voiced sounds; in not a  few languages, however, \"voiceless vowels\"[18] also occur.    [Footnote 18: These may be also defined as free unvoiced breath with  varying vocalic timbres. In the long Paiute word quoted on page 31 the  first _u_ and the final _ue_ are pronounced without voice.]    [Transcriber's note: Footnote 18 refers to line 1014.]    The remaining oral sounds are generally grouped together as  \"consonants.\" In them the stream of breath is interfered with in some  way, so that a lesser resonance results, and a sharper, more incisive  quality of tone. There are four main types of articulation generally  recognized within the consonantal group of sounds. The breath may be  completely stopped for a moment at some definite point in the oral  cavity. Sounds so produced, like _t_ or _d_ or _p_, are known as \"stops\"  or \"explosives.\"[19] Or the breath may be continuously obstructed  through a narrow passage, not entirely checked. Examples of such  \"spirants\" or \"fricatives,\" as they are called, are _s_ and _z_ and _y_.  The third class of consonants, the \"laterals,\" are semi-stopped. There  is a true stoppage at the central point of articulation, but the breath  is allowed to escape through the two side passages or through one of  them. Our English _d_, for instance, may be readily transformed into  _l_, which has the voicing and the position of _d_, merely by  depressing the sides of the tongue on either side of the point of  contact sufficiently to allow the breath to come through. Laterals are  possible in many distinct positions. They may be unvoiced (the Welsh  _ll_ is an example) as well as voiced. Finally, the stoppage of the  breath may be rapidly intermittent; in other words, the active organ of  contact--generally the point of the tongue, less often the  uvula[20]--may be made to vibrate against or near the point of contact.  These sounds are the \"trills\" or \"rolled consonants,\" of which the  normal English _r_ is a none too typical example. They are well  developed in many languages, however, generally in voiced form,  sometimes, as in Welsh and Paiute, in unvoiced form as well.    [Footnote 19: Nasalized stops, say _m_ or _n_, can naturally not be  truly \"stopped,\" as there is no way of checking the stream of breath in  the nose by a definite articulation.]    [Footnote 20: The lips also may theoretically so articulate. \"Labial  trills,\" however, are certainly rare in natural speech.]    The oral manner of articulation is naturally not sufficient to define a  consonant. The place of articulation must also be considered. Contacts  may be formed at a large number of points, from the root of the tongue  to the lips. It is not necessary here to go at length into this somewhat  complicated matter. The contact is either between the root of the tongue  and the throat,[21] some part of the tongue and a point on the palate  (as in _k_ or _ch_ or _l_), some part of the tongue and the teeth (as in  the English _th_ of _thick_ and _then_), the teeth and one of the lips  (practically always the upper teeth and lower lip, as in _f_), or the  two lips (as in _p_ or English _w_). The tongue articulations are the  most complicated of all, as the mobility of the tongue allows various  points on its surface, say the tip, to articulate against a number of  opposed points of contact. Hence arise many positions of articulation  that we are not familiar with, such as the typical \"dental\" position of  Russian or Italian _t_ and _d_; or the \"cerebral\" position of Sanskrit  and other languages of India, in which the tip of the tongue articulates  against the hard palate. As there is no break at any point between the  rims of the teeth back to the uvula nor from the tip of the tongue back  to its root, it is evident that all the articulations that involve the  tongue form a continuous organic (and acoustic) series. The positions  grade into each other, but each language selects a limited number of  clearly defined positions as characteristic of its consonantal system,  ignoring transitional or extreme positions. Frequently a language allows  a certain latitude in the fixing of the required position. This is true,  for instance, of the English _k_ sound, which is articulated much  further to the front in a word like _kin_ than in _cool_. We ignore this  difference, psychologically, as a non-essential, mechanical one. Another  language might well recognize the difference, or only a slightly greater  one, as significant, as paralleling the distinction in position between  the _k_ of _kin_ and the _t_ of _tin_.    [Footnote 21: This position, known as \"faucal,\" is not common.]    The organic classification of speech sounds is a simple matter after  what we have learned of their production. Any such sound may be put into  its proper place by the appropriate answer to four main questions:--What  is the position of the glottal cords during its articulation? Does the  breath pass into the mouth alone or is it also allowed to stream into  the nose? Does the breath pass freely through the mouth or is it impeded  at some point and, if so, in what manner? What are the precise points of  articulation in the mouth?[22] This fourfold classification of sounds,  worked out in all its detailed ramifications,[23] is sufficient to  account for all, or practically all, the sounds of language.[24]    [Footnote 22: \"Points of articulation\" must be understood to include  tongue and lip positions of the vowels.]    [Footnote 23: Including, under the fourth category, a number of special  resonance adjustments that we have not been able to take up  specifically.]    [Footnote 24: In so far, it should be added, as these sounds are  expiratory, i.e., pronounced with the outgoing breath. Certain  languages, like the South African Hottentot and Bushman, have also a  number of inspiratory sounds, pronounced by sucking in the breath at  various points of oral contact. These are the so-called \"clicks.\"]    The phonetic habits of a given language are not exhaustively defined by  stating that it makes use of such and such particular sounds out of the  all but endless gamut that we have briefly surveyed. There remains the  important question of the dynamics of these phonetic elements. Two  languages may, theoretically, be built up of precisely the same series  of consonants and vowels and yet produce utterly different acoustic  effects. One of them may not recognize striking variations in the  lengths or \"quantities\" of the phonetic elements, the other may note  such variations most punctiliously (in probably the majority of  languages long and short vowels are distinguished; in many, as in  Italian or Swedish or Ojibwa, long consonants are recognized as distinct  from short ones). Or the one, say English, may be very sensitive to  relative stresses, while in the other, say French, stress is a very  minor consideration. Or, again,"]]]
