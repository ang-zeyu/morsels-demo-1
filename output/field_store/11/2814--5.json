You understand?\"    \"It's a rather nasty thing to hear,\" said Terence huskily. \"Perhaps  you're right. I don't know. Perhaps you're right.\"    \"And if her theory is proved wrong--look out, Terry! She'll throw you out  of her life without a second thought.\"    \"Is that a threat?\"    \"My dear boy, not by any means. You think I have hated you? Not at all. I  have simply been indifferent. Now that you are in more or less trouble,  you see that I come to you. And hereafter if there should be a crisis,  you will see who is your true friend. Now, good night!\"    He had saved his most gracious speech until the very end, and after it he  retired at once to leave Terence with the pleasant memory in his mind.  For he had in his mind the idea of a perfect crime for which he would not  be punished. He would turn Terry into a corpse or a killer, and in either  case the youngster would never dream who had dealt the blow.    No wonder, then, as he went downstairs, that he stepped onto the veranda  for a few moments. The moon was just up beyond Mount Discovery; the  valley unfolded like a dream. Never had the estate seemed so charming to  Vance Cornish, for he felt that his hand was closing slowly around his  inheritance.        CHAPTER 10      The sleep of the night seemed to blot out the excitement of the preceding  evening. A bright sun, a cool stir of air, brought in the next morning,  and certainly calamity had never seemed farther from the Cornish ranch  than it did on this day. All through the morning people kept arriving in  ones and twos. Every buckboard on the place was commissioned to haul the  guests around the smooth roads and show them the estate; and those who  preferred were furnished with saddle horses from the stable to keep their  own mounts fresh for their return trip. Vance took charge of the wagon  parties; Terence himself guided the horsemen, and he rode El Sangre, a  flashing streak of blood red.    The exercise brought the color to his face; the wind raised his spirits;  and when the gathering at the house to wait for the big dinner began, he  was as gay as any.    \"That's the way with young people,\" Elizabeth confided to her brother.  \"Trouble slips off their minds.\"    And then the second blow fell, the blow on which Vance had counted for  his great results. No less a person than Sheriff Joe Minter galloped up  and threw his reins before the veranda. He approached Elizabeth with a  high flourish of his hat and a profound bow, for Uncle Joe Minter  affected the mannered courtesy of the \"Southern\" school. Vance had them  in profile from the side, and his nervous glance flickered from one to  the other. The sheriff was plainly pleased with what he had seen on his  way up Bear Creek. He was also happy to be present at so large a  gathering. But to Elizabeth his coming was like a death. Her brother  could tell the difference between her forced cordiality and the real  thing. She had his horse put up; presented him to the few people whom he  had not met, and then left him posing for the crowd of admirers. Life to  the sheriff was truly a stage. Then Elizabeth went to Vance.    \"You saw?\" she gasped.    \"Sheriff Minter? What of it? Rather nervy of the old ass to come up here  for the party; he hardly knows us.\"    \"No, no! Not that! But don't you remember? Don't you remember what Joe  Minter did?\"    \"Good Lord!\" gasped Vance, apparently just recalling. \"He killed Black  Jack! And what will Terry do when he finds out?\"    She grew still whiter, hearing him name her own fear.    \"They mustn't meet,\" she said desperately. \"Vance, if you're half a man  you'll find some way of getting that pompous, windy idiot off the place.\"    \"My dear! Do you want me to invite him to leave?\"    \"Something--I don't care what!\"    \"Neither do I. But I can't insult the fool. That type resents an insult  with gunplay. We must simply keep them apart. Keep the sheriff from  talking.\"    \"Keep rain from falling!\" groaned Elizabeth. \"Vance, if you won't do  anything, I'll go and tell the sheriff that he must leave!\"    \"You don't mean it!\"    \"Do you think that I'm going to risk a murder?\"    \"I suppose you're right,\" nodded Vance, changing his tactics with  Machiavellian smoothness. \"If Terry saw the man who killed his father,  all his twenty-four years of training would go up in smoke and the blood  of his father would talk in him. There'd be a shooting!\"    She caught a hand to her throat. \"I'm not so sure of that, Vance. I think  he would come through this acid test. But I don't want to take chances.\"    \"I don't blame you, Elizabeth,\" said her brother heartily. \"Neither would  I. But if the sheriff stays here, I feel that I'm going to win the bet  that I made twenty-four years ago. You remember? That Terry would shoot a  man before he was twenty-five?\"    \"Have I ever forgotten?\" she said huskily. \"Have I ever let it go out of  my mind? But it isn't the danger of Terry shooting. It's the danger of  Terry being shot. If he should reach for a gun against the sheriff--that  professional mankiller--Vance, something has to be done!\"    \"Right,\" he nodded. \"I wouldn't trust Terry in the face of such a  temptation to violence. Not for a moment!\"    The natural stubbornness on which he had counted hardened in her face.    \"I don't know.\"    \"It would be an acid test, Elizabeth. But perhaps now is the time. You've  spent twenty-four years training him. If he isn't what he ought to be  now, he never will be, no doubt.\"    \"It may be that you're right,\" she said gloomily. \"Twenty-four years!  Yes, and I've filled about half of my time with Terry and his training.  Vance, you are right. If he has the elements of a mankiller in him after  what I've done for him, then he's a hopeless case. The sheriff shall  stay! The sheriff shall stay!\"    She kept repeating it, as though the repetition of the phrase might bring  her courage. And then she went back among her guests.    As for Vance, he remained skillfully in the background that day. It was  peculiarly vital, this day of all days, that he should not be much in  evidence. No one must see in him a controlling influence.    In the meantime he watched his sister with a growing admiration and with  a growing concern. Instantly she had a problem on her hands. For the  moment Terence heard that the great sheriff himself had joined the party,  he was filled with happiness. Vance watched them meet with a heart  swelling with happiness and surety of success. Straight through a group  came Terry, weaving his way eagerly, and went up to the sheriff. Vance  saw Elizabeth attempt to detain him, attempt to send him on an errand.  But he waved her suggestion away for a moment and made for the sheriff.  Elizabeth, seeing that the meeting could not be avoided, at least  determined to be present at it. She came up with Terence and presented  him.    \"Sheriff Minter, this is Terence Colby.\"    \"I've heard of you, Colby,\" said the sheriff kindly. And he waited for a  response with the gleaming eye of a vain man. There was not long to wait.    \"You've really heard of me?\" said Terry, immensely pleased. \"By the Lord,  I've heard of you, sheriff! But, of course, everybody has.\"    \"I dunno, son,\" said the sheriff benevolently. \"But I been drifting  around a tolerable long time, I guess.\"    \"Why,\" said Terry, with a sort of outburst, \"I've simply eaten up  everything I could gather. I've even read about you in magazines!\"    \"Well, now you don't say,\" protested the sheriff. \"In magazines?\"    And his eye quested through the group, hoping for other listeners who  might learn how broadly the fame of their sheriff was spread.    \"That Canning fellow who travelled out West and ran into you and was  along while you were hunting down the Garrison boys. I read his article.\"    The sheriff scratched his chin. \"I disremember him. Canning? Canning?  Come to think of it, I do remember him. Kind of a small man with washed-  out eyes. Always with a notebook on his knee. I got sick of answering all  that gent's questions, I recollect. Yep, he was along when I took the  Garrison boys, but that little party didn't amount to much.\"    \"He thought it did,\" said Terry fervently. \"Said it was the bravest,  coolest-headed, cunningest piece of work he'd ever seen done. Perhaps  you'll tell me some of the other things--the things you count big?\"    \"Oh, I ain't done nothing much, come to think of it. All pretty simple,  they looked to me, when I was doing them. Besides, I ain't much of a hand  at talk!\"    \"Ah,\" said Terry, \"you'd talk well enough to suit me, sheriff!\"    The sheriff had found a listener after his own heart.    \"They ain't nothing but a campfire that gives a good light to see a story  by--the kind of stories I got to tell,\" he declared. \"Some of these days  I'll take you along with me on a trail, son, if you'd like--and most like  I'll talk your arm off at night beside the fire. Like to come?\"    \"Like to?\" cried Terry. \"I'd be the happiest man in the mountains!\"    \"Would you, now? Well, Colby, you and me might hit it off pretty well.  I've heard tell you ain't half bad with a rifle and pretty slick with a  revolver, too.\"    \"I practice hard,\" said Terry frankly. \"I love guns.\"    \"Good things to love, and good things to hate, too,\" philosophized the  sheriff. \"But all right in their own place, which ain't none too big,  these days. The old times is gone when a man went out into the world with  a hoss under him, and a pair of Colts strapped to his waist, and made his  own way. Them days is gone, and our younger boys is going to pot!\"    \"I suppose so,\" admitted Terry.    \"But you got a spark in you, son. Well, one of these days we'll get  together. And I hear tell you got El Sangre?\"    \"I was lucky,\" said Terry.    \"That's a sizable piece of work, Colby. I've seen twenty that run El  Sangre, and never even got close enough to eat his dust.

She saw a very tall man with  extremely broad shoulders, a mass of raven-black hair, and a white  face. He stepped forward, and took her hand in his huge, horny palm,  pressing it, he stepped back without speaking. Colonel Zane talked to  her in a soothing voice; but she failed to hear what he said. This  Wetzel, this Indian-hunter whom she had heard called \"Deathwind of the  Border,\" this companion, guide, teacher of Jonathan Zane, this  borderman of wonderful deeds, stood before her.    Helen saw a cold face, deathly in its pallor, lighted by eyes  sloe-black but like glinting steel. Striking as were these features,  they failed to fascinate as did the strange tracings which apparently  showed through the white, drawn skin. This first repelled, then drew  her with wonderful force. Suffering, of fire, and frost, and iron was  written there, and, stronger than all, so potent as to cause fear,  could be read the terrible purpose of this man's tragic life.    \"You avenged her! Oh! I know you did!\" cried Helen, her whole heart  leaping with a blaze to her eyes.    She was answered by a smile, but such a smile! Kindly it broke over  the stern face, giving a glimpse of a heart still warm beneath that  steely cold. Behind it, too, there was something fateful,  something deadly.    Helen knew, though the borderman spoke not, that somewhere among the  grasses of the broad plains, or on the moss of the wooded hills, lay  dead the perpetrators of this outrage, their still faces bearing the  ghastly stamp of Deathwind.          CHAPTER VI    Happier days than she had hoped for, dawned upon Helen after the first  touch of border sorrow. Mabel Lane did not die. Helen and Betty nursed  the stricken girl tenderly, weeping for very joy when signs of  improvement appeared. She had remained silent for several days, always  with that haunting fear in her eyes, and then gradually came a change.  Tender care and nursing had due effect in banishing the dark shadow.  One morning after a long sleep she awakened with a bright smile, and  from that time her improvement was rapid.    Helen wanted Mabel to live with her. The girl's position was pitiable.  Homeless, fatherless, with not a relative on the border, yet so brave,  so patient that she aroused all the sympathy in Helen's breast.  Village gossip was in substance, that Mabel had given her love to a  young frontiersman, by name Alex Bennet, who had an affection for her,  so it was said, but as yet had made no choice between her and the  other lasses of the settlement. What effect Mabel's terrible  experience might have on this lukewarm lover, Helen could not even  guess; but she was not hopeful as to the future. Colonel Zane and  Betty approved of Helen's plan to persuade Mabel to live with her, and  the latter's faint protestations they silenced by claiming she could  be of great assistance in the management of the house, therefore it  was settled.    Finally the day came when Mabel was ready to go with Helen. Betty had  given her a generous supply of clothing, for all her belongings had  been destroyed when the cabin was burned. With Helen's strong young  arm around her she voiced her gratitude to Betty and Mrs. Zane and  started toward the Sheppard home.    From the green square, where the ground was highest, an unobstructed  view could be had of the valley. Mabel gazed down the river to where  her home formerly stood. Only a faint, dark spot, like a blur on the  green landscape, could be seen. Her soft eyes filled with tears; but  she spoke no word.    \"She's game and that's why she didn't go under,\" Colonel Zane said to  himself as he mused on the strength and spirit of borderwomen. To  their heroism, more than any other thing, he attributed the  establishing of homes in this wilderness.    In the days that ensued, as Mabel grew stronger, the girls became very  fond of each other. Helen would have been happy at any time with such  a sweet companion, but just then, when the poor girl's mind was so  sorely disturbed she was doubly glad. For several days, after Mabel  was out of danger, Helen's thoughts had dwelt on a subject which  caused extreme vexation. She had begun to suspect that she encouraged  too many admirers for whom she did not care, and thought too much of a  man who did not reciprocate. She was gay and moody in turn. During the  moody hours she suspected herself, and in her gay ones, scorned the  idea that she might ever care for a man who was indifferent. But that  thought once admitted, had a trick of returning at odd moments,  clouding her cheerful moods.    One sunshiny morning while the May flowers smiled under the hedge,  when dew sparkled on the leaves, and the locust-blossoms shone  creamy-white amid the soft green of the trees, the girls set about  their much-planned flower gardening. Helen was passionately fond of  plants, and had brought a jar of seeds of her favorites all the way  from her eastern home.    \"We'll plant the morning-glories so they'll run up the porch, and the  dahlias in this long row and the nasturtiums in this round bed,\"  Helen said.    \"You have some trailing arbutus,\" added Mabel, \"and must have  clematis, wild honeysuckle and golden-glow, for they are all  sweet flowers.\"    \"This arbutus is so fresh, so dewy, so fragrant,\" said Helen, bending  aside a lilac bush to see the pale, creeping flowers. \"I never saw  anything so beautiful. I grow more and more in love with my new home  and friends. I have such a pretty garden to look into, and I never  tire of the view beyond.\"    Helen gazed with pleasure and pride at the garden with its fresh green  and lavender-crested lilacs, at the white-blossomed trees, and the  vine-covered log cabins with blue smoke curling from their stone  chimneys. Beyond, the great bulk of the fort stood guard above the  willow-skirted river, and far away over the winding stream the dark  hills, defiant, kept their secrets.    \"If it weren't for that threatening fort one could imagine this little  hamlet, nestling under the great bluff, as quiet and secure as it is  beautiful,\" said Helen. \"But that charred stockade fence with its  scarred bastions and these lowering port-holes, always keep me alive  to the reality.\"    \"It wasn't very quiet when Girty was here,\" Mabel replied  thoughtfully.    \"Were you in the fort then?\" asked Helen breathlessly.    \"Oh, yes, I cooled the rifles for the men,\" replied Mabel calmly.    \"Tell me all about it.\"    Helen listened again to a story she had heard many times; but told by  new lips it always gained in vivid interest. She never tired of  hearing how the notorious renegade, Girty, rode around the fort on his  white horse, giving the defenders an hour in which to surrender; she  learned again of the attack, when the British soldiers remained silent  on an adjoining hillside, while the Indians yelled exultantly and ran  about in fiendish glee, when Wetzel began the battle by shooting an  Indian chieftain who had ventured within range of his ever fatal  rifle. And when it came to the heroic deeds of that memorable siege  Helen could not contain her enthusiasm. She shed tears over little  Harry Bennet's death at the south bastion where, though riddled with  bullets, he stuck to his post until relieved. Clark's race, across the  roof of the fort to extinguish a burning arrow, she applauded with  clapping hands. Her great eyes glowed and burned, but she was silent,  when hearing how Wetzel ran alone to a break in the stockade, and  there, with an ax, the terrible borderman held at bay the whole  infuriated Indian mob until the breach was closed. Lastly Betty Zane's  never-to-be-forgotten run with the powder to the relief of the  garrison and the saving of the fort was something not to cry over or  applaud; but to dream of and to glorify.    \"Down that slope from Colonel Zane's cabin is where Betty ran with the  powder,\" said Mabel, pointing.    \"Did you see her?\" asked Helen.    \"Yes, I looked out of a port-hole. The Indians stopped firing at the  fort in their eagerness to shoot Betty. Oh, the banging of guns and  yelling of savages was one fearful, dreadful roar! Through all that  hail of bullets Betty ran swift as the wind.\"    \"I almost wish Girty would come again,\" said Helen.    \"Don't; he might.\"    \"How long has Betty's husband, Mr. Clarke, been dead?\" inquired Helen.    \"I don't remember exactly. He didn't live long after the siege. Some  say he inhaled the flames while fighting fire inside the stockade.\"    \"How sad!\"    \"Yes, it was. It nearly killed Betty. But we border girls do not give  up easily; we must not,\" replied Mabel, an unquenchable spirit showing  through the sadness of her eyes.    Merry voices interrupted them, and they turned to see Betty and Nell  entering the gate. With Nell's bright chatter and Betty's wit, the  conversation became indeed vivacious, running from gossip to gowns,  and then to that old and ever new theme, love. Shortly afterward the  colonel entered the gate, with swinging step and genial smile.    \"Well, now, if here aren't four handsome lasses,\" he said with an  admiring glance.    \"Eb, I believe if you were single any girl might well suspect you of  being a flirt,\" said Betty.    \"No girl ever did. I tell you I was a lady-killer in my day,\" replied  Colonel Zane, straightening his fine form. He was indeed handsome,  with his stalwart frame, dark, bronzed face and rugged, manly bearing.    \"Bess said you were; but that it didn't last long after you saw her,\"  cried Betty, mischief gleaming in her dark eye.    \"Well, that's so,\" replied the colonel, looking a trifle crest-fallen;  \"but you know every dog has his day.\" Then advancing to the porch, he  looked at Mabel with a more serious gaze as he asked, \"How are  you to-day?\"    \"Thank you, Colonel Zane, I am getting quite strong.\"    \"Look up the valley. There's a raft coming down the river,\" said"]]]
