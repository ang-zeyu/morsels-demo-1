Mynheer van Baerle and his tulips, therefore, were in the mouth of  everybody; so much so, that Boxtel's name disappeared for ever from the  list of the notable tulip-growers in Holland, and those of Dort were now  represented by Cornelius van Baerle, the modest and inoffensive savant.    Engaging, heart and soul, in his pursuits of sowing, planting, and  gathering, Van Baerle, caressed by the whole fraternity of tulip-growers  in Europe, entertained nor the least suspicion that there was at his  very door a pretender whose throne he had usurped.    He went on in his career, and consequently in his triumphs; and in  the course of two years he covered his borders with such marvellous  productions as no mortal man, following in the tracks of the Creator,  except perhaps Shakespeare and Rubens, have equalled in point of  numbers.    And also, if Dante had wished for a new type to be added to his  characters of the Inferno, he might have chosen Boxtel during the period  of Van Baerle's successes. Whilst Cornelius was weeding, manuring,  watering his beds, whilst, kneeling on the turf border, he analysed  every vein of the flowering tulips, and meditated on the modifications  which might be effected by crosses of colour or otherwise, Boxtel,  concealed behind a small sycamore which he had trained at the top of the  partition wall in the shape of a fan, watched, with his eyes starting  from their sockets and with foaming mouth, every step and every gesture  of his neighbour; and whenever he thought he saw him look happy, or  descried a smile on his lips, or a flash of contentment glistening in  his eyes, he poured out towards him such a volley of maledictions  and furious threats as to make it indeed a matter of wonder that  this venomous breath of envy and hatred did not carry a blight on the  innocent flowers which had excited it.    When the evil spirit has once taken hold of the heart of man, it urges  him on, without letting him stop. Thus Boxtel soon was no longer content  with seeing Van Baerle. He wanted to see his flowers, too; he had  the feelings of an artist, the master-piece of a rival engrossed his  interest.    He therefore bought a telescope, which enabled him to watch as  accurately as did the owner himself every progressive development of  the flower, from the moment when, in the first year, its pale seed-leaf  begins to peep from the ground, to that glorious one, when, after five  years, its petals at last reveal the hidden treasures of its chalice.  How often had the miserable, jealous man to observe in Van Baerle's beds  tulips which dazzled him by their beauty, and almost choked him by their  perfection!    And then, after the first blush of the admiration which he could not  help feeling, he began to be tortured by the pangs of envy, by that slow  fever which creeps over the heart and changes it into a nest of vipers,  each devouring the other and ever born anew. How often did Boxtel, in  the midst of tortures which no pen is able fully to describe,--how  often did he feel an inclination to jump down into the garden during the  night, to destroy the plants, to tear the bulbs with his teeth, and to  sacrifice to his wrath the owner himself, if he should venture to stand  up for the defence of his tulips!    But to kill a tulip was a horrible crime in the eyes of a genuine  tulip-fancier; as to killing a man, it would not have mattered so very  much.    Yet Van Baerle made such progress in the noble science of growing  tulips, which he seemed to master with the true instinct of genius, that  Boxtel at last was maddened to such a degree as to think of throwing  stones and sticks into the flower-stands of his neighbour. But,  remembering that he would be sure to be found out, and that he would not  only be punished by law, but also dishonoured for ever in the face of  all the tulip-growers of Europe, he had recourse to stratagem, and, to  gratify his hatred, tried to devise a plan by means of which he might  gain his ends without being compromised himself.    He considered a long time, and at last his meditations were crowned with  success.    One evening he tied two cats together by their hind legs with a string  about six feet in length, and threw them from the wall into the midst of  that noble, that princely, that royal bed, which contained not only the  \"Cornelius de Witt,\" but also the \"Beauty of Brabant,\" milk-white,  edged with purple and pink, the \"Marble of Rotterdam,\" colour of flax,  blossoms feathered red and flesh colour, the \"Wonder of Haarlem,\" the  \"Colombin obscur,\" and the \"Columbin clair terni.\"    The frightened cats, having alighted on the ground, first tried to fly  each in a different direction, until the string by which they were tied  together was tightly stretched across the bed; then, however, feeling  that they were not able to get off, they began to pull to and fro, and  to wheel about with hideous caterwaulings, mowing down with their string  the flowers among which they were struggling, until, after a furious  strife of about a quarter of an hour, the string broke and the  combatants vanished.    Boxtel, hidden behind his sycamore, could not see anything, as it was  pitch-dark; but the piercing cries of the cats told the whole tale, and  his heart overflowing with gall now throbbed with triumphant joy.    Boxtel was so eager to ascertain the extent of the injury, that he  remained at his post until morning to feast his eyes on the sad state in  which the two cats had left the flower-beds of his neighbour. The mists  of the morning chilled his frame, but he did not feel the cold, the hope  of revenge keeping his blood at fever heat. The chagrin of his rival was  to pay for all the inconvenience which he incurred himself.    At the earliest dawn the door of the white house opened, and Van Baerle  made his appearance, approaching the flower-beds with the smile of a  man who has passed the night comfortably in his bed, and has had happy  dreams.    All at once he perceived furrows and little mounds of earth on the beds  which only the evening before had been as smooth as a mirror, all at  once he perceived the symmetrical rows of his tulips to be completely  disordered, like the pikes of a battalion in the midst of which a shell  has fallen.    He ran up to them with blanched cheek.    Boxtel trembled with joy. Fifteen or twenty tulips, torn and crushed,  were lying about, some of them bent, others completely broken and  already withering, the sap oozing from their bleeding bulbs: how gladly  would Van Baerle have redeemed that precious sap with his own blood!    But what were his surprise and his delight! what was the disappointment  of his rival! Not one of the four tulips which the latter had meant to  destroy was injured at all. They raised proudly their noble heads above  the corpses of their slain companions. This was enough to console Van  Baerle, and enough to fan the rage of the horticultural murderer, who  tore his hair at the sight of the effects of the crime which he had  committed in vain.    Van Baerle could not imagine the cause of the mishap, which,  fortunately, was of far less consequence than it might have been. On  making inquiries, he learned that the whole night had been disturbed  by terrible caterwaulings. He besides found traces of the cats,  their footmarks and hairs left behind on the battle-field; to guard,  therefore, in future against a similar outrage, he gave orders that  henceforth one of the under gardeners should sleep in the garden in a  sentry-box near the flower-beds.    Boxtel heard him give the order, and saw the sentry-box put up that  very day; but he deemed himself lucky in not having been suspected, and,  being more than ever incensed against the successful horticulturist, he  resolved to bide his time.    Just then the Tulip Society of Haarlem offered a prize for the discovery  (we dare not say the manufacture) of a large black tulip without a  spot of colour, a thing which had not yet been accomplished, and was  considered impossible, as at that time there did not exist a flower of  that species approaching even to a dark nut brown. It was, therefore,  generally said that the founders of the prize might just as well have  offered two millions as a hundred thousand guilders, since no one would  be able to gain it.    The tulip-growing world, however, was thrown by it into a state of most  active commotion. Some fanciers caught at the idea without believing it  practicable, but such is the power of imagination among florists, that  although considering the undertaking as certain to fail, all their  thoughts were engrossed by that great black tulip, which was looked upon  to be as chimerical as the black swan of Horace or the white raven of  French tradition.    Van Baerle was one of the tulip-growers who were struck with the idea;  Boxtel thought of it in the light of a speculation. Van Baerle, as soon  as the idea had once taken root in his clear and ingenious mind, began  slowly the necessary planting and cross-breeding to reduce the tulips  which he had grown already from red to brown, and from brown to dark  brown.    By the next year he had obtained flowers of a perfect nut-brown, and  Boxtel espied them in the border, whereas he had himself as yet only  succeeded in producing the light brown.    It might perhaps be interesting to explain to the gentle reader the  beautiful chain of theories which go to prove that the tulip borrows its  colors from the elements; perhaps we should give him pleasure if we were  to maintain and establish that nothing is impossible for a florist who  avails himself with judgment and discretion and patience of the sun's  heat; the clear water, the juices of the earth, and the cool breezes.  But this is not a treatise upon tulips in general; it is the story of  one particular tulip which we have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9650"],[0,"Independent Bohemia (#10)"],[1,"reason given for the verdict  was that the accused editor of the _Pokrok_, which was suppressed as being  dangerous to the State, delivered a speech at a meeting of a co-operative  society in which he said that all Czechs were unanimous that they knew that  Austria was losing the war and that they prayed to God that her downfall  might be soon. He was further alleged to have said that it was doubtful how  Europe would be divided after the war, but that in any case the  Czecho-Slovak countries would be made independent as a wedge between  Germany and Austria, and that if Germany won the Czechs would be  germanised, like the Poles in Germany. The accused admitted that he did  speak about the reorganisation of Europe, but not in the words used by the  prosecution. But, as the _Arbeiter Zeitung_ said, even if he did say what  the prosecution alleged, as a civilian he should never have been sentenced  to death by a military tribunal. According to Czech papers, Kotek was  buried among ordinary criminals outside the cemetery. The grave of the  innocent martyr was not even marked with his name, and his wife was not  allowed to visit it, because the military authorities forbade the sexton of  the church to allow any one to see the graves of those executed for  high treason.    _Dr. Preiss_, the manager of the Czech bank, Zivnostenska Banka, which has  its branches in Galicia, Rumania, Serbia and elsewhere, and four of his  colleagues were imprisoned, because the Czechs would not subscribe to  Austrian war loans and Dr. Preiss had done nothing to induce them to do so.    As regards the horrors of the internment camps, in which over 20,000  innocent Czechs, men, women and children, were confined, we will only quote  the revelations of the Czech National Socialist deputy Stribrny, who  declared in the Reichsrat on June 14, 1917:        \"This war was begun by the Austrian Government without the consent of      the Austrian Parliament, against the will of the Czech people.        \"In Bohemia, the most brutal cruelties have been perpetrated by the      Austrian authorities against the Czech population. An anonymous      denunciation suffices to bring about the arrest and imprisonment of any      Czech man, woman or child. Thousands of Czech citizens have simply been      seized and placed in internment camps on the ground that their      political opinions are dangerous to the existence of Austria.        \"Such prisoners were led away from their homes handcuffed and in      chains. They included women, girls and old grey-haired men. They were      conveyed from their homes to internment camps in filthy cattle trucks      and were cruelly ill-treated with a strange persistence. On one      occasion forty-three Czechs, who were being conveyed to a camp of      internment, were killed on the way by a detachment of Honveds      (Hungarian militia) which was escorting them to their place of      imprisonment.        \"The conditions under which the Czechs were interned at the Talerhof      Camp, near Graz, were absolutely outrageous. They were beaten and      tortured on their way there. Immediately after their arrival many were      tied to stakes and kept thus day and night in absolutely indescribable      sanitary conditions. Many were done to death by their guards. When the      thermometer showed 20 degrees of frost, old men, women and girls were      left to sleep in the open air, and mortality increased amongst them to      a frightful extent. Two thousand unhappy victims of Austria's brutal      tyranny lie buried in the cemetery attached to the Talerhof Camp of      internment. Of these, 1200 died of epidemics.\"    Other information concerning the same camp of Talerhof fully corroborates  this statement. In a letter to his friends, a Czech interned at Talerhof  wrote as follows:        \"Many of my friends died from bayonet wounds; out of 12,000 at least,      2000 have so perished. The majority of us did not know why we were      interned. Many were hanged without a trial on mere denunciation. Human      life had no value for them. The soldiers had orders to strike us with      bayonets for the slightest movement....        \"We were covered with insects. One day an order was given that      everybody should undress to be rubbed with paraffin. Some ladies who      objected were undressed by force before our eyes, since men and women      slept together, and the soldiers rubbed them with paraffin.        \"A Ruthene who protested against the ill-treatment of women, who were      forced to do the lowest work, was bayonetted. He was lying for five      days between two barracks more dead than alive. His face and body were      all green and covered with lice and his hands were bound. Then the      Austrian officers and soldiers ill-treated him till he died.\"    In consequence of the general political amnesty, over 100,000 political  prisoners in Austria were released. Thousands of them emerged from prison  or internment camps reduced to mere skeletons by the systematic lack  of food.    According to reports published in the Austrian press, one of the Ukrainian  prisoners, named Karpinka, was left in solitary confinement without any  fire in winter, so that his feet were frost-bitten and had to be amputated.    A Czech named Jary, who was condemned to twelve years' hard labour, came  out with consumption contracted through the rigour of his imprisonment.  Many others were reduced to such weakness through starvation that they had  to be carried out of the prison.    (c) _Persecution of the Press_    Among the Czech journals suppressed in Bohemia at the beginning of the war,  the following deserve to be especially mentioned:    _Ceske Slovo_, organ of the National Socialist Party; the editors have been  imprisoned. _Cas_ (\"Times\"), organ of Professor Masaryk (Realist Party);  the editors Dusek and Hajek were imprisoned. _Samostatnost_, organ of the  State Right (Radical) Party; the editors were imprisoned or sent to  the front.    The _Narodni Listy_ (Kramar's organ) was twice suspended, and in May, 1918,  suppressed altogether because it \"fostered sympathies for the Entente.\"    The _Lidove Noviny_, organ of Dr. Stransky (Moravian People's Party), was  also several times suspended during the war.    All Socialist journals were suppressed except _Pravo Lidu_ and _Rovnost_.    According to the _Wiener Zeitung_, seventy-eight Czech journals were  suspended during the months of April, May and June, 1916, alone. All Slovak  newspapers were also suppressed.    As regards censorship, we need only mention that even speeches delivered in  the Austrian Parliament were censored in the press. The sense of the  speeches delivered by Allied statesmen was invariably distorted and  declarations in favour of Czecho-Slovak independence were suppressed.  Foreign newspapers were not allowed to be quoted; and the journals were  forced to publish unsigned articles supplied to them by the police....    The Union of Czech Journalists declared on April 25, 1917        \"We protest against the practice prevailing in Prague as against means      quite contradictory to the moral principles of modern journalism, as in      Prague the newspapers are forced to publish articles supplied by the      Official Press Bureau, as though written by the editor, without being      allowed to mark them as inspired. Thus the journals are not in reality      edited by the editors themselves, but by the Press institution of the      state.\"    The same union again protested on November 16, 1917        \"After the victorious Russian Revolution which brought about also the      opening of the Reichsrat, the fetters binding the Czech press were a      little relaxed, but only for a short time, and to-day we see the same      conditions prevailing in which we lived for the first three years of      war. Every free reflection in the Czech journals is confiscated. They      are even prohibited to publish articles which appeared in the German      and Austrian press. Furthermore, they are again compelled to publish      articles written by officials without marking them as such. They cannot      even inform their readers correctly about parliamentary debates, _as      speeches and interpellations delivered in parliament are suppressed_.      We ask the Union of Czech Deputies to protest again against this      violation of parliamentary immunity, and to obtain a guarantee that in      future the Czech papers will not be compelled to print articles not      written by the editorial staff and that the Czech press shall enjoy at      least the same freedom as the press in Berlin, Vienna and Budapest.\"    _(d) Reichsrat Interpellations_    To complete the picture of Austrian terrorism, we will quote some of the  interpellations addressed to the Austrian Government by Czech deputies in  the summer of 1917.    The Czech deputies_ Prokes, Jaros and Charvat_ (Socialists) have demanded  an explanation from the Minister for Home Defence respecting 300 Czech  teachers from Moravia who were interned in 1915, being suspected of  disloyalty, although there was no charge made against them either by the  civil or by the military authorities. They were first interned in Lower  Austria and then in Hungary, and had to do the hardest work. Though the  educational authorities reclaimed them they were not set free even to  attend to the burials of their relatives. The only exception made was when  one teacher was allowed to be married in Vienna, and even then he was  followed by the guard with fixed bayonets. In Hungary the conditions were  still worse, and many of these teachers died and many of them are still in  hospitals.    A long interpellation was addressed to the government by the Czech  deputies_ Binovec, Filipinsky and Stejskal_ (Socialists) regarding the  outrageous and inhuman treatment of the Czech political prisoners. They  mentioned a vast number of appalling instances of deliberate"]]]
