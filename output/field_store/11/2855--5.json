So great was his grief that at times the  earth trembled and the evil spirits dwelling under the land or water were  much terrified, for they knew they would be terribly punished by  Nanahboozhoo if he should ever get them in his power. But it was a long  time before he had an opportunity to get his revenge on them for the death  of his brother. How he did it I will tell you at some future time.\"          CHAPTER VII.      The Legend of the Bad Boy--How He was Carried Away  by Annungitee, and How He was Rescued by His Mother.    \"Tell us, Mary, a story about the boys of the old times among the Indians,\"  said Sagastao.    \"About bad boys,\" said Minnehaha with a mischievous look in her eyes; \"for  this morning brother and papa had to have a 'settlement,' and it might do  Sagastao good to hear about other bad boys and what was done with them.\"    These words of Minnehaha made Mary very angry. She thought more of Sagastao  than she did of any other member of the family, and nothing threw her into  a rage quicker than for anyone to cross him or even to question the wisdom  of anything he said. Now, indignant that his father had been obliged to  call him into his study for some misdemeanor, Mary was greatly annoyed to  hear these words.    \"O, pshaw, Sakehow,\" said Sagastao; \"do not be so touchy. I deserved the  talking to that papa gave me. It was wrong of me to whack that Indian boy  with my bat as I did, and I ought to have been punished; so if you have any  jolly good stories about bad Indian boys, and how they were punished, why,  let us have one.\"    This confession of her favorite, who, after his temper cooled, was always  quick to admit that he had been in the wrong, quite pacified Mary, and she  settled down on the wolfskin rug with the children and began her story.    \"Long ago all the Indians believed in Windegoos and other spirits that were  more or less friendly to good people. Some were man-eaters and, of course,  were always to be feared. Some Indians were in such fear of these cannibals  that they would never leave the wigwam after dark for fear of being gobbled  up by some of the monsters that might be skulking about.    \"There was one great creature called Annungitee, or Two Faced. He had a  great habit of looking out for bad boys, very bad boys. It was said that he  could not see really good boys; that they were like glass, and he could not  see them. But when a boy became very bad he was then so black that he was  easily seen, and Annungitee could espy him a long way off and was very  likely to come after him.    \"Fortunately Annungitee always made a noise when he was passing along. This  was a good thing for bad boys, for it gave them time to scurry into the  wigwams, out of his way. He was so big that when he set one of his feet  down on the ground there would be sounds like the ringing of bells and the  hooting of owls. When he put the other foot down the sound was like the  roaring of buffalo bulls when they are going to fight each other. Even when  he tried to move softly there would be sounds like birds and beasts crying  out. All the Indians who had heard this great terrible fellow were afraid  of him, and yet no two were able to give the same description of him. But  they did agree on one thing, and that was that when he caught a very wicked  man, which he did sometimes, or very bad boys, which he often did, he just  threw him into one of his big ears and held him there. Indeed, it was  believed that he could hold three big men or six bad boys in one of his  ears at the same time. Nobody knew where he lived, as no one had been found  brave enough to follow and see, and no daring hunter had ever found his  abode in any of his hunting expeditions.    \"Now a certain Indian man and his wife who lived in a wigwam quite apart  from other families had one boy. He was their only child. He had been a  very bad, cruel, unkind boy. His father had to work hard as a hunter to  obtain sufficient game to keep them from starving. His mother cut the wood,  carried up the water from the distant river, dressed the skins of the  animals that were shot by her husband, and did all the work of the wigwam.  The boy would not lift a finger to help in any way. One day the mother, who  was quite sick, asked him to go for some water. He refused, and was very  saucy to her. Then she asked him if he would please bring in some wood for  her, as she felt cold. No, he would not do anything of the kind. She then  became quite angry with him, and said:    \"'If you do not be a better boy I will put you out of the wigwam, and  Annungitee will toss you into his ear.'    \"All the same, she did not really believe he would, as she had not heard of  Annungitee or any other kind of ghost being around for a long, long time.  She only said what she did to frighten the bad boy into obedience. Indeed  she had often said to him, when she was angry with him, 'I do hope a ghost  will catch you.' But the more she talked to him the worse he became. So one  day when he had been very lazy and very rude to her she sprang up and,  seizing him by the arm, undertook to put him out of the wigwam. He became  much frightened at this and began to cry. But she, knowing that he deserved  to be punished, pushed him out and securely fastened the doorway, calling  out:    \"'May Annungitee catch you!'    \"She did not really mean it, of course. No mother could wish her boy to  have such a terrible misfortune. The frightened boy then began running  round and round the wigwam, trying to find some place where he could get  in, but he could find no opening. After a while his crying and his efforts  to get into the wigwam ceased, and all became still and silent. His mother  listened attentively, and every moment expected to hear his voice again,  but there was no sound except something like the sound of the singing of  birds and the rattling of small bells dying away in the distance. At this  she became very much frightened and began to cry, and to call for her boy.  She threw open the door flap and began to search all around her wigwam for  her son. But all in vain! He was nowhere to be found.    \"When the father came home from his hunting she told him of the sudden  disappearance of their boy, and he, too, was very much alarmed. They set  out and visited the lodges of all the people around. But no one had seen or  heard anything of the missing boy. They returned to their own silent wigwam  very sorrowful, and for days they mourned over the loss of their son. One  night, as the mother was weeping on account of her great loss, she heard  some one crying out to her:    \"'Hi! Hi!' and at the same time she heard the sounds of bells ringing and  owls hooting. This happened several nights, and then one night there was a  voice saying:    \"'You said, \"Ghost, take that boy.\" Hi! Hi!'    \"Next morning the wife told her husband what she had heard during the  previous night, and she added:    \"'I believe the ghost Annungitee has taken our boy.'    \"Her husband was very angry when he heard this, and said:    \"'Yes, a ghost has taken our boy. You gave him to him, and he has taken  you at your word. So why should you complain? It serves you right.'    [Illustration: \"They tumbled the tall ghost over.\"]    \"At this the mother lifted up her voice and cried out so loud that it could  be heard a great distance.    \"'Husband,' she said, 'I deserve what you have said, but I am going to try  and get back our boy, and so to-night I will hide in the pile of wood that  is outside the wigwam, and if the ghost comes along again, as he has been  coming, I will catch him by the leg, and you must rush out and try to  rescue our son.'    \"So that night she hid herself in the wood pile, and, sure enough, after a  while she heard the sound of bells ringing and animals softly crying out,  and then a loud 'Hi! Hi!' after which all was still.    \"Then, as she cautiously looked out from her hiding place, there before her  was a great creature standing beside the wigwam. He was so tall that his  head was higher than the smoke hole at the top, and he was peeping down  into the wigwam. But, big as he was, she had a mother's loving heart after  all, and as she thought of her boy fastened up there in one of his big ears  she was determined to rescue him if possible. So she cautiously moved along  until she was able to seize one of his legs, which she did with all her  strength, and at the same instant she shouted for her husband to come and  help. Out he rushed, and between them they tumbled the tall ghost over and,  sure enough, in one of his big ears they found their little boy.    \"Poor little fellow. He was half-starved, and so thin and weak that he  could hardly stand. But they helped him into the wigwam and gave him some  soup, made out of some birds that his father had killed that day.    \"The tall ghost was so frightened by the sudden way in which he had been  seized that as soon as he could get up he hurried away, and was never seen  in that part of the country again. Some tribes say he went South, and  there, when he was stealing children and carrying them off in his ears, he  was caught by the angry parents and burned to death on a big wood pile.\"    \"Did the little boy get better?\" asked Minnehaha.    \"O yes, he did, after a while; but he was a long time in getting over the  fright he had had. It did him good, however, for after that he was never  rude and saucy to his mother and did all he could to help her.\"    \"Did it do the mother any good?\" asked Sagastao, who had not been  altogether satisfied with her treatment of the boy.    \"Yes, indeed,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10897"],[0,"The Wendigo (#11)"],[1,"move muscle to prevent him,  gone with an amazing, blundering swiftness that left no time to act. The  darkness positively swallowed him; and less than a dozen seconds later,  above the roar of the swaying trees and the shout of the sudden wind,  all three men, watching and listening with stricken hearts, heard a cry  that seemed to drop down upon them from a great height of sky and  distance--    \"Oh, oh! This fiery height! Oh, oh! My feet of fire! My burning feet of  fire ...!\" then died away, into untold space and silence.    Dr. Cathcart--suddenly master of himself, and therefore of the  others--was just able to seize Hank violently by the arm as he tried to  dash headlong into the Bush.    \"But I want ter know,--you!\" shrieked the guide. \"I want ter see! That  ain't him at all, but some--devil that's shunted into his place ...!\"    Somehow or other--he admits he never quite knew how he accomplished  it--he managed to keep him in the tent and pacify him. The doctor,  apparently, had reached the stage where reaction had set in and allowed  his own innate force to conquer. Certainly he \"managed\" Hank admirably.  It was his nephew, however, hitherto so wonderfully controlled, who gave  him most cause for anxiety, for the cumulative strain had now produced a  condition of lachrymose hysteria which made it necessary to isolate him  upon a bed of boughs and blankets as far removed from Hank as was  possible under the circumstances.    And there he lay, as the watches of that haunted night passed over the  lonely camp, crying startled sentences, and fragments of sentences, into  the folds of his blanket. A quantity of gibberish about speed and height  and fire mingled oddly with biblical memories of the classroom. \"People  with broken faces all on fire are coming at a most awful, awful, pace  towards the camp!\" he would moan one minute; and the next would sit up  and stare into the woods, intently listening, and whisper, \"How terrible  in the wilderness are--are the feet of them that--\" until his uncle came  across to change the direction of his thoughts and comfort him.    The hysteria, fortunately, proved but temporary. Sleep cured him, just  as it cured Hank.    Till the first signs of daylight came, soon after five o'clock, Dr.  Cathcart kept his vigil. His face was the color of chalk, and there were  strange flushes beneath the eyes. An appalling terror of the soul  battled with his will all through those silent hours. These were some of  the outer signs ...    At dawn he lit the fire himself, made breakfast, and woke the others,  and by seven they were well on their way back to the home camp--three  perplexed and afflicted men, but each in his own way having reduced his  inner turmoil to a condition of more or less systematized order again.          IX      They talked little, and then only of the most wholesome and common  things, for their minds were charged with painful thoughts that  clamoured for explanation, though no one dared refer to them. Hank,  being nearest to primitive conditions, was the first to find himself,  for he was also less complex. In Dr. Cathcart \"civilization\" championed  his forces against an attack singular enough. To this day, perhaps, he  is not _quite_ sure of certain things. Anyhow, he took longer to \"find  himself.\"    Simpson, the student of divinity, it was who arranged his conclusions  probably with the best, though not most scientific, appearance of order.  Out there, in the heart of unreclaimed wilderness, they had surely  witnessed something crudely and essentially primitive. Something that  had survived somehow the advance of humanity had emerged terrifically,  betraying a scale of life still monstrous and immature. He envisaged it  rather as a glimpse into prehistoric ages, when superstitions, gigantic  and uncouth, still oppressed the hearts of men; when the forces of nature  were still untamed, the Powers that may have haunted a primeval universe  not yet withdrawn. To this day he thinks of what he termed years later  in a sermon \"savage and formidable Potencies lurking behind the souls of  men, not evil perhaps in themselves, yet instinctively hostile to humanity  as it exists.\"    With his uncle he never discussed the matter in detail, for the barrier  between the two types of mind made it difficult. Only once, years later,  something led them to the frontier of the subject--of a single detail of  the subject, rather--    \"Can't you even tell me what--_they_ were like?\" he asked; and the reply,  though conceived in wisdom, was not encouraging, \"It is far better you  should not try to know, or to find out.\"    \"Well--that odour...?\" persisted the nephew. \"What do you make of that?\"    Dr. Cathcart looked at him and raised his eyebrows.    \"Odours,\" he replied, \"are not so easy as sounds and sights of telepathic  communication. I make as much, or as little, probably, as you do  yourself.\"    He was not quite so glib as usual with his explanations. That was all.           *       *       *       *       *    At the fall of day, cold, exhausted, famished, the party came to the  end of the long portage and dragged themselves into a camp that at  first glimpse seemed empty. Fire there was none, and no Punk came  forward to welcome them. The emotional capacity of all three was too  over-spent to recognize either surprise or annoyance; but the cry of  spontaneous affection that burst from the lips of Hank, as he rushed  ahead of them towards the fire-place, came probably as a warning that  the end of the amazing affair was not quite yet. And both Cathcart and  his nephew confessed afterwards that when they saw him kneel down in  his excitement and embrace something that reclined, gently moving,  beside the extinguished ashes, they felt in their very bones that this  \"something\" would prove to be Defago--the true Defago, returned.    And so, indeed, it was.    It is soon told. Exhausted to the point of emaciation, the French  Canadian--what was left of him, that is--fumbled among the ashes, trying  to make a fire. His body crouched there, the weak fingers obeying feebly  the instinctive habit of a lifetime with twigs and matches. But there  was no longer any mind to direct the simple operation. The mind had  fled beyond recall. And with it, too, had fled memory. Not only recent  events, but all previous life was a blank.    This time it was the real man, though incredibly and horribly shrunken.  On his face was no expression of any kind whatever--fear, welcome, or  recognition. He did not seem to know who it was that embraced him, or  who it was that fed, warmed and spoke to him the words of comfort and  relief. Forlorn and broken beyond all reach of human aid, the little man  did meekly as he was bidden. The \"something\" that had constituted him  \"individual\" had vanished for ever.    In some ways it was more terribly moving than anything they had yet  seen--that idiot smile as he drew wads of coarse moss from his swollen  cheeks and told them that he was \"a damned moss-eater\"; the continued  vomiting of even the simplest food; and, worst of all, the piteous  and childish voice of complaint in which he told them that his feet  pained him--\"burn like fire\"--which was natural enough when Dr. Cathcart  examined them and found that both were dreadfully frozen. Beneath the  eyes there were faint indications of recent bleeding.    The details of how he survived the prolonged exposure, of where he had  been, or of how he covered the great distance from one camp to the  other, including an immense detour of the lake on foot since he had  no canoe--all this remains unknown. His memory had vanished completely.  And before the end of the winter whose beginning witnessed this strange  occurrence, Defago, bereft of mind, memory and soul, had gone with it.  He lingered only a few weeks.    And what Punk was able to contribute to the story throws no further  light upon it. He was cleaning fish by the lake shore about five o'clock  in the evening--an hour, that is, before the search party returned--when  he saw this shadow of the guide picking its way weakly into camp. In  advance of him, he declares, came the faint whiff of a certain singular  odour.    That same instant old Punk started for home. He covered the entire  journey of three days as only Indian blood could have covered it. The  terror of a whole race drove him. He knew what it all meant. Defago  had \"seen the Wendigo.\""]]]
